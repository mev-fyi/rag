00:00:00.160 - 00:00:55.436, Speaker A: Today I'm going to talk about rigidity of quasicrystals in three D. And first I'm going to give you an outline of the talk. So next, first I'm going to start with some motivation, then some rigidity of quasicrystals into D, then rigidity of quasicrystals in three D, and then some summary and final remarks. So let's start with Tony Robin. So Tony Robin is a mathematical artist, and he is interested in visualizing higher dimensional objects. When you project them to 2D or 3D. So you could think about objects in six dimensions, of five dimensions.
00:00:55.436 - 00:01:34.114, Speaker A: And this could be a picture of something that is projected to. Tony likes to do paintings like the one that you're seeing here, or he also likes to do sculptures like the one you have on the next slide, like this one. So this is called coast, and it is a framework like we have seen many this week. And this is a quasicrystal framework which is made of rhombohedra. So should I do annotate if I want to point?
00:01:39.374 - 00:01:41.514, Speaker B: You don't have any control over that?
00:01:42.374 - 00:01:48.730, Speaker A: Okay, I think I can do. I don't know if people see, maybe.
00:01:48.922 - 00:01:49.490, Speaker B: No.
00:01:49.602 - 00:01:56.494, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, we see on the left. I can go without pointing. Let's try it out.
00:01:58.434 - 00:02:01.414, Speaker B: I gave you remote control, so maybe it works.
00:02:02.194 - 00:02:10.225, Speaker A: Ah, okay. Do you see how the mouse is moving in a face of the rumbahedra or no?
00:02:10.409 - 00:02:12.161, Speaker B: Yes, you do.
00:02:12.257 - 00:02:36.061, Speaker A: Yes, we do. Oh, perfect. Great. Perfect. So this sculpture is made out of rhombohedra, like the ones you see here. And it's made of rods, sorry, bars and joints. And in the faces of the rhombohedra, you see plates.
00:02:36.061 - 00:03:28.764, Speaker A: And what Tony noticed was that when he was doing this structure, when he plated some of the faces of this sculpture, it gave the structure more rigidity. So he came to George Francis, and who is my collaborator in this project. He came to George Francis and he asked him, where should I put the plates in the faces of this structure to make it be more rigid. And he's an artist, so he's interested in the different ways that shadows in the floor are cast when you put different sources of lighting at the top. Okay, so here you can also see some shadows in the floor.
00:03:30.304 - 00:03:38.280, Speaker C: There was a question in the, in the chat, is there any data embedded in the color of the face plates there?
00:03:38.472 - 00:03:57.294, Speaker A: Okay, thanks. There is no data embedded in the colors except the, how do you say, the inspiration of the artist to make it more harmonic, appealing or so? Yes. So this was the question.
00:03:59.874 - 00:04:01.734, Speaker C: For the color of the lighting.
00:04:04.474 - 00:04:54.122, Speaker A: I think it's to the discretion of the artists. Can I do next? Okay. Yes. So, the question is how to make a 3d quasicrystal rigid by plating faces of the rhombohedra. And next. And what we started to do was, well, we know that rigidity in 3D is a difficult problem that we have already heard about this week. So what we started thinking about is, first, let's see what that problem means in the two dimensions, and then try to see what part of that we can extend to 3d.
00:04:54.122 - 00:05:25.174, Speaker A: So, what are quasicrystals in 2D? So, these are basically Penrose stylings. Next. So here at the left, you have a picture of a quasicrystal in two d. And this is a tiling of the plane by two rhombi. So the skinny rhombi is the green one, and the fat rhombi is the blue one. And behind you see some blue lines. These are the almond lines of the Penrose styling.
00:05:25.174 - 00:05:57.086, Speaker A: But this Penrose styling has several important properties. So, next, these stylings do not have any translational symmetries. So these means they are aperiodic. That's why they are also considered quasicrystals. And they have five fold rotational symmetry. And there are many different ways in which you can construct such tilings. Next.
00:05:57.086 - 00:06:43.786, Speaker A: So, for example, you can start with the two rhombi and use some local matching rules to create a bigger pattern. You can do projections of five dimensional lattices into the. Or you can use something called inflation or deflation, by which you would say, from this tiling, create a smaller, finer tiling using some specific rules. Next. So, what we asked is about the rigidity of Penrose frameworks. Next. So, for us, a Penrose framework is a finite region of contiguous run by, in a Penrose tiling.
00:06:43.786 - 00:07:28.890, Speaker A: So what you see on the screen is a picture of an actual Penrose framework that I constructed in the Illinois geometry lab. And what you see is a rigid bracing of that framework. And this is minimally rigid. Okay, so, we asked how to make this rigid by plating faces in the rhombide. Next. And Jan, already early this week, he talked about this theorem, but I'm just going to briefly recall it. So, it works very similar to the bull current result about how to brace grids of squares.
00:07:28.890 - 00:08:24.556, Speaker A: So, the notion that we need for this case is the notion of a ribbon. A maximal succession of contiguous rhombi, whose common edges are parallel is called a ribbon. Next. And we make a bracing graph in which the vertices of the graphs, as the ribbons of the framework. And the edges are the intersections of the ribbon. And the bracing graph is that graph in which you have an edge whenever you have a tile. In the Penrose framework, for example, the vertices in the framework that you have here are one through seven, which are all the ribbons, and the orange edges correspond to the plated faces.
00:08:24.556 - 00:09:00.062, Speaker A: And as you see, this graph is spacing, spanning and connected. Therefore, this framework to the left is rigid. And that is the theorem that we already heard about this week. Next. So here it's a statement. So a Penrose framework is rigid if and only if its bracing graph is spanning and connecting. So, as Jan mentioned earlier, this is a little bit more general than just using Penrose frameworks.
00:09:00.062 - 00:09:40.274, Speaker A: We could talk about groups of parallelograms. And Walter also mentioned some other general statements that can hold for 2d. So let's see what happens in 3D. So this 2d part was to get some inspiration for the 3d problem. Next. So let's consider quasicrystals in 3D. So a quasicrystals in 3D is again very similar to, constructed in a very similar way than to a Penrose tiling.
00:09:40.274 - 00:10:55.722, Speaker A: So you will start with two rhombohedra that have different angles, and you will tile the space, 3d space using this rhombohedra. Then this pattern in space will have no translational symmetries. It will have some five fold or tenfold rotational symmetries, and you can also construct them by projections of higher dimensional lattices. And just to give you a little bit of the story, quasicrystals were first formulated in a mathematical and theoretical way by Paul Steinhardt and Dan Shechman. He observed them in the laboratory. So for this work, Shechtmann won the Nobel Prize in 2011. And he, he received a lot of, how do you say? His work was very controversial at the moment, and it was not accepted for a few years.
00:10:55.722 - 00:11:42.774, Speaker A: But then it became clear that he was right. Quasicrystals happen in nature, and they are very nice structures to consider. And I enjoy very much looking at these pictures of quasicrystals. So I would recommend any papers by Steinhardt on quasicrystals. Many of them have beautiful pictures, like the one you see here or the one I showed earlier for the Penrose style. So for us, a quasicrystal framework would be, in a similar way, just a finite portion of a quasicrystal in three d, the one skeleton. Okay, next.
00:11:42.774 - 00:12:56.680, Speaker A: And I guess I didn't mention it at the beginning, but I didn't define the notion of framework or rigidity, because I think several people have done that before, earlier this week. But this is the main question. We take that quasicrystal structure, a finite region of it made by contiguous rhombi, and we want to plate the faces of that rhombohedra. Next. The idea that was very good for two dimensions is that we could take the rigidity of the two dimensional grids of squares and in a similar fashion, propose a theorem for the rigidity of two to the Penrose frameworks. So the generalization was a column or a column or a row is now a ribbon in the framework. And now we would like to think of the problem of rigidity of 3d cross crystals in a similar way.
00:12:56.680 - 00:13:43.384, Speaker A: Next. So the way we are trying to attack this problem is think of the rigidity of 3d grids and think of what are the properties of these 3d grids that could transfer to the rigidity of 3d quasicrystal frameworks. That's the step we want to do. I'm going to stop here for a moment and ask if there are any questions. Feel free to either write something in the chat or just interrupt me. I'm happy to answer any questions. I'm going to take a sip of water.
00:13:43.384 - 00:14:43.004, Speaker A: Okay, next. So, before going into more results about quasicrystals, let's think about results in 3d grids. And we're going to focus on 3d today. Okay, next. So, to my knowledge, most of the work in three dimensional grids is done for when you have a cube and you brace it, as you see on the left, with a diagonal bar, like you see here. But the problem that I am considering is slightly different because I'm introducing a plate. So I am in two dimensions.
00:14:43.004 - 00:15:11.014, Speaker A: The plate is equivalent to a diagonal bar, but in 3D, that is not the case. And in fact, one of the simplifications we can do is that two diagonal braces would decrease the degrees of freedom by the same number than a plate on the face.
00:15:11.594 - 00:15:26.934, Speaker C: So there is a question in the chat, namely, what about four d? And also the braces only within a face or within a diagonal or just.
00:15:27.674 - 00:15:32.730, Speaker A: Okay, so braces are only, are any angles fixed?
00:15:32.762 - 00:15:35.894, Speaker C: Are the joints really revolute joints?
00:15:37.314 - 00:15:58.382, Speaker A: Okay. Yes. So each joint is a universal. So, okay. In our abstract theory, each joint is universal. So you can, you know, move the edges around any possible angle. That's the first thing in the sculpture that I showed you.
00:15:58.382 - 00:16:51.644, Speaker A: That is not the case. You know, the rods that they use have some fixed angles. But again, you know, even if it has some fixed angles, plating the faces gives more rigidity to the structure. You know, we are not going to consider 4d frameworks or higher dimensional frameworks for today. And at this moment, we are not making any restriction on the motions that we are considering for this framework. Okay. So the question I am setting at this moment is, you know, rigidity, you know, any motion, so any continuous mapping that keeps the length of the bars fixed.
00:16:55.384 - 00:17:01.084, Speaker C: And the plate is a 3d body or is it just a plain plate?
00:17:02.664 - 00:17:08.483, Speaker A: The plate is a rigid 3d body. Okay.
00:17:08.903 - 00:17:11.403, Speaker C: Or is it just body?
00:17:12.223 - 00:17:34.753, Speaker A: I mean, I would, I would say it doesn't have any thickness for my application, but yes, I would call it more like a hinge or like a panel. Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for all the questions. I hope they are all answered.
00:17:34.943 - 00:17:48.954, Speaker D: Have you, have you looked at two and a half D, which is maybe in the previous slide where you said when you showed the quasi crystal, I was almost thought that thing was like a 2d grid that was kind of folding into 3d?
00:17:50.454 - 00:18:18.764, Speaker A: Yes. So that's. So the thing with Penrose stylings is that when you look at them, sometimes the rhombi look like cubes. But no, I mean, the pattern that we're looking is the one dimensional lattice and it's restricted to just live in two d. And the three dimensional quasicrystal is just rhombahedra.
00:18:19.184 - 00:18:31.854, Speaker D: I see the three dimensional case. Yeah. Okay. So the three dimensional case isn't just. You're not, you have not considered the case of a two dimensional grid in 3D.
00:18:33.074 - 00:18:34.834, Speaker A: Exactly. I have not considered it.
00:18:34.874 - 00:18:35.854, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah.
00:18:37.034 - 00:19:42.604, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, great. So here we have, so again, going back to this, we are using plates instead of braces. And usually in the literature you will find results on 3d grids for braces. And next, there are some, there are some basic definitions that you can make on the grid that help you understand, like the motions of the grid. So for example, Crapo uses the notion of a couple, which be two braces in parallel faces of the grid. We also have the notion next of the wall, which would be a contiguous succession of squares.
00:19:42.604 - 00:20:31.054, Speaker A: Next, we also have the notion of plane that would be like the yellow part. There's the notion of a tunnel, which be, sorry, tube, that would be like the union of four walls. Here I have like two walls of the tube that you can see the other two are behind. And we also have the notion of a line, and you can take that line and do a sliding motion along that line. Okay. And these are all geometric units that play a part into the results that I'm going to mention in the next slide. Next.
00:20:31.054 - 00:21:36.304, Speaker A: Okay, so let's see some of the previous results. So, Bolker and Krabbe considered one story buildings. So these would be buildings in which you only have one cube in the z direction and in which the floor of that grid would be grounded to the floor. So there is no motion in the z plane. So they consider these buildings for when you have just one cube. And then radix in 99 considered taller buildings. And Radix, for example, establishes that you would need to put at least three diagonal braces on each floor of a building to make the structure rigid, plus considering each floor, plus rigidifying each floor as a planar framework.
00:21:36.304 - 00:22:52.234, Speaker A: Next. And then there are the results of krappo and Rexy. So Krapo considers grids of cubes in space, and he's bracing these cubes with diagonal braces. And he characterizes what are the secrets of these matriarch. And one of the criticisms that Rexy makes in these 88 paper is that the paper by Krappot doesn't tell you exactly where to put these diagonal braces. So he gives another extra necessary condition in which he uses some other units of lines or walls or tubes to formulate his theorem. Next, these results are for bracing with diagonals.
00:22:52.234 - 00:24:00.068, Speaker A: What I would like to do is to translate these results to translate these results to brazing with plates. Okay, so next, so I'm going to explain some ideas that I have discussed with Walter Whiteley. And these, these ideas are about rigidity of 3d grids when we restrict the motions to a special type of motion. So I'm going to introduce two new concepts, and that's the concepts of stratum and tunnel. A stratum. Here is a picture of a stratum in red. So it's basically a succession of cubes that all lie on the same plane, and they all have parallel edges.
00:24:00.068 - 00:25:16.924, Speaker A: So these red edges are what determine a stratum. And here in the back, I did not draw the red edges, but you can imagine that there are several red edges also in these places. And when you look at this stratum, you should remind, it should be reminiscent of a ribbon of the directions of a ribbon. Okay, so one motion next that we're going to consider is the motion of a shear or shift along a straight. Okay, so you fix a stratum, the grid has several stratum in different directions, and you do a shift along that stratum, which means you move all the edges that determine the stratum by the same amount. So here is a picture of the motions that I want to consider as a first step to generalizing these results to 3d. Okay? And then a tunnel is the intersection of two strata.
00:25:16.924 - 00:26:10.414, Speaker A: Okay? So here you see in blue, you see in blue a tunnel. Okay, next. So the first statement that we can make is that we can translate the shears in the 3d grid to a framework in the sphere and then to a framework in two dimensions. Next. So the way we do this is that the red edge determines a direction in a sphere. So let's say this direction and a point here, and the green stratum determines another direction in the sphere. Let's say this green direction.
00:26:10.414 - 00:27:43.184, Speaker A: And when we put a plate in any of the faces of the tunnel, what we are doing in the sphere is fixing the angle between these two points, or these two between the red and the green. And, you know, when we are considering the rigidity of joining this point and that point in the sphere, this is equivalent to consider the rigidity in the plane. So, one way I like to think about this is if I move around this red point in the plane, you should be thinking that the stratum in red is moving all around with the point. Similarly for the green point, when you move the green point around, the stratum is moving with the grid point, doing a shift or a shear. And whenever these two points are connected by an edge, that means there is a plate. Whenever you move the points together, there is a deformation of the framework. That happens by, you know, if you move the angle of the green by some amount, it gets compensated by moving the angle of the red by some amount.
00:27:43.184 - 00:28:52.436, Speaker A: Next. So this statement has some consequences, some practical consequences. So, to make the 3d grid rigid for shears, the directions of the sphere must become a rigid plane in the framework. So what we do is for each direction of a stratum, we have a direction in the sphere, and then the directions in the sphere determine points that then become a framework in the plane. And we have to make that framework in the plane rigid. Okay, next. So what we need to do is if s is the total number of strata, a necessary and sufficient condition for these framework to be rigid would be two times s minus three plates by a classic result of rigidity, of generic rigidity in two dimensions.
00:28:52.436 - 00:29:54.964, Speaker A: So I put this asterisk of this is only valid for generic directions. So these points that you see in the plane that correspond to the straight need to be generic. Okay? So this is one first consequence. The second consequence, maybe it's a little bit more visual or intuitive, is that a 3d grid with plated faces is rigid. If and only if, the three shadow projections in each direction, x, y or z, is plane rigid. Next. So, what do we mean by this? So, if you have a k times l times m grid, as you see here, I know that this is like a two by four by something, but imagine it is k by l by n.
00:29:54.964 - 00:30:45.998, Speaker A: And then when we say that each projection is plain rigid, it means that we are plating faces in the grid. And I consider the shadow of that plating in the. This would be the x plane. Sorry, the xy plane. So, if I see a. If I see that the shadow of the bracing of the grid is plain rigid as a k by l grid. And the shadow in the back on the k times m grid, is plain rigid, and the other shadow in the other grid, m times l, is plain rigid, then I will have a rigid framework.
00:30:45.998 - 00:32:07.434, Speaker A: So we can do a count next, using the results of plane rigidity. So, for example, if we look, okay, so here the x is the k times l grid. So, by the results in 2d rigidity, we know that we need k plus l faces or bars to make that grid rigid. And similarly, for the other two grids, we need l plus m minus one braces to make that rigid. And in the k times m grid, we need k plus m minus one braces to make that rigid. So, if we add all of these faces that we need to make this framework rigid, we get a total of two times k plus n plus l minus three faces, we get a total of two times s minus three faces that are plated. And as we saw in the slide before, this is a necessary condition for rigidity.
00:32:07.434 - 00:33:29.824, Speaker A: So, this plating, this grid in this way, will produce a rigid framework. Now, if one. Imagine that one of the projections is not rigid, you can lift the motion of the projection to a motion of the full 3d grid. This is a way to translate between the rigidity of the 3d grid and some rigidity in the plane. Are there any questions so far? Okay, next. Okay, so, the ideas that I just discussed, I think I saw a similar reasoning in a paper in 94 by Nagi, in which next, he calls these shears along the stratum a special assumption. Special assumption.
00:33:29.824 - 00:34:36.784, Speaker A: And it's a similar argument to the one that we were doing. And Nagi even considers something similar to quasicrystals. They are not called quasicrystals. They are sonohedra, in which you could also, in principle, formulate the notion of a ribbon. So, the good thing about quasicrystals is that you can also define the notion of a ribbon when you start by using rhombohedra and taking those four parallel edges on the rhombohedra, and consider the contiguous collections of those edges. So, for you to have a visual picture of this, we have a rhombic tricontrahedra in this picture. So maybe it's hard to see, but to ask you to make an effort to see that there is a rhombohedra here.
00:34:36.784 - 00:35:54.494, Speaker A: Okay? And these purple lines would be, let's say, the strata that that happened, you know, that is present in this trichontrahedra. And when we're thinking about 3d grids, there will be strata in, like the three coordinate directions. But when we're thinking about 3d classic crystals, there will be this kind of strata in many more directions. So you would have, for example, a red strata, the cyan strata. There are two types of green strata. And the question is, and what we would like to prove is that we can do a similar argument as the one that we were doing for the 3d grids. As a first step, we would restrict to motions in which you just move all the edges that are in a strata, like in the grid.
00:35:54.494 - 00:36:44.836, Speaker A: That would be a first step. But of course, the ultimate goal is to, you know, forget about this special assumption in which we only consider these motions, and we consider more general motions, like twisting the formations, or the formations in which the faces of the ROM, in which the vertices of the phases of the rhombi do not remain co planner. And next. So this is a work in progress. And, okay, I think I spoke a little bit fast, but it's okay. So here's some summary and final remarks. So, next.
00:36:44.836 - 00:38:18.034, Speaker A: So I talked about the rigidity of finite to the Penrose frameworks. But one open question to consider would be, what happens with infinite Penrose frameworks? So, these questions were formulated by Derek Kitson, who gave a talk earlier this week. So, one of the questions he asks is, does this DRM for Penrose frameworks extend for infinite Penrose frameworks? Is there an algorithm for constructing an ethnic Penrose framework that is rigid? And these are some open questions in two d and in 3D. We could also next consider infinite frameworks. But the question that I'm considering, and still we didn't answer, is to consider the rigidity of, to see which part of the rigidity of 3d grids can we use to determine the rigidity of 3d quasicrystals, and what happens when we have more general motions. And thank you, that's all I wanted to present. And are there any questions?
00:38:20.574 - 00:38:25.314, Speaker C: Thank you, Eliana. And we are open for questions and comments.
00:38:30.334 - 00:39:28.314, Speaker B: Let me make a couple of comments. Statement for 3D with the three trees. By the way, that's sort of a version of Crapo's statement of Leman's theorem. Namely, you need three trees, two at every vertex. So it's the tree two covering version of the rigidity in the plane. The second is the correspondence for 3D with shears applies both generically and non generically. So if the framework in 3D on the sphere had an infinite, had an infinitesimal motion, or a finite motion that would transfer to the.
00:39:28.314 - 00:39:30.124, Speaker B: To the shears.
00:39:33.224 - 00:39:35.444, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:39:43.464 - 00:39:48.364, Speaker C: So, very simple question. What's the name of the artist you mentioned in the beginning?
00:39:49.784 - 00:39:56.404, Speaker A: Tony Robin. He has a webpage with a beautiful art.
00:39:59.304 - 00:40:04.244, Speaker C: So how did you get to know this artwork? Coincidental.
00:40:05.544 - 00:41:10.810, Speaker A: So, I was a student at University of Illinois, and George Francis is a longtime friend of Tony, and he's a professor. He's now an emeritus professor at University of Illinois, and he is a longtime friend of Tony. And George has always been interested in visualizing objects, you know, for his amusement, I would say, his main motivation. And he maintained this relation with Tony. And Tony asked him, like, look, I have this structure. I want to make it rigid. I noticed that by when I was constructing it, because he constructed the picture that I just showed you, he saw that where he put the plates, it contributed to the rigidity of the structure.
00:41:10.810 - 00:41:19.144, Speaker A: So he was really wanting to know, how could he do it better so that the thing wouldn't collapse. Let's see.
00:41:20.924 - 00:41:24.904, Speaker C: So there's a question in the chat if this was in Chicago.
00:41:26.324 - 00:41:46.564, Speaker A: No, that was the. I think I wrote it in the slide, a danish technical institute. And the sad news is that it doesn't exist anymore. Actually, it was taken down by university officials.
00:41:49.384 - 00:41:51.324, Speaker C: Safety reasons or other.
00:41:53.104 - 00:42:01.564, Speaker A: Apparently. Maybe some dean didn't like it, or. I don't know. Maybe it was security. I really don't know.
00:42:03.664 - 00:42:53.120, Speaker E: So, Eliana, I have a question. First of all, I enjoyed your talk, and I enjoyed a previous version that you gave in Daniel Bernstein seminar series, which got me thinking a little bit. I think there's no problem in extending it to infinite Penrose frameworks by a slightly different approach, looking for a kind of generalized basis of shears. And in fact, the argument can extend even to parallelogram frameworks in general. I think. So the quasicrystal ingredient isn't so essential. But of course, the most beautiful examples come from substitution systems and favorite examples.
00:42:53.120 - 00:42:56.444, Speaker E: So, yeah, that's just a comment.
00:42:57.264 - 00:43:22.544, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. I am sorry. When I think of a Penrose framework, you could think that there are like, in an infinite framework, you can think that there are ribbons in five different directions. That's right. Would give like control of the ribbons. I wouldn't know exactly how to do it for parallelograms.
00:43:25.084 - 00:43:27.236, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's similar that you.
00:43:27.260 - 00:43:28.940, Speaker A: Think it works for that.
00:43:29.092 - 00:43:37.452, Speaker E: It depends on an inductive way of exhausting all the shearing motions. Yeah.
00:43:37.508 - 00:43:39.624, Speaker A: Okay, I see.
00:43:39.924 - 00:43:40.864, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:43:45.284 - 00:44:24.224, Speaker F: So I was just going to add to what Steve was saying, actually, it was basically going to be the same thing. But I think Janin Georgia, they use a coloring method to give the results and the. You can show the nat coloring method works for infinite frameworks. So an infinite framework is flexible if and only if it has a nat coloring. I've got proof that it's not too complicated, but I mean, it doesn't give you the full results because there's a bit more to it than just a Nat coloring. It needs to be like a special kind and you need like a construction as well. But yeah, I'm just agreeing with Steve.
00:44:24.224 - 00:44:25.804, Speaker F: That is most likely correct.
00:44:26.944 - 00:44:33.128, Speaker A: Okay. I didn't know the NAC colorings work for infinite frameworks as well.
00:44:33.176 - 00:45:07.380, Speaker G: So yes, of regarding this infinite neck colorings, or neck colorings of infinite graphs, we are pretty sure it should work. So we have a proof written down. Actually it's submitted for a conference. We still don't have like foolproof for the, for the P frameworks, for the frameworks consisting of parallelograms. But I think it should work with this cartesian neck coverings also for infinite graphs. I have a sketch of the proof in mind. It's just not written.
00:45:07.380 - 00:45:56.414, Speaker G: I hope to have time next week to maybe write it down. And yeah, I think it should work. Maybe. I have a comment also about the reduction to sphere. So with Matteo and Josef and Georg, we have a paper characterizing where there exists a flexible framework on sphere. It uses also two edge coloring with slightly different condition than for an ECH coloring. But yes, we can show that there exists a flexible framework on sphere if and only if there exists certain kind of edge coloring.
00:45:56.414 - 00:46:14.886, Speaker G: So that's something that might help in the 3d case. Again, it's a statement about non generic frameworks, which is something I think occur with the greasing.
00:46:15.070 - 00:46:26.630, Speaker A: So you're saying that maybe with the knot coloring we can get away with the generic assumption that we were using, like in the. What I explained for the sphere is.
00:46:26.662 - 00:47:26.274, Speaker G: That the consequence so for sure that the direction that works is that if you have something that is flexible on sphere, then the graph has a certain kind of edge coloring for the other direction. If you have this, we call it nap coloring for no alternating path for the opposite direction. It's just a construction. If you have a nap coloring, you construct some flexible framework on sphere, which probably doesn't correspond to the grid. But if you have a flexible grid, you have flexible framework on sphere, and then you know that there is this nep coloring of that graph on sphere. So to make analog with the neck colorings, it works exactly the same with the neck colorings and the neck coloring case. We are lucky in the sense that if you have a p framework, we can also show the other direction.
00:47:26.274 - 00:47:45.794, Speaker G: If you have a neck coloring, we can make the p framework flexible. I don't see this, dia. And yeah, so for neck coloring, we have this extra property that it's cartesian for the napkal rings. I don't see now what this extra property would be or whether it would work or not in the opposite implication.
00:47:48.454 - 00:47:49.794, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:47:50.614 - 00:47:56.874, Speaker G: Thanks for nice talk. I think now I understand also Walter's emails about mapping to circles and then spheres.
00:47:58.414 - 00:48:44.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question to know that it's finite motion of one implies finite motion of the other. I think that's doable. And that was done in the plane. Let me make one comment in case people are trying to track references when for grids of cubes and bracing grids of cubes. The author is actually ethan Bolker, not Henry Kraepel. All of that stuff comes from a nice paper, Beethan Bolker, where he ironically thanks his appendix for putting him in the hospital so he had the time to write it up. Ethan, by the way, is still active.
00:48:44.680 - 00:48:48.644, Speaker B: And one could correspond with Ethan further, if you'd like.
00:48:52.464 - 00:49:07.744, Speaker E: So, Walter, thank you. Chip in and ask you why the Boelke paper and the Boca crapo papers appeared twice. They appeared later on in Siam and originally in some kind of building journal. Is there a story behind that?
00:49:09.444 - 00:49:22.504, Speaker B: Probably, but I don't know it. Ethan could tell us. He's. Like I said, he's still. I get occasional emails from him about rigidity things. He's definitely.
00:49:25.664 - 00:49:42.684, Speaker E: I kind of guessed that perhaps they regretted publishing it in this planning journal and it wasn't being read by mathematicians and they took an interest. That's just my guess, because the papers are very similar when they appear in the Siam a couple of years later.
00:49:48.144 - 00:50:05.204, Speaker A: That fact got me confused for a second, because I was looking the earlier papers and was wanting more proofs and then saw the next papers and I was like, oh, okay. Yes, I was also wondering the same thing.
00:50:11.184 - 00:51:13.582, Speaker C: There are some questions in the chat or some discussion going on with those people. Speak up. That would be nice. So anyway, what I was always finding fascinating about grid problems or parallel hydra problems was, was that there is a perfectly non generic problem that has a wonderfully generic solution. So to only require the rigidity or the connectivity of the underlying brace graph, or whatever you call it, is a miracle. And I find that fascinating. And I wonder if you have some feeling for what you expect for the 3d problem also to have a completely generic solution.
00:51:13.582 - 00:51:15.314, Speaker C: One dimension lower.
00:51:20.734 - 00:51:24.070, Speaker A: You mean one dimension higher or lower?
00:51:24.102 - 00:51:37.114, Speaker C: So, for example, the 2d grid problem is just the connectivity of a graph. One dimension lower, rigidity problem, if you want.
00:51:38.284 - 00:51:41.500, Speaker B: But that's what sphere. Sphere is one dimension lower.
00:51:41.652 - 00:51:42.204, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:42.324 - 00:51:47.380, Speaker B: Isn't it? Isn't generic. The sphere. The line is generic, and the sphere is not.
00:51:47.452 - 00:51:48.676, Speaker C: It's not generic anymore.
00:51:48.700 - 00:51:53.704, Speaker B: It's got inherent geometry and you can't get away from it.
00:51:55.524 - 00:51:56.384, Speaker C: Okay.
00:51:59.364 - 00:52:28.972, Speaker A: Yeah, I. I don't know. I. I. You know, I. So in the 2d quasicrystal case, it was sort of a surprise, I guess, at some point that it had nothing to do with the quasicrystal. At the end, you know, like the properties of the quasicrystal, you could almost forget about, you know, my.
00:52:28.972 - 00:52:57.604, Speaker A: I would like to see if it's the same for 3d quasicrystal. Maybe it is, but right now, I don't have a good intuition of what would happen, but probably we restrict to the motions that are given by those strata. I would guess we could maybe prove something similar, but I really don't know.
