00:00:00.920 - 00:00:54.881, Speaker A: All right, It's a pleasure to welcome our second speaker this morning, Professor Jelena Grubic from University of Southampton, and she'll talk about steel rod operations on polyhedral products. Thank you, Teres, and thank you to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to come here to enjoy and have fun and also to give a talk. So, yes, I'll be talking today. It's a very easy kind of talk on standard operations on polyhedral products. And the hardest part is to write down all the surnames of my collaborators. So this was part of Women in Topology network series. So hands so many quotas.
00:00:54.881 - 00:01:45.479, Speaker A: So Sanjana, Michelle, Milica, Evgenia and Sara, together with me, we're doing. We're really learning about polyhiro products. None of them ever working in Forex topology or associated areas. So it was lots of fun. Okay, so as I saw, I'll keep it easy today. And so the idea is, what can we say about any cohomological operations on a polyhedral product? Or they are kind of similar or related spaces. And we started with the Steener operations and have moved further away from them.
00:01:45.479 - 00:03:10.315, Speaker A: So if anyone wants to study other cohomological operations. And I know Stephen was talking about certain operations on Stephen Amoled on poly product earlier this during this program. Okay, so I know some of us were talking every day at least 20 times mentioning polyhedral products, but I feel since it's Monday and it's early morning, I can remind us what the definition is. So let's start with a simplatial complex K on M vertices. And so this is one M. And then we consider M pointed topological pairs. So, so, okay, and to them we associate the polyhedral product as a subspace.
00:03:10.315 - 00:05:07.391, Speaker A: Oh, but I put under bars. So this denotes this M tuple of the vertical pairs here as a subspace of the cartesian product of all these XI's that is governed by the shape of the simplicial complex K, where these subspaces glue along K and subspaces are given such that those coordinates that are not labeled by sigma allow just to stay within AI. And those that are labeled by Sigma can move throughout whole Xi. Okay, so our main orbiters will be for today the Davis Januskiewicz space, which we can write as a polyhedral product of CP infinity and the point where all m pairs are identified with this pair 2K and the moment angle complex P2S1. Okay, okay. So these are the guys that will. That we will look at coming from polyhedral products.
00:05:07.391 - 00:06:12.411, Speaker A: And as I said, like we wanted to study Some cohomological operations. And so the cohomological operations on natural transformations of the associated cohomology functors. And the first one that actually we know already in this setup is looking at the cup product. And this is. Yeah, so, okay, let me say these. We start with a N, R is some commutative ring that's meta and we associate to it, start with the class and we associate to it the cup product, so. Or cup square.
00:06:12.411 - 00:07:21.081, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's essentially how Steener squares were introduced. So you have the cup product squaring that induces a family of cohomological operations. And they are unstable operations because obviously if we suspend X, we kill all cup products. So these, this becomes trivial. So Stinner then defined his operations. So Stynard squares by really looking to have some kind of squares, but wanting them to be stable rather than unstable. So he define standard squares by say I squared.
00:07:21.081 - 00:09:15.341, Speaker A: So it takes the nth class in the mode two cosmology of a space and associates a class of degree n plus I. Okay? So these are primitive cohomological, stable cohomological operations. And you can construct them geometrically or you can approach them axiomatically. So what you can see is that these squares, they generate connected graded algebra where these sqis ith operation ith squares are generators. But that's sub these algebraic subject to the ADAM relations. And as I say, if you were to define them axiomatically, you could say that they are such that square zero is the identity. And we have this instability condition telling us that if you start that.
00:09:15.341 - 00:10:19.225, Speaker A: Sorry, if you start with N class, all cosmologies will be with the two coefficients. I'll stop writing the coefficients and you apply to it N squared. That means you will land in 2n of x. This is just a couple of squaring. So sqn x degree of x is N. Then this is just X. And if you take square D, say where d is greater than the degree of X in this case N, then the is acting trivially on that element.
00:10:19.225 - 00:11:43.095, Speaker A: Okay? And then let me not write all the axioms, but just saying that interplay of the Steener squares with the cup product is given by the cotton formula. Okay? Or you can, because I'm going to use it, define it here. You could say the same thing by saying that the total square that is given as the sum of all squares is what it is. It's an algebra map. It's a multiplicative map. Okay, so this is what we want to study for our for certain poly products, namely how this Steener algebra is acting on certain polyhedral products. So the easiest thing to start with as warm up is to look at the Davis Shanovskiewicz space.
00:11:43.095 - 00:13:21.035, Speaker A: So a polyhedral product of ZP infinity point to the power K. Okay, so we know that the cohomology of David Januskovic space cranny ring R SSL Since I want to study for this talk just talk about mod p standard operations. I'll take that too. Is the Stanley rising ring of K, namely that is a polynomial on m m variables and then we quotient it out by the by the Stanley Riser ideal. So here we are assuming that all XI's I usually write all my life VI's I don't know why switch for this talk for some reason for excise yeah, my notes are weak, doesn't matter. Xi is equal to 2. And now let me just recall that the Stanley Riser ideal is the ideal generated with the square free monomials labeled by sigma where sigma is not a face of K.
00:13:21.035 - 00:14:52.855, Speaker A: Okay So yeah, if sigma is a subset of m vertices so it say I want to, I want to Il then you take a square free monomials on those axes that are labeled by sigma. Okay, so, so one can ask, okay, how does the algebra act here? And so what we have to do this is an algebra is move. So sorry, this is the definition. Well, here it's easy. So all what we have to do is to look at this algebraic object and put the right action of the synod algebra. I mean on this part you can put many different actions and obviously because we want to show that this is morphism is isomorphism of a algebra, a Synod algebras then natural thing to do is to recall that this is coming from the cohomology of CP infinity and just use those t 0 squares. In other words, the total square of xi is xi plus xi squared.
00:14:52.855 - 00:16:14.825, Speaker A: Okay, so once you have that, then obviously you can see that this ideal is close under the action of the steener because of what it does. When you apply squares to monomials like that, they just raise the powers. So obviously if they were labeled by something that is not a simplex in K, what you get will be divisible by this guy again. So hence it's sitting in the ideal. Okay, and now you know, so I'm saying this, I'm showing this trivial example just because I don't know to do anything more complicated as I will illustrate later. So you know, so once you have this algebra, once you have the Steinhardt algebra acting on this Algebra side, then you have to show that this is isomorphic to the geometry. So obviously here what we're gonna do, we'll look at Davis Yanusket space and recall that this is a polyhedral product, namely six nicely into the product of CP infinities copies.
00:16:14.825 - 00:17:19.735, Speaker A: And you looked at CP infinity as a CW complex and say, well, okay, it's built. All the cells are such that in each even degree we have only one cell. Then you take the product and induce product CW structure on it. And then you see that this inclusion of the David Sianrskiewicz space into CP infinity is nice. So namely all the stuff that we know, how CP infinity acts, how the Sino algebra acts on CP infinity will be kind of close on the Davis Younger cave spaces. And then obviously you show that this, that gives you that this is morphism is isomorphism over the Steiner algebra. Okay, so, and now you can play the game further.
00:17:19.735 - 00:19:51.369, Speaker A: So like, how, how important was the DCCP infinity? Well, not much. So what you can do, you can consider any polyhedral product X base point to the k. And if XI's are nice in the sense that if they satisfy the strong Kineth formula, namely if we take that cohomology, okay, of X1 tensor cohomology, SAM is isomorphic to the cohomology of X1, then BBCG. So Tony, Martin, Fred and Sam tell us that the cohomology of this in a very generalized Davis Januskin space has an analogous form of the Stanley rising ring, namely, I'll Keep here coefficients z2, but it works for any R under which we have this isomorphism. So sorry, what do I have? Yeah, so what's here we have the polynomial algebra on x1 to xm, but this is nothing else but cohomology of CP infinity tensor by itself M times. So, okay, so you have cohomology of X1 tensor and you portion out with the Stanley rise ideal or generalization of that corresponding to X1 to XM. And let me not write that explicitly, but it really generalizes this.
00:19:51.369 - 00:21:52.215, Speaker A: So before we had all axes, maybe it's easy actually to write and then I don't have to worry. Let me write here board organization terrible, but okay, survive x1 to xm square three monomials P such that each this xi j belongs to the cohomology of X I j and this simplex determined by these indices I want P Oops, is not a simplex of K. Okay, so here again you, you can determine explicitly the the action of the Steener squares, namely each cohomology of topological space has the action of the stairs. And if you recall that there is co multiplications in amongst thinner squares that will induce thin reduction on this tensor product. And then from there you again play the same game. You show that the ideal is invariant under the Stein reduction and you determine the action or the Steener squares on this polyker product in terms of the Steiner products on each individual space xi. Okay? Yes.
00:21:57.235 - 00:22:16.985, Speaker B: Do you really have to show this invariance of this ideal? I mean shouldn't that drop out? Shouldn't that be necessarily the case? Because some of the map, I guess the map from the cohomology of the cartesian product to the cohomology of the polyheroid product that comes from the inclusion is suggested.
00:22:17.025 - 00:22:21.645, Speaker A: I'm saying much, much more trivial thing than you are talking about.
00:22:23.785 - 00:22:25.873, Speaker B: That this idea is stable.
00:22:25.929 - 00:22:36.157, Speaker A: Yeah. That this is an isomorphism is an automatic all. What I want to say first is that I want to define here I can define various standard algebra.
00:22:36.221 - 00:22:49.013, Speaker B: But you don't need. I mean the first map is. You know how the first, the map above interacts with the Steamort squares by the odd by the Cartan formula. Right. From the tensor product to the cartesian product.
00:22:49.109 - 00:22:57.181, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's what I say. That's how I define on the tensor and then I say why can I quotient it out? Why can I define the natural.
00:22:57.253 - 00:23:06.073, Speaker B: I mean there's nothing to define. It's just the cut down formula and then it's natural. And then because it comes from a map of spaces, I think it's proof is trivial.
00:23:06.129 - 00:23:45.885, Speaker A: I'm not saying that it's difficult, I'm just saying you have to check that this ideal is closed. Yeah, but the proof is super easy. I'm just saying. Let me tell you what my problem is with the moment angle complex and then you'll see why I kind of try to tell people. Yes, there are lots of different T0 squares that you can define here. This is the easiest way and most natural to define one that will then match this kind of geometric side. Yeah.
00:23:45.885 - 00:25:05.315, Speaker A: Okay, so obviously then as an example free, you get that the Steener direction on the real moment angle complex. What do we have? Infinity? Okay, well again so. So this is 10 rising ring xm in this case degree one and obviously the formula depends only on the standard action acting on RP infinity. So if you take xi xi plus xi square, this is the total square quotient portion. You're absolutely right. Thank you. So yeah, so if you want to move forward and think what can we say about the moment angle complex.
00:25:05.315 - 00:26:06.839, Speaker A: So things are kind of, as I say here, everything was really trivial. I mean, you just have a nice presentation of the cohomology of, of David Chandler's cavit space and you're using that to just state the things as. No real need to work hard on that. However, here we don't have an explicit presentation, but we know that the cohomology of ZK is the isomorphic to the Tor over the polynomial ring. Oops. Or the Stanley rising ring. So do I have Z2K and Z2 and I don't know how to put the steamer algebra action on this guy to be able to then see what's the steam.
00:26:06.839 - 00:27:15.791, Speaker A: And I still don't know after so many months of thinking one natural thing would be maybe take a resolution, see what it goes there other resolution. That's when you remember all these things that you learn as a PhD student and learn them too inaccurately because this is a commutative. If you were to put the stint algebra on the resolution, on the Kozuel resolution, sorry, you end up with a trivial steward algebra. And that definitely is not the one that would correspond to here. Yes, Tony, sorry. I look at that and I try to mimic that on this side and I couldn't find that matches. So yeah, so that's for people who want to play with this.
00:27:15.791 - 00:28:27.051, Speaker A: This is one thing to do. So what kind of steener operations can we put on the toe so that they correspond to the stenod action on the moment complex? Okay, so for me that was a dead end for a long time and still is. But as I said, at least I recall some basic things about steel algebra that I incorrectly learned or remembered from my youth. But then again, Tony, Martin, Fred and Sam come to help and they tell us that if you suspend the moment angle complex then it breaks nicely in terms of full subcomplexes. So, okay, so this is badge of. Oh, I probably need more suspensions. Do I not know this by now? Suspension.
00:28:27.051 - 00:28:57.015, Speaker A: Oh, why do I have. Oh, sorry. One sum is sigma, sometimes sum and sometimes suspension. At this point I needed to be a suspension. So I have wedge of suspensions of J + 2 of the full sub complex on the set J. And J is. What do I have? J is not in K.
00:28:57.015 - 00:31:07.625, Speaker A: Okay, so now one can say, well, okay, now we are done because we know that steener squares are stable operations. So now we can determine the steener directions on ZK with respect to the in terms of the steener actions on the full subcomplexes Obviously this induces an isomorphism in coology. What I have J +1 or the copy now. Well, you. Yes, this is kind of abstractly we know everything, but can we now say something about the Steener action on zk? I mean, apart from saying abstractly, yes, whatever stenod square we have in the cohomology of, of these full subcomplexes, it will rise to the Steinhardt algebra here on the moment echo complex. Okay, so first to notice again, these are all very trivial observations, but fun nevertheless I think is that if the dimension of the simplicial complex K is for example D, then all squares where N is greater than half D will be trivial because obviously this is a geometrical dimension of simplicity complex. Yeah, no, not cohomological.
00:31:07.625 - 00:32:26.935, Speaker A: Since K is of dimension D, then all full subcomplexes will be of dimension less than D as well, or equal to D. Okay. And in particular, if K is a graph, then there are no non trivial standard operations on that came. Okay, And I mean this is just as I say, a simple corollary, but we know much more about the homotopy type of, of moment angle complexes that are associated to graph. So we talked about that in this program. So Stephen and Russ were mentioning, you know, if you have an N gon, then ZK is connected sum of a product of two spheres. Or you know, you, you can if you have two points, it's a sphere and so on.
00:32:26.935 - 00:33:50.061, Speaker A: Okay, so playing this type of game, we can look at a simplicial complex K that is a triangulation of RP2, RP2, and I'll so look at RP2 and take its triangulation on six vertices. So I'll denote that as P26. So that's something like this. Okay, so If I put 1, 2, 3 and then 4, 5, 6, 45 6. This identification as we usually put for the RP2 model. So now you can see first of all Z K is homotopy equivalent. So this BBCG decomposition disuspends.
00:33:50.061 - 00:35:02.065, Speaker A: And this is some wedges of spheres. We know that the number C alpha and then wedge of what suspension seven of RP2. So Tara, Steven Jiwoo and I showed that this in this case, that case splits unstably. And obviously here you have the Steener direction acting here. So if you take X in degree what 8 and y in degree 9, that this is connected by square one. And obviously you can see that here by taking in K or in the cohomology of K, you will have a X in degree one and Y in degree two and they are connected by square one. Okay, so that tells us something.
00:35:02.065 - 00:36:22.771, Speaker A: So this is a minimal model or minimal model of RP2. And we can see that whenever this complex is a full subcomplex of K then there is a non trivial square one in Z K. But also that gives you a nice kind of statement or observation that on all classes below or equal 7 degree 7, you can't have non trivial square one. So square one acts trivially on classes of degree is equal to 7 and this is an optimal bound because obviously when it's a. Yeah, when you. In degree eight. Yeah, we have.
00:36:22.771 - 00:37:18.485, Speaker A: We have a non trivial square one. Okay, so what we. I'm one third from my lecture thinking okay, so the way we proved that we actually I was planning to talk about that, but now there is no time. We developed for formula for square N for any action of square N on a co chain of simplicial complexes. So it's this kind of computer scientists, they're already autopologists, they already develop. There exist algorithms. However, we develop a slightly faster one and we use that just for fun to prove this.
00:37:18.485 - 00:37:44.905, Speaker A: And also as a consequence, we got that this is a minimal model because you know, if you're looking through the literature, there is no minimal model for RP2. There is no explicit kind of reference. Why would this be minimal model of RP2? Okay. Yes.
00:37:46.725 - 00:37:50.173, Speaker C: Chromology of ZK splits up like that.
00:37:50.269 - 00:37:50.725, Speaker A: Yep.
00:37:50.805 - 00:38:10.495, Speaker C: Well, even in the general case. Even in the general case, if you have the stable splitting, you can put a ring structure on the right hand side. Ring structure is isomorphic as rings to the. Okay, so it's a sort of interesting. I don't know if it follows.
00:38:10.575 - 00:38:11.355, Speaker A: I want.
00:38:12.055 - 00:38:24.711, Speaker C: I don't know if it follows. But if you use the STAR product or whatever to define steamroll operations on the right, they would be isomorphic rings over the steam product. That's worth asking.
00:38:24.823 - 00:39:01.337, Speaker A: That's. Yeah, you. That's right. Star. Star product could be used. So here what is again it's just an observation is that standard actions here are how to say they sit inside each summand so they don't mix summons where the cup product mixes the summons. So if you want to have non trivial cup product you have to take one KJ and another ki where J and I are this joint.
00:39:01.337 - 00:39:39.095, Speaker A: So in. In some. In that way where Steener is acting really just inside each summon, so it's not mixing. So that's one way to show that there are no cup squares in zk. Yeah, but yes, on a CO chain. But yeah, that's another approach to look whether one can explicitly define Stnr algebra using the star product. Yes, yes.
00:39:42.715 - 00:39:47.475, Speaker B: You talked about a minimal model for RP2. Did you mean a minimal triangulation?
00:39:47.635 - 00:40:31.145, Speaker A: Triangulation, sorry, simplicial complex that's not known what a minimum? No, no. So like I try to find non trivial reference to this statement and it is known, but I couldn't find, as I say, a non trivial statement that implies that this is the minimal. So yes, it is. From here also we can see that is minimal because minimal triangulation of RP2. Yes, because if there was a smaller one on fewer. By minimal I mean on a small number of vertices. So now a question to topologies is.
00:40:31.145 - 00:42:16.205, Speaker A: Okay, so for square one we know we need at least six vertices to define a simplicial complex that c square one. What about higher squares? Namely if how many vertices? So, so this is if I have square I, what is the minimal number of vertices of a simplicial complex K such that square one I act trivially. Non trivially, sorry, on that simplicial complex. And then if we have that, then obviously you can show that sqi would act trivially. So this is kind of corollary on classes of degree, what M I plus I in that case. But what is the smallest simplicial complex in which we can say C squared 2? I don't know. So, but I was hoping that maybe so many good apologies and homotopy theories here that someone could tell me which simplicial complex to look say to realize square two.
00:42:16.205 - 00:43:58.709, Speaker A: Realize non trivial action square two. Okay, so Tony was mentioning this week that construction of polyhedral joint is underutilized in our subject. So the definition is same as here, except if I want join, I put join here and I put join here. And this is also kind of joined. So the advantage of looking at a join is that if you now take a sequence of simplicial pairs, say, okay, then this simple polyhedral joint product will be also simplitional complex. So what do we want now we saw from this stable decomposition that if we know how the Steiner acts on a simplicial complexes, then we know how it acts on the moment angle complex. So now this four sub component when, when you have K, you really can't nicely, you can't classify in general what will be full sub complexes.
00:43:58.709 - 00:44:26.039, Speaker A: Full subcomplexes can be whatever you want when you. In general. Yeah. So in other Words, they are not determined by K. Yeah. So one interesting simplicial complex is this one coming from the polyhedral joint. And so this is a general one.
00:44:26.039 - 00:45:42.335, Speaker A: And then we can look at special families. Namely if I, for this sequence of case, if I take simplex a full complex, yeah. And then I take the boundary of that simplex, then we recover a construction by BBC G, and they call that simplicial badge. And denote by say L1, 2, LM. And then Anthony is back. So he generalized this into what he calls simplicial composition and denotes by K of L1 to LM. And then Taras and Semiannov had another.
00:45:42.335 - 00:47:14.655, Speaker A: So this you could almost think as an analog of the of the moment angle complex. You have contractable space disc. And then, okay, it's not S1 that's here, but this is a sub complex. And then kind of the analog go of the space would be that to take some complex K here and the empty set, as I say, Taras and Semiannov called it substitution complex and denote by K1 to KM. Okay, so in general, if you're looking, looking at that simplicial composition, then Neither K nor L1 to LM are full sub complexes. So you would think so what I want, I want to, if possible, I know how Steener acts on K, and I know how Steener acts on L. Can I say how the Steener acts on the whole guy here? So what we did, we showed that actually this is homotopy equivalent to k join l1, join lm.
00:47:14.655 - 00:49:02.385, Speaker A: And although, as I said, li and lm to lm and k are not full subcomplexes, you still can say that the Steener action on K, L1 and LM will rise to the Steener action on that K, because K is a full subcomplex of itself here. Things are nicer from the perspective of moment angle complex, in a sense that all these K, K1 and KM, they are all full subcomplexes of this substitution complex. But I'll close. So therefore the stenoard action on them will rise to the Steenrod action on, on that cane. But maybe again, as an open thing for people to think about and use, maybe in the future I'll give you the deconstruction, not just a construction of this substitution complex that I find very interesting in a sense that it can be used in homotopy theory or polyhedral products a lot. So we are looking at a substitution complex k1 to km. Remember, that's a joint product where we take k1 to km and sub.
00:49:02.385 - 00:50:03.231, Speaker A: Subcomplex is just the empty set. And I'll assume it's always that K is on M and K is on Ni vertices. And if this construction in a way can be iterated. So if I denote by k 0k and k 1 is now substitution of just k 1 into the instead of first vertex, sorry, wrong brackets. And then I keep dot will be one vertex complex. Or someone can call it just a point or a vertex. So then k1 is obviously on n1 plus m minus 1 vertices.
00:50:03.231 - 00:50:48.115, Speaker A: Because we kept this m minus 1 vertices. And instead of the first vertex we substituted k1 that is on n1 vertices. Okay? And then k2 will be k1. Then you have these dots vertices and 1 and you substitute. Instead of the second vertex in k, you put k2 and the rest you keep as it was. So this is a complex. Now on N1 plus N2 plus M minus two vertices.
00:50:48.115 - 00:51:53.765, Speaker A: Okay? And then finish by saying that KM as you can now guess, just this iteration you come to KM minus first stage and complex and into it you substitute. This is all dots last complex km. And obviously these are how many vertices you have. While the sum of Ni is when I goes from 1 to N minus 1. Okay, then I'll stop here. Then we can say that K, the substitution complex k1 to km is homotopy equivalent to K wedge link in K naught. Okay.
00:51:53.765 - 00:52:41.395, Speaker A: V1 join K1 and then you have wedge all the way to the last summand. I'll write it here. That's a link in km minus 1 of VM join KN. So I think this is a really nice decomposition of this substitution complexes and ssl Like I was using it to determine some y hat products and things like that in the homotopy theory of poly products. I'll stop here. Thank you. Thank you.
