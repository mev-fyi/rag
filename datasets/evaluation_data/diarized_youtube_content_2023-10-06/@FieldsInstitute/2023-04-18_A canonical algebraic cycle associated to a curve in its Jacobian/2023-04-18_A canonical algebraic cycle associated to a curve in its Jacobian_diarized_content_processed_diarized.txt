00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.658, Speaker A: Thank you very much for the invitation. Tieman. So yeah, so today I'm going to be talking about cycles on Jacobians. So I should say most of the talk today will be on joint work with Dean Bosonyo, wonder Lee and Daniel lit. And towards the end, I present some ongoing work, preliminary report on ongoing work with John Nellenberg, Adam Logan and Akshay Venkatesh.
00:00:25.806 - 00:00:26.162, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:26.218 - 00:00:35.922, Speaker A: So this talk is about curves, cycles and curves, cycles on jacobian. So let's start by giving ourselves a nice curve.
00:00:36.058 - 00:00:41.642, Speaker B: So let x be a nice is.
00:00:41.658 - 00:00:45.906, Speaker A: A technical term, smooth, projective, geometrically integral, everything you would want.
00:00:46.050 - 00:00:48.850, Speaker B: So nice curve over a field k.
00:00:49.002 - 00:00:57.048, Speaker A: For now, k can be anything and we want to embed the curve and it's jacobian. So let's give us a, give ourselves.
00:00:57.216 - 00:01:02.384, Speaker B: A point on the curve. So you can use this, use this.
00:01:02.424 - 00:01:09.284, Speaker A: Point to embed the curve inside a larger group variety, the Jacobian by the Arbol Jacobi map.
00:01:11.624 - 00:01:12.364, Speaker B: So.
00:01:14.184 - 00:01:24.596, Speaker A: To may time with what's going to come up later is you can think of the Jacobian intrinsically in terms of divisors and curves. So you look at, um.
00:01:24.780 - 00:01:28.916, Speaker B: So these are zero dimensional sub varieties.
00:01:28.980 - 00:01:30.660, Speaker A: But we're going to look at degree.
00:01:30.692 - 00:01:39.104, Speaker B: Zero divisors modulo the subgroup of divisors of functions. So zeros and poles of functions.
00:01:40.804 - 00:01:41.188, Speaker C: Right?
00:01:41.236 - 00:01:43.340, Speaker A: And this map is simply given by.
00:01:43.372 - 00:01:47.826, Speaker B: Sending a point x to the formal.
00:01:47.850 - 00:01:52.834, Speaker A: Linear combination of points. So x minus the base point p. So this is a degree zero divisor.
00:01:52.874 - 00:01:55.054, Speaker B: We take its class and its quotient.
00:01:56.994 - 00:02:11.802, Speaker A: Okay, this is the Arbol Jacobi map. I want to talk about higher dimensional cycles on jacobian. So instead of looking at linear combinations of points which are dimension zero sub varieties, I'm going to be focusing on dimension one sub varieties on the Jacobian.
00:02:11.938 - 00:02:18.114, Speaker B: So z one of the Jacobian, this.
00:02:18.154 - 00:02:20.134, Speaker A: Is pre abelian group.
00:02:23.994 - 00:02:30.214, Speaker B: On one dimensional variety is on J.
00:02:32.834 - 00:02:44.064, Speaker A: And you can ask, are there any that you can write down right away? So I just told you about the Abel Jacobi map. So there's a copy of the curve inside the Jacobian.
00:02:44.924 - 00:02:50.372, Speaker B: So you have this, this is a.
00:02:50.388 - 00:02:59.460, Speaker A: One dimensional cycle, but I'm also allowed to take linear combinations. There's another one dimensional sub variety inside.
00:02:59.492 - 00:03:02.276, Speaker B: The Jacobian, namely you can take the.
00:03:02.300 - 00:03:13.066, Speaker A: Jacobian is a group, so it has a minus one operation on it. And this induces a minus one on sub variety. So you can just pull back the curve by minus one. That gives you another copy of the.
00:03:13.090 - 00:03:22.082, Speaker B: Curve inside the Jacobian. So you have minus one upper star ip of x and I'm going to.
00:03:22.098 - 00:03:35.454, Speaker A: Look at the difference. So this is the key player in today's talk, the Chirissa cycle. So this I'll denote.
00:03:37.814 - 00:03:41.886, Speaker B: Right now, depends on the base point p canonical cycle.
00:03:41.950 - 00:03:48.634, Speaker A: Associated to this curve together with the base point. So it's a one dimensional cycle on the Jacobian.
00:03:48.934 - 00:03:53.790, Speaker B: So just like our experience with points.
00:03:53.862 - 00:04:04.954, Speaker A: On curve suggests, we want to study cycles up to some natural equivalence relations. This group by itself is very big, right? So we want to look at natural subgroups inside this group.
00:04:05.774 - 00:04:11.950, Speaker B: So, so just like, just like with.
00:04:11.982 - 00:04:20.154, Speaker A: Zero dimensional sub varieties, you have the analog of the degree zero divisors. So you have the homologically trivial cycles.
00:04:22.454 - 00:04:23.274, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:04:29.554 - 00:04:47.130, Speaker A: So this is, this is the analog of degree zero. So if you're thinking about if your field embeds inside the complex numbers, this is really sub varieties which are the boundary of something one dimensional higher. But if you, if you want something that, if you want a definition that works over any field, you can think.
00:04:47.162 - 00:04:58.074, Speaker B: Of this as the kernel of the cycle class map. So you have, you have a map from.
00:05:01.614 - 00:05:06.318, Speaker A: Dimension one. Cycles are, I mean, you can also write this as co dimension g minus one cycle.
00:05:06.366 - 00:05:26.120, Speaker B: So you have the cycle class map to et alchemology. Sorry, getting ahead of myself. And the kernel of this kernel of.
00:05:26.152 - 00:05:43.764, Speaker A: This map is what are the homologically trivial cycles. So these are the analog of degree zero divisors. If you were to do this for points and curves, this is, you get back exactly this. And the analog of principle divisors are the rationally trivial.
00:05:47.884 - 00:05:50.772, Speaker B: There's a subgroup in here of cycles.
00:05:50.828 - 00:06:00.284, Speaker A: That can be, that are generated by differences of fibers of some map to p one.
00:06:00.324 - 00:06:19.394, Speaker B: So this rationally trivial cycle is this. So pre boolean group generated by differences of fibers. So, um, so you pick a two.
00:06:19.434 - 00:06:22.354, Speaker A: Dimensional sub variety inside j and say.
00:06:22.394 - 00:06:26.906, Speaker B: That this, this fibers and you pick.
00:06:26.930 - 00:06:28.410, Speaker A: A function on it, a rational function.
00:06:28.442 - 00:06:32.090, Speaker B: On it, and you identify the fiber.
00:06:32.122 - 00:06:33.698, Speaker A: Above zero and the fiber above infinity.
00:06:33.746 - 00:06:45.104, Speaker B: So it's like identifying zeros and poles. So this, this is, so this, the subgroup is generated by differences of fibers.
00:06:45.644 - 00:06:56.644, Speaker A: But there's potentially, in higher dimensions, there's potentially one more equivalence relation you might want to study. So you have, in between homologically trivial.
00:06:56.684 - 00:07:09.352, Speaker B: Cycles and rationally trivial cycles, you have the algebraically trivial cycles. So these, these look very much, they.
00:07:09.368 - 00:07:16.168, Speaker A: Have a very similar description to the rationally trivial cycles.
00:07:16.216 - 00:07:18.440, Speaker B: You just replace the p one by.
00:07:18.472 - 00:07:22.488, Speaker A: An arbitrary curve c. So cycles that can be deformed to each other along.
00:07:22.536 - 00:07:25.480, Speaker B: An algebraic curve, right?
00:07:25.632 - 00:07:36.926, Speaker A: So if you instead of studying one dimensional sub varieties. We're studying zero dimensional sub varieties. Any point can be on a curve. Any point can be deformed to any.
00:07:36.950 - 00:07:38.646, Speaker B: Other point, like right along the curve.
00:07:38.670 - 00:07:40.390, Speaker A: So these two, these two are the.
00:07:40.422 - 00:07:43.126, Speaker B: Same in the case of points and.
00:07:43.150 - 00:07:57.584, Speaker A: Curves, but potentially there are two different equivalence relations in higher dimensions. So the main question is, okay, here's this canonical cycle, here's this natural filtration.
00:07:58.804 - 00:08:08.372, Speaker B: This is natural filtration on cycles. You want to know how deep in.
00:08:08.388 - 00:08:11.164, Speaker A: This filtration does your canonical cycle lie?
00:08:11.324 - 00:08:24.528, Speaker B: Okay, so question. So I'm going to be a bit.
00:08:24.576 - 00:08:30.176, Speaker A: Sloppy and I'm going to start hiding the base points. Instead of carrying around all this notation.
00:08:30.240 - 00:08:33.200, Speaker B: I might, I might just call this.
00:08:33.272 - 00:08:46.444, Speaker A: X minus, a catchy way to remember what the Teresa cycle is. Say X minus X minus, where X minus is this other pullback of x by minus one. Secretly there's a base point, but.
00:08:48.404 - 00:08:48.716, Speaker C: For.
00:08:48.740 - 00:08:52.084, Speaker A: What we're going to say later, that won't matter. So we want to know how deep.
00:08:52.124 - 00:08:58.972, Speaker B: In this filtration does X minus X minus lie? Is it rationally trivial, is it homologically trivial?
00:08:59.028 - 00:08:59.804, Speaker C: And so on.
00:08:59.924 - 00:09:00.584, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:01.244 - 00:09:18.354, Speaker A: And you see right away one of the reasons why we chose to look at the difference of x and the pullback of x by minus one. This difference is chosen precisely, um, so that you get something homologically trivial.
00:09:20.894 - 00:09:28.838, Speaker B: Observe. Um, and why is this?
00:09:28.886 - 00:09:51.352, Speaker A: This is because how does minus one act on, uh, so how does minus one act on, uh, even dimensional homology? On the Jacobian, on each one it acts, each minus one induces multiplication by minus one. And this is the wedge power, right? So on even dimensional wedge powers, minus.
00:09:51.408 - 00:09:53.680, Speaker B: One induces the identity, right?
00:09:53.712 - 00:09:58.544, Speaker A: So if you push forward x and minus one upper star x along this map, you get the same thing.
00:09:58.704 - 00:10:03.324, Speaker B: So the difference is zero in homology.
00:10:10.804 - 00:10:11.244, Speaker C: Okay?
00:10:11.284 - 00:10:17.116, Speaker A: So it's already one step inside, inside this filtration. And you want to know, does it.
00:10:17.140 - 00:10:19.744, Speaker B: Lie deeper in this filtration?
00:10:21.204 - 00:10:28.708, Speaker A: So there's, yeah, so if you want to know if it's one step, one.
00:10:28.756 - 00:10:35.984, Speaker B: Step further in, you can, there's a group that studies the difference between homologically.
00:10:36.334 - 00:10:39.030, Speaker A: Trivial cycles and algebraically trivial cycles.
00:10:39.142 - 00:11:01.274, Speaker B: So what we're really asking is x minus x minus non trivial in the Griffith scope. So this is, this is the quotient of two successive terms in this filtration, homologically trivial cycles mod algebraically trivial cycles.
00:11:04.634 - 00:11:08.210, Speaker A: And this, in this quotient, I must.
00:11:08.242 - 00:11:11.322, Speaker B: Say that this is the reason I.
00:11:11.338 - 00:11:22.534, Speaker A: Can ignore the base point, these two cycles, if you remember for a second, you remember the choice of base point. Again, these two cycles are algebraically equivalent.
00:11:25.074 - 00:11:51.916, Speaker B: So in this quotient, you get the same element if you push on CxPM, CXp. So imagine the image of, oh, I.
00:11:51.940 - 00:12:22.590, Speaker A: Also forgot to say at the beginning, please feel free to stop me at any point and ask a question. If you type it in chat, I might not notice it. So just feel free to unmute and ask. So far, everything okay? I just defined this canonical cycle. So there are two copies of x in the Jacobian. Take the difference, take the difference, x minus x minus. It's a one dimensional, it lives in the free abelian group on one dimensional sub varieties in the Jacobian.
00:12:22.590 - 00:12:30.654, Speaker A: Um, this group has a natural filtration. Um, and we're trying to understand how deep in this filtration does this canonical cycle lie.
00:12:30.774 - 00:12:31.390, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:31.542 - 00:12:34.342, Speaker B: Um, I called, uh, I want to.
00:12:34.358 - 00:12:42.662, Speaker A: Tell you a little bit of history now, before I come back to the cycle, we want to understand the difference between homologically trivial cycles and algebraically trivial cycles.
00:12:42.798 - 00:12:46.734, Speaker B: Um, and this is, this group is.
00:12:46.774 - 00:12:58.594, Speaker A: Called the Griffiths group because Griffiths gave the first example that shows that these two, these two groups can be, these two subgroups can be different. The Griffiths group can be non trivial.
00:13:00.054 - 00:13:12.714, Speaker B: So some history Griffiths in 1969.
00:13:14.814 - 00:13:17.454, Speaker A: Showed that there are examples.
00:13:20.794 - 00:13:27.130, Speaker B: For instance, if you take the generic quintet in p four, the Griffiths group.
00:13:27.322 - 00:13:31.154, Speaker A: Of a generic quintic is non trivial. Actually, it has elements of infinite order.
00:13:31.234 - 00:13:33.618, Speaker B: It's not trivial after you, even after you dance it.
00:13:33.666 - 00:13:34.930, Speaker C: Q. Right.
00:13:34.962 - 00:13:40.774, Speaker A: So this is the first thing that says that in higher dimensions you actually have genuinely different equal installations.
00:13:42.704 - 00:13:43.444, Speaker B: And.
00:13:45.184 - 00:13:57.164, Speaker A: And in general, the Griffiths group, if you work over arbitrary fields. Now I pay a little more attention to the field in question. If you work over arbitrary fields, something like the complex numbers, the Griffiths group can be quite large.
00:14:02.584 - 00:14:03.324, Speaker C: But.
00:14:10.404 - 00:14:11.724, Speaker A: Not only is it not where.
00:14:11.764 - 00:14:14.852, Speaker B: You can, you can produce examples where.
00:14:14.908 - 00:14:26.860, Speaker A: This group is not even finitely generated. The analog to keep in mind, if you want to carry along this jacobian mind, it's like the set of complex points of a jacobian. Like, you know, that's a torus.
00:14:26.892 - 00:14:32.724, Speaker B: It's a pretty large group, but, yeah.
00:14:32.764 - 00:15:00.404, Speaker A: So there are examples due to Mumford and voisin. Even the torsion subgroup can be infinitely generated. Even the two torsion can be infinitely generated over an arbitrary field. But just like points in elliptic curves, we want to ask what happens if you restrict yourself to varieties defined over number fields and sub varieties? One dimensional sub varieties also defined over the number field. So there are conjectures.
00:15:00.564 - 00:15:11.368, Speaker B: So here's a number field. We have the Baywinson block injectors.
00:15:11.416 - 00:15:14.764, Speaker A: So you should think of this as a higher dimensional BSD.
00:15:18.304 - 00:15:28.572, Speaker B: So this is like higher dimension BSD. It says that the Griffiths group, so.
00:15:28.628 - 00:15:35.532, Speaker A: You restrict your variety, is defined over a number field, and you're looking at cycles also defined over a number field.
00:15:35.668 - 00:15:47.828, Speaker B: Then you get a finitely generated abelian group. So this is an analog of the model weight theorem.
00:15:47.956 - 00:15:53.292, Speaker A: It's a conjecture in higher dimensions. So it's actually pretty small once if.
00:15:53.308 - 00:15:57.498, Speaker B: You study cycles up to, up to these equivalence relations.
00:15:57.666 - 00:16:10.734, Speaker A: And just like the BST, I mean the rank of the model we group is controlled by an associated l function. Similarly here, these conjectures predict that the rank of the Griffiths group.
00:16:15.354 - 00:16:16.570, Speaker B: Is controlled.
00:16:16.682 - 00:16:25.154, Speaker A: By the order vanishing of an associated l function.
00:16:29.854 - 00:16:31.274, Speaker B: At its central point.
00:16:34.334 - 00:16:42.914, Speaker A: So here, the l function that you study is the l function associated to the Gaga representation.
00:16:45.494 - 00:16:47.294, Speaker B: A certain quotient of.
00:16:47.334 - 00:16:51.034, Speaker A: Not h, but h.
00:16:52.894 - 00:17:12.914, Speaker B: Sorry, there's something in chat or. No. Okay, sorry. Okay, so get my data on. So ignore this. So.
00:17:14.344 - 00:17:42.782, Speaker A: So, yeah, so when the field is small, when you're working over a number field, conjecturally, this Griffiths group is not very big. It's finitely generated and its rank is controlled. Controlled by a certain l function. And actually. Okay, so this is generality about cycles on Jacobians. But the Cherisher cycle, going back to the canonical cycle we defined before it, played a big role in the formulation of these conjectures. So let me.
00:17:42.782 - 00:17:44.034, Speaker A: Let me come back.
00:17:44.934 - 00:17:54.902, Speaker B: Let me come back to Cherissa cycles and continue with the history of the charissa cycle. So the reason this is called the.
00:17:54.918 - 00:18:04.158, Speaker A: Charissa cycle is Chirissa studied, studied this cycle and it's in his 1983 thesis. And he showed that for the universal.
00:18:04.206 - 00:18:04.874, Speaker B: Curve.
00:18:07.834 - 00:18:10.174, Speaker A: If there's like one curve, we want to understand.
00:18:12.314 - 00:18:14.546, Speaker B: The Teresa cycle about like.
00:18:14.650 - 00:18:18.774, Speaker A: Because most interesting curve is like the universal curve, arguably.
00:18:19.994 - 00:18:21.442, Speaker B: So universal curve over.
00:18:21.498 - 00:18:24.414, Speaker A: Over the function field of mg.
00:18:26.594 - 00:18:26.978, Speaker B: When.
00:18:27.026 - 00:18:28.290, Speaker A: G is at least three, you see.
00:18:28.322 - 00:18:46.782, Speaker B: Why in a few minutes has infinite order. And the Griffiths group. And so, and his main tool, just.
00:18:46.838 - 00:18:57.206, Speaker A: Like how we study devices and curves, our main tool is to use the Abu Jacobi map and use like integration to understand cycles. So he used. He used a version of the Abel.
00:18:57.230 - 00:19:01.878, Speaker B: Jacobi map, use hoch theory to show.
00:19:01.926 - 00:19:11.422, Speaker A: That universal curve over mg when g is at least three, the Teresa cycle is non trivial, actually has infinite order. So it's a non trivial element.
00:19:11.558 - 00:19:14.994, Speaker B: And the Griffith's group tensor q. Right?
00:19:16.214 - 00:19:30.506, Speaker A: But we are interested in curves over number fields. So we want to know what happens over small fields. So the first example of a curve over a number field which had infinite order, which had a non trivial Griffiths.
00:19:30.530 - 00:19:31.094, Speaker B: Group.
00:19:39.034 - 00:20:06.764, Speaker A: Even a curve of a q, he's the, he showed that for the Fermat quartic, its class, the associated charizard class is non trivial in the Griffiths group. And his argument was, again, to use a version of the Abel Jacobi map.
00:20:07.384 - 00:20:11.328, Speaker B: You can embed these one dimensional cycles.
00:20:11.376 - 00:20:33.132, Speaker A: In an intermediate jacobian. And what he ended up doing was doing a certain period calculation. And he showed that an explicit period integral was, was not an integer. He could compute this numerically and approximate.
00:20:33.188 - 00:20:36.820, Speaker B: It enough, let's say, okay, to few.
00:20:36.852 - 00:20:39.244, Speaker A: Digits precision, but just enough to see.
00:20:39.404 - 00:20:43.900, Speaker B: That this is, this, this period integral.
00:20:43.932 - 00:21:09.274, Speaker A: Was a non trivial element of r mod z. So the cycle, it's the image of the cycle under a certain homomorphism. So that shows that the original cycle is non trivial. But Theresa's original result was not just about non triviality of the Theresa cycle. He actually showed that the generic curve at infinite order Theresa cycle. So you can ask the same question about the Fermat curve.
00:21:09.434 - 00:21:14.074, Speaker B: And this, this is a result due to block.
00:21:14.194 - 00:21:26.254, Speaker A: And this, this is a really important example. Historically, this, this is the example that led to the formulation of the valence and block injectors. So he actually showed that the same curve for the firmaquatic.
00:21:29.994 - 00:21:32.334, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry.
00:21:36.994 - 00:21:42.664, Speaker B: X minus, x minus has infinite daughter in the Griffiths group.
00:21:43.004 - 00:21:43.436, Speaker C: So.
00:21:43.500 - 00:21:47.948, Speaker B: Yeah, Griffiths group of the Jokows and key.
00:21:47.996 - 00:22:08.550, Speaker A: For this, he used his, his computation was in hodge theory. He used an eladic version of the Zabal Jacobi map. And it was important that this, this permaquartic is rather special. You, he was able to show that this was an element of infinite order in the Griffiths group.
00:22:08.702 - 00:22:11.510, Speaker B: So if you believe there's an l.
00:22:11.542 - 00:22:34.292, Speaker A: Function side of the story, it means the associated l function should vanish to order at least one at the central point. And he was actually able to compute both sides of this conjecture. So the Jacobian of the firmaquatic decomposes is a product of three elliptic curves, all cm elliptic curves. So he was able to explicitly compute the central value and show that it vanished.
00:22:34.388 - 00:22:34.644, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:34.684 - 00:22:58.356, Speaker A: So this, this is, this is actually a very funny paper, if you go look at it after these calculations in the introduction, he says, okay, this example makes me believe, upgrade my idle speculation to a recurring fantasy. He, of course, doesn't call it the balance of conjectures, but he calls it a recurring fantasy. But, yeah, so this this. Historically, the cheddar cycle of the Fermat.
00:22:58.380 - 00:23:01.648, Speaker B: Curve has played an important role in.
00:23:01.656 - 00:23:30.576, Speaker A: The formulation of these high dimensional BSD like conjectures since now. Now there are other proofs of block's original result. So there's a version using Piare carbon Jacobi maps. So this is due to Bertolini. There are a lot of names that I need to cite. Some of them, I'm just going to say, verbally save myself some time. So, the results of Bertolini, Dalmon and Prsenna, the reproof blocks results using a PRD Kabul Jacobi map.
00:23:30.576 - 00:24:16.248, Speaker A: And it ended up translating to showing a certain periodic special value. L value was non zero mod p. The big tools in understanding cycles is to use these Abu Jacobi maps. So there's a periodic proof of this result, too. And this is the first among many examples. So, once you study the pharmacotech, it's very natural to ask, what about other pharmacists? So I should cite here result of payment and Kumar Murthy. They showed that the Fermat curve of degree p, where p is at least seven, has infinite order, and it's non trivial mod, and not in the Griffiths group.
00:24:16.248 - 00:24:39.560, Speaker A: But if you study cycles mod rational equivalence, they were able to show that the Chirisa cycle had infinite order. Combine this with results of number theoretic results about points on the Jacobian of Fermat curves. Some of these ideas were, like, instrumental or inspirational for some of the work I might mention at the end, ongoing work I might mention at the end.
00:24:39.592 - 00:24:41.656, Speaker B: So let's give that for now.
00:24:41.840 - 00:24:54.074, Speaker A: So, yeah, there are lots of examples now, but mostly the curves that we understand are like these very special curves, curves that Cm Jacobians and so on, where we really use the fact that we understand the Jacobians of these curves very well.
00:24:54.224 - 00:24:54.558, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:54.606 - 00:25:00.594, Speaker A: So, okay, so that's all about. Okay, so, yes, here's the spectrum of examples we know.
00:25:01.334 - 00:25:03.994, Speaker B: So if you want. So.
00:25:05.774 - 00:25:19.440, Speaker A: The question is seresus cycle torsion or not torsion. And for examples with infinite order, we have Theresa's original result.
00:25:19.582 - 00:25:20.692, Speaker B: Oops, sorry.
00:25:20.828 - 00:25:24.668, Speaker A: We have the generic curve, which is a curve over this large field.
00:25:24.716 - 00:25:28.868, Speaker B: And then we have Fermat curves and.
00:25:28.956 - 00:25:30.224, Speaker A: Also their quotients.
00:25:32.364 - 00:25:33.156, Speaker B: I think lots of.
00:25:33.180 - 00:25:58.514, Speaker A: Other names I should be mentioning here. You should look at this wonderful survey written by Payman and Kumar Murthy. So they cite the entire history of this problem, and, like, what's the extent of our knowledge of examples of curves with infinite order? Chirissa. But at the other end, you can ask other examples where we know the Seresa cycle is torsion. Are there any examples we know?
00:25:59.734 - 00:26:00.406, Speaker C: Yes.
00:26:00.550 - 00:26:01.634, Speaker A: Another question.
00:26:05.974 - 00:26:15.414, Speaker B: Are there known examples of curves x with x minus x minus torsion?
00:26:16.474 - 00:26:17.974, Speaker C: And the Griffin scope?
00:26:20.274 - 00:26:20.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:21.154 - 00:26:36.026, Speaker A: And so, if you remember, when I cited Teresa's result, I said gene is at least three. That's actually essential, because we do know examples where there is astorian, and it's this. If you look at the class of.
00:26:36.050 - 00:26:37.414, Speaker B: Hyper elliptic curves.
00:26:39.854 - 00:26:43.558, Speaker A: And you choose your p to be a wire stress point.
00:26:43.726 - 00:26:47.126, Speaker B: You can actually see that the chin.
00:26:47.150 - 00:26:59.350, Speaker A: Is a cycle zero on the nose. And the reason is the minus one involution on the Jacobian doesn't come out of nowhere. It's induced by the hyper elliptic involution on the curve.
00:26:59.382 - 00:27:01.754, Speaker B: So there's this. Nice diagram.
00:27:05.154 - 00:27:05.974, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:27:10.914 - 00:27:21.178, Speaker A: Hyperliptic involution induces minus one. So if you pull back the pull back by minus one, it's the same thing as looking at its image under the hyper elliptic evolution.
00:27:21.226 - 00:27:38.862, Speaker B: So x minus actually equals x, x minus x minus is zero. So of course it's a cycle of.
00:27:38.878 - 00:27:51.942, Speaker A: A hyperliptic curve is trivial. So this is a known class of examples with torsion seresa, even zero seresa. So you can ask, are these the only examples that we can make? So, folklore conjecture.
00:27:52.118 - 00:27:55.634, Speaker B: Don't see this written anywhere, but this.
00:27:57.464 - 00:28:01.280, Speaker A: This was asked the math overflow question.
00:28:01.392 - 00:28:04.896, Speaker B: By John Mendelberg and what we sought.
00:28:04.920 - 00:28:08.044, Speaker A: Out to study in this MRC in 2019.
00:28:12.064 - 00:28:14.004, Speaker B: It basically asked if.
00:28:16.744 - 00:28:30.982, Speaker A: The only torsion examples we know, are they necessarily hyperliptic curves? Okay, so you can, of course you can say torsion. You can decide where you want to study torsion, like in the Griffiths group.
00:28:31.038 - 00:28:33.114, Speaker B: Or the ChA group, so on.
00:28:33.494 - 00:28:49.554, Speaker A: So what we actually studied was a certain variant of this. So, cycles themselves are hard, but cycle classes are easier to study. So instead of answering this, here's a variant.
00:28:51.534 - 00:28:53.154, Speaker B: Um, so.
00:28:55.494 - 00:28:57.034, Speaker A: I already introduced.
00:29:01.614 - 00:29:02.510, Speaker B: So this is.
00:29:02.582 - 00:29:09.238, Speaker A: So the chao group is the quotient of, of cycles, more rationally trivial cycles.
00:29:09.286 - 00:29:15.906, Speaker B: So this and the, the map to.
00:29:15.930 - 00:29:43.628, Speaker A: Commodity factors via this quotient. And here, now I'm going to secretly change coefficients to QL, because this interesting trojan phenomena. So, one way to study cycles is to use is that, I mean, this is hard, but you can try to understand their images under this Appalachia cobie map. But if you did this for the Chirisa cycle, you're not going to get anything interesting. I said the Teresa cycle is homologically trivial.
00:29:43.676 - 00:29:51.612, Speaker B: It lives in the kernel of this map. So x minus X minus, if you.
00:29:51.628 - 00:29:55.460, Speaker A: Chase, it goes to zero here. So I can't use the Abel Jacobi.
00:29:55.492 - 00:29:57.628, Speaker B: Map to study the charisa cycle, but.
00:29:57.636 - 00:30:02.676, Speaker A: There'S a refined Arbol Jacobi map that's defined on these homologically trivial cycles.
00:30:02.860 - 00:30:05.596, Speaker B: So you can use the fact that.
00:30:05.620 - 00:30:24.634, Speaker A: X minus X minus is defined over with the ground field. The same field where X is defined lets you define a refined Abel Jacobi map. So this lands, okay, now you see the h. So you have to chase some spectral sequences around and you get.
00:30:25.534 - 00:30:36.226, Speaker B: A class and h one gk h. So this, this is what I call.
00:30:36.250 - 00:30:37.414, Speaker A: The Teresa class.
00:30:39.514 - 00:30:41.306, Speaker B: For the universal curve.
00:30:41.490 - 00:30:44.494, Speaker A: This is related to the Johnson homomorphism.
00:30:46.514 - 00:30:49.730, Speaker B: In, yeah, in low dimension topology.
00:30:49.802 - 00:31:11.972, Speaker A: So I going to denote the image of X minus X minus the Johnson class of X. And this, okay, so even though this composition is zero, this, this map is not always trivial. So you can try to understand the Chirissa cycle by studying its image. And you can ask the variant question.
00:31:12.028 - 00:31:13.824, Speaker B: You can ask is.
00:31:18.204 - 00:31:18.748, Speaker C: I think this.
00:31:18.756 - 00:31:23.884, Speaker A: Is an even stronger question if you know that the Johnson class of X is trivial.
00:31:24.044 - 00:31:27.064, Speaker B: Does this mean x is hyperliptic?
00:31:29.414 - 00:31:30.182, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:30.318 - 00:31:34.834, Speaker A: And so this is the first theorem I want to present today.
00:31:35.854 - 00:31:49.234, Speaker B: So this is, this is joint work with Dean Boisagno, Juan Ali, Daniel lit. The answer is no. There are non hyperliptic curves with.
00:31:51.054 - 00:32:00.168, Speaker A: Torsion Johnson class. And here we produce an explicit example by construction.
00:32:00.216 - 00:32:02.232, Speaker B: So the curve that we produce is.
00:32:02.248 - 00:32:23.044, Speaker A: The frick and Macbeth curve. It has, it's an important enough curve. It gets its own Wikipedia page. It's a genus seven Horwitz curve. So this means this has a very large automorphism group the size of its automorphisms. The automorphism group is psl two, f eight.
00:32:24.314 - 00:32:27.162, Speaker B: The size of the automorphism group is.
00:32:27.218 - 00:32:38.934, Speaker A: 84, g minus one. So 84 seven minus 1504. And we really use the automorphisms in a crucial way in our argument. So we showed that the Johnson class.
00:32:40.834 - 00:32:42.930, Speaker B: Of x is torsion.
00:32:42.962 - 00:32:47.334, Speaker A: If you use DL coefficients, if you use QL coefficients, it's actually trivial.
00:32:48.414 - 00:32:49.274, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:51.334 - 00:33:16.094, Speaker A: And since we showed this result, you can ask, does this give you a candidate example where the associated cycle itself is torsion? And very recently, as of last year, this was upgraded by Song Ling Shu and Beijing preprint on the archive.
00:33:17.914 - 00:33:23.774, Speaker B: To x minus x minus being torsion. And the chao group.
00:33:26.034 - 00:33:44.250, Speaker A: And the criterion they use, they produce a whole, they also use the automorphisms of the curve in a crucial way. And the criterion that they use is actually very similar to the same criterion that shows up in our argument. But they are able to soup that.
00:33:44.282 - 00:33:47.058, Speaker B: Up and show that they're actually says.
00:33:47.106 - 00:34:39.483, Speaker A: The cycle is torsion in the chow group. And there have also been other examples after we posted our curve, like the, I'm blanking on names right now, but somebody, the Netherlands spotted example and realized that this is actually a curve that was studied by Chad Schoen back in the eighties. And it's the same example that he produced to show, uh, um, the non hypothermia locus. He couldn't. So we then reached out to Sean, but he couldn't remember. He couldn't remember the example written down. And later on, like Boville and Schon wrote an example to get, wrote a joint paper, they rediscovered this example, rediscovered another example with torsion, cherese like.
00:34:39.483 - 00:35:05.614, Speaker A: So it was a curve which also had extra automorphisms. And Boville's argument was later made into an algorithm by Lillian Felden Schneiderman. And they were also able to produce some more examples of curves with torsion. Teresa. Every single example we know with torsion Teresa class, all of them are examples which have extra automorphism. So a big question, open question. Yes.
00:35:05.954 - 00:35:12.334, Speaker D: So when you say torsion in the chat group, all of this, this is, this is not modular rational equivalence, is it?
00:35:13.074 - 00:35:15.174, Speaker A: It is not rational equivalent.
00:35:16.034 - 00:35:21.882, Speaker D: I see, so this, I see so, but the example of Boville and show, and that one is, I think, modular.
00:35:21.938 - 00:35:26.258, Speaker A: Algebraic equivalent, even modular algebraic equivalents. Yeah, they show something even stronger.
00:35:26.346 - 00:35:26.826, Speaker B: Yes.
00:35:26.930 - 00:35:29.682, Speaker A: But Beijing and Kong Ling Shu's examples.
00:35:29.738 - 00:35:33.106, Speaker B: Are all about torsion and chow torsion.
00:35:33.130 - 00:35:34.738, Speaker D: In chao would be stronger than Tozin.
00:35:34.786 - 00:35:36.726, Speaker A: Which way? Okay, I was saying this backwards.
00:35:36.850 - 00:35:37.582, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:37.758 - 00:35:41.390, Speaker A: Yes. Torsion and chaos is some multiple, even smaller subgroup.
00:35:41.422 - 00:35:41.838, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry.
00:35:41.886 - 00:35:42.754, Speaker A: Totally right.
00:35:43.134 - 00:35:43.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:44.494 - 00:35:52.190, Speaker D: So non hyper elliptic examples that actually have their seresus cycle is torsion in the chow group.
00:35:52.342 - 00:35:54.110, Speaker B: Yes, yes. Okay.
00:35:54.182 - 00:35:54.902, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:35:55.038 - 00:35:55.714, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:57.174 - 00:35:57.726, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:57.830 - 00:35:59.614, Speaker A: So, thank you.
00:35:59.774 - 00:36:05.030, Speaker B: Thanks for the correction. Um, so, yeah, so all of these.
00:36:05.062 - 00:36:24.878, Speaker A: Examples, I must say, like these have all come up in the last two, three years. All of them really use the fact that the curves have extra automorphisms in a crucial way. And it's, um, this, there's this old question of Clements, which is to understand this locus of curves which have, which have torsion class.
00:36:24.926 - 00:36:27.554, Speaker B: So understand, characterize.
00:36:31.514 - 00:36:44.334, Speaker A: The locus in Mg where x minus, x minus is trivial, say algebraically trivial, rationally trivial. For instance, are there any automorphism free curves in this locus?
00:37:00.094 - 00:37:05.434, Speaker B: So until they, like, we don't know any examples. Right.
00:37:06.534 - 00:37:16.114, Speaker A: Okay, so that's my history of examples. I want to switch to giving outlining a proof of this theorem that I just stated.
00:37:20.274 - 00:37:34.534, Speaker B: This theorem about the freaking Macbeth curve. So let me remind you what our goal is. So we want to show.
00:37:36.274 - 00:37:36.770, Speaker C: That the.
00:37:36.802 - 00:37:40.442, Speaker B: Johnson class of this freckle McWheed curve.
00:37:40.498 - 00:37:48.234, Speaker A: This chair is a class, is trivial. So the first question.
00:37:54.534 - 00:37:55.198, Speaker C: Is, how do.
00:37:55.206 - 00:37:59.238, Speaker A: We concretely understand this Abel Jacobi image?
00:37:59.406 - 00:37:59.902, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:59.998 - 00:38:02.166, Speaker A: So the proof is in three steps.
00:38:02.190 - 00:38:05.398, Speaker B: So you can, first, you can concretely.
00:38:05.446 - 00:38:10.334, Speaker A: Understand what this Abu Jacobi image is using the fundamental group of the curve.
00:38:10.414 - 00:38:14.376, Speaker B: So we're going to reformulate what the.
00:38:14.400 - 00:38:21.484, Speaker A: Johnson class is using the fundamental group of X.
00:38:23.024 - 00:38:27.664, Speaker B: So this, this is using an Elliott.
00:38:27.704 - 00:38:31.924, Speaker A: Version of this theorem and hox theory by Harrison Pulte.
00:38:39.644 - 00:38:47.020, Speaker B: This by Henan Matsumoto. This interpretation of the refined Abu Jacobi.
00:38:47.052 - 00:38:53.588, Speaker A: Image using fundamental groups. So let me introduce the fundamental group. So we're going to study the grouping.
00:38:53.676 - 00:38:58.412, Speaker B: Of ellaritic grouping associated to the fundamental group.
00:38:58.508 - 00:39:02.864, Speaker A: So you can think of this as the definition is an inverse limit.
00:39:04.324 - 00:39:09.024, Speaker B: Overall, finite quotients of the grouping.
00:39:12.284 - 00:39:27.612, Speaker A: Grouping of all finite quotients of the fundamental group. You can also think about this concretely. If you pick a presentation of PI, you can think of this ring as a non commutative power series ring in.
00:39:27.628 - 00:39:41.532, Speaker B: 2G variables, modulo one relation. So these xi's are like gi minus one. So the product of commutators is one, right?
00:39:41.628 - 00:39:45.784, Speaker A: So this is a group ring. And group rings come with augmentation ideals.
00:39:47.644 - 00:40:00.564, Speaker B: So you have inside here the augmentation ideal. So you can, it's an ideal. You can also take a talk about its square, it's cube and so on, right?
00:40:00.944 - 00:40:06.920, Speaker A: So this, this sequence of ideals gives rise to a sequence of Galva modules.
00:40:07.032 - 00:40:10.724, Speaker B: So you study I mod, I cubed.
00:40:11.144 - 00:40:14.104, Speaker A: This emits a subjection onto I mod.
00:40:14.144 - 00:40:19.376, Speaker B: I squared, and the kernel is I squared mod I cubed.
00:40:19.560 - 00:40:22.820, Speaker A: So this is a sequence of three vl modules.
00:40:22.972 - 00:40:23.664, Speaker C: And.
00:40:28.484 - 00:40:30.572, Speaker B: So, okay, for a minute it.
00:40:30.588 - 00:40:44.980, Speaker A: Might look like I made things more complicated, but we really understand the objects on the left and the right pretty well, right? I mod I squared, just like with group ranks, this is the first homology. This is dual to the tape module of the curve and I squared mod I cubed.
00:40:45.092 - 00:40:49.284, Speaker B: It's a quotient, h one times the squared.
00:40:49.824 - 00:41:02.104, Speaker A: So this, the both of these objects on the left and right are real modules we understand pretty well. And what we want to understand is the failure of the sequence. This is a sequence of modules which have a Galva action.
00:41:02.184 - 00:41:05.016, Speaker B: All these terms, the fundamental group, this.
00:41:05.040 - 00:41:11.456, Speaker A: Is the geometric fundamental group. So it comes with the Galva action. And what we want to understand is the failure for the sequence of groups.
00:41:11.480 - 00:41:28.944, Speaker B: To split Galva equivariantly. So the failure, call the sequence star Galva equivariant fee.
00:41:30.324 - 00:41:47.262, Speaker A: This is going to be a class that lives. You pick your favorite, this sequence of free ZL modules. So you can definitely pick a Zl splitting and you can measure its failure to be Galva covariant, right? So if you write this, write down a co cycle explicitly, you're going to.
00:41:47.278 - 00:41:51.470, Speaker B: Get a Galva co cycle that's valued in.
00:41:51.582 - 00:42:00.574, Speaker A: If you, if you take an element here, compare the section, apply, apply an element of the Galva group as g minus G's, you're going to get an element in this subgroup.
00:42:00.734 - 00:42:04.030, Speaker B: So you get an element in h.
00:42:04.062 - 00:42:06.054, Speaker A: One g k I mod I squared.
00:42:06.094 - 00:42:08.206, Speaker B: I squared mod I cubed, right?
00:42:08.310 - 00:42:20.990, Speaker A: So this specific course, this, this specific galvey class, this, the ellatic Harris Poulte theorem, matches up this class with the.
00:42:21.022 - 00:42:25.182, Speaker B: Johnson class of X. I mean, okay.
00:42:25.278 - 00:42:58.734, Speaker A: You have to reduce coefficients a bit more. Like earlier you had something in wedge two g minus three of h one. This class here actually lives in a certain subgroup. So you can play, play games. But essentially this, this extension of Galva modules constructed out of the fundamental group captures the Galva, captures the Johnson class. So that's the first step, reinterpretation of the Johnson class using fundamental groups. And so far, okay, this works for any curve.
00:42:58.734 - 00:43:10.260, Speaker A: It doesn't need to be a curve with extra automorphisms. But now is when we remember the fact that a freakimic beat curve comes with lots of automorphism. So what do automorphisms by you, you.
00:43:10.292 - 00:43:14.012, Speaker B: Can, you can actually restrict, show that.
00:43:14.028 - 00:43:15.868, Speaker A: The Johnson class lives in an even.
00:43:15.916 - 00:43:19.180, Speaker B: Smaller subgroup if your curve has extra.
00:43:19.212 - 00:43:20.064, Speaker A: Automotive.
00:43:22.444 - 00:43:25.020, Speaker C: Using Mod X.
00:43:25.172 - 00:43:31.276, Speaker A: So instead of looking at all homomorphisms between I mod I squared and I squared mod I cubed, you can look.
00:43:31.300 - 00:43:35.232, Speaker B: At homomorphisms that preserve that commute with.
00:43:35.248 - 00:43:41.928, Speaker A: The automorphisms of the curve. So this tells you that the Johnson class actually lives in the odd invariant.
00:43:41.976 - 00:43:45.256, Speaker B: Part of the sub module.
00:43:45.400 - 00:43:53.404, Speaker A: And what we actually end up showing, we don't directly show that the Johnson class is trivial. We show that the group that it lives in is trivial.
00:43:54.224 - 00:43:55.324, Speaker B: So we show.
00:44:00.284 - 00:44:06.804, Speaker A: That this subgroup here has no odd invariance. So the group that the Johnson class lives in is trivial.
00:44:06.844 - 00:44:08.780, Speaker B: So the Johnson class itself is trivial.
00:44:08.932 - 00:44:32.632, Speaker A: So this is the strategy. As a warm up, I'm going to redo the example of hyperliptic curves that has the main idea. So we want, we want, we want.
00:44:32.648 - 00:44:46.280, Speaker B: To implement the strategy for hyper elliptic curves. So hyperliptic curves always have at least.
00:44:46.312 - 00:44:51.092, Speaker A: A z mod two in their automorphism group.
00:44:51.148 - 00:44:54.148, Speaker B: So there's the hyperliptic involution tau.
00:44:54.276 - 00:45:04.504, Speaker A: And we're going to understand all these Galva modules up here. We're going to understand how the hyperliptic evolution acts on each of these.
00:45:09.244 - 00:45:12.412, Speaker B: I've actually said enough to ask you.
00:45:12.428 - 00:45:14.744, Speaker A: All to help me with this computation.
00:45:14.924 - 00:45:22.576, Speaker B: So, um, so I already said that I mod I squared is dual to the tape module.
00:45:22.720 - 00:45:31.728, Speaker A: So you can ask, okay, you have these three Zl modules tensor up with Ql, and you can ask what are, what eigenvalues for this evolution show up, right?
00:45:31.776 - 00:45:34.244, Speaker B: So in, in general.
00:45:37.344 - 00:45:41.844, Speaker A: How many, what are the eigenvalues for an evolution on a vector space?
00:45:46.584 - 00:45:48.964, Speaker B: We actually wait every document too long.
00:45:53.264 - 00:46:21.044, Speaker A: Either plus one or minus one, right? Those are the only eigenvalues that can show up. But this is not any old module. This is dual to the tape module. And I already do a diagram at the beginning tell you that the hyper elliptic involution induces minus one on the jacobian, right? So this is a module where all the eigenvalues are minus one. So tau acts identically as minus one on the module on the right.
00:46:21.544 - 00:46:23.760, Speaker B: The module on the left here is.
00:46:23.792 - 00:46:29.216, Speaker A: A quotient of each one tensor squared. So if you understand the eigenvalues on.
00:46:29.240 - 00:46:33.036, Speaker B: This side, you get all plus ones, right?
00:46:33.100 - 00:46:42.636, Speaker A: So now, so, so the fact that this module here, this home equivariant homomorphisms between I mod I squared and I square mod I cubed is trivial, is.
00:46:42.660 - 00:46:46.916, Speaker B: Just, is the fact that there, there can be no, there can be no.
00:46:46.940 - 00:46:50.980, Speaker A: Maps from a minus one eigenspace to a plus equivariant map from a minus.
00:46:51.012 - 00:46:54.024, Speaker B: One eigenspace, from a plus to a plus one eigenspace.
00:47:00.344 - 00:47:22.472, Speaker A: So the idea, so the main strategy here is to understand, you know, you don't have to understand this exact sequence in full at all. You just use minimal information. Try to understand the homology, the tape module as a module for the automorphisms of the curve. Try to understand its decomposition as an odd module, and then compare what isotypic pieces show up on the two sides.
00:47:22.488 - 00:47:25.762, Speaker B: So this, this, the argument for the.
00:47:25.778 - 00:47:27.574, Speaker A: Free curve is no different.
00:47:29.074 - 00:47:36.574, Speaker B: You just decompose, you decompose.
00:47:38.274 - 00:47:38.770, Speaker C: I mod.
00:47:38.802 - 00:47:40.530, Speaker A: I squared, I squared, mod I cubed.
00:47:40.562 - 00:47:43.042, Speaker B: So this is basically h one, and.
00:47:43.058 - 00:47:47.978, Speaker A: This is a quotient. We actually decompose h 110 squared as psl two, f eight.
00:47:48.026 - 00:47:51.350, Speaker B: This is the automorphism group modules.
00:47:51.382 - 00:47:54.234, Speaker A: And you see they share no common pieces.
00:48:02.374 - 00:48:08.646, Speaker B: So that, that's the argument. And so, in Xu and Zhang's work.
00:48:08.710 - 00:48:17.026, Speaker A: The criterion that they write down is basically exactly the same. Their criterion for triviality in chow is.
00:48:17.090 - 00:48:20.894, Speaker B: Each one tensor cubed has no odd invariance.
00:48:22.794 - 00:48:28.054, Speaker A: And they also, I mean, this is not a necessary condition. They produce, produce examples.
00:48:30.034 - 00:48:32.934, Speaker B: Where, I mean.
00:48:33.554 - 00:48:40.290, Speaker A: Where there are non trivial elements in here, but the, there is a class is still trivial. But, I mean, having automorphisms in general helps you.
00:48:40.402 - 00:48:40.698, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:40.746 - 00:48:44.086, Speaker B: So, all right, so, okay, that's, that's.
00:48:44.110 - 00:49:19.944, Speaker A: All I had to say about producing examples with Torres and Theresa class. So, the key tool here is understanding, using this reinterpretation of the Johnson class in terms of this sequence of gala modules and trying to understand how these decompose as odd modules. You can go back to the original question. Instead of asking for curves with torsion, Teresa, you can ask back to examples.
00:49:21.924 - 00:49:23.064, Speaker B: Another question.
00:49:23.804 - 00:49:40.254, Speaker A: So, all the examples we knew with infinite order, Theresa class, they were all examples of very special curves, like fermat curves and quartets. Fermat curves and the quotients of Fermat curves, right? So you can ask.
00:49:43.314 - 00:49:46.146, Speaker C: Given an arbitrary.
00:49:46.210 - 00:49:46.894, Speaker B: Curve.
00:49:51.554 - 00:49:53.294, Speaker A: X over a number field.
00:49:55.394 - 00:49:55.706, Speaker C: Is.
00:49:55.730 - 00:49:57.134, Speaker A: There an algorithm.
00:50:00.754 - 00:50:02.094, Speaker B: That certifies.
00:50:07.164 - 00:50:07.652, Speaker C: That the.
00:50:07.668 - 00:50:09.584, Speaker A: Chair is a class, is infinite order.
00:50:14.404 - 00:50:18.252, Speaker B: So, given that the generic curve has.
00:50:18.308 - 00:50:35.294, Speaker A: Infinite order, here is a class, you would expect that, like most equations that you write down at random, you should, you should land on a curve that has infinite order as a class. But so far, the only ones that we've been able to provably certify have infinite order, all these very special curves from our curves and quotients.
00:50:35.334 - 00:50:36.078, Speaker B: So this.
00:50:36.246 - 00:50:40.982, Speaker A: So, from this point of view, this is like a very natural question. So, the last thing that I want.
00:50:40.998 - 00:50:45.034, Speaker B: To present is work in progress that.
00:50:48.614 - 00:50:55.164, Speaker A: Does produce many new examples. If you see, like, I have the wrong version of my top notes here, which I was looking for.
00:50:55.294 - 00:50:57.968, Speaker B: Um, so we produce, um.
00:50:58.016 - 00:51:00.444, Speaker A: So this is joint work with John Nellenberg.
00:51:02.424 - 00:51:08.592, Speaker B: Adam Logan and Akshay Venkatesh. We produce.
00:51:08.728 - 00:51:09.872, Speaker A: In my talk, I say that I.
00:51:09.888 - 00:51:10.444, Speaker C: Like.
00:51:12.144 - 00:51:13.336, Speaker B: I don't have the numbers here.
00:51:13.360 - 00:51:21.924, Speaker A: But something like 200,020. Yeah, 200,000 examples of smooth plane cortex.
00:51:24.984 - 00:51:34.488, Speaker B: New examples with infinite order, shares the class. And it's better.
00:51:34.536 - 00:51:47.360, Speaker A: I mean, the image under this elad Kabul Jacobi map and what we give is actually an algorithm that when you input all. So we ran the algorithm on smooth.
00:51:47.392 - 00:51:54.600, Speaker B: Plane cortex of low height, of height one. So, coefficients write down all smooth plane.
00:51:54.632 - 00:52:01.964, Speaker A: Quartets with coefficients and minus 10, plus one, we run our algorithm on this, and our algorithm failed to certify.
00:52:07.304 - 00:52:07.592, Speaker B: The.
00:52:07.608 - 00:52:28.304, Speaker A: Cherisher class at infinite order. And only 102 examples of this list and all the examples we found. It had some of the known examples with torsion Teresa. And there are others that look like they might potentially be new, but we haven't examined them yet. So, let me just say what.
00:52:30.084 - 00:52:30.756, Speaker B: How this.
00:52:30.820 - 00:52:48.514, Speaker A: How this certificate works. So, there are two steps. So, what we produce is, first, an explicit upper bound. So you ask, okay, if the charissa class is torsion, you ask, okay, how. How large can the torsion order be?
00:52:48.634 - 00:52:48.914, Speaker C: Right?
00:52:48.954 - 00:52:49.818, Speaker A: So, first.
00:52:49.946 - 00:52:51.826, Speaker B: So, yeah, our input is x a.
00:52:51.850 - 00:52:57.454, Speaker A: Curve over a number field. We show that there is an explicit, computable upper bound.
00:53:05.154 - 00:53:10.974, Speaker B: I call it n, on the order of this Johnson class.
00:53:11.504 - 00:53:12.244, Speaker C: If.
00:53:13.384 - 00:53:14.872, Speaker B: If it is trivial.
00:53:15.048 - 00:53:37.244, Speaker A: Sorry, if it is torsion. And the key idea here is, again, instead of studying the Johnson class directly, we study the group in which it lives. So, if h one gk, this module m has. Has torsion. That torsion must come from. Gal will fix elements in.
00:53:39.254 - 00:53:41.046, Speaker B: So, if this l, torsion.
00:53:41.190 - 00:53:41.874, Speaker C: If.
00:53:47.414 - 00:53:51.434, Speaker B: Sorry, if. Sorry. If l divides.
00:53:53.614 - 00:53:54.430, Speaker C: The order of this.
00:53:54.462 - 00:54:18.634, Speaker A: Module, then this means that the Galva action on m mod lm is small. So you use the exact sequence for like, multiplication by Microsoft. You show that torsion in this module comes from invariance on m mod lm. And you can figure out. You can figure out, like when. You can figure out exactly when this happens, for which. Which l.
00:54:18.634 - 00:54:27.698, Speaker A: This happens finitely many l, right? So you can compute explicitly an upper bound on the torsion order, but you.
00:54:27.706 - 00:54:29.466, Speaker B: Can also produce lower bounds on the.
00:54:29.490 - 00:54:30.774, Speaker A: Order of the Johnson class.
00:54:30.914 - 00:54:33.554, Speaker B: So combine this. There is a.
00:54:41.454 - 00:54:44.634, Speaker A: Low bound on the order.
00:54:46.334 - 00:54:47.914, Speaker B: Of the Johnson class.
00:54:48.454 - 00:54:58.888, Speaker A: Now, you can restrict the Johnson class to the decomposition. It's a Galva homology class. In h one gk, you restrict it to the decomposition group at a good prime.
00:54:59.016 - 00:55:03.044, Speaker B: So here, this is decomposition group.
00:55:05.384 - 00:55:05.672, Speaker C: At.
00:55:05.688 - 00:55:28.884, Speaker A: A good prime, you can bound the order of the restriction to this decomposition group. And the way we do this is to use these homomorphic. You can play games with exact sequences of modules and associated homomorphism. So the reason the Johnson class itself is hard, we understand.
00:55:30.344 - 00:55:32.604, Speaker B: Sorry, let me scroll back up a little bit.
00:55:34.504 - 00:55:38.576, Speaker A: So, we understand this module pretty well, but I squared mod I cubed can.
00:55:38.600 - 00:55:40.524, Speaker B: Be pretty big, right?
00:55:40.824 - 00:56:18.340, Speaker A: So it's a large Galva module to work with. So what we do is we simplify this Galva module, uh, using cycle classes that show up when you reduce mod p. So, in general. So the general strategy. I think that one thing that's important, even if payment with Kumar Murthy is to use for the Fermat curve, use the fact that in, over the number field in h 110 squared, you have the cycle class of the automorphism. And like simplify the sequence on the left here, using, um, using the cycle class of the, the extra correspondences that.
00:56:18.372 - 00:56:19.752, Speaker B: Live in the subgroup.
00:56:19.848 - 00:56:28.440, Speaker A: So in general, if you take a curve over a number field, you expect to have no correspondences. But if you reduce mod p, you get a whole bunch of extra ones.
00:56:28.472 - 00:56:31.056, Speaker B: You have the graph of the Frobenius, right?
00:56:31.160 - 00:56:47.224, Speaker A: So you can, you can use that to simplify this term on the left here. So that produces, so if you reinterpret what, what it is, unpack everything you get. A homomorphism, which we call the Frobenius shadow is constructed out of.
00:56:49.124 - 00:56:49.620, Speaker C: The graph.
00:56:49.652 - 00:57:06.524, Speaker A: Of Frobenius that lands in this much smaller group. And here you can actually compute elements. So what we actually do, this is, so this, this element here is the Kuma class of an explicit element of.
00:57:06.604 - 00:57:18.052, Speaker B: This explicit point, the jacobian of the reduction of the curve mod pie. So, so it's the point.
00:57:18.108 - 00:57:23.820, Speaker A: So I can even define what it is for you some overall. So what shows up as the fixed.
00:57:23.852 - 00:57:26.268, Speaker B: Points for your correspondence?
00:57:26.316 - 00:57:34.188, Speaker A: So we're taking the Frobenius. So what shows up is rational fP, rational points on the curve. But you combine this, you take a.
00:57:34.276 - 00:57:41.060, Speaker B: Formal linear combination with any canonical class for the curve.
00:57:41.172 - 00:57:45.588, Speaker A: And this is not a degree zero divisor. It's not a point of the Jacobian. You have to adjust the weight.
00:57:45.636 - 00:57:57.020, Speaker B: So you multiply this by two, g minus two, which is the degree of the canonical class. And here take the number of points times k of x.
00:57:57.052 - 00:58:05.344, Speaker A: So this is an explicit point on the jacobian. The order of this point, which magma can compute for you, gives you.
00:58:08.404 - 00:58:08.764, Speaker C: Order.
00:58:08.804 - 00:58:11.196, Speaker B: Of this point is our answer p.
00:58:11.260 - 00:58:22.636, Speaker A: So at the end of the day, the algorithm says that if you produce, you sample, sample Frobeni at different times p, compute the order of these points. If you find even one where n.
00:58:22.660 - 00:58:25.620, Speaker B: Sub p doesn't divide n, then it.
00:58:25.652 - 00:58:32.930, Speaker A: Means that the order of the, of the Johnson class is larger than the largest torsion order. So that necessarily means that the John.
00:58:32.962 - 00:58:36.334, Speaker B: Who class has a class has infinite order.
00:58:38.714 - 00:58:39.426, Speaker A: As of last.
00:58:39.490 - 00:58:40.946, Speaker B: Okay, I'm out of time, so I'm.
00:58:40.970 - 00:59:09.514, Speaker A: Just going to say this. Probably you can ask, this is what Kumar Murthy tried asking me at the end of my talk in January. You can ask if the cherished class has infinite order doesn't necessarily mean there is a prime of code reduction where this happens. We can show this assuming big monodromy if the galaction on each one is big is all of GSP, we have sketch of an argument that shows you will be able to produce a prime.
00:59:09.554 - 00:59:12.834, Speaker B: P where n sub p doesn't divide.
00:59:12.874 - 00:59:38.388, Speaker A: M. This algorithm will be able to certify in the cases of big monodromy that charissa has infinite order and thermaquatic is not one of those cases. So Frobenius alone is not is. And you can actually show for the pharmacotic these frobenius shadows actually have bounded order. So this argument doesn't work. Really uses big monotromy, but there are other maps you could potentially use.
