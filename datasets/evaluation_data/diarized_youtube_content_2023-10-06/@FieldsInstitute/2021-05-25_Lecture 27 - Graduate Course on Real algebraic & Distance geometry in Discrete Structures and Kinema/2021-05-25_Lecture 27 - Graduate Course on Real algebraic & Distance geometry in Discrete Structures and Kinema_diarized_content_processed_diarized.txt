00:00:00.400 - 00:01:00.544, Speaker A: We're gonna continue talking about flattening Lp norms. As I said, we're gonna talk mainly about two papers, special topics in two papers of Shorini Varbczychu inhoret, where they are talking about forbidden minors with the l infinity norm on the plane. That would be the first part. And then we will talk about unavoidable minors in large dimensions. So talking about minors, we know that a minor is a minor of g comes from taking g, and then we can just remove any vertices, we can remove edges and we can contract edges. These are the three actions that we can do. The embedding dimension is a minor monotone property.
00:01:00.544 - 00:01:47.624, Speaker A: I think that song has also talked about this, and especially his. I need to start writing. Okay. Especially his reference, the robertson same theorem, which says that when we have a minor closed property, then there is a finite number of forbidden minors. Okay, since we are interested both for the forbidden miners on a given dimension and the norm, we will say LPK forbidden miners. Okay, and we'll enter now to the first paper of these four authors. It's about l infinity minus, as we said on the plane.
00:01:47.624 - 00:02:23.826, Speaker A: And the first thing that we want to say is that the wheel graph with four vertices on the wheel and one, the center, is a forbidden minor. So that was conducted by, by Mira, and the four author proved it by showing that there exists a distance on this five point set that is not realizable in two dimensions. So they gave a specific example that.
00:02:23.890 - 00:02:27.774, Speaker B: Is realizable in some l infinity.
00:02:28.154 - 00:02:34.946, Speaker A: Since it's a five point metric space, it is realizable in l infinity. Right, right.
00:02:35.090 - 00:02:37.570, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. As long as it's a metric space.
00:02:37.642 - 00:03:07.892, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So they used a distance that has this property. Actually they gave a specific example. So I will just make a wheel graph over here. One, there is two, here is three. These are all the vertices. The example they gave, they gave specific distances.
00:03:07.892 - 00:04:06.864, Speaker A: So they said that we will put the center of the wheel too far away and all the rest on a sphere around them. So they put 200 over here, and then they put 24 2017 and 18. And if you see these specific numbers just satisfy this property. So if you start by d 14, this is d 14. The 24 is bigger from d 34, which is bigger from d twelve, which is bigger from d 23. And d two, three is bigger than half of d 14. Right? And if you do also the calculations, d 14 minus d twelve is 24 -18 so six is bigger from d three four, which is 20 -70 which is three.
00:04:06.864 - 00:05:06.598, Speaker A: Okay. And another thing that they used is that they took big radius for the wheel from the distance from five. But what we see is that it's just enough to take d two three and d one two, the smallest two, to have some smaller from two d five. And the reason is that I don't want the vertices to go around the sphere d five with center five and radius d five. So let's see how they proved it. So start by assuming that we have q five on the point d on the plane in order to have. So here is for example q five and I will have the sphere with radius d five.
00:05:06.598 - 00:05:48.174, Speaker A: Recall that the sphere in l infinity is just a cube. And so here, for example, is a. .0 here every element of the form x comma zero, and here is every element of form y comma zero comma y. And we just need to show that we cannot put the points q one, q two, q three, q four that they would satisfy the previous properties. So without loss of generality we can assume that, let's change color again. We can assume that q one is somewhere over here.
00:05:48.174 - 00:06:35.786, Speaker A: Okay, that's what it says. It says sum x 10 and x one lies from zero till d five. Right? Recall that this point is zero comma two d five. So since as I said q five, the distance d five is quite large, we cannot go around. And because we cannot go around we can consider that everything would be somewhere over there. So would have either everything zero here or everything zero in the second coordinate. And now we define the partial ordering over there.
00:06:35.786 - 00:07:25.564, Speaker A: Whenever we are given two elements of the sphere, we are thinking that say that the two elements are q and r. We are thinking that q is smaller from r. If they are on the same edge of the square. So say that they are in these edge, say that they are in this edge. Then r is bigger from q means that the non zero coordinate is bigger from the nonzero coordinate of q. Okay? And similarly if they are on the horizontal edge, okay? Otherwise we will call them diagonal. So we have either two is smaller from r or q is big, or r is smaller from q, or they are diagonal.
00:07:25.564 - 00:08:38.294, Speaker A: Okay? So we need to consider three cases to see what's happening. The first one is to think that as we have the square, and as we said, somewhere over here we have x one s or q one, which is x 10, we think that q four is smaller from q one, which means that q four is somewhere over here, right? And this is the distance d 14, which is the largest distance that we can have. So now that we have q four. We need to consider where we're going to put q three. If we put q three somewhere over here from that way larger or diagonal to q four, then the distance d 14 plus d 34 is for sure bigger from d twelve plus d two three, because these are the two smallest and these are the two largest. So if I go there, there's no way to go back and find the q three. So the only way is to have q three over here.
00:08:38.294 - 00:09:47.636, Speaker A: Okay? But now, since I have q three over here, I need to think which way I will put q two would be that way or that way. If I put it from that way, then I would have that d twelve is smaller from d two three, which is not possible because according to our properties, d two three is the smallest possible distance, which means that q two is from this side. Okay? And having, although q two from this side, this means that the distance between q one, q two, which is d twelve, is. I have this already written over here. It's actually equal to d 14, d three four plus d two three. And I'm saying that this is a contradiction because if I go back to the properties, I see that I have a strict inequality for the third one. Okay? In general, whenever I have equalities, you see that I have a contradiction there.
00:09:47.636 - 00:10:48.292, Speaker A: Okay? Everything is strictly over here defined. If you go to the, to the second case, you pretty much end with the same result by starting and putting q three to be smaller from q one and so on. And you will just replicate the mirror of the argument. So we just need to check what happens if q one and q four are diagonal. Okay, here we have once again two subcases, but the two subcases is just the one would be the mirror of the other, let's say. So we just need to concentrate on the first one. So here we have that q one is not some point over here, but it's exactly the point d importance that has this specific coordinate is that with l infinity.
00:10:48.292 - 00:12:02.864, Speaker A: Now we have a nice set of points in the sphere where we can choose q four. Q four can be anywhere here where here is the point, because the distance is the maximum distance of the coordinates, right? So as long as the second coordinate of q four is d 14, since its first coordinate zero, the maximum distance, the maximum distance of the coordinates is d 14. Okay, so now that we have q one here, we need to think where we're going to have the neighbor of q one, which is q two. Of course, if I put it from here, then by the property three, again, there is no weight three that has small distances manage to close the gaps that we created. There would be two large gaps. So we need to have q two over here, not somewhere over here. We know exactly what's this point is d 14 minus d 120.
00:12:02.864 - 00:12:42.824, Speaker A: Okay, now, if I take q three to go that direction, so it would be somewhere over here, then the distance from q four would still be quite large. So I cannot have q three to be bigger from q two. There is not enough space to put it smaller from q two, so they are diagonal. There is no other way. So I know exactly what's q three. Q three is equal to zero, d to three. But now that q three is this one, if I take the distance between q four minus q three, actually have this written.
00:12:42.824 - 00:13:24.884, Speaker A: This, by definition, is the distance d 34. So we know what it should be. But if we do the calculations, we can see that it's the maximum between d two three, which would be the case if q four was exactly in the corner, or d 14, d 13, which would be the case if q four would be on the upper part of the interval of values that it could take at first. But this one has a maximum d to three. And as we said, d to three is the smallest distance of all the possible four distances that we have on the wheel. So it could not be equal to d 34. So this is the contradiction that we have.
00:13:24.884 - 00:14:11.734, Speaker A: And similarly, we take all the different cases. Okay, any questions about this one? It's not a heavy proof, but there are many, many different cases. I try to gather them together and I think that now everyone can solve it following these properties. That's pretty much what's going on with, with these papers and especially with the second manual we're going to see there are too many different cases that I could present. So I will just leave it. But before we go there, let's. Let's try to explain why w four is the only five vertex for beader minor.
00:14:11.734 - 00:14:59.734, Speaker A: So first of all. Yeah, yeah, let's leave it for now there. That's the only five vertex forbidden minor. If I take any other five vertex graph, let's say that I take k five. And now we'll take a graph that doesn't contain w four. Then the largest that I can take is this graph over here. Okay? But if you think about it, this graph is k four that is glued with k three on some edge z.
00:14:59.734 - 00:15:58.424, Speaker A: Can anyone say, what's that edge? It's this one, right? Is q two, q four. This graph over here is k four. And on k two so this adds q two, q four. They are glued with the k three, q three, q two, q four. Okay, so we know that k four is too flattenable. So we just need to show that if I glue it with. With a k three, it will still remain too flattenable.
00:15:58.424 - 00:16:04.144, Speaker A: Okay. And I think that this is. Yes, hang on.
00:16:04.184 - 00:16:12.944, Speaker B: I mean, I think the whole graph is not k four, right? I mean. You mean the q one. I can't read this thing. Wait, hang on.
00:16:13.064 - 00:16:13.504, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:16:13.584 - 00:16:22.884, Speaker B: Q one, q four, q one, q two. And the one in the middle, q five, that's a k four. Along with D 24.
00:16:23.384 - 00:16:26.088, Speaker A: This is the k four, right? This is the v of k four.
00:16:26.256 - 00:16:36.194, Speaker B: That. Yeah, the. The part. Let me see. Am I allowed to annotate? I guess I can't annotate. Yeah, I can annotate. Wait, hang on.
00:16:36.194 - 00:16:45.794, Speaker B: Annotate. Okay, draw. So I think this is a k four.
00:16:49.534 - 00:16:52.294, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's one that I draw.
00:16:52.454 - 00:16:57.154, Speaker B: Okay. And the other one is paste. This is the triangle here, right?
00:16:57.314 - 00:16:57.674, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:57.714 - 00:17:06.174, Speaker B: Okay. The other one. The other one you drew. The whole thing is. Is homeomorphic to k four.
00:17:08.234 - 00:17:11.974, Speaker A: Sorry, I drew with a grip, with a green pen. This one.
00:17:12.754 - 00:17:14.402, Speaker B: Oh, I see. Okay.
00:17:14.578 - 00:17:16.810, Speaker A: Sorry. I made too many drawings probably.
00:17:16.962 - 00:17:20.466, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. I can erase what I drew.
00:17:20.570 - 00:17:21.885, Speaker A: No, no, it's okay. It's fine.
00:17:22.009 - 00:17:22.793, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:23.813 - 00:18:11.374, Speaker A: Okay, so we agree that k four comes from this four vertices. Q one, q two, q four, q five. And the triangle is this one that is glued on q to q four. Okay, so let's see how this argument goes. We want to show that if I have a graph g, then it's a bedding dimension. Would be the same if I attach to g ak three on some vertex c, on some edge e. So start by a configuration point of the big graph.
00:18:11.374 - 00:19:05.104, Speaker A: So say that this configuration point has realization in larger dimension spaces. And take its restriction to g. Okay, so z zero is its restriction to the g. So since we know that z has the nice flatten ability condition to mpg, let's say then it follows that there exist realization in rmp of g. Here g is missing with the p norm and equal. This is the LPMp over here. Okay, so suppose now that we have, let's say this graph g.
00:19:05.104 - 00:19:50.644, Speaker A: And this is my vw. And over here I want to put the u and to find the u in order to. To draw the two edges with the given distances. Okay, so the u is the one that is outside from z, but it should be in the. In the bigger graph, the distance is. Are given and we need to find the realization. Recall, so that since these are distances that are realized in some space, some lp space, then the triangular inequality did holds, did does hold.
00:19:50.644 - 00:20:51.424, Speaker A: So, pretty much what I want to say is that do the standard trick with the spheres and take the intersections. But in order to do this mathematically is, as we say with Sony state intermediate value theorem, which says that. Let's say that here is your, what were my letters? V and W. Okay, if here is v and w, it doesn't matter if it's in some other angle, even though with a pinors it does matter. But here, what I want to say doesn't matter. In my, my placement, the argument works for every angle. So you can start from v and draw a circle with a given norm.
00:20:51.424 - 00:21:42.188, Speaker A: So this is, for example, for some p that's bigger from two, it's something between a circle and the square. Okay, and my function q takes any x and calculates takes any x that lies on this sphere. Okay, so the domain is the sphere, this sphere over here, and it calculates the distance from w. Okay? So now take two points over there. The first point is this one. This is this point. And by the triangular inequality, the distance is just this one, which has, of course, smaller distance from u and w.
00:21:42.188 - 00:22:27.384, Speaker A: And now take this point over here, which has distance, the sum of the two distances, which is of course bigger from uw. And since this is a connected path, by the intermediate value theorem, there should be a point that would satisfy both distances that we want. And here is our u. And we made this realization in the same space where g was realized. Okay, any questions? I don't hear anything, so let's continue. And here is the second forbidden minor. Unfortunately, I was saying also to mira there.
00:22:27.384 - 00:22:57.076, Speaker A: The proof is quite complicated from the point of view that there are too many different cases that are considered. There are some. At some points they are considered. They consider 17 different cases, and some other point, they consider also 21 different cases. So, I will just keep this proof. I will say that they found that there exists a distance function that is not realizable on the plane. Of course, I'm talking about an infinite norm.
00:22:57.076 - 00:23:45.848, Speaker A: So, distance function, once again is good. These are the numbers that they gave. And now what I want to say is that even though we cannot do the proof, we can see easily why it's a minor. Because if I remove any vertex, then I will end up with a five vertex graph. And this graph, k four plus, I would call it the two dimensional banana. I like this. Instead of saying k four glued with k four plus c removing key let's spend a minute in order to explain what's this one? So we have k four and we have k four glued at e.
00:23:45.848 - 00:24:23.284, Speaker A: This is e. And since we have plus e and this is not inside the circle, this means that we will remove the edge e. So this is our two dimensional banana double manner, okay? So if, if I remove any vertex five, then five vertex graph, so it doesn't contain w four. W four is the only minor. So it's. I cannot have a smaller graph this way. If I contract an edge, then I have once again a five vertex graph.
00:24:23.284 - 00:25:45.548, Speaker A: So once again this one is discarded and the only thing that's remaining is to remove an edge. If I remove this edge, then this one is a degree two that comes up by glowing five on this edge. And the other case is to remove this one. If I remove this one, then this one over here is a degree two edge. Once again that comes up as a subdivision of this vertex c. Okay? So for this vertex c, I know that I have here a two flattenable graph, right? Once again, k four and a triangle. So I can add another degree two along to the t and I can remove the knee and I would still have a too flattenable graph, which could be the case if I had removed, that's two, three, okay? So in both cases, if I remove any edge, I will have a too flattenable graph with the infinity norm.
00:25:45.548 - 00:26:29.824, Speaker A: So indeed we proved that this graph is a minor. Okay, the part that why it's not too flattenable is the difficult part that we didn't do the proof. So a good remark over here is something that son has said before, is that when we are in a euclidean space, we can always glue k sums, okay? Because as we said, the nice way to think about it is this. Just taking the simpler case. Take two triangles, two triangles that have same distances in their edges. They are equal. So I can glue them together, I can rotate them as much as I want and I can glue them, okay, for different norms.
00:26:29.824 - 00:27:19.094, Speaker A: The situation is quite chaotic. The triangles are not equal, for example. And here we see also that even for the two sums, we took two k four s and k four, we know that is two embeddable and we glue them to e, okay, to one k two. And this k two sum did not end up to be a too flattenable graph. So k two sums, it's not a minor close property here. Okay, that's. We can continue now.
00:27:19.094 - 00:28:19.104, Speaker A: And then we want to prove that the only two graphs that are minors, forbidden minors for the plane with the infinity normal, the two graphs that we said w four and the two dimensional double banana. And in order to see it we're going to go with graph theory. So we start by the first proposition, which is pretty well known. When we have a three kinetic graph that has no w four minor, then we end up with k four. So this comes directly from two theorem, which actually says that if this a three connected graph and just a three connected graph, then it's obtained by wn having two operations. The one is that we can add edges and the other we can split vertices. Okay, so this happens for every three connected graph.
00:28:19.104 - 00:28:58.354, Speaker A: So if now we have that contains no w four minor, this means that g comes up from w three. Okay, so we want to say that it is w three. So we need to check what happens if it's not w three. Then it means that we add it or we split vertices. We cannot add any edge of course, because w three is just k four, which is complete. But we cannot also split any vertex because if we split any vertex then we put w four there. Okay, so g is actually equal to k four.
00:28:58.354 - 00:30:10.306, Speaker A: And let's continue. So we start by, we want to say three connected graph, but we say two connected and, and we would not consider that we don't know if u and v are connected or not. So we're going to take the degree of all the rest vertices to be bigger or equal from three apart from these two. Okay, and then we say that if, if we added this vertex then z would have a k four minor. Okay, so z, if we don't know if it has this edge, sorry, not vertex edge, the uv, since we don't know if g has this Uv edge, it has a k four e minor where the u and v can be contracted to be the endpoints of that e. So let's see how this goes. So we have that, if I consider g plus Eu, this one has minimum degree three, so it has a k four topological minor.
00:30:10.306 - 00:31:19.404, Speaker A: Why is that? Because since it has minimum degree three, it cannot be constructed by attaching k three s on k three s by k two sums of k three s, right, because then I would have vertices with degree two. So it has a k four minor. But this is equivalent by saying that has a k four topological minor because of the minimal degree. Okay, and hence since it's a topological minor, if we have h to be a subgraph of g, sorry, we can find a subgraph of g that is a subdivision of k four. So if this is g over here, somewhere over here there is a k four and maybe some subdivisions. And since it's too connected by Menger's theorem, we know that we can have u and v to have some paths in order to go over there. So if they're already there, I'm pretty happy.
00:31:19.404 - 00:31:45.498, Speaker A: Otherwise, there are two different paths in order to go somewhere there. They don't need to go to the edge. Exactly. They could go just over here. But then I would just contract again. So the importance is that these two parts are disjoint and comes from the two connective graphs. So we can contract now these graphs, these paths, and we'll just put u and v to be somewhere in v of h.
00:31:45.498 - 00:32:52.640, Speaker A: And then we can also contract the subdivided edges. And we will say that u and v are here in the graph that has the minor k four. But what's this graph is g plus uv. Okay, so if uv is not there, u and v would be the endpoints of the edge that is missing. Okay, so that's what we need in order to go to the main theorem, that these are the only l two forbidden miners. So start by assuming that this nl two infinity forbidden minor there by my mini multi, is too connected and has minimum degree three. We have understood why this I cannot have a degree two, because then, because then I would just contract, let's say this, this one.
00:32:52.640 - 00:33:43.634, Speaker A: And I would not change the flattenability condition. And the same would be also if it was just a degree that would, an edge that would be subdivided as we did before. So indeed we want minimum degree three. So we assume that z does not contain w four or k four plus k four glue. That is, that's why I'm saying the two dimensional double banana. So if, if g three connected, then as we said from the previous lima, g is equal to k four, right? If this reconnect, it should be some additions from some wn. So, since it doesn't contain w four, should be w three, it's exactly w three, which is k four.
00:33:43.634 - 00:34:40.124, Speaker A: Okay, but this is a contradiction, because we have proven in our Thursday that k four is actually too flattenable for l infinity. So this means that these two connected. So means by saying that it's too connected. Say that I can have this vw edge that are separator. And if, I don't know if that f edge lies in z or not, but they are glued. Two subgraphs, z one and z two, on that f and z one, z two have this f, and I don't know just z still has it or not. Okay, now, if I consider these two subgraphs, z one and g two, then both are also two connected.
00:34:40.124 - 00:35:39.234, Speaker A: Okay. And by the previous lima. Now, z one has a k four c minor, and here is vw. And somewhere here there is the k four minus e minor that exists inside z one. And I think it's of the same holes. For, for g two, there is once again, a minor k four c over there. And vw, as we said, are the two vertices that would be the separator of our graph g.
00:35:39.234 - 00:35:52.034, Speaker A: And this means that Z has the minor that it shouldn't have, which give us the final contradiction. Any questions about that?
00:35:55.994 - 00:36:04.094, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, that's good. I think you did a good job of, you know, making their proof understandable.
00:36:05.194 - 00:36:37.486, Speaker A: That's good. So that's, that's the first part that. Ah, sorry, I have an easy theorem. We have talked about this before. It's an easy corollary that since this happens for l infinity, it would happen also for l one on the plane, because these two spaces are the same space. Okay? There is an isometry onto from one space to the other. Okay? So the forbidden minors are the same also for l one, just for the plane.
00:36:37.486 - 00:37:01.114, Speaker A: If we go in upper dimensions in three, there are two different spaces. Okay, just check the extreme points. For example, l 13 would have six extreme points. L infinity three would have eight extreme points. Okay? So there would be no isometry there. So let's continue. And now we'll go to the second paper.
00:37:01.114 - 00:37:51.240, Speaker A: And in the second paper, they talked about unavoidable miners, as they called for large lp dimensions. And what it means that if you take classes of graphs, that, let's say that they are minor closed, if they cannot be embedded in big Lp spaces, then they should have some of the graphs like this. So these graphs, for example, are in the case where we are once again infinity. Oops, I just saw that. I come from analysis and I put infinity of the top. Okay, so let's start. I don't know if there is an easy way to define sk, Fk, pk and Nk by saying what, how they are constructed.
00:37:51.240 - 00:38:38.284, Speaker A: I think that the best here is to draw an image. So s five is a bipartite graph, and the five goes here, because I have 12345. Let's say if I think only this part, there are five connected components over there. Okay? Just changing only the other part, not the path that comes through, going to the second part of the bipartite graph. Okay? And similarly, here I have this p 512345 and here f 512345. I'm just putting them 12345 in order to have a clue what's gonna be with f six, n six and so on. Okay, I want to make some comments.
00:38:38.284 - 00:39:26.394, Speaker A: I believe that s two. If you try to create it, you will have one forbidden miner over there. And for example, if you take over here, you can find even for n two, you will find inside w four as a minor and you may find it for p five. Sorry for pk and Fk, maybe not tattoo, maybe not so fast, but you will find forbidden miners as well over there. Okay, so any questions is something that we don't understand about the graphs.
00:39:29.404 - 00:39:34.584, Speaker B: No, this is fine, but can you go back one slide?
00:39:34.884 - 00:39:35.664, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:41.164 - 00:39:49.184, Speaker B: Okay, but didn't they have another result? I mean, don't they have some results about, is it all just about two dimensions?
00:39:50.644 - 00:40:01.594, Speaker A: Yes, that's what I think. I think so they say that on three dimensions there are too many possibilities, too many possible graphs. I don't remember any other result over there.
00:40:02.254 - 00:40:03.614, Speaker B: Okay, go ahead, please.
00:40:03.694 - 00:40:49.654, Speaker A: Okay, so now that we know the graphs over there, we need to say that, okay, we'll just give them names. So if we fix the kick, then we say that the union of them for l infinity norms. Okay, so I'm just talking that, I'm just reminding that I'm in infinity. But the union of them for the given k is just the four graphs that I defined above. Defined. Okay. And we say that the graph contains UK infinity minor if it contains some of the, for my, some of the four graphs as a minor.
00:40:49.654 - 00:41:38.898, Speaker A: Okay. And there are some quite black magic from the four authors. Again, they have defined for me it was impossible to try to give even, what's the computable function over there? Because it's created after, I don't know. I see so many different z, one g. There were too many constructions in order to create it. But there is some computable function over there and such that says that if I have any graph that has embed embedding dimension bigger from that g of k, then it contains a UK infinity minor. Okay.
00:41:38.898 - 00:43:15.124, Speaker A: The important, as Queen said, from this result is that if I go large enough in the dimension, then I will find the minor there. Okay, so they work as greedy as they wanted in order to go fast up with the case, in order to say that I'm confident that over there I have a UK infinity minor. On the other hand, if a graph contains NGK infinity minor, then symbolic dimension is bigger from k. Okay, so let's, let's continue and we just will have an infinite counterpart result over here. And by infinite is that they could talk about, for example, for towers, as we were discussing the other time with, with son here, they are taking, instead of towers, they are talking about class of graphs, see? So they define the unions for its family over all the case. So as the family of all this case for the f case, and so on. And given our class c of graphs, okay, we define the bedding dimensions with respect to the norm p, to be the maximum embedding dimension of a graph inside the class.
00:43:15.124 - 00:44:36.632, Speaker A: Okay? So it would be the betting dimension, the maximum betting dimension. If I compare the betting dimension of g that lies inside the class, if this maximum cannot, is not a real number, because if the class, for example, is infinite and then there is no maximum, could be a supreme, or I could have an unbounded set, then I would talk that this one would be equal to infinity. Okay? I don't know why I talked about supreme. It's either it's a maximum or it's unbound. So it's infinite. Okay? So if I think of all the minor clause classes, then the minor close classes should contain the minus from the previous result, right? So we would have that, as I said, being ready, going to infinity. I can say that I'm going to consider graphs that have embedded dimension larger, that function zero and k for every k, if this one goes to infinity, would have also a graph that would go bigger from every g of k for every k.
00:44:36.632 - 00:45:38.064, Speaker A: So it would contain a graph that would have minus some of this. It's minor close. So it will take all the miners, okay. And the other way around from, from the reverse direction. Okay? As I said, this, this, this proof, for example, was, it was about a 40 page paper, and I would say that 30 of these pages were going in order to prove this result, and especially the theorem over here. And g was given, for example, in the appendix afterwards, not as a closed formula, but the existence of that through quite elaborate construction. So just in order to show how these are difficult, I will just show that I will go back to the Euclidean case.
00:45:38.064 - 00:46:23.364, Speaker A: So now my p is equal to two while in this happy place. And we're going to talk about unavoidable minor there. And I want just to see this delta r, which is the triangular grid over there. So I have not put the, I have not put indices because I want to name them right now in order to see how they are named, in order to go to the proof. So this one is the v eleven. This one is v twelve, v 13, v 14, v 15, v 16. This one over here is v 22.
00:46:23.364 - 00:47:01.296, Speaker A: Okay? It doesn't start from two one. So every time, if I have vijay, I know that I is smaller or equal from J. Okay? I didn't start from v two one. I said v two two, v two three, v two four. And I will end up once again with v two six. This one would be v 33 and v 36 and so on. And the result that we're going to discuss is that if I take any delta r, then sympathetic dimension in two dimension is bigger or equal from r minus one.
00:47:01.296 - 00:47:33.424, Speaker A: It's actually equal to r minus one. But we will focus on the bigger or equal part. Okay? And from now till the end, we're going to try to do the proof of this one. So, you see that I have nine pages left over here. All these are about the proof. So we start by taking a standard basis in RR. We will find an embedding over there and we'll consider then embeddings in rr minus one.
00:47:33.424 - 00:48:02.694, Speaker A: So we'll do the embedding recursively. So I will start by putting phi of vi, comma J. So once again, I just want to point out. So I'm talking about this four. This would be my first step. The second step would have these things over here, these guys. The third step would be on the third row and so on.
00:48:02.694 - 00:48:44.192, Speaker A: Okay. So I will start by putting the vertices of the first column, not row, sorry, column, on the basis. And then on the second column, what I'm going to do is that I'm going to take the midpoint of that interval. Okay? This way, if you think about it, I'm creating over here, a one dimensional triangle. Have v eleven, v twelve, that they are in e one, e two. And here is my v two. Okay.
00:48:44.192 - 00:49:03.844, Speaker A: It's a one dimensional triangle over there. Okay. And I will have the midpoints. And then on the third point, on the third level, I will go to the midpoints of the midpoints and so on. Okay? Are we fine with the construction without embedding?
00:49:10.804 - 00:49:11.584, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:11.924 - 00:49:48.544, Speaker A: Yeah. So. And don't say anything over here. I'm saying that I have so n two distance function and I have an embedding. Now, this metric space, this metric space here with the given function is l two, r flattenable for sure. And we consider that we have an isometric embedding in a euclidean space, e. Okay? And now we can show why we chose to have the midpoints.
00:49:48.544 - 00:51:08.294, Speaker A: Because if I think now this one dimensional triangles, it doesn't matter what I'm going to do, as long as I am inside the euclidean space C with the new embedding, the new y vij, where I is bigger or equal from two, is the midpoint of the two elements that was constructed with, right, and this is held by the isometric embedding. That's, that's the trick over there. Okay? So if you think about it once again, it's important just to consider where we're gonna put the first column. If we know when we're going to embed the first column, then all the rest would come as midpoints of midpoints. Okay, so let's see, what's the trick? So we want to show that it can be bendable up to r r to the r minus one. That that would be the most squeeze that I can do. So that's why I can consider e to be just a hyperplane inside r to the r.
00:51:08.294 - 00:52:32.312, Speaker A: Okay, so this is, I'm saying that this subset, okay, and this one is homeomorphic, is actually translation and rotation of rr to the minus one, okay? So it's, we can consider as the hyperplane. I just want to say that since it's a hyperplane, that all the, all the basic vectors of our standard base are inside this, this hyperplane, okay, just, just keep it over here in order to remember that these points were also my phi one comma j's. Right. That's how I start my first recurring construction. Okay, so what we are claiming is that in the way that we have the embedding, all the points qi, qi and qj have distance two. Remember that these were the r points that we have for, in the first column, okay, and is there a quid distance over there? This means by the standard theory that we know from euclidean space, is that this, can it be embedded at most in r to the r minus one? I cannot go any lower. Okay, so that's, that's what we're gonna do.
00:52:32.312 - 00:53:22.836, Speaker A: So that's a good point to make a break, because for the next seven pages, we just want to show that this is true. Have we understood what we're trying to prove? We took a specific embedding, and we took this one dimensional triangles such that we would force the embedding to give us equidistant points. Okay, so how we're going to prove it? We're going to prove it by induction. For r equal to two. Then I have two vertices joined by a vertex. So there's nothing there, right. For I equal to two, I just have this one, just a triangle, nothing to prove over there.
00:53:22.836 - 00:54:00.826, Speaker A: While for example, if I had r equal to three, I wouldn't know from start what's the distance between q one and q three. I would know only the distance between q one and q two. And from q two to q three. Okay, so by induction we suppose that up to r minus one we are okay and we needed to prove it for r. So by our inductive hypothesis, these are r minus one points. So these are okay. And these two points without q one now are also okay.
00:54:00.826 - 00:54:49.664, Speaker A: They are equidistant. So it just suffices to show that these two, that they are not in both cases have also distance equal to the square root of two. Okay, so let's see how we're going to show this. So we apply appropriate isometries, rotations and whatever we want in order to put the qks that have distance two. Remember the first r -1.2 case inside the standard basis. Okay, once again I want you to remember that my, what was feed of what was the letter v? V one k was also a k.
00:54:49.664 - 00:55:51.490, Speaker A: This holded for every k from one t. Remember the phi was the rr embedding. And then we went to the psi embedding to that hyperplane. Okay, so we say that we can put the first k r minus one elements to the same points and we don't know what happens for qr. Qr is just some vector in r that is in the hyperplane. That's why I have this property, okay? And the second part is that it satisfies this equation for every k. And this comes straight from the fact that if I calculate the euclidean distances, if you take qk, as we said, from here, it's equal to ek, right? So I have qr minus ek.
00:55:51.490 - 00:57:06.684, Speaker A: So for all the rest coordinates, ek has coordinate equal to zero for, for the k coordinate has equal to one. So I would have sum of squares for all the rest and x k minus one for the k coordinate. This one should be equal to two by our inductive hypothesis, as we said. So if I do the calculations, I have this nice formula, I take one from the other side, two jk from the other side, and I have two, okay, now check every two. The right hand side depends on xk while the left hand side doesn't depend on xk. And what this means, this means that this r minus two coordinates are actually equal, right? Because they're independent of the choice of the index. Okay, so we know that Qr is x one x two x two x two xr and let's continue.
00:57:06.684 - 00:58:30.978, Speaker A: So we'll concentrate on that edge over here. I just wanted to make, to go back in order to say what's that edge? That edge is this one, this is v r minus one, comma r minus one. This is v r minus one comma r. Okay, and I saw that over there, there is an edge, as we said. So I need to have the isometric embedding two of psi to satisfy the same property for phi. Okay, but since we have the same points for I equal to, for j equal to one till r minus one if I go back to the graph. So I have the same points for, for these two, so also for this one, for this two, so for this one, for these two, so for this one, and for this two, so for this one as well.
00:58:30.978 - 00:59:29.114, Speaker A: And similarly, I have the same coordinates for p and phi for all these vertices. One of them is this one. Okay, just go the induction backwards and you can find also, okay, so bind what I said over here that this holds for every I j where j doesn't hit the ceiling, just goes up to r minus one. Okay, so this one is exactly the same as this one and this is not connected with one. For the moment. Just what I'm doing is that instead of y I took the phi over here because I said that at this vertex I have the same embedding exactly. Okay, that's the only change that I did over there.
00:59:29.114 - 01:00:18.884, Speaker A: And then the next step I subtract and I add by this five. And now I have done a nice trick over here. Why? Because I said that this one, I don't know why it didn't change. This one, which is equal to this one, is equal to this guy with the phis. Okay, but this guy appears also here. So this is equal to this guy and this guy minus something else. What we're going to do, we're just going to use the linearity of the dot product in order to expand this norm and just subtract the equal terms.
01:00:18.884 - 01:01:46.284, Speaker A: And so from one we will get the second property, right. So I would have that v squared plus this squared minus their, twice their dot product would be equal to this. So these two would cancel out. And I would have that the second, the square of this norm, the second term that I would have on the expansion would be equal to two I the dot product over there. Okay, so that's another point to make a pose and ask if you are happy, if you have any questions, because the rest of the proof is to calculate the left hand side and the right hand side over here. So let's start from the left hand side. If you think about it, when you calculate it, psi minus phi of a vertex in the ceiling, then by the induction, you will have that this one is the midpoint of this one and psi of.
01:01:46.284 - 01:02:28.994, Speaker A: Not this one. Sorry. Okay, let's write it. This one is equal to half of psi, vi minus one, r plus psi, v minus one, r minus one. I minus one, r minus one. Okay. And what does this gives? The thing is that if I write this one, I would have the same thing with phis, a half of five, v, I minus one, comma, r plus five, vi minus one, r, comma, one.
01:02:28.994 - 01:02:54.562, Speaker A: And if, even though we don't know what happens in the ceiling, this is also in the ceiling, because I have the r. I have the r over here. Here. Now I have r minus one, so I'm not in the ceiling. So these two are the same thing. So I would just cancel this out, and I will continue by induction. And I would have only the respective coordinates in the ceiling up to the point that I would go to v one.
01:02:54.562 - 01:03:35.034, Speaker A: Okay. Every time I take one over two factor outside, so I would have the one over two to the I minus one factor outside. And now what's psi of v one? R is qr is the only element that I have not identified with some er. And as I have done with phi for phi, I know that all the column goes to the standard basis, so it goes to error. Okay? So that's what's inside over here. But instead of I have r minus one. So I will just do the calculations for the norm.
01:03:35.034 - 01:04:07.854, Speaker A: This I minus one will become two. R minus two. Right? Because. Because it would be r minus one minus one. So that's why I would have r minus two and two, because I have the square over here. So we are happy about this one. Once again, I have the norm of a difference.
01:04:07.854 - 01:04:42.414, Speaker A: I use the dot product in order to do the calculations. I have q over here, the norm of Qr squared, that was the second property that we had about the norm of QR. That would be one plus two of any xk that I would have from k from two to r minus one. So I will just put x two over there. This one will become one. And just the projection of Qr to the coordinate er would be xr. Okay? So I could just take a common factor two, and I would have this formula over here.
01:04:42.414 - 01:05:07.254, Speaker A: So I have calculated already the left hand side. I need to calculate now the right hand side. Okay, check that part of what I did appears also in the right hand side. Okay. This one is also over here. Okay. So I'm gonna use this one again in the next page.
01:05:07.254 - 01:06:09.754, Speaker A: I have Qr mine cr, if you think about it, Qr, as we said, is x one, x two, x two, comma, comma, dots, x two xr. So I can just take x two times the vector that has one everywhere. And in the first coordinate I need to, I think that this should go the other way around. Right. X one minus x two e one plus xr minus x two minus one for er. Okay. And now we want to calculate the dot products in order to calculate the dot products in the right hand side.
01:06:09.754 - 01:06:53.234, Speaker A: So if you do the calculations for Phi vii at the e one, as we said, taking the projections as we have, we just taking only for day one. Let's, let's go back to the graph in order to say what, so what I'm saying, I have a different column. So this one point of the, of the form viii. So every time going back, it will end up to one path that would go to v eleven. That's the only one would have v eleven. And now we'll take the projection over there. Every step that I'm going backwards, I multiply by one over two.
01:06:53.234 - 01:07:36.314, Speaker A: So that's why that projection over here will give one over two to the I minus one. And similarly, if I go now from ViII, if I go to the ceiling, okay, so you see I have r in the second coordinate of v and I take the projection to r. I will have the same thing, but I will take every time the projection goes to the ceiling. Okay, so just doing the calculations. Phi of vi minus three of phi of vir, comma, epsilon one. For the first one, what we, it's what we gave. This one has no connection with, with e one.
01:07:36.314 - 01:08:33.444, Speaker A: So it would give zero, same way four er. This one would give zero as a dot product. And this one would give the one over two, I minus one. So the minus will give also this one over there. Okay, so I have gathered what I needed and, and I'm doing the calculations. So this was my right hand side. If we think once again, the QR and tr, again, qr is x one, x two, x two, x two, x two, xr.
01:08:33.444 - 01:09:48.948, Speaker A: Okay, so this, if I, if I consider these two, I would have brackets that would go to the one and the r rows. And whatever is in between, it would have a plus and minus of the same order that we have here. So here we have er that doesn't play any difference for these coordinates. So when I'm saying that this one is equal to this, I want to put plus zero, which zero goes for these all coordinates. Okay, so, once again, I have the mistake over here. Okay, so doing once again, the calculation with e one and er. Now, recall, we have Phi over here, and for Phi is exactly the e one and er.
01:09:48.948 - 01:10:24.104, Speaker A: That's the first embedding that we had. If we do the calculations, we'll have zero for the first one, because, as I said, x two will just give plus and minus x two. And for the second one, we'll give x 141 and x two, sorry, x one minus x 241, and we'll give a -40 r of all this thing. So I would have minus, minus and minus. All this would cancel out, and I would have this formula. So I have calculated the left hand side. I have calculated the right hand side.
01:10:24.104 - 01:11:03.918, Speaker A: And from these calculations, it ends up that x two is equal to x one. Okay? And now that I want to calculate the distance between qr minus q one. Q one is e one, as we said. So once again is the sum of all the known squared for everything that's different from one. And I have the distance from one squared for the first coordinate. I just rearrange by expanding this formula in order to take all the xi squared by the property that we had. For the.
01:11:03.918 - 01:11:47.934, Speaker A: For the square of the norm over there, this would be one plus two times x two plus one minus two times x one, which, since x two is equal to one, these two can cancel out, which is equal to two, which means that I proved that these two are equidistant. Okay? And so all of these are equidistant. I have distant points. So this cannot be embedded in something that's smaller from, has dimension smaller from r minus one. And that pretty much completes the proof and completes all the things that I wanted to say today. So, do you have any questions?
01:11:56.434 - 01:12:14.374, Speaker B: Yeah, it's difficult material to present. In fact, I think in some ways, the second paper at least tries to make some general principles compared to the first one, I think.
01:12:19.874 - 01:12:51.114, Speaker A: It'S easier from the point of view that you can put poses that here I want to do this and here I want to do that. It has some ideas. Okay. So I want to prove that these are equidistant, which is fine for rigidity. I do understand that. But, for example, going from the left hand side to the right hand side over here, this seems calculations that there is any intuition that this calculation would work over there.
01:12:56.174 - 01:13:12.570, Speaker B: Well, do you think there's some hope of trying to give it more general argument or at least a cleaner argument that doesn't get into the. I mean it's not clear how much of this argument is actually required. In a way, yes.
01:13:12.642 - 01:13:40.604, Speaker A: And that's, that's pretty much evident in, in a lot of the two papers that there are some arguments that are over complicated. Even, even for example for the k, for gluing a k three, the proof that they have is quite more complicated than needed. So I do believe. I do believe that there could be easier proof than this.
01:13:41.304 - 01:13:47.484, Speaker B: It seems like to proceed to sort of make progress and start using this kind of thing, you need something simpler.
01:13:48.224 - 01:14:07.304, Speaker A: Yes, yes, that's true. So in the first part I think that the way that I presented some of the proofs, I've changed some bits here and there that I said, okay, this one is. It's done more, can be done more easily.
01:14:07.844 - 01:14:08.652, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:08.828 - 01:14:32.804, Speaker A: But for here, the calculation, the middle part is so elaborate that I'm not sure if there are easier ways. From the way that you follow the standard path, it seems that it should be possible to go faster. But. Yeah, I don't know, but I would like to see if we can do this proofs better.
01:14:34.784 - 01:14:46.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree, because it seems like it's good to know these facts, but if you want to extend the techniques right now it's almost impossible. Yeah.
