00:00:00.120 - 00:01:22.674, Speaker A: So this is the second lecture. So I'd like to talk about possible approaches to the unsolved problem of characterizing generic three dimensional rigidity of bar joint frameworks. And in particular, I'd like to talk about an approach suggested by Jack Graver in the 1980s, I think, which was to consider the maximal abstract rigidity metroid. So to start off with, I'll have to tell you what this is. And so we're going to go back to the definition of a metroid, which I don't want to repeat in detail, but a metroid is a ground set a, together with a family of subsets I, which we think of independent sets, and the independent sets satisfy these three independence axioms. So we call the sets in I independent, and the sets which are not in I dependent circuits are minimal dependent sets. A base of a set of elements of the ground set is a maximum independent subset of that set, and the rank of a subset of the ground set is the size of a maximum independent subset.
00:01:22.674 - 00:03:11.288, Speaker A: And then for the ground set itself, we say that the versace of the ground set, the versace of the metroid, and the rank of the ground set is the rank of the metroid. So here's a new definition, or at least it's a definition I didn't give yesterday. So, given a subset of the ground set air, the closure of this subset is the unique maximal superset which has the same rank. So algorithmically we can construct the closure by going through the elements which do not belong to air one by one, and adding them to the set if they do not increase the rank, and throwing them away if they do increase the rank. And this greedy algorithm will produce a unique maximum by the third axiom of independence. And to give us an example, if we have a graph j which is rigid in generically rigid in d dimensional euclidean spheres, and we consider the d dimensional generic rigidity metroid on a large complete graph, and then take the closure of the edge set of a, then we will get a complete graph on the vertex set of b. So if a graph is rigid when we take the closure, so if a graph is rigid, it has maximum rank, possible rank, so all of the edges which do not belong to g when we add them, they won't increase the rank.
00:03:11.288 - 00:03:53.704, Speaker A: So we can add all of the edges which don't belong to j and join two vertices of g and without increasing the rank. And that gives us the complete graph as the closure. So this leads us on. Well, not quite so, as I said at the beginning, I want to talk about a maximal matrix. And in order to be able to talk about something being maximal, I need a partial order. So here's my order relation. So given two metroids, M one and M two, on the same ground set e, I say that m one is less than or equal to m two.
00:03:53.704 - 00:05:12.494, Speaker A: Every independent set in M one is independent in M two. And another way of saying that is that every base of M one is independent in M two, since every independent set in M one extends to a base of M one. And another way of saying it is that the rank of any set in M one is less than or equal to its rank in M two. So the game we're going to play is we're going to have a collection, a family of metroids on the same ground set, and we're going to use this relation to define a partial order on that set, and we're going to ask what are the maximum elements in this partial order? So in particular, this is a bit of a mouthful, sorry. In particular, I'm going to look at the family of all abstract d rigidity metroids on the same ground set. So these were defined by Jack Graber in, I guess 1991. And the idea is that geometry is difficult and combinatorics maybe is a bit easier.
00:05:12.494 - 00:06:25.444, Speaker A: So in order to get a better understanding of the d dimensional rigidity metroid, then we should maybe set aside the geometry for a brief period and concentrate on the combinatorics. And so the way he did that was to study an abstract metroid, which in some sense represents the combinatorics of three dimensional rigidity. And he so I'll give a alternative, perhaps similar definitions in it later, but this is Grover's definition, and so he defines it in terms of the closure operator. So let's take, I have a Metroid M. The ground set is the edge set of a large complete graph, and I take two subsets of the edge set them complete graph. And I'm going to be a bit schizophrenic in that some of the time I'm going to be thinking of these as edge sets, and some of the time I'm going to be thinking of them as subgraphs. So they are, I'm going to think of them as the subs graphs spanned by these edges.
00:06:25.444 - 00:08:26.384, Speaker A: So the first axiom for an abstract de rigidity matrid is if my two sub graphs have at least d vertices in common and the closure of each of the subgraphs is a complete graph, then when I take the union of the edge sets and take the closure, I get a bigger complete graph. So this corresponds to the problem, the property in generic dimensional rigidity, that if these two subgraphs are rigid in our d and they have at least d vertices in common, then when I take the union, the union will be rigid. So the sang property is a kind of complementary property for subgraphs which have less than de vertices in common. So for for such subgraphs, their common vertices act as a hinge, which might be a full dimensional hinge or a lower dimensional hinge. And the property says that if I take the closure of the union, then it's strictly contained in the complete graph on the vertex set of the first subgraph union, the complete graph of the vertex set of the second subgraph. So for sub graphs which have only d minus one inverter says in common, when I take the closure, I do not add any edges which have one end vertex in the first subgraph and one end vertex in the second subgraph. And the kind of rigidity reason for that is that because the common vertices act like a hinge, there will be a motion of the two sub graphs around the hinge.
00:08:26.384 - 00:10:14.344, Speaker A: And if I add an edge going from the left subgraph to the right subgraph, I will restrict this motion about the hinge. And restricting the motion means that I reduce the dimension of the kernel of the rigidity matrix, which means that if I add such an edge, I will increase the rank of the rigidity matrix, so such an edge cannot belong to the closure. And I guess going on from the note on the, at the beginning, so if we have this abstract rigidity matrix for which there is no rigidity matrix, we can think of subsets of the edge set as being rigid if their closure gives us a complete graph on their vertex. So we have a kind of abstract definition of rigidity. And as I said, the two properties, r1 and two reals reflect the properties of generic rigidity in three dimensional repellent space. So Grever wrote a couple of papers on this, I guess, at least, and his first paper assured that many other properties of the d dimensional generic rigidity metroid carry over to the abstract d rigidity metroid. And in particular, I guess one of the more startling properties is that if we have any abstract d rigidity matrid, it will have the same rank as the d dimensional generic.
00:10:14.344 - 00:11:03.748, Speaker A: So the rank is given by Maxwell's condition. And so Greg assured that lots of other properties also hold, and also that perhaps some of these properties could give a simple, simpler characterization of abstract rigidity matrix. So this is kind of summarized in this lemma so we have a metroid m, and its ground set is the edge set of a large complete graph, and n is at least b plus two. So it's a bit trivial. It ends, everything's independent. N is less than or equal to b plus one. So the following statements are equivalent.
00:11:03.748 - 00:12:18.904, Speaker A: So M is an abstract, a rigidity meteorite. And then from 2010, there is a characterization due to Vietn Guyan, which is probably the most useful for my purposes in this talk. So it says that a metroid on the edge set of kn is an abstract rigidity metroid if it has the right rank. And also it has the property that every copy of the complete graph on d two vertices is a circuit in this metroid. So every copy of kd plus two, which is contained in a large kn, is a circuit, and that characterizes abstract, a regenerative. So a third equivalent characterization goes back to 2004, and it's due to Graeber and Brigitte and Hermann and Savatius. And so they assured that equivalently we could say that every copy of the complete graph on d plus one is independent in m, and that the d dimensional zero extension operation preserves independence in M.
00:12:18.904 - 00:13:29.854, Speaker A: So yesterday we saw the two dimensional zero extension operation, and the d dimensional zero extension operation is the natural generalization, where instead of adding a vertex of degree two to a graph, we add a vertex of degrade d. So it's easy to say the same proof shows that this preserves independence in the d dimensional generic rigidity metroid. And, well, it also preserves independence in any abstract de rigidity metroid, and can be used to characterize abstract and k rigidity matrix. So let's. So this is the big conjecture of Graeber about the maximum abstract de rigidity metroid, and it's based on the following observations. So the game we plan is being very generic. So, I've always taken a generic realization of a graph in d dimensional space.
00:13:29.854 - 00:14:15.754, Speaker A: Let's, as an exception, instead of taking a generic realization, we'll just make sure that the vertices of cairn are in general position. And so for such a. So there are many such realizations, and for any one of them, we can construct the rigidity matrid. And then once we have a. Sorry. We can construct the rigidity matrix, and then once we have a matrix, we can take its raw material. So we define a matriid on the edge set of kn, in which a set of edges is independent if and only if the corresponding rows of this rigidity matrix are linear independent.
00:14:15.754 - 00:15:35.884, Speaker A: So Grubb assured that for any general position realization, we get an abstract de rigidity metroid. And he also pointed out that if we do so, this gives us lots of examples of abstract a rigidity metroids. And he also pointed out that for any such example, it will be the metroid, m will be less than or equal to the generic rigidity metroid in the weak order, because if something is independent in a non generic matrix, it will be independent in a generic matrix. So he looked at this order. So he also gave examples of abstract rigidity, matroy, which, which are not constructed in this way. But still he looked at this order and he conjectured that this will extend to the whole core set of all abstract d rigidity metroids on the edge set of each kn. So this is a family of metroids, which all have the same ground set, so it's ordered under the weak order.
00:15:35.884 - 00:16:16.804, Speaker A: And in general, a pore set can have lots of maximal elements. So Grover made the, I think, amazingly insightful conjecture that this particular for set would have a unique maximal element. And more than that, he. Which was maybe not so insightful, he conjectured that the maximum element would be the three dimensional generic rigidity metroid. Oof. So there's a bit of a historical monologue. Now, I'm not read.
00:16:16.804 - 00:17:18.574, Speaker A: I should have really broken this up, but there wasn't room on the slide. So the first thing to point out is that Grever verified both parts of his conjecture for day equals one and two. But not so long after it, I think a student, I don't know whether he was an undergraduate or a postgraduate, pointed out that part b of the conjecture was false when D was greater or equal to four. The main thing I want to tell you about in my many two lectures is recent work with Kiertney Clinch and Shanechi Tanigawa. And so what we've done is we've verified that part a of the conjecture is true when de goes straight. So we've shown that there's a unique maximal abstract three rigidity metroid. And more than that, we characterize the rank function of this metroid.
00:17:18.574 - 00:18:11.444, Speaker A: Now, this is, this is actually saying it the wrong way around in some sense, because the way we show is maximal is we. Is that true? So that's not quite true, but the way we show it's maximal is we guess what the maximal abstract rigidity metroid is. So we have a particular metroid. Actually, we didn't guess it. Walter Whiteley guessed it. So we're sure that Walter Whiteley's guess is true for D equals three, and then we use the fact that it's maximal to work out what its rank function is. But our proof wouldn't work without knowing what the, or at least suspecting what the maximum metroid is.
00:18:11.444 - 00:19:14.204, Speaker A: So five, six years ago, there is an alternative approach, which was described by Meyer Sitharam at a rigidity workshop in Banff in 2015. And Meera sketched an algorithmic proof of a result by herself, Chen, who was here today's Jordan, and Andrew Vince, who was a colleague in Florida. That part air of the conjecturies true, when D equals three. So this is the same as the first part of our result. As far as I know, their probe hasn't appeared. What has appeared is a pre print by Meera and Andrew Vince in 2009, which proves a much more general result. And it's much more general than saying that air holds for all day.
00:19:14.204 - 00:20:28.362, Speaker A: So the last part of this monologue is a bit sad. So it seems that, well, it's not saying that there are counter examples to the general theorem of cipher and veins. So the first counterexample I heard of was to, oh, I forgot his name, Julepap in Budapest. But there are now other counterexamples, and the status of the Citha and Vince resort is not clear, at least to me. Okay, so let's move on. So I'd like to move on and go back to grievous original proof that his conjectures show for D equals one and two, because that's closely related to the proof given by myself and k in Shinache. So let's go back to Jack Rieba's probe, and in fact, I'll start off trying to relate it to the law bas Gemini rank formula, which I don't think is Jack's proof.
00:20:28.362 - 00:20:45.614, Speaker A: I think this is Jack's proof is different. And I'll say why? So let's give a direct pro an easy direct proof using the fact that we know the rank formula for the two dimensional rigidity metric.
00:20:46.154 - 00:20:54.934, Speaker B: Sorry, Bill, there's a question in the chat from will. Is the method of Severin Vince false for higher D, or is it a itself known to be false?
00:20:55.604 - 00:21:21.804, Speaker A: No. So I believe here is true. It's just that they have a general theorem, which in some sense, the rigidity metroid is. We'll understand more about this tomorrow. But the rigidity metroid is defined by. Well, if we. So sorry for jumping around.
00:21:21.804 - 00:22:38.204, Speaker A: So if we go back to Nguyen's characterization of abstract rigidity, it's in terms of the statement that every copy of Pier D plus two is a circuit. So, no. So in some sense, air is about these abstract, these abstract rigidity matroids, in which each copy of kd plus two is a circuit. And the more general theorem of citherum and Vince doesn't just look at complete graph spin circuits, it chooses an arbitrary graph j and C. Let's consider metroids, for which this arbitrary graph j, every copies of this, every copy of this arbitrary graph j, is a circuit. And if we, if we take it to that extrane, then it becomes false. If we restrict to complete graphs, then in some sense it's equivalent to air, and there are no known counterexamples.
00:22:38.204 - 00:22:49.124, Speaker A: That's a long answer to a simple question. Does it make sense? Yes.
00:22:49.164 - 00:22:49.984, Speaker C: Thanks, Bill.
00:22:53.804 - 00:24:20.664, Speaker A: Okay, so we go back to trying to show that the two dimensional generic rigidity metroid is the maximal abstract to a rigidity metroid. And we'll try and use the lower, generally rank formula. So what we're going to do is we're going to show that the rank in this metroid is greater than or equal to the rank in any other abstract tur rigidity metroid. So we chose an arbitrary abstract rigidity metroid on the edge set of kn, which is some subset of edges of kn. And we'll try and ensure that the rank of f ing two reals is greater or equal to the rank of f in m. And Loewas Gemini gives us a partition of the set of edges f, so that the rank in the two dimensional rigidity metroid of f is given by the summing the Maxwell bound on the rank over all sets in the partition. So now, since m is an abstract rigidity metroid, each of the sets, the rank of each of the sets in the partition, in our abstract rigidity metroid, m is also bounded by the Maxwell bound.
00:24:20.664 - 00:25:25.254, Speaker A: So this is one of the first things that that Graeber proved on the previous slide about abstract two rigidity metroids, or abstract a rigidity metroids. And now it's easy. So the rank of this set f in m by submodularity, it's at most the sum of the ranks of the sets in the partition, and that's at most the sum of the Maxwell bounds. And that's equal to the rank of f in the two dimensional rigidity matrix. So I guess the moral is that if we know the rank of a metroid, the rank function of a metroid, then we should be able to decide everything. But the point of Jack's conjecture is that we want to get a better understanding of metroids that we do not know the rank function for. So this is not, that's not a good illustration of what he wants to do.
00:25:25.254 - 00:26:23.214, Speaker A: So let's look at the second probe, which I think is corset a Jack's probe. So the idea is that we use induction on the size of the set f. So I chose my arbitrary abstract taurigidity metroid n, and I chose some set f in the ground set, and I want to show that. So I assume f is independent in m, and in order to show that two reals is maximal, I need to show that f is independent in r two. It's independent in the generic two dimensional rigidity metroid. So we use induction on f. And again, since n is an abstract tur rigidity metroid, the rank of f is at most the Maxwell bound, but f is independent, so its rank is equal to its size.
00:26:23.214 - 00:27:27.764, Speaker A: So the size of x is at most the Maxwell bound. And now if we just use the handshake in Lemmerhoek from graph theory, it tells us we can find a vertex in f. So again, im using my schizophrenic approach of thinking of f is what the set of edges and the subgraph in which the degree of the vertex is at Mos tray. So I concentrate on this vertex of lower degree. So the first case is where the degree of the vertex is at most two. And that's easy using the zero extension operation from yesterday. So what I do is I delete v from my subgraph, or if you like, I delete all edges incident to v from my set of edges f, and by the fact that every subset of an independent set is independent.
00:27:27.764 - 00:28:33.364, Speaker A: When I delete some edges from f, I have another independent set, but now it's smaller than f. So I can apply induction and say that f minus v is going to be smaller than the two dimensional rigidity Metroid. And now the lemma that we saw yesterday tells us that the zero extension operation, which adds v back to f, preserves independence in the two dimensional rigidity metroid. So f is independent in the two dimensional rigidity network. So that's easy. The case when f has the grade three is a bit harder, but not so much harder. And the idea is that instead of using, we use induction to go down to us, so we go down to a smaller set than f, we apply induction and we get it's independent in r two, and then we use one extension to go back to f.
00:28:33.364 - 00:29:34.694, Speaker A: So to go down we want to use the inverse operation to a one extension. So the inverse operation, we delete our vertex v again, and then we add an edge xy between the neighbors of v. And I'd like to do it. I'd like to prove that I can do this in such a way that I preserve independence in our abstract rigidity metroid M. So because we're working in this abstract metroid, which we don't know, the only thing we can use our metroid properties. So let's start so f is independent in M. So when I delete v, or when I delete the three edges incident with v from f, the rank is going to go down by three because every all the edges are f are independent.
00:29:34.694 - 00:30:19.774, Speaker A: So now let f v plus. So this is f. I delete v and I go down to f minus v. Now fv plus I get by adding an edge between any two non adjacent neighbors of v. So if the claim is false, then when I add each of these edges, the rank does not go up because it's gone down by three. If I add one edge and it goes up, the rank goes up. Then I'll have f minus v plus xy being independent, it will say one of these edges does not belong to the closure.
00:30:19.774 - 00:31:38.034, Speaker A: So I need to worry about the case when the rank of f plus v is the same as the rank of f minus v. So I have to worry about the case when adding these three edges does not increase the rank, so it stays at the size of f minus three. So now I use another property that I know from Nguyen's equivalent characterization. I know that here four is a circuit in any abstract rigidity neutral. So this means that when I add the vertex v back, I'm creating a copy of the complete graph on four vertices and ngo jens tells me that when I add these three edges, I create a circuit in the matrix. So that means that when I add these three edges, the rank can go up by at most two. It can't go up by three because there is a dependency here.
00:31:38.034 - 00:32:27.924, Speaker A: But if it goes up by two, it tells us that the rank in m of f, which is this graph, is equal to the size of f minus one. And that can't happen because f is independent and f is a subgraph of f plus. So a simple metroid argument tells us that we can find such an age xy. And now once we've got xy, then we're warm and dry using the one extension. So this is the claim that we've just proved. And now I choose such an xy, such that f minus v plus xy is independent in m by induction. I'm independent in the two dimensional rigidity matrix.
00:32:27.924 - 00:33:44.598, Speaker A: And now we saw yesterday that the one extension operation preserves independence and two dimensional rigidity metroid. So f is independent in r tail. So this, this contains, so this our strategy for showing that there is a maximal abstract tray rigidity nitride is similar to grevids, but obviously it's going to be more complicated. So let's go back to gravis conjecture. So here's the conjecture, and I'd like to say something about the counterexamples. So, the first counterexample is Djoker Ngir Thurston, who I think was a student at the time, and he constructed a specific metroid, which is a counterexample to be, and then widely extended Thurston's counter example, to give us a rich and interesting family of counterexamples called the cofactor metroids. So there's a cofactor metroid for each day, and it comes from approximation theory.
00:33:44.598 - 00:34:52.653, Speaker A: It comes from the theory of vibrant spines. So Walt is showed that, that this metroid is an abstract day rigidity metroid for all day. And he also assured that the d dimensional rigidity metroid is not greater than or equal to the cofactor metroid whenever d is greater or equal to four and n is greater or equal to Joe d plus four. But I'll show you the why this is true later. But so what Walter did was he, he constructed a graph or a set of edges which is independent in this metroid and is not independent in the three dimensional rigidity. And he also modified Greuber's conjecture. So I guess given his family of counterexamples, this is straightforward, obvious, I guess.
00:34:52.653 - 00:35:44.916, Speaker A: So he conjectures that the core factor metroids are actually the unique maximum abstract de rigidity metroids for all day. Now, if you remember, Gregor showed that the rigidity meteoroids r one and r two were maximum d rigidity metriods. So I guess this implies that the one and two dimensional rigidity metroids are the same as the corresponding cofactor metroids. But that's easy to see once I tell you what these metroids are. What's more interesting is what happens when d is equal to cray. So one of the conjectures that we also have equality when d is equal to kray. So the generic three dimensional rigidity metroid is the same as the corresponding cofactor.
00:35:44.916 - 00:36:48.874, Speaker A: Abstract three rigidity metroid. This is a difficult conjecture. So let's, let's describe the cofactor nitroids. So the first thing to note is that the, the generic cofactor metroids come from a framework, but the abstract D rigidity version comes from a framework which lies in the plane for all d. And the fact that they're based on a framework which is always in the plan gives us a bit of extra layer. So we have, so to define it, we take this frame, this two dimensional framework. So it's a framework in the plane, and we denote the coordinates of any point by Xiyi.
00:36:48.874 - 00:38:00.494, Speaker A: And then for any we want, we want to end up with something which is an abstract, a rigidity metroid. So for any edge, Vijay, we define a d dimensional vector using these d polynomials which are based on the coordinates of this point in the plane. So the way we get d coordinates is we raise things to a larger power. In the generic rigidity metroid, these are all linear, the entries are all linear in coordinates. But now we have powers of the coordinates, the powers of the difference in coordinates. So given this vector, we can use it as a row in a matrix. So our matrix, which is the c d minus factor matrix, it has one row for each edge, and the entries in the row are given by this vector, so it's mostly zero.
00:38:00.494 - 00:38:55.464, Speaker A: So we order our vertices so that when I comes before j, we put this vector, and when, so under the column indexed by bi and then we put its negative in the column index by vj and this, this is a d dimensional vector. So the number of columns in our matrix is going to be d times the number of vertices. And to get the matriid, we just take, we take a generic framework in r squared and we construct this matrix and then we take the raw matriid of the generic cofactor matrix. So this gives us our d minus core factor.
00:39:00.084 - 00:39:07.904, Speaker B: Sorry, Bill, there's a question in the chat about the graver and Whiteley conjectures. Are there similar conjectures when the matroids are not built on kn.
00:39:10.004 - 00:39:42.414, Speaker A: Oh, so everything's a subgraph of k end. So in some sense you're looking at some kind of special case, some restriction of the conjecture to a special family of graphs. Offhand, I don't know anything about this. Sorry, does anybody else want to. Well, feel free. If anybody else wants to contribute over the chat, maybe, maybe Walter can say something wrong.
00:39:45.594 - 00:39:51.050, Speaker C: Also, Bill, would you mind just leaving the cofactor matroid up for a moment? This slide, this?
00:39:51.202 - 00:40:06.454, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Is that all right?
00:40:07.024 - 00:40:08.524, Speaker C: Yes, thank you.
00:40:08.984 - 00:40:13.192, Speaker A: So I put the slides up on after the talk. I'll ask Tony, to put the signs.
00:40:13.208 - 00:40:19.084, Speaker D: Up after the talk, is this related to a framework in higher dimensions?
00:40:21.304 - 00:40:24.524, Speaker A: Sorry, framework in higher dimensions, yes.
00:40:33.884 - 00:40:36.024, Speaker D: Did you have decordancy?
00:40:40.764 - 00:40:57.104, Speaker A: I guess so. This is, this comes from bivariate splines. So I guess trivariate splines exist and maybe you have a something in corresponding the Trivarius splines, but I'm not sure it will be a matrix.
00:40:58.904 - 00:41:00.416, Speaker E: Can I just say something?
00:41:00.560 - 00:41:01.484, Speaker A: Yes, please.
00:41:03.064 - 00:41:30.944, Speaker E: I started working on these because you and Belera noticed the similarity of the appearance of the matrices. So this, as stated, it doesn't relate to any kind of graph embedded in higher dimensions here, but it's the appearance of the matrices and therefore the matroids having the same patterns.
00:41:36.964 - 00:41:38.064, Speaker A: Thanks, Walter.
00:41:39.964 - 00:41:41.924, Speaker C: Some kind of Vandermonde matrix.
00:41:42.044 - 00:42:25.134, Speaker E: Yeah, van, Vandermonde appears in when you try to prove that splines have one of the interesting other properties of rigidity, namely coning going from the case with d to the case with D plus one. But it directly, I don't know Vanderma. It's only in that context. So there's a published paper looking at the analogies and some of those properties. And in a, in the book of for Jan Carlo Rode, his 64th birthday book edited by Richard Stanley.
00:42:32.314 - 00:42:37.734, Speaker B: There's another question, Bill. Is there any intuition behind the definition of d sub d?
00:42:40.714 - 00:43:20.904, Speaker A: There is intuition, but it comes from vivariate splines and I don't really have time to go into. So Walter derived these cofactor metroids by looking at bivariate splines. So we have a function defined in the plane and we want to approximate it by dividing the plane into polygon polygonal regions. And then in each polygonal region, we approximate the function by a polynomial function. And then we want the different approximations to behave smoothly as we go from region to region.
00:43:24.164 - 00:44:13.464, Speaker E: So these are the, you're writing down the coefficients of the edge between two regions and you're taking a power of it, in this case, the d minus first power of it, I guess. And the intuition in approximation theory is to have a common derivative on the two sides of this edge, certain coefficients have to become zero. So these are, it's all the intuition was already there in the work in bivariate spline. And so there's a literature we can give you references to.
00:44:16.324 - 00:44:25.224, Speaker C: When d equals two, do we just recover exactly the rigidity metroid?
00:44:26.484 - 00:45:26.054, Speaker A: Yeah. So when d equals two, we get exactly the rigidity matridge. And when d equals one, we get the adjacency matrix of the graph, which is known to be a matrix representation of the cycle matrix of the graph or the one dimensional rigidity metroid. So when d equals one, we get this is just a one dimensional vector with a one in it. So we get a one and a minus one. When d equals two, we get, as I guess, as you pointed out, we get xi minus xj and yi minus y j, and then we get the inverse. Is that okay?
00:45:30.454 - 00:45:33.954, Speaker C: Do we know about the rank functions for these matrites?
00:45:35.494 - 00:46:07.574, Speaker A: So tomorrow I'll tell you what the rank function of c two c twelve is. It's unknown. For higher values. I'll tell you what the rank is. When d equals three, it's unknown. For d greater or equal to four, and for d equals one and d equals two, it's the same as the rigidity matrix. So it's the same rank function as one dimension and two dimensional rigidity.
00:46:10.354 - 00:46:58.490, Speaker E: In approximation theory, they actually look at c to the power r and the lower thing is d. For a bigger spread than just a difference of one between the two, you have matrices. They are very interested in the ranks of some of those. And as it happens, they know the answers for c to the power r and the base d when d is bigger than or equal to eight r and four r. And they're very interested in some of the in between cases. But in between, they're not exactly matroids because you've got coefficients of the rows that are polynomials, not scalars. So there's a whole school of work doing that.
00:46:58.490 - 00:47:20.874, Speaker E: And there's a regular seminar meeting right now trying to look at the case that has stumped them for about 20 or 30 years of c 13. So that's not, that's not matroid. It's not what Bill is talking about. But there is an active research program going on on those issues.
00:47:23.694 - 00:47:50.894, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, thanks, Walter. I should have mentioned that. So it has two parameters. And if, as Walter said, if the difference is more than one, then the number of rows in the matrix corresponding to a particular age is equal to, I think, to the difference between these two parameters. So if the difference is two, then each edge will correspond to probably not that symbol. Walter. Sorry.
00:47:50.894 - 00:48:04.814, Speaker A: Let's just say if the parameters, if the difference is bigger than one, then we get more than one row corresponding to the same edge. So instead of having a matriid on the edge set, we get a polymer on the edge there.
00:48:07.214 - 00:48:18.462, Speaker E: Because the coefficients are still polynomials. It isn't a matriid. It's got multiple rows. But it isn't.
00:48:18.638 - 00:48:35.554, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm trying to say each edge corresponds to multiple rows, so a single element can have rank bigger than one. So if an edge corresponds to two rows, you could have an edge having rank two.
00:48:39.904 - 00:48:41.364, Speaker C: This is great, thanks.
00:48:43.944 - 00:48:47.152, Speaker A: Shall I move on? Sure.
00:48:47.208 - 00:48:48.672, Speaker C: Sorry to derail it.
00:48:48.848 - 00:49:51.244, Speaker A: That's all right, I prefer talking. I prefer having a conversation and then just talking by myself. So one of the lots of nice properties about the cofactor metroids way back in 96, I guess between the early nineties. So this is his fundamental survey on rigidity from 96. And so the first property I wanted to mention is he showed that the complete bipartite graph D plus D plus two is independent in the corresponding core factor. Naturally, and this is important because it's not independent in the d dimensional rigidity metroid when days greater or equal to four. This is follows from an earlier amazing result of Volcker and Rob, where they actually determine the rank of the complete bipartite graphs for all realizations, not just generic realization.
00:49:51.244 - 00:50:50.096, Speaker A: And so because Chia, d plus 2d plus two is dependent in RD and it's independent in the cofactor metroid, this means that the generic d dimensional rigidity metroid is not maximal when d squared or equal to four, and we have to have enough vertices to find copies of kd plus two, kp plus two. And then. So I'll give more information on how Walt approved this in a second. So another property is that the zero, the d dimensional zero extension operation preserves independence. And exactly the same proof that I gave yesterday works. So this is common with a dimensional rigidity measurement. One extension preserves independence.
00:50:50.096 - 00:52:31.684, Speaker A: And again the same proof that I give yesterday works. So it's, we can use, or want to use the special position argument where he puts the new vertex v on the line through the edge that we delete and then uses the fact that if we have three core linear vertices, then there form a minimal dependence set there from a circuit in this metric. So a new, an operation that we haven't seen before, which is also due to Waldner and he first used it in the d dimensional generic rigidity metroid is the idea of vertex splitting. So we have a vertex of potentially very large degree and we chose a particular set of d minus one neighbors of this vertex, and then we split the vertex into two and add an edge between the two copies of the same vertex and then join both vertices to our chosen d minus one neighbors, and then arbitrarily join some of the neighbors of v to v, some of the neighbors to the new copy of v, and other neighbors of v to v that. So here's another new operation. So this is a two extension operation, but there are various flavors of two extensions. So this one's called x replacement.
00:52:31.684 - 00:53:29.578, Speaker A: And the idea is that we have, it's going to create a vertex of degree d plus two. So we choose, in our smaller independent graph, we choose d plus two vertices and we choose two disjoint edges which are induced by these d plus two vertices. And then we add a new vertex of degree d plus two and delete the two disjoint edges. And Walter showed that that preserves independence in the cofactor Macdrive. And again, it's a neat special position argument. So this is not a very good drawing. But if you imagine choosing a generic realization of the graph, the independent graph on the left, then these two edges would not be parallel.
00:53:29.578 - 00:54:42.904, Speaker A: So there would be some point of it, because the co factor metroid lives in the plane. The two lines given by v one, v two and v three, v four would intersect somewhere and we could put v on that point of intersection and then use the circuit of size three argument for both v one, v two and v three v four to show that this was independent. So this strongly, this, this strongly uses the fact that the core factor metroids live in the plane, even that d the abstract de rigidity code and the same argument. One work for rigidity metroids which live in day space when days bigger than tunnel. So it works in two for the rigidity metroid. Exactly the same argument. But not only does the argument not work, the results not true when D is greater or equal to four.
00:54:42.904 - 00:56:13.544, Speaker A: So x replacement doesn't preserve independence in the rigidity, the d dimensional rigidity metroid when d is at least four. So x replacement is useful because it tells us that it goes back to the first property about complete bipartite graphs. So it's not so hard to say that we can construct the complete bipartite here, d plus 2d plus two from the complete graph qd plus one, which is independent by a sequence of zero, one and x replacement operations. So Walter's lemmas tell us that care d plus two, care d plus two is independent in the core factor network. Because each of these is shown, each of these operations preserve independence. So if we also combine this with the fact that here d plus 2d plus two is not dependent in the d dimensional generic rigidity by Volker and Rolf, it tells us that X replacement can't preserve independence in the d dimensional rigidity metroid when D is greater or equal to four. Because if it did, then the same argument would tell us that k date plus k date plus tail was independent.
00:56:13.544 - 00:57:12.584, Speaker A: So there's a gap here. So there's a gap between two and four. And Tierne widely in 84 conjectured that what, three is the sole occupant of this gap. And Tian Whiteley conjectured that extrapersimum does preserve independence in the trade image knowledgeability, metroid. And I think we'll say that this is an important conjecture for three dimensional rigidity because if it's false, then three dimensional rigidity is different to the corresponding core factor of judicial. And if it's true, then I think it's a good indication that the two metroids are the same, which is Waldo's conjecture.
00:57:17.804 - 00:57:45.214, Speaker C: Could I just make a quick comment, Bill? Yeah, this is Will Travis. So the argument that you gave with the X replacement with the point of intersection of the two line segments of the two lines, that suggests that syzygies among the points are an important.
00:57:47.634 - 00:57:47.946, Speaker A: Are.
00:57:47.970 - 00:58:22.438, Speaker C: An important thing to consider in these matroids. And the syzygies that I'm talking about can't be coming from some special position because we're in generic coordinate and it's generic situations. So these must be syzygies that come from the Grassmann plucker relations, these must be syzygies that come from determinants on generic matrices and things like that.
00:58:22.626 - 00:58:23.950, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
00:58:24.102 - 00:58:28.006, Speaker C: I think this could be kind of an interesting thing to explore for sure.
00:58:28.070 - 00:58:47.594, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's just that there happens to be a nice simple geometric argument for non generic points, which implies the generic result. But as you said, these things are true generically, so they must be true for a more complex reason.
00:58:51.914 - 00:58:55.854, Speaker C: That's well played. I'm always looking for the more complicated proof.
00:58:57.514 - 00:59:50.914, Speaker A: Well, sometimes that's the only proof that there is. So in fact, that leads us on to this slide. So this is the first result of Katie and Cenichi and myself. And we look at, it's not a new operation, it's a different operation, which was also considered as also being considered by Walter and Jack Graver and it's called double b replacement. So it's. We're in, if you like, we're in three dimensional generic rigidity, or we're in abstract three rigidity and we're interested in reducing a vertex of degree five. And one way to do that would be to add two disjoint edges between its neighbors.
00:59:50.914 - 01:00:38.364, Speaker A: Another way to do it would be to add a path of length two between its neighbors. So this is a more complicated operation. So we, we have a set of five vertices. And we actually have two different frameworks or two different graphs which are basically the same. Apart from these, they differ in these two parts and the two parts are different parts. And I've shown them to have an edge in common, but they could be edge disjoint. The only condition that I want on these two parts is that they don't have a common end vertex.
01:00:38.364 - 01:01:19.234, Speaker A: Sorry, they don't have a common middle vertex. So I don't want to take this path and then another path with this is a middle vertex. So we show that if this framework, generic framework is independent, this graph is independent in the core part of the metroid, and this graph is independent in the core factor metroid, then the result of deleting the edges in the paths and adding a vertex of degree five is also independent. So this was conjectured.
01:01:19.934 - 01:01:26.622, Speaker C: Sorry, Bill, when you add the vertex into grid five, is that a new vertex in the.
01:01:26.718 - 01:01:29.530, Speaker A: Yes, it's a new vertex. I should put it outside.
01:01:29.702 - 01:01:30.614, Speaker C: Got it.
01:01:33.874 - 01:02:11.470, Speaker A: Sorry. So this verifies the three dimensional cures of a conjecture of Walter. I guess Walter conjectured it in d dimension in. I guess Walter conjectured for the co factor metroid c d minus. So this proves this special case for one, two. And he also conjectured that the same operation preserves independence in the three dimensional rigidity meteorite. But he conjectures that three reals and c twelve are the same.
01:02:11.470 - 01:02:13.542, Speaker A: So this is a bit of a.
01:02:13.558 - 01:02:35.864, Speaker E: Tautology, if I can mention. Chiang Seng Tai and I both were writing a joint paper, and we conjectured that as one of the missing operations to do 3d rigidity. So Tian Seng Tae was working independently on Henneberg inductions, and as was I, and we put together some joint papers.
01:02:40.684 - 01:03:35.614, Speaker A: So our proof of this is horrendous. So it actually goes back to Will's comment, we don't know, a nice snappy wanda type geometric argument process. So instead we go back to the, what's probably the original. Oh, I forgot her name. The person who approved Lahman's theorem before Laman Polachek Geringer. So her proof that one extension preserves independence in the two dimensional rigidity radius metroid is built on algebraic independence. So the idea is that you choose a minimally rigid graph which only has rigid motions, and then you do a one extension.
01:03:35.614 - 01:04:28.712, Speaker A: And if you end up with something which is not minimally rigid, which is not independent, then it has a non rigid motion. And she shows, I think, that this non rigid motion contradicts algebraic independence. And basically that's what we do to show that this operation preserves independence in c one, two. But it's not pretty, it's an understanding. But on the other hand, in some sense it's encouraging, because as far as I know, all the other extension operations can be proved by using algebraic independence. But they have nice snappy geometric probes. So this is at least as an example, which only has a horrible probe.
01:04:28.712 - 01:05:29.394, Speaker A: But that means that probably, if it's true, that there exists things which do not which are true but do not have snapping geometric pros. So I find that encouraging. But maybe that's, that's provided where my mind works. So to finish off with, I've gone on too long, but if you let me do three more slides, I can sketch our proof that the c twelve cofactor metroid is the unique maximal abstract three rigidity nitride, and it's supposed to look like Grover's probe. So we choose a set. We chose an arbitrary abstract three rigidity nitride, and we chose a set f, which is independent in m, and we need to show that f is independent in the cofactor neutron. And we do that by induction on the size of f.
01:05:29.394 - 01:06:36.934, Speaker A: So we use Graver's result that any independent set has at most the Maxwell bound on the number of edges and it's rank is at most this. But because it's independent, its size is at most this. And then the handshaking lemur in graph theory tells us that f has a vertex of degree at most five. So the easy case is when f has a vertex of degree at most three, and that's exactly the same as gravy. So we delete v. So f is independent in m we delete v in three edges, and by the metroid axiom we end up we are still independent in n by induction we're independent in the cofactor metroid, and then by Walter's zero extension property we're independent in the cofactor metroid. For the original set we're throw by induction.
01:06:36.934 - 01:07:41.854, Speaker A: So degrade four is the same using one extension, but almost the same. So if I have a vertex of degrade four, then I can give a metroid theory argument, which the same as gravit did for one extension when he used one reduction for a vertex of degree three. Here we're using one reduction for a vertex of degrade four. So we show that we can get an independent set by dilating v and adding some edge between its neighbours. By induction we're still independent in the core factor natri, and then by Walter's result that one extension preserves independence. We get back to the original set f and we're independent in the cofactor network. The final slide is the more complicated case when b has degrade five, we start with our vertex at degree five and we want to delete it and add two edges.
01:07:41.854 - 01:09:14.304, Speaker A: And as I said before, we can either add two disjoint edges or we can add a path of length two. And we can use a similar metroid theory argument to show that because m is an abstract three rigidity matrid, either there are two disjoint edges which we can add and preserve independence, or if not, then we can add a path of length two in two different ways and preserve independence and make sure that the central vertices of these two paths are different. And then we apply induction and everything stays independent in the core factor matrix. And then if we're in disjoint edges, we apply Wanda's extra perspective result. And if we're in our two part situation, we apply our double V retracement result and we get back to f being independent in the cofactor network. So tomorrow I'll tell you what the rank function of the C twelve cofactor natural idea is. And our characterization of the rank relies heavily on us knowing that the c twelve cofactor mercury is the maximum abstract rigidity.
01:09:14.304 - 01:09:22.864, Speaker A: So we're going to use this tomorrow. So sorry for going on so long. I'll finally stop.
01:09:27.084 - 01:09:30.264, Speaker B: Thanks, Bill. Does anyone have any questions?
01:09:31.144 - 01:09:37.284, Speaker D: Yes, just a quick question. What's a snap? Can you define a snappy geometric proof?
01:09:38.784 - 01:09:43.512, Speaker A: A snap? A geometric argument. Is that what you ask? Yes.
01:09:43.568 - 01:09:46.324, Speaker D: Yes, yes. Can you define that?
01:09:47.544 - 01:09:55.444, Speaker A: Oh, one that takes less than five lines and proves something. Interesting.
01:09:58.964 - 01:10:05.384, Speaker D: But does it have a precise meaning in the sense that you use special positions or something like that?
01:10:06.924 - 01:10:25.954, Speaker A: No, it doesn't have a precise meaning. It's just me rambling on. I think. I think if you read our proof that way, replacement preserves independence, then it will show you something which is not a snappy geometric argument.
01:10:35.574 - 01:10:41.994, Speaker B: So, Bill, your proof is algebraic computer manipulations, I guess. Is it?
01:10:44.934 - 01:10:58.004, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not a computer based proof, but we used computer computer to help with the algebraic calculations. I went through it by hand.
01:10:58.784 - 01:11:11.164, Speaker B: So I guess my question is, now you've seen the sort of steps you go through with the polynomials you were working with. Can you make any sort of geometric interpretation of what your argument is?
01:11:17.484 - 01:12:26.184, Speaker A: I can't know. So to compare it with the polar Geringer argument. So the algebraic independence of the coordinates immediately implies that this non rigid motion can't exist. And the problem we have is that when we try to apply the algebraic independence of the coordinates, it tells us that some bizarre motion can exist. Now, it seemed extremely unlikely to us that it actually could exist, but it was real hard work to picture to show that it did not exist, and then it was just algebraic manipulations. Maybe Katie or Shinichi have more insight than me.
01:12:29.004 - 01:12:30.104, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
01:12:31.964 - 01:12:33.784, Speaker F: Can I ask a question, Bill?
01:12:34.084 - 01:12:35.068, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
01:12:35.236 - 01:13:16.464, Speaker F: Yeah. I have a very, I have a basic question just about abstract rigidity metroids. So if you take, if you take like matriids, if you take the rigidity of bar joint frameworks constrained to lie on surfaces, do they, are those, the matriids of those are their abstract rigidity matrix. So for example, if you take a, let's say a bar joint framework constrained to lie on a cylinder or something like that, and you look at that matrix, is that an abstract rigidity matrix?
01:13:20.484 - 01:13:51.874, Speaker A: So grabber defines them for complete graphs. So if I take a complete graph and I make sure that the, the vertices are in general position in three space, then it will have full rank and it will be an abstract rigidity metric. By full rank, I mean, it will satisfy the Maxwell band. Okay, what you're asking, Jim?
01:13:52.214 - 01:14:02.406, Speaker F: Well, no, so I'm just, I'm wondering, say. So, like, if you take, if you take the rigidity on a constrained, on a surface, right. That gives you a matriid as well, doesn't it?
01:14:02.430 - 01:14:02.566, Speaker A: Right.
01:14:02.590 - 01:14:04.314, Speaker F: On the, on the, on the complete graph.
01:14:06.534 - 01:14:09.062, Speaker B: But, but its rank won't be right for an abstract rigidity.
01:14:09.158 - 01:14:10.474, Speaker F: Oh, its rank is wrong.
01:14:11.534 - 01:14:15.150, Speaker A: So you want to take the complete graph on a cylinder.
01:14:15.182 - 01:14:15.622, Speaker F: I see, okay.
01:14:15.638 - 01:14:15.894, Speaker A: Okay.
01:14:15.934 - 01:14:19.686, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah. Okay. I think Tony answered it there.
01:14:19.710 - 01:14:37.442, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So, so I'm, I want to allow the points freedom to move the points to move freely in three space. So you can, I'm happy for you to put the points on the cylinder to start off with, and as long as they're generically on the cylinder, if.
01:14:37.458 - 01:14:38.854, Speaker F: The motions are constrained.
01:14:40.114 - 01:14:46.094, Speaker A: But I'm not happy if you start telling me the points can't move off the cylinder, because that's going to give me something different.
01:14:50.054 - 01:15:07.142, Speaker F: So then. I was so sorry. Just one follow up question. So one of the characterizations you had. I didn't know this characterization, is that an abstract reducity metroid is one where. So the KD plus one is independent and zero extensions preserve independence. Right?
01:15:07.278 - 01:15:07.994, Speaker A: Yes.
01:15:08.614 - 01:15:31.624, Speaker F: So what, I mean, can you, if you kind of arbitrarily add some graphs to the list of independent graphs that are not KD plus one. Right. So that gives you other examples of, does that create, I mean, if I said, okay, KD plus one and some other graph is independent and it's also zero, extension preserves rigidity. Will that give me a matriid.
01:15:33.404 - 01:15:36.556, Speaker A: Would it give you an abstract, well, I.
01:15:36.580 - 01:15:43.684, Speaker F: Presume it would give you an abstract rigidity. Metroid, if it gave you a metroid. Right. If I just, if I just, maybe this is something to do.
01:15:43.844 - 01:15:47.192, Speaker A: So if you say KD plus two is independent.
01:15:47.388 - 01:15:48.112, Speaker F: Yeah.
01:15:48.248 - 01:15:53.524, Speaker A: Then it won't, because that has to be a circuit. Yeah.
01:15:55.504 - 01:15:57.884, Speaker B: It wouldn't just push you up one dimension.
01:15:59.544 - 01:16:15.824, Speaker A: Yeah. If you said care D plus one, if you said care D plus two was independent, it would imply that care D plus one was independent. So it would give you an abstract day plus one with different, but can.
01:16:15.864 - 01:16:25.804, Speaker F: Can you do something like just give yourself a list of graphs and say all of these graphs are independent and zero extension preserves independence. Does that give me a metroid?
01:16:26.384 - 01:16:28.680, Speaker A: It depends what set of graphs you take.
01:16:28.832 - 01:16:32.684, Speaker F: So there is, you can't just, you can't just arbitrarily declare some set of.
01:16:39.344 - 01:16:57.964, Speaker D: What about algorithmic questions? Are you going to talk about that later? About whether you can determine whether the canonical free matriid is whether a given graph is independent?
01:16:58.864 - 01:17:35.284, Speaker A: Yes, I'll talk about that tomorrow. So we have a good characterization of the rank function. So I can give you a certificate of dependence using our characterization of the rank function. And I can give you a certificate of independence by giving you a special position independent realization. But we don't have an algorithm based on our characterization of the rank function, which will determine independence in polynomial time. So that's a big open problem.
