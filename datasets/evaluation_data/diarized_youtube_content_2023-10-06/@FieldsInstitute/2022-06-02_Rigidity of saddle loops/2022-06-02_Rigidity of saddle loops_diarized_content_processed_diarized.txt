00:00:00.320 - 00:00:17.674, Speaker A: This morning is Maya herself, who is going to explain us the rigidity of sadu of loops. And I cannot wait to hear Maya thank the organizer of this.
00:00:22.014 - 00:01:41.576, Speaker B: So, thank you. So I will omit this, but I will nevertheless, I would like to thank the organizers of the semester for inviting me here, because it's wonderful to be here for a prolonged time. So, what I would like to talk about is my joint work with Daniel Farazzolo and Louis Cecier. So it is actually, it can be found in archive. It is a preprint Daniel Farazola, whom you know from University of Strasbourg, and myself. So, first let me introduce, I mean, I suppose everybody knows, but just shortly what I mean by saddle loop. So we start from a real planner, which is a subset of r two.
00:01:41.576 - 00:02:51.002, Speaker B: So we are given, in fact three data. So it's a vector field or a form, and the neighborhood of zero had some open set and a path gamma. So the idea is that we have a vector field that has a singular point, let's say at zero. And there is, since this is a saddle point, there is attracting and repelling so stable and unstable manifold, which we suppose are connected by some gamma, which is invariant for the field, so for the flow. So this gamma is in fact invariant curve that connects a stable and unstable manifold. So, one that we have a monodronic situation, so that we have accumulation of orbits and the loop. We can define what we call a poincare map, or a first return map that is defined on some transversal, it doesn't matter which one that doesn't go through a singular point.
00:02:51.002 - 00:03:36.084, Speaker B: So let's say we have a transversal like this, and we can parameterize it so that there is this inner part of the transversal that is parameterized, for example, by s bigger than zero. And here we define a first return map. So even without parameterization, this makes sense. One that we look at the inner part of the transversal locally at the point sigma. So s is exactly the mapping which attributes. So you follow the spiral and you return. It should be another way around, so that we have attracting spiral, but okay, so to each s we attribute p of s.
00:03:36.084 - 00:04:54.294, Speaker B: So this is a Poincare map, which is in this case, if you parameterize real. So it's defined from of the zero to the neighborhood of the zero. So, to generalize the notion a little bit, we talk about so complex surfaces, foliated surfaces. That means that we have a complex or a real surface and a foliation on it, so, such that we also have a triple sg. So it's a surface and foliation that also has several points, meaning that there are two separatistes coming at that point. And we also take one of the parts that we denote gamma, which will be a smooth curve, going for example, from minus eleven to the surface, which I say close because I want it to begin and finish at the saddle point. It should be tangential to the formation that we have on the surface.
00:04:54.294 - 00:05:52.666, Speaker B: And the parts of gamma at minus one, image of gamma at minus one, and one should come to the point s along different separatistes. In a way, in higher dimensions, this mimics the notion that we have here. So the main object with. I will explain why I talk about this. So the main object that we work with is not a real saddle only, but a complex saddle. So the idea is to look at the saddles in c two, where we have separatistes, we have now c, so that transfers are again biholomorphic to c. So we are in two complex dimensions, and this we denote by z and this by omega.
00:05:52.666 - 00:06:46.354, Speaker B: So again, we have a saddle point, which is in fact, I will write it now locally at the origin we have a saddle. So let's say I will write it in this form from the beginning. So alpha is not zero, not positive, so negative real number. And here are higher order terms. And this is ratio of hyperbolicity of the cell, which can be either rational or irrational or one. So it gives us a type of a cell. And so we now have a complex saddle with transversals that are c that are not anymore lines.
00:06:46.354 - 00:07:35.604, Speaker B: And the idea is to somehow, again, take the foliation defined by this field around the cell and then to glue the separatist. So if we do it, no, alpha is real and alpha is real. It's real and positive. I mean, there are some generalizations with alpha complex, but I'm not sure I would know how to. No. Yeah, alpha is always in r minus. So z and w are complex.
00:07:35.604 - 00:08:53.534, Speaker B: Okay, so the idea is to somehow, at least topologically, glue the separatistes and to form too complex surface. But the problem is that in the case of real real surface, one can do that, and then using Grauer's embedding theorem, somehow put it so it would be too real surface, but it can be also embedded in r two. So one can realize the loop by gluing. So taking the saddle, gluing the transversals to get this regular mapping here, gluing them by regular my analytic mapping, and then use the embedding theorem to put it in the plane so one can realize, in fact, the loop in the plane. In the complex case. We cannot use that. So I stick with this abstract complex surface that is given by a complex saddle that has, I will explain later, its corner map and foliation around, singular foliation around.
00:08:53.534 - 00:09:39.554, Speaker B: And then we specify another regular map, complex regular map, which would move the two transversals. So that's why I introduce the notion of abstract fan loop, which we denote by f and r. I will explain what this is. So, f is, in fact, a prepared saddle defined around the origin of c. Two prepared means in some standard normal form, which is usually pancreas black normal form. This is known. I will write it as.
00:09:39.554 - 00:10:49.884, Speaker B: So this first other terms vanish. So we can analytically transform by analytic, by holomorphic map, the foliation around the zero, the field around zero, to a simpler form of this type, where this can be made. This is usually of the type z, k, y plus, et cetera, or can even be made z, y plus, et cetera. But it's not important at this point. So, in some prepared form that is analytically conjugated to our field, what is actually important is on which u, on which neighborhood of the origin in c two, we now define it. So this is, in fact, we call that prepared neighborhood of the origin. But actually, the idea behind it, it is some like, let's say I will write like this.
00:10:49.884 - 00:11:33.648, Speaker B: It will be clearer. So it's a domain of this form. So the idea is that it's somehow like a hyperbola, but in higher dimension. And why? Because actually, we have a field defined only locally at zero. So we have a single foundation locally at zero. And we have to ensure that, in fact, any two points that we take in this U can be connected by a path on this foliation. Because what happens in complex case.
00:11:33.648 - 00:12:45.056, Speaker B: So in complex case, we have everything complex and complex time also. So what happens is that these curves that are usually not connected here will, in complex case, connect in a leaf in a way that. So we start at some point here, and now there is a leaf reaching leaf like a curve, but in more dimensions, the solution reaching this transversal. But what can happen is that it can also circle any of the separatistes and come back to the same transversal by what is called monodrome, your holonomy map. So what I wanted to say that it's that the Dulac map, the corner map from here to here, becomes sort of multivalued. Not only because it's logarithmic in some cases, but really because a complex saddle, geometry, complex saddle that allows holonomy. So we can to explain it a little bit better, I can start with this linearized case.
00:12:45.056 - 00:13:30.594, Speaker B: I omit the remainder. And if we write the first integral of this, we get. So it's like a solution curve. So that when I put this equal to some complex number, this gives us leaves or solution curves. And now imagine that we want to compute a dulac map, what we call a dulac map. I chose one transversal. Let's say this transversal will be at v equal to one, and the other transversal will be at z equal to one, but it will be a complex plane.
00:13:30.594 - 00:14:18.594, Speaker B: So let's say that we take a point. This is parameterized, for example, by this matrix. So by then, and I can take point z one, and dulash map will guide me to another transversal one. And what I want is this corner map. So if we try, if we, if we take our vector field and try to compute this map, the good idea would be this is linearized. Good idea will be to solve it. And then we, for example, get z of t is equal to z zero e of t.
00:14:18.594 - 00:14:47.504, Speaker B: This is simple. So I'm not, I'm just solving the first equation. If we want to start at t equals to zero at the point z one, then z of zero is z. The z that I start here. So I actually get at zero. Z is equal to the point z at which I start. Maybe I should have put z zero, but it's some point that is somewhere here.
00:14:47.504 - 00:15:27.314, Speaker B: Okay, so we see, if we want to reach this transversal, what time do we need? We need time until z becomes one. So we want to solve. And what actually happens is that we get complex logarithm as a solution. So, in fact, I can explain like this. So this is a complex thing. So it's not only log z that we get, but log z e to the two PI I k. So actually we can get log z plus two PI I k sin.
00:15:27.314 - 00:16:25.924, Speaker B: And what happens now that we solve this equation? Equation, sorry, maybe minus one. Yes, because sure, it's around zero, so it has to be k. So by, so each determination of this dual corner map is given by this circling in time for two PI I. Okay, so we have infinitely many times on the same leaf that we return to the same transverse. And you can also see directly by computing DulaC map, either using dispersion integral, because it has to stay on the same solution curve along the, when you move by Dulac map or by solving the equation completely. But I'm not going to do that. Now, I may just write that in this case we get d of z.
00:16:25.924 - 00:17:23.340, Speaker B: It begins with z, alpha plus, etcetera. In the case where alpha is a rational number, we will get logarithmic terms also due to this logarithmic time. And when it is irrational, then we will get just powers. So, these are two types of block germs that we consider. Okay, we don't request here that real line is preserved, that we come from the real saddle. So really complex saddle in all its generality, except that alpha is r minus. So what I wanted to explain is this domain, the idea behind this domain is that what I said, any two points that I take in this four dimensional ultimate, there should be a path in the foliation that connects them.
00:17:23.340 - 00:18:14.764, Speaker B: Why I say that? Because imagine that you start here and you want to do few complex turns. So you go along the leaf, do some complex terms, and come back to this leaf. This may lead you outside your domain. So if you increase the number of the turns that you want to make, you have to begin closer and closer to zero. So it's not here. You have to diminish this size of the domain to be able to do more and more turns. And this is in fact in the reason why Dulag germ is defined on a standard quadratic domain.
00:18:14.764 - 00:18:52.392, Speaker B: When you do a holonomy, you jump from one determination to the other. You have to decrease the size. So to stay in this neighborhood. So, okay, so, I mean, we have f and we have u, and we have to specify another thing. And this is r. But once that I have defined f, I have, as I have explained dulac germs. So these corner maps defined, so, but they are multi valued because of everything that I explained.
00:18:52.392 - 00:19:43.618, Speaker B: So we may take any determination of, we cannot do a canonical thing. If we had a real saddle, we can request that it maps real line to the real line, and that we stay in one determination. But here we cannot, and we may specify any determination of the dulagh. There is no canonical choice. So that's why we don't work with really dulac maps, but with sort of a class of dulac maps where we, I have to repeat a little bit. So I will take this transversal omega. I will write it as line, but it's a complex omega.
00:19:43.618 - 00:20:06.626, Speaker B: So omega, omega. So this is this first transversal, which is on the horizontal separatrix and then there is on the vertical separatrix, another one. This I choose freely. So let's say this is fixed. We can put it always at one. And this I chose freely. So this is fixed.
00:20:06.626 - 00:21:58.096, Speaker B: And this is sort of floating transversal. And what we do is we take Dulagh maps, where we allow the transversal to move. So what actually happens if I move a transversal? There is again, until it's, if it stays inside the domain, there is again Dulac map defined on this another transversal. And what is the relation? The relation is holonomy, or let's say parallel transport between these two transversals. So what we do, we take as maps, corner maps, all these which go from, let's say they may start here and I reverse a little orientation, but sigma, so that this is floating, so that we may compose d via holonomy, defined by the saddle that connects transversal, let's say sigma to transversal, sigma prime. So another way to specify d is to say that it has its guiding path. So it means, in fact, that we take one point on this transversal and one point, yeah, we take one point on this transversal, and we look at the paths that reach this transversal.
00:21:58.096 - 00:22:45.464, Speaker B: They can be many because of monodromy. But I choose one, and I say one that I have chosen a part. I have a uniquely defined dulac germ that is defined by a transport along the foliation following this path. In the foliation, the path can also be specified, projecting only on the axis. But I say it's a path on foliation going from one point to one transversal. And these ones that I have specified, this guiding path, I have a unique choice. If I change a guiding path to go around and to reach the transversal, again, I have another determination of the luck.
00:22:45.464 - 00:23:38.706, Speaker B: And in this way, also, if we have two horizontal transversals, I can also say, if I take this point, I have one parallel here, there is no singular point. So we have a sort of parallel transport up to this transversal. So this is my holonomy map. So what I specify is in fact the whole bunch of black maps that correspond to all guiding parts and changes of this transversal. And on the other hand, this r, with which we have to connect the remainder of the saddle to the loop. This would be a holomorphic map. So holomorphic map also has to admit this shift.
00:23:38.706 - 00:24:51.084, Speaker B: So on the other hand, it should be ones that we say it's d. And then r. R should be somehow made in a class of equivalence by conjugating by holonomy transports from the other side. So what I now have is a class of these and class of rs, which give me sort of class of Poincare maps that I know by Poincare, and which are in fact all combinations of R and D, where we choose either this or this or some other floating transversal. In this way, we conjugate R and D from two sides, so it's not somehow. And we also may choose different determinations corresponding to different turnings around the saddle of Dulac map, ones that we go from here to here. So, okay, so this is the class.
00:24:51.084 - 00:25:47.074, Speaker B: Another thing that I wanted to say, that the lagmaps, as I have already mentioned, are either of this form or have logarithmic terms. I will specify the series, but we have seen it already a few times, a bit later. But in fact, they contain logarithms in the case of rational saddle point. So we are forced, we cannot say that they are well defined on this transversal. They are well defined on a cut transversal because they have a logarithmic term. But actually where they were defined is a Riemann surface of the logarithm. Or if you go with this standard quadratic domain in the logarithmic chart, back by exponential math, but in the sense that it is bijective, it will give you a Riemann surface that somehow starts here and then gets smaller and smaller and smaller like this.
00:25:47.074 - 00:26:49.464, Speaker B: So they are defined either in the logarithmic chart on this domain or on domains in the original Z chart here. And they are multivariate. Also, this r, which is a holomorphic map, can be linked to the universal cover, which is a Riemann surface that does not diminish. But the lifts are the same at every level because it's a regular map. While with DulAc, with every lift of the segment of the strip of two PI I, we will change the mapping, okay? Because it's multivalued and it actually corresponds to this choice of determination. Once that I go up, I start here, I go up, I go by a Dulac germ here and return back. It's not the same determination as the one that is done here.
00:26:49.464 - 00:28:08.734, Speaker B: So what we do is that we suppose transversals are universal covers. So they are, in fact in the logarithmic charts. In the logarithmic chart, universal cover of a surface, where dulac math is defined is actually the standard quadratic domain of inashenko. So I will write it in a more precise, in a more precise way. So rp is, as I have said, r composed by d, where we have some equivalence loss here and here and p of. So normally we write a dark map, as we all know, in, in this form, let's see, alpha I, where these are somehow increasing to infinity. So this is a Dulac germ that goes like corner central map, and this is some regular map composing.
00:28:08.734 - 00:28:54.710, Speaker B: Then we get sequence asymptotic. So a germ defined on a standard quadratic domain. For example, at the beginning it is a circle without this cut, but it can be also imagined as Riemann surface of the logarithm. So the universal cover, or this is z variable. And then we look in the Psi variable, which is log z, which gives us universal cover of this type, maybe. Yeah. Okay, so I passed to this coordinate because here I have like a map that is well defined and polymorphic on complex plane.
00:28:54.710 - 00:29:53.596, Speaker B: So this is a usual thing. So we get some of the form. So, powers are turned to exponentials and logarithms, two powers, this is a polynomial, these are bigger than one and infinitely increasing. This a is in fact this alpha. So it's in R minus, no, it's minus log. So it's bigger than zero, it's in R plus and b is e to the minus a. So what we have is that this a is always bigger than zero.
00:29:53.596 - 00:31:18.378, Speaker B: This can be a complex number, because we have a complex saddle and it can be, so it has real part of. Now, depending if this is zero or not zero, this will have modulus, either one or not. And if it has modulus one, this would correspond to this a. No, I think I did it in the wrong direction. This. So, okay, and now if a real part of b is equal to zero, then we have a of modulus one, which corresponds to what we call if alpha is equal to one invariant case. If alpha is bigger or smaller than one, then we have what we call a hyperbolic or strongly contracting or strongly repelling case.
00:31:18.378 - 00:32:12.164, Speaker B: So cases alpha bigger than one or smaller than one, then we look at the inverse cases a. Cases a bimodulus different than one, we call hyperbolic. They give us some sort of stronger contraction, as is the case with analytic germs. If you have z to the square or one half z, it's somehow contracting faster than if you have z plus. So, case, where b, where real part of b is equal to zero, will correspond to invariant case. And in the special case, when a is equal to one, it's called the parabolic case. So we actually.
00:32:12.164 - 00:33:04.854, Speaker B: So, okay, so this kind of the germs that are defined on a standard quadratic domains and expand in a series like this, as my standard work of inyashenko, they form a group. And also to this group, we can attribute formal group that corresponds to their asymptotic expansions. So this is sort of dwark group of germs like this. And this will denote the group of their formal series.
00:33:09.494 - 00:33:12.470, Speaker A: What is real and what is complex. So a is real.
00:33:12.622 - 00:33:31.996, Speaker B: A is real. No, no, no, sorry. A is complex, alpha is real. Alpha is the ratio of hyperbolicity of the saddle. Little a is real. Yes. All the others are coefficient.
00:33:31.996 - 00:33:51.284, Speaker B: So we don't request any. If it comes from the real saddle, you are in a better situation. You can request the coefficients to go to be real. But no, no, no. In just general. No, no. Because you don't ask that the real line is preserved.
00:33:51.284 - 00:35:20.300, Speaker B: What is complexified is a vector field. I mean, but I admit, in the further expansions, complex coefficients also. Okay, so, okay, okay, so, okay. So now I come to the question that we actually, I will say the problem that we try to solve. So, one thing that I will not go into details now is that sort of conjugation of abstract subtle loops. Here, analytic conjugation, like conjugation of which preserves, like the femorphism that preserves foliation, will correspond to the analytic conjugation of their concrete mfs. This is first statement that we prove is that to conjugate these abstract channel loops to make equivalence class with respect to a different morphism, it will be the same as if you take one representative of its large germs.
00:35:20.300 - 00:36:10.414, Speaker B: So you choose one d and one r, one choice of transversal sigma, one choice of v, one choice of r, and you conjugate them by an analytic germ, in the sense of conjugation. So actually equivalence of foliation will transmit to conjugation of Poincare return maps. And then we pose a question. Are there, is there usually there is a difference in, for example, analytic germs between formal and analytic classes. So, formal classification will not imply analytic classification. It is the thing that we saw, for example, for parabolic germs, that actually formal class is defined by two numbers. But analytic classes are given by the Sikal Voronin moduli.
00:36:10.414 - 00:37:01.994, Speaker B: So there are infinitely many analytic classes. So analytical classes are very, it's a much, much more precise data on a different morphism. So here what we prove if we have a Poincare map of this form. So I will say it as a theorem, as a rigidity result. Once that you have a Poincare and you have another funkar MF. So you have one saddle and another abstract cell, and if you have two germs like this, and if you conjugate them formally. So this means that phi hat is a formal diphomorphic series.
00:37:01.994 - 00:37:56.082, Speaker B: So it's a formal defomorphism. I don't admit terms of logarithm type. It's really an analytic series because we want to mimic the conjugation of the foliation, where we don't allow logarithms. So it's really analytic, formal, analytic conjugacy of the type Taylor, Taylor, formal, not Taylor, because we don't know any convergence, but power series of integer type. Okay. And once that we have this for two maps like this, what we can conclude that Phi hat is actually analytic germ. This is originality.
00:37:56.082 - 00:38:52.516, Speaker B: Formal classes become the same as analytic classes. So in a previous work with Famao, we tried to conjugate two Dulac germs in a class of trans series. So in fact, we admit here also ramified germs, also with Jean Philippe. And then we saw that actually formal conjugacy and analytic conjugacy are completely different. So formal is very short. There are short three data that gives you a formal class, while in the analytic class we have the whole spectrum of a Calvaron in moduli again, but that's because we admit ramified conjugations. Here we ask only analytic or integer power conjugations.
00:38:52.516 - 00:40:06.144, Speaker B: And by this we somehow make situation rigid, because even formal classes are now big, but they are same as analytic in a way. So this is the main result. So I don't have another ten minutes, so let me tell you a few words about how we actually do it. So, so what we define here, I mentioned that what we, that in the, in the situation of complex settle, we have the thing that we call a holonomy map. I will try to illustrate it on. So we have a term described here, and we have a logarithmic chart with. So in every.
00:40:06.144 - 00:40:58.944, Speaker B: What actually happens for the dynamics of this germ? I cannot go into details. Now, the dynamics of this germ will look somehow like this. So we have, if I write it in the original, in the original Z chart, we have sectors which are attractive and repelling for the dynamics. If we look at the screen, dynamics similarly, as in the case of for example, parabolic, analytic germs. And then, because we have infinite surface, they start overlapping and they go up and down. So there are not only just two petals and then we finish, or three petals and we finish, but we somehow have infinitely many above and below.
00:40:59.564 - 00:41:01.852, Speaker A: These petals belong to the ribbon surface.
00:41:02.028 - 00:42:11.648, Speaker B: Yes, they are here. So they intersect here. So this is, for example, attracting. It intersects with repelling and so on. So, and what is actually holonomy. So what we have for these germs is that if we take the large germ b, and if we pass, if we pass to the next sheet, if we lift by a decimal two PI I plus or e two PI I times z is the same as doing a holonomy map of the log germ. So we usually write it in these coordinates where, let's say big d becomes small d, and it's expressed in this coordinate so that we have really a holomorphic germ on this domain.
00:42:11.648 - 00:43:45.112, Speaker B: And therefore we have, and therefore we have, d times tau is equal to holonomy times d times. So the idea is this will be, for example, the first determination, the first one that does not circle. Let's say if you choose one of the determinations of the LaCMA, then you reach the transversal, for example, here you make its homonymy, and by that your effect arrive at another determination of a Dulagh germ. So it means here that if you start with a point here and here you have a dulag germ defined, it leads to, for example, here, then you can first make a. You can first. So the idea is that you go, yes, you have these zero here and you have a holonomy after that. That brings you to another, another sheet.
00:43:45.112 - 00:45:08.414, Speaker B: And now this, if you go by to my direct two PI, I shift here and then h times d. This is d one. First you apply to. And then you apply. So, I mean, what it means that you can either go with, with d zero. So this is one determination, or you can go with the holonomy map to the next sheet and come back down. It will be the same as if you take another determination on the other sheet.
00:45:08.414 - 00:45:54.194, Speaker B: So basically, this is the relation that holds. So we don't call this map a holonomy map, but we call it variation. So actually, once that you have a germ defined because this d one and d zero is artificial, is the same d because it's defined everywhere. But it's just annotation for d on different levels. So our variation is a germ that corresponds to this holonomy map. So instead of holonomy, we write variation. And our variation is therefore defined as, as le bracket of Dulac germ.
00:45:54.194 - 00:46:51.194, Speaker B: And it represents holonomy, which I tried to explain not very successfully, but I mean, it's this relation. And then you regard this as a variation, and everything is regarded in this lifted surface. So actually how your car. So now if this variation of a germ d is equal to identity, this would mean that your germ d has the same levels everywhere, and it comes by lifting an analytic germ. So if variation of d is zero, then you have actually a lift of a diphelomorphism. If your variation of b is identity, identity. If your variation is, now, so if this is the case, then d is a list of deeper morphism.
00:46:51.194 - 00:48:26.830, Speaker B: Now you go to the next level. Now you ask that variation is a different morphism. Once if you ask a variation to be a different, you get that d can be realized as a blackmap of a complex saddle, a corner map of a complex channel. Why? So once the v is projection of this, so is this a morphism? It says that this, that this d is in fact this corner map of complex cells. Why is that? Because variation corresponds to holonomy, and one that you specify a holonomy on a transversal. By a procedure given by Matay mussoor, you can somehow construct the, based on these parts that I described, and lifting of the parts, you can somehow give the saddle that will realize this diphomorphism as its holonomy map. So in complex saddles, holonomy maps that are monodromy maps of some transversals are always parabolic or hyperbolic or other endomorphisms, but are always analytic dipomorphisms.
00:48:26.830 - 00:49:39.848, Speaker B: So this is the way how we characterize D. So basically the statement here is we, if we have two Poincare maps that are composed by the lux of the saddle, so, which corresponds to a subgroup of p above, because we really want them to be realized as the luck of the saddle composed by R. And this is more general, but this is more general. This can be, I mean, it can be a few of the saddles together, or even not realizable. But if we ask only that we take v of the saddle, so characterized by variation, equal variation in this class, and compose it by a regular mat lifted, this will give us a class that we consider. And in this class we actually have this rigidity result. So I think, I mean, in the hyperbolic case, it is based on a result we use actually result of my PhD in Tamara's PhD student Dino.
00:49:39.848 - 00:51:09.652, Speaker B: Maybe he will talk something about that later. But in the parabolic case, we actually use the fact that once that you have a formal conjugacy between two p's like this, if you have a formal conjugacy of two like this, what actually happens is that we take variation. We take a holonomy or variation operator to whole equation, and variation behaves well with respect to conjugation. So what happens is that one holonomy and the other holonomy of the cell. So one or the other is conjugated by the same formal series. So now these are parabolicisms. If we are in parabolic case, and that means that these phi Hect are not only power series, but are in some generic loss depending on the multiplicity of both holonomies.
00:51:09.652 - 00:51:58.784, Speaker B: So both holonomies will have the same multiplicity. This is a known result for the saddle, but the residual invariants. So the other formal invariants will be in a short reciprocal, sorry, reciprocal. One is rho and one is one minus rho. So it's actually based on the fact that group generated by these g and h is not Monica is not generated by one by one by one germ. And in this case, we managed to prove that this has to be at the same time, let's say k one summable and k two summable, which implies analyticity. So this is actually the main idea of.
00:52:04.084 - 00:52:44.284, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Any comments? Question? Maybe just one question. So this hypothesis that you have a complex set of, that you have this alpha negative, I can understand that somehow you need real part of alpha negative. I think it should work.
00:52:45.104 - 00:53:02.876, Speaker B: Yeah. I said I am not able to answer because I know there is a possibility of generalizing, but we didn't do it. So I haven't looked for a long time. I don't know, for complex alphas, actually, in some cases it is the same.
00:53:02.900 - 00:53:13.588, Speaker A: What I believe is that kind of. If it is the real part, which is something important, because. So if the real part is negative, I think it should go exactly the same.
00:53:13.636 - 00:53:15.224, Speaker B: I think. Yeah, there is some.
00:53:15.644 - 00:53:19.434, Speaker A: If it is positive and it's different.
00:53:21.014 - 00:53:27.314, Speaker B: I mean, I cannot answer correctly. I know there is some. I can generalize a little, but I.
00:53:33.014 - 00:53:49.834, Speaker A: Any other question or comments? So let's again, we resume at, well, a quarter to eleven.
