00:00:00.760 - 00:00:12.550, Speaker A: Okay, let's begin the next talk. Our speaker is Cameron McCombs from Dartmouth College, and he will tell us about his index families of f continuous operators on bl two m. It is all yours. Take it away.
00:00:12.702 - 00:00:54.152, Speaker B: Thank you. And I want to again thank the organizers for having a conference this great allowing me to be here and give a talk. I've never been to Toronto before and I'm loving it. I don't know, the vibes here just pretty great, right? Anyway, so let's get started. I want to talk today about what I'm calling these f continuous operators and how they relate to index theory. And so I want to start with this description of the problem that kind of motivated this work. And this comes from TN Singer's fourth index paper where they define a family's index for families of elliptic pseudo differential operators.
00:00:54.258 - 00:00:54.988, Speaker C: Okay?
00:00:55.156 - 00:01:32.264, Speaker B: So in doing so, they talk about having a continuous family of operators associated to a fiber bundle, right? And the reason for this is kind of, you know, I could just have a continuous family of operators where I just say I want it to be continuous in the operator norm, right? And if you ask for that, maybe, maybe you could try to define a family's index for a family that's only like strongly continuous or something like that, but that turns out to be too weak of a condition. But just being continuous, the operator norm is actually too strong. So you can weaken it a little bit with this fiber bundle construction.
00:01:32.304 - 00:01:32.884, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:33.864 - 00:02:22.304, Speaker B: So once you do this, though, you kind of end up with a couple questions. One, my operators are now on each fiber l, two, of zy, so they're not even on the same space. So what do I mean for this to be continuous? Well, because it's a fiber bundle, I'm going to locally trivialize, and I would like this to be continuous under local trivializations. And herein lies kind of the meat here that we need to get into because once you start talking about local trivializations, you have like weird problems. So I want to start with this example. So maybe the easiest kind of construction I can have is a fiber bundle where a trivial bundle, right? S one, cross s one. So the space that I'm on is the circle and the fibers of the circle.
00:02:22.304 - 00:03:26.744, Speaker B: And if I define these diffeomorphisms that are just rotation by t, and I conjugate this multiplication operator where I'm multiplying by this indicator function on some interval, I want to ask that this is continuous in the operator norm under any trivialization. So if I just leave things alone, like I don't like trivialize the bundle at all, because it's already a trivial bundle. Of course this is going to be continuous in the operator norm. All of the, my family of operators are all the same, right? M chi I. However, if I choose a different trivialization, I trivialize by this conjugation of diffeomorphisms right here. And I ask the question again, is this going to be continuous in the operator norm? Well, if I do a little bit of algebra, it turns out that this is the same as just asking what's the supremum norm of this function right here. And because I'm rotating a little bit, I'm always going to have an interval where one of the functions is on and the other one is off.
00:03:26.744 - 00:04:30.634, Speaker B: So this is actually not continuous right here at the origin, which is what I've showed, it's actually not continuous anywhere. And so this is kind of a weird issue problem, right? I've given an example of a constant family associated to a fiber bundle, but it's not continuous under this local trivialization. So this is like really like what can go wrong when you're trying to assign a family of operators to a fiber bundle, right? So how do we fix it? Well, again, I want this to work under any local trivialization that I have. And kind of the key factor here is that if I want to go from local trivialization to local trivialization, it's going to end up like they're going to differ by this conjugation of diffeomorphism. So it's no coincidence that in the previous example right there, I was conjugating by this family of diffeomorphisms. So we'll kind of make the clearest definition. I'll say that an operator is f continuous.
00:04:30.634 - 00:05:41.760, Speaker B: If for any smooth family of diffeomorphism indexed by r, this map right here, this conjugation by diffeomorphism is continuous in the operator norm, right? And as an example, if I take a multiplication operator by a continuous function g, then that kind of resolves this problem. And you might be able to guess that from the picture. So real briefly, I just want to say like, you know, in the definition I index by r, but that's actually not a problem, right? It turns out that you can index by r in, or you can index because it's a local, you know, continuity property. You can also index by a manifold or something like that. And this is just because if I have families of diffeomorphisms indexed by r, I can build families of diffeomorphisms indexed by rn and vice versa. Right? So they all end up giving you the exact same class of operators. So here, I just want to kind of have my key detail here.
00:05:41.760 - 00:06:43.426, Speaker B: Like why is this conjugation of operators important? Well, like I said earlier, if I want to go between trivializations of my fiber bundle, it's really just by a simple trick, you know, just conjugating by diffeomorphisms of m, right, the fiber. So like that is the key property of f continuity. That's why this conjugation shows up. And it's why this is kind of the right notion to be talking about for a continuous family associated to a fiber bundle. And luckily for us, it turns out that because of this connection right here, you only have to check if you have a family of f continuous operators, you only have to check that it's norm continuous under a single trivialization. And then I'll guarantee that it's norm continuous for any other trivialization. So something interesting about this class of operators is that it actually forms c star algebra.
00:06:43.426 - 00:07:09.030, Speaker B: And you can show this with just a little bit of work. Um, I prove it directly. Um, I don't want to get bogged down any of the details. Um, so, you know, I guess the, you know, obvious interesting question here is what does this c star algebra contain? Um, so you can show that, uh, the compact operators are in this. I've already showed that multiplication operators are in this.
00:07:09.222 - 00:07:09.934, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:10.094 - 00:08:36.194, Speaker B: Um, it turns out that if you have an operator that takes smooth functions to smooth functions, and if I take the bracket of this operator with any vector field, it extends to a bounded linear operator, then this also gives me an operator that is f continuous. This is important. This is a key thing that pseudo differential operators of order zero do. You can show that this set, the pseudo differential operators of order zero is a subset of c star of m, and the closure of that is also in the sea star because it's a c star algebra, right? This is good because, you know, in a TNsinger family index, right? You want to look at the family of elliptic pseudo differential operators, right? So it's a good thing that these things are actually in here, right? Okay. So I want to kind of, you know, take this and link it back to index theory, right? So just as a little bit of a review, a Fredholm operator is one that has finite dimensional kernel and its adjoint has finite dimensional kernel. And you can calculate the index just by taking the difference of the dimensions of those two kernels. And so for a single operator, it's kind of determined exactly by the kernel of the operator in the kernel of its adjoint.
00:08:36.194 - 00:09:09.134, Speaker B: As we move to families of operators, we want this to be true as well. We want the index to be kind of defined by the kernel of the family and the kernel of the adjoint of the family. So we also want to kind of introduce, so I want to introduce vector bundle k theory here, because if I have a family of kernels, the hope would be that it forms a vector bundle. And so that seems to be the kind of natural way to extend this to a family of operators.
00:09:09.214 - 00:09:09.834, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:10.814 - 00:10:15.694, Speaker B: Okay. So if I want to do this, I want to say that I can define a families index for f continuous families of operators. And all I mean by that is that every operator is f continuous, and it's also continuous under some trivialization, right? Once you have those two things, as long as you have Fredholm operators in your family, then you can define an index. And so what I've written down here, if you have kind of this extraordinary case where all of the kernels are finite dimensional, then all of the kernels are the same dimension, then of course they form a vector bundle. It's not too hard to see that. Now, in the Atiya singer construction, this works for families where the vector bundles do not have the same dimension. And to fix that problem, you just kind of add things from the kernel of the adjoint over to the kernel until it kind of balances out everywhere.
00:10:15.694 - 00:10:59.886, Speaker B: And so this works for my f continuous families of operators. You can define a family's index in the same way that a TNsinger defined their family's index. And of course, if you happen to have a family of elliptic pseudo differential operators, the index that I define here matches that index exactly. There's just a slight generalization. What I want to do now is link this to Caesar algebraic k theory. So, just a little bit of a review. Anyways, so we have k groups.
00:10:59.886 - 00:11:46.480, Speaker B: They form cyclic six term exact sequence. If you look at a unit oc star algebra a, and it's ideal. I don't really want to get bogged down too much in the details of what k naught and k one are. It's important that k one has invertibles in it, right? And so if I have this ideal j, then there is a homomorphism called the index map that maps from k one of a mod j to k zero of j. And this is of course, very suggestive naming. So I want to just take a little bit of time and show that if I take this short exact sequence of Cesar algebras, of course, the compact operators are an ideal of b of h. And I, you know, try to calculate the index.
00:11:46.480 - 00:11:54.544, Speaker B: It turns out that, one, you can only calculate the index if your operator is Fredholm, because that's when you have that, this is invertible.
00:11:54.704 - 00:11:55.480, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:55.672 - 00:12:08.824, Speaker B: And two, if you kind of follow this chain of isomorphisms here under Merida equivalents, you can actually show that the index that you get from the index map is exactly the index of the Fredholm operator.
00:12:08.944 - 00:12:09.604, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:10.084 - 00:13:01.686, Speaker B: Okay. So our hope would be that we can generalize this to the case that we have with our family's index. And as it turns out, thanks to Dixmier, you can show that if I look at all the fibers and I take c star of Zy, for each of the fibers, they actually form fibers themselves of a continuous field of C star algebras. And this is just like a bundle of C star algebras. So I can take the continuous sections as defined by Dixmier here. And because Y is compact, this actually forms a C star algebra in and of itself, that I'll denote C star of zy. So now if I take kind of the compact analog of this, the compact operators from, sorry.
00:13:01.686 - 00:13:29.478, Speaker B: So I have this other C star algebra where every fiber is, you know, the compact operators on l, two of zy, this actually forms an ideal in C star zy. So I can again take a look at this short exact sequence. I again have another chain of isomorphisms where here my k naughts, right. My compact operators on zy is meridian equivalent not to c, but to the continuous functions on Y, because you have c for each fiber.
00:13:29.526 - 00:13:30.114, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:31.134 - 00:13:37.294, Speaker B: And so again we get another isomorphism now to the k theory of y vector bundle wise.
00:13:37.414 - 00:13:38.150, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:38.342 - 00:13:59.912, Speaker B: And so if you calculate this index for this family of f continuous operators in the C star algebra, again, it matches exactly what you would hope for. It gives you the families index that was defined earlier. It's over 205, right?
00:14:00.008 - 00:14:00.712, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:00.888 - 00:14:39.418, Speaker B: So then I guess maybe quickly. Yeah. I would like to say one more thing. I was kind of hoping here that it would be easy to calculate the index of this family from the C star algebra itself, C star Zy. However, you know, because if you do it back in the one object case, then you can use the polar decomposition, and that gives you a partial isometry, and that lists very easily to a unitary here. It's not so simple, because if you try to form the partial isometry, it's not actually an f continuous family. And so it doesn't work the right way.
00:14:39.418 - 00:14:53.446, Speaker B: And what I guess that's telling us is that you really do need to kind of mimic the Attia singer construction of balancing out the kernels, in this case, by injecting this into a larger C star algebra, in order for this to work.
00:14:53.590 - 00:14:55.550, Speaker C: Right. Okay.
00:14:55.702 - 00:14:56.654, Speaker B: Thank you, everyone.
00:14:56.694 - 00:14:57.214, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
