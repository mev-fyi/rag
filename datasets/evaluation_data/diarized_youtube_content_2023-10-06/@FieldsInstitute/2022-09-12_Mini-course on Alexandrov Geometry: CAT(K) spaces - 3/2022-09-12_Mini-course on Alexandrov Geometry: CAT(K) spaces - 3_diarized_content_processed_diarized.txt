00:00:08.280 - 00:00:09.020, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:09.614 - 00:00:17.670, Speaker B: All right, so this is the last of the three lectures that Alexander is doing on the spaces with Karachi bounded above.
00:00:17.782 - 00:00:18.766, Speaker A: It's part three.
00:00:18.870 - 00:00:20.510, Speaker B: Please, Alexander, go ahead.
00:00:20.702 - 00:00:25.314, Speaker C: So, thank you very much. We proceed.
00:00:29.754 - 00:00:30.202, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:30.258 - 00:00:33.514, Speaker C: So I'm going to talk about special.
00:00:33.594 - 00:00:36.634, Speaker A: Class of spaces with curvature bound above.
00:00:36.674 - 00:01:03.284, Speaker C: In this class, yeah. So this is a class in which one can say something about topology so much more than in general. So for general spaces with curvature bounded above, one can hardly say something but that they, so they have some dimension, and in this top dimension, one can find some euclidean subsets which are not open in it.
00:01:03.324 - 00:01:07.996, Speaker A: But, yeah, topologically, but one cannot say more.
00:01:08.100 - 00:01:22.130, Speaker C: So in the class of spaces I'm going to talk about, they have similarities with Alexander spaces. So the definition we call the space geodesically complete, if no geodesic terminates in it.
00:01:22.162 - 00:01:27.434, Speaker A: So if something like this does not.
00:01:27.474 - 00:01:32.802, Speaker C: Happen, so that you start with a geodesic, it runs, and then it comes to a point and cannot be extended.
00:01:32.978 - 00:01:36.570, Speaker A: As a local geodesic, say, so this.
00:01:36.642 - 00:02:17.304, Speaker C: We do not want. And we say that the space is GCBA. So it's geodesically complete and has curvature bound above. If it is locally cut k cut kappa, so it is curvature bound above, it is locally compact and basically complete. So this assumption of being locally compact is also needed, so in order to get some meaningful results. So just if you start with any, say, zero space, and then you attach to each point array, then the rising space is dramatically complete. So, and as complicated as your space was at the beginning.
00:02:17.304 - 00:02:17.936, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:18.040 - 00:02:19.564, Speaker A: Will be even more complicated.
00:02:23.264 - 00:02:58.384, Speaker C: So the first observation I want to say, so that the whole theory I'm going to talk about is local. So it's about the local structure of such spaces. And the assumptions are also local. But in fact, one can replace a small neighborhood of any point. One can change a metric by a conformal change, so that it becomes complete and you can change cut. So if it was cut one, then it becomes cut zero. So, but it's, again, so it's very local.
00:02:58.384 - 00:03:05.664, Speaker C: So if you are on a cut one space, and globally you cannot change the metric. So it becomes cut zero. So it must not be.
00:03:06.004 - 00:03:07.922, Speaker D: Could I interrupt with a quick question?
00:03:08.108 - 00:03:08.874, Speaker C: Yes.
00:03:09.374 - 00:03:23.914, Speaker D: So, of course, in romanian geometry, there's the distinction between a geodesic that's merely inextendable and one that's complete. Do you have a preferred parameterization here? So that like an arc length parameterization?
00:03:25.014 - 00:03:40.464, Speaker C: Yes, yes. It's proportional to arc length. So any romanian manifold would be geodesically complete in this sense, even if it is, even a non complete one would be geodesically complete.
00:03:41.724 - 00:03:48.464, Speaker D: So your definition is actually a geodesic that maps the entire real line to the space does not terminate.
00:03:49.484 - 00:03:52.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I know.
00:03:52.684 - 00:04:13.018, Speaker C: So the statement is that you cannot. Okay, so the assumption is that there is no geodesic defined on a compact interval which cannot be extended to one direction. Yes. So say an open interval is allowed and the closed interval is forbidden. I see.
00:04:13.066 - 00:04:23.346, Speaker D: So an open, a geodesic defined on a bounded, but open, bounded interval that is not extendable, that would be considered complete here.
00:04:23.530 - 00:05:03.670, Speaker C: Yes, yes, but again, so once you, so you can change from the local picture to the global one. And then the assumption would be that any geodesic is extendable to a complete geodesic defined the whole real line. So this would be the geodesic completeness as you know it in the romanian geometry. And this is essentially the assumption we can work with. So the assumption I made was slightly. Yeah, it was a local one. So because the whole theory is local, but you can, yeah, but you can assume that you have this global assumption.
00:05:03.822 - 00:05:04.390, Speaker A: I see.
00:05:04.462 - 00:05:05.634, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
00:05:10.294 - 00:05:19.946, Speaker C: Okay, so what is the aim? So what do we want, what do we can hope to achieve?
00:05:20.070 - 00:05:26.042, Speaker A: So, we want to prove that our.
00:05:26.098 - 00:06:27.594, Speaker C: Space is similar in a sense to a simplicial complex with no three phases. So no three phases, but also that there is no maximum face like in this triangle. So in this triangle, so each side is a free face. So free face means there's only one, there's only one maximal simplex adjacent to it. So if you have this picture, then, yeah, so this middle edge is not free, but there are many other three phases. So it's an easy observation that if you take a simplicial complex and you equip it with a piecewise, piecewise constant curvature, then drodesic completeness is equivalent if it is cut, if it is a cut. Once based completeness is equivalent to this assumption that there are no three phases.
00:06:30.614 - 00:06:35.434, Speaker A: So now the first observation is that.
00:06:35.734 - 00:06:54.210, Speaker C: We cannot expect more. Why? This is a result of Berstowski. There is a result of Berstowski and Gomhow, I have already mentioned that on any, so if you take any simplicial complex, then you can equip it with.
00:06:54.242 - 00:06:58.242, Speaker A: A metric which is cut one such.
00:06:58.298 - 00:07:41.342, Speaker C: That each simplex has constant curvature, one. So you cannot reach more. So this is very different from the theory of Alexander spaces, where the presence of any lower curvature bounds to even lower curvature bound minus one already provides a very, very strong restriction on topology. So for instance, say, in dimension two, the only Alexander spaces are the manifolds with boundary. So on the other hand, here you.
00:07:41.358 - 00:07:43.834, Speaker A: Can have any complex.
00:07:44.614 - 00:08:09.774, Speaker C: So in fact, in dimension one, in dimension one, this is exactly what we get. So if x is one dimensional, then it is a GCBA, if it only if it is locally a finite graph. So it looks something like this. And if it is cut one, if this cut zero, really, then it is a three.
00:08:11.874 - 00:08:16.186, Speaker A: So in dimension, already in dimension two.
00:08:16.330 - 00:08:21.690, Speaker C: The situation is more complicated. So, the example one should have in.
00:08:21.722 - 00:08:27.504, Speaker A: Mind the one which it's been observed by Kleiner.
00:08:27.624 - 00:08:59.854, Speaker C: So we have learned by the theorem of Eschatnyak that is possible to glue cut spaces along convex sets. Now sometimes same dimension two, one can make it very precise. One can glue subs, one can glue, sorry, one can glue spaces. Also a long note, not convex subsets, but along naya, so subsets with controlled curvature. So.
00:09:01.554 - 00:09:04.666, Speaker A: We choose the following two curves.
00:09:04.810 - 00:09:05.974, Speaker C: On the plane.
00:09:08.754 - 00:09:13.274, Speaker A: Which are symmetric along the axis.
00:09:13.394 - 00:09:24.964, Speaker C: And now we take one half plane and glue it along the upper curve.
00:09:26.584 - 00:09:30.520, Speaker A: And we take another half plane and.
00:09:30.552 - 00:10:20.334, Speaker C: We glue it along the lower curve. And then if the curves. So now one has to be a little bit careful how you glue, but one can do it, so that the rising space is cut zero. And then around this point, where the curves converge in a non simplicial matter, around this point, you have no triangulation of your space. So this already happens in dimension two. And in fact the situation is not much worse. So there is a recent result by show you in Yamaguchi showing that essentially all.
00:10:21.714 - 00:10:25.530, Speaker A: So all cut spaces of dimension two.
00:10:25.602 - 00:10:29.894, Speaker C: So also all gcbas of dimension two arise in this fashion.
00:10:36.674 - 00:10:38.934, Speaker A: Are there questions?
00:10:43.054 - 00:11:15.234, Speaker C: So, we want to prove that the space is similar to a simplificial complex, but so we cannot. Yeah, we cannot quite expect it to spatial complex, but we can, yeah, we can, yeah, we can try to see how far we can get. So this is also. So this example, I should also say. So this is in contrast to lower curvature bound, so where the spaces have much tamer topological structure. So this famous result of perimeter.
00:11:19.694 - 00:11:26.754, Speaker A: Okay, so here are the goals. So, can I ask a question? What is the dimension here? What is the notion of dimension?
00:11:27.054 - 00:11:55.154, Speaker C: The notion of dimension. So this is the dimension I have mentioned last time. So there are. So for cut spaces, all dimensions. So if you sold them in the house of one. So say it's a topological dimension, or you can say it is the dimension of the maximal, of the maximal subset homo morphic to euclidean ball, which you can topologically embed into your space, which might not be open.
00:11:55.814 - 00:11:56.994, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:11:58.934 - 00:12:15.660, Speaker C: So, but in fact. So in the setting of GCPA. So the dimension is. Yeah, it's also. Yeah. Much better visible, what it is. So, the first result is that a topological dimension of the GCBA.
00:12:15.660 - 00:12:44.108, Speaker C: Okay, so everything I'm going to say from now on is about GCBA spaces, about spaces with curvature bound above, locally compact and geodesically cookie. So, first observation is. So the topological dimension equals the host of dimension. And there is a large regular part in this large regular part. So this largeness, in the sense of the Hausdorff measure, and this large part.
00:12:44.196 - 00:12:46.716, Speaker A: Is a romanian manifold, it's non smooth.
00:12:46.780 - 00:13:12.842, Speaker C: But it's, with the controls remaining metric, it controls movements. So it has been already known before my work with Koichi Nagano. So there was an unpublished room by Olsen Joey. So here I should say that already, this result is completely wrong also, yeah, in dimension one, already without extendable geodesics. So the basic example is so you.
00:13:12.858 - 00:13:21.234, Speaker A: Can take, you can find a compact graph, the compact tree, if you choose.
00:13:21.274 - 00:13:26.866, Speaker C: The branchings in a precise way. So then you can achieve that.
00:13:26.890 - 00:13:30.644, Speaker A: The house of dimension, host of dimension.
00:13:30.944 - 00:13:53.884, Speaker C: Can be as large as you want. So you can even choose to be infinite. Yeah, but this cannot happen if. So, if. Yeah, if the space logistically completes. So if you can. So if any branch you choose, you have to extend the whole ray.
00:13:53.884 - 00:14:42.900, Speaker C: So this immediately shows that if you want to stay locally compact, then there are only finitely many branchings in a compact region in one dimensional situation, as I have mentioned. So there are similar stronger results, even for curvature, for space with curvature bound above. So it's due to broad groom of perenneman and then the perimen. And there are similar results for some RCD spaces. So this is what everyone very often tries to prove. So it's memetic gender resource to prove that, at least on a. So there's a large regular part, and this regular part is close to what.
00:14:42.932 - 00:14:43.504, Speaker A: You.
00:14:47.784 - 00:14:49.084, Speaker C: To remind each other.
00:14:53.544 - 00:14:55.444, Speaker A: So, other questions so far.
00:15:00.104 - 00:15:10.712, Speaker B: I have a comment, though, in RCG spaces, well, there are various notions of dimensions, and sometimes house of dimensions can be bigger than sort of the natural dimension.
00:15:10.888 - 00:15:19.780, Speaker C: Yeah, but I said. So for some. For some asset spaces. So, yeah, for this, this top dimensional ones.
00:15:19.812 - 00:15:20.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:21.124 - 00:15:29.944, Speaker B: So there are recent examples, by way and Payne, that showed that house of dimension can actually be bigger than.
00:15:34.364 - 00:15:37.596, Speaker C: So these are not collapsed. Yeah, these are not.
00:15:37.700 - 00:15:41.264, Speaker B: These are collapsed on some spaces. Sorry.
00:15:44.414 - 00:15:45.014, Speaker C: No.
00:15:45.134 - 00:15:48.790, Speaker B: Yeah, so those spaces are collapsed. Right?
00:15:48.862 - 00:15:52.794, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.
00:15:55.374 - 00:15:58.874, Speaker A: Okay, so second.
00:16:01.094 - 00:16:30.386, Speaker C: Part of the goal, so this was about regular part, now the second part of the goal, so this is also very typical for the situations of some spaces beyond remind manifold. So you want to say, so that you can structure the singularity. So say there's regular part and there's some less regular part and less less regular part. And so that the less regular the part is, the smaller it should be.
00:16:30.490 - 00:16:31.890, Speaker A: So it's statement.
00:16:31.962 - 00:17:16.754, Speaker C: So there is a stratification of your space, and here stratification, so it's not really. So it's not a division in topology, commandifolds, so these are just closed subsets, so they have some, so you can say more about it. So, and for, for any x in the complement of x, k minus one, a neighborhood of this point, yeah, essential. So in a sense it splits off an rk, so it looks in the precise sense similar to a product of the, of the k dimensional euclidean space with some factor.
00:17:17.094 - 00:17:21.150, Speaker A: So I will say a little bit.
00:17:21.182 - 00:18:27.564, Speaker C: What this almost splitting means, but not being very precise. And so the point is, so that the set of points which do not admit such a k splitting, topological and metrical, it has dimension at most k's on what one should think of. So think of. So you should think of Xk as the cave skeleton of your space. So if you have a simplistial complex, then along the edge you can split off the euclidean line, but not euclidean two space. And in a vertex you cannot split off nothing. So this would be a point in x zero, this would be x one and the faces would be x two.
00:18:27.564 - 00:18:32.584, Speaker C: So this is an upload.
00:18:35.604 - 00:18:39.984, Speaker A: And so the final.
00:18:41.844 - 00:18:49.916, Speaker C: Class of, so the final part of goals, I want to say, is topological regularity.
00:18:50.020 - 00:18:51.904, Speaker A: So this thing.
00:18:54.004 - 00:19:40.004, Speaker C: So we already know that. So that any space has a large part which is romanian manifold, and one cannot say much more usually, but sometimes you can try to ask, okay, so if it's not maybe smooth, if it's maybe different from smooth manifold, it can be, yeah, can you say if it's topological a manifold? So, and here the theorem, so if the space is so, space is a manifold, if and only if the space of direction is a homotopy sphere for all x, and equivalently if and only if, so the tangent spaces are depleted.
00:19:40.044 - 00:19:42.144, Speaker A: Spaces for all points.
00:19:43.924 - 00:20:28.078, Speaker C: And using this result, so one can, one has applications for limits of free money manifolds and some sphere theorem. So for instance, one can show, so that the limit of remaining manifolds, if you have grammar housed off limit and all manifolds have curvature bounded from above, injectivity radios bound from below, and they converge to something. Then this limiting space is again topological, and you can say even a little bit more. So this is a version, so a weak version of a stability theorem of perelman in Alexander. And finally.
00:20:28.166 - 00:20:31.354, Speaker A: Yeah, what kind of manifold?
00:20:34.654 - 00:20:42.624, Speaker C: It's just a topological manifold. So it is just locally homeomorphic to euclidean space.
00:20:43.364 - 00:20:44.652, Speaker A: And I have one more question.
00:20:44.708 - 00:20:45.584, Speaker C: So for.
00:20:47.604 - 00:20:51.424, Speaker A: Cat zero, this theory is empty, right?
00:20:52.924 - 00:21:05.300, Speaker C: No, no, for cat zero, this theory is not empty. So what do you mean by that? What kind of manifold can it be? This is, I mean, because last time.
00:21:05.332 - 00:21:09.334, Speaker A: You said that it would be contractible.
00:21:09.714 - 00:21:34.978, Speaker C: Yes, yes. So, okay, so what I should say, so that everything more or less until now are local results. So now it's maybe related to your question. So it's this global result, I want to say. So let x be zero if it's a form manifold, and X is homeomorphic to r four. So this is a global result, but in fact. So the proof is rather.
00:21:34.978 - 00:21:49.642, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's, it's local mostly. So immediately you see that. So in a cat zero space is contractible, that they're a lot more contractible manifolds than Euclidean.
00:21:49.818 - 00:21:53.122, Speaker B: Sorry, can I ask the question about the previous theorem?
00:21:53.298 - 00:21:54.174, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:21:54.954 - 00:22:03.382, Speaker B: Sigma X is required to only be homotopy sphere, or it doesn't have to be actual sphere.
00:22:03.498 - 00:22:15.190, Speaker C: Yes. So, so, yeah, yeah. It may look a bit strange if you see it for the first time. Yes. So the point is, it does not need to be homomorphic to a sphere. So the point is.
00:22:15.222 - 00:22:19.542, Speaker B: So I doesn't even need to be a manifold, right?
00:22:19.678 - 00:22:24.478, Speaker C: It doesn't even need to, it does not have to be manifold. So if it's a manifold, then I.
00:22:24.486 - 00:22:26.554, Speaker B: Know such example exists in CBP.
00:22:27.374 - 00:22:59.126, Speaker C: Yeah. So I can, I can make an example. So this example, yeah, it's also. So you have the same example also, for example of geometry, the example goes like this. So you take sigma to be the pancreas sphere. So this is a three dimensional manifold which has the homology of a sphere, but is not simply connected. And now what you do, so you.
00:22:59.150 - 00:23:10.488, Speaker A: Take the double suspension of this on carry sphere.
00:23:10.576 - 00:23:32.378, Speaker C: Now, if you equip this. So if you rescale it, so you just equip it. The symmetric. So that, say, the round metric, then the curvature is at least, at most one inductivity radius can be small. So you rescale it. So the inductive radius is large enough, then it's a cut one space. If you take the suspension over it, it stays cut one.
00:23:32.378 - 00:23:44.374, Speaker C: If you take double suspension, it still stays cut one. So this double suspension of this space, this is a cut one space. Now this is not very surprising.
00:23:44.714 - 00:23:48.774, Speaker B: What is, there is a question in the chat if.
00:23:49.154 - 00:23:50.054, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:51.754 - 00:24:34.468, Speaker C: So this is surprising. So this is clearly a five dimensional simplicial complex. Now what is surprising is that this is homeomorphic to s five. So despite this fact that this sigma three is not manifold, if you take the double suspension, you get the topological sphere. Now, in this topological sphere, you have a singular, singular circle. This is the circle along which you have the suspension. And at any point of the circle there, so you have here some s one sitting in this sphite, and for any x in this sphite, the space.
00:24:34.516 - 00:24:39.788, Speaker A: Of direction is just the suspension, the sink.
00:24:39.836 - 00:24:50.188, Speaker C: So just the ones suspension of the original planchet sphere. And this suspension, it's simply connected. There's any suspension of a connected space.
00:24:50.236 - 00:24:55.384, Speaker A: But it is not, it is not a manifold, it's not a form.
00:24:55.504 - 00:24:59.364, Speaker C: So it's homotopy equivalent to the sphere, but it is not a manifold.
00:25:01.064 - 00:25:04.088, Speaker A: Okay. Yes.
00:25:04.176 - 00:25:09.416, Speaker B: Somebody is asking in the chat if there is a similar result for CBB. Yes, there is.
00:25:09.520 - 00:25:54.160, Speaker C: Yes. So there is a similar result for CBB spaces. So exactly the same one, but for CBB space with square, which above this result is a trivial consequence model of some known results in geometric topology of the local conicality theorem of pyramids. So this local conicality theorem of perimeter tells you that for any CBB space, a neighborhood of any plant is homomorphic to the tangent cone. So to the euclidean cone over the space of direction. However, this is wrong. This is completely wrong.
00:25:54.160 - 00:26:18.984, Speaker C: In GCPA spaces, the example. So this example of Kleiner, which I have done at the beginning, so it is not so round. So there's this singular point, this very singular point, the space of direction is a final graph. So, but the space itself, so no neighborhood at this point admits any triangulation.
00:26:21.924 - 00:26:22.864, Speaker A: Does it?
00:26:23.524 - 00:26:30.664, Speaker C: Answer the question? So also the question about, about cad zero spaces.
00:26:32.164 - 00:26:35.464, Speaker A: I meant if x is compact, then it's empty.
00:26:36.684 - 00:26:54.038, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, so if x would be compact. Yeah, yeah. So for compact, yeah. So compact GCBA spaces do not exist. Yeah. So just because for compact, the base spaces, no, they wouldn't exist if they are cut zero, so they can be locally cut zero, but for cut zero.
00:26:54.038 - 00:27:35.374, Speaker C: So you would need to have an infinite geodesic. So, by the way, so there is a result of very different nature, so combinatorial nature, which I don't quite understand. But, but it says following. So you can, you can say precisely, so which simplicial complexes so carry a piecewise euclidean cad, zero metric and up to subdivision. These are exactly the so called collapsible complexes. So this is, so when you learn. So if you don't know what collapsible is, then forget this remark.
00:27:35.374 - 00:27:53.274, Speaker C: But if you learn what collapsible is, then the example of a non collapsible, something you see is something like this dance head. So it is contractible, but it's contractible for a weird reason. And so for zero spaces, it turns out to be related to this collapsibility.
00:27:59.694 - 00:28:01.834, Speaker A: Are there more questions here?
00:28:06.654 - 00:28:21.102, Speaker C: So these are the results. Now, I don't want, I don't want really to provide proofs. I want to give some tools which I use. So, and these tools, they are so.
00:28:21.158 - 00:28:24.726, Speaker A: They are very general nature.
00:28:24.790 - 00:29:17.074, Speaker C: So they are used also in Alexander spaces essentially in a similar way. So the first observation, very important one, so that the space is locally Dublin. So, meaning that you can find. So if you stick to a neighborhood of some point, then you can find some number such that any ball of radius r you can cover. So within this neighborhood you can cover by this number of balls of radius are half. So it tells you that your space at any scale has the same contactless property. And this is due just to the following observation.
00:29:17.154 - 00:29:22.186, Speaker A: So that you have, so that if.
00:29:22.210 - 00:29:32.144, Speaker C: You go along geodesics, then you grow and your space grow at least in the way as euclidean space grow. So if you, if in a neighborhood.
00:29:32.184 - 00:29:35.712, Speaker A: Of some point you, you find too.
00:29:35.768 - 00:29:40.056, Speaker C: Many points, then you also find many.
00:29:40.120 - 00:29:48.608, Speaker A: Points on a large scale. Yeah, just going along these geodesics.
00:29:48.776 - 00:29:57.564, Speaker C: So and it tells you that if you know some contactness of some ball, then on some, on all smaller balls you are even more compact.
00:29:59.044 - 00:30:04.184, Speaker A: So this is a very powerful observation.
00:30:04.564 - 00:30:19.852, Speaker C: Yeah. It's very elementary. Now in particular, so you can stay in a point and zoom in and zoom in even more. And then at any scale. So you have uniform compactness, so you.
00:30:19.868 - 00:30:22.684, Speaker A: Can go to a limit.
00:30:22.724 - 00:30:44.100, Speaker C: And in fact, so this limit exists. And it is this tangent cones or the cone of the space of direction. So this is really euclidean cone. So, and now you have, so this following very trivial observation.
00:30:44.172 - 00:30:47.652, Speaker A: So in euclidean cone we have here.
00:30:47.708 - 00:31:06.284, Speaker C: The origin of your cone. And for any other two points, let's say y. And this triangle is euclidean. So it's isometric to the euclidean prime.
00:31:06.864 - 00:31:12.888, Speaker A: And this has, now if you zoom.
00:31:12.936 - 00:31:38.316, Speaker C: In and you have this convergence, so it's a groundhouse of convergence. So some, so not all quantities need to be preserved, but there is some semicontinuity under this convergence. So I don't want to be precise what semicont. But you can show, so that if you converge to something which is euclidean, then nearby you are almost euclidean. So it tells you that in that in x.
00:31:38.380 - 00:31:41.188, Speaker A: So if you fix your vertex x.
00:31:41.276 - 00:32:12.040, Speaker C: Then for sufficiently close points to the point x, your triangle is almost euclidean. And you can say that zones euclidean. So in any reasonable sense, for instance, the angles are sufficiently close to euclidean angles. So in particular, so it tells you that if you have here your point.
00:32:12.112 - 00:32:16.056, Speaker A: X, then it may happen that the.
00:32:16.080 - 00:33:11.144, Speaker C: Geodesics branch also close to your point. But this branching must occur along smaller and smaller angles. So it cannot happen. What happens, say, in this first example of a wire to the branching tree that you can even close to your point, you have a branching at angle PI. Yeah. So this is actually. So this is the basic building block for all observations, is it? Okay, so now the next tool, this is also widely used.
00:33:11.184 - 00:33:15.336, Speaker A: So also, yeah, same way in, as.
00:33:15.360 - 00:33:18.240, Speaker C: It is used in Alexander Zhongli. So in fact, I, I should say.
00:33:18.272 - 00:33:20.944, Speaker A: So that in large parts of what.
00:33:20.984 - 00:33:26.112, Speaker C: I did with krychnagano. So was just following the path by burago.
00:33:26.128 - 00:33:58.584, Speaker A: Grammother, can I ask a vague question please? Please, about the previous slide? So if you, if you have some, uh, point x where the angle is very large, because, because it has many components, how can, how can locally, how can make it, how can making it local make it euclidean?
00:33:58.964 - 00:34:27.164, Speaker C: Yeah. So here is the point. So I'm not claiming that all triangles in a neighborhood are almost euclidean. I say that all triangles with vertex equal to x. So say if you, if you have such a picture, then even. So, if it's, if this is your x, then close to this point, you have this triangle, y z one, z two, which is very non euclidean. Yeah.
00:34:27.164 - 00:34:28.676, Speaker C: So which is very wide.
00:34:28.860 - 00:34:33.018, Speaker A: But say at this point, so any.
00:34:33.066 - 00:34:36.242, Speaker C: Triangle with vertex x, this is a.
00:34:36.258 - 00:34:40.210, Speaker A: Degenerate euclidean triangle which is sufficiently small.
00:34:40.282 - 00:35:20.608, Speaker C: So on a graph, if you fix a point, it's a finite graph, then any triangle with x as a vertex is just a segment. Okay, thank you. So it's less than locals. So it's really a local statement with a fixed vertex. So now the next tool is distance maps. So we, yeah. So in particular, so we want to prove that on some regular path, our space is, is a manifold.
00:35:20.608 - 00:36:03.402, Speaker C: So to say that it is a remaining manifold, we need to find some root coordinates. So we find this coordinate. So mostly these coordinates originate in some kind of distance map. Sometimes you do something with these functions, but essentially these are distance functions. So now the first observation is that this distance function to the point x almost splits in a small neighborhood of this ball, of this point outside of this point. So this is just. Yeah, again, I don't want to be precise here, but this is more or less the statement I said before.
00:36:03.538 - 00:36:09.618, Speaker A: So in the euclidean cone, along any.
00:36:09.666 - 00:36:21.922, Speaker C: Point outside of your origin, you have this special ray going in this point. And along this ray you don't have a splitting.
00:36:22.018 - 00:36:22.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:22.362 - 00:36:43.162, Speaker C: So you have, so it's not a direct product, but it's very close to being direct product. So it's a warped product. And this convergence. So if this is, this is TXX and here this is an x.
00:36:43.258 - 00:36:46.674, Speaker A: So we have here kind of.
00:36:46.714 - 00:37:04.916, Speaker C: So it's not really a product, but this is close to being, to being, to being a product. So in which, so I want to say a little bit more precise, in which sense. So the, you can say it in.
00:37:04.940 - 00:37:09.424, Speaker A: Terms of, so you can define it in terms of.
00:37:09.764 - 00:37:19.176, Speaker C: So the point is the following. So for any point y which is sufficiently close to the point x, and if you extend this geodesic, you see.
00:37:19.240 - 00:37:22.776, Speaker A: Here another point, say x head.
00:37:22.960 - 00:37:26.484, Speaker C: And now for any point p.
00:37:28.544 - 00:37:31.520, Speaker A: In your space, if you connect this, then.
00:37:31.552 - 00:37:39.104, Speaker C: You see two angles, alpha and beta. And if it would be a line in the euclidean plane, then the sum.
00:37:39.144 - 00:37:42.464, Speaker A: Of alpha and beta would be PI.
00:37:43.124 - 00:38:15.404, Speaker C: Now here, just because it's a line, because it's a geodesic, the sum of alpha and beta must be at least PI. Now if you have a very large branching angle, then it's easy to. So if this geodesic would be, if the, if x, y, p would also be geodesic, then the sum, then alpha would be already PI. And then this alpha plus beta would be just PI plus beta. And then, so the statement that the.
00:38:15.444 - 00:38:18.284, Speaker A: Branching angle is not too large just.
00:38:18.324 - 00:39:00.204, Speaker C: Means so that the sum of alpha and beta is essentially PI for any such, for any such picture, for any y sitting in this small ball. So this means this almost splitting. Now, what we do is we consider maps. So these are distance maps, which are just defined by a few points chosen in the space. And so the coordinates, so this is a map to euclidean space of some power a. And the map is defined by. So the coordinates are distance functions to points.
00:39:00.204 - 00:39:09.904, Speaker C: Now we say that the map is regular. So for some data. So we need some parameters. So if.
00:39:11.684 - 00:39:13.464, Speaker A: If the following happens.
00:39:14.324 - 00:39:48.270, Speaker C: So, so it's regulated point y, if the following happens. So if we have here the point x one, here the point x two, so if the geodesic from x one to y does not branch to widely at the point y, so the distance to the point x one almost splits in this sense of angles at y, the same happens for x two. And these angles are almost, so this.
00:39:48.302 - 00:39:49.994, Speaker A: Angle is almost pivotal.
00:39:51.914 - 00:39:57.650, Speaker C: This, they, so we need to say what?
00:39:57.842 - 00:40:04.026, Speaker A: Yeah, to use this parameter, and we.
00:40:04.210 - 00:40:44.590, Speaker C: Need to make this definition a little bit careful, so that the space of points at which such a map is that regular is open and such that this openness is stable underground house of conagrance. So if it's open and you vary a little bit, the point, or you vary a little bit, your space x, then it stays open, so it stays regular. And once we have such a notion, then the first basic observation is that such a map, at the part where.
00:40:44.622 - 00:40:49.190, Speaker A: It is regular, it is an open.
00:40:49.262 - 00:40:51.704, Speaker C: Map, and in fact in a controlled.
00:40:51.744 - 00:40:54.736, Speaker A: Way, so it is LipscHitz up.
00:40:54.920 - 00:41:02.804, Speaker C: And how do you prove this? So this is very, this is, this is rather simple.
00:41:07.744 - 00:41:10.208, Speaker A: So if we have here point x.
00:41:10.256 - 00:41:43.004, Speaker C: One, here x two, here you have this x one head here, here you have your point y, this point, the map is delta regular. Now what you can do, you have here several, sorry, you have several flows. So the flows are very simple. So you have the flow towards the point x two.
00:41:43.314 - 00:41:49.354, Speaker A: You have a flow towards the point x one head.
00:41:49.514 - 00:41:53.610, Speaker C: You have the flow towards the point x two head and you have the.
00:41:53.642 - 00:41:56.814, Speaker A: Flow towards the point x one.
00:41:57.714 - 00:42:10.106, Speaker C: And if you, so this, you just go along geodesic to this point. This is the same as saying you take the gradient flow of this function. So, and now you observe that if.
00:42:10.130 - 00:42:13.194, Speaker A: You go towards x two, and then.
00:42:13.234 - 00:42:48.378, Speaker C: The assumptions tells you that you go with velocity one towards x two, you go with velocity almost one from the point x to head and the distance to the point x one and x one head almost do not change. This is this first variation. So they change, but at a very small velocity. And using this, you can go along, so you can go through up then to the right, then up, then to the right. And so you can, you can reach.
00:42:48.426 - 00:42:58.574, Speaker A: Any point in the neighborhood of the image point. So this proves the openness.
00:42:59.314 - 00:43:26.874, Speaker C: Okay, so this is the second tool. And now, so one can say a lot about the fibers of this distance maps. So there are two main observations. So the first observation is that the fiber of such a distance map is locally contractible.
00:43:28.374 - 00:43:31.694, Speaker A: So you have here point x, and.
00:43:31.734 - 00:43:33.486, Speaker C: Here you have a distance sphere.
00:43:33.630 - 00:43:34.474, Speaker A: And this.
00:43:35.374 - 00:44:15.378, Speaker C: So yeah, so the fiber in this here, you have just one parameter. So just, so, just one coordinate, the distance function two. So f is equal to Dx. So then the fiber, this is a distance here. And the statement is that whenever this distance is regular, then this distance sphere is locally contractible. Why this, the proof is again essentially very similar to what we have seen before. So we have this point on the other side of x here, this point y.
00:44:15.378 - 00:44:49.866, Speaker C: And now we take a neighborhood of this point y and we go first. So if we take a point here, then we first go to the point x head. And then if we cross once, we have. So this doesn't make too much sense. Yeah, just one function, but. Okay, so for several, so I assume there are several points x x one. And here we have x two.
00:44:49.866 - 00:45:48.264, Speaker C: Here we have x. So we go first towards one point, then we go towards the other, then towards the third, and then so on until we reach this fiber. And again, so since we, since we know what happens with the distances in first order, we can control this process very well and show that a very small ball around this point can be contracted on a ball in the sphere. So it really proves that a small ball in the sphere is contracted. This is first observation. And then the second one, which allows, which is a main point for all inductive arguments, this is the following. So it tells us again, we have here x, we have here the fiber.
00:45:48.264 - 00:45:52.356, Speaker C: And in general, if you have here.
00:45:52.380 - 00:45:55.860, Speaker A: A point where at this point the.
00:45:55.892 - 00:46:29.328, Speaker C: Distance to the point x is regular. So in general, you could not extend it to a regular function with two coordinates. However, you have this distance function to the point y. This distance function to the point y is regular on a small neighborhood of y. Moreover, here you have a right angle just by the first variation formula.
00:46:29.416 - 00:46:34.844, Speaker A: So close by on this fiber, also.
00:46:35.144 - 00:47:20.694, Speaker C: This angle, this angle, they are also almost regular, so nearby. So on this small neighborhood. So if you take this small ball and respect at least a fiber, the distance function, two x and distance function to y give you a two regular function. And now you can sit in this point and consider the fiber of the distance function to x, this function to y, and take the fiber and either. So maybe if you are lucky, it happens that this fiber just consists of one point. But if it is the case, then you have found a point that the neighborhood of this point will then be really ellipsis manifold.
00:47:21.714 - 00:47:25.586, Speaker A: Otherwise, you can proceed by induction and.
00:47:25.610 - 00:47:31.574, Speaker C: Find a point in which you have three regular directions and so on.
00:47:33.134 - 00:47:41.190, Speaker A: So this is the main, these are the main tools, other questions, answers.
00:47:41.262 - 00:48:05.532, Speaker C: So, there's another tool I will mention, this is slightly more specific, but these are the tools from metric geometry. So the final, those are geometric topology and homotopy theory. So these are, yeah, more of topological nature. So, and first is.
00:48:05.708 - 00:48:08.908, Speaker A: Yeah, so if you.
00:48:09.036 - 00:48:33.296, Speaker C: So it's very often easier to control something up to homogeneity than up to homo, basically. So, and there's a very general result. So if you have some gram of house of convergence. And so observe. So that here in our settings, so we have lots of. So we have. So just if we rescale our space, we have a gram of house of convergence to.
00:48:33.296 - 00:48:40.044, Speaker C: Okay, so these are non compact spaces, but still. So we have a grammar house of convergence of the neighborhoods of our space to.
00:48:41.984 - 00:48:44.564, Speaker A: The cone. Now.
00:48:46.784 - 00:49:11.500, Speaker C: So distance. So under this convergence, also spheres. So small spheres around our point converge to the space of directions. And so now the statement is so that if you have such a grammar house of convergence, and if your spaces are uniformly locally contractible, so essentially meaning.
00:49:11.532 - 00:49:15.004, Speaker A: So that, yeah, so, for instance, if.
00:49:15.044 - 00:49:21.404, Speaker C: On any space, on any space xi, small balls of the same fixed radius.
00:49:21.444 - 00:49:24.884, Speaker A: Are considered, then the limit space is.
00:49:24.924 - 00:49:48.188, Speaker C: Multiply equivalent two spaces xi for I large enough. So this is a result which I think it was without before the notion of grumble house of convergence. It was known to bombs and then was recovered by Peter Petersen. So, in our situation, so we know.
00:49:48.236 - 00:49:52.432, Speaker A: So that small balls are contractible and.
00:49:52.528 - 00:50:37.760, Speaker C: Small balls without a .1 can one can again use. So that, yeah, that the function that the distance functions are, so for this you do not need actually nothing. So this is true, also without the assumption, the space HCB. So any punctured ball is homotopy equivalent to the space of directions. Okay, so, and then there is another topological, topological result. So this is again, okay, so a small contrast with the Alexander of the theory of Alexander spaces.
00:50:37.760 - 00:50:55.614, Speaker C: So there you have a similar theory of regular distance functions. And there it's a famous result of pyramid, which says that such a regular distance function is a fiber bundle is.
00:50:55.654 - 00:50:59.342, Speaker A: Locally a fiber, if the fibers are compact.
00:50:59.478 - 00:51:07.794, Speaker C: So here it is not quite the case, but. So it's, since we have already proven.
00:51:08.214 - 00:51:12.996, Speaker A: That all of our fibers are locally.
00:51:13.020 - 00:51:27.884, Speaker C: Contractable, one can make it uniform. So this result shows that all these distance functions, they are, they behave like. So they are local homotopy formations. And.
00:51:28.044 - 00:51:32.644, Speaker B: Sorry, question f is a regular map here, right or no?
00:51:32.764 - 00:52:18.204, Speaker C: So this is a general topological result. So, if you have general metric spaces, say maybe you need to assume finite dimensions. So if you have a proper map, you have a proper map within them. So, meaning that the, say, pre image of compact set is compact, then in order to say that f is a horovic vibration, you only need to verify that the fibers are locally uniformly contracted. So this is, this is this tool from geometrics, from, from homotopy fury we use. So, and we apply it to this distance functions. So for us, this x will be our x and y will be an open subset of RK.
00:52:18.204 - 00:53:09.414, Speaker C: Okay, so. And the last tool we use is manifold recognition theory. So this is, so this is a very deep theory in geometric topology. So, yeah, which provides very efficient answer to the answers to the question, how do you know that if you have a space, that it is a topological manifold? So the point is you need to control local homology. So you need to control homologies of puncture, neighborhood. So your space needs to be locally contractible, it needs to, local homology must be as a whole, as in the euclidean space. And then you are almost there, then.
00:53:09.454 - 00:53:12.742, Speaker A: There are, then there is a little.
00:53:12.798 - 00:53:49.930, Speaker C: Bit more that you have to prove. So this little bit more turns out to be if really habit in practice, or not so easy, but it's not. So, yeah. You know what to do then. So this is a final two videos we apply. So this is more or less all about results and tools, I want to say. Then I have another page with final questions about this theory I think are reasonable.
00:53:49.930 - 00:53:52.174, Speaker C: So, do we have questions so far?
00:53:54.364 - 00:54:03.204, Speaker A: I have a question for the Borsuk Peterson theorem here. Do I need to have a uniform.
00:54:03.244 - 00:54:07.372, Speaker C: Bound across the whole sequence and on the limit space? Or is it that each element of.
00:54:07.388 - 00:54:09.580, Speaker B: The sequence has its own uniform bound.
00:54:09.732 - 00:54:27.644, Speaker C: For local construction, what for sure suffices? So if, or if for all xi, they are uniformly locally contractible, and there is some, some fine issue. So you need to assume that all.
00:54:27.724 - 00:54:40.144, Speaker A: Spaces are finite dimension a priori. Thank you. And the other questions.
00:54:42.884 - 00:55:21.534, Speaker C: Then I would like to just to finish the talk with some other questions. So, what one would like to say more about this space is what one would like to know. So, as I said, there's regular part and the regular part. So we have really riemannian structure. So one can ask if riemannian structure has optimal regularity. We don't know it quite, but what is maybe more interesting at this point is finer structure of the space in codem engine one and two. I think Koichi Nagano will deliver a talk about this direct.
00:55:21.534 - 00:55:23.826, Speaker C: So he has put something in this.
00:55:23.850 - 00:55:28.234, Speaker A: Direction then for something else, which would.
00:55:28.274 - 00:56:03.808, Speaker C: Be desirable are harmonic coordinates on large parts of regular part. So this is something which has been recently established on Alexander spaces and non collapsed ace spaces. So I think this would also be very interesting in this setting. Related to this is the control of the so called metric measure boundary. So as I said, so most points. So the large part is remaining manifold. So most.
00:56:03.808 - 00:56:23.890, Speaker C: So infinitesimally most points or most small balls looks very euclidean. So, but now you would like to be a little bit more precise or to say how many. Yeah. How similar to eugradient balls are small bowls.
00:56:23.922 - 00:56:28.378, Speaker A: One can make, can make this version precise.
00:56:28.426 - 00:57:01.708, Speaker C: So it was recently. So using harmonic coordinates, it was recently verified that the metric measure boundary on example space Spanish is something similar would be desirable here and related to this. So the existence of geodesic flow, of uniquely defined geodesic flow on a large part of the space. So this would also have implications to the genetic group theory. Okay, so, and the final. Yeah. A simple minded question is.
00:57:01.708 - 00:57:20.406, Speaker C: So if, if proper. So if being GCP is a topological property. So, meaning if you have. So I'm not sure it is the case, but I don't have a proof of. So, yeah. So assume you have two cut kappa spaces. One of them is jurassically complete.
00:57:20.550 - 00:57:21.054, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:21.134 - 00:57:33.870, Speaker C: And they are homomorphic, then the other one should be basically complete too. So the statement should be. So in a sense it's only something like not having three faces.
00:57:34.022 - 00:57:34.598, Speaker A: So.
00:57:34.726 - 00:57:35.774, Speaker C: But it's not.
00:57:35.854 - 00:57:38.394, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:38.474 - 00:57:46.774, Speaker C: So that's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much for your attention.
00:57:51.874 - 00:57:54.474, Speaker B: Thank you. Questions.
