00:00:00.520 - 00:00:10.714, Speaker A: Okay, great. So David Sidarsky is our next speaker this afternoon from Forum University. Singular curve in the client model of uncertainty.
00:00:11.734 - 00:00:55.934, Speaker B: Thank you, Melody. And first, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting on this wonderful conference and also to say a special thank you. This is my first face to face research talk since before the pandemic, and so I'm really excited to be back in the room with all of you. All right, so, almost 30 years ago, Mukai proposed a birational model of the modulized space of deline Mumford stable curves of genus seven. So, remember m seven bars, a compactification of the modulized space of smooth curves in m seven bar. You would add nodal curves that have finite automorphism groups. And an open question is to study the birational geometry of these spaces, um, uh, when g is larger than three.
00:00:55.934 - 00:01:42.614, Speaker B: Here's Mackay's model. He says you take the Grassmannian of seven dimensional vector subspaces of a 16 dimensional vector space and mod out by the action of the algebraic group. So ten. Okay, so let's unpack that a little bit. How is so ten acting on this grass monitor? By its spin representation. Okay, so, um. So ten, um, has, um, since it's a type D group, it's got these irreducible representations that don't come from the tensor product of the standard representation, the so called spin representations for so ten, they're 16 dimensional, and that's how so ten is acting on this GR 716.
00:01:42.614 - 00:02:59.158, Speaker B: Let me say a little bit more about how we get there. Okay, so, in general, we know for algebraic curves how many and what type of polynomials you need to carve out the canonical embedding. So, for a general g seven curve, you would expect that the canonical ideals would be generated by ten quadrics. And the starting point for Mukai's construction is that he proved that for a general smooth genus seven curve, and here, general means that it's not hyperliptic, not trigonal, and not tetragonal, that the kernel of the multiplication map from two elements in degree two in the canonical ideal, multiplying together and landing in the fourth degree of the ideal, that multiplication map has a one dimensional kernel. So let's let Q be a generator of that kernel. Now, you have a ten dimensional vector space I two, and you've got quadratic form on it. And so we should do what we always do when we have quadratic forms.
00:02:59.158 - 00:03:59.184, Speaker B: Namely, you should study the isotropic vector spaces of your vector space I two. And so you hunt around if you want maximal isotropic subspaces, or Lagrangians, it's not hard to find them. And in particular, if you look at any smooth point, I mean, here I was talking about smooth curves, and later we'll be talking about singular curves. But for smooth points, if you look at the row space of the jacobian matrix, that's always going to be rank five matrix and its span is going to give you a Lagrangian with respect to this quadratic form. Mkay's notation for that is WP perpendicular. And so here's a quick summary of Mackay's results from his 1995 paper. If you map every point p to the Lagrangian given by wp perp, so the row space of the jacobian matrix that embeds your curve c into the orthogonal Grassmannian.
00:03:59.184 - 00:04:44.408, Speaker B: So this is a variety that parameterizes five dimensional isotropic subspaces of the ten dimensional vector space with this quadratic form. The orthogonal Grassmannian, in turn, via spinners, naturally sits inside a p 15, and so we're able to embed our curve into p 15 that way. Moreover, this spin embedding of your curve naturally lands on a projective six dimensional space that Makai calls capital p. And so I will too. I realize it's kind of confusing. It's not a point, it's a p six. And so now we started with a canonical curve.
00:04:44.408 - 00:05:49.614, Speaker B: We've re embedded it into a p six inside p 15, and, and that is your canonical curve back. And so Macaj finishes the story by saying, all right, so if you look at the Grassmannian of seven dimensional subspaces of p 16 of the 16 dimensional vector spaces. So when you projected advice, you're looking at p six, s and p 15 sections of the orthogonal Grassmannian are going to give you canonical curves. And if you mod up by the action of so ten, you will recover something that's birational to m seven bars. Okay, so that's how he proposes. Or that's the model he proposes for n seven bars. Let me take a few slides and just review a few of the major themes from geometric invariant theory, since I know we have a general audience, and not all of you here are people who construct moduli spaces using git.
00:05:49.614 - 00:06:14.640, Speaker B: So, geometric invariant theory is a general technique in algebraic geometry. It's one of many. It's not the only way. And the goal is to construct quotients when you have an algebraic group acting on a scheme. So in git, here's the approach we take. So if you have a projective scheme x. For us, it's going to be a Grossmanian today and an ample line bundle on your x.
00:06:14.640 - 00:06:53.166, Speaker B: We naturally have the pleugor line bundle on our Grossmanian, and you have a reductive group acting on x. For us, it's going to be so ten. The GI T quotient is just proj of the ring of g invariant sections of your line bundle. Okay, so that's a ring, because our group is reductive. It's going to be, that ring is going to be finally generated. So we'll get a scheme, but what are its properties? Okay, so here's where things get to be a little bit weird. If you're coming from topology or even differential geometry, you generally expect your quotient morphisms to have nice properties.
00:06:53.166 - 00:07:04.896, Speaker B: And so the first thing that goes wrong in git is that you don't always get, um, a morphism from x to the quotient, which is what you probably would expect. And it's easy to see what can.
00:07:04.920 - 00:07:07.280, Speaker A: Go wrong if all of your g.
00:07:07.312 - 00:07:32.474, Speaker B: Invariant sections vanish at a point. Well, we don't get the .00 in projective space, so that's going to be a problem. Okay, so we get around that by, um, making a definition. You define what's called the git semi stable locus to be the set of points where you've got at least one non vanishing invariant section. Okay. Then you do get a morphism from the semi stable locus down to your quotient.
00:07:32.474 - 00:08:36.644, Speaker B: Okay, so we solved that problem by defining it away. The second issue is that you probably expect your quotient spaces to be orbit spaces. So in other words, the points in your quotient should correspond to the orbits by your group action. And that doesn't always happen in git. So here, the equivalence relation we get is that two points get identified in the quotient if the closures of their orbits intersect. Okay, so in git, the two major questions that we're looking at for any given problem are, what is a semi stable locus? In other words, when do you have at least one nonvanishing invariant section? And then, when two orbits come together in this unexpected way, can we describe what's happening there? Okay, so let me just quickly mention some open questions about Mackay's model. And there's lots of them, so very little is known.
00:08:36.644 - 00:08:59.572, Speaker B: I did see in a paper by Farkus and Vera around 2014 that they have an argument that a general integral curve so irreducible with up to six nodes is git semi stable. We know there are some semi stable things, and we know that irreducible curves with a small number of nodes make it.
00:08:59.588 - 00:09:00.144, Speaker A: In.
00:09:02.484 - 00:10:00.334, Speaker B: Some earlier work that I gave Zoom seminar about, I presented some additional examples. I can't actually prove that they're stable for so ten, but I can at least prove that they're semi stable for a maximal torus in so ten. And some of the singular examples that I considered there include a curve with seven cusps and also something called a balanced ribbon, which is generically non reduced. So I've known for a while that there were some singular things in Mackay's space, but I still don't have anything like a list of the singularities that are allowed. So let me just mention some of the questions that I'm interested in, and I hope that over the next several years you'll see a series of Macaulay two packages and preprints for me answering some or all of these questions. So first I'd like to know, what schemes can you get by intersecting the orthogonal Grassmannian with six plane. Okay, I'm not quite sure.
00:10:00.334 - 00:11:01.778, Speaker B: I have some ideas, but nothing like a completeness. What are the git semi stable points and how do the orbits come together when they do? Since I'm a former Kirwan student, what's the cohomology ring of the quotient? What's the homogeneous coordinate ring? Or in other words, what is the invariant ring in this case? And then finally, besides just studying the git quotient in isolation, you'd like to know more about the birational map between it and m seven. So for today's talk, I wanted to do some new work, and so I decided to start studying a family of nodal curves. So this is a highly degenerate family of curves. Here we're looking at the dual graph. So each vertex in the graph corresponds to an irreducible component of my curve, which is meant to be p one. And each edge in the graph represents a node between two irreducible components.
00:11:01.778 - 00:11:47.498, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm going to study a whole family of curves. A general member of this family is going to have eleven irreducible components and 17 nodes. And you can see that this graph, which is non planar, is mostly trivalent, except at one vertex, which I labeled three four, because when it specializes, those two vertices are going to pull apart. Okay, so by the way, I copied that graph onto the board so that you can continue looking at it even after I flip ahead to future slides. Now, I mentioned that this is actually represents not just one curve, but a whole family of curves. How do you get that? Well, if you look at component three.
00:11:47.546 - 00:11:52.544, Speaker A: Four, let's see, how do I, oops.
00:11:53.524 - 00:12:46.532, Speaker B: I forgot how to highlight. So you'll see that there's four nodes or four edges that meet the vertex labeled three four and that vertex is a p one. So you have four points on p one and you have a cross ratio between four points on p one. And so as you vary the cross ratio between those four nodes, you actually sweep out a whole one dimensional family of curves that all have this dual graph. That family has three specializations where you break that p one into two p one s by adding one more node and then by adding one more edge to this graph, you'll actually get trivalent graphs. Okay, so let me show them to you very quickly. The first one I call g zero.
00:12:46.532 - 00:13:03.024, Speaker B: And so you can see I took component three four and I split it apart in the horizontal direction. And then since I'm a good algebraic geometry, the other ones are labeled g one and g infinity. So here we pulled apart three and four in a different direction. And here is the last specialization.
00:13:04.684 - 00:13:08.062, Speaker A: Okay, but let me just go back.
00:13:08.078 - 00:13:33.594, Speaker B: And make sure I said everything I needed to. Right, so we've got a family of curves and it's got three specializations to trivalent graphs, Bayern, Eisenbutt, actually have a whole paper on what they call trivalent graph curves. And so I'm able to apply their results to the specializations. Okay, does everybody feel sufficiently well oriented to this graph? Yeah.
00:13:34.734 - 00:13:36.634, Speaker A: Oh, wait for the mic.
00:13:39.574 - 00:14:12.614, Speaker B: Can you tell me again what the nodes and graph represent in terms of. Yes. Yeah. So when people talk about dual graphs of curves, the nodes represent irreducible components. And for me, in today's lecture, all of the irreducible components will be isomorphic to p one s. And then the edges in the dual graph represent nodes between components. Okay, so moving ahead, why study this family? Seems kind of bizarre.
00:14:12.614 - 00:15:07.824, Speaker B: So let me explain why. So these are singular curves, but they all do have a dualizing sheath and it's very ample for every member of this curve. So it makes sense to think about these as canonical curves. Next, for a general member of this family, either when you're looking at the version that has a four valent node, or if you're looking at g zero, the corresponding Bioreisenberg graph curve is general in the sense of Mackay's paper. It has no g twelve g 13 or g 14. On the other hand, if you look at the other two specializations, they do pick up g 14. And so for me, this was meant to be an example that would be computationally tractable and maybe tell me what's going on in Mackay's space as a family acquires a g 14.
00:15:07.824 - 00:15:59.394, Speaker B: By the way, I know there's some commentarialists in the audience, so I'll just mention how can you see that in terms of the graph? So start with graph g zero. It has girth five, and that's telling you that there's no g one ds where d is small. And even in GT, the only four cycles pass through the four valent vertex. So we're still okay. If you draw the other two specializations, though, you'll see that there are some four cycles and you use those to build line bundles that give you the g one four s. Okay, so I have written some code in macaulay two and some code in magma to do several steps in my hoped for program. So first, I can write equations for this family in p six.
00:15:59.394 - 00:16:24.508, Speaker B: I started with the trivalent graphic curve given by g zero. I used Bayern Eisenbud's algorithm to write equations for it. Then I took components three and four and swapped out those lines for the quadrant. That means the rest of the curve of four nodes. And bang, I have my family. Next, I wrote code to compute the spin embedding of this curve. So my family is made up of a whole bunch of lines.
00:16:24.508 - 00:17:13.788, Speaker B: So I parameterized each line. I compute the spinner associated to the Lagrangian given by a general point on each line in my family. And so I was able to embed each of my lines sort of individually into p 15. Now, I had the ideal of my curve in p 15. And so I just look at the degree one forms there, and that gave me the linear space that I needed for a general curve. And now I can start studying limits either in the flat limits in the Hilbert scheme or limits in the Grassmannian as I approach the specializations. Okay, I will stop short of answering my full question, though.
00:17:13.788 - 00:17:52.284, Speaker B: I can tell you what the limits are in the Hilbert scheme, I can tell you what the limits are in the Grassmannian. I can't tell you what the limits are in quotient yet, and I'll explain why in a few slides. Okay, so first, if you're looking at a general member of this family or at the specialization that I call Gzero, everything works beautifully. All right, the spin map gives you an embedding into p 15. Again, that's not covered by Muckia's theorem. So that's a new result in and of itself. The embedded curve is given by the intersection of the orthogonal Grassmannian with p six.
00:17:52.284 - 00:18:26.664, Speaker B: And I can even compute that those are t stable, at least for maximal torus in so ten. And in future work, I hope that I can extend that to all of us at ten. I think that's probably true. All right, what about the specializations? So, first, let's look at the flat limits in the Hilbert scheme. Okay? So I'm looking at sub varieties of p 15 that have the degree and genus you would expect of a genus seven canonical curve.
00:18:28.464 - 00:18:29.256, Speaker A: Okay?
00:18:29.400 - 00:18:36.224, Speaker B: So for one of my specializations, the one that I called t equals one, the flat limit is actually the graph.
00:18:36.264 - 00:18:38.440, Speaker A: Curve you expect, okay?
00:18:38.512 - 00:18:43.364, Speaker B: It just isn't the intersection of the throne gonal grasp bonding with a six plane anymore.
00:18:44.064 - 00:18:44.640, Speaker A: Okay?
00:18:44.712 - 00:19:23.844, Speaker B: That seemed like things were going wrong in a very mild way. On the other hand, this specialization that I called t equals infinity, things are a little bit weirder. We actually have three pairs of nodes coming together to form three spatial triple points. So that's a type of singularity that I haven't seen before in work on birational geometry of module light spaces in the log minimal model program, aka hacchel program. So that seemed much more severe. Also, weirdly, the component that I labeled vertex three four didn't split into two lines in the way that I expected it to.
00:19:25.984 - 00:19:26.512, Speaker A: Okay?
00:19:26.568 - 00:20:18.294, Speaker B: So, um, it was easy to compute and study, um, the limits in the Hilbert scheme. What about our limits in the grass mannion? All right, so this was highly unexpected. Uh, you start to get surfaces instead of curves, okay? And here I wrote out what happens in words, but I think it's easier to show you this picture instead. So, um, in the limit in the Grassmannian, as we approach, um, t equals one. Um, you see a bunch of surfaces that are either spans of two lines or, um, scrolls on two lines. And basically, um, because we're not letting the quadrics degenerate, um, the quadrics that define the orthogonal grossmanian can't pick apart these components anymore. And so in the Grossmannian, you're seeing a collection of surfaces instead of a collection of lines.
00:20:18.294 - 00:20:59.524, Speaker B: And so I found the limit in the Grassmannian, but I also computed that it's not git stable. So Macai's quotient is actually replacing this by something else, and I don't know what that is. And then finally, what about t equals infinity here? It's not quite as bad. I didn't draw a picture for this one here, you only pick up one surface instead of five, but the generation is perhaps even a little more severe. We have four lines falling into a p two, which is unusually small compared to the rest of the family. Once again. Yeah.
00:20:59.524 - 00:21:32.406, Speaker B: Do you have a notion of a universal family? Sorry? All I mean is there's this result that people call git semi stable replacement. But it's just the observation that, um, geot quotients are projects, so they're complete. So, um, you know, I have a family. The general member is stable, so, you know, essential fiber has to go somewhere. What is it? Um. And, uh. And since the obvious limits are unstable, the answer is.
00:21:32.406 - 00:21:58.044, Speaker B: Well, it's something else. But what? Okay, so that's actually nearly the end of my talk. So, um, open question. I thought when I was completing these calculations that I was hoping these would be semi stable and they would be the answer, and the talk would conclude by saying, here's what Makai's model does, but instead it's a question. What does Makai's model do? All right, thank you very much.
