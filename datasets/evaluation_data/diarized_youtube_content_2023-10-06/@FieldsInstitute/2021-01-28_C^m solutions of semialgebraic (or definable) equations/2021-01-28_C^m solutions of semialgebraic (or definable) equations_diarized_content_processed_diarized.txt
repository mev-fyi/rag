00:00:01.760 - 00:00:19.234, Speaker A: Okay, welcome to this week's geometry and model theory seminar. Today's speaker is John Baptiste Campezato and he will talk to us about CM solutions of semi algebraic equations.
00:00:20.254 - 00:01:07.154, Speaker B: Okay, so thank you for the invitation. So today I'm going to talk about results that we recently obtained with Eduard Berstein and Pierre Minman. So we are all from the University of Toronto. And these results are related to two main questions, problems that I'm going to explain now. The first one being the classical witness extension problem. So the question is the following. Given a function f which is defined on a closed subset of rn, how can you determine whether f is the restriction of a CM function or not? So that's a classical question that has been studied since at least 1934.
00:01:07.154 - 00:02:18.583, Speaker B: There is a theorem of Whitney that I will explain on the next slides. But this question has been entirely solved very recently by Charles Hefferman in 2006. So he gave a condition which is necessary and sufficient on such a function to have a CM extension or to be the restriction of a CM function. I won't explain these characterization because it is out of the scope of this talk, but instead I'm going to be interested in a geometric version of this Whitney's extension problem. So I'm going to assume that the data satisfies some additional geometric properties. So namely I'm going to assume that x is a semi algebraic closed subset of Rn and that f is semi algebraic. And the question is, how can you determine whether f admits an extension which is not only cm but which is also same algebraic, so which preserves these geometric properties from the data.
00:02:18.583 - 00:03:08.424, Speaker B: So that will be the first question that I will address. And before talking about the second one, I just would like to mention the classical, the witness extension theorem from 1934. So we start with x, a closed subset of Rn together with a family of continuous function. So here alpha is a multi index, so alpha is equal to alpha one, alpha two up to alpha n. Each of the alpha I is a natural numbers and n is the dimension of the ambient euclidean space. And if you want to construct a cm function, we need to work with indices of length, electron less than or equal to m. So the sum of the alpha I is less than or equal to m.
00:03:08.424 - 00:04:18.902, Speaker B: So we are going to assume that these continuous functions satisfy these Taylor like condition. So informally it means that when we fix some alpha, the functions of higher, and this is behave like the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of f alpha. So that's informally, but that's a Taylor like condition. And when you have such a family of continuous functions. That is saying this condition we talk about Whitney field of order m and x. And what proved Whitney is that given such a Whitney field, we can construct a cm function, big f, which is defined everywhere on the euclidean space, and such that the partial derivatives of big f restricted on x, coincides with the prescribed f alpha. So here, that's simply the partial derivatives, as usual.
00:04:18.902 - 00:05:13.284, Speaker B: So you take x one, you compute the derivative with respect to x one alpha one time, with respect to x two alpha two time, and so on. So, this theorem is a partial answer, a partial answer to witness extension problem, because when alpha is equal to zero, what we obtain is that f coincides with f zero on x. And so that's a partial answer. Nonetheless, that's not a full answer, because so big f is an extension of f naught. But it is not a full answer, because this theorem does not only rely on f zero and its values, but we need to have this prescribed Taylor polynomial for big f over x. So we need this additional continuous function. It does not only rely on f zero.
00:05:13.284 - 00:06:07.504, Speaker B: As I said earlier, I'm going to be interested in geometric version of witness extension problem. And there exists a geometric version of witness extension theorem. So, namely, when the data so x and the f alpha are definable in some minimal structure, then we can construct such an f, which is also definable. So, this theorem has been proved in 1997 by Kurdika and Pavusky in the 780 case. And then it, it has been generalized to the general minimal setting simultaneously by Kurdikan Paruski and by Tamon Tanyalak. And I will need this theorem later in the talk. Okay, so, the second problem that I'm going to address today is the Brenner Pfeffermann Oster on collar problem.
00:06:07.504 - 00:07:10.404, Speaker B: So, we start with a family of functions from rn to r. So, f one, f two up to fr and phi, and we consider such an equation. So, here the unknown are some functions, phi I, and the question is under which condition these equations admit a Cm solution. So how can you determine whether this equation admits a CM solution, so that there exists Cm phi I, satisfying this equation such that phi is a linear combination of the f I risk coefficients phi I, which are Cm. So, this question has been entirely solved by Feeferman on uni. In 2014, they gave a condition on the f I and phi, which is necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence of a Cm solution to the existence of Cm phi I, satisfying these equation. And once again, I'm going to be interested in a geometric version of this problem.
00:07:10.404 - 00:08:22.248, Speaker B: So when the data satisfies some additional genetic properties, so namely, when the f I and phi are semi algebraic, how can you determine whether this equation admits a solution phi I, which is cm, but not only cm, but also semi algebraic, so which preserves the geometric property of the Fi. So that's the second question that I'm going to address today, and before continuing, I would like to make a few comments about this problem. So it arose from algebraic geometry. The initial question was to study the continuous closure of ideal. So namely, we start with some polynomials fi, and we want to determine whether a polynomial phi can be expressed as a linear combination of the f I, but where the coefficients are simply continuous functions and not polynomials. So that's what we call the continuous closure idea. And this question has been, this notion has been extensively studied.
00:08:22.248 - 00:09:23.106, Speaker B: And several other questions arose then, and especially in real algebraic geometry. And one classical question, let's say, is the following one. Assume that the data satisfies, so the phi on the f I satisfy some additional properties. Then does the existence of a continuous solution phi I imply the existence of a solution which is not only continuous, which satisfy these additional properties. And there are several positive answers. For instance, proved that when we start with polynomial data, so when the phi and the fi are polynomials, then the existence of continuous phi I satisfying this equation implies the existence of semi algebraic continuous phi I. There is a regulus version, but only the two variable k's are more generally for regulus functions on smooth surfaces by Kuhaj and Kurdika.
00:09:23.106 - 00:10:16.584, Speaker B: So a regulus function is a function, is a rational function that can be extended continuously on the everywhere on the space or plane here. And so Kuhaj and Kurdika proved that when you start with regulus function, so continuous rational functions phi and fi, the existence of a continuous solution. So the existence of continuous phi I implies the existence of regulus solutions. Nonetheless, we also have negative results. So Kolar and Novak gave a counter example in the three viable case of the previous theorem. So we cannot generalize Kuharsch and Kyrdica theorem in higher dimension. They gave an example of an equation with a continuous solution, but without a regular solution.
00:10:16.584 - 00:11:29.284, Speaker B: And similarly, Adamus and Sayedini Jad gave an example, rather data polynomials of an equation which admits a continuous solution, but no arcanalytic solution. So a function is arcanalytic if it maps by composition real analytic arcs to real analytic to real analytic arcs, or if it is, let's say, analytic along analytic arcs. Okay, so that's all for this brainer performance. So let me summarize the two questions that I'm going to address today. The first one, so is the one related to the witness extension problem. So we start with closed semi algebraic subset x of Rn, and we have a function f which is defined on x and it is semi algebraic. And the question is, if f admits a cm extension, so if f is the restriction of a cm function, then does it imply that f is the restriction of a function which is not only cm but also semi algebraic.
00:11:29.284 - 00:12:17.580, Speaker B: So, does the existence of a CM extension implies the existence of an extension which preserves these additional semi algebraicity properties of the data. So that's the first question. The second one is related to the Brenner Rochester permanent collar problem. I'm not going to work with only one equation, but with finitely many equations that I will represent using a matrix. So we start with a, a matrix whose entries are semi algebraic functions, and we have f, which is a vector valued functions whose components are semi algebraic. And we studied this equation, this equation, so f is equal to a times g. So a is the previous matrix, f is this vector valued function, and the unknown is g.
00:12:17.580 - 00:13:31.872, Speaker B: And the question once again is, if there exists a cm solution g, does it imply that there exists a solution which is not only cm, but which is also signal generics? So, which preserves these geometric assumptions on the data semi algebraicity assumption. So, these two questions have been extensively studied recently, and there are some partial results. For instance, Aschenbrenner and Tamu and Tanyalakt proved the first question for any n, so in any number of variable, but in the c, one case, so when m is equal to one. And the second question once again, for any n, so for any number of variables, but for the synapt case, for continuous functions. So the existence of a continuous solution implies the existence of a continuous semi algebraic solution. And their proofs rely on a definable version of Michael selection's lemma. Very recently, Pfeffermann and lully obtain another partial results in any regularity.
00:13:31.872 - 00:14:21.998, Speaker B: Now, so for any m, but the proofs only hold on the plane. So when we have two variables, so when n is equal to two, and the proof is related to the notion of laser bundle. But I won't talk about that because I won't use this notion today. And the results that I'm going to talk about in a few minutes. So, they answer these two questions in any variable and in any regularity. So for any n and for any m, but they will imply a lot of differentiability. Okay, so let me give the precise statement of the theorems I'm going to talk about.
00:14:21.998 - 00:15:28.134, Speaker B: So the first one is the one related to the equation problem. So we start with a matrix a whose entries are semi algebraic, and we can assign to this matrix a function r from the natural numbers to themselves, such that if you consider an equation of this form, so a is a previous semi algebraic matrix, f is a vector valued semi algebraic functions. So when you consider such an equation, the existence of a CRM solution implies the existence of a solution, which is now semi algebraic and cm. So this r is the loss of differentiability function. If you want the semi algebraic solution to be cm, we need to start with a CRM solution, which may not be semi algebraic. In general, we do not have a closed expression of r. Nonetheless, when the coefficients of a are not only semi algebraic, but also synfinity or analytic, which is equivalent in this case, then we can prove that r is actually an affine function.
00:15:28.134 - 00:16:32.044, Speaker B: But I won't talk about this special case today. The second theorem, the second result, which is related to the witness extension problem, is the following one. So we start with x closed some algebraic subset of Rn, and we can associate to x a function r. So from the natural numbers to themselves, which satisfies the following property. So if you consider a function f, which is semi algebraic and which is defined on x, then if f is the restriction of a CRM function, then it is the restriction of a function which is cm but also semi algebraic. So the existence of a CRM extension implies the existence of an extension which is cm but also semi algebraic. So once again, if you want the semi geographic extension to be cm, we need to start with a CRM extension.
00:16:32.044 - 00:16:49.504, Speaker B: So I'm going to say a few words about the proofs of these theorems, and the first step is that actually these two theorems are going to be special cases of a common generalization.
00:16:50.524 - 00:16:52.908, Speaker C: Please, can I ask a question before you proceed?
00:16:53.036 - 00:16:53.744, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:54.124 - 00:17:15.990, Speaker C: So this r is a function of x, right? So for any x you get a different r. Yes. Can you say something about how bad can this r be like? If a is terrible, then this r can be like a function that grows. You can only bound it. Can you bound it somehow? I mean, I guess the conjecture is that in principle r should be m, right?
00:17:16.142 - 00:17:42.390, Speaker B: I will explain how do we construct this r later? And it will depend on them, and we will work locally on strata for stratification. And because of. Okay, if you talk about it, I will. If you do not have a closed shape or information about r, except in the first problem in the case where it is the matrix is infinity. But we don't have a closed, we don't have a closed expression for this.
00:17:42.422 - 00:17:43.994, Speaker C: R. Okay, thank you.
00:17:48.294 - 00:18:26.434, Speaker B: Okay, so next, let me explain, how do we obtain this, the common generalization of these two results. So these, these slides, so these common, the passage from these two results to. So the common generalization will rely heavily on the resolution of singularities. So first, let me start with the equation problem. So we start with an equation of this form. A times g is equal to f. So a is a matrix whose entries are semi algebraic, f is a semi algebraic vector valued functions, and the unknown is g.
00:18:26.434 - 00:19:11.442, Speaker B: And by resolution of singularities, there exists phi, a Nash proper mapping. So let me say Nash simply means semi algebraic and synfinity, or equivalently semi algebraic and analytic. So by resolution of singularities, we can there exist phi. So a national proper mapping such that when you compose a with phi, we obtain a matrix. Those entries are not only semi algebraic, but also Nash, so also real analytic. So what I'm going to do first is just to replace x by phi of y. So I'm going to compose this equation with phi, so a of x.
00:19:11.442 - 00:20:15.554, Speaker B: When I compose this, phi will become a tilde of y, which is a matrix, semi algebraic and real analytic. Or Nash, when I replace f composed with Tilde by f composed with phi, I will get f tilde, which is a semi algebraic vector valued functions. And then, so I get this kind of equation that I would like to solve. So on the one hand, this question is simpler because a tilde is, is not only semi algebraic, but it is also, it is also real analytics. So we have some additional rigidity on it. But on the other hand, this question is more difficult because it is no longer from, let's say, a question lying in the context of linear algebra, because there is this composition is phi that we will have to take into account. So in one direction the question is easier, but we also have an additional difficulty that we will have to take care of.
00:20:15.554 - 00:21:09.554, Speaker B: Okay. And for the second question, for the witness extension problem. So we start with x, which is a semi generic enclosed. Once again, by resolution of singularities, we can prove that there exists phi, a Nash copper mapping such that the image of phi is exactly x. So that's the uniformization theorem. And if you have f, a function defined on x, and if you have g, a function defined everywhere on rn, to say that g is an extension of f is equivalent to say that g composed with phi coincides with f composed with phi indeed, the image of phi is exactly x. So to check that g coincides with f and x, it's enough to check that g compose with phi coincides with f compose with phi everywhere on m.
00:21:09.554 - 00:22:01.748, Speaker B: So I just replace f compose with phi by this f Tilde. And what we can notice is that we get an equation which is very similar to the previous one. So that's a special case when a is actually the identity matrix. So if we are able to solve the prove the theorem for this kind of equations, we will get, we will get the answer for both problems, the equation problems, and, and the extension problem. So it's enough to focus at these, at this kind of equations, and that's going to be the common generalization. So we start with matrix a with entries are not only semi algebraic, but also analytic. So Nash, then we also have mapping, which is Nash and proper phi, and we can associate to this data.
00:22:01.748 - 00:22:51.516, Speaker B: So, to a and phi a function r from the natural numbers to themselves, satisfying the following property. So we have an equation similar to the one on the previous slides. So f is a vector valued semi algebraic function, a is the Nash matrix from the assumptions, phi is proper Nash mapping and g is the unknown. And the result is that if this equation admits CRM solution g, then it admits a solution which is Cm, but also semialgeneral. So that's the common generalization. And if you prove this theorem, then we will get the two previous theorems as curios. So I will spend the remaining part of the talk talking about the proof of this theorem.
00:22:51.516 - 00:24:21.344, Speaker B: And before that, I just would like to say a few words about how general are our results. So, actually, for conciseness, I stated the results in the same algebraic setting. But our results and proof hold more generally, if you assume that the involved objects are definable in structure which is polynomially bounded, and which admits a synfinity cell decomposition in the statements and in the proofs, you can replace semi algebraic by definable as soon as the minimal structure that we consider is polynomially bounded. So the exponential is not definable, and admits synchronicity cell decomposition. The reason why we need these two assumptions is to be able to use resolution of singularities to get this phi that I obtain in two slides ago. And let me explain why do we need these two assumptions? So, first, when we have an a minimal structure which is polynomially bounded using a theorem of Chris Miller, we can prove that the set of definable synfinity functions is a quasi analytic class. So, meaning that, meaning that the Taylor puts polynomial function is injective.
00:24:21.344 - 00:25:41.668, Speaker B: There is no non zero flat function. So you cannot have a function like exponential to the minus one over x two whose Taylor expansion at zero is equal to zero, whereas it is non zero in an, except at zero in a neighborhood of zero. So that's the meaning of quasi analytic we do not have nonzero flat functions, and that's interesting because resolution of singularities holds for quasi analytic functions. So when we have an idea spanned by infinitely many quasi analytic functions, then we can apply resolution of singularities, and particularly we can improve the uniformization theorem in a way similar to the sub analytic case, but to the sub quas analytic case. So a subcase analytic set is simply the projection of, let's say a semi causality case, a function which is a set which is locally defined by inequalities and equalities of quasi analytic functions. So by resolution of singularities, we can prove that such a set is the image of a synfinity definable proper mapping. So a phi, like for a function like the phi two slides ago, the issues that we would like to work with not only the sub quiz analytic sets, but with all definable sets.
00:25:41.668 - 00:26:34.564, Speaker B: And that's where this synfinity cell decomposition is going to be of interest. Because if we add this extra assumption, then by a simple t cell decomposition, any definable set is actually subcase analytic. So when we have these two assumptions, we can prove that any definable set is the image of a definable synfinity proper mapping. And so we can, we can mimic what I did two slides ago to pass from the two problems, the two results from the beginning to the common generalization. Okay, so that's just a parenthesis for the definer, for the o minimal case. So from now, from now on, I will, I will only use the word same algebraic. But everywhere you can summarize, you can just replace semi algebraic by definable.
00:26:34.564 - 00:27:15.868, Speaker B: Okay, so let me explain the main ideas of the proof of the common generalization. I won't give full details. I will only give some ideas. And also I will insist, I will insist on the places where the loss of differentiability is involved. Okay, so that's going to be a proof by induction. So by induction of the dimension. So let me recall that we would like to solve an equation of this form.
00:27:15.868 - 00:28:15.754, Speaker B: So f is equal to a times g composite with phi. And we are going to work so above the image of phi, and the minor j is the following one. If you can solve this question, you are going to prove that there exists a b of dimension less than phi of m, such that if you can solve the, let me repeat that there exists a b closed some algebraic subset of the image of phi, which is of dimension less than the image, such that if you can solve the question on b, then you can solve the question of phi of m. And then we repeat the process. There exists a b prime similar to very close subset of b of lower dimensions, such that if you can solve, if you can prove the theorem on B prime, then you can prove the problem on B. So each time we're going to reduce the dimension. So of course, after finitely many steps, that will be, the theorem will be reduced to the zero dimensional case.
00:28:15.754 - 00:29:22.100, Speaker B: So to the, so there is many steps. Nonetheless, what I'm going to prove here is stronger than the common generalization, as it was stated, because I'm not only going to work at the level of values, but I'm going to work at the level of Taylor polynomials. So when I say that there exists that you can solve the problem of rb prime, actually I'm going to assume that there is a solution over b prime and up to subtract to. So there is a solution, let's say g over b prime and up to subtract a times g, compose v phi on both sides of the equality, we can assume that this equation is actually flat. It's actually flat that the constant term of this equation is flat. So all the derivative up to a certain order are equal to zero. And when I, and when I say that I'm going to construct a solution, g tilde, which is g tilde, that's not go, that's not only going to be a solution of this equation at the level of values, but that will be a solution at the level of the derivatives.
00:29:22.100 - 00:30:10.794, Speaker B: So the derivative of the left hand side up to a certain order will coincide with the derivative of the right hand side up to a certain order. So equivalently the difference is going to be a flat. So let me just repeat very quickly this statement. By induction assumptions, we can assume that the constant term f is flat. So all the derivatives are equal to zero versus b prime. We have a solution g of some order t. And we would like to construct a semi algebraic solution not only at the level of values, but at the level of tailor polynomials and which is now not only ck, but also semi algebraic and the loss of differentiabilities given by these functionality.
00:30:12.534 - 00:30:21.094, Speaker C: A very stupid question. So k was m before, right? Okay, k was little m in the previous slides, right?
00:30:21.134 - 00:30:26.246, Speaker B: So this is the order k. Yes, yes, yes.
00:30:26.310 - 00:30:26.990, Speaker C: Okay. Okay.
00:30:27.062 - 00:30:31.662, Speaker B: But that's going to be approved by induction. So the, yeah, it doesn't matter, but.
00:30:31.678 - 00:30:33.430, Speaker C: Just the index name is now, yeah.
00:30:33.462 - 00:30:45.674, Speaker B: But that's not exactly the same because that's this case, that's the, this t is the function for this induction step. And then you have to, you have to work with an upper bound of all these t.
00:30:47.654 - 00:30:50.934, Speaker C: Okay, but, but k is the eleven or differentiability you want to solve in its step.
00:30:50.974 - 00:31:08.164, Speaker B: Yes. Okay. Yes. So I'm going to assume that I can, I have a solution at the level of Ctk and I want to obtain a symmetric solution which is Ck. Thanks. So that's similar to the m, but only for this inductive step. Okay, so let me explain the strategy of the proof of this proposition.
00:31:08.164 - 00:32:17.096, Speaker B: So the idea is that you are going to construct a semi algebraic written field, and then we will apply theorem to obtain the function g. As I said, by the induction hypothesis, the constant term of the equation is flat. So I'm just going to assume that the g that I'm going to construct will be equal to zero and b prime. So where the constant term is going to be equal to zero and on the complement of b prime, this g will be a solution of the equation, but at the level of the Taylor polynomials, not only at the level of the values. So this notation is simply the Taylor polynomial of degree l of f at a of the components of f, the same for the entries of a. And we should not forget this composition which is involved. Okay, so as I said, you are going to solve this question in the, we are going to construct a written field in the complement of b prime, which satisfies the equation of the level of Taylor polynomial, and we will extend it by zero.
00:32:17.096 - 00:33:37.734, Speaker B: And that's where there will be a first loss of differentiability. So using resolution of singularities and lawyers of each inequality, we can prove that given as m algebraic set b, there exists an natural number rho such that if you take two points close enough and b, you can join them by an arc whose length is less than or equal to c times the equilibrium distance to the power one over rho. So c here is a constant, is a local constant on rho, is the same everywhere, and b, and because of this rho, when we will extend our Whitney field, we will have a lot of differentiability. So g is going to be a continuous field. That will be, that will be, that will be a witness field of order l on the complement of b prime, but when we will extend it by zero everywhere. What we will think is a witness field which is only on order k, assuming that l is greater than or equal to k rho. So if you start using a Whitney field of order k rho and the complement of b prime, the continuous extension by zero will be of order k.
00:33:37.734 - 00:34:29.790, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the first loss of differentiality. That's to, that's when we are going to work in the complement on b prime and to extend by continuity everywhere on b. So now I'm going to explain how do, how do we construct this Whitney field G. So first we want to solve this equation at the level of Taylor polynomial. So we want to solve this equation. So you have a ther poll of f, the therpinomial of a ther poll of phi, and we're interested in the solution g. And I'm going to introduce some analogues of the kernel, but for this problem, which is not from linear algebra.
00:34:29.790 - 00:35:32.634, Speaker B: So the kernel in linear algebraic problem, in linear algebra, problem is going to measure how undetermined is the equation. And here the module of relations in some sense very similar. It's going to measure how undetermined is the problem or how non unique is the solution. So namely the module of relation of other air over a point b is the set of power series such that which satisfy the homogeneous associate equation. So the equation without constant term, so the set of w such that the Taylor expansion of a times w composed with Taylor expression of phi is equal to zero up to order r. So these module of relations is analogous to the kernel when you work with a linear algebraic equation. And similarly, the difference of two solutions is going to be an element of the module of relationship and the second.
00:35:32.634 - 00:37:03.344, Speaker B: And as I said, so this g is not unique, and we will try to add some. Okay, that's not very formal, what I'm explaining, but roughly, we are going to add some additional equations in a certain way to make the solution unique so that we will be able to express it in terms of the data which are same algebraically, to get a similar equipment field. And to do that, there will be a second loss of differentiability, which is due to the chevalier's function. So let me make that a little bit more precise. Given a natural number l, there exists a natural number r such that we can express the derivative of a solution g of order less than or equal to l, the initial l in terms of the derivatives of the, of the data. As soon as we look at the derivatives of up to another high enough so if you look, if you look at the equation, but if you look at an equation but for the data regular enough, then we will have some kind of uniqueness, which, allowing us to express g in terms of the data and to get something which is in this case semi algebraic. And this chevalier functions is telling us for the expected order we would like to have up to which order we should look at the derivative of f.
00:37:03.344 - 00:38:10.322, Speaker B: So more formally, what we are going to prove is that when we fix an l, there exists a stratification of b. So, stratification is a partition, but such that the strata glue in a very nice way, meaning that the boundary of a stratum is made of a strata of lower dimension. And over each stratum we will have this chevrolet function. So we will associate to l this r such that when we look at the module of relation for another r large enough, when you look at the truncation up to degree l, so when we just look at the, at the concussion of the element w up to l, we won't lose information as soon as we look at r big enough. That's more precise. That's what I explained a little bit informally on the previous slide, and that's what is going to give us this kind of uniqueness informally. And the issue at this step is that that's a punctual notion, because over Hb we have a module of relations, but what we want is to construct a Whitney field.
00:38:10.322 - 00:39:03.614, Speaker B: So we would like to construct something which is uniform. And to achieve this step, I'm going to divide with respect to the relations. So I'm going to use something which is very similar to Grosvenor basis, which is related to Hironaka's formal division. So that's a generalization of the euclidean division. So, but I'm going, I'm going to divide a power series by infinitely many power series. So I would like to express f as the sum of fi qi plus r such that this expression is unique. So to obtain uniqueness, we will need to replace the, we will need to replace this condition on the degree for the usual euclidean division.
00:39:03.614 - 00:39:49.114, Speaker B: So since we work with power series, first, what we're going to do is to work with the order instead of the degree, and they will need to explain a few things to be able to obtain these uniqueness. Okay, but first let me fix a few notations. Actually, I'm going to work with vector valued power series. This notation is simply a very concise way to express a vector valued power series. F alpha j is actually the coefficient of degree alpha of the jth component. So that's all. So f alpha, j is the coefficient of degree alpha of the jth component of f.
00:39:49.114 - 00:40:26.208, Speaker B: Hence the space of exponents is this one. So n to the n times one, two up to p, and we can totally order these space as follows. So we just look at this lexicographic order. So first you look at the full degree of a monomial. In case of equality, you look at the component number, and then you look at the degree variable per variable. In a way similar to the Newton diagram, we can define the support of f. So that's the set of exponents with a nonzero coefficient.
00:40:26.208 - 00:41:26.770, Speaker B: And since we have a totally, since we have an order, we can, you can define the initial exponent of f as the minimum of the support of f. So then the lowest exponent, the lowest exponent in the expansion of f. Okay, so let me state these ironeckers formal division theorem. So we start with vector valued power series phi one, phi two up to phi q. So I'm going to divide with respect to this phi I, and in order to obtain this uniqueness, I will use this diagram that I'm going to explain in order to obtain a condition that will replace the degree condition for the usual euclidean division. So first I start with phi one. I take its initial exponent, I put it in the, in this, in the space of exponents, and I take the first quadrant coming from this point.
00:41:26.770 - 00:42:16.346, Speaker B: So everything which is above and on the right. So on this drawing, I assume that n is equal to two and j is equal to one, because I only have a two dimensional screen. But that's what it generalizes easily for ir p and ir n. Then I repeat this process with phi two. So I take the initial exponent of phi two, I put it on the diagram, and I take everything, I take the first quadrant coming from this point, so everything which is above on the right, except the room that was already taken by, by delta one. And I repeat with phi three and so on. At the end I will have a diagram of this shape, actually finitely magnetic diagram one for each j.
00:42:16.346 - 00:43:29.224, Speaker B: And the complement of this diagram is going to be, is going to be very important for this talk and is going to be denoted by Delta. And then the theorem is the following one. When we have a vector valued power series, it can be uniquely written as the sum of the qi phi I plus a remainder as soon as we add these two additional properties, which is that the support of, when we shift the support of qi by the initial expand of phi it stays in delta I. And very important, for the remaining of this talk that's analogous in the division to the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of b of I. We add the condition that the support of the remainder should stay in the complement of the diagram. So this delta here, the area which is in light gray. And with these theorem we can obtain something which is very similar to the notion of Grobner basis.
00:43:29.224 - 00:44:31.922, Speaker B: So we start with a module m. So that's a module of vector valued, some module of vector valued power series for each, for every nonzero element of m, I'm just going to put its initial exponent on this set. But since that's a module, it is closed by scalar multiplication. So if I have this point, I can multiply it by y one and I have the point on the right. Similarly, I can multiply by y two, so I have the point above and so on. So because of these, because a module is closed by scalar multiplication, these objects, the diagram of initial exponents look like that. So it looks like the unit of the delta I from the previous, from the previous slide particularly, it has finally many vertices.
00:44:31.922 - 00:45:51.374, Speaker B: So these dots here which are defining, they have a very precise definition that, but I'm not going to give it, but there are some special, finitely many special elements, these dots that are the vertices of the diagram of initial exponents. And for each of these vertices I'm going to take a representative so an element of m whose initial exponent is exactly the vertex. And then we have this corollary, which is a consequence of the Ivanaka's division theorem. So there are several important points in this corollary. The first one is that this phi I are actually generating m, and formal power series is in m if and only if. When we perform the ironic assemble division with respect to the phi I, the remainder is equal to zero. And that's not too difficult to see because so when we look at this formula, if we know that r is equal to zero, of course f is the sum of the qi phi I.
00:45:51.374 - 00:46:32.724, Speaker B: The phi I are in m, they are closed by scalar multiplication by addition. So f is in the module. And conversely, if you know that f is in the module, then f minus the sum of the qi phi I is equal to r. So r is an element of the module whose support is entirely in the complement of the diagram. But by definition, the only element of the module whose complement is outside the diagram is going to be zero. That's how we prove these, these two facts. And we can, if we fix some additional conditions on the phi I actually there is a unique, there is some kind of uniqueness.
00:46:32.724 - 00:47:53.304, Speaker B: So the standard, what we call a standard basis. So there is a set of generators which is unique if you add these extra assumptions from this exponent plus a few things which are in the complement of the diagram. Okay, so let me go back to the theorem and to obtain this uniformity that was missing. I won't be able to assume that the module of relations is actually going to be constant on each stratum. But what we can obtain is that actually the diagram of the diagram of initial exponent of the middle of collation is constant on each stratum up to refining the stratification of shrinking the strata. So now we have a stratification which is going to be useful in what follows. And if we recall in the induction step, the goal was to prove that if you want to work on b, we need to construct a b prime of lower dimension, such that if we can solve the problem on b prime, then we can solve the problem on b.
00:47:53.304 - 00:48:39.666, Speaker B: So the b prime that we are going to consider is actually the union of strata of dimension less than dimension of b. So from now on I'm going to assume that the equation is trivial over v prime. So the constant term is flat over v prime. And I want to study this equation. Okay, so now we have all, we have all the tools necessary to construct the expected Whitney field G. Let me recall the situation. So we want to solve these equations.
00:48:39.666 - 00:49:39.322, Speaker B: The level of Taylor polynomials over the complement of b prime and by assumptions we have a solution, but which is not semi algebraic up to order t. So when we look at the Taylor expansion, this solution is going to give us a Taylor polynomial WB, which satisfies this equation. So this Wb comes from the assumptions, but that's a point wise. We do that for every bit. So there's something which is point wise. And now I'm going to start from this WB on to divide with respect to the standard basis of the module of relation over b in order to get my whittling field. So I take the standard basis phi I previously constructed over the module of relationship and I divide WB with respect to this standard basis.
00:49:39.322 - 00:50:10.704, Speaker B: So from, with respect to phi one up to phi Q. And it's going to give me a reminder, veto. And there are two things which are interesting here. First, veto, since it is a reminder, its support is in the complement of the diagram. And the second interesting thing which is that since Wb is a point way solution. It's a solution over b. When we do the difference wb minus v two, we have the sum of the qi phi I.
00:50:10.704 - 00:50:44.284, Speaker B: So we have an element of the module of relations. And since Wb was a solution of the equation, v two is going to be a solution of the equation. So we have constructed a solution of the equation at the level of the Taylor polynomials. Actually, we can express v two in terms of the standard basis that we can express in terms of the data. So veto is going to be semi algebraic. And the difficult thing is going to prove that this veto is going to give us a Whitney field. So it's going to be semi algebraic because we can express it in terms of the data.
00:50:44.284 - 00:51:24.744, Speaker B: And the difficult thing is to check that this veto is actually a Whitney field. So we have a point, we have a solution, we have a field veto, which is a solution everywhere, which is symmetric. And we need to check that it is a Whitney field. And to do that I'm just going to use everything that we used before. So we know that veto, we know that veto is a solution of the equation. So it satisfies this equation at the level of Taylor polynomials. And what I'm going to do is to apply these operator.
00:51:24.744 - 00:51:59.286, Speaker B: So I recall that the members of these equations, they are Taylor polynomials. So there are polynomials in y, but the coefficients are functions. And this operator is simply that DBV consists in taking the punctual directional derivatives with respect to v. So the derivative of the coefficients. And this operator consists in taking the directional derivatives, the formal directional derivatives. So with respect to y. But we know that the Taylor expansion of the derivative is the formal derivative of the Taylor expansion.
00:51:59.286 - 00:52:35.778, Speaker B: So particularly when we apply this operator to something which is, let's say regular enough, we will get zero. So when you apply this operator to f, to the Taylor expression of f, you get zero. When you apply this operator to the tail expression of a, we get zero. And after the product rule, the only thing that you have left is a times this operator applied to v. But that means that this operator applied to v is in the module of relation. But because we have taken some derivative, we lost one order. So we passed from r to r minus one.
00:52:35.778 - 00:53:24.678, Speaker B: But that's not important because, because of our choice of r coming from the Chevalier's function, if you started with r large enough. Actually we did not, we did not lose any information. What we have is actually going to be in the module of relation up to order R and D r minus one. So let me summarize where we are. So we applied this operator to the field we constructed, and we see that it comes from an element which is in the module of relation up to order r. But we also know that by construction it comes from a reminder. So the support of g is in the complement of the diagram, in the light gray area.
00:53:24.678 - 00:54:26.272, Speaker B: But when we take these derivatives, the only thing we can do is to get closer and closer to the axis, because y to the n is going to become n minus n to the y minus n minus one. So if you start with something which is in the complement of the diagram, after applying this operator, we stay in the complement of the diagram. So we just proved that this operator applied to our field is in the middle of relation, but it is also in the complement of the diagram of the module of relations, meaning that it is equal to zero. So we just proved that the partial derivative, the punctual derivatives, coincide with the formal directional derivative. And that's enough, because according to a theorem of Stan's, what I said before, that the Taylor polynomial of the derivative is the formal derivative of the third polynomial as a converse. So that's enough. So thanks to this property, we obtained that the g that we constructed is actually a Whitney field.
00:54:26.272 - 00:55:33.854, Speaker B: So we have well constructed over each stratum a solution of the problem, which is a Whitney field and which is SEM algebraic. Now, the last step is that we need to glue from, we need to glue between the strata, and that's where you will have a third loss of differentiability. Using inequality, we can start that. If you start once again with a higher level of regularity, the coefficient of the Whitney field reconstructed, they will go to zero when we get closer to the boundary, when we get closer to the boundary of the stratum. But that's okay, because by assumptions, the equation, the constant term of the equation is flat and b prime and b prime is exactly the lower dimensional strata. So particularly on the boundary of our stratum, the question is trivial. The constant time is flat.
00:55:33.854 - 00:56:45.714, Speaker B: So if you start with, if you start with regularity large enough, then you will be able to extend by zero what the vector, the Whitney field we constructed at the boundary of the stratum. And it's going to be okay, since the equation is flat and b prime. So under boundary of the stratum. So thanks to that we have, we've just constructed a Whitney field of order k everywhere on b, and which satisfy the equation of the level of Taylor polynomial. So we can conclude using electrolym. So we can associate to this g a function small g, which is going to be ck, which is going to be semi algebraic, and such that its Taylor polynomial will coincide with big g over b. So particularly, we will have that in satisfied this equation at the level of tailored polynomial, or equivalently that the derivatives are, these difference are closed, vanishing up to order k.
00:56:45.714 - 00:57:27.006, Speaker B: And that's all for the, for the proof. Let me just summarize the loss of differentiability. It appeared at three places, but each time that was something which was in some sense either on a stratum or at one step. So we have to be careful that we can obtain a loss of differential d, which is no longer local, but global. So the row, that was probably a different row for each induction step. But since we have finitely many iterations, you can just take an upper bound of the row, the chevalier's function. We have a different chevalier function for each stratum.
00:57:27.006 - 00:57:50.764, Speaker B: But since we have finitely many strata, we can just take an upper bound of the, of the chevalier's function. And similarly, for each stratum, you obtain this loyalty, which expand sigma. And since we have finitely many strata, you can just take an upper bound of this sigma, so that these loss of differentiability function is well defined. And that's all. Thank you very much for listening.
00:57:53.784 - 00:58:05.204, Speaker A: Well, thank you very much. Yeah. Any questions or comments?
00:58:12.564 - 00:59:06.534, Speaker C: So, I have a question, but it's like a side question, but still. So, in the beginning, you explained that the same algebraically, semi algebraically replaced by polynomial, bounded or minimal structures with a nice cell decomposition. And you explained that the proof doesn't work. For instance, if you put exponent and you don't have quasi analyst anymore, and you don't have like resolution of singularities and so on, but the result itself, do you think, is there like an easy example, like if you introduce exponent, and now you look at like r x, right? So do you have like an example of a function that is, you know, extends to a, I mean, the result itself, if you have a CM extension, do you have like definable, same extension? Or is there, is there like an obvious example that I can see?
00:59:09.084 - 00:59:18.772, Speaker B: I don't have a control example in mind for. I don't have a contra example from, without these two assumptions for the marginal definable case. Okay, thanks.
00:59:18.828 - 00:59:22.984, Speaker C: Okay, it's interesting, I think.
00:59:28.684 - 00:59:32.924, Speaker D: Okay, maybe hear me?
00:59:34.184 - 00:59:35.164, Speaker B: No problem.
00:59:41.224 - 00:59:42.136, Speaker C: Yes, we hear you.
00:59:42.200 - 00:59:42.488, Speaker B: Yes.
00:59:42.536 - 00:59:43.352, Speaker E: Yes, we do.
00:59:43.488 - 00:59:51.724, Speaker D: Oh, do I understand correctly that in dimension two you have no loss of differentiability?
00:59:52.424 - 00:59:56.844, Speaker B: Yes, there is no loss of differentiability in Fefferman and Luli.
01:00:00.544 - 01:00:07.884, Speaker D: Yes. So maybe a conjecture for higher dimensions or no chance.
01:00:09.224 - 01:00:51.944, Speaker B: Oh, that's independent. That's a bad. You try to work on that. Okay. But the proof of Ferfaman and Mulli relies a lot on the fact that they work over the plane that in the two variable case we don't find an easy way to generalize it to higher dimension. But maybe there's another way to solve it. Or maybe there's a way to generalize the proof that we don't see.
01:00:52.694 - 01:01:09.434, Speaker D: But. Okay. This technique of Hiranaka division which you used to extend Whitney fields, it looks for me quite new stuff. Is it correct?
01:01:09.934 - 01:01:22.054, Speaker B: No, I think that Eduardo and Pierre used this. Use this. Uh. You're gonna cast formal division in several of the previous paper. But.
01:01:22.354 - 01:01:23.574, Speaker D: Okay, okay.
01:01:36.954 - 01:01:52.494, Speaker B: But, and there are some, there are some interesting consequences of this. That's a very interesting theorem. This Ivanaka has formal division. I think for instance we can obtain an elementary proof of the actin rays function for the proper versace. So yeah, that's something which is very powerful.
01:01:54.874 - 01:01:56.174, Speaker D: Okay, thanks.
01:02:16.534 - 01:02:22.702, Speaker E: You mentioned Jean Baptiste Sts theorem. Can you remind me what it is exactly?
01:02:22.878 - 01:02:35.010, Speaker B: Oh yeah, I can do that. If you have, if you have a Whitney field whose coefficients are c one.
01:02:35.142 - 01:02:35.570, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:02:35.642 - 01:02:49.174, Speaker B: And such that the. And such that the. Are you talking about this result? I think I'm confused in this result, this one I used at the very beginning. Can you repeat the question?
01:02:49.674 - 01:02:57.066, Speaker E: Yes. You mentioned at some point stns theorem, am I right?
01:02:57.210 - 01:02:58.814, Speaker B: Yes, but now I'm concerned.
01:03:00.554 - 01:03:02.972, Speaker E: It was close to the end of the lecture.
01:03:03.138 - 01:03:38.580, Speaker B: Okay, okay. Maybe I didn't choose a good name, but. Okay, so if you have a field, rc one. So the one I mentioned there. If you have a field whose coefficients are c one and such that the formal derivative, the formal derivative coincides with the derivative of the coefficients, then actually we have a Cl Whitney field. And the idea is that at each step and we will compare the derivative, you will be able to express them. We will be able to express the coefficients in terms of the previous derivative of the coefficients in terms of the previous coefficient.
01:03:38.580 - 01:03:41.028, Speaker B: So you will increase the regularity at each.
01:03:41.116 - 01:03:46.224, Speaker E: Okay. Okay, thank you.
01:03:47.924 - 01:03:50.864, Speaker B: The other doctor. But the name, I'm not sure. The age of the good name.
01:03:58.064 - 01:04:09.684, Speaker A: All right. Any other questions, comments? If not, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you very much. Very nice talk.
01:04:11.264 - 01:04:12.204, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:04:14.224 - 01:04:18.648, Speaker A: We haven't planned any seminars yet, but you'll hear from me.
01:04:18.816 - 01:04:21.974, Speaker B: Can I just say something to Jean Philippe?
01:04:22.434 - 01:04:23.026, Speaker A: Sorry?
01:04:23.130 - 01:04:24.034, Speaker B: Can I say something to Jean.
01:04:24.074 - 01:04:24.834, Speaker A: Oh yes, of course.
01:04:24.914 - 01:04:33.898, Speaker B: I did not use the good name. This theorem is called Borel's theorem. Sns. That was the one I used there. I made a confusion with the name. Sorry for that.
01:04:33.946 - 01:04:36.094, Speaker E: So now I'm confused, too.
01:04:36.474 - 01:04:51.394, Speaker B: The theorem that's called stns, that's the one I used there to extend a Whitney field. And the theorem that I call the snake, it's a mistake. Borel's Borrel Dakota.
01:04:51.514 - 01:04:52.762, Speaker E: Okay. Thank you.
01:04:52.818 - 01:04:54.494, Speaker B: Sorry, but the conclusion.
01:04:55.994 - 01:04:56.894, Speaker E: Thank you.
01:04:59.034 - 01:05:00.454, Speaker A: All right. Anything else?
01:05:01.874 - 01:05:02.614, Speaker B: No?
01:05:04.514 - 01:05:12.762, Speaker A: Okay. Well, thank you very much for tuning in, and you'll hear from me when we have something else lined up. Great.
01:05:12.818 - 01:05:13.130, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:05:13.162 - 01:05:19.414, Speaker A: If any of you is interested in giving a talk, let me know. Right. Anytime.
01:05:19.914 - 01:05:20.866, Speaker E: Okay.
01:05:21.050 - 01:05:22.694, Speaker A: Okay. Have a nice day.
01:05:23.794 - 01:05:24.694, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:05:25.834 - 01:05:26.434, Speaker A: Nice talk.
01:05:26.474 - 01:05:27.254, Speaker E: Thank you.
01:05:28.034 - 01:05:30.054, Speaker B: Goodbye. Bye.
