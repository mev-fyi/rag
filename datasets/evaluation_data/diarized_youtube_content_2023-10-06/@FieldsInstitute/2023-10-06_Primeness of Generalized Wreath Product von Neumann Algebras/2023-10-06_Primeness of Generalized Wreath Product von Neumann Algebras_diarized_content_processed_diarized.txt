00:00:01.000 - 00:00:01.136, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:01.136 - 00:00:21.434, Speaker B: Thank you. And I'm really excited to be at Fields. I think I lasted at fields like five years ago as an undergrad, actually. So it's nice to be back in Canada and talking and, well, thanks to the organizers for sending me money to come up here. Well, I guess you haven't promising to send me money, I guess I should say. That's right.
00:00:23.414 - 00:00:23.766, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:23.790 - 00:00:33.288, Speaker B: So this is the, I think the second or third iteration of the talk. And a major flaw in the previous iterations was that I don't think I actually used the word wreath product after the title.
00:00:33.376 - 00:00:34.400, Speaker A: So I have fixed that.
00:00:34.432 - 00:00:36.296, Speaker B: So people who have seen an iteration.
00:00:36.320 - 00:00:44.512, Speaker A: Of this before, it's been improved. Okay. So, actually, I don't know I should.
00:00:44.528 - 00:01:00.372, Speaker B: Be happy or upset with changing because he talked a little bit about primeness this morning, but I'm going to give more history than he was able to write on the board because I have the advantage of just clicking instead of writing, writing. Talk a little bit about factors and get warmed up with some kind of.
00:01:00.388 - 00:01:03.636, Speaker A: Dynamic stuff, and then we'll get more.
00:01:03.660 - 00:01:05.660, Speaker B: Into the meat and talk about, actually.
00:01:05.772 - 00:01:16.584, Speaker A: More talking about property, not gamma and kind of rigidity and some representations related to that, and we'll get into some results at the end.
00:01:17.404 - 00:01:18.224, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:19.564 - 00:01:20.504, Speaker A: Okay, so.
00:01:21.104 - 00:01:32.736, Speaker B: Okay, good. I did fix, actually, like an hour ago, it said no minimal projections. And I was like, oh, that's not a good start. All right, so type one factor is just a one moment algebra with trivial center and minimal projections, right?
00:01:32.760 - 00:01:35.912, Speaker A: So our b of h. And if.
00:01:35.928 - 00:01:37.080, Speaker B: We have a factor that's not type.
00:01:37.112 - 00:01:38.744, Speaker A: One, we call it prime.
00:01:38.904 - 00:01:42.384, Speaker B: If you can't split it into a tensor product, it's like changing said.
00:01:42.544 - 00:01:50.066, Speaker A: You can actually also define this for non factors. Um, oh, we're going to stick to the case of factors because, at least.
00:01:50.090 - 00:01:51.146, Speaker B: In principle, you can use the integral.
00:01:51.170 - 00:01:55.338, Speaker A: Decomposition to study non factors. I say in principle because I'm a.
00:01:55.346 - 00:01:59.934, Speaker B: Little traumatized currently from direct integrals, so I don't want to think about them too much.
00:02:00.874 - 00:02:07.074, Speaker A: And the other thing is that, I mean, when you're dealing with prime, you kind of, you know, you assume something.
00:02:07.114 - 00:02:13.386, Speaker B: Is not prime and try to drive some kind of contradiction, and you have all kinds of combat slying around, right? I mean, if you have two tensor.
00:02:13.410 - 00:02:16.636, Speaker A: Factors, then the combat of one is the other.
00:02:16.740 - 00:02:23.184, Speaker B: So having factoriality is going to allow computing all these relative combatants is a lot, make it a lot easier.
00:02:24.724 - 00:02:26.684, Speaker A: And then also this first remark, I.
00:02:26.684 - 00:02:38.064, Speaker B: Think Unitz actually made at the start of the conference. But we also exclude type one, just because we always have matrix algebra, is lying around as tensorfactors. So in the two on factor case.
00:02:38.524 - 00:02:40.582, Speaker A: You have all n by matrices, and.
00:02:40.598 - 00:02:44.022, Speaker B: Then in two, infinity and three, you actually have like a full copy of.
00:02:44.038 - 00:02:47.582, Speaker A: B of H. So it's. Yeah, so you just say, okay, well.
00:02:47.598 - 00:02:52.614, Speaker B: Those are the trivial. I mean, the primality question for matrices is just number theory, right?
00:02:52.654 - 00:02:59.594, Speaker A: So we don't care. Yeah, it's like literally just whether the, the size of the matrix is prime.
00:03:00.654 - 00:03:08.074, Speaker B: And last comment is a bit more technical. So McDuff factors, so those with non communicating central sequences are not primed by.
00:03:08.484 - 00:03:13.132, Speaker A: McDuff's 1970 result because they absorb the.
00:03:13.148 - 00:03:18.100, Speaker B: Hyper finite factor tensorily. So if you have knocking central sequences.
00:03:18.212 - 00:03:27.220, Speaker A: And you're m, then m tensor r is m again. So actually, r is an example of such a thing. R, tensor r is isomorphic r. So.
00:03:27.332 - 00:03:29.344, Speaker B: Basically, we want to avoid this scenario.
00:03:30.604 - 00:03:33.984, Speaker A: Most of the time. Okay, so now you know what primeness is.
00:03:34.354 - 00:03:59.174, Speaker B: I'm going to write it on the board to indicate that I've said what prime this is. Okay, so some history. So like Cheney said, I mean, well, operator rings, so introduced in the thirties, but the first primness result, which is, I think, a fairly natural structural property.
00:03:59.694 - 00:04:01.622, Speaker A: Didn'T come until 86 when Popa proved.
00:04:01.638 - 00:04:04.754, Speaker B: That, yeah, the frequent factor on uncompetent many generators is prime.
00:04:06.174 - 00:04:07.222, Speaker A: So I mean, this is.
00:04:07.318 - 00:04:09.394, Speaker B: Yeah, a non separable to one factor.
00:04:09.814 - 00:04:13.358, Speaker A: And so then in the late nineties, good proved that.
00:04:13.526 - 00:04:21.034, Speaker B: Well, there are separable examples. At least the free group factors are prime. And again, like Cheney said, yes, they're solid.
00:04:22.854 - 00:04:23.718, Speaker C: Okay?
00:04:23.886 - 00:04:34.624, Speaker B: Coca proved that hyperbolic IC groups are solid group phenomenon algebras, and hence prime, as long as they're not amenable. But this is like a relatively easy condition to satisfy.
00:04:37.724 - 00:04:40.316, Speaker A: Jesse Peterson in zero six.
00:04:40.420 - 00:04:53.334, Speaker B: As a result, l gamma is prime. If gamma has positive first l two. Betty number. And to my understanding, I think this might be the first example of at least potentially non solid, uh, prime factors.
00:04:55.074 - 00:04:55.562, Speaker C: Okay.
00:04:55.618 - 00:05:12.738, Speaker B: But it's, you know, not, not trivial, but anyway, and then, like Chang was talking about earlier, so by exact, at least for von Neumann algebras implies solidity, but the converse is false, again, at the von Neumann algebraic level. And I guess I kind of think of all these results and there's, you know, more in between. They're very like group theoretic, right?
00:05:12.746 - 00:05:14.746, Speaker A: I mean, they're all last one is.
00:05:14.770 - 00:05:18.660, Speaker B: Not literally group theoretic, but it's inspired at least by group theory.
00:05:18.802 - 00:05:22.804, Speaker A: So it's like, okay, well, these are all examples of when l gamma is prime.
00:05:23.864 - 00:05:25.696, Speaker B: So I want to give some examples of cross products.
00:05:25.760 - 00:05:36.688, Speaker A: So b to the gamma cross gamma. So this is the Bernoulli cross product or the reef product. So Popo showed that if b is.
00:05:36.736 - 00:05:39.400, Speaker B: A tracial, amenable anomaly and non trivial.
00:05:39.432 - 00:05:40.792, Speaker A: So it can't just be c, but.
00:05:40.808 - 00:05:41.824, Speaker B: It can literally be like c direct.
00:05:41.864 - 00:05:49.888, Speaker A: Some c, then it's prime whenever gamma is non amenable. And actually, I wanted to give a.
00:05:49.896 - 00:06:06.408, Speaker B: Shout out too, to my academic older sibling, Daniel Drmbe. So he actually proved that there exist cross products that even have property gamma. So this is somehow getting pretty close to being Macduff. So Macduff, I said, has not computing central sequences.
00:06:06.576 - 00:06:12.404, Speaker A: Gamma means you have central sequences, but necessarily these central sequences are all going to commute.
00:06:12.754 - 00:06:18.818, Speaker B: But he was still able to prove primeness for pretty specific types of groups and group actions.
00:06:18.986 - 00:06:19.922, Speaker A: But still.
00:06:20.098 - 00:06:35.414, Speaker B: And he actually proved more than this. He actually proved a prime decomposition theorem related to this. And he saw in Merakshi 19, expanded upon this zero six popa result. So these Bernoulli cross products are prime.
00:06:36.794 - 00:06:38.178, Speaker A: But there's basically no assumption on the.
00:06:38.186 - 00:06:51.506, Speaker B: Base anymore as long as it's non trivial. So they prove it for the type two and type three setting. And this is actually very easy to see that a lot of these aren't solid, because if b is not amenable, then its comiton definitely contains all the.
00:06:51.530 - 00:06:55.130, Speaker A: Other copies of b, which is not going to be amenable.
00:06:55.202 - 00:06:58.974, Speaker B: So as long as b is diffuse and non amenable, then it's definitely not solid.
00:07:02.314 - 00:07:03.866, Speaker A: Okay, so I came back here because.
00:07:03.890 - 00:07:08.204, Speaker B: I want to kind of point out the outline for the next little bit of a talk.
00:07:08.704 - 00:07:11.128, Speaker A: So, one, we want to stick to.
00:07:11.136 - 00:07:12.284, Speaker B: The case of factors.
00:07:13.384 - 00:07:14.804, Speaker A: Okay, so factors.
00:07:18.344 - 00:07:22.764, Speaker B: And I also want to stick to. I want to avoid makeduff factors.
00:07:29.544 - 00:07:29.832, Speaker C: By.
00:07:29.848 - 00:07:33.162, Speaker B: Only considering things that don't have gamma. So that's a little bit stronger than.
00:07:33.258 - 00:07:35.402, Speaker A: Technically you'd need, but it's gonna make.
00:07:35.418 - 00:07:36.574, Speaker B: Our lives a little bit easier.
00:07:37.274 - 00:07:38.482, Speaker A: Well, for a couple reasons.
00:07:38.498 - 00:07:49.974, Speaker B: I mean, property gamma is much more well understood, I think, than McDuff or not Macduff. And we have some bimodule theoretic results related to gamma that are gonna really help us out.
00:07:50.754 - 00:08:01.356, Speaker A: Okay, so let's start with talking about factors. This is our warmup, okay? So to one factor we all know is an infinite dimensional tracial factor, and.
00:08:01.380 - 00:08:03.504, Speaker B: It'S separable if it's on a separate Hilbert space.
00:08:04.404 - 00:08:06.012, Speaker A: Um, if you have an action of.
00:08:06.028 - 00:08:07.676, Speaker B: A discrete group on a trace of enumerate algebra.
00:08:07.700 - 00:08:09.828, Speaker A: You can form the cross product, um.
00:08:09.916 - 00:08:15.996, Speaker B: It'S like the reduced cross product, but you take the WT closure. Um, so I'm just asserting additionally here.
00:08:16.020 - 00:08:19.476, Speaker A: That, uh, if b is tracial, that.
00:08:19.500 - 00:08:21.284, Speaker B: The action should preserve the trace.
00:08:21.364 - 00:08:25.544, Speaker A: So it's like two norm continuous is basically what I'm asserting.
00:08:26.384 - 00:08:34.304, Speaker B: Okay, well, maybe something slightly stronger, but I want everything, I want it all to play nice with the trace. And then the fact that it's trace preserving is going to give you a nice well behaved trace on the cross.
00:08:34.344 - 00:08:39.648, Speaker A: Product at the end. Okay, now if I is just a set.
00:08:39.696 - 00:08:44.384, Speaker B: So I is just going to be an index set throughout the rest of the talk. If gamma acts on your index set.
00:08:44.424 - 00:08:46.168, Speaker A: I, what you can do is you.
00:08:46.176 - 00:08:49.960, Speaker B: Can take some phenomenon algebra B, raise it to the infinite tensor product index.
00:08:49.992 - 00:08:54.068, Speaker A: By I, and you can permute the tensors according to gamma.
00:08:54.236 - 00:08:55.884, Speaker B: Now, I guess technically that only defines.
00:08:55.924 - 00:08:57.364, Speaker A: An action on the so called, I.
00:08:57.364 - 00:09:11.744, Speaker B: Guess, pure tensors, the things that are, you know, b one tensor b two tensor b three inside of the tensor product. This extends linearly because you can form a basis of tensors like this, and you can use continuity to finally everything.
00:09:13.644 - 00:09:15.236, Speaker A: And then, okay, so you take the.
00:09:15.260 - 00:09:17.944, Speaker B: Cross product of b to the I cross gamma.
00:09:18.124 - 00:09:21.244, Speaker A: This is called a generalized read product.
00:09:21.784 - 00:09:23.704, Speaker B: Uh, so it's a wreath product because.
00:09:23.824 - 00:09:27.680, Speaker A: You do the, you know, product and then act on it.
00:09:27.832 - 00:09:30.920, Speaker B: And it's generalized because the index set is not just gamma itself.
00:09:31.072 - 00:09:31.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:31.872 - 00:09:38.080, Speaker A: So I've explained the title. I succeeded. All right, so we have, so basically.
00:09:38.112 - 00:09:45.944, Speaker B: The rest of the talk or studying this algebra.
00:09:47.204 - 00:09:50.740, Speaker C: Okay. Okay.
00:09:50.772 - 00:09:53.460, Speaker A: So let's, you know, do a little.
00:09:53.492 - 00:10:01.396, Speaker B: Bit of maybe a dynamics, some exercises, and see how do we actually make sure we get a two one factor. Well, we're gonna need a couple things, right?
00:10:01.420 - 00:10:02.980, Speaker A: I mean, I said a two one.
00:10:03.012 - 00:10:04.076, Speaker B: Factor has a trace.
00:10:04.180 - 00:10:09.344, Speaker A: So in B should have a trace. I should have written really two one factor.
00:10:17.654 - 00:10:23.914, Speaker B: And I think basically, as long as anything here is infinite, then it'll be infinite dimensional. So that's not really a my, write that down.
00:10:24.734 - 00:10:27.366, Speaker A: Okay, so first you want the action.
00:10:27.390 - 00:10:38.470, Speaker B: To be properly outer on the space. So b to the I, I'm going to call this the spatial part of the cross product. And then L gamma lives inside the cross product as well. That's going to be the group like part.
00:10:38.542 - 00:10:42.238, Speaker A: So somehow they're like you're either doing.
00:10:42.366 - 00:10:46.634, Speaker B: Almost always in the crossbar, you either doing something very group like or very space like.
00:10:47.094 - 00:10:49.190, Speaker A: So, okay, so anyway, I want the.
00:10:49.222 - 00:10:57.674, Speaker B: Action to be properly outer. So really I'm asking for the group to act freely in a kind of ergodic theory sense.
00:11:02.674 - 00:11:03.066, Speaker A: Yep.
00:11:03.090 - 00:11:25.414, Speaker B: So if B is diffused, so it has no atoms, then all you need is for the action to be faithful. If B has atoms, then you have to be a little bit more careful. You actually need each non trivial group element to move infinitely many indices, which I usually call, which I call my paper free. But I think a lot of people got upset because it's not exactly what free usually means, but it's call free because that property on the index set.
00:11:25.754 - 00:11:29.224, Speaker A: Guarantees freeness on the Bernoulli action.
00:11:30.524 - 00:11:35.980, Speaker B: So I think for most of the results it's going to be, I'm just going to say b is diffused. So I don't say free and upset.
00:11:36.012 - 00:11:40.424, Speaker A: People, so I'll say be diffuse.
00:11:43.244 - 00:12:03.904, Speaker B: And, but I can also just have the action be free in this kind of weird discrete sense. Okay, what else do we need? Well, we need the actual, actually the first condition.
00:12:04.364 - 00:12:05.164, Speaker A: What does that assert?
00:12:05.204 - 00:12:14.476, Speaker B: It just asserts that the center of the cross product is going to be contained in the spatial part. That's what the freeness gives you. And so the rest is you need.
00:12:14.500 - 00:12:17.484, Speaker A: That the, you can't have a center.
00:12:17.524 - 00:12:18.772, Speaker B: In the, in the spatial part.
00:12:18.908 - 00:12:21.892, Speaker A: And for that you need the action to be ergotic, at least on the.
00:12:21.908 - 00:12:33.948, Speaker B: Center of the space. So it's sufficient to have infinite orbits. It's actually basically necessary. So I think the necessary comes in whenever the center is non trivial.
00:12:34.036 - 00:12:35.100, Speaker A: I mean, you could have b be.
00:12:35.132 - 00:12:35.908, Speaker B: A factor or something.
00:12:35.956 - 00:12:41.764, Speaker A: So it's not necessary for factoriality in that specific case.
00:12:41.804 - 00:12:46.264, Speaker B: But I want to take B to be just kind of a general object. I want to leave B alone as much as possible.
00:12:47.664 - 00:12:50.496, Speaker A: And this is pretty believable, but it's.
00:12:50.600 - 00:12:55.664, Speaker B: Really, really, really important actually to like, basically every single argument related to these.
00:12:55.744 - 00:13:02.000, Speaker A: Cross products is that infinite orbits is the same thing as like a weak.
00:13:02.032 - 00:13:03.600, Speaker B: Mixing property on the index set.
00:13:03.632 - 00:13:08.164, Speaker A: So every finite set gets moved away from itself by at least some group element.
00:13:09.224 - 00:13:09.964, Speaker C: Yes.
00:13:22.844 - 00:13:23.204, Speaker A: No.
00:13:23.244 - 00:13:32.164, Speaker B: So these like together give you a two one factor. So, yeah, so four two one. Basically all you need is b two b tracial.
00:13:32.284 - 00:13:39.858, Speaker A: And the crossbox will have a trace. And the fact that it's type two is just an infinite dimensional thing for us.
00:13:40.026 - 00:13:43.054, Speaker B: So yeah, b being tracial is all actually. So this is for.
00:13:46.034 - 00:13:55.414, Speaker A: Two, one, and then either of these two things. Plus, see, I made this too close together.
00:13:55.714 - 00:13:56.574, Speaker C: Okay.
00:14:02.754 - 00:14:11.776, Speaker A: Yeah, infinite orbits. I guess you have to pick this one. It's like a weird menu.
00:14:11.800 - 00:14:15.352, Speaker B: Okay. You have to pick this one and then one of these two and you get a factor.
00:14:15.528 - 00:14:16.824, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, thanks.
00:14:16.864 - 00:14:17.604, Speaker A: Good question.
00:14:19.944 - 00:14:22.804, Speaker C: Yes. Okay.
00:14:23.264 - 00:14:25.288, Speaker B: Yeah, so the factor reality is like the tricky part.
00:14:25.336 - 00:14:27.552, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:27.568 - 00:14:30.244, Speaker B: Just having the trace basically gives you two one for free.
00:14:30.654 - 00:14:31.214, Speaker C: Okay.
00:14:31.294 - 00:14:38.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So they're together sufficient. So by the two conditions, I mean have you appro properly outer action and ergodic action, you get factoriality.
00:14:39.214 - 00:14:42.022, Speaker A: And what's, I know I said it.
00:14:42.038 - 00:14:44.086, Speaker B: May be a kind of non standard way presented in kind of a weird.
00:14:44.110 - 00:14:45.582, Speaker A: Way here, but I wanted to make.
00:14:45.598 - 00:14:49.038, Speaker B: The point that you can basically just assert actions only on the action on.
00:14:49.046 - 00:14:52.006, Speaker A: The index set and then get guaranteed.
00:14:52.030 - 00:15:00.454, Speaker B: Properties for the cross product. So if I just assume that the, okay, I need b to be tracial and maybe diffuse. So I'm trying to limit the assumptions there as much as possible.
00:15:01.114 - 00:15:03.714, Speaker A: But if I assert that the action.
00:15:03.834 - 00:15:08.610, Speaker B: Moves around a whole bunch of indices and has infinite orbits, then you get factor reality.
00:15:08.682 - 00:15:11.082, Speaker A: So I'm really just saying like I.
00:15:11.098 - 00:15:12.946, Speaker B: Only want to look at the index.
00:15:13.090 - 00:15:15.530, Speaker A: Action and then deduce properties.
00:15:15.722 - 00:15:21.414, Speaker B: Ideally I like people to deduce like primeness from just some kind of property or set of properties for the indexed action.
00:15:23.454 - 00:15:24.702, Speaker A: So actually I want to kind of.
00:15:24.798 - 00:15:26.422, Speaker B: Remind you of this popa and a.
00:15:26.438 - 00:15:29.582, Speaker A: Sonomirachi result, which was the, instead of.
00:15:29.598 - 00:15:33.102, Speaker B: I here we had gamma Berlin action and they were able to prove primeness.
00:15:33.198 - 00:15:50.494, Speaker A: Just as a property of the group, just because it's a non amenable group. So kind of trying to imitate that setup by saying, okay, well list some fairly general properties for this index action and get hopefully primeness. But we're not at that chapter in the story yet.
00:15:51.634 - 00:15:57.610, Speaker B: I also want to say, I mean this is, you know, it's a little bit complicated, but it's definitely easier than like group weights, Easter algebra.
00:15:57.642 - 00:16:02.018, Speaker A: So you know, you know, this, this.
00:16:02.066 - 00:16:03.866, Speaker B: Was known before, let's 2021.
00:16:03.930 - 00:16:04.250, Speaker C: Okay.
00:16:04.282 - 00:16:08.054, Speaker B: So at least chronologically it's easier. That's my argument.
00:16:08.794 - 00:16:12.654, Speaker A: There's other measures of easier also, but okay.
00:16:13.854 - 00:16:19.774, Speaker B: Oh yeah, and I added some. So this is a multimedia presentation. So we have chalk slides and colors.
00:16:19.854 - 00:16:23.354, Speaker A: So that's two more than most people, I think.
00:16:24.774 - 00:16:29.846, Speaker B: Not to brag, but the first condition.
00:16:29.870 - 00:16:32.998, Speaker A: So basically when we get to the.
00:16:33.006 - 00:16:36.358, Speaker B: End of the talk, so I want you to do this word association, okay? So when we get to the end.
00:16:36.366 - 00:16:38.566, Speaker A: Of the talk and I start stating.
00:16:38.590 - 00:16:41.394, Speaker B: Results, there's going to be all these adjectives in the statements.
00:16:41.864 - 00:16:42.800, Speaker A: So I want you to remember, okay.
00:16:42.832 - 00:16:46.688, Speaker B: Diffuse and faithful, go together, and they're going to give you freeness.
00:16:46.736 - 00:16:47.804, Speaker A: That's really what it is.
00:16:48.824 - 00:16:49.392, Speaker C: Okay?
00:16:49.448 - 00:16:53.280, Speaker B: Atoms are like a lack of diffuseness. And free, again, that just means freeness.
00:16:53.432 - 00:16:54.368, Speaker A: So free means free.
00:16:54.416 - 00:17:00.440, Speaker B: That's good. Diffuse and faithful means free. And infinite orbits means ergodic, okay?
00:17:00.592 - 00:17:04.120, Speaker A: They're all the same thing. Yes.
00:17:04.152 - 00:17:09.014, Speaker B: And they're in color, so you can, like, more easily visualize them for longer. At least that's my psych theory.
00:17:11.114 - 00:17:11.934, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:13.194 - 00:17:14.014, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:14.354 - 00:17:19.154, Speaker B: All right, let's get into property gamma. So I'm gonna give a very non.
00:17:19.194 - 00:17:22.178, Speaker A: Standard definition of property gamma, because I.
00:17:22.186 - 00:17:24.146, Speaker B: Don'T want to, because it's more fun to do it this way.
00:17:24.170 - 00:17:27.134, Speaker A: I think it's the main reason. Okay.
00:17:29.154 - 00:17:36.134, Speaker B: Actually, I'm gonna write non gamma here preemptively.
00:17:38.194 - 00:17:42.334, Speaker A: Just making sure I'm not missing anything too crazy.
00:17:43.234 - 00:17:44.094, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:45.634 - 00:17:49.294, Speaker A: Okay. So, uh, so if you, if I have two.
00:17:49.994 - 00:17:51.602, Speaker B: So, for the purposes of this, I'm.
00:17:51.618 - 00:17:53.746, Speaker A: Not actually going to assume too much.
00:17:53.770 - 00:17:58.974, Speaker B: Knowledge about bime modules. You can just pretend that they're representations, okay? And they're the, they're, they're reps for.
00:17:59.444 - 00:18:01.612, Speaker A: Two one factors, okay? For our purposes.
00:18:01.748 - 00:18:09.612, Speaker B: So this precedes notation indicates weak containment. And, you know, that's the analogy of weak containment for representations.
00:18:09.708 - 00:18:13.984, Speaker A: So not, you know, it's a good, it's a good analogy. So here's.
00:18:16.324 - 00:18:22.964, Speaker B: Two sets of theorems that you can take as definitions for, for the next 40 minutes. I'm not saying they're good as definitions.
00:18:23.084 - 00:18:24.268, Speaker A: But at least they're true.
00:18:24.396 - 00:18:29.030, Speaker B: So, so m as a two one factor as property t. If and only.
00:18:29.062 - 00:18:32.710, Speaker A: If the trivial being weakly contained in.
00:18:32.742 - 00:18:37.870, Speaker B: Any bi module implies actual containment of the trivial representation. This is like saying that the trivial.
00:18:37.902 - 00:18:43.702, Speaker A: Bi module is isolated in the space of bi modules. Or in other words, if you're thinking.
00:18:43.718 - 00:18:48.390, Speaker B: About representations, l, two of m is like the trivial representation. So it's like if you have almost.
00:18:48.422 - 00:18:57.770, Speaker A: Invariant vectors, then you have invariant vectors, okay? And then there's a nice characterization of property gamma, which I think, or it.
00:18:57.802 - 00:19:01.778, Speaker B: Comes up in, or it's proved in this ban and Meraki Ozawa paper of.
00:19:01.906 - 00:19:06.426, Speaker A: 2019, m is non gamma if and.
00:19:06.450 - 00:19:08.930, Speaker B: Only if by modules that are weakly.
00:19:08.962 - 00:19:13.426, Speaker A: Equivalent to trivial contain the trivial by module. Okay?
00:19:13.450 - 00:19:27.296, Speaker B: So this is kind of, kind of strange. So I think, you know, weakly containing the trivial kind of makes sense. Like, you have almost central vectors, but this being weakly contained in trivial is kind of a weird property.
00:19:27.440 - 00:19:29.000, Speaker A: So I think that's maybe something people.
00:19:29.032 - 00:19:32.512, Speaker B: Haven'T thought about as much. So we have to justify why this.
00:19:32.528 - 00:19:36.044, Speaker A: Is like actually useful, which is the plan.
00:19:37.504 - 00:19:46.648, Speaker B: So property t is nice because, I mean, the trivial is isolated. And so this, there's kind of very little you can do with a property t sub algebra. You can kind of conjugate it around.
00:19:46.736 - 00:19:49.844, Speaker A: A little bit, but it really basically stays in place.
00:19:50.224 - 00:19:57.280, Speaker B: And Hui was just talking about even if you have ProPertY t and a diffuse center, you still have very strong rigidity results.
00:19:57.392 - 00:20:03.296, Speaker A: So property t gives you a lot. The issue for us is that these.
00:20:03.320 - 00:20:07.696, Speaker B: Generalized re products basically never Literally true.
00:20:07.720 - 00:20:10.192, Speaker A: But basically never have ProPErtY t. So.
00:20:10.208 - 00:20:15.688, Speaker B: That'S like too much to ask for. We can't really use property t to do anything in very much generality at.
00:20:15.696 - 00:20:19.364, Speaker A: All, but we can definitely use non gamma.
00:20:20.024 - 00:20:21.592, Speaker B: Well, again, I'm going to justify why.
00:20:21.608 - 00:20:28.040, Speaker A: We can use non gamma. And also moral story, gammas are knockoff.
00:20:28.072 - 00:20:48.534, Speaker B: T. It's like, mom, can we go get property t? She says, no, we have property t at home, and then it's non gamma. Okay, well, great. But it'll give us enough nourishment for the day. And both these properties are actually related, at least very slightly, to primeness because.
00:20:48.834 - 00:20:51.826, Speaker A: They are inherited by tensoran.
00:20:51.850 - 00:20:53.134, Speaker B: So if you have a tensor product.
00:20:53.554 - 00:20:56.386, Speaker A: The tensor product has t, or is.
00:20:56.410 - 00:20:59.294, Speaker B: Non gamma if only if the two tensor factors are, and vice versa.
00:21:01.334 - 00:21:02.114, Speaker C: All right.
00:21:05.134 - 00:21:07.734, Speaker A: Okay, so you know, this theme of.
00:21:07.774 - 00:21:13.022, Speaker B: I want to say kind of as little as possible about the base, the spatial part, and really just use the.
00:21:13.078 - 00:21:16.886, Speaker A: Group action to get properties, okay, that.
00:21:16.910 - 00:21:18.514, Speaker B: Are going to hopefully lead to Primus.
00:21:18.894 - 00:21:22.334, Speaker A: This is the question, and unlike a.
00:21:22.334 - 00:21:34.514, Speaker B: Lot of headlines, when you ask the question, the answer here is actually yes or basically yes. So for me, Stabf is going to be stable. It's going to be. So if you have a subset of your index set, all the group elements.
00:21:34.554 - 00:21:37.210, Speaker A: That fix every point in f actually.
00:21:37.242 - 00:21:40.374, Speaker B: Doesn'T really matter if it just fixes the set because it's the finite index inclusion.
00:21:40.914 - 00:21:42.066, Speaker A: All of these methods are not really.
00:21:42.090 - 00:21:46.962, Speaker B: Going to see fine index inclusions anyway, but just for so everyone's on the same page.
00:21:47.018 - 00:21:52.330, Speaker A: That's what statf is. And this is not the w property.
00:21:52.362 - 00:22:03.612, Speaker B: This is the VV property. So gamma acting on I has a Vv property. If whenever you take a central sequence in L gamma that is asymptotically in.
00:22:03.628 - 00:22:14.124, Speaker A: All the stabilizer subalgebras, then it's actually an asymptotically trivial sequence. So I want to point out, I.
00:22:14.124 - 00:22:32.430, Speaker B: Mean, this is obviously a very kind of operator algebraic definition, right? I mean, there's an L gamma, there's conditional expectations central sequence. This is not like a very group theorist property. It's a very opera algebraic property. However, it is still a property of just the action on the index set. There's no b anywhere. It's just gamma and I.
00:22:32.502 - 00:22:33.314, Speaker C: That's it.
00:22:33.814 - 00:22:37.394, Speaker B: So a couple of examples of actions that do have the VB property.
00:22:37.694 - 00:22:38.966, Speaker A: So actually, if you have any non.
00:22:38.990 - 00:22:42.142, Speaker B: Interminable group acting on some index set.
00:22:42.238 - 00:22:44.678, Speaker A: It'Ll have this property, just because it.
00:22:44.686 - 00:22:46.474, Speaker B: Doesn'T have any non trivial central sequences.
00:22:47.154 - 00:22:49.374, Speaker A: So it kind of trivially satisfies the property.
00:22:49.874 - 00:22:55.854, Speaker B: And the second one is, if these are not exhaustive. Okay, you can have things that have VV that are neither of these.
00:22:57.034 - 00:22:59.842, Speaker A: Or at least that's probably true if.
00:22:59.858 - 00:23:03.410, Speaker B: The stabilizer of some finite set is trivial and the action also has the VV property.
00:23:03.442 - 00:23:09.786, Speaker A: So why is that? Well, basically, you can take the intersection of finitely many of these stabilizers and.
00:23:09.810 - 00:23:12.922, Speaker B: All the conditional expectations form a commuting square. So you can take the intersection of.
00:23:12.938 - 00:23:18.696, Speaker A: The algebras and the expectation onto the scalars.
00:23:18.800 - 00:23:21.924, Speaker B: That's the span of the identity element.
00:23:22.264 - 00:23:27.804, Speaker A: That's the trace. So that's how you would get. That's how you get that.
00:23:28.144 - 00:23:32.168, Speaker B: Okay, so then the theorem. So why is this property interesting? Well, if you have a non immutable.
00:23:32.216 - 00:23:34.352, Speaker A: Action, guess I didn't define what that.
00:23:34.368 - 00:23:43.582, Speaker B: Means for these guys, but it's just the action on l infinity of I should have a left invariant mean. So it's the same definition as for.
00:23:43.598 - 00:23:52.414, Speaker A: Immutability, except you change the set that's getting act on from gamma to I anyway. But if you have a non immutable.
00:23:52.454 - 00:23:58.542, Speaker B: Action, then the VV property is equivalent to the cross product not having gamma.
00:23:58.678 - 00:23:59.886, Speaker A: And I guess I have to add a caveat.
00:23:59.910 - 00:24:01.246, Speaker B: It should be for b, non trivial.
00:24:01.310 - 00:24:04.262, Speaker A: So it can't be c. I think.
00:24:04.278 - 00:24:05.568, Speaker B: That'S the only caveat, though.
00:24:05.726 - 00:24:08.812, Speaker A: This is actually basically, you know, I.
00:24:08.828 - 00:24:11.252, Speaker B: Just add in non amenable and vv.
00:24:11.428 - 00:24:14.980, Speaker A: So I could add non amenable and non interimable. That'd be sufficient.
00:24:15.012 - 00:24:17.104, Speaker B: Also, then I get non gamma.
00:24:17.724 - 00:24:23.424, Speaker A: Okay, so I want the action to be non amenable.
00:24:25.204 - 00:24:25.944, Speaker B: And.
00:24:28.884 - 00:24:32.594, Speaker A: And I'll say, okay, this is either be non.
00:24:33.294 - 00:24:35.014, Speaker B: Okay, sorry, my brain's getting really small now.
00:24:35.054 - 00:24:35.558, Speaker C: It's not good.
00:24:35.606 - 00:24:37.114, Speaker B: Okay, non interimable.
00:24:39.854 - 00:24:52.606, Speaker A: Or a very a trivial stabilizer. I think that basically achieved the goal for this.
00:24:52.630 - 00:24:54.070, Speaker B: Okay, we got like non gamma just.
00:24:54.102 - 00:24:57.548, Speaker A: From the group action. And by we, I mean they did.
00:24:57.646 - 00:24:58.524, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:25:00.904 - 00:25:04.480, Speaker A: All right, so remember we had our.
00:25:04.512 - 00:25:18.032, Speaker B: Knockoff property, t, and so I said, okay, you have to have weekly equivalent to the trivial by module. And actually, the weakly contained in the trivial being weakly contained in h is not really the issue.
00:25:18.088 - 00:25:19.616, Speaker A: Actually, get that out of kind of.
00:25:19.640 - 00:25:22.152, Speaker B: Standard deformation rigidity type arguments.
00:25:22.288 - 00:25:25.934, Speaker A: The trick is the other side. This is the weirder bit.
00:25:26.594 - 00:25:42.374, Speaker B: So this definition, and by we, I don't mean me. I was trying to think of language to make it clear. This is not my definition. This actually property is first described in that same Bannon Muraki Ozawa paper, and then it was named this in Isono and Marachi's paper.
00:25:44.594 - 00:25:47.026, Speaker A: So again, you know, you don't really.
00:25:47.050 - 00:25:48.924, Speaker B: Need to know exactly what this is.
00:25:49.074 - 00:25:50.632, Speaker A: Um, in terms of like.
00:25:50.648 - 00:25:58.344, Speaker B: Okay, well, I don't know what the, what are the angle brackets? Um, for those who know the jargon, this is the l two space of the Jones basic instruction of the inclusion.
00:25:58.384 - 00:26:00.936, Speaker A: P and m. But the, the point.
00:26:00.960 - 00:26:04.456, Speaker B: Is that these are like, very common and commonly arising bimodules.
00:26:04.480 - 00:26:05.912, Speaker A: Okay, so this is like a, you.
00:26:05.928 - 00:26:10.104, Speaker B: Know, there's lots of P's that are weakly bicentralized. That gives you lots of bi modules.
00:26:10.224 - 00:26:26.692, Speaker A: That we could potentially use to work with non gamma. Okay, so let's, you know, gather some results about this. So the first proposition justifies the name. So, if this is hard to read, but I think it's easier.
00:26:26.748 - 00:26:30.704, Speaker B: It's hard for me to read out loud, but it's maybe easier for you to read the proposition.
00:26:31.204 - 00:26:37.692, Speaker A: If the commutant of the commutant of p and m omega is p, then.
00:26:37.748 - 00:26:40.008, Speaker B: P is weakly bicentralized. So you get these.
00:26:40.196 - 00:26:43.524, Speaker A: So if you have this weak bicentralization.
00:26:44.904 - 00:26:59.048, Speaker B: Then you actually get this bimodule property, which we can use for bimodule calculations. And so easy consequences that. Okay, if you have actual bicentralization, then it's weakly bicentralized.
00:26:59.136 - 00:27:00.512, Speaker A: So it's a reasonable name.
00:27:00.648 - 00:27:03.284, Speaker B: Actually, to my knowledge, I can be corrected if I'm wrong.
00:27:04.744 - 00:27:06.080, Speaker A: The proposition is an if and only.
00:27:06.112 - 00:27:08.750, Speaker B: If, not the in particular part, but the original part.
00:27:08.862 - 00:27:09.398, Speaker A: So.
00:27:09.526 - 00:27:09.814, Speaker C: Or.
00:27:09.854 - 00:27:11.006, Speaker B: Sorry, it's sorry.
00:27:11.070 - 00:27:12.134, Speaker A: Let me restart.
00:27:12.294 - 00:27:16.314, Speaker B: To my knowledge, the converse of the proposition is open.
00:27:16.694 - 00:27:19.686, Speaker A: So I think it's unknown whether weakly.
00:27:19.710 - 00:27:37.522, Speaker B: Bicentralized in this bimodule sense implies this relative bicomitant condition. And for those who don't work with, I don't know, relative combatants all the time, this is different than the von omen by Comuton theorem, because m is not b of H. Okay, so this.
00:27:37.538 - 00:27:40.602, Speaker A: Is actually a non trivial statement, which.
00:27:40.618 - 00:27:43.938, Speaker B: I have to remind myself all the time, because I just, I love the bicommitant theorem so much.
00:27:44.066 - 00:27:44.986, Speaker A: This is not it.
00:27:45.090 - 00:27:49.654, Speaker B: Anyway, this is my knockoff von Neumann Bicommitant theorem.
00:27:50.674 - 00:27:51.730, Speaker A: I don't knock offs the right word.
00:27:51.762 - 00:27:55.098, Speaker B: It's like more interesting, or maybe equally as interesting.
00:27:55.266 - 00:27:57.258, Speaker C: Anyway, so proposition.
00:27:57.306 - 00:28:03.830, Speaker B: So this property is transitive. So if a is weakly by centralized in b and b and c, then.
00:28:03.862 - 00:28:07.074, Speaker A: A and c, it's reserved under tensor products.
00:28:07.774 - 00:28:09.794, Speaker B: Basically, it plays nicely. Tensor products.
00:28:12.214 - 00:28:18.606, Speaker A: At 0.3 is 95% true. So the center is weakly centralized in.
00:28:18.630 - 00:28:24.078, Speaker B: M. But I think there's an exception if you have a non separable type three phenomenon, algebra.
00:28:24.206 - 00:28:27.614, Speaker A: But we're in the type 21 setting, so it's fine, inseparable.
00:28:28.114 - 00:28:29.738, Speaker B: And the last one, I don't know.
00:28:29.746 - 00:28:32.666, Speaker A: If it's actually explicitly stated in the.
00:28:32.690 - 00:28:41.170, Speaker B: Paper, but it follows from one of the propositions. If you have a free action, in my sense, okay, so it's not free free, but it's free like it moves.
00:28:41.242 - 00:28:44.614, Speaker A: Around lots of indices and has infinite orbits.
00:28:45.594 - 00:28:48.714, Speaker B: Then the space, the whole spatial part.
00:28:48.834 - 00:28:51.814, Speaker A: Is weakly bicentralized in the entire cross product.
00:28:52.414 - 00:28:53.302, Speaker C: Okay?
00:28:53.478 - 00:28:57.726, Speaker A: And actually the reason this works is.
00:28:57.750 - 00:29:02.754, Speaker B: Because b to the I has a lot of central sequences.
00:29:03.374 - 00:29:04.594, Speaker A: Basically, you can take.
00:29:06.854 - 00:29:22.254, Speaker B: Tensors that have support further and further along the tensor product, and they'll asymptotically commute with B. And so you get lots of elements in the ultra power that commute with b to the I. And you get enough that when you take the combaton again, you get back to the space.
00:29:22.874 - 00:29:24.642, Speaker A: Okay, so this is great.
00:29:24.658 - 00:29:31.494, Speaker B: So we have at least, you know, a couple examples. This isn't really robust enough to actually use non gamma for our purposes.
00:29:31.914 - 00:29:38.322, Speaker A: So here's a theorem. So basically what this is, is this.
00:29:38.338 - 00:29:45.606, Speaker B: Is a saying that for every finite set subset of the index set, there's a corresponding. Actually, it's a few corresponding.
00:29:45.630 - 00:29:47.702, Speaker A: But in particular, this one is a.
00:29:47.718 - 00:29:51.190, Speaker B: Corresponding subalgebra that's weakly bicentralized in the cross product.
00:29:51.342 - 00:29:53.238, Speaker A: This is basically, and these, you have.
00:29:53.246 - 00:29:58.262, Speaker B: To trust me on this one a little bit. These are actually naturally arising subalgebras.
00:29:58.398 - 00:30:05.542, Speaker A: It's, you know, taken on faith, but they actually are. So there's a couple of caveats.
00:30:05.598 - 00:30:10.734, Speaker B: So, okay, so I said faithfully, faithful and diffuse. Remember, faithful and diffuse.
00:30:11.994 - 00:30:14.722, Speaker A: We use that for freeness. So freeness is important here.
00:30:14.738 - 00:30:19.738, Speaker B: Like we need a properly outer action. But actually the diffuseness of b is.
00:30:19.826 - 00:30:22.746, Speaker A: Needed not just for properly outer.
00:30:22.770 - 00:30:30.974, Speaker B: It's actually also needed in some relative commutant calculations. So there's some technical issues if b is finite dimensional in particular.
00:30:32.394 - 00:30:35.546, Speaker A: So what's really upsetting basically, is that.
00:30:35.570 - 00:30:39.974, Speaker B: You try to compute this double commutant without, because that seems easier.
00:30:40.134 - 00:30:41.514, Speaker A: But then you realize that.
00:30:43.294 - 00:30:43.886, Speaker C: If the.
00:30:43.910 - 00:30:46.494, Speaker B: Stabilizer subgroup has property t, then actually.
00:30:46.534 - 00:30:51.038, Speaker A: Adding the ultra power doesn't even help you. So that's, again, that's a bit of.
00:30:51.046 - 00:30:53.006, Speaker B: A, that's one of the weird property t things.
00:30:53.030 - 00:30:56.126, Speaker A: So actually, potentially having property actually hurt.
00:30:56.150 - 00:30:57.062, Speaker B: Us in this case, which is kind.
00:30:57.078 - 00:31:00.462, Speaker A: Of upsetting, because so often you think.
00:31:00.478 - 00:31:03.194, Speaker B: Property is going to help you out, but not today.
00:31:04.074 - 00:31:04.894, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:05.754 - 00:31:08.626, Speaker A: All right, so let's do a little.
00:31:08.650 - 00:31:09.642, Speaker B: Summary, what we have so far.
00:31:09.698 - 00:31:14.294, Speaker A: So we want to find prime generalized read products.
00:31:14.994 - 00:31:18.394, Speaker B: We can characterize being a two one factor, not quite characterized, but have like.
00:31:18.434 - 00:31:22.706, Speaker A: Pretty robust sufficient conditions, just, and then.
00:31:22.770 - 00:31:30.304, Speaker B: Also we have a non gamma two one factor if we have some pretty general conditions, I think, on the, on the index action.
00:31:32.044 - 00:31:33.944, Speaker C: Okay, so.
00:31:36.684 - 00:31:38.424, Speaker B: The question is, is this enough?
00:31:41.364 - 00:31:46.628, Speaker A: Well, one of the things I learned at Waterloo is that if you have.
00:31:46.676 - 00:31:57.144, Speaker B: One example and it works, then it's probably true. Okay, so let's, you know, Bayesian update our odds. So first example, this, this works, okay, so this satisf, this cross product satisfies all the conditions.
00:31:57.574 - 00:31:59.142, Speaker A: So gamma is not amenable.
00:31:59.318 - 00:32:00.794, Speaker B: So the action is not amenable.
00:32:01.654 - 00:32:13.422, Speaker A: Let's see, the stabilizer of every point is trivial, and so we have non gamma. It's assuming, okay, you have to add.
00:32:13.438 - 00:32:16.774, Speaker B: Okay, add in b is tracial, b is tracial, and it's a two one.
00:32:16.814 - 00:32:21.662, Speaker A: Then it's two one as infinite orbits, because gamma is an infinite group and.
00:32:21.718 - 00:32:22.974, Speaker B: It'S going to be free because every.
00:32:23.014 - 00:32:27.706, Speaker A: Single non identity point moves around every single other point. Okay, so that's good.
00:32:27.770 - 00:32:31.146, Speaker B: All right, so it's probably true. But then the second part of my.
00:32:31.170 - 00:32:38.138, Speaker A: Teaching was, if two examples are true, then it's like definitely true. But unfortunately, the second example is false.
00:32:38.266 - 00:32:43.934, Speaker B: Okay, so it's actually not true. So, okay, what do I mean by this?
00:32:44.754 - 00:32:48.410, Speaker A: So this example, the one that doesn't.
00:32:48.442 - 00:32:51.086, Speaker B: Work is the coproduct action. Okay?
00:32:51.110 - 00:32:54.286, Speaker A: So this is, it's like a way.
00:32:54.310 - 00:32:56.486, Speaker B: To join together, you know, two Bernoulli actions.
00:32:56.510 - 00:33:04.542, Speaker A: All right, so we have basically, okay, what am I, what am I trying to say? You have two orbits, one that looks.
00:33:04.558 - 00:33:10.846, Speaker B: Like gamma one and looks like gamma two gamma. If you have a g one g two from gamma one times gamma two.
00:33:11.030 - 00:33:12.382, Speaker A: G one acts on things in the.
00:33:12.398 - 00:33:18.434, Speaker B: Gamma one orbit, but it does nothing to the gamma two orbit. And vice versa. The g two acts on the gamma one orbit, but does nothing to the.
00:33:18.514 - 00:33:23.786, Speaker A: Or, sorry, does the opposite. Um, yeah, and then that's, it decomposes.
00:33:23.810 - 00:33:24.786, Speaker B: Into a tensor product, right?
00:33:24.810 - 00:33:28.442, Speaker A: So it's, it's not prime. Um, and, you know, if b is.
00:33:28.458 - 00:33:33.974, Speaker B: Tracial and these are Bernoulli actions of non amenable groups, then it has all these things.
00:33:34.554 - 00:33:41.014, Speaker A: Um, so, like, actually, in this case, it's a, this is like the tensor.
00:33:41.594 - 00:33:44.098, Speaker B: Decomposition, the prime decomposition, because each of.
00:33:44.106 - 00:33:44.974, Speaker A: Those is prime.
00:33:46.914 - 00:33:55.090, Speaker B: Or should say it's a prime decomposition. I didn't prove that's the only way, but. Okay, so what's the, what's the problem here?
00:33:55.202 - 00:33:55.854, Speaker A: So.
00:33:58.554 - 00:34:01.026, Speaker B: Basically, the issue is the stabilizers.
00:34:01.050 - 00:34:03.986, Speaker A: Okay? So the nice thing about the genuine.
00:34:04.010 - 00:34:10.784, Speaker B: Bernoulli action is that there's no stabilizers. All the stabilizers are trivial. So, like, you get this very, very strong type of mixing property.
00:34:12.844 - 00:34:16.796, Speaker A: So, but in this cobra act example.
00:34:16.820 - 00:34:20.908, Speaker B: The stabilizer is very large, right? The stabilizer of the whole gamma one orbit is all of gamma two.
00:34:20.956 - 00:34:27.172, Speaker A: It's like a massive subgroup, relatively speaking. Okay, so I guess my interpretation of.
00:34:27.188 - 00:34:29.236, Speaker B: This is that it doesn't mix stuff around enough.
00:34:29.300 - 00:34:29.916, Speaker C: Okay?
00:34:30.060 - 00:34:38.396, Speaker B: You have a tensor product, you know, you think of like a von Neumann algebra acting on itself by conjugation, by unitaries. One tensor factor can't mix the other.
00:34:38.420 - 00:34:40.364, Speaker A: Because if you conjugate by unitaries, by.
00:34:40.404 - 00:34:42.404, Speaker B: Commutation of the tensor factors, you do nothing.
00:34:42.484 - 00:34:43.984, Speaker A: It's not mixing it at all.
00:34:44.724 - 00:34:45.828, Speaker B: That's what's happening here.
00:34:45.916 - 00:34:47.824, Speaker A: The two pieces don't mix each other.
00:34:48.804 - 00:34:49.172, Speaker C: Okay?
00:34:49.188 - 00:34:52.384, Speaker B: So let's, again do some classical mixing.
00:34:52.804 - 00:34:53.132, Speaker C: All right?
00:34:53.148 - 00:34:55.268, Speaker B: So if x is a non trivial.
00:34:55.396 - 00:35:01.634, Speaker A: Probability space, then gamma, acting on the, let's say, what?
00:35:01.724 - 00:35:08.502, Speaker B: Infinite cohesion product indexed by I. So this is the generalized Bernoulli action. It's mixing, in the ergodic theory sense.
00:35:08.678 - 00:35:09.230, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:35:09.262 - 00:35:11.150, Speaker B: When the action on the index has.
00:35:11.182 - 00:35:15.190, Speaker A: Finite stabilizers, this is probably too strong, right?
00:35:15.222 - 00:35:25.390, Speaker B: Because, I mean, the Bernoulli action has trivial stabilizers. So if you have a mixing action, it means that on each orbit, you're virtually a Bernoulli action.
00:35:25.462 - 00:35:25.710, Speaker A: Okay?
00:35:25.742 - 00:35:31.656, Speaker B: So actually, the primeness is just going to follow, um, essentially from the Sono.
00:35:31.680 - 00:35:37.696, Speaker A: Mercki result, modulo some details, but, um, okay, what's the next kind of mixing.
00:35:37.720 - 00:35:40.324, Speaker B: You come across when you're reading probably weak mixing?
00:35:41.104 - 00:35:43.392, Speaker A: Uh, well, the issue is that all.
00:35:43.408 - 00:35:46.404, Speaker B: You need for this action to be weak mixing is infinite orbits.
00:35:46.704 - 00:35:51.480, Speaker A: Uh, which is not helpful, because that.
00:35:51.512 - 00:35:53.280, Speaker B: Co product action is weak mixing.
00:35:53.352 - 00:36:03.834, Speaker A: Okay, there's two orbits and they're both infinite. So how can we fix this? So we have to know, okay, we have to fix this.
00:36:04.454 - 00:36:08.034, Speaker B: So here's two suggestions to how to fix this.
00:36:08.414 - 00:36:10.062, Speaker A: So, one, we could just assert that.
00:36:10.078 - 00:36:31.938, Speaker B: All the stabilizers are amenable. This would give us some sort of, like, co ammunability stuff. It gives us lots of bi modules that weakly contain other stuff, and then we can use maybe non gamma to deduce actual containment. But, you know, it's like an amenable. It's like amenable mixing. So it's definitely weaker than having finite stabilizers, but it's also definitely stronger than.
00:36:31.986 - 00:36:34.154, Speaker A: Weak mixing and a second property.
00:36:34.194 - 00:36:37.294, Speaker B: So I think it's actually fairly natural, especially, you know, we love amenability.
00:36:38.234 - 00:36:40.514, Speaker A: The second one is a little bit.
00:36:40.554 - 00:36:41.754, Speaker B: Strange, I think, in my opinion.
00:36:41.794 - 00:36:49.552, Speaker A: So I'm just saying there's some finite subset whose stabilizer is amenable. And I want you to keep in.
00:36:49.568 - 00:36:52.960, Speaker B: Mind that these actions are not transitive or anything, right? So, I mean, this could be just.
00:36:52.992 - 00:37:06.488, Speaker A: Like a giant 1 billion elements set sitting in only one orbit. So this is like kind of a funky condition. But I have a justification for why we would care, and I apologize, because.
00:37:06.536 - 00:37:09.752, Speaker B: Some of the notation I haven't introduced yet. So this is slightly out of order.
00:37:09.928 - 00:37:12.280, Speaker A: But the justification is basically this.
00:37:12.312 - 00:37:15.492, Speaker B: So if one of your tensor factors intertwines.
00:37:15.588 - 00:37:17.820, Speaker A: I'm about to expand on that a little bit.
00:37:17.932 - 00:37:24.196, Speaker B: But if it intertwines into b to the f cross stab f, then it actually intertwines into all of the l.
00:37:24.220 - 00:37:29.996, Speaker A: Stab g's for all, as long as g is finite. Okay, so, you know, so then the.
00:37:30.020 - 00:37:34.668, Speaker B: Second condition, I can say that, oh, one of the stab g's is amenable. So then p intertwines into something amenable.
00:37:34.836 - 00:37:35.624, Speaker C: All right.
00:37:37.484 - 00:37:44.664, Speaker A: Okay, so let me kind of do a bit of a spiel about deformation.
00:37:44.704 - 00:37:46.824, Speaker B: Rigidity, because I want to sell my.
00:37:46.944 - 00:37:48.928, Speaker A: Research area so myself and my peers.
00:37:48.976 - 00:38:03.160, Speaker B: Can get more jobs and all that. All right, so here's the theorem slash definition. So, following our equivalent. So, one, there's not a net in the separable cases, it can be a sequence. So a sequence of unitaries in a.
00:38:03.312 - 00:38:05.072, Speaker A: That even when you multiply on the.
00:38:05.088 - 00:38:06.844, Speaker B: Left and right by something in M.
00:38:07.214 - 00:38:11.430, Speaker A: Um, yeah, so, yeah, you can multiply.
00:38:11.462 - 00:38:13.326, Speaker B: Anything on the left and right, and then you have to expect on to.
00:38:13.350 - 00:38:16.594, Speaker A: B that basically can't go to zero.
00:38:17.374 - 00:38:21.222, Speaker B: And the second one is, there's actually a homomorphism between two corners of a.
00:38:21.238 - 00:38:23.662, Speaker A: And b that is intertwined by a.
00:38:23.678 - 00:38:27.154, Speaker B: Partial isometry that has nice, uh, lives in nice relative commutants.
00:38:27.494 - 00:38:33.698, Speaker A: So this, uh, okay, this, you know, looks pretty, is pretty technical, but why.
00:38:33.706 - 00:38:34.330, Speaker B: Is it so powerful?
00:38:34.362 - 00:38:36.658, Speaker A: Well, a lot of the arguments go.
00:38:36.706 - 00:38:52.818, Speaker B: Okay, well, assume that a doesn't intertwine to b, and you get unitaries with this nice property. And by nice, I mean you can actually get your hands on it and start computing. You start writing down like, oh, the expectation of this onto this is something. And you can do some estimates, probably some coci Schwartz at some point, and.
00:38:52.826 - 00:38:58.002, Speaker A: You get a contradiction. And then you get a contradiction and you can say, well, there must have.
00:38:58.018 - 00:39:03.286, Speaker B: Actually been a homomorphism intertwined by partial isometry. So you get kind of this local thing.
00:39:03.310 - 00:39:05.358, Speaker A: You compute with the unitaries and you.
00:39:05.366 - 00:39:10.142, Speaker B: Get this somewhat more global property of how algebras live inside each other, inside.
00:39:10.238 - 00:39:12.354, Speaker A: The larger ambient algebra.
00:39:13.094 - 00:39:35.174, Speaker B: Okay, so a couple like fun facts, at least if you have factors, unitary conjugation taking corners preserves this intertwining relation. Um, intertwining is not quite, it's like almost transitive, but not quite. You have to add a couple extra conditions or a couple extra details. But it is almost.
00:39:37.114 - 00:39:38.122, Speaker A: For us, what's.
00:39:38.138 - 00:39:41.042, Speaker B: Kind of particularly nice is that if you have two tensor factors that are.
00:39:41.058 - 00:39:46.258, Speaker A: Diffuse, neither can intertwine into the other because they're kind of like permanently separated.
00:39:46.386 - 00:39:56.448, Speaker B: Uh, in this view, actually same thing for a cross product. As long as they're both diffuse, the spatial part can intertwine to the group part, and the group part can't intertwine into the spatial part.
00:39:56.496 - 00:40:00.200, Speaker A: So they are kind of separated in a very fundamental way.
00:40:00.392 - 00:40:10.000, Speaker B: So, I mean, if you had some calculation that contradicted that, then you're going to get some very strong statement about your algebra. And also something that's also just generally.
00:40:10.032 - 00:40:12.456, Speaker A: Helpful, not just for primeness, but this.
00:40:12.480 - 00:40:18.844, Speaker B: Intertwining stuff works really well with both relative commutants and normalizers, and also quasi normalizers.
00:40:20.464 - 00:40:22.096, Speaker A: All right, so I've explained the notation.
00:40:22.160 - 00:40:28.144, Speaker B: So I'm saying that, okay, p, if it basically intertwines into something with finely.
00:40:28.184 - 00:40:31.848, Speaker A: Supported spatial part, then it also can intertwine.
00:40:31.936 - 00:40:37.524, Speaker B: So it can be kind of conjugated by partial isometry into any stabilizer you want.
00:40:40.864 - 00:40:43.688, Speaker A: So this is kind of like, you.
00:40:43.696 - 00:40:54.766, Speaker B: Know, p living inside of b to the f across status, kind of like, okay, if p already has a million dollars, then actually it has a billion dollars. I mean, it's, it is the strongest statement, but it's maybe somehow getting to.
00:40:54.790 - 00:40:57.054, Speaker A: The million dollars is really the I.
00:40:57.054 - 00:40:59.886, Speaker B: Don'T know, that's, that's the tricky part, in my opinion.
00:40:59.950 - 00:41:02.502, Speaker A: Actually, they're both tricky, but they're of.
00:41:02.518 - 00:41:03.914, Speaker B: A different nature, let's say.
00:41:05.494 - 00:41:07.654, Speaker A: Okay, and the last couple of slides.
00:41:07.694 - 00:41:09.834, Speaker B: Are just basically just going to list results.
00:41:12.334 - 00:41:12.766, Speaker C: Okay?
00:41:12.790 - 00:41:25.854, Speaker B: So the top one is a technical result. So, you know, if you don't like intertwining, I did a bad cell job. You can just look at the bottom one, but the top one is kind of the meat. Okay, this is like how the proof actually goes.
00:41:26.514 - 00:41:28.746, Speaker A: So if you have a faithful, non.
00:41:28.770 - 00:41:41.970, Speaker B: Immutable action with the VV property of a countable group on accountable set, diffuse tracial enumerate algebra. So we kind of just go through one of these adjectives to make sure we have a non gamma to one factor. And non immutable actually implies infinite orbits.
00:41:42.002 - 00:41:54.502, Speaker A: Okay, so I actually saved one word, not very impressive, but that's okay. Okay, so we have the generalized Reeth product, right, as a tensor decomposition.
00:41:54.678 - 00:42:01.742, Speaker B: Then I can say something about one of the tensor factors. So either it lives in all these SabF's by the end that goes from.
00:42:01.798 - 00:42:12.512, Speaker A: Finite spatial part to any stabilizer, or the other tensor factor lives inside one of these algebras. And if you remember, these algebras were.
00:42:12.528 - 00:42:15.592, Speaker B: The ones that non gamma sees really easily.
00:42:15.768 - 00:42:19.204, Speaker A: These were the weakly bicentralized ones. Okay?
00:42:19.704 - 00:42:26.992, Speaker B: And so I'm doing some bimodule calculations and looking at some relative commutants. One crawler you can extract out of.
00:42:27.008 - 00:42:29.440, Speaker A: This is that you have an action.
00:42:29.552 - 00:42:32.936, Speaker B: That'S faithful with infinite orbits acting on.
00:42:33.120 - 00:42:36.524, Speaker A: A two one factor, or I guess a tensor product of a two one factor.
00:42:38.654 - 00:42:42.514, Speaker B: And, you know, have enough conditions to say that the, that m is actually non gamma.
00:42:43.054 - 00:42:45.678, Speaker A: Uh, and one of the stabilizers is amenable.
00:42:45.806 - 00:42:47.118, Speaker B: Then you get primeness.
00:42:47.246 - 00:42:57.382, Speaker A: So just having one amenable stabilizer gives you just enough mixing to get primeness. Um, yeah, so I know it's kind.
00:42:57.398 - 00:43:02.086, Speaker B: Of weird, maybe I wrote, okay, I wrote non gamma and then still have to write faithful and infinite orbits.
00:43:02.270 - 00:43:06.466, Speaker A: Um, I, you know, the non gamma.
00:43:06.490 - 00:43:15.306, Speaker B: Part allows me to do all the nice bi module calculations. The faithful and infinite orbits allows me to do some other arguments later on. So I do need like the ergodicity.
00:43:15.370 - 00:43:17.962, Speaker A: And freeness in other places in the.
00:43:17.978 - 00:43:19.290, Speaker B: Argument actually to do some of these.
00:43:19.322 - 00:43:30.046, Speaker A: Like bootstrapping or weak by centralization type arguments. And then something that, you know, I.
00:43:30.070 - 00:43:32.806, Speaker B: Said, I went from b diffuse to b a two one factor.
00:43:32.990 - 00:43:35.494, Speaker A: Um, yeah, there's a relative commutant calculation.
00:43:35.534 - 00:43:39.838, Speaker B: At the end where you need a factor. So this is like, like I said at the start, right? You need factors to do a lot.
00:43:39.846 - 00:43:48.470, Speaker A: Of these commutant calculations. All right, now, something else about this bottom result is that it doesn't actually.
00:43:48.622 - 00:43:54.286, Speaker B: Directly generalize Isono Meraki's result, even in the tracial case. Because I'm saying B has to be a two one factor.
00:43:54.310 - 00:43:54.502, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:54.518 - 00:43:56.714, Speaker B: Like I'd like to say b is just non trivial.
00:43:57.704 - 00:44:01.072, Speaker A: But using similar techniques, I was able.
00:44:01.088 - 00:44:06.404, Speaker B: To extract agentralization using this amenably mixing. So if all the stabilizers are amenable.
00:44:07.584 - 00:44:18.560, Speaker A: Then you just need, and you add in the right soup of adjectives, then you just need a non trivial base. So like I said, this is an.
00:44:18.592 - 00:44:21.244, Speaker B: Actual generalization of the popo Isoamiraki results.
00:44:23.214 - 00:44:24.302, Speaker A: And then I put in kind of.
00:44:24.318 - 00:44:26.558, Speaker B: A group, a group like example.
00:44:26.726 - 00:44:31.238, Speaker A: So if you have a non amenable group and an amenable subgroup where the.
00:44:31.246 - 00:44:32.470, Speaker B: Amenable subgroup is malnormal.
00:44:32.502 - 00:44:34.434, Speaker A: So that's what malnormal means.
00:44:35.414 - 00:44:47.142, Speaker B: Intersection of finally many conjugates is trivial, then the, so the corresponding action is the natural action. That's transitive, right? It's just gamma acting on the quotient.
00:44:47.318 - 00:44:49.934, Speaker A: Sets or the cosets.
00:44:50.514 - 00:44:52.254, Speaker B: This thing will be prime.
00:44:53.394 - 00:44:54.874, Speaker C: Okay. All right.
00:44:54.914 - 00:44:56.254, Speaker A: And that's it.
00:44:56.554 - 00:44:56.994, Speaker C: Thank you.
