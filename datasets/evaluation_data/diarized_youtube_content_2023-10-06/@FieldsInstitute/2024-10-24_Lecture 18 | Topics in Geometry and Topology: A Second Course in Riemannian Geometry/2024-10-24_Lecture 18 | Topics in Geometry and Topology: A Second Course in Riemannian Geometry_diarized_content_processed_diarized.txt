00:00:01.000 - 00:00:31.547, Speaker A: Okay, so let's get started again. It's going to be, unfortunately there's going to be a lot of lectures from now on where I'm going to be in the middle of a proof and we have to stop because some of these arguments are quite long. We were in the middle of proving the index lemma. So I will remind you what the statement of the index lemma is. This is going to be a tool we're going to use to prove the route comparison theorem, which will start today, which will certainly not finish today. And we're also going to, I think, use it in chapters 11 and 12 as well. So I'm going to remind you what the statement is.
00:00:31.547 - 00:01:18.071, Speaker A: I'm going to tell you how far we got last time and we'll start from there. So the statement is as follows. We take a geodesic on M and we suppose that there are no conjugate points to the initial point along gamma. So gamma of T is not conjugate to gamma 0 for all T bigger than 0, less than or equal to A. Remember, that means that there's no Jacobi fields, non trivial Jacobi fields that vanish at 0n t for some t positive. Now let's suppose we have a Jacobi field that's normal everywhere to Gamma prime, which is a normal Jacobi field, and we take a piecewise smooth vector field along gamma that's also normal to Gamma prime. And we suppose that they're both zero at the initial point and that there's some positive time T not where they're equal.
00:01:18.071 - 00:02:24.959, Speaker A: Okay, they certainly this can't be zero because if j of t0 was zero, then j would be, would be, would be zero. Well, I mean it could be zero, but we want a non trivial Jacobi field, otherwise there's nothing really to this statement. And the conclusion is that the index form up to T naught of JJ is less than or equal to the index form up to T0 of VV with equality if and only if V is equal to j on zero to T naught. Right? We don't know what happens after T0. And recall, I'll remind you what the index form was. Recall, I t of vv is the integral from 0 to t v prime v prime minus r of v gamma prime gamma prime V. Okay, so if you integrate by parts here, you can make this a V inner product V double prime with a minus sign.
00:02:24.959 - 00:03:12.405, Speaker A: And that's the Jacobi equation. This is where this expression came as the integral part of the second variation formula. Integral part of the Second variation formula. Okay, so we started the proof last time. I'll remind you how far we got. We let script J be the space of normal Jacobi fields along gamma such that they vanish at the initial time. We know this is an n minus one dimensional vector space.
00:03:12.405 - 00:04:26.245, Speaker A: N is the dimension of the manifold. And let's let J1 up to JN minus 1 be a basis. So we did some. We know we can write j as the sum From K equals 1 up to N minus 1 Alpha K J K on 0a, where Alpha 1 up to Alpha N minus 1 are constants. That's because J is in that space. So it's a linear combination of the basis basis vectors. And we showed last time with some hard work that there exists Piecewise smooth functions F1 up to F n -1 from 0a to the reals such that V is the sum From k equals 1 up to n minus 1 fk jk on 0a.
00:04:26.245 - 00:05:07.051, Speaker A: So the way we did this, I'll just remind you, there was two parts to it. First of all, there was a property of Jacobi fields that we proved at the end of chapter five that used the fact that this gamma of T is not conjugate to gamma of 0 for any positive t, which told us that the j k at t were a basis for the tangent space to m at gamma of t for all positive t. So we could certainly do this away from zero. And then we worked hard to show that in fact these functions extend smoothly to zero. Okay, So I mean, we know that V at zero is zero. So these coefficients, you know, these are not independent. These also vanish at zero.
00:05:07.051 - 00:05:40.093, Speaker A: But these functions, which are uniquely defined on positive zero greater than zero up to A, in fact extend smoothly to zero. So that's where we were last time. That was all last time. Yeah, just recapping. Okay, so now we're going to continue the proof we want to show. Well, let's. Here's the claim.
00:05:40.093 - 00:06:11.955, Speaker A: This was claim number one. Okay. This was claim number one. We did this. Claim number two is where we're going to start today. On the interior of each sub interval of 0a on which each FK is piecewise smooth. Each fk is smooth.
00:06:11.955 - 00:07:09.835, Speaker A: We have the following. I'm going to write it over here. V prime V prime minus R of v gamma prime, gamma prime V. That's the. That's the integrand of the index form. Integrand of the index form. It's equal to sum over I fi prime ji sum over j FJ prime JJ plus D by dt of sum over I, Fiji sum over J FJ JJ prime.
00:07:09.835 - 00:07:47.593, Speaker A: Ok, so in this term where there's no derivative that we have primes on the Fs and not on the Js. Here there's a derivative. This is completely unprimed. And here we have a prime only on the J. So we're going to prove this just by calculating both sides and then it'll follow pretty quickly from this plane how the, how the lemma follows. Okay, so I don't want to keep writing the sums. Now all repeated indices are summed from 1 to K to N minus 1.
00:07:47.593 - 00:08:43.825, Speaker A: So we can stop writing all those summation symbols. What do we have? First of all we have R of V gamma prime, gamma prime. Well that's equal to R of fk JK gamma prime gamma prime and that's equal to the F's come out R of jk gamma prime gamma prime. And then using the Jacobi equation, because, because JK is a Jacobi field, this whole thing is minus JK double prime. Okay, each of the jks is a Jacobi field and let's write V as Fiji. So if I covariately differentiate this with the product rule, I'll fi prime ji plus Fiji prime. And I want to take, I want to calculate the left hand side of this expression.
00:08:43.825 - 00:10:06.423, Speaker A: So if I compute the inner product of V prime with V prime, so I'm going to take this expression, write it again with another dummy index J and take the inner product and use the bilinearity. This is going to be, this is going to be fi prime FJ prime jijj that's when I take the two terms with the F prime and then the cross terms are going to be the same. Fi prime FJI JJ prime plus FJ ji prime JJ prime. So really, you know what I did is I wrote out the two mixed terms, the outside and the inside Inside, sorry, the two outside and the two inside. And I swapped the I and the J in one of them in one of the terms because they're dummy index. So here only the Fs are differentiated. Here only the Js.
00:10:06.423 - 00:10:59.845, Speaker A: Here one F and one J is differentiated. I mean just, you know, it was, it was fi prime ji with FJ JJ prime plus Fiji prime with fj prime jj. So this is what I wrote, this one. But in here you can just swap the roles of I and J and it's the same thing. So, so that's these three terms is this one. And I want to take minus R of V gamma prime gamma prime inner product V and I calculated over there that the expression with the curvature is just minus F I J I double prime. So then I'm going to have a minus sign again.
00:10:59.845 - 00:12:11.467, Speaker A: So I'm going to get a Fiji double prime inner product with V which is an FJ jj. Okay, so this is the left hand side of claim two that we want to prove. What we're going to do now is calculate this time derivative here and move it to the left and see that we get the claim. So we also have, if I compute D by dt of Fiji FJ JJ prime again I'm going to, I have the metric compatibility. So it's going to be D by dt of this inner product this + this times D by dt of that. And then I'll have a product rule on each of those. So when I differentiate the fi there I'm going to have this and then I'm going to differentiate the J, the J ji prime j J prime and that's I've differentiated both of those guys.
00:12:11.467 - 00:12:59.535, Speaker A: Now I have to differentiate this one Fi FJ prime ji j prime and now I differentiate the J. So FJ ji j double prime. And I hope I didn't make any mistakes. So now let's pair things up. So the one that has two derivatives of J's and no derivatives of F's is going to cancel with that one. The one that has the second derivative is also going to cancel when I take the difference and this guy is going to partially cancel again. I can change.
00:12:59.535 - 00:14:23.951, Speaker A: No, this is this one, right? So it doesn't quite cancel because I have two of them here and only one here. So when I take the difference, I'm going to be left with this guy, one of these and minus that. Right? So V prime, V prime minus R of V gamma prime, gamma prime V minus D by dt of Fiji FJ JJ prime is equal to. We said this guy is still there. Fi prime, FJ prime ji jj and then only one of the yellow ones cancels Fi prime FJ ji j J prime and then I have minus this guy. Okay, so now comparing what we want to prove, I moved, I moved this D by dt over to the left. And what do we have here? We have the two F primes with the two Js unprimed.
00:14:23.951 - 00:15:40.187, Speaker A: This is what we have here. Right? So we'll be done if we can show that the last two terms cancel. So claim two is proved if we show the last two terms canceled. Okay, let's see why that is. So let's look at the following function. Define we're always on this sub interval where the f all the Fs are smooth, right? Define H of T to be Ji Prime JJ minus Ji JJ Prime. So I and J is fixed H at time zero.
00:15:40.187 - 00:15:59.179, Speaker A: I just realized. Oh yeah, the Js are Jacobi Fields. So they're defined on the whole. The whole 0 to A, right? This is. This is on 0 A. The Jacobi fields are smooth. H times 0 is 0 because each of these J's vanishes at time 0.
00:15:59.179 - 00:16:48.725, Speaker A: That's how they were chosen. They were basis for the normal Jacobi fields that vanish at time zero. And what is H prime? Again I use the product rule JI double prime JJ plus JI prime JJ prime minus JI prime JJ prime minus ji JJ double prime. These cancel right away the same thing. And then using the Jacobi equation, because these are Jacobi fields, we're going to get a minus R of JI gamma prime gamma prime JJ plus ji. I'll put it on the other way. The inner product is symmetric R of JJ gamma prime, gamma prime ji.
00:16:48.725 - 00:17:09.525, Speaker A: And these cancel because of the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor. The Riemann curvature tensor. Right. So I can swap. This is as a 04 tensor. This is R of Ji Gamma Prime Gamma Prime JJ. And this is the same thing with the I and the J swapped, but these guys are the same.
00:17:09.525 - 00:17:36.105, Speaker A: So by the symmetries of the realign curvature tensor, this gives us zero. I want to keep. I want to keep that on the board. So this function is zero at times zero and its derivative is zero. So H prime is zero on zero. A H of zero equals zero. This implies that H of T is zero for all T.
00:17:36.105 - 00:18:17.175, Speaker A: But now multiply both sides by. What do we want to? We want to. Here I can swap the roles of the dummy indices I and j. So I'm going to. I'm going to call this I and this J. That's the same as doing this. Okay? So by fi prime FJ and sum over I and j, we get fi prime fj.
00:18:17.175 - 00:18:55.141, Speaker A: What was H? It was JI prime JJ minus ji JJ prime. That equals zero and that's exactly. I hope that's minus what I have there. Right, so it's still zero. Okay, so claim two is proved. So we have this. This expression on every sub interval on which the Fs are smooth.
00:18:55.141 - 00:19:46.625, Speaker A: The statement of the lemma is long since gone. But you'll remember what it is when. When the proof comes up. So apply claim number two to both V and J. So for here, this is on, on the sub interval where each fk is smooth and then sum over all those subintervals. So what do we get? Let's do it for V. First we get that I t naught of VV.
00:19:46.625 - 00:20:30.505, Speaker A: Remember this was the integral from 0t 0v prime v prime minus r of v gamma prime gamma prime b dt. And that's the left hand side of my claim number two. So I'm integrating claim number two, you know, from TK minus one to TK. And I'm summing over all those TKs. This becomes by the fundamental theorem of calculus, I'm going to integrate a time derivative from zero to t naught. So that's just going to be this guy evaluated at T0 minus this guy evaluated at 0. But at 0 it vanishes because all the JI's vanish.
00:20:30.505 - 00:21:29.485, Speaker A: And then I'll have the integral of that guy. So this is going to be FIJ FJ JJ Prime@T naught. That's the, that's integrating the time derivative and it's zero at time zero plus the integral from zero to t zero of F prime ji FJ prime JJ et. That's right. That's, that's applying claim number two to V. And if we apply it to J, remember that the fk equals alpha k for J and f k prime therefore is zero. So we're only going to get.
00:21:29.485 - 00:22:27.655, Speaker A: These guys are going to be gone because the derivatives are zero. We're only going to get this thing with the Fs replaced by Alphas. So we're going to have alpha I ji, alpha j j prime at t naught. Okay, so now we are done because we want to look at the difference. So since remember the hypothesis was that v at time t 0 equals j at time t 0, this means that fk at t 0 equals alpha k for all k, right? So if I take the difference of these two things at T, these are the same j's there. These coefficients are the same. So this term, which is the only term that shows up there, is going to cancel and we're only going to be left with the integral term.
00:22:27.655 - 00:23:17.119, Speaker A: So we get that I t naught of vv. I mean, this is true for all, for all t, right? But in particular it's T0 minus I. T naught of JJ is just equal to the integral from 0 to T0. What is this expression? This is the sum over K FK prime jk all squared, which is greater than or equal to zero. Okay? So we've shown that it naught of VV is greater than equal to I T naught of jj. That was, that was the index lemma. That's what we wanted to show.
00:23:17.119 - 00:24:22.985, Speaker A: And now we want to show that the only way you get equality is if V equals j on that closed bounded interval. So suppose we have equality. This means that the sum over k fk prime jk equals 0 for all t in 0 up to t naught. Because remember these guys were piecewise smooth. So it's continuous. And also the jk are linearly independent for all jk at t are linearly independent for t bigger than zero. Okay, and that means that f k prime of t is 0 for t bigger than 0.
00:24:22.985 - 00:25:38.873, Speaker A: And then by continuity, remember we extended them smoothly to T equals zero. Fk prime is identically zero on zero t knot. That means that fk of T FK is constant on zero t zero, but fk of t zero is alpha K. That means that fk of T is alpha k for all t in zero t zero. And that means that V equals j on zero t zero. Okay? So that's the index lemma. It tells us that as long as you don't have any conjugate points on that geodesic, if you have any point, if you have any, if you have a Jacobi field which vanishes at time zero and you have any other piecewise smooth vector field B which also vanishes at time zero, they're both normal to gamma prime, then the index form up to time t0 and j of t0 equals v of t0.
00:25:38.873 - 00:26:33.651, Speaker A: Right? And the index form of j will be less than or equal to the index form on V. And the only way they're going to be equal is going to be if V equals j on that interval. Ok, we are going to use this to prove roush comparison. 1, 2, 3, 4. I have eight pages for the proof of Rauch comparison in my notes and I think we have enough time. Are there any questions about the index lemma before we start? Okay, so I think I misspoke. A couple of lectures ago I said that the Rauch comparison theorem was another application of second variation formula.
00:26:33.651 - 00:27:08.611, Speaker A: It's not. It does use a lot of properties of Jacobi field and it does use the index lemma. But we didn't use the second variation formula here. It's just that the index form is arises as part of the second variation formula. So it doesn't make sense to motivate. Why is this index form important? Why on earth would we consider it if you haven't seen the second variation formula? Okay, so Let me see, I might need. I want to fit it on one board and keep it on the.
00:27:08.611 - 00:27:52.425, Speaker A: On the board as long as possible. But I don't think I can fit it on one board. So. So we'll apply the index lemma to prove the following theorem, which is a very powerful result in Riemannian geometry. It allows you to compare two Romanian manifolds and they don't even have to have the same dimension. If you can compare their curvatures, then you can say something comparatively about their Jacobi fields. And I motivated this.
00:27:52.425 - 00:28:59.213, Speaker A: Before we got to the index lemma last Wednesday, I was reminding you that the curvature measures the sort of spreading of the Jacobi fields, that if you expand Taylor expand the norm of a Jacobi field Near t equals 0, then the first non trivial term, the first deviation from the Euclidean cases that involves a curvature. And the idea was to try to make this a more global statement, not just for t small. So let's let MNG and mn plus k M tilde, n plus kg tilde be Romanian manifolds. So K is at least zero, but it could be positive. So this could be a higher dimensional space, but M is the one with the smaller dimension, or equal. Let gamma and gamma tilde be geodesics. The first one is on M and the second one is on M tilde.
00:28:59.213 - 00:30:09.854, Speaker A: And they're defined for the same amount of time with the same velocity. So that means that the norm of gamma prime of T equals the norm of gamma tilde prime of T for all T. Well, it's constant, right? It's for all T in zero A. We know that the speed of a geodesic is constant. This is the inner product on G, and this is G tilde. Let's let J and J tilde be Jacobi fields along gamma and gamma tilde respectively, such that first of all they both Vanish at time 0. J prime 0, inner product gamma prime 0 is the same as J tilde prime 0, inner product gamma tilde prime 0.
00:30:09.854 - 00:30:55.068, Speaker A: These are not necessarily 0. Remember, if you have a Jacobi field is uniquely determined by its initial value and its initial covariant derivative. And this is just saying that they have the same component of their initial covariant derivative in the direction of their. Of their geodesics. And finally, that the norms of the initial covariant derivatives are equal. Okay, so these are the three conditions on these Jacobi fields. And again this, this if this was 0, this if this non negative real number was 0, then both of these Jacobi fields would be identically.
00:30:55.068 - 00:31:28.132, Speaker A: 0. Sorry, that's if there's no conjugate points. No, no, that's right. This is initial point and initial velocity. If this was zero, then the both Jacobi fields would be would be zero, which is not going to be interesting. And now assume first of all Gamma Tilde has no conjugate points. Conjugate points on 0a, the one that could possibly be larger.
00:31:28.132 - 00:32:31.285, Speaker A: Dimension 2. For all t in 0a and all v in T, Gamma T and V tilde in Gamma tilde T of M tilde, we have that the sectional curvature of M tilde in the plane spanned by V tilde and Gamma tilde prime of T is at least as large as the sectional curvature in M of the plane spanned by V and Gamma prime. Then the norm of J tilde is less than equal to the norm of J for all T. Remember, we saw this. I'm not finished writing the statement. We saw this when we were motivating the Rauch comparison theorem, that if the curvature of M tilde is bigger than the curvature of M, then at least for small time this was true. Right now we're proving it for all time.
00:32:31.285 - 00:33:44.889, Speaker A: Moreover. Sorry, I know I shouldn't write this low, but I want to put the whole statement here. If for sum t0 bigger than 0, we have equality here, J tilde of t0 in the norms equals J of T naught, then the curvature in the plane spanned by J tilde and Gamma tilde prime is equal to the curvature in M spanned by J, t and Gamma prime T for all t up to T naught. Okay, and you can sort of already see how the index lemma is going to show up, right? Because the index lemma was some inequality. And then if we had equality at some time, then it told us something stronger. Okay, so strictly speaking, I guess here I only. I only.
00:33:44.889 - 00:34:17.585, Speaker A: This only makes sense if V is orthogonal to Gamma prime and if V tilde is orthogonal to Gamma Tilde prime. Right, Because I can't define the sectional curvature unless I take two linearly independent vectors. So that's implied when I write this down. Okay, so any questions about the statement? Let's see if we can keep the statements. If I want to keep the statement, I have 1, 2, 3, 4 boards to work with. We'll see. I want to at least keep it for a while.
00:34:17.585 - 00:35:14.235, Speaker A: By the way, I think we might be able to prove it today. But we're not going to get to the applications till Wednesday. One of the applications will be that you can use this theorem if you know Something about the curvature, the sectional curvature on the Riemannian manifold, you can deduce something about how far away consecutive conjugate points are on a geodesic. Okay? And we've already seen that conjugate points are places where bad things happen, right? Where the exponential map is no longer. It's a critical point for the exponential map, so it's no longer local diffeomorphism at those points. But on Assignment 4, which I posted yesterday, the first thing you'll do is to show that if you have a conjugate point along a geodesic, then after that conjugate point, the geodesic is definitely never minimizing. Right? So they're only minimizing.
00:35:14.235 - 00:36:26.565, Speaker A: They can only be minimizing until the first conjugate point. Once they pass a conjugate point, they can't be minimizing anymore. Right? So that's giving you more geometric meaning for conjugate points. Okay, let's do this. So recall at the end of chapter five, when we proved a whole bunch of properties of Jacobi fields, we saw that the inner product of JT with gamma prime of T was an affine linear function. It was j prime 0, gamma prime 0 times t plus j of 0, gamma prime of 0. That was one of the properties for any Jacobi field, Jacobi field along gamma, we have j of 0 equals j, tilde of 0 equals 0 and j prime 0, inner product gamma prime 0 is equal to j tilde prime 0, gamma tilde prime 0.
00:36:26.565 - 00:37:10.245, Speaker A: Right? The the first two of the properties that are circled on the right hand board are this one and this one. So that means this term is gone for both of them. And this term is the same. So j this term is the same. And this is just a T. So that means that J of t inner product gamma prime of T is equal to J tilde of t, inner product gamma tilde prime of T for all T. Right? Those first two conditions force the inner product of the Jacobi field with the direction vector of the geodesic to always be the same.
00:37:10.245 - 00:38:52.533, Speaker A: Also, if I. If I now take this equation, this part is zero for us, and if I multiply it by gamma prime of T on both sides, I get that J of t gamma prime of T times gamma prime of T is equal to j prime of 0, gamma prime of 0, t gamma prime of t and gamma prime of T in norm is equal to gamma tilde prime of t, norm is the same. Right? These are the same speed. So what does this say? This says the Tangential components of J and J tilde have the same length, right? Because I want to take what is the tangential component. If I take J of T, I want to take the inner product with gamma prime of T, the unit vector in the gamma prime of T direction. And I want to take the length of this. That's going to be j prime of 0, gamma prime of 0, absolute value times the absolute value of T times gamma prime of t over C squared.
00:38:52.533 - 00:39:45.795, Speaker A: And this is the same for gamma and gamma tilde. But this is the same. And this is the same, right? So if I replace this with the tildes is equal. Okay, so what does that mean? We're going to argue that we can, without loss of generality, assume that our Jacobi fields are normal. So we can write J as a tangential part plus a normal part. And we can write J Tilda as a tangential part plus a normal part. And if I take the norm squared, these are orthogonal to each other, and J tilde, this is J tilde t squared plus J tilde n squared.
00:39:45.795 - 00:40:43.225, Speaker A: So we just showed on the previous board that these are equal. Okay? So therefore, to our. What do we want to prove? We want to prove that J tilde in norm is less than or equal to J in norm. So J squared minus J tilde squared is = to jn^2 -j tilde n squared. So. So we can, without loss of generality, suppose that both J and J tilde are normal Jacobi fields because the conclusion is unchanged. So let's look at the statement and make sure we understand that.
00:40:43.225 - 00:41:46.415, Speaker A: So we want to prove J J tilde n will be less than or equal to J if and only if it's true for the normal parts, right? And their tangential parts have the same length. And then the equality will only happen if their normal parts have the same norm. And then the tangential part doesn't contribute to this anyway, right? There's. If there's a tangential part and I wedge it with gamma prime, it drops out. So what we're trying to prove is going to be unchanged if we assume that both Jacobi fields are normal. Okay? So without loss of generality, we can assume that J gamma prime equals J tilde. Gamma tilde prime is 0 for all t.
00:41:46.415 - 00:42:46.475, Speaker A: Okay? Also, so I've used these first two conditions. I haven't used this one yet. We also have that the norm of j prime of 0 equals the norm of j tilde prime of 0. If these are both 0, let's call this lambda, which is greater than equal to zero. If lambda equals zero, then both J and J tilde are identically zero and the conclusion is trivial, right? Because if J and J tilde are both zero, then certainly this holds and equality holds everywhere. And I mean, this doesn't even make sense, right, because J is zero. So you can't talk about this actual curvature and direction of j.
00:42:46.475 - 00:43:22.565, Speaker A: So assume lambda is positive. I think I can. I think I can erase this. I don't. I'm not going to use this again. And I can also erase. I don't think I'm going to use these again, but I'm going to keep this part right, because we haven't used these conditions yet.
00:43:22.565 - 00:44:44.065, Speaker A: Okay, let's define F of T to be the norm of j of t squared and F tilde of T to be the norm of J tilde of t squared. So both F and F tilde are smooth because Jacobi fields are smooth and the norm squared is smooth. And since gamma tilde has no conjugate points, that's this guy here. We know that we have that F tilde of T is positive for all t, for all t bigger than zero, right? F of zero and F tilde of zero are zero. Right? The Jacobi fields vanish at time zero. But this guy doesn't vanish at any other time, because if it did, that's exactly a conjugate point. Okay, so the function F of t divided by F tilde of T is well defined for all t positive.
00:44:44.065 - 00:45:34.877, Speaker A: What do we want to show? We want to show that the norm of J is bigger than the norm of J tilde. That's the same as the square. This squared is bigger than this squared. We want to show that F tilde F over F tilde is at least one. Okay, well, I'm being a little sloppy here. Right at we want to show that that F is greater than or equal to F tilde on 0a. Okay, but we know that at zero they're equal and we know that at time bigger than zero the denominator is positive.
00:45:34.877 - 00:46:34.309, Speaker A: So we want to show that equivalently F over F tilde is at least one on open zero close date. That's what we want to show. Okay, now this is, this is a nice use of elementary first variable cal. First year calculus. Single variable calculus. So what is F prime? F prime is 2j j prime and f tilde prime is 2j tilde j tilde prime. So because J vanishes at time 0, we have that f prime of 0 is f tilde prime of 0 is 0 and what about F double prime? That's going to be 2J prime squared plus 2J double prime.
00:46:34.309 - 00:47:14.561, Speaker A: And F tilde double prime is 2J tilde prime squared plus 2J tilde J tilde double prime. So I want to look at the limit as T goes to 0 of F of T over F tilde of T. Well, this goes. This is zero over zero. These are both smooth functions, right? So this is a zero over zero. So I want to apply lhopitals rule and I'll get the limit as of F prime over F tilde prime. But that's also zero over zero.
00:47:14.561 - 00:48:00.905, Speaker A: So we do it twice. This is the limit as T goes to 0 of F double prime of T over F tilde double prime of T. And now this is going to be zero there because j and j tilde are zero. But this is not going to be zero. And it's going to their ratios is one, right? This is equal to j prime 0 squared over j tilde prime 0 squared, which is one. Okay, so this function has limit 1 f over f tilde. It's defined for t positive and it has limit 1 as T goes to 0.
00:48:00.905 - 00:49:23.255, Speaker A: So to prove that J tilde is less than or equal to J on 0a, it suffices to show that D by dt of F over F tilde is greater than or equal to zero. Okay, because this function starts out at one, and if it's increasing, then it's always going to be at least one. But by the quotient rule, this is equivalent to showing that F prime F tilde minus F tilde prime is greater than or equal to zero. Because this is the denominator that's just D by dt of this quotient. This is always positive for t greater than zero. So this is equivalent to F prime F tilde is greater than or equal to F F tilde prime on 0a. So this is what we need to show.
00:49:23.255 - 00:50:10.087, Speaker A: We reduce it to this calculus statement. Suppose that F of some T0 equals zero. So let T0 be some time where F vanishes. That means J of T naught equals zero. Because remember, the definition of F was just the norm of j, and that means that F prime of T naught equals zero. Because if you go back and you look at the expression for F prime, if j vanishes at some time T naught, then F prime will vanish. And you see that both sides of this will then be zero at t naught.
00:50:10.087 - 00:51:02.035, Speaker A: So star holds whenever F of T naught is zero. Okay, so now we can assume that F of T naught is positive because it's not negative. So now suppose F of T naught is positive. What we're saying here is that star holds trivially at any point where F vanishes. So I can even put zero here, because we know that F vanishes at time zero, right? So it holds at time zero and it holds at any other time where F vanishes. So now we can suppose F of T naught is positive. So that certainly T0 has to be bigger than zero.
00:51:02.035 - 00:52:09.295, Speaker A: So we want to show that F prime over F is bigger than or equal to f tilde prime t 0 over f tilde t 0. Right? I've just rearranged star. OK, let's define u of t to be 1 over the square root of F of T naught times J of T naught, J of T and U tilde of T to be one over the same. No, sorry. F tilde of T. Now we know that F Tilde is never 0, right after after time 0, J Tilde of T. So these are just constant multiples of J and J tilde, okay? And therefore they're both Jacobi fields, because the space of Jacobi fields is a, is a vector space.
00:52:09.295 - 00:52:49.453, Speaker A: So this one is on. On gamma and gamma tilde, respectively. Okay? And the way I've chosen to define them, you can see that at time T naught they have length 1. So u of t0 and u tilde of T naught are. You have length one because this is exactly the norm of j tilde at t0. And this is the norm of j at t0. And this is only.
00:52:49.453 - 00:53:17.209, Speaker A: Only at t0. So let's compute. We want to show this, right? So let's compute f prime of t 0 over f of T naught. That's going to be by the formula for F prime, which is still on the. On the left. J prime t 0 j of t naught over J of T naught, J of T naught. This is F of T naught.
00:53:17.209 - 00:54:13.245, Speaker A: So I can write it as the square root of F of T naught times the square root of F of T naught. So this is going to be 2U Prime T0U of T0, which is the same thing as inner product of U U prime at T naught. I haven't used two yet, but I don't think it makes sense for me to write up here. So I'll go back to the left. So this is. This guy is this. And similarly F tilde of T naught over prime over F tilde of T naught is U tilde, U Tilde Prime T0.
00:54:13.245 - 00:55:32.525, Speaker A: Now you can start to see where the index lemma is going to commit. We're doing fine on time. Okay, so. So F Prime at T0 divided by F at T0 we just showed is the derivative of u inner product U at T naught. But by the fundamental theorem of calculus, that's equal to the integral from 0 to t 0 of the second derivative of u, dt, right? Because the integral of the second derivative is the first derivative at the two endpoints. But at t equals 0, u vanishes, right, because j vanishes at t equals 0. So I wrote this as an integral, and then that's equal to by just multiplying this out, this is 2U prime prime, and that's equal to 2 integral 0 to T0U prime U prime plus U U double prime.
00:55:32.525 - 00:56:48.945, Speaker A: And then because U is a Jacobi field, it's a scalar multiple of J, this becomes zero to T naught U prime U prime minus R of u gamma prime, gamma prime U. I just wrote out the Jacobi equation for U double prime, and that's equal to two times the index form up to T naught applied to uu. Okay, so what have we shown? We've shown that F of T naught over f prime of t0 over f of t0 is 2, it naught uu. And exactly the same calculation with tildes everywhere gives you two I T naught of U tilde, U tilde. And now you can see that this star, which I want to compare these two expressions, is a comparison of the index forms. So that's where the index lemma is going to come in. You don't need this guy anymore.
00:56:48.945 - 00:58:16.411, Speaker A: So, star becomes I T naught of U tilde. U tilde is less than or equal to I T naught of uu. So this is what we have to prove. Okay, so let's let E1 up to EN be a parallel orthonormal frame along gamma, with E1 being gamma prime over the norm of gamma prime. Remember, gamma prime is not necessarily normalized, and E2@t0 to be U of T naught. Okay, so what have I done here? Here's where we use the fact that U at T naught is length one, and we also use the fact that J is orthogonal to gamma prime for all T. So it's still here, right? When we made the assumption that we can now consider normalized Jacobi fields.
00:58:16.411 - 00:58:56.039, Speaker A: Normal Jacobi fields. This guy's orthogonal to gamma prime. And at time T naught, U of T0 is orthogonal to gamma prime and it has length one. So this could be E2 at T0. And what I'm doing now is I'm doing parallel transport back and forward from T0. So do parallel transport forwards and backwards from T naught from gamma T0. Usually we did this at the initial point and we parallel transported along along gamma from gamma of zero.
00:58:56.039 - 01:00:34.519, Speaker A: But now I've got this unit vector at T naught and I'm parallel transporting back and forth. I don't need this anymore. And similarly, let E1 tilde up to en +k tilde be a parallel orthonormal frame along gamma tilde such that e 1 tilde again is the velocity of the geodesic and e 2 of t 0 is u tilde of T naught. So I have these two conditions, okay? So I've reduced it to showing this. This is the new star, right? And I've chosen these frames. Suppose I want to define an operation which takes vector fields along gamma to vector fields along gamma tilde, which has nice properties where I can use it to compare. Because you see, these are index forms on different manifolds, right? This is on M tilde, and this is on M.
01:00:34.519 - 01:01:57.045, Speaker A: And the index lemma is about the index form for two different vector fields along the same geodesic, right? So I can't just apply the index lemma here. Suppose V is a piecewise smooth vector field along gamma. We can write using this frame. We can write V of T is the sum From I equals 1 up to n g I of t D I of T where GI is from 0A to R is piecewise smooth. This is just using the fact that these guys are an orthonormal frame. And define a vector field phi v along gamma tilde by the following phi v of T is going to be the same coefficients. But now we have EI tilde of T.
01:01:57.045 - 01:03:05.151, Speaker A: So this doesn't involve doesn't involve en plus one tilde up to en plus k tilde. Okay? Whenever I have a piecewise smooth vector field along gamma, I can do this, and this is piecewise smooth because the G's are piecewise smooth. So let's look at some properties of this map. So map this map phi is taking vector fields along gamma to vector fields along gamma tilde. You can see that by construction of phi. First of all, it's an isometry, right? Because how do I get the norm of this? These are orthonormal, so the norm of this is the sum of the squares of the GI's, the norm squared, but so is this, right? So it's an isometry. And also if I take phi of V and I covariantly differentiate it along gamma tilde, that's equal to phi applied to V prime.
01:03:05.151 - 01:04:11.023, Speaker A: Because if I want to take prime of this, those guys are parallel. So it's just going to be the GI primes. But that's exactly what happens if I do prime of this first, because these are parallel, I'll just get the GI primes and phi sends it to that with the GI primes. So these two conditions are obvious from the definition of the map phi. Let me call these A and B, because I'm going to use them now. I'm going to finally use condition two on the curvature. Okay, so since the geodesics have the same velocity, the same speed, and by the hypothesis two, well, let me do one step at a time.
01:04:11.023 - 01:05:42.355, Speaker A: What do we get? We have that if V is in T gamma T of M orthogonal to gamma prime of t and length 1 and v tilde is in t gamma tilde T of M tilde orthogonal to gamma tilde prime of T and length one, then V, this thing is equal to V tilde squared, gamma tilde prime squared. This is where I use the fact that they have the same speed. These are both length one here. And this is zero. This is equal to V tilde wedge gamma tilde prime squared. Okay, so that's immediate. And now by the hypothesis two on the, on the sectional curvatures, we have V composed V wedge gamma prime squared times K of V wedge gamma prime.
01:05:42.355 - 01:06:14.849, Speaker A: That's equal to R of V gamma prime, gamma prime V. And this is, this is greater than or equal to. See the. Sorry. Less than or equal to this is less than or equal to K tilde of V tilde wedge gamma tilde prime. And this is the same. These are equal and this is less than or equal to this.
01:06:14.849 - 01:07:16.115, Speaker A: So this is less than equal to this. And this is R tilde of V tilde, gamma tilde prime, gamma tilde prime, V tilde. So in fact, I don't need this to be length one, I just need this to be equal, right? That's all I needed, that these had the same length. So I want to keep that guy. So let's apply now this curvature assumption that says that this is less than or equal to this one. So hence if I, if I let let little V, let V be equal to V at time T and let v tilde be 5v at time T. These have the same norm.
01:07:16.115 - 01:07:52.885, Speaker A: I guess strictly speaking, this, what I wrote here is all correct. Right. But I really want things that are normal to gamma prime so it doesn't change these things. Right. And my U and U tilde are normal to. I'm going to apply this to you and you to you, to you. So this is.
01:07:52.885 - 01:08:48.925, Speaker A: So assume that G1 is zero. So V is normal to gamma prime. And then 5V is normal to gamma tilde prime. Okay? So I'm going to do that. And what do I get? I'm going to plug them in here. We get R tilde of phi V, Gamma tilde prime, Gamma tilde prime. Inner product phi V is greater than or equal to R of V Gamma prime, gamma prime V.
01:08:48.925 - 01:09:33.163, Speaker A: Also phi of v prime. Phi of V prime. That's equal to phi of V prime. Phi of V prime which is equal to V prime V prime. Using these two properties, this is B and this is A. Okay? So that means if I calculate the index form, we get I T naught of phi U. What did I.
01:09:33.163 - 01:10:10.639, Speaker A: Sorry. This is. This is. Yeah, this is true. So U certainly has the property that it's U is normal to gamma prime and U tilde is normal to gamma tilde prime. So I get. If I do this, this is the integral from 0 to T0 of Phi U prime phi U prime minus R of phi U gamma prime, gamma prime, phi U V T.
01:10:10.639 - 01:10:34.005, Speaker A: What have I shown that this is equal to 0 to t naught U prime U prime. And that guy is. This is for any V which is normal to gamma prime. So this guy is less than this. So minus this will be greater than minus that. Sorry. This guy.
01:10:34.005 - 01:10:59.147, Speaker A: What am I doing? I put the wrong. No, this is right. Sorry. This should be. This should be. This is on M tilde, right? So these should be tilde. Okay, Phi of U is on M tilde.
01:10:59.147 - 01:12:06.765, Speaker A: So this guy is greater than or equal to this. So minus that will be less than or equal to dt, which is I T naught of uu. Okay, so what have we shown? We've shown that it naught of phi u, phi U is less than or equal to I T naught of uu. Let's call this one dagger. Almost done. Okay, now we're going to use the index lemma because we have two vector fields now on M Tilde, we have phi of U and we have U tilde. So U tilde and phi of U are both vector fields piecewise.
01:12:06.765 - 01:12:42.763, Speaker A: Smooth vector fields along gamma tilde, U tilde of zero is zero. That's because J tilde of zero is zero. Phi U of zero is zero. And that's because J of zero equals zero. Remember, U was up to a constant. Was, was, was j and phi was an isometry. So it doesn't take 0 to 0.
01:12:42.763 - 01:13:40.711, Speaker A: And u tilde is orthogonal to gamma prime. This is because J tilde and gamma prime tilde are zero and phi U gamma tilde prime equals zero. And that's again because J is orthogonal to gamma prime and phi is an isometry. So you should, you should check that phi of gamma prime is gamma tilde prime. And that's clear from the definition of phi. So we claim that u tilde of t0 is equal to phi u at t0. Well, let's see what we had.
01:13:40.711 - 01:14:47.297, Speaker A: We had U tilde at t naught was e2 tilde at t naught, and phi U at T naught is phi of u of t0, which is phi of e2 of t naught, which is e2 tilde of t naught by the definition of U and U tilde by the definition of the E2s and the definition of phi. Okay, so we've got these are both. These two vector fields along gamma tilde. They both vanish at time zero. They're both orthogonal to the geodesic gamma tilde and they agree at time zero. And also, also U tilde is a Jacobi field because it was just a constant multiple of J tilde. So we can apply the index lemma.
01:14:47.297 - 01:15:32.025, Speaker A: The index lemma applies. We get I T naught of U tilde. U tilde is less than or equal to I T naught of phi U, phi U. Call this guy sharp. Okay, so now sharp and dagger gives you star, right? Because this guy is less than that guy, which is less than this guy. Okay, so we proved. So we proved.
01:15:32.025 - 01:16:10.223, Speaker A: I'm going to be able to finish. We proved the. We proved that. What did we prove? J tilde is less than or equal to J. For all T. Okay. Notice that hence F of T is at least F of T naught, which is, sorry, F tilde of T which is positive for all T bigger than zero.
01:16:10.223 - 01:16:52.455, Speaker A: So one conclusion we get already. Our assumption was that gamma tilde had no conjugate points. But now we know that gamma has no conjugate points. So gamma of T is not conjugate to gamma of 0 for all t positive. That wasn't part of the hypothesis. It's a conclusion we found. The only thing that's left to prove now is this statement about the equality, right, that if equality holds for some time T naught on the norms on F and F tilde, then we get this result about the curvature.
01:16:52.455 - 01:17:53.339, Speaker A: So finally, suppose that J of T naught equals J tilde of T naught in norm for some T naught positive. We've shown that F of T over F tilde of T is increasing for all T from 0 to A, right? Because the derivative is greater than or equal to 0 and it's equal to 1 at time 0. The limit is 1 at times 0 and J of T naught is equal to J tilde of T naught is positive. Our hypothesis is this, right? These are positive. There's no more. There's no more. There's no conjugate points anywhere.
01:17:53.339 - 01:18:42.245, Speaker A: So this implies that F over F tilde is constant on 0 to t 0, right? Because it's the limit. As t goes to 0 is 1, its derivative is greater than or equal to 0. And we're assuming that at some other positive time t, it's still one. That means it didn't, didn't go up at all. So hence F prime F tilde is equal to F tilde prime F for all T from 0 to T naught. That's just the derivative, the numerator of the derivative of F over F tilde. So all the, all the inequalities above are actually equalities.
01:18:42.245 - 01:19:19.675, Speaker A: Okay? So here, GI Carmo leaves some gaps in the argument. So from. So we have two inequalities that become equalities. Geiger and Sharpe. Right? So from I T of U tilde, U tilde equals it of phi U and phi U. And the index lemma, we know about equality. In the index lemma we get that U tilde is phi U on 0, T0.
01:19:19.675 - 01:20:17.375, Speaker A: That's exactly the equality case. In the index lemma. And from it of phi U, phi U equals it of uu on for all t in 0t naught, we get. If you guys give me 90 seconds, I think we'll be done. I've erased the conclusion, Unfortunately. We get 0 to T Phi U prime phi U prime minus R tilde, phi U, gamma Tilde prime gamma tilde Prime Phi U DT is equal to 0 to T. And we already know that this.
01:20:17.375 - 01:21:10.195, Speaker A: Well, I'm just writing this guy. We already know that these are equal. That means that these are equal. But by the inequality on curvature, right? This integral equals this integral. But one of them is always greater than or equal to the other. The only way that can happen is if they're equal, we get R tilde of phi U gamma tilde prime gamma tilde prime phi U is equal to R U gamma prime gamma prime U on 0 and T naught. And that.
01:21:10.195 - 01:21:57.557, Speaker A: What does that mean? This one is already equal to U tilde. So if you now multiply through by F of T naught, you get that R tilde of J tilde gamma prime tilde equals R of j Gamma prime on 0T0. Okay, so I went through this thing, this last bit a little quick, but it's not hard to see what's happening. Okay, sorry, I went two minutes over, but I really didn't want to leave two. You know, two minutes of a proof that we've been doing for an hour on. On Wednesday. I'll restate the Roush comparison theorem.
01:21:57.557 - 01:22:29.575, Speaker A: Obviously, we're done with the proof, never going to look at the proof again, and I'm going to talk about two applications of it, and then we will probably move on to chapter 11. Okay, any questions? So, as I said, Docarmo is a little sloppy at the end of this proof here because he only talks about one of these equalities, sharp or dagger, and then he kind of forgets to mention the other one, but you need to use both of them to get the conclusion.
