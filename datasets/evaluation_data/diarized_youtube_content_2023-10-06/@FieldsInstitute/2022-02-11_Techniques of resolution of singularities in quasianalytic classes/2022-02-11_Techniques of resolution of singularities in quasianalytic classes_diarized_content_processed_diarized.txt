00:00:05.160 - 00:00:52.932, Speaker A: Okay, so welcome everyone, for the, for the second lecture today, I'm going to talk about, well, I'm going to make the statement of resolution of singularities and I will talk about some applications to quasi analytic sets. So I want to start the beginning of the, of the first part is going to have several definitions because we want to get the full statement of the, of the theorem. I won't prove the theorems of resolution similarities today. Well, I will give a proof of the local version later on the course. And afterwards I'm going to talk mostly about applications to like uniformization theorems and their consequences. And in there I'm going to do the proofs. Okay, so this is kind of the plan.
00:00:52.932 - 00:01:04.420, Speaker A: So I will start by talking about a property that I feel like it's important to understand the difficulty of working with code analytic classes, which is actually the failure of Viceroy's preparation.
00:01:04.492 - 00:01:07.864, Speaker B: So let me start here by.
00:01:13.084 - 00:01:14.144, Speaker C: Properties.
00:01:15.444 - 00:01:19.304, Speaker B: So a class of functions.
00:01:21.524 - 00:01:22.264, Speaker A: See.
00:01:24.204 - 00:01:24.492, Speaker C: He.
00:01:24.508 - 00:01:29.664, Speaker B: Said to satisfy devices property.
00:01:40.164 - 00:01:53.444, Speaker A: If whenever we take a function, if for all functions, let's say germs that are at zero are zero. So I'm going to write like this, germs at zero, zero belongs to rn.
00:01:57.064 - 00:02:02.000, Speaker B: Do it with a here if we.
00:02:02.032 - 00:02:20.916, Speaker A: Know that there exists a d n. Or maybe I'm going to write in slightly different ways. And what I did in the note might be clearer if we know that if we take say, the first entry and then all of the other entries.
00:02:21.060 - 00:02:24.436, Speaker B: So this is in rn and all.
00:02:24.460 - 00:02:32.344, Speaker A: Of the other entries, and this is not equivalent to zero in particular, at zero, it's not going to be to zero.
00:02:32.924 - 00:02:33.664, Speaker C: Then.
00:02:36.344 - 00:02:41.524, Speaker B: There exists a d in the natural numbers and functions.
00:02:44.824 - 00:02:46.096, Speaker A: At least function germs.
00:02:46.160 - 00:02:49.672, Speaker B: I'm going to call it c. Oops.
00:02:49.768 - 00:02:59.840, Speaker A: I made a mistake. I'm not talking about quite analytic classes, I'm talking about classes, which is there.
00:02:59.912 - 00:03:08.714, Speaker B: And let's say f I for I.
00:03:08.754 - 00:03:11.458, Speaker A: Equals to zero up until d minus.
00:03:11.506 - 00:03:20.994, Speaker B: One such that the function f of x is given by c of x times.
00:03:21.034 - 00:03:34.242, Speaker A: Now a polynomial with coefficients given by yi fi. So x one to the power d plus. And what I didn't say there is that each one of these alpha only depends on the variables x two to.
00:03:34.258 - 00:03:52.210, Speaker B: The x n x one to the power I I, going from zero to d minus one, and c of zero in this case is not zero.
00:03:52.322 - 00:03:57.194, Speaker A: So it's a unit. So it means that apart from a unit, apart from maybe taking a very.
00:03:57.234 - 00:04:00.324, Speaker B: Small open set of zero, we can.
00:04:00.364 - 00:04:04.624, Speaker A: Write it just as a polynomial with coefficients in the same class.
00:04:05.484 - 00:04:13.668, Speaker B: Okay, this is the viceroys property. So we do know that in the analytic case it's valid.
00:04:13.836 - 00:04:22.508, Speaker A: So in the analogy, there is the viceroy's property, the viceroy's property.
00:04:22.556 - 00:04:25.684, Speaker B: This is more viceroys preparation theorem.
00:04:33.624 - 00:04:42.712, Speaker A: And we also know that the infinity also satisfy devices property.
00:04:42.768 - 00:04:45.804, Speaker B: And this is Malgrange preparation.
00:04:48.584 - 00:04:50.376, Speaker A: So later on in the course, I'm.
00:04:50.400 - 00:04:59.524, Speaker B: Going to talk more about kind of the heuristic of why it works in this class, but it does not hold.
00:04:59.604 - 00:05:04.380, Speaker A: For quasi analytic classes in general. So here, the theorem that I'm just.
00:05:04.412 - 00:05:08.584, Speaker B: Going to cite from PR RP.
00:05:16.364 - 00:05:16.676, Speaker C: In.
00:05:16.700 - 00:05:40.844, Speaker B: 2013 is that if two is a quasi analytic class satisfying device property, then you are the analytic class.
00:05:41.224 - 00:06:15.886, Speaker A: So there's no other example for quasi analytic classes before besides the analytic ones, which admits devices preparation. And one thing that you might recall is that. So later on I'm going to give an heuristic about why it holds in these classes, but it does not in here. But for now, I'm just going to use the theorem as it is, just to cite one of the issues that we're going to find out, and an open problem here. So if you recall, how do you.
00:06:15.910 - 00:06:22.118, Speaker B: Want to assume in your formulation of the wire stress property that these coefficients f I vanish at zero?
00:06:22.286 - 00:06:23.394, Speaker A: Oh, I do.
00:06:25.174 - 00:06:25.994, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:06:29.254 - 00:06:29.994, Speaker A: For.
00:06:31.694 - 00:06:35.278, Speaker B: I equal to zero to d minus one.
00:06:35.326 - 00:06:58.002, Speaker A: Thanks. I do want that. So, a question here. Before making the question, let me give you a notation. Let a be a point, say in.
00:06:58.018 - 00:07:06.974, Speaker B: Our n we denote by qma the.
00:07:07.014 - 00:07:07.714, Speaker A: Germs.
00:07:10.294 - 00:07:33.554, Speaker B: Of quadrantic functions. Thank you, Addie. And any question we can is q I lutherium.
00:07:35.934 - 00:07:51.554, Speaker A: So recall that a local ring like this. So this is going to be a local ring. So our local ring, commutative local ring. Well, not even commutative local ring is noetherium if every ideal.
00:07:55.154 - 00:07:59.334, Speaker B: Admits a finite set of generators.
00:08:06.994 - 00:08:36.634, Speaker D: Now this is quite so, Andre, before you go much further, I just wanted to ask you the fact that the fi vanish at zero. I see that you can make a choice of d such that it's true, right? But you can also pick another d. Like if you have a polynomial, a pure polynomial in x one, then you can, you don't necessarily have this, right? So like this, you prefer that the f I vanish at the origin.
00:08:37.414 - 00:08:46.718, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just asking, like for the property itself, I'm just going to ask that this d is kind of minimal in that sense, right? So this would be equivalent to having this fi equals to zero, because you.
00:08:46.726 - 00:08:52.994, Speaker D: Would want this in the SQL. You will use the fact that the fi vanish at the origin or that these minimal.
00:08:55.334 - 00:09:04.950, Speaker A: I'm not going to use explicitly right now, but it's a useful property. Yes, but it's just, I'm not going to use it explicitly now. I just wanted to.
00:09:04.982 - 00:09:08.838, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, thanks.
00:09:08.966 - 00:09:13.954, Speaker A: Actually, like I don't think I'm going to use explicitly anything related to devicers property.
00:09:14.654 - 00:09:18.194, Speaker B: It's more a comment about what doesn't work.
00:09:18.654 - 00:09:50.294, Speaker A: And therefore this is a question here. If the ideals, if the local ideals are neutrinos, so in particular, being finite generator is something that it's not given for a quasi analytic class. So this is an open question, interesting to know the answer. And therefore there's going to be several little difficulties that will appear later on when we started talking about the algebraic case related to the fact that we do not know if it's not syrian or not.
00:09:52.434 - 00:09:53.174, Speaker C: So.
00:09:56.194 - 00:09:59.530, Speaker A: Now that I started with this, I wanted to kind of set up.
00:09:59.602 - 00:10:02.226, Speaker B: Some of the objects that are going.
00:10:02.250 - 00:10:22.554, Speaker A: To appear in later on for the statement of resolution of singularities. And I wanted to start by defining what a blowing up is. But somehow I wanted to be, to be clear about what is the objective here. The objective is almost completely to.
00:10:24.254 - 00:10:24.654, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:10:24.694 - 00:10:54.774, Speaker A: Recall for those that are not completely familiar and to set notation. But I don't think that if you ever saw the blowing ups in your life, then it might not be a full presentation. It's more to fix notation and to give you, if you have never seen it, material, to go to search after it, because it is going to be the building blocks of the resolution of singularities. So maybe just before setting everything, I just want to say that m for.
00:10:54.814 - 00:10:56.486, Speaker B: Us is going to be.
00:10:56.510 - 00:10:57.974, Speaker A: So we're going to fix, actually start.
00:10:58.014 - 00:10:58.594, Speaker B: With.
00:11:06.874 - 00:11:09.494, Speaker A: To a quadrantic class.
00:11:14.994 - 00:11:17.722, Speaker C: And a.
00:11:17.738 - 00:11:39.514, Speaker A: Quadrantic manifold, which we can understand in the usual way. So it's a manifold as infinity manifold, where the atlas here is going to be the quasi analytic class. The transition maps, everything are going to be quas analytic. The function field that we're going to consider over it is going to be quad analytic and manifold is going to be smooth.
00:11:40.334 - 00:11:44.874, Speaker B: And just before q of a is the.
00:11:47.894 - 00:11:49.114, Speaker A: Ring of germs.
00:11:55.294 - 00:11:56.154, Speaker B: Heading.
00:11:57.394 - 00:12:10.054, Speaker A: Okay, so we start with the notion of blowing up. Well, all of the blowing ups that we're going to do are going to be with move centers. So this is going to be.
00:12:14.914 - 00:12:15.974, Speaker B: Kind of given.
00:12:16.354 - 00:12:34.890, Speaker A: Now let's start in our end so that we review also the way that we usually set the, the chart. So we start by taking n equals to rn. This is our first case and we.
00:12:35.042 - 00:12:44.098, Speaker B: Coordinate x equals to x one x.
00:12:44.146 - 00:12:50.774, Speaker A: N and c, which is going to be this, what we call the center of going up. I'm going to write it in a second.
00:12:51.914 - 00:12:54.946, Speaker B: It's going to be what I'm going.
00:12:54.970 - 00:13:00.374, Speaker A: To use a zero locus of x one xt. So this is just the set.
00:13:04.994 - 00:13:05.330, Speaker C: When.
00:13:05.362 - 00:13:10.614, Speaker A: They are all given by zero. So we're going to see why this notation a little bit later on.
00:13:13.074 - 00:13:13.362, Speaker C: In.
00:13:13.378 - 00:13:18.094, Speaker A: The center and the blowing up map.
00:13:24.644 - 00:13:38.104, Speaker B: We center is a projection from.
00:13:39.964 - 00:13:40.300, Speaker C: M.
00:13:40.332 - 00:13:43.824, Speaker A: Cuba, which is something contained in our.
00:13:44.244 - 00:13:48.944, Speaker B: N times projected space in our.
00:13:52.044 - 00:13:52.404, Speaker C: T.
00:13:52.444 - 00:14:12.760, Speaker B: Minus loop t minus one into rn where m tilde is equal to the pairs d phi PI in rn of.
00:14:12.792 - 00:14:14.004, Speaker A: The projected space.
00:14:18.864 - 00:14:27.484, Speaker B: Such that xi y is equal to y I x j.
00:14:28.344 - 00:14:31.124, Speaker A: For y smaller or equal to I.
00:14:31.864 - 00:15:02.614, Speaker B: J small or equal to t. And maybe I should say here where the y's are coordinates of this projected space. Took the wrong one.
00:15:04.634 - 00:15:06.214, Speaker A: Again, took the wrong one.
00:15:09.914 - 00:15:10.298, Speaker C: Okay.
00:15:10.306 - 00:16:05.934, Speaker A: It's not allowing me to keep it there. The m two, that is going to be the blowed up space. The c is the center. And we're going to give the name for this. The prey image of the center is what we're calling the exceptional visor. So the idea, if you want, is that for every one of the points over the center here, the line, we're going to replace it by a projective space, the space of all directions passing through it. So the easier way is to think of this.
00:16:05.934 - 00:16:34.134, Speaker A: The easier example is in n two and with center given by x one, x two. So we are blowing up the point in two reals and we are replacing the point by a p one. And what we're doing is that every one of the directions, every one of the different directions that are coming here, they're going to be taken for different values.
00:16:35.194 - 00:16:37.294, Speaker B: Oops, this is a different color.
00:16:47.694 - 00:16:48.006, Speaker C: Are.
00:16:48.030 - 00:17:03.074, Speaker A: Going to be given by different directions. So we are just separating all of the possible directions of our two in this case. Now something that is going to play a role later on is the notion of the charts that we're going to consider.
00:17:05.134 - 00:17:06.526, Speaker B: And now this is going to give us.
00:17:06.550 - 00:17:29.782, Speaker A: So we have this construction, maybe a couple of remarks. This is a, a nice projection outside of the fiber e. We call it exceptional divisor because outside of e this application is an isomorphism. The application from MT to rn is going to be an isomorphism and it's also going to be a proper mapping. So I'm going to give the definition later on. But the proper mapping is going to.
00:17:29.798 - 00:17:47.574, Speaker B: Play an important role for us later on. We're going to see in applications or comment above. When I change colors, there is problems.
00:17:49.434 - 00:18:13.174, Speaker A: Directional charts. So we make over. So it's a projected space. So we make over. M tilde by t charts more but.
00:18:13.254 - 00:18:30.546, Speaker B: T local charts of the platform. So UK contain antiilde where UK is going to be is on morphic here.
00:18:30.570 - 00:18:44.494, Speaker A: To rn with coordinate systems like this.
00:18:45.154 - 00:19:05.950, Speaker B: You noted like this, K minus one and K plus one again such that.
00:19:06.102 - 00:19:10.834, Speaker A: In this coordinate system, what we want to say is that we can relate the original.
00:19:17.614 - 00:19:19.334, Speaker B: Coordinates which were an x.
00:19:19.454 - 00:19:40.624, Speaker A: Coordinate with the new one. And now the U is going to play the role. U equals zero plays a role of the exceptional divisors. And all of this vi is here. Two k minus one. Then Xk is just going to be equal to U.
00:19:41.444 - 00:19:44.972, Speaker B: And all of the others xj are.
00:19:44.988 - 00:19:46.664, Speaker A: Just going to be equal to vj.
00:19:47.384 - 00:19:49.524, Speaker B: Per j equals to chi plus one.
00:19:50.304 - 00:19:56.016, Speaker A: Two n. So the idea of this, we call it the chart here.
00:19:56.040 - 00:19:59.844, Speaker B: So the application, the map.
00:20:02.824 - 00:20:03.256, Speaker C: Let me.
00:20:03.280 - 00:20:07.256, Speaker B: Write like Sigma K. It goes from.
00:20:07.280 - 00:20:07.844, Speaker A: UK.
00:20:09.824 - 00:20:13.984, Speaker B: To the rm with the composition.
00:20:18.884 - 00:20:20.028, Speaker A: Of sigma.
00:20:20.196 - 00:20:31.620, Speaker B: The blowing up with a local immersion. Let's call it Yk from Uk to.
00:20:31.652 - 00:20:36.860, Speaker A: M. And in particular, this application here is the first example. As we're gonna see.
00:20:36.892 - 00:20:40.896, Speaker B: There's going to be others, but the.
00:20:40.920 - 00:20:46.096, Speaker A: Composition of a blowing up with a local immersion, this is what we call a local blowing up.
00:20:46.240 - 00:20:49.284, Speaker B: Sigma K is a local.
00:20:53.944 - 00:21:14.614, Speaker A: Lineup. So just, just one, one thing if we want to. The idea here is that we are covering this projective space which we have priority. Let's say that we blow it up our true again. And we are covering it by two charts.
00:21:14.734 - 00:21:27.942, Speaker B: So one chart which exclude a point. So it's going to be in the U one chart we're going to have a point which is zero and a.
00:21:27.958 - 00:21:33.024, Speaker A: Point which is infinity which we are not seeing. So we are covering all other points. And in the other chart.
00:21:57.024 - 00:21:57.392, Speaker C: Going to.
00:21:57.408 - 00:22:00.976, Speaker A: Have two points that are going to convert onto the zero and plus infinity.
00:22:01.120 - 00:22:06.124, Speaker B: Of the U two chart.
00:22:09.304 - 00:22:11.764, Speaker A: Sorry, what did I do?
00:22:14.064 - 00:22:16.872, Speaker B: I think I'm so confused about the.
00:22:16.888 - 00:22:19.764, Speaker A: Fact that I was not able to change colors.
00:22:20.304 - 00:22:30.108, Speaker B: There was something that has no sense. Now this is going to play the.
00:22:30.116 - 00:22:32.464, Speaker A: Role of plus infinity in the U two chart.
00:22:33.964 - 00:22:34.932, Speaker C: And this is going to play the.
00:22:34.948 - 00:22:48.384, Speaker A: Role of zero in the U two chart. So like this, we cover the projected space by k local coordinates. And each one of them is going to be what we're going to call later on by local joins up.
00:22:51.744 - 00:22:52.080, Speaker C: Now.
00:22:52.112 - 00:22:52.964, Speaker A: Just a.
00:22:55.144 - 00:22:55.528, Speaker C: Comment.
00:22:55.576 - 00:22:58.184, Speaker A: It's going to be a comment because I'm not going to prove anything here.
00:22:58.304 - 00:23:03.924, Speaker B: Going up in general or general, sorry.
00:23:05.304 - 00:23:09.284, Speaker C: No, in general manifold.
00:23:10.064 - 00:23:26.744, Speaker A: So we are always going to be able to blow up a center which is in the class. So a sub variety supermanifold, sorry, of the class of the of the manifold. So let's just start by saying that q sub manifold.
00:23:30.844 - 00:23:33.104, Speaker B: C of M.
00:23:36.004 - 00:23:38.184, Speaker A: Is an embedded submanifold.
00:23:47.944 - 00:23:53.720, Speaker B: And search that for every a there.
00:23:53.752 - 00:24:02.764, Speaker A: Is a neighborhood, neighborhood u of a.
00:24:03.304 - 00:24:14.424, Speaker B: And functions f one fd. Can I do this?
00:24:15.084 - 00:24:21.144, Speaker A: Okay, it's a line. I have to do this again. F one fd which are in u.
00:24:21.964 - 00:24:25.500, Speaker B: Of u of a such that of.
00:24:25.532 - 00:24:35.124, Speaker A: Course c is going to be the zero locals of these functions. So write once again.
00:24:43.104 - 00:25:00.694, Speaker B: E inter u of a fd equals zero and the jacobian of f one f t is invertible.
00:25:07.234 - 00:25:08.454, Speaker A: Maximum rank.
00:25:16.194 - 00:25:24.494, Speaker B: Or maximum rank in u of a.
00:25:25.594 - 00:25:40.034, Speaker A: In particular, I recall that we had the inverse function theorem and the implicit function theorem in the class, so we could close it by the operation that are given by the implicit function theorem and inverse function theorem.
00:25:40.154 - 00:26:21.830, Speaker B: So we can always find local coordinate x equals to x on x n at a such that f I is equal to x I or I equals to one up until d. So this.
00:26:21.862 - 00:26:27.754, Speaker A: Center that we have here, we can always just look at it as in the first case, right?
00:26:28.334 - 00:26:30.914, Speaker B: Or the blowing up in r locally.
00:26:31.654 - 00:26:33.462, Speaker A: After a change of coordinates, after a.
00:26:33.478 - 00:26:42.504, Speaker B: Few change of coordinates, that is in the classroom.
00:26:48.714 - 00:26:51.414, Speaker A: And then given a general manifold.
00:26:56.994 - 00:26:57.282, Speaker C: We.
00:26:57.298 - 00:26:58.174, Speaker A: Can define.
00:27:01.794 - 00:27:13.710, Speaker B: The going up sigma m to the two m by a center.
00:27:13.742 - 00:27:14.314, Speaker A: C.
00:27:17.494 - 00:27:23.634, Speaker B: A center means q submanifold.
00:27:29.094 - 00:27:29.454, Speaker C: Of.
00:27:29.494 - 00:27:30.074, Speaker B: M.
00:27:31.974 - 00:27:55.592, Speaker A: Essentially by patching. So I'm not going to actually give the definition by. So I'm going to do this by patching together the local definitions that are the local construct. So if you want to see the.
00:27:55.608 - 00:27:59.484, Speaker B: Details, you can find the paper of.
00:28:11.964 - 00:28:13.596, Speaker A: Maybe if you put at least the.
00:28:13.620 - 00:28:14.184, Speaker B: Journal.
00:28:16.164 - 00:28:54.026, Speaker A: Because there are more than one paper here, paper publishing select. So it is possible to define what a global in app is in the food generator. But we can keep the idea that we're covering by this kind of chart, very simple algebraic charts, and that we are mostly working at our end up to making a change of coordinates. Now, one thing that I wanted to say connected to this is that the.
00:28:54.050 - 00:28:57.556, Speaker B: Pre image here, the e given by.
00:28:57.580 - 00:29:00.260, Speaker A: The prey image of the center, is.
00:29:00.292 - 00:29:04.144, Speaker B: Again the exceptional divisor of the map.
00:29:08.764 - 00:30:12.544, Speaker A: And we call it the exceptional divisor even if we blow up a center, which is actually a hyper surface. So this is not maybe compactable with what is the definition of an exceptional device in algebraic geometry, which is the set basically set where it's not local isomorphism. In this case it's going to, even if the set is a hyper, if the set is a hypersurface and then the blowing up section is almost everywhere. But it is arguably the right way to deal with in a resolution of similarities to even call in this case e as exceptional locals. This is just a convention and this brings me to talk about simple normal crossing dividers. So a simple, so e is the exceptional divisor. And we want to keep track when we do more than one blowing up of all of the divisors that are going to appear.
00:30:12.544 - 00:30:16.364, Speaker A: So a simple normal crossing divisor.
00:30:25.064 - 00:30:25.804, Speaker C: E.
00:30:26.584 - 00:30:44.904, Speaker B: Is an ordered collection, e one, two, c, a finite order collection such that where these eis.
00:30:47.004 - 00:30:48.700, Speaker A: Are iriducible, smooth divisor.
00:30:48.732 - 00:30:49.304, Speaker B: So.
00:30:58.644 - 00:31:08.724, Speaker A: At least for now, since we didn't define what irreduced or what our new sheets are going to be, we can just think as a q.
00:31:11.064 - 00:31:11.924, Speaker B: Soup.
00:31:13.424 - 00:31:25.088, Speaker A: Hyper surfaces with the notation that we just used before.
00:31:25.176 - 00:31:46.624, Speaker B: So manifold connected of dimension.
00:31:51.404 - 00:31:52.464, Speaker C: Minus one.
00:31:53.524 - 00:31:56.944, Speaker B: And if we take all of them.
00:31:58.424 - 00:31:59.964, Speaker A: They are normal crossings.
00:32:04.744 - 00:32:08.624, Speaker B: So that is for every a in.
00:32:08.664 - 00:32:11.924, Speaker A: E there exist coordinate systems.
00:32:18.264 - 00:32:19.164, Speaker C: U v.
00:32:20.344 - 00:32:30.766, Speaker B: U one, u r v one, versus such that all of these guys are.
00:32:30.790 - 00:32:33.246, Speaker A: Given by the zero locals of the.
00:32:33.270 - 00:32:40.994, Speaker B: Product of the Uis one to r. Just do like this.
00:32:41.854 - 00:32:43.286, Speaker A: So when all of them are equal.
00:32:43.310 - 00:32:44.034, Speaker B: To zero.
00:32:48.614 - 00:32:51.034, Speaker A: This is actually what going to do.
00:32:51.154 - 00:32:53.666, Speaker B: And then there's a notion of in.
00:32:53.690 - 00:33:01.574, Speaker A: Order to make things compatible with exceptional divisor. So there we define what a blowing up is. So a blowing up.
00:33:02.114 - 00:33:04.854, Speaker B: So given a little bit more space.
00:33:16.774 - 00:33:17.874, Speaker C: Going up.
00:33:23.734 - 00:33:24.994, Speaker A: Is compatible.
00:33:29.614 - 00:33:31.914, Speaker B: With a simple normal crossing divisor.
00:33:34.814 - 00:33:35.554, Speaker C: E.
00:33:38.014 - 00:33:42.474, Speaker A: If the center union with e has normal crossings.
00:33:49.014 - 00:33:49.662, Speaker B: I'm not going to.
00:33:49.678 - 00:33:59.194, Speaker A: Know exactly what it means, but what in, maybe I can just say without putting everything again in this cor, in the coordinate existence, that is.
00:34:02.974 - 00:34:03.622, Speaker B: For every.
00:34:03.678 - 00:34:10.884, Speaker A: I in e coordinate systems there exists, just as before.
00:34:13.944 - 00:34:21.464, Speaker B: Coordinate uv, such that the center.
00:34:21.504 - 00:34:27.084, Speaker A: Now besides this information is going to be given by some of the U's.
00:34:30.424 - 00:34:33.216, Speaker B: And let me put r prime and.
00:34:33.240 - 00:34:45.124, Speaker A: Sum of the v's. So essentially what you want to consider here is the situation that you have.
00:34:46.304 - 00:34:54.600, Speaker B: Some transverse crossing between the center and the exceptional locals. So it can be a curve like.
00:34:54.632 - 00:34:59.164, Speaker A: This that is cutting transversely. The situation, you want to exclude.
00:35:02.884 - 00:35:03.196, Speaker C: The.
00:35:03.220 - 00:35:04.904, Speaker A: Situation that you have a tangent.
00:35:09.764 - 00:35:15.864, Speaker B: Not normal crossings. Normal crossings please, for the tangents.
00:35:16.844 - 00:35:20.268, Speaker A: So we say that it's compatible with e. Sorry, sorry.
00:35:20.356 - 00:35:21.184, Speaker B: And I.
00:35:21.684 - 00:35:30.434, Speaker A: Yes, yes. So in this equation defining the center. Is it the same r prime for u and v?
00:35:31.814 - 00:35:35.394, Speaker B: No, no, no. Okay, sorry.
00:35:39.934 - 00:35:41.034, Speaker A: And I think.
00:35:49.214 - 00:35:49.590, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:35:49.622 - 00:36:00.004, Speaker E: I also have a small question and maybe I miss. Thank you. Maybe I misunderstand the definition, but c and e are in m basically, right?
00:36:00.164 - 00:36:00.904, Speaker B: Yes.
00:36:01.204 - 00:36:12.264, Speaker E: So the way it's written, what? It has nothing to do with the stigma. I don't really understand. Like you just wrote it.
00:36:13.724 - 00:36:17.984, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just saying that. So the blowing up is with center c?
00:36:18.364 - 00:36:19.624, Speaker B: I didn't say that.
00:36:20.564 - 00:36:34.764, Speaker E: Right. Okay, so just, you have a divisor on m, you have the center c, and any, and just if the divisor and e have this relationship, then any blow up with center c is compatible with e. That's what it means, right?
00:36:35.464 - 00:36:48.700, Speaker A: It means that any blowing up with a center with this condition. So in this case, for example, in the case in the left, it's going to be compatible, but in the case in the right, it's going to be not compatible. So it cannot blow up a center.
00:36:48.792 - 00:37:03.624, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. So the remark here is that if sigma from m tilde two m.
00:37:05.524 - 00:37:05.884, Speaker C: Is.
00:37:05.924 - 00:37:13.548, Speaker A: Compatible with e, simple normal crossing divisor.
00:37:13.596 - 00:37:16.484, Speaker C: In m, then.
00:37:18.624 - 00:37:20.232, Speaker A: The exceptional divider given.
00:37:20.288 - 00:37:25.120, Speaker B: By the prime image of e union.
00:37:25.152 - 00:37:34.604, Speaker A: With the pre image of c is also simple normal process. So in this setting we are going to use, and we will use the notation.
00:37:44.644 - 00:37:49.144, Speaker B: Sigma from m to the e t.
00:37:56.724 - 00:37:58.184, Speaker A: Notation that we're going to use.
00:38:00.004 - 00:38:05.508, Speaker B: Okay, so now after, after this first.
00:38:05.556 - 00:38:18.082, Speaker A: Part of the introduction, I just wanted to make an example of blowing up and a first example of a resolution, not exactly of a resolution of singularity, but a nice example of a blowing up of a surface that is actually going to play a role in the.
00:38:18.098 - 00:38:23.362, Speaker B: Second part of the course, today's course. And this is going to be an.
00:38:23.378 - 00:38:47.234, Speaker A: Example of your simon. So here is just the comment that we can maintain this couple by bringing up the centers which are not tangent to the exceptional divisor. So the example that I wanted to give you is an example from Gestalt Newman.
00:38:56.214 - 00:38:57.434, Speaker B: I think it's 90.
00:38:58.594 - 00:38:59.334, Speaker C: And.
00:39:01.634 - 00:39:08.294, Speaker A: We'Re going to come back with later on. And we're going to consider here the function f.
00:39:10.114 - 00:39:11.266, Speaker B: So m here is going.
00:39:11.290 - 00:39:12.614, Speaker A: To be r three.
00:39:18.114 - 00:39:18.898, Speaker C: And the function.
00:39:18.946 - 00:39:22.482, Speaker B: F of x y z is going.
00:39:22.498 - 00:39:24.226, Speaker A: To be given by z to the.
00:39:24.250 - 00:39:36.566, Speaker B: Third minus x c square yz minus x four. And x is going to be the.
00:39:36.590 - 00:39:38.034, Speaker A: Set of zeros of S.
00:39:39.814 - 00:39:40.662, Speaker B: And the.
00:39:40.678 - 00:39:44.062, Speaker A: Idea is to study this, the set via de boy.
00:39:44.078 - 00:39:46.874, Speaker B: Now this is the idea.
00:39:47.854 - 00:39:57.076, Speaker A: So the first thing I want to notice where the set is not going to be at least a priority. It's not going to be a hypersurface. So it's enough for us to consider.
00:39:57.140 - 00:39:59.844, Speaker B: The gradient of f. If the gradient.
00:39:59.884 - 00:40:06.828, Speaker A: Is nonzero, then we know that it's a hypersurface. So the gradient of it is going to give us, well, minus two x.
00:40:06.876 - 00:40:21.614, Speaker B: Y z minus four x, three minus x two z and then three z, two minus next to y.
00:40:22.354 - 00:40:26.474, Speaker A: And from this part here, we know that the gradient is going to be zero.
00:40:26.514 - 00:40:35.134, Speaker B: So gradient is zero if and only if. Well, first of all, xz is equal to zero.
00:40:35.674 - 00:40:40.894, Speaker A: And from the second part, sorry, not even.
00:40:46.094 - 00:40:47.274, Speaker B: We know that one.
00:40:54.854 - 00:40:55.462, Speaker C: That you.
00:40:55.518 - 00:41:02.030, Speaker A: Implies that x z has to be zero. And one therefore is going to imply that, well, if x is equal to.
00:41:02.062 - 00:41:06.366, Speaker B: Zero, sorry, if z is equal to.
00:41:06.390 - 00:41:29.282, Speaker A: Zero, if x is equal to zero.
00:41:29.338 - 00:41:32.534, Speaker B: Then by three.
00:41:36.734 - 00:41:38.234, Speaker A: Z is equal to zero.
00:41:40.614 - 00:41:42.514, Speaker B: And if z is equal to zero.
00:41:44.014 - 00:41:56.034, Speaker A: Then by one x is equal to zero. So we take from this that the curve of singularities of f, or better, the curve of points where the gradient is nonzero.
00:41:57.334 - 00:42:04.306, Speaker B: So gradient of f equals to zero is going to be given by x.
00:42:04.490 - 00:42:11.534, Speaker A: Equals z equals zero. So this is the natural center for us to blow up. So we consider.
00:42:15.594 - 00:42:19.682, Speaker B: C as zero locals of x z.
00:42:19.858 - 00:42:29.434, Speaker A: And we will make the blowing up, make a blowing.
00:42:31.214 - 00:42:37.514, Speaker B: Sigma with center c.
00:42:38.094 - 00:42:45.514, Speaker A: So we have two charts to consider. I will first consider here the chart, which is an interesting one. Interesting one is the x.
00:42:46.454 - 00:42:48.474, Speaker B: So let's consider the x chart.
00:42:49.814 - 00:42:55.524, Speaker A: So the x chart was that one that x would become an exceptional divisor. So in here, the.
00:42:57.664 - 00:42:58.232, Speaker B: Way that we're.
00:42:58.248 - 00:42:59.432, Speaker A: Going to notice x is going to.
00:42:59.448 - 00:43:02.456, Speaker B: Become the U. I will keep the.
00:43:02.480 - 00:43:06.584, Speaker A: Notation y since we didn't touch y and z now is going to become.
00:43:06.624 - 00:43:09.484, Speaker B: Of the form u times v.
00:43:11.424 - 00:43:11.712, Speaker C: So.
00:43:11.728 - 00:43:13.328, Speaker A: In this situation, when we make this.
00:43:13.416 - 00:43:19.392, Speaker B: Then the composition of f with sigma is now going to become u to.
00:43:19.408 - 00:43:27.688, Speaker A: The power three, v to the power.
00:43:27.736 - 00:43:33.364, Speaker B: Three minus y, v minus u.
00:43:34.584 - 00:43:37.724, Speaker A: And I want to just make an interpretation of what is going on here.
00:43:38.024 - 00:43:40.992, Speaker B: Following this, the set that is going.
00:43:41.008 - 00:43:49.172, Speaker A: To be given by the zero locus of this part. So here is the exception. Divider is what we accumulated as a monomial there. And here's the rest of it.
00:43:49.268 - 00:43:49.524, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:49.564 - 00:43:59.924, Speaker A: So we have a situation. We have an axis y. And if we take a y, which.
00:43:59.964 - 00:44:02.864, Speaker B: Is which one is.
00:44:03.564 - 00:44:06.260, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do. If we take y, which is bigger.
00:44:06.292 - 00:44:13.364, Speaker B: Than zero, then we have this equation here, v three minus yv.
00:44:16.544 - 00:44:17.408, Speaker C: Minus u.
00:44:17.496 - 00:44:20.976, Speaker A: Equal to zero with a fix at y.
00:44:21.120 - 00:44:24.600, Speaker B: And therefore, we get that u is.
00:44:24.632 - 00:44:34.080, Speaker A: Going to be given by v third minus y times z. And this guy has three real solutions.
00:44:34.192 - 00:44:39.028, Speaker B: It has v, v minus the square.
00:44:39.076 - 00:44:43.144, Speaker A: Root of y and v plus the square root.
00:44:45.924 - 00:44:52.756, Speaker B: Take the right one with the plus. Yeah, it's correct.
00:44:52.940 - 00:45:12.084, Speaker A: Minus plus the square root of y. So if we take a positive v here, what is going on is that I'm going to make here a little plane which corresponds to fixing y equals zero. There's going to be the u equals zero. We get given here, and then the rest is going to be, well, it's a polynomial with three solutions. So.
00:45:13.824 - 00:45:20.244, Speaker B: Cannot, so it's going to be polynomial like this.
00:45:21.104 - 00:45:22.480, Speaker A: On the other hand, if we take.
00:45:22.512 - 00:45:25.964, Speaker B: A y which is negative.
00:45:30.364 - 00:45:30.788, Speaker C: And we.
00:45:30.796 - 00:45:36.144, Speaker A: Do, again this game, u equals zero. So here was a positive y.
00:45:39.204 - 00:45:39.516, Speaker C: And.
00:45:39.540 - 00:45:42.332, Speaker B: Here is a negative y, then if.
00:45:42.348 - 00:45:50.104, Speaker A: We do the same game now, the difference is that we're not going to be able to take this square root. So we're going to have two of them, which are going to be.
00:45:52.004 - 00:45:53.024, Speaker B: Imaginary.
00:45:53.364 - 00:45:54.904, Speaker A: So what we are going to see.
00:45:56.064 - 00:46:05.684, Speaker B: Is simply, I have a hard time drawing this. Oops, just a cubic, but a cubic.
00:46:06.704 - 00:46:47.924, Speaker A: Inch in direction like this, we're gonna have something move like this, cutting. So there's going to be a difference on how we're going to see. So we're going to have this exceptional divisor there and how the set is going to work. So y equals zero is actually a special point. It's a special point where we have tangency between the. So we see that now we have something which is, which has gradient everywhere different from zero. But there's going to have some, some tangency between the variety now given by this part here equals to zero and an exceptional divisor, u equals zero.
00:46:47.924 - 00:46:50.836, Speaker A: So I'm not going to worry about this for now.
00:46:50.860 - 00:46:53.100, Speaker B: I'm just going to draw, not draw.
00:46:53.132 - 00:47:19.640, Speaker A: But just make an interpretation of what is going on here. It means that for y bigger than zero, certainly there is a singular point of the set after, before blowing up, because these three points are going to be joined into one. But the point that is here is less clear, right? Like indeed, if y is smaller than.
00:47:19.672 - 00:47:36.364, Speaker B: Zero, then v three minus yv minus u, satisfy the hypothesis.
00:47:40.884 - 00:47:41.660, Speaker C: Of the implicit.
00:47:41.692 - 00:47:48.464, Speaker B: Function here in respect to v.
00:48:01.404 - 00:48:01.716, Speaker C: So.
00:48:01.740 - 00:48:02.464, Speaker A: This means.
00:48:07.824 - 00:48:30.512, Speaker B: If there is a solution, the form v equals to u of u and y locally at the point.
00:48:30.648 - 00:48:33.024, Speaker A: Yeah, bigger than zero that we chose.
00:48:33.884 - 00:48:37.704, Speaker B: At this point here. Let's give it a name, b.
00:48:45.924 - 00:48:51.012, Speaker A: And moreover, by the implicit phi, still with the property coming from the equation itself.
00:48:51.108 - 00:48:58.524, Speaker B: And g of zero y is equal to zero.
00:49:00.064 - 00:49:11.872, Speaker A: So what I may make in this comment, I'm making this comment because now, if we define, if we take z equals, since g of zero y is equal to zero, we can write it.
00:49:11.888 - 00:49:12.444, Speaker B: As.
00:49:15.104 - 00:49:17.724, Speaker A: X times the two do xy.
00:49:18.664 - 00:49:26.014, Speaker B: And therefore we can take g z equals to d tilde of u.
00:49:30.354 - 00:49:31.094, Speaker C: Y.
00:49:31.634 - 00:49:54.180, Speaker B: Is a function we take here the function h given by z minus g cubed of u y, such that the.
00:49:54.212 - 00:49:58.184, Speaker A: Composition with the blowing up is going to be exactly.
00:49:58.684 - 00:50:00.228, Speaker C: Well, not exactly, because it's going to.
00:50:00.236 - 00:50:08.984, Speaker B: Be u u times v minus g of u y.
00:50:09.804 - 00:50:10.956, Speaker A: So what we are saying is that.
00:50:10.980 - 00:50:13.876, Speaker B: The set x that we have blow it up.
00:50:13.900 - 00:50:17.204, Speaker A: And we saw here the setup priority.
00:50:17.704 - 00:50:21.616, Speaker B: Is locally given over this point as.
00:50:21.640 - 00:50:32.924, Speaker A: Something that is moved. It's given by z minus this g tilde. So after blowing up, we're gonna have this complicated set.
00:50:36.584 - 00:50:37.536, Speaker B: We are gonna have the.
00:50:37.560 - 00:50:56.974, Speaker A: .0 and all of the points where y is, is actually smaller than zero. The set is going to be smooth. Well, for points which are actually bigger than zero, then the set actually is, that is going to have these three lines, this cubic, that is going to contract to a point.
00:50:57.094 - 00:51:01.154, Speaker B: So actually you're going to have situation like this.
00:51:03.934 - 00:51:04.646, Speaker C: Oops.
00:51:04.750 - 00:51:07.114, Speaker B: This is not exactly what.
00:51:18.074 - 00:51:24.634, Speaker A: So this part here is going to be smooth and that part is not going to be. So I'm going to keep this example for later on, because it's an example.
00:51:24.674 - 00:51:28.554, Speaker B: Where the algebraic structure that is coming.
00:51:28.594 - 00:51:43.556, Speaker A: From the f equals zero, it does not capture the points where the set is not smooth. And this, we can see it after blowing up. So we made it blowing up. We made the interpretation of what happened after blowing up. We see that it's beams move for y smaller than zero, and moreover, that.
00:51:43.580 - 00:51:45.668, Speaker B: It can be blow down for something.
00:51:45.716 - 00:51:47.824, Speaker A: Which is moved before the blowing up.
00:51:51.524 - 00:51:57.464, Speaker B: Keep the big 1.0.
00:52:02.784 - 00:52:04.640, Speaker A: So this example is going to play.
00:52:04.672 - 00:52:06.616, Speaker B: A role in what I'm going to.
00:52:06.640 - 00:52:18.176, Speaker A: Start talking now, which is the notion of ideal shifts and the notion of privilege ideal achieve. So let me give you a couple of definitions. The first one is.
00:52:18.360 - 00:52:22.004, Speaker D: Andres, I'm sorry to slow you down a little bit.
00:52:22.384 - 00:52:23.248, Speaker B: No, go ahead.
00:52:23.296 - 00:52:36.614, Speaker D: I'm not sure about the morale of the story you just told us. Are you telling us that the set at y negative was smooth to begin with?
00:52:36.954 - 00:52:38.654, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
00:52:39.514 - 00:52:48.178, Speaker D: And why did we want to, why did we do all of this? Because it wasn't clear from the equation. It wasn't clear from the gradient exactly.
00:52:48.306 - 00:52:58.032, Speaker A: If you take the gradient. Yeah, that's the morale. Indeed. So if you take the gradient, we're going to see that what we get is x z zero. So these are the points where f is of order two.
00:52:58.168 - 00:53:03.712, Speaker D: So this is the candidates for this. So these are the candidates for the singularity. But we are not sure that they.
00:53:03.728 - 00:53:05.896, Speaker B: Are singular points of the set.
00:53:05.960 - 00:53:25.254, Speaker A: No, because the set, it might admit another local equation where it's a hypersurface. And then we made the blowing up and we verify that over the points where y is smaller than zero. Then we do have local coordinates that does, that do give us something which is smooth.
00:53:26.794 - 00:53:29.414, Speaker D: This is really real geometry.
00:53:30.154 - 00:53:31.082, Speaker B: Okay. Right.
00:53:31.138 - 00:53:38.458, Speaker D: So this is what I never had to wonder about such questions until now because the gradient was enough.
00:53:38.506 - 00:53:38.690, Speaker C: But.
00:53:38.722 - 00:53:39.922, Speaker D: Okay, I see now that.
00:53:40.058 - 00:53:41.586, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah.
00:53:41.610 - 00:53:50.144, Speaker A: So, yeah, so that's the moral. So I'm gonna keep. This is going to be a good example to see some of the pathologies that can occur in the real case.
00:53:50.884 - 00:53:51.944, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:53:54.964 - 00:53:56.732, Speaker A: So, to give the definition, what we're.
00:53:56.748 - 00:54:00.384, Speaker B: Going to talk about now, set.
00:54:07.564 - 00:54:07.876, Speaker C: A.
00:54:07.900 - 00:54:25.484, Speaker B: Set x in a is a q set, so called quad analytic set. If for every point a in x there exists a neighborhood u of a of a.
00:54:27.464 - 00:54:29.964, Speaker A: Such endogs and functions.
00:54:35.304 - 00:54:35.616, Speaker C: And.
00:54:35.640 - 00:54:36.644, Speaker B: A collection.
00:54:41.404 - 00:54:43.676, Speaker A: F alpha, u alpha in.
00:54:43.700 - 00:54:58.596, Speaker B: Some index set a of few functions in this open set such that the intersection of x with this neighborhood is.
00:54:58.620 - 00:55:25.664, Speaker A: Given by the zero locals of this collection. This is what we're going to mean by a queue set. Now, since we have this, this idea of passing through a collection of functions, it is natural to work with the notion of ideal.
00:55:25.704 - 00:55:31.084, Speaker B: So we consider from now on.
00:55:32.924 - 00:55:33.420, Speaker A: Ideal.
00:55:33.452 - 00:55:45.544, Speaker B: Sheets I over m. That is.
00:55:47.524 - 00:55:47.836, Speaker C: A.
00:55:47.860 - 00:55:48.424, Speaker A: Given.
00:55:52.804 - 00:56:08.904, Speaker B: For every open state u of m, a of an ideal u of.
00:56:08.944 - 00:56:19.124, Speaker A: Q, we specify all the sheep conditions. So, Luin, restriction, etcetera. And we're going to denote.
00:56:25.204 - 00:56:32.584, Speaker B: The germs of I at a.
00:56:33.884 - 00:56:46.024, Speaker A: And without giving a, I made an example. So, without taking much longer, I just want to give you the property that we're going to study in the next.
00:56:47.364 - 00:56:52.304, Speaker B: Ten to 15 minutes, which is the following.
00:56:53.964 - 00:56:55.264, Speaker A: An ideal sheath.
00:57:00.604 - 00:57:12.524, Speaker B: I is privileged. If for every a and m there.
00:57:12.564 - 00:57:15.464, Speaker A: Exists a neighborhood u of a.
00:57:17.964 - 00:57:18.984, Speaker B: Such that.
00:57:25.044 - 00:57:27.452, Speaker A: And the idea over u admits a.
00:57:27.468 - 00:57:34.220, Speaker B: Collection is generated by a collection of.
00:57:34.252 - 00:57:41.604, Speaker A: Functions globally defining u. And this implies that for every bag.
00:57:44.134 - 00:58:15.534, Speaker B: Do the opposite like this, then.
00:58:19.514 - 00:58:19.874, Speaker C: The.
00:58:19.914 - 00:58:22.690, Speaker B: Germs at b are just going to.
00:58:22.722 - 00:58:25.730, Speaker A: Be given by all of these functions.
00:58:25.882 - 00:58:42.992, Speaker B: F alpha, their germ at b for all alpha in this a, and for all b in the open set so it means that you actually have functions.
00:58:43.048 - 00:58:48.164, Speaker A: Which generate over the open set all of the germs of this open set.
00:58:48.784 - 00:58:49.792, Speaker B: So this is what we're going to.
00:58:49.808 - 00:59:12.250, Speaker A: Call privileged if the rings are noetherium. So in the case of an analytic, we normally don't talk about privilege, which we talk, we talk directly about finite type ideals, because then this index set that we're taking here to make it compatible before the index set is going to be finite. But here we're not asking anything about this index set.
00:59:12.282 - 00:59:15.530, Speaker B: It's just going to be just an index.
00:59:15.602 - 00:59:48.594, Speaker A: We're just asking, actually, the only thing that we're asking is that these functions are global over u. And in this case, if you have a privileged ideal shift, then you can define the zero locus and the zero locus of a privileged idea, which are going to be simply the points a.
00:59:49.094 - 00:59:59.774, Speaker B: In m such that f of a equals to zero for all f in a I of a is a q set.
01:00:06.354 - 01:00:32.256, Speaker A: So in this case it becomes clear, because for every point you're going to have an open set and then you have this collection. And therefore we have this set, even by the zero locals is actually going to be a few sets almost by definition. By definition. But this is actually normally going to be actually a necessary condition for it to be a q set. So let's see a couple of examples. Well, we're going to see that locally it's not going to be the case.
01:00:32.280 - 01:00:36.424, Speaker D: But can you raise the, can you lower the board for just a second?
01:00:36.464 - 01:00:37.124, Speaker C: Okay.
01:00:38.464 - 01:00:39.764, Speaker D: Just for the remote.
01:00:41.144 - 01:00:42.600, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to like this.
01:00:42.672 - 01:00:50.804, Speaker B: So let's make a couple of examples of non privileged sets, or at least.
01:00:51.184 - 01:00:52.004, Speaker C: Sorry.
01:00:57.144 - 01:00:58.124, Speaker B: My first.
01:01:01.624 - 01:01:19.684, Speaker A: Because we would like to have, we have, in one direction, if the idea is privileged, then we have a two set, and we would like to attach to every you set an ideal. And if we can, something which is privileged itself. So here there's an idea.
01:01:19.804 - 01:01:27.944, Speaker B: Where is it? The second remark is, given.
01:01:30.564 - 01:01:36.344, Speaker A: Acute settings, we may consider the structure shift.
01:01:51.374 - 01:01:51.686, Speaker C: Which.
01:01:51.710 - 01:01:52.634, Speaker A: We'Re going to call.
01:01:57.614 - 01:02:02.514, Speaker B: Root x, given by.
01:02:05.134 - 01:02:39.582, Speaker A: So the germs of it are simply going to be all of the functions, such that these functions are zero over the set. So given a q set, we may consider this ideal sheet here. Now I want to argue with you that this is not in the complex geometry case. This is going to be a coherent ideal shift in particular privilege. But in the set that we are here, it's not going to give us something which is privileged usually. And there are two examples that we.
01:02:39.598 - 01:02:43.194, Speaker B: Can see that the first one, the Whitney umbrella.
01:02:47.174 - 01:02:50.394, Speaker A: There are more than two examples, but a few simple ones.
01:02:54.914 - 01:02:59.174, Speaker B: X square minus z minus the square.
01:03:08.354 - 01:03:17.254, Speaker A: And in here, this function f is irreducible. We cannot do it better in here. So the ideal sheath, the structural ideal sheath at zero.
01:03:20.654 - 01:03:21.342, Speaker B: Is going to be.
01:03:21.358 - 01:03:22.474, Speaker A: Given by this f.
01:03:25.854 - 01:03:26.446, Speaker B: But if we.
01:03:26.470 - 01:03:29.394, Speaker A: Take some point here with z, zero.
01:03:30.454 - 01:03:33.630, Speaker B: Is smaller than zero, then the ideal.
01:03:33.662 - 01:03:36.554, Speaker A: Sheet at this point, the structural ideal sheath of this point.
01:03:39.574 - 01:03:40.302, Speaker C: Is actually going.
01:03:40.318 - 01:03:47.774, Speaker A: To be given by x and y. It's actually given by x squared minus y plus y squared.
01:03:47.814 - 01:03:48.030, Speaker B: Sorry.
01:03:48.062 - 01:03:50.358, Speaker A: So here I would like that to be negative.
01:03:50.406 - 01:03:50.938, Speaker B: Yes.
01:03:51.086 - 01:03:54.774, Speaker A: So that this becomes x squared plus y squared.
01:03:55.594 - 01:03:56.690, Speaker B: So it's actually going to be given.
01:03:56.722 - 01:04:21.564, Speaker A: By x and y. So we see that at every point that z is smaller than zero, we need two functions to generate the ideal. But at z equals to zero, we only have one function. So this is the case that there's not going to be an open set around zero where I can generate all of the points in this part of the set with just the function f. And we'll not be able to generate x nor y with this construction with just a function f.
01:04:23.544 - 01:04:28.484, Speaker B: So ex is not privileged.
01:04:34.144 - 01:04:38.584, Speaker A: And example two, because this example might tell you that, okay, so there's a change of dimension.
01:04:38.664 - 01:04:41.512, Speaker B: So this might make a difference.
01:04:41.568 - 01:04:44.164, Speaker A: But if we take the Beardstone and Newman example.
01:04:46.294 - 01:04:57.910, Speaker B: Let me just go now. I of x is also not coherent.
01:04:57.982 - 01:04:59.394, Speaker A: Is not privileged.
01:05:04.774 - 01:05:05.806, Speaker B: Because I recall that.
01:05:05.830 - 01:05:08.166, Speaker A: We had this strange kind of looking.
01:05:08.230 - 01:05:25.258, Speaker B: Surface that in one part of it, at this form, and in the other.
01:05:25.306 - 01:05:32.026, Speaker A: Part where this move, and we had the function f here equals zero.
01:05:32.170 - 01:05:43.194, Speaker B: But at this point, it was this move, but the gradient was equal to zero.
01:05:44.014 - 01:05:52.914, Speaker A: So at this point that are here. So I at zero was generated by f, which was irreducible.
01:05:53.214 - 01:06:13.114, Speaker B: But if we took I zero, y zero, zero with I zero negative, this was given by that v minus j tilde. Yes, of x, y, which are not the same functions.
01:06:18.894 - 01:06:22.022, Speaker A: It's not privileged neither. And this is going to play a.
01:06:22.038 - 01:06:24.278, Speaker B: Role a little bit later.
01:06:24.406 - 01:06:49.642, Speaker A: Once again. Okay, so the structural sheath is not necessarily like, which is coming in complex geometry works very well because of the locker. But in this case here, it's not working so well. So we can actually ask for something a little bit less. We don't need maximality. We don't need to take all of the functions which are zero of the set. We just need some functions which are.
01:06:49.658 - 01:06:50.774, Speaker B: Zero of the set.
01:06:53.254 - 01:06:54.314, Speaker A: So the question.
01:06:57.974 - 01:06:59.566, Speaker B: For the next couple.
01:06:59.590 - 01:07:06.194, Speaker A: Of moments is, for every q set.
01:07:06.934 - 01:07:07.674, Speaker B: X.
01:07:09.614 - 01:07:10.674, Speaker A: Is it possible.
01:07:14.534 - 01:07:38.210, Speaker B: To find idea achieve I such that z of I.
01:07:38.402 - 01:07:53.240, Speaker A: Is equal to x. So not necessarily the structure ideal, not necessarily this one. We saw that it's not possible. But for example, for the Whitney umbrella, we can, at least locally, right, we can just take the idea generated by f in this open set. It's not going to be the structural.
01:07:53.272 - 01:07:57.640, Speaker B: Idea at this point, but it works perfectly fine.
01:07:57.752 - 01:08:16.840, Speaker A: It's just unprivileged ideal sheet. Because if you just take the ideal sheath, where at every point it's just the function f, this is going to be privileged the same way in the second example, if we just take the function f and we take the ideal sheet generated by f at every point, this again is going to be privileged.
01:08:16.992 - 01:08:17.872, Speaker C: Just by the definition.
01:08:17.928 - 01:08:34.324, Speaker A: Because for the open set, I just have this function defined globally, which generate the idea at every point. So this leads to this question and the previous remark that we just did for these two examples is that locally you can always. So locally it's possible.
01:08:40.704 - 01:08:43.904, Speaker B: So, yes, local, yes.
01:08:58.364 - 01:09:01.060, Speaker A: Because if you take the definition again.
01:09:01.132 - 01:09:03.716, Speaker B: Of what is going to be a.
01:09:03.740 - 01:09:48.494, Speaker A: Q set for every point, we might take the neighborhood and we might consider the ideal given by all of these functions, f I as alpha, defined on the, on this neighborhood. So we're going to find a neighbor and an ideal sheath defined that neighborhood given by global functions, which we have this property. And therefore, it's going to be privileged at that open neighborhood by definition, almost by definition, by construction. Why did it locally figure? Having issues with my, my doctor that.
01:09:48.654 - 01:09:52.834, Speaker B: Yeah, but globally, the answer is no.
01:09:57.694 - 01:10:17.734, Speaker A: So there are some very nice examples of carton here that go back to Kartha, which are global in RN. So I just want to cite, if you are interested in these kind of examples, several of them in a book.
01:10:29.374 - 01:10:37.754, Speaker B: Introduction to the theory of analytic spaces.
01:10:41.654 - 01:11:13.974, Speaker A: And these are very nice examples because they are globally defined on RN. It's even compact in RN. There's examples of that, there's examples of several pathologies. But when I was preparing the talk today, they are not completely clear that they are not privileged at a first regard, and it's necessary to use some lemmas to prove it. So instead of doing these examples, I'm going to give you just an idea of an example which is going to be over an abstract manifold in the sense that we're going to glue the two charts.
01:11:14.474 - 01:11:15.602, Speaker B: So it's not going to be something.
01:11:15.658 - 01:11:37.326, Speaker A: Which is in our end a priority. So that's the disadvantage compared to the example that are coming from here. But on the other hand, at the other hand, it's going to be easy to see that it's not, cannot be privileged, right? So the idea is to. So I'm just going to give the idea. So the idea is to glue the example of gearstone millman. So do again the drawing.
01:11:37.470 - 01:11:40.622, Speaker B: So we have this y here and.
01:11:40.638 - 01:11:41.634, Speaker A: We have the part.
01:11:52.114 - 01:11:52.834, Speaker C: Right.
01:11:52.994 - 01:11:57.762, Speaker A: Becomes a move later on, we're going to glue this example coming from bierstein.
01:11:57.778 - 01:12:09.574, Speaker B: And newman with another chart. See if I can do this. I wanted to use closing.
01:12:10.154 - 01:12:11.442, Speaker A: So I'm going to take some open.
01:12:11.498 - 01:12:27.864, Speaker B: Set sufficiently small and we're going to glue it. Oh, wow, it makes a big difference with another one.
01:12:36.524 - 01:12:41.612, Speaker A: Open statue one with another set to two. And we're going to glue it by.
01:12:41.628 - 01:12:47.436, Speaker B: A rule that over the going part, we're just going to take z two.
01:12:47.580 - 01:13:12.132, Speaker A: Equals to that z minus g of xy. So now the set x equals to zero in the new chart is just going to be z tilde equals to zero. So we are able to do that because in this chart we have this, this way to transform it. And the other coordinates we're gonna take just x tilde equals to x minus.
01:13:12.188 - 01:13:17.184, Speaker B: Sine of one over y minus delta.
01:13:17.644 - 01:13:19.384, Speaker A: And y tilde equals to y.
01:13:21.244 - 01:13:21.556, Speaker C: In.
01:13:21.580 - 01:13:31.420, Speaker A: Such a way that this delta is sufficiently big so that the transition over the. So that the transition is analytic delta.
01:13:31.452 - 01:13:32.024, Speaker B: Big.
01:13:35.384 - 01:13:36.804, Speaker A: So that the transitions.
01:13:47.384 - 01:13:48.364, Speaker B: Analytic.
01:13:49.304 - 01:13:54.616, Speaker A: But now the remark that we can make is that the curve given by.
01:13:54.640 - 01:13:59.416, Speaker B: The order true locals of f is.
01:13:59.440 - 01:14:08.474, Speaker A: Something that depends on the algebraic structure that we have given. So if we take the ideal sheath generated by f here, and we say, okay, we're just going to extend it.
01:14:08.934 - 01:14:10.790, Speaker B: To the left part, to the blue.
01:14:10.822 - 01:14:19.594, Speaker A: Part, then the curve given by x equals z equals zero needs to be continued. It's going to admit an analytic continuation to the other part.
01:14:21.574 - 01:14:24.782, Speaker B: And in here, the thing that might.
01:14:24.838 - 01:14:26.326, Speaker A: Happen, that might happen, or that is.
01:14:26.350 - 01:14:32.644, Speaker B: Going to happen, is that the curve that is, of course, no, didn't work.
01:14:35.064 - 01:14:39.964, Speaker A: Why is it not working today? Okay, there's something going on in my.
01:14:40.584 - 01:14:48.564, Speaker B: Okay, the point is that after this transition, the curve that was completely smooth.
01:14:49.744 - 01:15:28.056, Speaker A: After it's going to be a synod of one over x and choosing delta, we're going to guess that it's transcendent. So we're not going to be able to extend the ideal sheet given by f equals zero in the first chart to the second chart in a way that doesn't, that is not transcendental. So this set here is going to give us something that globally, so locally it will admit, because locally is just set, tilde equals zero, and in the other chart is just f equals zero. But globally, we are not going to be able to have privileged ideal sheets.
01:15:28.160 - 01:15:43.884, Speaker B: That gives us the set. Okay, in the polynomial setting, in the polynomial algebraic setting, are all ideals privileged or not?
01:15:45.224 - 01:15:48.428, Speaker A: In the algebraic case, normally, no.
01:15:48.556 - 01:15:48.836, Speaker C: Yes.
01:15:48.860 - 01:15:50.508, Speaker A: Yeah, you can make it in.
01:15:50.676 - 01:15:51.172, Speaker B: Okay.
01:15:51.228 - 01:15:51.596, Speaker C: Okay.
01:15:51.660 - 01:15:52.468, Speaker A: They're finite hype.
01:15:52.476 - 01:15:53.604, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
01:15:53.684 - 01:16:00.084, Speaker A: Usually the, usually people even work in the projected space directly, so that then. Yeah, yeah.
01:16:00.124 - 01:16:00.824, Speaker B: Okay.
01:16:07.844 - 01:16:08.624, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:16:10.684 - 01:16:11.052, Speaker B: Okay.
01:16:11.068 - 01:16:19.084, Speaker A: So let's now get to the first statement, almost the first statement. Now I just want to make all of the things that we said.
01:16:21.504 - 01:16:21.792, Speaker C: The.
01:16:21.808 - 01:16:35.136, Speaker A: Last parts of what we said, the definitions of what we want to, want to obtain. So putting everything together. So now given less definitions before we start proving things, well, before we state.
01:16:35.160 - 01:16:42.744, Speaker B: A theorem, then we start proving things later on. So I'm giving a.
01:16:46.844 - 01:16:47.944, Speaker A: Blowing up.
01:16:56.124 - 01:16:56.436, Speaker C: And.
01:16:56.460 - 01:16:57.384, Speaker B: A privileged.
01:17:02.804 - 01:17:04.024, Speaker A: Ideal sheath.
01:17:05.904 - 01:17:11.004, Speaker B: I in m. The total transform.
01:17:21.784 - 01:17:23.248, Speaker A: Like this, for notation.
01:17:23.376 - 01:17:24.324, Speaker B: Purposes.
01:17:26.784 - 01:17:28.244, Speaker A: Is the ideal sheath.
01:17:48.604 - 01:17:51.012, Speaker B: Even by.
01:17:51.148 - 01:17:54.024, Speaker A: Is generated from this.
01:17:56.104 - 01:18:10.312, Speaker C: Generator by f.
01:18:10.448 - 01:18:14.608, Speaker B: Composite with, with sigma for all.
01:18:14.656 - 01:18:15.244, Speaker C: F.
01:18:21.344 - 01:18:33.394, Speaker B: Will stop at a point at b, is generated by, for all functions f. In the ideal of signal b.
01:18:35.134 - 01:18:42.114, Speaker A: So just the pullback. You pull back all of the functions that were in the image of that point b that we're considering.
01:18:45.814 - 01:18:49.662, Speaker B: And our objective was always to make.
01:18:49.678 - 01:18:51.434, Speaker A: These functions become monomial.
01:18:51.814 - 01:19:01.754, Speaker B: So given m and a simple normal crossing divisor, e in m.
01:19:03.774 - 01:19:11.714, Speaker A: I is monomial. If for every point.
01:19:14.414 - 01:19:15.158, Speaker C: There exists a.
01:19:15.166 - 01:19:16.034, Speaker A: Neighborhood.
01:19:48.934 - 01:19:54.834, Speaker B: V adopted to e.
01:19:57.614 - 01:19:58.634, Speaker C: Such that.
01:20:00.454 - 01:20:23.944, Speaker B: The idea I a is just given by u alpha, that means u one alpha one un alpha n. Sorry. Alpha R, where the alpha belongs, is a multi index. Here.
01:20:26.564 - 01:20:35.024, Speaker A: This is what is going to be b one. Now we follow the results that are developed in the finish.
01:20:35.404 - 01:20:37.498, Speaker D: Sorry, once again, Andrew.
01:20:37.656 - 01:20:38.674, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
01:20:40.654 - 01:20:48.274, Speaker D: In the previous definition of the total transform, I have a hard time understanding who lives where.
01:20:52.374 - 01:20:54.314, Speaker A: So with this talk.
01:20:56.214 - 01:20:58.006, Speaker B: At b in.
01:20:58.030 - 01:21:01.118, Speaker A: Ma, Tilde is generated by.
01:21:01.206 - 01:21:03.554, Speaker D: Okay, I thought b was in m. Okay.
01:21:04.154 - 01:21:06.466, Speaker B: Yes. Ah, okay.
01:21:06.570 - 01:21:07.894, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry about that.
01:21:08.234 - 01:21:08.874, Speaker D: No, it's.
01:21:08.954 - 01:21:40.628, Speaker A: We send it, we send it down. So now this is the objective. When, when I talk about the rough statement of resolution of similarities, our objective was always to pull back an ideal so that it would become not an ideal. We started with just a function so that it would become unknown. So now we are ready to make the statement, which I'm going to do in the next part, so that we have a complete statement in just one page of the global resolution of similarities.
01:21:40.676 - 01:21:41.584, Speaker B: In this case.
01:22:01.064 - 01:22:07.760, Speaker A: Actually, let's look at credit, where credit.
01:22:07.792 - 01:22:19.760, Speaker B: Is due, also 2004 and Bierce valet in 2013.
01:22:19.912 - 01:22:22.680, Speaker A: That's when they found their formulation with.
01:22:22.752 - 01:22:29.354, Speaker B: The privileged and not finite type. Say the following.
01:22:31.094 - 01:22:32.542, Speaker A: Let's do the complete thing.
01:22:32.598 - 01:22:33.434, Speaker B: Let m.
01:22:35.374 - 01:22:37.274, Speaker A: Be a key manifold.
01:22:40.294 - 01:22:41.034, Speaker C: E.
01:22:42.574 - 01:22:44.674, Speaker A: A simple normal crossing divisor.
01:22:47.814 - 01:22:52.254, Speaker B: And I a privileged ideal shape.
01:22:57.994 - 01:23:07.494, Speaker A: Now there's a technicality when we work outside of the generic category that we should restrict ourselves to relatively complex. So we're going to say that. So for every.
01:23:11.514 - 01:23:23.834, Speaker B: Relatively compact open set and zero, again.
01:23:26.094 - 01:23:26.834, Speaker A: Let.
01:23:29.334 - 01:23:34.214, Speaker B: E zero be the e intersected with m zero, I.
01:23:34.254 - 01:23:35.194, Speaker A: Zero, b.
01:23:37.894 - 01:23:38.794, Speaker C: Oops.
01:23:40.794 - 01:23:42.650, Speaker A: The ideal sheath at.
01:23:42.682 - 01:23:43.454, Speaker B: M zero.
01:23:45.714 - 01:23:47.934, Speaker A: The restricted ideal sheet at m zero.
01:23:48.514 - 01:23:57.814, Speaker B: And now the statement is there exists a sequence.
01:24:00.794 - 01:24:02.974, Speaker A: Of adapt of compatible.
01:24:34.474 - 01:24:34.834, Speaker C: M.
01:24:34.874 - 01:24:38.094, Speaker A: C minus one, c minus one.
01:24:39.834 - 01:24:40.170, Speaker C: Up.
01:24:40.202 - 01:25:02.514, Speaker B: Until m zero is zero. Touch that if we denote by sigma decomposition. So here's going to be sigma one.
01:25:03.294 - 01:25:04.914, Speaker A: Composed with sigma t.
01:25:07.414 - 01:25:12.114, Speaker B: The pullback of I is monom.
01:25:25.194 - 01:25:50.334, Speaker A: And just a quick example of why we need to restrict relatively compact sets. It's going to be more or less clear. If we take the ideal I in r two, y squared minus sine of x squared, then this ideal, you cannot minimize it by a finite number of at least connected center with connected blowing up of connected centers.
01:25:51.274 - 01:25:55.266, Speaker B: So it's going to be quite simple to principalize.
01:25:55.290 - 01:26:21.354, Speaker A: It's just going to be the sinoid function several times. So in this case, you're going to need to restrict to complex sets so that you have a finite number of lines up. Else we can, it is too possible to get to give a, possible to give any statement which is global. And we're going to talk about this later on.
01:26:21.654 - 01:26:26.806, Speaker B: But it's almost enough to restrict for.
01:26:26.830 - 01:26:31.154, Speaker A: The purposes of a relatively complex at this time.
01:26:33.214 - 01:26:39.510, Speaker B: This is the first statement. And here I just want to note.
01:26:39.542 - 01:27:02.434, Speaker A: That the privilege assumption here is what brings up the valet to the, to the theorem. So in the first part here, the ideal shift was supposed to be a finite type, such as in the algebraic analytic case, but it can be done in the privileged case also, as we remarked in 2013.
01:27:08.054 - 01:27:08.794, Speaker B: Now.
01:27:10.764 - 01:27:14.316, Speaker A: That we've seen the global version of the theorem, I actually want to.
01:27:14.340 - 01:27:17.244, Speaker B: Talk a little bit about the local version.
01:27:17.284 - 01:27:21.820, Speaker A: So there was three techniques that we wanted to talk about.
01:27:21.972 - 01:27:24.332, Speaker B: This is the first one, and I.
01:27:24.348 - 01:27:44.044, Speaker A: Actually want to state the second one before I start making applications. So I think that the goal is going to make actually to state the second one. And this is finishing this part, and I'm going to now start talking about local resolution.
01:27:54.784 - 01:27:55.656, Speaker B: Which is going to be.
01:27:55.680 - 01:28:24.354, Speaker A: More adapted to when we talk about sets, and especially to queue sub analytic sets, we're going to see exactly, because we cannot always assume that things are privileged. So here we start by saying what a local growing up is. We already seen the typical example. So a compatible local growing up.
01:28:46.354 - 01:28:46.690, Speaker C: From.
01:28:46.722 - 01:28:55.434, Speaker B: Uchihuga to M E is the composition.
01:29:00.774 - 01:29:01.834, Speaker A: Going up.
01:29:08.134 - 01:29:09.194, Speaker C: With a local.
01:29:25.114 - 01:29:29.774, Speaker B: Proper and say proper.
01:29:36.794 - 01:29:46.528, Speaker A: We need a second definition before defining what is going to be the local resolution. But I anticipate, because I see that I won't have time to, to state everything.
01:29:46.576 - 01:29:52.684, Speaker B: And I actually wanted to prove our results today in the last ten minutes.
01:29:53.104 - 01:30:20.724, Speaker A: Which is going to be connectively proper and semi proper. But the local resolution of singularity is basically going to tell us that there is this a sequence of local blowing up, or several sequences of local blowing up, where the pullback of the idea is going to be monomial. But we need some sort of condition so that we cover all of M. And this is going to be the condition given by this proper and semi proper amorphism. So I recall that amorphism.
01:30:27.624 - 01:30:36.144, Speaker B: Phi of n to m is proper if for.
01:30:36.184 - 01:30:37.484, Speaker A: Every complex set.
01:30:42.124 - 01:30:45.556, Speaker B: K of m, the.
01:30:45.580 - 01:30:46.784, Speaker A: Prime image of k.
01:30:48.524 - 01:30:49.624, Speaker B: Is compact.
01:30:53.044 - 01:30:53.332, Speaker C: And.
01:30:53.348 - 01:31:00.364, Speaker B: The morph is semi proper if for.
01:31:00.404 - 01:31:01.664, Speaker A: Every compact set.
01:31:05.424 - 01:31:08.296, Speaker B: A in M there.
01:31:08.320 - 01:31:09.804, Speaker A: Exist compact sets.
01:31:15.464 - 01:31:25.564, Speaker B: L in n such that p of L is equal to k.
01:31:28.424 - 01:31:29.760, Speaker A: And the idea is really that.
01:31:29.832 - 01:31:33.964, Speaker B: You are able to over all of n.
01:31:36.224 - 01:31:50.964, Speaker A: By complex x like this. So actually, I want the statement, but the result that I would like to just give and then discuss in the last part of the.
01:31:52.664 - 01:31:53.404, Speaker B: Talk.
01:31:55.344 - 01:31:55.936, Speaker C: The following.
01:31:56.000 - 01:32:01.804, Speaker B: Lemma let fee from m to m.
01:32:04.624 - 01:32:06.564, Speaker A: Be a semi proper morphism.
01:32:14.984 - 01:32:23.664, Speaker B: There exists a generic submersion. Yeah.
01:32:30.764 - 01:32:37.172, Speaker A: Sorry, Henri, can I interrupt you again? Yes, of course. So in your definition of proper and.
01:32:37.188 - 01:32:41.304, Speaker B: Semi proper morphism, so for you, what is exactly a morphism?
01:32:42.324 - 01:33:06.488, Speaker A: Ah, yeah, that's true. It's just, it's going to be here, acumorphism. So in the quad analytic category, so it means we have. So these are m and n are going to be q manifolds. So we have atlas, which are q. So it is enough to say what a Q morph is at open sets.
01:33:06.616 - 01:33:07.072, Speaker B: Okay.
01:33:07.128 - 01:33:13.128, Speaker A: And an open set just means that every one of the entries are going to be, in the class, quite analytic.
01:33:13.296 - 01:33:15.004, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
01:33:16.744 - 01:33:19.524, Speaker A: So there exists a generic submersion.
01:33:26.984 - 01:33:27.296, Speaker C: In.
01:33:27.320 - 01:33:32.924, Speaker A: Q such that the composition.
01:33:40.844 - 01:33:50.996, Speaker B: Is proper. This is the last point that I.
01:33:51.020 - 01:34:04.196, Speaker A: Want to talk about today. So it's just to say that the difference between semi proper and being proper, you actually can always compose with a little bit more, which is going to be generically a submersion, as we see.
01:34:04.220 - 01:34:10.832, Speaker B: So locally is even going to be an isomorphism and in such a way.
01:34:10.848 - 01:34:12.644, Speaker A: That the map is going to become proper.
01:34:14.784 - 01:34:15.724, Speaker B: Is proper.
01:34:18.024 - 01:34:25.408, Speaker A: So the idea here is that we want to transform. So for each one of the k's we took the pre image, it's going to be compact.
01:34:25.456 - 01:34:27.232, Speaker B: And now what we know is that.
01:34:27.248 - 01:34:28.096, Speaker A: We are going to be able to.
01:34:28.120 - 01:34:31.536, Speaker B: Cover with the set l and the.
01:34:31.560 - 01:34:33.324, Speaker A: Basic part of the construction.
01:34:33.964 - 01:34:38.144, Speaker B: So the basic, the main idea.
01:34:44.404 - 01:34:44.716, Speaker C: Is.
01:34:44.740 - 01:34:49.304, Speaker A: To consider the projection of the sphere.
01:34:57.444 - 01:35:12.364, Speaker B: And write it like this. Given by xt equals to x, where.
01:35:12.784 - 01:35:14.408, Speaker A: The sn is, the three are given.
01:35:14.456 - 01:35:19.488, Speaker B: By x one squared, x n squared.
01:35:19.536 - 01:35:31.874, Speaker A: Plus t squared equals to one. So this map here tell field is going to be a generic submersion.
01:35:33.054 - 01:35:35.314, Speaker B: Sn is going to be subject.
01:35:44.934 - 01:36:00.854, Speaker A: Submersion. It's a submersion everywhere outside of the, of the images of the, of the m sphere given by equals t equals zero. Sorry. The other is equal to.
01:36:03.234 - 01:36:08.734, Speaker B: Outside of this, equal. So yes, t equals to one, sorry.
01:36:10.234 - 01:36:15.654, Speaker A: And it's a proper, this, this one is also proper local maximum rank and.
01:36:17.374 - 01:36:18.314, Speaker B: It'S proper.
01:36:20.134 - 01:36:26.794, Speaker A: We are in a closed compact set is a, is a continuous function, so it's going to be proper.
01:36:27.454 - 01:36:32.382, Speaker B: And the tilde of sn is simply.
01:36:32.518 - 01:36:42.354, Speaker A: The ball of radius one and center zero in rn. So the main idea is this one. So what are we going to do?
01:36:47.354 - 01:36:48.466, Speaker B: This is going to give us some.
01:36:48.490 - 01:36:54.610, Speaker A: Intuition about what does generic proper means. What we're going to do is that.
01:36:54.642 - 01:36:56.494, Speaker B: Now consider.
01:36:58.914 - 01:37:00.574, Speaker A: A locally finite over.
01:37:06.434 - 01:37:10.274, Speaker B: Of m by compact sets.
01:37:21.014 - 01:37:27.034, Speaker A: So we cover n by locally compact, by a locally compact cover, so by semiproperness.
01:37:34.154 - 01:38:03.234, Speaker B: For each alpha there are finite numbers connected complex sets. L alpha k.
01:38:14.294 - 01:38:16.034, Speaker A: Adida depends on alpha.
01:38:18.014 - 01:38:29.494, Speaker B: Such that the image by the mapping of the union of this Ll is equal to KL.
01:38:32.394 - 01:38:43.334, Speaker A: Now the idea is that we're just going to compose for each one of these l alpha J's with that morph is given by theta children. So let me make a.
01:38:45.474 - 01:38:45.842, Speaker B: Let me.
01:38:45.858 - 01:38:52.354, Speaker A: Make a hypothesis here, just to simplify things. If we like. Actually this can be, can be shown.
01:38:52.394 - 01:38:56.914, Speaker B: Since we're in a matrix phase without loss of generality.
01:39:02.054 - 01:39:16.874, Speaker A: But there is something to prove here. I'm going to come back to it in a moment. We may suppose that l alpha j.
01:39:17.654 - 01:39:22.354, Speaker B: Is containing some rna and there exist.
01:39:22.394 - 01:39:23.734, Speaker A: Coordinate systems.
01:39:30.754 - 01:39:33.690, Speaker B: Such that the l alpha.
01:39:33.722 - 01:39:44.214, Speaker A: J'S are equal to walls of radial one. So if you have this case, this case here, then for each one of these alpha alpha j's we're going to compose with this map here.
01:39:46.854 - 01:39:50.754, Speaker B: Then for each.
01:39:52.694 - 01:39:55.674, Speaker A: Alpha j we consider.
01:39:58.254 - 01:40:05.150, Speaker B: Tau of alpha j from sn to.
01:40:05.182 - 01:40:05.874, Speaker A: Rn.
01:40:07.934 - 01:40:13.054, Speaker B: Such that the image of it.
01:40:14.074 - 01:40:22.454, Speaker A: Is equal to l alpha j we consider. So let me put an index out here.
01:40:24.314 - 01:40:37.994, Speaker B: Let n be the union all of them and the tilde from nature, sorry.
01:40:39.334 - 01:40:40.314, Speaker C: To n.
01:40:45.094 - 01:40:52.326, Speaker B: With amorphism whose restriction to.
01:40:52.350 - 01:40:55.086, Speaker A: H one of this sn alpha j.
01:40:55.270 - 01:41:05.482, Speaker B: Is equal to delta of Alpha J's. Now we claim that this is the.
01:41:05.498 - 01:41:13.614, Speaker A: Morphers that we are searching for is.
01:41:14.594 - 01:41:16.094, Speaker B: The search at morphs.
01:41:24.554 - 01:42:13.902, Speaker A: Now I don't want to suspend a little bit much longer, but this actually can be seen in a not too difficult way. You take any compact set since this is going to be a locally finite cover by m, it's going to be covered by a finite number of these k alphas. And for each one of these k alphas the prime image is going to be exactly in a finite number of these L alpha J's. So you're going to have that the prime image of k is going to be containing a finite number of this sn alpha j sets. So since the dark complex and the prey image of a compact set is going to be, it's going to be a compact and the prey image of a compact set is going to be closed, it's also going to be compact. So this is going to show that this now map the composition of Phi with the theta tilde is going to be proper, which is what we wanted.
01:42:13.918 - 01:42:18.474, Speaker B: To show, which was all of our goal here.
01:42:19.734 - 01:42:26.058, Speaker A: Now the comment that I made here is that without loss of generality we may suppose that is equal to b, one equals zero.
01:42:26.146 - 01:42:28.282, Speaker B: So this is of course there is.
01:42:28.298 - 01:42:32.034, Speaker A: An argument here to be made. So in general you can only cover.
01:42:32.114 - 01:42:34.494, Speaker B: It by balls of this form.
01:42:35.434 - 01:43:27.684, Speaker A: So we may cover it by the ball of these forms. But then we have to take care of knowing that when we project once again by Phi we get something that is locally finite, a locally finite compact by again compact sets. So then it's convenient to take two locally finite over by compact sets, one containing the other, and to argue that we can cover the first by balls which are contained in the second. So there is a little argument to be done here for this star, a topological argument. So I'm going to finish today right now because I already passed a bit of time. So thanks a lot and sorry for the weak salor.
01:43:28.664 - 01:43:32.124, Speaker B: Yeah, so I finished now. I'm sorry for it.
01:43:42.104 - 01:43:43.044, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:43:43.384 - 01:43:44.744, Speaker D: Thank you, Andre. It.
