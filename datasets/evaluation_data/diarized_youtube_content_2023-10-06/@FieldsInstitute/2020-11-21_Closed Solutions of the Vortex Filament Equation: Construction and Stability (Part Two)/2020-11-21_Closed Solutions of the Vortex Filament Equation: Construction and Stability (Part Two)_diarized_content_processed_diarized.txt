00:00:00.160 - 00:00:58.014, Speaker A: All right, so this is the second part. It follows up from Tom's talk on the construction of close solution of the localized induction equation. And I would like first of all, to acknowledge the various students that came in and out to this project. These are mostly undergraduate and master's students and also collaborator Stefan La Fortune, who is also a colleague at our institution. This is not new work, by the way, so I'm talking about fairly old work. The second part of my talk will be a bit more on recent direction, looking at the stability of these kind of solutions. But for the first part, I want to focus on cost solutions that do not change, not type.
00:00:58.014 - 00:01:49.958, Speaker A: And you know that the vortex filament equation is a local flow. So we do expect the solutions to change, not type. And there are many such examples leading to physical solutions. But in this discussion, I really want to focus on the construction of a whole family of small amplitude knots that while they evolve, they do not change knot type. And the knot type is described in term of spectral quantities, in particular, periodic point of the flowcase spectrum, which are invariant under time evolution. And consequentially, we will have this topological persistence. First of all.
00:01:49.958 - 00:02:53.184, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I hope I can play this, but this is an example of a genus one, a finite gap solution of the type that Tom constructed. And these are the simplest examples besides the circular filament that move without change of shape. So this is constructed numerically from integrating the Frene serrated, but it is initialized from one of these genus one solution that Tom described in terms of riemann theta functions. And it's a 310 right ended torus knot. Notice the evolution is very simple. It evolves by symmetry. So there is a slide along the filament combined with the translation and the rotation.
00:02:53.184 - 00:03:27.144, Speaker A: So, in the first part, let me start with a very brief review of what Tom described and many other people. By the way, I've heard a few talks describing this connection. So, the relation between the vortex filament flow, or localized induction equation, or binomial flow, is well known by now. The equation is related to the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation.
00:03:27.764 - 00:03:29.372, Speaker B: Focus analysa.
00:03:29.468 - 00:03:30.144, Speaker A: Yes.
00:03:30.444 - 00:03:35.264, Speaker B: We don't see your slides. We are still at the first slide.
00:03:36.004 - 00:03:43.364, Speaker A: If you have advanced, we can't see. So let me maybe get out. Can you see it now?
00:03:43.484 - 00:03:44.184, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:44.484 - 00:03:55.076, Speaker A: Okay, so let me. Maybe the movie messed something up. So let me try to go to full screen. If not, I will remain not in full screen mode. Can you see it?
00:03:55.220 - 00:03:55.564, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:55.604 - 00:03:55.876, Speaker A: We are.
00:03:55.900 - 00:03:58.516, Speaker B: Now we are at slide five, but we missed the first ones.
00:03:58.580 - 00:04:02.276, Speaker A: Oh, you missed the first one. Okay, well, so did you see the movie?
00:04:02.420 - 00:04:03.484, Speaker B: No. Me either.
00:04:03.604 - 00:04:16.732, Speaker A: Oh, none see the. Oh, okay, so let me, let me then get out a second from the, from the full screen, maybe messed up. So. So here is the movie. Do you see now?
00:04:16.908 - 00:04:17.664, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:18.693 - 00:04:56.100, Speaker A: Okay. I think the full screen mode probably just messed it up. So here is the torus knot. It right in the torus knot. The initial condition is really one that Tom described in terms of elliptic functions or theta function in general. There is one example, very simple example, of solutions that do not change knot type. You see that the evolution is rigid.
00:04:56.100 - 00:05:27.144, Speaker A: It slides on to itself, and it translates roughly in the direction of the binormal. Now, it's not a circle. So the binormal flow will roughly be transversal to. To the osculating plane at each point. So it creates this motion. All right, let me attempt to go back to the first slide in full mode. Otherwise, I'll leave it like this.
00:05:27.144 - 00:06:48.912, Speaker A: Okay. Can you see it now? Yes. Okay, great. So, very briefly here on this slide, you have the connection between the vortex filament flow and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation given by the Azimoto transformation. And again, something that Tom talked about yesterday is the simple Meyer formula that allows you to sort of invert the Asimato map. You take a solution of the NLS equation, you solve the so called lax pair, or better known as Aknx system. At that solution, you construct a fundamental matrix solution that, for real value, or the eigenvalue, lives in the group sustainability, and you differentiate with respect to lambda, pull back to the identity, get an element in the Lie algebra, skew symmetric matrices, and we know that that can be identified with the curve in r three isometrically.
00:06:48.912 - 00:07:56.792, Speaker A: So this gives us a way to invert the azimoto map, provided we can solve the Akns system. And Tom made the point that the Akna system is truly equivalent to, let's say, a Frene system expressed, instead of Frenet vectors expressed in terms of a natural frame. So, finite gap solutions are then constructed using a procedure that was pioneered by it based on the Baker archaic function, Krishever, and then previato in particular for the NLS equation. And they are associated to sheet Riemann surface of genus g, which is branched at a certain number of branch points, which I will call simple points of the spectrum. The spectrum here is flockey spectrum, because we will consider. Annalisa, you still cannot see.
00:07:56.968 - 00:08:00.040, Speaker B: We are still at five. Slide at slide five.
00:08:00.152 - 00:08:37.914, Speaker A: Okay, so if you don't mind, I won't stay in the full view mode. Yeah, I think it's better for you to actually run it in just the mode that it's in now that it's. Yeah, I'll leave it, like, here, because it seems like my computer has been glitchy anyway, so. Okay, slide five. You saw it. And slide six. Here I'm describing the same thing that Tom described yesterday, finite gap solution in terms of a Tushita Riemann surface of genus g branches.
00:08:37.914 - 00:10:09.994, Speaker A: Simple points of the floche spectrum. Again, floche spectrum, because we consider here NLS solutions, or NLS potential, that are periodical period l. So the floches spectrum is simply defined as the set of eigenvalues that lead to bounded eigenfunctions over the period. And it can be described in terms of the flok discriminant, this delta, which is essentially the trace of the transfer matrix that describes how a Nigen function grows across a period. The flochdiscrimina can be expressed in this form as a cosine of l times a certain abelian integral called the quasi momentum integral. And the reconstruction formula by simple Meyer, that's a delicate point of the whole construction, will take a periodic NLS potential and give back a closed curve only if, well, the frame of the curve is smoothly closed. And therefore the reconstruction points is a periodic or anti periodic point of the spectrum.
00:10:09.994 - 00:11:24.984, Speaker A: This boils down to essentially reconstructing the french frame in terms of quadratic product or components of the eigenfunctions. And so when you have a periodic or anti periodic points in the spectrum, those will lead to smoothly closed frames. But an even more delicate condition is that the reconstruction point needs to be a so called critical point, and that's a zero of this quasi momentum differential, which enters in the floche discriminant expression. And it's typically a transcendental condition, is difficult to implement, even numerically or approximately with mathematica tools. So the construction of close filaments is still not completely trivial. So when we were looking for several examples, we started thinking that instead of approaching the construction of close filament head on. By the way, do you see slide seven now? Okay, thank you.
00:11:24.984 - 00:12:14.540, Speaker A: That we could find some way to automatically ensure the closure of the filament, starting with some well known equation. And along the way, we wanted to find many examples of filament that don't change their knot type throughout the evolution. And so at least they have, they are physically interesting. For example, so I believe Tom, towards the end of his talk, describe the family of genus, one solution. These are all torus knots. PQ torus knot, actually not the entire family, but half of the family. You'll see a bound later on.
00:12:14.540 - 00:13:36.738, Speaker A: And he mentioned that this family is sort of foliated by omotopy families described by one parameter, deformations. And at either end of the deformation, you have a multiplic over circle, for example, a two three torus knot, a trefoil on one side and the two five on the other. And as you move this deformation parameter, all sort of phenomena appear. This initial circle starts deforming. And notice here there is sort of this trigonal type of symmetry. It may become singular in the middle of the deformation, change not type, and then limit to a different multiplic over circle. So what's happening during this deformation is that in the middle of the deformation, for example, the spot spectrum, the floches spectrum of any one of these curves will look like the middle figure here that I'm pointing at.
00:13:36.738 - 00:14:18.054, Speaker A: So it will have two branches. They are complex branches or continuous spectrum. The endpoints are the branch point of the Riemann surface. And the intersection of the complex bands with the real bend of spectrum are the so called critical points. That's a situation that the zeros or the quasi momentum differential occur at the base of the spines or spectrum. Now, what is shown in this middle figure is this alpha knot. Think of alpha knot as the point at which you reconstruct your filament using the simple Meyer formula.
00:14:18.054 - 00:15:39.214, Speaker A: And one of these curves down below is the reconstruction. So as this deformation parameter changes, one of the spines grows and the other spine gets smaller. And what's happening? If I go, for example, from a multiplic over circle to a genus one solution, I'm essentially opening up one of these spines, and therefore I'm creating, I'm unpinching the genus of the surface. So instead of going from a singular Riemann sphere with singular points, now I'm pinching the genus from zero to one. And so I'm obtaining essentially a torque. As this deformation keeps going, the second band is going to pinch. And again, the genus will pinch from one to zero and land at the other end of the deformation onto another multiplic over circle, for which the underlying Riemann surface is a singular Riemann sphere with a certain number of singular points.
00:15:39.214 - 00:17:27.544, Speaker A: So the idea we had is that this can we use deformations that maintain the closure of the filament, maintain the periodicity of the potential NLS potential. And in this way, I'm pinching multiple times to create topological phenomena and different solution on increasingly high genome. Well, luckily there is a theory of isoperiodic deformation. This is, by the way, is due originally to Krishever, who was interested in very different applications to topological field theory, and they are quite related to width and deformation flows. After Flaska, McLoughlin Forest and company in the mid nineties green navy change, we are actually looking also at these isoperiodic deformation, which are the formations of the spectrum of a finite gap solution in such a way that they preserve the frequencies in the expression for the solution. So let me go back here to slide six. So, if you look at this expression for the NLS potential in terms of theta function, the v's are the spatial frequencies.
00:17:27.544 - 00:18:16.644, Speaker A: To get a periodic solution, the entries of these vectors, they are g dimensional vector will need to be commensurate. What the isoperiodic deformations achieve is changing the spectrum and of course, the location of the critical points. They are related in such a way that those versus the frequencies are preserved. Now, they are ods, they are control equations that c is a control parameter. It will be our deformation parameter. These coefficients are actually ck. There are geodos, they are arbitrary controls.
00:18:16.644 - 00:19:40.272, Speaker A: And luckily, actually, we not only preserve the frequencies, but if I, let's say, reconstruct the curve at one of the critical points. So these alpha naught alpha g's are the zeros of the quasi momentum differential. Let's say I reconstructed an alpha k. If I choose the corresponding control ck to be zero, you can show very easily that the curve remains closed. I think Tom showed that the obstruction to closure is actually the quasi momentum differential itself. So we are not moving that alpha K and therefore the curve stays close. Again, main idea here, or before I do that, what about the frequencies? If you think of a, a solution of genus g characterized by this complex spine or spectrum, and we have two g, two branch points.
00:19:40.272 - 00:20:56.988, Speaker A: So g plus one. Bandospectrum. Imagine of starting genes assessive deformation that pinch the genus. So you go from g to g minus one to g minus two, by simply flowing with all of the controls equal to zero, except for the g control, or the k control at each stage being equal to negative one. So this deformation will produce the g band flowing towards the real axis and pinching in time or in c, so that the corresponding simple point, the branch points and the critical point will coalesce at the end of the deformation. And then you do it again until only one pair of simple points remains and the corresponding critical points at the base of the spine and you'll get the limiting frequencies in this way. So you can use a residue calculation.
00:20:56.988 - 00:21:54.942, Speaker A: And the v case will simply be expressed in terms of the limiting values of these deformation points, the points that deform. So we want to reverse this process. Starting in geno, zero, genus zero correspond to a multiplic over circle. We can select the critical points along the real axis as we please, really to give the desired frequencies. And we can perform successive deformation that now open up. So instead of having c one, c one, we will have c ck equal plus one, and open up these singular points. So, in a snapshot, this is what I just said.
00:21:54.942 - 00:22:33.454, Speaker A: So you start at geno zero, genus zero. Now, you should think of either the picture of the multiplic over circle. Let me describe it a little bit. So, multiplic over circles, the unphysical smoke rings, they have an imaginary Bendel spectrum. Embedded in this bend, there are so called double points. They have, of course, a whole real bend of spectrum. That's for every solution of nls.
00:22:33.454 - 00:23:23.074, Speaker A: And embedded in the real axis, there are real double points. Those are the ones that we focus on. And we want to open up small bands using the deformation odes. Of course, this is a perturbative problem, so we have to sort of perform a desingualization, which can be done. Every one of these double points can be seen as a triplet, like as a lambda one, let's say lambda 1 bar pinch to the critical point. And when you de singularize, you construct analytically the unstable manifold of those odes. So it's not too difficult.
00:23:23.074 - 00:24:31.696, Speaker A: It's a perturbation problem. If you look down here, that's a picture I already showed, but now we are actually opening up the real double point delta on the left. This will, of course, create a deformation of the remaining simple points in this imaginary bend that will deform a little bit. Alpha naught will move a bit, and we unpinch the genus. All right, let me give you a preview of the result we are heading to. So when we perform the sequence of the formation at each stage, we are going to create a cable on the previous knot. So if I open up one double point, well, we are going to get the configurations of the genus one solution.
00:24:31.696 - 00:25:30.740, Speaker A: So we are getting a torus knot. You can think of it as a cable on the circle. If we open up a turband, we are getting a cable on the torus knot. Now, what's a cabling operation? Well, you could think of composing a torus knot with a map that embeds it as a knot on the surface of a tube which is knotted in a certain knot type. In other words, if you draw your torus knot on a doughnut and you cut your doughnut, imagine the doughnut is flexible, and you knot the doughnut in another torus knot. Then you get a cable on the torus. Note all right, let me explain a bit.
00:25:30.740 - 00:26:28.014, Speaker A: These deformation schemes. So we use the following notation. So n is the number of times the initial circle wraps onto itself. M one through mg are successive integers. We have to have a similar bound as the one for torus knots. So we will not realize all cables, but which is due to the fact to this bound that n has to be strictly less than the absolute value of nk for every k. And these g one tuple, well, they're mutually prime, right? So the greater common divisor must be one.
00:26:28.014 - 00:28:05.484, Speaker A: So this notation describes the following sequence of the formation. So, as I indicated in the previous slide, you select a double point located at the desired frequency at any stage, and then you at stage one, for example, you open up delta one. At stage two, you open up delta two. Now the frequency is likely perturbed because the perturbation parameter is non zero. For example, if you look at this scheme, so you start with the four times cover circle, and you look at these integers minus six and -13 it's not difficult to see that you're opening up a double point whose frequency is is three halves right. And then successively in the successive deformation, you are opening up at a higher frequency. So the first step of the deformation will create a left handed trifoil, and the second step will create a 213 cable on that trifoil.
00:28:05.484 - 00:29:03.956, Speaker A: One more example here, a more complicated deformation. This is a three stage deformation, starting again with the left handed trifoil. In the first step we perform a two five cable on the trafoil, and in the next step you obtain a 217 left hand cable on the previous cable. So here is the statement of the cabling theorems. So the scheme will produce a sequence of filaments that will all be closed. At the k stage I get genus k solution, so I produce increasingly high genus solutions. The length is the length of the circle.
00:29:03.956 - 00:30:35.930, Speaker A: Let's say that the total length of the circle divided by these LK's, which are the great and common divisors of all of the deformations integers up to that stage. By the way, I should say that the length here is the minimal period of the curve, and the predicted topology here is expressed in terms of these frequencies, and therefore it's expressed in terms of the locations of the selected double points. So at any time the constructed cable will be of this type about the previous constructed cable. So, for example here that deformation that I show first, it will give you a trifoil knot first of length four PI and then a 213 cable left handed of length eight PI on that trifoil. Feel free to interrupt me at any point if you have questions. So, just a few comments on the proof. The proof goes in several steps.
00:30:35.930 - 00:31:31.634, Speaker A: So well, first of all, we show that these deformations are indeed produce give analytic dependence of the branch point in the deformation parameter. I'm using epsilon here. I should be using xeed in the deformation odes. Also, we need to show that the NLS solution corresponding to this deformation is also analytic in the deformation parameter. This can be done by using so called trace formulas and introducing a different type of eigenvalues. These are dynamic eigenvalues called the drill spectrum of the problem. They are essentially describe the angle variable on these invariant Tori.
00:31:31.634 - 00:32:36.944, Speaker A: They are dynamic so they are not preserved under the evolution. And there is papers by several people, in particular ablowitz and Ma, that writes down odes for these direct length spectrum. They are called the news and the news. And using those you can show that those will be analytic in the deformation parameter. And using trace formulas which express the imaginary and real part of the NLS solution in terms of the branch points and the dynamic eigenvalues, you can show analyticity. The next step is to produce deformations of q and the corresponding curves. So the deformation is done by expanding the perturbative terms on a biorthogonal basis of squared eigenfunctions.
00:32:36.944 - 00:34:11.370, Speaker A: I don't know if Tom mentioned, probably didn't get to that slide, but it's well known that if you construct a certain quadratic products of the components of the Baker eigenfunction, those solve the linearized nls. I will say something a little more in the last ten minutes or so when I get to stability. But the punchline is that you can express the deformation in terms of on this basis, and because you're performing the formation only at one of the double points, it turns out that the coefficient of this expansion, they're all zero except for the k term. And this by the way gives also a nice expression from the Sim permaier formula for the deformation of the curve. And by the way, this TUV are the natural frame vectors or parallel frame vectors of the curve, not quite parallel, because there is a constant twist in this frame related to the reconstruction point. Last step is to prove how the perturbation of the curve winds about gamma naught. You show that the argument of the deformation of q is monotonin x winds and time.
00:34:11.370 - 00:35:12.083, Speaker A: So essentially you are adding small frequencies, and at the end you prove that there is a cable forming gamma one winds around mk times for every l, k minus one circuit of the original curve. And the last twist at the end of the proof is that you have to show that the natural frame is unlinked with the gamma knot. So you don't have a spurious knot type coming in. So that follows from continuity and using white formula. Now, the nice thing, consequence of this is that the not type of every one of these cables is fixed for all times. And why is that? Because simply they are constructed in terms of the spectrum. And the flow of an Ls or a VFE is ISO spectrum.
00:35:12.083 - 00:36:05.484, Speaker A: It preserves the spectrum. So the spectrum actually tell you topological information for this large family of small amplitude iterated knots, iterated torus knots. So it's an interesting family that can be used to create knots of more complicated topology, for example, whose topology persists. All right. Oh, let me show one more picture here. So, just to prove the point, these are three steel frames of the evolution of that two phi cable on the trifoil that I showed before. Clearly, the evolution is not rigid.
00:36:05.484 - 00:37:02.462, Speaker A: These are no longer a solution evolving by symmetry. So they will wobble, but the knot type will not change. The yellow curve is the trace of a point on the curve in time, showing somehow that the evolution is not rigid. It's not just the rotation and translation. All right, so let me get to stability and see how much I can say in the last few few minutes. So, I, the type of stability we looked at is very simple. So we just want to see if the solution or the linearization of our vortex filament equation about a certain solution have control growth in time.
00:37:02.462 - 00:37:55.730, Speaker A: So essentially we will be looking for exponential instability or neutral stability. So it's really the first step in analyzing stability of solutions. So, one of our students actually is responsible for finding out this nice relation. So, one word about what kind of perturbations of the filament we allow. So you have a filament on length l. So it makes sense, number one, because the VFE is a non stretching flow. It preserves arc length.
00:37:55.730 - 00:39:15.180, Speaker A: It doesn't stretch the filament. First of all, it makes sense to consider only non stretching variations. So you can add the vector field here. W here it is expressed in term of that natural frame and the condition for non stretching is that the derivative with respect to arc length of w has a zero dot product with the tangent vector to the filament. But the other assumption, and this makes sense, is that you want variations of the same period of the curve, because you're looking for a closed curve and you're going to perturb it. So the theorem simply says that if you take one such non stretching variations, it satisfies the linearization of the VFe at a given filament if and only if the function, the complex potential that you obtain by taking the coefficient of u, that's the first vector in the natural frame of gamma, and the coefficient of v. The second vector, you construct g plus ih.
00:39:15.180 - 00:40:32.854, Speaker A: That is a solution of the linearized nls. So there is a kind of a direct connection between this geometric quantities and the two general and the two linearization. So, as I mentioned before, this is well known to integrable people. If you take a fundamental solution matrix as the one constructed by Tom yesterday on the AkNs system, and you construct these sort of linear combinations of squares or components that will solve the linearized NLS equation. This is a direct proof, and also because of what I was saying before about periodic anti periodic points. If lambda is the periodic, or we call them periodic point, but they correspond to periodic anti periodic eigenfunctions, well, their square will be periodic. So, so we will obtain a periodic solutions of the linearized NLS equation when we evaluate these fees at periodic points of the floches petrol.
00:40:32.854 - 00:41:44.340, Speaker A: Now the general shape of a finite gap eigenfunction, or this Becker Kaiser eigenfunction is as follow that theta function part is bounded in space and time. But in front of this theta function ratio, you have this exponential. Now, omega one is the quasi momentum differential and omega two is another abelian integral which encodes the time growth. So if omega two has an imaginary part which is non zero, well, this will cause exponential growth in the solution. So this linear instability is encoded in that abelian integral and that's what we need to evaluate. So, instability, as I said, corresponds to periodic points in the spectrum for which the imaginary part of that abelian integral is non zero. And because of the correspondence between the linearization, the corresponding filament will be linearly unstable.
00:41:44.340 - 00:42:29.272, Speaker A: Now generically, the points at which that abelian differential is non zero, as non zero imaginary part are complex, they're usually complex. You actually can show that no real double points will create instability. But in general, I don't think there are examples that show otherwise. But also, there are not examples of complex double points that do not cause linear instability. So that's a bit of an open question. So, in the simplest case, the circular filament things are very computable. So very easily.
00:42:29.272 - 00:43:42.814, Speaker A: So you have, you can compute the abelian integral omega two at any one of the double points. By the way, this delta sub m here, depending on the interplay between m and n, are either real or imaginary. So you get an infinite sequence of those points. And when you look at it well, when m is greater than n, n is how many times the circle winds onto itself. The imaginary part of omega two is zero, omega two is real. But if you go back and look at all of these imaginary double points here, so for m from one to m minus one here, you need the n to be greater than one, right, to have that, then that imaginary part is non zero. So that means that all these multiplicover circles are linearly unstable and they had n minus one unstable modes, where n is the winding of the circle on its own.
00:43:42.814 - 00:44:32.128, Speaker A: So the only, let's say, physical filament is the simplicova circle, and any multiplic over one is unstable. Now, let me go through, if I can have maybe a couple more minutes, I'll go through the last few slides. The last few slides are simply examples. So, Kida filament, I call them Kida filament. They are the genus one solution that were observed by kidas in the early eighties. They are unstable. So those nice torus knots, like the one that Luis was showing, this blade that Kleckner and Irvine used to create one of these torus knots in water.
00:44:32.128 - 00:45:05.636, Speaker A: And. And you see the torus knots kind of blooming in my mind, that is the symptom of the linear instability. So these are unstable. And I would like to confirm, to mention that Kida actually didn't have the tools, analytical tool, to explore stability, linear stability. But he did some numerical studies on his Kida filament. He expressed them in terms of elliptic function. And his conjecture, after numerical studies was that they're actually linearly unstable.
00:45:05.636 - 00:46:06.164, Speaker A: So this confirms that all work by Kida. Let me skip this. This is simply saying that when I consider square diagonal functions, I can basically go back and forth between the space of NLS potentials constructed from, or perturbations constructed from square eigenfunctions and corresponding variations. So we can pull back the result of instability from NLS to VFE. But the very last mention is we can say a bit more on one of the non small genus one solutions. This is a so called conoidal NLS potential. It has an additional symmetry here where your eigenvalue is symmetric across the vertical axis here, so it has symmetric bends of spectrum.
00:46:06.164 - 00:46:33.684, Speaker A: The period is in terms of kappa. Delete the total elliptic integral, and we can precisely describe the knot type of these equations. They are knots of constant torsion. The torsion is point wise constant along these curves. So we have unknots. They are torus knots. They can be unknotted or they can be knotted.
00:46:33.684 - 00:47:38.454, Speaker A: And we can compute explicitly the floquet discriminant. We can analytically describe the location of the complex double points. These are typical graphs representing regions where the discriminant real is plus or minus two. And this dotted black line is where the imaginary part of that abelian integral vanishes. We find that there are two complex double points in the spine. So this is just an illustration, but there is a theorem behind here, and this is with Stefan La fortune. And so if we have a conoidal NLS potential associated with the Nm torus knots, again with that bound condition where n has to be in strength less than m and m co primes, that's unstable.
00:47:38.454 - 00:48:34.626, Speaker A: That's linearly unstable. So it mimics the situation of the multiplic over circle. It will have n one unstable modes, so not the filaments with conoidal potential will be unstable and unnoticed filaments such as this one, which, you know, we see in nature in some ways, you see these volcanoes spouting vortex filament, they look fairly stable. And the unknotted one have no, I have to be careful about the statement of these have no linear instability arising from curve variation induced by squared eigen functions. If square gain function form a complete set, then we have a stronger statement. But I don't want to affirm that yet. All right.
00:48:34.626 - 00:48:42.864, Speaker A: Still open, of course, non linear orbital stability. But I will conclude here. And I thank you very much for paying attention.
00:48:43.564 - 00:48:47.504, Speaker B: Thank you. Are there some questions?
00:48:53.684 - 00:49:12.414, Speaker C: I have just a quick correction, actually. At the stage where we desingularize the ode system at the, when opening up a double point off the real axis, we actually have to change from the deformation parameter c in the original equations to epsilon, and c is epsilon squared, essentially.
00:49:12.454 - 00:49:13.614, Speaker A: That's right. That's right.
00:49:13.694 - 00:49:16.574, Speaker C: So that's necessary to make it analytic in epsilon.
00:49:16.694 - 00:49:19.314, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
00:49:22.574 - 00:49:38.484, Speaker B: Other remarks or questions? At some point, you mentioned the fact that your solutions remain of the same node type because of integrability and the fact that it's related to an ISO spectral deformation.
00:49:38.614 - 00:50:27.464, Speaker A: Yes. So think of it in this way. So when we perform these deformations of the spectrum, right, the spectrum corresponds to a solution of NLS. And when the solution of NLS evolves, the spectrum is unchanged. So once I fix my deformation parameter and I've opened up these double points, the evolution of the solution is not going to change it. And the knot type is described in terms of these original spectral quantities.
00:50:28.284 - 00:50:34.450, Speaker B: But then what about the solutions curves which develop self intersections? They exist.
00:50:34.602 - 00:50:48.094, Speaker A: They exist, but they're not part of this family. So this is a whole family of solution that are close to multiplic over circle and they will not change time, change type in time.
00:50:48.554 - 00:51:07.816, Speaker B: But what would that mean then for their interpretation? In the integrable, in terms of the spectral decomposition, in the integrable side, those curves that develop self intersection, that means that for them, the knot type is not determined by their eigenvalues, correct?
00:51:07.920 - 00:51:57.172, Speaker A: Yes. Like for example, you know, you could for anyone, almost any one of these solutions, because they're linearly, generically, linearly unstable, you actually can construct the homoclinic orbits. And these homoclinic orbit will land on the solution in positive, negative time in the middle. Typically they will, they will perform large excursions that will lead to changes of knot type. Now, dishomcle orbit are not part of this family. The underlying target will not change the knot type. But if you were to create a generic initial condition for your nls, and therefore VFE, typically that will change knot type.
00:51:57.172 - 00:52:45.194, Speaker A: So the knot type for those solution is not related to the spectrum. But this kind of, the way I see it is like we're constructing a sort of tubular neighborhood of these multiplicover circles where we have solution of any genus. Of course, you know, the deformation parameter, the deformation has to be smaller and smaller. So it's fairly abstract here, but we have all possible genuses up to finite number, right? And in this family, in this particular family, all the curves will not change topology. They will not evolve by rigid motion. The motion is complicated, but there will not be self intersections.
00:52:47.974 - 00:53:10.924, Speaker C: If I can just add something here, you know, this, the set of iterated cable knots, you know, cabling topic of a circle, then cabling again and so forth. And again, each deformation step is a smaller amplitude that's measure zero within the set of all knots. So this is an impossibly venturing small slice of all, not types. Yes.
