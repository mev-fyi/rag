00:00:00.160 - 00:00:15.337, Speaker A: Okay. Our second speaker of this afternoon session is Jacob Bereovskin from High School of Economics. He's going to speak about the real jura associated with the lower central series of right angled coxet talk groups. Please.
00:00:15.481 - 00:01:22.375, Speaker B: Thank you. I'd like thanks to organizers for inviting me here. It's great pleasure to talk in Toronto and Fields Institute. My talk is Zeli algebra associated with the lower central series of a right angled Cox group. Let K is a simplicial complex on the set M where set M is numbers from 1 to M also empty set in K and the elements of simplicial complex is a simplex. Let xa bolt xa a sequence of pairs of spaces where AI is subset of xi. Given subset of M I subset M V has X a power I.
00:01:22.375 - 00:01:38.615, Speaker B: Like this product of gamma I where gamma I equals xi if I in big I and AI if I not big I.
00:01:39.555 - 00:01:40.375, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:42.195 - 00:02:32.565, Speaker B: The k polyhedral product of bolt xa X like this is union by all simplexes from simplicial complex K where there this union is taken inside product X I we have notation X AK is bolt x when all xi is x, all AI is A and B has else one notation. If all A is point V notation like this.
00:02:33.185 - 00:02:34.005, Speaker C: Okay.
00:02:36.115 - 00:03:26.095, Speaker B: We have example. Let xa is S1 end point where S1 is circle. Then S1k polyhedral product is union like this. This a subset of M to when K is m disjoint points. The Polyhedral product S1K is the wedge of M circles. When K consists of all proper subsets of M the boundary of an M minus one dimensional simplex. S1K is fat wedge of m circles.
00:03:26.095 - 00:04:44.685, Speaker B: It is obtained by removing the top dimensional cell from the M to. Okay, for general K on M vertices we have this subset S1k, but for wedge of m circles and m terms. Okay, let's XA is a real number and integer numbers. Then we have LK is R z k polyhedral product when K consists of empty joint points. LK is a gate in M dimensional L space consisting of all lines parallel to one of the coordinates axis and passing search integer points. When K is bound of m minus one dimensional simplex. The complex lk is the union of all integer hyper planes parallel to coordinate hyper planes.
00:04:46.185 - 00:04:47.005, Speaker C: Okay.
00:04:50.545 - 00:06:01.315, Speaker B: V want in group theory tell about analog of k polyhedral product. Let J is a section is a sequence of m discrete non table groups. Let K is a simplicial complex on M where M like this. Then we have the graph product of the group J1GM is like this when where big star denotes the phi product of the groups and we have relation jigg equals GGI for edges in simplicial complex. In fact, the graph product GK depends only on the one skeleton of K.
00:06:04.655 - 00:06:05.435, Speaker C: Okay.
00:06:07.415 - 00:06:58.503, Speaker B: Let all gi equals integer numbers. Then gk is the right angled attain group like this where F is a phase group with m generators. When k is a full simplex, we have that right angled atom group is a morphic that m z power m. When k is employees, we obtain a phase group of rank M. Second example, let GI is Z2. Then JK is the right angled Cox.
00:06:58.599 - 00:06:59.235, Speaker C: Group.
00:07:01.135 - 00:07:12.295, Speaker B: Different from right angled eating group that we have relations that gi square equals one.
00:07:15.275 - 00:07:16.095, Speaker C: Okay.
00:07:18.155 - 00:08:15.245, Speaker B: We have theory. Let RAK be a right angled atom group. Then fundamental group of F1k equals isamorphic right anglet group. Both S1k and LK are aspherical if and only if K is flag. All higher homotopical groups is amorphic and fundamental group of LK is isamorphic to the commutator subgroup of right angled Atene group. Second theorem about right angled Cox group fundamental group or rp infinity k is amorphic rck. Both spaces where rk is a moment angle complex.
00:08:15.245 - 00:09:19.485, Speaker B: This polyhedral product d1 is 0k are aspherical if and only if case. Like all higher homotopical groups isamorphic and the fundamental group of rk is isamorphic to the commutator subgroup right angled coxeter group. Okay, we have example. Let K be an mcycle the boundary of ngom. A simple argument with Euler Characteristic shows that RK D1S0 is homeomorphic to a closed orientable surface of Janus. Like this, this observation goes back to a 1938 work of Kokster. Therefore, the commutator subgroup of the corresponding right angled cochstra group RCK is a surface group.
00:09:19.485 - 00:11:00.091, Speaker B: Similarly, when geometric realization of simplicial complex K is amorphic two dimensional sphere, RK is a three dimensional manifold. Therefore the commutator subgroup of the corresponding RCK is a say manifold group. Okay, serum, Panov and wave. Let right angled aten and right angled Cox group RAK and rck. Then the commutator subgroup right angled at group is phi if and only if one skeleton of K is a hurdle graph and the commutator subgroup of right angled coxal group is phi. If and only if one skeleton of K is a hurdle half part A is the result of servatus, drums and servatus and the difference between A and B is that commutator subgroup Right angular group is infinitely generated, while the commutator subgroup right angular Cox group is finitely generated. Okay, let G group the commutator of two elements ab given by the formula like this.
00:11:00.091 - 00:11:19.745, Speaker B: This commutator we refer to the following nested commutator of Lange K at the simple nested commutator. Similarly, we define simple nested lie commutators like this.
00:11:25.405 - 00:11:26.185, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:28.215 - 00:13:16.696, Speaker B: For any group G and any three elements ABC from G, the following whole with identities hold where a power B is like this. Let S and W subgroups of G. Then we define bracket ash and W as the subgroup G generated by all commutators like this. In particular, the commutator subgroup jstroke of the group G is bracket G with g. For any group G, set gamma 1 from G equals G and define inductively gamma K plus 1 from G is bracket gamma k from G with G. The resulting sequence of groups Gamma1, Gamma2, Gamma K and infinity sequence is called the lower central series of G. Okay, if H is normal subgroup of G, we will use this notation in particular gamma K1 normal subgroup in gamma k and the quotient group gamma k by gamma k1 is abelian.
00:13:16.696 - 00:14:15.783, Speaker B: Denote lk like gamma k factor gamma k plus 1 and consider the Dirac sum like this. Given an element ak from gamma k, we denote by ak this line its conjugacy class in the quotient group lk. If ak in gamma K and al in gamma l, then commutator of ak and al in gamma k plus l. Then the whole width identities implies that lg is a gradually algebra over Z with bracket like this. The lie algebra algebra is called the lie algebra associated with the lower central series or the associated Lie algebra of.
00:14:15.839 - 00:14:20.955, Speaker C: Group G. Okay.
00:14:25.055 - 00:14:40.245, Speaker B: There is an isomorphism for any car more or equal zero. There is. This is the reduced symbol homology of group of kg.
00:14:42.465 - 00:14:43.245, Speaker C: Okay.
00:14:45.025 - 00:15:42.005, Speaker B: Cerium Panov and let right ng Cochster group rck. Then the commutator subgroup rck stroke has a finite minimal set of generating generators consisting of like this nested commutators like this, where I less j and moc one more k 2 and other more k l minus 2 and I not equals k e k all ks and I is the smallest vertex in a connected component not containing G of the subcomplex.
00:15:42.545 - 00:15:43.285, Speaker C: This.
00:15:45.065 - 00:17:25.339, Speaker B: We have correlate the free ABL group ash1 from Ark of rank like this has a basis consisting of the images of the iterated commutators described in this theory. Let G be a group with generators Gi the K theorem Gamma Kai of the lower central series is generated by simple method commutators of length greater than or equal to K in generators and their inverses. Corolla Let RCK be a right angle toxic group with generators gi. Then the group gamma K is generated by commutators of length greater than or equal to K in generators gi. Because GI is inverse for himself, the square of any element of gamma K is contained in gamma K plus 1 for right angled coxeter group is important. Okay, Prove that we use gamma K instead of gamma k from rck in this proof. For easy notation, let A from gamma k.
00:17:25.339 - 00:18:07.475, Speaker B: If k equals 1, then a like this. If k more than a like this, where AI is commutator like this or commutator like this. For bi from gamma K minus 1, we use induction on n for n equals once the case k equals 1 is obvious. If k more 1, then we have that A like this or l like this. And we have these formulas.
00:18:10.775 - 00:18:11.595, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:13.815 - 00:18:53.517, Speaker B: Suppose now the statement is proved for n minus 1, let a equals this product and a square equals this product. We have that this product equals this. Clearly the first factor lies in gamma 2k. The second factor lies in gamma chi plus one as a conjugate O2A one square by induction and the last factor also lies in gamma k1 by induction. Induction.
00:18:53.675 - 00:18:59.036, Speaker C: IK we have correlated that L rck.
00:18:59.194 - 00:20:18.411, Speaker B: Is a Lie algebra rz 2 we do not buy FL z 2 is a phase gradedly algebra other z 2 with n generators mu I where degrees mu I equals 1. For any simplicial complex k, we consider the Graphly algebra Other z2. Like this relations commutate Li commutator of mu I mu g equals 0 for edge from simplicial complex k. Clearly, Lk depends only on the one skeleton. However, as in the case of right angled coxyl groups, it is more convenient for us to work with simplicial complex. There is epimorphism of lie algebras lk and lrck. LFCK is a Lie algebra RZ2 generated by the elements gi this line.
00:20:18.411 - 00:21:15.365, Speaker B: It's conjugated class in this factor by definition. By definition of a failure algebra, we have this epimagism mu I to gi this line. Since there is a relation for edge in K in the algebra lrck, the epimorphism factor throw a required epimorphism. But in fact zygomorphism fee from the proposition. This is not injective and the lie algebras lk and L R, c K are not isomorphic. This distinguishes the case of right angled Cox groups from the case of the right angled acting groups. Whether associatedly algebra lr ak is isamorphic to the graph Li algebra over z.
00:21:16.785 - 00:21:17.577, Speaker C: Okay.
00:21:17.721 - 00:22:31.645, Speaker B: Example. Let k consists of two disjoint points k1 and 2. Then lk is Fe product Fl2 mu1 flu. The lower central series of fck is follows gamma1, the two ferdag2 and 4k mod2. We have that gamma k equals that is an infinite cyclic group generated by the commutator like this of launch k. Proposition 2 implies that gamma k by gamma k plus 1 equals z 2 for k mod 1 and gamma 1 factor gamma 2 z 2 plus z 2. Consider the algebra LFC k from the arguments above L rck like this, it is easy to see that LK is a morphic graph algebra K graduate component for K1 and 2.
00:22:31.645 - 00:23:14.375, Speaker B: However, for K equals same, we have like this, but LC from RCK equals Z2. Therefore, LCE from RCK is amorphic L Say K factored by this relation. It follows that the homomorphism phi is not injective. Let K consist of two disjoint points. Then lrck is a morphic graph algebra li factored by these relations where a equals mu1, mu2. This infinitely relations.
00:23:17.475 - 00:23:18.295, Speaker C: Okay.
00:23:23.795 - 00:24:24.355, Speaker B: Let K be a simplicial complex on set m. Let RCK be the right anglet coxial group corresponding to K and lrc k it's associated algebra. Then L1RCK has a basis like this L2.RCK has a basis consisting of the commutator like this with I less j and I j not. HCRC has a basis consisting of the commutators egg with ilsj for not edge egk e less j mok where I not equals k and I is a small vertex. In a connected component like this not containing t, we have correlation. Let K be a set of MD joint points.
00:24:24.355 - 00:24:47.365, Speaker B: Now then we have that RCK is M product FA product the 2. Then L1 has a basis like this. L2 has a basis consistent these commutators and LC has a basis consisting of this commutator with this.
00:24:49.985 - 00:24:50.805, Speaker C: Okay.
00:24:54.265 - 00:25:39.455, Speaker B: Now we have example. Consider simplicial complex on say vertices. Let k only say disjoint points. Then L, say RCK has a basis consisting of five commutators like this 4k with one edge on say vertices. LC RCK has a basis consisting of Seiko mutators and for k with edges. LCRCK is generated by the one commutator. Okay, I have else for minutes and quickly about proofing this theory we.
00:25:41.475 - 00:25:41.907, Speaker A: For.
00:25:41.971 - 00:26:33.815, Speaker B: Simplify notation LC without squeak gamma k without s k for easy notation L1 with this basis okay, we prove statement B this about commutators L2 we have a balinization map like this and this group ash1 is free abelian. Consider L2 is gamma2 by gamma. Say the group L2 is Z2 model and like this for some m from natural numbers we have a sequence of nested normal subgroups like this. Consider the exact sequence of abelian group groups like this.
00:26:38.035 - 00:26:38.895, Speaker C: Okay.
00:26:41.885 - 00:27:45.791, Speaker B: Echo from corollary that the free abelian group this factor is free abel group Z N has a basis consisting of the images of the iterated commutators with all different indices described in serum above. The images of the commutator of lunch mode or equals c are contained in the subcode gamma 3 by gamma 2 stroke like this, the group this also contains commutators of length C with duplicate indices of the form like this. Therefore, the homomorphism PC this gloomorphism acts by the this formula where induce is different elements and these elements with the condition on the indices. From theorem above it follows that Z2 model L2 has a basis consisting of the elements like this with I less.
00:27:45.863 - 00:27:46.475, Speaker C: J.
00:27:48.335 - 00:28:25.985, Speaker B: E and point B and I k. We prove statement C. Consider lc Gamma C by Gamma4. The Group LC is a Z2 model and we have the exact sequence of abelian group like groups like this. For the free aberrant group Gamma C by Gamma 2 stroke we will use the basis constructed in the proof of statement b. Elements of these basis corresponding to commutators of Lynch MO4 are contained in this. The group Gamma4 by Gamma2 Stroke also contains commutators of Lenge for VS indices.
00:28:25.985 - 00:28:51.875, Speaker B: These commutators have one of the following nine types A, B. For all commutators with these types we do formulas and formulas and okay.
00:28:54.695 - 00:28:55.079, Speaker C: Like.
00:28:55.127 - 00:29:25.805, Speaker B: This my time has ended. Okay, like this. Similarly statement B and get this homomorphism acts by these formulas and this and proof of statement c. Okay, this paper with these results and thank you for your attention.
