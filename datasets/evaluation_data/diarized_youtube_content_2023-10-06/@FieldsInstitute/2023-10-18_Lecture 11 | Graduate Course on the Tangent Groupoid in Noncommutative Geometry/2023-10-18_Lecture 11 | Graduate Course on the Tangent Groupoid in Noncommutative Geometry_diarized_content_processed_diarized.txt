00:00:08.920 - 00:01:06.730, Speaker A: So probably pretty little product here, but I should mention that basically all of this stuff is in the contents of two cougars, one by Eckhart, the other by Nigel. Eckhart also has these notes on the voids and the algebraic. Okay, so today we're, Nigel asked me to just talk about Euler like vector Fields. And so I'm assuming knew what he meant. And so I'm just going to do what I think he meant. But this is more or less like an application of the definitions. So the first thing, I just want to apologize because I don't know.
00:01:06.730 - 00:02:12.922, Speaker A: So let's, so let's, and let's let, I'm going to mostly use Nigel's notation, but there's one thing that I've been writing for so long, it's muscle memory. So I'm going to write notation. So I'm going to write new MN for the normal bundle. That's the only thing that I'll do. And the cost of this is that is, deformation in normal code is kind of ugly. Okay, so the first thing I want to do is basically the application that I have in mind is you have an Euler like microfilm, which I will define. Then you get a checklist neighborhood in quite a strong sense.
00:02:12.922 - 00:03:31.864, Speaker A: And so the strong sense that I want to sort of say is, well, the first thing I want to do is actually define what I mean by CEO of a neighborhood. So let's just, I'm going to recall, so recall. So this is true for any vector bundle but smooth vector bundle. But if I look at the tangent bundle of the normal bundle and I restrict it to nice, then we have a canonical decomposition as the normal bundle n is m plus the tangent model to n. And the way this sort of works is these things are realized as sort of the vectors normal, obviously, to n, the vertical vectors, and these are the sort of horizontal vectors. So in particular, n lives inside of the normal bundle of n and m as the zero section. And if I look at the normal bundle of the normal bundle, if I look at the normal bundle of n in the normal bundle, then I just have.
00:03:31.864 - 00:05:47.574, Speaker A: So hence, given a smooth map five going from the bubble bubble to the m, I get a map of what's all called new phi, which goes from the normal bundle of down n to the normal bundle. So how this works is, welL, just by functionality, this thing five gives me a map from the normal bundle of the normal bundles of m in the normal bundle. But it's naturally identified with this. And so I can think about like this, this is in some sense the linear approximation of the map. But in particular this, the following definition makes sense. A tubular neighborhood, maybe I'll put the words complete here of n and m is unembedded from here to here, such that one, if I take five and restrict it to n, it's equal to the identity. So in particular, it takes n to n and two, this linear approximation is the identity.
00:05:47.574 - 00:06:52.914, Speaker A: So this is sort of, uh, maybe not the standard definition of the tubular neighborhood that you would have seen, but it definitely applies to the more standard one, and it's stronger. It literally says that you have an embedding which takes n to nice, and it's like differential on vertical backgrounds. So TOdAy we're going to be talking about how these early life vector fields give you these things and any sort of, conversely, the inverse is kind of obvious. We have one of these. So what did we do last time? This declaration to the normal cone, this is notation that I was talking about. That is not so nice. Badly used to be an m not snapping.
00:06:52.914 - 00:07:54.374, Speaker A: We constructed this smooth manifold. The deformation to the normal cone, which comes with a surjective submersion I from this thing to arc, sort of like this t variable, inducing a set theoretic decomposition, which looks like this. So the reason I'm sort of mentioning this is a little bit of foreshadowing. A tubular neighborhood. It somehow connects the normal bundle and m. And, well, we have a manifold that does this for us. So it makes sense that somehow we should be looking at this thing.
00:07:54.374 - 00:09:22.156, Speaker A: The other thing is that it comes with this, so to speak, scaling action, which goes from r across this itself. Okay, and what is it? Well, given. Okay, so if lambda is an r. Okay, bad notation. But so there's sort of two types of points to consider. There's things in this m times r. So we have mt and this gets sent to m, e to the lambda t if t is not zero, and x m comma zero, that gets sent to e to the minus lambda xm zero.
00:09:22.156 - 00:09:52.084, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Like you asked, try to embed all the normal bundle in m and not just complete. Yeah, that's why I sort of included this word, complete. Yeah. I should also mention there's like a lot of completeness issues that I just not going to talk about, if you're interested. They're like discussed in the paper, but I'm not interested.
00:09:52.084 - 00:10:28.014, Speaker A: So, I mean, I'm interested from a point of view of someone who cares about things, but as someone who's trying to just tell you the story, I think it's kind of complicated. Yeah. So, yeah, in principle, you could ask for, like, less restrictive things where, like Paul says, you only want it to sort of like, be defined in some neighborhood of the zero section of the normal bundle. But yeah, if you use the adjective complete, then this is the word. Okay, so we have this. So in particular, this is an additive action of r. I mean, like, it's an action of the abelian group r.
00:10:28.014 - 00:12:22.184, Speaker A: And so in particular, it presents itself as the flow of some vector field. So let's let, let's let zed be the vector field with flow given by alpha. I'm using the letter z because the way that I know this action is from the Vanderpjunken paper, which they call it the zoom action. So z stands for the zoom vector field or the scaling vector field, if you want. Okay, so what is it? On m times r times z is given by dd by dt, and on the normal bundle, it is given, actually, by definition, by the negative, the Euler vector field, what do I mean by it's given? By definition, I mean that the Euler vector field is by definition the vector field whose flow is given by multiplication by e to the t. In some sense, it generates scalar multiplication. Well, in a precise sense, it generates multiplication.
00:12:22.184 - 00:13:16.544, Speaker A: But anyways, it's fine for me to say this, but let's actually write down some coordinates. So if this normal bundle is actually just a trivial vector bundle. So here, I mean, n is r to the n, and the normal bundle is, this is the vector bundle over r to the n. It's the trivial rank k bundle over r to the n with, with coordinates x and y. Okay, so what do I mean by with coordinates x? Y? I mean, x are coordinates on the r to the n, and the y's are the coordinates on the art of the case. So they're your vertical coordinates, your fiber coordinates. And if you pick these coordinates, then e is given by, oops, sorry, not x.
00:13:16.544 - 00:14:17.964, Speaker A: Oh, I've been watching with envy. Nigel, use this fancy eraser. Okay. By the way, coordinates with this property, like the x being basic coordinates and the y being fiber coordinates, I might in the future refer to as vector bundled coordinates, but you can always get them, and they're sort of like coordinates dual to a local frame. Okay, so why do I care about this? I mean, well, first of all, because it generates scalar multiplication, but the other thing is that the order vector field, it detects homogeneity. So here's a fact which you can prove. A smooth function on the normal bundle more generally, any vector bundle, any vector bundle always has the Euler vector field.
00:14:17.964 - 00:15:19.304, Speaker A: But a function is homogeneous of degree kick, let's say m, because I already used k homogeneous of degree m, if and only if. When I take the derivative with respect to the Euler vector field, I get f back times m. Okay, this is like an exercise. This, this is basically like Euler's homogeneous function theorem, if you're familiar with that. Yeah. Is it clear what I mean by, like, you have a function on a vector bundle which is homogeneous of degree m. Yeah, exactly.
00:15:19.304 - 00:16:02.346, Speaker A: Yeah. And yeah, you, you have a scalar multiplication, and it's homogeneous with respect to the scalar multiplication, more generally. Actually, I'm not going to write this down, but you can talk about homogeneity of vector fields, differential forms, k forms, and so on. And it's all expressed in terms of this Euler vector field and the lead derivative. So, like a vector field is homogeneous of the degree k, only if on a lead differentiate with respect to e, I get k times the vector field I started with. So, since, since, okay, I mentioned that the title of the talk is linearization theorems. And now I'm telling you, I have this vector field which sort of describes linearity.
00:16:02.346 - 00:16:47.324, Speaker A: So in particular, in particular, it's linear if and only if. When I take the leader, when I lead differentiate by the vector field, I get the function back. And since I want to discuss linearization theorems, I want some sort of Euler vector field for manifolds. Right? It makes sense because to sort of talk about linearity, it seems like I need this thing. Unfortunately, I don't have an Euler vector field because I don't have a scalar multiplication. In general, however, I can sort of observe something. So let's observe that if basically e preserves order of vanishing.
00:16:47.324 - 00:18:20.494, Speaker A: So observe that e. So if. So, if f vanishes to order m along n, then ef also vanishes to order f along or order m along n. This is just like local coordinate calculation. And if f vanishes to order m along n, then ef is equal to f modulo functions which vanish to order m plus one along n, where, okay, this is basically just like you apply this fact and Taylor's theorem. So, like in Taylor's theorem, you know that if it vanishes to some order, then you look at its first order, it's some sort of linear term plus, or some homogenous term plus something which vanishes to higher order. And then you do this and you wind up this.
00:18:20.494 - 00:19:02.864, Speaker A: But this fact can be written down for an arbitrary manifold. Right. This thing, this statement makes sense. Okay, so this fact that the Euler vector field determines homogeneity, this actually characterizes the Euler vector field. The second one doesn't. However, it's still pretty good, and it's good enough to give a definition. Okay, so definition, a vector field x in.
00:19:02.864 - 00:20:51.172, Speaker A: So maybe, let me say this, I'm going to do this and say in words, I only ever want to talk about embedded submanifolds. Okay? So whenever I say sub manifold, I mean embedded, not immersed or anything else, it's just embedded. A vector field on m is called Euler like along. And if, what's the definition? If it's, I think it's just this if role f, which vanishes to order mistake along n xf equals m times f plus higher order terms. I'll make sure I got that right. Yeah. Okay, so I gave this definition, let's sort of see what it looks like in local coordinates, going really fast.
00:20:51.172 - 00:22:12.134, Speaker A: So I'm going to slow down a little bit. Okay, are there any questions so far? So I've been rambling for 20 minutes. Okay, so, okay, I gave this definition, but like, let's sort of see what it looks like. So, one of the reasons why I like embedded sub manifolds is that I can choose submanifold coordinates. Okay, so suppose if x and y are local sub manifold coordinates, and that's for m or for n. And what I mean by this is that. So why is it true, this one? Yeah.
00:22:12.134 - 00:23:00.544, Speaker A: Do you believe this? So, like, what does it mean to vanish to order Microsoft n? It means that if I take any collection of n minus one vector fields and apply it, I get something which vanishes still. So if f is in here, then ef in local coordinates, it's the sum of y df by dyi. But this vanishes to order. Now, m minus one, and this vanishes to order one. So their sum or their product manages to order m. So that tells you that you live in there. And then Taylor's theorem tells you that.
00:23:00.544 - 00:24:06.884, Speaker A: Taylor's theorem tells you that if you vanish to order m, then you're equal to some sum like this, where this thing vanishes to order m plus one. And this thing is homogeneous of order k. So if I apply the Euler vector to it, I get ef, but then this just gives me k times this plus some higher order thing. But that's just f modulus and higher order thing. Yeah, good question. These are all these things I worked out over the weekend where I was like, why is that the case? Okay, but let's see what these things look like in sort of local coordinates. So when I say submanifold coordinates for n, okay, I'm being lazy here, but I mean, n is given by the vanishing of the y's.
00:24:06.884 - 00:25:17.454, Speaker A: It's not technically correct. Okay? The x's and the y's are defined in some neighborhood or some point. And n, interesting. Anyways, n is given by the vanishing. So if that's the case, then x is Euler like if and only if it looks like this. So I have some, some directions which are tangent to n, and I have some directions which are sort of normal to n. And I want this one to look like yj already used f dj.
00:25:17.454 - 00:27:40.314, Speaker A: Okay? But not just like that, where f I of x zero zero. So f vanishes along n and g zero to order two. So it's whether like if and only if, when you pick sub manifold coordinates for n, it looks like this, where the coefficients in front of the dx's vanish along n. And the coefficients in front of the dy's look like this, where the g's vanish to order two along n. So in particular, in particular, if it is just a point, then x is euler like. Basically, if it looks like the Euler vector field to higher order. Okay, does that make sense? This is just to sort of like ground us.
00:27:40.314 - 00:28:15.970, Speaker A: So these. Yeah, in particular, the Euler vector field is Euler like. This first condition also tells you in particular that it's tangent to n. Because if I plug any point in n in while the f's vanish, well, it's zero, it vanishes along n. So in particular, it's tangent to n. Any questions? Hi, Dan. I have a question about the condition for the f ice.
00:28:15.970 - 00:28:53.986, Speaker A: Can you just elaborate why we need it to be zero there? Yeah, I thought about this. Basically, all of this is like local coordinate calculations. So, like, if you plug, if you look at the definition to get the condition for the GIS and the f's, you can just evaluate at yi. Like if you just plug in Y I, you find that. But then the question is, how do I do this for the GIS? And so for that, you can just take a product like you look at x I yi, and it spits out this property for the f's. Okay, does that make sense? I think so, yeah. I have to go through the calculation to know it for myself, I think, but.
00:28:53.986 - 00:29:14.594, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's what I did, and it worked. So maybe I made a mistake. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, this should be m. Yeah, that's correct. Sorry.
00:29:14.594 - 00:29:52.450, Speaker A: Disgusting eraser. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly like. Well, let's find out. So what have I talked about so far? I've discussed tubular neighborhoods, then I've discussed Euler like, vector fields. And what do we like to do in math? We like to say, here's property a.
00:29:52.450 - 00:30:18.384, Speaker A: Here's property b. Actually, they're the same property. So here's sort of like the punchline. And this. This what I'm going to write down again. Bear with me. I don't know if it's 100% correct, because I'm sweeping a whole lot of completeness issues under the rug, but we strive for beauty and not Christmas.
00:30:18.384 - 00:31:11.394, Speaker A: Okay, so this is correct. Modulosum adjectives. But this is the way it's stated, I think, in Eckhard's lecture notes. So, okay, so this is a theorem due to. I actually don't really know how to pronounce this. Bursin, Lima and Meinranken in 2016. And then also Nigel and his student Amadorza, who has five names in 2018.
00:31:11.394 - 00:31:45.494, Speaker A: So it was. It was first, maybe just like a bit of the history, it was first sort of proved by these three authors. And then another proof was given by Amad, Reza, and Nigel, where they sort of make use of the deformation to the normal cone. So, yeah, so, like I say, we've talked about tubular neighborhoods. We've talked about Euler, like vector fields. Paul asked me if they can always be linearized, and the answer is yes. So the theorem is this.
00:31:45.494 - 00:32:09.070, Speaker A: And this is sort of a weak form of the theorem. I'm going to write it down, and then I'm going to sort of maybe say something a little bit more. So, if X. Let. Let m be a sub metaphor. Okay. Embedded.
00:32:09.070 - 00:33:08.814, Speaker A: Whatever. If X is a vector field on M, is Euler, like, along nice. Then there is a. There is a unique tubular neighborhood embedding by from normal bundle M. Let me. Let me put complete here. Just so it's correct.
00:33:08.814 - 00:33:53.474, Speaker A: There's a. Okay, so there is a tubular neighborhood. But more than that, such that. Okay, I'm going to write down a diagram, and then I'm going to just sort of say something else such that the following diagram. Okay, so this is like what Paul was saying. So what kind of information do we have? We can look at smooth functions on m and we can differentiate them with respect to x. On the other hand, we have smooth functions on the normal bundle, which we can differentiate with respect to e.
00:33:53.474 - 00:35:14.070, Speaker A: And the point is that this tubular neighborhood embedding intertwines them. That's bad. Another way, like, if you're more used to differential geometry, I wasn't really sure to what extent people are comfortable with it, but this diagram just means that in words, the diagram means that e is related to x via phi. So, like, we can, we typically denote this type of thing by that notation, right? So, like in you, like, there's this sort of like, problem with vector fields that you can't push them forward just because you like. For, in general, for sections of vector bundles, you can't push them forward unless you have a diffeomorphism. Um, so the next best thing you can do is sort of like formally push them forward. This is sort of like this language of, uh, well, you can't formally push them forward, but you can pretend as if you could.
00:35:14.070 - 00:36:07.824, Speaker A: And this is what this language related vector fields means. It literally just means this diagram, which means. Okay, so let's, uh, before we, before we prove this, I like to sort of like show the worth of a theorem. Before we prove it. Um, let's sort of see, like, what this says. The very lowbrow thing is what Paul was saying. So for m, or I guess for, for n equals a point, this says that Euler, like, vector fields can always be linearized.
00:36:07.824 - 00:37:41.204, Speaker A: And what that means is that it's exactly what Paul was saying. There's some coordinate system near this point under which the Euler like vector field is the Euler vector field. In that coordinate system, that is, one can find coordinates x near the point is m, or, sorry, n, such that. And so this is like the property of whether or not, like, the problem of whether or not a vector field can be linearized is pretty subtle, and it's pretty hard. I mean, like, let's think about what a vector field is. A vector field is a system of differential equations. And so what you're doing is you're saying you can always find a coordinate system such that your system of differential equations is a linear differential equation.
00:37:41.204 - 00:39:00.294, Speaker A: And this is extremely nice, because we know how to solve linear differential equations. Let's look at a really basic example. This one's for all the people who want to fact check me. So if m is r squared n is the origin, then the vector field x x d by dx plus y plus x squared d by dy is Euler, like with respect to the origin. Well, it satisfies this, right? So this one is like bang on Euler, and this one is Euler plus something, which vanishes to order two at the origin so this one's Euler like. So this theorem in particular tells us that I can find some coordinate system such that this vector field is the Euler vector field on r squared. And in this case, you can actually find it.
00:39:00.294 - 00:39:53.824, Speaker A: So, exercise. This is one of these things. I was talking to Eckhard last night just to make sure I wasn't going to, actually, I'll make a note of that. I was talking to Eckhart last night, and I was just making sure that I knew what I was talking about for this. And he recommended that I give this example. And then he was just like, yeah, you can even find the explicit change of coordinates. And so I was like, yeah, yeah, sure.
00:39:53.824 - 00:40:16.884, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. And then I, like, finished. And I was like, how do I do that? And I thought to myself, well, what a, what a. What did the differential equations people do when they're solving equations? They just guess. And so that's what I did. But, yeah, you can find them. Are there any questions about this? You.
00:40:16.884 - 00:40:40.600, Speaker A: Yeah. So here, all of my coefficients are the Y's. Yeah. So x would be y one and y would be y two. Yeah. Because the submarine, like standard coordinates for r squared are the submanifold coordinates for the origin. So.
00:40:40.600 - 00:41:02.778, Speaker A: And the origin is given by the vanishing of the two. So, yeah, this case is. This case. So it would be y one, y one is x, and in this case, the g one would be nothing, and the y two is y. And in this case, the g two would be x squared. Yeah. Actually, interestingly enough, yeah.
00:41:02.778 - 00:41:39.574, Speaker A: I should also mention there are examples of vector fields which cannot be linearized. I don't know any off the top of my head, but one doesn't have to look very far. Okay, so I'm going to give another proposition there. And Eckhart has a whole paper giving tons of applications of this theorem, which is extremely nice. And it's kind of thrilling. How applicable. This theorem is sort of motivated by a comment that Nigel gave, I guess, in his paper with Amada reza.
00:41:39.574 - 00:42:27.252, Speaker A: But let's sort of see another example. So this is the Morse lemma. So I'm going to claim that the Morse lemma is a consequence of this theorem. So, let's briefly recall what the Morse lemma is if f in c infinity r to the n. Let me say it like this. Okay, so the morse lemma is generally true for any manifold, but you can, it's about finding local coordinates. So you might as well just assume it's r to the.
00:42:27.252 - 00:43:54.800, Speaker A: Nice. So if zero is a non degenerate critical point or fucking. Then there exist coordinates on for near defined near the origin near zero in which f is quadratic. Okay, you might have seen that the Morse lemma, like, more classically says that it's like a sum of plus one x x squareds and minus one x squared. But this in particular says that it's a quadratic form and it's a non degenerate quadratic form. And so there's like this standard linear algebra argument which says you can always make it go to this form, so it's sufficient to show that it's quadratic. Okay, so let's see, let's see how this works.
00:43:54.800 - 00:45:10.904, Speaker A: So claim to prove this, it is sufficient to find an Euler like vector field with respect to the origin. Yeah. Okay, so I'm using slightly different terminology, hopefully. You know what I mean? I'm saying it's Euler like with respect to the origin. It means it's oiler like along the origin. But it kind of feels funny to say that it has property a along a single point. Okay, that's not, that's not good enough, because if it was, I would just take the Euler vector field with respect to the origin such that an Euler like vector field x such that xf is equal to twice f.
00:45:10.904 - 00:46:24.504, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the claim. I'm going to leave this up. Don't let me delete that. So I'm making this claim. And let me just explain why. Why by the theorem, there exists an embedding phi going from the normal bundle of r to the n with the origin, which is just the tangent space at the origin, which is just r to the n to r to the n. Right? This is the tubular neighborhood embedding such that, yeah, this formula holds phi star of x is equal to e of phi star.
00:46:24.504 - 00:46:53.664, Speaker A: Hence. So I'm thinking of phi, by the way, as my change of coordinates. Phi is the map from r to the n to some open neighborhood of r to the n. And that's what it means. That's the, by definition change of coordinates. You have some coordinate system near the origin. And to show that it's quadratic, right? Well, I need to show that if I apply the Euler vector field to f using this coordinate system, I get twice f.
00:46:53.664 - 00:47:31.240, Speaker A: But this, what, what is f in this coordinate system? It's just phi f. This is f in this coordinate system, guaranteed by the theorem. And the fact that the diagram commutes means that I can swap phi and e. So it's phi xf. But I've chosen x so that it's just twice f. So this is twice phi f, but this is what it means for phi f to be quadratic. But phi f is f in this change of coordinates.
00:47:31.240 - 00:48:14.104, Speaker A: Okay, so if I can find this, then I've proven the Morse lemma. And so, okay, let me also emphasize that finding Euler like vector fields is not easy, but it's sort of nice to be able to characterize things in terms of Euler vector fields. Or they're like vector fields. Sorry. Okay. By the way, I'm for this theorem. I'm really just using this sort of like smaller thing.
00:48:14.104 - 00:48:53.044, Speaker A: But anyway, so let's erase. Okay, so how do we find this Euler like vector field? It's very clever. So by Taylor's theorem, this, by the way, this argument is not due to me, it's due to Eckhard. Just to be explicit, by Taylor's theorem. Okay, so choose coordinates. Actually, I'm already on r to the n. I already have coordinates.
00:48:53.044 - 00:49:43.484, Speaker A: So by Taylor's theorem, we're sort of getting a sense in this course that everything is just Taylor's theorem. Right. So by Taylor's theorem, I can write f in this way. So, sorry, I'm using like superscript and subscript, sort of interchangeably. These x's are, these xi's. And xjs are my coordinates on r to the n. And where x goes to a of x, it is a smooth map into symmetric matrices.
00:49:43.484 - 00:50:14.474, Speaker A: Okay, so how do you do this? Well, Taylor's theorem tells you what it looks like because it has a critical point. The first order terms all vanish because it vanishes at the origin, which I didn't write down. But it is the case. It can always be arranged. The 0th order parts also vanish. So I'm just left with quadratic terms up to some higher thing. And so you kind of shovel the higher things into the a and you make it symmetric.
00:50:14.474 - 00:50:53.526, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, I want to do I, no, I don't want to leave that up. It's not that I don't want to leave it up, but I don't care. Okay, so again, this is just calculus. But one has that. Okay, again, this is just calculus. Df by dxj.
00:50:53.526 - 00:52:07.876, Speaker A: If I take the derivative of f with respect to xj, then according to this expression, this is equal to a sum a b of x jk x k, where bjk is equal to a jk plus one half the sum over r. Sorry for all this, but you know how it goes. A x r. Okay, product rule. Basically, product rule and being careful. Um, in particular, um, in particular, uh, b zero equals a zero. Actually, I think this matrix is the.
00:52:07.876 - 00:52:42.224, Speaker A: Is it the hessian? I'm not sure. Is it the matrix of second derivatives? Or. Anyways, at zero? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, in any case, non degeneracy tells you, as Paul is saying, at zero, a is invertible. So in particular, b at zero is invertible, and therefore it's invertible near zero.
00:52:42.224 - 00:54:09.364, Speaker A: So hence is invertible for small x. No epsilons. I'm not, I'm not taking up any of the epsilons from Nigel's two year quota. Okay, well, what does this afford us? So let's define x is sum over ij of a of x v of x inverse ij xi, or. Sorry. Keep it consistent. Okay, so this is some vector field.
00:54:09.364 - 00:55:01.684, Speaker A: It's a vector field on r to the n, right? Because b of zero is a of zero. That means that if I plug in zero to this thing, I just get the identity, right? So that means that for x sufficiently small, this thing is the identity plus some higher order terms. In particular, it's Euler like, right? Because it's the identity times the xi plus higher order terms. And that's exactly what Euler like vector fields are. So. So I have my other, like, vector field. I have this condition.
00:55:01.684 - 00:56:00.104, Speaker A: I just need to check. And let's just check it and xf, okay? I don't want it to be two f plus higher order. I want it to be two f on the nose. Right? But we can just figure this out. So xf is this sum over ij of fucking a of x b of x, inverse ij x I d f by dx j. Lucky for y'all, I have a formula. Uh, so what is it? Oh, there's all these things.
00:56:00.104 - 00:56:22.208, Speaker A: And it equals two f. I checked this last night, I promise. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you get without the half. So you just get twice.
00:56:22.208 - 00:56:58.984, Speaker A: Fucking. Well, you don't. The point is, is that we're only asking for coordinates, like, near the origin. Yeah, because, I mean, the Morse lemma isn't like a global thing, right? The Morse lemma isn't saying there's coordinates on all of r to the n. It's just saying there's some, like, neighborhood of zero. And the neighborhood of zero, I guess, is the neighborhood where this thing exists. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:58.984 - 00:57:18.540, Speaker A: I guess technically on all of r to the end, yeah. I mean, you know, it's defined on some ball near the origin. You can choose a diffeomorphism from that small ball to all of it. And. Okay, if you want. But, yeah. Okay, good.
00:57:18.540 - 00:57:58.672, Speaker A: So this is kind of amazing. I want to sort of, like, emphasize one way that I think about this theorem, which I've now erased. Um, so let's talk about maybe some other, um, applications. Are you guys familiar with, um, what a symplectic form is? So, a symplectic form on a manifold is just a closed, non degenerate two form. So there's this theorem which says. It's called Darbus theorem. What it says is that near any point, you can always find some coordinates so that it basically just looks d looks like DX wedge dy.
00:57:58.672 - 00:58:34.156, Speaker A: Right. This is also a consequence of this theorem. There's even fancier linearization theorems, which are also consequences of this theorem. But the reason why I want to mention this, first of all, this Morse lemma, and second of all, this Darbu theorem, is because if you look up proofs, they always use this Moser trick. So basically you need like, a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms and blah, blah, blah. Truthfully, I've never actually seen a proof other than this way. I just know that people say, buy some Moser trick.
00:58:34.156 - 00:59:40.668, Speaker A: And I go, okay, so in some sense, this theorem is like a packaged Moser trick. You don't have to say, using some Moser's trick, you can say, buy this theorem in some sense, just as like a selling point for more exotic Euler like vector fields, one can ask, what about contact structures? So, contact structures are base. So it's a basic fact that if you have a symplectic manifold, then it's necessarily even dimensional. So a contact structure is somehow like an odd dimensional cousin of symplectic structures. It's given either by what's called a contact one form, or, yeah, so to speak, totally non integrable hyperplane distribution, whatever that means. But there's a Darbu theorem for that, too. And one can ask, does this theorem work there? And one needs something other than the normal bundle, something which is similar to the normal bundle, but not quite.
00:59:40.668 - 01:00:27.464, Speaker A: And, yeah, I'll leave it at that. Okay, so are there any questions about this? Are we kind of sold that? It's a cool thing? I mean, we just proved this Morse lemma. How many of you have seen a proof of the Morse lemma? Yeah, exactly. Actually, all of you should have raised your hands because you just saw one. But prior to ten minutes ago, so. Yeah. Pardon? Well, somehow you're like, when, like the way you prove this tubular neighborhood theorem, that's sort of like a Moser trick in some sense.
01:00:27.464 - 01:00:53.994, Speaker A: So you're sort of like just turning the trick into some sort of machinery which you can. Black box. Yeah. So I should also mention that, like, actually finding these vector fields is difficult, like, as you can sort of see from this process. But. Okay, so there's half an hour left. I'm not sure if I'll take the entire half hour, but that's okay.
01:00:53.994 - 01:01:49.114, Speaker A: I'm not like other props. I'm school proc or instructor. Okay, so how do we, how do we prove this? How to prove. So, okay, I didn't state the theorem in its, like, full generality. Actually, the way it works is you have to talk about like, germs of tubular neighborhoods and germs of euler, like, vector fields. And there's a one to one correspondence between the two and. But I don't know.
01:01:49.114 - 01:02:40.776, Speaker A: But this proof that I'm going to sort of sketch, and I emphasize the word sketch, this is due to Nigel and Amadoriza, whose last name I actually don't know how to pronounce. Shishi, do you know? Shishi also doesn't know, and they're academic brothers, so. Okay, so let's just sort of like think morally how this kind of works. I'm not going to write anything down because it's not right. But I mean, honestly, that's never stopped me before. But I feel like I've had a reawakening. So a tubular neighborhood, in some vague sense, connects the normal bundle of some sub manifold and the sort of ambient manifold, right? Well, we already sort of have a mechanism that does that, right? We have this deformation to the normal cone.
01:02:40.776 - 01:03:26.024, Speaker A: It's like a family of m's and then one copy of the normal bundle. So it sort of begs to reason, okay, well, I have some sort of device that connects these already. Is there a way that I can do something with this? So can I think of a diffeomorphism, for instance, of this bundle which shifts fibers? Okay, one guess, right, because this would be nice. Like, if I could somehow shift the fibers, then in particular, I could shift the fiber at zero off of zero. But as soon as I've done this, I'm taking the normal bundle to m. Okay, so then we think, well, how do I get diffeomorphisms of manifolds? Oftentimes they present themselves as flows of vector fields. Well, not oftentimes, but one way you can do this.
01:03:26.024 - 01:04:09.852, Speaker A: And so we should think, okay, now I kind of want to think about vector fields on this deformation to the normal cone. And since I want everything to sort of be pushed off, well, one idea is maybe I could look at this d by dt, right? Because that literally points in the direction away. However, the issue is that the d by Dt doesn't extend to the whole deformation to the normal cone. There's this problem at zero. However, t d by dt does, right? We saw it. Td by tt is the vector field coming from the scaling action. So we think to ourselves, well, maybe we'll be in business.
01:04:09.852 - 01:04:37.364, Speaker A: However, the issue is that at zero, it's the Euler vector field for the normal bundle. Okay, but this is actually not good, right? At least it extends. But it's not good because in particular, at zero, it's tangent to the fibers. So if I flowed, it wouldn't move. It would just move me up the fiber. So then we think, okay, this is maybe not so good. However, I know that euler like vector fields are linearizable.
01:04:37.364 - 01:05:14.842, Speaker A: In particular, if I apply one thing I haven't written down, but I'll explain in coordinates. If I apply this normal functor to an Euler like vector field, this gives me a vector field on the normal bundle. And the Euler like property tells me that it is the Euler vector field. So when I apply the normal functor to an Euler like vector field, I get the Euler vector field. Okay, so now we're looking pretty good because I have this one thing which extends to the Euler vector field. I have this other thing which. Okay, I know that, like, functions on m sometimes extend and sort of, they extend to somehow their linear approximation, whatever.
01:05:14.842 - 01:05:49.544, Speaker A: I have this. So it sort of begs to reason, well, maybe if I had an euler like vector field, it would extend, and if it extends, then it would have to sort of extend by the Euler vector field on the zero fiber. Okay, well, now I'm in business because I have one thing that extends to negative the Euler vector field, something else that extends to the Euler vector field. So their sum will extend by zero. And if their sum extends by zero, then in particular, I can divide by t, and it still extends by Taylor's theorem. But when I do this again, we'll write all this down. I'm just trying to, like, prime you.
01:05:49.544 - 01:06:31.644, Speaker A: I have some vector field plus d by dt. So I have this, this term d by dt, which now pushes me off the zero fiber, and then I'm in business. Okay? So that, that's sort of like the cliff notes, the Khan Academy version of this argument. And then I'm going to give the also Khan Academy version of this argument. And if you want the real version of this argument, you should look at the paper that Ahmad reza wrote with Nigel. Thank you, haj saeedi Sade. Okay, I appreciate that.
01:06:31.644 - 01:06:57.308, Speaker A: Yeah, it was kind of funny. So Eckhart and I have, like, cited him a bunch, and we always just say, hajj Higson. And then I saw him speak at the CMS, and he said, haj Saeedi say. And then I was like, oh, no, I'm sorry. Which one is it? And he was like, oh, actually, it's kind of my fault. Like I told Eckhart, it's just hajj. So anyways, so let's sort of explain what I just said.
01:06:57.308 - 01:08:40.736, Speaker A: But this is sort of the point. So recall that x in an m is Euler like along n. If in submanifold coordinates for n, x looks like this. I'm sorry to the Australians, but every time I write to order, I mix the two up and I write tar, and it makes me think an Australian saying no. Okay, where do I put my fancy eraser? Okay, so we have this coordinate expression, and let's think. Well, in the coordinate this, this defines a vector field on m cross r times. Right.
01:08:40.736 - 01:09:16.434, Speaker A: There's just no t part. Okay. But we have this coordinate change, which allows us to think about this as an open subset of the deformation to the normal cone using the DNC coordinate change. So how does this work? T is just t x. Twiddle is just x, but the y. Twiddles are one over t times y. That's what it is.
01:09:16.434 - 01:10:12.164, Speaker A: And if you write down what this vector field is using this coordinate change, x becomes. Okay, so what do we have? Well, the x's don't change, but the y's become t y. Twiddles. The d by dx's are the same as the d by dxi's. You can check plus sum over j. Okay, the y's become t y twiddle. Plus gj x twiddle, ty twiddle.
01:10:12.164 - 01:11:02.124, Speaker A: And one can check that. D by dyj becomes one over t. D by dyj twiddle. But in particular, this is just the sum over I f I of x. Twiddle. That's y. I mean, it's an x, but it should be y.
01:11:02.124 - 01:11:41.850, Speaker A: Okay, and observe that if we take p to zero, there's nothing that goes wrong here, except the second component goes to zero. But because it's euler like fx, zero is zero. So this part just dies. There's no y's, there's no t here, so there's nothing. We have this one over t, g x. Twiddle, ty twiddle. But the g's vanish to order two when x is, when y is zero.
01:11:41.850 - 01:14:10.584, Speaker A: So this just converges to which is the Euler vector field on the normal bundle. Okay, so that's pretty nifty. So hence, now let's recall the scaling vector field z, which is given by the scaling action, right? Which has the property that z restricted to the fiber at t. Okay, this is maybe not so good, but it's tdt, t is not zero, and it's minus the Euler vector field if t is zero, hence x plus z. This vector field restricted to t equals zero is the zero vector field. Okay, well, what does this imply? That is, okay, x plus t d by dt. As a vector field on m cross r extends, sorry, extends by zero to the deformation to the normal cone.
01:14:10.584 - 01:15:24.194, Speaker A: So w, which is one over t times this thing extends to a vector field on the deformation on here. It seems kind of funny. It always bothers me when you see these expressions and you're saying, oh yeah, it extends to t equals zero. It does. Now this is what I was sort of saying. If we look at this, okay, we have this d by dt, which is what we are hoping for, right? Because this is the thing that's going to push us off the fibers at the expense of this thing. But this is tangent to the fibers, right? So it's not going to prevent it from pushing us from fiber to fiber.
01:15:24.194 - 01:16:21.164, Speaker A: How do we make that formal? Happy to make that formal. Well, note that, okay, this vector field w is related by a PI to d by dt. So this is like this notation that I was talking about earlier. We can't push vector fields forward, but if it can be pushed forward, it still makes sense to talk about it. Or if there's something which formally acts as though is a push forward. Um, and yeah, if you just check this is true, and the reason why it's true is because x is tangent to the fibers of t, so it just projects to zero. And the d by dt obviously sort of projects to d by dt.
01:16:21.164 - 01:18:02.534, Speaker A: Hence, if phi s is the flow of w by time s, okay, then by s takes the fiber at t to the fiber at t plus s. And that's just because that's what d by dt does. The flow of d by dt is s plus x. Okay, sure. But in particular, it shifts fibers by however long you flow for. So if we flow for time s, we've shifted off by time s or by s, and hence by one in particular goes from the normal bundle to m, because it goes from the zero fiber to the fiber at time one. Okay, so, yeah, okay, there's like some completeness issues, right? Like, why can I flow everything? Time one, why is it defined on the whole zero section of the normal bundle? This is explained by Nigel and Amadriza, but you can do it.
01:18:02.534 - 01:18:48.866, Speaker A: The other thing is that if I apply the normal functor to phi s, it turns out, and I think about it as a map from the zero fiber to the s fiber. This in particular gives me a map from the normal bundle to the normal bundle. Like, after applying the normal functor, and Amada, Raza and Nigel show that this map is s times the identity. So that's why I have to flow by time one, right? Because in my definition of a tubular neighborhood, I wanted the normal approximation of the embedding to be the identity. So I have to flow by time one in order for that to work. So this gives us our tubular neighborhood. We just flow by time one.
01:18:48.866 - 01:19:50.094, Speaker A: There's this other thing I have to show, namely that it takes the Euler vector field to my Euler like vector field that I started with, and that's another sort of easy consequence. Also note that x commutes with w. It's enough to check on the open, dense m cross r times, and you can just check in coordinates, right? X commutes with itself. It has no t part, so it commutes with d by dt as well. So they just commute and they commute everywhere. And it's just a fact that this implies that phi s star of e then equals x. So in particular, if I flow by time one, I get x back.
01:19:50.094 - 01:20:37.036, Speaker A: So by one to n is the required. That's a g tv like neighborhood. And as Nigel would say, I'm going to call that proved. So I think it's like, obviously, I don't know. May I be as. So maybe, may I be as bold as to say that the idea is very natural? I think there are, like a lot of details that require checking. And as it often is, I don't know.
01:20:37.036 - 01:21:05.574, Speaker A: I think the details are maybe not that easy to check, but they are checkable. And. Yeah, but this is the idea. Basically, the Euler like vector field allows you to extend d by DT to the deformation to the normal cone in this way. And that allows us to push off the zero fiber. And that's basically the idea as far as I can tell, that that's how I understand it. Um, technicality.
01:21:05.574 - 01:21:37.814, Speaker A: Yeah. So first of all, like, yeah, I mean, it's a sketch. I mean, like, so what, yeah, what does one need to prove? There's like the, the completeness issues. So, like, you need to make sure that. Yeah, just because it could be the case that somehow, like, the time for, you have to be able to flow four time one along the entire zero section. Right. So, okay.
01:21:37.814 - 01:22:06.284, Speaker A: That's something that needs to be checked. And the other thing is that when I apply the normal functor to this, I actually get s times the identity. That's something that needs to be checked as well. And the way that Nigel and Ahmad Reza do it is like, basically they consider, they rig up some differential equation and show that it's zero. And so they say, okay, it's constant and it's constant. And like, sorry. They show that.
01:22:06.284 - 01:22:25.604, Speaker A: They compute the adjoint of this. And they say s inverse times phi s adjoint, like as a map from the normal point at m to itself. This is constant in s. That's what they show. And then they compute it basically at s equals zero. Find that it's the identity. And so they say, okay, well, since s inverse.
01:22:25.604 - 01:23:01.654, Speaker A: Yeah, so that, that's another technicality. But I think, yeah, I was like reading this and I was like, how am I gonna explain this? And then I was like, I'm just not going to. Yeah, so I think it's quite beautiful. And I want to sort of like emphasize that, like these Euler like vector fields. Eckhart has an entire paper giving applications like this morse lemma to much more exotic cases. Like, for instance, linearization of properly groupoids and stuff, which is things geometers care about. So it's super useful.
01:23:01.654 - 01:23:35.904, Speaker A: I think historically, I think Eckhart mentioned something like, Nigel mentions the Darbu theorem in his paper with Amadraza, but doesn't like, do any details. And this is sort of what kicked some of these linearization theorems off. But, yeah, so anyways, are there any other questions? Yeah. Cool. Yeah, so this proofs due to Amadriza and Nigel and. Yeah, okay, so that's, that's all I have to say.
