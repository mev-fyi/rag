So welcome Joshua.
00:02:13.580 - 00:02:47.514, Speaker A: In fact, if we could just, do you mind just spotlighting, I was going to ask Sarah to help us out on this. If you could just spotlight Shana please, and Rebecca Clementine as well. I don't know if we can put them all on screen. And Rebecca, that would be great. Let's get you all assembled in this interesting virtual space. Thank you. So perhaps, Michael, if you don't mind, I would really like it if you were able to just start with giving your thoughts on the presentations and how it links or ties in with your experiences at Alberta.
00:02:48.894 - 00:03:51.164, Speaker B: Thanks Sarah. And I'm so thrilled to, to listen to all these talks and especially Roseanne's talk on the survey and those data and also behavior changes. Rebecca talks about. I was doing throughout the epidemic, the pandemic. My group was in the middle of the public health response, providing the data support. We got really good collaboration going on with Alberta House and they would, Kim Siemens, who was the panel on the first theme, she was the knowledge translation. She would have translated the public health questions to us into modeling questions and then, so that we can understand what exactly they're asking for, so that we, our groups would meet twice a week and just looking at the questions and started designing models and run it.
00:03:51.164 - 00:04:42.148, Speaker B: And then we report the results back to Kim, Kim and with others, which translate again back to something that the policymaker of public health policymakers and that would all kind of filter into the public health recommendations to the cabinet somewhere. The problem occurred between the current communication between public health and policymakers. Sometimes there are recommendations that ignore. I think that is not unique to Alberta and sure happened to all jurisdictions, but we try to do our diligence. We use the models and we use all the data we can get. But then COVID is very new. There is no past data, there's no past information.
00:04:42.148 - 00:05:24.504, Speaker B: We can only rely on the data that's coming. And so, and then we make a lot of mistakes. If you try to predict the peak, we see we're hugely over projection, projecting the peak time, the peak, peak height, peak time. And we had a very good experience, six year experience predicting influenza, seasonal influenza in Alberta. Using the data, we, for six years we precisely predict the week the peak will occur and also how high the peak cases are. One month ahead of the peak actually happened. So we were really confident about that.
00:05:24.504 - 00:06:13.324, Speaker B: But then the COVID we have influence. Of course, you have past seasons, ten seasons of the data to inform you what's going to happen typically during the seasonal influence. So that's a challenge. And then after a couple of weeks waves later, we have some old data we were able to build into the model and then we can actually predict forward for one month ahead. We can tell the operative health one. Even in the Omicron case, we were able to tell them one month ago that now is the peak time it's going to come down, even though you couldn't tell that much from the case detection. And so, and the key there is the human behavior.
00:06:13.324 - 00:07:51.522, Speaker B: If we don't build that into the human behavior, our standard models always seems to tend to overestimate and also the kind of the human behavior we put in this only part of it is, we call it health seeking behavior, is that when the individual have certain symptoms how likely this individual will go for help, to see a doctor, to get tested and that we actually have data to inform us for that. And then there is another type of behavior that's more discussed in today's talks is we call the self regulating behavior. That has to do with how you, how people likely to kind of adhere, let's say hygiene and face masking, social distancing, those times so that hugely kind of reduce your transmission. And then we find out that we actually realize that these types of behavior changes during the epidemic, that temporal pattern is very important. The standard models are typically using a constant parameter value for different things and you basically taking the average of a temporally changing coefficients and that usually creates over projections. And so we were, I was hoping someone would tell me how, what kind of data is there so that we could inform ourselves. Self regulating target.
00:07:51.522 - 00:08:04.114, Speaker B: So this is fantastic. This is exactly the kind of data we've been searching and that would greatly help us to improve the modeling. So I was very, very excited. That's my passion for social behavior.
00:08:07.894 - 00:08:58.612, Speaker A: Thank you, Michael. I think that does, I think all the presentations actually aligned with that. This risk of, and especially over projecting and then losing the trust so the modelers gain trust, just like you had with flu, that people thought, okay, we know what's going to happen this flu season, and then getting it wrong with COVID sort of crying wolf and saying it's going to be extreme. Interestingly, I think we've seen, we have had an impact in Ontario, where the modeling and the science, we have the scientific advisory table are actually listened to by a lot of people, even when the government doesn't necessarily respond to what these results are. And I think we see this health seeking behavior among the population who are listening to those broadcasts and those bi weekly reports. And so that affects their models. They made a projection based on current circumstances.
00:08:58.612 - 00:09:41.856, Speaker A: And even if the government doesn't implement any controls at that time, we start to see a change in people's behavior as they know there's more risk out there and they choose to stay at home or change their plans. And I think in this pandemic, because of the availability of data, we will actually be able to see retrospectively what impact modeling has had on actually lessening. You know, we think of the classic flattening the curve. How many people in Canada had no idea what modeling was all about. And we're all busy flattening the curve in the first wave. I mean, this is incredible. And this is a real, you know, indication of how human behavior could actually you know, elongate perhaps the rate at which we got it went over a longer time, but at least that we had time to prepare ourselves and get masks and do those sort of things.
00:09:41.856 - 00:09:55.944, Speaker A: So really interesting stuff. Joshua, I just wanted to give you a chance, as you're here, to maybe comment on the on and maybe direct a couple of questions as well. Josh, I think you're still on mute if you want to just unmute yourself there.
00:09:57.204 - 00:10:31.606, Speaker C: Okay. Yes, delighted. Great talks all, and a wonderful initiative. I think behavior is obviously very central to epidemic dynamics, pandemic dynamics and so on. In my own work, I'm focused heavily on all of this, and I'm not going to go into my work in much detail, but in my experience with standard modelers, when you say, why don't you include behavior? They say, well, it's too hard to include behavior. And my response is, no, you already are including behavior. You're modeling behavior.
00:10:31.606 - 00:11:03.328, Speaker C: When you say that the infection growth rate is beta si. Si means there's perfect mixing and people continue mixing, even though there's a plague abroad in there community. So you're modeling behavior whether you like it or not. So if anybody gives you grief about, oh, you're modeling behavior, you can say you're modeling it, too, just very badly. So. And as Michael points out, beta si, I mean, that runs very hot. It's perfect mixing, and that's as hot as an epidemic can go.
00:11:03.328 - 00:11:26.760, Speaker C: So all of that is just armament. So let me talk about each of these presentations and hopefully give a little bit of specific, of feedback. Roxanne and Clementine, wonderful, wonderful work. I learned many things, but of course, the most important is that I'm a babushka, so that's good to know. And I'm very, I hope it's okay for you.
00:11:26.912 - 00:11:29.320, Speaker D: I hope it didn't shock you too much.
00:11:29.392 - 00:11:31.040, Speaker C: No, no, I have no problem with it.
00:11:31.152 - 00:11:31.568, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:31.616 - 00:11:32.204, Speaker E: Phew.
00:11:33.024 - 00:12:15.906, Speaker C: So, you know, in the United States, mask resistance. All these things are their litmus tests of political fealty. They're not, they're beyond health considerations here. But I liked your curves very much. And especially the ones that change slope, this adherence depending on government things. And in my own work, I've tried to study the connection between behavior and the prevalence of disease. Not so much government announcements, but prevalence or new cases, either the extent of the disease in the community or the rate of growth of the disease in the community.
00:12:15.906 - 00:12:56.258, Speaker C: And in one of the works, some of the papers I've done are on coupled contagion of fear and disease. So the disease goes up, people get afraid. They distance that produces a depression in the growth rate. Then their fear dissipates, they come back out, but there's still infectives. So the thing blows up again, right? Yeah. So you get these multiple waves from the fear dynamics, which Shayna. I've borrowed from the Roskola Wagner equations, and my colleague here, Joe Ledoux, in neuroscience, has helped me develop some simple models of fear that I've put into agents like agent zero and these other things.
00:12:56.258 - 00:13:48.644, Speaker C: So I'm very interested in this connection between fear and behavior, and I'm just wondering whether it would be very interesting to see your curves, the ones that go down and go up, plotted against prevalence, plotted against new cases. Is that a lag response to increases in cases? You know, the government in the United States, again, the interesting phenomenon is that you see departures from government, you know, orders, directives when prevalence falls. I mean, it's not so much conformity to the directives that's interesting here. It's that departures take place when prevalence falls, even though the directives remain in place. People just say, well, we're going to ignore masks. We're going to have mass gatherings. We're going to have these huge motorcycle festivals in Dakota.
00:13:48.644 - 00:14:27.390, Speaker C: So the question to me is, can you, how do these things line up against prevalence or perceived prevalence? And on that, I agree with the four t's. The perception of prevalence has everything to do with trust in the government reporting, trust in the CDC. And when you have leaders casting aspersions on science and the rest of it, it doesn't help people make a rational appraisal of the risks. And so you see more of this dysfunctional behavior. All right, so just as a, as a, as a, as a question, how do those curves look against prevalence or new cases? That'd be very interesting.
00:14:27.502 - 00:14:30.478, Speaker E: Well, for me to know, may I just add.
00:14:30.526 - 00:14:31.214, Speaker C: Yeah, please, please.
00:14:31.254 - 00:15:09.298, Speaker E: Yeah. So we didn't actually do it, so I can't answer the question, and, like, how does it vary? But we did have an idea brought forth by Ditland in our group. I'm not sure if she's here today. I think. No, but she did bring an idea that we wanted to do at some point, which is we have the postal codes of people who answered. So we wanted to match postal codes of the people in our sample and the infection rates in these areas to check how behaviors varies with local rates of infection, but at a very localized level. So really that allows.
00:15:09.298 - 00:15:41.584, Speaker E: Because people, it's one thing to say, I take Quebec, because that's where I'm from. Yeah. Cases are peaking. There's a lot of people infected, but sometimes people in the regions might be like. Yeah, but like, more than half of the cases are in Montreal, so it doesn't concern me. So to check it at a more localized level may more like help us really get a sense of the real risk that people are anchoring and how they might perceive it because it's more close to them. So that's something that we didn't talked about we might do.
00:15:42.284 - 00:15:48.500, Speaker C: This is not a criticism of what you've done, which is very interesting. I'm just interested in whether I think that's worth pursuing.
00:15:48.652 - 00:16:00.140, Speaker E: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. We agree, and it is something we talked about. It's just there's a lot of challenges, of course, doing it, but we would absolutely love to check that interaction. Yeah, yeah, definitely something there.
00:16:00.252 - 00:16:02.544, Speaker C: Yeah. Great. Love to see what you find.
00:16:03.084 - 00:16:35.104, Speaker F: May I just. Oh, sorry. I just wanted to speak to that as well and just say I think it's an excellent question and I think it's really important to differentiate perceived risk from actual risk as well. So if you rely on self report and believe that it's reliable, asking people if they actually feel that they're at risk, as opposed to some people might not feel that they're at risk, even though there truly is an increase in deaths within their region and so on. So something to consider.
00:16:35.754 - 00:16:45.290, Speaker B: So I guess the perception actually determines people's behaviors. It's not actually the real risk. This is how they perceive and that determines how they react to it.
00:16:45.322 - 00:17:06.072, Speaker C: And if they're trusting sources of misinformation or hysterical people or vaccines are going to stick a Bill Gates chipping your arm, you know, they're believing also their trust is misplaced is one issue. I'm sorry, go ahead. I have specific comments on each talk, but I don't want to interrupt the conversation about them. So.
00:17:06.208 - 00:17:32.252, Speaker A: Well, we might want to try and just come back to some of the questions that came through in the chat. So what I've done just for the people who are listening is I've tried to cut and paste your questions and direct them specifically at the speakers. And so my apologies, because I'm going to ask them to actually have a look through and see if they can answer some of those ones. So I think I've included the names there. So I don't know who might want to start. Roxana, did you get yours? You want to have a quick.
00:17:32.308 - 00:17:41.268, Speaker E: Well, actually, I copy pasted them and I have a list of questions that relate to our talk with some perspective answers. So we could start maybe because.
00:17:41.436 - 00:17:41.964, Speaker A: Fantastic.
00:17:42.004 - 00:17:42.300, Speaker G: And just.
00:17:42.332 - 00:17:43.292, Speaker A: Yeah, just to.
00:17:43.348 - 00:17:43.984, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:44.404 - 00:17:46.948, Speaker E: Um, so Roxana, you want me to kind of ask the questions and you.
00:17:46.956 - 00:17:49.084, Speaker A: Can answer because I. Yeah, you can go.
00:17:49.124 - 00:17:53.144, Speaker D: But I don't know if we should answer them all because there's a lot of.
00:17:54.524 - 00:17:56.220, Speaker A: Maybe choose your favorite one.
00:17:56.332 - 00:17:56.764, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:56.844 - 00:17:57.944, Speaker F: Okay, I'm gonna.
00:17:59.364 - 00:18:02.068, Speaker D: Because we need to leave space for the others to.
00:18:02.116 - 00:18:14.828, Speaker E: Absolutely. So one of the ones that I thought was very interesting is how challenging is it to collect the data and connection between data and model that we proposed, since it involves behavior monitoring.
00:18:14.876 - 00:19:19.844, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, there's, of course, this survey is mostly about perceptions. Of course we ask like more objective questions, but it's really about perceptions. But we did correlate or link with actual real numbers, like number of cases, with some of perception of change, for example, and we saw a relation between the two, like more objective numbers and then how people perceive the situation. So our challenge was to think of all the perceptions, human related factors, including well being, how they perceive sanitary measures and change over time, and trying to describe the situation as the crisis evolved. So we could try to do our best to inform policies and things. But, you know, you mentioned in the beginning that it's too hard to include behavior. You were speaking of this too complex.
00:19:19.844 - 00:20:40.566, Speaker D: But for me, since I began to study this topic in 97, everyone told me, never study social change, you know, it's too hard, it's too complex. So here we are with a major pandemic, and we don't have much ideas in social psychology, even psychology, how dynamics is evolve over time. And we were really surprised by that crisis, really, because since 97, I work in asylo basically by myself, trying to understand context of great changes and how people cope with it. So the challenge for us was to get organized and now is to get into those dynamics of change and looking at postal codes, because you see, you pointed doctor Lee in the beginning that you were interested with these trajectories. But when we see numbers, like in our society, like from institute, it's mainly numbers that are at one point of time. So it's average, we have the average, it looks like that. But then when you group people, we find something else, and maybe that's something else.
00:20:40.566 - 00:21:33.576, Speaker D: Those who go down versus those who follow the curves, they can play a different role in your mathematical modeling. And that whole thing can be maybe helpful to be more precise and maybe more make less mistake. But I don't know, I'm not a mathematician, but I think maybe there's still a use to look at those perception over time, even if it's difficult to work with complex and longitudinal data. We need to invest time now for, especially for future crisis. So we are ready to help people in the field, people that are suffering, and of course, inform politics. So that's our vision. And we'd be very happy to deepen those understandings because now, I mean, I'm in psychology.
00:21:33.576 - 00:22:07.844, Speaker D: I never did those Madame Madrival things. So I'd be really, really in our team. We'd be very happy to share our data and collaborate, if you have some of those expertise, because we're at a stage where we're trying to develop those methods. But it is very complex as social change and as human beings. So that's all I had to say for now. I don't know if it's that helpful, maybe out of focus for the questions, but this is what I think we should remember most about the behavior and change.
00:22:09.344 - 00:22:59.162, Speaker B: If I had a quick comment. So that's precisely correct. Those data really, really inform us how to incorporate that behavior into the model. I think a lot of that has been considered in Rebecca's model, how you separate the susceptibles depending on the behaviors. But say, for example, your data considers, contains proportions, people, fractions of the people in the population with different kinds of responses, different behaviors that separate the population from population. That also determines why some provinces or some regions have a lower epidemic, others have a higher. It's just really a lot of it determines by the constitution of the population how many people are kind of badly behaved, that sort of thing.
00:22:59.162 - 00:23:25.824, Speaker B: And also, I'm interested in how that fraction changes temporarily during epidemic. I think if you have those kind of data, they'll be just like perfect for us. That's exactly the data we're looking for. Looking forward to talk to you more and the climate team more about this. Professor Lee can organize another workshop on this. Okay, I'd be happy to do that.
00:23:26.444 - 00:23:37.394, Speaker A: There's definitely. I think there's a. But I think there is a lot here, and I do think, you know, it's too short for a time, unfortunately. Shana, do you want to, are there any questions that have popped up that you would like to respond to?
00:23:38.094 - 00:24:40.884, Speaker F: I'm happy to. Actually, there was a question about delayed gratification and how that might relate. I think there were actually two questions relating to delayed gratification. I should mention that the term delay discounting, it's used interchangeably with not necessarily delayed gratifications although sometimes, especially in the developmental literature, but especially with temporal discounting, intertemporal choice is really the task itself. But we actually also, I'm not presenting the data today, tested individuals on discounting avalosis as well, which speaks to Ali Asghari's question to me. So delay discounting, we used it generally to refer to rewards here, but it also, of course, could refer to losses. And it does resemble delayed gratification, which is usually used in reference to the marshmallow test and other developmental tests which use actual tangible objects that have different values.
00:24:40.884 - 00:25:34.600, Speaker F: And of course, delayed gratification is the opposite of delaying discounting. So in terms of what it describes in terms of behavior, hopefully that answers that question. There was, Rebecca asked a very interesting question. I'm going to try and pull it up just with respect to, I think, behaviors that affect the greater good as opposed to just an individual. And we use monetary rewards as a proxy because we find that it is a very sensitive marker of a variety of behaviors. But you could certainly set up the question in relation to asking about individual versus larger group interests. So there are many ways to manipulate discounting paradigms or intertemporal choice paradigms.
00:25:34.600 - 00:25:51.904, Speaker F: Finally, I should mention that we did also look at probabilistic discounting, so deciding between a certain and less certain reward. But again, I'm going to leave that for now. It's a bit of a complicated story, but the delayed discounting data really fits with what we've found in the past.
00:25:53.724 - 00:25:54.864, Speaker C: Will I go ahead and.
00:25:55.564 - 00:25:56.444, Speaker A: Yes, please.
00:25:56.564 - 00:26:06.972, Speaker C: Okay. So, Rebecca. I mean, I'm Shayna. So sorry. It's great stuff. Vaccine refusal, obviously, is a huge deal. Again, I mean, I've tried to build these fear.
00:26:06.972 - 00:26:53.394, Speaker C: We published something in Royal Society recently with a colleague at Courant on models with two fears, fear of the disease and fear of the vaccine. And they're both contagious and can both be ill founded or well founded and so forth. But the interesting simple point is that if the fear of disease exceeds the fear of vaccine, as when the disease is big, people take the vaccine, but that suppresses the disease. Now they're not so afraid of the disease and they're more afraid of the vaccine, and they stop taking the vaccine and the thing comes back, which is exactly what you see in historic smallpox. Cycles of vigilance and complacency are all based on these, on these same things. In any event, I love this idea of introducing the theory of intertemporal choice into epidemiology. And I was just curious in your.
00:26:53.394 - 00:27:31.130, Speaker C: And I'm very fascinated at the idea of intervening in it somehow with queuing or other blocking or other sorts of methods. But I'm wondering, do you think of the degree of discounting as fixed in the individual or as a function of conformity effects or social network dynamics? Or is it learned and acquired the way associative fear conditioning happens? I'm just curious whether you think of it as a model, or is it something that's an endowment of the agent, or is it something that the agent comes in with some initial setting that's influenced by his environment, his social experience, what have you?
00:27:31.322 - 00:28:33.010, Speaker F: It's an excellent question and I don't think that there's a clear answer as of yet from my reading of the literature, or at least in terms of some of the data that we've collected in the past and even during COVID when we repeat testing of individuals, even on the same day, on the same paradigm, they will tell us the strategy that they use. They might consider inflation or they might just base it on a gut feeling. So that suggests some implicit influences. Of course we find that individuals are consistent, but there is quite a bit of intra individual variability in their discounting. It's usually within a tight range, but it can vary from one administration to another, even, like I said, on the same day, which is surprising, as we've seen, and we've actually looked at the relationship between the individual variables like income, even coming from a place that shows a lot of income inequality.
00:28:33.202 - 00:28:33.758, Speaker E: We.
00:28:33.866 - 00:29:20.460, Speaker F: We in fact tested individuals from South Africa, which has a very high gini index, and we found that we find another work, some work actually, that was led by my colleague Kai Ruggeri that income inequality is high or delayed discounting is highly sensitive to income inequality and you tend to see much steeper discounting in those cases. So understanding or modeling all of these many variables and the complexities of them with respect to delay discounting I think is very important. But at least in our simple model with the variables that we included, it does seem that delay discounting still explains vaccine compliance in our samples and in multiple samples, actually very important over and above those other variables.
00:29:20.532 - 00:29:35.164, Speaker C: And I also thought it was very interesting. I don't know what you're finding on the prospect theory is all about the asymmetry between gains and losses, and I'm wondering whether they're discounting how they look on the gains side versus the losses side. I'm sure that's very interesting.
00:29:35.324 - 00:29:41.904, Speaker F: So far our data are conforming to the predictions of prospect theory on losses versus gains.
00:29:42.444 - 00:29:52.564, Speaker C: Terrific. All great. All right, so I have other comments on Rebecca's talk. Or would you like to stop and have a group discussion of Shana's talk?
00:29:52.604 - 00:30:01.574, Speaker A: Or what would you like to. I might just ask Rebecca, because I know she's had a look at some of the questions as well. If there's one there that she was interested, just have a go at.
00:30:02.194 - 00:30:30.402, Speaker G: Yeah, sorry, I've been busy, busy looking at them, coming up with answers. One person pointed out that a bilateral influence function where both people are influenced might be more realistic. I acknowledge that that would probably be an interesting avenue to pursue. And then someone asked how we decided on our assumptions. I mean, most of them were for mathematical tractability. Just starting with a simple. How does.
00:30:30.402 - 00:31:11.358, Speaker G: How does this work in a very simple model? And then the intention is that it should grow from there. And I think the world is your oyster, pretty much. In terms of adding on important behavioral interactions between people, why did we choose a discrete attitude scale? We never thought of a continuous one. Of course, if we had a continuous one, then you, the odes, would become unmanageable, because now you don't have one ode for each population group you've got to integrate. So that's a whole other ball of wax. With the agent based model, we probably could have had a scale. Then we'd have another decision to make.
00:31:11.358 - 00:31:56.424, Speaker G: How much does each group influence the other? So, again, it's just a question of how do you want to model these groups? But there's no reason why you couldn't look at it continuous scale in a different modeling framework. I was asked a couple of interesting questions about how my work relates to other work. The other work listed was sentiment analysis models over networks and rumor spreading models in social networks. So we didn't look at networks, we just had a grid. And so, of course, that's quite different. And we know that networks do have a strong effect on population dynamics. And so I think that that's an important, another important next step in this work.
00:31:56.424 - 00:32:36.634, Speaker G: And then someone sent a quote from Upton Sinclair. It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. And does this have an effect? And, of course, I could be flip and say, well, if it was a woman, we'd be fine, but on the other, being a little less flip, yes, I'm sure that does have an important effect, and that would be in the rate at which one is willing to switch opinions or switch attitudes. And so we can get at that a little bit that way. But there's more to be included in that area as well. Okay. I think that deals with most of them.
00:32:38.654 - 00:32:40.794, Speaker A: I can see you're itching to jump in. Go on.
00:32:41.374 - 00:32:45.764, Speaker C: I'm cool. Anyway, first, please say hello to Burt Baumgartner for me.
00:32:45.884 - 00:32:46.916, Speaker E: Oh, he's awesome.
00:32:46.980 - 00:32:47.500, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely.
00:32:47.532 - 00:33:04.464, Speaker C: He's a wonderful guy. I haven't seen him in a long time. We talked when I was at Hopkins, and. Just give him a hug for me. All right, so I will. So it's, the work is very interesting. Commendable effort to do both opinion dynamics and inject opinion dynamics into epi modeling.
00:33:04.464 - 00:33:49.850, Speaker C: Yes. Since you've already answered that, I'll just second the motion that the influence function is sender only, and you might have a second receiver propensity function or handle that in different ways, but it's a little bit, you should consider extending that so that the receiver is also in the transaction. I was curious, purely on the opinion dynamics odes. Did you actually solve for in equilibrium and explore its stability? I mean, I'm just curious, is there a unique equilibrium? Are there several, are there limit cycles? Is there anything dynamically, you know. Yeah, exotic about that setup. I'm just curious how much you pursued that just mathematically.
00:33:49.882 - 00:33:54.814, Speaker G: Right. So there are several equilibria, and they're all saddles.
00:33:55.194 - 00:33:56.074, Speaker C: Ah, okay.
00:33:56.114 - 00:34:22.754, Speaker G: So, so numerically, it's actually a real pain, but yeah, we were able to do a little bit of analysis. It's fun. You can, you can simplify it down to a two equation system at the very beginning, and then a two equation system towards the end. And you can show how, you can prove, you can show that the population will evolve the way we expect from being centered to being polarized. So yes, we could do some of that, but no cycles, they're all saddles.
00:34:23.174 - 00:34:28.074, Speaker C: Interesting. In two dimensions, you can't get only saddles.
00:34:28.374 - 00:34:29.102, Speaker G: What's that?
00:34:29.198 - 00:34:35.912, Speaker C: By index theory, you can't get only two saddles in the plane. But that's, you're not in the plane, you're in four dimensions.
00:34:35.968 - 00:34:38.456, Speaker E: So, yeah, well, that was just possible.
00:34:38.600 - 00:35:29.436, Speaker C: But, yeah, what was the other thing? I was just gonna, again, I just think you should try to be, I mean, you know, a little bit diligent in distinguishing between the number of opinions and the spectrum of strengths with which they are held. And polarization is just really, what you're showing is polarization on strength. Not, yeah, not that the positions are extreme. The positions are just, you know, one or minus one, really. They're sigma and just otherwise, that's that's. That's the only thing I thought it was very interesting to try to. The other question I had on, on prophylaxis, did you include the effectiveness of the prophylaxis? I saw low, medium and high, but I didn't see anything about how effective it is.
00:35:29.436 - 00:35:32.344, Speaker C: And I wondered whether that isn't an important assumption.
00:35:32.684 - 00:35:53.028, Speaker G: Well, so that was all rolled in right under the hood. So the fact that the high prophylactic group had a lower transmission rate of disease, the assumption was that the attitude and the behavior were inextricably linked and meant the same thing.
00:35:53.116 - 00:35:53.744, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:54.244 - 00:35:57.304, Speaker G: So, yeah, we didn't. We didn't consider them as separate.
00:36:00.404 - 00:36:14.724, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. I'll have to check again. I'm not sure heteroclinic orbits connecting saddles may be permitted in the plane. I don't have to check. But anyway, this is all phase plane bitty. Anyway, it's all great, and I think it's commendable.
00:36:14.724 - 00:36:33.094, Speaker C: I hope we keep this going, because I really think it's extremely important, the future of epidemiology and public policy to understand how behavior enters in. And as the panel shows, it enters in in many interesting and undoubtedly coupled ways. So I just think this is a great group that we should keep going.
00:36:34.234 - 00:36:43.094, Speaker G: Thank you. I'd just like to say that I've been trying to answer all the questions that were sent to me directly in the chat. And if I missed anything from anybody, please send me an email.
00:36:44.154 - 00:37:06.988, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that is kind of you, Rebecca, because we, unfortunately, we did get a bit squirrel squashed at time at the beginning. So we have actually reached the end. I think we probably have. We maybe have. Maybe it'd be nice to hear from Michael, actually. I mean, Michael's been so important in organizing this whole theme and the workshop. So, Michael, do you want to have just some final remarks on this theme? And then we'll close it.
00:37:06.988 - 00:37:08.492, Speaker A: We'll reopen again at 330 for the.
00:37:08.508 - 00:37:23.344, Speaker E: Next one, might I just add a little thing before just everyone. You can also send me or Hassan questions. And there was a lot of questions like that. Technical. And we added some slides to what we're going to send you. So there might be answers in there.
00:37:24.524 - 00:37:25.572, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you.
00:37:25.588 - 00:37:25.716, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:25.740 - 00:37:26.532, Speaker A: Michael, do you have a.
00:37:26.588 - 00:37:27.036, Speaker C: Sufficient.
00:37:27.060 - 00:37:58.474, Speaker B: Finally, just appreciate all the discussions and panels and also the talks. I think the pandemic really told us we really need to incorporate the human behaviors into our model. Epidemic models. This is probably a new, kind of a new phase in the model development. We've been looking at a theoretical model for so long. But then the pandemics tell us, well, you need something more in your model to be reliable, and that's something we're going to pursue from now. Yeah.
00:38:00.294 - 00:38:23.906, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just going to say, on the empirical side, there's all this wonderful work on mining social media to extract attitudes, sentiments, fears. We have some work funded by NSF to try to do Twitter mining. So, I mean, it may be that we can actually have better data on these attitudes and their transmission and so on. So I think it's a very, very rich and crucially important area.
00:38:24.050 - 00:38:37.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a really good step for us to talk and collaborate, and then we'll get a much better formulated model and would be much more useful for public health. Thanks, everyone.
00:38:37.854 - 00:39:04.100, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone, for attending today. A special thank you to our speakers. Incredibly insightful and real learning. So it's really wonderful to hear your research and all kinds of new, new things that I hadn't considered. So thank you. And of course, we were working on a survey as well on behaviors. So a lot of this, we can bring that theory in and start to look at these attitudes that we've been observing and see, maybe look for some explanations as to why.
00:39:04.100 - 00:39:35.374, Speaker A: And I think all this will help us prepare for what is coming in the future in terms of the pandemic or the endemic, for sure, but also that we might be in a better position to take more of a health equity lens as we go into other threats. And we certainly see that with global climate change emergency that we have some really tricky problems coming, and we need to think about how those are going to impact different population groups and what we can do to be more protective of them. So thank you so much. It's been a really great session for those of.
