00:00:00.560 - 00:00:39.328, Speaker A: Some of the elements of that space. Sumitra, did you start recording? Yes, I have started. Okay, thank you. When I was student and I had this course on linear algebra, one of my problems was that it seemed that some proofs are like magic. Why this happens and why, for example, diagonalization work. Why do we have Jordan formula? Because at the very beginning, they do not give a good explanation. They just show you it works.
00:00:39.328 - 00:00:52.604, Speaker A: Go ahead, do the calculation. It works. And you want to understand why it works and to do it. Right. Here is the book. You see it lean Argonne. Right.
00:00:52.604 - 00:01:04.264, Speaker A: So I strongly suggest to read this book, and I mean use it for any concept of linear algebra. And also some of them we needed here in this book.
00:01:06.044 - 00:01:34.044, Speaker B: Thank you. I really appreciate that, those comments. And I think one reason that you probably like it as me is it was written by someone who does functional analysis. Linear algebra is the study of finite dimensional vector spaces. But if you sort of know what's going to come in the next course, when you get to functional analysis, you write from a different viewpoint. And I think that's what helps this book particularly appeal to analysts.
00:01:34.384 - 00:01:37.936, Speaker A: Sure. Thank you for writing this book, indeed, for us.
00:01:37.960 - 00:01:39.084, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:01:40.704 - 00:01:54.984, Speaker C: So I go back to one note. Start sharing. Okay, here we go.
00:01:55.564 - 00:01:59.224, Speaker A: We saw that k of x.
00:02:03.964 - 00:02:04.372, Speaker C: Y.
00:02:04.428 - 00:02:44.316, Speaker A: Equal to min of xy creates an Rkhs. And let's detect some of its elements. And I mentioned application in economics. You'll see why economic is relevant here. Little k index y at point x, by definition, is k, x and y. And here is the argument is x. And you see, if x is small, this is equal to x.
00:02:44.316 - 00:03:10.684, Speaker A: And when x gets bigger, it's fixed. So the diagram of Ky is like this, and at point y, it becomes constant. Our argument.
00:03:12.704 - 00:03:13.844, Speaker C: Is x.
00:03:16.344 - 00:03:59.896, Speaker A: And elements of w are linear combinations of this. So an arbitrary f in W can be written as sum a from one up to Naik. And we can imagine what is easily. Now, what is the f of x? Or what is the diagram of f of x? So it's n of these diagrams multiplied by different coefficients, AI. And then you sum them up. Another way to look is as before, without loss of generality, assume that y.
00:04:00.000 - 00:04:03.400, Speaker C: One is less than y, two less.
00:04:03.432 - 00:05:19.486, Speaker A: Than yn, and if your x is in between zero and y one, the first integral f of x for all the function. Here we are here. In other words, ki of x is equal to x for all of them. So we obtain sum from a, from one up to nai times x. It's a multiple of x. But when we pass to the second sub interval between y one and y two f of x, the first function is already a constant, is a one y one, but for the other, for the n minus one remaining function, we are in this definition of k in this part of the definition. So it becomes sum I from two up to the naix, and it continues like this.
00:05:19.486 - 00:06:23.344, Speaker A: We go from one interval to another one. Terms becomes fixed and our coefficient changes each time we lose one element from the sum. And at the end, when x is bigger than or equal to yn, the last infinite interval f of x is uniformly constant, absolutely constant I from one up to naiy. And a is a coefficient. It can be even a complex number. But if you can see the real number, the summation here, I mean, each of these sums could be negative or positive. So at the end of the day, what we obtain is something like this, and eventually constantly between each interval, it's a multiple of x and eventually a constant.
00:06:23.344 - 00:06:59.930, Speaker A: And on the slope of these lines there is no restriction. Of course, based on the reasoning I gave, any function of this form has a diagram like that and you can go backward. Start with any diagram like this and you immediately see what is your y one, y two up to yn. So this is y one, this is.
00:06:59.962 - 00:07:01.098, Speaker C: The last one yn.
00:07:01.146 - 00:08:10.952, Speaker A: The diagram tells you what are the points, and also the slopes are given because here the last slope I didn't write here, when we are between yn and yn minus one f of x is equal to a constant plus a nx. So the last slope that we have here is a n. The previous one is a n plus a n minus one. So we find a n from here, then an from there, and we go backward. And the last one here gives us a one. Note that I don't say this slope is equal to a one, but I say that when we go backward we obtain this last slope. So therefore all functions of these four form of a w w is piecewise linear function, which is eventually constant.
00:08:10.952 - 00:08:38.722, Speaker A: But still we cannot tell what is w bar which is over h. That needs more attention. And it's not in this part of the course. I mean, later on we will not cover it because it's in the second part of the book. My goal is go up to chapter six, hopefully. But there are many more chapters and in one of them this is studied.
00:08:38.778 - 00:08:40.574, Speaker C: If you are interested.
00:08:45.794 - 00:08:53.454, Speaker A: The next example is Rkhs induced by a positive matrix.
00:08:55.074 - 00:08:59.534, Speaker C: So rks induced.
00:09:02.274 - 00:09:08.494, Speaker A: By p bigger than or equal to zero p is an.
00:09:11.394 - 00:09:14.294, Speaker C: N times n positive matrix.
00:09:14.674 - 00:09:17.098, Speaker A: It's written, but there is a reason.
00:09:17.146 - 00:09:18.454, Speaker C: I repeat it here.
00:09:23.464 - 00:10:24.750, Speaker A: So px on Cn, we can look at it as an operator. And last week there was a question that if you have already an infinite matrix which acts on l two as a bounded operator and has further properties, for example, that is a compact operator or something else, other properties of operators. And we use a disconstruction of more, we obtain an h. What can we say about h? So this is a partial answer to that question, because we start with a matrix p, which is positive, and we construct h using Mohr construction. But the same idea can work in infinitely many, I mean infinite dimensional case and you can see what happens. But let's do the simple case n.
00:10:24.782 - 00:10:27.394, Speaker C: By n and it can be generalized.
00:10:29.854 - 00:11:19.110, Speaker A: We have seen this before. Then what is cn? Most of the time we can say that Cn is the set of vectors of dimension. And we think of elements of x Cn as vectors like these, sometimes vertical vectors. It depends on the context. But another point of view, which I already use, is to consider the set x one, two, three, up to n and look at x as a function on x with element in c, such that x at .1 is the first.
00:11:19.182 - 00:11:24.594, Speaker C: Component and that point n is the nth component.
00:11:25.614 - 00:12:08.802, Speaker A: With this point of view, we can look at p, this n by n positive matrix. We can look at p as a function x times x with values at c. P at point ij as before, is nothing but the element in rho I and column j. So that's the way we can look at it. And positivity is precisely what we need here. I mean, p bigger than or equal to zero is precisely what we asked.
00:12:08.898 - 00:12:11.614, Speaker C: For the definition of a kernel function.
00:12:14.714 - 00:12:19.974, Speaker A: So this creates a space h.
00:12:22.394 - 00:12:22.850, Speaker C: So.
00:12:22.922 - 00:12:30.974, Speaker A: By more there is hook, you can.
00:12:31.014 - 00:12:34.454, Speaker C: Call it h created by p. And.
00:12:34.534 - 00:12:49.514, Speaker A: We want to see what is this p and obtain some description of some of its elements. So two things. What is h? And also what is the inner protagonist.
00:12:49.934 - 00:12:53.754, Speaker C: To be able to treat its elements.
00:13:00.324 - 00:13:06.020, Speaker A: The first thing, it comes out of this, the kernel, which I wrote pij.
00:13:06.132 - 00:13:13.944, Speaker C: I mean, let me use our old notation.
00:13:16.764 - 00:13:55.128, Speaker A: Let me write k for the kernel. What is the kernel function? Lidl K. So Lidl k is a function defined on x with values at c. The original definition is like this. Kj on the variable I is defined to be the capital k ing. And we know that this is p I g for any I. If you look carefully, this precisely means.
00:13:55.176 - 00:14:04.124, Speaker C: That kg is equal to the j's column of p.
00:14:06.344 - 00:14:15.864, Speaker A: So in other words, our kernel functions are precisely these columns of p.
00:14:20.604 - 00:14:27.144, Speaker C: This is k one, this is k two, and this is k.
00:14:28.044 - 00:14:49.260, Speaker A: With this new interpretation. And w is this n of these kernel functions. And you see immediately this is equal.
00:14:49.292 - 00:14:50.864, Speaker C: To the range of p.
00:15:01.524 - 00:15:06.652, Speaker A: And we are in the finite dimensional case. It's already closed.
00:15:06.708 - 00:15:14.600, Speaker C: And that would be our space age of p here. Or h of k, if you want.
00:15:14.632 - 00:15:51.154, Speaker A: To call it, is nothing but the range of p. So the columns of p create a space, and this is the space which Moore gives us. But still we do not know what is the, the inner product. For example, what is the inner product of these two elements? Not in Cn, in h of k, it's not necessarily the same. So what is the clue for that?
00:15:51.194 - 00:15:54.594, Speaker C: So in other words, if f and.
00:15:54.634 - 00:16:01.186, Speaker A: G or u and w, whatever you want to call it here, it's better.
00:16:01.250 - 00:16:04.104, Speaker C: Not to use f and. Yeah, why not?
00:16:04.844 - 00:16:32.288, Speaker A: F and g is in h of p. Then the question is, what is the inner protocol of f and g in h of k or h of p? Of course, they are vectors of dimension n. And we can do the inner product in Cn. But this is not necessarily the same.
00:16:32.336 - 00:16:33.576, Speaker C: As the other one.
00:16:33.720 - 00:17:01.424, Speaker A: They are different. What is that? The clue is here. Well, every element of hp is a linear combination of these two, these n elements. So in order to obtain the inner product, it's enough to find the inner product of two of these elements. So what is the kj.
00:17:02.204 - 00:17:13.784, Speaker C: So this is. It's enough to say that what is kj and ki, but the inner product in h of what is this?
00:17:18.844 - 00:17:39.864, Speaker A: Well, to do this observation, first note that by the meaning of inner product, this is kj evaluated at point I. And we saw that this is, well.
00:17:41.204 - 00:17:46.560, Speaker C: Capital kifg or capital p I n.
00:17:46.592 - 00:18:28.572, Speaker A: G, which is the element in row I, column g. It's p I g. And now crucial identity to go back to inner product in Cn. I can write this as the. Look, this is p column g, row I. And that's the element which is here. I want to detect this element by an inner product in Cm.
00:18:28.572 - 00:18:34.756, Speaker A: First I do p times eg, eg are there.
00:18:34.860 - 00:18:36.778, Speaker C: So let me mention here.
00:18:36.836 - 00:19:04.586, Speaker A: En canonical base in Cn peg means this column. And then inner product with ei in Cn. So I look at the beginning, at the end.
00:19:04.770 - 00:19:22.334, Speaker C: So summarize. Kj, ki in our space age is called to p e j and e I in Cm.
00:19:24.834 - 00:19:38.546, Speaker A: It's not finalized yet, but that's a good start. We need to have something symmetric on.
00:19:38.570 - 00:19:40.174, Speaker C: The, on the right side.
00:19:40.634 - 00:20:18.034, Speaker A: Just have just pej and ei is not symmetric. And the trick to do this is to note that when p or any other matrix which is positive, there is a square root of this, there is p half which is also positive. That's another matrix which is positive. And p half times p half is equal to p. And so I can continue and write this equal to.
00:20:21.434 - 00:20:28.834, Speaker C: P, have ej ei in Cn, and then.
00:20:28.914 - 00:20:33.154, Speaker A: Take one of the p halves to the other side, noting that it's positive.
00:20:33.234 - 00:20:44.254, Speaker C: So it's self adjoint. So it's p half ej, p half. Which one was ei, ei is this one?
00:20:47.374 - 00:20:56.074, Speaker A: This is good now. This is good now because now I have something symmetric. So kj inner product with ki.
00:21:00.894 - 00:21:01.230, Speaker C: In.
00:21:01.262 - 00:21:09.022, Speaker A: The space h is equal to the inner product of p half ej and.
00:21:09.078 - 00:21:18.774, Speaker C: P half AI in Cn. That's the crucial identity.
00:21:22.354 - 00:21:38.842, Speaker A: Which I mean, enables us to obtain the inner product of any two elements in h, because any two element in h are linear combinations of kernel functions, and then expand.
00:21:38.898 - 00:21:40.976, Speaker C: And obtain the this identity.
00:21:41.040 - 00:21:54.124, Speaker A: Another thing that it helps us to do is to define an operator a from cn.
00:21:56.264 - 00:21:57.004, Speaker C: To.
00:21:59.504 - 00:22:05.044, Speaker A: Edge of k. By the following formula. I define a.
00:22:06.844 - 00:22:12.044, Speaker C: P half ej to.
00:22:12.084 - 00:22:45.848, Speaker A: Be equal to kj. Well, there is an assumption before this. It's that p is invertible. If it's not invertible, I should say that it's from ranges. Temporarily assume that p equal to p minus one no not exist. And then that is why the linear.
00:22:45.896 - 00:22:48.724, Speaker C: Combination of all of this is equal to Cm.
00:22:49.344 - 00:22:59.080, Speaker A: The formula I wrote here is equivalent to say that the main point is here, some I from j from one.
00:22:59.152 - 00:23:02.044, Speaker C: Up to n. A constant alpha j.
00:23:02.744 - 00:23:08.484, Speaker A: Pj is equal to sum.
00:23:11.464 - 00:23:13.044, Speaker C: Alpha jkj.
00:23:16.304 - 00:24:00.550, Speaker A: And the question is, as we witnessed before, why is this well defined? We can have a vector with different representation probably here. And the reason is this boxed formula. If you multiply by alpha I, alpha j, one of them bar, say alpha I bar alpha j, and then sum from one to n over both I and both j, you obtain the isometry that I mentioned. We needed the vector here. The vector here has the same norm.
00:24:00.622 - 00:24:01.974, Speaker C: As the vector there.
00:24:02.094 - 00:24:35.214, Speaker A: And whenever we have the isometry, the definition is, this is the second time today that we face with this. So they have the same norm. So a is well defined and this is a vector from. This is a matrix from cn to h of k. With this property. And with this we can find the inner product of any two elements we want. There is.
00:24:36.154 - 00:24:39.414, Speaker C: Yeah, there is another.
00:24:43.694 - 00:25:02.750, Speaker A: The property I just mentioned is this for any v and w in Cn the inner product of v and w in cn using this, using precisely this box formula.
00:25:02.942 - 00:25:09.214, Speaker C: And the definition is equal to.
00:25:11.354 - 00:25:11.930, Speaker A: Av.
00:25:12.042 - 00:25:18.214, Speaker C: And aw in k.
00:25:21.114 - 00:25:32.374, Speaker A: And it's very easy to prove this, because if v and w is in Cm, we can write v equal to a sum. The sum is alpha j.
00:25:34.174 - 00:25:36.114, Speaker C: Pj.
00:25:38.374 - 00:25:44.834, Speaker A: Same for w beta I.
00:25:46.654 - 00:25:49.474, Speaker C: P half ei.
00:25:52.454 - 00:25:58.646, Speaker A: And now we calculate the left side v inner product into w in c.
00:25:58.710 - 00:26:11.314, Speaker C: N. It will be sum j from one to n I from one to n alpha j beta I bar.
00:26:13.334 - 00:26:13.766, Speaker A: P.
00:26:13.830 - 00:26:21.594, Speaker C: Half ej pfei in Cn. That's just expanding.
00:26:21.974 - 00:26:37.790, Speaker A: And we know what is this? It's written here, p have ej. P have ei inner product in Cn is the same as the inner product of kj ki in h. So this.
00:26:37.822 - 00:26:54.442, Speaker C: Is some alpha j beta r kj k r in the space k. And.
00:26:54.578 - 00:26:58.426, Speaker A: Now we take the the coefficient inside.
00:26:58.610 - 00:27:12.610, Speaker C: And add them up j from one to n alpha jkj, and sum I from one up to n beta iki. Okay?
00:27:12.802 - 00:27:15.658, Speaker A: And this is precisely the definition of.
00:27:15.746 - 00:27:26.094, Speaker C: A of v. And this is area. Okay, so this establishes this formula.
00:27:26.174 - 00:28:24.998, Speaker A: The inner product of v and w in Cn is the same as the inner product of av and aw in k. That's one way to write it, but we wanted the other way around. In other words, we wanted to have to know the inner product between two elements in k. But now, since a is invertible, I mean, it's rejective and it's bijective. Indeed, we can call v prime to be av in k and w prime to be aw in k. By invertibility, we obtain v and w. So immediately, this implies that the inner product of v prime and w prime in k, it's a minus one v prime, a.
00:28:25.046 - 00:28:31.274, Speaker C: Minus one w prime. That's the formula we're looking for.
00:28:36.094 - 00:28:58.776, Speaker A: And recall that a was p. It's even I didn't mention this, but it's very easy in this case to see what is a. Recall that a is defined.
00:28:58.880 - 00:29:00.808, Speaker C: I go back to the definition of.
00:29:00.856 - 00:29:49.144, Speaker A: A by this formula. A applied to p half of ej is equal to kj. That was the defining property of a. On the other hand, we know that kj is p applied to ej is the j's column of p. And instead of p ej, I write it pj. So we have two matrices, a and p half. And they coincide on these elements.
00:29:49.144 - 00:30:32.464, Speaker A: But these elements, because p is invertible, they span of p half ej is cn. So this immediately implies that the a, which was unknown to us when we defined it is indeed equal to the p half. And so a minus one is its inverse. And we can go back to our formula and say that the inner product of v prime and w prime in h is simply p minus half, p.
00:30:32.504 - 00:30:38.364, Speaker C: Prime, p minus f w prime, inner product in C.
00:30:43.864 - 00:31:02.218, Speaker A: The formulas were easy in this case, because we assume that p is invertible and we use it in several places. If not, there is a remedy, and we have a concept which is called pseudo inverse. You can describe it this way.
00:31:02.266 - 00:31:02.894, Speaker C: It's.
00:31:05.354 - 00:31:09.894, Speaker A: P from here to here. See on that. This is the kernel.
00:31:11.554 - 00:31:14.054, Speaker C: I write it n for two.
00:31:15.154 - 00:31:52.328, Speaker A: And even in the book, the authors were coaches to call it null space, not kernel, because we will mix with the other kernel that we have here. So if we consider the null space and its complement n plus, then in general, we know that the range of an operator p when the complement is n of p star, but in this case, p is equal to p star.
00:31:52.456 - 00:31:56.484, Speaker C: Is n of p, because p is equal to p star.
00:31:58.064 - 00:32:23.556, Speaker A: And when we take complement one more time, n of p complement is equal to range of p complement two wise in infinite dimensional setting. If you want to generalize this formula, you need to be careful. It's range of p bar. But here we do not need bar.
00:32:23.740 - 00:32:33.104, Speaker C: Because everything is closed. I mean, we are in the finite dimensional case. And.
00:32:35.524 - 00:33:16.094, Speaker A: In the general setting, when n is not equal to zero, it's a space we can confine ourselves to n perp. And the image you see is also np perp. So the image is also there. So the restriction. So this p, the red p that we consider is from enter. To enter, it has an inverse, it's bijective between these two. It has an inverse p minus one.
00:33:16.094 - 00:34:03.156, Speaker A: It's not on the whole space, it's from n per to n per. But they define an operator like this. P dag is equal to p minus one on enter, as we find here, and on its complement equal to zero. In other words, everything here is mapped to zero. It's called. It's kind of generalized inverse or pseudo inverse. It has some pdag here, has some properties of, of the inverse function.
00:34:03.156 - 00:34:22.252, Speaker A: And everything I did up to here, you can do it and obtain results with paper. For example, this box formula, which was interesting for us in the previous case, the product of v prime and w prime.
00:34:22.308 - 00:34:23.664, Speaker C: Let me write it again.
00:34:24.964 - 00:34:32.854, Speaker A: V prime and w prime in k. If p is invertible.
00:34:35.394 - 00:34:43.534, Speaker C: We have this symmetric formula in cn minus half.
00:34:43.914 - 00:34:57.302, Speaker A: I can, I can take one of these p minus half to the other side. For example, I put it there, it becomes p minus half, half, v prime.
00:34:57.478 - 00:34:59.674, Speaker C: W prime in Cn.
00:35:00.454 - 00:35:04.830, Speaker A: So it's p minus one, v prime.
00:35:04.982 - 00:35:07.074, Speaker C: W prime in Cm.
00:35:07.854 - 00:35:53.360, Speaker A: Of course, you can put it on the other one too. So, a formula that we have is inner product of any two element in k is the corresponding inner product in Cn. But you put p minus one in front of one of them, either here or there. That's for the case we saw before. And if p is not invertible, the same formula works, except that instead of p minus one, you write Pdac, the.
00:35:53.432 - 00:35:54.920, Speaker C: P that we have here.
00:35:55.072 - 00:36:03.032, Speaker A: So, in for any p positive, invertible or not, the inner product of two.
00:36:03.088 - 00:36:18.074, Speaker C: Elements in h is p, v prime, w prime, or p that comes like this.
00:36:24.014 - 00:36:26.166, Speaker A: So that's why it's called the generalized.
00:36:26.230 - 00:36:28.014, Speaker C: Inverse, or pseudo inverse.
00:36:28.054 - 00:36:30.686, Speaker A: It helps us to, to obtain a.
00:36:30.710 - 00:36:41.890, Speaker C: Formula for the inner product in those cases. So, anything else here?
00:36:41.962 - 00:37:07.734, Speaker A: No, it finishes this part. I didn't write what happens in the infinite dimensional case, but the same formulas work, except that I mentioned, at which point you need to be careful. It's precisely here. When you go to infinite dimension on case mp, per is rp bar.
00:37:08.154 - 00:37:11.454, Speaker C: So it's for infinite dimension.
00:37:18.514 - 00:37:30.334, Speaker A: Okay. But still the generalized inverse works, and you can obtain formulas like this on l two.
00:37:30.994 - 00:37:34.584, Speaker C: Then a matrix, a positive matrix, is given.
00:37:40.004 - 00:38:30.904, Speaker A: Well, one last example that we need to treat and finish. Chapter two is indeed an interesting one about any Hilbert space. And it is more interesting if you consider spaces, for example, l two of zero one. Of course it's a Hilbert space. But when a function is in l two, you cannot talk about the evaluation at a point, because a function in lobe space is a ghost of a function. It's a family of the function, and we use a representative. It's defined almost everywhere.
00:38:30.904 - 00:39:05.108, Speaker A: So at no point we can talk about the values of f. So we have a Hilbert space, but in a sense, we do not have an Rkhs, we do not have early produce in kernel Hilbert space, because we cannot simply talk about the values. That's true even if you look at the first chapter of the book. Among all the examples given, there is a section called a non example. And a non example is precisely this.
00:39:05.156 - 00:39:11.084, Speaker C: One that in Lubega spaces we cannot talk about evaluation.
00:39:11.204 - 00:39:48.104, Speaker A: But still there is a remedy. And the remedy is that is this section. Any Hilbert space which is given, we can somehow transform it to an rt hs not necessarily on the initial set, but on something else, but still with the same inner product structure that I described. First, the definition of gramion. Probably we have seen this before.
00:39:48.964 - 00:39:56.504, Speaker C: So H is a Hilbert space with inner product. This one.
00:39:58.484 - 00:40:00.236, Speaker A: Assume that h one up.
00:40:00.260 - 00:40:03.604, Speaker C: To h n are elements of Hilbert space.
00:40:03.684 - 00:40:10.056, Speaker A: H and you form the matrix in.
00:40:10.080 - 00:40:16.764, Speaker C: A product of hi and hj n by n matrix.
00:40:18.264 - 00:40:21.424, Speaker A: This is called the Gramion of these.
00:40:21.464 - 00:40:35.204, Speaker C: Vectors Grammy on h one obtains.
00:40:37.724 - 00:41:06.314, Speaker A: The way it's defined. Here it's the matrix. In some books the determinant is called the Gramion. And some, even in some books, they even mention the determinant granule. So you need to be careful which text you use. For us, it's the matrix here. And the simple lemma is that the Grammy on is always positive.
00:41:08.734 - 00:41:09.954, Speaker C: So lemo.
00:41:13.574 - 00:41:15.630, Speaker A: For any h one up.
00:41:15.662 - 00:41:23.714, Speaker C: To h n. Let me give a notation to this.
00:41:25.014 - 00:41:27.614, Speaker A: Let me call it g. Or if.
00:41:27.654 - 00:41:32.070, Speaker C: I want to mention element g of.
00:41:32.102 - 00:41:35.190, Speaker A: H one up to hn g o.
00:41:35.262 - 00:41:40.594, Speaker C: H one up to h n is always bigger than or equal to zero.
00:41:41.214 - 00:41:54.486, Speaker A: And moreover. Moreover, g is strictly positive if and.
00:41:54.550 - 00:42:01.384, Speaker C: Only if h one up to h n are independent.
00:42:06.604 - 00:42:08.704, Speaker A: The proof is very straightforward.
00:42:16.924 - 00:42:23.056, Speaker C: We can see the yeah, y n.
00:42:23.160 - 00:42:27.744, Speaker A: In cn elements and ask what is.
00:42:27.824 - 00:42:35.680, Speaker C: G of y and y? Well, we know what it is, is.
00:42:35.872 - 00:42:42.084, Speaker A: Sum over I and j.
00:42:43.504 - 00:42:52.704, Speaker C: The coefficients here are the coefficients y. It's better to call them alpha. I don't know why it call it y book.
00:42:54.804 - 00:43:04.556, Speaker A: Alpha I bar alpha j and g I j the element in row I.
00:43:04.700 - 00:43:28.480, Speaker C: And column j in matrix capital g. So it's. Let's. Let's write it as a doubt. Sum a from one up to n j from one to n alpha r alpha j.
00:43:28.672 - 00:43:32.400, Speaker A: And this is hi inner product with.
00:43:32.432 - 00:43:33.284, Speaker C: A j.
00:43:36.864 - 00:43:46.764, Speaker A: In the space h. And take the coefficients inside and sum them up.
00:43:47.384 - 00:44:19.912, Speaker C: It's sum I from one to n alpha I bar h I, sum j from one to n alpha j or h j, which is the norm squared. And this is bigger than, as you.
00:44:19.928 - 00:44:44.274, Speaker A: See all the time I kept bar over alpha I and here I end up with alpha I bar hi. So it's sounds to put bar on alpha j, but it really doesn't matter. And this happens many, many times. One thing this shows is that g is positive. G o y is always positive.
00:44:44.354 - 00:44:48.094, Speaker C: So that's the meaning of being positive.
00:44:48.474 - 00:44:54.594, Speaker A: And moreover, g of y and y is equal to zero.
00:44:54.714 - 00:45:06.254, Speaker C: If and only if sum I from one to n alpha bar h is equal to zero. And this is in h.
00:45:10.794 - 00:45:24.104, Speaker A: And strictly bigger than zero means that this combination, if y, what does. Let's recall what does g is strictly.
00:45:24.144 - 00:45:25.724, Speaker C: Bigger than zero mean?
00:45:26.064 - 00:45:32.504, Speaker A: This is equivalent to say that if y is not identically zero g of.
00:45:32.624 - 00:45:50.704, Speaker C: Y, like this is strictly bigger than zero, strictly bigger than zero.
00:45:55.004 - 00:46:06.484, Speaker A: And we see that this happens. This happens even only if for any y equal to zero, sum of alpha.
00:46:06.524 - 00:46:17.104, Speaker C: I bar hi is not equal to zero. In other words, hi h one up to h n be independent.
00:46:20.924 - 00:46:24.704, Speaker A: Recall that these are the coefficients of.
00:46:26.924 - 00:46:27.664, Speaker C: Y.
00:46:37.404 - 00:46:49.640, Speaker A: Okay, so now I will continue after the break. We have g which is positive, so more theorem tells us that there is.
00:46:49.712 - 00:46:55.164, Speaker C: An rkhs, so g positive.
00:47:01.024 - 00:47:03.164, Speaker A: G positive, so buy more.
00:47:07.264 - 00:47:11.634, Speaker C: There is an age which we can say hog.
00:47:12.214 - 00:47:23.166, Speaker A: So now we want to see what is this hog? And this will also answer the question.
00:47:23.270 - 00:47:26.142, Speaker C: Which was asked before the first break.
00:47:26.278 - 00:47:43.374, Speaker A: Because when we have conjugated, we'll see it here again. In a sense, in a sense h of g is the same as h but the inner product is conjugated. We will see after the break.
