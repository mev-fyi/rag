00:00:02.560 - 00:01:30.174, Speaker A: So what I would like to explain is how this circle action leads to this curve that fack and von Tinn has constructed in pieticoc theory. So? So if we have a curve x and a point on the curve, so I will call the point infinity. So we should think that x is a complete curve, and in a second I will take x to be just the projective line. So then we have the inclusion of the complement of this point, which is open. But Grotendig has told us that we should think of the formal completion of x along infinity as a tubular neighborhood of the point. We don't have two tubular neighborhoods in algebraic geometry, but the formal completion behaves as if it was and a tubular neighborhood. In particular, this map here behaves as if it is an open inclusion and an affine map.
00:01:30.174 - 00:02:44.904, Speaker A: And then this thing here, which is actually open, now behaves as if it's closed, because we can think that there's not much difference between this and x, but not y instead. And then here's this punctured formal completion. And this philosophy is substantiated in this, between the stable infinity categories of quasi coherent sheaves. So we have the quasi coherence sheaves on x, the quasi coherence sheaves on this tubular neighborhood, and the quasi coherence sheaves on the complement. And this behaves as if it's a closed inclusion. And this behaves as if it's an open inclusion. Also, this function, this push forward here from the formal completion is t exact, which it should be if it is affine.
00:02:44.904 - 00:04:06.464, Speaker A: Okay, so now on this curve we have these. So we have the structure sheath, and then we have this, which we can think of as functions with a simple zero at infinity. And we have its dual, which we can think of as miramorphic functions with a simple polar infinity. And then the way we get the curve is that the curve is part of this graded ring, which we get by taking global sections of all these twists of the structure sheath. Okay, so how does this look in the case of p one? So let x be p one and let t be a coordinate around this chosen point. So then if we calculate. Yeah, so now we move this heath to these three pieces, and there we can calculate the sections.
00:04:06.464 - 00:04:56.584, Speaker A: At this complement we get a polynomial algebra on t inverse. At the punctured formal neighborhood, we get a Lorang series ring in t. And then here we really get a power series ring. But the way it includes here depends on n. So it includes this sub k double bracket t module, which is generated by t to the minus n. And then we can calculate the global sections. That's the limit of this diagram.
00:04:56.584 - 00:06:13.072, Speaker A: It's the part here and here that meets here. And h one is the co limit. So it's the parts in here that are not hit by these two maps, so to speak. Okay, so what does that look like? If n is positive? So then we have global sections, namely we have this k vector space, which is generated by one t inverse and down to t to the minus n. So this is, think of these as neuromorphic functions that have a pole of depth, n at infinity, and there's no h one. And if n is negative, then there are no global sections and instead there's an h one, which is this k vector space here. Note that if n is minus one, then this goes from t to one.
00:06:13.072 - 00:06:53.874, Speaker A: So in fact that means zero. So when n is minus one, both h zero and h one are zero. Okay? And then here is now what p one is. P one is proits of this graded ring. Of course, we can write this graded ring in many different ways. So here I have made this non canonical choice of a coordinate at infinity, and then it takes this form. This is of course a canonical way of writing it.
00:06:53.874 - 00:08:19.174, Speaker A: But now to calculate that group, I made this choice. Okay, so now next I want to explain how these terms here appear from spectra with a trivial circle action. So what is a spectrum with a trivial circle action? So a spectrum is a point in the infinity category of spectra. So it's a map from the point which I call one, then two spectrum. Now, how does such a spectrum determine what is a spectrum with a circle action or with a g action? In general, it's a map from the classifying space bg to the infinity category of spectra. And to say that the action is trivial means that it factors like this, that it factors through the projection that collapses the whole classifying space to a point and then maps everything to that point. Okay, so now I write P e for this composition here.
00:08:19.174 - 00:08:54.370, Speaker A: So let me write that here. So this composition here is P e. So this is just the spectrum e, considered as a spectrum with trivial circle action. So now we can take the fixed points or the homotopy fixed points of that spectrum, the circle action. And we can take the Tate spectrum. Yeah. When we get to cyclic homology, this will correspond to negative cyclic homology.
00:08:54.370 - 00:09:43.454, Speaker A: And this will correspond to periodic cyclic homology. So whenever we have a spectrum with circle action, we have spectral sequences which look like this. So yeah, maybe it's easier to look at this picture. So here on the fiber, sorry. Here on the baseline we have the, on this side here we have the cohomology of the classifying space of the circle, which is p infinity c. And if we look at the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, then we don't have this side here. So we just have this side.
00:09:43.454 - 00:10:37.554, Speaker A: And now each of these lines is then a copy of the, the homotopic groups of the spectrum e. And what sits in degree zero is what is along this diagonal line here. Yeah. And then the tate is made by inverting this element v so that it becomes periodic. Yeah. Let's look at the exhaumomorphism in the spectral sequence. So this is the forgetful or the inclusion of the fixed points in everything.
00:10:37.554 - 00:12:37.834, Speaker A: So what does that mean? So we have this diagram here, we have the classifying space as the circle, we have a point and we have spectra. And now I just choose some point in the classifying space of the circle. So I just choose a section s of the canonical projection, and then I can restrict along that, and that gives a map, and that induces the etomomorphism in the spectral sequence. But now since the, since the circle action is trivial, that has the consequence that the isomorphism has a section, because, let me see, maybe I can do it like this. No? Yeah, so because we can also restrict along p and that gives a map from, from e back to the fixed points, and because is composed with p is the identity, this becomes a section of the esomomorphism. Okay, well, this means that if e is multiplicative, then the spectral sequences are spectral sequences of PI e algebras. So all differentials have to vanish on elements that are PI e times the element one.
00:12:37.834 - 00:13:24.024, Speaker A: If e is complex orientable, which is the situation that we will be interested in. So for example, if the homotopic groups of e are concentrated in even degrees, so then there are no spectral sequences. Then there are no differentials in the spectral sequence at all. And in that case, we can therefore identify this with this. Yeah, so let's see. So e two was this polynomial algebra. Now this is also e infinity.
00:13:24.024 - 00:15:05.484, Speaker A: And then we can, that it's complex orientable means that we can choose that there exists a homotopy class, which I call the tilter, which restricts to this element v in the spectral sequence. So we can lift this generator to an actual homotopy class. And now the spectral sequence also gives a descending filtration on these homotopic groups. And so the answer is that we get the completion of this polynomial algebra with respect to that filtration so if we have, so if we have an element c here and c squared and c cubed, then, then this will mean that these homotopy groups, PI, p, star, e homotopy fixed points, become, well, if e is periodic, then this becomes a power series ring. So we see that power series, that the power series ring comes out of this picture. But the important thing is that this here is a PI e algebra to begin with. If it's not a PI e algebra, we cannot say that it's a power series algebra, because it has to be an algebra before it can be a power series algebra.
00:15:05.484 - 00:15:48.570, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah. This filtration here corresponds to what in Pierre D. Koch theory is called the Nygaard filtration. So this name is now also used in topology. So I will call it the nicot filtration. As you know, Quillen used this power series description here in a very effective way. So if we have a complex orientable karmology theory, it has an associated formal group.
00:15:48.570 - 00:17:00.844, Speaker A: And this is very useful to analyze all kinds of things. So I will get back to what that corresponds to in the case of hoxhaled homology. Now to hoxhole homology. So the big difference, which is this fantastic discovery that Kahn and Siegan made in the eighties, is that it has a circle action which is not trivial. Well, now, I put a t here for topological Hoxho termology, but it hasn't nothing to do with the tough this is. There's no distinction here between hoxialtalmology and topological axial thermology. In any case, if we have a ring r, then hoxheol homology or topological hoxhealth homology is a spectrum with a circle action.
00:17:00.844 - 00:17:39.984, Speaker A: And now this does not factor through the point. It's not a trivial action. We still have spectral sequences. And now I have written tc minus instead of the homotopy fixed points, because this is what negative cyclic homology is. And instead of Tate, I have written TP. This is periodic cyclic homology. And now the picture looks like this, the same picture as before.
00:17:39.984 - 00:18:56.654, Speaker A: We have this polynomial all the rung algebra here in degree zero. And then each of these vertical lines is a copy of a hochschild homology or topological Hoxhall homology. But now, because the circle hexagon is non trivial, there can be differentials from this line. And in fact, the d two differential is cons b operator. So we see the non triviality of the circle action as manifesting in itself in the b operator. Well, this means that now these are not okay, we again have this edge homomorphism from on PI zero. We have tc minus zero is this whole line, and th 80 is this top quotient here.
00:18:56.654 - 00:19:35.154, Speaker A: So we have the projection onto this top quotient. But now that does not have a section. So cc if r is commutative, then PI naught here is r. But now this is not an r algebra. It's only a ring. It's not an r algebra. So I think my biggest contribution in mathematics is that I have identified what this wing is if r is perfectoid.
00:19:35.154 - 00:20:55.184, Speaker A: So I only did it in the case of the unit disk in the p ed complex plane. And then Batmoer and Schultze proved that the same thing is true for any perfectoid ring. I should also say that this calculation, the starting point for all of these things, is Berksted's periodicity theorem, which is that CHH of FP is a polynomial algebra on a generator of degree two. So yeah, this is not the bot element. It's this Birkstedt element. And yeah, so this is a very important theorem. And unlike bot periodicity, we do not have many proofs of it, as far as I know.
00:20:55.184 - 00:21:46.574, Speaker A: And I hope that we will find new proofs in the. Actually, Bart was speaking at the conference for Iluci, and he said that there's now a new proof. So I look forward to hearing what that proof is. So, all proof so far has used the action of the dialect of algebra on the dual Steenhardt algebra, which is a non trivial calculation. And it would be nice to find a proof that doesn't use that. At any rate, this is the starting point of this calculation. So here, instead of.
00:21:46.574 - 00:22:40.074, Speaker A: So this is not a polynomial algebra, sorry. This is not a power series algebra. In fact, it's not even an r algebra, but it has a filtration, namely this filtration coming from the spectral sequence. And all the filtration quotients are canonically isomorphic to r, just as is the case of the t adic filtration of the power series ring. But the way they glue together is different. So instead, we get this ring here, which is fountain's ring. An and yeah, that's a fantastic ring.
00:22:40.074 - 00:23:35.314, Speaker A: And this is sort of the starting point for this ring is very rigid. And in order to get a p adic geometry that works like complex geometry, you have to make it larger. And so this is what the Falk francine curve is a product of. Okay, so now let me say something about the fack von Tsin curve. So, given an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. There's this curve, the fack von Tim curve. It's a curve over spit qp.
00:23:35.314 - 00:24:33.874, Speaker A: And the closed points on this curve parameterizes on twists, sorry, on tilts of. If. So, it parameterizes algebraically closed fields of characteristics here on such that their tilt is. If. If you don't know what that means, then look at some of Schulz's papers. But it's not so important for this talk. What we can think of is that in f, p is equal to zero, and somehow there are many different ways to.
00:24:33.874 - 00:25:20.354, Speaker A: There are many different incarnations of p. And this curve parameterizes these incarnations. Yeah. So, yeah, if we compare this to p one, then on p one we have this formal variable t. But on the Falkfonten curve, it's the prime number p, that is the variable. So there's not just one p, but there's many, many different p's, and they correspond to the points in this curve. Okay, and now to understand that, we do the same thing as before.
00:25:20.354 - 00:25:58.014, Speaker A: We pick a point. So we pick an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, who's on tilt? No, whose tilt is f. Actually, we should also choose this isomorphism, and we should identify isomorphisms that differ, or that we should identify two isomorphisms if they differ by a power of the Frobenius on f.
00:25:59.874 - 00:26:09.306, Speaker B: Sorry to interrupt you, but I got confused when you say that there were several p. Yeah. Don't you fix the characteristic once and for all?
00:26:09.490 - 00:26:41.770, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I mean, this is not p. No, no, there's only one p. But we should think of p as being the variable. And in the same way as in the power series ring, you can choose many on p one, you can choose many different coordinates in the same way. There are many incarnations of the prime number p. And that's what this curve parameterizes.
00:26:41.922 - 00:26:44.922, Speaker B: Okay, fine. Okay, so I got confused. Sorry.
00:26:45.098 - 00:27:28.204, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So there's only one piece. There's only one prime number. They're not two prime numbers. They are all the same p, but they're not quite the same anyway. Okay, so now to analyze this curve, we should calculate the global sections of the ser twists of the structure sheath. And in the case of p one, this looked like this, but now it looks like this instead.
00:27:28.204 - 00:28:33.394, Speaker A: So the Loran power, the ring of Loran series, is replaced by this ring called be the run from ten deron. It's a discrete valuation field. So it's a field with a discrete valuation and fill zero be the round is its valuation ring. And then there's this other ring here called be, which. Let me put these up so you can, you can compare them. So be plays the role of this polynomial ring in t inverse B. The round plays the role of the field of the wrong series, and fill minus n be, the round plays the role of this guy here.
00:28:33.394 - 00:30:06.634, Speaker A: And if we consider the filtrations, they almost look like the filtrations here. It's not true for this ring be. And that's an important point which we will come back to. So how do we get this out of cyclic homology? Well, I should say that after this theorem here, after Fonten's ring showed up, I think Schulze was the first person from arithmetic geometry who was willing to consider these homotopy theory methods. And then he realized that things that exist in Pierre de Koch's theory do not have a parallel in the classical theory of topological cyclic homology. And so that led to a new and much better description by Nicolaus and Scholze. And it also made it clear what the nature of the Frobenius that you have on topological cyclic homology as opposed to cyclic homology, what the nature of that is.
00:30:06.634 - 00:31:40.164, Speaker A: This has led to a huge development in the last five years, and which has a lot of new, wonderful results have been proved. One of them is this theorem here by Nco, Matthew, Mauro and Nicolaus. And I should say that the theorem is based on work of Clausen, Matthew and Moro, which Dustin will talk about in his talk on Thursday. So let me say what this theorem says. If r is a commutative ring, which is Hencelian along p, for example, p complete, then there's a Cartesian square like this. So here, this is k theory of r, and then it's completed at p, and then p is inverted. So when I write with qp coefficients, I mean first completed p and then invert p here, this is c c minus completed at p, and then p inverted, and then Nigar completed.
00:31:40.164 - 00:32:38.094, Speaker A: So we also, after we invert p, it's no longer complete with respect to this Nigard filtration. So we complete it again. And here, whether you put a t on h here makes no difference. So we could also take hc minus instead of tc minus on this side. This is the new ingredient, really, in their paper, namely, it's a crystalline churn character. This goes from K theory of r mod p with qp coefficients, and then to periodic cyclic homology. And the theorem is that this square is cartesian.
00:32:38.094 - 00:33:28.464, Speaker A: This is called the Berlinson fiber square, because Beelinson had proved a version of, he had proved a version of this under stronger assumptions. But this new technology with the Nikolaus Scholze Forbenius makes it possible to prove it in a much more slick way. And in this generality here. Okay, so now we take r to be the unit disk in this field, c. Yeah, so c is algebraically closed and p complete. I think I didn't say before that it's p complete. That's important.
00:33:28.464 - 00:34:42.916, Speaker A: So we can take the unit disk, and because we are in an ultrametric situation, the unit disk is a ring again. And. Yeah, so now we get, now we get these rings that shows up from this situation very simply. So, by a calculation or by a theorem of Bachmore and Schofield, we get the ring be by taking this ring here and then inverting the bot element and then taking the degree zero part. So, so we take this ring, we invert the bot element, and then we take the part in that graded ring, which sits in degree zero. And that ring is Fontene's ring be. And by the way, this ring is a Pid, which was a starting point for fac.
00:34:42.916 - 00:35:41.784, Speaker A: And Francine's discovery of the curve that this ring is a Pid, just like the polynomial ring is a pid. And now these other parts are derived in the same way. Take periodic cyclic homology, nigrad completed, invert the bot element and take the degree zero part. Then this is the ring b the rom. And if we. So, to get the fill zero part, this is also called beta one plus. So we take t c minus complete at p, invert p nigard complete, invert the bot element, and take the degree zero part.
00:35:41.784 - 00:36:50.684, Speaker A: So this geometry here of the fack van Zen curve with this choice of point is reflected in this square here, where r is Oc. So. So let me point out now a big difference between this and p one. So we got p one in more or less the same way by considering complex orientable cohomology theories with trivial circle action. And so if we have p one over k, then its global sections is k. But here's a big difference. Namely.
00:36:50.684 - 00:38:17.248, Speaker A: Well, this k is also the, the residue field at infinity. Here at the facfontaine curve, the residue field at the point infinity is this huge field c. But now, because of this non triviality of the circle action, the global sections is just Qp. So it's the fact that the circle action is trivial that cuts down this group of global sections from being this enormous field to just being the field QP. And yeah, this has fantastic consequences. So far has now used this in their geometrization of the local lenglands correspondence, where, again, when you look at the moduli stack of t bundles on the Wach front zen curve, its global sections is the QP points in the group G and not the c points, which you might otherwise think. Yeah.
00:38:17.248 - 00:38:22.324, Speaker A: So I think that was actually everything I have to say. So I think we are back on schedule.
00:38:26.264 - 00:38:35.424, Speaker B: Amazing, Lars. Okay, well. Okay. Let's thank Lars for a really great talk. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
00:38:35.424 - 00:38:45.972, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Lars. Yeah. So, I'm sure there are plenty of questions, and so I want to ask.
00:38:46.028 - 00:39:12.184, Speaker C: Lars one thing, if I understand. Well, the fact that you have at the end a QP, it's due to the fact that there is a universal perfection. And then the wit. So then you sort of get, rather than the bottom structure, you get already through the witness something like deformation. So that's the role of QP there.
00:39:13.284 - 00:39:47.574, Speaker A: Well, it's actually because of this, the delicacy of this map here. So, of course, this C does not disappear. So it goes somewhere else. And what happens is that. So for P, one o of minus one has trivial h one.
