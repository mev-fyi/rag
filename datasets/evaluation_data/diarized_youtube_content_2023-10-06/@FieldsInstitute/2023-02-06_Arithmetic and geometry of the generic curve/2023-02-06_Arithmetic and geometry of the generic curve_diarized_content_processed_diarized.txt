00:00:00.440 - 00:00:34.914, Speaker A: All right, Paimon, thank you so much for the introduction and the invitation. It's nice to be here virtually, even though I'm also kind of here in person. And also, just before I begin, please interrupt me and ask any questions you have. I'm hoping the talk is kind of down to earth and accessible. So if you don't understand something, you should tell me, and I'll try to clear it up. All right, so my goal today is to tell you about some kind of elementary problem in linear algebra. Actually, that's come up in a number of recent conjectures and how you can say something about it using input from hodge theory and arithmetic.
00:00:34.914 - 00:01:16.220, Speaker A: And everything I'm going to say today is joint with Aaron Landsman. And if you'd like to look at the paper, it's canonical representations of surface groups on the archive we posted in May 22, 2022. And at the very end, I might mention some new results that are not, not yet posted, but we'll see if we have time. All right, so I want to start with some kind of very standard geometric situation. So you have a map, let's say a smooth projective map from x to s, where these are the algebraic varieties. If you'd like. If you're really arithmetically minded, you can take s to be a point.
00:01:16.220 - 00:01:50.194, Speaker A: Even then, that's already interesting. But let's just say for now, these are varieties of the complex numbers. And in that setting, if you have varieties of complex numbers in a smooth, proper map like this, maybe let me indicate that it's smooth and proper. So, topologically trivial, there's kind of a linearization of this data. So there's a topological invariant, which is a representation of the fundamental group of s on the homology of x. So, loosely speaking, you take a cycle upstairs, you drag it in a circle, and then it goes to maybe a new cycle. And that's what this measures.
00:01:50.194 - 00:02:55.834, Speaker A: There's an arithmetic analog of this. So if s is spec k for k, let's say a number field, then you get a representation of the absolute gala group of k on the ellatic homology of x. And in both of these cases, there's some kind of general heuristic, which is that the image of this representation should be as big as possible. So I'll give some examples of this, but maybe for the number theorists in the audience, probably all of you have seen some version of this. When x is an elliptic curve over a number field, or even, let's say, over q. So over q, Sare's open image theorem tells us well, even if we put the Adele's here, this has open image for non sam elliptic curves. Um, in this elatic setting, there's a theorem of Bogomolov that says that this has, this has, uh, open image for non cmolytic, non cm elliptic curves, or even abelian, sort of generic abelian varieties.
00:02:55.834 - 00:03:25.598, Speaker A: So that's what I mean by big in that setting. So for example, what is it? What is it? As big as possible means as big as, as meets all the constraints there are. So like if you have a cm elliptic curve, there's semester constraints, so the monitor will be smaller, but if not, there's no constraints in the new big image. And I'll give some kind of geometric versions of this in a second. Okay, so here's kind of, I think, the most basic example for algebraic geometers. So you take MG, is the modulized space of curves. And I'll tell you all about that in the next few slides.
00:03:25.598 - 00:03:59.410, Speaker A: And while it's a modulized space, so it has a universal curve over it. So in other words, a point of this, while a point of this is a curve, it's a, this is a parameter space of curves. And the fiber of that point is that curve. In this setting, we have kind of a famous representation. So PI, one of this moduli space, acts on the cohomology of the curve. Are there any questions about what this representation is? Okay, so let me say what I mean, that it has big image. Well, in this case, it's really a very explicit thing.
00:03:59.410 - 00:04:33.090, Speaker A: So there's two structures on this group that have to be preserved by the action. So one is that, well, inside of HCQ is HCz. So there's the integral homology, so that has to be preserved by the action. And then there's another structure which comes from Concordia, like the cut product. There's an alternating form on this coming from the cut product. Okay, and what that tells us, oops, sorry, I skipped a slide. What tells us what that tells us is, well, this action factors through the integer matrices and it preserves the cup product, so it preserves a symplectic form.
00:04:33.090 - 00:05:10.454, Speaker A: And then it's a not totally trivial theorem, but at this point, extremely well known that this factorization through sp, two g of z, the integral matrices preserving a form, is actually surjective. So, well, what does it mean? It means the image of the monotremy representation, the image of this representation is as big as it could possibly be, subject to the two constraints we listed. Okay, we're going to slightly generalize the setting. So I'm going to allow points on my curve. So I'm going to work with MGN, the Mongolia space of genus g curves with n marked points. And this is going to be the universal puncture curve. So I'll take those curves and I'll delete the punctures.
00:05:10.454 - 00:05:35.976, Speaker A: And again, we have a representation like this. So PI, one of the moduli space, and I'll make this more explicit soon, acts on the kolmology of this fiber. Okay, so what I want to study is a non abelian version of this. Okay, and what is it? Well, PI, one of the module histories, doesn't act just on the commology. It actually acts on the whole fundamental group by outer automorphisms.
00:05:36.120 - 00:05:36.352, Speaker B: And.
00:05:36.368 - 00:06:17.670, Speaker A: Well, why is this? Like you can take a loop upstairs and drag it around in a circle and you get a new loop. And I'm just going to not mod out by homology by two loops being homologous to each other. I'll actually just mod out by them being homotopy equivalent to each other. So that doesn't give an honest action by automorphisms, because two homotopy equivalent, loop like homotopy, like PI, is about based homotopy, not honest homotopy, but the difference between based homotopy and honest hope is the inner automorphism. So elements of PI, one itself. So you get a representation like this of the mapping class group into the outer automorphism group. And by the way, this is actually a really explicit thing, and I'll talk about it in a bit.
00:06:17.670 - 00:06:44.218, Speaker A: But like, if n is zero, this is almost an isomorphism. So this is fine. This thing has index two here. If n is zero and it's injected, if n is positive, you can explicitly describe the image. Okay? So I want to understand what it means for this to have big image. I just told you we can describe it, but that doesn't mean it's so easy. So let me, let me, sorry, I'm skipping a lot of slides here.
00:06:44.218 - 00:06:53.844, Speaker A: Okay, so let me say what this group is that we're interested in, Daniel. N, just remind me, n is the number of punctures, right? N is the number of punctures, g is the genus of the curve.
00:06:53.884 - 00:06:55.340, Speaker B: That's right, yeah.
00:06:55.492 - 00:07:37.872, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to call this group mod gn, and it has kind of an explicit description. So in terms of topology. So if you set sigma gn to be our surface. So this has, this has g holes, so it's a g whole torus with n functors. So this group, the fundamental group of the moduli space of genus g curves with n mark points has a really explicit topological description. So you take the orientation preserving homeomorphisms of this space. And so here I'm thinking of the punctures as marked points.
00:07:37.872 - 00:07:58.914, Speaker A: So these homeomorphisms have to send the punctures to themselves. Um, well, that's, uh, this is a topological group with the CoMPaCt OpeN topoLogy, and you take PI, zero of that. Okay, so this is some very explicit thing. You can write down generators and relations for it if you want. Like, if you ask your local topologist, I'll give an example when. When g is zero. Soon.
00:07:58.914 - 00:08:30.054, Speaker A: Uh, and we'd like to understand, uh, this action. So, so the action of this group or the outer action on the fundamental group of our curve, it's a purely topological question, or even purely Group theoretic. Like you, you can write down generators and relations for this group. You've all seen them. There's 2g plus n generators in one relation, and generators and relations for this group. They're a little more complicated, and you can say exactly how they act. Okay, so what's the invariant we're going to be looking at? Well, if we act on a group, we act on representations of that group.
00:08:30.054 - 00:08:55.674, Speaker A: So here, this is the set of representations PI. And if we have an outer action on the group, then we act on representations up to conjugacy. Okay, so here, this is representations up to conjugacy. Why do we act? Well, an inner automorphism, an element of PI, one sends a representation to a conjugate representation. So an outer representation acts on conjugacy classes of representations.
00:08:56.974 - 00:08:57.670, Speaker B: Oops.
00:08:57.782 - 00:09:43.728, Speaker A: Okay, and the question I'd like to ask is, does this action have big image? And we'll formulate this more precisely soon, and I'll explain kind of how this has come up recently in a number of conjectures. But let me just say that this question has been studied in various incarnations by a lot of people. So, notably Goldman, Pickrell and Shaw have studied things like. So here, they've studied things like ergodicity of the action. Maybe if you replace GLR with the unitary group that they've studied kind of density of orbits. Okay, and this is far from a complete summary of the work that's been done on this question from kind of a topological point of view, um, from an algebra geometric point of view. A lot of work has been done by.
00:09:43.728 - 00:09:45.296, Speaker A: By Katzlerkov, Pentef and Simpson.
00:09:45.360 - 00:09:45.696, Speaker B: So I.
00:09:45.720 - 00:10:24.212, Speaker A: But I won't say anything about that. Okay, so before we start studying this action, like, let me show you some examples, just to show you that it's like a really explicit thing. So the first simple example is, well, let's set n to be zero. So we're looking at a genus g curve with no mark points, so no punctures, a compact curve, and r is one. So in other words, we're looking at the action of this group on one dimensional representations of PI. Okay, well, what are one dimensional representations of PI? They're just c star to the 2g. Any one dimensional representation factors through homology, which is z to the.
00:10:24.212 - 00:10:29.744, Speaker A: So if you'd like, you can think of this space as h, one of the surface with c star coefficients.
00:10:30.524 - 00:10:30.892, Speaker B: Okay?
00:10:30.908 - 00:10:58.364, Speaker A: And here we've actually already seen this action. So this action factors through the action on homology. It's just the action of sp 2g on this set. Okay, here's kind of a more interesting example. I'm going to take g to be zero, r arbitrary and n big, maybe. Okay, so what are the representations of this group? Well, this group you can think of. So here we have a sphere minus a bunch of points.
00:10:58.904 - 00:10:59.240, Speaker B: PI.
00:10:59.272 - 00:11:38.086, Speaker A: One is given by loops around those points. And what property do they have? Well, the product of those loops has to be one, right? Because if you kind of go around all these loops, you can contract the composition by wrapping it around the back of the sphere. Okay, so this is the set we're acting on, and I can tell you explicitly how some generators of this group act. So they act by this funny formula. So let's talk about it a little bit. So if I have an n tuple of matrices, which multiply to one, what I'm allowed to do is switch two of them. So here I switch to qi and qi plus one, but at the cost of conjugating the second one, the first one by the second one.
00:11:38.086 - 00:12:21.856, Speaker A: Okay? And if you just stare at this formula for a minute, you'll see that this preserves the property that the product of the matrices is one. So this gives you an action of the braid group on the set of matrices, and the braid group is the fundamental group of this module space. So that's a fun little exercise. If you stare at the presentation for the braid group, you can see that these operations satisfy that presentation. So let's go back to our very simple example, though, and make some observations about it, and then I'll tell you the kind of conjectures that those observations inspired and where they come from. Okay, so there's two observations that are both kind of obvious about this action. So here we had the.
00:12:21.856 - 00:12:43.806, Speaker A: This is the n is zero case. R is one case, the simplest possible case. It's just basically the same as the action on homology. The thing we started with. Okay, so the first observation is that all the finite orbits are torsion points. So this is a little exercise. So what do we mean by torsion? So an element of this is like a 2g tuple of non zero complex numbers, torsion.
00:12:43.806 - 00:12:55.114, Speaker A: I just mean those numbers are all roots of unity. Okay, and it's a little exercise to stare at the sp 2g action on this thing and check that the only finite orbits are just the 2g tuples of roots of unity.
00:12:56.294 - 00:12:57.206, Speaker B: Okay?
00:12:57.390 - 00:13:05.914, Speaker A: So the finite orbits are exactly the torsion points. The second observation is that while those torsion points are risky dense.
00:13:06.534 - 00:13:06.974, Speaker B: Okay?
00:13:07.014 - 00:13:14.494, Speaker A: So in other words, any polynomial equation which vanishes on all roots of unity is actually the zero polynomial.
00:13:14.874 - 00:13:15.746, Speaker B: Okay?
00:13:15.930 - 00:13:23.050, Speaker A: Okay, so these two observations, I think, motivated two conjectures. You mean non finite orbits?
00:13:23.202 - 00:13:23.706, Speaker B: No, no, no.
00:13:23.730 - 00:13:35.918, Speaker A: Finite orbits. All the finite orbits union together are. There is the union of the finite orbits. Yeah, yeah, maybe. Let me write that. So the union of the finite orbits is the risky density. I thought you said that the c.
00:13:35.918 - 00:13:51.074, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Um. All right. Okay, so so these are both. I mean, the second thing is is kind of, uh, you know, sort of, probably you've seen it before. The first thing is, is a little exercise with the group theory of sp 2g. It's not not totally trivial.
00:13:51.074 - 00:14:15.412, Speaker A: Okay, so. So, uh, it was conjectured by. By two groups of number theorists that both of these properties generalized. So, so let me tell you those conjectures and where they come from. Okay, so, so here's the action we're studying. So, we've the PI, one of the module I space, or the symmetries of a genus g surface with n mark points acting on the set of representations up to conjugacy. Okay, so the first conjecture was made by Kissen and Wang.
00:14:15.412 - 00:14:49.226, Speaker A: And the conjecture is that if g is large compared to the rank of the representation, the finite orbits are exactly the representations of the finite image. So that's the analog of all the finite orbits being torsion points. So maybe. Let me say a word about the history here. So, I think kissing conjectured this around 2010, and he conjectured it without this condition, without the Jbake condition, and it's false without that condition. So that was discovered. It's not so hard to see, but it was discovered a couple of years later, and then Wang corrected it.
00:14:49.226 - 00:15:33.986, Speaker A: So Wang added this condition. So where did these congestions come from both Kissen and Wang are number theorists. So Kissen was motivated by some potential applications to the peak curvature conjecture, which is a conjecture of growth and deconcats about the arithmetic of differential equations. And actually, that's how I came to this subject, too. Wang is a student of Sarnak, who, or was a student of Sarnak, I guess, who was motivated by Bourgein, Gambert and Sarnak's work on strong approximation for character varieties. So these sets have some underlying algebraic structure. They're actually defined over z, their algebraic varieties over z, if you'd like, if you formulate things appropriately.
00:15:33.986 - 00:16:21.458, Speaker A: And in the case when g is zero, n is four, and r is two, bourgain, Gambard, and Sarnak proved that they satisfy some form of strong approximation. And so Wang was trying to generalize, or I think it's still attempting to generalize that statement beyond that very special case, the G is zero and is four are as two case. And sort of the first step in bourgeois and Gambit Sarnach's work is to understand something about the finite orbits in that case. So this would be sort of the first step in understanding the kind of cases where the invariants are larger. So maybe, let me write. So Wang was motivated by strong approximation or character varieties. Maybe.
00:16:21.458 - 00:16:49.304, Speaker A: Let me just remark that there's been a lot of really excellent work done on this letter topic by will Chen recently. So if you came to the algebraic geometry seminar, maybe you saw his talk last semester, but will prove some really remarkable results. Also, when g is zero and is four and r is two. Okay, so this generalizes the observation we made before that all finite orbits were, were torsion points. So what about Zeriski density?
00:16:49.764 - 00:16:50.260, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:16:50.292 - 00:17:09.664, Speaker A: Let me just say, before I go on. So this condition is necessary. I'll give some examples later in the talk where if g is small compared to the rank, there are lots of finite orbits with infinite image. But I want to say this is kind of a naive formulation. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean, it's like the simplest possible formulation of what it would mean for this action to have a big image. It says there's not many finite orbits.
00:17:09.964 - 00:17:10.348, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:10.396 - 00:17:40.694, Speaker A: So if the action was very small, you would expect a lot of finite orbits. Okay, so this is the finite orbits are exactly the things that are forced to have finite orbit. I mean, anything with finite image, you can't really move around very much. It's forced to have that same image no matter how you move it. Okay, so what about this is risky density. So what I'm writing down here is a consequence of a conjecture of Eno and Kurtz and Buter Wang. So both groups conjectured this separately, or conjectured something that implies this separately.
00:17:40.694 - 00:18:05.836, Speaker A: I'll say a little bit about what they conjectured, but whatever they conjectured, it implies. Sorry, this, this, the condition. There's no, this condition isn't here. Sorry. The conjecture is that the finite orbits are zursky dense. Okay, just like in the case, just like in the case where r is one.
00:18:05.940 - 00:18:07.424, Speaker B: So the case we saw.
00:18:08.284 - 00:18:53.200, Speaker A: Okay, so what did anal Kurtz and Buterwing actually conjecture? So what they actually conjectured is that if you have any algebraic variety, the representations of its fundamental group, also known as local systems, which are of geometric origin. So, meaning they show up in the komology of a family of varieties, like what we saw in the very first slide. So they conjectured that those are risky dense. But if you apply that conjecture to a generic Riemann surface, so generic point of the modulo space, it immediately implies this. So this is the consequence I've been studying. Daniel, may I ask, for me, as an outsider, as a naive looking, the conjectures seems to contradict each other to me rather. That's right.
00:18:53.200 - 00:19:05.584, Speaker A: You're one step ahead. That's actually the next line because of the Jodan lemma. No, exactly right. Yeah. So these conjectures contradict each other if r is bigger than one. So it's. I see, yeah, that's exactly right.
00:19:05.584 - 00:19:36.504, Speaker A: So these conjectures cannot both be true. That's sort of the point of the talk. So, in fact, one of them is true and one of them is false. And I'm going to tell you which one, which one is true, which one is false? Does it actually. Does anyone have a guess? It's all right, if not, I think the first one is more likely to be true. Yeah. So what I'm going to tell you about is that the, the first conjecture is true and the second conjecture is false.
00:19:36.504 - 00:20:07.722, Speaker A: Maybe, let me. That said, I think the second conjecture was kind of like an inspiring conjecture, and some version of it should be true. So, like, I'm working on something right now with bo tangling, where we try to salvage part of it. A big motivation for them is that some version over finite fields is actually true. So there was quite a bit of evidence for the second conjecture, even though it's false. Okay, so let me tell you the main theorem. So this is all joint work with Aaron Linesman.
00:20:07.722 - 00:20:47.958, Speaker A: So we have this action, the mapping class group PI, one of the moduli space acts on the set of representations up to conjugacy. And the theorem is that if g is big compared to r, so g bigger than r squared minus one. By the way, it's not a coincidence that this is the dimension of SLR. Then if you have a representation like this, whose conjugacy class has finite orbit, then it has finite image. Okay, so this is an effective version of this conjecture of kissing and Wang. So Kissen just said that there's kissing, and Wang just said, if g is big compared to r, and this is an explicit thing, then this is true. We proved it.
00:20:47.958 - 00:21:20.914, Speaker A: And it implies, as Alex observed, that this conjecture of Ano Kurtz and Buter Wang is false. So, strictly speaking, what we showed is that a consequence of their conjecture is false. But if a consequence of the conjecture is false, then the conjecture is false. Okay, so that's what we've proved, and the proof is involved. So I'll say a little bit about it at the end of the talk, but it relies on a lot of things. It relies on the work of Machizuki and Simpson, on non abelian Hodge theory, and input from the Leyland's program through recent work of a. No groening.
00:21:20.914 - 00:22:03.346, Speaker A: So let me just say a word about it. Maybe I want to stress, like, the statement itself is actually like an elementary linear algebra statement you could explain to a high school student, or like, well, maybe an undergraduate, maybe it depends on which country your high school students are in. So what is one of these things? It's like a bunch of matrices satisfying one relation. If n is positive, it's even just a bunch of matrices like PI. One is a free group. You act on those matrices via some explicit transformations. Like, you can write down this action totally explicitly, and you want to know if the n tuple of matrices has finite orbit up to conjugacy, does it generate a finite subgroup of GLR? So it's just like an explicit linear algebra problem.
00:22:03.346 - 00:22:54.444, Speaker A: So let me just say, like, I would really like a sort of high school or undergraduate level proof. I think somehow the statement, you know, of course, I'm very happy to have found a proof, but the statement doesn't deserve, like, doesn't deserve all the technology we were forced to throw at it. Okay, so at the end of the talk, I'm going to say something about where the proof comes from, but I want to tell you a little bit about the history of this problem beyond what I've already told you. So, in some sense, this action and its finite orbits have been studied since the beginning of the 20th century. So I want to, in some other contexts. So not the context of like, Aino and Kurtz and Buterwing and kissing Junho Peter Wang. But, and so I want to give you some of the history and tell you something about what people knew about it, even in, like, the 1910s or 1920s.
00:22:54.444 - 00:23:58.978, Speaker A: Before I do that, are there any questions about the main result? Okay, so let me give you some history, and I also want to just give you some examples of, of finite orbits. So, I told you before that not all finite orbits have finite image like you need this big g condition. And so I'm going to give you a bunch of examples and show you that somehow these finite orbits in general are connected to really beautiful mathematics. Okay, so here's something horrible or beautiful, depending on your preferences. So this is the case of the genus zero, n marked four marked points and rank two, strictly speaking, where we look at sl two representations, not gl two. So what is this? This is the panlove six equation. It's nonlinear second order ode, and it has the following kind of amazing property, which is that finite orbits of PI, one of the module I space.
00:23:58.978 - 00:24:18.278, Speaker A: So mod zero four on sl two c representations of this group. So maybe, let me just remark. So this is just f three. This is actually f two. PI one of m zero four is m zero four is p one minus three points. So its fundamental group is free on two generators. Sorry, this is seven.
00:24:18.278 - 00:24:49.306, Speaker A: It's a three. There's some explicit action, and these things correspond in a slightly complicated way to algebraic solutions to this differential equation. And I'll say where that comes from in a little bit. So this correspondence is a little complicated. So what's actually true is that there's some kind of equivalence relation here, which corresponds to. So there's a map from, from the bottom to the top. And that map is subjective and sort of explicit, but it does collapse.
00:24:49.306 - 00:24:51.154, Speaker A: Sorry. There's a map from the top to the bottom.
00:24:51.194 - 00:24:51.814, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:24:52.154 - 00:25:22.654, Speaker A: But it collapses some things. But the equivalence relation is also completely explicit, so it's not more or less. You can, this is almost a nice, you can think. Okay, so, right, so I just told you we have some, some differential equation which was written down by Richard Fuchs in 1905, and its algebraic solutions corresponds to this thing we've been interested in, in a very special case. So what's known about the algebraic solutions? Or in other words, what's known about these finite orbits? In that case.
00:25:24.584 - 00:25:25.040, Speaker B: Great.
00:25:25.112 - 00:25:42.284, Speaker A: So here's the statement. There's some correspondence like this, and so, I'm not a mathematical historian. Most of what I've learned about, most of what I know about this, I've learned from Philip Bolch. So I'll try to give some overview, but any mistakes are mine, not his.
00:25:45.664 - 00:25:46.016, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:46.040 - 00:26:19.894, Speaker A: So, in some sense, the classification of these algebraic solutions goes back to Schwarz and Poncare, who wrote down the first ones, maybe, let me remark. So, they were working before 1905, when the equation was written down. So what does it mean? It means that from their work, one can construct some algebraic solutions. So, Schwartz, for example, was writing down all the hypergeometric equations with finite monodromy. So he listed that, and then from those, you can construct algebraic solutions. So this penal base six equation. So people were writing down algebraic solutions, discovering them.
00:26:19.894 - 00:26:50.502, Speaker A: I think the subject was kind of revitalized by Hitchin in 1995, who discovered some new and kind of interesting algebraic solutions. And then after that, I don't know what order I put these in. So there were algebraic solutions found by Andrea Bolch, Kitaev, Hitchin, Duran, and Dubrovin Matsako. Dubrovin. Matsako gave a partial classification. So they classified finite orbits with some assumptions on the representation, so not for every representation. And then, in 2014, Lesothoff and Ticky completed the classification.
00:26:50.502 - 00:27:26.994, Speaker A: So, in this case, there's a complete classification of finite orbits here, or equivalently, algebraic solutions to Penlowe six. The nature of their classification was, it was computer aided. And what they actually showed is that the preexisting solutions, so the things that other people had discovered already were a complete list. So they didn't discover new solutions. So this computer aided classification has the following nature. Uh, there's four continuous infinite families of solutions, one infinite discrete family, which is my favorite one, and. And 45 exceptional families.
00:27:27.614 - 00:27:28.262, Speaker B: Okay?
00:27:28.358 - 00:28:03.714, Speaker A: And already, actually, we can see here that, that this condition, that the g is large, g is large, is necessary. So, so in these examples, there's many, many finite orbits. Uh, many finite orbits here corresponding to representations with infinite image. Um, so, so, for example, in. In here, there's examples with image, the two, three, seven triangle group. And here, there are examples where. Well, okay, so a representation like this is given by four matrices.
00:28:03.714 - 00:28:12.154, Speaker A: And there are examples where the four matrices are conjugate to 11013 times.
00:28:14.024 - 00:28:14.312, Speaker B: And.
00:28:14.328 - 00:28:17.784, Speaker A: Then the fourth one is conjugate to minus one, 10 minus one.
00:28:17.904 - 00:28:18.176, Speaker B: Okay?
00:28:18.200 - 00:28:37.284, Speaker A: So it's not this represent, like, if you just took this representation, or these four matrices, they don't multiply to one. So this is an actual representation. But I'm saying there's a representation where the four generators of this are conjugate to these four matrices in such a way that they multiply to one. And you can see that this can't have finite image because these matrices themselves have infinite order.
00:28:37.624 - 00:28:38.444, Speaker B: Okay?
00:28:39.184 - 00:29:23.454, Speaker A: In fact, this representation is semi simple. The ones in this infinite discrete family, they're really beautiful. Ultimately, they come actually from hitchens solution via an operation called middle convolution, which I'll mention later. Are there any questions about this classification? Okay, what about the next case? So, I gave you some example of a braid group acting on matrices. So, that was this case where g is zero and we've n marked points, and we're looking at arbitrary rank representations. So we're in this setting, and we have the braid group acting on n tuples of matrices which multiply to one. There's the way one studies this is actually, this data gives one an ordinary differential equation.
00:29:23.454 - 00:29:50.684, Speaker A: So the fancy way to write that is that you have a vector bundle on p one and a connection on it, which looks like this. So this is, I think, what people call a fuchsian differential equation. This condition. So these AI are matrices. These lambda I are points in p one. So this differential equation has poles at the lambda I. And this condition that the sum of the matrices is zero, is just saying that there's no pole of infinity.
00:29:51.424 - 00:29:51.792, Speaker B: Okay?
00:29:51.808 - 00:30:47.114, Speaker A: So for each way of choosing a complex structure, I can get a differential equation like this. And what Schlesinger asked himself in 1912 is, well, if I change the complex structure, how should I change these matrices? AI, while fixing this representation, while fixing the monitor mean. And he wrote down this nonlinear ode which classifies the solutions. So, if you want to move the lambda I, while fixing the monitor me of this flat vector bundle, like the monitoring of the solutions to this differential equation, this is how the AI have to change. They have to solve this differential equation, that horrible panel of a six equation we saw earlier. You can reduce this to that equation when n is four and r is two. So that's some kind of little, I shouldn't say it's a little exercise, but it's an exercise.
00:30:47.114 - 00:31:53.694, Speaker A: It's also very fun to work this out somehow with modern technique, it's not that hard to discover this differential equation. From the story I told you, this one is much easier to figure out than the panel base six one. Okay, so here we have this system of ordinary differential equations, and you could ask, well, what are the algebraic solutions? And just like before, the algebraic solutions correspond to finite orbits of this action. Okay, so why is that? Well, what does it mean that there's an algebraic solution? It means that you have a solution to this differential equation which is finitely branched. But what does that mean? It means, as you move these lambdas in a circle, you only get finitely many representations here, or finitely many differential equations. And that's exactly this finite orbit condition. Okay? So morally, that's, that's the reason why there's a correspondence between these two things.
00:31:53.694 - 00:32:18.734, Speaker A: But in this case, we know almost nothing about the classification. So there's lots and lots of algebraic solutions known. I'll give you some examples soon. But, like, outside of this case, when, like, n is four and r is two, I think there's basically no work done when r is not two. There's a little bit of work done when n is five and then n is six is like, it seems like a wide open question. So. Okay, so here are some examples of finite orbits.
00:32:18.734 - 00:32:51.674, Speaker A: Just in general, I want to tell you kind of what we know. Are there any questions before I, before I dive into this? Okay, so let me remind you, we're back in the setting of a pure linear algebra question. You can interpret it as something in terms of differential equations. And I guess I explained how to do that when g is zero, when, when g is positive, you can also do it. You can't really write down explicit formulas, but there's a lot of work done by critter and other people. But let's just go back to this, this pure linear algebra question. So these, this data is, you know, a 2g plus n tuple of matrices up to conjugacy.
00:32:51.674 - 00:33:36.312, Speaker A: And it's acted on in some explicit way by a group. You can write down the presentation of and what are the finite orbits. So I think the first really major work done on this in this generality is due to cats. So, so this space is an algebraic variety, and these rigid local systems. What does it mean to be rigid? It means you're an isolated point of this variety of. From PI one into GlRC mod Glr. Okay, well, if you have an isolated point of this variety, what happens when you, when you.
00:33:36.312 - 00:34:13.300, Speaker A: Well, what happens to the, what's the action of mod Jian on the set of isolated points? Well, it has to permute them. There's only finitely many isolated points. So these isolated points give you finite horrif. And these were completely classified by Katz in some sense. So Katz has this beautiful book from the eighties where he shows that all these rigid local systems, rigid meaning an isolated point. Another way of saying that is that they're determined by the conjugacy classes of the matrices around the punctures. So you can make all of them, starting from rank one, one s, and then applying some kind of slightly inexplicit operations.
00:34:13.300 - 00:34:47.924, Speaker A: So the main one is called the middle convolution, which is computable but involved to compute. I say this only works in genus zero. Of course, if you had a rigid local system in higher genus, the same argument would tell you it's a finite orbit. But it's not so hard to see that the only rigid local, there are no rigid local systems except in genus zero. Okay, there's another kind of obvious example. So this is the one we've been talking about a lot. If you have a representation with finite image that it has finite orbit, why is that you can't move it to a representation which has a different image.
00:34:47.924 - 00:35:04.674, Speaker A: All right, so there's a geometric source of, of these refinite orbits. And the main one is that if you take any local system on CGN, so remember, this was the universal curve over MGN. So if CGN to MGN.
00:35:06.414 - 00:35:06.822, Speaker B: Well, if.
00:35:06.838 - 00:35:42.914, Speaker A: You restrict this to a fiber, it gives you a representation of PI, one of the fiber, which is this thing. And it's kind of a little exercise to see that it has this finite orbit property. I mean, in fact, it's a fixed point. It's much more than finite orbit. And that's just because, I mean, this action kind of comes from thinking about the short exact sequence in PI ones associated to this space. Okay, so I can make examples by making local systems on the universal curve, locally constant sheets or representations of PI, one of the universal curve, if you'd like. And where do those come from? So in genus zero, there are a lot of examples.
00:35:42.914 - 00:36:19.154, Speaker A: So I told you that cats had this middle convolution operator, and Kostov observed that if you apply this to any local system with finite monodromy, then you'll get a finite orbit. And why is that? Well, maybe, let me, before I say why. This middle convolution is kind of a complicated operation. In particular, it can send things with finite monitor media, things which don't finite monitor me. So you produce lots of interesting examples this way. And the reason why this is, is just that whatever this middle convolution operation is, it's equivariant for the action of this group. So if you take something with finite monodromy, in particular finite orbit, then it will still have finite orbit.
00:36:19.154 - 00:37:25.794, Speaker A: Okay, there's another source of local systems on the space which is topological quantum field theory. I won't say anything about that, but basically, whatever tqft is, the definition of it is that it produces for you, for each GNn, at least in some, if you've been extended tqft of the appropriate dimension, a local system on this space. So for the experts, maybe if you've heard of conformal blocks, that's an example, one can produce these finite orbits with conformal blocks. Okay, well what's the most obvious way to produce a local system on CGN? Well, we saw at the beginning the best way to produce a local system is if you have a smooth, proper map, you take the kolmology of the fibers. So here if we have a smooth, proper map, x or x mapping in a smooth copper way to CGN, we can take its kolmology and get an interesting local system on this space. Okay, so how are we going to make such an x? Well, there's a famous way to do so called the could I reparsion trick, and there's lots of other things you can do too, but this is just an example. Well, what you do is you take x to be a family of curves over the universal curve.
00:37:25.794 - 00:37:33.990, Speaker A: And how do you do that? Well, what is a point here? A point here is just a curve with an extra marked point.
00:37:34.182 - 00:37:34.894, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:35.054 - 00:37:52.310, Speaker A: So the fiber of this over here, this over point here is a curve. And so a point on that curve is, well, it's that curve and a point. And I'm going to take x to be the family consisting of covers of c ramified at this point. And you can take like s, three covers of c ramified at that point.
00:37:52.502 - 00:37:52.862, Speaker B: Okay.
00:37:52.878 - 00:38:23.564, Speaker A: And so if, as you move the point around, the COVID is going to move. So you'll get an honestly interesting family of an honestly interesting family of curves over CGN. And if you take the cohomology of that family, it'll give you a local system on CGN. And the restriction to a fiber will have, will have finite monitoring. Okay, let me just say, I mean, I hope I've convinced you that these are all kind of interesting things and my feelings. Yeah, Florian, small question. You said one point x.
00:38:23.564 - 00:38:39.024, Speaker A: Where does the, what do you. Aren't there in. Yeah, so there's n punctures. And here x is a point other than the puncture. So I'm saying a point of this is a punctured curve and a point on that curve. So in other words, Mg, CGn is mGN plus one.
00:38:39.804 - 00:38:40.660, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:38:40.772 - 00:38:44.548, Speaker A: And this map is, you forget the last point. Does that, does that make sense, Florian?
00:38:44.596 - 00:38:45.276, Speaker B: Yes. Thank you.
00:38:45.300 - 00:39:11.654, Speaker A: Great. Yeah, so I hope I've convinced you. I mean, somehow the representations which don't have finite image are all related to really interesting math, and this is some kind of general pattern that I. I think it seems to hold. I'll make some conjectures in general soon. Okay, so let me give you a conjectural picture. So, this is kind of what I know from experience and what I think is true in general, but I can't prove it.
00:39:11.654 - 00:40:03.214, Speaker A: So, the theorem I told you about says that in this regime, where the rank of your representation is less than is small compared to the genus, so r is less than the square root of the genus plus one, every finite orbit has finite image. Okay, I didn't tell you this, but in the regime where r is polynomial in c, I know how to construct lots of examples where a finite orbits with virtually solvable image. So, if you'd like, I can tell you after the talk where those come from. And then finally, in this regime where the rank is exponential in the genus, there seems to be, like, a huge zoo of lots of really interesting representations. So, like, all the ones I've shown you on that previous slides seem to fall in this regime. Okay, so there's a reasonable conjecture here, which I think is that one should be able to really improve this bound if, for example, one requires that the representation be semi simple. But I don't know how to prove that.
00:40:03.214 - 00:40:45.274, Speaker A: By the way, this zoo tells us that really you need this condition that r is big compared to g to prove anything. Okay, so let me make a conjecture about the picture in general. So my conjecture, and I can check this in many cases, and I consider this to be some analog of super rigidity for the mapping class group, is that when g is big, g is at least three. All irreducible local systems on this space are rigid. Okay, and let me just say why that's interesting. So if you. So Simpson has a conjecture about rigid local systems and algebraic varieties, namely, they all come from geometry.
00:40:45.274 - 00:41:13.920, Speaker A: If you believe this conjecture, it would imply that all the finite orbits come from geometric origin, are of geometric origin, meaning they kind of have this kind of explanation. They come from a family of varieties over CGN. So I think that's interesting. I don't have a lot of evidence for this conjecture. I can give some evidence at the end, if you'd like. But let me just say, like, where it comes from is that, like, ultimately, that proof of the main theorem relies on proving some weak form of this conjecture.
00:41:14.032 - 00:41:14.280, Speaker B: So.
00:41:14.312 - 00:41:59.660, Speaker A: So we showed it in low rank, essentially, this is true if n is positive. So I'll come back to that. Okay, so I have 15 minutes left, which is enough to say something about where the proof comes from. But before I do that, maybe I should pause for questions. Daniel, can you tell me again, when you said under a semi simplicity hypothesis in that graph that you had, you extend, it's the lower one that you extend. This is just a conjecture. So the conjecture is that if you have a finite orbit which corresponds to a semi simple representation, then you can really improve this bound a lot.
00:41:59.660 - 00:42:40.476, Speaker A: To what? Something exponential in the genus, I guess. But that's just a conjecture. So without that, this bound cannot really be improved very much. So what I know is that in the regime where, like, r is two g, I think actually r equals 2g plus one. So along this line, there exists finite orbits with infinite image. So this theorem, maybe you can improve it a little bit, but not beyond linear. So the conjecture is that maybe if you put out things which come from geometry, are always semi symbol.
00:42:40.476 - 00:42:53.584, Speaker A: So if you put on that condition, my guess is that you can really improve this. But it's just like I've looked at examples, and all the examples of families and increasing g seem to grow exponentially in the rank. But that's the only reason I believe this.
00:42:57.704 - 00:42:58.520, Speaker B: Great.
00:42:58.712 - 00:43:37.764, Speaker A: So let me say something about the proof. Well, maybe I should say, are there any other questions before I do that? So, I told you the proof would kind of come from some rigidity. I want to say a little bit about the strategy and remind you what the theorem is. And then I'll say where that comes from. So here's the theorem. So it says that if the genus of our curve is big compared to the rank, um, then, then, um, then, then the representation, any representation with finite orbit under the mapping class group has finite image. Uh, so maybe, let me remark, it's actually, I think, kind of interesting that n doesn't show up in the, in the theorem.
00:43:37.764 - 00:44:31.924, Speaker A: So, so the bound is independent of n. My guess is that if you increase n and assume that the, the monitor meet the punctures is non trivial, probably the bound should improve and we have some partial work in that direction, which maybe I'll talk about at the end if I have time. Okay, so how are we going to prove this? Um, so, so there's, uh, the, the main, the main content is that we can understand this sort of linear algebra question of finite orbits in a geometric way. And for simplicity, I'm just going to assume that rho is irreducible there, there's not really a lot of new ideas handling the non irreducible case, but, um, there's a few. Um, so what does it mean that this finite orbit, that this orbit here is finite? It means that we're in some geometric situation. So what it means is that you can find a family of curves over some base which dominates the module I space, and a local system on the total space of that family. So that when you restrict your fiber, it has monitor me given by the representation you started with.
00:44:31.924 - 00:45:09.054, Speaker A: In other words, before I told you that if you have a local system on the universal curve, it gives you a finite orbit. And this is kind of a partial converse to that. It says that if you have a finite orbit, you can actually make it into a local system, maybe not on the universal curve, but on some family of curves which, and that family contains kind of the generic curve. Okay, so this is kind of the key algebra geometric starting point. And this lets us, you know, lets us apply the tools of algebraic geometry to this question. This is not a very hard, this statement is not very hard. It's sort of unwinding, unwinding definitions.
00:45:09.054 - 00:45:46.884, Speaker A: Okay, so we're in this geometric situation now. We have a finite orbit, and we use that to create a local system on the family of curves. So we want to do two things. So how are we going to show a representation has finite image? First of all, we want to show this local system is actually defined not over the complex numbers, but over the ring of integers of a number field. Okay, so there's some arithmetic coming in, and we'll have to use some arithmetic input to get this. And then the second thing we need is that for all embeddings of that number field into the complex numbers, the associated complex representation is unitary.
00:45:48.904 - 00:45:49.800, Speaker B: Okay, sorry.
00:45:49.912 - 00:46:13.904, Speaker A: These two things together are going to imply finite image. Well, why is that? It's because the unitary group is compact. So here, okay, is discrete and the unitary group is compact. So if you have, what this tells us is that the image of the representation is, is a discrete compact set, and such a set is always finite.
00:46:16.204 - 00:46:16.668, Speaker B: Okay?
00:46:16.716 - 00:46:53.804, Speaker A: So we're going to prove finiteness by proving these two things. So this is a arithmetic input, and this is actually kind of complex analytic input. So if you'd like, you can think of this as saying that v is bounded in the p adx topology for all p. And this is saying it's bounded in the Archimedean topology for all real embeddings. So yeah, that's kind of where this comes from. Okay, so how are we going to prove this? So we're in this geometric setting we want to prove we're defined over a ring of integers of a number field, and we're unitary. And I'm going to start actually just by assuming that my original representation is unitary, and then we'll reduce to this case.
00:46:53.804 - 00:47:32.904, Speaker A: Okay, so then, okay, here, this part is hard. One does some period map computation. So in the unitary setting, one has access to Hodge theory. And Hodge theory lets us compute things like the commology of unitary local systems in an infinitesimal way. And what that computation tells us in this case is that this local system v, is homologically rigid. What that means is that if you look at it as a point of the variety of representations of PI, one of c, it's a reduced isolated point. So it's not just an isolated point like we saw when I talked about Katz's rigid local system, it actually is reduced.
00:47:32.904 - 00:48:09.278, Speaker A: What this tells us by work of Enel Groening, which, which ultimately relies on Leforg's work on the Lengland's program over function fields, is that v is defined over OK, so this is the main arithmetic input. So already if you have a comologically rigid local system on any smooth quasi projected variety with some, well, with some extra condition that we also verify, but I won't say anything about. So quasi unipotent monitor media infinity, then it's automatically defined over the ring of integers of an upper field. So this is some really beautiful work of no and grown aids. So we know it's defined over K. Now we just need unitarity. Well, we already have unitary.
00:48:09.278 - 00:48:42.162, Speaker A: That row is unitary, but that actually isn't enough. So what we actually need that is that row is unitary for all embeddings of OK into c. And this just gives us unitarity for the embedding we started with. So we need to handle those other embeddings. But what do we know? We know that this local system is rigid, and that's an algebraic property. So what that means is that for all embeddings of OK and to C, the associated local system, complex local system is still rigid, and then non abelian hodge theory. So work of Simpson and Machozuki tells us that rigid local systems underlie complex variations of Hodge structure.
00:48:42.162 - 00:48:48.054, Speaker A: So whatever that is, it's some generalization of being unitary that allows us to apply hodge theory to study it.
00:48:50.154 - 00:48:50.714, Speaker B: Okay?
00:48:50.794 - 00:49:26.274, Speaker A: And these CVHs have a very special property, and I'm not going to explain this. So this is just for the experts in the audience, a CVHS comes with a vector bundle on a curve. And if that vector bundle is semi stable, the CVHS is guaranteed to be unitary. And so what we show is that if you pick a point down here, you can perturb it a little bit to arrange that the associated vector bundle is actually semi stable. And this implies that the local system is unitary. So these are the hard parts, which I won't say anything about. I have some slides at the end I can use to show you more details if you have questions.
00:49:26.274 - 00:49:35.724, Speaker A: But, but let me just move on for now. Um, so, so, okay, so in this case, where we start with something unitary, we win. So integral, and unitary implies finite image.
00:49:35.884 - 00:49:36.156, Speaker B: So.
00:49:36.180 - 00:50:05.594, Speaker A: So I want to explain how to drop this assumption now, but. Or how to reduce to it. But before, let me just remark. So, so this, this question about perturbing m, to make this vector bundle semi stable was actually a question of Biswas he and her to be. And there's some interesting history. So, so there are claims in literature that for any flat vector bundle on any curve, you can always perturb, let's say, with irreducible monitoring, you can always perturb the complex structure to make the bundle semi stable. And we found a counter example to that statement.
00:50:05.594 - 00:50:27.284, Speaker A: So it's just false. So this was claimed in maybe four or five papers, which we were searching through last year to try to understand how they can be true, after we found the counter example. So, actually, proving this, it really requires some extra work. It's something that we had to correct some, some mistakes in literature to prove it.
00:50:27.364 - 00:50:27.556, Speaker B: So.
00:50:27.580 - 00:51:16.794, Speaker A: So, uh, it was, there was this question of Biswas Ho and herd of east that they, they claimed the answer, that it was claimed the answer was always yes. And it's, it's not, but it turns out in our situation, it is. Okay, so, okay, so now, um, let's, let's drop, I want to explain how to drop this assumption that Rho is unitary. So now we just have some semi simple local system, let's say V on a family of curves. I don't want to assume it's unitary, and I want to explain why it necessarily has finite monotremy when you restrict to a fiber. So why these finite orbits? Why these finite orbits correspond to things with finite monotreme, just in the semi simple case? Okay, well, whatever this phi is non abelian Hodge theory. So again, this theory of Simpson and Machizuki tells us we can deform it to a complex variation of hot structure.
00:51:16.794 - 00:51:49.294, Speaker A: So that's a situation where we can use the techniques of algebraic geometry to study it. We can use Hobbes theory. Again, we can move our curve to make this semi stable, which means that this v prime, this thing we deform to, is unitary. So this v prime looks like the previous situation we were in. Again, a period map computation implies that this v prime has some rigidity. Okay, now what has happened? We've deformed something V to a rigid thing. So how is that possible? It means they have to be the same.
00:51:49.294 - 00:52:17.938, Speaker A: Okay, so what this actually tells us is that this v is equal to the v prime that we deform to. So what does it tell us? It tells us this row is actually unitary. So we're back in the situation from the last slide. And again, there's two pieces of kind of new content here that aren't just applying, like, fancy technology that other people developed. There's this perturbation to make a vector bundle semi stable, and this period map computation. And both of those are pretty involved. And maybe I'll just say a word.
00:52:17.938 - 00:52:51.124, Speaker A: So, I explained how to handle the case when Rho is semi simple. The non semi simple cases is related to a kind of well known open conjecture and topology, it turns out. So I told you earlier about those cadyroparsian families, and it turns out that the non semi simple cases is related to understanding the monodromy of those Kadira partian representations. There's a conjecture that in general, they have big image in some sense, and we don't know how to prove that conjecture. That's like a major open question in low dimensional topology. But these hodge theoretic techniques tell us it's true in large g. So we kind of have.
00:52:51.124 - 00:53:21.054, Speaker A: We found a kind of asymptotic version of this conjecture is true, and that's enough to prove it's data. All right, so I'm just about done here. Let me just summarize the proof and leave you with a question. So how did it work? Well, we had this kind of elementary linear algebra question about a group action on n tuples of matrices. We translated it into a question about local systems on modulized spaces. So lets us use the tools of algebraic geometry. We found some kind of hidden rigidity in the situation.
00:53:21.054 - 00:53:57.904, Speaker A: So those local systems turned out to be rigid, and that let us use rigidity to get an integral variation of hot structures so integral. And then we got ourselves into this complex variation of hot structure situation and used that altogether to prove unitarity and hence finance. Okay, are there any questions about the proof before I leave you with some questions? Sorry, Daniel. Which part of the proof needs the lower bound on the genus? That's a good question. So it's all these highlighted parts. So the period map computation and this perturbation.
00:53:58.444 - 00:53:59.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:59.172 - 00:54:13.484, Speaker A: So somehow the fact I alluded to this sort of previous claim. So this was always true. So it's not always true, but it's always true in low rank. So that's what we show. And then this period map computation, it comes up in another way.
00:54:14.344 - 00:54:16.752, Speaker B: Thanks, Kumar.
00:54:16.808 - 00:54:17.804, Speaker A: Did you have a question?
00:54:18.304 - 00:54:19.044, Speaker B: No.
00:54:19.744 - 00:54:45.700, Speaker A: All right, let me just leave you with a couple questions. Okay. So, kind of, for me, there's kind of this motivating question which I alluded to earlier. So if you have an algebraic variety, you can ask which local systems on it are of geometric origin. So, meaning show up in the comology of a family of varieties over it. And this is what motivated these original conjectures of Enoch and Buter and Wang. They were essentially conjecturing that there are a lot of local systems of geometric origin.
00:54:45.700 - 00:55:05.336, Speaker A: And this result proves that's actually not true. Daniel, just one quick question about this term, geometric origin. So here it's supposed to be smooth and proper, especially proper. That's right. Yeah. So the actual definition is you have x to s and then a u and s. Wait, maybe I have it on the slide.
00:55:05.336 - 00:55:33.540, Speaker A: Sorry. Oh, no, I don't have it on the slide. You have a uns and then you have a local system, v on s, and you want v restricted to u to appear as a sub quotient of ri I, star of x. So smoothness is not a real condition because you're always allowed to shrink. Properness is. It's sort of a real condition, but not really because you only really study this for semi simple local systems. And so you can always kind of find them inside of proper things.
00:55:33.540 - 00:55:44.908, Speaker A: So if my. If the fibers are not projective, would it still. It's basically the same thing. I mean, you take an irreducible sub and then you can do some compactification and still find it.
00:55:45.036 - 00:55:45.316, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:45.340 - 00:55:51.920, Speaker A: So it's not. Yeah, it's. I said smooth and proper, but that's just to guarantee that these push forwards are actually local systems.
00:55:51.972 - 00:55:52.160, Speaker B: It's.
00:55:52.192 - 00:55:59.128, Speaker A: You can. You can. If you have any local system which comes from geometry in an interesting way, you can always find it in one of these families.
00:55:59.296 - 00:55:59.832, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:55:59.888 - 00:56:26.476, Speaker A: But, yeah, it's a good question. Okay, so this question, I think, is really interesting. So it's like some kind of non abelian analog of the hot rotate conjecture or something. The arithmetic version is the font and maser conjecture, but it's way too hard. And the reason why is that, like, it really depends on the complex structure. So if you take a curve, for example, and you take a local system on it, you can perturb the complex structure. So even if your original local system was geometric, of geometric origin, that the perturbation typically won't be so.
00:56:26.476 - 00:56:55.206, Speaker A: So to have a hope of answering this, you need a kind of a topological variant. And so that's what this question is. So it's the question of which local systems on the surface are of geometric origin for all complex structures on this space. And it's sort of, sort of. So this is sort of the most naive way of getting a question that only relies on topology. You just want it to be true for all complex structures. And it's a little exercise that such local systems necessarily have finite orbit under this mapping class loop.
00:56:55.206 - 00:57:42.948, Speaker A: So this finite orbit question is kind of an approximation to this, to this really hard classification problem. Okay, but I made the super rigidity conjecture, and the conjecture implies that, sorry, there should be the word irreducible here. If you believe this conjecture, it's basically the same, at least if you believe some other standard conjectures, is the statement that these finite orbits are exactly the representations of geometric origin when g is big. So I think, in my view, this is like, there's a classification question here you could ask, just classify all finite orbits. So it would be like the biggest possible generalization of this classification of algebraic solutions to penal base six. I think writing down a list is probably impossible. But this structural fact, do they all come from algebraic geometry? At least if the genus is big is a plausible classification.
00:57:42.948 - 00:57:44.884, Speaker A: And maybe I'll leave you with that.
