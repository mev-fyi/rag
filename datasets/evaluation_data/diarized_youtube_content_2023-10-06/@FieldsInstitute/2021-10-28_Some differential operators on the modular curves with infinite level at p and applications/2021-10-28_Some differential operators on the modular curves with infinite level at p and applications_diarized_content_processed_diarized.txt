00:00:01.120 - 00:00:12.554, Speaker A: So, for the second talk today, we have Luipang from Princeton who will talk about some differential operators on the modular curve with infinite level at p and applications.
00:00:13.774 - 00:00:58.324, Speaker B: Okay, so many thanks for the invitation. It's a great honor to speak here. I remember the, the first time I had a chance to talk with Peter Schulze in 2017 Arizona winter school. And at that time I asked him some questions about his function, local London correspondence. I asked something about the wrong representations and he suggested first to look at hot state representations. To be honest, I wasn't very convinced at that time. But now I think Peter is correct.
00:00:58.324 - 00:02:04.504, Speaker B: And I hope this will also be clear for the audience after this talk. Yeah, so I want to talk about some, I want to talk about, to be sure, just construct some intertwining operators. So, let me first give an application of this. So. So first let's consider the, the completed chronology. So, fix KP, which is an open compact subgroup of GL two finite del away from p. Then if we have an open subgroup, open compact subgroup of gl two qp, we can look at the module curve pk.
00:02:04.504 - 00:03:06.088, Speaker B: This is a Delhi modular curve with level over p k over p. So it's defined over q. I can base change to q bar and take its atarcomology. Take the torsion coefficient. Now, if I vary the level at p, so just take the direct limit over o compact open subgroup of gl two qp and take the inverse limit over n. Then this is was introduced by amateur called the completed chromology, denoted by h theta I k over p zp here. So it looks slightly quite complicated, but in this case it has the simpler definition.
00:03:06.088 - 00:04:12.174, Speaker B: It's just you take the direct limits over of the zp coefficient for finite level module curve and you take the pid completion of this direct limit and you get the same thing here. Okay, so because there's no level at p n, it has a natural action of gl two qp. Um, also because, uh, uh, all the module curves are defined over q. So you also have a gala action. So Qq denotes the absolute gala group of q. So for simplicity, let me use HQTA to denote the first completed chronology tensor with Qp. So this is a periodic banana space.
00:04:12.174 - 00:05:01.774, Speaker B: So you can ask, because it has an action of a Gq, you can ask what galore representations appear in this h two. So this is infinite dimensional space. It's very large. So serum. So suppose we start with a two dimensional galore representation. So, for simplicity, let me just assume the field of coefficient is qp, but in general, we can allow a finite extension. So let's suppose appears in.
00:05:01.774 - 00:05:56.080, Speaker B: Sorry, I forgot to say, let's say continues and irreducible or absolutely irreducible. So suppose it appears in h two ta. Concretely it means that if you look at home rho to h theta, this is non zero. And we assume that p, uh, it's the rom of regular hot state weight. So it's the wrong, uh, of hot state weights, um, zero and k, where k is a positive integer. In particular, it's regular. Um, then.
00:05:56.080 - 00:06:50.604, Speaker B: So from the major conjecture predicted that such granular representation comes from modular form. And this is uh, the, so the statement, the claim here. So then rho arises from an eigen form of weight k plus one. Okay, so this is really a special case of fundamental conjecture. So this result is not new in this case, but we give a sort of a new proof here. So make some remark, remark. I guess in this special case, at least generic, in a generic case, this was known by Emmerton.
00:06:50.604 - 00:08:43.844, Speaker B: And in his proof he used his local global compatibility plus people's work on periodic local lens for gl two qp. So local lungs correspondence for gl two qp. And also this, I should say this result is one main step in Amorton's proof of fundamental conjecture, at least in the generic case. So, I want to remark here that our proof does not use p adic local analance correspondence we do not use. And so basically you will see that the, the main ingredient is very geometric. So it's possible. So I haven't checked all the details yet, but I think it is possible that you can really replace module curve over some totally real f with no restrictions at p.
00:08:43.844 - 00:09:16.528, Speaker B: So here, when I say restriction, I mean either we don't have any restriction for p in f, so we don't need it to be completely split. It can be ramified or unremifiled. Um, well we have no requirement on that. And also, um. I think it's possible that, um. Um. You don't have, uh, you don't have any restriction for the cortania algebra at p.
00:09:16.528 - 00:09:58.682, Speaker B: So, um. So in fact we also can say something for, um, for this home space. So more, uh, we can something for, for this, let me denote by ht row. So the row is OTP part. Uh, we can prove something. So uh, the full statement is a little bit long. So, for templates, for simplicity, let me just state one result here.
00:09:58.682 - 00:10:45.894, Speaker B: Is that. So it has an action of Gl two qp. So it's a banner representation. So you can take the locally analytic vectors inside. But if you want, so if you fix an open complex subgroup kp, you can just look at the KP analytic vectors inside. Okay? And also now, because they are analytic vectors, so the algebra act on them so that you can consider n, which is this new potent subalgebra inside Gl two Qp. And you can look at the any invariance here.
00:10:45.894 - 00:12:26.226, Speaker B: And what we can show is that, um, this is a finite dimensional vector space. Okay? So we can show some proof, some finiteness result for this. So tp part, okay? So in the rest of this talk, I want to just talk about one main ingredient in the proof of this theorem. That's the intertwining operator in the title, sorry, in title here. So to do this, so let me first recall what is the hot state representation and the ram representation, so, and the Rom representations. So let's say we have a two dimensional galore representation of GQp. So it acts on v, which is the two dimensional vector space over some e is a finite extension of qp, okay? And we say v is hot state of weight zero k, where k, again, we assume it's a positive integer.
00:12:26.226 - 00:13:48.894, Speaker B: So that this is in a regular case, if the v tensor with Cp, let me call it w, has a hard state decomposition, has a decomposition w zero plus wk, where this w zero is the host state weight zero part, and this is hot state weight k par. So here I forgot to say that cps, you should denote the PiD completion of the QP bar algebra closure of Qp. So by hosted zero part, I really mean that, as usual, is just, if you take the GQP invariance and you tensor with Cp, you just get back w zero. So it's just generated by the GQP invariance. So I forgot to say here I really need to require that both are non zero and the HBK part. So here I, the convention I use is that if you twist by case power of the cyclo atomic character, then it has hot state weight zero. This is host state of weight zero.
00:13:48.894 - 00:15:23.084, Speaker B: Okay. Um, so this is, uh, uh, so for hodges representation, it simply means that you have this decomposition. Uh, now we say v is the Rom of h zero k. If so, first, v is hot state of weights zero and k. And secondly, so usually people use the definition that if you take, if you tensor with the beta on period ring introduced by Fontaine, and you take the GQP invariance, then the dimension is equal to the dimension of v, which is just two in this case, but I must say so, this is not quite useful for our purpose. So in fandant's classification of almost the Ram representations, he gives another characterization, uh, of weaving the ROM. So, so it construct a natural operator.
00:15:23.084 - 00:16:19.054, Speaker B: And let me call you Nw, from the hotshot with zero part to the hotshift with k part. Of course, if they have different ways, you don't expect that there's such a natural operator. So here you need to twist by case sector atomic character so that both are hosted with zero. And so as the notation suggests that you should really think this is some kind of monodromial creature. And in this talk I simply call it Fontaine operator here. And Fontaine also shows that the v is the ROM. So two here is equivalent with nw zero, so that there is no monitoring mean.
00:16:19.054 - 00:17:50.474, Speaker B: Okay, so we will use this point of view. So now let's try to apply this to completed chromology. So apply to h two. So what we are going to do is that, so, first we have the h two, the first completed chronology we will define, we will cut out the subspace, let me denote it by h theta, how state is zero k. So you should think this is a subspace which consists of host state representation representations which are host state always zero and k. So more precisely, if you have the property that if rho appears in ht and rho is hot state of weights zero and k, and you want these two conditions will imply that the row actually appears in this h two to hot state zero. Okay? And then we would like to cut out an even smaller subspace which contains the representations of weight zero and k.
00:17:50.474 - 00:19:04.500, Speaker B: Uh, so here I put a quotation mark here, because they actually, it will not be a subspace, uh, but it will be a subspace after we extend the, the coefficient to cp. So now how to construct these two spaces. So first, for this hall states, uh, one. So the idea is that, so because you have an action of gl two qp, you can consider the locally analytic vectors inside locally analytic vectors. And now the li ultra x on it. So let me use, so the li algebra of gl two qp, but it's just gl two qp. And let me denote it by g here.
00:19:04.500 - 00:20:22.434, Speaker B: So in particular, you can consider the, the action of the center of the universal amulet algebra of G. So let me use z to denote the center of u g. And now let me take an infinitesimal character k to be the infinitesimal character of k minus one symmetric power of the Du of the standard representation of Jl. Two qp. So just, just take the infinitesimal character of a very specific algebraic representation. Now we can simply define this hosit. The zero k part used to be the chi theta ksotp part, and the reason that it satisfies the property I mentioned before is that there is a relation between hate weight and the infinitesimal characters.
00:20:22.434 - 00:21:33.354, Speaker B: I first learned this result from a talk of Dosby Nesco. So I think in his joint word with. Okay, so the hot seat zero k parity is just, you just need to fix an infinitesimal character. Now, how to construct the Durand zero k subspace. So the first observation is that actually this is, there's a natural host state decomposition of this space if you take the completely tensor product with CP. So here, this is some LB space. So it's completely tensor product should be understood in some, in that sense, let me call it w.
00:21:33.354 - 00:23:03.054, Speaker B: And there's a host state decomposition. This has hot state with zero, and this has hodged it with k, which is universal in the sense that you can imagine that if you have a galore representation, Joe, inside, then, well, suppose, I mean, it has Hodge degree zero and k, so you have a hostility decomposition of rho. So rho tensor cp h with zero is inside this w zero, and rho tensor k part is inside the wk. So some kind of universal hard state decomposition. And if you believe that the construction of then also can work in this infinite dimensional situation. So you can imagine that there is also universal fontaine operator in this sense, in this case. So let me denote by hk two from this hot shape with zero part to case twist of Hodgesk part.
00:23:03.054 - 00:23:49.982, Speaker B: Um, and, uh, my foundance result, the, uh, for duram rep representation is the arm if and only if the mono dom is zero. So it's reasonable to call this, uh, the kernel of n two k to be over the rom zero k subspace. Okay, so now it remains. So we really cut out a subspace that contains this theorem representations. And now it's just to just study this subspace. Now the problem is how to study this. I mean, this anti the case defined in some very abstract way.
00:23:49.982 - 00:25:02.526, Speaker B: I even didn't tell you how Fontaine constructed this subreader, even in the two dimensional galore representation case. So the answer is, we will give another construction of this n t k. Okay, so, in a remaining time of this talk, I plan to explain how to construct this operator geometrically. So, to do this, I really need to use the infinite level module curve. Perfecto. A module curve. Um, so first, some notation.
00:25:02.526 - 00:26:10.896, Speaker B: So, uh, for module curve yk. Uh, so it has a natural compactification x k. And we use curly x k to denote the attic space associated to the base change of xk to cp. Then, then Peter Schulz. So if you fix the level at p and, sorry, level away from p and vary the level away from p, then the inverse limit exists as some very nice geometric object. So let me think. Use, denote this by curly x x k, upper p.
00:26:10.896 - 00:27:06.674, Speaker B: So this is a perfectoid space. And moreover, it equips with, sorry, I forgot to say so. Okay. It also equips with a so called hosted period map to the flag variety of gl chooser. In this case, fl is simply p one. And because this, there's no level at p now, so there's an action of gl two qp. And this hodge date period map is gl two qp equivalent.
00:27:06.674 - 00:28:11.464, Speaker B: And of course we have a projection onto the finite level modular curve k over p k. So let me use PI k over p to denote this projection. Uh, so that, um, we have a total logical ample line bundle on p one. Uh, let me use zero one here, sir, such that higher hot state, if you pull back this tautological ample line bundle, sorry, this one does not mean take twist here. Uh, it's naturally, uh, isomorphic to, um, the pullback of the automorphic line bundle omega to the infinite level. Okay, so this is sort of a p edict picture. So if you're not familiar with the piety picture, but you are very familiar with complex picture.
00:28:11.464 - 00:29:26.144, Speaker B: So what is it? Um, so the analog of this infinite level or module curve, firstly, some kind of covering of module curve. So in the complex cases, some you can, you should regard it as, you regard this as some universal covering of module curve, which is just upper half plane. And the reason that we regard as a subspace of p one is because we already used the Borel embedding. And, but of course you can, you also use an anti holomorphic embedding. So just, you can embed into p one, but use the maps to z bar. So this is the anti holomorphic Borel embedding. And of course you have a projection onto just quotient by some level gamma.
00:29:26.144 - 00:30:21.268, Speaker B: So this picture should be considered as a periodic analog of this picture here. And if you are not, if you don't like anti holomorphic stuff, I mean, if you prefer to stay in the world of algebraic geometry or holomorphic world, so there's a, I found another analog. Quite useful. Is that. So? If you remember, so h is really sl two arm mod, so two, and so two r. So you can also consider this picture. So sl two c mod, so two c, sorry, the notation may not be work.
00:30:21.268 - 00:31:28.994, Speaker B: And then, because, so this, you should think some card on subgroup and you can find two burrell subgroups containing it. And one, you just get the Burrell embedding. And if you use the other one, you just get the anti holomorphic Burrell embedding. So this picture, well, now you're in the world of algebra geometry. I found, I mean, quite useful to think about this picture. So let me go back to the, sorry, sorry, let me go back to this hodget period map. SosA also proved that you can read, you can recover the completed chromology from this picture as long as you extend your coefficients to cp.
00:31:28.994 - 00:32:45.916, Speaker B: So also prove that. So if you let, ok, upper P be the push forward of the structure sheet for the infinite level module curve. So this is a sheath on the flag variety. Then there's a natural isomorphism between the khormology of the sheath with the cp coefficient, completed chromology, hi theta qpzp. And you take the completed tensor product with cp. So in particular, so for h one, you just get h two completed tensor product with cp. Here, if you remember, so in the definition of a hot state, the zero k part, the first thing we do is to take the locally analytic vectors.
00:32:45.916 - 00:34:00.144, Speaker B: So we also need to do this here. So recall that PI Holt data is gl two qp equivalent. So in particular, this is the gl two qp equivalent sheath from p one. So we can take the subshif which contains gl two qp locally analytic sections. And then, this is a serum, I proved last year that then the isomorphism here naturally induce an isomorphism between the chromology of this subsheaf. And when you pass to the locally analytic vectors in the completed chronology. Okay, so now whatever operations we want to do here, we can try, we already sort of write it as a sheath commodity, so we can try to do it on the sheath level.
00:34:00.144 - 00:35:30.644, Speaker B: So, so now we're going to do some operations to apply some operators to this sheath. So the first observation is that actually this sheath, it satisfies some first order differential differential equation. So, because all the sections are two QP are locally analytic vectors, so you have an action of the Li algebra, let me call it g, here, on the other hand, so the structure sheet of the, of the flag varieties, the subsheaf on it. So recall this, this is a sheath on on the flag variety. So in particular, so the tensor product acts on this sheath. So let me call this g zero, this tensor product. This is a trivial vector bundle on the flag variety, but it has some non trivial sub vector bundle.
00:35:30.644 - 00:36:59.734, Speaker B: Recall that flag variety parameterizes Borrell subalgebra in GL two. In particular, for each classical point, you have a corresponding borel subaltra, denoted by bx inside gl two Cp and the corresponding neopotent sub ultra, which is denoted by nx. Then you can consider the horizontal Borrell subaltra, which is just f inside g naught, so that, such that fx at each, each fiber is inside bx. And similarly, you can define the horizontal new potence of algebra. So f in g naught, such that f x inside nx at each point. So this n naught is a line bundle, uh, on the flat variety. And, and it turns out that this n zero annihilates, um, this sheath.
00:36:59.734 - 00:38:09.116, Speaker B: Um, so another way to say this is that this is a line bundle. So you should think those shifts satisfy first order of differential equation. Okay? So if you're familiar with the theory of localization discovered by Benjamins and Bernstein, uh, you shouldn't recognize. Now you, this basically implies that differential operators on the flag variety, uh, um, act on the sheath. Um, let me say one corollary here is that the action of b naught on the shift now factors through the quotient. So it acts on the sheath. But what is this quotient? So at each point, the barrella subalge, sorry, it's a barrel subalgebra quotient by its neopotent part.
00:38:09.116 - 00:39:02.974, Speaker B: So essentially you can identify it with the Cardan subalgebra. So it turns out that this quotient as a vector bundle is just trivial on the flag variety. So if I fix subalgebra. So just take the usual diagonal one inside this spirale, upper triangular paralysis of algebra. Then you can identify this quotient with age tensor with ofl. So in particular, you get the embedding from h to this sheath. So you get an action of h on this OLkP.
00:39:02.974 - 00:40:16.664, Speaker B: So you get an action, let me call it Zeta H, of this action. This is, so you get an action of a cardinal subaltern by acting on the shift. It's not just induced from the, I mean the group action. So what is this action? Sorry, what is this action? So actually from, you have two point of view of this action from the representation theoretic point of view, it essentially gives you the information of the infinitesimal character or the, sorry, it's closely related to the action of z, if you remember. So z is the center of the universal enveloping algebra. Sure. So I mean, this basically essentially follows from the Harris Chandel isomorphism.
00:40:16.664 - 00:41:25.934, Speaker B: And so in some sense that is closely related to the infinitesimal character of gl two. On the, on the other hand, this section is also closely related to the infinitesimal character of GQP. So what is the infinitesimal character of GQP is, it's just a sn operator. So it's obstinate operator, which you can regard as an element inside the center of the li algebra of gqeba tensor with Cp. Okay, I don't want to be too precise here, but it's closely related to the snap operator here. So in some sense it tells you the p ad couch structure on the sheath. So let me give you one example here.
00:41:25.934 - 00:43:27.730, Speaker B: Um. Um, so if you take the character, so if you take this character chi, so this weight, uh, sorry, I say n one, n two, both are integers which sends ad to a n one plus d and two. And you can look at the chi isotopic part. Um, it turns out that if you look at the action of the, of the, of the, the center of the universal enveloping algebra, so it has infinitesimal, infinitesimal character. Um, so by hell, I can just identify with an orbit of weight under the dot action of, well, group. It's given by n two, n one, n one minus one, n two plus one. On the other hand, if you are interested in the hot state structure, then it turns out that this is a hot state of weight minus n two here.
00:43:27.730 - 00:44:47.844, Speaker B: I really mean that if you take a quasi compact open subset of flag variety and you look at sections on that open subset, and then it has a hot state structure. Okay, so, um, so now let me come back to, um. Uh, let me come back to this. Uh, so if you remember, so we have this la chi delta k, if you remember, this is our hodgep zero k subspace. And if you remember, I claim that if you take the completed tensor product with Cp, I remember, I call it w, and then it has a hard state decomposition, w zero and wk. Now in fact, these w zero and wk are naturally given by the chronology of sheath of sheaves of this form. So, serum.
00:44:47.844 - 00:45:51.334, Speaker B: Let me assume k is at least two here because one k is equal to one. Then you will see some contribution from some of the h zero for the completed komodji. I mean, it's not too hard to control that, but I really recommend you to ignore this and just allow k to be one here. But I just want to make sure that whatever I'm going to write down is completely correct. So one k is at least two. Then it turns out that w zero is naturally isomorphic to the first chromology of Ola kp. And you take the one minus k zero sotp part and wk is just given by ola.
00:45:51.334 - 00:46:39.204, Speaker B: You take the one minus k sotp part. So recall that w zero is hot state with zero part. So this zero, by our discussion here already implied this has hosted with zero. So this has the correct hosted weight. So now if you remember that we want to construct a an operator from w zero to wk. So recall that n two to k is an operator from w zero to wk. Case take twist of wk.
00:46:39.204 - 00:47:55.654, Speaker B: Natural to guess that this operator actually comes from an operator on the sheath level. So we're going to construct nk, which is from one minus k zero isotopic part to this one minus k part and twist by case, twist by case, power offset cyclo atomic character. Okay, this is what we are going to do. I mean, it's clear that you basically want some operator from one way to another way. That's why I call it intertwining operator. Final section intertwining operator. So how to construct this operator? So let me go back to this picture.
00:47:55.654 - 00:49:01.054, Speaker B: So the infinite level module curve, we have one projection onto finite level module curve PI kp and hp remap to the fly variety, which is just p one. Okay, the idea is somehow we can try to pull back differential operators from this finite level, this algebraic varieties. So the theorem, this is actually what we are going to do. So one k, let me first explain what's happening. One k is equal to one. So one k is equal to one. Then we essentially want an operator from the hot state with zero zero part to hot state with, sorry, not hotch step weight the weight zero zero part, two weight one minus one part.
00:49:01.054 - 00:49:43.590, Speaker B: So we start with start with weight zero zero part. Okay, now we try to use derivation here. Sure. Let me call d here tensor with omega one x. So she of differential forms on the finite level module curves. Of course I mean the derivation. I mean the derivation here.
00:49:43.590 - 00:50:43.044, Speaker B: Let me call it dx. You can only apply to functions on finite level module curve. You can't really apply to, I mean, functions here are sort of on the infinite level, but it turns out that there's so, so you want this to extend the dx and you wanted to commute with functions here. So another way to say this is ofl linear. If you put these two restrictions, then it turns out that there exists a unique d here. Turns out that this is unique. So there's a unique way to extend the derivation here to weight zero, zero part, which is ofl linear here.
00:50:43.044 - 00:51:57.294, Speaker B: So this, sorry, omega one x, of course, this is a sheath on finite level module curve, but this is a sheath on p one. So when I write this, I really mean, you first take the inverse image of this sheath to the infinite level. Then you push forward along hot state period map. So whenever I write shift like this on this side, I really mean, I do this process. Okay, so this is, so you apply, I mean, you apply derivation from the module of curves. But if you believe that this picture is actually symmetric, then you can also do this, this construction for, for this side. So in fact that there exists a so called d bar which goes to omega one fl.
00:51:57.294 - 00:53:18.154, Speaker B: So you should, it's easy to imagine that now it extends the derivation on the flag variety and moreover you want it to be sort of, it communicates with things happening on this side. So actually it's linear. And again, there exists such a, I mean there's a unique, the bar that satisfy these two conditions. Okay, so now we arrive at this, at this sheath. Now the observation is that these two actually are due to each other. So let me put a quotation mark here. So why, so there's one, one way to think about this.
00:53:18.154 - 00:54:26.394, Speaker B: Is that so? So why? So let me ignore cusps here. So if you put cusps, actually you should not put omega one x here, you should take the log differential forms. So let me ignore cusps here. Then by Cordera Spencer isomorphism, the shift of differential form on the modular form, on the modular curve, it's astromorphic, jumps to w two. So this is Chodera Spencer isomorphism. On the other hand, what is omega one? Fl, so the flat variety is p one. So p one is that the canonical bundle is negative, so it's just o minus two.
00:54:26.394 - 00:55:37.524, Speaker B: And if you remember, when I pull back, o one to the infinite level is just equal to the pullback of omega one. So, so you see some kind of duality here. But actually, if you are careful enough, so what you get is that ola one minus one k after p twist, and you have a Tate twist here. And the reason that you have a shift of weight is because the differential forms on a flag variety, actually it has weights. And if careful enough, with these isomorphism, then you will get a tape twist. And now let me call this comp, I mean, it's reasonable to call this composite just d bar composite with d. And the main, well, one main result here is that, um, that n one, the differential.
00:55:37.524 - 00:56:46.554, Speaker B: But the intertwining operator we are looking for, uh, is just equal to, um, the composites of the bar with d. And I guess it's also clear from, uh, these conditions that the d and d bar commute with each other. So it's actually also equal to d bar. Sorry, dd bar. The reason, sorry, I just realized I forgot to explain why I call it d bar. Is this because it's an analog of anti holomorphic borrell embedding. So if you call USD for, I mean, differential operators pull back from braille embedding, then I thought it might be natural to call debar for differential operators pullback from hot state period map.
00:56:46.554 - 00:58:06.516, Speaker B: And in general, so this is one k is equal to one. It's easy to imagine that n k is given by d bar to case power composite with d to k's power d two k power d bar to case power. I mean dk, I mean, the case power of d appear naturally, I mean, so very classical in the study of a module form, usually, I think called set operator, case power set operator, I mean, appear naturally in this BGG stuff. Yeah. So the conclusion is that the, sorry, I forgot to say so, and the differential, sorry, the fontaine operator is just, you apply this to the chromology group. So why is it useful? Because, I mean, the D bar and d, they are actually very concrete that you just take derivations along. I don't know each side.
00:58:06.516 - 00:59:24.854, Speaker B: So it's very, for the purpose of doing computations is sort of quite, it's very, you can really use it to compute this operator. So if you remember, we are, we are interested in the kernel of intuitive k. So now we can try to use this expression to do this computations. So I still have two minutes, so let me just give a very, just a quick sketch of a proof of the, of the main theorem. So, well, I mean serum, one sketch of proof of main serum. So the first thing is, recall that we need to understand this kernel of n two t k here. So the first result we need is that we fix some, if we take our open compact subgroup of k lower p and we look at infinite vectors.
00:59:24.854 - 01:00:38.422, Speaker B: So recall that n denotes this new potent subalgebra. And it turns out that this is dense inside the SCp analytic vectors. So this actually use some global argument. Actually, I need to use some funky duality here, so I don't want to see. All right, so, and now the second thing is, we really compute, sort of compute this infinite part using this description. So basically, it's essentially enough just to compute the end invariance here, um, using our description of Nk. And I mean, this, we will see, I mean, using this description, we will see that actually this is finite dimensional.
01:00:38.422 - 01:01:05.214, Speaker B: And the most important thing is that the hack action factors through its action on classical module forms. So we conclude that from these two facts, that hack action on this factor through its action on classical module forms, and we get the claim in our first serum. So I think I'm already out of time, so let me just stop here. Thank you.
01:01:07.354 - 01:01:18.794, Speaker A: Thank you very much for a great talk. Are there any questions?
01:01:24.014 - 01:01:32.274, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. When you say global argument, it's, it's not global in the number field sense, right. It's still over the periodic.
01:01:32.574 - 01:01:58.144, Speaker B: Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I really, I need to use that, the fun completed core module you have Pongha reduality. Yeah, this is what I need. Sure. I'm not sure. I mean, I call it global.
01:01:58.144 - 01:02:09.084, Speaker B: It's because if you just study some local analog of this. I don't know. I'm just not sure whether we have this concurred. You all are too.
01:02:09.704 - 01:02:16.280, Speaker C: And because so far, all the maps and so on, there were some are localizing on the flag variety. And so you're saying this, this argument doesn't localize on the flag varieties.
01:02:16.352 - 01:02:18.924, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly, yes. Yeah.
01:02:20.064 - 01:02:20.804, Speaker C: Great.
01:02:23.344 - 01:02:24.804, Speaker A: Any other questions?
01:02:27.144 - 01:02:31.964, Speaker D: So what prevents you from sort of going generalizing a little bit beyond rank one groups?
01:02:33.264 - 01:02:48.218, Speaker B: I don't think there's any. I just really haven't thought about this. But I do believe it should be possible in some form. I just don't know how to formulate. Formulated for. Yeah. General groups.
01:02:48.218 - 01:02:51.082, Speaker B: That's a good question. Okay, thanks.
01:02:51.218 - 01:03:11.814, Speaker D: Another kind of, maybe more technical question. So when you were discussing this duality, you're talking about this cadaver Spencer thing, I think I understood this. Yeah. This could have a responsive picture, like on the modular curve, but when you kind of take this differentials and pull it back and push it forward to flag already, are you, are you saying.
01:03:11.854 - 01:03:13.514, Speaker B: It looks the same?
01:03:14.174 - 01:03:16.154, Speaker D: How are you computing what this thing looks like?
01:03:17.694 - 01:03:20.634, Speaker B: You're asking, where does this come from?
01:03:22.094 - 01:03:28.414, Speaker D: So when you say, like, omega one is isomorphic to blah, blah, blah, but I respect isomorphism you're talking about on p one now.
01:03:28.454 - 01:03:42.716, Speaker B: Right? You mean this? Yeah, this first module curve. And. Yeah. You do this, you take the inverse image to the infinite level and you push forward. Yeah.
01:03:42.860 - 01:03:47.424, Speaker D: And how are you, how are you computing what that thing looks like after you pull it back and push it forward?
01:03:48.044 - 01:03:51.388, Speaker B: I mean, basically. Yeah.
01:03:51.396 - 01:04:04.014, Speaker C: I was actually confused by what you said there. I mean, do you really mean the tensor was a push forward of when you said omega one X should be like the push forward of the pre image, but you don't want tensor again with the push forward. Right?
01:04:06.674 - 01:04:18.574, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, this here, I mean, it's tensor product with the push forward with ox, or this ox understood as the push forward of.
01:04:19.394 - 01:04:29.884, Speaker C: Isn't some of the case that everything should be really considered as a sheath on this infinite level modular curve? And then you're tendering with line models that come from pullback from either side.
01:04:30.904 - 01:04:35.392, Speaker B: I mean, I should say this, not pullback, but you just take the pre image.
01:04:35.568 - 01:04:37.324, Speaker C: Okay. Yes.
01:04:38.184 - 01:05:05.024, Speaker B: Yeah. I forgot to say that this is better to understand in. I don't know, in this picture, I'm not sure. I mean, the, I mean, the canonical bondo here and canonical bondo, they are canonical due to each other by killing form. And this is sort of what it really says there. Sorry, does this answer your question?
01:05:06.484 - 01:05:07.860, Speaker D: I think it helps, yeah.
01:05:07.892 - 01:05:08.460, Speaker B: But I just want.
01:05:08.492 - 01:05:15.264, Speaker D: So you're not literally saying that omega one X, like when you push it forward, p one, that it still looks like this kind of line?
01:05:15.784 - 01:05:17.408, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:05:17.456 - 01:05:17.768, Speaker D: Okay.
01:05:17.816 - 01:05:18.440, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes.
01:05:18.472 - 01:05:19.160, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:05:19.312 - 01:05:22.444, Speaker B: So probably everything should be understood on the infinite level.
01:05:23.224 - 01:05:24.364, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
01:05:28.224 - 01:05:29.604, Speaker A: Any other questions?
01:05:34.584 - 01:05:43.740, Speaker C: I mean, you also had something for weight one modular forms in a different paper. So in what you said today, does this also adapt in some way to weight the weight one case?
01:05:43.892 - 01:06:03.556, Speaker B: That's an excellent question. The short answer is, I don't know. Yes, I. Yeah, I don't. I guess one reason is that it's not the weak one.
01:06:03.580 - 01:06:03.996, Speaker C: For my.
01:06:04.060 - 01:06:11.474, Speaker B: I can't really formulate as some kind of kernel. Like here is just kernel of this n two k. Uh, but for.
01:06:12.654 - 01:06:17.234, Speaker C: Okay, but before you even for the hot state part of this argument, this still works in weight one.
01:06:17.974 - 01:06:18.934, Speaker B: Which part?
01:06:19.094 - 01:06:21.914, Speaker C: The hot state part, some of this kind of argument. And it's also.
01:06:23.854 - 01:06:25.222, Speaker B: I mean, in, I.
01:06:25.238 - 01:06:27.598, Speaker C: Guess, this theorem here. This theorem here.
01:06:27.726 - 01:06:38.774, Speaker B: Yeah. Then it's not a direct product sum. Yeah. You have. It will be an extension because. Yeah, yeah. Up to this part, it hosts.
01:06:40.274 - 01:06:43.354, Speaker C: And then you get an extension of the next thing. And then. Okay, then you have to.
01:06:43.394 - 01:06:51.174, Speaker B: Yeah. Then you will see operator. And that's how I prove for with one, the classicality. Yeah.
01:06:57.074 - 01:07:14.354, Speaker A: Any other questions? Are there any differences? I guess you mentioned that you do this for the modular curve, but also for schmora curves. Are there any differences between these cases or are they essentially the same?
01:07:16.814 - 01:08:11.516, Speaker B: I just didn't check all the details, but I thought there might be. I don't think there's. So for schmuck curve, each time you fix an embedding of your field into CPU, and you just look at the behavior of that place and start, at least for the computations, there's really no essential difference. And probably the result you expect to prove is something like if it's the ram for one embedding, and then it has locally algebraic vectors for that embedding. If you look at the local analytic vectors, this is what I have in mind. And if you apply to all the embeddings, then you just prove the classic idea. So this is, I think it's possible, but I really haven't written on anything, so I haven't checked all the details.
01:08:11.516 - 01:08:14.624, Speaker B: So I don't want to claim that, but I think it's possible.
01:08:16.004 - 01:08:22.748, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. All right, well, if there are no more questions, let's thank Lua again.
01:08:22.876 - 01:08:23.324, Speaker B: Great talk.
