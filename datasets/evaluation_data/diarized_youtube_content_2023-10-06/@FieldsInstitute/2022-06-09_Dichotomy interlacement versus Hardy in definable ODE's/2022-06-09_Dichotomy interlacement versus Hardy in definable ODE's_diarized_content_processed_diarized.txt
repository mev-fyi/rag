00:00:01.080 - 00:00:18.834, Speaker A: It's a pleasure for me to introduce Olivier legal presence here to give a talk. To give a blackboard talk with the title interlacement versus hardy, indefinable, ordinary differential equations.
00:00:19.214 - 00:00:45.244, Speaker B: Thank you. So, I first want to thank the. Is it okay for the microphone? Yeah. Okay, so, yes. So I want to thank the organizer to invite me and to give me the pleasure to give my first talk in presence since the pandemic. So I hope I'm not too rusty. Okay, so, I will talk about dichotomy.
00:00:45.244 - 00:02:31.308, Speaker B: So, interlacement versus RD for definable rds. Okay, so, yes, first, it's a joint fork with Mikhail Matuszynski, Fernando Sans, and so it's a result about the relative behavior of two trajectories of definable vector field in archery. Okay, so, I don't assume everyone is familiar with this kind of thing. So I will start by kind of introduction, where I give some examples of some analytic examples, let's say, and some motivation with the recalls of what is known already. So I start with this for motivation and examples. Okay, so, all my examples are based on the Euler differential equations, well known. So I just recall you what I need.
00:02:31.308 - 00:03:21.694, Speaker B: So, euler differential. So, it's the differential equation x square y prime equals y minus x. And so in this. So it's an example of a sudden node situation. So here I want to draw the phase portrait here with x y. And so, you see, if you write it as a vector field. So the trajectories are the trajectories of the vector field c, which is dx squared dx plus y minus x dy.
00:03:21.694 - 00:04:04.114, Speaker B: So, you see, you have a zero, which is a singular point. You have linear parts, which has. So here an eigen. Yes, it has an eigenvalue zero here and an eigenvalue, well, here, eigenvalue one, I think. Yes, yes. And eigenvalue one in the direction x equal y. And so you have non stable manifold here, which is given by.
00:04:04.114 - 00:04:58.840, Speaker B: Well, it's given. It's x equals zero, and you have a formal central manifold. But you can get by trying to solve this differential equation, well, y in terms of x formally. So, if you try to do this, you get some y of x. So, you see, to go to zero here, you need y to start with an x. Okay? Then this x in Y prime gives you one. So you got x square here.
00:04:58.840 - 00:05:49.618, Speaker B: So y should get an x square. And this x square. When you calculate the derivative, you got two x, you plug it in, you get two x cubed, which comes here plus two x cubed. And you see, each time we will calculate the derivative, you will have the exponent false, and then you will end up with some factorial n x n plus one plus and so on. Okay, so this is a divergent formal series. And if you look at the dynamic along the formal, the formal central manifold, you have a dynamic which is like this. And so all trajectories do something like this, like this.
00:05:49.618 - 00:07:59.094, Speaker B: And here you have all trajectories which arrive, which go out from the origin with the same asymptotic development, which is this one. Okay, so this, what happened on the right hand side here is part of the interesting dean is an example of what cano mu xu and sans, cano sans called a pencil of trajectories. And see so formally what it is, pencil of trajectories. It's the family of all trajectories that you cannot separate by punctual blow ups, that cannot be separated by punctual. And, well, if you are not comfortable with this definition for my talk, you can just think that they all have the same expansion, and it's okay for my talk, even if it's not completely equal. So here, at least in the case, I will consider, it means having the same formal development. Okay, so what we study are the finiteness properties of such trajectories.
00:07:59.094 - 00:09:20.818, Speaker B: And you have two questions that you can have in mind is, given one trajectory of a vector field, what are its finiteness properties? The best being it is minimal, polynomial, bounded, all you want. And the second question is, what is the relative behavior between two trajectories? Here, if you take two, the question is, does they both belong, let's say, let's be generous, do they both belong to the same structure or not? So, in dimension two, actually, since trajectories of vector field have co dimension one, you can consider Puffy and leaf instead of trajectories. And then everything is either oscillating or puffing. And so there is no question in dimension two, dimension two. Here, in this example, we know that any trajectory here is they all have the best finiteness property and the best compatibility property. So let's go to dimension three. So in three reals, well, now we don't have this equality between leaves and trajectories.
00:09:20.818 - 00:10:41.054, Speaker B: And so I will just, well, make some construction with this example to give you some kind of phenomenon that can happen. So my first example is the following, so sorry, the vector field is so again, x squared dx plus, yes, y minus x dynamic plus and so I took one half of z minus x d. So, okay, if you just look at the differential equation, which come with this, it's x square, y prime, z prime equal. So you got here y minus x here one half of z minus x. So you see we have, it's almost two copies of the first one. Okay? So you have here the same equation and here the same, except you have one half here. So again, what you will get, so here I have x, y, z, and what we get, we get, again, a formal solution, which is y z.
00:10:41.054 - 00:11:43.724, Speaker B: So for y, you get the same. So it's the sum of factorial n x to the n plus one. And for z, because of this factor, you get two to the n sum of factor n, two to the n plus one x n plus one. So you have your formal curve here, okay? And if you want to understand the dynamics, so here again, you have this. So this is a formal central manifold. You have one eigenvalue on the z, which is one half here, another one on the y axis, which is one, okay? And if you want to understand how the trajectories, you can look at the difference, you see here, you can express y and z in terms of x. You can consider the difference of two solutions.
00:11:43.724 - 00:12:42.944, Speaker B: So here you have your trajectories, they are all asymptotic to the same formal curves. And if you consider, so gamma and delta, delta minus gamma. So here, gamma and delta are two solutions. If you consider the difference, you get, well, gamma minus delta satisfies the, well, you just, the linear part here, it satisfies the system x squared y prime, z prime equals y, one half of z. Okay? And so the difference delta minus gamma will be some. So you have two flat exponential, you have exponential k, exponential minus one over x. And the k prime exponential minus one, one over two x.
00:12:42.944 - 00:13:40.664, Speaker B: Okay, so you have this, this flat exponentially. Yeah. Okay. So in this case, of course, if we add the, if we ask for the finiteness properties, everything is obvious because I just have copied two dimensional system. But it could be more general, of course. And I give you another example, which is on the same ideas, but with a very different behavior. So I consider now the vector field given by e square dx plus y minus z minus x dy plus y plus z dz.
00:13:40.664 - 00:14:37.646, Speaker B: So the corresponding differential equation, it's of the same nature. So it's x squared y prime, z prime, which will be. So you have y minus z minus x for x, for y, and for z, you have y plus z. So actually the way I produce it, it's, I just consider w to be y plus I z. And if I do this, w satisfies a differential equation. E square w prime is one plus I y w minus x. So you recover almost the same differential equation here, except you have this, this complex number here.
00:14:37.646 - 00:15:42.204, Speaker B: Okay? And so you have a formal solution for w, which is the sum of the, um, so still factorial n x n plus one over one plus I was n plus one. Okay? And so if you want the asymptotic behavior of y and z, you just take the real part and imaginary part of this one. Okay? So if I make the picture formally, you have the same kind of situation as this. You have this formal central manifold here. You have x and y there, x, y and z here. In this plane, you see that you have a complex eigenvalue. So you have spirals, okay? And if you want to understand what happened for the trajectories which are asymptotic to this formal curve, again, you can consider the difference.
00:15:42.204 - 00:16:52.156, Speaker B: So, yes, if I consider again, so delta minus gamma, where delta and gamma are two solutions of this, you will end up, well with the same differential equation, except. Except this point. And then you get two flat exponential with a complex argument inside. And so this will be something like, so, sorry, e to the minus one over x. So this one is the one which is there, and times, uh, some cosine of minus one over x plus five, of minus one over x plus five. You have two, two parameters that parameterize all, all differences. And you have so this flat exponential.
00:16:52.156 - 00:17:41.153, Speaker B: And here are something that turns infinitely many times as x goes to zero. Okay, so if you want to see what happened here, you have in some, so in some way, you have a flat cone around the formal curve, if I can say, okay, and the trajectory is the spiral along this coil. Okay. Okay, so, well, the difference of any two of them, spirals. Okay, so these are for the examples. And so, in fact, what happened in the analytic situation. So this is a result of, let's say, what is known.
00:17:41.153 - 00:19:18.590, Speaker B: So it's, so it's in dimension three, we have analytic vector field. And one result is that a pencil of trajectories is either separated or intellective. And so what does this mean? So, separated is this situation mostly. And what it means, it means that you can separate any two trajectories by a projection. So here, for instance, you take two trajectories. So these two, for instance, you project it on the xy plane, and you will get two projections which have empty intersection. Okay, so this means that for all gamma delta, which are solutions, so on, there exists a projection, the submersion from r three to two reals such that p of gamma intersected with p of delta is empty, let's say near zero.
00:19:18.590 - 00:19:48.288, Speaker B: Okay, as a germ and, oh, so either it is separated or it is interlacid. And interlacid. It's exactly this situation. And what does this mean? It means that you have this interlacement of any two solutions. You get to something that looks like this. And one way to say that. So I'm changing a little bit, original definition, because, but, but it's equivalent.
00:19:48.288 - 00:20:50.568, Speaker B: So here everybody is parameterized by, by x, okay, and I consider so delta of x minus gamma of X. And I consider the angle between this difference and a fixed vector field. Fixed vector, sorry. Okay, so, so what does this mean? It means that for all gamma and delta, just solution. If so theta is theta of X is, so it's, it's a continuous angle which gives you so theta of x, sorry. So cos, such that cos theta sine theta, this is gamma minus, well, delta gamma over delta minus gamma. Okay, so theta is the angle with the horizontal vector.
00:20:50.568 - 00:22:09.794, Speaker B: So if theta is continuous and satisfies this, then theta of X goes to plus infinity as x goes to zero. Or theta of X goes to minus infinity as x goes to zero. Okay, so you have this, this dichotomy, okay, in general, for pencil of trajectories in the analytic situation. Okay, now what is known for my first question? This means what are the finite properties and thinness properties of pairs of trajectories? So we consider two k's. Again. So if the pencil, please intercede, there can be two possibilities. Again, the first one is.
00:22:09.794 - 00:23:20.106, Speaker B: So it's a very weak finiteness properties. So a trajectory, let's say for one trajectory. So gamma is oscillating. So what does this MeAN oscillating here? So it's here, since the vector field is analytic, it's all, we are talking of oscillation with respect to analytic set. So it means that there exists s an anitic surface, well, analytic set, let's say, such that gamma, well, the super of gamma intersected with s has infinity many components. So this is exactly what happens here for the difference of two trajectories. In this, in this case, okay, you have, so the solution are over there.
00:23:20.106 - 00:24:27.794, Speaker B: If you take, let's say y equals zero, you have a trajectory which intersects the horizontal plane infinitely. MEANtIMe, and in this case, the axis is an integer okay, so this means that the formal curve we had here was convergence or gamma is non oscillating. And in this case, actually gamma is ominous. So we have the best result possible then. Then gamma is. So this can be. So for many cases it is done by Roland, sorry, sorry, Roland Sandschevke.
00:24:27.794 - 00:25:14.604, Speaker B: Okay. And for the general case, it is done by legal sense, bicycle. Okay. And of course, so here I'm talking about the finiteness property of one trajectory. But of course, if you take two of them, since they are turned around each other infinitely many times, you have no hope to get anything. Okay, so here we can say the question is over for the four pair of solutions. Okay, and now comes the other part.
00:25:14.604 - 00:26:02.716, Speaker B: So if the pencil is separated now very few is known. So one thing that can be said is that any gamma is non oscillating. Okay, so that's the general finiteness result we get. We have. And, oh yes, here I want to say something. So saying that a trajectory is not oscillating. So you see, it means that for any analytic surface, the intersection has finitely many components.
00:26:02.716 - 00:26:43.454, Speaker B: So if s is given by f equals zero. Okay, it means that if you calculate f over gamma, it will have a sign, for small x will be either zero. So it means it is included in the surface or it is out. So it's either positive or negative. Okay? So any analytic function composed with gamma will have a sign. And it's not hard to see that if you consider all analytic function evaluated over gamma, you get something that is close by derivation. Because if you calculate the derivation, you will have the derivative of gamma, which appears.
00:26:43.454 - 00:27:18.538, Speaker B: But the derivative of gamma is, well, gamma satisfies the analytic differential equation. So the derivative of gamma is analytic function in terms of gamma. Okay, so if you consider all of gamma. So by this I mean all analytic function evaluated over gamma. Okay, you will get so clearly a ring that is close under derivation. And what I just said is that anyone has a sign means that if you are not zero, you have an inverse. So this is what is called Hardy thing.
00:27:18.538 - 00:28:18.506, Speaker B: Okay? So non oscillating, it is equivalent to consider this ring of function and say that this is a hard thing. Okay? And then is there anything else I wanted to say in this case? Okay, no. And now, so in this situation, actually, we don't know if gamma is any. Gamma is omnimal. So this is an open question. So there are some cases that can be, can be solved, but we have nothing general. And for the relative behavior of two trajectories, you see that in this situation, it is a situation where we have some hope that we have something.
00:28:18.506 - 00:29:13.378, Speaker B: And for gamma and delta together, of course, we don't know more. Okay. Okay. So now I think I can explain what were our actual initial motivation for our work. So the first thing we wanted to understand is this mean you take two trajectories. What kind of compatibility can you have in the separated situation? Of course, since we already don't know if one trajectory is minimal, the best result we can hope is not that they are both minimal. Okay, so what we can hope here is, you see, you have a kind of, you have an equivalent between non oscillating and being a hardy field.
00:29:13.378 - 00:29:48.566, Speaker B: And here for two trajectories, you could hope something analogous. So this means, well, do we have that? This means that if you consider all analytic functions. So here you have to well, over gamma and delta, you could ask whether this is a hardy field or not. Okay. So it's weaker than being. Okay, okay. And so that's one of things that we managed to prove.
00:29:48.566 - 00:30:37.798, Speaker B: So that's the first thing. So it's, we, we understand a bit better the separated case. And the other thing is, well, the argument here, we have the feeling that it's something a bit general. Well, this dichotomy should be more or less general. And so we want to generalize it not only for analytic vector field, but for, well, for some omnium structure at least polynomially bounded. So we need this polynomially bounded to give a meaning to the, to this flatness condition of being in the same place. Okay, so that's more or less what, what we do.
00:30:37.798 - 00:32:17.954, Speaker B: So, so let me pass to the second. So I will explain what are the main results. Okay, so the data now are so an ominous vector field which is definable in some ominous structure that is polynomially bounded. So let's say it, we fix an anonymous expansion of r, okay, that is polynomial. And so each time I said definable, I mean definable in this, this structure is fixed. And so we consider psi vector field, definable vector field. So it's c one on some open set u.
00:32:17.954 - 00:33:00.804, Speaker B: Well, I want to fix the point here. So it will be zero. And so I ask zero to be in the closure of U. And I consider trajectories of c inside of you. So of course, I suppose I have some. So I have a gamma and delta trajectories of c inside U. And I want these two trajectories to go to zero as omega limit point, let's say.
00:33:00.804 - 00:33:48.526, Speaker B: So here t is the time of the vector field. Okay. As t goes to infinity. So here comes some difficulties. Why? So what we want to do is. Well, first, yes, first we want to generalize this kind of idea. So we want to a conclusion where we say gamma and delta are either separated or interlaced, but we need to take, of course, gamma and delta in the same pencil here in a general minimal structure.
00:33:48.526 - 00:34:20.126, Speaker B: Well, we don't have a formal series point. Blowing ups are not well adapted if we have real power functions. And so we end up by saying that two trajectories are in the semper if they have a flat contact. But if you think of flat contact, flat contact comes with some coordinates. You say having flat contact means it's smaller than some x to the n for all n. But x is some given coordinate. Okay.
00:34:20.126 - 00:34:52.879, Speaker B: And actually it happens that sometimes the flat contact might depend on the coordinates system. So it's a bad thing. So this is the first thing we have to deal with. And another thing is, again, with this coordinate problem, we want this object. Well, here we will replace an atic function by a definable function. Of course, definable function evaluated on gamma and delta to be a Hardy field. So again, we need a coordinate.
00:34:52.879 - 00:35:51.142, Speaker B: So let me recall, Hardy field is a field of function of one variable. So you have one variable somewhere. So we need one given variable in order to parameterize the two trajectories and get a field of germ of one variable function. So we need this system of coordinate. And it's not completely obvious. Well, you can always take a system of a definable system of coordinate as long as gamma or delta is non oscillating. But in order to have a robust notion of what is it, to have flat contact or to even to be in the same peninsula or not, you need a bit more.
00:35:51.142 - 00:36:16.830, Speaker B: And so. Yes, okay. Let us say, I ask you to believe me, that the part where we deal with the system of coordinate is in fact harder than the rest of the result. But. So I skipped this part. Okay, I just present you everything in the reduced situation. So in the reduced situation, we have a coordinate system and everything is parameterized by one coordinate.
00:36:16.830 - 00:36:54.352, Speaker B: And we have some good, some good. We need some good condition on this coordinate with respect to one trajectory. So I will explain this. Sorry, I should start there. So I go to the reduced situation. So this means. So here we have a system of coordinates.
00:36:54.352 - 00:38:10.414, Speaker B: It's one by two of definable ordinate. And gamma and delta are both parabens by x x gamma one of x, gamma two of x. So this, I will call it gamma of x. Okay? And delta is x delta one of x. Delta two of x. So I define, I give a definition of a good property that has certain coordinates, okay? And so, and that is necessary condition to be sure that this notion of flat contact or not does not depend on the, on the choice of the chart. Okay? So I say, we say that gamma has regular separation.
00:38:10.414 - 00:39:42.964, Speaker B: If so, for all f from r three to r, it is definable. So either f composed with x, gamma of x is zero, okay? Or exists on n, the j f of x, gamma of x is larger, is larger than x to the n. So of course this two must be understood as x is close enough to zero. Okay? So either you, you vanish or you're larger than some poem. Okay? So just to give a hint of what is this, what is this definition? In the NAIT case, in the native case here, we have a formal curve. And what would happen is that this formal curve is included in an analytic surface. This could happen.
00:39:42.964 - 00:40:12.744, Speaker B: You have s, which is analytic, which contains a formal curve. And so, well, you have your pencil of trajectories. So you have all trajectories that goes to zero. We, yes. So here it's just to give a hint of what this means in the analytic situation. So this formal curve is the axis of the pencil. Okay, so here I go back to the examples if you want.
00:40:12.744 - 00:41:25.264, Speaker B: Okay, so x, okay, so here you have two kinds of trajectories. You have some trajectories which are included for true in the surface, and some which are not included in the surface. Okay, and so the one which has this regular separation properties are the one which are truly included in the surface. So this should be understood, at least in the analytic situation, as an equality between the, the formal transcendence degree and the geometrical transcendence. Okay. If you satisfy some analytic equation, you should satisfy formally, you should satisfy it for two. Okay? Okay, so this means, uh, well, yes, equality of, uh, the formal and geometrical, let's say this is the idea.
00:41:25.264 - 00:42:23.790, Speaker B: What is this object? Okay. And now I can also define. So what it is, was that content? So here it's easy because I have a good coordinate. Okay, so I say that gamma and delta have flat contact. If so, well, for all n, gamma minus delta smaller than x to the n, for x to the smaller. Okay? So it happens, as this condition ensures that the flat contact does not depend on the charts and things like this. Okay, and so now to state my theorem.
00:42:23.790 - 00:42:55.564, Speaker B: So now I have the hypothesis. So I want one trajectory to be to have regular separation and the other to have flat contact to the first one. Okay? And my conclusion should be. So for my conclusion, I should have either the interlacement or the separation. In the strong way, this means that they are cohort hardy. And so I need two more definition. So, for the interlacement, in fact, the definition is over there.
00:42:55.564 - 00:43:31.700, Speaker B: And it works. So it's. The angle theta goes to plus or minus infinity. Okay, so that's the same definition. And for. For my field here, I consider, so I call field, well, a ring of definable function over gamma delta. So this will be the set.
00:43:31.700 - 00:44:04.914, Speaker B: So I wrote it f of gamma delta. And this is a set of all function of the form, some h of x, gamma one of x. Gamma two of x delta one of x. Delta two of x. Okay. When h r five to r is definable. Okay.
00:44:04.914 - 00:45:34.934, Speaker B: Okay, so now I can say the result. So. So we let gamma delta with gamma has regular separation. Delta has flat contact with gamma. And the conclusion then is gamma and delta are interval or. Well, this, this ring f of gamma delta is a hardy field. Okay.
00:45:34.934 - 00:46:25.218, Speaker B: Yes, it stopped at 20. Okay, so what can I say in five minutes? Okay. Yes, but maybe I can. So you see, it's what I just announced before. So if you go back to the analytic situation, so you can in particular apply this, this theorem in the analytics situation. So you see that we recover, of course, this dichotomy. But we got something better for the separated situation since we got a hardy field here.
00:46:25.218 - 00:46:58.104, Speaker B: And it's way better than having one projection which separates the two. And in particular, we can prove with this that in this situation, any projection separate the two other two trajectories. So that's one thing. And the other good thing is that while we generalize the result to any polynomially bounded or minimal structure. Okay, maybe I stopped there.
00:47:07.344 - 00:47:09.064, Speaker A: Thank you very much for the talks.
00:47:09.184 - 00:47:09.488, Speaker B: Talk.
00:47:09.536 - 00:47:25.472, Speaker A: Are there any questions in the audience or online? So maybe I start with a question on my own. So, in this non oscillating case, do the dusty trajectory have a tangent at the origin?
00:47:25.648 - 00:47:35.904, Speaker B: Uh, yes. Yes. Actually, no, not here. Implies that you have. So then you have a tangent iterated even.
00:47:35.984 - 00:47:54.446, Speaker A: Okay, so, okay. And you said at the end that this theorem generalizes this, but the setting is a little bit different because you have definable. And here you have analytic. Yeah, and not necessarily definable. Hardy field. Because analytic functions.
00:47:54.510 - 00:49:03.150, Speaker B: Yes, of course. So here, yes, you can replace analytic functions by sub analytic function in the analytic case, it was already known because, well, it's something particular of the dimension tree. It's the fact that if gamma is oscillating, then the axis is analytic. So here, if you start with some gamma, let's say you could have the fact that gamma is non oscillating with respect to analytic set, but oscillating with respect to sub analytic set. But if this happens by transforming your sub analytic set by to analytic set, by growing up, you will, you will recover upstairs something that is oscillating with respect to analytic set. Then you have an axis which is analytic. Then when you go down, since there is no sub analytic curve, you have only analytic curves.
00:49:03.150 - 00:49:25.104, Speaker B: So you will finish with analytic axis, and then you have oscillation with respect to something that is analytic. So here what we gain by replacing analytic function by sub analytic function. Well, it was already known. In this situation, I can say something.
00:49:27.084 - 00:49:34.612, Speaker C: Yeah. Here you have the hypothesis that one of the trajectory has a regular separation.
00:49:34.668 - 00:49:35.304, Speaker A: Yes.
00:49:36.284 - 00:49:44.280, Speaker C: In the general case, you can have a pencil of trajectory which is separated where no trajectory inside has this property.
00:49:44.332 - 00:49:44.712, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:44.768 - 00:49:49.968, Speaker C: So all of them are flat with respect to an analytic curve.
00:49:50.056 - 00:49:50.704, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:50.824 - 00:49:58.684, Speaker C: So there are no trajectories. So in that case, we don't, for the moment, we don't know nothing about.
00:50:01.664 - 00:50:33.754, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Well, on the other side, except for the case that you, you, you mentioned that when the, the axis is, is made of singular point of the vector field, we managed to prove that any other pencil always have a trajectory that is separated. And in fact, there is a sub analytic set which contains all trajectories which have these properties of having regular separations.
00:50:38.754 - 00:50:42.934, Speaker A: Thank you. Are there other questions, Chris?
00:50:44.634 - 00:50:53.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I just want to make sure I'm reading this properly. In your theorem, you're only assuming c one. Yes. Okay.
00:50:57.274 - 00:51:17.174, Speaker A: Other questions. Clarifications. Yeah. So, in the case of a separated pencil here. So, when you ask the question gamma is ominous, does it mean that you don't know anything or that, do you have counterexamples, examples?
00:51:17.214 - 00:51:41.464, Speaker B: No, no, no. Here. So the question is open. Okay, well, you know very well that the same question in dimension five, four, because you gave a counter example. But in dimension three and four, we don't know. Okay. And in dimension three, there are some results, in particular case where any trajectory is a minimal, actually.
00:51:42.324 - 00:51:45.428, Speaker A: So I don't have examples where it is not.
00:51:45.516 - 00:51:49.824, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. The questions is still open in dimension three and four dimension.
00:51:57.364 - 00:52:05.884, Speaker A: Thank you. More questions? Maybe online seems not to be the case.
