00:00:00.680 - 00:00:38.498, Speaker A: Good afternoon. I'd like to draw your attention again to the. They're quite formidable, but. Oh, it's epoch making. One way, say, book, monograph by Alain Kahn, non communicative geometry. It has enough research suggestions in it to keep someone busy for a lifetime. And at the same time, it's a popular, it's a masterpiece of popularization.
00:00:38.498 - 00:01:43.434, Speaker A: I would say some of you may have noticed that if I'm delayed a minute or two now, it's because I just sent out an email making my presence unnecessary, perhaps. I mean, just saying, what do we have to do today? And once you know what we have to do, I think it's so natural, this course, so natural that you can, you can just do it. You don't need any help. Okay, well, that's my, that's one, I think that's one approach. One. One way of approaching the subject, I think is very natural. Now, well, this is, this is roughly.
00:01:43.434 - 00:02:42.230, Speaker A: Not quite, but it's getting close to 100 years since modern key theory was discovered. It actually goes back thousands of years to linear algebra because the basic theorem in case theory and one way of stating the basic fact of linear algebra, just that as a group, the abelian group, which is, arises as k zero of a field, any field is what, on the, on the left. Would you remind me what your name is, please? Just. Okay. You're Justin. Okay. And what is the occasional group of a field? Yeah.
00:02:42.230 - 00:03:14.346, Speaker A: Right. The group written with blackboard Bold said, right? Yeah. And can you, can you prove that? So take the take. As for the definition of k zero, we can take a simplified definition. You take the finitely generated vector spaces, okay, over the field, and then you turn them into a semi group by taking direct sum. And that's that. That's additional operation.
00:03:14.346 - 00:04:18.790, Speaker A: Right. But it's not quite the Boolean or associative, right? Because an apple and an orange with apple called number one and orange number two, that's not the same thing as an orange and an apple, right? On the other hand, if there's two oranges, if there's two electrons, then they're indistinguishable. That's one of the basic principles. How many people have run into that? Okay, good. That's so in this course, two vector spaces with fake dimension ten, meaning the smallest number of generators is ten. This, this, we will consider them as being indistinguishable. Okay? In other words, we will look at the isomorphism classes of finitely generated vector spaces and turn them into a semigroup.
00:04:18.790 - 00:05:35.194, Speaker A: Okay. An abelian semigroup and every, every time you have an abelian semigroup, this has a mon, it has a zero element towards the monoid. Then you have an enveloping group, okay? And this is even the very oldest case of the developing group construction, because the semigroup, Clarissa, what is the semigroup? What do we get? Do you remember, have you done the calculation what you get for the semigroup? Okay, the mon, I mean, you look at the finitely generated vector spaces over a fixed field, then what does the, and you look at direct sum, an isomorphism, which is compatible, some of isomorphism classes. This is a abelian semigroup, right? With addition. Does that make sense? Well, okay, so you're not familiar with the definition, but probably sooner or later, everyone should know what a semi group is. It's because it's the one thing it secrets the, it's the progenitor of a group. Whenever you have a semi group, you get a group.
00:05:35.194 - 00:07:22.380, Speaker A: And if it's a semi group of natural numbers with addition, what's the group? Yeah, okay, and, all right, so, but that's the fundamental, that's equivalent to any other non trivial fact in linear algebra, okay? It's non trivial. It itself is non trivial, but it implies, and implies any other non trivial theorem. And, for instance, the uniqueness of a number of elements in a basic. It's finite. And, okay, but, you know, I really would like people to jump on linear algebra and look at all the trivial, the non trivial theorems and start to show that they're equivalent in trivial ways. This is fair game for exercising, okay? Even an essay, if someone wants to blow the whole subject of linear algebra out of the water, okay, somehow expose it, okay, as just a single theorem together with a theorem saying it is just a single theorem, okay? That's my fundamental theorem. That's what I like to think of as my fundamental theorem, that all the basic first order non trivial theorems are equivalent, in fact, in a trivial way, okay? So for instance, if you take the finite dimensional vector space, finitely generated vector space, you look at the dual space, then there's a one to one correspondence between linear operators in one and linear operators on the other, which interchanges injective and surjective, okay? That means that, that gives you a trivial proof.
00:07:22.380 - 00:07:59.184, Speaker A: This is an easy fact, gives you a trivial proof that the theorem injective implies surjective, is equivalent to the theorem. Surjective implies injective because it's because of the exchange, the interchange. Again, it's like quantum mechanics. It's interchange, okay? But it's like the. Anyway, okay, that's an example of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, that non trivial theorems are trivial equivalents. And how many. Maybe if there are 14 non trivial theorems in linear algebra.
00:07:59.184 - 00:09:00.104, Speaker A: And as I said, not counting canonical form, they're just the things that are basic for an arbitrary field. And don't use ring theory, just theory of the field. So what if there are 14 of these nontrivial theorems? Then how many trivial equivalences are we have to check? Well, I guess it's the number of ordered pairs among 14 elements, right? So pair numbers. You know, let me go back to grade ten or whatever it was. Is that 14 times 13? Okay, but, you know, I could go back even farther and say that from my multiplication tables, I know that such and such a number, but we never took our multiplication tables more than up to twelve by 1212 times twelve. So I don't know, 13 times 14, but you all will know that. Okay, good.
00:09:00.104 - 00:09:17.790, Speaker A: But that's like. So that's a good essay, right? That's a pretty good essay. Keeps you busy for a while. Well, no, no, whatever. I. What I want, what I assume you do two or three such trivial equivalent to this. You'll get the.
00:09:17.790 - 00:09:33.030, Speaker A: You'll. I think this will confirm in your mind the idea that it's. That linear algebra is just a single theorem. A single fact. Just a single fact. Okay. And a bunch of much easier facts.
00:09:33.030 - 00:10:02.424, Speaker A: For instance, existence of a basis. Okay. But. So, in this approach, we defined. Gave the simplest definition of k zero. In the study, we looked at certain modules and treated them in an obvious way. Now, there's another approach which gives you k zero for a unit of ring.
00:10:02.424 - 00:10:31.076, Speaker A: It's called the idempotent approach. We've been discussing that from time to time with what's done in the book. And it's just a little more computational, but it has advantages. For instance, if you have a map from one ring to another, then it's easy to see that an idempotent element goes into an idempotent element. So that's why it's a function. And equivalence goes to equivalence. That's in terms of the equivalence of line improvements.
00:10:31.076 - 00:11:04.478, Speaker A: That's just. So that's so that's. Whereas if you do it with modules, one advantage for doing it with modules is it works for arbitrary modules. Okay? You don't need to look at the modules that correspond to k zero. Item, podium. What are the. What are the modules? Remind us of the modules.
00:11:04.478 - 00:13:03.524, Speaker A: One looks at defining k zero for unit. Okay? That's true if it's over, if the ring is a field, but in general, you want the module to be a direct sum of a free module, a direct summon of a free module, right? Okay, so that's called projective, there are lots of, in general, there are lots of non projective modules in general. And, but, so if you take arbitrary modules, say finite degenerated module over a ring, then the semigroup that we talked about, isomorphism process with the natural addition, this is a function, okay, from rings to billion groups, okay, it's not the case. You're group in general. Okay? So that's one advantage, okay, but I just wanted to touch on this today because it's an ongoing project, feel like understanding the definition of k zero, but the one basis, and of course the question is that modules correspond to idempotence and equivalents of idempotence is supposed to correspond to equivalents of modules, right? If they are the right kind of modules, productive and finitely generated. Okay, well, it just turns out that, well, we've already said it. The isomarchism of the modules is equivalent to equivalence of the iron potent in the, described in the textbook.
00:13:03.524 - 00:13:57.404, Speaker A: And well, also, if you look at idempotency, look at, since matrices come into the definition, you look at idempotence and matrix algebra. That means if you take matrix algebra over a ring, then it will have the same k zero group. This semi group will be the same, whereas for modules you have to work with it because it's the same. But again, the advantages that it's true for arbitrary modules. Okay, well, let me just have a bit. I have a, as I put in my email a few minutes ago before arriving or coming here, I, has anyone taken the time to take a look at it yet? I mean, taking the time off from class, as it were. Take a look.
00:13:57.404 - 00:15:24.500, Speaker A: I don't, I don't expect it to be such a cliffhanger. We will look at it rather than listen to me talk. Okay? But it's, I put in a simple elementary exercise which should help elucidate the problem of what isomorphism could modulus, how that corresponds to equivalence of item post. Okay, so here's the general exercise, and I suggest look at it for a field, okay? Just start with a field, say, of complex numbers or the rational number. So you have, you look at not an isomorphism, but not between two general modules, but endomorphism, okay? And the special module, if the ring is the, if the ring, if the ring is the ring, r with the unit, okay, then the module is r. We're talking about left modules, I guess. Well that's, we can talk about left or right modules.
00:15:24.500 - 00:16:37.216, Speaker A: And again, a priori for arbitrary capacitive, arbitrary modules, it doesn't, I don't know that left will give you the same as left modules and give you the same group as right modules, okay. But if it's, um, it's projective, then it does, and the proof of that that I know goes through, goes through item points. That's a good exercise, I would say, to understand what's going on. Okay, so this is the left module r, okay. It multiplies on itself, multiplies itself on the left. So as vectors and as scalars at the same time, the ring element, which is a vector, gets multiplied on the left by the ring element scale. Okay, and the question is what is the, what is the homomorphism that might do a homomorphism from this, from this ring into itself? It's sometimes called endomorphism homomorphisms, but two different modules.
00:16:37.216 - 00:17:57.324, Speaker A: And this is greek, okay? Not greek to me because I studied high school, in high school I studied a bit of greek. Our latin teacher is a greek class for when you're at, okay, but you can endomorphism. And a good question then, good elementary exercise. We'll get warm up for this module approach. It's the same as the item program proposed. Okay, what's the question? The question is what is the endomorphism ring? Okay, it's a ring just composing and you can add them, adding them, linear transformations on a vector space. Linear transformation from a vector space into itself, as an example, endomorphisms, right? And if the vector space is, um, is one by one, is one, is one dimensional, which is the scalar field, what are the endomorphisms? How many endomorphisms are there? Daniel, if you have just one dimensional vector space, then what are the endomorphisms? Linear, that means a linear transformations of it into itself.
00:17:57.324 - 00:18:42.016, Speaker A: Well, zero and identity, but that's true for any vector space. But what's specially simple about the one dimensional case? Of course, if I said the zero dimensional case, it would be obvious, right? We've got a complete list already. In fact, there's zero in the identity of map, are the same any width. All right, well yes, well, well, the zero is allowed because we're not asking about isomorphism, not asking about automorphism, but endomorphism. So zero is allowed. The identity map is of course allowed. But what else do you get if it's, say the field is the complex numbers.
00:18:42.016 - 00:19:52.996, Speaker A: What's an example of a linear map or the real numbers? If it's the real numbers, what's the example? What's the graph of a linear map from the real numbers into itself? What does the graph look like? If you draw the graph in two dimensional space, what does it look like? It's a straight line, right? Okay, but then the straight line has a slope, right? And that's a real number. Well, I guess that's the linear transformation multiplying by that real number. Okay, and so I guess, in general, if you have a field, the endomorphisms are multiplying by an element of the field. And if it's a two dimensional vector space, it directs some of two copies of the field considered as vectors. Then the endomorphism ring. Arishi, what's the endomorphism ring? Yes. Everyone agree with that? Charlie, that ring a bell? So I'm just trying to get people to ride this like a favorite horse.
00:19:52.996 - 00:20:20.696, Speaker A: Okay, it's, I mean, linear algebra, because that's what this course is. It's glorified linear algebra with a bit of calculus thrown in. Don't. Don't quote me on that. Of course, of course I'm broadcasting worldwide. Right. All right, so what would be the.
00:20:20.696 - 00:21:12.062, Speaker A: Anyone want to just blurt out? Well, that's maybe not a very good way of saying it, but anyone wants to say immediately what the answer is for the arbitrary unit of rings? Okay, how many other people? He's ready to jump off the. But yes. Remind me of your name. It's a little dark. My excuse is it's just slightly dark over here at the edge, and, well, it's getting less dark all the time, I must admit. I mean, I'm getting a little more familiar with this. Okay, so, Jack, what's the answer exactly? We just decided that's what it was for a field.
00:21:12.062 - 00:21:40.248, Speaker A: Right, okay. And it turns out that for any unit will ring. If it's not unital, then it's a more challenging question. Okay, but if the ring is unital, then it's a very good exercise to prove that. Just like first field, you get the ring itself modifying on the left, it's non commutative, so you have to modify. Oh, I'm sorry. It's a module on the left, and the endomorphism is supposed to commute with modifying on the left.
00:21:40.248 - 00:21:59.418, Speaker A: I guess that means it's going to isomorphic to r or maybe to the opposite ring. Okay, be a little careful. Have to reverse the product. Maybe that's a good exercise. Okay, what is it? Okay. And of course it's. And an element of the ring, you have to see how it acts as an endomorphism.
00:21:59.418 - 00:22:31.592, Speaker A: Right. What's going to not be modifying on the left? Is it in a non abelian case? And so what's it going to be doing? Well, yeah, well, in the community. In the community case too, but you wouldn't notice. Yeah, yeah. And it's very, very careful, uh, not saying on the right side, because it is the right side, but it's also the side which is called the right side. Okay, sorry. Okay.
00:22:31.592 - 00:22:58.190, Speaker A: No. Okay, so, um. So you could say r and you might better say with some right modification, but then maybe is it r or r up. Okay. Op means the opposite ring where you set a model for x times y. Opposite is y times x in the original sense. Okay.
00:22:58.190 - 00:23:11.474, Speaker A: So. And this is something that I have to keep. I don't have it at my fingertips 100%. Okay. But I'm aware of the possibility. I'm willing to bet even money. The theology.
00:23:11.474 - 00:24:03.446, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's still a ring and. Yeah. And the unit is still the unit and the zero is still the son. Okay. So that's a very important concept, because in our course, sister, algebras are going to be, are going to be non commutative rings, right? So when Professor Kahn says non communicative geometry, that's his term in this sense. I think, I think in algebraic geometry, there's a somewhat related term.
00:24:03.446 - 00:24:17.220, Speaker A: Yes. Are you. Please, let me, let me guess. Are you abu? No. Okay, Sadek. Okay, how's that? Okay. If I can get everyone with one mistake, I'd be happy.
00:24:17.220 - 00:25:05.836, Speaker A: Okay, so, Sadek, what is your question? That's a very good question. And the answer is no. Okay. And in the setting of phenomena algebra, people have written technical papers, give sucking examples where it's not true. Okay. And the same persistor algebra. Now, one reason I don't have these samples at my fingertips is I concentrated on what are called classifiable feature algebra for simple, simple variants, including the k zero.
00:25:05.836 - 00:25:45.264, Speaker A: It's a class which can be which, the k zero functor and related things, k one and traces, actually tell you what the algebra is. Okay, that's true for the UHF algebra too, by the way, but they're included. But the classifiable ones, because the invariant which determines the algebra and isomorphism between the invariant come from isomorphism between the algebra. That means that if there were something not isomorphic to its opposite, then the invariant would not be isomorphic. Okay. But. And if it's non abelian groups, then a group can be non, a group can be not isomorphic to its opposite.
00:25:45.264 - 00:26:38.754, Speaker A: I don't think the map to the inverse, actually, that is an isomorphism of the alpha. Okay, so what I was going to say was that the invariant is, if you look at the invariant, then it doesn't distinguish between an algebra and its opposite. Okay. And one way to say that is we've already seen a glimpse of that with the definition of k zero in terms of idempotence. Left module, the left module discussion construction and the right module construction of k zero are the same. Okay? So of course, saying that the group itself is invariant to its opposite, that's not really enough. You want to know, you know, that the whole invariant.
00:26:38.754 - 00:28:20.126, Speaker A: Anyway, the answer is that the classifiable ones are all isomorphic that are opposite because they're true at the level of invariant. And with the non classifiable ones, well, they're going to, if you're going to classify them to some extent, you've got to introduce a non mirror symmetric invariant, and that hasn't been done yet. Okay. But. Okay, no, very good question. Okay, so, okay, so this was supposed to be just a brief sort of last part recap, gradually making headway into understanding what j zero is. But now I want to talk about one of the fundamental, one of the basic discoveries that led to the development of operated algebra theory to its present extent, namely Wims PhD work and what proved that the UHF algebra, tensor products of matrix algebra.
00:28:20.126 - 00:28:48.840, Speaker A: I will keep recapping of what the definition of this is, okay. But I think the, just the terminology would be nice if people start to accept the terminology as a reminder of the, of the objects. Okay. What the objects are but two things. Two matrix algebra is isomorphic to another matrix algebra. Right? Evolved by the orders of the matrix algebra. That's a good exercise, by the way, to check that.
00:28:48.840 - 00:29:30.384, Speaker A: Have you taken, have you taken a look at that, Verisa? So m two, do we might have been discussing this at some point? M two tensor, m two is itself a single matrix algebra as an algebra. Okay. And you can check which one it is by just calculating the linear dimension. And that's 16, right? Or m two is four dimension four. M two is dimension four. Four times four is 16. And what's the single matrix algebra that has some order, has linear dimension 16? Well, you have to take the square root of 16.
00:29:30.384 - 00:29:52.164, Speaker A: And it's not just a coincidence that these, that 16 has a square root. Okay. Because it's the tension, because it is a matrix algebra. This is a basic fact. Which explains why certain numbers have a square root. Okay? There are other cases of that using quaternion. Quaternions are very good to show that.
00:29:52.164 - 00:30:17.664, Speaker A: Something about sums of squares. Has anyone seen that? Okay, we should just look it up. Returning sums of squares. Okay, but, I mean, that's a different. I think that's a different sequence. Charlie, have you gone into that? Okay, but, um. Well, so, so, um.
00:30:17.664 - 00:30:52.398, Speaker A: So 16 is four squared, and if it is a matrix algebra, then it has to be m four, right? Okay, that's not a proof that it's m four. It just is a suspicious coincidence. Okay, sometimes you can work that way in that I like. I'm especially happy if I can make some progress conceptually just by noticing something fishy. Okay. Occasionally happens. Of course.
00:30:52.398 - 00:31:41.606, Speaker A: Sometimes it's me that's without a filter. Okay, so finite matrix algebra, the tensor product is another one. If it's infinite tensor product, then you don't get a ordinary matrix algebra. You get an infinite dimensional algebra, okay? And just an algebraic version of it. That's as good as we need to look at for basic ideas. Wim also made a big contribution to functional analysis algebra theory by showing. By mastering the sister algebra completion analysis of this classification.
00:31:41.606 - 00:32:24.728, Speaker A: Okay? There are a lot of techniques introduced, but the basic algebraic and case theoretical content of the subject comes at a purely algebraic level. You look at the finite tensor products, which are as algebra. If you add more and more finite dimensional matrix algebra, and you get larger and larger algebra, you just take the union, don't bother completing it, and you don't have to worry about the star operator classification in general, you do. I guess it's okay. But, um. So, um. So that's what we're trying.
00:32:24.728 - 00:33:19.418, Speaker A: That's what we want to cut to study that what glim had his way of doing it, but, um, Hiksmaid found a particularly elegant way of doing it, just of stating the theorem, okay? Which is based on a number theoretic fundamental number theoretic study. Well, basic number theoretic observation, okay? It's number theory, but I don't think it was familiar in number theory. Okay. I would say discover the new property of rational numbers. Okay, and what was it? Well, I outlined it in my famous email. I hope it goes through. Has anyone received it? It takes a while.
00:33:19.418 - 00:33:52.304, Speaker A: Okay. But anyway, the. So you look, on the one hand, you look at the field of rational numbers, okay? And it could be like it's contained in r, but that's. So it exists in its own. Right? We're just considering it as a. We're not considering it topologically. Okay? So let's not worry about it contained in the real number.
00:33:52.304 - 00:34:10.964, Speaker A: It's just a group. Okay, it's a group. It's a vector space. It's a field. Okay, but we're thinking of it at the moment just as a group. And suppose that you look at the subgroup. You have a group, then it has subgroups, right? Look at subgroup.
00:34:10.964 - 00:34:51.804, Speaker A: And just to simplify things, let's not look at an arbitrary subgroup. Let's look at one that contains the number one. Okay? Sort of to center it. All right? So we're looking at subgroups of q containing the number one. So the zero subgroup is not allowed. Okay, but is the integers allowed? Is the group of integers allowed? Garly? Okay, and are there other finitely generated groups that are allowed? The group of rationals is not finitely generated, right? Not a finitely generated. It doesn't have a finite set of.
00:34:51.804 - 00:35:19.840, Speaker A: Doesn't have a finite subset. It generates a whole group. That's a good exercise. But it will have lots of finitely generated subgroups. But how many people are familiar with the fact that you have a finitely generated subgroup of the integer? Then it is generated by a single element, singly generated, just like the integer. Okay? In fact, it's isomorphic to the group of integers. Well, single.
00:35:19.840 - 00:35:46.234, Speaker A: Once you know it's singly generated, that's not a mystery. So you have subgroups that are isomorphic to the group of integers, and then you have the ones that are not. Well, it's the ones that are isomorphic to the group of integers. Easy to describe. Those. Just take one over n times z, where n is equal to one, two, three. N is a natural number.
00:35:46.234 - 00:36:59.244, Speaker A: Natural number. Okay, well, what have we been talking about the last few days, last few meetings, besides natural numbers, but without getting. Without. If you don't get into algebra, what have we been talking about? What's one thing we've been talking about? Well, it's a slight generalization of. Well, maybe a hefty generalization of the natural numbers, right, Daniel? There was even a slightly cute name for him, right, Jack? Have you looked at him? I think I might have stated last week that there's a natural topology on the supernatural numbers which turns them into a countersen. Include the natural numbers among them. Okay? Because it's sequences of exponents.
00:36:59.244 - 00:37:35.744, Speaker A: Sequences of exponents. And have an exponent sequence that tells you what the power. What power of which prime number you should take okay, from zero up to infinity, the two to the infinity is an example. And if n is two to the infinity, that supernatural number expression one over n times z still makes sense. And if n is the. If n is the. If it all the opponents are infinity, then what is one over n times n? Anyone want to do a lightning calculation? It's a subgroup of q.
00:37:35.744 - 00:37:59.372, Speaker A: Okay, so what is it? Well, that's. Yes. Sorry, is that a group? Well, okay, I'd say you're. It's, uh. It's not bad for a first guess. Okay. And I asked for it by making.
00:37:59.372 - 00:38:20.304, Speaker A: By talking about lightning calculations. I mean, that's. Seriously, that. That's the way to just keep thinking about it. Okay, so we're looking at all possible subgroups of q containing the number one, but I guess I should have said containing z. Okay, it's a group subgroup. So it contains z number one.
00:38:20.304 - 00:38:41.984, Speaker A: And so the largest one is the smallest one. The smallest one is z. And then if n is a, that's what n equals one. Right? Then if n is equal to one, the supernatural number is equal to one. Then one over n times z is z. And that's this case. So that's where you have the smallest exponent, zero everywhere for every prime number.
00:38:41.984 - 00:39:04.956, Speaker A: But suppose the exponent is infinite for every prime number. Then I guess that's the largest supernatural number, right? So I guess it should be the largest subgroup. What's the largest subgroup? Sorry. Yeah. Yes. Good. Thank you.
00:39:04.956 - 00:39:35.178, Speaker A: You know, this room is not that bright yet. So I would say that if you make a lightning calculation and it comes out not perfect, don't hold back from expressing it. Okay? Expressing it. Because I might not remember, okay? Okay. So. But I think you get the picture. So here's an exercise.
00:39:35.178 - 00:40:17.464, Speaker A: If n is an arbitrary supernatural number, what's the subgroup? Okay, so then if it's two to the infinity, three to the infinity, five to the infinity, and so on, then the subgroup is q. And if n is. If the supernatural number n is what is two to the zero, three to the zero, five to the zero, and so on, then that's the subgroup z. Right? Okay. So anything in between, it's going to be an dix may prove that it was an arbitrary subgroup. Okay. That was coming from an arbitrary supernatural number, and they have to prove it, right? So that's an exercise.
00:40:17.464 - 00:41:08.492, Speaker A: I would say that this whole circle of ideas could be viewed as an essay, serious essay. Okay? And this is without getting into sea Star algebra, view, without getting into Internet tensor products, algebraic c star, or algebraic of purely, in this setting, purely algebraic reflection. And without. Even before we get into that, we're just sort of warming up the Dixmae's approach to Wim's work. This is a fact. If you ask your favorite number theorist, does he know this? There's a one to one correspondence between. You asked him about singly generated subgroups containing z, then he would tell you immediately that it's one over n times z, where n is a natural number.
00:41:08.492 - 00:41:50.100, Speaker A: Probably any high school student could tell you that. Okay, do high school students know what the rational numbers are? The group and the subgroups of rational numbers, they know what the integers are, or. Sorry. Well, I think I did. I'm just always assuming that people know more and more all the time. It seems that way anyway. Okay, well, that's so.
00:41:50.100 - 00:42:16.604, Speaker A: That's so even without mentioning sister algebra the whole day. Yes, Charlie. Yes. Well, you said that, I think. Well, I said. I just concurred. So we may end.
00:42:16.604 - 00:42:53.568, Speaker A: We may have to keep checking our work. Right. Okay, you. Did you study Greek? Okay, how many people study Greek? Yes. So what's the name for it? When that supernatural number is two to the infinity. So what's. What's the subgroup you get? Wait, no, no, that's when it's.
00:42:53.568 - 00:43:07.202, Speaker A: All the exponents are infinity. If just a single. If all the rest are zero. So you don't have any factors of any prime numbers except two, then. Yeah. Yeah. So a dyad is a.
00:43:07.202 - 00:43:20.542, Speaker A: There's something to do with the number two. And it's dyadic numbers. Okay. It's. Usually they're considered as a ring because they are a ring. But not every subgroup, not every subgroup of q is a ring, of course. That's a good.
00:43:20.542 - 00:43:44.784, Speaker A: That's a good question. When is a subgroup of q a ring? Well, I guess it's when. If all the exponents are infinite, you get q. If all the exponents are zero, you get zed. Those are both rings. Maybe all the exponents have to be maybe. And so if it's two to the infinity, then the exponents are all zero, except for one, which is infinite.
00:43:44.784 - 00:44:12.220, Speaker A: I suppose if we. Okay, so here I'm doing a lightning calculation. I hope. I hope that's wise. The question is, when is the subgroup closed under multiplication? Right? Well, I guess it's when anyone want to. Yeah. Well, why just.
00:44:12.220 - 00:44:41.496, Speaker A: Yeah, so some of. As long as the only exponents, all. If all exponents are zero or infinity, then you have a ring. If and only if, I guess. Okay. And by the way, interestingly enough, this turns the. Well, the, this ring, this group, by the way, is the k zero group, okay, of the, Uhs algebra corresponding to this supernatural number and the number one.
00:44:41.496 - 00:45:21.034, Speaker A: The number one is the class of the unit. That's, that's the normalized calculation. The algebra is a unit. It's idempotent. You have the special element one, that special idempotent one, if it's modules, you have the special module consisting of the whole algorithm, okay? So in either case, these are the k groups of. Either way you look at it, these are the k groups of flimsy algebra. And that's what Dixmere sort of noticed, okay? So he said, if you can get the group, this is a one to one correspondence between the groups and the supernatural numbers.
00:45:21.034 - 00:46:18.646, Speaker A: And the supernatural number, by the way, is exactly the data of the, uh, of Uhs algebra. If you know the group first have two UHF algebras and they have the same group with the same inclusion of the integers and both containing one, the same group, then, then they have the same supernatural number. So they're equal. They're just exactly the same. Uhf algebra infinite tensor product, prime power or prime power order matrix output. Okay, so this is the. Once you understand this, then you have glimpse thesis, okay, which was the beginning of a lifetime of various important contributions to science still going on, which at one point I mentioned the presidential medal that he was awarded once.
00:46:18.646 - 00:47:00.704, Speaker A: A number of people in sister algebra theory have been awarded presidential medal. Maybe there's one every year in science, not so often in math, but also he was the, he was one of the people who. It's a considerable distinction to be elected the president of the American Mathematical Society. Well, also in Canada, Canadian Mathematical Society, the Gwynne was the president of the AMS for a while. So was his colleague working on sea structures in quantum field theory. Arthur Jaffe. He was the president of the.
00:47:00.704 - 00:47:24.094, Speaker A: I don't know if he got a presidential medal. I don't think. I don't think he quite managed to attain that. But one of the main theorems in this course is called the bat Puri dusty theorem. Well, two comments on Raul Bach. He was educated here. He came from Czechoslovakia, I believe, in 1968, and a lot of people did, and the country was called Czechoslovakia.
00:47:24.094 - 00:48:10.554, Speaker A: And item two is the. For inventing the Bottra distie theorem. For discovering it, he was awarded the presidential medal of science and for other work, but related, I think you could say his work was related to that. Well, all right. I think maybe other people waiting. Any comments or questions? If anyone wants to discuss something briefly, then, well, for a while, then there's lots of space outside.
