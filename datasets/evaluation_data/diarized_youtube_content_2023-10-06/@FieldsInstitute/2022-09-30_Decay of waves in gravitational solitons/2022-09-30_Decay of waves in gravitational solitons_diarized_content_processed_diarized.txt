00:00:00.120 - 00:00:42.194, Speaker A: K of base in gravitational solitude. Okay, thank you. So, this is joint work with my PhD advisor, Hari Kanduri, who is right now at McMaster. And what we've done here is move one step closer to understanding the stability of a certain class of space times called gravitational solitons. So, the outline of the talk is this. So, the result is we're trying to understand the stability of this one parameter family of space times through deriving certain bounds for the wave equation. That is this.
00:00:42.194 - 00:01:50.972, Speaker A: And so the space time appears here as the box g of the Dalumbersian in the background of the spacetime. So g is the background metric here. So, first, I'll start with some introduction to the initial value problem to motivate the notion of stability that we derive from the initial value problem and then explain what its relation is to the bounds on the wave equation. And next, I'll describe what this one parameter family of gravitational solitons is. So, these are special solutions in five dimensions. And I'll also briefly explain why we are working in five dimensions, why not in just four? And then I'll just present a bunch of bounds, which is going to summarize our result, which is a sharp decay rate for waves in the spacetime. Okay, so, the framework that we are in is Einstein field equations.
00:01:50.972 - 00:02:30.764, Speaker A: So in particular, we are looking at Lorenzene manifolds, which satisfy equation one, which are the Einstein equations. And here qab is the stress energy tensor, which describes matter in the universe. It could be electromagnetic, magnetic fields or fluids. And one itself is not a closed system. When you have matter, you have to supplement it with the equations for the matter terms as well. So, for example, for electromagnetism, those would be Maxwell's equations. And the example that we'll be looking at is for the example that we'll be looking at, it would be the wave equation.
00:02:30.764 - 00:03:14.614, Speaker A: The Ritchie curvature has this dependence on the matrix. It's a second derivative and it is nonlinear. Nonlinear in the metric. So the system of equations one, it's nonlinear and a couple set of PDE's. But using symmetry assumptions, you can still derive some very special solutions. I guess the most well known, which actually predates, predates even general relativity, is the Minkowski spacetime, which has a mass of zero. And because of this, it's also considered the ground state or the zero state of this system.
00:03:14.614 - 00:04:09.518, Speaker A: And the metric on this manifold is the simplest lorenzian analog of the euclidean metric. The next solution, which is non trivial, with, sorry, with non zero mass, is the Schwarzschild spacetime, which describes a black hole with a mass m, and this mass also appears as a parameter in the solution. And then there's also the Kerr black hole, which is, which is a rotating black hole with mass and angular momentum. So this is the two parameter solution. All these solutions are what are called stationary solutions or time invariant solutions, at least in the Schwarzschild case, which is non trivial. You can see this in the form of time independence in the metric functions. And stationary solutions in any system have the interpretation that there are equilibrium states.
00:04:09.518 - 00:05:37.608, Speaker A: And whenever you have an equilibrium state, a natural question to ask is, okay, is this equilibrium stable or unstable? And that is what we are going to do. We are going to understand how to post this question of whether this stationary solution that we are looking at is stable or unstable. Okay, so let n of five be no set of differential equations, and let phi zero be a stationary solution. From a differential equations point of view, we understand, or we take that a solution is stationary if at a later stage, perturbations which start close to it or close even after, you know, some time or some other parameter. So, to understand that, one basic question is, what kind of PD's are the Einstein field equations? Because that's going to greatly influence how we speak about what the perturbations are. And the second question is, okay, if we know what the field equations are, what form they are, then what can we say about the perturbations of stationary solutions? And the answer to question one was established through the work of Shoke, Brujah and Garoche. And they established that the Einstein field equations actually behave like a set of wave equations.
00:05:37.608 - 00:06:57.564, Speaker A: They're hyperbolic in nature. So the right way to study them is as an initial value problem as opposed to a boundary value problem. And for a wave equation, the usual initial, the initial data that you provide at time equal to zero is you specify what the displacement is and you specify what the velocity is. And the analogs for lorenzian manifold are the following. So it's this initial t is equal to zero manifold, a space like a romanian manifold, the metric on that manifold, and the extrinsic curvature which is like your velocity, and the existence result by shoke, Brujah and Garos that completes the well postedness of this initial value formulation, which tells us that given this initial data satisfying certain constraint equations which come up because we are talking about embedding one manifold into the other. So these are the Gosskirazi equations. Then there is a unique, globally hyperbolic maximal spacetime that my initial surface embeds into, and which has the induced metric h and the extrinsic curvature k.
00:06:57.564 - 00:07:38.944, Speaker A: So now we have the right kind of framework to ask questions about stability. Now, even though we know that Einstein field equations take this form, this is still nonlinear, the q here. So I think I've changed my notations a little bit. So, the q here is just meant to denote nonlinear terms in the derivatives of g and t is a stress energy tensor. So this is still nonlinear. So, the simplest model problem to study is that of a single scalar field in the background of the space time. That is, we try to understand what waves do in the background of the spacetime.
00:07:38.944 - 00:08:24.566, Speaker A: So this is the simplest model problem because we take only one kind of perturbative behavior into account. We are actually asking what happens to the scalar field in the background of the spacetime. I am not really talking about what happens to the metric under the effect of the field itself. Great. Okay, so the solution that we'll be looking at is what is called a gravitational soliton. So I'll mention the metric here and also some properties. But in the next two slides, it'll be clear why we have to deal with something that is far more complicated than, say, Schwarzschild or kerr.
00:08:24.566 - 00:08:55.878, Speaker A: So this is a five dimensional metric, and it is a solution to this action here. So this is just a gravitational action written down in the language of differential forms. This is the usual gravity term that you have. So the Hodge dual of R. And this is the usual electromagnetic term that you get. And I have one extra term here which gives rise to a nonlinear electromagnetic field. So it's fh, fha.
00:08:55.878 - 00:09:36.644, Speaker A: This is a term which can only be supported in five dimensions. You cannot have something that's five dimensional form in four dimensions. And the field equations that this action gives rise to are these. These are the usual electromagnetic field equations. But the field itself, you know, is the field equations for, you know, the electromagnetic field that is nonlinear. So we have d star f equal to f edge f. So this system is asymptotically flat, and it has r times su, two times u, one symmetry.
00:09:36.644 - 00:10:21.564, Speaker A: All this means is you can think about a rotating system in five dimensions. And we are talking about an evolutionary system here which is stationary. So it's just r times something that's four dimensional. So there are two ways that there are two planes of rotation. The Su two times u one just means that those two rotations are equal. So if you're familiar with what is called a Myers Perry black hole, this just is the situation where both the angular momenta are equal. Okay? So because this is highly symmetric with equal angular momenta, it's just a one parameter family of solutions, which is either the mass or the charge, and they're both related.
00:10:21.564 - 00:11:09.530, Speaker A: And the topology of spatial slices is cp two minus a point. And this is a solution that we've just taken from an extensive work of Gibbons and Warner, who were studying these solutions in the context of string theory. What is special about the solution, which is a primary reason we are studying the solution, is that it's globally regular and non trivial. So what these words mean are globally regular means you don't have a singularity. So this solution does not contain a black hole, unlike the Schwarzschild space time or the cursed space time, and it's a non trivial solution. So if you calculate the mass, it's not going to be zero. So I'm not just looking at some complicated metric, which might end up being Minkowski in a nice coordinate system.
00:11:09.530 - 00:11:27.714, Speaker A: So it does have a massive. Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, it's complete. Yeah. There are no singularities of. Yes, yeah, it's complete enough positive mass. Okay.
00:11:27.714 - 00:11:40.614, Speaker A: Yeah, yes. Okay. So it's why. I see. But you don't need five dimensions. Is that just because you. That is an impressive.
00:11:40.614 - 00:12:25.424, Speaker A: Oh, um, nonlinear electro. You can do like, just some other launch. You have different electrons in different ways. Um, so, okay, so, I mean, so the answer. Okay, maybe the next two slides will give an answer to it, but if not, I'll come back to the question after the next two. Okay, so, yeah, so for your question, just linear Einstein Maxwell, I can show why it's not going to give you a system with a mass. So let's assume.
00:12:25.424 - 00:13:06.054, Speaker A: So let's just have the very basic assumptions. So we want to study stationary solutions. Like, you know, we want to study some sort of an equilibrium configuration, and we want to look at asymptotically flat space times. And the only other things are we want to look at a spacetime which has mass, which we don't want it to be, you know, just a flat space time, and we want it to be globally regular. So I don't want any horizons, no black holes. Okay, so are these conditions simultaneously satisfied by any Einstein Maxwell system? Okay, so let's look at that. So let, let m, g and f give.
00:13:06.054 - 00:13:48.228, Speaker A: Let that be a spacetime with the electromagnetic field. And I'm looking only at stationary solutions. And let's recall that space times are simply connected. These are my Einstein field equations. So the first is just, you know, the field equation and the second, second and third are Maxwell equations. So from the third equation, I can use Carton's formula, which gives you a relation between the lead derivative exterior derivative and the interior derivative. And say that this quantity here, so this is the interior derivative with respect to the stationary killing field f, is a two form.
00:13:48.228 - 00:14:16.594, Speaker A: So this is going to be a one form, and we have a one form in a simply connected spacetime. So if it's closed, it is closed from Maxwell's equations. So if it's closed, it should be generated by a potential. It's also exact. So I know that this is true. And I can make the same argument for the dual of f, which is also a two form in four dimensions. So that is also going to be exactly.
00:14:16.594 - 00:15:03.496, Speaker A: Now, because this is a stationary space time, let's go ahead and compute the comar mass of the spacetime. So when I look at the coma mass, so k is just the stationary killing vector field. I can use the field equations and get up to here. So the field equations are going to just give me this. And because I know that this is going to be an exact form, I can write them as a total differential. Now, if I compute, you know, if I use divergence theorem and compute what this quantity is at infinity, I'm assuming that this is an asymptotically flat space time. So I'm going to impute, I'm going to impose the same decay conditions for the fields as well.
00:15:03.496 - 00:15:35.814, Speaker A: So if I compute them at infinity, they are all going to be zero, unless, unless there is an inner boundary. So if there's an inner boundary, I would get one other term from the divergence theorem, which would be a horizon. So what I'm trying to say here is. Okay, that's better. Oh, yes. Okay, so what I'm trying to say here is, okay, so I have some quantity here. And let's say this is my sphere at infinity.
00:15:35.814 - 00:16:16.904, Speaker A: Using the divergence theorem, I'm just computing it. The quantity there is just the difference of what it is at infinity. Sorry, there's no surface here. So this is just sigma. So unless there is a boundary somewhere in between, which is a horizon, these are the only two contributing terms, and they both go to zero when you don't have any other boundary. So all this is to conclude, okay, so, okay, if it is zero, then we know from the rigidity of positive mass theorem that it can only be Minkowski spacetime. So the rigidity of.
00:16:16.904 - 00:16:37.414, Speaker A: So Minkowski has zero mass. And if you have something that has zero mass, it is Minkowski. So that's the rigidity of positive mass. And so that's the only solution that you can have now. Yes. So this is in the context of linear electromagnetism. I guess that probably doesn't answer the question you were asking if.
00:16:37.414 - 00:17:04.084, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, sure. Okay. Yes. So, yeah, so this is a theorem that was proved by Leitnerovics, who said, you know, who stated that indeed is equal to four. Einstein Maxwell theory does not admit any non trivial solution. Okay? And the only other conditions that I'm using here are stationarity and the fact that it's asymptotically flat. And.
00:17:04.084 - 00:17:50.850, Speaker A: Okay, and one other thing. So if my killing vector field has what are called ergo regions or ergo surfaces, if it goes null anywhere, then this statement is not going to hold true, because globally regular means globally regular. And globally stationary means that your killing vector field is time like everywhere. The stationary killing vector field is time like everywhere. So those are the only conditions. And even if you violate one of them, you can have solutions, and you definitely have solutions where your space time is not asymptotically flat, like Kaluza twine is an example. Okay? So, right.
00:17:50.850 - 00:18:02.334, Speaker A: So that is why we are looking at. That is why we are working in five dimensions. And, you know, we would like to understand how waves behave in the solution. Okay? Yes.
00:18:03.874 - 00:18:11.134, Speaker B: So the one, the solution that you present in D for five, and if d equals four, it is four.
00:18:11.434 - 00:18:14.218, Speaker A: Yeah. So this argument is for d is equal to four.
00:18:14.346 - 00:18:19.266, Speaker B: Where does the d equal four? Like what, what's special about four?
00:18:19.370 - 00:19:19.350, Speaker A: Okay, so when you. So in, you know, in five dimensions, your just going by the calculations, the hodge dual of your electromagnetic field, which is a two form, is a three form. So you can make this statement about it being exact only if the second homology is trivial. And so for a simply connected space, it's not, not always true. So for a simply connected space, you know, that close one forms are exact, but close to forms. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so now just to, you know, summarize and have a takeaway message from all from the really nasty looking metric, let me just mention that solitrons are globally, um, stationary smooth, asymptotically flat space times, uh, with a positive mass.
00:19:19.350 - 00:19:58.066, Speaker A: Um, and the word soliton is, uh, uh, you know, used in an analogous sense, as in there are standing wave solutions to nonlinear wave equations. And so this is a gravitational analog of it. You have a mass, but it really doesn't collapse to form a black hole or doesn't dissipate away. Uh, it's just there, stationary. So that's why we're calling this a soliton. And it's possible only in five dimensions or higher, at least with the, you know, with the assumptions of asymptotically flat stationary. And you can prove that there are no solutions in Einstein Maxwell theory, which we have seen.
00:19:58.066 - 00:20:34.464, Speaker A: And it has also been proved that there are no vacuum solutions in higher dimensions. And so, so this time like killing vector field, it's globally time like, there are no, ergo, regions. This is something to keep in mind for the analysis later on. And they have a high energy theory interpretation. So these are space times which have a certain mass, and you can think of them as degenerate states or black holes with the same mass or the same charge. Okay, so yes, these are horizonalized solutions. No, no ergo regions, and they're asymptotically flat.
00:20:34.464 - 00:21:33.606, Speaker A: Okay, so now moving to how we look at waves in this spacetime and how we understand stability, the stress energy tensor that gives you the wave equation as one of the equations of motion is this. And if t and, and are future directed and time like, you can prove that this, the contraction of q with t and n is positive definite. And moreover, it controls all the derivatives of phi. And that is exactly the kind of quantity you need when you're talking about a wave equation. You need to be able to define some sort of energy at initial time. And we need, we want to be able to talk about what happens to that energy when initial data is evolved. That's our definition of what an energy is.
00:21:33.606 - 00:22:12.104, Speaker A: And if t is a time like killing vector field, then this divergence is zero. So this is zero. So when you look at the divergence, there are two terms. One would be the divergence of q, which is just the divergence of the stress energy tensorflow, which would be zero. If from Bianchi identities, and the second term is zero, then t is a killing vector field. Now, I integrate this quantity over a region enclosed by two space like surfaces, and I use the divergence theorem. So I integrate over.
00:22:12.104 - 00:23:00.028, Speaker A: So this is my initial hyper surface, and this is something after a later time. And I, sorry, I integrate, I integrate this quantity. And because of the divergence of zero, what I'm left with is this equality. So the integral of this at a later time is exactly equal to the integral of that than I started with. Okay, now, so for stability, there are two basic questions we ask. Is this energy bounded? So if the system is going to blow up after a finite time, then it's possible that that kind of behavior is seen in the scalar field. So that is the basic thing that one wants to check.
00:23:00.028 - 00:23:36.186, Speaker A: And the second is decay. So similar to how you throw a pebble in a pond and see the waves dissipate. You want to say that energy in some local region is dying with time. So that is what decay is. And delta t is just a function of time which goes to zero as t goes to infinity. So you want to answer these two questions when we talk about stability. So, for gravitational solitons, no part of sigma t or sigma zero is null.
00:23:36.186 - 00:24:21.646, Speaker A: So we are looking at t is equal to constant slices. And we said that this vector field is globally stationary. So no part of my initial slice or my latest slice is null. And what happens if one of them is null? What happens if there is, say, a horizon? This quantity would still be positive, but it would not control all the derivatives. So there would be some derivatives that are on the horizon, but we don't really know what happens to them just by knowing at the initial conditions. But for gravitational solitons, that's not a case. And you can just straightforwardly prove that my energy at a later time is just equal to my energy that I started with.
00:24:21.646 - 00:24:42.048, Speaker A: Yes. Oh, okay. Yes. So to prove a statement like this, you typically need more derivatives of the function than what you started with. So e two would refer to second derivatives of, you know, phi and so on. Yeah. Yes.
00:24:42.048 - 00:25:40.118, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So we have boundedness. And so we, we are looking at gravitational solitons which have energy uniform energy boundedness. Even without further analysis, there is a result of machidis, which tells us that for stationary, asymptotically flat space times, which can possibly contain black holes, with a small ergo region for which the energy boundedness statement is true, the waves, the local energy of solutions to the wave equation, it decays at least with a logarithmic rate. No matter what your space time is, no matter, you know, the black hole or no matter the size of the earth, if you have a small ergo region, you would always have this kind of decay. So your waves would always logarithmically decay.
00:25:40.118 - 00:26:43.356, Speaker A: And because gravitational solitons satisfy all these conditions, and the ones that we care about are stationary, asymptotically flat, and we have an energy boundedness statement, this decay of waves is a given. Now, when we answer questions about decay of waves, we are also often interested in what is the best possible decay you can get. So, is there something that's faster than logarithmic because we are only looking at the simplest case of a wave traveling in the background of a spacetime. Maybe when we look at the full non linear equations, this decay isn't fast enough. Maybe it allows for nonlinearities to build up and cause instabilities. Okay, what we proved is that, in fact, the decay that we get from the result of machidis is sharp. So if I try to prove a decay statement like this, that is, if I try to better this decay, I have a log decay from the result of machine.
00:26:43.356 - 00:27:40.984, Speaker A: If I add another decaying function here, say, delta t, then that decay statement is false. Okay, so before you know heading on, what is good decay, the kind of decay one gets for black holes, say Schwarzschild, is inverse polynomial decay. And one can expect stability in the nonlinear regime when you have inverse polynomial decay. But what we have is what is usually categorized as slow decay. That is, the best kind of decay you can get is inverse logarithmic. Other space times which have this kind of decay are black rings and also cur radius for space times. And all these space times have a slow decay for the same reason, which is that there is a stable trapping of null geodesics in these space times.
00:27:40.984 - 00:28:14.224, Speaker A: Okay, so let's understand the behavior of null geodesics. And it's relevant because waves in a high frequency regime behave like null geodesics and gravitational solitons. At these solutions we are looking at are highly symmetric. There are three isometries, and there is a killing tensor. So you can find integrable equations for radial null geodesics. And, and they take this form here. I have not written down the potential explicitly.
00:28:14.224 - 00:29:02.996, Speaker A: It's long and rather messy. But I have a plot here to give a contrast for what stable trapping is. Now, the trapping that I'm referring to here is not the same trapping that you see in marginally outer trap surfaces. So this kind of trapping is the trapping that occurs outside an event horizon, typically not what happens inside an apparent horizon or an even horizon. Okay, so to contrast, the r is equal to three m sphere of Schwarzschild is a trapped surface. So it is a trapped surface. And what happens is at r is equal to three m, the potential vanishes.
00:29:02.996 - 00:29:28.390, Speaker A: So that means r dot square is equal to zero. And this means that there is a stable orbit for photons to just go around. They're not going to infinity, they're not going into the black hole, so they just go around and. Yes. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yes. So that is the kind of shopping that I'm looking at here.
00:29:28.390 - 00:30:09.298, Speaker A: And a figure for what the potential is doing in the Schwarzschild case is it has a, you know, double zero here. So there is just this single surface, or single point r is equal to three m, which has this property. But for gravitational solitons, the following happens. There is a region where my potential is positive. So that means there are geodesics, but then it becomes negative, um, for, uh, you know, for an interval after that. So a consequence of this is, if I just perturb the geodesics. Uh, the ones that are here, um, remain bounded in this region.
00:30:09.298 - 00:30:56.782, Speaker A: They are not able to move away to infinity. But that is not the case with Schwarzschild. So the kind of trapping we see in gravitational solitons, where you have an open set of geodesics which are trapped, is called stable trapping. And the kind of trapping that you see in Schwarzschild, where there is just this single point which is trapped, is unstable. And the nomenclature is a little funny, because when you have unstable trapping, the space time itself is more stable. But when you have stable trapping, the underlying space time is more unstable. You can intuitively understand this as, okay, there's more energy that's clumping, pumping here, so there's far less decay, but here there is a surface where your photons could get trapped.
00:30:56.782 - 00:31:45.000, Speaker A: But that trapping phenomenon is not stable in itself. And to get an understanding of what this trapping is or what this photon sphere is, I think we are all familiar with this image of the black hole from a few years back from the event horizon telescope. A photon sphere is what gives you a glow. You know, what gives you a glow inside, in this shadow region, it is in the observable universe. But just to say that it's not inside the event horizon. So there are no null geodesics that can cross the photon sphere. So if you're inward directed, you get sucked into the black hole.
00:31:45.000 - 00:32:15.264, Speaker A: If you're outward directed, you just pass, you know, pass through the photon sphere. And that's the. It's the orbit of the least radius that the least stable photon orbit that exists. Okay? So to understand. So, that's from the picture of geodesics, and I think I have only seven more minutes. Right? Okay. Yeah.
00:32:15.264 - 00:32:38.184, Speaker A: Okay. That's from the picture of geodesics. We cannot directly convert that into using it in the wave equation. So let's try to get an intuitive picture of what happens. So let Psi be a solution to the wave equation. I'm not counting dimensions here. We'll go through some rigorous expressions later on.
00:32:38.184 - 00:33:24.408, Speaker A: So let Psi be a solution to the wave equation. And after separation of variables, let's assume that it obeys this equation. Any space time that has table trapping would have the following feature, that my potential here would have a minimum. So one can found bound state configurations, that is bound state solution, psi, n in a region. So I can, you know, I can look at problems in this small region, you know, say with richly boundary conditions and construct modes. Now, these modes are solutions in this small region. It's not a solution in the entire space time, but I can just extend this side to the whole spacetime.
00:33:24.408 - 00:34:05.304, Speaker A: But in doing so, I might come up with an error, because if I just say, okay, you know, size, whatever it is here, but then outside this region it is zero. My solution might not even be continuous. So I'm going to smoothly extend it, sorry, to the whole spacetime. And in that process I might incur an error. But if I can make that error sufficiently small, at least for high frequencies, then I can use those to find a lower bound on the energy. And that is what we do here. And these approximate solutions to the wave equations are called quasi modes.
00:34:05.304 - 00:35:08.144, Speaker A: And the load, you know, slow decay incur ads four and black rings and strings are also because of the same phenomena of stable trapping, and also use the same construction of quasi modes to prove that you cannot have decay that's faster than logarithmic. Let me quickly, quickly go through the rest. Okay, so because of the symmetry of the system, we are left with just one radial equation. When you do a separation of variables, and this is the Anzus that we use, y is a solution on some sort of Laplacian, and u obeys equation four that I've written down there. And my trapped region is any interval about my minimum, which does not contain any other minima. The goal is to find eigenfunctions to this equation with Bristole boundary conditions for the trapped surface. Now, there is one issue that we encounter here.
00:35:08.144 - 00:35:50.134, Speaker A: This is not like the usual eigenvalue problem. I have a potential here which has an eigenvalue which has an omega, but it also has a nonlinear dependence on omega. So, which is this term here. So how am I going to solve this nonlinear eigenvalue problem? So, I first look at the linear problem, which is this, which does not take the nonlinear term into account. And then I have a nonlinear parameter here, beta. And I have a family of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. So my first challenge is to how do I prove that there are solutions to eigenvalues of the linear problem.
00:35:50.134 - 00:37:00.760, Speaker A: And then I can, you know, then I can find a way to prove that, okay, if there are solutions to the linear eigenvalue problem, then somehow there are all solutions to the non linear eigenvalue problem. So for the linear eigenvalue problem, there is a well known estimate. My parameter one over n, can be taken to be h, like the Schrodinger equation. And I can ask the question of what happens as n goes to infinity or h goes to zero. These are called while asymptotics, and these are estimates that have been proved for Schrodinger type equations, which is also the kind of equation that we have here. And using a similar proof, I can prove that. Okay, so this linear problem actually has eigenvalues, and there are eigenvalues converging to any fixed energy that's suitably placed between a minimum and some value, so that there are no other minima around this.
00:37:00.760 - 00:37:48.540, Speaker A: And with that, I can prove that whenever there's a solution to the linear problem, there are always eigenvalues to the nonlinear problem as well. And those eigenvalues scale as n squared. Or I can say that omega squared over n squared, I can always find constants so that it obeys these bounds. So I'll quickly go through the rest. So now I know I have solutions to the eigenvalue problems. And what I want to understand is, if I do cut off the solutions, is my error going to be small? Because when I call something an error, it should be small in some sense, small with respect to some parameter. And we can indeed prove an estimate of that form.
00:37:48.540 - 00:38:30.348, Speaker A: All this is taking place in a one dimensional interval. Now I extend this to the entire spacetime. So this is my initial anzas, and this is my cutoff function. I extend this to the whole spacetime. And using the smallness of the error that we saw in the previous slide, I can prove that, yes, these functions are actually approximate solutions to the wave equation. And now I have an inhomogeneous wave equation. I look at a homogeneous wave equation, the same initial condition, and I can prove that the energy of the two are very close.
00:38:30.348 - 00:39:05.844, Speaker A: So for n sufficiently large, my inhomogeneous equation and my homogeneous equation have similar energy. And any statement or any construction of this form is going to make logarithmic decay the best possible form of decay that you have. I'll stop with some remarks here. The results do not prevent smooth solutions from decaying faster than logarithmic logarithmically. And it's quite possible. It just states that such a decay is not uniform. There might be solutions which decay slower.
00:39:05.844 - 00:39:27.104, Speaker A: And the phenomena of stable trapping is. It's prevalent in black rings and also cur ads and hence this construction of quasi modes. It's not specific to gravitational solitons. It's quite universal. You can construct it for any space time which exhibits stable traffic. Okay, I'll stop here. Thank you.
00:39:27.104 - 00:40:14.030, Speaker A: Questions. I have a question you mentioned before about stable trapping being related to the actual space time being unstable. Can you talk about that a little more? Oh, yes. So in. So what I was trying to say is, in Schwarzschild, the kind of trapping that you have is unstable. And so, and the kind of decay that you get for waves, and I guess recently, also for gravitational perturbations, is you have polynomial decay, which is very good decay. Polynomial decay in time.
00:40:14.030 - 00:40:38.216, Speaker A: But where you have stable trapping because of this construction, the best decay that you can get is logarithmic. You can always construct solutions which provide a lower bound for your decay. You cannot do better than that. That's what I meant by unstable corresponds to more stable spacetime, but stable trapping corresponds to. Thank you.
00:40:38.400 - 00:40:48.164, Speaker B: So, so, but your theorem actually didn't just. It looked like when you stated the theorem, it didn't just say you could construct solutions that decayed at this rate. It looked like. It said all solutions decay at this rate.
00:40:48.624 - 00:40:58.600, Speaker A: Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. So it say, it said that. Yeah, exactly. All solutions. I think what it said.
00:40:58.600 - 00:41:26.196, Speaker A: Yeah. Let me go back to that. Yeah. So here, my solutions have been tailored to be supported on this trap set omega. Maybe I'll just stop pointing the thing because it's more confusing. My solutions are constructed on the strap set omega. So I'm just saying that there is an open set and positive constants such that this estimate is true.
00:41:26.196 - 00:41:29.256, Speaker A: So there could certainly be. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
00:41:29.440 - 00:41:40.004, Speaker B: But your theorem says. It doesn't say that Phi has some relation to omega. It just says that Phi is a solution to the wave equation. So this is something I was confused about, actually. I want. So I presume you want Phi to be non zero, but.
00:41:45.824 - 00:42:03.924, Speaker A: Omega is a region in spacetime which corresponds to the trap set. Oh, I see. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I should have stated it better. So, what I'm trying to say is that there is a region of space time for which this estimate holds.
00:42:03.924 - 00:42:07.764, Speaker A: So it's not all solutions of the wave equation.
00:42:08.504 - 00:42:16.408, Speaker B: Okay. Because I guess in the formula, you take a supremum over solutions of the wave equations. I see. Okay. So it's a supreme overall solutions to the wave equation.
00:42:16.536 - 00:42:32.264, Speaker A: All solutions to the wave equations. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thank you. Actually, that's a good point question. Sorry, I went way over time.
00:42:32.844 - 00:43:04.110, Speaker C: So in that little dimension of care, down on bottom or care ads. So I guess when you said stable trapping, I understood that to be a statement about the. More than a statement about the existence of. What do they mean by what? Do they have a notion of stable trapping? And what do they mean for the care? Oh, for cur ads for. But with rotation. Do they.
00:43:04.182 - 00:43:22.300, Speaker A: What do they mean with rotation? Oh, okay. So for rotating space times, you can have more than one photon sphere, but the kind of trapping you get, just an asymptotically flat curve, is similar to what you have in Schwarzschild. It's just unstable trapping.
00:43:22.332 - 00:43:23.124, Speaker C: Oh, I see, I see.
00:43:23.164 - 00:43:38.794, Speaker A: But for ker ads four, you have, again, this, you know, minimum of the potential, which is actually between the ads boundary and, you know, somewhere close to the horizon. And you can do the same kind of construction, which is not. What is there for usual curve.
00:43:39.134 - 00:44:07.178, Speaker C: Yeah. Just when you mentioned Swatchel, you mentioned trapping in the sense of a trapped surface of the optical metric, which turned out to be the same thing. And the well incurred. There's a sort of a similar notion, but it uses Finsler geometry, which is sort of nice in a way, sort of sits halfway between the smooth world and the metric measure world. So I see, just a random thought.
00:44:07.306 - 00:44:12.842, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Well, that's a. Yeah, yeah. That's an interesting. Yeah. Okay.
00:44:12.842 - 00:44:37.620, Speaker A: Yeah. The question. Can I ask one question? Yeah, sure, sure. So your decay theorem only applies to the Soliton solutions. And then, um. And also. And any space times that have stable trapping, um, wherever.
00:44:37.620 - 00:45:10.010, Speaker A: So any space time that has stable trapping, um, your look at this equation. So you, when you look at the wave equation, it's. If you're able to separate it, one should be able to see that your potential has this sort of minimum. And when you have this minimum, that's all you need. This is not something one would find in Schwarzschild. When you have this minimum, that's all you need to construct these approximate solutions. And those approximate solutions are then going to give you a lower bound for decay.
00:45:10.010 - 00:45:31.110, Speaker A: So any space time that has. That's the voice of invading. That goes into it. Yes, yes. That is, in fact, what, that is how trapping manifests in the babe equation. Because when you want to calculate the decay, you have to integrate over the, that sigma region. Yeah.
00:45:31.110 - 00:45:53.314, Speaker A: And then if you have something like a black ring. And so I don't know, like mathematically, how does that go? You have to go around that. Okay. Okay. So for black rings, I'm going to speak about Bonomi's work here. So, for black rings, this trap surface is outside the black hole region. So it's a local construction.
00:45:53.314 - 00:46:38.314, Speaker A: And that is all you need to get you identify a local piece of the, or at least the energy that we are interested in that the decay that we would like to study is local, you know, energy. So the energy of that local vision. Other questions not. Let's thank Sharmila again. And I guess if you want to go to the colloquium, it's next door in the other. Take care of. It's a ten pass, so we do have some.
00:46:38.314 - 00:47:01.494, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. Spent overtime, which is bad. Robert, do you have the link for the close to himself? We saw the link. Really? Okay, that's okay.
00:47:01.994 - 00:47:03.134, Speaker B: Hi, Gazelle.
00:47:03.434 - 00:47:04.814, Speaker A: Hi, how are you?
00:47:06.234 - 00:47:07.014, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:47:14.024 - 00:47:16.480, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:47:16.512 - 00:47:25.072, Speaker B: No, but then you said that your work won't apply to anything that has trappings or stable trapping, like per ads.
00:47:25.208 - 00:47:26.484, Speaker A: Oh, yes, yes.
00:47:27.024 - 00:47:28.352, Speaker B: Not have a per ads.
00:47:28.368 - 00:47:49.454, Speaker A: Does it? Does, it does. So the construction really doesn't care about, you know, any of those features. So for cur ads. Okay, where does ergo region come into play? Energy boundedness. Right. So when I have. Where is my presentation? Okay, I'll show it to you here.
00:47:49.454 - 00:48:06.692, Speaker A: So, not having ergo regions, the way that, I don't know, our work benefited was we could just use this theorem of machidists, who gave, who gives an upper bound? Okay, so I can.
00:48:06.708 - 00:48:10.384, Speaker B: Then you're using the global stationary.
00:48:10.804 - 00:48:35.624, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Yeah. So it gives, I mean, here, not globally stationary, but then the energy boundedness statement. So that, you know, I'm using that to say that, okay, this kind of bound holes, this kind of upper bound holes. And so the kind of decay rate I have is sharp. So this means it decays at least logarithmically. What we have is it decays at most logarithmically.
00:48:36.084 - 00:48:44.924, Speaker B: So in fact, Sharmila, in machidists statement, you said something like, if it permits smaller regions, so what does it mean for to be small?
