00:00:03.760 - 00:00:55.324, Speaker A: Hello and welcome everybody to today's lecture. So, before I begin with mathematical content, let me make a little administrative announcement. And notice that according to the field schedule, there is a lecture of my course next week on October 11. Unfortunately, October 11 is thanksgiving day here in Canada, so the university is closed and I decided to stick to U of T schedule. So. Well, I will also put the announcement on the webpage, but just wanted to make it here that there will be no lecture on October 11. Instead, I will give another lecture on November 29, again according to University of Toronto calendar.
00:00:55.324 - 00:01:37.644, Speaker A: Okay, so that was this little admin announcement. I will repeat it again at the end of the class, if I remember. And now let us return to mathematics. And last time we finished with the definition of extremal length. It's a conformal invariant object, as we proved last time. And so here I'm flashing the definition and I stated some properties of it without proving them. So let me prove them now.
00:01:37.644 - 00:02:53.604, Speaker A: First theorem is uniqueness of extremal length. So if you are lucky enough to have two extreme matrix with the same area, then they are the same almost everywhere. Let us prove it. So, without loss of generals, we of course can assume that both of them have area one. And take the arithmetic mean. Then the length of every curve is of course bounded is equal to one half length in 1 meter to one half length in the other. So, infimum of such lengths is bounded below by one half, infamous, on the other hand, area, you just plug them in and so you get that area should be equal to one half area of ra one plus one half area of ra two plus one half integral of rho one rho two.
00:02:53.604 - 00:03:43.424, Speaker A: So one quarter, one half row one row two, which of course is bounded by one by cashier, and equality is reached if and only if. Well, you have a quality. Here is rho one equal to rho two. Again, it's bounded by just since integral of rho one squared and integral of rho two squared are equal to one. Just have this from fascia. So, just a remark, which is important and which I already made last time, is that extremal metric doesn't always exist. Okay, so now a few rules for extremal lengths, which would be very important very soon today.
00:03:43.424 - 00:04:25.284, Speaker A: So suppose first that your family gamma prime is an extension of family of gamma. What do I mean by that? It means that for any curve in gamma prime, there is a curve of gamma inside it. So you literally just add lengths to the curves. Then of course, it's logical to assume that extreme lengths of the longer family is longer, and the proof is easy. You just consider almost extremal metric. Remember that extremal doesn't exist for gamma. And then you extend it to your big domain.
00:04:25.284 - 00:05:44.476, Speaker A: Just by being zero on the complement area doesn't change, of course, u extended by zero. But the length of every curve in the new metric is bounded below by the length of the old curves in the old metric. Again, because gamma, each curve in u family contains a curve in the old family. So that was a very easy trivial observation, but again, a solely observation, that's actually very useful. So a bit of extension of this is the serial role. So suppose that you have took your families in disjoint domains, and then you, sorry, you create a family which extends both of them. So for each curve in the new family, it should contain curve in one family and curve in the other.
00:05:44.476 - 00:06:45.614, Speaker A: So the picture that you should have in mind is that something like this, let me actually draw it. So this would be your gamma one curves from here to here. This would be gamma, two curves from here to here. And gamma would be all curves, say from here to here. That would be gamma. Okay? And so this says that you have this inequality that the length of the extent of the bigger family is at least some of the extremas. And actually it's very interesting to discuss when the equality is reached here.
00:06:45.614 - 00:07:49.604, Speaker A: But again, that's for another time. Okay? So for the proof, observe that of course, if extremal length of any of them is equal to zero, than just an extension rule, because of course by previous, gamma just extends to the gamma one or gamma two. So assume that extremal length of both of them is positive. And now choose rho one and rho two, and we can normalize them. So normalize them the following way. That area of rho one is equal to the length of row one, which means that the length of rho one, remember that area is l squared over a. So we make these two cancels the same with rotor, and again we make them almost extreme.
00:07:49.604 - 00:08:32.154, Speaker A: So l squared over a is close to lambda of gamma one here and lambda of gamma two here. And now let us create row which is just combination of these two. So it was actually very important to normalize them the way I just normalize them. And so this is an extended metric. Then length in this metric is of course bounded by the length by the sum of lengths in the two metrics. Because of course, look at the picture. Every curve here contains curve here and curve here.
00:08:32.154 - 00:09:33.534, Speaker A: Area is the sum of areas which is the sum of the lengths, because that's the way we normalize. So extreme length of new bigger family gamma is at least the minimal length of gamma and the length rho squared divided by area of rho, which is exactly. Well, it's not an equality here, it's a quality. And again, we took almost extreme one. Now we take extremums extreme supreme and we are done. Okay, so now the rules. Rule three is a dual.
00:09:33.534 - 00:10:24.934, Speaker A: So again, the picture here is very similar to what we have here. But again we want dual. So we now have these two domains and then these two things, gamma one, gamma two. And the gamma would be all curves which I is in gamma one or in gamma two. So more specifically, we want the following. So gamma is a curve family. Now in the domain omega one union is omega two.
00:10:24.934 - 00:11:18.074, Speaker A: And for every gamma which is in gamma one or gamma two, the exist gamma prime which is inside one of them. Because now the inequality would be in the other direction. If you want to be able to include, so occur from gamma would be smaller than the curve from union of gamma one and gamma two. So remember, this is disjoint union. So for any curve and gamma one, for example, there should be curve here which is smaller. And so then the parallel rule is this, that it's essentially dual to this one. And here the proof is very similar.
00:11:18.074 - 00:11:58.874, Speaker A: We take any rho on omega on the union, normalize it such that the extremal length of this, sorry, not extreme, just length of this family is one. Then of course, length of gamma one is at least one. Because remember, each curve from gamma one contains a curve from gamma. Each curves from gamma two contains a curve from gamma. This is print here. This is not common. This is length.
00:11:58.874 - 00:12:56.184, Speaker A: Okay, so, so length of both of them is at least one area of row is at least area of row in omega one plus area of row in omega two. So we assume that omega can be a much bigger domain. And then since this was the way we normalized, this is at least one over lambda of gamma one. And this one is lambda of gamma two. Because again, this we have this inequality. And now we take the supreme mobile row, we get exactly what we want. Okay, so that's easy.
00:12:56.184 - 00:13:45.974, Speaker A: And finally, symmetry rule. Suppose that you have a symmetry which is analytical, anti analytic map. T squared is identity. So my favorite symmetry is of course reflection with respect to circle, always respect to a line. And suppose that gamma itself is invariant under this reflection. Then it is enough to compute lambda of gamma to consider symmetric matrix. This is actually also very important that sometimes you, you are reduced to computing just half of the problem, in a sense.
00:13:45.974 - 00:14:38.294, Speaker A: Okay, so now the inequality, the proof is very easy. Inequality from below is clear because you take a supremum over smaller class of metrics. Inequality above, you do the following. If you had a metric, you reflect it, and then everything is the same. So you take, you can take one half of them. This now is a symmetric metric. And then an easy computation shows that for this guy, this ratio is at least this.
00:14:38.294 - 00:15:33.754, Speaker A: It's the same computation we did in Unix. That's it. These are the rules. And as I promised, we quickly went through the properties of extremal lines. And now let's see whether we can apply this extremely powerful method to back to the conformal maps and eventually to Leonard. So let me actually start with the lemma, which was proven before the method of extremal length was invented. Actually, both this lemon, the next theorem I will state was proven before that using what is called length area method.
00:15:33.754 - 00:16:52.656, Speaker A: So instead of going into the details of it, let me state what it means in terms of extremal length. Again. So this is a very easy observation that of course, extrema length is just bounded below by the following. You take smallest length of the intersection of curves from your family with given set e, take squared, of course, and divide by area of a just by taking characteristic function of a as your extremal math. So what does it tell you? Together with conformal variance? It means that smallest length of an image of an arc or a curve is bounded by extrema length. It doesn't change. Extrema length of the image is the same as extrema length of the curve multiplied by the area of a.
00:16:52.656 - 00:17:35.474, Speaker A: You want intersection with e. So you bound by area of a, and then look here, you need to take one half. So this is lengthy method. So if you want to know this, the length of smallest curve which satisfy something, that's what you do. You just look at the extreme length of your preimage and then you apply this exciting thing. Okay, so the next lemon is due to Julius Wolf. And let me start with very important definition of a crosscut.
00:17:35.474 - 00:18:29.738, Speaker A: So, crosscut for me would be a continuous map from closed unit interval to the closure of the domain omega such that both gamma of zero and gamma of one belong to boundary, and gamma of the interior is inside of one. So the motivational picture here would be the following. So this is a cross cut, or. Well, we'll see a few more examples a bit later. Okay, so the whole point of this discussion here is to convince you that the right way to measure distances in planar domains is not euclidean distance. It's cross cut distance, which is called Carthagin distance. So I will rigorously define it very soon.
00:18:29.738 - 00:19:24.374, Speaker A: But again, to motivate all of this and to show that actually this is the natural metric, I need a couple of theorems. First, one would be, it's even called lemma. Wolf lemma. So suppose that you map, you conformally map disk to I simply connected the minor omega of finite area, which is very important. And suppose that you have two points, z one and z two, which are in the union disk. Then you can find the crosscut in the disk separating them from zero. The length of its image is small.
00:19:24.374 - 00:19:53.914, Speaker A: Well, small is very relative term. Here. Look at this horrible construction. It's some absolute constant multiplied by square root of the area divided by square root of log plus of one over the one minus z two. As usual, log plus of x is maximum of log x and zero. Well, it's horrible estimate. It's not power law in any way, but it has something going for it.
00:19:53.914 - 00:20:33.914, Speaker A: It tends to zero. One, well, one over this tends to zero. So I mean this whole thing tends to zero when the one and the two get close, get close to each other. Now I am not saying that the one and the two are close. They can be very far away. Look, for example, at this picture. This could happen that there is a very short crosscut separating f of the one and f of the two from f of zero.
00:20:33.914 - 00:21:15.342, Speaker A: But in euclidean metric, they extremely far from each other. Again, very short is relative. And this is the bound, which is again horrible, but it's the best possible. So some remarks before I give an easy proof. First is that, well here provide another example of the same phenomenon. Suppose that you have a spiral. So you map to domain, which is a disk with some infinite spiral.
00:21:15.342 - 00:22:01.514, Speaker A: It's infinite around the boundary removed, it's a simply connected domain. Then f of the one and f of the two can be very far away on the spiral on opposite ends at maximum possible distance, almost diameter of the domain. Yet you can always separate them from f of zero, which is somewhere here by a small cross cut. That's what theorem says. This statement not true if your area is equal to infinity, but here likely for us, there is a way to correct it. Instead of normal diameter, you consider spherical diameter or spherical length. And then everything works.
00:22:01.514 - 00:22:47.924, Speaker A: And finally, it's the statement not true for any beta bigger than one half. So not only you cannot hope to replace this horrible log plus but some, by something nice, like power, you can replace one half with any beta which is bigger than one half. And so the examples are against the spirals. So for the spiral, you can actually see that it's what happens. Okay, so now let me prove it. The proof is not terribly complicated. As I said it, a very classical result.
00:22:47.924 - 00:24:03.854, Speaker A: So, first of all, looking at this, we see that by making this constant larger, you just need to consider the case when the one is close to zero. Now, if one of them is less than one half by absolute value, then we can use distortion theorem. Well, zero, if the one is less than one half, the two is less than one half plus 110, right? So we have that f of the one minus f of the two is bounded by some constant, some universal constant times the derivative at zero, times the one minus zero. And now remember that bicycle, one quarter theorem, f of f of d rather. So this is omega. It contains ball centered at f of zero, of radius one four, f prime of zero. So this thing is bounded by four constant of times area of omega to the one half.
00:24:03.854 - 00:24:31.654, Speaker A: I'll divide it by PI, because again, area of the disk of this, it's probably not four, it's probably 16. Let me be more precise. I know there is a square root. So it's four. Sorry, it is indeed four. Anyway, it doesn't matter because just a constant. So this was an easy situation.
00:24:31.654 - 00:25:39.194, Speaker A: So here you have a much better bound. Here the map is Lipschitz. Things start going south, of course, when you approach the boundary. And what we do here, we consider curves in the annulus, which is centered at z one, with inner radius z one minus z two and outer radius one half. You take this curve separating z one and z two from zero. And by our previous discussion with three more lengths, you'll see that actually you can only consider circle arcs separating them, centered as the one which separates the one and the two from zero. By extension rule, extremal length of this is bounded by extremal length of this in the whole.
00:25:39.194 - 00:26:36.268, Speaker A: So remember, this analysis is intersection with unidisc. So it could be small, but it's okay, because we are, we want to estimate extreme length above. And so that's what it would be here. I don't need to write log plus, because we know that d one minus d two is small. This is already positive. And now here is the kicker. By this length area observation, we can find beta, which is in the image of gamma, such that the length of beta is bounded by extremal length times area of the image of this analysis to the power one half.
00:26:36.268 - 00:27:53.960, Speaker A: So this is just this length area observation, that's all. And well, this is exactly the bound of the type that we want. And we are done. Okay, so again, the idea here, let me magnify the picture. You considered these curves, you considered curves which separated z one and z two from zero. In the inside this little annals, you looked at the extremal length of them. And because the extremal length is small, well, not that small, but it's smallish, it was enough to estimate that one of the curves in the image, again, we don't know that the one is close to the two, but one of the curves in the image would be short, would have length bounded by precisely this.
00:27:53.960 - 00:29:17.414, Speaker A: And turns out that this is again precise instrument. And remark which can be useful is that beta can be not a circular, but an image, this image of a circle arc. Okay, so this easy theorem showed us that if two points are close in the disk, maybe very close to the boundary, the images would be separated by a cross country. What about other directions? Suppose that two points can be separated by a small crosscut. Images of two points can be separated from zero image of zero by a small crosscut. Is it true that the points themselves were close? The answer is yes. And this aetherium, which is due to lavrientief.
00:29:17.414 - 00:30:05.120, Speaker A: And let me first state it in the terms such that it wouldn't be clear that we are providing a low estimate on something. But then we'll see why it's important, why it's exactly what I just stated. So suppose that we have an arc on the unit circle. So this is our archive. And the I would be center of the arc of orthogonal circle twice. So you just draw this orthogonal circle and then put the I here. And suppose that bit is any crosscut in the unit disk with ends at the ends of I.
00:30:05.120 - 00:31:27.800, Speaker A: So let me draw such a cross cut, so something like this, then image of it cannot have a small diameter. So first of all, I don't know if it has a length. That's why I have to write diameter, because it could happen that the, the image is simply not a rectifiable curve. Well, it is, sorry, it is rectifiable, but it's not finite length, but diameter of the image is at least length of the side multiplied by the derivative at the I. Okay, so it says that if you have a crosscut with ends which are relatively far away on the unit circle, then its image would have a huge dime bounded below. Well, there is a pesky thing f prime of the eye, which doesnt look like universal bound. Let me state why it is.
00:31:27.800 - 00:32:24.114, Speaker A: First of all, in a moment, well, at least today, you'll see that f can be extended to the boundary in certain sense. Then what this theorem says that the diameter of the image of this arc is at least length of phi multiplied by the derivative at the I. Well, that's very easy. You just draw cross cuts closer and closer. All of them have larger diameters. So diameter of the image is at least constant length of I derivative. And now, corollary two is probably the most important one.
00:32:24.114 - 00:33:37.604, Speaker A: Well, it's often called Berlin. Well, the picture of Berlin will definitely appear later in the course. But again, it's just a corollary of theorem of laboriente, which appeared about ten years before it appeared in Berlin stock. And so that the estimate is that diameter of image of such crosscut, which joins two ends of an arc, is at least square of the arc length multiplied by the derivative of the, just a normalizing factor. Okay, so that's, now, this looks like a universal estimate. This shows that crosscut which lands on far away points, cannot have a short branch, cannot have a short image. So in some sense, which will quantify in a moment.
00:33:37.604 - 00:34:21.284, Speaker A: Amazing thing happens. The inverse map from the domain to the disk is one half helder. So, and it's up to the boundary. So that's the reason for all this rich theory of boundary behavior that we have. Now, the proof of this corollary from theorem of laborientive is very easy. We just need to estimate below f prime of the I, and we just do it first for f and s. So that's why we have estimates.
00:34:21.284 - 00:35:07.173, Speaker A: So f prime of the I is bounded below by distortion theorem by one minus absolute value of z. One plus zi cubed, which is just bigger than length of I overweight. You just plug it in here, and you get your result for fns. And now normalize. The usual way we do it. We just divide by f prime of zero. We get a function s, we get the estimate on the diameter, we need to multiply back by f prime of zero.
00:35:07.173 - 00:35:39.542, Speaker A: So we get back. Okay, so this is the theorem of Lavrentiev. Original proof of Lavrentiev was locked. The proof that I will give, of course, relies on extreme length, so it will not be that long. Well, okay, so let's look at this. First, we normalize, we divide by f prime of zero. Assume that f is an x.
00:35:39.542 - 00:36:38.144, Speaker A: Everything scales. We also can pre compose with milders. So we just consider map upper half circle to I. Sorry. And then again, it's very easy to see that everything scales because derivative is multiplied by tau prime at zero, which would exactly give you f prime of zi. And diameter actually doesn't change. So this product stays the same when you just pre compose this mobius map.
00:36:38.144 - 00:38:00.960, Speaker A: So now we just have to prove the statement that if you have a cross cut and it's blue here, this blueish thing here, which joins two ends of upper half circle. Since this product again is controlled, all we need to prove is this is just absolute constant, because again, we are now in plus s. So if prime of zero is zero, zi for upper half circle is equal to zero. And so we just need to prove that diameter image of any such crosscut cannot be too small. So again, the scaling here just appears from this mirror snap. And to prove this, we consider this half disk and we look at two cases. Case number one is that beta is not like it is here.
00:38:00.960 - 00:38:58.656, Speaker A: It's not like on this picture, it actually intersects this inner disk. Then there is a point z, which is in this intersection. Okay? So the diameter f of bit is of course, at least distance from this f of z to the boundary of omega. Again, so there was this point here, there was this point here in the intersection. And of course, you go back and forth, so you have to go to the boundary somewhere. So this at least distance from f of z to boundary of omega. And then, well, this is bounded below by curb one quarter theorem by this construct.
00:38:58.656 - 00:39:47.816, Speaker A: So one half times one eight times the derivative. Well, since absolute value of z is less equal than one half, this would be at least one over 128. So this case is easy. So we use distortion theorems we used for the one quota. So nothing exciting happened. Interesting things start happening exactly in the case when we just pictured that beta doesn't intersect, that in this case we just consider family of all curves in the sandworms, d minus delta. So this is analysis.
00:39:47.816 - 00:40:34.734, Speaker A: Outer radius one half, inner radius one, which are not all the curves going from inner circle to outer circle, this occurs going from inner circle from t plus lambda of gamma. Well, it's a finite constant. Why is it a finite constant? Say by extension rule, you just can compare it with this and reflect. So lambda of gamma is finite. This is very important. Okay, but now let's see what happens. So let's look at the f of gamma.
00:40:34.734 - 00:41:26.144, Speaker A: So suppose the diameter of f of beta is really, really small. We can put f of beta inside the disk of radius r1. R1 is the diameter of this f of beta. And let's draw two reals. So disk of radius, two reals centered at the same point w and two would be distance from f of beta to f of delta minus diameter of f of beta. So we are trying to make sure that this whole analysis between f one and two reals does not touch f of that at all. So they don't know about each other.
00:41:26.144 - 00:42:46.624, Speaker A: Okay, so this is bounded by distance from d omega to f of delta minus twice, diameter of f of beta. Remember f of beta, maybe it has, maybe it's not ending at any point of the boundary, but at least it should have points which approach the boundary because so was beta. So when we compare this to this, we lose yet another diameter from beta. And by kerbia, by the same kerbia we used in case one, this distance is bounded by one over 128. So this is one over 128 minus two or r1 at least. Now observe that any gamma in f of gamma in f of this family intersects both this disk and this disk. Because wallet has to go from boundary which is inside this.
00:42:46.624 - 00:43:50.154, Speaker A: Because again, each curve in gamma intersected beta. So it should go from, each curve should contain something which goes from beta to delta. So take the image, it should go from f of beta to f of delta intersects two sides. So extreme length of f of gamma, by extension row, is at least extreme length of this guy of the curves which go from here to here, which is, we already computed log two reals over r1 PI. This is, we use this estimate. So this is at least log of one over 28 r one minus one. And this, this of course is much bigger than lambda of gamma, provided that r1 is small enough.
00:43:50.154 - 00:44:37.094, Speaker A: Remember, lambda of gamma is a constant. If this r1 is small, this would be bigger. But this is contradiction because of course this is equal to this. That's it. Okay, so, okay, so just take away from this proof normalization. So all this reason why we have this factor here, because this is a factor which is invariant. And this much, if you map one arc to another, this product would stay the same.
00:44:37.094 - 00:45:45.674, Speaker A: Okay, now let me refine it slightly. And I would be able to define a very important metric. Carthage. So I claim that for some absolute constant, you have a crosscut which separates f of z one and f of z two from zero. Then diameter of this crosscut should be at least the one minus the two square. So this is almost the same result as what I just stated. But there is a slight, slight nuance here that now we just consider any points z one and z two inside the disk or maybe on the battery.
00:45:45.674 - 00:46:13.804, Speaker A: So this just easily follows from what we just proved, plus some distortion theorem. So skip. And so just remark here, maybe I was not precise. Gamma can be the crosscut or it can be closed curve. So it can be. Let me draw a picture. So this is our domain.
00:46:13.804 - 00:46:56.184, Speaker A: This is my f of z one. This is my f of z two. And sometimes on the end, very important value is f of zero, f of zero. So sometimes the shortest thing which separates them from zero would be cross cut, but sometimes it could be just six. And so here's a definition. Now, a completely geometric definition of a metric in a domain, omega. It can be defined in any domain, not necessarily interconnected.
00:46:56.184 - 00:48:32.324, Speaker A: Suppose that you fix a point in the domain, and then you define distance between two points which are not w naught, as in freemium of diameter of gamma, which gamma is a cure for cross cut, which separates w one and w two. W one, w two from w naught. You can extend it to w naught by continuity, not too exciting. And the theorem which we essentially already proved is that in this metric, in this intrinsic metric of simply connected domain, your map f on one side it has this continuity bound, but inverse to it is one half further. So again, this is by Wolf, there is a crosscut which would separate them of this length. And on the other hand, by Lavrentiv theorem, it cannot be too small by refinement of laboratory that I stated. So this is the right way to think about distance in simply connected domains.
00:48:32.324 - 00:49:19.484, Speaker A: The scarify dorimetric. Sometimes it's called Mazurkavich metric. But let me stick with Carthage, who invented. Why is it important to us? Let's return to the realm of lightest models. Remember that we were saying that, well, we consider lightest approximation of the domain, and then we select a point closest to some point on the boundary that was important for interface. And all of this in what sense it is closed in the sense of cross adoring, because we want a conformally environed definition. So we definitely want to consider the right matrix.
00:49:19.484 - 00:50:00.774, Speaker A: So let me draw you an example where it can make a difference. So this is your point a, you want to approximate it by lightest domain. So this is your lightest domain. And what should be. So this is Omega Delta. And what should be a delta, what should be the point closest to delta? If you take closest in euclidean metric, that's wrong. You need the point closest in crossed.
00:50:00.774 - 00:50:38.054, Speaker A: And this is, this would be this point physically, in Euclidean metric, it's very far. But in this crassadoi metric, it's very close because there is this very short crosscut which separates a delta and a from this fixed point. Okay, so now all this picture can be extended to the boundary. And let me start next hour with talking about this extension theory of primats. So let us go for a break for now.
