00:00:16.120 - 00:00:40.136, Speaker A: Well, there is two or three more results to finish this section about general multipliers, and then we switch to study more specific ones. Here is one of them. I mean, it's written as a corollary here, but I prefer to call it.
00:00:40.160 - 00:00:41.244, Speaker B: A proposition.
00:00:45.464 - 00:00:50.352, Speaker A: Or even a theorem as before.
00:00:50.448 - 00:01:08.434, Speaker B: H one and h two rkhs, two rkhs on x with we don't need kernels here. But anyhow, I write it with kernels k one and k two.
00:01:10.694 - 00:01:17.994, Speaker A: And let f be a multiplier.
00:01:21.094 - 00:01:24.274, Speaker B: From h one to h two.
00:01:25.174 - 00:01:26.154, Speaker A: And then.
00:01:28.614 - 00:01:34.114, Speaker B: This, we have this beautiful property, unimportant indeed. Then.
00:01:38.214 - 00:02:04.414, Speaker A: Mof star, that joint acting on ky two two here means the kernel for the second space. So this acting m star acting on this gives us the kernel in the first space, of course, with a constant f y bar.
00:02:09.314 - 00:02:15.964, Speaker B: And this is true for any y in this space, the settings.
00:02:22.744 - 00:02:28.184, Speaker A: In particular, and that's the particular case that we.
00:02:28.224 - 00:02:30.044, Speaker B: Usually use.
00:02:33.664 - 00:02:38.400, Speaker A: When the two space coincide.
00:02:38.472 - 00:02:47.234, Speaker B: I mean h one equal to h two, going to say h and k one k two k.
00:02:50.374 - 00:02:55.102, Speaker A: Then every kernel.
00:02:55.158 - 00:02:55.954, Speaker B: Function.
00:03:04.054 - 00:03:05.554, Speaker A: Is an eigenvalue.
00:03:09.004 - 00:03:19.744, Speaker B: Eigenfunction, sorry, eigenfunction of mf star.
00:03:21.524 - 00:03:25.564, Speaker A: With well eigenvalue.
00:03:25.604 - 00:03:47.804, Speaker B: I will write more explicitly here. Mf star acting on ky gives us back ky with eigenvalue fy.
00:03:54.864 - 00:03:59.056, Speaker A: And we will see a consequence of this momentarily.
00:03:59.200 - 00:04:01.656, Speaker B: But first, let's, let's prove it.
00:04:01.680 - 00:04:10.032, Speaker A: The proof is very straightforward. It's not difficult for any age.
00:04:10.088 - 00:04:12.884, Speaker B: In the first space age one.
00:04:17.704 - 00:04:21.776, Speaker A: What can we say about when?
00:04:21.840 - 00:04:32.500, Speaker B: Let's start with f o y. I.
00:04:32.532 - 00:04:45.464, Speaker A: Calculate it into two maze two methods. First. Well, it's f of y, and h is.
00:04:47.524 - 00:04:53.674, Speaker B: H scalar product ky one in this space h one.
00:04:56.694 - 00:05:31.184, Speaker A: And I can take this inside. That's one way. The other way is to write it as fh evaluated at point y, or the same thing as m of f h.
00:05:34.644 - 00:05:36.904, Speaker B: Evaluated at point y.
00:05:37.364 - 00:06:04.990, Speaker A: And note that mfh is in the second space. Evaluation at point y is equal, equivalent to inner product of this function with the kernel, but the kernel in the second space. And now I take mf as an operator to the other side.
00:06:05.142 - 00:06:16.064, Speaker B: So this becomes h mf star ky two nh one.
00:06:16.604 - 00:06:20.824, Speaker A: And now compare, compare this one.
00:06:24.644 - 00:06:25.864, Speaker B: With this one.
00:06:28.764 - 00:06:32.024, Speaker A: For any age these two are equal.
00:06:35.824 - 00:06:51.524, Speaker B: So for any h and for any y, well, y is fixed. I don't need to mention that.
00:06:56.224 - 00:06:56.964, Speaker A: H.
00:06:57.824 - 00:07:09.064, Speaker B: F y bar ky one in h one is equal to h mf ky two.
00:07:12.244 - 00:07:22.864, Speaker A: Immediately we obtain what we were looking for. Mf acting on ky two gives us.
00:07:23.524 - 00:07:28.894, Speaker B: Ky one with scalar fiber.
00:07:30.034 - 00:07:35.934, Speaker A: So that's the end of the proof. I go back to the special case.
00:07:36.434 - 00:07:46.294, Speaker B: That we saw about h. One is equal to h, two equal to h.
00:07:47.034 - 00:07:52.186, Speaker A: In this case, we saw that mf.
00:07:52.250 - 00:08:00.594, Speaker B: Star ky is equal to f y bar ky.
00:08:04.654 - 00:08:13.190, Speaker A: And if we take the norm of the both sides, I start from the right side. So it gives us absolute value of.
00:08:13.222 - 00:08:16.222, Speaker B: F of y times the norm of.
00:08:16.318 - 00:08:20.702, Speaker A: Koi is equal to the norm of.
00:08:20.798 - 00:08:24.304, Speaker B: Mf star ky.
00:08:26.764 - 00:08:27.948, Speaker A: Less than or equal.
00:08:27.996 - 00:08:35.184, Speaker B: To the normal mf star norm of ky.
00:08:37.244 - 00:08:47.164, Speaker A: So if y is such that ky, its norm or itself is not equal to zero, it's the same thing.
00:08:47.204 - 00:08:47.984, Speaker B: Indeed.
00:08:48.784 - 00:09:08.804, Speaker A: Then we conclude that f of y is majorized. And let me add one more thing. The norm of t star is equal to the norm of t. This is majorized by the norm of f.
00:09:10.504 - 00:09:10.792, Speaker B: And.
00:09:10.808 - 00:09:27.244, Speaker A: This is also true if k of y is equal to zero, because in this case, f of y is zero. So, but let me.
00:09:30.224 - 00:09:31.000, Speaker B: Write it the.
00:09:31.032 - 00:09:36.064, Speaker A: Way it's written in the book.
00:09:36.104 - 00:09:37.496, Speaker B: It's written just this part.
00:09:37.560 - 00:09:50.294, Speaker A: But if ko y is in many function spaces, the multiplier is a subset of the space, because the constant functions.
00:09:50.374 - 00:09:51.534, Speaker B: Are in this space.
00:09:51.694 - 00:10:02.598, Speaker A: And in that case, if ko y is zero, f of y is zero, and this is automatically true. But let's stay with the kind of.
00:10:02.646 - 00:10:07.074, Speaker B: General setting and not assume that the constant is there.
00:10:08.454 - 00:10:19.420, Speaker A: So here is the conclusion. F is majorized by a constant.
00:10:19.532 - 00:10:20.184, Speaker B: Mo.
00:10:25.844 - 00:10:49.310, Speaker A: I hesitate to write it in this way, even though it's written in this book and in many other places, because when I rewrite nor infinity, usually a measure is involved. But here it's for all y. So we don't need to think about the measure. Instead of this, I prefer to write.
00:10:49.382 - 00:10:54.686, Speaker B: For all y in the space x. F of y is less than or.
00:10:54.710 - 00:11:36.284, Speaker A: Equal to the normal f. And again, why I write for all y? Because the spaces we consider like Hardy, Dirichlet, Bergman, and this is always the case, k of y is not equal to zero. So, conclusion is that a multiplier is a bounded function. But the converse is not true. And we will see, that's the topic of when the concluding topic of a course. Uh, one more observation, sir.
00:11:36.744 - 00:11:37.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:38.624 - 00:11:46.804, Speaker C: It proved that if k of y is not zero for all y, then f will be bounded.
00:11:47.184 - 00:11:47.964, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:50.544 - 00:11:55.484, Speaker C: As I ask you in this way, that if the kernel function is continuous.
00:11:55.784 - 00:11:56.632, Speaker A: Yes.
00:11:56.808 - 00:12:02.054, Speaker C: Can we say something about the multiplier? Will they become continuous?
00:12:06.714 - 00:12:09.914, Speaker B: If the kernel function is continuous, can.
00:12:09.954 - 00:12:14.574, Speaker C: We see the multiply continuous functions and exceed your topological space.
00:12:18.554 - 00:12:42.004, Speaker A: They, in this. I haven't seen this theorem in the book, but it has to be true. I tell you why. You remember we had a theorem, I mean, kind of at the beginning, just before Moore's theorem, that if the kernel is continuous, then every element of the space is also continuous.
00:12:42.464 - 00:12:43.244, Speaker C: Yes.
00:12:44.104 - 00:13:33.046, Speaker A: So if you have such a kernel, and then you multiply, say, f by kx, this has to be continuous. The product is continuous, because in this space, and this element also by itself is continuous. The only problem is that, is it equal to zero or not? And as I said, the same difficulty I had here, in most spaces that we consider, k of y is not zero. And that is why we can say that, yes, the kernel is because we can even locally divide by kx and.
00:13:33.070 - 00:13:34.834, Speaker B: Say that f is continuous.
00:13:38.814 - 00:14:32.432, Speaker A: However, if your space is such that at a point x zero, k, x zero is equal to zero, then you cannot say so why? Because consider any multiplier. So pick any multiplier, say f, and then define g to be equal to f of x. If x not equal to x zero, and at point x, zero, whatever you wish, you have absolute freedom. Here. It really doesn't matter. G is still a multiplier. Because.
00:14:32.432 - 00:15:03.704, Speaker A: Because for any h in this space, h, h at point x, zero is equal to zero. And therefore g, h is the same as fh. This is for all x. If x is not equal to zero, they are the same. And if x is equal to x zero, then this is zero. So still identity holds. So this means that g is also a multiplier.
00:15:03.704 - 00:15:31.370, Speaker A: But you have absolutely freedom here in the definition of G at point x zero, you can, you can define it such that g is not continuous. So the only obstacle is kind of artificial case. If.
00:15:31.482 - 00:15:37.810, Speaker C: But if kernel is such that ky is not zero for all y, then.
00:15:37.842 - 00:15:46.850, Speaker A: Then it is continuous. Yeah, for sure. And unbounded. Continuous and bounded.
00:15:46.882 - 00:15:47.258, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:47.346 - 00:16:20.364, Speaker A: I mean, I just, because I explained here, because the product is continuous, it's an element of the space, and kx by itself is continuous, non zero. You do, you do the division. True. So you obtain something continuous. So it's a consequence of the theorem that we had before, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the book.
00:16:21.564 - 00:16:53.164, Speaker D: Can I suggest another proof of that inequality? Absolute value of f of y is less than or equal to the normal multiplication by f. That one there at the bottom there. Yes. Okay, let's assume ky is not zero, which means there's some function in the reproducing colonel Hilbert space that's not zero at that point. Look at the operator of multiplication fixed y. Look at the operator of multiplication by f minus f of y.
00:16:53.624 - 00:16:54.544, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:54.704 - 00:17:01.724, Speaker D: That operator is not surjective because every function in the range is zero at y.
00:17:02.064 - 00:17:02.844, Speaker B: True.
00:17:03.704 - 00:17:15.942, Speaker D: Therefore, f of y is in the spectrum of multiplication by f, and therefore, every element of the spectrum has absolute value less than the norm.
00:17:16.128 - 00:17:16.754, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:16.874 - 00:17:19.334, Speaker D: So you don't need to go through the adjoint that way.
00:17:19.794 - 00:17:23.090, Speaker A: That's true. Very beautiful indeed. I mean, thank you.
00:17:23.122 - 00:17:24.282, Speaker B: Thank you, Sheldon.
00:17:24.458 - 00:18:06.894, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very nice observation, which, I mean, I didn't notice before. Thanks a lot. The last item in this section is is about brazen transform, which indeed, I mean, I don't know if. Sheldon, you have the nice paper you wrote many years ago about brazen transform and its application. If you have, you may share. But, I mean, the thing I do here is very elementary. Just definition and one property.
00:18:11.134 - 00:18:14.074, Speaker D: I'll look for it, see if I can find the electronic copy.
00:18:14.454 - 00:18:27.302, Speaker A: It was free on Internet. Okay. Yeah. So here is. Here is a definition. I mean, as about H is an.
00:18:27.438 - 00:18:28.794, Speaker B: Rkhs.
00:18:31.214 - 00:18:47.528, Speaker A: With kernel k, and t is a bounded operator on H. B of H. The brazen transform Bt at point.
00:18:47.616 - 00:18:56.464, Speaker B: Y is defined to be tky inner.
00:18:56.504 - 00:19:26.034, Speaker A: Product Kyle, and normalized. And, of course, we have the same difficulty as before. We have assumed that ky is not equal to zero. So it's defined at the point that Ky is not zero. And this is called the present. The motivation for this, the way explained here in the book, is that if you have a multiplier f.
00:19:30.334 - 00:19:31.074, Speaker B: Then.
00:19:33.814 - 00:19:36.514, Speaker A: What can you say about mf?
00:19:37.894 - 00:19:48.874, Speaker B: Ky, ky? Well, as we did about, we can.
00:19:51.554 - 00:19:53.282, Speaker A: Transfer it to the other side to.
00:19:53.298 - 00:20:35.414, Speaker B: Obtain that joint, and then this becomes f. This means that. I'm already tired. This is not a good sign. Ky ky. Here, ky, this is f of y bar ky, and f of y comes out, and ky inner product ky stays.
00:20:35.454 - 00:20:41.830, Speaker A: And if we divide both sides by this, assuming, again it's not zero, we.
00:20:41.862 - 00:20:51.524, Speaker B: Obtain mf ky ky divided by Kyky.
00:20:52.584 - 00:21:00.764, Speaker A: Is f of y is a method to calculate the multiplier using this combination.
00:21:02.704 - 00:21:04.232, Speaker B: Using this combination.
00:21:04.408 - 00:21:10.614, Speaker A: And this is precisely the brazing transform of the operator mf.
00:21:10.784 - 00:21:15.374, Speaker B: This is bmf at point y.
00:21:17.714 - 00:21:25.874, Speaker A: The way. The way we define that, that's the motivation for the definition and the simple property. I mean, there are many, many interesting properties.
00:21:25.954 - 00:21:28.626, Speaker B: And if Sheldon succeeds to find his.
00:21:28.650 - 00:22:20.146, Speaker A: Own paper, you will see many interesting results in that paper, too. The one I want to show here is the fact that the multiplier algebra is closed under a specific topology on B of H, we have at least three topologies. The first one is the norm topology and the second one is, it's called strong operator topology. And I explain it this way. Tn converges to Tsot. That's the definition. If and only if for every element.
00:22:20.210 - 00:22:21.334, Speaker B: Of this space.
00:22:23.154 - 00:22:32.296, Speaker A: H t n of goes to Tof and the last one is weak operator topology.
00:22:32.400 - 00:22:34.364, Speaker B: This is our hero here.
00:22:34.704 - 00:22:43.128, Speaker A: And in this case tn goes to t, weak operator topology. If for every f and g in.
00:22:43.176 - 00:22:43.764, Speaker B: H.
00:22:45.864 - 00:22:49.088, Speaker A: T n f scalar product with.
00:22:49.136 - 00:22:54.404, Speaker B: G converges to tf and g.
00:22:57.804 - 00:23:23.300, Speaker A: I mean the name explained. The norm topology is the strongest one, and then in the middle we have sot and the weakest one is the weak operator topology. The good thing about weak operator topology is that I leave it as an exercise for you. It's a very simple exercise that if tn goes to t vica operator topology.
00:23:23.412 - 00:23:40.920, Speaker B: Then the adjoint does the same. I mean, just take tn to the other side. This is very trivial, I mean, simple.
00:23:40.952 - 00:23:44.124, Speaker A: To prove, and I will use it.
00:23:44.784 - 00:24:03.624, Speaker B: Even in the theorem. So, mentioning that theorem.
00:24:05.724 - 00:24:06.700, Speaker A: Last theorem of.
00:24:06.732 - 00:24:19.324, Speaker B: This section for the book age is an Rkhs on X.
00:24:20.864 - 00:24:21.604, Speaker A: Then.
00:24:26.064 - 00:24:30.084, Speaker B: Malt H.
00:24:32.024 - 00:25:18.294, Speaker A: Set of all operators we need to be. Ah, that's not a good notation. This is precisely the thing I wanted to say. Don't fall into this mistake. Malt H is used for the function, so it's not a good notation here. The Mf is the set of operators Mf, the set of operators such that f is in voltage. This is a unital subalgebra.
00:25:22.474 - 00:25:23.890, Speaker B: Of B.
00:25:23.922 - 00:25:32.138, Speaker A: Of H. Up to here it's, we already know that new part that is.
00:25:32.186 - 00:25:33.174, Speaker B: Closed.
00:25:36.454 - 00:25:37.394, Speaker A: In the.
00:25:39.534 - 00:25:41.554, Speaker B: Weak operator topology.
00:25:42.854 - 00:25:56.794, Speaker A: That's the new part of it. So two ingredients, unital sub algebra, we know that, but the closeness in the.
00:25:57.294 - 00:26:02.154, Speaker B: WT, this is what we want to do.
00:26:08.364 - 00:26:27.828, Speaker A: Well, the way we do it, to show the closeness, we can see the mf lambda, not necessarily a sequence, it's a net.
00:26:27.916 - 00:26:31.984, Speaker B: Generally speaking, it's a net of multipliers.
00:26:42.064 - 00:27:17.228, Speaker A: And we assume that these net of multipliers m f lambda converges in weak operator topology to t, which is a bounded operator on H. And our goal is to show that t is also of the form, say mf, where f.
00:27:17.316 - 00:27:21.052, Speaker B: Is in malt of h. This is.
00:27:21.148 - 00:27:59.034, Speaker A: What we want to show. So we need a candidate for f. But the candidate can be seen here in the motivation in the definition of B. When we do the brazen transform of the multiplier, we obtain f of y. So if we apply these two f lambda for sure. We know that.
00:28:03.094 - 00:28:04.554, Speaker B: So we know that.
00:28:11.094 - 00:28:19.174, Speaker A: Brazen transform of the operator f m f lambda. It's a horrible notation, but I'm sorry for that.
00:28:19.214 - 00:28:20.594, Speaker B: We have to live with this.
00:28:22.394 - 00:28:56.434, Speaker A: We know that this is f lambda at. .1 and, well, based on the convergence, a good candidate. We define f at point lambda to be the limit over lambda. F lambda y whenever the limit exists. We don't know yet, but we will see where it exists.
00:29:02.094 - 00:29:31.094, Speaker B: And let me see for a moment. Yeah, when. Let me erase this.
00:29:31.514 - 00:29:35.294, Speaker A: It's a part of the proof that we show that this limit.
00:29:35.594 - 00:29:36.494, Speaker B: We show.
00:29:39.854 - 00:29:59.114, Speaker A: This exists, and this goes to bt. So our definition is like this fy. We define to be the present transform of t at point y whenever.
00:30:02.694 - 00:30:03.958, Speaker B: Kyle.
00:30:03.996 - 00:30:24.522, Speaker A: Is not equal to zero, and zero if is equal to zero, then let's. Let's see what we can say about f of y. And if we can show that f is a multiple. Now, the goal.
00:30:24.618 - 00:30:33.194, Speaker B: The goal is to show that f is a multiplier.
00:30:37.134 - 00:30:52.554, Speaker A: But here, the way we do it for any x and y in x t applied on x is a function. We evaluate this function at point y.
00:30:54.454 - 00:31:01.834, Speaker B: Well, it's tkx inner product with ky.
00:31:03.294 - 00:31:04.034, Speaker A: And.
00:31:06.214 - 00:31:10.114, Speaker B: Taking a joint t star ky.
00:31:10.774 - 00:31:22.604, Speaker A: We saw about that. If a net converges weak star operator topology, then the same is for the join. So this is equal to.
00:31:24.744 - 00:31:39.964, Speaker B: The limb over lambda k lambda kx. And here mf lambda star ky.
00:31:41.424 - 00:31:52.864, Speaker A: This is by assumption. And now we use the fact that my previous result.
00:31:55.124 - 00:32:07.224, Speaker B: That this is an eigenfunction. So it's f lambda y bar ky.
00:32:08.364 - 00:32:09.744, Speaker A: And we can take.
00:32:12.764 - 00:32:33.464, Speaker B: F lambda y kx ky limb over lambda f lambda y kx at point y.
00:32:37.364 - 00:32:45.480, Speaker A: So, as we see that if kx is not equal to zero, this also.
00:32:45.552 - 00:32:59.484, Speaker B: Implies that the limb over lambda f lambda y exists. Let's see what is in the chat. Oh, it gives the paper. Thank you, Sheldon.
00:33:07.124 - 00:33:21.744, Speaker A: And also, I mean, compare t x on kx evaluated at. .1.
00:33:25.284 - 00:33:30.836, Speaker B: T kx evaluated at point y.
00:33:30.900 - 00:33:34.394, Speaker A: Is equal to f. That was the.
00:33:34.434 - 00:33:38.174, Speaker B: Definition acting on kx at point y.
00:33:39.754 - 00:33:49.690, Speaker A: Another way to write this is true for any y. The same thing to write this identity is that t kx is equal to.
00:33:49.762 - 00:33:53.374, Speaker B: F times f kx.
00:33:53.834 - 00:33:58.854, Speaker A: That's almost the definition and almost.
00:34:00.894 - 00:34:06.754, Speaker B: The definition of a multiplier.
00:34:10.454 - 00:34:27.354, Speaker A: Almost, because not every function is there. We just have the kernel functions. For kernel functions, f acts as a multiplier. But now we use the fact that t is a bounded operator for any.
00:34:29.494 - 00:34:35.462, Speaker B: For any h in this space, h.
00:34:35.518 - 00:34:41.234, Speaker A: One there is a linear combination of these multipliers which are close to f.
00:34:42.654 - 00:34:58.014, Speaker B: There is, I mean, we can call it hn. It is hn which is in the span of kx in x.
00:35:00.394 - 00:35:03.074, Speaker A: Such that they are close.
00:35:03.154 - 00:35:05.802, Speaker B: I mean, norm of h minus h.
00:35:05.858 - 00:35:07.658, Speaker A: N is as small as you wish.
00:35:07.706 - 00:35:09.934, Speaker B: For example, less than one over n.
00:35:11.834 - 00:35:20.912, Speaker A: And since this is in span, we know that t hn is equal to.
00:35:20.968 - 00:35:23.764, Speaker B: F h n because of this.
00:35:25.424 - 00:35:27.304, Speaker A: And now, what can we say about.
00:35:27.384 - 00:35:37.604, Speaker B: Th th f h? That's the, the usual trick that we do in analysis.
00:35:43.384 - 00:35:44.848, Speaker A: Is equal to th.
00:35:44.976 - 00:36:08.264, Speaker B: Minus thn plus thn minus f h n plus fhn minus fh.
00:36:10.284 - 00:36:17.952, Speaker A: And now take the absolute value. And here we use this is equal to zero. This part here we use the fact.
00:36:18.008 - 00:36:19.764, Speaker B: That t is bounded.
00:36:22.224 - 00:36:24.264, Speaker A: And the last one is also small.
00:36:24.384 - 00:36:25.844, Speaker B: Thanks to this one.
00:36:26.504 - 00:36:27.644, Speaker A: And therefore.
00:36:29.424 - 00:36:32.832, Speaker B: We conclude that th minus.
00:36:32.928 - 00:36:49.046, Speaker A: Fh, indeed it's independent of n is. We can say that this goes to zero or eventually is equal to zero. It's a limiting process, which means that.
00:36:49.150 - 00:36:51.034, Speaker B: F is a multiplier.
00:36:56.694 - 00:36:57.434, Speaker A: Or.
00:37:00.534 - 00:37:17.494, Speaker B: T is equal to mf. And we are done. I was a bit not so exact here, but you understand what I mean, that that's the usual truth that we do. Trick we do in analysis.
00:37:23.114 - 00:37:57.814, Speaker A: Nothing more. In this last section. And this finishes the chapter, chapter five. After the break, I want to talk a little bit about the special cases like hardy spaces and more about Dirichlet spaces, what we know about the multipliers of Dirichlet species. And that finishes our course. But before the break, Sheldon, do you want to talk a little bit about those two papers?
00:37:58.114 - 00:39:01.044, Speaker D: I put two papers in the chat box about the Bursin transformation. These focus on the Bursin transform, on the Bergman space are one of our key examples of a reproducing Colonel Hilbert space. And the idea is that if you have an operator such that t of the whose Bursin transform goes to zero at the boundary, then you want to know whether that's equivalent to being compact or not. So one direction is easy that if it is, if the operator is compact, then going the Bursin transform, going to zero at the boundary is true. But the converse is not true for all operators. So this shows that it is true, though, for nice operators, it's true for. For anything in the norm closed algebra generated by the tuplets operators.
00:39:01.044 - 00:39:06.724, Speaker D: So you really see how useful the Beresen transform can be by looking at that.
00:39:07.864 - 00:39:18.176, Speaker A: Okay, thanks a lot. I look at the one about the brazilian transformer on the Bergman space before.
00:39:18.320 - 00:39:21.056, Speaker B: I mean, even quite recently on that.
00:39:21.240 - 00:39:24.388, Speaker A: Very interesting article and thank you for sharing them.
00:39:24.516 - 00:39:25.384, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:39:28.564 - 00:39:31.084, Speaker A: I just before the break, I mean.
00:39:31.164 - 00:39:38.104, Speaker B: Let me see if I can go a little bit up here. Well, doesn't work.
00:39:42.604 - 00:40:24.444, Speaker A: The here the way in the book is explained. I mean I wrote it like this and I mean just out of my mind. But the way it's, it's written in the book, it's by evaluation, I mean evaluated th at point y and did the limiting process based on hn to show that it's equal to f of Y h. And so the same conclusion, this is more straightforward which is explained in the book, but I believe this.
00:40:24.484 - 00:40:26.556, Speaker B: One can be made precise too.
00:40:26.580 - 00:40:28.476, Speaker A: But I mean, let's do it the.
00:40:28.500 - 00:40:30.064, Speaker B: Way the book is done.
00:40:32.004 - 00:40:43.614, Speaker A: So well, this finishes this part and we have another break and we come back to talk more about the richly spaces it.
