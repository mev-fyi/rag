00:00:53.134 - 00:00:53.674, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:54.374 - 00:00:55.154, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:55.494 - 00:00:57.462, Speaker A: Okay, so you can hear me, right?
00:00:57.638 - 00:00:58.574, Speaker B: Yes, you can.
00:00:58.654 - 00:00:59.794, Speaker A: Okay. Finally.
00:01:00.454 - 00:01:03.094, Speaker C: Okay, make sure.
00:01:03.214 - 00:01:06.110, Speaker A: Recording. We're recording, right?
00:01:06.302 - 00:01:08.034, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Sorry.
00:01:16.574 - 00:01:23.264, Speaker D: Our first speaker is from Western University. There is my home.
00:01:33.444 - 00:01:34.404, Speaker A: Hello, everybody.
00:01:34.444 - 00:01:51.186, Speaker D: I'm sorry we are late today because of the problem. So, our first speaker is from McMaster University. His topic is rigidity of remaining inequality with corners.
00:01:51.290 - 00:02:06.570, Speaker A: So that's work. Thank you, everyone, for coming and also online. So, the seminar is a low regularity physics and geometry seminar.
00:02:06.682 - 00:02:08.842, Speaker D: So in the last two years, I.
00:02:08.858 - 00:02:25.196, Speaker A: Was working on high regularity. So today's talk will be not new, new stuff, but like two years ago. Okay. But there are still open questions and lots of problems relating to this topic. So I choose to talk today here.
00:02:25.340 - 00:02:26.184, Speaker C: Okay.
00:02:37.524 - 00:03:29.532, Speaker A: Okay, so we're starting from some basic surface theory and also from general relativity, and I'll talk about the main result and also talk about some open problems. So, first of all, I will always use this slide to describe what we learned in differential geometry of surface. So, basically, when you write down a surface, and you can write down your position vector, and then you can compute your first fundamental form and also second fundamental form, and more importantly, you can compute the Gauss curvature. Okay, so here the Gauss curvature. Here we compute to use as h I j and g I j. This is actually called Gauss equation. Sometimes we write h up and lower j, which means the normalized second fundamental form.
00:03:29.532 - 00:03:31.492, Speaker A: But because this is two dimensions, so.
00:03:31.508 - 00:03:36.876, Speaker D: It'S the same as we write the determinant.
00:03:36.900 - 00:03:38.944, Speaker C: What's the x subscripts?
00:03:39.644 - 00:04:11.490, Speaker A: Oh, so, yes, this is a second derivative you can write down. So this is just x is a position vector. So I and j can write I. All right. Okay, so a basic theorem, which is uniformization theorem, tell us. Okay, you can describe your surface into genus. You characterize your surface into genus, in particular, a convex surface.
00:04:11.490 - 00:04:13.930, Speaker A: Then you have to be a topological.
00:04:13.962 - 00:04:16.258, Speaker D: So you can't have any genus at all.
00:04:16.386 - 00:04:49.658, Speaker A: And now, and also because it's convex, so it has positive Gauss curvature. So basically, you have this convex surface had to be s 2G with parts of Gauss curves. So the other way around is now, if you can see the arbitrary surface, you see S 2G. So this is a remaining manual two dimension. And because your Gauss curvature is intrinsic, so you can compute just by the magic. So now this is the intrinsic one. So the question is, can you realize this as an extrinsic one, which is convex surface in r three.
00:04:49.658 - 00:05:09.270, Speaker A: So note that here we have two kind of thing. So the first thing is intrinsic, intrinsic. So now the other one is convex surface, three reals.
00:05:09.382 - 00:05:10.434, Speaker D: So this is.
00:05:12.334 - 00:05:32.654, Speaker A: Convex. So this is intrinsic. This is extrinsic. So the polarization theorem says this is this way, okay? So anything like this, you have to be this, okay? So the other way around is you can have this one. So this is a question. So I wrote that one. That means it's a theorem.
00:05:32.654 - 00:06:09.374, Speaker A: So this is actually called was embedding problem. And then this is proved 60, more than 60 years ago by Nuremberg and Pogrello independently. So from the analysis point of view here, you have to make some regularity requirement. So here you have to be a c four metric on s two. So here, this theory, here, what I state is a form in the Nielenberg form, okay? So now you have positive gas coverage. Then it can be asymmetric, embed into r three as convex surface. So this is existence theory.
00:06:09.374 - 00:06:52.942, Speaker A: So you actually also have a uniqueness theorem, okay? So uniqueness, now you have existence. But the thing is if how many embedding you have, right? So probably you have s 2g, but you probably have different kind of embedding. So if you have different kind of embedding, are they the same or not? Right? So this is uniqueness. Uniqueness is if you have two embeddings, okay? So if they are convex asymmetric, then they have to be unique up to rigid motion. Here we identify the orientation so that they have the same orientation. Otherwise reflection is another one. So here you only have translation rotations.
00:06:52.942 - 00:07:09.314, Speaker A: Those are rigid motion. Pass three. Okay, so this is a convulsant theorem. It's actually proved earlier that Nierenberg's existence theory. Okay, so here we have existence and nucleus. Okay, so existing uniqueness. And we have one to one corresponding.
00:07:09.314 - 00:07:32.350, Speaker A: So one is S 2g with positive Gaussico, this is intrinsic and the other is convex surface natural, which is extrinsic. Okay, so remark would be unlike the existence theory. Okay, so existence theory is highly restrictive, because if you want to hide dimension, then you will have.
00:07:32.382 - 00:07:45.166, Speaker D: Yes, I was just wondering, I don't know if the people online can hear, but when you say convex services, is there any assumption that they are? I'll ask it again. So, I'm just wondering, when you say.
00:07:45.190 - 00:07:46.942, Speaker A: Convex surfaces, is there any assumption that.
00:07:46.958 - 00:07:50.114, Speaker D: The services, a priori, are like bounded.
00:07:50.274 - 00:08:21.734, Speaker A: Oh, yes, they are bounded. Close bounded, close bonded. Smooth. Okay, thank you. Otherwise you can be close eyes too, right? Okay, so here. Any more questions? Okay, so the uniqueness actually works for high dimensions as well as in space form, space form. Here, I mean, upper hemisphere and the hypotenuse space, those are with a simple topology.
00:08:23.234 - 00:08:24.026, Speaker C: Okay?
00:08:24.170 - 00:08:39.706, Speaker A: So those are all those euclidean space. Okay? So I did not really talk about the existence theory for hypotenuse space and anything else, so. But I want to talk about the threshold, which actually is different phenomenon from the euclidean space.
00:08:39.810 - 00:08:40.274, Speaker C: Okay?
00:08:40.354 - 00:08:50.588, Speaker A: So structures would say sometimes we say spatial threshold manifold, or sometimes we just say threshold manifold. Depends on where your background is.
00:08:50.676 - 00:08:51.132, Speaker C: Okay?
00:08:51.188 - 00:09:17.984, Speaker A: So for me, it's manifold with a metric in this way, which I wrote at Gm. Okay, so now you see, this is dx squared. But before that you have wap, which is one over one minus two m over s. Okay? So obviously, if you want this is a metric, then your s. Okay, so your parameter s has to be greater than two m. Otherwise it's not a metric. Right? So.
00:09:20.604 - 00:09:21.140, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:09:21.172 - 00:09:22.144, Speaker D: So it's the wrong.
00:09:23.204 - 00:09:28.104, Speaker A: Yeah. No, this is a manifold. It's not theorens yet.
00:09:30.844 - 00:09:32.464, Speaker D: You just get a slice.
00:09:33.804 - 00:09:55.732, Speaker A: Okay? And also, we are talking about the physics physical natural one. So we are talking about a positive mass. M is positive. So you can have the negative mass one. But that's not complete manual. Okay, so a theorem proved by li n one is saying the following. So now you just can see the coordinates of theore.
00:09:55.732 - 00:10:11.740, Speaker A: Okay. Nothing else. Okay, so then they can prove that very, very close to that. According to. Then you can have another surface. Okay, which I wrote as sigma two. Okay? They are asymmetric, which means they are induced metric are the same.
00:10:11.740 - 00:10:13.948, Speaker A: But the second fundamental form are different.
00:10:14.036 - 00:10:15.492, Speaker C: Okay, sorry.
00:10:15.588 - 00:10:19.944, Speaker D: The unmet surface now is an r three or what signature.
00:10:20.364 - 00:10:21.784, Speaker A: Both are in structural.
00:10:22.564 - 00:10:23.464, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:10:23.884 - 00:10:34.200, Speaker A: Basically I'm writing. Okay, so structural. Do we always write in this way? Okay, so this is. Mm, as we say. So this is. You have a. You have boundary.
00:10:34.200 - 00:10:53.552, Speaker A: Okay, so the boundary is just s equal to two. Basically just s equal to two m. Okay, so because of structural manifold. So s has to be greater or equal than two m. So this is a boundary. It's actually a totally jura basic surface or minimal surface. So now you have a sigma, which is here.
00:10:53.552 - 00:11:01.080, Speaker A: Okay, so this is according to Sophia. Okay, so you can perturb a little bit.
00:11:01.152 - 00:11:05.048, Speaker D: Okay, so sigma is itself. So what does convex mean?
00:11:05.096 - 00:11:07.256, Speaker C: Convex means positive definite second point.
00:11:07.440 - 00:11:08.404, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes.
00:11:10.264 - 00:11:12.844, Speaker D: And so sigma is it not itself convex.
00:11:13.744 - 00:11:17.040, Speaker A: Sigma itself is also convex. Yeah.
00:11:17.192 - 00:11:17.480, Speaker C: So.
00:11:17.512 - 00:11:44.876, Speaker A: So you can confuse it. You can confuse the. The principal code of this coordinate, I believe, is s over one or s prime of something. It's just using those s. And it's quite clear to compute. Okay, so now you have this sigma two, okay? So both of them come x, which means they are second fundamental, positive definite. Okay? And they are asymmetric.
00:11:44.876 - 00:12:08.004, Speaker A: So the induced magical state. But the second fundamental form another. So if your second fundamentals form another same, obviously you can't recover it using the motion of the Schwartzel manifold. Actually, the Schwartz manifold is here. The rigid motion is just a rotation. So you can't really rotate. In any case, back to the chord disappear.
00:12:08.004 - 00:12:19.378, Speaker A: So the reason here is. The hidden reason here is actually simple. So the rigid motion in structural manifold only has three dimensions. You only have rotation. You don't have translation.
00:12:19.546 - 00:12:19.994, Speaker C: Okay?
00:12:20.034 - 00:12:47.078, Speaker A: In r three, you have translation. So now you give three dimension freedom to do those existence. So now question is. Okay, so now I know that even in the best case, the corelisphere, I can't guarantee the rigidity of isometric surface. Right? So I have to impose that.
00:12:47.166 - 00:12:47.910, Speaker C: Okay, sorry.
00:12:48.022 - 00:12:51.942, Speaker D: And sigma integral can be arbitrarily close to sigma or.
00:12:51.958 - 00:12:57.674, Speaker A: No, you actually have a lot of sigma tilde. It is close.
00:12:58.134 - 00:13:01.394, Speaker C: So you don't even have local region. Nope.
00:13:05.254 - 00:13:15.374, Speaker A: So you have to impose some condition on this. This. Okay, so what is a natural condition to impose? Right. So this is a very natural question.
00:13:15.534 - 00:13:16.150, Speaker C: Okay.
00:13:16.262 - 00:13:19.854, Speaker A: So this is one motivation.
00:13:19.974 - 00:13:20.422, Speaker C: Okay.
00:13:20.478 - 00:13:32.434, Speaker A: So the other motivation is actually from a study of remaining panels here. Quality. Okay, so, basically, now we have a manifold which is asymptotic flat.
00:13:33.254 - 00:13:34.766, Speaker E: Excuse me, I have a question.
00:13:34.910 - 00:13:35.662, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:35.838 - 00:13:55.018, Speaker E: So, if you go back one slide. Let's see here. So, I'm curious as to what you mean by rigidity. Of. What do you mean by rigidity in this sense? In the Schwarzschild sense, I can understand it in the euclidean sense, but in the Schwarzschild sense, in the threshold.
00:13:55.106 - 00:14:05.072, Speaker A: In the threshold, yeah. So, basically, what I want to say is, so if you have two surface in threshold manifold, they are asymmetric to each other.
00:14:05.178 - 00:14:06.124, Speaker C: Okay. Okay.
00:14:06.284 - 00:14:15.244, Speaker A: So in Ukraine space, you know, they are. They are the same right after we do the motion. But here we know you can't. Right, because we have examples.
00:14:15.364 - 00:14:17.596, Speaker E: Yeah, because. Because of Li Wang, you're saying that.
00:14:17.660 - 00:14:22.876, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because of that. So you need to impose something to exclude Li one's example.
00:14:22.940 - 00:14:25.116, Speaker C: Right. Okay. Okay.
00:14:25.140 - 00:14:26.064, Speaker E: I think I see.
00:14:27.644 - 00:14:28.500, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:14:28.652 - 00:14:54.264, Speaker A: Thanks. All right, so now our second part. Our second motivation is from remaining parasympathetic with corners. Okay? So before that, we need to talk about what is PMT? And then we talk about. Okay, so we say manifold MG is at some topic flat. Then we need to have impose an order. Okay, so basically how fast it decays to euclidean metric.
00:14:54.264 - 00:15:44.944, Speaker A: Okay, so which is in the following, okay, so now if your delta, so decay order is greater than half, then Bartnet proves that the mass is well defined, which is ADM's, which is the following. So we will not go deep into this part. We just review some results for PMT. Okay, so the fundamental theorem by Sheng Yao and later by Witten says if Mg is an asymptotic flat manifold with non x scalar curve, recall here we don't have boundaries. Okay? So here we are saying this is complete no boundary. Then your adms greater equivalent zero. And it query holds if and only if it's asymmetric to the euclidean metric.
00:15:44.944 - 00:16:34.434, Speaker A: Okay, so in the last probably five years, we have several more proof for this positive mass theorem. The first one coming in 2018, actually I think it's early, is by Yui Lee, he used the rich blow. And later by Daniel Stern and Hubert and Marcus Cooley and Dimitri Kazaris. They are using those harmonic functions. And recently, now I don't remember those names. I think one of them is Mazieri, three italian mathematicians, they use p harmonic functions to. And I think their latest work is using p harmonic function to even prove remaining parasympathetic.
00:16:34.434 - 00:17:19.570, Speaker A: And also recently, Pence meow, he wrote one paper and he can also use similar ideas, use those harmonic functions to reprove those. Okay, so we have now more than 12345, this five waste proof. Anyway, so this is just a mark. Okay, now we talk about remaining panels inequality. Remember, on the positive mass theorem, all the manifold are complete without boundaries. So now when you talk about the boundary, so that you have to compose something, otherwise you might not be able to prove positive message. Because if you're, for instance, the negative threshold manifold.
00:17:19.570 - 00:17:59.014, Speaker A: So if you just cut them, then you are not complete metric, then you have boundary, or then you do not have the supportive method. So now for boundaries. And one of the notions we have is just horizon. And then to be more precise, and we need to use those either say, outmost minimal surface or outer minimizing minimal surface. Okay, so in the original proof of quizzing Yaman, they use the outermost minimal surface. And later it's generalized by brain to include those outer minimum ice. Okay, so basically it's like this.
00:17:59.014 - 00:18:08.974, Speaker A: So let's just.
00:18:10.144 - 00:18:10.924, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:15.504 - 00:19:00.608, Speaker A: So this is one surface sigma. So if it auto minimizing, then so any other surface, okay, sigma prime surrounding it. So then your average. So this is quite natural. If you are seeing previous space, okay? So if you are bigger than you have, but when you have a matrix and you need to impose as you have some neck or something, then you can't do that. Okay, so this is a notation, okay. And it's obvious you just found here that the utmost minimal surface has to be ultimately mining, okay, and actually strict.
00:19:00.608 - 00:19:30.964, Speaker A: Okay, so the positive mass of remaining pyrocyte coordinate proved by placing em up and later or independent by brain, it says, which I'm quoting here, is a bridge theorem, okay? So if it's asymptotic flat nonetheless scalar curve and your boundary is out minimizing minimal surface, okay. And then you have those ADM mass has a lower bound which is contributed by the area, okay. In the form like square root of the area over 16 PI.
00:19:31.044 - 00:19:31.484, Speaker C: Okay.
00:19:31.564 - 00:19:43.454, Speaker A: And moreover, the equality holds if and only if this one is asymmetric to the just threshold manifold. So this is a really canonical choice. Okay.
00:19:45.154 - 00:19:49.226, Speaker C: All right, so this is serum.
00:19:49.330 - 00:20:17.024, Speaker A: Okay, so now we are talking about PMt with corners. It has a deep connection with quasi local mass. We probably see later. But now I'm little bit, have a little bit more notations here. Okay, so basically you are not talking about one manifold, but two manifold but pinched together. Okay? So basically I'm saying here, okay.
00:20:19.164 - 00:20:19.500, Speaker C: So.
00:20:19.532 - 00:20:53.880, Speaker A: You have two parts. Okay, we have two parts. So this is your omega, okay, so now you have the boundary. So this is partial n, but this is equivalent.
00:20:53.952 - 00:20:55.364, Speaker D: Okay, asymmetric.
00:20:57.024 - 00:21:03.856, Speaker A: Okay, so I can take this one and more over your mean curvature. This is your mean curvature and this.
00:21:03.880 - 00:21:04.964, Speaker C: Is your main curve.
00:21:06.544 - 00:21:26.796, Speaker A: So your main curvature are the same. So here, symmetric. Of course, all of them are non negative curvature.
00:21:26.980 - 00:21:28.064, Speaker C: So basically.
00:21:32.924 - 00:22:07.550, Speaker A: So if we put them together, you will have this one. Okay, so this one is symmetric, are the same. Yeah, you can't say glue because your metric, although your metric is the same. Right. But that's only point wise. You don't say they are derivative of the same.
00:22:07.582 - 00:22:10.846, Speaker C: Right? Yeah.
00:22:10.870 - 00:22:12.334, Speaker A: Second fundamental don't match at all.
00:22:12.414 - 00:22:16.094, Speaker C: So you could move them to have a non slowdown.
00:22:16.204 - 00:22:28.250, Speaker A: You can glue them. But the thing is, if you really glue, then you change the metric value. If you put them together, the metric is not smooth, right? Yeah, the metric is not snuzz.
00:22:28.362 - 00:22:41.454, Speaker B: I think that's a dependence on the culture. So in metric geometry, we would say gluing even without the differentiability. Okay, so in differential geometry, usually they require smoothing also to glue.
00:22:42.094 - 00:22:51.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Christina. So basically here, the most important issue here is second fundamental.
00:22:51.854 - 00:22:55.310, Speaker C: Okay, so you have a second fundamental.
00:22:55.342 - 00:23:09.990, Speaker A: Formality because the second fundamental form can be considered as a derivative of geometric, right. So in here we don't guarantee the other thing.
00:23:10.062 - 00:23:15.914, Speaker C: Okay, it's a mean coverage.
00:23:16.374 - 00:23:39.542, Speaker A: So, so what does it mean scalar here, because it's surface. So here we only impose that the mean curvature have a, have a sign. Okay, then your adms still positive. And moreover, okay, so moreover, if equality.
00:23:39.598 - 00:23:42.470, Speaker C: Holds, okay, if you call it holes.
00:23:42.502 - 00:23:46.754, Speaker A: Then your metric is c eleven, diphthomorphic.
00:23:47.654 - 00:23:51.366, Speaker C: Up to a c one diphthomorphism to.
00:23:51.390 - 00:23:55.854, Speaker A: The Euclidean metric, which is a flat metric. Okay, so again, the reason here is.
00:23:55.894 - 00:23:59.608, Speaker C: That zero 1d thermorphism.
00:23:59.726 - 00:24:56.776, Speaker A: And then basically saying your metric is up to elliptic, right. Your metric is your only ellipsis, so you can't see it after doing your smooth. That's not true. That's in general not true. So basically this is proved by using spin proof by xi and tian, and later using, using gluing and conformal chain by meow, and then later by McFarren Healey using rich flow. So the idea is if, now this is, so now this is actually a very, very good application of rich flow. We know by miles that mild synonym, that as long as you have c zero, okay, you have seasonal metric, then you can run rich flow.
00:24:56.776 - 00:25:29.584, Speaker A: So here we actually have a glyphsious metric, so we can run rich flow. And moreover, Sakahedia McFarland actually discovered that along this rich flow, your mass is monotonic. So by Miao's proof, you can glue in and doing conformal change. But then after those change, your mass is not monotonic. So you can prove the rigidity. But here using rich flows, you can prove the rigidity. So that's the beauty of this McPherian proof, which is a good application of rich flow.
00:25:29.584 - 00:25:44.864, Speaker A: Actually turn out this is a key proof for our rigidity, for human parasitic inequality. So now with PNT, so you can ask actually has questions.
00:25:46.884 - 00:25:52.604, Speaker D: So what do you mean by corners here, corner with a corner with a hyper surface corner.
00:25:52.684 - 00:25:57.024, Speaker A: So basically this is half surface. So this is not smooth surrounding.
00:25:58.284 - 00:26:00.892, Speaker D: And is that as monotonic under the.
00:26:00.908 - 00:26:08.984, Speaker A: Flow or constant monotonic. So but if you are zero, then monotonic. So you have to be zero.
00:26:10.124 - 00:26:11.104, Speaker C: So the.
00:26:13.764 - 00:26:54.002, Speaker A: So that's how they prove adjudicity. Okay, so now we actually have another setting. Okay, so now just this is mgn more or less the same, okay. Omega J omega. So this is sigma h, which is a minimal surface.
00:26:54.138 - 00:26:57.042, Speaker C: Okay, so the metric here is the.
00:26:57.058 - 00:26:57.614, Speaker A: Same.
00:27:00.074 - 00:27:03.602, Speaker C: G partial n equal to sigma.
00:27:03.778 - 00:27:32.584, Speaker A: Okay, so this is out of minimizing. Okay, so basically it's just the same setting, except that, you know, also we need to have link of each condition, right?
00:27:32.704 - 00:27:33.564, Speaker C: So this.
00:27:40.354 - 00:27:52.894, Speaker A: So you only the same thing. You only need to have a sign on the mean curvature. Then you can prove the remaining parallels inequality was called just same stuff. Okay.
00:27:59.684 - 00:28:18.544, Speaker D: So just to understand even going back to the previous theorem, so the prefrontal, what I infer is that there isn't a general version of the positive mass theorem for manifold with not very smooth metrics, but you can handle non smoothnesses of this particular kind where it's across microsurface rings.
00:28:20.604 - 00:28:51.390, Speaker A: Okay, so there's actually a conjecture by ring shin. So it says if you're so in a general manifold, right? If you are not smooth. And his. His conjecture is this. So if your singularity set is co dimension four, three or four. Let me see, co dimension three, sorry, co dimension three. So if it's three dimension, then if it's dot, it quote s isolated points, then supporting master holds.
00:28:51.522 - 00:28:52.006, Speaker C: Okay.
00:28:52.070 - 00:29:11.114, Speaker A: And for three dimension, it's actually proved by Charlie and Christopher's methodist. But for high dimension, it's not known. But for like code dimension one, like this. So this is a special case then you have to have mean curvature condition. So, but for codimension two, and others still not really know.
00:29:13.454 - 00:29:14.194, Speaker C: So.
00:29:14.814 - 00:29:32.864, Speaker A: So for codimension two, then it's some lines and angles, and this is some of some dihedral and some conjunctions. For co dimensions three and more. And then that's Rickshaw's conjunction.
00:29:34.324 - 00:29:35.104, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:29:36.564 - 00:30:19.094, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a very particular setting, and it actually has the application in quasi local mass, which we'll see later. Okay, so in now, this is approved by this theorem. They prove by mail and call me out. But in their setting, because they are using those conformal chains, so they cannot prove their rigidity. Okay, so, because along those conformal change, you cannot ensure that your metric, your mass, is monotonic. And here, the problem is, you cannot directly use rich flow. The reason is you have a boundary, so you can reach flow with boundary.
00:30:19.094 - 00:30:48.144, Speaker A: Then you cannot run the rich flow and make symmetric on the boundary the same. You can't do that. You can only keep it on the conformal class. That's, I think, proved by. Yeah, but you cannot make the metric the same. So you can't directly use magvariance keys. Okay, directly.
00:30:48.144 - 00:31:07.064, Speaker A: Okay, so now I'm saying those things with corners actually has applications quite the local mass. The reason is we just look at those bryok masks. Okay, so now, Bryok math is the following. Okay, so this goes back to the isometric embedding theorem.
00:31:14.694 - 00:31:15.270, Speaker C: Okay?
00:31:15.342 - 00:31:17.822, Speaker D: So this can't move that backward.
00:31:17.958 - 00:32:07.536, Speaker A: Oh, how can you release this? So, basically, three antenna series is like this. So we just draw pictures, okay, so we have omega. So you have sigma. So you have an induced metric g.
00:32:07.600 - 00:32:08.324, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:10.344 - 00:32:19.224, Speaker A: So now, if I'm assuming this is, uh. I'm assuming.
00:32:19.304 - 00:32:20.888, Speaker C: Okay, so your.
00:32:20.936 - 00:32:25.764, Speaker A: Your boundary is actually just s 2g, okay, your boundary is just.
00:32:26.224 - 00:32:26.824, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:26.904 - 00:32:37.574, Speaker A: And moreover, I'm assuming the. In the gauss curvature, okay, from this metric, that the boundary is just positive.
00:32:38.634 - 00:32:44.154, Speaker C: So now, this setting is just in the first slide.
00:32:44.234 - 00:33:11.594, Speaker A: In the second slide, we're talking about as matching density. So now this one naturally, okay, as matching that to r three as a convex surface. Okay, so let's fill the note. So now you have another surface. This is in three. So you have a mean curve, and we know it's convex. So your main coverage point.
00:33:11.594 - 00:33:34.354, Speaker A: So now, in here, in euclidean space, then this is s two. So you have a region outside or inside. So this. This outside. I don't need to do this. So you have a surface. So now you have two min codes, right? So this is in r three.
00:33:34.434 - 00:33:35.778, Speaker C: Okay, this is.
00:33:35.866 - 00:33:55.074, Speaker A: This is matching value guaranteed by neighborhood progress. Okay, so this is h. Okay, so they are asymmetric. So you can define this h zero minus h u g. And this is Brianne class. So this a PI is just.
00:33:57.414 - 00:33:58.094, Speaker C: Constant.
00:33:58.174 - 00:34:05.302, Speaker A: Okay, so this is just one defined just using the symmetry theorem. Okay, so now she tan theorem saying.
00:34:05.358 - 00:34:08.350, Speaker C: Okay, in this setting, the branch of.
00:34:08.382 - 00:34:11.006, Speaker A: Mass is negative and equally hold if and only if.
00:34:11.030 - 00:34:14.874, Speaker C: This is this region, this omega g.
00:34:14.914 - 00:34:29.194, Speaker A: This is asymmetric to actually this here. Okay, this the one inside. So, in other words, this can be considered as a quasi local version of positive messiah.
00:34:29.274 - 00:34:29.514, Speaker C: What?
00:34:29.554 - 00:34:44.554, Speaker A: Positive messenger says your mass is non negative and equal to zero if and only if. This is your clearance here, it's just a local version, your brain of mass and negative equals zero if and only if it's regional.
00:34:44.854 - 00:34:45.462, Speaker C: Okay?
00:34:45.558 - 00:35:14.974, Speaker A: So especially when they prove the rigidity, it's actually just using the potent massing with coordinate. Just the theorem we just said before. All right, so, several years ago with Miao, we are able to generalize cn tan theorem to threshold mango. Okay, so basically, we are saying pretty much the same thing. Okay, so basically.
00:35:17.034 - 00:35:21.634, Speaker C: Okay, sometime we're just.
00:35:21.674 - 00:35:22.594, Speaker A: Doing the same thing.
00:35:22.674 - 00:35:23.414, Speaker C: Okay.
00:35:25.594 - 00:35:28.578, Speaker A: Okay, so now. So now this is sigma.
00:35:28.706 - 00:35:32.774, Speaker C: Okay, so your min curve is positive.
00:35:33.964 - 00:35:43.304, Speaker A: All right, so, because we are not able to prove the existence here. So, assume, okay, so this is asymmetric.
00:35:59.184 - 00:36:00.484, Speaker C: So this is sigma.
00:36:01.184 - 00:36:14.164, Speaker A: So this is mm gm, which is ratio. So now you have a hm.
00:36:14.744 - 00:36:15.604, Speaker C: Okay.
00:36:17.464 - 00:36:38.760, Speaker A: So, so you can define this left hand side. Okay, so, okay, so basically, the only difference between shear and tan, our series. Okay, so, first of all, we allow those minimal surface here. Okay, so they are here. They don't have as boundary component, except the sigma.
00:36:38.912 - 00:36:39.472, Speaker C: Okay?
00:36:39.568 - 00:37:17.132, Speaker A: Second of all, they are smudging that into r three. So, this asymmetric embedded theory is guaranteed by Nuremberg per theorem. But here, because there is no such theory exists even for now. So, we assume this embedding exists. Okay, so, in particular, if this is a very wrong, which means the perturbation of a cordial sphere, then this is true by openness of the one. Okay, so now the other difference is our, our left hand side, which is the bright mass in that setting, is different from there, right? So, but if we put m equal.
00:37:17.148 - 00:37:19.836, Speaker C: To zero, which when m equal to.
00:37:19.860 - 00:37:25.828, Speaker A: Zero, then threshold manifold is equal space, then you see they are actually the same.
00:37:25.956 - 00:37:28.996, Speaker C: Okay, so now with this one, the.
00:37:29.020 - 00:37:52.504, Speaker A: Left hand side, which I can see, this is just, you know, a generalized quasi locomotive mass. Okay, then this is, you have a lower bound, which is given by the area of area the mass contributed by the minimum surface. So, at that time, unfortunately, we do not have the rigidity. So the reason is, again, because.
00:37:55.124 - 00:37:55.676, Speaker C: There'S.
00:37:55.740 - 00:38:17.178, Speaker A: No rigidity of reimpars in equality, because that's the one we need to use. Okay, well, but what we can do at that time is we know if the equality holds, then your mean curvature in the threshold manifold and your original one is the same. And moreover, the equality holds, then your mass m, because this one, mm.
00:38:17.356 - 00:38:19.462, Speaker C: This, they are equal.
00:38:19.518 - 00:39:10.144, Speaker A: Okay, so this m is really equal to this. Okay, that time we know this one. Okay, so now if you have that one, then what do we have is the following. So, if we put our setting in the rigidity case, what do we have? We will have the volume. This is indeed just mng n. Okay, and this is your original one. Our original one, omega g omega.
00:39:10.144 - 00:39:32.684, Speaker A: We know this sigma. And this is sigma. This is sigma h. Okay, so this is h equal to h f. Okay, and moreover m equal to the mass contributed by this one. So, everything is actually just the setting of remain panels in equality with corners. Okay, when you have the equality codes, I'll probably write.
00:39:43.484 - 00:39:44.508, Speaker C: So if the metric.
00:39:44.556 - 00:40:07.416, Speaker A: Are smooth here, then this is just rigidity of remaining parallels inequality. Then you have, you know this, the whole thing is a remaining panel. Okay, but here, we only know. Okay, the metric is equal here. Okay? Which is the same. Okay, your mass is equal to this one. But we don't know if this thing is really a domain in structure.
00:40:07.416 - 00:40:12.896, Speaker A: Okay, this one, yes. This one we don't know. So we want to use those information to get.
00:40:13.080 - 00:40:15.736, Speaker C: This one is indeed the structure like.
00:40:15.760 - 00:40:36.908, Speaker A: In K, like the PMT with corners. Okay? So if mass is zero, then this is c eleven, diphthomorphic to euclidean, and in particular, the unbounded part and the bounded part. Both of them are asymmetric to, you know, part of euclidean space.
00:40:36.996 - 00:40:37.744, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:38.644 - 00:40:44.932, Speaker A: All right, so that's. Hi, may I ask a question? Yeah. Can you go to the previous slide, please?
00:40:45.108 - 00:40:45.864, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:46.844 - 00:41:06.764, Speaker A: So you have this, like, assumption of, like, this existence of the embedding. Yeah. But is it known, like, what conditions, like, assure such existence or. Okay, so in a special case, for example, if your metric is very close to a round metric, then yes, in general, it's open questions.
00:41:06.884 - 00:41:08.464, Speaker C: Ah, okay, thank you.
00:41:13.244 - 00:41:19.852, Speaker A: And it will be very desirable to know the existence in this part, because that fulfills all the inequality.
00:41:19.908 - 00:41:20.244, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:20.324 - 00:41:25.204, Speaker A: It does not depend on other assumptions, which is not so neat. Okay.
00:41:26.464 - 00:41:27.168, Speaker C: All right.
00:41:27.296 - 00:41:33.936, Speaker A: So this is a question is if we can prove that the bounded part is asymmetric to a domain.
00:41:34.080 - 00:41:36.528, Speaker C: MMGF. Okay. All right.
00:41:36.616 - 00:42:26.390, Speaker A: So now let's just go back to the very beginning. Okay, so, very beginning, we say, okay, if you have two asymmetric surface in structural manifold. Okay, we know by Li and Wang's example, you can't expect they are, you know, the same thing. But what about with our assumptions here? The mean curvature conditions seem to be a natural one. So if we compose, impose a condition on the mean curvature, which is here, then can you prove that they are, you know, really asymmetric, really the same one after rigid motion. Okay, so now in the very beginning, we see, find a natural condition. So here, one natural condition, I don't say it's the most natural one.
00:42:26.390 - 00:42:28.822, Speaker A: Natural condition comes as the mean curvature condition.
00:42:28.918 - 00:42:29.390, Speaker C: Okay.
00:42:29.462 - 00:43:03.724, Speaker A: Because that's what we, what we do in the, in all those PMT, what is called. Right. So your main coverage. Okay, so if in that settings, okay, then this fall back actually to the remaining colors in coding with codex, because, okay, so you have two surface.
00:43:14.634 - 00:43:21.554, Speaker C: Okay, let's see, sigma, sigma two.
00:43:21.634 - 00:43:48.046, Speaker A: Okay, so now we can compose. This is sigma two. So the other part, one. Okay, so this is sigma. So you can see the, you know, the boundary region inside sigma, and you can see the outside region of sigma two. Okay, you put them together. So if you consider the mean curve, this is, so this is, now this, this part is m.
00:43:48.046 - 00:43:57.774, Speaker A: This part is really threshold. And this part is also threshold, okay? But your metrics are the same because they are asymmetric on this surface.
00:43:57.854 - 00:43:58.598, Speaker C: Okay.
00:43:58.766 - 00:44:08.730, Speaker A: And your mean coverage are the same. Okay, so this is exactly the, the settings in the, I'm remaining parents in coding with corners. Okay.
00:44:08.762 - 00:44:13.570, Speaker C: The resulting case, okay, so this setting.
00:44:13.602 - 00:44:30.096, Speaker A: Has been studied, okay, earlier in 20 ₩18 by Li Niao and Wong. Okay. Oh, in the structure, then it's just a graph over the horizon.
00:44:30.290 - 00:44:32.744, Speaker C: Okay, so yeah, your boundary.
00:44:34.964 - 00:44:38.064, Speaker A: So basically a graph of s two or sn.
00:44:38.364 - 00:44:39.304, Speaker C: So now.
00:44:42.284 - 00:45:12.754, Speaker A: Okay, so now they are proved that if you have two statutes, both of them stash it. So basically, now you're writing this thing as PD, as actually single function, right? So you have two graphs, okay, so you have two functions, and then you have an equation about asymmetric, asymmetric surface. So your induced metric are the same. So you have one equation and your mean curvature is the same. You have another equation. So you can play with this.
00:45:13.774 - 00:45:21.154, Speaker D: So the additional constraints here are the star shapeness and the quality curve. Yeah, that remove the non.
00:45:23.134 - 00:45:49.618, Speaker A: Yes, that's, that's what they prove. But starshipness is a little bit too strong. So Bo niche, Wenzhang, they come up with another proof. Okay, so this only works in three, in three dimensions. So one of them is starship with a non politic rich curve. The other, you don't have starship, miss. You can be anything as long as your topology is homologous to the horizon.
00:45:49.618 - 00:46:08.258, Speaker A: Okay, so this one, we always, we always assume that those things are surrounding this horizon. Okay, so you are not expecting that one is surrounding the horizon, the other is not. They are the same. This is not something we expect. Okay, so we just shake our topology so then we can prove this thing.
00:46:08.306 - 00:46:11.298, Speaker C: Okay. All right.
00:46:11.386 - 00:46:59.414, Speaker A: And because the star shapeness of linear one theorem works actually for high dimension, and Chen and Zhang's theorem works for three dimension only. The reason is they need to use existing existence of asymmetry in value that only works for three dimension. It does not work for high dimension as ambient rich curvature of the threshold. Okay, so it does not. This is actually part of, you know, technical assumption in my work with meow before. So we expect that this condition here can be removed. Okay, so this is only to guarantee the solubility of a certain equation.
00:46:59.414 - 00:47:46.502, Speaker A: But this is quite technical. All right, so this is several years ago. Okay, so what Miao and I proved is this, that actually in the remaining parallel inequality in the localized remaining parallel input that's three dimensional. This is asymmetric to a domain immgm. So basically our similar to this one. I guess I removed some there. So if you have the quasi local mass in quantity into equality whole, then this is just a domain Mng.
00:47:46.502 - 00:48:24.502, Speaker A: So then you just really get a rigidity for that part. Parallel to sheetansia. Okay, so in the rain parallel scene coding with corner, then zi one and yuji actually using. Okay, so we know if you want to prove such parasitic, you have to prove, right, one is whiskey, the other three, now they have another. Okay, so they just use the inverse mincarge flow. So you run the inverse mincarge flow, you know the monotonicity. But the problem for that one is you have a surface outside.
00:48:24.502 - 00:48:27.398, Speaker A: So you don't know the inverse mean purge flow when they touch.
00:48:27.446 - 00:48:28.034, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:28.464 - 00:49:04.846, Speaker A: You even you cannot, you know, passing through the surface. You cannot run the inverse link of passing through the corner surface because your metric is not smooth. Okay, so you can run until after. So they prove that if you your your surface kind of some star shapeness, since they use a unique mini module basic, then they can prove only inside one. So inside region is symmetric to a domain, in short manifold. But they cannot see anything really about outside one. Okay.
00:49:04.846 - 00:49:27.588, Speaker A: Except they are static. Okay, so that's the previous result. So the work with meow, that's two years ago we proved that, first of all, in the remaining panels in continuous with corners. So this is the most. We have three motivations. One is as measured surface with asymmetric surface. The other is localized, many parallel synchrony.
00:49:27.588 - 00:50:04.716, Speaker A: Third one is a remaining parallel synchrony. So just don't want to confuse you. So the most general case is many parasites with corners. Then we actually prove that if the equality holds, then you have second fundamental form as the same. Okay, so basically now and the inside one and outside one, both are asymmetric to a domain. A region in manifold we do not say they put together is a threshold because you have to some regularity issue. Because it's mostly that you can expect is your metric is vicious.
00:50:04.716 - 00:50:36.658, Speaker A: You cannot expect high. And the theorem works for three dimension to seven, which is same restriction as your. Nope. But we don't know how to prove. But I think for there's a preprint, I guess by a student of Rick Shen. Because in eight dimension is special. Because eight dimension, minimal surface anonymizing isolated singularity.
00:50:36.658 - 00:50:44.142, Speaker A: So I think he can prove that it's only appropriate. I think thesis and for more than eight, we don't know.
00:50:44.278 - 00:50:45.074, Speaker C: Okay.
00:50:45.574 - 00:51:32.964, Speaker A: Hope that it's not a counter example, because for more than eight, then there's counter for example for many things, right? Okay, so the query is, okay, localized manager works. And as measured surface works, if you have encouraged condition, don't also a bookstore. Okay, so I'll not really talk about proof. The proof is basically we just combine breeze proof, okay? The monotonicity. And with McLaren Zak, Hades idea. Okay, so instead of running the run the risk flow directly, we first reflect manifold and do the conformal chain. Then after that, your manifolds do not have a.
00:51:32.964 - 00:51:45.654, Speaker A: Do not have a boundary, but you have potential singularity. But this is a removal singularity. So basically you have a complete manifold. Then you want this McPherson heated rich flow. Then you can do this.
00:51:46.754 - 00:51:50.214, Speaker C: All right, so one question.
00:51:51.154 - 00:51:54.642, Speaker A: First of all, the mean coverage condition is actually too strong.
00:51:54.778 - 00:51:58.710, Speaker C: The reason is, in euclidean space, as.
00:51:58.742 - 00:52:07.358, Speaker A: Much surface convex, as much surface, they are already, you know, the same. Okay. Or if you just. Your mean curvatures are the same.
00:52:07.406 - 00:52:08.142, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:08.318 - 00:52:09.462, Speaker A: And they are the same.
00:52:09.598 - 00:52:10.014, Speaker C: So.
00:52:10.094 - 00:52:18.526, Speaker A: So basically, if you are convex and your mean curvature are the same, then there's so many proof they're the same. Okay, so now you need to two of them. That's too strong.
00:52:18.630 - 00:52:19.334, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:19.494 - 00:52:30.846, Speaker A: Although this is not in clear space, but this is too strong. So basically, can you get a weaker condition, for example, integral condition or other things.
00:52:30.910 - 00:52:31.634, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:32.014 - 00:52:47.798, Speaker A: And the other thing is, this is regarding our API, basically saying, because of the non rigidity for each embedding, this thing is true. For each embedding, this is true. But for each embedding, the left hand.
00:52:47.806 - 00:52:50.298, Speaker C: Side is different because the left hand.
00:52:50.306 - 00:53:04.930, Speaker A: Side is depending on the embedding. For instance, this one depending embedding. Hm. Depending on. So those are depending on the embedding. So one common question is, because this is true for all the embedding. So if you take informo, it's also true.
00:53:04.930 - 00:53:16.694, Speaker A: Okay. But if you take informal, first of all, the left hand side can be realized by, you know, some embedding we don't know.
00:53:17.834 - 00:53:18.554, Speaker C: I guess it's.
00:53:18.594 - 00:54:06.834, Speaker A: Yes, but if that one. How to characterize, right? Yes, that's another question I should actually. Interesting is that all those things, when we talk about asymmetry, asymmetric surface and everything, we always think this is convex. What if we do not have convexity? So for instance, how to prove that, you know, two torus, as much tolerance, they are the same. It's not convex anymore. So we can only do Sophia. Okay, that's all I want to say thank you.
00:54:33.594 - 00:54:34.414, Speaker C: It's.
00:54:35.434 - 00:54:44.174, Speaker D: So instead of like schwa shoe, those who have a boundary of two different.
00:54:57.914 - 00:54:59.764, Speaker C: Methods.
00:55:01.014 - 00:55:04.074, Speaker D: Boundary with this connection.
00:55:04.734 - 00:55:05.998, Speaker C: Oh, you mean here or.
00:55:06.046 - 00:55:06.674, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:07.374 - 00:55:42.124, Speaker A: Oh, this doesn't really matter. So in our clone, it doesn't matter. It's connected or not connected. So as long as you have the mean coverage condition and your metric, then you're good. So the starship needs improve the starchedness, all those things is not really in use to prove the PMT or RPI. It's more or less to prove those localized penalty equity.
00:55:42.284 - 00:55:43.424, Speaker C: So it's different.
00:55:50.564 - 00:55:51.904, Speaker B: In your main results.
00:55:52.304 - 00:55:52.920, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:53.032 - 00:56:13.560, Speaker B: If you could, you have. The upper part is isometric to schwarzschild region, and the lower part is isometric to schwarzschild region. Do you have a distance preserving one to one map from your manifold with corners combining both parts to Schwarzschild?
00:56:13.752 - 00:56:23.754, Speaker A: Oh. The reason we do not write the thing is, actually, we can see that we have a c eleven dphomorphism to the threshold manifold.
00:56:25.094 - 00:56:29.154, Speaker B: So it's distance preserving. It's a. It's a metric space isometry.
00:56:29.654 - 00:56:38.694, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the reason we do not write, you know, that way is then you need to write in gaussian coordinate. So it's not really. Yeah.
00:56:38.734 - 00:56:53.256, Speaker B: Well, that's a coordinate free notation. I just wanted to emphasize. I knew that that was true, and I wanted to emphasize it because there are metric geometers in the odds audience. We've just called that an isometry. So you have. You have that distance preserving globally. Yes.
00:56:53.400 - 00:56:54.164, Speaker C: Yep.
00:57:08.464 - 00:57:09.144, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
