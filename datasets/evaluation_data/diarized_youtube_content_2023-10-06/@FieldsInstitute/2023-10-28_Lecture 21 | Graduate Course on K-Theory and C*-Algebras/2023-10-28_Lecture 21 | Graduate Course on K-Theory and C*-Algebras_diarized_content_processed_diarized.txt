00:00:00.640 - 00:00:15.554, Speaker A: Afternoon. I've been talking where we have been talking about what?
00:00:15.934 - 00:00:16.390, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:16.422 - 00:00:48.194, Speaker A: Theory and sister algebra. Right. Okay. When you say case theory, that means two things. Even in connection with. I mean, there's a branch of k theory called algebraic k theory which talks about rings. Dead that subject ideals aren't even called rings supposed to have a unit.
00:00:48.194 - 00:01:45.950, Speaker A: Algebras seems to be quite important to be organic. Algorithm seems to be quite important to work without the unit. For instance, the idea of the suspension of quite working for understanding and proving. Understanding and working towards proving what? Great. Do you know what boss is? Well, okay. But next week you will know, right? That's. I'm sometimes.
00:01:45.950 - 00:02:33.864, Speaker A: I sometimes try to take on a rough countenance of a traditional professor. The late Abrahar Piersberg sometimes did that. He was very kind, but occasionally he liked to be gruff. I told this story in the middle of a lecture at the fields institute program. 19 94 95, Waterloo exposed in Waterloo. He was talking about his work and other people's work on classification of sea trails. Quite hot.
00:02:33.864 - 00:03:13.824, Speaker A: Then he had. You and I had both just finished talking with the International Congress of Mathematicians and observers. Well, at one point, because of how. How the subject is constructed, Professor Gertberg started talking about the property of quasi diagonality. Algebra can be quasi diagonal.
00:03:16.284 - 00:03:16.748, Speaker B: For a.
00:03:16.756 - 00:03:59.344, Speaker A: Single operator on the elbow space can be tried. I guess the terminology was introduced by Paul Halmore. Or it's for someone in the audience. Very good sized audience. Post office. Quite a number of faculty, faculty members. Someone put up their hand and said, what is project? Have I told this story? I have.
00:03:59.344 - 00:04:27.344, Speaker A: Well, okay. How many people remember? I thought it. Well, okay, but it's worth telling again, I think. Okay. So Hereford stopped and he said, I'll just close the door. I'm just, um. I'm just describing Professor Krusberg's lecture where someone asked about quasi diagonality.
00:04:27.344 - 00:04:55.434, Speaker A: And the idea is that he wasn't really very. He wasn't in real life, he wasn't dropped. But he maybe sometimes like to pretend he was. I don't know. Maybe he was. Maybe he was. What is quasi diagonality? Quasi diagonality is a very important concept.
00:04:55.434 - 00:05:55.156, Speaker A: Everyone should know what quasi diagonality is. And then you just continue. I assume everyone here knows what causes. Okay. But it basically means that you can almost map algebra into finite dimensions. You can't map it exactly, but you can map it approximately linear maps, which are approximately more effective, approximately more conditions on. But some of them follow robust concepts.
00:05:55.156 - 00:07:06.274, Speaker A: Very important. What periodicity. You talk about the suspension one way. One way of course there's, there's the general six term exact sequence, which is nothing dimensions, special feature algebraic. You just have an extension working with Banach algorithms. Assume that homework don't increase the normic algebra. Following the proof in the textbook, there are other proofs that would be a good exercise for someone, a good project, someone to look into some other proof has to work with Banach algebra.
00:07:06.274 - 00:09:30.134, Speaker A: Okay, not seizure algebra, because, well, that mean it has to anyway, it can't work with unitary it can't, doesn't work with unitary elements. Unitary elements one way of doing it in a sea challenge algebra k one for sea cells. What we'll see how we see why the venetic algebras, why in that case, unit areas are irrelevant if you have to talk about invertible elements and the k one group for unit verbic algebra elements modulo connective components group, and it's actually open. So the social group is naturally for algebra. And whether you talk about unitarians or verticals, it's the same because the polar decomposition, every unitary, every invertible element is a product of the unitary element, and the positive self is angle unitary on the left. If you approximate, have a unitary element and you have an argument involved, approximate unitary element by something a priori you don't even know is invertible. Okay, that's how the proof goes.
00:09:30.134 - 00:10:10.764, Speaker A: If you do, if you want to talk about unitaries to begin with and to proceed, you have to approximate by invertible element. This invertible element has to have certain properties. You can just say, well, the unitary is invertible, so approximate it by itself. Well, that doesn't work because of the property you want the approximating variable approximating elements to have. And we'll see that. Or you can speak in the book. And the point is that.
00:10:13.464 - 00:10:14.104, Speaker B: The element.
00:10:14.144 - 00:10:51.304, Speaker A: Is close to the unitary, and because the unitary is invertible, the element you're exposed to, it will be invertible, but certainly it won't be unitary. So that would be, that would be completely unexpected, even if you're in a teacher. Okay, but it's quite easy to prove it in terms of invertible elements.
00:11:25.804 - 00:12:30.340, Speaker B: Another way of defining the k one is suspension. You take the suspension of a given bandic algebra, and then you look at the k zero. This isn't true over the reals, too. It's not deep. You have to work with it. Talking about that, sometimes it's a good thing to think about. You look at the paths of productions and how do those give you unitarians? Well, roughly speaking, if you elevate projections in a path of projections connecting them in a, two projections are close and there's a partial isometry which goes from one to the other and it's even essentially unique.
00:12:30.340 - 00:13:10.152, Speaker B: You can take the product and look at the, because it's so close to being in projection, it will have a polar decomposition, be the product of the positive elements and, and partial. At some partial path, you break it up into a lot of short paths. You get a whole lot of partial isometries between the corresponding projections. And so you combine them. The partial isometry is going from here to here, here to here. There are arrows. You can just combine them.
00:13:10.152 - 00:14:12.892, Speaker B: Partial isometry going to carry, it's isometric on the production partial means and zero on the isolating confidence. And then the onto, you can think of what onto means. Action on the Hilbert space, that subspace. That's how you compose partial assumptions. And if you do keep on doing it all the way along the path, then you get a single partial solid going from the beginning to the end. And if, suppose that the end projection is the same as when you began. Okay, suppose that actually didn't stop here.
00:14:12.892 - 00:14:34.364, Speaker B: Went all the way around. Then you just go all the way around. You're parched. My solitary. All the ones in the short steps. Okay, well, this partial isometry will take this projection onto that one. That's called a partial unitary.
00:14:34.364 - 00:15:41.914, Speaker B: And so if you cut down by that projection, it's unitary inside the cut down altitude. And that's considered to be a fair game. That's a one l. Okay, so that's, so if you have a, if you look at the suspension then it's passed in the outer root unit of joint. So you took a path of projection, maybe in the two by two matrix algebra. This was production 10 zero in the algebra I have, oh, I do have an. All right, so we're looking at a path project here, back to here.
00:15:41.914 - 00:16:35.984, Speaker B: And it's, what's a, that's, it gives you k one of the suspension because it's a non unit of algebra. How do you define k one? You adjoin unit and it's k zero in a non unit to define. Everyone know you work with that. You have a non unit. If you do any units, then it's units off and you can define k zero in terms of production. Bring as a unit. Okay.
00:16:35.984 - 00:17:29.233, Speaker B: Then you somehow throw away the class of the unit, meaning if you take a multiply and complex multiple units, then you map it just to complex multiples of units. It will have you plus oh, you'll see. K goes to zero. This is, this is an algebra map. And because k zero is a function for unitil algebra is actually well known because k zero of this plus k zero of that. Well, and when it's complex numbers, k zero is non zero. The kernel won't be everything, it'll be a kernel.
00:17:29.233 - 00:19:38.424, Speaker B: And of course, and that's fine, because we're already one reason you have to do that is let's make the six term exact work. Now it's p one when you're doing the same thing, but actually that's zero numbers. You have to be careful, but have to do the same as the scalars real, what's an example of an invertible element of the real numbers? The algebra real numbers, which is not connected, which is not in the connected component of the identity. John, occupy. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yes, sure. And so the units, if you want k one of the suspension k one line, in terms unitarianism inverted.
00:19:38.424 - 00:21:31.224, Speaker B: And then voluntary justice says if you take v double suspension, then that's the same as, and of course that's the same as the same as suspension. This says that if you have a path, something in the suspension, in k zero, it is suspension. That's a math independent, connected component of that, unitary independence of how you construct it. That's an exercise, unitary, or verticals. Now, how do you go in the opposite direction? How do you get past the projections? How do you get a closed path of projection? Well, you can use matrices two by two matrix, and you notice two productions, 10, zero, and then zero, zero, one. There's a path connecting this plane, natural path. You just rotate, and it doesn't matter as long as the algebra has a unit, then it could be any algebra, even the real number.
00:21:31.224 - 00:23:06.684, Speaker B: Okay, the point is that the notation is defined, the equivalence equal to, which takes the second projection, first connection to productions. But if you suppose, you suppose instead of the exploitation of this reduction into this one, it's defined with respect to this partial isometry, okay? It goes from one to the other. Suppose that inside k, one of the algebra, you have a unitary, okay, so I keep telling people to sit close to the front and then you can't see. That's terrible. I mean, there was a screen in the way of prayer book. Well, yeah, actually that's not the cameras. No, no.
00:23:06.684 - 00:23:52.444, Speaker B: Okay, there's another screen here. All right. Okay, so what do we do? I mean, if the idea is very, very, very rough idea is you rotate from here to here, and then you rotate back again. But if you just go along the same path and that'll undo itself. Right. But suppose you go back by a different path. Suppose instead of rotating respect to 0100, if U was a unitary in a, didn't take the rotation with respect to the unitary.
00:23:52.444 - 00:24:00.724, Speaker B: Well, U is a one by one matrix and so put it in the upper right hand corner of the.
00:24:02.894 - 00:24:03.302, Speaker A: Another.
00:24:03.358 - 00:25:06.954, Speaker B: Way of going from the second production to the first. So you can rotate with respect to that. So rotate. And then that will take this one back to that one along a different path. And that gives you, if you check, then that combined path will give you back that unitary. Okay, if you apply this procedure to it and of course we're getting a closed path. So that's the, that's how you, I mean, if you're going to really roll up your sleeves and write the proof out, it might be, might take a little more than the five minutes I've been talking.
00:25:06.954 - 00:25:47.024, Speaker B: Okay, but that's, that's a good exercise. Okay, or you can look it up if you don't want to have fun, if you want it to be a chore, then you can look it up. Well, I don't know. So maybe some people, maybe that's fun. You have to find the right keyword. Okay, that's unique to complex scale. It's like showed y last time.
00:25:47.024 - 00:26:21.124, Speaker B: Extension I goes way close to the line. Apply it to k zero and you get some short sequence. Exactly. It's exact in the middle. That's not hard to prove. And same with t one in a short sequence. Well, very short.
00:26:21.124 - 00:26:40.214, Speaker B: It's not short. Exact sequence. Exact in all three places. And then you'd have zero groups. Zero for the other group. Won't pay one group, you don't have a filler zero at the end. It's not exact here and here.
00:26:40.214 - 00:26:56.946, Speaker B: Put the zeros in if you want, but you don't, you only get exactly what's in zero. Okay? And then you have, the reason the zero map is irrelevant is that what.
00:26:56.970 - 00:26:58.298, Speaker A: You really have is a map down.
00:26:58.346 - 00:28:03.024, Speaker B: To a first term of the left of the, and then the same here, this is in the convex scalers. And I said, well that's that one. And then the real scalers also get a polymer complex, but the mirror image is what. So this map is easy to construct with complex scales, as I showed last time, but prove exactness here and here. I don't really know how to do it in the general case. Okay, what you do is do it in a very, very special case, which gives you this k zero level suspension that's the same as k zero. You do that and then you notice that the k zero, because of the other thing, the k zero of s k one, k one s k zero.
00:28:03.024 - 00:29:10.742, Speaker B: Taking the suspension just flips. So you can flip this second index map going down here, prove that it's the same as the other map that I mentioned. Except the way to prove it is just to prove that this map has to be unique. Any map has to be unique. It's always there. I have a couple of papers on uniqueness of index math with k three. So that's how you do it.
00:29:10.742 - 00:30:10.144, Speaker B: In the general case, you forget about the special construction. So, but you, you do look at in the very special case where the a is. Well, I'll take, I'll call b instance. Or do you have, so I have, I want b to be the quotient. Then the cone want to be, be the larger than the suspension. This is a special case and it's going to tell us about the point is that what's the cone? Cone is suspension, by the way. Remember that it functions on the line into your batting algebra advantage of infinity.
00:30:10.144 - 00:31:34.934, Speaker B: Well, if, if you don't, if you just say bound and let's say functions that converge to something of infinity plus infinity minus infinity, and that's cone. Okay? And so you take limited questions and do that map on the b, and if you take the kernel and that's things that manage both suspension, it's easy to see that the cone is contractible. But the k groups are zero. The way you see that polling, here's a continuous one that converges in infinity. Then look at it on the interval instead of looking at it on open interval instead of an, extend the interval like this. Then extend the functions which to the left, extend them to be zero, left extended to zero to the right, extend the function to be constant. Okay.
00:31:34.934 - 00:32:39.574, Speaker B: And then this is the same algebra functions on the whole line, which are zero to the at zero and to the left of zero and a constant that one, if you take, and actually you now have a one family of maps from this algebra into itself. Okay, you just slide the graph to the right. Okay. And that's thinking of it as a, as continuous functions on the whole line. And slide the graph, just translate on the whole line. Then that means that this graph will move like this and after one unit of time it will be zero on the interval zero to one. Forget about what it is of the chart.
00:32:41.954 - 00:32:42.266, Speaker A: Then.
00:32:42.290 - 00:33:34.694, Speaker B: This is a continuous path, homologous, taking zero. So the k, the k in particular, k zero k one group of zero. If you look at this short exact sequence, you see, take the six term, exact sequence of a group. We don't have six terms yet. When we finish the six terms at the moment. Well, the terms are no six terms, but we don't have the complex index going. We just have the output.
00:33:34.694 - 00:35:19.480, Speaker B: Then that says we have two map from k one of b to k zero. Or so is get zero to the other side. So it's, and that's in either case. No, what we have is the. Okay, what am I actually trying to do? Not trying to prove periodicity from scratch, which is if we walk periodistically. Well, yeah, right. With the, with this index map, it always exists.
00:35:19.480 - 00:35:48.544, Speaker B: You do get that k one. Okay, so that takes care of that. So you don't have to, if you can prove that exactness, you don't have to go through this kind of long winded argument when I was talking. That's another way of doing it. There are two ways. Assuming that we can prove exactness. The two endpoints are for the ordinary index map.
00:35:48.544 - 00:36:15.154, Speaker B: That's not such a big deal. Well, this isn't such a big deal either. Maybe this is a little more elegant. That's more elementary. Dark. I can hardly see. Maybe it's because I'm getting the third degree.
00:36:15.154 - 00:37:17.500, Speaker B: Okay, but so we would get the, this is sort of block. We don't need it because we know we have another approach, the other one. What's interesting, and this applies. But then the, if you did have the other map. If we had the other map, that would say that k zero would be less decay one and s of b, which is the flip the use that to flip the diagram in the dental base. But conversely, if you. What that shows is this diagram in general case doesn't line by three distance.
00:37:17.500 - 00:38:21.544, Speaker B: That's why this is equivalent in the states. Equivalent of what? Three distance, six terms. I find this map, and eventually it turns, this turns out to be the map that you get from here to here in the map that I constructed in a larger way, because by uniqueness of just having a map look it up. So the standard approach then to proving bottom here. Very simple map. Exactly. Either place on either side of the map.
00:38:21.544 - 00:39:08.120, Speaker B: In the general case, it did some. It's tricky. I haven't actually seen how to do it. Okay, just by showing that you do get a map, by flipping that you'll be uniqueness of this connecting map. Of course, for every map, if you take minus, you multiply it by minus one into a beauty group that also has the same property. You take care of the same. Uniqueness means globally unique for all cases, up to a factor plus or minus one.
00:39:08.120 - 00:39:39.806, Speaker B: In fact, you're just saying it's a map. And twice the map would also work. So you have a map like this, defined in all cases in a natural way. Then it must be. Must be some multiple of the standard map. Okay. Some integer multiple in all cases, same area.
00:39:39.806 - 00:40:44.584, Speaker B: Therefore, you've got one coming from Bachburg. History is either plus or minus this silly one that I constructed. So, there's an exercise to check whether it's plus or minus, but that's enough to check on just one case. You take a case. Take this case again. So you look at the case where you can actually, like, there's a silly amount here. You even say that we take the silly amount here.
00:40:44.584 - 00:42:17.268, Speaker B: Okay, well, of course, we'll come back to this. There'll be questions. There'll be all kinds of questions. There's a notice, there's. Well, every Friday, there's this, there's the tutorial office hours, or there's almost no room. But fortunately, unfortunately, there are no windows for people to lean out. Referring to what the director of this program, the fields program that I mentioned 30 years ago when I filled all the offices overflowing, he said, well, I really like to accommodate your guests, even though there are a lot of trouble with business and stuff, and they may have to.
00:42:17.268 - 00:43:22.732, Speaker B: Someone may have to lean out the window. Okay, well, then, sometime, of course, I want to go back to the past. Very nice. Down to earth. What's the conclusion, by the way? What's the basic conclusion? The conclusion? The conclusion has nothing to do with k theory or system algebra. Just as a toxic measure, probably calling it positive measures. On the last time I covered a rough discussion, just about everything except, well, I didn't talk about the proof of crimes.
00:43:22.732 - 00:44:31.554, Speaker B: Theorem for extension. Theorem for wired vector spaces. Where are you at vector spaces? If you take positive multiple, eventually that gets used. And of course, just like the Hambanach theorem proved that there are two water structures and bothered ring for the. You take the Pascal triangle order, then it's easy to see what the positive functions are. That's just positive. That's just quite compatible positive numbers.
00:44:31.554 - 00:46:02.844, Speaker B: What did it bring then? Well, it just looked as what a group. What we want to do is compute the be able to apply crime's theorem to prove that a polynomial is positive in the order we're talking about. Strict point wise, strict positivity on the. We want to apply quience theorem then we really have to know what the states are. We have to know what the states are positive constant by state, I mean positive function which is equal to one on the unit. So, okay, so, by the way.
00:46:06.904 - 00:46:07.216, Speaker A: The.
00:46:07.240 - 00:47:32.720, Speaker B: Polynomial is positive in the sense that it's a finite sum of polynomials in x and one minus x. Then of course, and if the function was positive on point closer, those things are strictly positive on the open integral, they're non zero. So a function of which is positive on such things would be positive on the monomial string. If we want to go the other way around, we want to prove whether something is positive on the sums of binomials and it's positive one point wise, we want to show not only that it's positive and things that are should be positive in the interior, we want to show it's strictly positive and things that are strictly positive on closed universe, because Crohn's theorem only talks about things that are, that are typically positive for every function of the randomized. These order groups are lots of things that, lots of things that are zero for some function. And we can handle those. We can handle those because we just divide out by monomials.
00:47:32.720 - 00:49:00.744, Speaker B: So we get them to restrict, know that the something is strictly positive, something for such a thing, we want to know the point wise order. We want to know that every functional positive, intuitive thing, and what's obvious is if you take the things that can trickly positive on the closed interval, of course, every measuring, if you can, any measure on the interval zero one, then that will be strictly positive. Any non zero measure, power value measure, and it will be strictly positive when anything was strictly positive on the closing. But if it's okay. So what we have to do is prove that the states on polynomials with the point wise order, we have to prove that they're just evaluation of some measure on the closed interval. It sounds a lot like constructing a measure in the house dwarf moment problem. That's essentially what we're doing.
00:49:00.744 - 00:49:54.522, Speaker B: If you want the house dwarf moment problem says there is a measure with certain moments, right? Well, that's what this does. That's where that measure comes in. If you analyze things well, all right, we're close to the hill. Probably I shouldn't take advantage of the fact that there isn't literally a bell. I like to interpret things early. Okay. But so we have to show that, in particular, if we conclude that the extreme points fall, actually what we actually have to prove is that if you have something strictly positive, then the functional is strictly positive, one is strictly positive and opposing.
00:49:54.522 - 00:50:38.334, Speaker B: Well, it's enough to show it for the extreme points. Okay, enough to show it for the extreme points. If you do it for all extreme points, then you know it for the average of it, because there's a measurement average, I mean, arbitrary point in the compact context. So we want to know the extreme positive functions. That's just happens that extreme positive functionals are, in order to ring order unit extreme positive functionals are just, which are equal to one on the order unit.
00:50:38.374 - 00:50:38.954, Speaker A: Five.
00:50:41.784 - 00:51:30.954, Speaker B: Those functionals are exactly the homomorphisms into the real life. It's just exactly like community. The pure states, extreme states are, well, their homomorphisms into the complex number. Here it's into the real numbers. This gets used. Here it gets used. I just reviewed quickly the structure theorem of the community algebra, and I don't think it talks about homo organisms, of course, but then interpreting in terms of maximal ideals, maximum ideals, not in terms of care states.
00:51:30.954 - 00:52:12.464, Speaker B: So at the moment, I think it's just an interesting fact related to the basic theorem. You can check that. Okay. But here it's important. So we should actually check that we have an order ring, order unit ring, and you have a screen positive function, normalize extreme state. And then it is preserves products. Then if it preserves products, it's by x plus one minus x equals one.
00:52:12.464 - 00:52:51.104, Speaker B: So it's, these are positives. These are positive. So the value on x and one minus x will be something positive. And so have some one. So there will be some number between. That means on x, there would be five x between zero. And then for an arbitrary such number, you get a homomorphism, just point evaluation when this goes in, because something is strictly positive in the interior, it's at least positive on the whole cool thing.
00:52:51.104 - 00:54:23.028, Speaker B: All right, so that's the calculation of the, that's the basic proof of what the customer served. I'm not, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag yet, but in order to bring, how do you prove that a extreme state has to be, look at the case of a community of seastrogen. To prove that, look at the extreme state, it has to be more quick. And of course, both of those things you can work out with the ones that, any questions? Or lots of questions. Another thing I want to talk about. Okay, 50 projections from the quotient. If the ideal is a, in general, like exercise in the book to show you can't do it, in general, you definitely can't do, it's not even enough for the ideal to have k 10.
00:54:23.028 - 00:55:17.514, Speaker B: Okay, so because there are other properties of a that go into the proof. But using those other properties, it's triggered in comparison slightly technical, a couple of slightly technical limits, which none of our lifting productions. Just a special case. If you have an AEos algebra, any independent, and you have a reduction, get to join to it, not the unit, but at some projection you get to join to it. And then the resulting algebra, that's a special case of Af, is a portion of just complex number. And that's that we have to prove that particular algorithm that follows. You've already lifted the product.
00:55:17.514 - 00:56:33.382, Speaker B: So the technical limits, which I'm just doing, maybe I'm just going to assume them, but exactly for this, I knew I was going to spill something. What I wanted to do is just purely fun with non technical, applying some technical levels, but not permanent. So it's very easy to lose projections. As the six term max sequence says you this is zero. That means that you have certain activities. You can nift k zero elements. So therefore you should be able to nifty reduction and you actually can.
00:56:33.382 - 00:56:56.214, Speaker B: But it's an argument which has surprises. So it's entertaining. It's an entertaining. Too bad there's no exam, because it would be something nice to put on these days. And once, once we do a. Okay.
