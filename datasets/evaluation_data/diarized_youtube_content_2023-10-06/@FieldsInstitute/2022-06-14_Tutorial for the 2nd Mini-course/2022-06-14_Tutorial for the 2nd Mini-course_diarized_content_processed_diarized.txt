00:00:02.760 - 00:00:13.034, Speaker A: So it's a great pleasure to introduce Pei long seng, who will give the tutorial for free probability theory. Thank you.
00:00:13.854 - 00:00:50.394, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So this one, okay, hi, everyone. It's my pleasure that I can share some knowledge about free probability. Some basically like a structure and some example. Okay. Many of the material you will have seen, I mean, in the morning talk from Jamie. And by now I try to give some example in a.
00:00:50.394 - 00:00:57.454, Speaker B: Try to computing them. Okay, so this one, okay.
00:01:02.394 - 00:01:03.414, Speaker A: Oh, sorry.
00:01:04.794 - 00:01:32.258, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So the very basic framework of free probability, we, starting from ac, it's a pair, and which we call it non community probability space. And where, what's the a is just a unit of unit algebra. And over c, the feed will be a linear functional, which is sending a to c. And we assume that feature sending one to one. But now I try to give some more concrete example.
00:01:32.258 - 00:02:12.688, Speaker B: Okay, first, what's a sign example? It could be like the first one. How about we back to the classical probability setting and we consider the space, the a, we can choose by l infinity. Yeah, it's very clear. Like l infinity, space is also lg one, including the element one. But for l infinity space, we don't have something called moment distribution. I mean, moment is not a boundary. So we can make it like a little bigger.
00:02:12.688 - 00:02:21.794, Speaker B: Then usually we call l infinity negative, which is dividing by, we consider all lp space and dual intersection.
00:02:24.934 - 00:02:25.754, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:26.254 - 00:03:02.770, Speaker B: Okay. For such a space, it's clear, it's an algebra. And what's the property state we should use? I mean, what's a proper phi here we can use? There's a pretty natural way. We just choose in the expectation. Okay, yeah, let's the first example. So for this example, you can see, even though we say x is non community, but actually in this example, the model is community. You have if you're given two random variable x y, x times y is equal to y, ties to x.
00:03:02.770 - 00:03:19.144, Speaker B: So forward setting, we are here, we say non continuity probability space is the same. We're not. Force is non community. We just say it can be non communality. So how about a second example? Then we really given a non community example, then we consider a is.
00:03:25.844 - 00:03:26.156, Speaker A: Just.
00:03:26.180 - 00:03:28.504, Speaker B: How I can't place m by n matrix.
00:03:33.144 - 00:03:38.008, Speaker A: Is it an algebra? Is the second one an algebra?
00:03:38.096 - 00:03:58.764, Speaker B: Yeah, we force, I mean, it's intersection of. Oop. So if you have two elements, and if you sum, you do. Yeah, yeah. We forces intercession. Yeah, it will be algebra. Okay, so for a second example, we given a really non community example.
00:03:58.764 - 00:04:34.716, Speaker B: So if you have two random, sorry, if you have two matrix, we know like a type b, it may not be b types a. So this one is non continuity. Okay, what's the proper way? We given a proper phi for this model, we will hopefully phi is linear and sending one to one. So there's a very good option. It's called a trace. But if we do a trace, then we know we're given a matrix model, especially if we consider one, which is identity matrix. When we plug in identity matrix, this one gives you m.
00:04:34.716 - 00:04:40.372, Speaker B: It's not one anymore. So what we were going to do, we just normalize it?
00:04:40.508 - 00:04:41.252, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:41.428 - 00:05:15.254, Speaker B: Okay, so let's do a simple model for a non cumulative probability space. How about we combining both of them, which has a big slab, then we got one random machine model which is m, m, and we plug in the a here. So maybe we say l. Now we have a model which is m by m matrix. But each of the entries is not a complex number anymore, it's a random variable. And so for such a model, the phi is also clear. We will mix these 2ft together.
00:05:15.254 - 00:05:22.866, Speaker B: So we will do one of m trace. Okay, there are three simple model.
00:05:22.930 - 00:05:23.654, Speaker A: Okay?
00:05:25.754 - 00:05:47.650, Speaker B: Now when we have a non community probability space, the next thing for a given element, we can calculating all the possible moments and do something formal power series. Sorry, formal Lauren series. And this guy we call a continuous transform of a. Yeah. So here we all over the, uh, form are formally defined.
00:05:47.722 - 00:05:48.506, Speaker A: Okay?
00:05:48.690 - 00:06:19.886, Speaker B: And then when you have left CO2 transform. And this way we just computing the inverse composition of Ga. And we got something called Ga inverse is another formula for such guy. For this guy, if we substitute one over z, then we will call the r transform. R transform, yeah. And, um, you can observe that r transform will be, can be written down by also a formal power series and such code fusion, we will call a free cumulant sequence.
00:06:19.990 - 00:06:21.318, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah.
00:06:21.406 - 00:06:26.834, Speaker B: So let's very, uh, uptrend. So let's try to complete some concrete example.
00:06:32.854 - 00:06:41.026, Speaker A: This should be okay. Yeah. G, a inverse of z. Oh, it's.
00:06:41.050 - 00:06:45.774, Speaker B: A composition inverse of Ga. Oh.
00:06:49.634 - 00:06:49.970, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:50.002 - 00:07:07.806, Speaker B: This one. Yeah. So when you give an a, you can compute in the moment. Yeah, yeah. This way, n start from zero. So actually we starting from one over z plus fear over z squared and so on.
00:07:07.990 - 00:07:10.594, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:17.094 - 00:07:26.798, Speaker B: Okay. And then there was computing some concrete model. And this model actually play a very important role in free probability theory.
00:07:26.966 - 00:07:27.446, Speaker A: All right?
00:07:27.510 - 00:07:57.484, Speaker B: So for a given non combining probability space, also by the way, NCps is the abbreviation for non communality probability space. And we starting from a given element, we call such an element is a semicircle element. If it satisfies a rule which is the moment of such element. We are following the semicircle law. When we have these things. If we want to really understand this semicircle law, we want to catch. Okay, what's the cumulative.
00:07:57.484 - 00:08:35.954, Speaker B: What's the r transformation? If we want to catch r transform, we want to understand the inner cumulus, we have to starting from. By the process we see from previous slide, we were starting from the Cogit transform. So first Cauchy transform, we were starting computing the moment precisely. So in order doing that, first thing we can observe when x r is tribute, the other moment are. Yeah. For even case, if we let n equal to two k, then we can start calculating this one. Yeah, we do like a trunk triangular substitution.
00:08:35.954 - 00:08:48.538, Speaker B: Then we can see easily it can be written by this way. And the same size square is one minus cosine squared. So then we can rewrite it by the Ik minus I k plus one, where each of Ik is this one.
00:08:48.626 - 00:08:49.930, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:08:49.962 - 00:08:54.822, Speaker B: Some basic calculus. And based on this, now we try to study this guy.
00:08:54.958 - 00:08:55.634, Speaker A: So.
00:08:57.694 - 00:08:59.514, Speaker B: Sorry, there's something in chat.
00:09:04.494 - 00:09:05.594, Speaker A: It's okay.
00:09:07.934 - 00:09:33.378, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, let's keep it. Okay. Okay, so then we try to catch up these things. So then we just observe one scene from the first two lines. Cosine two k theta can be written by the e I theta plus e minus I theta. And we put in a two k outside and the language using the like binomial polynomial.
00:09:33.378 - 00:10:03.500, Speaker B: And we write it as binomial polynomial. Polynomial. Yeah, we write in by the right hand side. And we observe one thing, that if we focus on this guy and we do the integration from zero to PI, it's only survived when l is equal to zero. And hence, when we saw Lenfone, if we do the integration only wherever j equal to k was survived, so the ik will be exactly this one. And all other term will be killed. Yeah.
00:10:03.500 - 00:10:35.332, Speaker B: And hence, if we back to this formula, then we know from previous slide is four to the power k plus one times the ik minus ik plus one. But I k minus I k plus one, we know precisely in this guy. And we just combine them together, we can see a formula like this. And for the last, last part, we just dividing one over two PI. Then we got, what's the field? A two k, which is this form. Then it's like a well known. Guys, it's called case katara number.
00:10:35.332 - 00:10:59.324, Speaker B: Yeah, we got a katara number here. Okay, so now we have the moments. We want to know more. What's a Cauchy transform. So we go further. So we started from the Cogit transform and we write it formally and phi a n. Now we know precisely it only surviving when n is even.
00:10:59.324 - 00:11:17.084, Speaker B: And it's a catalan number. So we just write it precisely as a katala number. And let's have a very important property for katala number. The secant is precisely can be written by the sum of j from one to k. The c j minus one. And the c k minus j.
00:11:19.344 - 00:11:19.888, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:19.976 - 00:11:45.424, Speaker B: And now we can observe here we have two sum. Then we just for z two k plus one. We just split by two power half of them for c j minus one. And I have four c k minus j. Now, we do the interchange of the sum for this state to here. But after we done the interchange, we can see this one is precise. It's a cogit transform.
00:11:45.424 - 00:12:10.924, Speaker B: And after we derive this one as a CoGiT transform, then this another guy is also the code transform. So, which means we got a code transform. G is equal to one over z plus one over z g z g squared. Now we got a quadratic formula for the quadratance. The.
00:12:15.464 - 00:12:18.512, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Yeah.
00:12:18.648 - 00:12:41.558, Speaker B: So now we have a CO2 transform formula. Now we try to understanding. Okay, what's the precise of the three z looks like. So now let's move on to next page. So, when we have coefficient strong length, we can use in the in also quadratic form. So we can computing it precisely. By then, you can see it's easily, it's just z plus minus root.
00:12:41.558 - 00:13:10.548, Speaker B: Z squared minus four divided in two. Now we have two options. We can choose impulse or choose minus. But which one is the proper one we should choose. So here, actually, somehow I design, I have some cheating. Since l over here, we do the algebraic label. But if you go into the analytic label and we have the great orange part, we have such formula.
00:13:10.548 - 00:13:25.344, Speaker B: So even based on the orangey formula, we know the negative one will be the one we should choose. So, I mean, go to the analytical version means we consider starting from a compensable major.
00:13:26.284 - 00:13:27.024, Speaker A: So.
00:13:39.044 - 00:14:18.824, Speaker B: Yeah, it's starting from a major Wisconsin pole. And the Lakotu transform will be considered this way. And of course, we need consider Z such as well defined. So usually we will consider it an upper half plan. And based on this formula, and since it's a compatible, you can return this one as a power series again. And it will coincide with the formula as algebraically version. And furthermore, for analytical version, you can prove the orange part.
00:14:18.824 - 00:14:28.344, Speaker B: So that's why when we have Laplace and minus these two options. So by the analytical theory, we will know, okay, we should choose the negative one.
00:14:28.724 - 00:14:29.452, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:29.588 - 00:15:01.974, Speaker B: And as long as we have a CO2 transform precisely over there, then next thing we want to catch up. What's our transform? So first we have to computing the composition inverse. So for the composition inverse, we let in the GA equal to w, then we just invert computing them. Actually, the formula is very simple. The ga inverse just exactly z plus one over z. Now, r transform is dividing by g inverse minus one over z. So r transform will be nothing but z.
00:15:01.974 - 00:15:10.370, Speaker B: So you can see from the beginning it looks very complicated, but after you go through all this process, eventually r transform is very simple.
00:15:10.562 - 00:15:11.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:13.114 - 00:15:51.888, Speaker B: And when you have r transform and you try to return by a formal power series over here, then we can see the corresponding coefficient. The first guy kappa one is zero, kappa two is one and all other are zero. So we got the corresponding coefficient kappa m only surviving with n two, and all other will be killed. Okay, let's have one duration we can do in this, but how about we use in the partition to study this stuff? So, okay, so let me quickly recall some partition stuff.
00:15:52.016 - 00:15:52.728, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:52.896 - 00:16:18.014, Speaker B: So when we given an m, when we using the parenthesis m to means a set one up to m and we can consider, okay, the general partition on m, then we can consider another conan quasi partition on m, which is satisfy this rule. I mean, if you, they don't exist. A case the ijlk satulate ilo in a block, taking another block.
00:16:18.754 - 00:16:19.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:19.482 - 00:16:36.234, Speaker B: So, okay, I can draw some. Okay, so, so when you're given a PI, now you have I j.
00:16:38.494 - 00:16:40.114, Speaker A: Okay, yeah.
00:16:40.694 - 00:17:14.306, Speaker B: Name if Il in a block, jk in a block, which mean they were crossing. Okay, in the sense, then this is meaning what we say the crossing. So if this is not going to happen, we say this partition is non crossing. And another notation, if all non crossing partition, each will block only containing two elements, besides two elements, then we say it's non crossing period. We use in the NC sub two to represent this set.
00:17:14.450 - 00:17:15.254, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:16.374 - 00:17:56.734, Speaker B: And following on crossing period, there's an important fact is if you consider the number for a given m, what's the number of non cross impaired will be precise of the catalog number of n over two. So over here, of course, n should be even if it's r, there's no chance two has non quantity impaired. Yeah, sorry, I didn't write that down, but n needs to be even posture. Now I just write down a few examples here. So over the first one, you can see the graph if we have six element, and one, two, four is in one block. Three is singleton, five, six in a block. Now we have a three block.
00:17:56.734 - 00:18:21.404, Speaker B: You can see the graph is non crossing, so it's in the ansi six, but it's not period. How about the second one? This one, Ab, is crossing. So this one is in P six, but nothing in C six. And the third one is also non quasi, but we have two singleton, so it's not all pair rib. So it's in NC six, but not in NC 26.
00:18:21.784 - 00:18:22.248, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:22.296 - 00:18:25.804, Speaker B: And the last one is. The case is non quasi impaired.
00:18:26.904 - 00:18:28.484, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:31.624 - 00:18:40.064, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:18:44.044 - 00:18:49.264, Speaker A: Sort of understand the importance of this g. It's like trace of the result.
00:18:52.444 - 00:18:53.492, Speaker B: You mean coach?
00:18:53.668 - 00:19:01.594, Speaker A: Yeah. You write it in geometric series. What is the name?
00:19:03.124 - 00:19:11.228, Speaker B: R. Yeah. You will see the. Okay.
00:19:11.316 - 00:19:11.556, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:11.580 - 00:19:24.036, Speaker B: You will see. Maybe right away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So right now, if you focus only one element, it's not easy to see. What's the r? Play the rule. If you have two freedom variable.
00:19:24.100 - 00:19:24.580, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:24.692 - 00:19:42.334, Speaker B: I will play the important formula and we will see. Right that way. And at the end of this talk, I try to prove the central limb theory by using the r. Yeah. We'll be almost straightforward in the one line proof, you could say that.
00:20:18.414 - 00:20:43.754, Speaker A: Different function. So it's like. Thank you.
00:20:44.394 - 00:21:08.894, Speaker B: Thank you. Let's keep going. So, now, if we given a non communality property space, then the first few lines. Just a notation. And if we have a family of a multilinear functional, we call it fm. Then for each PI, for a given PI and a given sign element, a one up to m in a, then the f PI of a one up to m. We will divide it by this way.
00:21:08.894 - 00:21:10.514, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:10.934 - 00:21:11.270, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:11.302 - 00:21:21.350, Speaker B: It means for each of block, we just consider f of a sizeable block, and also a corresponding element. We just plug it into the function.
00:21:21.542 - 00:21:22.030, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:22.102 - 00:21:37.922, Speaker B: And then we just consider product. So it's a little vague. I give an example here. Okay. If a PI is such guys, is one up to six, and we know one, two, four in the block, three is a singleton, five. C is in another block. So one, two, four is in the same block.
00:21:37.922 - 00:22:02.734, Speaker B: So we have f three, since we have three elements here, and the corresponding guys, a one, a two and a four. And the second block is a three. It's only one element. So we have f one here, and the corresponding element is a three. And the last block is five six. So the size is two, and corresponding element, a five, a six. Then we just type multiple overlay together.
00:22:02.734 - 00:22:05.374, Speaker B: Then this guy we call f PI.
00:22:06.314 - 00:22:06.626, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:06.650 - 00:22:09.746, Speaker B: Just a recall from the Jamie's note.
00:22:09.810 - 00:22:11.434, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:22:11.594 - 00:22:32.468, Speaker B: Jamie's literature. Okay. And after this, we can define what's called a free cumulants. We will define really based on this formula we call a moment cumulant formula. So cumulants will be the family of a multilinear function. Yeah. And we were defining based on this formula.
00:22:32.636 - 00:22:34.140, Speaker A: Okay. Yep.
00:22:34.252 - 00:23:10.524, Speaker B: So. So I think it's a thing. And then we will use. So, next slide. Okay, so, yeah, as I mentioned, I will try to give another approach to proof for a semicircular element, how to compete in accumulates. Okay, so I just give a simple notation here. If we consider, we said before, if we consider phi a one, a to up to am, or if all are the same, it's just phi.
00:23:10.524 - 00:23:35.610, Speaker B: Then we just say vam. Then this is just a moment away. We're using the notation n and a. And similarly for cumulants, if kappa m, the all inside guy is a, then we just call kappa and a. Okay, it's called free cumulant of a. So as we saw before, if we have a semicircular element, then we can complete imprecisely for semicircle or corresponding moments. Is this one?
00:23:35.762 - 00:23:36.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:36.346 - 00:24:23.850, Speaker B: When n is even is catalan number over two, n is r is zero. How can we find this information? And using the moment cumulative formula we saw from previous slide to catch up with kappa nn is exactly the same we computing before. Okay, so let's see the proof. The proof is, we observe first the kappa one. What's an n one? N one is sum up. Or maybe I just write down formula here. Yeah, we know based on this formula, if we consider n one, the non crossing partition only have one element, which is kappa one.
00:24:23.850 - 00:24:39.644, Speaker B: So ny is kappa one. So it's nothing different. Ny is kappa one, but we know that ny is zero. So we false kappa y is zero. But how about n two? N two is kappa two and n two. If we have nc two. Now we have two options.
00:24:39.644 - 00:25:08.884, Speaker B: It can be one two in the same block, or we can have two singleton. Okay, so in this case will be kappa two. In this case, it's kappa one times kappa one. And hence we have the n two is kappa two plus kappa one squared. But we already know the comma, one is zero and length. By this formula, we can see kaba two have to be one. Okay, now if we keep going, we just can see.
00:25:08.884 - 00:25:18.520, Speaker B: Actually, I also skipped for the n is odd. N is odd is simple. Okay. Actually. Okay, let me keep going.
00:25:18.552 - 00:25:18.968, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:19.056 - 00:25:40.356, Speaker B: For even n, we know like n is a cutout number cn over two. But on the right hand side, we have a moment cumulant formula. For the moment cumulant formula, we consider all the possible PI in non crossing partition. Ncm. But now how about we split by two? Part one is the non crossing pairing. One is a non crossing partition, but not the pairing.
00:25:40.540 - 00:25:41.108, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:41.196 - 00:25:54.620, Speaker B: For an encroaching pairing part, we know all the phone is two element, two element, two element. And each of the two element, we're providing kaba two. Kaba two. So we have lots of kaba two. Each of kaba two is one. So we just. One times one times one.
00:25:54.620 - 00:26:19.274, Speaker B: So just get one. So actually, here we summing up all the non quasi impairment with the value one. And hence, it's just exactly the size of the non quasi impairment. And we saw before the non quasi impairment actually is cn over two. So we saw this formula. We saw one c, left hand side cn over two. Right hand side cn over two, plus something left.
00:26:19.274 - 00:26:35.608, Speaker B: So, which implies this stuff. The left thing is zero. And if you solve this zero now, it's easier. You just start to check it. When you plug in three. Actually plug in three. This is nothing but zero.
00:26:35.608 - 00:26:57.352, Speaker B: If you consider three, then this guy, you write that down. Is all of this. You can see only all the element is containing a singleton. So we'll force it becomes zero. So all of length are zero. Length, which falls kappa three is also zero. Now, if you go to another equal to four.
00:26:57.352 - 00:27:19.654, Speaker B: So we have a kaba four and plus last washing, but cannot be paired. If it cannot be paired with means each of the kappa will contain kappa PI will contain a singleton or some element with three element. Then we'll false each of them will be zero again. So we just go this process. We can see all of lamb will be zero.
00:27:20.234 - 00:27:21.282, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:27:21.298 - 00:27:23.294, Speaker B: Let's sketch over proof.
00:27:24.234 - 00:27:24.674, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:24.714 - 00:27:34.794, Speaker B: Lam sorry. Okay, let's move on to freedom.
00:27:34.914 - 00:27:35.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:41.574 - 00:28:06.354, Speaker B: Okay, so for the freedom, maybe first let me do cola than phoenicia. If you have a few sub algebra. Are you thinking? You said they are free sub algebra, that's free.
00:28:07.874 - 00:28:08.546, Speaker A: If.
00:28:08.690 - 00:28:33.734, Speaker B: Okay, so we say that free is if we have four in k. And we consider the index set I one, I two up to IK. And each of them is from one up to m. Then we assume, okay, all index I one is different than I two. I two is different than I three. Which means all other JSOn elements from different algebra.
00:28:34.654 - 00:28:35.434, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:36.014 - 00:28:55.754, Speaker B: In this definition, we don't really care about I one I three. They came from the same algebra, but just different. I one I two needs to be different. I do. I see the ij, IJ plus one. And for each of the Aij, we're choosing element aj from the aij. And we force it to be centered.
00:28:55.754 - 00:29:10.114, Speaker B: And under this definition, we want this thing happen feed of a one, a two, up to a. Okay, I think it's zero.
00:29:11.174 - 00:29:11.782, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:11.878 - 00:29:45.576, Speaker B: There is a definition of readiness. But this one can be used to manipulate to using user definition to computing the mixed moment. Okay, so how to use this one to complete the missed moment? Let me, let me quickly show some example. This is the first one. And second. So let's freedomness of sub algebra. How about freedom of two elements? We say two elements are free.
00:29:45.576 - 00:30:29.170, Speaker B: If all some elements are free. If you're algebra generating by x and algebra generating by y are three. Okay, so definition over element of free is just based on the definition of algebra generating by x and y. Okay, and now maybe let me quickly. Okay, quickly catch up. Very simple example. If you have x, y, you know, like for the classical independence, it plays a very, very important role to understanding how to under.
00:30:29.170 - 00:30:58.874, Speaker B: How to complete it in a mixed moment. So over here we can see, okay, if we layer three, whether we can play the same game. And to see how to compete in the phy. And based on this definition. So first, if you want to complete in these things, but if we want to use this definition, all of that needs to be centered. Like here, they are not centered. So we can do something.
00:30:58.874 - 00:31:14.374, Speaker B: We just consider this one. Oh, sorry. Let me. Using Ab X. Absolutely. Okay. So we can consider this one instead.
00:31:14.374 - 00:31:25.298, Speaker B: So let's observe. This is. Oh, sorry. Va one, to be more precise. Vb one.
00:31:25.346 - 00:31:25.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:26.114 - 00:31:46.084, Speaker B: So Va is a compass number type one. Okay, so this guy is a minus Va one. This one is b minus vb one. And if you consider phi of this one is zero. If you have this one, it's zero. Okay, so by this definition, zero. And based on this.
00:31:46.084 - 00:31:57.024, Speaker B: Okay, if you want to, then if you expand in, then they totally have four times. You can do some cancellation. They can easily see. VIP is vip.
00:32:00.884 - 00:32:01.404, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:01.484 - 00:32:29.454, Speaker B: It's exactly the same as classical setting, classical case. Yeah, sorry. So of course, we can go further to consider what's the V, Abab, AB and so on. Yeah. So over here you can see, you may guess. Oh, it's just a classical independent. Actually, when you consider Abab, it will be little different.
00:32:29.454 - 00:33:02.914, Speaker B: Very different. But usually the way we computing we will based on the same formula, we can do it again, but it's mainly time. So how about we change your way. We have other way to doing this by using the woman, by using the cumulant we just showed. We just see before. Okay, but if just using the cumulants you written as a sound. Now we have a four element, so it's NC four PI of Ab.
00:33:02.914 - 00:33:22.674, Speaker B: All right, will be this one. And we want to catch up all of them. It's still many turn. We can see the NC four still have many in turn. But that's one good thing. We assume they are free. Then we can back to see this formula here.
00:33:22.674 - 00:33:50.824, Speaker B: This is a very important result for accumulants. If some sub algebra there are three, then it has an equivalent condition for a cumulative. It's saying that the kappa n of a one up to a needs to be zero. Assumes not all of a one up to a m from the same ao Jupiter. So this one can be understanding us. This sentence widdleness is equivalent to vanishable missing cumulus.
00:33:50.974 - 00:33:51.396, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:51.460 - 00:34:38.364, Speaker B: So as long as you consider the cumulative and a one up to m, if they are not from some as, then the carbon should be zero. Needs to be zero. Okay, then let's try to see based on this formula whether we can really quickly solve this problem. Okay, so maybe we can list the all blend and see four. So what's the first one? And we can have a three and a one. Three and a one. Three and one and three and the one and the.
00:34:38.364 - 00:35:09.683, Speaker B: Yes. Three and one. Now we have 2222. Can be this one or can be this one. And there's four, two, two and 211-212-1213 and. Okay, 121413, I think, yeah. Make two of singleton.
00:35:09.683 - 00:35:22.924, Speaker B: Two obstacles. One, two. Yeah, yeah. Okay, thank you. Okay, I think we're almost done. Right then. 1234.
00:35:22.924 - 00:35:52.734, Speaker B: What else do I miss anything? Yes, thank you. I think, let's say. No, I think this one we have already three, four as a singleton. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. That's everything, right?
00:35:54.594 - 00:35:54.978, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:55.026 - 00:36:12.444, Speaker B: 14. Yeah. Correct. Okay, so now let's based on this way, we know it's Abab. So here is Abab. So Abab in the same block, according to the formula we have, it needs to be zero. Okay, let me change your color.
00:36:12.444 - 00:36:17.768, Speaker B: Kill, then Aba. So we mix the a and b.
00:36:17.896 - 00:36:18.496, Speaker A: Kill.
00:36:18.640 - 00:36:30.724, Speaker B: So you can see, as long as we have three elements, then there's no chance to survive. So we can kill lots of things. Abab, kill. Abab, kill. Abab. Kale.
00:36:30.804 - 00:36:31.372, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:31.508 - 00:36:36.884, Speaker B: Abab, survive, survive, survive. Kale.
00:36:37.004 - 00:36:38.704, Speaker A: Kale. Right.
00:36:39.124 - 00:36:57.336, Speaker B: You can see it looks like we have do something up so many times, but eventually we only sound three things. And what's length, what's layer? So they are these two, kappa two. So it's kappa one a square, kappa.
00:36:57.400 - 00:36:59.484, Speaker A: Two bb.
00:37:01.264 - 00:37:16.244, Speaker B: Is this one. And another one is kappa one b squared. Kappa two aa. And last one is kappa one a square. Kappa two. Sorry. Kappa one b squared.
00:37:18.384 - 00:37:18.976, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:19.080 - 00:37:55.674, Speaker B: And now we also know some node. The kappa one is n one. And the kappa two is the balance, which is n two minus n one squared. Okay, so we can deride in this one. So maybe I jump to the result. So after u downlet, you will see it's a square, phi b square outside plus v eight square outside. B inside minus both outside.
00:37:55.674 - 00:38:08.034, Speaker B: Sorry, which one?
00:38:09.334 - 00:38:10.274, Speaker A: Which one?
00:38:11.334 - 00:38:25.014, Speaker B: Oh, you mean this one? Since Abab, in the same block, it's kappa four abab. And in this formula, as long as a and b in the same, in the same kappa, they should be zero.
00:38:26.314 - 00:38:26.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:26.722 - 00:38:34.334, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's a very poor way, but. Okay, so on one hand, we know the phi ab is this formula.
00:38:37.514 - 00:38:37.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:37.882 - 00:39:21.082, Speaker B: Is this formula. Let's buy friedenance. And now we can asking a question. If it is also Ab, are classical independent, what's going to happen? So if it's also classical independent means this one. We know classical independent means layer commute here will be phi a squared, b squared. And we can divide by phi a squared, v e squared, if it is true independent. Now we have a formula that this one equal to this one.
00:39:21.082 - 00:39:47.142, Speaker B: If you combine in length, then you will see a very cool thing. It's va squared minus va squared times vb squared. Minus Vb squared is zero. But what we know, this is positive. This is positive. Two positive thing ties together is equal to zero. And fourth, one needs to be zero.
00:39:47.142 - 00:39:56.154, Speaker B: But what's the meaning this one going to be zero. It's a variance. So variance is zero. Then it only can be constant.
00:39:57.854 - 00:39:58.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:58.262 - 00:40:29.036, Speaker B: So that's why for a model, as long as the a and b are at the same time, free independent and classical independent only whenever one blend is to be constant. Okay, so now we back to here. Okay, now let's back to here. We give a small node. So if abr three. Abr three. And we back to the r transform.
00:40:29.036 - 00:40:48.284, Speaker B: Okay, okay. Ra b. We know. Okay, we just write down as definition as this way. And about kappa n plus one, we know it's multilinear, so it can be written by several term. Yeah. We have the term which is kappa m over length a and another is over length b.
00:40:48.284 - 00:41:04.600, Speaker B: And we have a last one missing term. And the b are missing but we know a and b are free, so false. The old missing term will be disappear. Will disappear. Okay, so eventually a plus b is nothing but a plus rb.
00:41:04.792 - 00:41:05.072, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:05.088 - 00:41:05.632, Speaker B: It's linear.
00:41:05.688 - 00:41:06.324, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:07.424 - 00:41:18.974, Speaker B: Okay, so yeah, yeah.
00:41:21.994 - 00:41:22.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:22.362 - 00:41:32.562, Speaker B: We just observe our code transform is how to see how can we understand in the x plus. Yeah, but if we invert to our transform, it's very simple.
00:41:32.618 - 00:41:33.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:34.154 - 00:42:17.854, Speaker B: Okay. So for the last slide, we try to using this formula to catch up the free central limit theorem. All right, so for the free central, since we define algebraically, so we started from a non community probability space, and we're given several of elements. We assume they are free and we assume also they are identical distribution. So which means all of them share the same moments. Now we further assume they are centered and the balance is one just 2000 normalized. And based on loss assumption, we consider SM, which is one over load n of a one up to am.
00:42:17.854 - 00:42:42.546, Speaker B: And we can prove free central limiting series, saying that Sn will converge to a standard semicircle loan. So since here we are saying in algebraic sense, so means that the field by SNK, the moment of SNK, will converge precisely to the moment of standard semicircle law, which is this one.
00:42:42.610 - 00:42:44.494, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah.
00:42:46.714 - 00:43:08.144, Speaker B: Okay. So how to prove it? It seems very complicated, but now we have r transform, so it becomes very easy. So we starting from under RSN Z. Okay. And we know Sn is precisely the one valued m of a one plus up to m. Now here I missing something. Okay, let me quickly show.
00:43:08.144 - 00:43:59.314, Speaker B: Since alpha transform is multilinear of alpha a z by the formula we know is kappa one of alpha a and the plus kappa two of alpha a, alpha a of z, and so on. Kappa M plus one alpha a, also alpha a and then z to the n. So here m plus one times. Okay, so now we know that each of the kappa are multilinear, so we can pulling out alpha. So for first one, we're pulling out alpha. Here, we're pulling out each of them. We can pulling out the first alpha.
00:43:59.314 - 00:44:15.634, Speaker B: So we will get alpha of kappa one of a second one. We just merge with alpha with z. Okay, we do the same thing. We're pulling out one alpha. How we remain an alpha. We just merge with z. So we got the formula.
00:44:15.634 - 00:44:48.210, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. This one is unlimited. So we can see. Okay, what's this one? It's exactly the cogit transform of r r a, alpha of ra. But inside, guys, we choose it's alpha z instead of z.
00:44:48.282 - 00:44:51.222, Speaker A: So it's Alpha Z. Yeah.
00:44:51.278 - 00:45:12.430, Speaker B: So we have this formula. Okay, so this is the second line come from. So, if we have this one, we just. Yeah, we just pulling this out. One value n and another. We have to replace the z by one loop and z. Now, over here, we.
00:45:12.430 - 00:45:34.984, Speaker B: Up to here, we assume since they are free independent, so will be a sum of ra, one plus I, two plus up to ram. But each of them have the same distribution. So all just I. They are the same. But we repeating entice. So now we just have antiserm load n. So we got load n here.
00:45:34.984 - 00:45:44.904, Speaker B: Now we just expanding I precisely by the accumulate. Oh, sorry. By a power series. Then we can observe here.
00:45:46.644 - 00:45:47.140, Speaker A: Over here.
00:45:47.172 - 00:46:00.908, Speaker B: Kaba one is nothing. But the first moment. The first moment. By our assumption, phi a one is zero. So this guy k is zero. How about kaba two? Kaba two is a variance. So it's n two minus n one squared.
00:46:00.908 - 00:46:02.304, Speaker B: This one is zero again.
00:46:02.924 - 00:46:03.356, Speaker A: So.
00:46:03.420 - 00:46:28.576, Speaker B: But this one, we know is 1 second moment is one. And how about the remaining term? We don't really care because you can see here, it's loot n to the two. So it's one over m. And then so on the power, we are getting bigger for the denominator. But from the beginning, we only have load m. So when loop n ties over all of them. And the loot n will cancel over load n.
00:46:28.576 - 00:46:43.644, Speaker B: So we got z here. How about remaining one? This one will tends to zero, where n tends to infinity. So eventually, we only got something called z, which is zero plus z plus zero. Zero.
00:46:44.304 - 00:46:44.824, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:44.904 - 00:46:56.524, Speaker B: So then we catch up the free cumulants for a semicircle law. Then we have a moment. Cumulant formula. We can invert back to garden.
00:46:56.984 - 00:46:57.504, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:57.584 - 00:46:59.112, Speaker B: Gather the moment.
00:46:59.168 - 00:46:59.664, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:59.784 - 00:47:05.084, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's a very, very standard way. And also a very.
00:47:06.854 - 00:47:07.634, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:08.774 - 00:47:10.990, Speaker B: Very cool about arch hand song.
00:47:11.062 - 00:47:11.714, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:12.694 - 00:47:30.070, Speaker B: And that's it. And the last thing I want to mention. Yeah. You can find all this material from the Andu and Lawrence book. It's very organized, very good to read. And thank you for your attention.
00:47:30.222 - 00:47:31.434, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:47:48.644 - 00:47:49.572, Speaker B: Convergent rate.
00:47:49.628 - 00:47:51.224, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:47:52.204 - 00:48:08.444, Speaker B: Will be very sound analytical approach. Yes, yes, yes. There's something called free bounding motion.
00:48:08.784 - 00:48:10.560, Speaker A: How do they construct it?
00:48:10.752 - 00:48:23.524, Speaker B: They starting from a single finite binomial algebra, if I remember. Correct. And then the thing is X plus Xi minus XJ. It's not considered as a normal.
00:48:23.964 - 00:48:24.324, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:24.364 - 00:48:34.984, Speaker B: Will be considered semicircular with a balance by the difference of the r minus s. Yeah, yeah. And then we now assume they are independent. We assume they are free independent. And we can.
00:48:49.304 - 00:49:02.280, Speaker A: Yeah. And also the distribution. So if you take different at different times, the distribution of the different should be semicircular or suitable variance instead of Gavin. Yeah.
00:49:02.312 - 00:49:03.112, Speaker B: And you prove it.
00:49:03.168 - 00:49:18.944, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's Bjarne and Spiker. Yeah, but Jenn and Spiker really do integration. Yeah. Against the brownian motion. So they do like stochastica.
00:49:28.164 - 00:49:29.424, Speaker B: Free gaussian.
00:49:30.204 - 00:52:09.784, Speaker A: Free gaussian. I asked Jamie pursue even some attempts to make some. It's not really. What do you mean? In the free variant. Okay, very good. So any other questions? Yeah, it's up to the moment. You need some deviation using some.
00:52:09.784 - 00:54:02.274, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, so probably ask about subalge, larger or random variable, um, like, know speculation and conditional expectation and finite case. So then racial trivial. So there are some things you can. There's no free zero. One. Just so that, you know, it's not everything.
00:54:15.714 - 00:54:16.290, Speaker B: Okay.
00:54:16.362 - 00:54:42.762, Speaker A: Are there any other questions? So before we thank me, say again that I'm wine and cheese courtesy of my department. All of you are quiet because of you. So it's at 06:00 p.m. So we have to set things up and stuff. So we have like 25 minutes free. And we can then go into finances. Let's thank Neville for a great.
00:54:42.938 - 00:54:48.714, Speaker B: Thank you. Stop sharing.
