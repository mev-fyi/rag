00:00:00.760 - 00:00:45.764, Speaker A: Does anyone want to hear any more of the Israel Halpern story? Okay, why don't I. Just a bit. Or the interview. The interview is a little more alive. Right? Okay. But they're both pretty lively, I would say so. We were just looking at the discussion about phenomenon.
00:00:45.764 - 00:01:23.914, Speaker A: Wigner, by the way, you might want to look up. I mean, phenomenon and Wigner are both important characters, both important personnel. Personnel personages of the 20th century. And the American Mathematical Society has a movie about funding which you could probably get up, bring up on the web. And part of it is an interview with Bigner. And I think it might be in this interview that he. That he tells the story of a joke he played on von Lee Min once.
00:01:23.914 - 00:01:54.494, Speaker A: And that's. You can decide yourself how funny it is. Okay. It was a brain teaser. You have two. It's probably apparent guidance. You have two locomotives on the same track running towards each other at each one going at 50 miles an hour.
00:01:54.494 - 00:02:35.554, Speaker A: And there's a bee flying back and forth between them, say, oh, and they're 100 miles apart. Okay. And there's a bee. To begin with, the two locomotives are 100 miles apart. I work in miles, I think in miles. And there's a bee flying back and forth between them, between the two locomotives. The question is, how far does the bee fly? Okay, well, this story isn't over.
00:02:35.554 - 00:02:56.458, Speaker A: The story continues. But von Neumann answered immediately, and Wigner said, oh, you saw the trick. Okay, well, how many people see the trick? Yeah. Right? Yeah. Do you want to explain that, Vince?
00:02:56.546 - 00:03:03.946, Speaker B: I guess you also need to speed up the deep beam, but because they're exactly 100 miles apart and they're both 50 miles, it flies for 1 hour regardless of how many times.
00:03:04.130 - 00:03:06.254, Speaker A: Okay, so the bee flies how far?
00:03:07.034 - 00:03:09.546, Speaker B: I guess depends on the speed of the b, I guess.
00:03:09.570 - 00:03:23.580, Speaker A: No, I put that in. That was 100 miles an hour, right? A bit. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Okay, so this is something that. It's believable.
00:03:23.580 - 00:04:06.212, Speaker A: It's believable that someone would see it quickly and get the answer quickly. Right, okay. But Vaneman's reply to that was, what trick? Simple charismatical theory, I guess. Arithmetic or geometric? I don't even know. Reverse, maybe reverse geometric. You know, I should be able to see something like that. Right? Any.
00:04:06.212 - 00:05:27.980, Speaker A: But if someone wants to comment later today, whether it's exponential, whether it's linear or geometric, my guess is it has to be linear because it doesn't seem to be too much exponential. And our last discussion was, how do you define the inner product? So ask Robertson. How do you define the inner product. If you have complex numbers, and we've agreed that complex numbers are important, for instance, even important not because they're more complex, because things, they make things simpler. The group of invertible elements is connected first, so the k one group is zero. You have to check matrices too, that the group of invertible matrices is connected to complex. Everyone clear how to do that? You've got to use the, but use polar decomposition.
00:05:27.980 - 00:07:46.754, Speaker A: Every invertible is a product of a unitary and an invertible positive operator, and both of these are diagonalized, and the diagonal ones are easy to connect to the identity. If you didn't know foliar decomposition, it would be, might be, and also use polar decomposition in the formula for integration, but multivariable integration that you do, how does the linear transformation affect the integral? Well, what's important is the determinant. Of course you have to evaluate the determinant, but how do you see that? Well, one way is to show there's a multilinear relation coming in at the end of the, but it's much easier just to realize that it's certainly, that it's just going to be iterated. If you change variables twice, then you multiply by two numbers, and what's determined, I guess, is the only multiplicative functions on matrices. But to prove that that works, you've got to able to show, you got to be able to show that the determinant determines how you, how you, that's a good name for the determinant determines, okay, but it does determine to prove the determinacy of how to change the variables. Doctor, if you want to show that Yonti's held a matrix is a product of unitary and positive, this is true for matrices with real entries, too. Okay, Tucker, did you participate in the activities that went on, such as those in the common room? Oh, yes.
00:07:46.754 - 00:08:41.134, Speaker A: The common room was a wonderful place. As I said, we were all poor, all the students were poor, but I didn't see any trace of competition or affection to me. We were all monks in a monastery, all working with the purest motives to discover mathematics and to share it with others. Coleman room was a very lively place. Those were the days when refugees were coming out of Europe, and those in mathematics seemed to head first for Princeton because the institute, the university's math department, revoked their tremendous concentration of town without we wouldn't see a new face and ask who that was. And the answer would be some mathematician we've heard of who was a great researcher. Was Stan Ulam around at that point? He wasn't around when I came.
00:08:41.134 - 00:08:59.610, Speaker A: He arrived later. In fact, when he arrived, I was deputized to show him around. I remember taking him, among other places, to the gym where you could go swimming. I enjoyed swimming enormously. So with great satisfaction, I showed two lamb possibilities. Going swimming. He turned his nose up with that.
00:08:59.610 - 00:10:00.204, Speaker A: He wasn't interested in an interesting autobiography and one of the. I guess, I think we just discussed the Monte Carlo method. This was a method for doing computations with limited resources, which later developed I used in the Tommy bomb project. Tucker, I think Bev Blaine had me meet Ulam when he arrived by boat. Might you have come along with me on that trip? No. The first time I saw Ulam was when I was called by left shots and told to take Ulav around and show him a christian. Even just reading something like this after 100 years, it's just, it's really.
00:10:00.204 - 00:10:44.220, Speaker A: I find it quite fascinating to just see the names appearing to all of you. Another one being left sheds. Probably everyone has heard of the left shet's fixed point. Oh, okay. So what. What did we talk about last time? Well, one of the things we talked about last time. So what's very works for any complex panic algebra.
00:10:44.220 - 00:11:28.922, Speaker A: Right. By the way, I'm taking it for granted that now that in the early days there were people sitting very far back. But I'm taking it for granted now that everyone can hear me. And I think the broadcast. Broadcast recording. Okay, so what's the simplest non zero banach algorithm? I mean, I guess zero is a battleground. It's a little contrary density.
00:11:28.922 - 00:11:51.246, Speaker A: Everything would be. Most things would be zero. We're looking at complex balance. What's the arc of prabha? What's the next most simple battle complex? Plane. Yeah, yeah. Right. And when you say plane, of course you can multiply complex numbers and you can see how to do it in a plane.
00:11:51.246 - 00:12:12.656, Speaker A: Right. You multiply by I. But what geometric operation is multiplying by this square root of minus one? PI by which. Yeah. Okay. PI over two or PI over four? PI over two. Okay, good.
00:12:12.656 - 00:12:50.534, Speaker A: Thank you. PI is 180 degrees, I think in degrees. I used to even carry a protractor around. But there are two square roots of minus one. Right. Would it be the same for both of them? So the difference is that one of them is minus the other. Right.
00:12:50.534 - 00:13:31.674, Speaker A: One of them is the negative of the other. And what does the one point by minus one dot? It sort of flips through the origin. And so if you rotate one way, then flip, it's the same as rotating the other way. Okay, good. Okay, so the complex numbers form a field and then, and any field has a k zero group. I guess we've agreed that the k zero group is always the same for a field. The k one group varies a lot from different fields.
00:13:31.674 - 00:15:13.332, Speaker A: The real numbers, it's not zero for the complex numbers, it's zero. And what about if we start taking suspensions, if we take the suspension of the algebra complex number that's continuous functions on the, well, you always have to decide which is more convenient. Talk about functions on a line or functions on the circle zero with a .0 point, I guess tension would be on the circle. It would be, it's easier to understand winding a unit to continuous function on a circle. Finding should be, and if you just look at the suspended algebra functions, complex value functions in a circle which are zero at the special point one. On the, if you do any unit, then function, which is functions, arbitrary values at special.
00:15:13.332 - 00:16:28.876, Speaker A: .2 so it's arbitrary values everywhere, it's all continuous contact value on the circle. And that if you want to look at invertible elements, and I guess we've agreed. But since if you look at continuous functions from several complex numbers, s one, any function s one going to s one is a complex value function. If it's the identity function function z of z equals z. Because any, any homotopy classes of functions, that's one, then you can have any power. And that's, that's how the integers come in.
00:16:28.876 - 00:18:26.632, Speaker A: That's why the integers want to know what k one of the one move up. And that's what, after all, that's what this, that's the quadrature. K one on the suspension is the same as k zero in the output, which is z zero of the complex operation. Okay, so we're getting enough k one elements to get zed. Okay, we want, well, if we take the homotopy theory maps from the circle to itself, we take that for granted. And there's a trick for considering those, right? You look at maps in the circle, you can think of those maps from the real life. And if it's maps, so, and then there'd be maps such that the, say the, they were talking about maps which take the special point to the special point.
00:18:26.632 - 00:19:44.404, Speaker A: Then the maps r into the circle would take zero into the special point, and then they could take, and if you stretch this flat, then the arbitrary map would be, you can see the arbitrary map is only talking to one, which is just linear. That's where they live to the end. This would be n. Let's say that that's elementary. We can take that for granted. But why is that, why does that not true for the complex numbers we want to get? Obviously, this is where you're going to get this, Ed, if it's true. But for instance, how do we know that? We just looked at, you know, when we go to matrices and put that in the upper left hand corner.
00:19:44.404 - 00:22:09.524, Speaker A: Now, turns out that this is not as bad as you might. There's an easy proof of this, okay? It doesn't apply for general sea structure, particularly complex number, because it proved for the complex numbers that this is never, this is never true to the end. That's the infrared none. So never going to be how large ranking they go to is not going to be homo topic, trivial, goes back just a single concept. So would anyone want to suggest what an simple argument might be? And let me, let me say this much by way of a hint. We've already, we've already discussed the determinant today, and the determinant is obviously quite important. Well, there's an argument involving the determinant that if you take z zero, zero one, and it's not homo to that closed path on the circle, z goes z zero, zero one, that passes, not the homotopic to a constant path.
00:22:09.524 - 00:23:06.970, Speaker A: What's the, what's the trick? Okay. If some of you are particularly fast and ambitious, you might say, what trick? Okay, yes, that's, you saw the trick, okay. But if you don't see the trick, that means you've got to go through the whole proof of injectivity for Bach periodicity. This is a case of injectivity which we haven't even discussed. We've discussed surjectivity for the general Bach periodistic map going from k zero, the algebra to k one, and the suspension. And we've discussed very roughly how to prove that proof that that map is surjective. We haven't discussed the proof that it's injected.
00:23:06.970 - 00:25:02.274, Speaker A: Well, it turns out that that's no worse. If that's a compliment, it's no worse than the proof of surjectivity because you can deduce it from surjectivity applied to, applied to the pass parameterized by the interim. So in the general case it's true, by the general proof, it's true that this is the endless path to the ends, which is exactly saying that this, this path is not on the top either in m two or in m 100, of any size or matrix through invertibles. As an inverter, you want to do fairly elaborate argument. The elaborate a number of other proofs. By the way, if someone is thinking of an essay, either essay number one or two or three, then worthwhile looking up another interesting to look up another proof of what approach the title has the word Heisenberg. That should be enough.
00:25:02.274 - 00:25:51.520, Speaker A: But in the case of. Well, we're not finished yet, we haven't proved sur deactivity. Right. So what occupy is pointing out is that if you get injectivity, that this path is homotopically trivial. It's determinant, which is also a closed path of complex numbers, not real complex numbers, that would be homotopic material through as opposed as of invertible non zero complex number. But we know that z to the nth is not. That follows from this, what we're calling elementary picture.
00:25:51.520 - 00:26:55.280, Speaker A: Okay. Elementary plane geometry. And of course at some point someone might want to see a proof of what goes on here. Actual calculation of momentoki classes. Sorry. From the continuous maps from s one to s one. Okay, so is everyone happy with the determinant proof then? That activity relapsed from k zero k one is what breaks down for other rings.
00:26:55.280 - 00:27:49.394, Speaker A: If we didn't have. Well, that's a very good question, but we're the determinant of a matrix. It's a familiar object when the matrix has entries in the field, right? And also, in fact, if the matrix has entries in a commutative algebra, then the same properties hold. But if entries are in a non communitive algebra, then you're out of luck. Okay, so that you have to go through a lot of work then, and we have to do that work anyway. We want to prove that an arbitrary path is homotopic to one of these. Okay, that's the other side of the coin, that the math is not in the index.
00:27:49.394 - 00:29:16.724, Speaker A: First thing you prove, actually, interactivity. Let's try move inductive regions by group theory, because, well, trouble, this might be, this might be a, this group might, for all we know, this group might be zero. Then as long as it's not, as soon as we know that this is not zero, this one piece is not zero, then we have a map from z into something which is, well, it might be zero. It might be zero on something. If it's not zero on any of them, it's not zero on any of them, then it's going to be injected because we know, we know what domain is injected. You only have to prove, you know, what the elements of the domain are. You just have to prove that each, each integer mapping something non zero.
00:29:16.724 - 00:30:31.230, Speaker A: Okay, they're permanent arguments. Taken care of. Search activity. Well, as far, as far as I know, you have to do the reshib's question now takes root. There's nothing that really seems to distinguish the complex numbers from the general you might think. So you have to show you have a closed path of invertible matrices or unitary matrices, and you have to show its homotopic to present to the end or some larger matrix ones down the diagonal. Or you could have different numbers in different places.
00:30:31.230 - 00:32:08.794, Speaker A: Now single just said to the one in end places that would be the same. You have z zero, zero, z, and you can homotop, you can rotate that second z up the first one, turn that into a z squared. Therapist had an arbitrary, passive and some non trivial work, just stringent work. Now you could use the fact that the operate matrices is a phenomenon. And if you look at, it's a finite type one factor factor means center is a scale. And if you want to have something which behaves in similar ways, you can look at the type two factor, finite type two factor, which also has a trace, just like finite type one factor, which is matrix. Now the type two factor has a trace, but it doesn't have to determine until.
00:32:08.794 - 00:32:59.722, Speaker A: Here's something that I also thought very discipline had been generalized from the commutative case to an arbitrary madagalph. They didn't even recognize it as what's called bacteria history. Just prove buffer that we can include either finite matrix algebra being a complex.
00:32:59.778 - 00:33:00.374, Speaker B: Number.
00:33:10.454 - 00:33:43.930, Speaker A: They didn't even concentrate on matrices. They concentrated on the type two one phase. The algebra has almost all the same properties as a matrix algebra. No, it's not. But there's a spectral theorem. Arbitrary. You don't have a spectral theorem.
00:33:43.930 - 00:34:59.084, Speaker A: Well, you do, but not in terms of direction. You don't have production. By the way, one of the Smiths is a smart alec who suggested improving on Dixmead's terminology of generalized integers. That in itself doesn't prove he was a smart element. Fact that he went to Germany without his passport when he was busy in Denmark for some time and then came back. This is before the European just using his danish insurance card. And then the other and the others.
00:34:59.084 - 00:35:49.438, Speaker A: This was very fun. I haven't practiced this. Rocky died recently. Was remarkable mathematician. Well known very well. Okay, um. One could try to rediscover the elementary.
00:35:49.438 - 00:36:52.224, Speaker A: You can see the proof of Meraki Smith. And Smith was really elementary. It could be worth experimenting yourself to see if you can somehow signal the path or give the close path unitaries in some non community matrix now, and you want to somehow figure it, perturb it, and you know you're going to have to go to a larger matrix in the two one factor. You don't have to go to a larger meeting. The reason, you know you're going to have to go to a larger matrix because you get z times some production, zero, zero, one. Is it already in one by one matrices? You can't do that. You can get z to the n, but you can't get, you have, if you start with z to the nth, you can't get z, no room.
00:36:52.224 - 00:38:03.344, Speaker A: You have to go matrix out of the words. True, but it's not a big deal whether you have all in one place differently. In any case, do that in any environment or matrix in different ways. Oh, why is it possible in the two one factor and it's, it's finite, which races the face of the unit is one. It's not as if it's large, but it's, it allows you to zoom into arbitrarily small things. Okay, there's no, you can have projections with arbitrarily small trace, which you cannot have in a matrix trace of a projection. Even if you normalize the trace to be one on the unit which n by n matrices, no non zero projection can have a trace any smaller than one over n, but in two one factor.
00:38:03.344 - 00:39:55.614, Speaker A: And this is, this is why given be formed inside the altruism that would point to matrices, well, you're going to need z to the n. You're going to put z to the n, z to the n times b. Well, okay, but then in the matrix algebra too, in the matrix algebra too, if you're going to allow a power of z, then you can do it. I guess you can do you just go on. So in a sense, Matthew Smith has best proved the stronger thing you can easily write down. I guess you can write down the final thing. If you have an arbitrary k zero element, you can write it down just with unitary elements of paths, of unitarians in the oak.
00:39:55.614 - 00:40:38.234, Speaker A: But you will, you're going to have to use power finding it. But you have to check that the answer can be written down inside the algebra. You have to check that the past, the deformation can take place inside the algebra too. You have a given path inside the algorithm, path of invertibles. And the final path is going to be something like this. Don't know ahead of time what it's meant to be, but hopefully that's okay. That's the idea.
00:40:38.234 - 00:41:22.914, Speaker A: And then you know, the arbitrary disputes is general proof. General statement says they're homotopic in some matrix only Brackey, Smith and Smith, which holds in the microgrid cell. It's really fishable contribution. Aside from being the first discovery of the generalization, it wasn't recognized as that for some time. Oh, I guess.
