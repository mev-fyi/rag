00:00:00.280 - 00:00:01.084, Speaker A: Same there.
00:00:05.534 - 00:00:10.022, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I'm here. It should be started now, because we.
00:00:10.038 - 00:00:28.110, Speaker A: Didn'T get usually there. Oh, yeah, it's recorded. Okay, very good. All right. So, it's my pleasure to introduce Anton Petrovien from Penn State, who graciously agreed to give a series of four lectures on Alexander geometry. Kerose about it below. Anton, please.
00:00:28.182 - 00:01:26.414, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. So, first of all, I cannot say much in full lectures, right? So I think it won't be rigorous introduction to Alexander of geometry, but I want to, like, I will at least, I will wave my hands too many times, but I will give some proof, some complete proofs, when I think its proofs are remarkable. And yeah, it was worth to give such proof, right? So, here's my plan. And by the way, I want to be useful, right? So if you have something which you think has to be included in lectures, you can write an email and I will try to do this. Here's my plan. So, I will talk today on history. Roughly, I will say, why Alexander Geometry is Alexander geometry.
00:01:26.414 - 00:02:21.014, Speaker B: And next lecture, I will talk about different definitions and globalization theorem. And I mean something which very close to definitions, maybe not only definitions and some basic properties. After that, I will spend a lecture on convexity and gradient flow. It's a main technical tool that, I mean, at least simplifies many proofs. But right now it's a standard tool in Alexander geometry, bounded below. And after that, I will define dimension and talk about finite dimensional spaces. So at this moment, I should say that most applications so far of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below, is finite dimensional.
00:02:21.014 - 00:03:28.354, Speaker B: But I think it makes sense to go this way, because when you talk about finite dimensional spaces, you have extra tools and your life becomes more complicated. You don't know which tool to use at every moment, right? So like, yeah, yeah, that's the plan. And now maybe some questions, maybe some comments you have at the moment. If not, I will talk about first appearance of Alexander geometry, which is like first definition of Alexander geometry, which was done by Abraham White in 1936. And it's under supervision of Carl, it was done under supervision of Carl Meninger in his thesis. And after that, and this work was not noticed for a long time. I think it's until eighties.
00:03:28.354 - 00:04:41.084, Speaker B: I mean, it wasn't tontis until eighties. Maybe I'm wrong. So the question which, and Abraham Wald is known for other things, not for mostly not for geometry. Also, he did quite a bit of geometry. So what's the like, how to. Oh, just a second, sorry, I cannot add just second. I don't know what's happening, but it doesn't want to add more pages to before.
00:04:41.084 - 00:05:24.444, Speaker B: Okay, so what his idea was, like, he was asked to give a metric definition of curvature for surfaces. And what he's noticed, what his observation was, is the following. Assume I have four points in the metric space. So. Or better say, four point metric space. So each seismic space can be completely described by six numbers, the distances between four points. And he asked the following question.
00:05:24.444 - 00:06:25.954, Speaker B: Assume I have. You consider comparison space m kappa. So this is sphere, sphere with radius one over square root of kappa. If kappa is greater than zero, it's a plane. Sorry. It's a sphere. Like, I wanted three spheres, and here I wanted to have three space, if gradient, or if kappa is zero, or hyperbolic space of curvature, cup wave hyperbolic space, if curvature is smaller than zero.
00:06:25.954 - 00:07:28.314, Speaker B: So here's the following question. I have a metric space, four point metric space, and I want to embed it into comparison space for which kappa, you can embed it. And it turns out that, so you have a real line that's kappa, right? And it turns out that for generic metric space, you have an interval of kappas for which you have such embedding. So what's the typical picture look like? First of all, if kappa is too small, then there is no embedding. After that, you go and you get first picture. First time you have embedding, it look like this. You have.
00:07:28.314 - 00:08:07.454, Speaker B: Oh, I'm sorry, you. So which one is which second. So after that, right here. So you have picture like this. A convex quadrilateral in the comparison space. When you. Then you increase curvature, the angles increase.
00:08:07.874 - 00:08:11.866, Speaker A: Sorry. In this case, it's actually two dimensional, right?
00:08:12.010 - 00:08:37.608, Speaker B: Right. At the first moment, it's two dimensional. After that, it becomes on inside of interval, it becomes three dimensional. And last, the end of interval, it becomes again two dimensional. And then you have picture like this. You have a triangle with a point inside. And after that, you already cannot.
00:08:37.608 - 00:09:46.194, Speaker B: You cannot embed it into comparison space anymore, okay? So. And at that moment, and after that, you can define spaces with, say, assume you have some curvature value, okay? You can say that your space has a curvature greater, curvature greater than k, if the upper side of interval for any quadruple of points is above kappa. And the same way you can talk about upper curvature bound, meaning that left end is always less or equal. Okay, so maybe let me do this picture again. So you may now talk about. Like you. Let me just state the color of wild statement.
00:09:46.194 - 00:10:22.754, Speaker B: So, assume you have space of four point metric spaces. Let's call it, I don't know, m is already occupied. So let us call it Q four, right? And you fix some kappa. And for us, let us assume that Kappa is zero. It doesn't matter. I can choose any other couple. It will not change much.
00:10:22.754 - 00:11:14.554, Speaker B: So there are some quadruples that are embeddable into a comparison space for Kappa zero. In this case, it's euclidean space, okay? And the complement of this set is not connected. It has two components, say n and p. So p means that p for positive and for negative. So some. So there are two reasons for quadruples not to be embeddable into euclidean space. If you forbid this part, then you get definition of cat zero spaces.
00:11:14.554 - 00:12:48.614, Speaker B: If you forbid this guy, you get definition of curvature bounded below by zero spaces. That means that simply quadrupoles of points include positive curvature and the quadruples that are embeddable into euclidean space. So that's kind of interesting observation, right? So that. And, right, so the statement that white prove that a surface has curvature greater or equal zero or greater equal kappa or small or equal kappa, if and only if locally, every quadruple has one of these types, right? So maybe questions about this. So, right at that moment, the definition was taken locally, right? So Valt assumed that in addition, that every quadruple sufficiently small has sufficiently small diameter. But it turned out that this assumption is not needed, right? So this much more natural. It's much more natural to assume global condition for the space for all points.
00:12:48.614 - 00:14:13.414, Speaker B: Maybe I should say that this condition could be considered as a generalization of triangle inequality, right? So, like if you think of how, like if you think how to generalize triangle inequality for four points, you may think like this, okay? Like definition of the standard triangle inequality says that every three points can be embedded into euclidean space, right? And what if I have four points? I can also say that it can be embedded into euclidean space. But in this case, the type of spaces I will get is very boring, right? It's only like if the space has intrinsic matic plus this condition, then it's only a convex subsets of Hilbert space. So it's not interesting condition. But it turns out that there are two reasons, two different reasons to not be euclidean. And if you choose, if you forbid one reason, then you get one nice kind of spaces. If you forbid another, you get another one. So that's the contribution of wild.
00:14:13.414 - 00:14:53.628, Speaker B: And maybe if. No questions, I will continue with work of Alexandrov. No questions. Okay, so. So next thing is second. Okay, so now Alexandrov made. Oh, maybe all I wanted.
00:14:53.628 - 00:16:00.034, Speaker B: I want to say one thing before, right? So maybe here. Oops. So I wanted to say one more thing here, right? If you. If you have a typical, typical quadruple, you have an interval in real line, right? There are some exceptional cases you better to add to real line minus infinity, right? And for the comparison, space minus infinity, you may take a tripod, but that is simply three half lines joined together. So that would mean that your quadruple is embeddable into. Then you always get an interval, closed interval, right? And one more thing. There is exceptional case.
00:16:00.034 - 00:17:10.950, Speaker B: When you choose a quadruple, if you choose a quadruple of special type, that one of the point lies on the minimizing geodesic between two others, then the real interval degenerates to one point set. So for four points in this position, you can actually say that these four points have certain curvature already in it, right? So that's it. Now, I think I said everything I wanted about Wald. Okay? So, next statement. Next contribution of Alexander. So it's six years later, he came up with similar definitions, but also he proved two theorems, right? The first one is embedding theorem and gluing theorem. That's both of them changed quite a bit the way people thought about surfaces in euclidean space.
00:17:10.950 - 00:19:03.944, Speaker B: And at the moment, surfaces in nuclear, at least, convex surfaces in euclidean space, the conic surfaces in euclidean space were among their central objects in differential geometry. So what he proved, right? So he took some definition similar to Wald, and he could talk about two dimensional sphere with some metric. So I assume that metric is intrinsic, okay? And assume that metric d has a curvature greater or equal zero in terms of Alexandrov. So, which is the same as wild, but I mean, everybody says in terms of Alexandrov by obvious reason, okay? Then there is a convex surface in three reals that is isometric to our space, okay? So that's. That's the main thing. That's the embedding theorem, okay? And he also, this is the compact surface. It's of course, compact.
00:19:03.944 - 00:19:05.992, Speaker B: It's symmetric on s two, right?
00:19:06.168 - 00:19:09.024, Speaker A: Yeah, but you have equivalence, all, right?
00:19:09.064 - 00:21:04.556, Speaker B: So like the way you read it, right? So equivalence means that it must be metric on s two, right? Okay, so, yeah, right? It's not perfectly well formulated statement, but I hope it's clear, right? So you have complete description of convex surfaces in r three, right? So for sure, convex surfaces in r three are homeomorphic to spheres. I mean, compact surfaces in convex. Okay, maybe I should say compact, right? It's better now it's still not perfect, but so that's the statement. And I need to add additional comment here that you allow some degeneration. So you may take a convex figure in the plane and think that it sits in the space. And in this case, you can see there's a convex surface, like two sided, like doubling of this convex figure considered to be its surface, right? You think of it that you might stay above it, right? Or you might stay below it, right? And if you want to go from one side to another, you should pass through the border, right? And then, so if you include this degenerate case, then it becomes an if and only if condition. So I practically will, I will prove closer to the end, I will sketch the proof of the statement, right? And it's indeed remarkable, a remarkable proof.
00:21:04.556 - 00:22:16.244, Speaker B: And the other thing is Guinea's theorem. That's a condition like assume you have two surfaces, two matrix on the disk, like homo to disk. And you assume the length of the boundary is the same, so you can isometrically glue them together. So it gives complete description when this gluing produces space with curvature bounded below by zero, in the sense of Alexander. So for in particular case, when your disks are smooth, right, you can formulate it the following way. So you have identification biosymmetry and you have two functions. You have curvature of the boundary for first disc and you have curvature at the boundary for the second disc.
00:22:16.244 - 00:23:42.592, Speaker B: And these two curvatures have to add up to something greater, equal zero. So in addition to isometric embedding, you have to be like, they have to be kind of neat nicely in terms of curvature. So let me show like one easy way to apply these two theorems to show that if you take sphere, right, and remove from a sphere, little disk, right. Then remaining part of sphere can be bended isometrically and smoothly, right? At least convex in this case. And in fact it follows that it's. So maybe if you see this problem for first time, you might be like, I mean you might be surprised that such bending exists, right? But here's how to prove its existence. So we remove a disk, the standard disk from the spheres has constant curvature one, and glue something else.
00:23:42.592 - 00:24:57.098, Speaker B: There is a plenty of other disks that has the same curvature on the boundary, right? And we can make sure that say couple of points, couple of opposite points on the disk getting closer than they supposed to be in this embedding. So we glue this thing inside and by Alexander's theorem, there is an embedding into like it can be realized as a convex surface in euclidean space. So we get an isometric copy of, like we get a benzene of the sphere. So at that moment, it's clear that this bending must be convex. But in fact, with some extra work, you can check that if the surface is smooth, the convexity implies smoothness of embedding. Okay, so that was history up to beginning of fifties. And now I will.
00:24:57.098 - 00:26:25.484, Speaker B: So, as I said at the end, I will give a proof of Alexander embedding theory. So, let me mention something, what happened with like with after that, right? So what's. So there is one again, a work of Anatoly Milka, who actually died recently. So in 19, 68, 67, that shows that like first time, something was proved about Alexander spaces with curvature bounded below in dimension higher than two, right? So what was proved is splitting theorem. If you have a space with curvature greater than zero, in the sense of Alexander plus it has a line. So lines means. That means minimizing geodesic, that is, isometric to real line, both sides, both sides infinite, minimizing geodesic.
00:26:25.484 - 00:27:00.774, Speaker B: So then we. The space, the space is isometric to a real line across something else. I don't know. S something else. Okay, so that's historically the first statement in Alexander geometry, dimension higher than two with curvature bounded below. Right? So Alexandrov himself mostly was concentrated on the upper curvature bound. And there are reasons for this.
00:27:00.774 - 00:28:28.118, Speaker B: Right at the beginning, it looks simpler, and as you know, it has more applications. And I think, like if you compare curvature bounded below and curvature bounded above, the curvature bounded above has more applications, but curvature bounded below has better. Like internal life, like the internal theory, is more beautiful in my opinion. Right, okay, so now there is a parallel development to the like, there is a big influence to Alexander geometry, made from so called comparison geometry. All right, so, and let me say a couple of words about this. So that's a little bit about the most important theorems in comparison geometry. First of all, Topanogov comparison theorem, which is a generalization of Alexander comparison theorem, which is saying that local condition, the sectional curvature bounded below, implies the triangle comparison.
00:28:28.118 - 00:29:43.904, Speaker B: Or if you want the wide definition of lower curvature bound, that's a global condition for all quadruple of points, right? That's equivalent statement. So, next thing is Gromov compactness theorem, that says that lower rich curvature and upper diameter and fixed dimension implies compactness of this class of spaces, in sense of Gromov Hohsdorf. Right. So once this statement is made, it's clear that it makes sense to look at the limits of riemannian manifold with fixed dimensional or lower sectional curvature, upper diameter bound. And for each curvature, its question was heard. But I mean, the development of such theory started much later. But for section on curvature, the Ponogo theorem gave sufficient tool to study this.
00:29:43.904 - 00:30:33.036, Speaker B: And another thing which is closely related is Yamaguchi theorem, which says that if riemannian manifold m has sectional curvature greater or equal minus one, and it's sufficiently close to riemannian manifold n, right. Here, it looks like it has boundary, but I don't think it doesn't have to be boundary. Okay, then there is a vibration, right? So actually, almost turbinian submersion. You have. You can map this manifold to the. There is a vibration from m to n, which in addition, almost a minion submersion. So.
00:30:33.036 - 00:32:46.834, Speaker B: And at that moment, once you see this theorem, it's natural to say, but what happens if the limit space n is not romanian, right? So in this case, it's Alexander space, right? Because the comparison survive on the limit, right? And kind of after that, you, like, you want to study high dimensional spaces with low k, which bound, right? And maybe let me say a little bit more about some parallel things, right? So, like in the before, before Alexander spaces with a lower curvature bound were introduced by Buraga, Gromov and Perelman. I mean, with exception of work of anatoly Milka, there were a few theorems which would be proved using Alexander geometry, if they would be proved before. So that's, that's the thing. So one, one is, it is like work of Bruce Kleiner on Hobf conjecture with symmetry. It says that if you have a ribinian matrix on s two cross s two with s one action, then sectional curvature cannot be bigger than zero. Right? So that's a big question, whether you can prove the same thing without assuming isometric s one action. I mean.
00:32:47.774 - 00:32:52.078, Speaker C: Sorry, what does it mean? What does it mean that it has an s one action? Do you mean that it's in the.
00:32:52.126 - 00:32:56.174, Speaker B: Metric isometric s one action? Non trivial isometric s one action.
00:32:56.334 - 00:32:57.198, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:32:57.366 - 00:33:55.712, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's it's hope conjecture that without this condition on s two cross s two, there is no metric with positive sectional curvature. But this was proved by. With the existence of. So assuming existence of such action. So I marked here, result of Karsten Grover and Burkert wilking, because it's just, because it's beautiful and it's related to original works of Schengen Kleiner. So if you just want a nice kind of advertisement of Alexander geometry, I think that's the best paper to start right? It's a beautiful application. And by the way, I should say that at that moment, I should say there are two types of application.
00:33:55.712 - 00:35:14.412, Speaker B: Like two main way to apply Alexander geometry. So, first one is you have a sequence of romanian manifolds, manifolds with sectional curvature greater than some constant, right? And you apply and you pass to its limit, right? And limit is Alexander space. And sometimes you can use Alexander geometry to say something about the approximation sequence, which can be used in like to prove certain things about this class of romanian manifolds. That's type of applications which makes possible by gromov compactness theorem. Like, you assume you study these type of spaces, maybe you make some assumption, and that implies existence of certain sequence of spaces, which makes, say, worse and worse condition. I will give you one example, and then you get a contradiction.
00:35:14.468 - 00:35:17.384, Speaker A: Sorry, I don't. Can you say the compactness sequence.
00:35:21.004 - 00:35:32.304, Speaker B: I stated recently? Right, so, just a second, when I hear I stated compactness theorem, but I didn't wrote anything. Do I have to write something?
00:35:32.924 - 00:35:34.454, Speaker A: Oh, that would be nice.
00:35:34.644 - 00:36:15.464, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so, sectional curvature greater, equal the constant diameter less or equal d, and dimension is less or equal n, right? These three conditions implies that pre compactness in Gromov Hozdorff topology. Okay, are you happy?
00:36:15.764 - 00:36:16.544, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:18.164 - 00:36:43.904, Speaker B: By the way, you don't ask questions. And by that reason, I think that everything I say is clear. Right. If you ask more questions, I will get better understanding to whom I'm talking about at the moment. So. Okay, okay, so that's. There is one.
00:36:43.904 - 00:37:41.288, Speaker B: This Gromov compactness theorem produce one type of applications. For example, the Gromov beta numbers theorem, which, if available at the moment, Gromov write his proof. He probably would use Alexander geometry to prove it, right? But he didn't. But, like, how to start? So what the theorem says that again, sectional curvature greater, equal c, diameter less than d, and dimension less than n. Then sum of beta numbers is less than some constant. That depends on c, d and m. Right? So how such one could prove such thing? I assume it's not.
00:37:41.376 - 00:37:45.084, Speaker C: Sorry, sorry. Could you. Could you remind us what the Betty numbers are?
00:37:45.584 - 00:38:18.834, Speaker B: Betty numbers? It's ranks of cosmology groups, right? It's beta numbers. I mean, it's a dimension of h. Say, I don't know. I of m, right. Say you can, you can put any field. Let us put r just to make it, to make a definition. Is it okay?
00:38:19.614 - 00:38:21.834, Speaker C: Yes, thank you.
00:38:22.534 - 00:39:48.296, Speaker B: So, that's a famous stadium of Gromov, right? And I assume he would like to prove it after Alexander geometry appeared, right? Assume this is not true. That means that there is a sequence of many faults. That is a sequence of many faults, m one m 2d, such that sum of beta numbers of mk goes to infinity as k goes to infinity. Okay? Then since all these manifolds have diameter, curvature and dimension bound, you can pass to a limit, right? You can pass to subsequence and pass to a limit space. And then you use this limit space, maybe after like with some extra construction to get a contradiction, right? So such sequence does not exist. So this type of argument is the main highway to apply Alexander geometry. But there is another way, another source of applications, which is used here in clean approve.
00:39:48.296 - 00:41:00.258, Speaker B: And this type of application goes like use the following arguments. So the following observation. Assume again it's applications in riemannian geometry. Assume m is a riemannian manifold with sectional curvature greater equal c and g acts on m by isometries. Then the quotient space, mg is an Alexander space with curvature, curvature greater than c, right? So when you pass to the quotient by a group action, isometric group action, you get the curvature bound preserved, right? So that's what used in Kleinia's proof, right? So he took s two versus two, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:00.306 - 00:41:02.042, Speaker C: So this group can be discrete.
00:41:02.138 - 00:41:02.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:02.634 - 00:41:05.162, Speaker C: This group can either be discrete or continuous, doesn't matter.
00:41:05.218 - 00:41:31.626, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Right. So there is a condition, right? The group must have closed orbits, right? So the quotient space has natural metric and so on. But you can always pass through such bigger group, right? So if it's not right to its completion. So for the Kleiner's proof, you have s two cross s two cross g. You factorize by s one.
00:41:31.626 - 00:42:23.234, Speaker B: You get three dimensional Alexander space. And there is certain conditions on singular points that they apply and use it. And let me repeat once more, that if you have. If you want to have an advertisement of Alexander geometry, just check this paper, right? That's beautiful. Like beautiful thing. Okay, so some questions. Okay, so finally we get to the end of historical part, right? So that's the.
00:42:23.234 - 00:43:07.126, Speaker B: It's now in the middle. Sorry. Okay, maybe. Oh yeah. So after that we get like begin like official start of Alexander geometry is the work of paper of Buraga, Gromov and Perelman from 92. And from that moment we can think that it's Alexander geometry of dimension higher than two with curvature bound below exist. So, I finished part with about history and I have 16 minutes to talk about Alexandrov embedding theorem.
00:43:07.126 - 00:43:51.374, Speaker B: But before I do this, maybe if you have some questions I will try to answer and by the way, I'm not doing history. Right? So that's the thing I said. It's like the way I understand what happened, right? But some other people might have completely different opinion. Not completely, but I mean, different opinion on what. What actually happened. So, any questions? Okay, then. So that's.
00:43:51.374 - 00:44:14.354, Speaker B: So that's the last topic. So what. What the theorem says. So I see you might have. Okay, maybe. Let me restate it again. D is a matic intrinsic, intrinsic metric on s two.
00:44:14.354 - 00:44:52.882, Speaker B: Then d is Sd. S 2d is isometric to a convex surface if and only if d has non negative curvature, in the sense of Alexandra. Okay, so when you went.
00:44:52.938 - 00:45:01.474, Speaker C: So when you write curvature d bigger than zero, Alexandrov, that's the same thing as sec, bigger than zero. Except sec is only in a romanian setting. Is that right?
00:45:01.514 - 00:45:23.194, Speaker B: Right. You. Yeah, that's the same thing. Right. So that means it's like, essentially, that means that certain condition holds for any four points in. In my metric space, right? I can measure these four distances and get, like. Get a comparison, right? So.
00:45:23.194 - 00:46:06.804, Speaker B: But soon I will. I mean, I will start the proof and it will be irrelevant, actually. Right? So some more questions about statement. Okay, so the proof goes like this. There is approximation part, right? And it can be by. By approximation, can be reduced to the following statement. So assume p is polyhedral space to space.
00:46:06.804 - 00:47:44.630, Speaker B: So that means, what I mean by polyhedral space is that it admits a triangulation such that each triangle is isometric to a triangle in the euclidean plane and metric is intrinsic, right? That's the. That's what encoded in the polyhedral space. So assume p is a polyhedral space, plus p is homeomorphic to the sphere. Okay? Then p is isometric to a surface of convex. Convex polyhedron in three reals, if and only if the total angle angle around. Around any vertex in p is less or equal than two PI. Okay, so that's kind of the proof goes back.
00:47:44.630 - 00:48:36.784, Speaker B: Approximation, right? So if you have a polyhedral. If you have a arbitrary metric on the intrinsic metric on the s two, you approximate it by polyhedral space. After that, you apply this theorem about convex polyhedrons, realize it as a surface of convex polyhedron, and apply the approximation again, you get. You get the statement which you wanted, right? So you see the connection, right? I didn't. I didn't make it precise, right? But you see that at least there is a reason to believe that second theorem applies. The first one. No questions.
00:48:36.784 - 00:48:47.314, Speaker B: Okay, so. And then the proof goes like this. You have. You can see the two.
00:48:48.534 - 00:48:59.954, Speaker A: Sorry, Anton. Comment not the question, sir, that for polyhedral surfaces, curvature bigger and echo than zero condition is equivalent to the condition.
00:49:01.614 - 00:49:18.264, Speaker B: It requires proof. It requires proof. This is not obvious, but true. Yeah, it's not obvious, but true. And it requires proof. And like formal proof, actually, it's supposed to contain globalization theorem, right? So it's not. It's not at all easy, right? But yeah.
00:49:20.084 - 00:49:26.184, Speaker C: Yep, sorry, when you talk about globalization theorem, what does that refer to?
00:49:26.524 - 00:49:33.264, Speaker B: Globalization theorem that it says that local curvature condition implies global curvature condition.
00:49:33.644 - 00:49:38.620, Speaker C: So in other words, if you have the bound you want for small triangles, you have it for large triangles as well, right?
00:49:38.732 - 00:50:05.020, Speaker B: Right, right. Yeah, that's. That's true for lower curvature bounds. And it's not quite true for upper curvature bounds. So for upper curvature bound, you need some extra condition, right? But for like. Yeah, I could, but I will talk about this, like next lecture, right? So this time I want to. Want to talk about Alexander from beginning stadium.
00:50:05.020 - 00:51:48.784, Speaker B: So, so you can see the two spaces, right? So like Phi and psi, okay, let it be. First will be Phi and that will be psi. So phi is a space space of all polyhedrons in r three, up to Israel, up to congruence, right? And psi is the space of all polyhedron spaces on the sphere, right? So we have two such spaces, okay? And whenever it's quite easy to prove that if I have a convex polyhedron, then its surface has the condition I described, that like the total angle around each vertex is less or equal than two PI. In fact, this statement is included in the standard textbook in school geometry. So in solid geometry, and what it implies that there is a map from phi top side for each convex polyhedron, I have the polyhedral space that hemyamorphic two is two. And what we need to show. What's this noise? What we need to show.
00:51:49.804 - 00:51:53.080, Speaker A: Sorry, in your file, you're considering convex.
00:51:53.112 - 00:51:57.528, Speaker B: Polyhedra or polyhedra, right, right, convex polyhedra. I forget. Convex.
00:51:57.576 - 00:51:59.504, Speaker A: Right, convex, yeah, you didn't say convex.
00:51:59.664 - 00:52:23.524, Speaker B: Right. And on the right, just spaces with all polyhedral spaces. With the condition with total angle angle lesser than two PI for any vertex. Vertex. Sorry, sorry for this. Okay, so what. What you actually.
00:52:23.524 - 00:53:15.114, Speaker B: What you need to prove that this is this map which I described is actually bi ejection. Yeah, between two spaces. And the proof goes like you, you may call it extension by parameter. Right? So like the way there are type of proof that usually used in differential equations. So first of all, let us reduce the case. First of all, we may assume that number of vertices is the same. Of course, any vertex of polyhedron corresponds to vertex in the preheateral image surface and let it be m.
00:53:15.114 - 00:54:06.296, Speaker B: So, it's sufficient to prove that this map is by ejection. And we need to prove certain things. First of all, let's give a name for this map, f. So, first of all, that f is injective. And that's pretty much theorem on polyhedron. Polyhedrons. So, Cache's theorem says that if you know the faces of polyhedrons, then you know the polyhedron up to congruence.
00:54:06.296 - 00:55:08.944, Speaker B: And little variation of his proof implies that if you know the intrinsic metric on the surface of polyhedron, then you actually know the polyhedron upto isometry. So that means that this map is injective. Injective, okay. Then you prove two other things. You prove that f is closed map. So, meaning that close set map to close set, right from fm to fn, right, which is easy, right? So you just, if you assume you have a sequence of polyhedrons that correspond to that converge to some polyhedron, then you need to show that surface of polyhedron also converge to surface of the limit in the sense of grammar. First, it's quite easy to prove.
00:55:08.944 - 00:56:17.174, Speaker B: After that, you prove that f is open map. And this is a little bit harder, right? So this is pretty much invariance of domain of the main theorem. So what the invariance of the main theorem says that if you have a map from open set in euclidean space to euclidean space of the same dimension, if it's injective and continues, then the image is open, right? That's a standard theorem. Well, in order to apply this theorem, we need to have that these both spaces are manifolds, right? And they are almost manifolds. They are orbit folds of the same dimension. So, with little variation of this, of the proof of invariance of the main theorem, you prove that openness of the space. And finally, you need to show that psi n is connected.
00:56:17.174 - 00:57:02.124, Speaker B: That's proved by induction, quite like you, just by hand. You construct a curve that connects two matrix with a given property. Altogether, you get that image must be closed open and it's not empty in connected set in connected space. So it must be everything. And that's the end of proof, right? So, yeah, I have three minutes left, right, I finished everything I said. If no more questions, I make one comment then and leave other questions.
00:57:03.984 - 00:57:16.310, Speaker A: Okay. Hello Anton, I do have a question. Thanks for the introduction. I just wanted to know whether you will give you know, an outline, if possible, of this theorem by Gromov concerning the estimates of betty numbers. Just as a curiosity.
00:57:16.342 - 00:57:35.994, Speaker B: It's not. No, no, for sure. I just give you example. Example, right. So Gromov proved it different by different methods. But as I said, if the Alexander geometry would be invented before 1981, right. Then he would probably use Alexander technique.
00:57:35.994 - 00:57:55.046, Speaker B: You can see. You can see Alexander's technique and what he was writing. Right, that's what I'm trying to. Yeah. Thank you. So I will, I will talk about like foundations of Alexander geometry on this, on the following three lectures. Right? So it will not be connected to any like.
00:57:55.046 - 00:58:05.362, Speaker B: Yeah. Advanced results. No more questions. Okay, hold on.
00:58:05.498 - 00:58:09.814, Speaker A: Let's wait for people to ask reference for this.
00:58:10.834 - 00:58:52.790, Speaker B: Pardon me, you. You need the reference for this? Did you ask for reference? You disappeared. Yes, yeah, yeah. So there, there is a book of Alexandrov, which recently translated to relatively like ten years ago, maybe translated to English, right. It was from 1950s or something, right? Which. So there is a reference, it's called polyhedron spaces or something, or polyhedron, I forget, convex polyhedra, I think the name of the book, right. And it's very nicely written.
00:58:52.790 - 00:59:20.118, Speaker B: And by the way, I want to say that Alexandrov has certain talent, right? When he writes, you read him and you have a feeling that you understand how he was thinking about this question, which of course not true, right? But it's very. It's pleasure to read. So if you. If you can read, I mean. Yeah, I advertise him a little bit. So, more questions. Yes.
00:59:20.118 - 01:00:33.294, Speaker B: Can you say something about how to prove that it's connected? You just. Right, so you think like about. So you need to show that Cyan is connected. And you may think like imagine that you have, first of all, there is a construction, right? So you have a way to move metric on with singular points. So assume you have this symmetric, you choose these two singular points, you connect them by geodesic. Now imagine you cut along this geodesic, what you get, you get a hole, right? And you know quite a bit about the, like what, what happens around the hole. So it's rather easy to show that what you get is all your path here is isometric to subset of a cone, right? So there are two points on the cone connected by Jedisic from right and left.
01:00:33.294 - 01:00:54.580, Speaker B: And that's. That's the part what you get, right. And after that you have many ways to vary the metric, right. You can move points up, say at these two guys and. Yeah, right. You can move these two points as far as they are kind of opposite. There are two geodesics between them on right and left side.
01:00:54.580 - 01:01:20.568, Speaker B: So there are three parameters formally, when you can vary two points and that can be used to connect to two spaces. But actual proof goes like this. Like you have phi. Nice psi n. And you start with symmetric. And you use this property to connect it to psi n minus one. So one of the points will disappear.
01:01:20.568 - 01:01:37.374, Speaker B: Right. The curvature there will be zero. Then you apply induction. You know that psi n minus one is connected. So. And then any other point can be connected to psi and minus one. And then you need to vary a little bit.
01:01:37.374 - 01:01:48.962, Speaker B: This curve. Right. Which goes close to boundary, meaning too close to be degenerate. Right. One of the vertexes nearly. Has nearly zero. Kautia.
01:01:48.962 - 01:01:59.778, Speaker B: Right. And come back to this curvature. So I'm not sure if I like. Right. So the proof is not short. Right. But it's kind of.
01:01:59.778 - 01:02:17.176, Speaker B: I described the idea, right. So are you happy? Yes, thank you. That was helpful. More questions? Okay. Not the case. Right. Thank you for coming.
01:02:17.176 - 01:02:39.954, Speaker B: And. Yeah, I said at the very beginning, I said, what will be happening? What will happen after. Right. So if you check it, maybe to see if you want to come again. Vitaly, should I. Am I finished? Vitali, are you there?
01:02:42.214 - 01:02:48.994, Speaker A: Sorry, sorry, I was muted. Sorry, I apologize. I was trying to say something. Unsuccessfully.
01:02:49.814 - 01:02:51.954, Speaker B: So we finished, right?
01:02:52.654 - 01:03:06.046, Speaker A: Yes. If there are no more questions, let's thank Antonio and yes, we'll see you on tomorrow. Bye.
