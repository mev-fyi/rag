00:00:00.920 - 00:00:27.152, Speaker A: So, right, as advertised there, I will talk about this. By the way, this is, whoops, stuck back. Okay, so this is not my definition. This is the definition. This is the description by Bill Sharp about this problem, the problem of retirement decumulation. So basically, we know throughout the western world that defined benefit plans are disappearing. Corporations and governments are no longer willing to take on the risk of DB plans.
00:00:27.152 - 00:00:50.268, Speaker A: For example, here's a recent survey from the P seven countries. Which are these countries down here? For some reason, this is considered an appropriate list of countries. DC plan assets are 55% of all pension assets. Aggregated all these countries. And here are some examples. Australia is 87%, DC USA 65. Canada is 43, and down to Japan, which is only five.
00:00:50.268 - 00:01:16.624, Speaker A: So anyway, the trend is clear. Everybody's moving to DC plan. So this is something everybody's going to have to be thinking about. What's the retirees dilemma for owning or being part of a DC plan? For example, here in Canada, that will be an RRSP you have to decide on once you retire. An investment strategy. And stocks versus bonds is the main thing to do. A decumulation schedule, how much you should withdraw each year.
00:01:16.624 - 00:01:20.116, Speaker A: And the retiree now has two major sources of risk, right?
00:01:20.260 - 00:01:23.300, Speaker B: Investment risk and longevity risk.
00:01:23.332 - 00:01:56.354, Speaker A: In other words, running out of cash before death. This is the risk. And as I mentioned, will bill sharp all this problem, the nastiest, hardest problem in finance. So here's the standard thing. Which kind of any financial advisor, basically you go to these days, tells you this is the 4% rule. And this was written out by a paper written by Bingen in 1994 based on rolling 30 year historical periods. A retiree who invested in a portfolio of 50% bonds, 50% stocks, this is all us data rebalanced annually.
00:01:56.354 - 00:02:30.552, Speaker A: And if you withdrew 4% of initial capital each year, adjusted for inflation, it's all real annually. You would never have run out of cash over any rolling 30 year period starting from 1926. Okay? And that's really the sort of basis of this famous 4% rule. Criticism, of course, is a pretty simplistic asset allocation strategy. It's a simplistic withdrawal strategy, withdrawing the same amount every year and rolling 30 year periods. Rolling means start 26, go to 56, 27, 57, and so on all the way through.
00:02:30.688 - 00:02:32.680, Speaker B: Clearly there's a lot of overlap and.
00:02:32.712 - 00:02:56.954, Speaker A: It'S going to underestimate the risk of portfolio depletion. But this is in fact the default strategy that a financial advisor will tell you today. They would argue, some people argue it should be 3.6 or 4.2. But really it's basically the same thing. Well, something to think of here. And this is an interesting quote from this guy, another guy who's well known in this retirement planning business, Wayne Fowl.
00:02:56.954 - 00:03:01.846, Speaker A: The objective of retirement is you should be planning to live, not planning to die.
00:03:01.910 - 00:03:02.302, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:02.398 - 00:03:26.764, Speaker A: The trick is you should plan to live a long time. And that's where the idea is, well, you need a lot, you need a good strategy to fund this long period of retirement, because that's your goal. Your goal is if you're going to die tomorrow, it's easy, sort of. Okay, so this is based on this assumption that a 65 year old will live to be 95. And if you talk to people like, I'm retired. I like this idea. I'm going to live to 95, right? I should plan to live that long.
00:03:26.764 - 00:03:55.152, Speaker A: So that seems to be kind of thing people are comfortable with. One thing, again, I hear this sometimes where I give these talks and people say, well, we should do it like an annuity. We should mortality weight the cash flows. So this is the sort of question people usually have. Well, think about this. The median life expectancy of a 65 year old male and canadian male is about 87. So if you do that mortality weighting annuity weighting thing, what that means is you're going to weight the cash flow of the 87 year old by about a half.
00:03:55.152 - 00:03:55.804, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:56.304 - 00:03:58.848, Speaker B: But the problem is being alive is.
00:03:58.856 - 00:04:09.890, Speaker A: A binary state, right? I'm either alive or I'm dead. Right. If I'm alive, I need 100% of my cash flow. If I'm dead, I don't anything. Right. So we're not going to do that. And that's the way most people don't.
00:04:09.890 - 00:04:31.658, Speaker A: They think, let's go live for a long time. Let's, you know, assume there's a conservative strategy. Whoops, I went ahead here, right? So we're going to consider an individual investor, not averaging over a population, think you're going to live for 30 years. And this is, again, consistent with this bingen approach. This is what we're trying to do. We're trying to beat this bingen strategy. Fear of running out of cash.
00:04:31.658 - 00:04:42.006, Speaker A: So a recent survey actually showed the majority of pre retirees fear exhausting their savings more than death. Okay, this is a big deal. I don't want to run out of cash.
00:04:42.150 - 00:04:42.686, Speaker B: That's the thing.
00:04:42.710 - 00:04:57.758, Speaker A: Which really is on top of people's minds. Again, just to give you some idea, 65 year old male in Canada, the probability of about 13% of living to be 95. So it's not 50% but it's not zero and a probability about 2% of living to 100.
00:04:57.806 - 00:04:57.990, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:58.022 - 00:05:13.602, Speaker A: So you can say 95 is kind of, maybe you'll make it probably 100. You probably won't. So that's typically why you choose 95 as this kind of cutoff, as being what you want to be able to fund. So we're going to assume this conservative strategy of a 30 year retirement, as bingen did.
00:05:13.658 - 00:05:16.946, Speaker B: Okay, what if you actually do run.
00:05:16.970 - 00:05:26.774, Speaker A: Out of cash at that point? Well, we're going to assume that you have other assets to hedge, extreme longevity, such as, for example, real estate. And I'll be talking a bit more about that in a minute.
00:05:27.154 - 00:05:30.326, Speaker B: So the objective of this talk, we're.
00:05:30.350 - 00:06:02.962, Speaker A: Going to try to determine a decumulation strategy which has variable withdrawals, minimum and maximum constraints. We're going to allow you to vary your withdrawals, but you have a minimum that you need for your cash flows and some maximum. You can think of that maximum as being what you really want to get, but you're not being outlandish. You think, well, if I could get this much money, that'd be pretty good, and I need this bare minimum amount to fund my retirement. Okay, so we're going to try to minimize the risk of portfolio depletion because we know that we're afraid of running.
00:06:02.978 - 00:06:05.138, Speaker B: Out of cash and we're going to.
00:06:05.146 - 00:06:14.794, Speaker A: Try to maximize the total expected withdrawals. Again, this is something that, it's difficult, and I can explain this, my personal variant, too, I was just discussing before, is that you have to change your.
00:06:14.834 - 00:06:16.922, Speaker B: Mindset when you retire.
00:06:16.978 - 00:06:46.314, Speaker A: You've been working for 40 years accumulating cash. Now you have to spend money, right? And in fact, if you look at a lot of surveys of people, in fact, they're very ineffective at actually spending their money or decumulating. So the objective here is to spend a lot of money before you die. That's the objective. And not run out of cash. That's the point here. So we're going to allow for a dynamic, non determinant, deterministic asset allocation and the same thing for the withdrawals, too.
00:06:46.314 - 00:06:59.374, Speaker A: Right? So we should be able to do better than that bingen rule. That bingen rule is a constant allocation and a constant withdrawal. Right. Now I'm going to allow these to vary. Well, I should be able to do better. I've increased the admissible set of my control problem.
00:07:00.154 - 00:07:01.314, Speaker B: So we're going to treat this problem.
00:07:01.354 - 00:07:31.684, Speaker A: As a problem in optimal stochastic control and see what we can get out of this. So we're going to assume the investor has access to two funds, a broad stock market index fund. And we're going to use notation, the amount, not the unit amount, the total amount. Invest in the stock index is s. And we're going to assume that the other asset you have available to you is a constant maturity bond index fund. And the amount of the bond index is b. Right.
00:07:31.684 - 00:08:06.104, Speaker A: And the total wealth w is, of course, just the sum of the amount in the stock index and the amount in the bond index. We're going to model the returns of both indexes by a parametric jump diffusion model. We're going to assume non zero stock bond correlation, and we'll fit the parameters to market data from 26 to end of 2019, beginning of 2020. All returns are inflation adjusted, right. These are all real returns. And by the way, we're going to test this on bootstrap resampling. So we're going to see how well we do by actually testing it on bootstrapping data.
00:08:07.804 - 00:08:09.332, Speaker B: Okay, so we're going to assume that.
00:08:09.348 - 00:08:17.850, Speaker A: The withdrawal and rebalancing at some discrete times, and sometimes zero to t. So zero is 65, t is big, t.
00:08:17.882 - 00:08:21.586, Speaker B: Is 95, the investor has two.
00:08:21.650 - 00:08:42.166, Speaker A: And, well, basically we're going to assume, by the way, annual rebalancing and withdrawals, we're going to assume the investor. Think of the investor. It's a control problem. So you have two controls at each time. T sub I, Q sub I is the amount that you're going to withdraw this year. And P sub I is the fraction in stocks after withdrawal. Right.
00:08:42.166 - 00:09:30.374, Speaker A: You've got two assets, stock index, bond index. So the big sort of decision to make in terms of asset allocation is what should I weight the bond and stock split. So think about it at some time. T sub I, the wealth after I withdraw, or, sorry, before withdrawal is the total amount in my portfolio, stock plus bond. So wi minus just before I withdraw, after I withdraw. Wi plus is amount before minus withdrawal minus mean before withdrawal plus meaning after. And once that occurs, then I rebalance my portfolio, right? So si plus the stock amount after I withdraw is going to be some fraction times the wealth after withdrawal, and the bond is what's left over.
00:09:30.374 - 00:10:04.080, Speaker A: One minus p times the wealth. Right? So I got to determine this control q and they control p at each rebalancing time. And it's clarified as obvious that in fact, the withdrawal amount is a function of the wealth before withdrawal and the stock fraction is the function of the amount after I withdraw. Money should be withdrawn. Yeah, I got a minimum and maximum constraint on the withdrawal.
00:10:04.112 - 00:10:04.328, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:04.376 - 00:10:09.560, Speaker A: I'll be. I'll be defending that later. But there's a minimum and maximum amount. Minimum, meaning that's the amount minimum amount you need.
00:10:09.712 - 00:10:10.072, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:10.128 - 00:10:12.256, Speaker A: To fund your retirement, I think. Yep.
00:10:12.320 - 00:10:12.520, Speaker B: Sure.
00:10:12.552 - 00:10:13.928, Speaker A: It's constrained. It's all constrained.
00:10:13.976 - 00:10:14.604, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:15.024 - 00:10:26.804, Speaker A: And, well, the asset allocation as well. No, no shorting, no leverage kind of thing. Well, so, okay, so this is a multi objective problem. And so we're going to use a scalarization point approach.
00:10:27.674 - 00:10:32.266, Speaker B: Wow. Back, back. Great. There we go.
00:10:32.450 - 00:10:36.010, Speaker A: We're going to use a scalarization approach to define the pareto points.
00:10:36.202 - 00:10:37.674, Speaker B: So we're going to find the controls.
00:10:37.714 - 00:11:26.266, Speaker A: Which maximize and their kappa is a scalarization parameter, the expected total withdrawals, which is just a sum. So this is the expectation area sum control p. It's a set of those asset allocation controls and withdrawal controls of the total withdrawals, the sum over all the withdrawals over all the times. And our measure of risk here is the mean of the worst 5% of the outcomes. I'm going to call this, by the way, expected shortfall, because I think actuaries like that, it's like a minus of c bar. So varying kappa traces out the efficient frontier in the expected withdrawal, expected shortfall plane. Right? So again, my measure of risk is the mean of the worst 5% of the outcomes.
00:11:26.266 - 00:11:33.890, Speaker A: That means a larger expected shortfall is better. You want to have a larger value, not the smallest value. Okay. Because it's the opposite sign.
00:11:34.042 - 00:11:36.694, Speaker B: Okay. All right.
00:11:37.434 - 00:12:19.094, Speaker A: So given an expectation under control p, then, of course, we have this nice result here about the expected shortfall to 5% level is given by the supreme over this parameter w of this expression here. So now we can sort of reformulate this control problem as our objective function here is we're going to maximize the total. This is the expected value under this control of the sum of the total withdrawals. We want to make this as big as possible, and we want to make the mean of the worst 5% outcomes, also as large as possible. And I've got this other little term here. It's a stabilization term. Epsilon is a small parameter.
00:12:19.094 - 00:12:27.426, Speaker A: And I'm going to describe you later on why we need this here. And this is really to handle what I call the Warren Buffett effect.
00:12:27.490 - 00:12:27.834, Speaker B: Okay?
00:12:27.874 - 00:12:31.174, Speaker A: So I'm going to explain what that is. Yep.
00:12:33.074 - 00:12:34.610, Speaker B: It's a measure of tail risk. Right.
00:12:34.642 - 00:12:43.578, Speaker A: And remember that the most thing you're worried about is running on cache, okay? Right. So. So the larger we make that, the less likely we're going to run out of cash.
00:12:43.626 - 00:12:43.786, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:43.810 - 00:12:48.242, Speaker A: So it's just a left pale measure of what we're most worried about is running out of cash.
00:12:48.338 - 00:12:50.434, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:12:50.474 - 00:13:06.722, Speaker A: So I'm going to talk. Yeah, you can. And the trouble is that's actually, that's not a very robust thing. You try to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we tried that. You know, it doesn't give you very satisfactory kind of results because of that property.
00:13:06.722 - 00:13:13.010, Speaker A: Just not very robust. This is a, you know, you want to, if you're going to run out of cash, you want to measure how much you're running out kind of thing.
00:13:13.042 - 00:13:15.146, Speaker B: Right. This is going to measure, you know.
00:13:15.170 - 00:13:22.618, Speaker A: What, like the probability thing is like $1 is the same as running out by a million dollars, you know. Okay, so you want to actually say, well, how much?
00:13:22.786 - 00:13:23.746, Speaker B: You have to kind of weight it.
00:13:23.770 - 00:13:26.538, Speaker A: That's intuitively why it's kind of a better measure.
00:13:26.706 - 00:13:32.450, Speaker B: You know, why not the 5%? Why 5%?
00:13:32.522 - 00:13:51.410, Speaker A: No, no, no. Yeah, sure. The tail, beyond running out of expectation, minimize the amount less than. In other words, what you want to do is fix w star to be zero. Yeah, yeah. Well, you can fix w star to be zero.
00:13:51.482 - 00:13:52.010, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:13:52.042 - 00:13:53.738, Speaker A: That's a possibility. Yeah, sure.
00:13:53.826 - 00:13:54.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:54.794 - 00:14:03.116, Speaker A: And it's kind of equivalent. So. Yeah, but it's actually, I mean, you end up getting. Well, yeah. You know, the idea. So you could actually adjust that so you'd hit zero if you wanted. Yeah, yeah.
00:14:03.116 - 00:14:04.904, Speaker A: But it's a similar concept, I'd say.
00:14:06.244 - 00:14:07.220, Speaker B: Okay, so.
00:14:07.332 - 00:14:21.664, Speaker A: Oh yeah, time consistency. Right. Okay. This is an interesting question which people always ask about. And I mean, there's a lot of confusion, I would say, in the literature about this. Okay, so I'm just gonna give you a very short story here. So if you wanna know more, I'd be happy to talk to you for hours about this.
00:14:21.664 - 00:14:48.224, Speaker A: Okay, so the expected withdrawal, sum of total withdrawals, expected value, and the expected shortfall tail risk thing. Right. Objective function is not formally time consistent. And then most people say, oh, it's terrible. Okay, what does that mean? Time inconsistency? It means I'm just not doing this mathematically. I'm just going to give you some kind of intuitive explanation of that. The investor has an incentive to deviate from the initial optimal policy.
00:14:48.224 - 00:15:32.698, Speaker A: You compute some optimal policy at time zero. Then if it's not time consistent, you would say, ah, the investor has an incentive to deviate from that policy at future times. Okay, so this is not an implementable policy. That's the kind of naive kind of comment, right? The ewes, expected withdrawal, expected shortfall policy, computed at time zero is formally what's known as a pre commitment policy. In other words, you'd have to compute that policy at time zero and say you have to do that even though you have an incentive to deviate from it at later times. Okay, that's true, but. Okay, so at time zero we compute the pre commitment, expected withdrawal, expected shortfall.
00:15:32.746 - 00:15:35.402, Speaker B: Control for time bigger than zero.
00:15:35.458 - 00:15:49.430, Speaker A: We're going to assume that you actually investor follows the induced time consistent strategy. Almost all these pre commitment controls problems, there is an induced consistent strategy which is related to the original policy, such.
00:15:49.462 - 00:15:51.822, Speaker B: That if you follow that it's time.
00:15:51.878 - 00:16:16.344, Speaker A: Consistent and it's identical to the control computed by the pre commitment strategy. We're going to assume that you compute this thing at time zero and after time zero you follow the induced time consistent strategy. Sort of a subtle point here. This control is identical to the pre commitment control computed at zero. There's no incentive to deviate from this control at time greater than zero.
00:16:17.444 - 00:16:19.092, Speaker B: In this particular case, it's kind of.
00:16:19.108 - 00:16:44.284, Speaker A: A trivial kind of thing to say. What is that induced time consistent strategy? Well, really what this is is compute the pre commitment control, determine that parameter w, and then maximize this problem here with the fixed value of w, kind of similar to what you were suggesting there. Really doing that. I mean, expected shortfall strategy basically just.
00:16:44.324 - 00:16:46.972, Speaker B: Nails down that w could be zero.
00:16:47.028 - 00:17:05.724, Speaker A: It could be plus, could be minus, right? But it's a way of actually selecting a reasonable w parameter. In other words, the disaster level of final wealth. That's what that really does. And if you think about it from this point of view, this induced strategy is in fact time consistent. So it is in fact implementable mathematically.
00:17:06.464 - 00:17:09.632, Speaker B: Okay, by the way, there's a whole.
00:17:09.648 - 00:17:17.664, Speaker A: Other literature on what's called the, I hope I'm not boring people with this, but anyway, there's a whole lot of literature on what's called the equilibrium control, which is kind of, I don't know.
00:17:17.664 - 00:17:19.232, Speaker B: If you heard about this, it's a.
00:17:19.248 - 00:17:24.248, Speaker A: Way to force a pre commitment strategy to be time consistent.
00:17:24.336 - 00:17:25.084, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:26.304 - 00:17:53.714, Speaker A: The trouble is, I actually did this a couple years ago, and there's a, right, there's a couple papers by Bjork and Margot. I don't know if you remember these guys and they spent a lot of effort in doing this. And the trouble is, if you, what happens when you force time consistency? You actually change the nature of the objective function, just a byproduct. And if you go to all this work and do a time consistent version of expected shortfall, mean expected shortfall. In fact, it doesn't minimize the tail.
00:17:53.754 - 00:17:56.018, Speaker B: Risk anymore, so it's kind of useless.
00:17:56.106 - 00:18:22.230, Speaker A: Okay. I was very disappointed when I did all this work. I thought, this is a terrible risk measure. Okay? So you can't get around this by doing the standard equilibrium control thing. Okay? You want to know some more? There's a lot of papers on this topic, you know. Anyway, moving right along now, here's an interesting result. Okay, so what about this withdrawal control? Remember, you got two controls, right? Amount you're going to withdraw and asset allocation after you withdraw.
00:18:22.230 - 00:18:29.382, Speaker A: What about this withdrawal control? Here's an interesting. So I did this computer, all these results, you know, solved my PD's and so on.
00:18:29.398 - 00:18:29.844, Speaker B: And.
00:18:29.974 - 00:19:07.908, Speaker A: Wow, look at that. Why is that happening? So I had to go back and do some simple cases to figure out what was going on. So if we assume that the stock and bond indexes follow a parametric jump diffusion that's built into this thing, the portfolio is realized continuously, but not discreetly. It's obviously some kind of limit, right? And withdrawals occur at a continuous finite rate. Again, you know, it's an idealized situation, right? That's the only thing you can analyze. The optimal control is bang bang, right? We all know where the bang bang control is. That means the optimal withdrawal is either the minimum or the maximum.
00:19:07.908 - 00:19:14.828, Speaker A: Nothing in between. So what that says is, you know, when you're doing this optimal control problem.
00:19:14.876 - 00:19:17.292, Speaker B: You only get either you're going to.
00:19:17.308 - 00:19:19.824, Speaker A: Withdraw at the minimum rate or the maximum.
00:19:20.164 - 00:19:23.528, Speaker B: Okay, how much money you got?
00:19:23.576 - 00:19:27.664, Speaker A: Okay, we're going to see a control map. But that's all. That's all it is.
00:19:27.824 - 00:19:28.600, Speaker B: Okay?
00:19:28.752 - 00:19:36.608, Speaker A: Again, you can prove it. You know, actuarial, it's much easier to publish this stuff in the actuarial literature than the financial literature. I was talking about that later.
00:19:36.696 - 00:19:38.000, Speaker B: So there you go.
00:19:38.032 - 00:19:39.384, Speaker A: North American actuarial Journal.
00:19:39.464 - 00:19:40.136, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:40.280 - 00:20:06.240, Speaker A: Of course, in real life, we do not withdraw or rebalance continuously. So how good is this analysis here in the real case? Well, we're going to see. Okay, so scenario again, remember that all amounts are an index to inflation. We're going to assume a DC account holder at time zero is 65. This is a scenario we're going to look at. That person has. All my units are going to be in the thousands here.
00:20:06.240 - 00:20:16.628, Speaker A: So you've got 1000k. That is $1 million. Or assume you have a million dollars. The minimum withdrawal we're going to allow you to take is $35,000 per year.
00:20:16.736 - 00:20:17.532, Speaker B: Now, you want to know in a.
00:20:17.548 - 00:20:35.524, Speaker A: Scenario, by the way, I have it down here that, well, I'm going to assume government benefits are 22,000. So you're $50,000 a year, your bare minimum, what you need. So as far as this account goes, we're going to assume you're withdrawing at $35,000 a year as your minimum. The maximum that you're allowed to withdraw is 60,000. Right.
00:20:35.644 - 00:20:37.836, Speaker B: And again, you can think, okay, this.
00:20:37.860 - 00:20:45.920, Speaker A: Is kind of what your target is. Now, let's, let's translate that into that bingen kind of rules. So remember, you've got amend all to start with.
00:20:46.032 - 00:20:50.304, Speaker B: So 35,000 is like 3.5%, right, versus.
00:20:50.344 - 00:21:04.288, Speaker A: The bank and rule four. But we're really hitting for, we want to get 60, which is like 6%, which would be considered extremely large by any financial advisor. Right. They would never get anywhere near that sort of suggestion. But we're going to try to hit that if we can.
00:21:04.416 - 00:21:05.204, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:05.704 - 00:21:31.974, Speaker A: Annual rebalancing withdrawals. We're only going to rebalance once a year. By the way, if you run this with half year quarterly, it hardly makes any difference. Right. I have a rule of thumb that no matter what time period you're going to invest or decumulate anything, if you rebalance more than 20 times, it's like doing it infinitely often. More than 20 over any period is effectively infinite. Well, it's a rule of its own.
00:21:31.974 - 00:22:10.394, Speaker A: And I'm also going to assume that the retiree owns mortgage free real estate worth around $400,000. You're going to ask me, why have I included that? Well, we're going to see the investment horizon is 30 years from age 65 to 95. And again, we plan to live long and prosper. We plan to live for 30 years. So why do we include real estate in this scenario? Well, remember, we have, you can withdraw 35. You have to withdraw at least $35,000 a year. We're going to invest in risky assets.
00:22:10.394 - 00:22:28.934, Speaker A: That means at some point the wealth can become negative. Okay. People say, oh, you can't withdraw anymore when you got negative amount in your account. Well, what I really assume here is that when the wealth is negative, I'm going to assume that you are using your house as your hedge of last resort.
00:22:29.094 - 00:22:29.702, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:29.838 - 00:22:43.974, Speaker A: And you're going to do a reverse mortgage on your house. Right. And a standard rule of thumb about reverse mortgages, it's pretty easy to get a reverse mortgage for half the value of your house. So you've got this last ditch head here around $200,000.
00:22:44.134 - 00:22:48.622, Speaker B: Okay, so once we have our account.
00:22:48.718 - 00:23:02.844, Speaker A: And wealth is negative. All stocks are liquidated, and we're going to assume that debt accumulates at the borrowing weight. In other words, you go negative. Oh, okay. Now I've got a reverse mortgage in my house, and it's going to accumulate. The debt's going to accumulate.
00:23:02.884 - 00:23:04.544, Speaker B: Right. Okay.
00:23:06.444 - 00:23:15.104, Speaker A: If I hit my end time, 95, right, and my wealth is positive, then the real estate is a bequest.
00:23:15.444 - 00:23:16.264, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:17.644 - 00:23:44.736, Speaker A: So I can think of this real estate as a hedge of last resort, and it's not fungible with other wealth. Again, we had a talk this morning where some people talked about the mental bucketing. In fact, this is a pretty standard thing. This sort of mental bucketing of real estate is being not fungible with the rest of your wealth is, in fact, a well known behavioral finance result. People have these mental accounts. They bucket things together, their investment money, and they're real estate. And I'm going to say this, by.
00:23:44.760 - 00:23:47.760, Speaker B: The way, I'm retired and I have.
00:23:47.792 - 00:24:17.824, Speaker A: Lunch with other retirees, and every week we're talking about the 4% rule. And everybody has the same idea, the real estate, that's for my kids, unless I'm in the nursing home and maybe I need it. Nobody ever adds in their real estate as part of their total wealth. So I could say that anecdotally. Anecdotally, this is, in fact, true, this thing about mental bucketing of different sources of income. Okay, so do you also assume that you go below 200k, you have an absorbing state?
00:24:18.364 - 00:24:19.104, Speaker B: No.
00:24:20.524 - 00:24:29.132, Speaker A: Yeah. It keeps on going because. No, no, you just, you just keep on going because it actually weights in the risk. You obviously want to avoid those states.
00:24:29.268 - 00:24:29.516, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:29.540 - 00:24:33.700, Speaker A: And the more you're allowed to do that, of course. But, yeah, I mean, so really what.
00:24:33.892 - 00:24:34.436, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:24:34.460 - 00:24:44.604, Speaker A: We're really what we. What I'm really saying is. Well, really what you want to look at here is the worst 5% case of. -200,000 you think of it that way.
00:24:44.644 - 00:24:44.916, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:44.980 - 00:25:01.304, Speaker A: That's some way they say, okay, we're looking at this tail risk, right. As long as we can be bigger than minus $200,000 because we got a $200,000 hedge floating around somewhere. That's kind of. Okay. That's what we're kind of aiming for. But we allow you to, because we want to make sure that it's bad.
00:25:01.644 - 00:25:02.076, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:02.140 - 00:25:09.218, Speaker A: We don't allow you to default. We got to say, you want to keep that as a very bad state you want to avoid. Right. As much as possible.
00:25:09.396 - 00:25:14.422, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. All out of money and 200k.
00:25:14.478 - 00:25:16.274, Speaker A: Yep. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:18.294 - 00:25:19.634, Speaker B: Yes, yes.
00:25:20.174 - 00:25:23.374, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. You gotta, yeah. You gotta take that money out.
00:25:23.414 - 00:25:23.846, Speaker B: Yes.
00:25:23.950 - 00:25:30.942, Speaker A: Because you, you've said that I need at least $35,000 a year, right? And if you want that cash, you're gonna have to get it from your house.
00:25:31.118 - 00:25:31.914, Speaker B: Okay?
00:25:35.314 - 00:25:56.202, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, in fact, what happens is, you know, these reverse mortgages, they're kind, they're kind of non recourse, right? You can take out money and then the debt just accumulates. And if the amount of the debt is actually bigger than your house value, well, too bad, you know, the bank, you're dead at that point. You walk away, right? And your kids don't get anything, but the bank absorbs the loss. Basically, that's what happens, right?
00:25:56.338 - 00:25:57.094, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:58.794 - 00:26:07.668, Speaker A: Inflation, it's all real. Everything's real. So the stock index has been deflated, the bond index deflated, the amount you withdraw, everything's real.
00:26:07.836 - 00:26:12.304, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:26:12.684 - 00:26:52.204, Speaker A: Right. So what's our numerical technique here? I'll just quickly say something about that. So this, so again, remember that we're solving for the pre commitment control at time zero, but it's actually the same as this induced time persistent strategy. So we start off with those, we have two sort of parameters, if you like, the controls p and the, this parameter, which appears in the expected shortfall, sort of a definition. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to flip the supremums here around and put the control on the inside. And the outside is the w parameter, that parameter which is like the disaster level of wealth. You can think of it that way.
00:26:52.204 - 00:27:02.308, Speaker A: Now I can just solve this problem here using dynamic programming with a fixed value of W. Done. That I maximize over W. Right.
00:27:02.436 - 00:27:02.820, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:02.852 - 00:27:31.886, Speaker A: So I've just flipped these supremums around and now I can solve this problem. It's just a standard optimal control problem because w is fixed. And then I solve that and I maximize over the w. It's an equivalent way to solve the problem. I'm going to solve the inner dynamic programming problem using a PDE method, because I like PDE's. Okay, so this is the inner maximization, since I'm using dynamic programming. It's a conditional expectation.
00:27:31.886 - 00:27:39.634, Speaker A: You have to compute. So you solve a linear two dimensional partial integral differential equation because it's jumped in there.
00:27:40.014 - 00:27:41.206, Speaker B: And we're going to use what's called.
00:27:41.230 - 00:28:06.674, Speaker A: An epsilon monotone Fourier method, which ensures various nice properties of the numerical solution. The optimal controls are at each rebalancing time, we discretize the controls and find the maximum by exhaustive search. Okay. And as we refine the PDE grid, we refine the control grid. This is guaranteed to converge to the correct solution as the mesh size parameters go to zero.
00:28:06.714 - 00:28:06.842, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:06.858 - 00:28:17.056, Speaker A: There's no question here. It doesn't have to be convex or anything. We don't care because we're going to do exotic. This is the most brain dead thing you can do, but it's going to work as we refine the grid.
00:28:17.240 - 00:28:18.084, Speaker B: Okay.
00:28:19.784 - 00:28:27.484, Speaker A: The other maximization over a w style, we discretize on a coarse grid, and then we find the w again by exhaustive search here.
00:28:28.104 - 00:28:29.072, Speaker B: And we cheat a bit.
00:28:29.128 - 00:28:38.364, Speaker A: We use that coarse grid, and then we have a starting point for a 1d solve. This is the only slightly non 100% okay part of the whole thing, right.
00:28:39.264 - 00:28:40.604, Speaker B: Trust me, it's okay.
00:28:41.874 - 00:28:55.322, Speaker A: Okay, so what's the data we're going to use? We're going to use. I think we saw some crisp stuff. Everybody always likes this crisp set. This is Canada, but we're going to go to the US. I had some discussion with my colleague before we started this work, and I really wanted to get data back to.
00:28:55.338 - 00:28:58.178, Speaker B: 1920, 619, 26 to now.
00:28:58.226 - 00:29:08.794, Speaker A: You've got depression, you got a world war, you got high inflation, you got low inflation. It's a real good mix of every possible good and bad thing that could happen, right? So I really like going back to 1926.
00:29:09.334 - 00:29:10.262, Speaker B: So this is a.
00:29:10.318 - 00:29:32.114, Speaker A: So we're going to use this cap weighted index of all stocks and all major us exchanges. Total return index includes dividends and everything from 1926 to the end of 2020. That's our basic data set for the bond, the constant maturity bond index. We're going to use a US ten year treasury index.
00:29:32.734 - 00:29:33.238, Speaker B: Okay?
00:29:33.286 - 00:29:43.682, Speaker A: You buy it, a ten year treasury index. The date of the month, end of the month, you collect the interest and sell it, and then buy another ten year one. So it's a constant maturity ten year index.
00:29:43.858 - 00:29:44.826, Speaker B: It's monthly dated.
00:29:44.890 - 00:29:51.454, Speaker A: Everything's inflation adjusted by the CPI, right? Take all the indexes, adjust them by the CPI, so everything's real.
00:29:52.314 - 00:29:53.842, Speaker B: Now, I'm going to look at what.
00:29:53.858 - 00:30:16.774, Speaker A: I call two kinds of markets here, right? Synthetic market. The stock and bond returns are driven by this parametric jump diffusion models for each stock and bond index calibrated to the data from 26 to end of 2019. Okay? And then as a sort of sample test here, I'm going to look at the historical market.
00:30:17.314 - 00:30:17.786, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:17.810 - 00:30:25.738, Speaker A: And what do I mean by that? The stock and bond returns are determined by stationary block bootstrap resampling of that actual data.
00:30:25.866 - 00:30:26.654, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:26.994 - 00:30:54.064, Speaker A: So this guy here, there's no assumptions here. What the stock and bond process, it's whatever it is. It is. And we're going to use that to test how good the control is. We compute this control in a synthetic market, and then we're going to check robustness by what happens in this synthetic, in the historical market. Okay? And of course, whatever we assume about the process here is irrelevant because we're going to actually test it out on the real data.
00:30:57.304 - 00:30:57.784, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:57.824 - 00:31:23.244, Speaker A: So everybody knows what this is. If I just try to, because I don't want to get very confused here, I'll do the x and y axis thing here. That was great this morning. Somebody took a long time to explain what the x's and y axis, because often you get the low slides and what the hell is that? Oh, slides gone. Oh, I don't know. Anyway, so here, what we're going to do here is we're going to go do these efficient frontiers, right? So on the x axis is the expected shortfall. That's a measure of risk.
00:31:23.244 - 00:31:26.454, Speaker A: Remember that the larger the better, right?
00:31:27.194 - 00:31:28.410, Speaker B: So it's the amount of wealth I.
00:31:28.442 - 00:32:04.670, Speaker A: Have, the worst 5%. So I want to have the largest possible value. And here is the expected average withdrawals per year. So it translated it down to per year. And the efficient frontier means, of course, as we all know, that for this expected value, I go long here and find the largest possible expected shortfall. And similarly, if I'm over here for that value of expected shortfall, I get the largest possible value of expected withdrawals, varying that parameter. The parameter scalarization parameter traces out at an efficient frontier.
00:32:04.670 - 00:32:11.702, Speaker A: Different values of Kappa move along its efficient frontier. Again, so the y axis is the annual average expected withdrawals.
00:32:11.758 - 00:32:12.190, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:12.302 - 00:32:31.514, Speaker A: Now I can translate that to billion. Remember, I started off with a million dollars. So 50 here corresponds to $50,000 a year is 5%. So I'm withdrawing 5% of my initial capital, adjusted for inflation, on average, I think. So that's how I translate the y axis into that bingen rule.
00:32:33.054 - 00:32:33.694, Speaker B: Okay?
00:32:33.774 - 00:32:50.170, Speaker A: And the x axis is its expected shortfall. It's the mean of the worst 5% of the wealth values at time big t. And again, larger is better, right? Okay, so let's look at this.
00:32:50.202 - 00:32:52.442, Speaker B: Well, first of all, you know, are.
00:32:52.458 - 00:33:04.218, Speaker A: We solving this problem? Okay. Yeah, I'm going to say yes, because expected withdrawal, expected shortfall. And I'm solving using a PDE here. So I'm using different grid sizes, 512 by 512, blah, blah, blah.
00:33:04.386 - 00:33:06.770, Speaker B: Well, they actually overlap, right?
00:33:06.922 - 00:33:33.382, Speaker A: I mean, of course, I did cheat a bit. This is a kind of thick line here, but you get the idea, right? In fact, it's hard to see the difference between these things. So clearly what I'm showing you is, yes, the PDE has converged. We've got a converge solution to develop. It's not like, how good is it? It's obviously good for any practical purpose. So each point in the curve is a different value of kappa again. So now we went through this exercise of what your real estate is and everything.
00:33:33.438 - 00:33:36.294, Speaker B: So I said, well, since our reverse.
00:33:36.334 - 00:33:46.384, Speaker A: Mortgage hedge, we can say from a practical point of view, then any point expected shellfall greater than -200k is kind of acceptable, right? I mean, maybe you want to hit.
00:33:46.424 - 00:33:48.712, Speaker B: Zero, but that's a little bit, you.
00:33:48.728 - 00:33:54.184, Speaker A: Know, I mean, you could probably go to -200 right, as being somewhat acceptable. No, this is the worst 5%.
00:33:54.344 - 00:33:54.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:54.864 - 00:34:00.364, Speaker A: So it's not that likely. You know, so you're really being kind of fairly risk averse and you've got your house.
00:34:01.264 - 00:34:02.752, Speaker B: So, you know, I think it's kind.
00:34:02.768 - 00:34:10.008, Speaker A: Of reasonable to say that anything to the right of -200 is probably an acceptable place to be on this sufficient frontier.
00:34:10.176 - 00:34:12.804, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:34:13.184 - 00:34:23.632, Speaker A: By the way, look at how vertical this is at the right hand end here. Right? So this is almost vertical here. So really, I think about down here. Here's why I'm withdrawing $35,000 a year.
00:34:23.648 - 00:34:23.848, Speaker B: Where.
00:34:23.896 - 00:34:36.352, Speaker A: Because the risk aversion proper is in infinity, basically. So this is my minimum withdrawal, 3.5%. And you can see, well, if I'm willing to take on just a teeny bit more risk here, this is still around zero. Right.
00:34:36.528 - 00:34:37.224, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:37.344 - 00:34:49.616, Speaker A: I can go from 35,000 up to almost 50. Right. But nobody's going to want to operate here. Right. You should be at least up here kind of thing. And you can see, oh, I can get up to 5% withdrawal with a.
00:34:49.640 - 00:34:51.264, Speaker B: Tiny amount of risk.
00:34:51.304 - 00:34:53.048, Speaker A: I would say that's a tiny amount of risk.
00:34:53.216 - 00:34:53.880, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:53.992 - 00:34:58.154, Speaker A: Another big problem is that people don't spend fast enough when they retire.
00:34:58.344 - 00:34:59.150, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:59.342 - 00:35:11.794, Speaker A: So what I'm saying is, wow, if you're. You get the mindset. Well, remember, anything over from the right of -200 should be okay. So I can go from here to here. I can go to like 5% pretty easily.
00:35:12.374 - 00:35:15.474, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:35:17.014 - 00:35:32.314, Speaker A: Let's look at the percentiles of the withdrawal control, right? Fifth percentile. Yeah. Well, things are bad. I'm down to the 35. So this is percentile. So each time I look to see what I can withdraw from my optimal strategy. And then I sort them all into percentiles.
00:35:32.314 - 00:35:52.180, Speaker A: So this is zero to 30 years. And you see what happens here. The median here, by the way, goes from the minimum up right up to the maximum pretty quickly by year four or five. Well, by year five, I'd say we're after this. This maximum desired withdrawal percentiles, fraction of the equities. Again, this isn't any given path. Right.
00:35:52.180 - 00:36:12.636, Speaker A: This is, you go along each point, determine the optimal policy in terms of the fraction in equities, and you sort them in terms of percentiles. You can see here's the median. Well, here's like 40%. And it drops down here and goes up a bit. Fifth percentile. The 95th percentile goes up quite a bit, quite high. That's a bit misleading.
00:36:12.636 - 00:36:35.312, Speaker A: And we'll see why in a minute. Okay, so the fifth percentile, wealth at time 30, is around. Oh, by the way. Yeah. What is the actual fifth percentile? Not the expected shortfall? Expected shortfall. This particular value of. We're looking at one point on the efficient frontier, right? That point has an expected short, effective withdrawal of $52,000 a year, 5.2%.
00:36:35.312 - 00:36:51.706, Speaker A: Bingham. And its expected shortfall is -40,000 so you're still much bigger than the -200 so that's probably a good point to be what is the fifth percentile of wealth? It's like positive. It's on 60k. So this is like a reasonable place to be.
00:36:51.890 - 00:36:52.690, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:52.882 - 00:37:00.854, Speaker A: And the annual withdrawal is 52,000, which translates to 5.2%. So we're beating Bengen by a lot at this point.
00:37:02.554 - 00:37:03.466, Speaker B: Okay.
00:37:03.650 - 00:37:07.658, Speaker A: Here's the coolest thing about solving control problems is you get to show these heat maps.
00:37:07.706 - 00:37:07.842, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:07.858 - 00:37:25.406, Speaker A: As a control. Right. So I'll just skip to this one. First of all, here's the normalized withdrawal. What does that mean? Blue is the minimum withdrawal, $35,000. Red is the maximum, $60,000 right here. I've also got the percentiles on here.
00:37:25.406 - 00:37:57.878, Speaker A: Tells you where the percentiles are, each of these points in time, just on top. The interesting thing is here you can see wads brew and then skips immediately to red. Why is that happening? What was that theory I did with a simple case? It was a bang bang control. And in a continuous limit, making a whole bunch of assumptions, you get that the optimal control for the withdrawal is bang bang only ever withdraw at the minimum or the maximum. So now we're going to do a real thing with annual rebalancing. And none of that stuff is true that we assume to make this theory.
00:37:57.926 - 00:38:00.550, Speaker B: Work, and it's obviously for practical purposes.
00:38:00.582 - 00:38:41.410, Speaker A: You have this very small transition zone, but it's effectively bang, bang, right? So that simple theory does, in fact, explain exactly what we see here, even if you do more realistic stuff, right, the optimal withdrawal control is, in fact, bang, bang only ever withdraw at the minimum or the maximum. Right? So this is a function of. Well, right, we have this question is, what's the rule? Right, well, time, right? So if I want to find out what the optimal withdrawal is, I go to. I'm 15. This is. I'm 80 years old here, right? And I say, how much money have I got in my account? And it just tells me, oh, if I'm down here withdrawing the minimum, up here, draw the maximum. So that's the rule, really, all boils down.
00:38:41.410 - 00:38:57.688, Speaker A: There's a curve here which separates the maximum rate. And similarly, over here, you can see, here's the asset allocation heat map, right? And so blue is all bonds, red is all stocks.
00:38:57.776 - 00:38:58.280, Speaker B: Okay?
00:38:58.352 - 00:39:07.808, Speaker A: So again, you want to find out what. What you should do, you go find the time, find out how much wealth you got, and immediately will tell you what your stock bond split should be.
00:39:07.976 - 00:39:13.760, Speaker B: Okay, where.
00:39:13.792 - 00:39:15.084, Speaker A: We're down here. Up here.
00:39:15.904 - 00:39:16.924, Speaker B: Yep, yep.
00:39:22.254 - 00:39:26.914, Speaker A: Below that line, this thing here, it's all blue. That means minimum.
00:39:29.934 - 00:39:30.714, Speaker B: Yep.
00:39:31.494 - 00:39:37.726, Speaker A: Every single time. Well, it depends on what your wealth is. And that figure. Time. Right. But you're given there. You think about this way.
00:39:37.726 - 00:39:46.366, Speaker A: You're sitting here. Any wealth below this value here means minimum. Any wealth above that value, maximum.
00:39:46.510 - 00:39:47.474, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:39:55.684 - 00:40:00.104, Speaker A: This is. Yes, I'm glad. I'm glad you asked that question. Oh, I'm glad.
00:40:00.564 - 00:40:01.252, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:40:01.308 - 00:40:03.716, Speaker A: I'm gonna. This is the Warren Buffett effect, which I alluded to.
00:40:03.740 - 00:40:04.452, Speaker B: Okay, here.
00:40:04.588 - 00:40:15.016, Speaker A: Oh, so great. Oh, you have to wait a slide or two. And I didn't tell you to ask that question, did I? Try again. Yeah. I think you have to buy your drink afterwards. Okay. Right.
00:40:15.016 - 00:40:28.084, Speaker A: Anyway, so. Okay, now, as advertised, I mean, we all know that jump diffusions and stuff aren't that great. And we had some talk here this morning, just previously, about multi regime switching, stochastic volatility.
00:40:28.904 - 00:40:29.712, Speaker B: Yes, of course.
00:40:29.768 - 00:40:33.392, Speaker A: Everything could be better, right? But one of the interesting things is.
00:40:33.528 - 00:40:36.616, Speaker B: Unlike single period, people have this idea.
00:40:36.640 - 00:40:43.062, Speaker A: That, like, for example, single period mean variance is non robust. It depends on the parameters. It's not true for multi period.
00:40:43.118 - 00:40:46.702, Speaker B: Multi period things are actually fairly robust.
00:40:46.878 - 00:41:10.908, Speaker A: And you think about it, why is that? Because they're self correcting. Right? You've got a multi period strategy. If things don't work out very well, you change your strategy as you go along. They're dynamic, so they're kind of self correcting. So they're more robust than you would think. True multi period strategies, and they're robust in the sense as well, is that they're less sensitive to the actual modeling of your stochastic process. How do we know that? Okay, well, here's an example.
00:41:10.908 - 00:41:42.476, Speaker A: So, as advertised here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to compute the control in the synthetic market. The assumed market was based on this jump diffusion model, parametric model, calibrated to the data over 96 years, something like that. Now I'm going to store those controls. Now it's a control I've got. Now I'm going to take those controls and apply them to the bootstrapped historical market. Those controls I computed, I don't care where they came from. Now I'm just going to apply them to the historical data.
00:41:42.476 - 00:42:12.952, Speaker A: Now, this is bootstrap model. I generate lots of bootstrap paths based on the real data, no assumptions about stochastic process. There are blitz block bootstrap resampling. You sample things in blocks and you stick them together. The blocks are supposed to represent the possibility of serial correlation in the data, which there is a little bit. And you can generate millions and millions of these samples and they never, hardly ever repeat using any kind of normal set of parameters. You found the probability of collecting two paths.
00:42:12.952 - 00:42:31.564, Speaker A: The same is like ten to the -20 something like that. Extremely low. You can generate lots of these paths. You got enough data to do that, all based on historical data, no assumptions about parametric level. Here's my theoretical result. In a synthetic market taking those controls, applying in the bootstrap market, what happens?
00:42:31.684 - 00:42:32.644, Speaker B: It's a miracle, right?
00:42:32.684 - 00:42:36.956, Speaker A: It's almost on top of each other. This is much better than I ever would have thought. Right?
00:42:37.140 - 00:42:38.060, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:38.252 - 00:42:52.036, Speaker A: So in some sense, we can conclude that the controls are robust to parametric model specification. And here's the other interesting thing. There's Mister Bengen down there. Remember, this is the 4% rule down here, right?
00:42:52.180 - 00:42:52.540, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:52.572 - 00:42:58.586, Speaker A: This is an efficient frontier situation here, right? So here's the official point here. Look where Bainen is.
00:42:58.770 - 00:43:02.002, Speaker B: This is based on the historical Bengen.
00:43:02.098 - 00:43:40.352, Speaker A: So the historical bingen actually has a expected shortfall of. -270,000 so according to our criteria, you have to reject this as a possible strategy. Right. Your house wouldn't be enough to cover that losses from that vegan. So remember that vengen thing was based on rolling historical years, which is pretty, you know, simplistic statistical test, right? Where bootstrapping, block bootstrapping is kind of considered to be more modern way of doing that kind of bootstrapping. Block bootstrapping, you select blocks of certain expected size, they randomly vary in size and move along kind of things. That's supposed to be a better kind.
00:43:40.368 - 00:43:42.136, Speaker B: Of way to do stuff, I would.
00:43:42.160 - 00:43:47.524, Speaker A: Say this block bootstrapping things now kind of the standard that people use to evaluate strategies.
00:43:48.234 - 00:43:50.018, Speaker B: Okay? So isn't that.
00:43:50.106 - 00:44:03.578, Speaker A: I think that's pretty good. Okay. Okay, what about this funny term here? Oh, what happened at the top there? Well, here's an interesting thing. Remember I said there was this. So here's the objective function, right?
00:44:03.706 - 00:44:07.018, Speaker B: Total withdrawals, the mean of the worst.
00:44:07.066 - 00:44:12.918, Speaker A: 5% of the outcomes. And I said, wow, the stabilization term, right? What is that?
00:44:13.026 - 00:44:17.990, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm going to use two cases here.
00:44:18.022 - 00:44:26.702, Speaker A: Epsilon is ten to the minus minus ten to the minus six. Epsilon is plus ten to the minus six. Now, to give you some idea what's.
00:44:26.718 - 00:44:30.982, Speaker B: Going on here, remember that the relatives.
00:44:30.998 - 00:44:54.242, Speaker A: Of like thousands, that kind of thing. So 1000 times ten to the minus six is teeny compared to this whole objective function. This is a very small back here. So here's the heat map for the asset allocation. Remember, red is all stock, blue is all bonds and everything in between. So there's epsilon equals plus ten to the minus six, and there's epsilon equals.
00:44:54.378 - 00:44:59.454, Speaker B: Minus ten, and all red has gone to all blue.
00:45:00.194 - 00:45:06.174, Speaker A: Okay, now something else to notice. If you look down here from the fifth to the median, they look pretty much the same.
00:45:07.334 - 00:45:08.234, Speaker B: Okay?
00:45:08.654 - 00:45:10.874, Speaker A: Okay, so what's, what's going on there?
00:45:11.614 - 00:45:16.126, Speaker B: Well, okay, in fact, if I plot.
00:45:16.150 - 00:45:20.454, Speaker A: The efficient frontiers for both plus or minus ten to the minus six, they overlap.
00:45:20.534 - 00:45:21.794, Speaker B: You can't tell the difference.
00:45:22.454 - 00:45:59.118, Speaker A: Okay, why is that? Well, let's, let's look at a kind of a simple case here. Suppose that, in fact, remember I had one there where w was around 58,000 somewhere I think, previously. Suppose that your time is at t equals 25. So you're sitting here and you're nine years old at that point, right? Okay, let's suppose your wealth at that point is 2000. In other words, you got $2 million, right? You're 90 years old, you got $2 million left, and the most you can spend every year is $60,000, right? Are you ever going to run out of cash?
00:45:59.306 - 00:45:59.942, Speaker B: Never.
00:46:00.078 - 00:46:14.846, Speaker A: Okay, so it doesn't matter whether you invest 100% in stocks or 100% in bonds, you're never going to run out of. Okay, so you can see what's happening here is the problem becomes ill posed in the top right hand corner without that epsilon.
00:46:15.030 - 00:46:15.686, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:15.830 - 00:46:20.342, Speaker A: So all it does, minus means well and I don't care, I'm going to.
00:46:20.358 - 00:46:22.870, Speaker B: Put everything in bonds and plus means.
00:46:22.902 - 00:46:38.364, Speaker A: Well, I don't care. I'm going to put everything in stocks because it doesn't matter. Maybe my kids will make millions or something. It doesn't really matter if you are Warren Buffett. The problem is ill posed.
00:46:38.944 - 00:46:41.336, Speaker B: If you are rich and old, it.
00:46:41.360 - 00:47:00.634, Speaker A: Doesn'T matter what you do. Our problem we posed is you go to 95, you don't want to run out of cash. You want to withdraw as much as possible for this limit. Well, I've done everything at that point. Right. Well, I'm really lucky and have a lot of money. Well, you know, it doesn't matter anymore what I'm doing.
00:47:00.674 - 00:47:01.254, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:01.634 - 00:47:02.522, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:02.698 - 00:47:06.226, Speaker B: So if you're so really the epsilon.
00:47:06.290 - 00:47:24.732, Speaker A: Here, if it's positive, you're going to invest 100% in stocks and negative, invest 100% in bonds. So it just fixes up that upper right hand corner. But it doesn't really matter what you do at that point. It's not going to change the efficient frontier at all. These lucky large wealth outcomes have no effect on the efficient frontier.
00:47:24.788 - 00:47:25.424, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:29.324 - 00:47:47.856, Speaker A: So that's just an extra term in the objective function and that multiplies wealth. So it's extra term with a small number times wealth. In other words, if I want to maximize the expected wealth and, I don't know, stuff matters. Oh, invest in stocks.
00:47:48.000 - 00:47:48.232, Speaker B: Oh.
00:47:48.248 - 00:47:52.520, Speaker A: I want to minimize the wealth I've got at the end, I'll invest in bonds.
00:47:52.552 - 00:47:52.816, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:52.880 - 00:48:04.404, Speaker A: Remember, this is a very tiny number. And so that's really what it does. It just forces you to either, when the problem becomes ill posed and just make an arbitrary decision, all bonds, all stocks. That's all it does.
00:48:04.824 - 00:48:09.112, Speaker B: Depending on. Yeah, if you want bonds, you can.
00:48:09.128 - 00:48:09.688, Speaker A: Do whatever you like.
00:48:09.736 - 00:48:11.654, Speaker B: Right? Okay. Yeah.
00:48:11.694 - 00:48:28.838, Speaker A: What would you like to do? You decide, it doesn't matter. You're so lucky. It doesn't matter. You're never going to run out of cash. But here's an interesting thing. You look at this, you think, oh, gee, there's some of these cases where 95th percent out, you got to take a lot of risk, invest a lot of stocks. Actually, that's only due to that top right corner because this is the plus epsilon.
00:48:28.838 - 00:48:36.988, Speaker A: This is the minus epsilon case. This is actually interesting. You can see that this minus epsilon case means I'm going to go to bonds when I get really rich.
00:48:37.086 - 00:48:40.392, Speaker B: Okay, so here's the percentile plots of.
00:48:40.528 - 00:48:48.056, Speaker A: The fraction in equities. You can see fraction in stocks time. You can see the 95th percentile are never over 40%, right?
00:48:48.080 - 00:48:52.200, Speaker B: So this is a pretty, you know, unrisky strategy.
00:48:52.232 - 00:48:53.568, Speaker A: You can think about it, right?
00:48:53.696 - 00:48:54.560, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:54.752 - 00:49:08.044, Speaker A: And at the fifth percentile, you de risk, you go 100% of bonds like 20 years, right? And the median even drops down quite a lot, right? So you might think this is for, for most people, they say, well, that's a pretty attractive looking profile to invest in.
00:49:09.544 - 00:49:14.232, Speaker B: Okay, so now here's something which I.
00:49:14.248 - 00:49:15.768, Speaker A: Think is really interesting, right?
00:49:15.816 - 00:49:17.880, Speaker B: And this is, if there's one thing.
00:49:17.992 - 00:49:45.104, Speaker A: That all of you should take away from this talk today, it's this result here. So there's a guy, Peter Ponzo, he's a professor in applied math at Waterloo, right? And he retired in 1993 and he just passed away in 2020, okay? Almost May the 30 years, right? So in 1993 he took the commuted value of his pension. It was a DB plan at that time. You could take it all out if you wanted to put an RRSP.
00:49:45.684 - 00:49:47.092, Speaker B: But his wife actually wouldn't let him.
00:49:47.108 - 00:49:56.730, Speaker A: Take the whole thing out. He wrote a blog about this because it's quite amusing. So one half, he bought an annuity and the interest rate at that time was 9.8%.
00:49:56.812 - 00:49:58.158, Speaker B: But pretty good.
00:49:58.326 - 00:50:31.514, Speaker A: 1993, that one. No. What? No, you see, this is a problem, by the way, that people go on about. Theoretically everybody should annuitize, but there's almost no true inflation protected annuities available, right? So it's actually a bad idea. I mean, there's various reasons why buying annuities are actually, there was a very interesting paper written by an actor, Mary Hardy from Waterloo, and a bunch of other people. And they sort of took issue with our idea about annuities. They said, everybody says it's a puzzle why nobody buys annuity.
00:50:31.514 - 00:50:39.414, Speaker A: And they had 14 reasons. Was it 17? They had 17 reasons why it's a bad idea to buy annuities, one of which was they're never inflation predicted, right?
00:50:39.834 - 00:50:41.170, Speaker B: But of course he was lucky, right?
00:50:41.202 - 00:50:45.026, Speaker A: Because inflation dropped the whole time. He was 9.8%.
00:50:45.210 - 00:50:45.746, Speaker B: So he did.
00:50:45.770 - 00:51:05.380, Speaker A: Well, look at that. Okay. But anyway, the interesting part is the other half. So he did self directed advancements, right? And he wrote a blog about his attempts to beat the market because he was a professor of mathematics. And this finance stuff was pretty trivial, right? Edo's lemma, how hard could this be? Well, it turned out. It wasn't so easy.
00:51:05.452 - 00:51:06.220, Speaker B: Okay?
00:51:06.372 - 00:51:10.188, Speaker A: And he tried all these various things. He. Technical analysis. So it didn't work.
00:51:10.236 - 00:51:13.076, Speaker B: None of this stuff worked. But then he said, well, here's one.
00:51:13.100 - 00:51:14.260, Speaker A: Thing that really does work.
00:51:14.372 - 00:51:15.144, Speaker B: Okay?
00:51:15.524 - 00:51:19.424, Speaker A: He summarized his withdrawal strategy, and he called the Konasta strategy.
00:51:20.364 - 00:51:23.236, Speaker B: This is the quote. If we have a good year, we.
00:51:23.260 - 00:51:24.504, Speaker A: Take a trip to China.
00:51:24.804 - 00:51:26.100, Speaker B: If we have a bad year, we.
00:51:26.132 - 00:51:40.312, Speaker A: Stay home and play canasta. Now, you translate this. This is a bang bang control, right? Only withdraw the minimum or the maximum. So, in fact, you know, his result of just empirical work is exactly consistent.
00:51:40.468 - 00:51:44.632, Speaker B: With our theoretical result and the computational results.
00:51:44.688 - 00:51:55.804, Speaker A: Okay? So that's what you got to remember when you're retired. You do, well, take your money off the table because your objective is to spend the money. You got to remember that as much as possible.
00:51:56.104 - 00:51:56.704, Speaker B: Right?
00:51:56.824 - 00:52:06.444, Speaker A: So now you have to withdraw at the right time, as opposed to injecting cash at the right time. What you're doing before. Okay, conclusions, then.
00:52:07.334 - 00:52:08.566, Speaker B: So what we've got here is an.
00:52:08.590 - 00:52:29.334, Speaker A: Optimal strategy, which is flexible withdrawals and dynamic stock bond allocation. Now, you think about it. That bingen rule, which is the market standard, is constant withdrawal, constant allocation. And I simply said, well, if you allow these to vary and look for the optimal control, you should be able to do better. Of course you can. Right? It's a bigger admissible set, so you must be able to do better.
00:52:29.454 - 00:52:30.222, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:30.398 - 00:52:45.922, Speaker A: And you can do quite a bit better. Right? So, in the continuous limit, the optimal controls are bang bang. Only withdraw at the minimum, the maximum. And that seems to be a robust result. That's also true in the real market. It's true in the historical market. So it seems to be quite a robust result.
00:52:45.922 - 00:52:52.674, Speaker A: Okay? Discrete withdrawals are very close to bang bang, right? And again, the intuition is quite simple.
00:52:52.714 - 00:52:53.298, Speaker B: Right?
00:52:53.466 - 00:52:54.890, Speaker A: If you are lucky and make money.
