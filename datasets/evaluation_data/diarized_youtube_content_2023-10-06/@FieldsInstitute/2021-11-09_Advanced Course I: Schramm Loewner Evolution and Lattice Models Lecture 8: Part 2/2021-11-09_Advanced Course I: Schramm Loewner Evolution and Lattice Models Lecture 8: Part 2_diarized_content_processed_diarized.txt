00:00:00.920 - 00:01:19.016, Speaker A: Okay, welcome back, everybody. Let me continue. Well, actually start the proof of Kakutani theorem. So, we are proving that the function given by running brownian motion up to the boundary of the domain and then taking the expected value, well, that actually would give you a solution to Dirichlet problem. So, first observation that we would make is that suppose that just we have s, which is less than a stopping time tz, then biopsy stopping time theorem. Expectation of f at this exit time is just p's back, right? Because this is again just application of stop short stopping time theorem. More than that, if s is another stopping time capital s.
00:01:19.016 - 00:02:15.992, Speaker A: Now then I claim that this is vowel. This is again two dimensional brownian motion. This is just strong Markov property of brownian motion. So if you just start the brownian motion, time t, so it starts at time s rather. And so if you look at the exit point bz, tz, conditioned on starting at some fixed point Bc's, then of course this has the same law as brownian motion, which you just start at this point and which exists here. So let me try to illustrate it. So, this is our domain, few holes.
00:02:15.992 - 00:02:42.784, Speaker A: Here you run your brownian motion. So this is z. And so this is your brownian motion. Then you stop it at the time b as z. So random point, random stopping time. But what happened next is still brownian motion. Now, started at this point.
00:02:42.784 - 00:03:23.044, Speaker A: And so when you exit the domain, well, this is the same as if you just started running brownian motion from this random point bsz. Okay, so what does it mean? Let's derive something from this. So u of z. This is expected value of f at the exit point. Okay, so now let's apply this. This is expected value of f at this exit point. This is the same.
00:03:23.044 - 00:04:30.220, Speaker A: Now, let's look at this. What is this? This is, uh, at the random point Bc's, right? Because we know that this conditional expectation is the same as conditional expectation of this. So this is expectation of u at this random point Bc's. Let's consider very specific stopping time as capital. Let's consider a disk, which lies inside omega and s would be heating time of the boundary of the disk. So the usual, the first time, the outside of the disk by rotation symmetry of brownian motion, you know that it's conformal invariant. In particular, if you rotate brownian motion, you get back brownian motion.
00:04:30.220 - 00:05:20.304, Speaker A: So Bz's is uniformly distributed on the unit circle, right? Because the only rotational invariant finite probability measure on the circle is lambiec measure. So it's uniformly distributed on this circle. So what is u of z? This is expectation of u at a random point. But this is random point, it's uniform random point on the unit circle. So this is just integral, while the average value of u on the circle of radius arsenal, not unit circle, circle of radius. So this is exactly definition of harmonic function. So we just proved that this solution is harmonic.
00:05:20.304 - 00:06:53.294, Speaker A: And now let us use the peron definition of solution. So we want for every subharmonic function such that when you approach any boundary point, you get lower to be less than our solution and for every super harmonic to be greater. So if you consider a subharmonic function such that this is satisfied, and let's look at the stopping times. Tzn would be the first time, your distance at most 101 from the boundary. Then tz and of course converts to tz, then this exciting thing is a submertingale. Well, I don't want to prove it, but this is really easy to see Beita calculus when v is in c two, and then you just approximate by c two functions to see that this is indeed a submarting. So v at b at the brownian motion starts at z is a submartingale, and so v of z is bounded by v at the point btn of z.
00:06:53.294 - 00:09:02.623, Speaker A: And now let take and go to infinity and by fat two, this is bounded by this, because again, lim slope of v is bounded by f. So we get that v of z is bounded by expectation of f at the exit point, which is exactly u of z. And of course exactly the same reason shows that for super harmonic function with this condition, with this low bound we have that v of z is bigger equals than u of z. So u indeed is a Peron solution to directional problem. Okay, so as I mentioned, and well, I won't do all the details here, but just to hint that just if you know Kakutini theorem, you can derive conformal invariance of brownian motion essentially just by saying that, okay, if you have a random curve for which exit time is conformally invariant and exit time is conforming environment by this exciting theorem, exit time is harmonic measure, which we all know is conformal invariant. Then again, if you have a system of curve so random curve defined in any domain such that exit time of the domain is conformal invariant, then you can derive that actually the curves themselves are conformal invariant. So again, notice that in the proof we used very weak version of conformal invariance here, and that's unavoidable.
00:09:02.623 - 00:10:06.804, Speaker A: So we use the fact that brownian motion is rotationally invariant. But that's, again, that just follows from lv characterization theorem. Okay, so, this is it for livy characterization. Now, let us move on and consider the class of processes which would initially probably seem to be quite exotic. So, I will first motivate why they appeared in mathematics at all, and then we'll see, well, probably even today or maybe next lecture, why they are of crucial importance for Schram Leonard evaluation. So, it's impossible to understand shramle of the revolution without this Bessel process. In a sense, as we will see, evolution is a complex version of Bessel process.
00:10:06.804 - 00:10:50.644, Speaker A: But again, let's play. So, let's start with the following easy computation. So, well, first of all, this is Friedrich Bessel, who, in honor of whom the processes were named. I'm absolutely sure he didn't know about them, but he studied similar equations. So, let's start with standard d dimensional brownian motion, which is started at some point x, which is not zero. And let's look at the absolute value of this brownian motion. Let us try to see what properties does this absolute value have.
00:10:50.644 - 00:11:43.238, Speaker A: So, by standard theta calculus, well, it's easier to take the squared. So, this is. Let me write it in differential notation. Dx t squared is the sum of the components. And again, by the calculus, this is twice integral bjt dbjt plus d dt. And now, this is d times dt plus two xt dzt, where zt is the following. This is simply the integral of absolute value of bj over xx dbj, then, of course.
00:11:43.238 - 00:12:11.550, Speaker A: Yeah. So, you easily see that I simply rewrote this as to xtd. Everything cancels out. Things progress nicely. Okay, now, do you want to type? Sweet follows. I don't want to. Okay.
00:12:11.550 - 00:12:53.774, Speaker A: Now, zt is a local martingale. Well, integral of local martingales. It's continuous integral of continuous local martingales. What is the quadratic variation? You simply compute it, and surprise, surprise, you get that this is just t, because, again, this would be sum of d quadratic equation would be sum of b j squared, absolute values divided by x squared. So, remember that x s is exactly sum of bj squared is sum of b j squared. So. So zt.
00:12:53.774 - 00:13:38.414, Speaker A: By livy theorem, it's a one dimensional brownian motion. Okay, so far, our process. Well, we just wrote this trivial thing that dx t squared is d times dt times two x t d z t. On the other hand, well, we know how to write dx t squared. This is two x t d x t plus d x t. So let's take this and write what dxt dxt is d x t squared minus dx xt divided by two x t. And now let's remember what dx t squared was.
00:13:38.414 - 00:14:20.194, Speaker A: We just plug this in so two xt cancels out. That's why we did this trick at all. And plus d dt minus d xt divided by two x t. So, if you now write it back in the integral form, you notice that this is the only process which has a quadratic variation. This is a process of bounded variation, because, well, here we just take d of some. Well, here, for increasing function xx here, this is just dt. So this is definitely a process of bounded variation.
00:14:20.194 - 00:14:52.924, Speaker A: So, quadratic variation of this is the same as quadratic variation of this. This guy just dies. We take quadratic variation, and we just computed quadratic variation of z. It's t. So quadratic variation of x is t. Aha. So we can just plug this in here now, and we get this Bessel equation that d x t is dzt plus d minus one over two divided by xt dt.
00:14:52.924 - 00:15:52.084, Speaker A: So, absolute value of d dimensional brownian motion satisfies this exciting Bessel equation. And let's write it in integral format here. Allow me to replace zt with brownian motion, one dimensional brownian motion. And we have that it's xt plus x, the value at the beginning, plus d minus one over two, integral from zero to t dx over xs plus bt. Okay, so this is your Bessel processor, but now I want to do it with arbitrary a. So instead of d minus one over two, I want to write it with arbitrary a. So for all x, you define this process using the same instance of granular motion.
00:15:52.084 - 00:16:23.744, Speaker A: And initially, it's defined up to the heating time of zero. So, tx, by definition, the first time you hit zero. After that, well, it's hard to integrate zero, but possible. So it's actually possible to continue defining it. And it's also important for SLV, but it will be probably beyond the scope of this course. So here we are only interested in Bessel process after this time. Tx.
00:16:23.744 - 00:17:01.504, Speaker A: Well, first thing first. Of course it exists when a is equal to d minus one over two. Just proved it that just the absolute value of the dimensional bran and motion. But does it exist further? It does, and this follows from the following. Existence and uniqueness theorem for stochastic differential equations. I will not prove it because, well, I already proved one existence in uniqueness theorem for Leonard, which is a proof of surprisingly similar here. So this is the theorem.
00:17:01.504 - 00:17:56.614, Speaker A: So, we take a standard one dimensional brownian motion. F and g are just two functions defined maybe on random interval zero t, which are just measurable initially. But assume the following. First of all, that they don't grow too much when x increases, so it's bounded by constant times one plus x. And second, that f and g are ellipses uniform in a leapfrog uniformly in t. So the lipstick constant does not depend on t. And let z be a random variable which is independent of the standard brownian motion, and, say, of bounded l two naught.
00:17:56.614 - 00:18:46.884, Speaker A: And now you look at this stochastic differential equation. Dx is equal to f of txt dt plus g of txt db. And I claim that it has unique global solution with starting point x zero. And this xt is adapted with respect to sigma algebra generated by both ft and z. Of course, you need also to include z to make things rigorous. And the moment up to this topic, time t. Remember, we all defined up to time t.
00:18:46.884 - 00:19:38.034, Speaker A: It's bounded by infinity. Okay, so this is the standard theorem. And again, if you saw a proof of any existence and uniqueness theorem with this Liebzz condition anywhere, the proof here works exactly the same. The problem is that, of course, Bessel case is not quite, it doesn't quite satisfy the condition of the theorem. For Bessel case, g is equal to one, but f is a over. Well, why am I writing absolute value of x a over x? This is not Lipschitz. So if you look at the location, so g, which is one DBT, that's perfect.
00:19:38.034 - 00:20:30.514, Speaker A: But f is a of x is definitely not literature. So what do you do? You consider fn, which is f stopped at time n. So you run it up to time n and then say, okay, this is so minimum of a of x. This is definitely lipstick. But notice that solution of the equation with fn to this equation agrees with Bessel solution up to the random time t. This is the first time that xt is less than a over n. Again, I don't know where I type a of x.
00:20:30.514 - 00:21:25.654, Speaker A: So you look at the first time when I know where I wrote it here. So when you look for the first time when you are less than aware, and then up to this time, of course, the solutions are the same. So the solution to the Bessel equation itself exists up to any time t. By uniqueness, they agree for different n. So by the theorem, the solution exists up to t. Now let us for now assume that. Let me write it here.
00:21:25.654 - 00:22:46.704, Speaker A: We'll assume always that x is positive. So we remember we start with some point x, and we will assume list for this lecture that x is positive. Then, as I said, when we study, which is a complex version of this, we would be able to say that x is any complex number. But here x is just a positive number. And the first observation that I want to make about all these processes is that if you have two different starting times and x is less than y, then until you hit tx, until x hits zero, actually there is a strict inequality between them that xxt is strictly less than xyt. That's why I wanted to run the first, the same instance of brownian motion for all time. Let me prove it for you.
00:22:46.704 - 00:23:27.524, Speaker A: So, assume that t is less than this heating time of zero. And let's look at the difference x y t minus xxt. Let's look at the integral. So here bt cancels out. All is left is this. And so this is x y t minus x 60 is bound, is equal to y minus x minus integral from zero to t a. Well x s y minus xxx divide by x s y x s this.
00:23:27.524 - 00:23:59.814, Speaker A: So this difference is differentiable. Fundamental theorem of calculus. And we have the following differential equation which can be solved. So here's the solution. Again, it's very explicit solution, but it's the solution. And this is positive because there is an exponent here. So y minus x positive multiplied by this exponential.
00:23:59.814 - 00:24:51.958, Speaker A: And since none of them is zero, this thing is strictly positive. Okay, so before x process started at smaller number hit zero. You stay above it. But of course, it means that you cannot process start with y, cannot hit zero before process starts at x, but they can hit them zero simultaneously. And that's what would actually happen a lot for certain values of it. And another thing which is very important here, that it's for one point discussion. It's enough to study processes which originate at one.
00:24:51.958 - 00:25:44.094, Speaker A: So x one t has the same law as the process started at x, ran with x squared, and then divided by x. And for this, you just plug everything in on this equation. So if you plug this process in that equation, you get positive solution, and brownian motion satisfies exactly the scaling. So that's why it will be a solution. And it starts at one, because, well, plug in t equal to zero, this would be one over x times x of zero, which is x. Okay, so this were easy observations. And now we come to the big theorem which would allow us to really study schramme revolution.
00:25:44.094 - 00:26:55.834, Speaker A: So this is a full classification of what happens with these processes for different values of a, first of all, when a is big or equal than one half, then you never reach zero. Probability that t is infinite is equal to one. And this probability for all x, the probability that tx is infinite for legs, is equal to one. So you start your process, they go back and forth, but they never reach zero. But on the other hand, if a is less or equal than one half, then infinium of the process is zero. So interesting thing happens when a is equal to one half. And that actually would correspond to one of the most interesting in my opinion, sle four, your process never reaches zero, but it approaches zero.
00:26:55.834 - 00:27:56.682, Speaker A: Arbitrary clause femoral is zero, never reached. But when a is strictly bigger than one half, that actually your process almost surely tends to infinity for all x. On the other hand, well, as you would expect, when a is less than one half, you hit zero at finite time. So your process would terminate in finite time. So eventually each point would hit zero more than that. If a is strictly between one four and one half, then if you take any two points, then this non zero probability, they hit zero together. That's exactly the phenomenon I was talking about, that it could happen that x hit zero at the same moment y had zero.
00:27:56.682 - 00:28:42.894, Speaker A: So this has non zero probability, not probability one, because then of course everything would collapse immediately. But with non zero probability, they would collapse to zero together. On the other hand, when a is less or equal than one quarter, this probability one. On one hand, you hit zero, of course, so TX is less than infinity, but on the other hand, they're strictly monotonous. So you, each point is heated in its own time. No two points get to zero at the same time. Okay, so this is a statement.
00:28:42.894 - 00:29:41.204, Speaker A: Now let us prove it. So for this first thing first, we'll create a martingale, which would allow us to study properties of this process. And here there will be some interesting points, I think. So fix our x and fix two guys, one below X x one, one above x x two. Enter process xt. Well, it goes, and at certain time it hits either x one or x two. Now.
00:29:41.204 - 00:30:48.064, Speaker A: So now we'll be hitting time of these two points. And Phi of X would be Phi of X x one f two. What is the probability that we hit the above point x two? Now let us look at what is Phi at the point xx theta. So what does it mean? Let's remember the definition. This is the probability. And when you start at this random point, you hit x two. So this is the same as if you look at Phi over of X X Tau, because Phi, remember it's the probability that you are at X two.
00:30:48.064 - 00:31:37.054, Speaker A: So what is the phi at this point? Xx star. Well, it's one if you're x two and zero if you already x one, right, you already hit it. So this phi at Xx Tau is by definition just expectation of what would happen with phi at the end at the time tau given ft. So this is a martingale, right? Because the value here is expectation of some function, conditional expectation with respect to ft. So it's a martingale. And here comes the trick. I want to compute this function.
00:31:37.054 - 00:32:18.114, Speaker A: I want to compute this file. And what happens is actually, well, standard trick, which helps a lot, and, well, we'll see a lot of uses of it a bit later. Let's dream first. So in our dream, phi is a function from C two. We don't know it, right? This is just the probability that you started at X and you hit X two first. But let's dream that it's in c two. Why not? And let's just write down it is formula.
00:32:18.114 - 00:33:08.142, Speaker A: So by it is formula for functions from C 2d phi. At this point, at this time, t is first, it's phi prime dxx. So this is a local martingale term. Well, not quite, because dxx itself is not local martingale. Right? Xx is not local Martin plus one half phi prime multiplied by D of quadratic variation of xxv. But it's just t as we know. So we have this, and now let's remember that this guy satisfies differential equation.
00:33:08.142 - 00:33:35.178, Speaker A: That's the differential equation. So this is phi prime times DBT. This is definitely a martingale. Well, we are dreaming. So originally it was local Martingale, but in our dream, it's allowed just to be Martingale. And this is a process of bounded variation. So this thing appeared because of the definition of Bessel process.
00:33:35.178 - 00:34:19.588, Speaker A: And this is this phytoprime over two. So this is times the t. And I realize that I should have put the t here. So let me add it. And now, since Phi itself is a martingale, we know it. And at the sum of this martingale and this process of bounded variation, this thing should die. So Phi should satisfy this differential equation for all legs between x one and x two.
00:34:19.588 - 00:35:03.324, Speaker A: And at x one, remember, it should be zero. At x two, remember, it should be one. Okay, but as I said, that was a dream, because we did assume that phi is in c two, but we don't know it a priori. So what do we do? We go backward. We say, okay, we don't know that phi is in c two. But why don't we just solve this, find phi the solution of it, and then prove that this is actually, that this phi satisfies. This thing that we would find is the probability that we hit.
00:35:03.324 - 00:35:52.914, Speaker A: So this is the trick. You start with dream that your probability is two differentiable, find differential equation, solve it and prove that the solution is actually your fine. And of course after that things are much easier because this is your solution. So this is the solution to this differential equation. Subject to this constraint, phi is zero five x two x one. So I promised you that one half would be special. And indeed that's what makes it special that the solution has logarithms.
00:35:52.914 - 00:36:34.124, Speaker A: So log x minus log x one divided by log x two minus log x one. On the other hand, for other a, we have x to one minus two a, minus x one to the power one minus two a, divided by x two to the power one minus two a, minus x one to the power one minus two a. So you clearly see that there is a phase transition. There is something changing here. Exactly at a is equal to one half, because for a bigger than one half, this powers are negative. For a smaller than one half, the spouse of positive. Okay, so this is the solution.
00:36:34.124 - 00:37:09.672, Speaker A: Now let us look at this guy. Phi naught of xxt. This is bounded Martingale on the interval x one x two bounded between one and zero and one. Why is it a martingale? Because drift term disappears. You do this calculation for d phi naught and you see that it is just phi integral of phi prime dbt. This terminal just dies. Just dies.
00:37:09.672 - 00:38:08.234, Speaker A: That's the beauty of this term is dead. So this is a bounded martingale which is equal to zero at x one and one and x two. So probability that at this time ui x two is the expectation of m infinity with respect to f zero with respect to, but now if not at moment f zero at time zero, you are at x. So expectation of this m infinity is just phi naught of x, because this is a martingale. And again, you run it up to time infinity, it's bounded. So it has a limit. And this limit is surprise, surprise is the value.
00:38:08.234 - 00:39:14.394, Speaker A: So let me write it down that m infinity is fine, naught at xx tau. So, right, that's what happened when you run to infinity. So this is, let me actually continue here that this is equal to one if xx tau is equal to x two and equal to zero if x tau is equal to x one. So this is exactly so this probability is exactly this expectation. So this is, again, because it's a martingale. This is just finite. So Phi of x, x one, x two is, well, it's phi naught of x.
00:39:14.394 - 00:40:28.714, Speaker A: Okay, so one question is, why would we reach both x one and x two in finite time? This you can do by. Again, this is something I'm skipping here. Just wanted you to be aware what I skipped here. Why would you reach in finite time? You can compare this process with this brownian motion. And if you know that you always between x one and x two, then actually this would be brownian motion with the positive drift, which is between x one and x two. So brownian motion is positive drift and finite time hits x two. So the question is, what would it hit first, x one or x two? Okay, so this comparison with brownian motion would bite us later too.
00:40:28.714 - 00:41:51.734, Speaker A: Okay, now let's, now let x one go to zero in this expression. So let's notice that if a is big or equal than one half for any x two, then this limit is equal to one. So what it means is that when x two, you fix x two, and then this x two would be this high probability hit before zero. So this probability one, it would be hit before zero, right? So you just select x one close enough to zero. So this thing is very close to one. And then with this probability one minus epsilon, you hit x two first. On the other hand, if a is less than one half, then again, you look at this, and this limit is x over x two to the power one minus two a.
00:41:51.734 - 00:42:36.694, Speaker A: So you hit any x one before x two with this probability. Well, this probability, one minus this. Let's be careful. And so when x two goes to infinity, it means that you hit any x one before this x two with probability arbitrary close to one. So it means that tx less than. Okay, now what does it mean? It means that for fixed x, t is equal to infinity. Almost sure, but I said that it's true for all x.
00:42:36.694 - 00:43:38.864, Speaker A: But again, now, countability argument, since it's proven for all x, it's proven for all rational x. Well, so again, for every, since it's proven for every fixed x, it's proven for rational x. And again, if we use monotonicity because we know that if x is less than y is less or equal than t y, we can go from rational to everything. So, for example, if all rational, all rational escape to infinity, never hit zero, then everything between them short and the same. Here, if all rational eventually hit zero, every number is smaller than some rational number, so they would hit zero eventually, too. So we just proven one and four. Okay, let's move on from this.
00:43:38.864 - 00:44:42.324, Speaker A: Let us now take the limit of this. When x two tends to infinity. And again, it's easy to see. So let's look at the formula that when a is less or equal than one two, then this is zero. So you hit x one before escaping to infinity with probability one, right? Remember that this is probability that you hit x two. So it means that in the moment of your process is zero, because otherwise, you know, for sum x two with positive probability, you, sorry, for some x one with positive probability, you would hit it and then just move one and hit x two. You never hit x one, so that cannot happen.
00:44:42.324 - 00:45:27.774, Speaker A: So we have this, which implies two. Okay, now let's look at the case. A is bigger than one half. In this case, this limit is one minus x one over x divided to the power two, a minus one positive power. So this means that lim soup is infinite, almost shoulder. Right? So this positive probability, this probability, as close to one as you want. If you make x one small, you hit all x two s before hitting this x one.
00:45:27.774 - 00:46:37.606, Speaker A: So lim soup again is infinite. But I claim more. I claim that actually it escapes to infinity, and we'll use it. So let us look at this case, and let us prove that this limit is infinite. And let's define tn to be the first time that you hit two to the n. And now, by definition, we'll define l to be the limit when x two goes to infinity of phi naught of phi x one, x two. So this is exactly this, what I wrote here, one minus x one over y over two, y minus one.
00:46:37.606 - 00:47:25.358, Speaker A: This is a limit up to infinity. Then. Well, an easy calculation shows that the difference between phi naught and l is just bounded by y to the power one minus two a minus x two to the power of one minus two a multiplied by x one, x two over two a. So what does it mean? So let's look at the probability that you can find some t between. Remember what this was? This was the first time you hit two to the n. This is the first time you hit two to the n plus one. And I want it to be less than two n over mn.
00:47:25.358 - 00:48:07.344, Speaker A: I will select mn later. This is just phi of. Again by scaling, this is the same as you start at two to the nice. And you hit this before you hit this twine over mn over. And you plug in this inequality. This is bounded by c over mn to the power to a minus one. Now, if you take mn to be n to the power two over two, a minus one, then well you get that something where you can use bar Alcantelle.
00:48:07.344 - 00:49:18.054, Speaker A: So you sum the probabilities that this happened that you dropped below the level two n over mn, two n over two over two, n over two, n minus one. And the sum, of course by our choice it's bounded by infinity. So by barrel can tell for some n inf starting from the same infimum of all x dx between tn and tn plus one is bounded below by two to the n over n to the power two over two, n minus one. So this happily tends to infinity. Okay, because again we know that starting from some moment between two to the n and two to the n plus one, you don't go too much below. So this infinium actually also tends to infinity. So the standard parallel cantily argument, which gives us this convergence to infinity.
00:49:18.054 - 00:50:11.734, Speaker A: Now I want to look at the case a less than one half. And that's slightly more interesting because now we want to study the probability that at certain to certain points hit zero at the same time. So this scaling, well, we can use scaling to see that this is the same as starting the probability that both process started at X over Y. At one they hit zero at the same time and X over Y is less than one. Okay, so we'll study this after a short break. So we'll reconvene at noon Toronto time.
