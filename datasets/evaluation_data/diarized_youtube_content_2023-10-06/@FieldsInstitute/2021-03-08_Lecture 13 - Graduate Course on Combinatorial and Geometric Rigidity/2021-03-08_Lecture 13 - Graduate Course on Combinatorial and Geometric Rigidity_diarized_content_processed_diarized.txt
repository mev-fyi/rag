00:00:00.200 - 00:01:03.546, Speaker A: Yes. So we've had a break for a couple of weeks while it was the workshop and the mini symposium. And so I'd originally planned to have a kind of discussion session today about what people had found interesting in the workshop, in the mini symposium, and what sort of topics you would like to cover in the rest of this course. We'll still do a little bit of that if we have time. But for those of you who are at the companion graduate course at merit to teachers yesterday, that there was a lot of that happened there anyway, and for another reason, that the last lecture I sort of got halfway through a topic I wanted to cover. So I think I should first finish that topic, and then if there's time, towards the end of this lecture. So there may be times you might think about what you would like to see in this course going forward, because I, in the next few lectures I will finish the sort of core main focus and then start into the sort of more topic driven part of the course.
00:01:03.546 - 00:02:01.754, Speaker A: But for now, let's continue with where we were at the end of the last lecture, whenever that was. And so we had shown that we're talking about global rigidity in two dimensional space for generic frameworks. We had shown that globally rigid frameworks are redundantly rigid and they're free connected. And we were looking at the converse when is a redundantly rigid and free connected graph globally rigid? Our aim is to show that all such graphs are. We showed that all graphs generated from k four by the one extension operation and from edge additions are globally rigid. And so now we were looking at the combinatorics and we were focusing on the special case where the graph is an r two circuit. So briefly, that's a graph, g equals vertical, whose number of edges is equal to twice the number of vertices minus two, and the number of edges induced by any subset is at most two x minus three for all subsets, proper subsets x of the vertex set with at least two elements.
00:02:01.754 - 00:02:04.594, Speaker A: Okay. And so what we did last time.
00:02:05.134 - 00:02:09.594, Speaker B: Hi, is there any dimension restriction?
00:02:10.134 - 00:02:13.586, Speaker A: So this is an two reals circuit. So this is a two dimensional thing. Yes.
00:02:13.710 - 00:02:14.666, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:02:14.810 - 00:03:01.152, Speaker A: So if you remember back to when we were showing globally rigid implied redundantly rigid, we could do that in D dimensions. And so the redundant rigidity was in d dimensions, and we showed the d plus one connectivity, but now we're thinking only about two dimensions. And so we've restricted down to redundant rigidity of circuits in two dimensions and to d plus one. So free connectivity. And so this two really corresponds to the dimensions so that's the two that's there, and there's is really the dimension where we're living in as well. It just happens that count is what happens. So what we showed last time was a number of preliminary lemmas that built up some structural information about circuits, about two reals circuits, these particular class of graphs here.
00:03:01.152 - 00:03:48.106, Speaker A: And we're going to continue that to try and find an admissible node whenever the graph is a free connected circuit. And so, just to remind you, node is my shorthand for vertex of degree free. By admissible, I mean we start with a circuit, we pick a node, we can do a one reduction. So we pick our vertex of degree free, say v, and we delete v and its free instant edges and add an edge among the neighbors. But admissible means one of the three possible reductions gives you another circuit. So we can do a one reduction, the one reductions that can be problematic. And the way they go wrong in terms of not preserving the circuit property is when there exist critical sets.
00:03:48.106 - 00:04:38.990, Speaker A: So that's a subset of the vertex set with two x minus three edges in it. Critical sets on their own are not necessarily problematic because there could be a critical set x living over here and we're trying to reduce v where there's lots more stuff in the way. And so there's no real effect when you add the edge over here. But the critical set is called vcritical if it's actually blocks v from being admissible. So it looks like over here it contains the two end vertices of the edge you add, for example. And then we talked about the version of critical sets that we're actually working with, which is called node critical, which is when you're a v critical set. But you also have this additional property that the third neighborhood, this one over here, which is not in the critical set, that's not so hard to show.
00:04:38.990 - 00:05:07.374, Speaker A: But the, if that third neighbor had degree free, it's kind of a trivial case. And so node critical has this extra assumption that the third neighbor has degree, at least four. So this is just a very quick reminder. We went through all of that last time, but it was a while ago, so I just wanted to put these terms back in your mind, but I went fast. So do feel free to ask anybody questions if you like. Sorry, you just repeat node critical again.
00:05:08.154 - 00:05:10.174, Speaker B: A bit about the third vertex, please.
00:05:10.554 - 00:05:56.076, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So we take a v critical set. So that means that it's a critical set for some pair of neighbors, x and y of v. And so it's a critical set of this condition. But if this vertex here had degree three, then that's a particular special case that we sort of say it's a trivial case. The point being that if you imagine, say you have your vertex, I'm just drawing the same picture again. But if this vertex has degree free, and we want to add this edge, then in the smaller graph where that edge has been added, this is xy to xy, this vertex here dropped from degree three to degree two.
00:05:56.076 - 00:06:46.894, Speaker A: And so it's sort of obviously not going to be a circuit, because circuits have minimum degree free. So it's a very trivial reason that the one reduction fails to preserve the circuit property. So in some sense that this is trivial, in sense that it's kind of easy to see the failure. Whereas if we have the degree at least four here, then this was degree at least three. So you're less problem, less obvious there's going to be a problem and it becomes a bit harder. And so they're the non trivial critical sets are these node critical sets, which are critical sets for a particular vertex with degree at least four. But the way it's set up, and this is just following the Bergen Jordan paper, is that v critical specifically refers to a vertex v, whereas node critical means you're v critical for some vertex v.
00:06:46.894 - 00:06:51.522, Speaker A: Okay, so hopefully all of that is now a bit clearer.
00:06:51.698 - 00:06:52.874, Speaker B: Yes, thank you.
00:06:53.034 - 00:07:26.404, Speaker A: Yeah, and Alex has said similar in the chat as well. Okay, so here's a lemma. And actually, this lemma is really the sort of result that I need to have sort of four boards in a room. So I don't know if we can make the technology on Zoom to have a sort of a board up here and here and here and here, so that you can see the previous parts of the proof. If you could do that, then. Then I think the proof would be much easier to follow. So I will go slowly.
00:07:26.404 - 00:08:08.944, Speaker A: But if it's not so digestible at certain points, please ask. But also, their paper is really well written, so it is possible just to read the roof and draw your own pictures as well. I will try to make it as clear as I can, but it may be a bit difficult. So this is the key lemma, I think, in their paper. So what does it say? You take a free connected circuit, and as far as I remember, the free connected hypothesis is to apply some of the lemmas from the last lecture. We're not explicitly going to see it in the steps I do. I don't think at least maybe it's once or twice, if at all, but we take a free connected circuit and suppose it's not a wheel.
00:08:08.944 - 00:08:43.854, Speaker A: So in case you don't remember, wheels had this special property where there was, where you look at all the nodes in the graph. So here it's those five. But the sub graph induced by the nodes is a cycle. Whereas we showed last time that if you're not a wheel, then the sub graph induced by the nodes is a forest. So forests have nice properties that make things a bit easier to deal with. In particular, they have leaves. And we also said that, well, wheels, every vertex around the outside has degree free.
00:08:43.854 - 00:09:19.122, Speaker A: So what we can do is remove that vertex and add an edge and make a smaller wheel. So there is sort of easy case you can deal with. Anyway, so suppose we're a free connected circuit that's not a wheel. Choose a degree free vertex, a node v with neighbors x, y, z. One of the neighbors has degree at least four, and x is a v critical set containing the other two. So this is exactly saying that x is a node critical set and it's node critical for the vertex v. Okay, and then we're going to suppose one of two hypotheses is true.
00:09:19.122 - 00:10:06.452, Speaker A: So the first one is that there's a nonadmissible series node. And so, just to remind you that in the, you take all the vertices of degree three in the subgraph induced by them, a vertex could have degree zero or one, it could have degree two, or it could have degree three. The first case is called leaf node. Second case is called series, and the third case is called branching. So what we're going to do in the end proof is we're going to pick a node, but we're going to be able to choose one within the forest of nodes. We can pick a leaf in the forest of nodes, but we can only do that for a, in a particular sub forest of this forest of nodes. And hence when you move up from the sub forest of the whole thing, it might change from being a leaf to something else.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:43.912, Speaker A: So we do have to deal with a second case. We can avoid the branching case, which we talked about last time was bad, but we have to deal with non admissible series nodes and non admissible leaf nodes. And that's the difference between part a and b. So in a, we suppose there's a non admissible series node called, uh, in v minus x minus v. So we'll see pictures of this again in a second. But there was a lemma last time that said if you have a critical set, so say we have a critical set x and it's v critical. Then of course X Union V is a critical set as well.
00:10:43.912 - 00:11:27.978, Speaker A: It's just adding a degree two. So that's easily, see, that's critical. But the dilemma said that outside of any critical set, as long as there's at least two vertices, then there's some node. So we know we're going to be able to find, because we start with node critical. So this guy has degree four. So we find over here there's at least two vertices in this sort of blob I've drawn here. If there is a non admissible series node u in that blob with precisely one neighbor w in x, and that neighbor w over here in X is a node, then there will be a node critical set x in G that properly contains x.
00:11:27.978 - 00:12:35.724, Speaker A: So the point of this is we're going to set up a sort of maximality contradiction that in the main theorem we will say suppose X is a maximal node critical set, and use this lemma to find that there is a larger node critical set that contains the first one. And so that will give us a contradiction. But this is the conclusion for the lemma is all this setup that I sort of tried to sketch here, but you'll see a more clear picture in a moment, tells us there must be some bigger node critical set than the one x that we started with, and it also that it properly contains x. And then part b, we do the same thing, except instead of having a series node over here, we take a non admissible leaf node and I just give it a different name. And this time we don't care about this extra condition about the neighbors. Okay, so it's quite a mouthful of a statement to take in, but let's have a go through the proof and maybe it'll become come more and more clear as I'm working through it. So part a, so here's the picture on the right, but I take u in v minus x minus v.
00:12:35.724 - 00:13:08.914, Speaker A: So V is our non admissible node we started with, and x is the critical set for the neighbors x and y of v, and z is the third neighbor with degree at least four. U is the non admissible series node we found outside of x union v. And let's say its neighbors are wp and q. By our assumption, w is in x. And we know that you had exactly one neighbor in X. So the neighbor set of U intersect X is w. And also we assumed that w was a node.
00:13:08.914 - 00:13:43.136, Speaker A: So we have all this, this picture on the right. We also said that U was a series node. So we know that two of its neighbors have degree three and one doesn't. One has degree higher than three. So let's say that P has degree three and the degree of q is at least four. Okay, so now we have this, this exact picture on the right, and we want to try and find some critical set that contains x, which is node critical for some vertex and it's bigger than x properly contains x. Okay, u is non admissible.
00:13:43.136 - 00:14:11.232, Speaker A: So we learned last time that that tells us there exists a u critical set y for the pair wp. So there's a critical set containing w and p but not q and not u. So this is a critical set called y. Okay, since gv. So now we want to start understanding properties of this set y. So the first one is that it can't be a single edge. So a single edge is a critical set.
00:14:11.232 - 00:14:50.808, Speaker A: But what would that mean? That would mean w, which is a node, p which is a node and u which is a node were contained in a triangle. So that would contradict the fact the forest of no, that the subgraph of nodes is a forest. So we know this edge can't be present and hence the critical set containing w and p must have size at least three. Okay, so this is where I want to keep the picture, but keep going with the words as well. Okay, so since it's a critical set with at least three elements, and critical means that ix is two x minus three. We know that the subgraph induced by the critic. Oh, sorry, two y minus three.
00:14:50.808 - 00:15:20.832, Speaker A: I'm just used to x's. This means the subgraph induced by the critical set is a two connected graph. The only chance it's not too connected is if it's a single edge, but it has at least three elements. Since it has at least three elements. Sorry. Since it has, it's two connected, that means that every vertex has degree at least two. In this graph g induced by y, so y contains at least two neighbors of w, but it does not contain u.
00:15:20.832 - 00:16:23.440, Speaker A: And w is a node so it contains these two vertices over here. Okay, so I guess I don't really need to say that the next sentence, but this tells us that the intersection of the set y and the set x over here, this, this blob has at least two elements in it. But since the intersection has at least two elements, we don't need to worry about the special case for the count for a single vertex compared to the two v minus three count. So we can apply a lemma from last time to say that x union y is a critical set. So if you look at x union y here, we know it doesn't contain q, and hence it's a larger node critical set for the vertex u than x was. X is not a maximal node critical set. So x dash is x union y is u critical with its two of its neighbors in there.
00:16:23.440 - 00:16:49.514, Speaker A: And the third neighbor has degree, at least four, hence. Oh, and I guess the important point was that you had exactly one neighbor in x. So this vertex p was in x union y, not in x. So x union y is strictly bigger than x. And so since p is not in x, x dash is node critical and properly contains x. So that's proved there. The first part, that was the easier part of this, this lemma.
00:16:49.514 - 00:17:09.826, Speaker A: But we used the non admissibility of u to find a critical set here, and we used the properties of that we were given in lemma to show the union of x and Y was a bigger node critical set. It wasn't for the same vertex v. It moved to u, but that wasn't part of the statement. So that was okay. Okay, so let's look at part b. We want to do the same.
00:17:09.850 - 00:17:12.814, Speaker B: Can you see the statement of the lemma just briefly?
00:17:13.264 - 00:17:45.384, Speaker A: Sure. I can't quite fit it all on, but maybe that's the bit you want, and maybe all the color is distracting. Let me try and get some color out the way for you. So is this something you're worried about, Alex?
00:17:46.404 - 00:17:49.744, Speaker B: No, I just wanted to read it again. That was good. Thank you.
00:17:51.084 - 00:18:20.684, Speaker A: Okay. Yes. So now we're going to start. Oops, part b. So now instead of assuming this series node with precisely one neighbor, instead we're only going to assume a leaf node, and then we know nothing about how many neighbors it has in X or not. And so part of the extra difficulty in part b is going to be dealing with the various options there. Okay, so again, we have a non admissible node v.
00:18:20.684 - 00:18:41.834, Speaker A: Two neighbors, X and Y are in some critical set, a node critical set. So the degree of z is at least four. We have a non admissible leaf node T. T is nonadmissible. So there exist t critical sets. Let me make that more clearly. A y rather than a half.
00:18:41.834 - 00:19:34.662, Speaker A: This is a node critical set y two, and a node critical set y one for two of the pairs of the edges and by of the neighbors, sorry, biolummer, from last time. You know, in fact that there's always one, two, three possible critical sets that block the three possible reductions. So from a lemma from last time, we can always choose two of them, y one and y two, such that y one union y two is actually all of the graph except for the critical set that they intersect in at least two elements. And so that if t has a neighbor of degree free, if t has a neighbor r, which is a node, then we can choose r to be in the intersection. So that's what I've done here. So r is in the intersection, y one and y two. So t was anonymous leaf node.
00:19:34.662 - 00:20:14.074, Speaker A: So it might, may or may not have a neighbor which is a node. If it does, it has exactly one. And we can choose that one to be in the intersection and know that these other ones have degree, at least four. Okay, so by the way, I should also, in case it wasn't clear here, y one union y two is everything apart from t. So while I've drawn the picture over to the right, that's because I don't know yet where y one and y two intersect with x and v and z. So I just drew it to the side rather than. We're now going to have to work on whether parts of y one and y two intersect which parts of x to try and get x union something to be a bigger node critical set.
00:20:14.074 - 00:21:06.350, Speaker A: Okay, so y one and y two are node critical and have at least three elements. Okay, if x was only a single edge, then this would be an easy case because x and y are in the union y one union y two. Because y one union y two is v minus t. But we know that since they give us everything we know, if this was a counting thing we did last time, that the edges between them don't exist. Okay, so xy can't be like that. I'm saying, so xy would be in here or it would be in here. So it's induced by one or over of the yi.
00:21:06.350 - 00:21:44.702, Speaker A: And if that's true, then since y one or y two, whichever one it is, has more than two elements in it, we would know that this x was size two and y one or y two would be size three. Intense, would be at least three. So it would be a bigger node critical set. So we could just take whichever one it was and would be done. So we can assume X size at least three. We know that everything but t is in Y one and y two, and we know t is not in X. Hence these sets of size three, at least one of them.
00:21:44.702 - 00:22:24.720, Speaker A: So X has at least three elements and all of them are in Y one union y two. And there's only two of them. So one of them has to have at least two of them. Okay? And now we have at least two. We can take the union of X and Y one. Okay? But first, and what I want to worry about is this verte node t, how many of its free neighbors lie in X? Okay? So we have a critical set x, and there's this node t. If it has two neighbors in X, since it's not the neighbor of v of degree at least four, then X union t is critical.
00:22:24.720 - 00:23:01.474, Speaker A: And our bigger node critical set would just be x plus t. So that was a trivial case. So we know the number of edges between t and the critical set x is at most one, which is basically saying that the neighbor set of t intersect X is at most one. We just said that X intersect Y one has at least two elements. So x union Y one is critical. Again, this is a lmma from last time, so now we can look at this picture. So again, v x Y critical set X.
00:23:01.474 - 00:23:40.630, Speaker A: The reason that X is node critical is Z has the high degree. We know that at least two neighbor at least two things in the intersection of X and Y one and t has its. If there's a low degree thing, it's in the intersection of Y one and y two. And here's our non admissible leaf node t. Okay? So now we want to, we know there's at most one of the neighbors of T is in X, but we want to worry about exactly how that happens. So here's a case. Suppose the neighbor set of t intersect X is contained in Y one.
00:23:40.630 - 00:24:08.170, Speaker A: So we know that we know there's some nice intersection here. Suppose that contains the neighbors. So maybe both of these, or maybe one of these. Oh, sorry. At most one of these, because we already, we got this. But now the lemma would be complete because we could just take x to be x union y one. Because if the neighbor set here is contained in Y one, then this vertex, which we know has degree at least four, is not in x union y one.
00:24:08.170 - 00:24:36.064, Speaker A: And so x union y one is node critical for t. So we'd be done. Okay, so we know there's at most one neighbor of t in X. And we can assume that the neighbor of set. I guess, I guess I've gone to an equals one to make this. So maybe that becomes clear in a moment. But so for now, assume that the neighbor set of t intersect x is s and s is not in Y one.
00:24:36.064 - 00:25:18.830, Speaker A: So s is some vertex over here that's really, this is maybe just make a big vertex s that's in Y two and in X. Okay, so we know it's not in Y one. And we were able to choose y one and y two so that the intersection contained the node. If there was a node adjacent to t. So we can assume that s has degree at least four. So the bracketed thing is what I just said. So since s is in Y two, if x intersect y two is greater than or equal to two, then we can do the same thing because this neighbor in Y one that's not in Y two has degree at least four.
00:25:18.830 - 00:25:59.068, Speaker A: So x union y two would be the desired node critical set that's bigger than x. Hence x intersect y two is exactly s. So this intersection of x and y two is exactly this one vertex x. Okay, so I draw the picture yet one more time again. So here's v and x z, t, y one intersect x still has at least two elements, we know that. But x intersect the neighbors of t is exactly the one vertex s. Okay, so that's the size one thing.
00:25:59.068 - 00:26:32.516, Speaker A: And then if there's a node that's a neighbor of t, it's in this intersection over here. So that's, that's the sort of all the setup we have. Apologies if I've lost anyone. As I said, it is actually better just, I think, to read the proof and go through it step by step. But I want to at least show you the feeling of how to do these kind of arguments because they're, they're really nice and really important. Okay, so what we're going to say now. So since the edges from t to x union y one is free.
00:26:32.516 - 00:27:23.256, Speaker A: So what's that? So x union y one to t. So y one contains this vertex that's adjacent to t and this one and x contains the other neighbor. So all three of the edges from t go to x union y one, but x union y one is critical. So when you add a degree three, you get the entire circuit. And so x union y one is all of v minus t. And we also know that x minus s must be contained in y one because it was also true that y one union y two is equal to v minus t. So what that tells us, if you put those, those two facts together, is that v minus y one is exactly this pair of vertices s and t.
00:27:23.256 - 00:28:04.214, Speaker A: So it's exactly s and t if you just take y one away from v. Okay, I'm worrying I'm losing people. But anyway, so as I say, it's, it's. Let me just finish and then maybe I'll stop for questions. So we know that the degree of s is at least four. But this is enough to give us a contradiction and finish the proof. Why? Because we have this lemma that says if you look outside a critical set and you find there's at least two elements, then there exists at least two nodes.
00:28:04.214 - 00:28:42.494, Speaker A: But we've looked outside the critical set y one, we found there's at least two elements, but one of them has degree four. So there's at most one node. So this contradicts one of the counting lemmas we did last time. And so this contradiction deals with the last possibility. So all the possibilities in this part B either gave us directly a bigger critical set, or we found that the option that was possible, that we hadn't dealt with, gave us a contradiction. Okay, so let's, let's look at the statement again. And if you want to ask any questions, please do.
00:28:42.494 - 00:29:34.524, Speaker A: So, we took a circuit with some, some properties, and we particularly had a non admissible node. And then you look outside of that vertex and that and the critical set that blocks admissibility for that vertex. On just one of the particular reductions, we didn't need to look at all three, just at one. So just outside this critical set x, that was node critical for the vertex v. And we found what we said. If there is a non admissible series node with precisely one neighbor in x, or if there is a nonadmissible leaf node, then we can make a bigger node critical set x than x. Okay? And so maybe the technical details of why that's true are not so important, but I like it and did think it's worth at least trying to convince you of why it's true.
00:29:34.524 - 00:30:28.120, Speaker A: Okay? So feel free to ask, as I said, otherwise, I'll move on to show you how it's used in the proof of the theorem. Okay, so as I say that this and the last lecture are all really from just explaining this nice paper, what I've stated as the theorem is actually weaker than what they prove. So I'm stating here as the theorem is, if you take a free connected circuit, it's not k four, because k four is the smallest possible one, so it has at least five vertices. Then you have an admissible node. What they really show is stronger than this because they do exactly what I've done so far. And what I'll do in the proof, get an admissible node. And then they notice that you can make, we basically pick a leaf in a forest.
00:30:28.120 - 00:31:09.988, Speaker A: But forests, as long as you have at least one edge, you also have at least two leaves. So you can easily get two admissible nodes and then they work a bit harder to actually find either three pairwise non adjacent admissible nodes or four non admissible nodes. And they show that these are the best possible. But I'm not so worried about how many you can find. I just want to, to prove the fact there is at least one, because that's what we need for our purposes. Okay, so we already talked last time about wheels and mentioned it briefly this time. So we suppose we don't have our circuit is not a wheel and hence take all the degree free vertices, look at the subgraph induced by them.
00:31:09.988 - 00:31:48.592, Speaker A: We know it's going to be a forest. So let's define script x to be the the set of all node critical sets in our graph g. So we know if a vertex, a node is non admissible, then there is a node critical set. So if there's no node critical sets, then we're done. So we can suppose this set is non empty and hence we can choose a maximal element of the set. Okay, so we choose a biggest node critical set and then we want to find a bigger node critical set and get a constraint contradiction. Okay, so x is node critical.
00:31:48.592 - 00:32:53.394, Speaker A: So there exists some node and a vertex adjacent to that node such that x is critical for that node and the vertex has degree at least four and is not in the v critical set. Since x plus v is critical and the degree of t was at least four, we know that there are at least two vertices outside of x plus v. And hence we can apply a lemma from last time to say that there are at least two nodes outside of v minus x minus v. So now we want to look in this part of the graph v minus x minus v and we want to look at the degree free vertices in that part. So take the subset of all degree free vertices and intersect it with this part outside and call that w. We know that there's at least two nodes in v minus x minus v. So w has at least two vertices.
00:32:53.394 - 00:34:00.284, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to consider the sub graph induced by W. We know that w is at least two, so it has at least two leaf nodes, so vertices of degrees zero or one in GW. But since GW is a proper subset of the subgraph of nodes, the fact that these vertices are leaf nodes in W does not tell us that they're necessarily leaf nodes in G. So it could be that they are adjacent to vertices in the critical set and hence that have degree free and hence their degree in the subgraph of nodes in Gv. Three would be higher than it was in GW. So this is why we're going to use both parts of the previous lemma. So it might be that the leaf we find is a leaf in GW, is a leaf in the whole graph, and we could apply that part, or it might be that it has a neighbor in in the critical set x, and hence it goes up to be, which is a node, and hence it goes up to being a series node when you move from Gw to gv three.
00:34:00.284 - 00:34:25.834, Speaker A: Okay, but anyway, we'll see that in a second. So every vertex in v minus x minus v minus t. Maybe I should draw a picture, I guess. So we have, let's do this. Use this color. We have v, we have our critical set x, we have our neighbor t of degree, at least four, which shows it's a node. And we pick a vertex over here.
00:34:25.834 - 00:35:02.998, Speaker A: So each vertex in v minus x minus v minus t has at most one neighbor in x. Because if it has two neighbors in x, then x union, whatever this thing is, let's call it w temporarily. Then x union w would be a critical set that's bigger than x, contradicting the choice of x as a maximal member of the set of all node critical sets. Because obviously this x union w would still be node critical for v. If it had three neighbors in x, then. Then you would already be have a problem because x union w would be the entire circuit. So that would be bad as well.
00:35:02.998 - 00:35:25.064, Speaker A: So we know that w has at most one neighbor in x, and I'm not sure if I want to use w yet for the letter. So let's get rid of that. Okay? Yeah. W was a bad choice because it already used it here. Whatever that extra one was. I wasn't meaning it to be w necessarily because it was for any vertex. Okay? But in particular for u and w, they cannot be branching nodes.
00:35:25.064 - 00:35:55.944, Speaker A: So remember branching node. If u was a branching node, it would have three neighbors in the forest of nodes. But we know it has at most one neighbor over here and at most one neighbor over here. So that would only give it two neighbors, which would make it into a series node. So if it has none over here, then it has at most one, and it would be a leaf node. So either u and w are going to be a leaf node or a series node. But in both cases we're basically done by the lemma before.
00:35:55.944 - 00:36:53.404, Speaker A: So if u is a leaf node, then that was the only assumption needed in part b of the previous lemma. So we just apply the previous lemma to find a larger node critical set which contradicts the maximality of x and would mean that actually you would have been admissible, and so we'd be done. And if u is a series node, then u is a leaf node in g of w, and it has precisely one neighbor in Y. And hence, because it's a series node, that neighbor is a node. And that means we've satisfied the assumptions in part a. And so we can again apply the previous lemma along with the, the maximality of x to deduce that that we're going to get contradiction, and hence find that you must be admissible. And hence, hence, in all cases, we found an admissible node, and so we've completed the proof of the theorem.
00:36:53.404 - 00:38:01.604, Speaker A: Okay, so I think I should stop for comments or questions for a minute. I could move on to the next part, and I want to say a bit more about circuits. So there is a natural continuation, which might take the rest of the lecture. Or we can stop, we can have questions about what's just, what I've just been presenting, or we can go back to what I said at the start and have more of a bit of a discussion about any questions you have from the mini symposium or from the workshop, or any topics that you'd be interested in hearing more about, or even topics you would like to present. If you want to give a guest lecture on something that's relevant, say so. I'm going to throw the floor open for a few minutes for comments. If there aren't sufficient comments or questions, then I will move to the next thing in one note and talk a bit more about circuits for the last ten minutes.
00:38:25.044 - 00:38:25.788, Speaker B: Hi, Tony.
00:38:25.876 - 00:38:58.724, Speaker C: I wonder if you could detail a little bit what's the. There is a very close connection to these talks to graph theory, but graph theory is such a humongous field. And what part of graph theory is your lectures and mirrors are focused on?
00:39:02.084 - 00:40:12.850, Speaker A: So I'm not sure I'm going to be so well placed to come to Mira's lectures, because I am not attending every single one of them. But for mine, really, we're doing a kind of graph theory that is not so common in sort of, say, structural graph theory or things about graph minors or graph colorings. We're really doing graph theory that more comes up in combinatorial optimization and sort of matriid theory. So what you've seen me present in the lectures is recursive constructions of graphs, which is really the technique or the tool that I like most in rigidity. So we always have these results to sort of say like the Maxwell result that says if you're, you're minimally rigid, then your graph has some count that links the number of edges to the number of vertices. So there's some constant. It's in euclidean D space, it's like this, and you get the corresponding inequality, and this gives you a class of graphs to study.
00:40:12.850 - 00:41:11.694, Speaker A: And what we want to study it by is understanding its properties, but we can't ever forget the rigidity. So my point is, you can't just say it's this area of graph theory, because what I want to understand this class of graphs, yes, and that's a purely graph theoretic problem, but I want to understand it with the purpose of applying it to a geometric problem. And so there are classes of graphs where you come up that people have studied in pure graph theory, but it's often the case that, or if you just study them in a purely graph theoretic sense, you might find, here's a way to understand them. But I've no idea how to apply it in the geometric context. So I don't really want to suggest that the combinatorics of rigidity is some particular sub area of graph theory. It's more its own thing, which uses some graph theory and some geometry at the same time, and you can't really separate the two. I don't know if that's.
00:41:12.474 - 00:41:46.594, Speaker C: Great answer. And I have a similar question about combinatorics and probability, because there are a lot of people who do combinatorics in a very heavy stuff, like to drop names, is Erdos, the hungarian school Yuval Peres, and other names that you don't want me to list further. But you know what I'm asking.
00:41:48.774 - 00:42:40.426, Speaker A: So if you're asking the same question for combinatorics, then I think I can only really say my previous answer still applies, because the area of combinatorics, at least to me, that's relevant to rigidity, is graph theory. So to me, graph theory is a huge part of combinatorics, but things like designs, latin squares, counting problems, enumerative combinatorics, these kind of problems are somehow distinct from mainstream kind of rigidity problems. So they're interesting areas of mathematics, but I'm not sure they're relevant directly to rigidity. Probability is obviously a huge thing. I haven't said anything about probabilistic techniques in rigidity before. There's probably a lot of nice open problems in this area. I tentatively hope to have one lecture on sort of rigidity of random graphs.
00:42:40.426 - 00:43:15.214, Speaker A: So there's various kind of. But just to give you a sort of 1 minute overview of that, there's various kind of problems you could ask. So one natural one is to say, here's a class of graphs, for example, four regular graphs, and you want to pick a four regular graph at random. So you have a bucket with every single four regular graph on n vertices. You want to pick one at random and ask, is it rigid in two dimensional space? So every four regular graph has this. That's just from the handshaking lemma. Whereas for a minimally rigid graph in 2d, you need to have this many edges.
00:43:15.214 - 00:44:09.418, Speaker A: So you have a chance of being rigid because you have three spare edges. You may even be redundantly rigid if you get lucky. And so there's a paper by Bill Jackson and I think both Brigitte and Herman Savatius, but definitely at least one of them, um, where they study this and sort of say, asymptotically, almost surely if you pick a four regular graph at random, then you will be, I want to say, globally rigid even, but, but definitely rigid generically. There's a different kind of problem where you might be interested in, say in, um, percolation problems and physics. And so you might go to an erdos Renyi random graph model. So, so maybe this I'm not very good at, so I, but, so I might get this wrong, but this is sort of the way I sort of picture it. So you have all the vertices, and by all the vertices you might have millions and millions and millions of vertices.
00:44:09.418 - 00:45:11.844, Speaker A: And then you start adding edges with certain probability. And so you want to know, with probability certain probability, I add an edge. So maybe I tried this one and it didn't add that one, it did, etc, etcetera. And at some point there's a phase transition where you, you go from having something that looks a bit like what I've shown here, where there's just the odd isolated edge and there's a sudden sharp transition to having a giant connected component. So you suddenly have, instead of having almost nothing connected at all, you suddenly get, as the probability increases, you suddenly get some big lump in your graph. And so this is a very well studied thing in the, I think the erdos reny random graph model. But there is a paper by, I'm going to be bad and say, Louis Farran and co authors, because I can't remember their names, so apologies to them, where they study the rigidity transition in random graphs, so the emergence of giant rigid components.
00:45:11.844 - 00:45:34.994, Speaker A: So instead of looking for a connected graph, which would be a rigid component, in one dimension, but they're looking for two dimensional rigid component to emerge in this sort of random graph process. So I'm not a probabilistic expert at all, so I'll just mention those two basically references. If you're interested in looking at probability versions of rigidity questions.
00:45:35.294 - 00:45:36.714, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:45:37.094 - 00:45:42.994, Speaker A: Thanks, Alex. Were you going to ask something before?
00:45:45.254 - 00:45:56.984, Speaker B: Well, you mentioned you were going to talk about circuits next, and I had been wondering for a while, just for a list of all known circuits in three reals, something like that.
00:45:57.324 - 00:46:29.018, Speaker A: Oh, in r three. So I was going to. So I've been talking about circuits in two D. I was going to keep going a bit more, but I will do that next time now because I don't like to finish late. So we'll just keep these questions going for as long as you guys are asking them. You're interested in 3d circuits? Okay, so are you interested in three dimensional circuits or three dimensional flexible circuits or should I explain the difference?
00:46:29.066 - 00:46:44.364, Speaker B: Either one. I mean, I just been. The idea popped into my head that even in 2D, just seeing a list of the circuits, either flexible or non flexible, would be something I should work out, but I haven't done it yet.
00:46:44.664 - 00:47:25.824, Speaker A: So in 2D, there are no flexible circuits. Every circuit is rigid. This is a consequence of the polycharinger Leman theorem and testing. So in 2d circuit, as we've been talking about, is a graph that has this condition, that's one of these graphs for all proper subsets x of v with x at least two. And you can test these conditions by the pebble game algorithm that I briefly described in one of the lectures. And so you can efficiently tell if a graph is one of these or isn't. So I think there's not really much interest in listing them all out.
00:47:25.824 - 00:48:08.234, Speaker A: They exist on every number of vertices from four upwards. And as soon as you, even if you get to ten, there's probably many, many non isomorphic ones. But you can test if a graph is one or not easily. In 3D, it's much more interesting. So I tried to say some words about this in the three dimensional rigidity lectures, but the let's. So they split into rigid circuits and flexible circuits, and the flexible circuits, which do not exist in 2D, are one of the major reasons why we don't understand three dimensional rigidity. So understanding and listing these guys would be great, and I'll say something about that in a moment.
00:48:08.234 - 00:49:26.366, Speaker A: These ones, it's, they're rigid circuits, so we know that e equals three, b minus five, and I of x is at most three, x minus six for all proper subsets x of v with x at least three. But there are graphs that satisfy this that are not this. Combinatorics is not enough to characterize rigid circuits, whereas in 2D it was exactly this. It's not exactly this in 3D, but we know all circuits satisfy this. And again, you can give examples for all numbers of vertices and many, many of them will exist. And so again, I don't think it's probably going to be so interesting to, to list them, but listing these ones is interesting. So there's a paper, I'm not sure if it's been published yet or not, but there's a paper very recently by Tibor Jordan and a paper by Giorg, Rassaga, Hakangula, Bill Jackson and myself, again very recently, where we basically understand flexible circuits in D dimensions, but in very special cases.
00:49:26.366 - 00:50:05.022, Speaker A: So in Tibor's paper, he looked at all graphs with at most D plus four vertices, and he showed no flexible circuits exist. Okay, if you fix dimension three, this is only saying seven up to seven vertices. So it's not very much, but d could be anything. So it's still a nice infinite class. And we looked at the same problem, but we pushed it a bit further to d plus six vertices. So again, in dimension three, that's only talking about nine vertices, but here on eight vertices. So on eight vertices in 3D, there is a unique flexible circuit.
00:50:05.022 - 00:50:06.354, Speaker A: So it's this graph.
00:50:09.534 - 00:50:11.158, Speaker B: This is the double banana.
00:50:11.246 - 00:50:37.664, Speaker A: Yeah. And so we saw this in a previous lecture. So this is exactly the only flexible circuit in three dimensional rigidity on, at most, eight vertices. So that will be the first one in your list on nine vertices. I forget how many there are. So you can basically, you can do a one extension on this graph if you do a one extension. But obviously, when you do a one extension, there's probably several options for whether.
00:50:37.664 - 00:51:03.324, Speaker A: So you subdivide some edge, say this one, by a new vertex, but then your additional third and fourth one might go to here and here, or they might go to here and here. If they go to across the two vertex separation here, then that's not a sensible thing. But there's a couple of options. And when. And if you go above.
00:51:05.984 - 00:51:13.790, Speaker B: Tony, when you do this one extension, is it going to be flexible for the exact same reason that, that it rotates about those two vertices?
00:51:13.982 - 00:51:23.046, Speaker A: Yeah, because I've picked the two, the extra neighbors for these two edges to be on this sort of side of the thing. Yes. Yes. So it'd be exactly the same reason.
00:51:23.150 - 00:51:26.034, Speaker B: Are there any examples where it's not a hinge like that?
00:51:26.734 - 00:52:09.012, Speaker A: So on d up to d plus six. No, so on d plus six most D plus six vertices. Every flexible circuit in any dimension fails to be deconnected, so there's always the at least at most d minus one vertices that you can rotate around. So they always have that above D plus six vertices you get much more complicated flexible circuits. So in three d. The smallest reconnected flexible circuit that I. That I know of, and I think probably this is provably probably provable, but I'm not sure anyone's ever tried to write down a specific proof for it.
00:52:09.012 - 00:52:51.054, Speaker A: But the smallest flexible circuit that is free connected in 3D that I'm aware of, that's definitely a true statement, is this graph. So I'm using a different color because I just want these edges to be clear. But you have this ring of k four s and then you add and you've joined it to one. So it's really a load of k five s. The k, all the k four, red k force plus the blue join together and you can get rid of some of the shared edges. And so this is a flexible circuit on 13 vertices.
00:52:52.274 - 00:52:57.766, Speaker B: Interesting. And what it's. I'm sure it's hard to picture. What is the flexibility? What does it look like?
00:52:57.950 - 00:53:20.726, Speaker A: Oh, I. I don't think I've tried to picture it, so I could probably do that. If you think of it as you think of it as these k five s, what's the. So you think of it as like a body hinge framework, so that the k five s are sort of hinged together. And if you think about it carefully for a few minutes, I'm sure you'll be able to. Or maybe you can do a nice computation quicker than you. Than that.
00:53:20.830 - 00:53:28.934, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, just very dumbly compute it. But what? Just to make sure I know the graph, these green dotted edges. Those are not edges.
00:53:29.314 - 00:53:43.574, Speaker A: Correct. They are not there. Yes. Okay, so this blue vertex is adjacent to all the things around the outside and exactly one of the four inner vertices, so that it doesn't matter which one, it would all be the same.
00:53:44.994 - 00:53:48.266, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, that was a really good answer to my question. Thank you.
00:53:48.450 - 00:54:10.314, Speaker A: So just to, just to finish the answer, if you go above dimension three, then you also get the flexible circuits which are KD plus 2D plus two. So this is a, this is not just reconnected, but can be quite highly connected. You can get quite highly connected by examples in higher dimensions.
00:54:10.654 - 00:54:14.798, Speaker B: Wait, you just wrote, do you mean bipartite or what is this graph?
00:54:14.886 - 00:54:22.078, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. I don't mean the k there. I do mean exactly the complete bipartite graph. Kd plus two, comma, d plus two.
00:54:22.246 - 00:54:23.438, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:54:23.606 - 00:54:36.394, Speaker A: So in three, d, k five, five is a circuit, but it's a rigid circuit. It. Whereas k 66 and 77, et cetera, in relevant dimensions are all flexible circuits.
00:54:39.294 - 00:54:46.254, Speaker D: Wouldn't the motion in that k five example have to be like some weird wiggling at those, those hinges?
00:54:47.114 - 00:54:55.466, Speaker A: Yes, the k five s joined together at the hinges. I haven't, to be honest, I just haven't thought about it. But it will be wiggling at the hinges. Yes.
00:54:55.530 - 00:54:56.530, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay.
00:54:56.682 - 00:55:29.300, Speaker A: Because I think this example was found by thinking about body hinge. This example was found, as far as I understand, by tay in a paper in the eighties. And I think he was thinking about body hinge frameworks. And it came from that. You look at the body hinge combinatorics and you can find this sort of picture. Okay, so go on.
00:55:29.412 - 00:55:51.244, Speaker D: Sorry, I just had a question. So you said for, was it d less than or equal to the problem where. What was it with this example? It was the smallest. Yeah. Maybe further up the problem with the double. Yeah. That inequality right there.
00:55:51.244 - 00:56:17.004, Speaker D: I think it is what it was. Is there like any hope of maybe classifying 3D rigid graphs for like this? Because what was the question that Alex asked? I forget exactly what it was. There's, when there's a graph in 3D that has a flex that isn't, I guess, around a cut, that's what it was.
00:56:17.124 - 00:57:08.962, Speaker A: Perhaps this paper, we studied flexible circuits when the number of vertices was close to the dimension. And with this inequality, and for all such graphs, we do give a Leman theorem. And so it's basically what you're thinking and what Alex was thinking, that what we show is all the flexible circuits have a two vertex separation like this. And so the, the Laman type theorem is basically free connected plus the, the count. But there's a small exception because I think if you're on exactly D plus six vertices, you can have a flexible circuit with two degrees of freedom rather than one if the dimension is at least four. So you have to say you don't contain this, this particular graph as a subgraph, but you can read that precise statement in the paper. But it's roughly what you're thinking.
00:57:08.962 - 00:57:13.654, Speaker A: Free connected is enough of an extra condition because the number of vertices is small.
00:57:13.954 - 00:57:15.282, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, so then the.
00:57:15.338 - 00:57:29.026, Speaker A: That's clearly not true. If you go just to. What's so what did I say? D plus six. So three plus six is nine. So it's not so far to get to examples where it's definitely not true, but maybe up to twelve. In 3D it is true, yeah.
00:57:29.090 - 00:57:40.514, Speaker D: So then. So I guess that that simpler obstacle is well understood. But the harder obstacle is when that isn't sufficient, when there's some other weird stuff going on.
00:57:40.934 - 00:58:19.568, Speaker A: Yes, so what? The condition is to rule out something like this or in higher dimensions. So in dimension four then, examples like this make me really worried about. There must be horrendously complicated flexible circuits, but in three d. The one. The one. All the ones we found on this number of vertices were quite nice. And Georg has continued and has some computations for fixed dimensions, small dimensions d, where you push D plus six to D plus 7d plus eight, etcetera and so on small vertices above our range.
00:58:19.568 - 00:58:30.994, Speaker A: It still seems to be true that it's generally nice things. Or maybe the odd exception like this. This one that's already known doesn't seem to be much surprising yet.
00:58:31.894 - 00:58:32.534, Speaker D: Okay, thanks.
