00:00:02.080 - 00:00:04.606, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:00:04.670 - 00:00:06.694, Speaker B: I think it's going on.
00:00:06.854 - 00:00:07.222, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:07.238 - 00:00:45.494, Speaker B: So I guess good afternoon for those that are in Toronto, or good morning actually for those that are in Toronto. Good morning for those are in here. So I'm going to talk about, this is going to be the first lecture about the course of introduction. Well, resolution, similar techniques of resolution of similarities in coS analytic classes. And today I'm going to do an introduction. So the idea is to first do an overview about what is the goals of the course, and a very rough overview talking about which are the techniques that we're going to see and why they were chosen. And then I'm going to talk about the definition of quadrant analytic classes that we're going to use.
00:00:45.494 - 00:01:17.590, Speaker B: This is kind of the plan for today. As soon as I talk about which techniques we're going to see, then I'm going to be a little bit more clear about how I plan to organize the course in terms of hours. So I would like to start with a rough definition or a rough notion of what resolution of similarity is in its usual context, that is, in the algebraic case. Okay, so let's just consider a polynomial. Let f of x be a polynomial.
00:01:17.622 - 00:01:19.998, Speaker A: Let'S say in r of x.
00:01:20.086 - 00:01:41.054, Speaker B: And here we are using the multi index notation. And I'm going to use this very often, x is equal to x one. So polynomial, I'm going to even write so roughly, and this is very rough. A resolution of singularity.
00:01:51.254 - 00:01:53.846, Speaker A: Of f is.
00:01:53.870 - 00:02:20.294, Speaker B: A proper irrational map. So if you do not know what b rational is, it doesn't like. There are some notions from algebraic geometry that we are going to use, but we're not going to use many. Particularly, we're not going to even use the rational course. It's just to start. It's just good for the category of algebraic in the algebraic case and proper we're going to see later on.
00:02:24.234 - 00:02:24.546, Speaker A: To.
00:02:24.570 - 00:02:40.254, Speaker B: Our end, such that m is a smooth variety. And the pullback.
00:02:45.014 - 00:02:45.726, Speaker A: Which we're going to.
00:02:45.750 - 00:02:49.394, Speaker B: Call, let me use here.
00:02:52.054 - 00:02:52.750, Speaker A: P star.
00:02:52.822 - 00:03:00.154, Speaker B: Of f, which is in this case, it's just the composition of f with this PI is everywhere.
00:03:05.134 - 00:03:06.154, Speaker A: Monomial.
00:03:08.694 - 00:03:14.020, Speaker B: That is a monomial is the goal that we are having here. That is, at every point that we.
00:03:14.052 - 00:03:17.468, Speaker A: Consider an m, they're going to exist.
00:03:17.516 - 00:03:31.224, Speaker B: A local feeding of coordinates, let's say u equals to u one un.
00:03:34.844 - 00:03:35.204, Speaker A: Such.
00:03:35.244 - 00:03:42.618, Speaker B: That as those coordinates, we can write f composite with PI over u, where we recall that u is a local.
00:03:42.666 - 00:03:46.242, Speaker A: Coordinate system, that a is going to.
00:03:46.258 - 00:04:39.184, Speaker B: Be by u two transform alpha here, which really means is the multi index notation u one alpha one product until un alpha n, where this alpha is some power here with the multi index given by n, which is the dimension of the variety that we started with the rn, the dimension of the unknown space. And we started so very roughly, this is what is going to be a resolution of singularity for us. Kind of the goal here is going to be to replace the polynomials with quasi analytic classes as we're going to see. But before looking at this, let's just, I just want to talk a little bit about the history of resolution of similarities and say a couple of words about it. To do so, let's just look at an example of how this can look.
00:04:39.684 - 00:04:43.036, Speaker A: So let's say in our tree, so.
00:04:43.060 - 00:05:16.128, Speaker B: That we make these connections. Let's say that we are taking the function f one, f two f three given by t one. So one thing that you might have noticed is that there is, when we are talking about this revolution of similarities of f, we're really talking about, we're singling out the zero level set of f. This is really the level set we are interested in. So in this case, the zero level.
00:05:16.176 - 00:05:21.432, Speaker A: Set is an algebraic set, which is.
00:05:21.448 - 00:06:10.806, Speaker B: A colon here, x given by f equal to zero. Now, a resolution of singularities of the set is going to be just an application. So actually the application that we're going to use, which is going to be very simple, is going to be what we call a blowing up, where we're going to replace the point essentially by a projected space. So by a two dimensional projected space in this case, which is the space of all of the directions that we have. So of course they have the infinity. But the idea is that if you replace the point by the projector space and you are separating all of the possible directions, and we're going to get a cone, which is going to be this move. So we have the variety m.
00:06:10.806 - 00:06:44.550, Speaker B: We have our cone here, still the given by the pullback of this f. And now we have some sort of parameterization of the cone by the cylinder. Now in coordinates duplication that we're doing here, it also has some nice coordinates. So of course we're not looking at the infinity of the projected space, but just in this chart of the projected space, we have nice looking coordinates of the form p of u one u two, u three, defined over the entire r three here is going to just be given by u one times u.
00:06:44.582 - 00:06:54.038, Speaker A: Three, u two times u three and u three, which implies that f composed.
00:06:54.086 - 00:07:14.924, Speaker B: With PI of u is given by, if we look at here u three to the power two times one. Oops, not one times u one squared plus u two squared minus one. And this term here, for every point.
00:07:15.004 - 00:07:18.636, Speaker A: A, it's either going to be a unit.
00:07:18.700 - 00:07:32.664, Speaker B: So either we're going to have a point a which does not belong to the zero set of f to the transform of it, and then this is a unit. We are, we are good. We can, we can make a change of coordinates here to absorb it into the u three to the two, or.
00:07:38.144 - 00:07:42.404, Speaker A: That is one.
00:07:45.264 - 00:08:44.340, Speaker B: Point where f composed with PI of a is equal to zero. Then in this case we may change the coordinates. Here we may note that the gradient of this function is always non zero over the set x tilde. And therefore by the implicit function theorem, we can find a way to rewrite it locally, just as a monomial like this. So in other words, by the implicit function theorem, there exists a coordinate system, u two, the one u two to.
00:08:44.372 - 00:08:49.784, Speaker A: Two, u two to the three such that.
00:08:51.564 - 00:08:58.704, Speaker B: F composed with phi u tilde is simply going to be given by the u tilde three to the square.
00:08:58.864 - 00:09:02.712, Speaker A: Times u tilde one, where does u.
00:09:02.728 - 00:09:26.574, Speaker B: To the one is equal to u one square. Why u two square minus one? So, having a monomialization of the function, as we talked, is very linked to having a parameterization of the set given by f of f equals to zero.
00:09:27.034 - 00:09:30.410, Speaker A: Okay, so this is some sort of.
00:09:30.442 - 00:09:33.694, Speaker B: Remark here that I want to make. In the algebraic case.
00:09:42.394 - 00:09:42.962, Speaker A: There is a.
00:09:42.978 - 00:09:53.784, Speaker B: Good relation where good is not defined, but it can be between sets.
00:09:55.484 - 00:09:55.820, Speaker A: And.
00:09:55.852 - 00:11:30.030, Speaker B: Functions, or better ideals of functions. And in the history of resolutional singularities of the algebraic case, we normally ask much more about dysmorphism. But the overarching kind of idea here, let's say the overarching idea or goal is to find a good parameterization by good precise, the good parameterization of x, the algebraic set. This is kind of a very rough idea of where it's coming from. And this gives us also like a notion about the history that if we're working with something like this, which is a thing where of course there's interest from this for a long time. And if we look at this overarching idea, maybe the first result about this kind of operation is the Newton Poiseau theorem, classical Newton Poiseau theorem. And then in a more modern term developed, we have resolution results about resolution of singularities.
00:11:30.030 - 00:11:41.214, Speaker B: For the case where the set is equal to two, the dimension of the set is equal to two. So for surfaces. So here there's a lot of different notions of resolution singularities coming from the 19th century.
00:11:41.254 - 00:11:41.834, Speaker A: Here.
00:11:45.894 - 00:12:48.342, Speaker B: Later on, for the case of dimension X equals to three, we have the result of Zariski. And here already, this is 1944, we already have the kind of result, the kind of technique that we're going to talk about converging to some sort of over, like a statement of the result that we are going to use. But I just want to remark that once it comes from the dimension two, it was not the case. There was not an idea of what is the statement that the best kind of statement we're going to use. This is kind of being developed through time and being put into test through applications. So already here for Zariski, you appeared in kind of a modern version of what resolution of stimuli is going to mean if we see algebraic geometry. A local resolution is also proved by Darisky before, but it was always expected that a global result, general result for algebraic in algebraic case would be true.
00:12:48.342 - 00:12:50.274, Speaker B: And this is the result of ironwork.
00:12:50.974 - 00:12:51.754, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:12:56.014 - 00:13:15.794, Speaker B: Dimension of x equals to n. The existence of resolution of singularity is going to be proved in 1964, this rough result, but actually a much more precise result about it. Now, the goal here.
00:13:19.654 - 00:13:24.370, Speaker A: Are techniques of.
00:13:24.402 - 00:14:30.494, Speaker B: Resolution in quadrant requests, which I'm going to call q's. So this includes, and we're going to see in a moment, a little bit better, this, this is going to include, for example, the real or complex analytic, real analytic functions, analytic class, complex analytics. This also includes algebraic functions, but more interesting and maybe more to the taste of the program, includes, for example, classes of symmetry, definable functions in a non minimal polynomial, bounded.
00:14:36.074 - 00:14:36.814, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:37.554 - 00:15:39.514, Speaker B: And sometimes we are taking some class of function now to describe sometimes some sets that we are interested in, and we want to develop a theory, an algebraic theory for it. And since we have a result that has been quite intertwined with the development of algebraic geometry, we'd like to see if it can hold for a more general setting. And the kind of setting that we're going to look at are this quadrantic classes, which include all of this example here and more. So, let me briefly talk now about what are the techniques that have been chosen. So we're going to talk in terms of technique. There's going to be basically three of them. The first one is going to be resolution of singularities of ideal sheets.
00:15:39.514 - 00:16:24.014, Speaker B: And if we want to think about this, this is kind of the best possible result that we can translate from the algebraic case to the quasi analytic. Like, this is a global result, and it will have an extra hypothesis on it. On the ideal sheath which in the algebraic and complex analytic case are really no hypothesis at all. But in the case of quasi analytic or even real analytic, it is actually in hypotheses that have to be considered. Then we're going to see local resolution of singularities. I'm going to come back about one and two in a minute. And third.
00:16:25.894 - 00:16:26.994, Speaker A: Monomialization.
00:16:31.094 - 00:16:32.394, Speaker B: Of morphs.
00:16:34.494 - 00:16:35.006, Speaker A: Which we.
00:16:35.030 - 00:17:11.132, Speaker B: Might think of in the same way that we just talked about resolution of a function. It's really looking at the zero locus, the zero set. Now, when we talk about amorphous, we want to look at all of the possible level sets. And this game becomes very interesting when the target has dimension bigger than one. So it's not just a function going to r like the polynomial in the beginning, but really something amorphous that goes from a variety of some dimension m to some variety of dimension n frame with n bigger than one. Okay, so the comments here is that, well, one and two. So just some historical comments.
00:17:11.132 - 00:17:36.664, Speaker B: First of all, were proved first by Jersey Nealman 1997. So they are already known from 20 years. And I cannot offer that there is a proof by valence here.
00:17:44.204 - 00:17:45.792, Speaker A: Of 2003.
00:17:45.988 - 00:18:08.164, Speaker B: Which led to important applications, especially in the beginning of the two thousands right away. Three is now a new result. So it's mine and just accepted. So I'm going to put here 2021, the year that was accepted.
00:18:09.544 - 00:18:09.952, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:10.008 - 00:18:32.524, Speaker B: I'm going to talk about this as application. So just citing here the results, but we're also going to talk about applications. So let me put them here. We're going to talk about uniformization.
00:18:37.684 - 00:18:38.020, Speaker A: Of.
00:18:38.052 - 00:18:41.864, Speaker B: Soup called the analytic.
00:18:47.444 - 00:18:48.224, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:18:50.084 - 00:19:40.804, Speaker B: I'm going to briefly talk about Holoni particle mucous theorem for the analog specialist, which is an important theorem that says that if you take, we're going to talk more about it later on. So I'm just saying if you know what it is, you know that it's important if you don't know what it is. I'm going to be clear later on in the course. And third, partial results and solutions of Q equations. So here. So maybe I can say that this is the theorem from 2003 here. It's going to be works of.
00:19:42.704 - 00:19:43.288, Speaker A: Marin.
00:19:43.336 - 00:19:44.444, Speaker B: Deborzky.
00:19:47.224 - 00:19:48.164, Speaker A: And add.
00:19:52.064 - 00:21:12.486, Speaker B: 2017. And fourth, we're going to talk about reclusion, which go back to a result of theory from 2015 and also comes from our paper. So it's going to be an application on monomization. So a couple of words like one and two actually imply the first one here, the I one, and actually two will imply the number two here, together with the five year continuum, actually the two of the, here with the five year continent, lemma three, we're going to actually use the first, the actual resolution similarities of ideal sheets. A local result is not going to be enough. And here I want just to make a little statement, right, we're going to look at solutions of equations. So we're going to look at algebraic problems, kind of the idea here is that when information of super cause analytic sets and the whole specific Wilkins theorem, they are geometrical results.
00:21:12.486 - 00:22:09.794, Speaker B: So if you have a geometrical kind of result, then the heuristic is that a local result is probably going to be enough. But if you have an algebraic kind of result, if you have a function theory kind of result, then you might want to use, you might need to use actually resolutions which are global. Part of the difficulty is that not every time you're going to be able to use these global results, there's going to be a lot of algebraic questions which we do not know how to answer. We're in a lack of techniques in between the two and we need to add new arguments. The word here about recognization of subunit cause analytic sets, it's going to be an application of organization of morphisms. And I want to make a remark that this list of techniques, of techniques is larger. So in their paper, Holland Japanese.
00:22:11.744 - 00:22:12.032, Speaker A: What.
00:22:12.048 - 00:22:43.278, Speaker B: I'm going to call your vertical monolization, which is exactly what you need in order to improve the reconciliation of some quadrant analytic sets. I'm calling them vertical monorization. They call in their paper monolization. I'm taking the word in monomerization of Morpheus from algebraic geometry. So I decided to keep it like that and I'm calling the result vertical monomerization. There are other results you can think of, at least from this heuristic that I just gave. If we're not really interested in the morphe itself is in class.
00:22:43.278 - 00:22:45.154, Speaker B: You can think about triangulations.
00:22:49.694 - 00:22:50.434, Speaker A: Also.
00:22:52.134 - 00:23:28.756, Speaker B: Cosmetic sets. You can also think about CR parameterizations if you want something about local results, or even just out the composition. They all can be to some extent thought about it as resolution of similarity. There isn't that overarching idea of finding good parameterization for some kind of problem. And this is kind of the theme of resolution of similarities. Now, instead of just in algebraic geometry, where you had one clear result, that was the development for centuries, and we tested them in applications. And this was the good result that the good statement that we had in quasi analytic classes, it's not that clear.
00:23:28.756 - 00:24:18.504, Speaker B: We have several results that will have different applications for different conflicts, and then they can be important in different situations. So it's not yet clear what is the convergent result. But I would like to claim that these three I feel like, and I'm going to try to argue that they are quite important. Well, the first two I've already proved with time, and the third one is new, and I do believe that it's going to have application and I want to talk about it. So the plan is that I'm going to talk about the first two for at least 6 hours, for at least from five to 6 hours. I'm going to give not a proof of the first, but a proof of the second. And then I'm going to spend 5 hours, maybe in the second one, and there's 1 hour there to play because I'm sure I'm going to be late in one of the sections.
00:24:18.504 - 00:25:02.314, Speaker B: This is the plan of the course. Now, just before finishing this introduction and starting to define things that we're going to use later on, that is defining what a quasi normal class is precisely. I just want to make a comment about why local result in this category. So why do we need to consider local results? And here, like I want to fix, fix the category, but let's say a class of function, which I'm going to actually find in a bit.
00:25:05.374 - 00:25:06.606, Speaker A: But I really want to think of.
00:25:06.630 - 00:25:39.554, Speaker B: C as either algebraic over a field of characteristics, zero, or real analytic or complex analytic, like the usual ones from algebra, geometry, one of them. And then I said that there is a good relation, right? I said that there is a good relation between sets and function fields. So we say that x is a c set. If for every point a in x there exists a neighborhood.
00:25:41.654 - 00:25:45.274, Speaker A: Of a such that.
00:25:47.534 - 00:26:35.434, Speaker B: X into u is just given by some functions there f one alpha, let's say x fd of x equals to zero, where fi are functions on this algebraic function defined, or real analytics, or complex analytic functions defined over an entire neighborhood. And then we can define the notion of space by c space. If first of all, x is a.
00:26:36.454 - 00:26:37.434, Speaker A: C set.
00:26:39.134 - 00:27:20.414, Speaker B: No, x, which we're going to talk later on, is a function field, is a sheet for functions. But it cannot be any shift of functions. You have to satisfy extra properties in order for it to be actually like it cannot just be an algebraic object. It has to be linked to the set itself. So it has to have some sort of coherence between it and coherent is actually something that is defined in algebraic joint. So it actually means something. Not going to recall the definition of what it is, but it's really saying that with this hypothesis, then this field of functions here really describe the set f.
00:27:20.414 - 00:28:14.354, Speaker B: Just as you take all of the functions that are equal to zero or the quotient of it. It's going to describe our set x in a good way. Okay, so we have sets and spaces. Now we have some sort of from set to CSAT exists ox such that Xox is a C space and X is set p of proper projection p of C.
00:28:16.174 - 00:28:16.670, Speaker A: Whoops.
00:28:16.702 - 00:29:08.262, Speaker B: P of X is a P set. In the algebraic case, this is true, and this is not completely true, but you have constructive, constructable sets. So I'm going to say that it's also true. We all know that there's going to be the same algebra, semi algebraic. But I'm going to essentially say that this kind here is true for complex analytic. You do also have a notion. If you have a complex analytical set, then you are going to find some structure, some analytic space is going to be a c space is going to be coherent.
00:29:08.262 - 00:29:19.474, Speaker B: So this is coming from Oclus theorem. And you do have this too, in terms of the Rehmert proper mapping theorem.
00:29:24.994 - 00:29:28.626, Speaker A: Now, what happens in real analytic is.
00:29:28.650 - 00:30:11.036, Speaker B: That already this first passage is not going to be true. So here's already not true. You're going to have examples of real analytic sets that admit no structure of real spaces, real analytic spaces. So there's already going to be a difference between working with real analytic sets and working with real analytic spaces. And here projections are also known. You have all the super analytics. So because of this, the first result is going to ask this hypothesis of coherence, actually something weaker, which we're going to talk in the next lecture, because we need it to be a good algebraic structure.
00:30:11.036 - 00:31:00.124, Speaker B: Well, the second result is going to be valid for any analytic space and any, sorry, quasi analytic set. Not space set, any analytic set, real analytics set, or any real analytic space set. So this is to motivate why we're going to use uvloco. So in the rest of. Oops. So in the rest of the, of the lecture today, I just want to talk about the class of functions that we're going to talk that we're going to see and give the definitions and everything to set up things for the next course where we're going to see the results about resolution of similarities. So part two for the native classes.
00:31:00.124 - 00:31:09.454, Speaker B: So we'll start by defining what is the, what is the class for us here? So class.
00:31:11.154 - 00:31:15.018, Speaker A: C, which is going to.
00:31:15.026 - 00:32:00.382, Speaker B: Be of same infinity function. So I'm not saying it here, but a class will always be of infinity. So it's the association to each, to every open set you over n. So I'm going to do it only for the real case of a super algebra of functions, of the infinity functions, such that first thing we wanted to contain all the restrictive polynomials.
00:32:00.398 - 00:32:03.944, Speaker A: So Clu, sorry.
00:32:10.204 - 00:32:41.524, Speaker B: The polynomials restricted to u are contained in Clu. It's going to be called by compositions, mappings. There is maps c. Let's just do it from.
00:32:43.384 - 00:32:48.724, Speaker A: This stage u in rn.
00:32:49.544 - 00:32:53.054, Speaker B: To some p in our mix.
00:32:55.784 - 00:32:56.804, Speaker A: Such that.
00:32:58.504 - 00:33:05.924, Speaker B: All entries of phi are in c.
00:33:09.344 - 00:33:09.680, Speaker A: Right?
00:33:09.712 - 00:33:21.614, Speaker B: So if you compose it with a projection, here are m to r for every one of the projections, and every one of them is going to be in c. And finally, and the one that, then I'm going to talk to.
00:33:21.694 - 00:33:23.982, Speaker A: The list we're going to talk a.
00:33:23.998 - 00:33:36.750, Speaker B: Little bit later on, is that we're going to ask because we want to do some algebra geometry with it, that it determines, well, not just because of the, just a very useful thing to.
00:33:36.782 - 00:33:40.794, Speaker A: Have determines a sheet of local.
00:33:43.694 - 00:34:23.184, Speaker B: Algebra. So the condition about being a chief is something that I'm going to come a little bit back later in an example to see what is the kind of situation that would not be a chief. But in general, most of the things that we're going to see are going to satisfy this property kind of immediately. And now that we talked about what is a class, I can talk what is going to be a quasi nondominantly class.
00:34:23.684 - 00:34:24.812, Speaker A: So these are kind of going to.
00:34:24.828 - 00:35:23.424, Speaker B: Be the minimal definitions that we want to have. We're talking to this subiability function. So a class, then I'm also going to write this is quas analytic if it satisfies three axioms. The first one is going to be, that is going to be closed by division by coordinates. That is, if we take a function there. So let's say that we take f, which belongs to, belongs to q of u, contain our n such that.
00:35:25.124 - 00:35:25.700, Speaker A: F.
00:35:25.812 - 00:35:28.024, Speaker B: Of x is equal to x, one.
00:35:28.824 - 00:35:35.284, Speaker A: Times g of x. G has the infinity function mu.
00:35:36.424 - 00:35:38.964, Speaker B: Then v is actually in the class.
00:35:40.584 - 00:35:43.928, Speaker A: Of u in the same way of.
00:35:43.976 - 00:36:44.900, Speaker B: This, this kind of satisfy, if it is divisible by a monomial by a coordinate, then the devised function is also in the class. We can, we can also state it in a simple way that c is closed by the inverse function theorem. Recall that if you take a mapping of infinity mapping with jacobian determinant, which is non zero, which is not degenerated, then it admits an inverse which is infinity. And for example, for the analytic case, if the function was analytic, then the inverse is also analytic. So here we are asking the same if the function of the morpheus is quasi analytic, we want the inverse to also be in the same class, quasanalytic in the same class, and third, the quasi negativity. So if I'm going to. You mean q is closed by an inverse function? Oh yes.
00:36:44.900 - 00:37:39.224, Speaker B: Thanks, thanks. And the last one is called an authenticity. So for all you open and complex and connected, if there exists a and hopes we don't actually need a quantifier, if I take view open connection and a appoint new, then if we take the taser at a, which goes from all the quasi analytical functions over u and goes to the formal power scene from a power series.
00:37:41.384 - 00:37:41.920, Speaker A: At a.
00:37:41.952 - 00:38:25.294, Speaker B: So for every a we associate the Taylor expansion at a, which I'm just going to call with a little hat, the Taylor expansion at a is injective. In particular, if it contains the polynomial, the function constant equal to zero belongs there. So immediately we have as a remarkable that if it's a quad analytic class, then it doesn't contain flat functions. This quad analytic nf.
00:38:28.034 - 00:38:31.454, Speaker A: Is such that.
00:38:34.944 - 00:39:47.282, Speaker B: Zero, then f is constant equal to zero, at least in the same well, u connect the remark that u connect. So besides, we can look here and we see that, well, analytic functions, real analytics functions, every complex analytic, if we have done this with Rcn instead of rn, they're both going to be quasi analytics. So as immediate examples of this, just as we talked before, so Rio analytic algebraic functions. So algebraic functions over characteristic view over computer characteristic zero, they will satisfy all of these properties like closed by division by coordinates. Certainly composition also determines a shape contains the polynomials. They are the algebraics. They are going to satisfy the Taylor expansion, but they do not satisfy the inverse function theorem, at least in the usual Zaryvsky topology.
00:39:47.282 - 00:39:59.966, Speaker B: So here we have to change the topology in the EtaO topology we can do, and more general.
00:40:00.030 - 00:40:01.074, Speaker A: So let me see.
00:40:03.174 - 00:40:14.074, Speaker B: Other two other examples that we have, and that we're going to talk from time to time, are the dangerous quasi analytic classes.
00:40:30.394 - 00:40:30.706, Speaker A: That.
00:40:30.730 - 00:40:41.966, Speaker B: Is, the class of same finity functions class I'm going to define, which is.
00:40:41.990 - 00:40:45.794, Speaker A: Defined in the following a let m.
00:40:54.534 - 00:41:13.730, Speaker B: A sequence of real numbers of positive real numbers. We're going to say that f belongs.
00:41:13.922 - 00:41:21.134, Speaker A: To the class cm of u. If f.
00:41:23.474 - 00:41:42.634, Speaker B: Is the same thing. If one value and for all compact k new, there exists a and b.
00:41:43.134 - 00:41:44.034, Speaker A: Positive.
00:41:45.894 - 00:41:49.754, Speaker B: Such that any partial derivative.
00:41:52.174 - 00:41:57.366, Speaker A: Of f at a point a is going.
00:41:57.390 - 00:42:01.074, Speaker B: To be bounded bionic flow here.
00:42:05.414 - 00:42:05.726, Speaker A: For.
00:42:05.750 - 00:42:41.574, Speaker B: A while in this compact set. So if we just write like this, you're going to recover the usual definition of the usual one of the characterization, analytic characterizations of being analytic. So here the difference is that we add this weight function in alpha here, which are the weights that we're allowed. So it's some sort of control. So it's all of this infinity function with some sort of controlled derivatives and the, yes, so factorial alpha is the product of the factorials of the alpha I or is the factorial of the.
00:42:42.114 - 00:42:43.534, Speaker A: Sum of the alpha I?
00:42:43.954 - 00:43:39.114, Speaker B: Yes, sorry. So is it the product? Yeah, and the remark here is that. So I'm not going to enter in detail, but under extra assumptions on the sequence n c n, which we might write just k is a quasinality class. And then the last example of something that we're going to follow is the class that we talked about and which I'm not, again, for the examples, I'm going to allow myself to be vague and I'm going to explain it just after stating the example. So let us.
00:43:41.394 - 00:43:47.374, Speaker A: Bnom.
00:43:57.034 - 00:43:58.974, Speaker B: Then we take the class q of s.
00:44:01.274 - 00:44:02.850, Speaker A: Class of.
00:44:02.882 - 00:44:24.474, Speaker B: Sine finity locally as definable functions, is quasi analytic. This all from a result of Chris Miller from 1995.
00:44:25.294 - 00:44:26.034, Speaker A: So.
00:44:28.774 - 00:45:46.224, Speaker B: The point that I want to make about this class, these four examples, but these two in particular that we're getting here because I classes and the case that is coming from polynomial or minimum wavelength structures, is that they are particularly interesting for us because from time to time we can test results via these two examples. But during the course, I'm not going to do that in any explicit way. I'm just stating that the result, and it's common to either work with one or the other class of functions to test possible results. In the case of the Azure Karman classes, you have a lot of real complex, sorry, not real, but complex analytic tools to work, extra complex analytic tools to work with these classes. We have extension c, one extension debar extension, and in the case of a minimum boundary structure, you have other set of techniques coming from logic and model theory and geometrical techniques coming from just working from a new structure that we can use. So we can pose general problems for quantity classes. And later on try to answer it either with one set of examples or the others.
00:45:46.224 - 00:47:45.490, Speaker B: It's really good to test out like this. So I wanted to just state them, but I'm actually not going to use them in any precise, like it's not going to be actually necessary to know them in detail through the course. So that's why I'm just giving you a vague idea of where they're coming from and if they're motivating for you. And now, the last part in the last five minutes, I just want to say a couple of words about properties of positive classes. So, a couple of properties that are going to be through is that it is closed by the inverse function theorem. And this is going to be equivalent just by following the same proof of calculus closure under the implicit function theorem in a precise way, because I wrote my note when is closed on the implicit function theorem and by partial differentiation, maybe to see just one little proof in this lesson. Five minutes.
00:47:45.490 - 00:47:52.214, Speaker B: Like, how do we prove that it's going to be closed by differentiation? Well, it's kind of simple. We take a consider.
00:47:55.634 - 00:48:13.570, Speaker A: A function f, which is in k of ui, is contained in r n plus one with.
00:48:13.602 - 00:48:45.944, Speaker B: Coordinated xy given by x one x n y. And the idea is just to show that partial derivative with respect to y of f also belongs to this class. So the first thing that we're going to remember is that we can define another quadric function here, which is just.
00:48:46.484 - 00:48:47.224, Speaker A: Consider.
00:48:50.484 - 00:50:07.234, Speaker B: The function given by v of x y z, and it's going to correspond to f of x y plus z minus f of x y. So this, just by using the it's closed by composition. So this is a quadrillic function. Now, since this is a, and moreover, it's a quadrillic function. And moreover, and v of xy zero is equal to zero. So with the same finity function function, we may write, since it's zero along all of the all of z equals to zero, we may write that g is equal to z times another function x y z. Since q is closed by division by monomial, one of q h actually belongs to the class itself.
00:50:07.234 - 00:51:02.794, Speaker B: And now we just have to note that the partial derivation of y of x y is simply going to be given by h of x y zero, which belongs to q. So you're going to get that it belongs to q. And with that, I'm going to finish today presentation. So in the next lecture we're going to talk about a property that does not work in quadrant classes, which is the viceroy's preparation property. And then I'm going to state the global results of resolution of singularities and the local results. And the plan is also took over since it's a 2 hours lecture to also cover uniformization of quad analytics act. So I'll finish, my dear.
