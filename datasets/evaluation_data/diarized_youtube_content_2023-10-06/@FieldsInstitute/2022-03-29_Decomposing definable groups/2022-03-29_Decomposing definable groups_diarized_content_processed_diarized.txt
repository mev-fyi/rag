00:00:01.160 - 00:00:12.310, Speaker A: Good morning. Today's speaker is Antelis Leterio and he will tell us about decomposing groups, correct?
00:00:12.382 - 00:00:13.034, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:14.814 - 00:00:50.494, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. Speaking to me also, many thanks for having me in the program. It's really very nice. Before I start decomposing groups, let me make two self advertisements. At least. There are going to be two things happening. One is a three week program, remote July 18 to August 5.
00:00:50.494 - 00:01:37.464, Speaker A: These are two weeks summer schools and a one week workshop on the occasion of 60th birthday of coffee and Sergey. And well, if you are early career or students then you get some good discounts for attending them. You need to apply for participation in the summer schools. The deadline is April 1, but it's straightforward to apply and you need to register for the workshop by April 15. All the information is online. This has been announced for Modnet. And the second thing is there is going to be a three year postdoc position in modern theory.
00:01:37.464 - 00:02:24.210, Speaker A: This has not been announced. It will be announced within a month, hopefully. And well, if you think you may be fine, then you can already talk to me and discuss about it. Okay, so that's about leads and how decomposing definable groups so this talk is about definable groups in various contexts, staying within or going beyond all minimal setting. And this is really going to be somewhat a survey talk, stated some open questions, reporting on their progress and some examples. Essentially no proofs. Okay, so now the general question.
00:02:24.210 - 00:02:51.114, Speaker A: The most way I could state a question that captures the flavor of this project is the following general question, and it will be actually a little too vague to even record a question. But here it is. Given the structure m.
00:02:53.334 - 00:02:54.070, Speaker B: Which is made.
00:02:54.102 - 00:03:03.434, Speaker A: Up of two structures, two structures.
00:03:07.824 - 00:03:08.184, Speaker B: X.
00:03:08.224 - 00:03:14.048, Speaker A: One and x two, can we decompose.
00:03:14.176 - 00:03:15.084, Speaker B: Groups.
00:03:23.064 - 00:03:24.524, Speaker A: Definable in M.
00:03:27.664 - 00:03:29.680, Speaker B: Into parts coming.
00:03:29.752 - 00:04:17.174, Speaker A: From x one and x two into groups or sets definable or internal as we want them. Again, in general, coming from x one and x two. So it's indeed very vague because there are two, three expressions in quotation marks. And the goal of this talk is to give precise meaning in some ways to these expressions. Particularly we will give two interpretations of meta. So let's start with that. Let's start explaining.
00:04:19.234 - 00:04:20.574, Speaker B: The metaphor.
00:04:24.774 - 00:05:31.874, Speaker A: So, two contexts. One is where we just put the two structures together, imposing no interaction between them. That's the disjoint union and is the disjoint union of x one and x two, which roughly, you know, is the two sorted structure where we have as basic sets, the definable sets here, and definable sets here. Or I think it's a new part of generality. Just write this as the structure whose universe is the joint unit of the universes. And again, we take all the findable sets next to the basic sets. So there is no interaction between the two structures definable here, meaning that there is no definable injective map between infinite sets.
00:05:38.894 - 00:05:39.994, Speaker B: Next one.
00:05:43.414 - 00:06:40.724, Speaker A: And it's actually a corollary of the general description of definable sets that you get almost by definition, that definable sets here in this n, a finite union of boxes of sets here, or sets here, or products of sets here of sets, fx one, fx two, and Cartesian products, let's say Cartesian products, because serial set is also x to the zero. Yeah, sure.
00:06:42.184 - 00:06:49.644, Speaker B: And s one, s two, where si is depth.
00:06:53.104 - 00:06:57.296, Speaker A: And this is after permuting coordinates. I could have x one cross x.
00:06:57.320 - 00:07:00.844, Speaker B: Two, cross x one after.
00:07:11.344 - 00:08:15.838, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a very nice description of definable sets here. And we can ask, how do definable groups look like in n? Are they, for example, direct products of definable groups in the two structures? So we will get to that after we also go to the second context, which is perhaps more in line with the tame phenomena over the years, this present, these weeks here. And so here. Okay, so here we have no interaction between the two structures. And now we will put them together with some interaction. And the easiest way to impose interaction is to let the universe of one be subset of the universe of the other. So now, just because it's more traditional, I will denote by r x one and by p x two, where the.
00:08:15.886 - 00:08:19.976, Speaker B: Universe of p is contained in the.
00:08:20.000 - 00:08:28.644, Speaker A: Universe of r. So then every definable set here lives in a power of r. So this makes sense.
00:08:30.944 - 00:08:31.804, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:32.224 - 00:09:13.804, Speaker A: And well, depending on what piece, this may be tame or not, whereas here, if x one and x two are ten, then the same as well. And there are two ways to construct such pairs. The one is where the p, the universe of the structure p, is already not definable. The other is where it is defined. So first way is where p is definable enough. And in this case.
00:09:19.504 - 00:09:20.216, Speaker B: In this case.
00:09:20.280 - 00:09:56.714, Speaker A: Already having just the universe of p, we have a new structure. This is a proper expansion of I. If I wanted to see it this way, then we could write Rp. This is the structure we're interested in. And this is r with structure p, where the structure p is the new structure on pin. So we impose no more sets than just p. So this is the pin where, assuming there's pin, and then we have all intersections with art definable sets.
00:10:09.164 - 00:10:12.436, Speaker C: And when you say definable, you mean with parameters.
00:10:12.500 - 00:10:36.124, Speaker A: Yes, so, yeah, everywhere definable is defined. Okay, so now examples where we get the same pair. Well, we have seen. So if p is. But these are more what I would be interested in, p could be.
00:10:36.904 - 00:10:38.244, Speaker B: Okay, r.
00:10:42.784 - 00:11:24.738, Speaker A: R is the real field and p is the real closer of q or two to the q. Or a density dependent set is here dependent. Or to do the same, some examples, in this case m is tame. And let's call this like m. This m is a ten pair. So ten is coming. Can't have many more examples.
00:11:24.738 - 00:11:33.134, Speaker A: But for this talk, let's just fix some examples. Okay, and if you have p.
00:11:35.074 - 00:11:35.410, Speaker B: You.
00:11:35.442 - 00:12:17.984, Speaker A: Have p beta zips, then it's not amuse. Sorry, whose examples of r and p are not examples? T is not defined. I'm talking about not defined. The first. Thank you. Okay, so obviously if. Okay, maybe I didn't give any examples here, but.
00:12:17.984 - 00:13:14.274, Speaker A: Well, here, any structures you take the joint union. Well, it's an example, but I still, maybe it's worth mentioning that examples that will appear in this talk is for example, r or the class with itself. It's already interesting to ask what are the groups here? And another natural example, sometimes if you have a nominal structure and you take z plus, the reason why this appears is because when you look at definable groups in omnibus structures, their universal cover is not definable. In the omnium structure, it's redefinable. But it turns out to be definable in such a disjoint union. Okay, we will not really speak about inverse of covers or that result. But these are the natural examples that we are concerned with.
00:13:14.274 - 00:13:44.500, Speaker A: And here, obviously, if I put z in joint union, then you maintain. But here you impose this interaction and you're no longer chained. Okay, so what's the direction we impose? We impose that there is injective map from p, from setting p setting out the inclusion. And in this examples, actually, you don't have the opposite direction.
00:13:44.652 - 00:13:45.344, Speaker B: So.
00:13:48.644 - 00:14:11.124, Speaker A: You don't have injective maps from r to k depend. Okay, and the second, so I will say more about descriptions of the final sets compared to this. But let me say a second case where I could have predefinable.
00:14:13.584 - 00:14:16.440, Speaker B: In r. Well, I don't know.
00:14:16.472 - 00:14:59.544, Speaker A: There may be many examples that have not been studied, but the one that I have worked on is actually so that the pair stays within the or minimal setting. And that's when you start with r being the real or the, and you put sp as a structure, p just having the restricted multiplication. So vg zero, one.
00:15:03.884 - 00:15:04.744, Speaker B: Squared.
00:15:06.564 - 00:16:02.254, Speaker A: So here m is just real of the proof restrictive multiplication. And we know from theorems that are Zmacker delay. But this lies strictly between the real orbit loop and the real orbit field, and it's called semibound. So let me call this semi bounded pair. And again, semibound pair can mean something more general. It could mean really any minimal expansion of an order divisible abelian group with bounded sets, as long as it stays on minimum. And what I said, it's called semi bounded, but for the purposes of this problem, I think of a semi bounded.
00:16:02.254 - 00:16:05.894, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:07.954 - 00:16:11.974, Speaker B: So now here we have the.
00:16:12.754 - 00:16:30.354, Speaker A: Definable sets, unions of, of boxes. What about the variable sets here where they are final units of homes? And I will say just a bit about it.
00:16:33.934 - 00:16:35.154, Speaker B: Okay, so.
00:16:37.534 - 00:16:39.794, Speaker A: Definable sets in two.
00:16:44.074 - 00:16:44.458, Speaker B: Our.
00:16:44.506 - 00:16:45.774, Speaker A: Final views.
00:16:51.994 - 00:16:58.426, Speaker B: Of cones, which depending on.
00:16:58.450 - 00:18:04.286, Speaker A: Which context you are, it may be harder to define or easier. So roughly speaking, cone is a set of the form H S J. Okay, and now I want to explain what S cross J is. It's not going to be as simple as being defined in P. And J will define both NR, but what is it? So let me, let me say we really want to understand definable sets here in these structures, in terms of definable sets here and findable sets here. So for example, in the semi bounded structure, you may say that, well, this is a reduct of the real field. So we, we know a cell decomposition coming from the real field.
00:18:04.286 - 00:18:30.490, Speaker A: That tells us something nice about definable sets, but it doesn't tell us much about how those sets depend on this structure and depend on this additional information. So I need a word to define what it means to be coming or relating to this additional information, and that will be internal to you.
00:18:30.642 - 00:18:38.426, Speaker B: So let me just explain from, and.
00:18:38.450 - 00:19:10.624, Speaker A: This is very general. If I mentioned structure index is a collection of definable sets and y is, is x internal. If there is an x.
00:19:14.444 - 00:19:14.980, Speaker B: This is.
00:19:15.012 - 00:19:17.824, Speaker A: Class and there is a definable.
00:19:20.154 - 00:19:20.970, Speaker B: F.
00:19:21.162 - 00:20:09.908, Speaker A: Such that f of x to some power that is n two contains y. I have not specified the rt and the domain of f, but it's so that this makes sense and it's true. And now four time pairs and semibunded pairs. We preserve a terminology for things that are p internal and semi bound pairs. We call them small means p internal. P is the collection of findable sets in the structure p and lux.
00:20:09.956 - 00:20:10.784, Speaker B: Otherwise.
00:20:21.844 - 00:20:52.482, Speaker A: So for example, the unit circle is internal to this p. All right, now these are what I will put for s and j. So let's come back. The final sets, or finite units, not of boxes, but of this kind of products. S is a small set. J is a large set. Here is where Rafi is concerned.
00:20:52.482 - 00:21:17.014, Speaker A: You can say much more about what j is. It's actually almost like a product of codeswall sets in intervals. And that's even not true. But anyway, this is actually true, but it doesn't give as much information as we could have. And h is a transformational box. It's an undefinable.
00:21:20.434 - 00:21:21.254, Speaker B: Map.
00:21:25.474 - 00:21:33.474, Speaker A: Again, I don't specify the domain of it, but so that pertains, of course, the next question.
00:21:36.174 - 00:21:37.278, Speaker B: All right, so let me give you.
00:21:37.286 - 00:22:50.994, Speaker A: A picture about a cone in the semi bounded case. In the semi bounded, we could, for example, take. We could take the graph of the multiplication, resisting multiplication in one of the planes, and we could stretch it in unboundedly much and semi linearly in this direction. So if this is s, which is internal, and j is the half axis, then this option is s. So we use just eight to be the addition.
00:22:54.854 - 00:22:55.310, Speaker B: Okay?
00:22:55.342 - 00:23:43.034, Speaker A: And the common decomposition says that every definable set here is a finite union of such objects. And what is interesting is that the same spirit, the same kind of structure theorem, is true in all these pairs. That makes me wonder where else this structure theorem is true. And I think it's. Well, I have several contexts in mind that it could go through. For example, if you replace all minimal structure by a geometric structure, you have lovely pairs of geometric structures. These are objects that were studied by Bernstein Vasiliev, among others.
00:23:43.034 - 00:24:36.534, Speaker A: But tameness have been shown, but not as a description of definable sets like this, or more in the neostability spirit, you could have this being a distal structure and this a neat pair, and you could ask about such decomposition. Or finally, you could have this to be a distal structure, and this is a DP minimal structure. And you can ask about such a decomposition. I mentioned the last one because here, as I said, we could have something more refined. And somehow through these cones, we get the notion of dimension that captures how large your set is, the same way that the notion of dimension in Ohm and multicaps, how we think you are.
00:24:38.674 - 00:24:39.414, Speaker B: And.
00:24:42.834 - 00:24:57.174, Speaker A: Here, if you had a distal expansion of the DP minimal structure, you can talk about DP rank. So I'm wondering if the notion of dimension you could get from such a structure here and there, could correspond to the DP rank.
00:24:57.694 - 00:25:02.354, Speaker B: Okay, good.
00:25:07.814 - 00:26:10.604, Speaker A: That's about sets. It's good to know some decomposition theorems about definable sets if we want to do decomposition for definable groups. And maybe this decomposition program is not so present in expansion program. Actually, I remember Phil once telling me that once he proved that the structure is tame, he no longer works on it. But here, my perspective is that I take a tame structure and know something about more difficult, there's something about opencore, and I'm trying to find the position of sets, get more description, geometric description, from that start point. All right? And my motivation has been to apply this decomposition in order to understand definable groups. So let's move to decomposing.
00:26:13.944 - 00:26:14.844, Speaker B: Groups.
00:26:18.884 - 00:26:31.624, Speaker A: Okay, so let's fix actually m s in one or two, and ge definitely.
00:26:37.204 - 00:26:41.064, Speaker B: Okay, so what can we say about.
00:26:42.214 - 00:26:54.154, Speaker A: Groups definable in these objects? As I announced before, the first question to ask is, is g a direct product?
00:26:57.294 - 00:26:58.526, Speaker B: Most of the time when I write.
00:26:58.550 - 00:28:03.724, Speaker A: The quote subdefinable isomer, it means definable isomer of groups which are xr internal. Okay, so in the second case, x one with node r and x two denotes p. Right? And this question is known in almost all examples. And the reason why it's not in all examples is the idea is about the same. And I want to illustrate that idea in the case of this joint union. So take m being the joint union, x one x two, where xi is a copy of the real order group. I have two copies of the real order group, and they take their disjoint union.
00:28:03.724 - 00:28:26.264, Speaker A: So of course, direct products are definable in this structure. So we could take, let's call x plus with the overuse of the sigma plus. This example is the direct product of, say, x.
00:28:33.464 - 00:28:35.404, Speaker B: That's for sure definable.
00:28:35.784 - 00:29:55.404, Speaker A: And now we could actually take quotients of these groups by some lattice and take those, the product of those. Let's let g one gi be zero one pass modulo z. So we add two things as usual. If their usual sum is here and we subtract one, otherwise this is definable in xi, and their product is, again, definable, is definable. And to construct an example which is not product, I'm going to rewrite this in a little more fancy way, and tweak a bit of definition. Get something that a group that hides the one dimensional definable subgroups. So this is zero one times zero one with plus modulo the lattice generated by zero one and 10.
00:29:56.784 - 00:29:57.644, Speaker B: Okay?
00:29:59.024 - 00:30:20.864, Speaker A: I mean, this is really isomorphic r squared. But I wrote it this way. Because now I can change a little definition, right? So maybe we have, which are clear. So we took.
00:30:26.804 - 00:30:31.260, Speaker B: This group, okay, and.
00:30:31.412 - 00:31:16.184, Speaker A: We took r square plus and we modeled out the lattice generated by these two elements and we could very change them in the lattice and put the lattice generator somewhere here. Or a rational. So the same where a is not in q. And I claim that this is not a product.
00:31:18.204 - 00:31:20.452, Speaker C: Shouldn't the second factor be zero comma.
00:31:20.508 - 00:31:28.264, Speaker A: A instead of zero comma one or d zero comma one? This is the first.
00:31:29.204 - 00:31:29.652, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:29.708 - 00:31:35.088, Speaker C: And this the second one you wrote zero comma one cross zero comma one again.
00:31:35.176 - 00:31:35.448, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:35.496 - 00:31:37.644, Speaker C: But shouldn't that be zero comma a?
00:31:38.664 - 00:32:23.524, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I wanted zero comma one. Yes. I mean if you do a fundamental domain here and you cut it and patch it, you get this is the fundamental domain. This is fundamental domain for this group. I don't want you to go up to here. How is, but there is no reason to, I mean.
00:32:30.484 - 00:32:31.836, Speaker B: So how do you.
00:32:31.940 - 00:32:37.744, Speaker C: Add in this group, zero comma one, cross zero comma one, you add.
00:32:40.284 - 00:32:41.904, Speaker A: The subsistence itself.
00:32:48.924 - 00:32:59.644, Speaker C: So okay, if you have an element higher up in this, in this square, a little bit above this point, one comma a.
00:33:01.384 - 00:33:03.724, Speaker A: What over there.
00:33:04.224 - 00:33:04.964, Speaker B: How.
00:33:09.824 - 00:33:15.924, Speaker C: I don't understand how the definition, how this group is defined.
00:33:17.244 - 00:34:26.597, Speaker A: I add two pairs as usual. If they are usual, some states in the box, and if not, then I send it to that element of the box that differs from the usual sum by an element in the lattice. So if I wanted to add this to itself, I would normally go here, but this is not in my domain. So I have to send it, the sum of this to itself is that element in the, in the box that differs by an element in the lattice. And that element is this point here, because this vector is a vector in the lattice 10 comma one and one. So what letters we have in mind here? Maybe another picture so far. Vector is here, another vector is here.
00:34:26.597 - 00:34:31.913, Speaker A: Right. So this is the usual fundamental, fundamental.
00:34:33.714 - 00:34:34.574, Speaker B: Domain.
00:34:41.154 - 00:34:58.934, Speaker A: And now this is the same as taking this part and moving it here. So I'm just changing the fundamental domain by cutting some piece or translating the.
00:34:59.794 - 00:35:01.974, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess, I guess I.
00:35:06.074 - 00:35:06.938, Speaker B: Okay.
00:35:07.066 - 00:35:20.614, Speaker A: So this is not a product of exi internal groups. And I will argue about this orally.
00:35:21.634 - 00:35:27.014, Speaker B: Well if, if it were, then there.
00:35:27.054 - 00:35:28.710, Speaker A: Should be one of the two xi.
00:35:28.742 - 00:35:32.674, Speaker B: Internal groups that covers this part.
00:35:34.094 - 00:35:36.534, Speaker A: The reason being that the x two.
00:35:36.574 - 00:35:53.068, Speaker B: Internal group projects onto finite set x one. So there should be an internal one.
00:35:53.116 - 00:36:49.004, Speaker A: Dimensional definable subgroup of this group that contains this part. But then if it contains this part, it must contain everything that's generated by this part. And as we added before, if I add this to itself, we get this point. If we add this part to itself, then you get this horizontal segment. And if you keep adding, you're going to get many horizontal segments count up in many because of the choice of a being irrational. So this one dimensional dependable subgroup would contain a countable horizontal lines. And that's not possible because it would project on an infinite set on the x two coordinate and x one inside.
00:36:49.044 - 00:36:55.764, Speaker B: Now sets a finite projection on x two, x one.
00:36:55.804 - 00:37:09.784, Speaker A: Let's play a little to see why. With this changing of the lattice generator, you get a group which is not a product. Okay, so.
00:37:16.864 - 00:37:18.304, Speaker B: I was hoping to make.
00:37:18.344 - 00:38:05.806, Speaker A: A whole list of questions here. I'm not sure how far. So this question, one phase or this joint union. Now, as I said, the same argument. You can construct groups that are not products of one of xi internal groups in many of the other structures. So here, let me have the structure r with p. And p is going to be qrc or two to the cube.
00:38:05.806 - 00:38:12.274, Speaker A: This is one sort of examples. Then could be density dependent set.
00:38:17.174 - 00:38:17.534, Speaker B: Or.
00:38:17.574 - 00:38:52.564, Speaker A: Two to the z. Okay, another example is, I consider non standard versions of this expansion. So here I have r p, which is a proper elementary extension of r bar z. Finally, I have semibounded pairs. The same kind of example works in these settings.
00:38:54.024 - 00:38:55.004, Speaker B: And here.
00:38:57.124 - 00:39:56.584, Speaker A: Here actually we get through in all the questions that are managed to state. So let me just say, do whatever to say, because there is an independent theorem for this category only of mine that says that the g is actually defined. So we don't have new groups definable in Argentina. And now for this setting, I actually don't know the answer to question one. Somehow I need to make a choice of that lattice generator a. And I can make it outside the standard copy of 2%. The group I define works, but otherwise I'm not sure.
00:39:56.584 - 00:39:58.084, Speaker A: So this is open.
00:39:59.744 - 00:40:05.480, Speaker B: Okay, good.
00:40:05.552 - 00:40:10.084, Speaker A: So now we found example.
00:40:13.044 - 00:40:13.516, Speaker B: Which is.
00:40:13.540 - 00:40:19.204, Speaker A: Not product of ex antenna groups.
00:40:19.364 - 00:40:27.824, Speaker B: But still it's not that fact, because it's a product of two exi internal cells.
00:40:28.124 - 00:40:48.304, Speaker A: If I take the product of this cell, of this cell in this group, I generate the whole group as one concept. So question two is g other of.
00:40:50.604 - 00:40:51.344, Speaker B: Two.
00:40:53.764 - 00:41:16.144, Speaker A: X I internal subsets of g, internal sub subsets or subgroups or subsets? Subsets, yes, subsets. So here I can take anyone this.
00:41:16.184 - 00:41:16.764, Speaker B: Set.
00:41:18.944 - 00:41:33.732, Speaker A: Back to this set and play with generate. So now that becomes more likely to be true.
00:41:33.788 - 00:41:36.344, Speaker B: Question and.
00:41:38.084 - 00:42:15.584, Speaker A: Question two. This is two in the disjoint union in the case x one and x two are minima. So this is yes, if xi is no minimum. And this is a theorem with Veracruzi Mameena, which is a proprietary, but it's not known. No other cases.
00:42:18.364 - 00:42:18.724, Speaker B: Here.
00:42:18.764 - 00:43:00.294, Speaker A: It is true, grounded. This is an earlier work with where we analyze. And really, the reason why I carry the semi boundary for everybody here is because the statements that we conjecture and proved for this case can be conjectured also in other cases, the question mark answers because the structure theorem actually was. The convolution was first true for the central case, and then we extended it.
00:43:00.334 - 00:43:00.914, Speaker B: To.
00:43:04.534 - 00:43:24.594, Speaker A: Pink pairs case. But I should say that this was worked with but in this setting, but in other settings here. All right, so for the last five minutes, I would like to say what projections.
00:43:28.854 - 00:43:33.914, Speaker B: Okay, so.
00:43:36.054 - 00:43:45.708, Speaker A: A corollary of this in the joint union case is what we say in general, as question three is.
00:43:45.756 - 00:43:46.344, Speaker B: D.
00:43:48.124 - 00:44:27.920, Speaker A: Isomorphic to h one cross h two over a lattice where h I is now a ventanal group. Actually, it's a kind of union of restriction on each of the multiplication in xi. So at the level of definable groups.
00:44:27.952 - 00:44:31.272, Speaker B: We managed to find subgroups somewhere.
00:44:31.328 - 00:44:45.732, Speaker A: Groups, okay? And there is a lattice by which I mean, again, subgroup of this that intersects every finite subsidy at the finite set.
00:44:45.788 - 00:44:46.044, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:44:46.084 - 00:44:57.908, Speaker A: Within the sets of every definable subsidy are the finite set. Okay, so, um, where is the first example? Yeah.
00:44:58.036 - 00:45:01.212, Speaker B: So here, r square would be h.
00:45:01.268 - 00:45:16.222, Speaker A: One cross h two, and z square is the lattice. It happened to be definable as square, but in the non standard setting. Okay, so now this follows from this.
00:45:16.278 - 00:45:22.430, Speaker B: Theorem here, because of orthogonality of the.
00:45:22.462 - 00:45:56.784, Speaker A: Two, because it's joint union. So question three here is true. And the way you do it is you generate the subgroups of g from a one from a two, and because of horizontality, the intersection happens to be a lattice. So when you send now x comma y to the product, the quotient happens to be a lattice.
00:45:58.964 - 00:46:02.544, Speaker B: For that, in general, we don't know.
00:46:03.324 - 00:47:24.692, Speaker A: Even in the semi bound case, what we know in the semi bound case. And this is the main thing that I'm conjecturing, is the following question. The universal cover of g will not be as good as product of two written fungal groups, but it may be an extension, a group extension of such groups. So is g u, where else? A lattice u is redefinable, and u pass a group extension where h is both are being. But this is x x one, x one internal. It's in fact generated by an x one internal set and k. So because we are not asymmetric as in the joint union case, we do hope to have something like this.
00:47:24.692 - 00:47:50.344, Speaker A: And that was proved in the same ground case, same work, and it's of course true to the product in the user case. The last thing I want to mention is question five, which there is enough of. Think fast.
00:47:50.424 - 00:47:57.524, Speaker B: All doubles I know are subgroups of undefinable groups.
00:48:00.864 - 00:48:03.164, Speaker A: I don't know any other.
00:48:03.944 - 00:48:06.896, Speaker B: Well, in the missing cases, to be.
00:48:06.920 - 00:49:00.964, Speaker A: Honest here it would have failed, because you can have an x two internal group. There will be a sudden of an x one internal group. Here it fails for a similar reason, but for the rest, it's open. Only thing we know in this direction is tiny theorem that I have that this is true for a group z definable in this case, but small. And for small groups, it's true for g small group. So this is really analysis of groups definable in weak or minimal non valuational structures. And there I've shown that cells groups are subgroups, dense subgroups of groups definable in the omnibus structure.
00:49:00.964 - 00:49:47.144, Speaker A: Now, interestingly, these theorems could give some applications of group theoretical interest. So both this theorem in the same bounded case and this theorem for the small groups implies place projection or comma combination and comma combination. In this case, it was not known for semi bounding case. And from this analysis we get it. And here we implied an extension of laser conjecture in this micro minimal context. All right, so that's all I have to say.
00:49:55.584 - 00:49:56.724, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:50:00.384 - 00:50:13.364, Speaker D: Yeah, so you said you're sort of looking into these questions for these contexts, but also other contexts where there's sort of this gray question that sounds. Are you familiar with your interpretive.
00:50:15.864 - 00:50:16.400, Speaker B: Two months?
00:50:16.432 - 00:50:19.304, Speaker A: I've seen the girlfriend, not so much.
00:50:19.464 - 00:50:31.582, Speaker D: I just, I feel like from everything that you laid out, there's maybe not the whole ACFA and GCF zero and random graphs, and maybe those aren't the.
00:50:31.598 - 00:50:33.558, Speaker B: Right settings, but maybe there's.
00:50:33.606 - 00:50:36.954, Speaker D: Yeah, a piece of the integrated framework.
00:50:37.614 - 00:50:38.174, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:50:38.214 - 00:50:39.494, Speaker D: These methods are sort of.
