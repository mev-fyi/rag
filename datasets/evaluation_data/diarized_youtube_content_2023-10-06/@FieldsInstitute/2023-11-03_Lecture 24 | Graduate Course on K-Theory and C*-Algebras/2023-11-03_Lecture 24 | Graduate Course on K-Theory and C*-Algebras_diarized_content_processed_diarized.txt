00:00:00.560 - 00:01:31.364, Speaker A: This fall reading week. So we won't, we won't be meeting next week, but we'll be meeting here next week. I'll welcome email everyone get my email yesterday. I'm hoping that the remaining point we haven't gone into concerning Pascal's triangle, the model predictivity of extreme points, extreme states, the state being a have a unit or ring. Well, ring is supposed to be unit, say a unit or ordered ring. And the unit of the ring is also called order unit. Some integral multiple positive integral multiple that majorizes anything in order group the polynomials of the Pascal ordering monomials x and one minus x positive generating the positive cone.
00:01:31.364 - 00:02:55.356, Speaker A: These, these, um, so positive function means positive on each of those. And by the way, um, we've seen how that fits into the Hausdorff moment problem. These positive numbers down the left hand side of the pascal's triangle, when you fill them, when you fill in the whole triangle with numbers at every point, positive, not necessarily a priori, not necessarily positive numbers, but if they, they all are positive, this corresponds to the, all the higher order, right? And that's, if you can actually construct a measure that has those moments, then finish. That's the moment. How do you get such a measure? Well, you have a positive functional already, and that's what a measure is, right? The positive functional and continuous function. Continuous function. And that's a theorem.
00:02:55.356 - 00:04:25.190, Speaker A: If it's not the definition of a measure, then there's a theorem that says one of the two Reese representation. Okay, so, but it's only defined in polynomials so far, and it's not point wise, positive a priori. It's just positive on these monomials, which of course are positive on the, strictly positive on the interior. So it turns out that strictly positive on the interior for a polynomial, is exactly what this, what the pascal order relation is. And it's prove that we need the calculate the stream point, and we use that to prove that something was in the interior of the interval was a sum of monomials. Calculate the extreme points, extreme positive functions. Well, you can do it immediately if you know their model frequently.
00:04:25.190 - 00:06:14.984, Speaker A: You know they're model frequently. Then on the monomial you need to, by the way, take x, and x lies between zero and one. And so a positive function will lie between zero and one on x, because at least the state, because it's equal to one on one and zero on zero and one x lies in between those. So it takes on some value if you know it's multiplicative, and then it takes one minus that value on one minus that. And if you know it's multiplicative, then you know what it is on all monomials and x and one minus x and that's positive. So that's, that was an important step in the proof the two order relations are the same needed to show that the state triangle order is continuous on the bounded, bounded functional on polynomials on, which means that it's a polynomial, you know, the polynomials are dense and continuous functions and it tends to cause the functional function, the point wise order. Okay, so how many people got a chance to look at the question of proving model predictivity? Well, if not so many.
00:06:14.984 - 00:08:22.032, Speaker A: Well, okay, so let's, let's take a look at it. Now you're assuming it's a screen point. Suppose that group upon them have a positive element and why that element is positive. And let's say it's a state five one, one. It's, we want to talk about screen points. And it shouldn't just be all functionals because if every possible multiple, every positive field and multiple of the functional is positive in the set of positive things, it's not going to have very many extreme points. I guess so.
00:08:22.032 - 00:08:32.776, Speaker A: Are there any extreme points if you have a cone? Are there any extreme points or what you might call extreme rays? I don't think there are any extreme points.
00:08:32.840 - 00:08:33.448, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:33.616 - 00:08:41.448, Speaker A: Well, oh, the apex, the point of the cone might or might not be an extreme point.
00:08:41.496 - 00:08:41.680, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:41.712 - 00:09:31.052, Speaker A: Depending on how acute the cone is. Sharpen it. We're not interested in zero. So that's why what you do is you cut the cone across. And if you, if it's functional, then a good way to cut it across is to say we'll look at one and um, we know every, no, no, non, zero, positive functional is, non is equal to zero on one because one is an order unit. That's an exercise. We look at all positive functions, or we, no one really maybe ignore it.
00:09:31.052 - 00:10:21.724, Speaker A: No one really says we have to look at all positive functions. And I guess, well, you know, this whole business, this whole long business of the house moment problem, this is a very good subject for an essay I would recommend. It's a one or essay two. And you don't have to actually go through all the details of all the proof, but maybe organize things. Steps are so that the reader knows what the different steps are and what them has to be improved. Okay, but you want to know, so you look at the states.
00:10:21.804 - 00:10:22.544, Speaker C: Okay.
00:10:31.124 - 00:12:34.856, Speaker A: And so we want to know extreme, if we're going to calculate the extreme points, I guess we want to know it's equivalent to being more flickable, right? If we have an extreme point, then knowing it's more precisely helps you find out what the functional is. Valuation at some point on the end of the consider the polynomial functions on the interval and evaluate all the monomials are point wide. Conversely, if you want to know what's. Want to know what all the extreme points are, I guess we want to be able to see that the evaluations at points on the closed interval are, we want to know. That's with respect to the product polynomials. Multiplication of polynomials on one hand and multiplication of real number on the other. That's what the exercise, that's what the remaining step is to know.
00:12:34.856 - 00:14:58.144, Speaker A: We want to assume, okay, but a and b, but a, positive a, maybe positive one, and let b vary. Anyone ever seen that happen before? Sometimes when you're calculating limits for a product, you might fix one of the variables and let the other one go to the limit, which is similar to that. What we want to do is write phi, sub a for the function of b goes to PI. B is arbitrary. A is fixed. Well, this is a function, okay? And it's a positive function because b is positive, or a is positive and a times B is positive because that's what happens in an ordered ring. So this is the positive function and phi a phi, sub a of one.
00:14:58.144 - 00:15:41.804, Speaker A: Well, we want to prove that bayes are a state, because by phi a over one is equal to phi a. Okay? But by the way, what I'm doing is what everyone should be doing this morning or last night, right? This is how you approach. You don't have any idea what to do, but you just go ahead anyway.
00:15:43.224 - 00:15:44.656, Speaker C: That's what I think.
00:15:44.680 - 00:16:03.644, Speaker A: That's what you do in a lot of, a lot of areas, as long as it's reasonably safe. Like if I'm standing in front of a large class, maybe that's not what I should do, but.
00:16:07.624 - 00:16:08.256, Speaker C: I can say.
00:16:08.280 - 00:17:27.684, Speaker A: That the reason I'm doing it is to set an example, right? Now suppose if phi a, suppose phi a happened to be zero. Well, then you will have to worry about that later. The point is, I want to, I want to consider first the page system that PI of a is not equal to zero. So hold on, a is a polynomial and phi of a is a number. Now, of course, a might be zero, a might be zero, but in that case, ab is always zero too. And so you have multiplicativity. Very five ab is zero because ab is zero, and five a times five b is also zero because phi of a is zero.
00:17:27.684 - 00:18:25.950, Speaker A: So it's not quite so simple. You'd have to prove that a times b is zero. Okay, that's what. Let's say that's another day. The point is that the PI values phi a is not equal to zero. Then phi, sub a divided by phi of a, is the state. Okay? Evaluated on one.
00:18:25.950 - 00:19:25.510, Speaker A: You get phi of a divided by phi of a. And furthermore, suppose you look at phi, so a plus one minus a. So notice that one minus a is also positive. So we can do the same thing for one minus, all right? And phi of B is equal to phi of a times phi, sub a. PI, sub a of b plus phi. One minus a divided times phi, sub one minus a. So of course we have to, we also assume we don't.
00:19:25.510 - 00:19:28.034, Speaker A: We assume that phi of a is not equal to one either.
00:19:35.774 - 00:19:40.314, Speaker C: So arithmetic is done.
00:19:41.294 - 00:19:47.784, Speaker B: Phi of balance.
00:20:03.914 - 00:20:24.194, Speaker C: Yeah. Five ab is five, sub a of b. And that's what this first term is. Five b is the sum of two. But first thing is five ab, that's 580.
00:20:24.494 - 00:20:32.678, Speaker B: And this is, if you add it.
00:20:32.766 - 00:20:34.354, Speaker C: You have eight plus one.
00:20:46.754 - 00:20:47.494, Speaker B: Well.
00:20:49.834 - 00:20:53.394, Speaker C: That'S just checking. That's just checking that that's true.
00:20:53.434 - 00:20:53.754, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:53.794 - 00:21:36.114, Speaker C: Five b is the average. Five a plus what? Five, one minus a is equal to one, both positive and equal to one. So it's a, we're getting a convex combination, getting what's called as an average. It's an average of five, one minus. So phi is an average of phi, phi one minus eight. Phi is an average of from.
00:21:41.134 - 00:21:41.510, Speaker B: Phi.
00:21:41.542 - 00:21:57.410, Speaker C: Is average of phi sub area. And phi is of one minus. But that means that if phi is extreme. But if you have an average, then it's equal to the endpoints. There are no non trivial averages. Yes, but we don't know that PI sub a is. Okay, sorry.
00:21:57.410 - 00:22:01.434, Speaker C: It's a state. PI sub a might not be a state. No, no.
00:22:01.514 - 00:22:02.134, Speaker B: Well.
00:22:04.074 - 00:22:30.874, Speaker C: As we're talking about states, right, it means positive functionals on the order group normalized. So phi sub a is also a functional. Now, it's not a state, but you divide it. You divide it by phi of a. Then you get a state. And so then you're multiplying that state by this. You're averaging two states.
00:22:30.874 - 00:22:40.674, Speaker C: You're averaging two states. And so if that is an extreme point, then that means that it's trivial average. Okay, so.
00:22:51.354 - 00:22:52.426, Speaker A: At some point I'd like.
00:22:52.450 - 00:22:54.874, Speaker C: To keep an opening.
00:22:54.914 - 00:22:55.494, Speaker B: And.
00:22:57.714 - 00:23:45.734, Speaker C: So Phi extremely of a. What are the two things around? Okay, so actually I think shouldn't divide it here by five by five a, right.
00:23:48.794 - 00:23:49.534, Speaker B: Well.
00:23:52.154 - 00:24:52.200, Speaker C: Perfectly wrong. Okay, but you see, does everyone see the idea? So what I hope is that you have enough time over the weekend and even without tipping into next week to check out that. No, we're not finished yet, but it's fine. Extremely. Saying that phi a over phi of a is equal to phi ab. So I'm hopelessly mixed up now.
00:24:52.232 - 00:24:52.884, Speaker B: Okay.
00:24:54.824 - 00:25:11.424, Speaker C: I think that this is the, this is what students are fairly advanced students should get a chance to see. They should get a chance to see someone get mixed up and have a chance to figure it out because definitely this is a solvable problem.
00:25:20.924 - 00:25:30.364, Speaker B: Okay, so after the break, after we.
00:25:35.544 - 00:25:54.814, Speaker C: Okay, well, there was another place where I didn't finish the proof, okay? Now if I were a few people weren't so advanced and weren't such good students. So you can see what's going on, then maybe I would try to fake it and say, I'm doing this on purpose.
00:25:55.234 - 00:25:56.094, Speaker B: Okay?
00:25:57.794 - 00:26:01.974, Speaker C: And who knows? Maybe I'm just very modest in any way I am.
00:26:03.754 - 00:26:04.498, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:04.626 - 00:26:55.396, Speaker C: But very intact. But there was another, exactly another point. And that was looking at the. Okay, so we had the two projections because we have k zero and we want to show that this is exact.
00:26:55.460 - 00:26:56.184, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:56.684 - 00:26:58.500, Speaker C: Means you have something in the kernel.
00:26:58.532 - 00:26:59.104, Speaker B: So.
00:27:00.924 - 00:27:24.194, Speaker C: E and f a is unitvolved. So we define k zero by looking at projections. Well, or in the matrix algebra, not even how you adjoin a unit. And then you map onto this. So there is a unit.
00:27:41.394 - 00:27:41.778, Speaker B: Is there.
00:27:41.786 - 00:27:44.934, Speaker C: A place here where extra batteries would.
00:27:50.754 - 00:27:52.294, Speaker B: Make sure to do that next time?
00:28:16.254 - 00:28:22.474, Speaker C: Projections in the algebra a, because that's what, when the algebra has a unit.
00:28:23.894 - 00:28:24.834, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:28:26.534 - 00:29:06.764, Speaker C: When the algebra has a unit, that's how we define. Just like that's how you define given the natural numbers, counting numbers, all in grade two. Maybe you get the integers, takeaway numbers. You look at pairs of natural numbers, then that's one way to do it. And then you imagine four take away two or same as six take away four. So you look at all those pairs where the difference in two. And that's.
00:29:06.764 - 00:29:12.584, Speaker C: You don't have any way of writing. You don't have anything. You don't have any way to write.
00:29:12.624 - 00:29:13.324, Speaker B: You have.
00:29:18.264 - 00:29:27.764, Speaker C: But you don't have a formal definition. Maybe the formal definition would be just to look at all the pairs.
00:29:29.104 - 00:29:31.096, Speaker B: The difference is the same, which you.
00:29:31.120 - 00:29:36.464, Speaker C: Get by saying the difference between two pairs is the same. That's expressed by just by using addition.
00:29:36.544 - 00:29:37.164, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:37.544 - 00:29:39.964, Speaker C: You just move things to the other side of the equation.
00:29:42.424 - 00:29:42.952, Speaker B: And it's the.
00:29:42.968 - 00:30:06.004, Speaker C: Same here you the formal group is got by from the semi group got by taking pairs of things in a semi group of equivalence classes. And then you want to wonder when the difference should be considered the same. Well, that's defined in terms of the semi group operation of addition.
00:30:06.084 - 00:30:06.732, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:06.908 - 00:30:46.704, Speaker C: You just, what that means is that the e and the f are not unique. So the trick that I forgot is at the very, very beginning you use this is probably everyone has seen this. Maybe. I'll bet everyone has seen this. Most of you have seen it. When you look at the pair of projections to represent the k class, you can always assume that one of them is the unit or the unit of some matrix algebra because it's always going to be less than or equal. That projection is always going to be less than or equal to the, the unit in some matrix algebra.
00:30:46.704 - 00:31:00.584, Speaker C: And so you look at the difference and you add it, you get the unit and you add that same thing to the other projection. And that's just like going from a pair four two to six four. You add two to each side.
00:31:01.164 - 00:31:02.716, Speaker B: Okay, so that's.
00:31:02.860 - 00:31:08.504, Speaker C: But then I can just, I can assume that f is equal to one.
00:31:09.284 - 00:31:09.860, Speaker B: But that's.
00:31:09.892 - 00:31:30.804, Speaker C: Now I shouldn't have to say anything because what we have, what we, what we want to do is find this. We want both e and f belong to I Tilde, right? By considering I was just contained in a, in a joining unit, ok, I Tilde or a matrix algebra over I tilde.
00:31:30.844 - 00:31:31.428, Speaker B: Ok?
00:31:31.596 - 00:31:36.868, Speaker C: That's what we want e and f to be. Cause that's, that's how you get k sub e and k zero of I.
00:31:36.916 - 00:31:37.504, Speaker B: Right?
00:31:38.444 - 00:32:29.164, Speaker C: And what we did do is reduced already without even remembering that the f could be a tripson, we reduced to the case that e minus f e is equal to f minus the ideal. And what we want is both of them should be in the ideal. Well, not exactly in the ideal with the unit they're doing. But it's just that, okay, how many people can finish the argument? The one line. Finish to the argument, Abigail. We want f, both e and f to be an I tilde. And of course by definition the unit is in I tilde or matrix algebra.
00:32:29.164 - 00:32:55.036, Speaker C: And so. So we have f. And notice that e minus f belongs to I. And of course I is contained in I tilde.
00:32:55.100 - 00:32:55.704, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:57.664 - 00:33:02.804, Speaker C: So how many people can finish the proof? Half a line now.
00:33:04.704 - 00:33:05.920, Speaker B: No hands.
00:33:06.112 - 00:33:08.244, Speaker C: Okay, there's one. There's one.
00:33:10.424 - 00:33:20.640, Speaker B: Because we have that at the bottom. I can't quite hear you because e minus f is a nine tilde and f is a non tilde. Yeah. Yes.
00:33:20.792 - 00:33:49.884, Speaker C: You just have to be able to. Speaking of addition and subtraction, that's what we're. So that's what this is talking about, right? Yeah. Good. Okay, well, that's, that's, by the way, we have exactness here now and also for k one because k, if we follow these other building proof like k one, is just k zero of the suspension. Now that's not what it is true for real scalers, too. But then.
00:33:56.944 - 00:33:59.560, Speaker B: But by the way, if.
00:33:59.592 - 00:34:19.534, Speaker C: Suppose we looked at the definition of k one in terms of invertibles or unitaries, in fact, and tried to prove it should be called one third.
00:34:19.574 - 00:34:26.286, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:34:26.310 - 00:34:31.514, Speaker C: It turns out for k one defined that way, it's easier than for k zero.
00:34:32.174 - 00:34:33.034, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:35.574 - 00:35:23.034, Speaker C: Anyone taking a look at it? Well, let's take a look at it now, because we have a unitary element of a, that means it's connected, okay? Connected to the unit in some matrix element. But that means that we've already mentioned this in the Pascal triangle setting. No, sorry, we mentioned it's proving reduced the case. We didn't do it. I stated it. I said there's something, the unit rays in the connected component of the identity. And it's a finite product of exponential.
00:35:23.034 - 00:35:27.354, Speaker C: Exponentials of two PI I times.
00:35:30.574 - 00:35:31.754, Speaker B: Self joint.
00:35:33.954 - 00:35:40.294, Speaker C: Of course, you don't need to say there's no, no projection around, so you don't need to say two PI I.
00:35:41.274 - 00:35:42.134, Speaker B: Okay?
00:35:42.754 - 00:36:05.016, Speaker C: But you need to say I take I times yourself a joint. And the exponential that is unitary. And if it's just a bandic algebra complex. Bandic algebra. And you can still exponentially e times any element, it doesn't, don't need the I. Well, this should be, this is true for a real alphabetical algebra, too. So you don't need to need the.
00:36:05.040 - 00:36:05.604, Speaker B: I.
00:36:09.504 - 00:36:55.090, Speaker C: Any element you can exponentiate, right? And the point is that you have a finite product of exponentials. Each exponential comes from upstairs, okay? So we have a unitary vertical element in a and downstairs it's a finite product of exponentials. But if we lift those exponentials are the image of exponentials up here, right? So we take, and those are connected to the unit. So we take the unit, the original invertible element, and wipe off the exponentials. Because once we collect its k one class, we can suppose that the original inverted realm maps into the unit. Exactly. Into the unit.
00:36:55.090 - 00:37:26.934, Speaker C: Because the exponentials don't carry, they don't cut any ice at all. That's still an expression. 50 years ago it was an expression. I guess not too long ago, not too much longer ago than 50 years, people had ice boxes. They didn't have refrigerators. If you plug in, they had, they often had ice boxes. I think we always had a refrigerator.
00:37:26.934 - 00:37:58.996, Speaker C: But in the town where I grew up, there was an ice house where ice was cut from the river and packed in sawdust and there all year round. I remember finding it once. I think I dug away in the sawdust to find the ice. I didn't know what it was for, but I hope I covered it up afterwards. Okay, but cutting ice means cutting it.
00:37:59.020 - 00:38:00.144, Speaker B: For the winter, right?
00:38:05.044 - 00:38:26.334, Speaker C: And it wasn't just in this town that happened to be on the river and had thick ice and ice everywhere. Okay, so we have a unitary that maps to the unit. Then it already belongs to I Tilde and we're finished.
00:38:27.234 - 00:38:28.098, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:28.266 - 00:39:07.064, Speaker C: Okay, but that's it. And that's okay. So that's an exercise to think about. You have a vertical element of a venom, of course. So the inverse makes sense in the output. Then it's a finite and it's connected to the, connected by a path and vertical elements to the unit. You can always talk this exercise, talk about unitaries if you want to.
00:39:07.064 - 00:39:13.428, Speaker C: Well, except real careful, you get to walk through this.
00:39:13.596 - 00:39:21.984, Speaker B: I said it's going to be okay. But.
00:39:24.084 - 00:39:54.084, Speaker C: The point is that the connected component of the fuel. Actually this is. Do you have a question? Okay, anyone have a question? Yes, by the way, let me just interrupt. I think at any moment everyone should have at least one question. Okay, so if I ask, if you have. You have a question, then you can, you don't have to just sit there.
00:39:54.904 - 00:39:55.764, Speaker B: Okay.
00:39:56.204 - 00:40:05.724, Speaker C: Because I probably. I have questions. You ask me if I have a question. I bet you I could. Actually, at the moment I might be at a bit of a loss.
00:40:05.764 - 00:40:08.544, Speaker B: Okay, great.
00:40:10.324 - 00:40:11.664, Speaker D: I was thinking about.
00:40:16.044 - 00:40:17.124, Speaker B: I was thinking.
00:40:17.164 - 00:40:20.384, Speaker D: About the above question, the last question.
00:40:20.884 - 00:40:22.104, Speaker B: Yes, please.
00:40:30.494 - 00:40:31.234, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:31.854 - 00:40:35.230, Speaker D: I want to say if I think.
00:40:35.342 - 00:40:35.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:37.934 - 00:41:01.784, Speaker D: I think that the same method that you use for Zx, you should do it for zx two and then all down. Yes. For there, for example, I think if it is right for zx two, it will be a one minus a and a multiplied a times one minus ten.
00:41:04.404 - 00:41:23.084, Speaker C: Do it work like this? Do you mean this? What you have to prove is a triceration. What you have to prove is it's equal to phi of a. It's equal to five a times five.
00:41:23.584 - 00:41:24.176, Speaker B: Yes.
00:41:24.280 - 00:41:26.304, Speaker C: That's what you, that's what you want to prove.
00:41:26.424 - 00:41:26.728, Speaker B: Yes.
00:41:26.776 - 00:41:29.404, Speaker D: For the phi in z.
00:41:31.544 - 00:41:32.120, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:32.232 - 00:41:33.724, Speaker C: For the phi in Z.
00:41:39.744 - 00:41:47.740, Speaker D: For the fee instead of x two. Okay, we can, you know, we can.
00:41:47.772 - 00:41:48.944, Speaker B: Do the same thing.
00:41:50.284 - 00:42:08.572, Speaker C: It sounds good, but why don't, why don't you send me, or even better still, send everyone an email you have, think you have a nice little proof. It shouldn't be no more than a few lines. It could be in just a few lines. And if you know how to do.
00:42:08.588 - 00:42:11.134, Speaker B: It, then just what else would.
00:42:20.474 - 00:42:23.094, Speaker D: Zx and then for zx two.
00:42:23.434 - 00:42:24.174, Speaker C: And.
00:42:28.594 - 00:42:38.520, Speaker D: I thought that in this broad diagram, and now we are somehow between the level one and one and one minus six.
00:42:38.642 - 00:42:39.108, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:39.196 - 00:42:39.772, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:39.908 - 00:42:43.964, Speaker D: And then we go, for example, for the level two to three.
00:42:44.044 - 00:42:44.804, Speaker B: Yes, right.
00:42:44.844 - 00:42:54.332, Speaker C: But you know, at the moment we're just talking about a general order of ring. Yeah. Diagram is a special case and I don't know if that's going to help.
00:42:54.388 - 00:43:16.284, Speaker B: To, and also find out.
00:44:17.464 - 00:45:17.304, Speaker C: How did you reach the point where you said that unitary maps the unit? And then we concluded, what was the step? Okay, we're going to put an exactness right in the middle. It's called half exactness for the whole. All right, well, so you speak unit term and k one class match the k one of the quotient. You take the class of the unit varying quotient. We're assuming that's zero in the k one group, which means that the unitary is connected. That's the definition next component of the unit of the 14,000. The point is that we have.
00:45:19.084 - 00:45:19.372, Speaker B: And.
00:45:19.388 - 00:45:24.652, Speaker C: The unitary has passive unit variable to the unit, and that unitary must be.
00:45:24.668 - 00:45:28.452, Speaker B: A finite product of exponentials, which is.
00:45:28.468 - 00:45:33.028, Speaker C: The I eight e to the I eight one e to the I eight.
00:45:33.076 - 00:45:34.180, Speaker B: Two, and so on.
00:45:34.332 - 00:45:40.092, Speaker C: And each one of those missed unitary observances also connected to one, by the.
00:45:40.108 - 00:45:40.664, Speaker B: Way.
00:45:49.844 - 00:45:57.904, Speaker C: Starting at one and going down to zero. Once you got these upstairs, they're in the connectors.
00:46:04.124 - 00:46:05.304, Speaker B: Get rid of them.
00:46:06.804 - 00:46:29.924, Speaker C: All you get is the unit. And then that says unitary upstairs. It's already exactly where you want it. You have to keep reviewing things like that. That's how you review a proof.
00:46:32.344 - 00:46:33.084, Speaker B: Well.
00:46:35.584 - 00:46:46.474, Speaker C: Everyone knows that. The question is, do people know that you have to do it in real time? That's what event students.
00:46:49.614 - 00:46:50.926, Speaker B: Learn how to.
00:46:51.110 - 00:47:46.134, Speaker C: Do this reviewing in real time. Do it five minutes later after the class or later in the day. But now we're getting the next thing to talk about. Not next week, but the week after is what happens in the complex scalar case when we try to prove that. Well, I guess we should be already talking about the index map. One of the quotient zero of the ideal which makes this, which is exact at the two ends of that arrow. We could talk about that before we concentrate on the complex case that's called the even index map and the odd index map, which we've already defined.
00:47:46.134 - 00:48:26.484, Speaker C: We got some map. We have. And that's. We're going to have to. Well, that takes some serious work. Okay, but just use one of the theorems of the 20th century, and that's my guess, is that weighed heavily, heavily in how bot was distinguished among all. One year he was distinguished among all american scientists, or even, which we can share in the glory of, because he came from here.
00:48:26.484 - 00:48:29.324, Speaker C: Well, he came from Czechoslovakia a long.
00:48:29.364 - 00:48:30.864, Speaker B: Time earlier.
00:48:34.524 - 00:48:35.884, Speaker C: Part of his education here.
