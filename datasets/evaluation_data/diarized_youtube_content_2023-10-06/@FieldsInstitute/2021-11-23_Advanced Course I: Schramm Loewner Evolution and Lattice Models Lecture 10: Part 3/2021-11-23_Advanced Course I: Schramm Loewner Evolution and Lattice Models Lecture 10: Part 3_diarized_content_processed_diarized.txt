00:00:09.880 - 00:00:54.514, Speaker A: Let me unmute myself. That helps. So we are continuing studying the image of a curve, gamma under this map, phi. And so for this, we consider this composition. So again, we go from upper half plane, full upper half plane, topper half plane without gamma. Then we go to the image by phi, and then we unwrap it back. And then.
00:00:54.514 - 00:01:50.534, Speaker A: So since this is the Leonard curve and its image is also Leonard curve, let sine star of t will be the driving function of gamma star. So this is gt star of gamma t star, right? So by definition, remember that the driving function that was part of theorem, the driving function of a Leo curve is the image of the tip. Okay, but this is just phi t of gt of gamma t. Right? So this is phi t gt phi ft of gt. So f t with gt cancels. So this is the same as gamma t. So this is the same as gt of phi of gamma t.
00:01:50.534 - 00:02:43.604, Speaker A: And the gt of gamma t is the driving force of gamma. This is b of kappa t. So this driving function of phi is of rather gamma star is just image under phi t of the brownian motion. Okay, now let's try to write Leo's equation. What we notice that. Remember, to write Luovner equation, you need this guy to be two t. And the time is is specifically selected that it is two t for gamma, but maybe not for gamma star.
00:02:43.604 - 00:03:30.764, Speaker A: The capacity did change, so we need to introduce this change of variables factor back. So instead of the normal two t here with the normal two, we would have derivative of a star of t. Again, I don't yet know that it exists, but we will compute it in a moment. So gt satisfies this version of Leomnar, so it's, again, not normalized. Leonard chain. Remember, one of the things we did, we normalize lemur chains, but this is not yet normalized. And so there is this factor dt of a star t divided by jt star minus driving function.
00:03:30.764 - 00:04:32.913, Speaker A: And now I claim that actually this derivative exists and it's equal to the derivative for phi t in this point. This is a well defined top value squared. This is a well defined object, because remember, phi was defined in this whole neighborhood. So a real line is not boundary point for it. Okay, so let me do a sketch of the proof. I don't want to go into too many details, but the sketch is the following. So let's start growing our sle curve, sle kappa curve from the point b of kappa t.
00:04:32.913 - 00:05:21.982, Speaker A: Remember, we have this domain Markov property, which means that this little part would be eventually mapped to gamma of tt plus epsilon. So this little part, gamma epsilon of T is gt of gamma of t plus epsilon by definition. So this is sla kappa just in the upper half plane. And then again by, since it's esy l e k, everything is normalized. Half plane capacity of this gamma tilde of epsilon is two epsilon. Now we look at the same thing. So this thing, let's write it down.
00:05:21.982 - 00:06:25.554, Speaker A: So this is gt of gamma star of T plus epsilon. So after this map, phi t, we get this. So now by composition rule, remember we had composition rule for half plane complexity. Let me try to find it. So composition rule for half plane capacity was exactly this. That half plane capacity of a bigger thing is half plane capacity of a small thing plus half plane capacity of unwriping of the difference. So let's return here.
00:06:25.554 - 00:07:24.194, Speaker A: Half plane capacity of t plus epsilon, of gamma star res of t plus epsilon. It's a star of T plus epsilon. Remember, this is half plane capacity of gamma star of T plus half plane capacity of Gamma Star of Epsilon by composition rule. But for small enough epsilon, half plane capacity of Gamma Star of Epsilon, it's about the same as half plane capacity of rescaled copier of this. And this is where things get murky because, well, they're close. This is very close to this, rescaled by. So this is half plane capacity of gamma of Epsilon.
00:07:24.194 - 00:08:32.384, Speaker A: So this is just close to scaled copy of this. But actually we need some estimates which are not that complicated to show that then the half plane capacities are actually also very close up to factors which are capital of epsilon squared. But if we believe this estimate, again, this is something I am not proving, that since this is true, we have, that they have plane capacities also. But then by scaling, this is just phi t multiplied by half plane capacity of this. Remember, that's how use your half plane capacity scales. When you rescale, it's multiplied by the square of the rescaling factor. So this is phi t prime squared multiplied by two epsilon.
00:08:32.384 - 00:09:48.924, Speaker A: So this gives you exactly this. So this is the derivative in epsilon, right? So half plane capacity of gamma Tilde of epsilon. This is, and let me spell it out more carefully, that half plane capacity of gamma star of t plus epsilon minus half plane capacity of gamma star of t. This is just half plane capacity of gamma tilde by this composition rule. And so, well, exactly as I said here. And then when we divide by epsilon, we get this, okay, now this derivative exists. Now.
00:09:48.924 - 00:10:20.814, Speaker A: And more than that, we can just plug this in here. This is great. Okay, let's walk further with this. I want to estimate the derivative time derivative of phi. And let's do this. So, we can use chain rule that this is first time derivative of gt at the .5 t of z plus.
00:10:20.814 - 00:11:21.314, Speaker A: And here we need to take time derivative of this. But this, of course, composed this space derivative of gt star. So this is gt star multiplied by the derivative of this multiplied by time derivative of ft. And so here we can simply write down what this is, because we know that dt gt at the point. And here we apply it at the point phi of ft of z. This is this. This is dt of 80 known multiplied by dt star minus psi star of t.
00:11:21.314 - 00:11:54.654, Speaker A: And remember that psi star of t is phi t of b t. So the first part would simply become this construct, and then the next part would become. And here we use. We differentiate this. This would be f. Well, first, the derivative of this multiplied by the derivative. Okay, so.
00:11:54.654 - 00:12:33.314, Speaker A: Okay, let me try to decipher what I meant here. So this is phi prime of ft. This. Ah, sorry. This is prime at this point, divided by phi prime at the point ft of z divided by what divided by multiple light rads by dt of ft of z, which satisfies. Well, it satisfies. Okay, so now we rewrap everything here.
00:12:33.314 - 00:13:42.204, Speaker A: So this part stays the same, and this part becomes simply phi t. So after, you know, multiply all those guys, it simply become minus phi t prime of z divided by z minus beta of kappa T. And now let us take the limit when z goes to b of kappa T. And again, I don't want to justify too rigorously, but when z goes to b of kappa t, you can just expand everything up to second order to get that. When z is equal to b of capital. Again, phi is very well defined on the real line. So phi t of b of kappa T is analytic in the neighborhood of b of capital.
00:13:42.204 - 00:14:42.304, Speaker A: So this dt of b of t. Again, you just do Taylor expansion. And after standard procedures here, you get that this is minus three phi t double prime, second derivative of phi t at the point b of capital. So now I want to write down what this is. This is phi t of b of kappa T. And we just use eta and Leonard. So this would become dt of phi tb of kappa t plus kappa over two phi t prime b of kappa t dt.
00:14:42.304 - 00:15:43.624, Speaker A: Right? So plus fet prime b of kappa tb of kappa T. Okay, and then, now just use this. So this becomes Kamp over two minus three phi t prime phi t. Rather, second derivative of phi t at the point b of kappa t plus db of capital weighted by vt prime of b of capital. And now you see what happens, why Kappa equals to six special. That's why I wanted to do it with arbitrary Kappa, because this thing suddenly becomes zero. So xi t is just pt prime db of 60.
00:15:43.624 - 00:16:46.714, Speaker A: And now we do the time change, the usual thing we have. So we see that this is local martingale, let's change time. So this would be the time change. So this is just the r of t such moments that this integral is equal to t integral of exactly square of this. And so with this change, d psi star of r is exactly the brownian motion. And this db of Kappa R, well, Kappa is six, it's feti prime of b of 60, db of 60. So we see that our star is just brownian motion scaled by this square root of six factor.
00:16:46.714 - 00:17:59.434, Speaker A: Because you see, the time in space changes, they actually agree with each other. So, because again, the things that I'm missing here, that in this time change, a star of R is just two, because we scale by this. So let me write it here. Because again, just by rescaling of this, it's not enough. So, and doctor of Ar is just two. So AR is just two r. So our curve now satisfies gt in U system of coordinate, it satisfies this equation.
00:17:59.434 - 00:19:21.834, Speaker A: So dt Dt star is two, is gr star minus psi r star. And this is exactly what we wanted, because this is brownian motion scaled by square root of six. So, which means that this is the time change of SLA six. And time change, we already know how we should change time. And now, armed with this claim that if you consider a nice mating of a neighborhood of zero, your solistics doesn't change. This is actually a bit more than the theorem, because, well, let me show you why it implies our theorem. Let me remind you that if we want to see that two SLA six, one run to point B, another run to point B star, they're actually the same SLA up to the same process, up to the time you hit an interval between them.
00:19:21.834 - 00:20:05.404, Speaker A: Okay? So now let us prove the theorem. So, by conforming variance, it's enough to consider the case. When omega is the upper half plane, a is equal to zero, and b and b start at some point. So let's take b is equal to infinity and b, well, we can put it anywhere in the real line. Let's put it on the positive real line, because if it's on the negative, we simply flip everything. Things don't change. So this is our setup.
00:20:05.404 - 00:20:46.324, Speaker A: So we have two SlA's and one is going from zero to infinity standard one. Another is going from zero to x. And then we consider this exciting map zx over z plus x. It's a Mobius map preserving car. Good. Zero is in zero, infinity is mapped to x. So this map actually maps sle six in the upper half plane to sle six, which goes from zero to x.
00:20:46.324 - 00:21:50.304, Speaker A: So five gamma is by definition, sl is from zero to x. And let n union with n star. Well that's, I want it to be c minus the whole positive real line. So t is the first time we hit this positive real line. Then by our theorem, phi of gamma of T has the same law up to the time change gamma of T. That's what we just proved and that's exactly what we wanted. Because this is just sle six from zero to x and up to the time it hits interval from b to b star, which in this case is x to infinity.
00:21:50.304 - 00:22:36.718, Speaker A: It's the same curve and we are done. Okay, so sle six is very special and it's the only thing like that. And it actually was the study of this was the first real use of SLA. So you Ucsle was conjectured and then proven to be scaling limit of interfaces. It was introduced for this reason. But this very locality property allowed Schramm. Well, let me use them alphabetically to settle a long standing Mandelbrot conjectures.
00:22:36.718 - 00:23:22.014, Speaker A: They were able to use this SLE six, which had locality property and for which it was relatively easy to do computations to compute various objects related to brownian motion. For example, you run brownian motion for some time, you look at the outer boundary Mandelbrot conjecture. The dimension of the outer boundary of this is facade. It's true. That's what they proved. And they also settled questions about dimensions of lots of other things related to brownian motion. But it's totally different subject that we are not touching in this course so far.
00:23:22.014 - 00:24:53.914, Speaker A: What I want to talk about instead, for now that there is a special property of another curve, this sle eight thought, and this is called restriction property, which is proven in a very similar way. Suppose that you have two domains simply connected, omega tilde, subset of omega, but their boundaries intersect and a and b are prime ends on these common boundaries. And let gamma be sla eight sought in omega from a to b. And gamma tilde is sla eight sot in omega tilde. So gamma tilde is thought in the small domain. Then the law of gamma conditioned to stay inside omega tilde is exactly gamma tilde. So you to obtain object, to obtain curves in omega tilde curves, all you have to do is to study thought curves in gamma, in omega, and then say, ok, let's look only at them, at the ones which stays inside.
00:24:53.914 - 00:25:14.214, Speaker A: Stay inside of omega Tilde. Amazing. As they would be inside, they would have exactly the law of SlA eight. So ten omega tilde. The proof again, is very similar to what I just described for SLS. So I'll skip it. But this also leads to multiple beautiful constructions.
00:25:14.214 - 00:25:35.902, Speaker A: Sla, just SLA. It is very special. Now, six and eight third. Well, they related. The product is 16. There is also. There are also other related things.
00:25:35.902 - 00:26:47.444, Speaker A: Remember I was talking about two and 16 and so on. So there is a duality, which is due to Bertrand Duplencia was conjectured, sorry, by the Bersano de Palanzia, but was proven by Julien Dubeda and independently by da Pen John. And so Bertrand was physicist and, well, Julian and mathematicians. So let Kappa be at least four. Then I claim that the boundary of Sle Kappa is a version of SLE, but with parameter 16 over Kappa. Well, it's Sle 16 over Kappa Rho and for special Rho. So let me not talk about this, but locally it has the same low SSLA, 16 over kappa, including the dimension.
00:26:47.444 - 00:27:29.064, Speaker A: Okay, so that's, again, it follows from some physics considerations, non rigorous ones. And then rigorously, it was proven using essentially some new martingales for this object by Dapien Jan and Julian Dibeta. Okay, let us now move further. Let me just check one thing here. And of course, I forgot to mention another phenomenon. For Sle. This is reversibility.
00:27:29.064 - 00:28:41.890, Speaker A: That turned out to be a very difficult, which seemed, well, to be one of the first things which we would prove. But the proofs that we know now are very complicated and very technical and conceptual. So what is this reversibility? It's a very natural question. So suppose that you have simply connected domain two boundary prime ends, and you run a select couple from a to b. The question is, is it the same as to run it from bit to a as trajectory? So if you look just at the law of curves on curves, you know that this would be the law on the curves running from a to b that we already know. You already established it. So would this be this law from a to b the same as the law from b to a? Well, for spacefln curves, you kind of can convince yourself that it's not true.
00:28:41.890 - 00:29:34.666, Speaker A: And actually rode and shramp proved it. That for Kappa, big or equal, there is no reversibility, although the house will eventually cover everything, but the trajectories would be rather different. But in the case of simple curves, the answer is yes. And this is due to daiping Zhang. So this was an amazing and very technical result. The result for copper between four and eight is actually, well, it's technically even more difficult, but it relies. Well, it's simple.
00:29:34.666 - 00:30:29.644, Speaker A: Once you know certain connection between SLA caps and what is called imaginary geometry, maybe we'll have time to talk about it a bit in the course. This is a concept invented by Scott Sheffield. And then this particular result was proven by Jason Miller and Scott Sheffield. So this reversibility for Kappa between four and eight. Okay, so that's a seemingly easy question, which turned out to be highly non trivial. But now, at least for now, it's settled. Okay, so far we discussed only one version of SLE chordal SLa.
00:30:29.644 - 00:31:12.470, Speaker A: And of course there are other versions. And let us at least start talking about other version. I promised you radial SLA. So this is, you start at some boundary point or even at boundary prime end. So let me be more general. And you want to describe a curve which goes to some point inside the domain. So chordal was you go between two points on the boundary.
00:31:12.470 - 00:31:59.624, Speaker A: Here you go from a point on the boundary to the point inside the domain. And then you want it to be conformal invariant. So you map it back to the disk, you map your point a to one, and you just consider load the curves which go from one to zero and you want to describe them. Then there is an Anglo Schramm theorem. Remember that if you want conformal invariance and domain Markov property. So, meaning that if you already know the beginning of the curve, then the law of the curve and the remainder of the domain should be the same as the law in the original domain condition. From this beginning.
00:31:59.624 - 00:33:05.782, Speaker A: And then analog of theorem of Schram that this would be described by radial ethyl Kappa. So radial ethyl kappa in D, this point on the boundary end point inside. So point on the boundary one point inside zero. This is random curve in d such that if you consider gt map of the component of zero of d minus gamma of zero t back to d such that. And here you RESCaLE EVerythinG that gt prime of zero is e to the t that this derivative is exactly to the t, then it should satisfy this equation. So you take standard brownian motion, starts at zero, you run it with p, and now you run it on the circle by taking the exponent e to the I b of kappa t. And you write.
00:33:05.782 - 00:33:50.936, Speaker A: And that's. Yeah, I started with chordal standard radial evolution with this driving force. But you see the formulas, ugly, but again, they are ugly, but they more classically. So you start with initial condition g, naught of z is equal to z. And then Gt should satisfy this radial version of LEonarDo evolution. Again, the moment you have other versions of classical deterministic evolution, you have another version of SLA and they will all be related, as we will see in a moment. And then the usual stuff.
00:33:50.936 - 00:34:54.919, Speaker A: For the inverse, this is minus map. So for the map from the disk to the outside of the curve, you have this PD. So this is standard Liovner PD, which we described. Okay, so of course it begs the question, so, okay, we proved all of this stuff for cordon Lucian. Now we probably need to do everything for radial. And probably we would just say that, well, everything is the same because we didn't plan for to spend a long time here. Turns out that it's easy that we can adjust, essentially say that they're the same coordal and trading.
00:34:54.919 - 00:35:54.994, Speaker A: But let's, before I jump through this, let me first say that if you look at the radial sla Kappa, you can describe it in every simply connected domain from a to from a. On the boundary prime end. To be inside the domain, you will simply take the image of a solid kappa in d 10 under the map, which now it's unique, which maps d 10 to omega Ab. And what I say, as in chordal case, of course, it satisfies a mind Markov property and conformal variance. And the proof is identical. So this requires some proof. But now let me at least state this relation between chordal and radial versions of SLE.
00:35:54.994 - 00:36:54.734, Speaker A: So let us take two boundary prime ends. So we take two boundary primants and let's take c inside the domain. Let gamma t be the radially silica from a to c. So you go from a, you go to c and kt, this is closure of omega minus omega t. We should just define, this would be hal of grammati. So the usual thing is for sn chordal case. So in chordal case, the hull is this whole thing.
00:36:54.734 - 00:38:05.032, Speaker A: In the radial case, the hull is this whole thing. So everything, the curve from the point that is followed, and now capital t, the stopping time would be the first time that b is the heat or swallowed by this kt. Okay, so this was, so this is from a to c and gamma Tilde, on the other hand, be chordally silicon from a to b and k t tilde would be twelve and t Tilde would be the first time that c is hit by them. So you see, we run these two guys, this guy till it hits b. So by the way, when kappa is less or equal than four, this means forever. This run till it hits c. Again.
00:38:05.032 - 00:39:08.594, Speaker A: When kappa is less or equal than four, it means forever. Then I claim that you can find two sequences of increasing stocking times which both converge to t and converge to t. T and tilde converge to t tilde such that if you consider the curves gamma t stopped at the time t. So radial curves and gamma t tilde up to time t tilde. So you consider these two families of curves up to time, of course. So you consider these two curves up to the corresponding stopping times. They don't have the same loss.
00:39:08.594 - 00:40:04.274, Speaker A: So it's, no, you cannot just say, okay, it's exactly the same curve. It's not. They have absolutely continuous loss. Meaning that all the properties which hold almost surely for this cold, almost surely for this. For example, you know the dimension of chordal sla, it means that you know dimensional fragile Sla, you know that chordal Sla's are self touching space feeling or simple almost surely, depending on kappa. The same would be true for this gamma up to the stopping time. But again, if you careful with your properties, if your properties are something which do not depend on n, then it turns out that this would be curves with exactly the same properties.
00:40:04.274 - 00:40:45.154, Speaker A: So for example, they would be curves. I don't want to reprove the serum. Remember, it was difficult enough for radial sla the theorem that they would be curves. So this just follows from this theorem. So they have absolutely continuous laws. But of course, time parameterization is also very different because one thing we parameterize by half plane capacity, another we parameterize by derivative at zero. So these are totally different objects, okay, but up to parameterization, everything is the same.
00:40:45.154 - 00:41:41.024, Speaker A: And let me prove everything in one very, very special case when kappa is equal to six. Actually, in this case, not surprisingly, since we have locality, the things are much better. So the loss actually would be the same up to this heating time tnt tilde. Okay, so let's at least start proving my derivative. Managed to finish it today, so it's enough to obviously prove it in the disk. And then we need to select three points. So let's select a to b, e to the, I say to b equal to one, c equal to zero.
00:41:41.024 - 00:42:41.404, Speaker A: So you go from a set to one, all three from a to zero. Now let psi would be this exciting map I one plus z one minus divided by Y minus z. This is our standard conformal map of disk to the half plane, which maps zero to I and one to infinity. And now. But would be one dimensional brownian motion started at the point psi of ei theta. Okay, so now let's describe all cordlessly kappa in d from e I theta to one. So this is the same as the following.
00:42:41.404 - 00:43:38.216, Speaker A: You remember, you want to define it in the disk, but Cordelia doesn't like the disk. It lives in the half plane. How do we map it to the half plane by psi? So you start. So your map G would be a map from the disk minus part of the curve up to u and g naught. Tilde would be just psi of z. You start with mapping with initial mapping psi, but then differential equation would be the same. So this is u derivative of g tilde would be two g u tilde of z minus b of kappa u.
00:43:38.216 - 00:44:32.224, Speaker A: Right, so because b t b tilde of u is your driving function with this initial condition. Okay, and now let's, as usual, define the stopping time for each d. This is the u or the moment that you your gu cease to exist. This is when you hit the brownian motion. Okay, so this is the same as cordlessly in half plane, the same equation, the same t. Just you start with different map because you evolve in different domains. Disk.
00:44:32.224 - 00:45:17.054, Speaker A: Okay, so equation is the same. But let me emphasize it again, that reuse actually defined in d minus kt. They mapped back to h. And again, we have k. And the reason for this is, again, because we consider radial version. Okay, so now let's look at radial acylic kappa in d from e I theta to. Well, not to one, obviously to zero.
00:45:17.054 - 00:46:21.834, Speaker A: And this satisfies the normal. The normal. Leonard? Equation b of capital minus plus b of capital minus gt of z. But here again, you want to start at e I theta. So your g naught would be e I theta times z. Okay, so you have these two guys. And now let's look at this picture.
00:46:21.834 - 00:47:00.914, Speaker A: And we'll probably finish with discussing this picture. So let et would be gt of one. So this is an evolution of one. Now, I want to consider ht of zero, which is the following. I take gt of z, I divide it by e of t so that essentially it goes to the same one. And then I take psi of this. So I do the following.
00:47:00.914 - 00:47:49.724, Speaker A: I take gamma of t, I do gt of divided by et. And then. So this is my b of kt. It would map b of kappa t over et to some point mu t. And so this is not psi, this is hd. Okay, so I want to. So mutiny would be just the image of this.
00:47:49.724 - 00:49:21.610, Speaker A: Okay, and now I want to write down the derivative of this. Well, that's easy, because all I have to do, I have to take this and, well, use chain rule and use the fact that gt of z and gt of one satisfy this equation and that mu t is psi of this all thus settles what I am left with is this exciting equation that ht, which is psi of gt of 00:00 et. It satisfies something which is very, very close to this equation. But there is, well, there is muti here, which we still don't know anything about. There is one plus mut squared, one plus h t squared. But that's the equation for ht. Okay, so now what we want to do, we want to define this linear transformations, a plus b, and essentially.
00:49:21.610 - 00:50:17.544, Speaker A: So what would happen next is that we'll see that after this transformation, the driving force of this guy muti would surprisingly be transformed to a driving force to square root of six dbu. And for other guys, you see, there will be this factor, square root of kappa dbt plus an extra term. So that we will, of course, discuss next time. So essentially the same proof gives you not only SLa six, but all other SLA caps. But for now, let me finish here again, we'll finish the proof next Monday. So let me stop recording.
