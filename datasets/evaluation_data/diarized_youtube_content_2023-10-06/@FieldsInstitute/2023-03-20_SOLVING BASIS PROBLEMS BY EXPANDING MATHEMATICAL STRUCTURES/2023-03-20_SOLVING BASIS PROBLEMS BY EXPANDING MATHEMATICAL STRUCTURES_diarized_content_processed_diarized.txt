00:00:01.880 - 00:00:37.490, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. I think this is working. Let me see. Difference. Ah, okay, so, okay, so let us see where we were. So we were in this class of problems and we came to the problem of gaps. This is a phenomenon, of course, this is the incompleteness phenomena of its quotient structure.
00:00:37.490 - 00:01:35.264, Speaker A: And it should be, if you are studying cohortion structure, you will see that this particular one will be likely to be relevant. So a gap, there is usually thought as a gap of two families, although we are going to go higher to higher dimensions. The phenomenon was first discovered by Hauser of his well known omega one omega one gaps. There are also far analogies between omega one and omega one gaps and Armstrong trees. Somehow concoction was very early, even earlier than Aaronschain is early 20th century, reproved again or republished again in thirties. But here we'll study it. I'll remind you what exact results were.
00:01:35.264 - 00:02:17.094, Speaker A: So we have this notion of homo de jointness orthogonality. I should perhaps point out that a similar. It makes sense looking other context of this theory of. Of gaps, where they are not just a family of orthogonal families of sets, but orthogonal families, say of measures or something of that sort. Anyways, it's a very. This is a notation just to fix that and okay, gaps of pre ideals. Typically you have two orthogonal families there, if you.
00:02:17.094 - 00:03:19.384, Speaker A: If they are trauma, meaning that every element of a is almost UNb, you can close off under finite unions and you're still keeping this property. The families of these finite unions will form ideal. It turn out, actually. And that's how one usually thinks about the gaps of ideals and their p ideals. But when you study the script recombinatorics, context preorders are better because you're avoiding the difficulties recognizing difference between Borrell and PI eleven. So in other words, for general, pre ideals are better, better suited. And also one thing you should keep in mind, that the pre ideal, what is a pre ideal is an open subset of a beta n, or if you like, open subset of beta n minus n.
00:03:19.384 - 00:04:03.062, Speaker A: It's not regular open set. Ideas are typically regular open sets. This is simply open set. Okay, so you have a sequence of such with indexed by a finite set. Recently we started actually to look at the infinite sequences of this also there seems to be a theory there, but anyway, let's look at the separated means that you can dominate all of them with a disjoint intersection. And if you are two of them, set and its complement would do, and it's two. But here is a if you're thinking in the terms of open spaces.
00:04:03.062 - 00:04:31.854, Speaker A: This simply tells you there is a point in the boundary of. Of the inter. There's a point in intersection of boundaries. This is exactly this point in intersection of boundaries. And you take a family of subsets. You will see in a moment, perhaps it's very unnatural. I said, why do you care about this? So in other words, you like to see that you take the members from xi, from.
00:04:31.854 - 00:05:32.764, Speaker A: From gamma I. They should have a finite intersection. So of course there are two cases the most. This is just every pair have finite dissolutionality. But it turn out that actually for an application, you need arbitrary access. As a matter of fact, in the original, where this was discovered, lower bound for the norms of averaging operators, which is essentially another way of saying you have a compact space, you have continuous onto map onto another compact that you like to reverse map, and you like to make it as continuous as possible, and which you can of course measure, which means you need to have a good selection and existence of the very complicated existence. X is the power set of X would tell you that the norm is at least log of n.
00:05:32.764 - 00:06:08.636, Speaker A: So that's how it was discovered. So there are these two cases, if you're interested in classification problem of this, the n star gaps are the atoms. In other words, union of them would get you every gap. So in our two eczema cases, as I said, first case is the most natural. Everybody can think about this. The second one is actually the one. If you want to classify it, you'll see.
00:06:08.636 - 00:06:53.856, Speaker A: I'll perhaps give you some examples. And this is that very well known fact, where Aleph one shows up, like in the case of the arm frame, in a countryman line, is some statement. It says the linear order set, who square is union, Karnaugh chains. There's no other cause in rf one. There's no so rf one shows up here also, even though the structure is highly, highly satirical, meaning the trombos troll invariants can be pushed away from all f one, but this one cannot. And there is a difference between. I mentioned this.
00:06:53.856 - 00:07:30.684, Speaker A: There's a difference between k two and a bigger k. See, Martin actually will not do anything to the house or gap, but it can do something if k is bigger than two. So different. And so a Hauser gap is the. Of course, there was a rusin and Hausdrop constructing a two different kind of a gap, actually using of course, same idea, which is Hausdrop's idea. But if the sizes are assumed that are inclusion, then you will create a household gap. So in other words, this is the omega one omega, one gaps.
00:07:30.684 - 00:08:27.244, Speaker A: So I looked at this and I started to analyze the house the same way you would analyze oncharged trees. And you will get actually a much more complex situation. So I thought maybe we should first study descriptive version of this and turn out there are no housed phenomena there in our no two orthogonal, sigma directed analytic sets. You can always separate them. As a matter of fact, you have a. This is the corollary of two analytic gap theorems for two gaps dichotomies, actually, which we are going to say in the more general form. But even these two dichotomies had some very interesting applications.
00:08:27.244 - 00:09:13.292, Speaker A: Just this little progress there will give you a solving metalization problem in a certain class of spaces. There's a three element basis for complex set representative bare class one functions that this number p is a very interesting. The space p is a poles example. You take the counter tree points, or the tree is insulated. Branches are limits of these points in natural senses. And this is a local compact space. You compactify, that's representable inside where Casman function has this point in infinity, very complicated meaning, a very high character.
00:09:13.292 - 00:10:01.788, Speaker A: This is why it's not metallizable or tell us all. And it turned out, actually, this is the canonical object that every non g delta point contains a copy of this, with this x playing the point of infinity. This is followed from this gap theorem. And there was a beautiful application of this, which we used to solve the dual version of the famous separable caution problem. It's crucial separable caution problem for our dual spaces. Follow not so hard from this gap theorem. Okay, so this is the typical application.
00:10:01.788 - 00:10:38.816, Speaker A: There's a notion of definable that shows up naturally. You see, even in a dual space, it shows up naturally. Okay, and now we go to the general theory, which was developed in a series of paper with Antonio Avilas. Okay, so there's that. If these pieces exhaust the spaces, we call it a dense as well, usually. And there's that ordering. We'll have to spend a little bit time trying to understand this ordering.
00:10:38.816 - 00:11:10.514, Speaker A: So there is a map that maps piece into piece and orthogonal of a piece to orthogonal of a piece. And it's mapped from the index set maps index set. It's not like in the chuki, where you mapping the sets, but index set, it's kind of an analog of the Rudinkistler. And there's equivalence. Of course, this is a quasi ordering. This is equivalence. And in the case of the end gap, which is the most interesting case, you actually have a.
00:11:10.514 - 00:11:58.896, Speaker A: You don't need to look at the separate orthogonals, but there's a global orthogonals. There is, for example, end gaps. If you close it downwards, then you see the end gaps are closed upwards. So in other words, in your classification, if there's a minimal, if you are going to find a basis, it's going to be collection of minimal elements. Some of them are going to be n gaps, some are n star gaps, some are. And here is something that I want to point out, connection topology. When you're doing this double toggle, you're taking the interior of closure.
00:11:58.896 - 00:12:56.214, Speaker A: So a regular, regular open set, and this is typically cornelitic, but it hides no more information as far as the gap structure is concerned. It causes, you know, there's no advantage of going into the corner, you see. So what I want to say is that the way you push through these gaps is this. You're pushing the regular open set to a regular open set and you trace, remember, the regular open set is uniquely determined by its trace dense set, so you're not losing any information, which means that the gap gamma is isomorphic to a restriction of delta. Really isomorphic to a restriction of delta. So this is a very natural one, actually. Very natural reduction.
00:12:56.214 - 00:13:37.684, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, there are also variants between this, but okay, this is the. Anyway, so we are interested in a minimal analytic, if it is minimal in disorder, and we are interested to prove this theorem to see what is behind. I wanted to put this theorem, of course, it's another place where the basis problem is solved. But I want to put it from the point of view of our expansion. I would like to point out what is the expansion you need to analyze to prove such results. And that expansion that could be useful in many other cases.
00:13:37.684 - 00:14:12.614, Speaker A: You remember the case of the levers expansion that were actually solving a problem even for a random graph, not just for rationals, original intentions. So, hoping to have something here. Okay, so there's a very tedious classification problem. So this is something very get stuck like a five. This is 161, dimension three, et cetera, et cetera. So it's very tedious to enumerate them. I'll give you some.
00:14:12.614 - 00:14:52.844, Speaker A: But here is one result that is rather surprising. So you have an infinite family of poets joined open satro beta and Mary Sen, each of them descriptor. We give analytic reasonable. The point is that they are infinitely many parallel design. You take arbitrary three of them and assume that they have a point in the boundary component, no boundaries. Then you can find another point that minimizes, that avoids as many as possible. And 61 is the best possible.
00:14:52.844 - 00:15:36.812, Speaker A: In other words, you can always avoid everybody else except 61. This is the, so that you can solve by basically looking at the gap structure generated by this. You're splitting these into various gap structure. Okay. Okay, now we're interested. Yes, sorry. J is the 61, this number that corresponds to three, sorry, no definition.
00:15:36.812 - 00:16:13.404, Speaker A: It's simply j. Is this best? If I tell you that j of a three, j of a three is 61, then you have a definition for j. Right. Is there for a minimal number, which is, this statement is true for this number. And also, it corresponds to the pieces of the, of the number of gaps in a given dimension. There is, of course, there is even a formula for j. I did not prepare for a slide, because I think why would, why we want to.
00:16:13.404 - 00:17:17.264, Speaker A: But there is a formula, and it's, it's actually not complicated, but it takes probably one slide, one part of this whole slide there with lots of binomials or whatever. Okay. The important thing is, I want to point out that actually that you are, you can take a topological interpretation of this result. And now that's the reason why I'm actually putting this exactly, because I'm interested in this expansion, which I think should have more application because of what I'm hearing from people. Okay, you have this uniformly finitely branching tree, and to the last omega. And now there's a notion of I chain. And I chain in the usual tree without square bracket is simply a chain where the two immediate successor, the next, extends the digit I immediate successor s, comma I.
00:17:17.264 - 00:18:11.794, Speaker A: You see, the first statement will be just I chain. But if you require that you are not allowed to go above I when you are moving from a, from s to t, then you are square bracket I chain. So you see, so I chain has this type I. If immediate successor of s, the it immediate successor of s is extended by t for whatever you are, whenever two s and t, or in particular two consecutive dozen, when I put a two cosecative, that's okay. That's the I chain. And this is the gap. This is the, this is the gap theorem that I proved in 86 for n equal two.
00:18:11.794 - 00:19:04.010, Speaker A: But in this language. And so what is interesting here is so that somehow you are embedding, you are saying that for any analytic gap there is inside, it should be mentioned that these eye gaps do form up, that this recollection of these eye chains for different eyes do form a gap. These are pre ideals, right? Close the Monoton family. Yes, they form a gap. Is not difficult to see. What is interesting about this is, that is this permutation. You cannot embed square beckett I into gamma I, but you must do permutation.
00:19:04.010 - 00:19:41.644, Speaker A: And it's interesting because these are not strong gaps, which means that some of the, for example, some of the gamma I might be rather weak in information, might be countable. For example, remember, in the power set omega module, fin, you can always split two countable families. Two countable families will never form a gap, and one of them might be countable. And this permutation finds one. And if it is gap, there should not be other. So in other words, there is. Epsilon is some sort of measure of a strength of these pieces.
00:19:41.644 - 00:20:42.168, Speaker A: Okay, so there is that w is for a word, but it's really a subtree of that you can think of a subtree. So these are the, these are the pieces of your tree where the first digit is k and the other is not more than a k. This is exactly the force biocondition of I square Beckett chain. And there is that. Now we are coming to the, remember, in any theory, any Ramsey theory theorem for trees, you need to have a saying of which sort of, what's the closure? What is the expanded structure? Which means that the expansion, of course, remember, in the original, for labor case, expansion is a tree. And you have to worry about the mids various passing degrees somehow notion which a strong tree can capture. Capture it.
00:20:42.168 - 00:21:30.064, Speaker A: This is something quite different here. So the closure here, of course, has to be also neat closure. Not surprising, but it's also close under this walk from a lower, lower node to a higher node, lower node t, higher node s, you are walking and not passing degree. And I, one, I, two are at places where the digit gets increased. You take a digit, you go for a long time below it or above up, and then you change. Of course, fortunately, you can have only finitely many changes, and that's, I will say fortunately, because typically you might have a three ethereum, Ramsey, three ethereum, which is useless because the envelopes are too large. They're not bound on the envelopes.
00:21:30.064 - 00:22:05.708, Speaker A: And here, fortunately, there is. Okay, it's generated by. Sorry. F is probably a finite set, right? No, arbitrary set. Arbitrary, yeah, but if you start with finite, then it doesn't stay finite. No, no, no. Closed.
00:22:05.708 - 00:22:36.074, Speaker A: It's closed under, under the noise. No, it could be also finite. Well, downwards, I guess. You take it downwards. Yes, but the point is that, again, you take in the old fashioned mid closure etcetera. But now it is a more closure point is a point where you going from one hole to other. And you are passing these places, you must push them all, because the point is that these I chains can recognize them.
00:22:36.074 - 00:23:18.794, Speaker A: The point that they know, they know these places. Okay, so, and here is the equivalence, this is the correspond to the embedding type in the classical theory. Equivalent. Or, you know, this is equivalent relation. Right? Saying that you must preserve whatever you like. Soft coordinating is this, and also you must preserve, you must keep track when you are changing the digits, when you are increasing digits. I was warned about that.
00:23:18.794 - 00:24:13.304, Speaker A: And now, so now it's how we are going to code an arbitrary set. We want to code them with words. So now the sequence is. So you see, it's fast, because when you concatenate any, if you find a word in the semi group closure, this, the word will know for where it's coming from. You can go back. So that's the idea here. Okay, so this is the, and nowadays, so you see, again, it looks like we are in the category of hell Jewett theorem, but actually not, we are in the category of hell Jewet gaurs, you also shrink, you're allowed to shrink the digits uniformly by one.
00:24:13.304 - 00:24:45.224, Speaker A: And the basic embedding has to preserve this shrinkage. I drew you a picture so that you can actually see what the basic embedding is. So, basic embedding is like a strong embedding of trees, like a strong subtree image of a strong sub tree. This is a strong embedding, if you remember, and this is the, this keeps the current. So there's nothing strange happening. A basic subtree is the image of the original tree inside. Yes.
00:24:45.224 - 00:25:12.524, Speaker A: And x zero set is simply equivalent to x. And this is the picture of analog of a strong sub tree, height three. Remember, on the first lecture, I gave you a picture of the strong tree of height three. Here they are skewed. They should be actually skewed even more. There's no space on that. And you see that the passing.
00:25:12.524 - 00:25:48.924, Speaker A: So in other words, these dots are the nodes in your subtree. The outside thing in the old theory, outside, the moving from one dot on the next is completely free. You can do whatever you want. And here, you cannot do, you must, you cannot go above. The digit that you spit has to be less than, less equal one, less equal two, et cetera. So there's the new, and this is the theorem there. This is the, for every reasonable coloring, as a matter of fact, there is a characterization.
00:25:48.924 - 00:26:43.454, Speaker A: It's mostly measurable, c measurable, whatever in Borrell or analytic, whatever. So, in other words, if you have a type of a finite or infinite set. Then for every partition of a subset that is morphic to it, in a borel or analytical array, there is an embedding of a basic tree. There's an image of this whole tree, so that all subsets are the same piece of partition. The space is there actually a topological ground space, which means that is actually, we have a characterization of the partitions for which this is true, not just consequence. What is interesting here, that this is not a classical one. This is the ultra ultra Ramsay space, which means the space of the u trees.
00:26:43.454 - 00:27:24.426, Speaker A: So in all those people who know, forcing, this in the space is the prickly forcing, but it's insimmonial. You'll say that look like you are, you are using highly axiom of choice here. And I say, no, not really. You don't have a nice space, but you're not using axiom machines. But nevertheless, it would be very interesting to actually build definable range space. And here there's a problem more serious. And what the problem is, is the following.
00:27:24.426 - 00:28:17.100, Speaker A: What we have here is exact analog of the Millikan theorem, but we do not have a hyperactive theorem. So we do not have a product theorem, but we have a homogeneous version. So it will be interesting to see. And this is the finite form. Ok, well, okay, so let us now change the, unless there's a question about the previous thing we changed, I just want to remind you, this was done by hyperlocket theorem and this expansion by well ordering rationales. You get this tree, you get all the theorem there, and you get this. And I should.
00:28:17.100 - 00:29:07.104, Speaker A: Perhaps there's an important problem to do the same thing for any other kind of homogeneous, actually, at least I have a criticization. There's ongoing work and the progress is small, but still something that is interesting. And it does change. If you look at the progress that has been done, the expansion seems to be the corresponding expansion problem, tend to generate the new Ramsey theorem about trees. That's interesting. Okay, we go now to topology. So, topological version for a queue.
00:29:07.104 - 00:29:57.914, Speaker A: Okay, so this is the, you want to now look at the expansion problem. You want again, what is the expansion problem for top q? You have a look at the q as a topological space. There is this, what is this tool? You can either look at the two element subsets of the vietnamese space with this topology, or you can observe that the usual order rational is continuous. So you can take pairs so that the first one is smaller than the second. It's a subset of this. Course, it's a little bit more easier this way, because just to, because remember, expansion poem is saying you want to characterize all relations of all arities. And it's telling you that you will not be able to do that.
00:29:57.914 - 00:30:58.302, Speaker A: It's telling you no way you can do that, because in other words, you will not be able to find a finite expansion that catches you all relations. There's no finite expansion which is going to colonize all relations, obviously, right? Because you can always come up with one more from this list of primages. In other words, you will not be even able to colonize binary relations. Not just. Okay, we'll come to this again. I analyzed in depth of this, because as I mentioned last time, that there should be a basis problem with the infinite basis. And I gave you some example, and this could be one, this could be one where, and I examined the Bon garter's example and it did not quite, did not quite look canonical.
00:30:58.302 - 00:31:46.974, Speaker A: There's another one oscillation map that, that's finer than that which is finer. Remember, if you want to colonize, if you are believing that you have something, you should not be able to get anything finer than that. You have no finer equal translation should be possible to find. And oscillation is the natural one. So two sets oscillate, you throw out the symmetric difference and look how many times they intertwined. Very natural mapping is, and it has this property that it takes all colors, not just on a copy of the rationals. You could take all colors on a descript set.
00:31:46.974 - 00:32:35.494, Speaker A: What is important when you take its closure, if its closure is large, then you're going to get the colors. That's something. And one of the reasons why I believe that there might be a classification here, because when you start playing with this, with a higher dimensional hyman theorem, it's telling you that this seems to be the best, it seems to be high dimensional. Heiman theorem tends to colonize a relations module. This the only it can colonize up to, not, unfortunately not up to the all in our mechanization is coming up to the full copy of the rationals. If you want to less to a sufficiently large number of counterpart derivatives, then this is correct. I mean, theorem will give you that.
00:32:35.494 - 00:32:57.264, Speaker A: In other words, you will not be able to split this module. That. Okay, continuous version. I examine also continuous version. This oscillation map is not continuous. Of course. If I'm not continuous on counter space, then you know what's the next complexity, because it's always f c or g delta, whatever you want.
00:32:57.264 - 00:33:47.404, Speaker A: So the lowest complexity, this is the. So the what I want to say there is no definable analog here correspond to continuous. There's no Borel. It's meaningless to ask for a Borel because it is Borrell and continues to be actually true. And the proof uses hyman theorem in higher dimensions. As a matter of fact, uses Haman theorem exactly in dimension two. And if you go to the measure three, there is bad news.
00:33:47.404 - 00:34:26.964, Speaker A: There's a continuous coloring arrows. There's a continuous coloring which is actually, again, has a similar large number count beneath the resistive. You take those colors up to that, so it goes slower than two k. I must say, when I was preparing this, I could not find formula for how it takes color, how many counterbalance derivatives. You need to catch some colors. But okay, so in continuous version. But interestingly, if you want to, again, want to go to the Eldorado straddle analog, you want equivalence relations, you can classify them.
00:34:26.964 - 00:35:06.086, Speaker A: Remember, recall that El shadow theorem, canonical theorem requires a, or dimension d requires a 2d Ramsey theorem, two dimensions up, twice the dimension up here. Actually, we do not have a Ramsey theorem for dimension four to not even three. But still, you can classify them. It's an interesting situation. There is a classification for this. So in the second theorem here, you do have this. Yes, exactly.
00:35:06.086 - 00:35:27.646, Speaker A: It is not two k. As I said in the previous, not two times k. You take the colors all the way up to two k. If you have a k, many derivatives in the closure, you take the first two k color. It's not two k, but some, maybe, I think log k. I forgot exactly what, but its function goes to infinity. So therefore, you get this, that you take all colors.
00:35:27.646 - 00:35:54.550, Speaker A: It's actually very natural. I mean, I cannot tell you what it is. You take three sets, they have a general position in a tree. Look at the two sets which split from each other longest. You cut there, you get two sets oscillating these two sets. So you see a picture, you have three sets you can think about. This is the intersection.
00:35:54.550 - 00:36:16.524, Speaker A: The intersection is a segment of both. If you like, you cut the place there, you need to cut it to be continuous. If you don't cut, it's not continuous. You need to know. And now you oscillate between, you oscillate. You see how many times these two sets intertwined? That's the function. It's a very natural function, actually.
00:36:16.524 - 00:37:01.942, Speaker A: Okay, okay, there's that well known again, we always, no matter what we do, we go back to Sierpinski. Why is that? Because we go back to, well ordering, right? He simply said, well, there is a well, ordering, you have to deal with it. And you have to deal with it. Except if you look at the r as space topological space, there is distance. And just to avoid probably the connected, et cetera, let's assume that our copy of reality is a contracept. Actually, you have an ordering of the contracept, and you have usually kafka ordering, which is continuous, or it's really not. But it's good to have it, because you want to colonize relations.
00:37:01.942 - 00:37:29.634, Speaker A: We have to mean the relation tells you which. When is it true? When this is true. So, Sierpinski expansion is natural for us to consider, because, remember, how do you. How do you solve expansion problems? Because expansion problems, a classification problem of all quantum examples, you're trying to get all kinds of. Not just one. He got one. So you're copying.
00:37:29.634 - 00:37:49.728, Speaker A: This is all. That's essentially what it is. There's not much of a more philosophy on that. Somebody get a quant example, and you won't say, well, this is it. There's perhaps no more. And let's see, how far is this from truth in this case. So what he.
00:37:49.728 - 00:38:22.564, Speaker A: I want to. I want to point out this particular property of Sierpinski, which is obvious from his proof, et cetera, that he realized all these colors, k factorial, k, manufactorial on any, not only on any. He proved it. Evan Cartel set. But it's actually only set, which is dancing itself. Copy of russian threat. Of course, he did not pointed out this in, because he did not think about today's inertia view.
00:38:22.564 - 00:39:13.694, Speaker A: Okay, so Galvin actually in a series of correspondence with lots of people, I'm sure lots of people are increasing. Richard labor was popular, even called it a Galvin conjecture. And in fact, even in one of the places he was, even he, of course noticed that this context continued hypothesis. But he was hoping that the continuum can be alive, too, that this conjecture doesn't rule what the s canonical means. Basically, relation can be described using these relations there metric well ordering and the usual ordering. And this is actually k equal to ecosystem, unfortunately, with a very large continuum, very large continuum. So it's not.
00:39:13.694 - 00:39:37.634, Speaker A: And now let us look at the cardinals show up. This is the length of the velodrons, naturally. So it's not surprising. So this must show up. So this usual. This is another oscillation mapping. This is oscillation mappings on a various higher.
00:39:37.634 - 00:40:17.174, Speaker A: So what he originally thought is actually not correct. Continue has to be large. So shellach 10th somehow necessary to continue has to be large. And now this is very natural question, is this the place where you stop or there's something more. Maybe there's another series of mappings that pushes this up, whichever is true, I think going to be interesting. Okay, let us look at the boracom electoral version. This is very interesting.
00:40:17.174 - 00:41:14.684, Speaker A: So again, now you are forgetting the ordering. So there's no velodron and you have again the same structure and you have a colonization theorem. This is first, of course, tried by Galvin in the up to dimension three, I think higher dimensional dependent on haplografti theorem. Interestingly, Blas was using haplography theorem, not Millikan, although this is rather immediate consequence of Millikan's theorem. Okay, so you can, in other words, this solves the meaning that if you're interested in just partition of the symmetric code, you have a k minus one, because this is the relationship, this is this other factor of the Sierpinski, just the ratio between the distances and there's nothing else going on. Okay, I guess k equal two. This is one.
00:41:14.684 - 00:41:55.564, Speaker A: So we have actually a constant value, which is actually what Garwin observed. And there is a possibility to classify all these are finite. So these are the previous ones with the finitely many classes. So you write to go to the level of El Dora shadow. And this happened to be actually very tedious, although I think is a very interesting project. Lots of people worked. This is the list from the last paper of litas, lots of previous attempts.
00:41:55.564 - 00:42:56.144, Speaker A: Okay, so Taylor was the first occurrence relations with counter many pluses. There are two, which are two. Count many different slashes, either trivial one or a conclusion given by a distance. And this other, if you go a little bit, if you look at, if you look at dimension two, then you don't have too many. And the dimension higher you can analyze. But it's becoming. I wish this list is more clear, that the invariants could be made more clear, because when I prepare this talk, I tried to find out, people tend, people tend to give me invariants, but they don't offer a way to compute them.
00:42:56.144 - 00:43:41.904, Speaker A: So actually you have to do by hand. I think there should be a very reasonable formula there. Okay, let us now go to the arrow notation. This is a very elegant notation that somehow avoids a lot of writing or notation or quantification switches, etcetera. So let us go to this. By the way, this binomial notation is in scholar. I was thinking who first invented it? And there are lots of people which were, I thought the first place, earlier place I looked at this was, is Colin's paper in that it's Colin, the first one.
00:43:41.904 - 00:44:07.994, Speaker A: You think about them as a combination. So it's simply a substructure, isomorphic. You can also think in terms of embedding. But let us not do it for the moment is not, because not that. Okay, so there is the stand on our tissue. If you cover with land many color, you can shrink it down to tao colors. And is that a Skerbecker notation is interesting.
00:44:07.994 - 00:44:54.642, Speaker A: This was invented by er. Heinleinrado in sixties, purely, as you know, on a theoretical ground for cardinals. Somehow it's interesting. They found it. And here is the, this is what I found in letters, tried to prove or disprove this reformulation of a labor devlin. So this is, you see, they come in pairs, they come in pairs saying this is the minimum. Okay, this is the conjecture of Sierpinski Garvin.
00:44:54.642 - 00:45:29.124, Speaker A: There is a Sierpinski and conjecture by Galvin. You can state this in this way there. Interesting. Galvin Schlach. This is the example, very much close related to the Duchenne Miller, to the, or the linear orderings. Samson uses the similar technology. But interestingly, when I looked at, when I looked at this example, I noticed that this really follow from.
00:45:29.124 - 00:46:18.192, Speaker A: You can find a continuous coloring with this. There's a continuous coloring this on a very strange subset of reels. Or the complexity, there is not the way you assign the color, but where you restrict the set. This is the thing, which I already mentioned you. This is the, I mentioned this because there was a very nice work analog of the laver Devlin for the random graph. But what they had would give you, Ramsay degree of the complete graph. You know, these so called Devlin types are giving you ramsdrive, or complete sub graph of the random graph.
00:46:18.192 - 00:47:31.648, Speaker A: So, in other words, you don't have more complexity if you're looking the complete subgraph, but you have a considerably more complexity for arbitrary graph, even for paths. Even for paths, is very difficult to see. What is the Ramsey degree there? Okay, so I also mentioned recent thing with Dilip. There's again coming in Paris, there is a Szpinski thing, and there is that positive one, which actually, we use large kernels, which is much more general than you, not just for reals, for actually any non sigma discrete metric space, any non trivial space, actually characterization space, where this is true. So, let us examine this a little bit, because this is a two dimensional version, and we like to see for three dimensional what's happening. It turned out that the three dimensional version has something to do with the carnality. So if you look at the k equal Aleph zero, this is exactly Baumgartner's theorem, k plus zero.
00:47:31.648 - 00:48:32.234, Speaker A: This is a two dimensional x is countable. So you have this. If you have a positive dimension k, the reals must be of that cardinality. So if you want to see what is dimension three, this is, this, if you, if, if a Sierpinski is, if a Sierpinski expansion is correct, meaning that three factorials times two factorials is the ranzi number, then there continues at least Alex two. So it's a very interesting situation what's going to happen here. You see, every time, whatever you are doing, whatever, whatever you're putting, you must be inventing, you must be inventing technology for a positive result. You must be inventing a way to realize it or show that Sierpinski expansion is not the right one.
00:48:32.234 - 00:49:34.494, Speaker A: Yeah, that's another way. Okay, so now we go to the beginning. I started with this, and I come back to this, and I want to examine it from this arrow of notation, because I remember what was on the first talk situation. Then you see over the shoulder of these people, which are doing structural Ranzi theory, you formulate it in the way that connection with dynamics is obvious, become obvious. But now you like to understand it, to see what is the why. Why, why you can change which sort of a structure you need, what is the condition for you? And so you need this sort of a Normsey number, which actually showed up in the previous, only not in a structural form, but in a topological form or a carnality form. But this is a structural form.
00:49:34.494 - 00:50:38.274, Speaker A: It's the minimum number for which this is true. So minimal number for which this is true. When you write this, if it exists, it comes with two things. First, that if you take the limit Frazier limit of these, that this Fraser limit, there is a quant example, that there is a current example, that you, in other words, there is a square bracket version of this, in this, some number that cannot be some number, t of a. So what, in other words, we are very much interested in this example, very much interested in this example, because this example is going to give us a representation, otherwise, infinity, Ramsey degree, etcetera. This is Ramsey class, if it is one all standard. And it's very convenient to write this in terms of the limit, not to have a c, to be finite.
00:50:38.274 - 00:51:25.250, Speaker A: So this is the one of the consequences of national. But it's much easier to see, it's perhaps much easier to see it using finite union theorem sample, Heimann theorem. You don't need partridge construction for that. Okay, so that's the way, this is what they do. You fix your class age of this. You take the, you expand it. And now for a purpose of just saying how things, let us assume it is a finite expansion, the finite expansion.
00:51:25.250 - 00:52:21.900, Speaker A: And then this is what you really should be looking at. All the, all the, you have this finite expansion. You can also assume that it's also frise jointly or fries. And you look at what Atomofrisen group does to it, moves it around, is the thing here. I want to point out that it is actually, obviously, a finite finite number. Of course, it may be completely irrelevant for you because this number is simply, you just expanded and you are hoping that this is going to do something for you. It's a finite, this is good sign, but that's the promising thing.
00:52:21.900 - 00:52:58.408, Speaker A: If you prove that this exponential has the Ramsay property, this is what the people do. And then this gives you upper bound, upper bound on the, on the actual degree. So this number is a natural upper bound. So this is finite. That's what we're interested in. And so this is the expansion property, is ordering property. I mentioned you last time simply that you can always find that embedding, no matter how you expand it.
00:52:58.408 - 00:53:23.244, Speaker A: Very natural. Essentially saying, you would like to see that all. You have a guess for this coloring. You like to see that all classes are realized. You really want to witness this relation, that every copy of B uses all classes. So this is, this every copy of b. When you, the copies of a inside b uses all the colors.
00:53:23.244 - 00:53:54.100, Speaker A: So you get equality. If you have both ranzip property, expansion property. So very simple calculus there. And if you want to do reverse, you have to actually, interestingly, you have to a little bit. You're not allowed to use finite many relations. You must allow infinite many possible infinite. The reason is kind of simple.
00:53:54.100 - 00:54:37.294, Speaker A: You see, suppose you get this for every, for every a, you have infinitely many a's. So you, I told you that whatever you are doing, you must be taking into account these examples, these partitions. So we are introducing for each a one, one relation, or for each a finite mean relation. But you are infinitely a. So we are really introducing infinite mean relation. So the ratios that I have in mind examining simply are pieces of these colorings. And the pre compact, what I said, you see, is when you're 62, h is still finite.
00:54:37.294 - 00:55:09.134, Speaker A: It's simply, this number is finite. Let me just say what that number is, that number there. So basically, the automobile freezing group cannot, if you take your finite structure a, you move it back, you look at how many types you are realizing in the expanded structure. This has to be fine, even though, remember, expanded structure has infinite relations. So you might be, potentially, you might be seeing mass there, lots of infinite. But actually, here he's saying that actually you're not going to see. That's a definition of recompound.
00:55:09.134 - 00:55:41.132, Speaker A: And the pointer. And you have reverse scenarios. In this case, you can put this, and you catch this. And there's an interesting proposition here, which comes from a topological dynamics application. Topological dynamics to Ramsey, one of the first one that was found. So, in other words, you really don't need to worry about expansion property. Really, you need to.
00:55:41.132 - 00:56:36.074, Speaker A: Well, you have to be careful here when you say you need to worry, because, remember, this is a classification problem. So, existence of, of the classification doesn't really solve a classification problem. You need to know that if you want to, if you know that if you want to have a deep application, you need to actually work with a given representation. So, exponential problem, you have a solution. But another thing is, as I mentioned for Borel version, for a perfect set, we do have a, we know there is a finite, there is exponential, probably solved, but you don't really know what the solution is. And here is the topological dynamics reformulation, which I mentioned you last time, for a random graph. So, if you take a pre compiled expansion, this action on the space of all such is universal minimal flow, if only if this expansion has Ramsey property.
00:56:36.074 - 00:57:24.164, Speaker A: Expansion property. So we are capturing, you are capturing the finite transit. If you have a finite transient degree, you have a universal minimal flow of that sort. One of the things which is interesting here, that this universal minimal flow is metrisable. And in a beautiful paper by Andy Zuker, he reversed it. It's actually a finiteness of the Randy degree fall from the fact that the, this universal meanwhile force metallizable. So, in other words, what is written there is, if you know, the expansion problem for the phrase structure f is equivalent to the metalization problem.
00:57:24.164 - 00:58:11.754, Speaker A: So, I wanted to point out this, that sometimes these expansion problems can be thought as some sort of a general metalization problem, versions of metroidization problems. This is one of the very interesting cases, and I'm close to an end. So I like to do the references. Last time, last yesterday, I forgot to put you this reference, because I was not, which I did in the slides of yesterday, which I put on the webpage of the institute. So they are going to have references for the previous talk. And here, the one, the rather one here, the reference where you can find more things. So thank you very much.
00:58:11.754 - 00:58:56.458, Speaker A: And there is that. Now we are coming to the. Remember, any Ramsey theory theorem for trees, you need. Need to have a saying of which, sort of, what is the closure? What is the expanded structure? Which means that the expansion, of course, remember, in the original for labor case expansion is a tree. And you have to worry about the mids various sparsity degrees somehow notion which a strong tree can capture it. This is something quite different here. So the closure here, of course, has to be also neat closure.
00:58:56.458 - 00:59:41.586, Speaker A: Not surprising, but it's also close under this walk from a lower, lower node to a higher node, lower node t, higher node s, you are walking interchange, and there's no decrease in sequences. So I could not find infinite anter chain in that. And that's the theory of lipstick trees. So what are these more important? Army trees is a metric theory of trees, I guess, which comes from the somehow motivated or, you know, inspired by the. By the metric theory on ordinals, by vaux on ordinals somehow. Okay? So it's very natural. You see, a tree has its level.
00:59:41.586 - 00:59:58.034, Speaker A: Delta xy is the level of the place where they split. And this other level. So delta is a level, not the node where they split. It's level of the node where they split. So that's ellipsis. Something like ellipsis condition. Right.
00:59:58.034 - 01:00:41.050, Speaker A: Because, remember, in the automatic, you have to reverse. So it's indeed ellipsis. Okay, so that's a map. And here is the definition of an irreducible archery tree, which I call elliptic chain. And there's no decrease in sequences, so I could not find infinite anter chain in that. And that's the theory of lipstick trees. So what are these more important archery trees? It's a metric theory of trees, I guess, which comes from the somehow motivated or inspired by the metric theory.
01:00:41.050 - 01:00:54.704, Speaker A: On ordinals. By vox. On ordinals somehow. Okay, so it's very natural. You see, a tree has its level. Delta xy is the level of the place where they split. And this other level.
01:00:54.704 - 01:01:21.244, Speaker A: So delta is a level, not the node where they split. Level of the node where they split. So that's ellipsis. It's like ellipsis condition. Right? Because, remember, in the automatic, you have to reverse, which is indeed ellipsis. Okay, so that's a map. Here is the definition of irreducible archer tree, which I call Lipschitz tree.
01:01:21.244 - 01:02:17.124, Speaker A: There's a profusion of Lipschitz maps, self maps, partial submaps in order not to cheat on this level, you assume that the map sends a node of a given level to the same level, so that you're not spreading this way. Then you are making this lipstickness artificially artificial. So a level preserving map on uncountable subset can be made lip sheets on a subset, uncountable subset, and they are in. There is a profusion. If you asked, say, these problems in 1960s and your anchor trees in 1934, you will have probably difficulty answering it, or even 1970s. Yeah, but now somehow there are lots of them. Basically any characteristics of the work you put is lip sheets.
01:02:17.124 - 01:02:49.492, Speaker A: You don't need to worry very much. They are there and this is the result, global version of the result. But I'm going to explain you why these two is some sense of what is happening. There is that achievement. There's a chain of lipstick tree, which is a discrete, meaning every lipstick tree has immediate successor. So these convex pieces were either n chains or z. And I one, I, two are at places where the digit gets increased.
01:02:49.492 - 01:03:39.628, Speaker A: You take a digit, you go for a long time below it or above up, and then you change. Of course, fortunately, you can have only finitely many changes. And that's, I would say fortunately, because typically you might have a three ethereum. Ramsey, three ethereum, which is useless because the envelopes are too large, they're not bound on the envelopes. And here, fortunately there is. Okay, generated by. Sorry, no.
01:03:39.628 - 01:04:08.604, Speaker A: Arbitrary set. Yeah. No, no, no, closed. It's closed under the noise. No, it could be also finite. Well, downwards, I guess. You take it downwards, yes, but the point is that again, you take in the old fashioned mid closure etcetera.
01:04:08.604 - 01:05:06.284, Speaker A: But now it is a more closure point, is a point where you are going from leapsheet maps, self maps, partial submaps. In order not to cheat on this level, you assume that the math sends a node of a given level to the same level, so that you're not spreading this way. Then you are making this lipidness artificial. So a level preserving map or an uncountable subset can be made lipschitz on a subset, uncarded subset, and they are in. There's a profusion. If you asked, say, these problems in 1960s and your answer trees in 1935, you will have probably difficulty answering it, or even 1970s, but now somehow there are lots of them. Basically any characteristics of the work you put is lip sheets.
01:05:06.284 - 01:05:44.790, Speaker A: You don't need to worry very much. They are there and this is the result, global version of the result. But I'm going to explain you why these two is some sense of what is happening. There is a chain of lipstick tree, which is a discrete, meaning every lipid tree has immediate successor. So these convex pieces were either n chains or z chains, sometimes n, sometimes z. If you mod out by it, you get a very homogeneous order, meaning there is nothing there. There is actually no surprises could be hidden there.
01:05:44.790 - 01:06:43.382, Speaker A: So generic ordering, no surprises could be hidden there. It's a generic ordering. Okay, and how this is done, you attach an invariant, which I think is interesting by itself, which is this strangely looking collection of sets u of t set fault levels. For there is a control set with a distance set inside. So this is, first of all, if I was smart enough to put a pose there, you would not guess that this has anything to do with this would be a filter. This is unlikely to be filtered. It's very unnatural to expect that this would be a filter, because in arbitrary answer trees it's never filter.
01:06:43.382 - 01:07:26.954, Speaker A: But for Lipschitz tree, these are always uniform filter. And if you assume that these places, you must push them all, because the point is that these I chains can recognize them. The point is they know it. They know these places. Okay, so, and here is the equivalence, this is the correspond to the embedding type in the classical theory, equivalent. This is equivalent solution, right? Saying you must preserve whatever you like. So Alpha ordering is this Tilde, this, and also you must preserve, you must be keep track when you are changing the digits, when you're increasing digits.
01:07:26.954 - 01:08:27.730, Speaker A: I was warned about that. And now, so now it's how we are going to code an arbitrary set. We want to code them. And how this is done, you attach an invariant, which I think is interesting by itself, which is this strangely looking collection of sets u of t set fault levels. For there is a control set with a distance set inside. So this is, first of all, if I was smart enough to put a pose there, you would not guess that this has anything to do with this whole view filter. Like this is unlikely to be filtered.
01:08:27.730 - 01:09:02.414, Speaker A: It's very unnatural to expect that this would be a filter because in arbitrary Armstrong trees it's never filtered. But for Lipschitz tree, these are always uniform filter. And if you assume that the CC productive, then it's actually ultra filter. And now there's a ransom there. Ultra and the Cz productive, non productive cc statements. When you concatenate any, if you find a word in the semi group closure, the world will know for where it's coming from. You can go back.
01:09:02.414 - 01:09:38.462, Speaker A: So that's the idea here. Okay, so this is the, and nowadays, so you see, again, it looks like we are in a category of hell jewelry theorem, but actually not. We are in the category of a shell. Jewett garvers, you also shrink. You're allowed to shrink the digits uniformly by one. And the basic embedding has to preserve this shrinkage. I drew you a picture so that you can actually see what the basic embedding is.
01:09:38.462 - 01:10:07.842, Speaker A: So basic embedding is like a strong embedding of trees, like a strong sub tree image of a strong sub tree. This is a strong embedding, if you remember, and this is the, this keeps the current. So there's nothing strange happening. A basic subtree is the image of the original tree inside. Yes. And x zero set is simply equivalent to x. And this is the, this is the picture of a strong analog of a strong subtree of height three.
01:10:07.842 - 01:10:39.674, Speaker A: Remember on the first lecture I gave you a picture of the strong trio, height three. Here they are skewed. They should be actually skewed even more. There's no space on that skill then it's actually ultrafilter. And now there's a Ramsay there. Ultra and productivity. Nonproductive cc statement is negation to a very natural Ramsey theorem for omega one, actually.
01:10:39.674 - 01:11:23.870, Speaker A: And the most pleasant thing is the last one, that the trees are equivalent, if only water filters are equal. So it's an invariant of the equivalent solution of this strictly increasing map from t as in to t, and vice versa. They are uniform water filters. And now suddenly we have lots of elliptic trees and lots of uniform water filters, and we have to see what is happening. So the first one, you like to shift them. So you assume that they are in a reasonable representation. All of them are isomorphic, such a thing.
01:11:23.870 - 01:12:01.994, Speaker A: And the g shift is simply shifting the, this is the notion here, shifting. Of course, the place where you can g has a partial map. So you simply push the functions up or down, depending what the g does. The most pleasant thing is the last one, that the trees are equivalent, if and only water filters are equal. So it's an invariant of the equivalent solution of this remaining. There's a strict increasing map from t acid to t, and vice versa. They are uniform water filters.
01:12:01.994 - 01:12:38.494, Speaker A: And now suddenly we have lots of elliptic trees and lots of uniform water filters, and we have to see what is happening. So the first one, you like to shift them. So you assume that they are in a reasonable representation. All of them are isomorphic, such a thing. And the g shift is simply shifting the, this is the notion here, shifting. Of course, the place where you can g has a partial map. So you simply push the functions up or down, depending what the g does.
01:12:38.494 - 01:13:28.174, Speaker A: Typically, g is increasing map, increasing map so that you don't mess up, because otherwise you have a problem with the ellipticness. And this is actually one very, very surprising consequence. There's only one tree, and there's only one rota filter. In other words, in the context of PFA, there's only one current example to the Knicks lemma, and there's only one autofilter associated with that. Let's see why. Okay, so if you have a lip sync three and the range of g's in u of t, then the g of T is also lip sync three. So think about these g's are really rudinkiest reductions.
01:13:28.174 - 01:14:32.306, Speaker A: If you have a partial map, then if g is regressive, then there is no inner rose. There somehow, suddenly, there's some sort of very surprising consequence, for there's only one tree and there's only one rota filter. In other words, in the context of PFA, there is only one current example to the Knx lemma, and there's only one auto filter associated with it. Let's see why. Okay, so if you have a lip sync three and the range of g's in u of t, then the g of t is also lip sync three. So think about these g's are really rudinkiesta reductions. If you have a partial map, then if g is regressive, then there is no inner rows there.
01:14:32.306 - 01:15:05.744, Speaker A: Somehow, suddenly, there's some sort of outer power going, and you see that the passing. So, in arrows, these dots are the nodes in your subtree. The outside thing in the old theory, outside, the moving from one dot on the next is completely free. You can do whatever you want. And here you cannot do. You must, you cannot go above the digit that you split. It has to be less than less equal, one less equal to etcetera.
01:15:05.744 - 01:15:44.354, Speaker A: So there's the new. This is the theorem there. This is the. For every reasonable coloring, as a matter of fact, there is a characterization whatever in Borrell or analytic whatever. So, in other words, if you have a type of a finite or infinite set, then for every partition of a substance that is morphic to it, in a Borel or analytical array, there is an embedding of a basic tree. There's an image of this whole tree. So all subsets are on the same piece of partition.
01:15:44.354 - 01:16:31.254, Speaker A: The space. Is there actually a topological rounded space, which means that is actually, we have a characterization of the partitions for which this is true, not just consequence expanding the other ways around expanding mean that f of psi is bigger than g of psi bigger than psi. And this is the set five. There is only, this tells you there is really only one LipsChitz tree. All of them are really simply permutation of each other. Every two lipschitzes two years later are related by a map. So therefore, all these water filters are the same visual permutation.
01:16:31.254 - 01:17:28.544, Speaker A: Okay, now you like to see what is the tree and what is the expanding. The other ways around expanding means that f of psi is bigger than g of psi bigger than pSI. And this is the fact, there is only, this tells you there is really only one Lipschitz tree. All of them are really simple permutation of each other. Every two lipsticks two years are related by a map. So therefore, all these volta filters are the same visual permutation. Okay, now you like to see what is the tree and what is the ultrafilter, right? You like to see, because these are examples that you need to worry.
01:17:28.544 - 01:18:20.268, Speaker A: And also you need to a little bit, you have to say a little bit what's happening with the other arm fir trees. Maybe there is some hidden thing there that is not captured by it. Turn out that actually there is no, the interval is empty, so the shift is immediate success. So this chain was discrete and there is that comparability. That's the reason why I was not able to find antigen in the lipstick tree, in the trees that are working. And this is every arm shade tree is comparable with every lipstick tree. Which means this discrete chain splits ironshrite trees into clouds, into cuts that are taking cuts of the.
01:18:20.268 - 01:19:06.494, Speaker A: So in other words, they are irrelevant as far as the king lemma is, which means the space of the yew trees. So in all those people who know, forcing this in the space is the prickly forcing, but it's insimmonial. Say, well, look like you are using highly axiom of choice here. And I say, no, not really. You don't have a nice space, but you're not using axiom trees. But nevertheless, it would be very interesting to actually build definable runs of space. And here there is a problem more serious.
01:19:06.494 - 01:19:37.754, Speaker A: And what the problem is, is the following. You have to say a little what's happening with the other armchair trees. Maybe there is some hidden thing there that is not captured by it. Turn out that actually there's lipstick tree and vice versa. And others. The reason why they don't have a counterweight chain is lipschitz trees are responsible for that. There's nothing to do with the tree themselves.
01:19:37.754 - 01:20:32.834, Speaker A: And there's no strictly, and I purposely put this 2000, this is the mittaglefleur semester, or Europe chain was discrete. And there's that comparability. That's the reason why I was not able to find antagonism in the, and the lips tree in the trees that are working. And this is the. Every arm shred tree is comparable with every lipstick tree, which means this descript chain splits ironshy trees into clouds, into cuts that are taking cuts of them. So in other words, they are irrelevant. As far as the canic lamps appearing in the purple series paper actually appeared a few years after.
01:20:32.834 - 01:21:40.964, Speaker A: And there's a very deep result of Justin Moore that actually is used in some sense, both of these two theorems are equivalent to this theorem. So there's a ranse phenomena, Ramsey phenomena specific, which is excellent to these two I presented. This was the first time that actually I realized that shellac conjecture must be true because it says versus tree and vice versa. The reason why they don't have a cannibal chain is lipschitz trees are responsible for that. There's nothing to do with the tree themselves. And there's no strictly, and I purposely put this 2000, this is the Mittaglefleur semester or year. I think I forgot where this is appearing in the, in the prep series paper actually appeared a few years after.
01:21:40.964 - 01:22:35.742, Speaker A: And there's a very deep result of Justin Moore that actually is used in some sense. Both of these two theorems are equivalent to this theorem. So there's a Ramsey phenomena, Ramsey phenomena specific, which is equivalent to these two I presented. This was the first time that actually I realized that shellac conjecture must be true because it has a very natural reformulation. And indeed, this was verified by Justin Moore a few years after. This was verified by Justin Moore a few years after. And so this is another Ramde theoretic statement.
01:22:35.742 - 01:23:30.374, Speaker A: We already know by Stepinski or other, that there are very strong examples to the Ramsey theorem for uncountable, but there are no ones of that form. And I should perhaps notice that the fact that U of T is not of the filter is another. The fact that the U of t is of the filter is another statement of this holiday. But we do not have a hyperactive theorem, so we do not have a product theorem, but we have a homogeneous version. So it will be interesting to see. And this is the finite form. Okay, well, okay, so let us now change the, unless there's a question about the previous thing, we change the.
01:23:30.374 - 01:24:06.404, Speaker A: I just want to remind you this this was done by hyperlogic theorem and this expansion by well ordering rationals. You get this tree, you get all the theorem there, and you get this. And I should. Perhaps there's an important problem to do the same thing for any other Kanpur from boolean structure. At least I have a conversation. There's ongoing work. The progress is small, but still something that is interesting.
01:24:06.404 - 01:24:44.580, Speaker A: And it does change. If you look at the progress that has been done. The expansion seems to be the corresponding expansion problem tend to generate the new new Ramsey theorem about trees. It's interesting. Okay, we go now to topology. So, topological version for a queue. Okay, so this is the.
01:24:44.580 - 01:25:31.218, Speaker A: You want to now look at the expansion problem. You want to again, what is the expansion problem? You look at the queue as a topological space. There is this, what is this tool? You can either look at the two element subsets of the vietnamese space with this topology, or you can observe that the usual order rational is continuous. Specific case of that. So, ultra filter, the U of T being ultra filter, is an instance of that, except that you can prove it just from a big assumption like that. The count for chain condition is productive, while here you need a full machinery of proper frosting oxygen. Okay, and now I'm interested in this ultrafilter, what that is.
01:25:31.218 - 01:26:05.270, Speaker A: This also must be something important, right? There's only one object, so there's one ultra filter. Of course, on omega one, it's difficult to analyze because we don't have much theory of ultra filter on omega one. Unfortunately. Maybe one day there will be. I should point out that this rotor filter is unusual, that its definition, it is definable, is a sigma one definable in h. Alf two. And as you know, there is no single one definable ultrafilter in each aleph one.
01:26:05.270 - 01:26:36.574, Speaker A: Remember, this is the difference. So what I want to do is simply push this ultra filter omega one and see what happens. It's a very natural thing, right? There's always such a map. No, a constant mean that is not constant on a member of duffler filter. So images is a non principal filter, as a matter of fact, ultra filter. And now you'll say, well, suddenly you are, what are you doing? You took the canonical object and move this with f, et cetera. First, the first one is smaller than the second.
01:26:36.574 - 01:27:37.714, Speaker A: It's a subset of the square. It's a little bit more easier this way, because just to, because, because remember what expansion poem is saying. You want to characterize all relations of all arithis, and he's telling you that you will not be able to do that, since Ramzi theoretic statement we already know by Stepinski or other. There are very strong examples to the Ramsey theorem for uncountable, but see, there are no ones of that form. And I should perhaps notice that the fact that u of t is not ultrafilter is another. The fact that the U of t is ultra filter is another statement of this, actually a specific case of that. So ultrafilter, the U of T being ultrafilter, is an instance of that, except that you, that you can prove it just from a big assumption that the count for chain condition is productive, while here you need a full machinery of proper frosting axiom.
01:27:37.714 - 01:28:42.934, Speaker A: Okay, and now I'm interested in this ultrafilter, what that is. This also must be something important, right? There's only one object, so there's one ultra filter. Of course, on omega one is difficult to analyze because we don't have much theory of water filter on omega one, unfortunately. Maybe one day there will be. I should point out that this ultra filter is unusual, that its definition, it is the final way you can do that, because in other words, you will not be able to find a finite expansion that catches you all relations. There is no finite expansion which is going to colonize all relations, obviously, right? Because you can always come up with one more from this list of primages. In other words, you will not be even able to colonize binary relations, not just, okay, we'll come to this again.
01:28:42.934 - 01:29:26.044, Speaker A: I analyzed in depth of this, because, as I mentioned last time, that there should be, and as you know, there's no single one definable ultra filter in each aleph one. Remember, this is the difference. So what I want to do is simply push this roof filter on the ground and see what happens. It's a very natural thing, right? There's always such a map. No, a constant, meaning that is not constant on a member of the filter. So image is a non principal filter, as a matter of fact, ultra filter. And now you'll say, well, suddenly you are, what are you doing? You took the canonical object and moved this with effort, et cetera.
01:29:26.044 - 01:30:09.430, Speaker A: You get a mess, right? As a matter of fact not. You've got actually only one rotafilter. First of all, it happened to be selective, meaning it happened to be a Ramsey router filter. Again, you have a Ramsay there, and it's only one modular routing easter, and doesn't depend on t nor f. So in other words, that you have a definable ruling is like task of a selector filter with no parameters. And I like to point out this, because selector filters are usually constructed using the some kernel crystal. The continuum is equal to the continuum.
01:30:09.430 - 01:30:51.258, Speaker A: And here you have other way around. There's some kernel filter. First of all, it happened to be selective, meaning it happened to be a Ramsey ultra filter. Again, you have a Ramsay there, and it's only one modular routing keystroke and doesn't depend on t nor f. So in other words, that you have a definable ruling key filter with no parameters. And I like to point out this, because selector filters are usually constructed using the sum karnataka of the continuum is equal to the continuum. And here you have other way around.
01:30:51.258 - 01:31:32.294, Speaker A: The sum karnatakalistic of the continuum is not equal to the minima value. So curious. Okay. And that I just remind you what the selective is sometimes called. Ramsay is defined in a paper by Choctaw with different names, two papers he needed, for some reason he needed them. So it's every map is constant or one to one. These are the two canonical translation on singleton, the Schroder canonical translation, which we are going to again remind today.
01:31:32.294 - 01:32:21.534, Speaker A: That's why the Ramsey is behind. Somehow it witnesses this phenomenon that equal instruction has to be, there are no many equivalents. And I examined the Bongarthur's example, and it did not quite look canonical. There's another one oscillation map that's finer than that, which is fine. Remember, if you want to canonize, if you are believing that you have something, you should not be able to get anything finer than that. You have no finer equivalent oscillation should be possible to find. And oscillation is the natural one.
01:32:21.534 - 01:32:56.214, Speaker A: So two sets oscillate. You throw out the symmetric difference and look how many times they intertwined. So very natural mapping is. And it has this property that it takes all colors, not just on a copy of the rationals. It could take all colors on a descript set. What is important when you take its closure, if its closure is large, then you're going to get the colors. That's something.
01:32:56.214 - 01:33:48.814, Speaker A: And one of the reasons why I believe that there might be classification here, because when you start playing with this, with a higher dimensional heimant, just remind you what the selective is sometimes called. Ramsay is defined in a paper by choquet with different names, two papers. For some reason he needed them. So it's every map is constant or one to one. These are the two canonical translation on singletons, Dostrado canonical translation, which we are going to again remind today, these are the. That's why the Ramsey is behind. Somehow it witnesses this phenomenon that equal translation has to be a.
01:33:48.814 - 01:34:52.894, Speaker A: There are no many accurations there. Okay, so now I go to the completely different setup, which again will be, which I find also very interesting for various reasons, because it has versions in all parts. It has a borl combinatorics version. There is also version. And also there's a very strong connection with Ramsey expansions. Okay, so now I go to the completely different setup, which again will be, which I find also very interesting for various reasons, because it has reference in all parts. It has a borl combinatorics version, there is also a combutel version.
01:34:52.894 - 01:35:25.792, Speaker A: And also there is a very strong connection with Ramsey expansions. We are going to see, which is very much unobvious at the first sight. So let me just remind you what a Tukey is. For up two partial set, typically directed. There is a map that maps unbounded sets to unbounded set. And then there's that dual form cofinal set to co final set. And there is that a cofinal similarity in the case of a directed set.
01:35:25.792 - 01:36:05.634, Speaker A: This is actually saying that they can be embedded as a partial order set inside a SQL1. Cofinally, this was how Tukey actually came to this. This is actually his theorem. This calculation and ultra filters are. I want to point out the first ultrafilters with high dimensional Heiman theorem tends to colonize relations modulus. The only it can colonize up to not, unfortunately not up to the. Ok.
01:36:05.634 - 01:36:29.954, Speaker A: Our mechanization is coming up to the full copy of the results. If you want to less to a sufficiently large number of counterbalances derivative then this is correct. Will give you that. In other words, you will not be able to split this module then. Okay, continuous version. I examine also continuous version. This oscillation map is not continuous.
01:36:29.954 - 01:36:51.798, Speaker A: Of course. If I'm not continuous on counter space, then you know what's the next complexity. Because it's always f c delta, whatever you want. So the allowance complexity, this is the. So you know here what I want to say. There is no analog. Definable analog here correspond to continuous.
01:36:51.798 - 01:37:32.182, Speaker A: There's no Borel. It's meaningless to ask for a Borel because it is Borrell and continues to be actually true. And not, not. And the proof uses Hyman theorem in higher dimensions. As a matter of fact uses Heman theorem exactly in dimension two. And if you go to dimension three, there is bad news. There's a continuous coloring arrows.
01:37:32.182 - 01:38:16.916, Speaker A: There's a continuous coloring which is actually again has a similar large number count beneath the resistive you take those colors up to that, so it goes slower than two k, something. I must say, when I was preparing this, I could not find the formula for how it takes color, how many counter beddings and derivatives. You need to catch some colors. But okay, so in continuous version. But interestingly, if you want to, again, want to go to the El Rosrado analog, you want equivalence relations, you can classify them. Remember, recall that El Rosado theorem, canonical theorem requires a dimension. D requires a 2d Ramsey theorem.
01:38:16.916 - 01:38:47.706, Speaker A: Two dimensions up, twice the dimension up here. Actually, we do not have a Ramsey theorem for dimension four to not even three. But still you can classify them. It's an interesting situation. There is a classification for this. So the second theorem here, you do have this analog where you counter vendings on the river. Yes, exactly.
01:38:47.706 - 01:39:44.164, Speaker A: It's not two k, as I said in the previous, not two timescale. Rather obvious, because unboundedness is easy just to be infinite. So any map, any one to map is anyone to map for any direct set inside, say even singletons or theta is tuki. And there is that interesting example of how to filter on omega. The three has the maximal Turkey type. And there's a very still open question where there is, where there any other where there is a tuki type of developer that's different from the, from a singleton and different from the maximum. This is a version of p point problem.
01:39:44.164 - 01:40:18.094, Speaker A: P point, which definition I should have included. So these are ultrafilters that are downloads redirected under or counter redirected downloads and ormification. In a sequence of members of you, there is a member of you that is included module of finite in all of them. It's easy to see. This actually is for two partial orders are typically directed. There is a map that maps unbounded set to unbounded set. And then there's that dual form cofinal set to co final set.
01:40:18.094 - 01:40:53.558, Speaker A: And there is that a co final similarity. In the case of a directed set. This is actually saying that they can be embedded as a partial order set inside a SQL1 cofinal. This was how Tukey actually came to this. This is actually his theorem. This calculation and ultra filters are, I want to point out the first ultra filters. And this is the maximal type of a directed set of any size.
01:40:53.558 - 01:42:10.866, Speaker A: This is rather obvious because unboundedness is easy just to be infinite. So any map, any one to map is anyone to map for any direct set inside, say one, singleton or theta is Tuki. And there is that interesting example of autofilter on Omega, the three has the maximal tuquity, and there's a very still open point. This is the notion of Walter Rudin, quite well known, and there was a data again classification result. You can direct a set of a particular size you can classify, and that fact you can classify all partial order set on that side somehow. So maybe this is intelligible, what this things are. But if you, if you have in mind some of the standard partial desert sizes of one famous one carnage and condition, or a Bongart repulse for shooting a club through a statuary set or some other, they are there, they are there.
01:42:10.866 - 01:43:02.540, Speaker A: Day types are there. So that was the one of the classification place in our sub solution of this particular basis problem. And now I said, I like this, because somehow it has very interesting, the script recombinatorics context, equally interesting and maybe even more interesting. Tuki type world developed is different from the, from a singleton and different from the maximum. This is a version of p point problem. P point, which definition I should have included. So these are ultra filters that downloads, redirected under or counter redirected, downloads under all misclusion.
01:43:02.540 - 01:43:28.494, Speaker A: In other words, here are sequence of members of you. There is a member of you that is included, module finite in all of them. It's easy to see that actually it cannot be maximum. So it's a variation on the p point problem. P point. This is the notion of Walter Rudin, quite well known. And there was a data, again, classification result.
01:43:28.494 - 01:43:57.542, Speaker A: You can direct a set of a particular size you can classify and that you can classify all partial set. I forgot exactly what. But it goes, its function goes to infinity. So therefore, you get this, that you take all colors. It's actually very natural. I mean, I cannot tell you what it is. You take three sets, they have a general position in a tree.
01:43:57.542 - 01:44:21.364, Speaker A: Look at the two sets which split from each other longest. You cut there, you get two sets oscillating these two sets. So we see a picture. You have three sets you can think about. This is the intersection. The intersection is of segment of both. If you like, you cut the place there.
01:44:21.364 - 01:44:45.556, Speaker A: You need to cut it to be continuous. If you don't cut, it's not continuous, you need to know. And now you oscillate between, you oscillate. You see how many times these two sets intertwined. That's the function. It's a very natural function, actually. Okay, okay, there's that well known again.
01:44:45.556 - 01:45:58.234, Speaker A: We always, no matter what we do, we go back to Sierpinski. Why is that? Because we go back to well ordering, right? He simply said, well, there's a well ordering and you have to deal with it. And you have to deal with it. Except if you look at the r as space, topological space, there's distance, and just to avoid probably the connected, et cetera, let's assume that our copy of reals is a contracept actually, but you have an ordering of the contra set, and you have usual ordering which is continuous for the set of sizes of one famous one counter chain condition or Bongard repository for shooting club to a statutory set or some other. They are there, they are there, data types are there. So that was one of the classification plays in our solution of this particular basis problem. And now I said I like this because somehow it has very interesting, the scabric combinatorics context, equally interesting and maybe even more interesting.
01:45:58.234 - 01:47:21.576, Speaker A: And this came from that, of course, this is very old that people were looking, actually, the first person to look at this commentary's context was Isabel by simply getting some Borel post it saying that they have different types in the sixties or seventies, but we wanted actually somewhat to take it some more general view on that. So there's a notion of a basic, so there's a partial order set which is actually upward directed, there is a list upper bound, there's a topology on it which is appropriate metric, which has the following two properties that the meet the union map join is continuous. Every bounded sequence has a converging subsequence and dual notion. Every converging sequence has a boundary subsequence. The moment looks curious, like playing with words. As a matter of fact, this topology is unique. You don't need order.
01:47:21.576 - 01:48:46.312, Speaker A: Except that again, when I fixed the slides, people were looking, actually the first person to look at this distributed commentary context was Isbel by simply getting some Borrell posits saying that they have different types in the sixties or seventies, but we wanted actually to somewhat to take it some more general view on that. So there's a notion of a basic so there's a partial order set which is actually upward directed, there is at least upbound, there's a topology on it which is approprometric which has the following two properties that the meet so union map join is continuous. Every bounded sequence has a converging subsequence and dual notion. Every converging sequence has a boundary subsequence. The moment looks curious, like playing weird words. As a matter of fact, this topology is unique, you don't need order. Except that again, when I fix the slides, I should say this topology is uniquely determined by the order itself.
01:48:46.312 - 01:49:38.850, Speaker A: In the following way is that topology sequential convergence, where a sequence is convergent. If it is order convergence or limp soup equal that is missing here, and has this property on one of these, every subsequent has a further subsequent which is bounded. The collection of such a sequence is define your topology. This topology has to be metric if the ordering is basic, if only. So it's a, this is actually observed by a conversation. Framlin, when he heard this notion, because he was writing this section on the book, his books in measure theory. Okay, the examples again, the p point rotary filters are basic.
01:49:38.850 - 01:50:26.736, Speaker A: So when I was rota filter, that ruling was considered basic. And there is a similar deal of compact sets, rather important in the context of description theory, analytic pulse on omega basic. And there is analytics by the order itself. In the following way is a topology sequential convergence, where a sequence is convergent. If it is order convergence or lim sub equal that is missing here, and has this property on one of these, every subsequent has a further substitute, which is bounded. The collection of such a sequence is define your topology. This topology has to be metric if the ordering is basic, if only.
01:50:26.736 - 01:51:20.714, Speaker A: So it's a, this is actually observed by a conversation. Framlin, when he heard this notion, because he was writing this section on the book, his books in measure theory. Okay, the examples again, the p point fluctuators are basic. So when I was filtered, that ruling was considered basic. And there is a similar deal of compact sets, rather important in the context of description, set theory, analytic p ideals on omega basic. And there is analytic equal polish phenomena there. And there's that little thing that you suddenly are saying that the basic orderings have to carnalize relation.
01:51:20.714 - 01:51:59.874, Speaker A: So you have to, the relation tells you which when it is true, when this is true. So Sierpinski expansion is natural for us to consider, because remember, how do you solve expansion problems? Because expansion problem is a classification problem of all context. You're trying to get all code examples, not just one. He got one. So you're hoping this is all, that's essentially what it is. There's no much of a more philosophy of that. Somebody get a co example and you won't say, well, this is it, there's perhaps no more.
01:51:59.874 - 01:52:41.364, Speaker A: And let's see, how far is this from truth in this case. So what he, I want out, I want to point out this particular property of Sierpinski, which is obvious from his proof, etcetera, that he realized all these colors, k factorial, k minus factorial on any. Not only on any. He proved it. Evan Cartel said, but he's actually only said which is. Which is dancing itself copy of russian strength. Of course he did not pointed out this in his paper, because he did not think about today's view.
01:52:41.364 - 01:53:31.450, Speaker A: Okay, so Galvin actually in a series of correspondence with lots of people, I'm sure lots of people are including Richard labor was popularizing, even called it the Galvin conjecture. And in fact, even in one of the places he was, even he of course noticed that this contradicts continue hypothesis. But he was hoping that the continuum can be alive too. That this conjecture doesn't rule what the s canonical means. Basically, evolution can be described using these relations there metric well ordering and the usual ordering. And this is actually k equal to ecosystem, unfortunately, with a very large continuum. Very large continuum.
01:53:31.450 - 01:53:51.414, Speaker A: So it's not. And now let us look at the cardinals show up. This is the length of the load rings naturally. So it's not surprising. So this must show up. So this usual. This is another oscillation mapping.
01:53:51.414 - 01:54:38.774, Speaker A: This is oscillation mappings on a various tire. So I'll show you what he originally thought is actually not correct. Continuity has to be large. So shellach tent somehow necessary to continue has to be large. And now this is very natural question, is this the place where they have a one element basis if they are, unless they are trivial. And now the most interesting thing in all our study, I think, is this automatic definibility. You decided to study Borel directed sets under Tuki reduction.
01:54:38.774 - 01:55:09.994, Speaker A: You have a nice category, but very bad maps. So you are really doing something wrong. At least this is how it feels. You are suddenly saying that their basic orderings have essentially a minimal element. So there's some. So they have a one element basis if they are, unless they are trivial. And now the most interesting thing in all our study, I think, is this automatic definability.
01:55:09.994 - 01:55:40.282, Speaker A: You decided to study Borel directed sets under Tuki reduction. You have a nice category, but very bad maps. So you are really doing something wrong. At least this is how it feels. But it's now actually not so. So for a basic order, if there is any tukey reduction, then there is cofinal map. That is Borel.
01:55:40.282 - 01:56:15.424, Speaker A: The tuk itself is a little bit not borrell, but is what is called immeasurable. So in a worse, because you have to choose some sort of a selection information, actually. So the borel is in this direction. Remember, having a turkey map is the same as having a cofounder map. There are these two dual characterization the niceness, borealness comes from there. Okay, so you see the basic orders, definable ones are closed downwards. So in our rows we are in a good category.
01:56:15.424 - 01:57:04.028, Speaker A: And that when we tested it from the peak point, actually the map is continuous without these two point. If the upper one is, then the lower one is actually there's a continuum map which is actually a monotone with cofinal range. So therefore, p point continuity have no more than continuum. And between this class there is relatively small. Remember, the class of this top, Isbel's top is two to the continuum. This is canal continuum, if you just want to. And now you'll see where is Ramsey? There cofinal map.
01:57:04.028 - 01:57:30.934, Speaker A: That is Borrell. The tuk itself is a little bit, not Borrell, but is what is called strictly measurable. So in a worse, because you have to choose, it's some sort of a selection information actually. So the Borrell is in this direction. Remember, having a turkey map is the same as having a cofounder map. There are these two dual characterization. The niceness, borealness comes from the.
01:57:30.934 - 01:58:17.234, Speaker A: Ok, I remind you again what I told you yesterday, but slightly, just to remind those people, there's another series of mappings that pushes this up, whichever is true, I think going to be interesting. Okay, let us look at the boracom electric version. This is very interesting. So again, now you are forgetting velodrink. So there's no velodrink. And you have again the same structure and you have a carnalization theorem. This is first of course tried by Galvin in the up to dimension three, I think higher dimension dependent on haplography theorem.
01:58:17.234 - 01:59:08.274, Speaker A: Interestingly blasphemous using hyperbolic theorem, not milliken, although this is rather immediate consequence of Milliken's theorem. Okay, so you can, in other words, this was the meaning that if you're interested in just partition of the symmetric code, you have a k minus one, because this is the relationship, this is this other factor of this epinsky, just the ratio between the distances. And there's nothing else going on. Okay, I guess k equal two. This is one. So we have actually a constant value, which is actually what Garwin observed. And there is a possibility to classify all these.
01:59:08.274 - 01:59:32.426, Speaker A: See, this is the, these are finitely. So these are the previous ones with the finitely many classes. So you write to go to the level of air deficient canonical meaning just depend on reordering. The expansion is disordering. I should have put, I should have put less than equal. So the equality is there. Okay, simply a thing to put.
01:59:32.426 - 01:59:53.364, Speaker A: This is just reminding you. You see, the equality is there. In other words, I'm doing what possible people do. You are putting equality under the rug. But actually it's important. Okay, so canonical ratio. This is what there's a positive solution to expansion problem.
01:59:53.364 - 02:00:18.984, Speaker A: Recognize economic correlations. Of course, enumerating is very tedious. This is essentially only. I think that I have a student homework where they actually use computer to get it in dimension three. Very long list. But typically it's a very tedious problem to enumerate them. And when you do, sometimes you get interesting.
02:00:18.984 - 02:00:55.634, Speaker A: And there's one that's relevant for us now for a tuki is this very well known result happened to be actually very tedious. I think is a very interesting project. Lots of people worked. This is the list from the last paper of litas. Lots of previous attempts. Okay, so Taylor was the first gave the first occurrence relations with counter many pluses. There are two, which are two, right.
02:00:55.634 - 02:01:43.334, Speaker A: With a countermeasure clearance clash is either either trivial one or equivalent spatial given by a distance. And this other. If you go a little bit, if you look at. If you look at dimension two, then you don't have too many and the dimension higher you can analyse. But it's becoming. I wish this list is more clear that the invariants could be made more clear, because when I prepare this talk, I try to find out. People tend to give me invariants, but they don't offer a way to compute them.
02:01:43.334 - 02:02:24.994, Speaker A: So I have to do by hand. I think there should be a very. And that when we tested it from the peak point, actually the map is continuous without these two point. If the upper one is, then the lower one is actually there's a continuum map, which is actually a monotone in cofina range. So therefore, p pointer have no more than continuum and 2d pressures. Between this class there is relatively small. Remember the class of this top, Isbel's top is two to the continuum.
02:02:24.994 - 02:02:53.844, Speaker A: And this is canal. Continue if you just want to. And now you'll see. Where is Ramsey there. Where is the expansion? And actually there was. I remind you again what I told you yesterday, but slightly, just to remind those people who were not there, that you can make arbitrary relation canonical meaning just depend on the ordering. The expansion is disordering.
02:02:53.844 - 02:03:23.604, Speaker A: I should have put less than equals for the equalities there. Okay, simply things to put. This is just reminding you. You see the equality. This is a very elegant notation that somehow Evo is lot of writing or notation or quantification switches, etcetera. So, let us go to this. By the way, this binomial notation is in scholar.
02:03:23.604 - 02:03:52.330, Speaker A: I was thinking, who first invented it? And there are lots of people which were, I thought the first place. Earlier place I looked at this was Collins paper. In that the first one, you think about them as a combination. So it's simply a substructure, isomorphic. You can also think in terms of embedding. But let us not do it for the moment. It's not, because, not that.
02:03:52.330 - 02:04:37.240, Speaker A: Okay, so there is the standard. If you color with land, many color, you can shrink it down to tao colors. And there's that. Skerbecker notation is interesting. This was invented by Elv Heinle in sixties, purely, as you know, on a theoretical ground for cardinals. Somehow it's interesting, the word canonical is there, because people, they got stuck with this word canonical, because of this result. Every translation is of the form projection, given by projection on some set of coordinates.
02:04:37.240 - 02:05:26.096, Speaker A: Essentially, that's every translation on that we know that it's actually canonical by the previous one. Except that they had to do a not so trivial classification to figure out what are all these canonical? What are the ones that are important? What are the ones that are essential? Well, just let me just. Maybe that was not so clear. See, from the Ramsay and Skolem, it tells you that if you have two entuples, they are in some order, some relations. If they are equivalent, then no matter which other tuples you come in the same configuration, they are going to be equivalent. This equivalence will not change. And similarly for non electron, except that your relation is not arbitrary.
02:05:26.096 - 02:06:00.714, Speaker A: There's a transitivity. So using transitivity, you can sort it out and get this beautiful result. That's actually what most of these, any of these Aramis expansion problems have at least two sides. In other words, I'm doing what possible people do. You are putting equality under the rug. But actually, it's important. Okay, so, canonical ratio, this is what positive solution to expansion problem.
02:06:00.714 - 02:06:34.386, Speaker A: Recognize economic correlations. Of course, enumerating is very tedious. This is essentially only, I think that I have a student homework where they actually use computer to get it in the version three, very long list. But typically, it's a very tedious problem to enumerate them. And when you do, sometimes you get interesting. And there was one that's relevant for us. Now for a tuki, is this very well known result.
02:06:34.386 - 02:07:29.990, Speaker A: And that's why the word canonical is there. Because people, they got stuck with this word canonical, because of this result. Every translation is of the form projection. Given by a projection on some set of coordinates. Essentially, that's every translation on that we know that it's actually canonical by the previous one, except that they had to do a not so trivial classification to figure out what are all these canonical? What are the ones that are important? What are the ones that are essential? Well, just let me just, maybe that was not so clear. See, from the Aramse and Skolem, it tells you that if you have two entuples, they are in some order, some relations. If they are equivalent, then no matter which other tuples you come in the same configuration, they are going to be equivalent.
02:07:29.990 - 02:08:09.364, Speaker A: This equivalence will not change. And similarly for non electron, except that your relation is not arbitrary, there's a transitivity. So using transitivity, you can sort it out and get this beautiful result. That's actually what most of these, any of these Ramsay expansion problems have at least two sides. The pure Ramsay side will tell you there is a canonical one and the other one where you actually have to do the work to figure out. And we go back again to Nashville. James, not surprising.
02:08:09.364 - 02:08:56.444, Speaker A: I'm just repeating you, and I'm repeating the examples, and I'm repeating the barriers. Aramisi and now the result that you interested in this is this. So what this says is the extension of the airshot result to arbitrary barriers. What I found in letters, try to prove or disprove this reformulation of a labor devlin. So this is, you see, they come in pairs. They come in pairs saying this is the minimum. Okay, this is the conjecture of Sierpinski Garvin there is a Sierpinski and congestion by Galvin.
02:08:56.444 - 02:09:35.064, Speaker A: You can state this in this way. Very interesting. Galvin Schlach. This is the example very much close related to the Duchenne Miller to the linear orderings. Samson uses the similar technology. But interestingly, when I look at this example, I noticed that this really follow from, you can find a continuous coloring with this. There's a continuous coloring this on a very strange subset of reals.
02:09:35.064 - 02:10:12.564, Speaker A: Now, the complexity there is not the way you assign the color, but where you restrict the set. This is the thing which I already mentioned to you. Go back again to Nashville. James, not surprising. I'm just repeating you, and I'm repeating the examples, and I'm repeating the barriers. Aramisi and now the result that we interested in this is this. So what this says is the extension of the ershrod results to arbitrary barriers.
02:10:12.564 - 02:11:03.618, Speaker A: Why is that? Because you see, elder shadow was colonizing equivalence relation on the first example, while they are trying to get on the second notice. On the first one, you had only finitely many possibilities. On the second, you don't, you have an infield many. So the basis problem have a list that is infinite, but it's recognizable. So this is one example where the basis is infinite, although you can specify it. To see how you specify it, there are a few words here which I'm going to again, redo it again. But let me just tell you, internal mean that there's a map f of s, subset of s that's internal.
02:11:03.618 - 02:12:27.096, Speaker A: So like in the other one, you're taking the coordinates that are important and that the uniqueness, meaning that you don't have a two or more colonizing equivalent on the first example, while they are trying to get on the second notice, on the first one, you had only finitely many possibilities. On the second, you don't, you have an infinite many. So the basis problem have a list that is infinite, but it's recognizable. So this is one of the example where the basis is infinite, although you can specify it. Now let's see how you specify it. There are a few words here which I'm going to again, redo it again, but let me just tell you, internal mean that there's a map f of s, subset of s that's internal. So like in the other one, you're taking the coordinates that are important and that the uniqueness being that there are no, that you don't have a two or more solution, meaning that somebody else is coming and finding another invariant and completely different, no being internal.
02:12:27.096 - 02:13:04.894, Speaker A: And that the image, that the image is a barrier freezes. You can, there's no more changes. So again, f of s, subset of s. And if f of s and f of t are different, then they cannot be comparable. Yeah, so in other words, the range is barrier. And this is the result took result. It appeared in a paper with Dilep here also.
02:13:04.894 - 02:14:24.778, Speaker A: And I have some other result of that sort, but this is one that is pleasant to state because it's exactly the connection that I would like to see more in the future. Okay, if you take a select filter filter and you have non principal filter below it, then this is not only that is equivalent to t in the tukey, but it's actually rooting keystone, equivalent to some fubini power for a selective filter. Taking the arbitrary Fubini power lever, Devlin for the random graph, but what they had would give you, Ramsey, degree of the complete graph. In all of these so called Devlin types are giving you Ramsey degree or complete subgraph of the random graph. So in other words, you don't have more complexity if you're looking at the complete subgraph, but you have a considerably more complexity for arbitrary graph, even for paths, even for pats, is very difficult to see. What is the Ramsey degree there? Okay, so I also mentioned more recent thing with Dilip. There's again coming in paradise.
02:14:24.778 - 02:15:13.214, Speaker A: There is this Japenski thing, and there is that positive one, which actually we use large kernels, which is much more general than you. Not just for reals, for actually any non sigma discrete metric space, and in non trivial space, actually characterization space. This is true. So let us examine this a little bit, because this is a two dimensional version, and we like to see for three dimensional what's happening. It turned out that the three dimensional version has something to do with the carnality. So if you look at the k equals lf zero, this is exactly Baumgartner's theorem. K plus zero, this is a two dimensional x is countable.
02:15:13.214 - 02:16:17.904, Speaker A: So you have this. If you have a positive dimension k, the reals must be of that cardinality. So if you want to see what is dimension three, this is this. If a Siepinski expansion is correct, meaning that three factorials times two factorials is the ranzi number, then there continues at least aleph two. So it's a very interesting situation what's going to happen here. Meaning that somebody else is coming and finding another invariant and completely different, no being internal, and that the image, that the image is a barrier freezes, you can, there's no more changes. So again, f of a subset of s, and if f of s and f of t are different, then they cannot be comparable.
02:16:17.904 - 02:17:28.327, Speaker A: Yeah. So in other words, the range is barrier and this is the result, took the result, it appeared in a paper with Dilep here also, and I have some other result of that sort, but this is one that is pleasant to state, because it's exactly the connection that I would like to see more in the future. Okay, if you take a select filter filter and you have non principal filter below it, then this is not only that is equivalent to t in the tukey, but it's actually rooting easily equivalent to some Fubini power. For a selective filter, taking the arbitrary Fubini power don't change its tuki type. They're all the same, no matter how high fubini power. And also, perhaps you're not for, for you not clear what the Fubini power is also going to be in a moment when you see, when I give you a sketch of the proof. Remember, in any lecture there should be some sketch of the proof.
02:17:28.327 - 02:18:08.673, Speaker A: I thought that would be because it's relatively clear the ideas behind this are perhaps not so easy to get towards. It's perhaps not so obvious. Okay, so these are minimal non principal. So in our selective, this Ramzi ultra filters are essential objects. In the two key classifications, they are minimal objects, change its two key type. They're all the same, no matter how high fubi power. And also, perhaps you're not, for you, not clear what the Fubini power is also going to be.
02:18:08.673 - 02:18:46.313, Speaker A: In a moment when you see, when I give you a sketch, sketch of the proof, remember, in any lecture there should be some sketch of the proof. I thought that should be enough because it's relatively clear. The ideas behind this are perhaps not so easy to get towards. It's perhaps not so obvious. Okay, so they are minimal non principal. So in our selective, this rams filters are essential objects. In the two key classifications, they are minimal objects.
02:18:46.313 - 02:19:30.388, Speaker A: Okay, this is how the proof goes. You take v selective u arbitrary by the automatic continuity. This thing with slavic, there's actually a continuous map achiever monotone that maps v to a generating set of view. And you define the mapping that picks a minimal element to the image. That's a map with a counter range. It's also continuous. And now by continuity of a map, there's the basic, you must be, because the range is discrete, you must be constant on a basic open set.
02:19:30.388 - 02:20:11.444, Speaker A: And you take the minimal s with that. That's going to be barrier. So you really have a, so you really have a function on a barrier inside n. In order to have equivalent relation on barrier, you need to colonize this. So it's simply constant value that select, okay, there's a selective version, selective ultra filter, Ramsay ultra filter. I think they should be called generic. They're generic meaning that any statement or any mathematical statement says every infinite set contains an infinite subset with some property.
02:20:11.444 - 02:21:09.604, Speaker A: That infinite set, if you started in order to filter that, they were going to be also filtered. This is what the selected version is. So there is an where the internal map that again referred in the colonization result, there's internal map with this property. And there is a one to one, meaning that it catches the equivalent slation one to one map sizer, which commutes with this. So it gives you back f two if you take a c range, because it's every time, whatever you are doing, whatever you're putting, you must be inventing, you must be inventing technology for a positive result must be inventing a way to, to realize it. You know, you must be, or show that Sierpinski expansion was not, it's not, not the right one. Yeah, that's another way.
02:21:09.604 - 02:22:20.664, Speaker A: Okay, so now we go to, now we go to the beginning. I started with a, with this, and I come back to this, and I want to examine it from this arrow of notation, because I remember what was on the first talk situation. Then you see over the shoulder of these people, which are doing structural Ranzi theory, you formulate it in the way that connection with dynamics is obvious, become obvious, but now you like to understand it, to see what is the, what you can change, which sort of a structure you need, what is the condition for you. And so you need this sort of Ramsey number, which actually showed up in the previous, only not in a structural form, but in a topological form or a carnality form. But this is a structural form if the minimum number for which this is true. So minimal number for which this is true. When you write this, if it exists, it comes with the two things.
02:22:20.664 - 02:23:32.924, Speaker A: First, that if you take the limit Frazier limit of these, that this Fraser limit, there is a quant example, that there is a quant example that you, in other words, there is a square bracket version of this, in this, some number that cannot be some number t of a. So that what, in other words, we are very much interested in this example, very much interested in this example, because this example is going to give us a representation. Otherwise, infinity, Ramsey degree, etcetera. This Ramsey class, if it is one all standard, and it's very convenient to write this in terms of the limits, not to have a c to be finite. So, this is one of the consequences of Neschetlis ro. Okay, this is how the proof goes. You take v selective u arbitrary by the automatic continuity.
02:23:32.924 - 02:24:23.524, Speaker A: This thing with slavic, there's actually a continuous map achiever monotone that maps v to a generating set of view. And you define the mapping that picks a minimal element to the image. That's a map with a counter range. It's also continuous. And now by continuity of a map, there's the basic, because the range is discrete, you must be constant on a basic open set, and you take the minimal s with that, that's going to be barrier. So you really have a, so you really have a function on a barrier inside n. In order to have equivalent relation on barrier, you need to colonize this.
02:24:23.524 - 02:24:52.418, Speaker A: So it's simply constant value that select. Okay, there's a selective version. You see, select ultra filter, ransom filter. I think they should be called generic. They're generic meaning that any statement, or any mathematical statement says every infinite set contains an infinite subset with some property. That infinite set. If you started in order to filter that, they were going to be also interested.
02:24:52.418 - 02:25:31.834, Speaker A: This is what the selective version is, is. So there is an m where the internal map that again referred in the colonization result. There is internal map with this property. And there is a one to one meaning that it catches the equivalent slation one to one map size, which commutes with this. So it gives you back f two if you take a c range. Because it's is anti chain normal inclusion, but also is density mass barrier. That's another consequence of a slight extension of a Nashville theorem due to Galvin.
02:25:31.834 - 02:26:21.334, Speaker A: In other words, modular sticking on the range or a member of you. This is actually a barrier on some side. So this mapping g is a one to one mapping that moves our ultrafilter, you to some ultrafilter, say it must be barrier. That's another consequence of a slight extension of a Nashville theorem due to Galvin. In other words, modular sticking on the range or a member of you. This is actually a barrier on some set. So this mapping g is a one to one mapping that moves our ultrafilter u to some ultrafilter that looks like this.
02:26:21.334 - 02:26:49.488, Speaker A: You take this barrier c, and you restrict it to arbitrary sets in v. But when you think about a little bit, this is actually Fubini power of v. That's actually the right definition of a Fubini power. Remember, Fubini power was this usual fubini formula, u squared U three, etcetera. At the counter stages, you do some arbitrary thing. And indeed you can do arbitrary things, although this doesn't. This is still Geofubini power.
02:26:49.488 - 02:27:10.530, Speaker A: But anyway, this is how you should be thinking for a select ultra filter. Because of the Ramsay of the selective. Because of the selective Nashvilliams, this is an ultra filter. So ultra is responsible. Nashville is responsible that this is an ultra filter. And this is a fubine power. And there's a one to one correspondent.
02:27:10.530 - 02:27:50.902, Speaker A: That's a solution. So that's, I think, a good place to stop because we have another thing going on. You take this barrier c, and you restrict it to arbitrary sets in v. But when you think of a little bit, this is actually Fubini power of v. That's actually the right definition of a Fubini power. Remember, Fubini power was this usual fubini formula, u squared U three, etcetera. At the counter stages.
02:27:50.902 - 02:28:16.098, Speaker A: You do some arbitrary thing. And indeed, you can do arbitrary things, although this doesn't. This is still geofubini power. But anyway, this is how you should be thinking for a selector filter. Because of the Ramsay of the selective, because of the selective Nashvillians, this is an ultra filter. So ultra is responsible. Nashville is responsible that this is an ultra filter and this is a fubine power.
02:28:16.098 - 02:28:59.894, Speaker A: And there's a one to one correspondent. That's a solution. So that's, I think, a good place to stop because we have another thing going on. But it's much easier to see. It's perhaps much easier to see it using finite union theorem, some color hyman theorem. You don't need partridge construction for that. Okay, so that's the way this is what they do.
02:28:59.894 - 02:29:39.446, Speaker A: You fix your class age of this. You take the, you expand it. And now for a purpose of just saying how things, let us assume it is a finite expansion, the finite expansion. And then this is what you really should be looking at. All the, all the. You have this finite expansion. You can also assume that this also fries jointly or, and you look at the water tomofrisen group does to it moves it around, is the thing here.
02:29:39.446 - 02:30:27.014, Speaker A: I want to point out that it is actually, obviously, a finite finite number. Of course, it may be completely irrelevant for you, because this number is simply, you just expanded and you are hoping that it's going to do something for you. It's a finer. This is a good sign, but that's the promising thing. If you prove that this exponential has the Ramsay property, this is what the people do. And then this gives you upper bound, upper bound on the, on the actual degree. So this number is a natural upper bound.
02:30:27.014 - 02:30:55.130, Speaker A: So this is finite. That's what we're interested in. And so this is the expansion property, is ordering property. I mentioned you last time simply that you can always find that embedding, no matter how you expand it. Very natural. Essentially saying, you would like to see that all. You have a guess for this coloring.
02:30:55.130 - 02:31:21.254, Speaker A: You like to see that all classes are realized. You really want to witness this relation that every copy of b uses all classes. So this is this every copy of B. When you. The copies of a inside b uses all the colors. So you get equality if you have both. Ranzi property, expansion property.
02:31:21.254 - 02:31:57.770, Speaker A: So a very simple calculus there. And if you want to do reverse, you have to actually, interestingly, you have to a little bit. You're not allowed to use finite many relationships. You must allow infinite many possible infinite. The reason is kind of simple. You see, suppose you get this for every, for every a, you have infinitely many a's. So you, I told you that whatever you are doing, you must be taking into account these examples, these partitions.
02:31:57.770 - 02:32:35.502, Speaker A: So, we are introducing for each a one relation or for each a finite relation, but you are infinite in a. So we are really introducing infiltrate. So, the ratios that I have in mind examining simply are pieces of these colorings. And the pre compact, what I said is, when you're 62, edge is still finite. It's simply, this number is finite. Let me just say what that number is, that number there. So, basically, the automobile freezing group cannot.
02:32:35.502 - 02:33:06.574, Speaker A: If you take your finite structure a, you move it back, you look at how many types you are realizing the expanded structure. This has to be fine, even though, remember, expanded structure has infinite relations. So you might be potentially, you might be seeing mass there, lots of infinite. But actually, here, he's saying that actually you're not going to see. That's a definition of recompense. And the pointer and you have reversed scenarios. In this case, you can put this, and you get, you catch this.
02:33:06.574 - 02:33:49.264, Speaker A: And there's an interesting proposition here, which comes from a topological dynamics application. Topological dynamics to Ramsey, one of the first one that was found. So, in other words, you really don't need to worry about expansion property, really some sort, you need to. Well, you have to be careful here when you say you need to worry, you know, because remember, this is a classification problem. So, existence of the classification doesn't really solve a classification problem. You need to know that if you wanted, if you know that if you want to have a deep application, you need to actually work with a given representation. So you mean exponential problem, you have a solution.
02:33:49.264 - 02:34:41.894, Speaker A: But another thing is, as I mentioned there, for Borrell version, for a perfect set, we do have a, we know there is a finite, this expansion probably solved, but you don't really know what the solution is. And here is the topological dynamics reformulation, which I mentioned you last time, for a random graph. So, you take a pre compiled expansion. This action on the space of all such is universal minimal flow, if only if this expansion has Ramsay property, expansion property. So you are capturing the finite. If you have a finite Ramsey degree, you have a universal minimal flow of that Sort. One of the things which is interesting here, that this universal minimal flow is metrisable.
02:34:41.894 - 02:35:49.022, Speaker A: And in a beautiful paper by Andy Zucker, he reversed it. It's actually a finiteness of the Ramsey degree fall from the fact that this universal, meanwhile, four is metallizable. So, in other words, what is written there is if not if being that, in other words, the expansion problem for the phrase a structure f is equivalent to the metalization problem. So I wanted to point out this, that sometimes these expansion problems can be thought as some sort of a general militarization problem, versions of militarization problems. This is one of the very interesting cases, and I'm close to end. So I like to do the references. Last time, last yesterday, I forgot to put you this reference because I was not, which I did in the slides of yesterday, which I put on the webpage of the institute.
02:35:49.022 - 02:35:59.934, Speaker A: So they are going to have references for the previous talk. And here the one that here the references where you can find more things. So thank you very much.
