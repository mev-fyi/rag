00:00:00.920 - 00:01:37.286, Speaker A: Good afternoon. Let me read a little more from this article in the almost 20 years ago, April 12, 2007 so the fourth, which says Israel Hoffman's four children are the progeny of an accomplished man. A professor of emeritus of University of Toronto, recipient of the Order of Canada, a member of the Royal Society of Canada, the recipient of many prestigious award in his guild as well, the Israel Halperin Prize supported every five years promising mass researchers. What may have made more of an impression on the four children was growing up in a home where their father arrived at the dinner table. In those days, everyone had dinner together, eager to talk about his work. One summer he was working on eight research projects, and the talk at the table was about progress in all eight. Well, you know, my father was a researcher, but at the dinner table, I think as often as not, I and my two brothers got asked what we were doing in school, but we didn't.
00:01:37.286 - 00:02:12.994, Speaker A: I don't remember hearing so much about my father's work. So it's two ways of proceeding. But anyway, here's a quotation from the older son. I know how engaged he was with the discipline itself. I remember very well the excitement he had when he discovered something new. He said, steve Helper, to find the answer, you now know the absolute truth and that you are the first person to know it. That is really, truly incredible.
00:02:14.854 - 00:02:15.594, Speaker B: Well.
00:02:19.734 - 00:03:05.668, Speaker A: I suppose that the exercises that you're doing, you won't usually be the first person to know how to do it. But still, just finding out, just discovering how to do it, is already, I guess, can be interesting. That was only part of the legacy of the man who died March 8 in his sleep at his midtown home at age 96. Israel Halpern was also a human rights crusader, a one man, letter writing juggernaut that gathered signatures of Nobel Prize winners and prestigious scientists the world over for close to two decades. On behalf of the number of clinical.
00:03:05.716 - 00:03:06.504, Speaker B: Prisoners.
00:03:08.204 - 00:03:46.964, Speaker A: I sometimes helped with that. He had the newsletter, which I could distribute to mailboxes in various university departments. I was quite interested to. I went to the chemistry department once. I was quite interested to notice that they had, as well as a considerable number of professors and faculty members. You could tell from the mailboxes they had over 100, not graduate students, but postdoctoral fellows. So math now has a fair number of postdocs.
00:03:46.964 - 00:05:39.104, Speaker A: One of the scientists that he helped escape from the Soviet Union from prison was Sharansky, and he's a member of the government. He's a member of the member of parliament now in Israel, but he was in the United States for a while, and while he was in the United States, he was awarded the highest honor, civilian honor that is awarded the Medal of Freedom. I could also cite other members of the university. Letters were cool and cogent and respectful. They were also clear about the fact that the recipient might consider changing his or her illegal and abusive practices because the whole world is adamant and passionate in the idea there should be some way. Well, the organization was called the International Campaigns for Human Rights, but it was one man. You don't count a graduate student, one indefatigable man.
00:05:39.104 - 00:06:13.514, Speaker A: Copyright first fought for the release of imprisoned uruguayan scientist Jose Louis Nasser, then soviet scientist Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Nathan Sharansk. Later and later the torture of prisoners in Chile during the Pinochet regime and finally for the release from house arrest Nobel Prize winner on San Suu Kyi permanent by the end he had signed on close to 100 Nobel Prize winning oh, it's.
00:06:15.054 - 00:06:16.514, Speaker B: I could read for this.
00:06:22.974 - 00:07:08.776, Speaker A: Okay, so we can look at a theory and c star algebra and basically these two algebras are Hilbert space operators natural way of looking space operator and k theory is more or less the more or less the complete story for sea travel together. As it happens nowadays, speaker is a very broad subject beyond setting Hilbert space.
00:07:08.840 - 00:07:09.444, Speaker B: And.
00:07:13.784 - 00:07:45.184, Speaker A: Started as I before started this and even Israel Howard involved in early discussions. Well, from the beginning, I guess it was understood that quantum mechanics is best.
00:07:46.484 - 00:07:47.464, Speaker B: Approached.
00:07:51.924 - 00:08:09.074, Speaker A: Using complex numbers rather than real numbers. And the story in brain teaser in a book by George Gavinov 123 Infinity that I was talking about last week, that's a good example too of how.
00:08:10.814 - 00:08:11.554, Speaker B: Important.
00:08:14.054 - 00:08:14.794, Speaker A: The.
00:08:16.774 - 00:08:17.514, Speaker B: Question.
00:08:26.324 - 00:08:29.664, Speaker A: I guess they all.
00:08:30.804 - 00:08:35.548, Speaker B: Very substantial book that's only $15.
00:08:35.636 - 00:08:36.984, Speaker A: I got a copy recently.
00:08:46.864 - 00:08:47.604, Speaker B: But.
00:08:51.264 - 00:10:01.284, Speaker A: So how many people are familiar with the name Richard Feynman? Richard Greek Feynman, very good. Well, he's one of the people who systematically complex mechanical computations really made full use of the cancellation properties of complex numbers. If you have real numbers and truth, one plus minus one is equal to zero. That's already interesting. But if you look at complex numbers and you look at roots of one, the nth roots of the real number one, which is also a complex number, look at the nth roots for any fixed n. But what do you know about the nth roots of one? Say the 10th root, say the 10th roots.
00:10:03.284 - 00:10:09.164, Speaker B: Length. If you look at the complex plane.
00:10:09.204 - 00:10:19.904, Speaker A: Okay, they definitely have to be on the unit circle because you can.
00:10:21.684 - 00:10:22.036, Speaker B: Check.
00:10:22.060 - 00:10:40.244, Speaker A: That properties of the entry value, right. The absolute value is more quickly and it's real. The end power of the absolute value is when we have to be one.
00:10:40.284 - 00:10:46.064, Speaker B: It'S going to have to be the only positive one.
00:10:46.844 - 00:10:50.092, Speaker A: The absolute value of the nth is.
00:10:50.108 - 00:10:51.100, Speaker B: Going to have to be one.
00:10:51.212 - 00:11:26.754, Speaker A: Is there anything anyone else suggests? Another interesting fact about the 10th roots of 10th roots of number one. All right. Okay. By the way, if you look at roots of your polynomials in general, then Galois theory is quite important.
00:11:30.094 - 00:11:30.614, Speaker B: Way of.
00:11:30.654 - 00:12:27.674, Speaker A: Organizing properties about the roots of an equation, right? For every polynomial, real coefficients, we usually take integer coefficients. Galval theory, if you look at the roots of a polynomial, and it's interesting to look at automorphisms, what happens to them under automorphisms of the, okay.
00:12:29.494 - 00:12:29.830, Speaker B: But.
00:12:29.862 - 00:12:36.954, Speaker A: The, this group, the group that you get, the group which takes the.
00:12:48.674 - 00:12:49.050, Speaker B: It'S.
00:12:49.082 - 00:12:50.774, Speaker A: The automorphism of the roots.
00:12:51.274 - 00:12:52.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:52.834 - 00:13:10.764, Speaker A: You look at the algebra, okay? But it's, you don't have to do a lot of abstract algebra. You just look at the roots themselves. So they're say n n roots, n n roots, it's a degree n polynomial, maybe some multiplicity. And you can talk about permutations.
00:13:10.844 - 00:13:11.464, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:12.644 - 00:13:50.232, Speaker A: And you know, it's not interesting to look at arbitrary permutations in general, except in most cases. It is, most cases, you can look at arbitrary permutations, and that's, and that's already all the relations among the roots. Which is interesting is if there happened to be algebraic relations among the roots, okay? And then you look at automorphisms, you have permutations which preserve those relations. So sum of the first and second.
00:13:50.288 - 00:13:55.088, Speaker B: Roots equal to the sum of one.
00:13:55.136 - 00:14:23.824, Speaker A: Roots, then you look at permutations, and that's important. That's the gala. And you can tell from the Galileo group whether the equation is solvable in a certain sense. In the general case, when you get all permutations, if it's degree five or more, then you can't solve the, you can't solve the equation, right?
00:14:25.144 - 00:14:25.536, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:25.560 - 00:14:43.364, Speaker A: But in other words, algebraic relations among the roots are important. And what if you take the root? So that's, and that's what I had in mind with the, looking at nth roots. Look at the nth roots of. Jack, do you want to enlarge on your answer? Or Larry.
00:14:45.584 - 00:14:46.848, Speaker B: You look at the roots.
00:14:46.896 - 00:15:00.044, Speaker A: Of these equations next to the 10th is equal to one. And then what algebraic relations are there among the roots?
00:15:07.864 - 00:15:15.804, Speaker B: Well, okay, that's all of them. And what.
00:15:19.964 - 00:15:41.344, Speaker A: Actually, I'm not so sure about that, because take just square roots, one and minus one, modify them, you don't get anything. Let's say you get minus one it's not so remarkable. And that's always what you got. You got one. You got one. That would be remarkable. That would be another.
00:15:41.344 - 00:15:47.834, Speaker A: Well, of course, any relation would be interesting. We're just trying to see what actually happens.
00:15:51.734 - 00:15:58.398, Speaker B: It's just a symmetric group of ten elements on the point.
00:15:58.446 - 00:16:00.954, Speaker A: You're not saying, you're not saying that you can.
00:16:02.854 - 00:16:03.594, Speaker B: Well.
00:16:05.574 - 00:16:51.214, Speaker A: Actually you look at the, look at the roots of the roots of one. I can think of one relation and that relation is preserved by arbitrary permutation. But I don't, I'm not sure that that's the only way. And I don't know if the Galois group is just going to be all permutation. Obviously, I'm a bit rusted in Galois. Anyway, the fact that Galva theory.
00:16:53.274 - 00:16:53.946, Speaker B: Really.
00:16:54.090 - 00:17:10.350, Speaker A: Goes to town on complex numbers, I think it's. You could even think of it as pertinent to the course. By the way, does anyone want to suggest the relation that I know this.
00:17:10.422 - 00:17:11.154, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:11.734 - 00:17:19.750, Speaker A: Might not be the only one. Okay, only one person really is jumping up. Remind me of your name.
00:17:19.862 - 00:17:26.814, Speaker B: Administration.
00:17:29.143 - 00:17:30.255, Speaker A: How do you spell it?
00:17:30.359 - 00:17:38.367, Speaker B: E a n N A. Yeah.
00:17:38.415 - 00:17:46.483, Speaker A: Okay, I'm not being careful with names. Can you think about relation.
00:17:51.924 - 00:17:57.024, Speaker B: Uh. Is that true? I guess it's true.
00:18:08.444 - 00:18:35.964, Speaker A: Right. But that's not, that's not just a single equation, right? That's a whole bunch of. I think in this case.
00:18:43.884 - 00:18:56.092, Speaker B: X to the five minus one, minus one. Okay.
00:18:56.108 - 00:18:57.988, Speaker A: We're looking at ten through ten fruits of one.
00:18:58.036 - 00:18:58.508, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:58.636 - 00:19:06.224, Speaker A: It's just ten is just an example. But how good. And there are ten of them, right? Yes, we have like.
00:19:09.734 - 00:19:21.034, Speaker B: If you have like a root, if you have like a tension between negative one times, that is also paramount. Okay, but.
00:19:23.214 - 00:19:45.904, Speaker A: You'Re giving me, you want to pin me down. Is anyone familiar with the rhyme of the ancient error? Ship was being followed by.
00:19:49.244 - 00:19:50.464, Speaker B: Large birds.
00:20:16.544 - 00:20:18.484, Speaker A: Then the Bible somehow sent.
00:20:21.864 - 00:20:25.088, Speaker B: To walk.
00:20:25.136 - 00:20:28.554, Speaker A: Around with this bird hanging from the neck.
00:20:29.214 - 00:20:30.394, Speaker B: Large bird.
00:20:30.894 - 00:20:41.726, Speaker A: Anyway, now all across. And also he was his government was. He had to explain to everyone he.
00:20:41.750 - 00:20:45.390, Speaker B: Met what the Helmadi had done, why.
00:20:45.422 - 00:21:18.344, Speaker A: He was had to be carried birth. This is a very boring story. Read the poem. It's amazing. Really amazingly well constructed, but it's just boring. It's amazing how something can be boring and still english. Maybe there's this book, maybe there's this norwegian guide and it's completely ignorant.
00:21:18.344 - 00:21:31.746, Speaker A: Sells very well. But anyway, so that's the, maybe that's.
00:21:31.770 - 00:21:38.014, Speaker B: The story, but.
00:21:40.914 - 00:22:04.434, Speaker A: Archipelago Jordan's nephew.
00:22:11.534 - 00:22:12.754, Speaker B: And what is it?
00:22:22.534 - 00:22:45.054, Speaker A: Okay, what about the fort? What about ten, three. Okay, well it's already getting rid of. Okay, but that's what I was thinking. Now maybe I've misunderstood what someone else might say. Doc, were you thinking of something like that?
00:22:45.514 - 00:22:52.970, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much. Okay, but of course it's not that.
00:22:53.002 - 00:23:18.554, Speaker A: Easy to say something, right? Especially if someone is asking you. Anyway, I'm just, this is sort of how I like to try to explore a phenomenon, this looks interesting, and I'm not that familiar.
00:23:21.814 - 00:23:25.966, Speaker B: So, but it's fine.
00:23:25.990 - 00:23:40.484, Speaker A: When was very much emphasizing the idea that complex numbers cancel in all kinds of ways and that's what's responsible.
00:23:42.264 - 00:23:42.616, Speaker B: That'S.
00:23:42.640 - 00:24:38.794, Speaker A: Basically what quantum mechanics is very much point out, the nature of explained by cancellation and complex number. To a large extent, he would never try to oversimplify the story. Okay, well, in the case of complex numbers, turns out that there's a fairly simple, it's a fairly simple phenomenon for if you look at projections in matrix algorithms and.
00:24:42.054 - 00:24:42.954, Speaker B: Or even.
00:24:46.834 - 00:25:08.654, Speaker A: Or vertical element projections, or unitaries in matrix element, and if you just look at the real numbers are a bit interesting too. So you look at the real numbers and just one projection there is.
00:25:16.294 - 00:25:16.606, Speaker B: Well.
00:25:16.630 - 00:25:57.974, Speaker A: No, there are 20 and 10 and one, so that's a zero dimensional sphere, right? And then if you look at them, if you look at unitary elements, then they're also two plus and minus one. And if you look at two by two matrices reals, and then how many, how many projections are. Yes, well you're talking about diagonal ones, right?
00:25:58.314 - 00:26:01.730, Speaker B: Yeah, they're like, I guess world length. Yeah.
00:26:01.802 - 00:27:39.120, Speaker A: Okay, so zero and then 11001, those will be always diagonal no matter what. How you press the basis, how you change the basis, but you look at the diagonals, non trivial diagonal projections like 10 zero, and then that it's not in the center, if you look at unitary transforms of it, you'll get other production equivalents. And I suppose in fact one of the other ones you mentioned was equivalent to it, right? You look at the other diagonal, zero, zero, one, that's equivalent to 1001 unitarily. Also homotopy, rotate one into the other. Okay, but does this production has rank one? Okay, for the dimension of rain one acting on two dimensional real objects. But what if you just look at this projections which are not diagonal, rank one projection two, not diagonal. I guess if it's two by two, real matrix projection and it's not diagonal, it has to have rank one rank zero, only one rank zero one that's zero, and only one rank two one, that's the identity.
00:27:39.312 - 00:27:40.044, Speaker B: So.
00:27:44.104 - 00:28:11.524, Speaker A: You look at the rank one productions. There are lots of. But matrices have a. Topological. Matrices have a quality, right? Just real two by two real matrices. And cosmologically, it's r to the fourth, right? You look at the versions of the entries. Well, then, if you have any set that has a topological structure, if you look at the set of.
00:28:15.284 - 00:28:16.220, Speaker B: Projections of.
00:28:16.252 - 00:28:44.272, Speaker A: Rank one, what would the, what would it be as a topological space element, what would it be the unit scope? Well, okay, you're giving more, you're giving, you're saying more than it's asked for. You're giving it a metric space structure, too, right? But if you just. Because if you're just looking topologically, that.
00:28:44.288 - 00:28:45.324, Speaker B: Is circle.
00:28:47.464 - 00:29:31.824, Speaker A: And whether, whether you. It has a natural. Okay, so you're saying that if you look at the difficulty saying more than you're asked for is that it might, if you had only said what you asked for as a subset of what you actually said, it might have been correct. But then what you, if you're doing additional computations beyond that, then there's a risk that they may diverge from what you want to say. Okay, but now, maybe, but maybe you're right. Maybe when you put an actual metric. Well, one question would be what metric you put on two by two matrices, right? That's one.
00:29:31.824 - 00:30:14.664, Speaker A: Maybe. Wouldn't it be funny if there were more than one metric, more than one natural metric you could put on two by two matrices for which the rank one projections came out as a circle, as even the unit circle. And of course, it's. Well, why are we talking. It's r to the fourth for the whole thing. Why are we talking about r squared? Well, we're talking about self adjoint elements with trace one, right? Well, that's, that's two, two independent conditions. That reduces the degrees of freedom by two, that reduces the dimension of the space.
00:30:14.664 - 00:30:51.508, Speaker A: It's not even a linear space. Let's say the trace is one minus affine space. You take a joint, I guess it's a three dimensional space. That just means symmetric. And that's a single equation. And trace this fixed number, that's a certain linear function, picking up the hyperplane or plane and taking a plane. And this is just linear.
00:30:51.508 - 00:31:04.834, Speaker A: So far, analysis, not talking metric, and might be more than one way of putting a metric on that hyperplane.
00:31:06.734 - 00:31:07.794, Speaker B: Which makes.
00:31:11.814 - 00:31:16.474, Speaker A: A bit of a curious. That would be curious. I mean, I have a vague memory that might be true.
00:31:18.794 - 00:31:19.534, Speaker B: Environment.
00:31:25.114 - 00:31:57.554, Speaker A: But that's, but that's not, that's a relatively minor point. The main, main fact is ordinary circle topologically. Okay, and, and if you look at two by two matrices that are unitary, I wonder what you get. Well, let's post.
00:32:03.774 - 00:32:05.750, Speaker B: A question, but then.
00:32:05.782 - 00:33:01.584, Speaker A: Let'S look at the complex review of the complex case. If you look at the one dimensional matrices, one by one matrices over the complex numbers, then the productions, again, are just two points, zero and one. And the, on the other hand, the unitaries. Charles, what are the unitaries? Well, we're just looking at various star algebra, right? So real matrices, one, either one by one or two by two. And now we're starting one by one complex matrix, much of star algebra over the complex complex. And the question is, if any star algebra have unitary algebra.
00:33:04.864 - 00:33:06.544, Speaker B: So what, what.
00:33:06.584 - 00:33:13.712, Speaker A: Does the set of unitary. Let's first calculate what the set of unitary elements is and then see if.
00:33:13.728 - 00:33:14.884, Speaker B: It has an actual.
00:33:21.824 - 00:33:58.224, Speaker A: Again, you're putting a metric on it. You're not, you're not. I didn't, I didn't emphasize it, but I was thinking about. And on the other hand, if you're talking about the complex numbers, no one would try to put more than the standard, anything different from the standard metric one. I think for two by two real matrices might be more than one metric one might take. And so it's very interesting to see if it's different on the unitaries. For the projections.
00:34:03.724 - 00:34:05.420, Speaker B: What would be interior.
00:34:05.492 - 00:34:29.914, Speaker A: What would the reductions be on the 2.2 complexities where the same four diagonal lines plus or minus one on the, sorry, zero or one on the diagonal. Now, every projection is either has rank in two by two makers, rather than.
00:34:29.954 - 00:34:34.674, Speaker B: Rank zero, one or two, and as.
00:34:34.714 - 00:34:51.303, Speaker A: Rank one, again, they're not unique. But what would the space of projections be? What would it be as a top line space? And this is now over the complex numbers itself. Complex numbers are.
00:34:55.283 - 00:35:04.263, Speaker B: Fully assumptions, course, and quite pertinent with the.
00:35:06.043 - 00:35:19.952, Speaker A: Basic productions. Anyone want to calculate that? It's the. Yes.
00:35:20.048 - 00:35:20.924, Speaker B: Occupy.
00:35:30.464 - 00:35:32.124, Speaker A: Okay, so you're saying that.
00:35:34.384 - 00:35:34.880, Speaker B: I'm not.
00:35:34.912 - 00:35:58.584, Speaker A: Sure if this is the easy way. You're giving me a statement and a proof. You said a sphere, okay? And when you say sphere, I suppose you mean an ordinary sphere. So when Rishi said a circle, he meant an ordinary circle.
00:35:58.624 - 00:35:59.204, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:59.504 - 00:36:09.914, Speaker A: And now that's a sphere of dimension one. That's a technical word for. And so when you say a sphere, you don't mean dimension one, because that's already been done.
00:36:10.774 - 00:36:12.806, Speaker B: Okay, it's, it's, uh.
00:36:12.990 - 00:36:25.350, Speaker A: You mean it's sphere of dimension, too, right? Sometimes called the two spirit, just to be quite any of you. Well, okay.
00:36:25.382 - 00:36:27.742, Speaker B: So it's two.
00:36:27.838 - 00:36:58.122, Speaker A: Two spheres. And, um, have we seen a two sphere anywhere before? What does potent periodist say for the complex number? For anything? It says if you take the double suspension and you get the same k zero.
00:36:58.178 - 00:36:58.774, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:59.434 - 00:37:49.434, Speaker A: Okay, well, what's the double suspension? What's double? Well, if it's the complex numbers, then you're talking about some topological spectrum of that. You're talking about a point. What's the double suspension of a single point? Well, I guess the single suspension is a line, right? And I mean, if we do it in terms of algebra, if you take the complex numbers, and then you take a look at all functions from the line into the complex one, which vanish at infinity, well, that's a commutative algebra. And spectrum is aligned locally, compliments in space. And now, if you take the suspension of that, what do you get?
00:37:50.694 - 00:37:51.674, Speaker B: It's a.
00:37:53.014 - 00:37:56.754, Speaker A: Functions on the line, and the values are functions on the line.
00:38:00.774 - 00:38:02.074, Speaker B: Yes, Jack?
00:38:04.614 - 00:38:10.394, Speaker A: Well, I was just. Do you want to modify that?
00:38:12.534 - 00:38:13.390, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:13.582 - 00:38:18.650, Speaker A: If you say open rectangle, then yes, the boundary is not included.
00:38:18.682 - 00:38:19.254, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:20.274 - 00:38:33.494, Speaker A: Then that's the same as the whole plane. Okay, so we're talking about the whole plane, and now forget about the boundary of the rectangle. What happens if you just look at the single point of infinity on the plane?
00:38:41.854 - 00:38:43.074, Speaker B: Pretty inspirational.
00:38:46.014 - 00:38:56.794, Speaker A: What's the one point factification of a line? Do you know?
00:38:59.734 - 00:39:00.514, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:07.874 - 00:39:09.894, Speaker A: And when you say spherical.
00:39:11.834 - 00:39:13.094, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah.
00:39:13.994 - 00:39:22.734, Speaker A: Because after all, the plane is two dimensional. Adding a single point, you don't expect that to change the dimension. So I'm probably famous for asking silly questions.
00:39:27.554 - 00:39:28.414, Speaker B: All right.
00:39:30.114 - 00:39:38.950, Speaker A: Well, but weren't we talking about the two spirit out five minutes ago already? And before any was.
00:39:38.982 - 00:39:43.354, Speaker B: Before anyone had mentioned concrete. Right.
00:39:44.894 - 00:40:38.624, Speaker A: Somehow, just talking about two by two complex matrices, two by two matrices of complex entry, asking what the non trivial productions are not. We got the space, which is the one point factification of the spectrum of double suspension of the one by one. Well, that's a very mouthful, but at least it shows that we're getting the same. Did anyone ever have this experience in school?
00:40:39.684 - 00:40:40.092, Speaker B: Some.
00:40:40.148 - 00:41:14.744, Speaker A: Some stage of school, maybe an early stage. You get a looking at a word, and the teacher would say, can you use this word in a sentence? Okay, this is. This is sort of a. And then the next stage beyond that is if you get two words, can you put these two words in the same thing? What we just did, right? The two phrases, one, one of them was non trivial projections on the two.
00:41:14.784 - 00:41:25.494, Speaker B: Sphere, and the other was suspension of.
00:41:27.634 - 00:41:31.214, Speaker A: Double suspension of one by 1 meter.
00:41:31.714 - 00:41:36.254, Speaker B: Now, unit spectrum.
00:41:38.754 - 00:42:29.656, Speaker A: Unit join the point of energy against spherical plate. So what this basically says is that, well, if you look at this double suspension of the complex numbers, this was continuous functions vanishing at infinity on the plane, right? If you add a joint unit to that, you get continuous functions, continuous complex value functions on the two sphere. So what very dest says, oh, but then k zero. Or that when you take away the unit, that should just be z, because.
00:42:29.680 - 00:42:32.000, Speaker B: It should be the same as it is.
00:42:32.152 - 00:42:52.058, Speaker A: Double suspension should be the same as for the. If you add the unit, then you're getting a z squared. But the reason to look at the unit algebra is that's how you define k zero. To define k square, you have to look at the algebra continuous functions on the two sphere.
00:42:52.146 - 00:42:52.894, Speaker B: Okay?
00:42:53.714 - 00:43:56.956, Speaker A: And we're looking and we want to see what? K zero. We want to see k zero. Can we just see k zero by looking at it? It's complex numbers. It's easy to see k zero, right? In terms of projections, it's the class of the unit, right? Do you agree with that, Vincent? Anyone? Anyone want to argue about that? Okay, has anyone ever watched Monty Python? Okay, so one of the episodes is there's an office where you can go to argue, and then you have to pay, of course. And so it shows one guy doing this, and he gets some arguments, moderately satisfactory argument for a while, and all of a sudden the guy at the.
00:43:56.980 - 00:43:57.664, Speaker B: Desk.
00:43:59.444 - 00:44:02.024, Speaker A: Looks at his watch and says, your time is up.
00:44:04.484 - 00:44:05.624, Speaker B: No, it isn't.
00:44:08.724 - 00:44:43.082, Speaker A: And it wasn't. All right, so anybody? We're trying to find the second. There's a unit function on the two sphere as a unit, and that's presumably non zero, l one k zero.
00:44:43.138 - 00:44:43.854, Speaker B: Okay.
00:44:48.394 - 00:45:35.614, Speaker A: That'S the one we have to kill. That's the one we have to throw away because to get the double suspension, which is continuous, vanishing, vanishing at a point, or vanishing at the point infinity, when you join the point infinity length. Well, that's a unit. One unit is the same as the other. It's only one unit. That said, it's not interesting. What we're looking for is a z, which homophied a zero element for double suspension.
00:45:35.614 - 00:45:52.304, Speaker A: And we can find it. To see that, we had to adjain a unit, right? So it's supposed to be a projection puts your projection value, the projection puts your projection in the.
00:46:00.404 - 00:46:02.652, Speaker B: Continuous function from.
00:46:02.708 - 00:47:17.384, Speaker A: S two by two matrices over the complex. And it actually should be not nothing to do with the function constant equal to the identity matrix or constant equals in the matrix. I guess the actual unit in the commutative algebra, obviously, in the commutative algebra, there's only one production. The continuous functions on the two sphere, the only, just like the complex numbers themselves, the only projections are zero and one. And so if it's a, since the two spheres connected, the only function with value zero and one which is continuous is either constant zero or constant one. We have to go to two by two makers. And the question is, so the constant function 10 zero, that would be the unit of the community contained in the two by two matrices.
00:47:25.404 - 00:47:44.056, Speaker B: All right, but, well, it helps to.
00:47:44.080 - 00:48:23.904, Speaker A: Look at things in two ways. I think it always helps to look at things in two ways as an expression. There are two sides to any story. Not always true, but sometimes people say that when it's not even true, but anyway, or it's debatable. In this case, it's not debatable. It's a little difficult to see what we're looking for here. But here, continuous matrix line function called the two string.
00:48:23.904 - 00:48:51.134, Speaker A: If you want a production, that means at every point the value is a production. That means, but it's a mean, it's an oriental, but we know what the productions are. Look, it's projections in two by two matrices over the complex numbers protect non trivial productions. So it's points on a two sphere. So we're looking at a two sphere. That's what we're looking at.
00:48:51.914 - 00:48:52.814, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:53.714 - 00:49:12.426, Speaker A: And if it were the constant constant equal to this, well, it would be irrelevant what the space was constant functions on two sphere. That's if you're looking at non constant functions. Well, there aren't that many non constant continuous functions from a sphere into a.
00:49:12.450 - 00:49:13.174, Speaker B: Sphere.
00:49:15.574 - 00:49:23.446, Speaker A: Of the homotopic, how many are there? Well, it's a well known subject to study.
00:49:23.510 - 00:49:24.114, Speaker B: Right?
00:49:27.094 - 00:49:55.394, Speaker A: You have something homotopic to just a single value. That map, you might say, has degree zero. There's a map with degree one, identity map. Okay, f two to s two. Z goes to z. I don't know what we should say, but variable. But that's the trouble with notation free analysis.
00:49:55.394 - 00:49:57.642, Speaker A: Sometimes you don't know what to call something.
00:49:57.818 - 00:49:59.494, Speaker B: Well, we just call it the variable.
00:50:02.634 - 00:50:55.154, Speaker A: Well, okay, I think, I think the point is taken. We have, there's a, you could, you could actually map, instead of taking, instead of taking the identity map from s two into s two, you could flip, okay, if you have s two sitting in three space, you can flip it, right? You take, any point goes towards multiply by minus one. Every point goes to its opposite degree. That's a different degree, right? That's degree of eigen, is that right? I hope I got that right. Anyway, there are whole lot of, whole lot of integers, possible functions for s squared and v squared. They seem to be labeled in a significant way by integers. Well, that's.
00:50:55.154 - 00:51:50.474, Speaker A: That sounds like k zero, right? The second generator, k zero of the suspension, is, or k zero of the double suspension, that's the same as k zero of the complex number. So we're looking, we're looking for a subgroup of k zero isomorphic to z. We're looking at c of s squared, the algebra unit joint. Well, it looks as if we just take all the different maps, s two, into s two with different degrees, and that would give us different key elements. The whole discrete one parameter family being indexed by. Well, that's how it goes. And so this is a, this is a sort of turning bot periodicity into real life, recognizing it in real life.
00:51:50.474 - 00:52:07.460, Speaker A: It turns out that this is. You're going to actually prove this. You more or less have to repeat the general proof of bot periodicity. We want to actually prove that this entity map from s two to s.
00:52:07.492 - 00:52:08.064, Speaker B: Two.
00:52:10.404 - 00:52:37.804, Speaker A: Generates them together with the class of unit, generates k zero of these algebra. Well, that's good, something for an essay to struggle with. The calculation. In this case, the identity map is the second generator of k zero.
00:52:39.584 - 00:52:39.920, Speaker B: Of.
00:52:39.952 - 00:53:16.654, Speaker A: The unit level, and a whole chapter in the textbook, at least, I hope at least one whole chapter in the textbook. This is not just bioch periodicity in action, it's actually black periodicity. This is it. And except we're just. I'm just saying it. I'm just saying that this is true.
00:53:19.514 - 00:53:20.254, Speaker B: And.
00:53:22.114 - 00:53:28.734, Speaker A: By the way, if we look at unitaries, this is projections. If you look at unitaries, is here.
00:53:33.034 - 00:53:34.418, Speaker B: One thing but one.
00:53:34.586 - 00:53:44.874, Speaker A: The baptiste says that k zero is the same as k zero double suspension, but also says the same as k one suspended suspension.
00:53:45.294 - 00:53:49.342, Speaker B: Okay, so let's see if what we can.
00:53:49.478 - 00:53:51.166, Speaker A: We didn't get as far. No, we did.
00:53:51.190 - 00:53:51.822, Speaker B: We did.
00:53:51.958 - 00:54:06.474, Speaker A: K one of the suspension, suspension of the complex numbers is continuous functions on the circle, right? If you join a unit, there's continuous functions on the line, vanishing infinity, complex value functions. But then if we're joining continuous functions.
00:54:06.854 - 00:54:07.594, Speaker B: On.
00:54:15.454 - 00:55:12.134, Speaker A: It turns out that it's continuous functions from s one to the complex numbers. And we've already identified what the unitaries are. That's another circumference, but it's the same. Looking at k one of s, it's a very similar picture. We're looking at functions from s one to s one or maybe two by two matrices, too. Maybe in this case, to get an interesting one, to get a non constant one, we don't need to go to matrices s one to s one. We can take, I mean, we can take the function, we can take the identity map from s one to s one, or we have all the other maps, right? It's like analogous to degree you have even circle.
00:55:12.134 - 00:55:34.536, Speaker A: You can take z to the end z goes to z, where z goes to z squared, and so on. You get a copy of z here, too. But it's a question of proving that this is going. Is k one the suspension of the complex numbers, is that actually equal? Is that actually equal to z?
00:55:34.600 - 00:55:41.448, Speaker B: The same question here is the double suspension of complex numbers.
00:55:41.616 - 00:56:15.588, Speaker A: Is that equal? In both cases, we film the what the generator is. We essentially answered the question. To all intents and purposes, we've answered the question. But it's actually this question. And this question is easy to go back, but it's not deep to go back and forth the same. Whether this is generated by the identity band here, or whether on this instead generated by the identity band here. It's six of one, half a dozen of the other.
00:56:15.588 - 00:56:46.894, Speaker A: But it's a whole year to prove $100 for the book. However you measure it, it's unlimited worry. Okay, let's come back to this. It's the main point in the course. There are other points I like to think of, other important points.
