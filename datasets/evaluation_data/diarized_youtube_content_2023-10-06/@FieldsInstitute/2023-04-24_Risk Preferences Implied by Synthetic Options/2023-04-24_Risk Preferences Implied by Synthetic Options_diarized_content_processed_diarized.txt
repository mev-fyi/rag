00:00:00.920 - 00:00:14.034, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. I mean, actually, questions, I don't have enough slides for 40 minutes. Like questions during would be like, amazing. I was, I was assuming questions during. So my slides are kind of calibrated to that. And so I don't know. Please feel free to interrupt me.
00:00:14.034 - 00:00:51.942, Speaker A: So this is joint work with, with Stefano Gigi. Oh, and we're, so we're thinking about, we're trying to think about risk preferences. Our goal is to understand investor preferences over different return states. Right? So really trying to think about like marginal utility across different states of the world indexed by aggregate stock market returns. So this is all going to be about index options. And we want to think about are investors averse to crashes? Are they averse to high volatility? Is risk aversion high and bad times? Basically things that might induce curvature in marginal utility deviations from the CAPM. Really? And often you answer these questions with index options data.
00:00:51.942 - 00:01:37.846, Speaker A: And so past work that's extraordinarily well known finds that options on the s and p 500 earn negative Capm alphas, right? So this is true across strikes. You see it for out of the money puts, that's the put premium. We see that straddles earn negative alphas. That's really the variance risk premium. And out of the money calls also appear to be overpriced. And this is true with and without delta hedging that options just sort of robustly, historically have earned these negative returns. And the standard interpretation of this, and I'll show you a simple way to formalize that, is that this implies that marginal utility is convex, right? One simple way to see that is that options have convex payoffs and they're overpriced relative to the CAPM.
00:01:37.846 - 00:02:10.932, Speaker A: And so that means that marginal utility needs to be convex. Kind of has to line up with that convexity in the options. And so how do you interpret that? Well, these negative alphas, this overpricing implies you could look at it as a variance risk premium that investors really hate. These high volatility periods that shove you out into the tail could be crash aversion, could be time and state dependent risk aversion. So, like habit formation could potentially generate something like this. And so, past work finds options are overpriced. We're going to say two things in this paper.
00:02:10.932 - 00:02:43.466, Speaker A: Number one is that does not appear to be true anymore. It hasn't been true for ten or 15 years. Number two, synthetic options. So if you dynamically replicate an option, right, you just do like the black Scholes kind of replication, really just delta hedging those options never earned low returns. It never looked like they were overpriced relative to the CAPM. And so we're going to argue in interpreting this that the overpricing of options was due to segmentation. And as that segmentation declined, the overpricing disappeared.
00:02:43.466 - 00:03:19.634, Speaker A: And so it is again, no longer the case that we actually even see a deviation between the returns on true options and the returns on synthetic options. Another way to say that is delta hedge returns have gone to zero. And so, you know, options historically were expensive. Why was that? It could be because of convex preferences, right? It could be that people really hate these extreme states. Maybe they really hate crashes. If that's true, then what you should expect is the synthetic options should also earn negative returns if they're able to pay off in those crash states. And we show that they are.
00:03:19.634 - 00:04:01.468, Speaker A: But they actually, when you have large events, when you have 2008, when you have Covid, for that matter, so 2020, even in 1987, synthetic options actually pay you a lot of money in these bad states of the world. And so if investors hate those bad states of the world, if that's why we think options are expensive, then the synthetic options should also be earning low returns. We don't observe that. So true. And synthetic options are 93% correlated. They span very, very similar states economically, but they have very different returns. You can think about that as really either implying that there's an arbitrage, or that these markets are segmented and the disappearance of the spread.
00:04:01.468 - 00:04:47.682, Speaker A: And in particular, the fact that the true option returns have converged to what the synthetic options say is consistent with the story about segmentation. And so that's what we want to show you. That's what we're going to try to work through. And so what I'm going to do is first develop some theory just to help kind of like structure this a little bit, to look at what true options can tell us. Like when you look at stock options, you look at returns on options on the S and P 500. What does that tell us about investor preferences, about marginal utility across states? And then two, what if I'm looking at synthetic options instead? What can that potentially tell me across states of the world? And so we'll have that. And then based on that, I'll give you empirical results on synthetic options.
00:04:47.682 - 00:05:17.202, Speaker A: One, showing that they actually work in crashes very well, so you can replicate an option that pays you in a crash. Another way to say this is that if you're so, like, another way to say that is that stop loss orders work for the S and P 500. Right. If you put in an order that says when the market falls by 5%, sell, that's going to work. It might miss by a percentage point here or there, but the jumps just aren't big enough for that to seriously go wrong. But empirically, historically, what we're going to show is that that works.
00:05:17.298 - 00:05:17.974, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:34.934 - 00:06:19.444, Speaker A: So the way that we will formalize it is simply going to be that. One way to think about it is that at the end of the day, the key theoretical point that you need is that the marginal utility that prices stocks that we kind of think of as being like this big broad market that everybody has access to is not the same marginal utility that prices options. That'll be one way to say it. I think more specifically, the thing that we're thinking about is that for a long time, most investors, retail and lots of institutions, could not sell options. They could buy options all they wanted, but they had no way to really sell them. And so then where the segmentation, the specific friction that we'd be thinking about is that friction that it was hard to sell options. And so what that's going to cause then is.
00:06:19.444 - 00:06:41.600, Speaker A: So the model that we have in our minds is we probably need to write it down more formally. Imagine take all these stock investors, half of them want to buy options at a fair price. Half want to buy, half want to sell. And on average they're indifferent, they don't care. But then we say, look, you're not allowed to sell options. What's going to happen? Buyers are going to buy. The market makers then have to bear all that, or the dealers have to bear all that.
00:06:41.600 - 00:06:54.954, Speaker A: Risk drives the prices way, way up. They then look overpriced as that segmentation is reduced, which it has been over time, and I'll talk about that. Then you expect that the friction goes away and you should expect the mispricing to go away.
00:06:56.174 - 00:06:56.954, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:11.014 - 00:07:44.128, Speaker A: Beliefs are going to be 100%. You can bake in beliefs that. And so we could, one way to say this is that both the, when I talk about marginal utility and the paper is actually more careful than I'll be here. When we talk about marginal utility, really what we're talking about is any deviation between the state prices and the objective probabilities. Absolutely. And the point is simply that should be, you know, I'll show you kind of when it should be consistent, but broadly, that should be consistent between stocks and options. And, you know, there are ways to break that link.
00:07:44.128 - 00:08:15.482, Speaker A: These things are not identical. The synthetic options are not, absolutely not identical to the true options. And so you can break that. But if they were, for example, then, you know, you have to, their prices have to line up regardless of whether it's beliefs versus preferences. So I'll show you one, the black scholes replication economically works surprisingly well, I think, better than we understood. Two, the synthetic options. So these replicated options have actually really never earned a premium.
00:08:15.482 - 00:08:52.554, Speaker A: They've always appeared to be well priced by the CAPM. So they've never really had an alpha. Three, the true options used to have an alpha. There was a big alpha until say the early two thousands. And since then it's been essentially gone. And their average returns have converged to the returns that we see on the synthetic options. That convergence lines up both with the time where we see the segmentation decreasing and also the time when a lot of other premia were going away, that a lot of these kind of standard strategies that used to work, so like value momentum, post earnings announcement drift, a lot of these like quant type strategies stopped working at about the same time that you stopped making money from writing index options.
00:08:52.554 - 00:09:36.210, Speaker A: Okay, so here's our setup. So we're going to say that this m between two dates t and t plus j is the ratio of marginal utilities that can also capture these differences. And any distortion in probabilities will also be baked into this m. And what we want to measure is how that marginal utility, this m, varies with the market. So I'd like to understand really this function that that marginal utility could depend on a lot of stuff, but we're going to project it down non linearly onto the market and ask how this m bar varies. Right. So is it a linear function of the market? That would be the capm.
00:09:36.210 - 00:10:16.736, Speaker A: Is it a nonlinear function of the market? There might be curvature if there's preferences over volatility or over crash states or something like that. Again, this is over some horizon. J, we'll be thinking about monthly returns, but you're going to actually sometimes see that j just be a day. And that's, that distinction is going to matter. We'll say that an asset is priced by this marginal utility between two dates t and t plus j if our pricing equation holds. So for this specific return over this specific period, I'm not claiming that this holds for everything, right? We are not claiming that markets are complete. We are not claiming that everything is correctly priced, not even necessarily claiming that it works every day.
00:10:16.736 - 00:10:50.944, Speaker A: So we just, this is, and this is just a definition. This is just a definition, not even saying what it's true for yet it doesn't actually require you to trade. You could think stocks are correctly priced without trading them all the time. I'm not trading right now. The reason I'm not trading right now isn't simply that I'm busy, it's that I don't actually think I'd benefit from it. As far as I'm concerned, everything's basically correctly priced for me. I see no deviation here that I can take advantage of.
00:10:50.944 - 00:11:16.264, Speaker A: Again, no assumption of complete markets might hold for some horizons, but not others. You might think this is a, you know, we never think this is literally true. I might think it's a good approximation at some horizons, say a month, I might think it's a bad approximation at a horizon of like a millisecond, right. That these can work better at some, some ranges than others. And again, it might not hold for all investors. Right. If there's segmentation, then some investors might perceive a mispricing that they can't take advantage of.
00:11:16.344 - 00:11:17.004, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:23.334 - 00:11:44.020, Speaker A: I don't have a model, so whose model? Different M's are segmentation. Right. If the M's, if two people disagree. So, I mean, I guess if they could, if they just. They can certainly. So since markets are not complete, they can disagree about states that are unspanned. Right.
00:11:44.020 - 00:12:14.814, Speaker A: But the claim would just be that if two people can trade this thing, if there is no arbitrage, then they've got to agree on that. If they don't agree on that, there should be trade happening. Something should be happening. Certainly people could have misspes. Again, people could have misspecified beliefs, and that'll show up in the m. If you have some view about probabilities, there's no difference between that. Like mathematically there, it's 100% identical to having some other difference in marginal utility.
00:12:14.814 - 00:12:44.394, Speaker A: So suppose we observe returns on true options. What do we, what do they tell us about marginal utility? So I have some return ro, the return on an option doesn't matter what its strike is, doesn't matter what the. So it's a, it has maturity j. But it doesn't matter what the strike is, doesn't matter if it's a put or a call. Whatever it is, I can project its return on the market. So I'm just orthogonalizing it with respect to the market. Just taking out the capm beta.
00:12:44.394 - 00:13:25.384, Speaker A: There's no delta hedging here, there's no structure to this. You can always do this. And that's just, I get this orthogonal part of the return. If it is the case that the option is priced by marginal utility, and the market is priced by marginal utility over this horizon, t to t plus j. Then what I get is really a regression. I get a regression of marginal utility on the market where the slope is going to depend on the average return on the market, and on this nonlinear function of the market return. Right? An option is just a convex payoff in the market where the coefficient involves the alpha on the option.
00:13:25.384 - 00:14:30.414, Speaker A: Why does the alpha show up? This is just using ols formulas. The coefficient here is the covariance divided by the variance. And so this Alpha is just simply the covariance of that return with the pricing kernel. Why do we do this? One reason to do this is this is just pointing out something that's well known, which is that anytime you look at average returns or estimating pricing model, you're really just projecting marginal utility onto the return space that you're looking at. But it also says, why do we interpret options in the way that I've been talking about this negative alpha? If I have a negative alpha on options, which is what we observed historically, then that implies that marginal utility is convex in the market return, precisely because this return on the option is convex in the market return. So if I have a negative alpha, then I have a positive coefficient here, and marginal utility is convex. Under the CAPM, the alpha would have to be zero, since all alphas are zero, and we would have marginal utility that is linear in the market.
00:14:30.414 - 00:15:14.052, Speaker A: So this is a plot of what you actually get if you look at traded options on the S and P 500. These are 5% out of the money puts that you buy once a month and hold to maturity. So we just roll them over once every four to five weeks. Looking at the actual historical return on the stock market and the historical alpha on put options on the S and P 500. This is that projection. This is projecting marginal utility down onto the market return and onto the option return, and we get that dotted line. That dotted line is weird, right? So the dotted line certainly has to be convex due to the fact that we have a positive or a negative alpha.
00:15:14.052 - 00:15:56.444, Speaker A: What's surprising is actually that it's so convex that it is non monotone. It's not unique to us, right? This is a standard result to find non monotonicity in the pricing kernel. We're just showing kind of the simplest, like dumbest possible way to see that, right? Just a single alpha is enough to get that non monotonicity. But lots and lots of other work has studied that. So what about a synthetic option? So a synthetic option really is just some return where what you're doing is you're constructing a dynamic portfolio on the market. Right. Where I have some weights, Delta s that can vary day by day.
00:15:56.444 - 00:16:21.732, Speaker A: They can vary day by day. They can only depend on stuff that I know as of data s, right. I can't look into the future to choose my weights. So black Scholes is one set of weights, right? Any option pricing model is going to tell you the weights like Hestan would tell you what the weights should be. You get a set of weights and that gives you a return. Some rs, right? That after I put these weights in I'm going to end up with an rs that will be a return. And what you can show is the following.
00:16:21.732 - 00:16:59.240, Speaker A: If so, now I don't have the option, right. I have this rs, I don't have to worry about options anymore. The condition that we need is now a little different. Instead of assuming that both options and the market are priced, all that I need is the market itself is priced. But instead of it being priced over the month I need it to be correctly priced every single day. Because of the fact that I'm dynamically hedging every day, I'm changing these weights every single day. If it is correctly priced every single day, then when I do that this RS is also going to have to correctly be priced every single day and we end up with the same regression.
00:16:59.240 - 00:17:31.736, Speaker A: And so I can also look at a synthetic option return and come to the exact same conclusions that I would with the true option. I look at its alpha. If its alpha is negative I'm again going to conclude that there is convexity in marginal utility with respect to the market return. Now there is a residual, there's an epsilon. Unspanned risks are going to live inside of that. If you think that unspanned risks are priced, that creates a little wedge here. That is a big long conversation.
00:17:31.736 - 00:18:55.202, Speaker A: The paper goes into that deeply. It's not something I'm going to get into today because there are things that we do, we do a bunch of things to deal with that. But that is not something I'm going to talk about at the moment. We have these two choices. I could look at true options, I could look at synthetic options. What's the difference? When I look at true options I need a relatively, my old assumption which is that I need to think that those options are correctly priced with respect to that marginal utility for the investor that I care about over a one month horizon, please. Absolutely.
00:18:55.202 - 00:19:43.778, Speaker A: And so that's a better way of saying what I was saying when I was talking about the epsilons, which is that another way of putting, another way of putting that, like a third way of saying this is that we are thinking about. I want to think about marginal utility where, like, I want you to imagine a figure where I'm plotting, I have the return on the market over the month, and I want to think about plotting marginal utility with respect to that. And it does something, maybe it's linear, maybe it's curved, who knows? And I'm not saying anything about the path, right. I'm assuming the path isn't assuming it's too strong in this presentation. I'm not talking about the path in the paper. We talk for exactly the reason you just said that. We are summarizing it just with the return over the month.
00:19:43.778 - 00:20:38.860, Speaker A: If investors really deeply care about the path over the course of the month, then you potentially have some daylight between the two. When I show you some figures, I'm going to try to argue that I think that economically that doesn't feel right, but it's 100% an issue. And again, the paper like spends a lot of time on this. So the assumption that we need is for the true options, we need to only assume that they're priced over the course of the month. And all that orthogonality stuff will not be an issue for the true option, because their return is a function only of the cumulative return on the market over the course of the month, because there's nothing happening day by day. If I know the return over the month, that is a sufficient statistic for the return on the option. The concern with options is they might be segmented, they might not.
00:20:38.860 - 00:21:25.872, Speaker A: When we talk about misspecification or who are we talking about? Again, the worry is that this broad investor, this equity investor, might not be the person whose marginal utility is pricing options. That is our concern. Synthetic options potentially resolve that. They do have the one issue that you now are building in the daily variation. You need pricing to be accurate every single day. And so if there are frictions, if there's like so certainly in your data, if there's bid, ask, bounce or stale prices, that will create a problem. But also, if you just think that at that frequency, the market is actually not priced correctly relative to some representative investors marginal utility, then you can't really look at those synthetic options anymore.
00:21:25.872 - 00:21:54.514, Speaker A: And then also, this is really kind of as close as I get to this point, that you might span somewhat different states with the synthetic options versus the true options that you might be missing jumps, you might be missing unspanned volatility. And I think that's the. There are things that we do to try to handle that. That is the. That's like a major. It's a major question here. But what we can say is that if the true and synthetic options are priced differently, it's got to be due to segmentation, due to frictions, or due to pricing of unspanned risk.
00:21:54.514 - 00:22:26.994, Speaker A: Those are kind of your three broad categories of things. So let me show you what we do in the data. So I'm going to have these replication weights, those Delta S's, those are, we're just going to use the black Scholes deltas, but with a slight adjustment that comes from a paper by Holland White that lets you account for the leverage effect. It's not qualitatively important. It quantitatively makes the fit a little bit better. If you do it, you need volatility. We're going to do this all the way back to 1926.
00:22:26.994 - 00:23:03.956, Speaker A: We're not using IV's from options to get the volatility that you put in to getting your weights. We're just going to forecast future volatility based on lagged realized volatility. The deltas we're actually going to construct based on stale data, we're going to lag the data by one extra day. And the reason for that we show on the paper is that it accounts for stale prices. There is a huge, actually one day auto correlation in the crisp total market return for a long period in the data that would bias our results. We essentially break that out and it eliminates the bias. It runs by taking this out and it runs against us.
00:23:03.956 - 00:23:25.994, Speaker A: All this does is weaken our results for the market return. Use the crisp total market. The risk free rate is just from Ken French. It's the one month treasury. Both of them we're going to do, we can do from 1926 to 2021. That is one of the nice things about synthetic options, is you have a ton of data on some level, that's where this started. Is that true? Options, we only go back to the eighties.
00:23:25.994 - 00:24:00.624, Speaker A: The synthetic options, we can go much, much further and ask what they did in that whole period. So this is a plot of returns on synthetic options against returns against the return on the market. So the return on the market on the x axis, the return on the synthetic option on the y axis. These synthetic option returns are for 21 trading days, and we're doing overlapping windows here. So I actually have 25,000 observations. Right. We have one for every single possible day that you could have started.
00:24:00.624 - 00:24:31.646, Speaker A: So there's a lot of green dots. It looks like the errors here are large. It's only because you have thousands and thousands of observations that you're going to get five standard deviation events. The standard deviation around this best fit line is actually like one to 2%. What this is showing. And this, like Stefano and I found this. I think to a lot of you guys, this was probably, probably expected and known, we did not know this, that this replication actually works pretty well in the sense that when the market falls.
00:24:31.646 - 00:24:52.750, Speaker A: So this is for a 5% out of the money option that we're trying to synthesize. You try to synthesize that when the market falls by 40%, you are getting a return. You are getting a return of right around 35%. Right. It's this last point over here. This fit. We found this fit very surprising.
00:24:52.750 - 00:25:20.484, Speaker A: This is a list of just what are the most extreme. What we did is in every single big crash. So. 19, 29, 20, 20, 20 00 887 1931, we look at what is the 21 day trading window where the market fell by the most. What is the very worst period. So in 29, there was a -41% month. In that month, what did our synthetic option give you? If you had been trading a synthetic option, you would have earned a return on this 5% out of the money put of plus 35%.
00:25:20.484 - 00:25:42.002, Speaker A: So you were about as close as you could be that you wanted 36%. That's what you should have gotten. You missed it by one percentage point. 2020 actually was the second worst of all time, which surprised me. The market fell by 33%. The synthetic option, you would have made 27. And then you really, really, you might worry about whether you could have done this in 1929.
00:25:42.002 - 00:25:57.254, Speaker A: You absolutely could have done this in 2020. Right? You could have just sat there trading spy once a day, paying essentially nothing in transaction costs, and you would have earned 27%. The ideal was 28. So you missed by one percentage .2 thousand. Eight. Same deal.
00:25:57.254 - 00:26:15.156, Speaker A: It's actually the worst miss. We missed by five percentage points. Missed by two in 87. So even with a massive one day crash, this does very well. And 1931, you missed by one percentage point. Another way to say this, the correlation between the true and synthetic option returns when you have both is 93%.
00:26:15.260 - 00:26:15.944, Speaker B: Yes.
00:26:32.744 - 00:27:15.788, Speaker A: You would hope, if anything, it fits better. Those have the problem that now you're going to have to estimate the volatility process and estimate latent states. One way to look at this is if you kind of go back to the theory here, nothing in this theory actually requires that we're replicating an option. Really what I need, if I want to use a synthetic payoff to measure convexity in M, I need convexity in RS. It does not need to be exactly an option return. What I care about is, does this somehow isolate interesting states of the world? Is it convex? We could have made up a quadratic function if we wanted. So you could invent anything by trading dynamically.
00:27:15.788 - 00:27:49.230, Speaker A: If you have the right model, you could get any return. An option return is a natural thing, and we have machinery to do it and do it fairly well, but it didn't have to be that. And so we probably could do better, right? You probably could fit a little better than we do if you added more information. We sort of stopped here, because to us, this already is picking up those states, right? If I want to know, if I want to. So imagine what you think. What we came into this thinking was that investors don't like crashes. So I thought that was true.
00:27:49.230 - 00:28:13.866, Speaker A: And I thought, like, more than the CAPM says, right? The CAPM says they don't like them, but I thought the options data said people really hate them. Right. Then that's why options were expensive. So then it should be the case that anything that pays in those crash states is expensive and has a negative alpha. This pays in those states. There's certainly deviations. It's not nailing the states, but it's way, way better than I would have thought it would be.
00:28:13.866 - 00:28:17.374, Speaker A: Right? It works surprisingly well, Raymond.
00:28:30.754 - 00:28:53.406, Speaker B: And at the same time, so. And now the question is, why is that the market maker and replicating it, and they are still trying so much more. My concern is you're looking at.
00:28:53.550 - 00:29:04.406, Speaker A: I want to cut. That's exactly what I want to. Wait, tell me your concern later, because I'm going to address this. No, I want to hear your concern, but I want, like, let me. Because I. What you're saying is exactly where I'm going. Like, I'm really happy.
00:29:04.406 - 00:29:16.890, Speaker A: And so let me go there and then tell me if it's. Tell me the concern. I 100%. I mean it. I really want to know the concern. So first, let me show you the returns. So this is one way.
00:29:16.890 - 00:29:36.756, Speaker A: I'm going to show you a couple things. So this. So what is this? These are cumulative alphas from writing puts. This is writing put options that are 5% out of the money every month. Your cumulative cumulative alpha is just catastrophically negative. This is you losing a sharp rate. You have a sharpe ratio of like minus one and a half here.
00:29:36.756 - 00:29:53.360, Speaker A: You're just getting killed. This is the past work, the orange line is the cumulative alpha from writing a synthetic. But there's basically nothing. Right. This looks, you know, it's random walkie like it should be. It adds up to essentially zero. It might even have a slightly positive drift.
00:29:53.360 - 00:30:19.576, Speaker A: You actually made some money over this period by writing alphas or writing options synthetically, in addition to the fact that they have drastically different drifts. The other thing to notice, though, is that their variation month to month is very, very similar. Right. This is the statement that the. Their returns have a 93% correlation. When you get a good month for the synthetic, for the true option. So say, like Covid, you also get a good month for the synthetic option.
00:30:19.576 - 00:30:56.704, Speaker A: And this holds month by month, the spikes up. So, like, this hump here shows up in the synthetic option. So the month to month variation in these two is very similar. Their trends are just drastically different. This is what happens if we look across strikes so we can have a put option. These are, again a one month option with a strike that's 10% below the current spot, 10% above the current spots. Or that you're looking at calls at that point, although it doesn't make a difference for the alpha, the colors are.
00:30:56.704 - 00:31:04.944, Speaker A: What do we call this? It's like one shade of blue and another shade of blue almost. It's like a blue and a purple. Blue and violet. So the blue.
00:31:05.444 - 00:31:06.384, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:31:12.804 - 00:31:46.774, Speaker A: So these are the synthetic options. These are the synthetic options. These are the true options between 1987 and 2021. These are the true options between 1987 and 2005. Pick 2005, because that was Brody Turnoff and Johannes, which we think of as just kind of one of the big, like, benchmark papers in this literature, pointing out that there's a big negative alpha on options. And in that period up through 2005, you're seeing these very, very large negative returns. And especially for at the money options, which is what they found when you go through up to 2021, you actually see it shrinks.
00:31:46.774 - 00:32:31.068, Speaker A: And so we're going to come back to that. But the other thing is that the synthetic options never, in, no matter which of these subsamples we look at, we don't see anything. We don't see any alpha that's different from zero. So the shaded area is the confidence band, and it contains zero essentially all the time. So what do we get then? Going back to my graph, if I try to measure marginal utility with respect to the market return again over the course of the entire month, 100%, I get a lot of convexity from the true puts, and I actually get some slight concavity, but it's not statistically significant for the synthetic puts. They're giving totally different answers. So the question that you would have at that point is, which one of these do I want to trust? So we're arguing that this is not about crash risk or jump risk.
00:32:31.068 - 00:33:15.390, Speaker A: So it could be these other unspanned risks that somehow people really care about the path. But if your story somehow involves 1987 2000, 819 29, these things are paying basically the same in those states of the world. So it can't be that. That can't be the story. So, one possibility is you think the true options are right and the synthetic options are wrong, like in terms of understanding marginal utility. So what would you have to believe for that to be true? Could be that this is about trading frictions, right? And so this is, I think, one way to try to get it. This is how I want to partly start to think about addressing your point, Raymond, and tell me when I get through the next graph, you can tell me if I address it, it could be there that you can't replicate, you can't synthesize options, right.
00:33:15.390 - 00:33:59.966, Speaker A: That in 1929, it was not easy to trade the market. There were not ETF's, there were not even index funds. If you were a big giant investor, you could have had 30 guys standing on the trading floor of the NYSE, and they're just trading all the stocks for you, and you could do it. But if you're a random person, it wasn't possible. If that's true, then as replication. And so if we think the true options are right and synthetic options are wrong, then when replication becomes easier, when the futures market becomes more liquid, when the ETF's appear and they become liquid, then you would expect the synthetic option returns to look like the true options, right? Because now you actually, the replication is feasible. We could also have the other possibility, which would be that maybe the synthetic options are kind of right in some sense, that that was always the right marginal utility and the true options are wrong.
00:33:59.966 - 00:34:56.238, Speaker A: How would you get that? Well, the true options would be wrong if it was this kind of segmentation, where most investors could actually not trade the options directly, and so those prices are off because of that. It's just driven by the market makers. In that case, if that segmentation has shrunk over time, and now more people can trade options, or more people can sell them in particular, then the true returns should converge to the synthetic returns that I have this gap in the question. So I have negative returns on true options, zero returns on the synthetic, do I see synthetic returns coming down or do I see the returns on the true options coming up? Which way does this go? So the blue line is the ten year rolling information ratio from writing put options. So this first point is the information ratio that you. So it's, you know, it's an information ratio. So it's an alpha divided by volatility.
00:34:56.238 - 00:35:21.448, Speaker A: That first point is for 1988 through 1998. Right. And then this point here would be 1990 to 2000. This point would be 2000 to 2010. This would be 2010 to 2020. And what you see is as you roll forward, the return you've earned from selling puts has gone down, that it used to be that you got this huge information ratio. You were getting 0.5,
00:35:21.448 - 00:35:50.806, Speaker A: right, which is basically saying, I'm getting the market return all over again. But completely independent of the market return, the synthetic puts have never earned a return, which is what I showed you before. And in fact, even prior to Covid. So this jump is Covid. Even before COVID they've converged. And the way they converged is that the true options came down to the synthetic ones. And so our argument then is that that, and the dotted line is the difference between the two.
00:35:50.806 - 00:36:38.984, Speaker A: And you can see it went down and is at zero now, if anything actually now runs slightly the wrong direction. And so our argument then is that in terms of where this friction is like, who's the problem? We're thinking about this as essentially saying, look, even if there was a friction to trading stocks, that we think that the stocks were close enough to being correctly priced, and there the marginal utility represented that you get, when you look at what happens when you trade stocks directly, trade the market directly, that was more representative of what's going on because that thing has been robust as the market structures become, become more liquid and more accessible. So now feel free to did that. Did that. I don't want to like call you out, but.
00:36:53.804 - 00:37:18.076, Speaker B: I was thinking about if I were the market maker, I don't necessarily care about whether the option has a big counter. I care about the all space, because when I look at this one, I see something that I worry about because I have some capital. When I write options, I may have some things.
00:37:18.180 - 00:37:40.254, Speaker A: Whether it is for sure. Yeah, for sure. Oh, absolutely. And so I guess one question would be. And so that was right. No, absolutely. So I agree with that.
00:37:40.254 - 00:38:02.654, Speaker A: I agree with that story is that, that is why, that's why they had to demand that. Right? And so that says kind of gamma, it says there should be a variance risk premium, really right. Is the higher order stuff should be priced. There should be a premium on gamma. Well, that's actually, that's an illusion. That's actually an illusion. That's not true.
00:38:02.654 - 00:38:18.414, Speaker A: It's not. So the reason it's not true is that most of the points are around zero. So you're seeing more samples if you look at the volatility. So we have it. There's a graph in the paper. I don't have it here. If you actually measure the conditional standard deviation around that best fit, it's actually smallest, right around zero.
00:38:18.414 - 00:38:29.406, Speaker A: But this is, your point is still well taken. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Your point is well taken, which is that the market makers care about hedging errors. Right? One way to say that is they care about gamma. Right? They're trying to.
00:38:29.406 - 00:38:48.614, Speaker A: And so, because if it was all linear, then there are no hedging errors. They care about gamma. And so maybe gamma's priced. And in fact, we're saying we, like we're agreeing with that because the options did obviously deviate. The true options deviated from the synthetic options. The returns were not the same because if you were trying to do this, you were potentially losing money. You had a lot of money at risk.
00:38:48.614 - 00:39:11.624, Speaker A: However, our point is that that has gone away. And so I think the most direct way to look at that is to look at what happens if you sell at the money straddles and delta hedge them. So this is just directly coming at the premium on gamma, right. This is just the variance risk premium. This is like. Exactly trying to hit that. And one way to say it is that the delta hedge is the synthetic option.
00:39:11.624 - 00:39:38.314, Speaker A: That's what a delta hedge is. And so this just is plotting different. The dotted line in the previous graph. What I'm plotting here is what is the return that you got if you're just, this is a standard market maker strategy, right? I'm just selling options. Like, we know, on average they're short options because retail was long. I'm selling options and then turning around and hedging them dynamically. What are the returns that I get from doing that? Exactly as you're saying, they demanded huge returns when that market was segmented.
00:39:38.314 - 00:39:57.702, Speaker A: That market is less segmented now. Right. There's a lot of people who can sell options. So, like hedge funds, for example, that didn't used to, and the premium from providing that service has gone away. You don't make money doing that anymore. You used to when there was nobody else to provide it. Right? If you're like, in the early nineties, there was nobody else doing option selling.
00:39:57.702 - 00:40:11.940, Speaker A: And so they bore. They bore a big risk and they got paid for it. Now, lots of people, like, I used to do it. Any idiot can do it, right? Like all of these. All these vix ETF's are basically doing this. There's like, endless strategies that do this. And so there's no premium to it.
00:40:11.940 - 00:40:30.404, Speaker A: Like, I shouldn't be getting. I don't know, anything. I shouldn't be making any money. Yeah, please. Oh, from getting nailed. Yes. Right.
00:40:30.404 - 00:40:46.798, Speaker A: You see a little here, I think that's here. And so that's your dip. And then also that's the fact that you made money, that those guys made a ton of money coming out of the crisis. And so that's why you don't really see it. We think it's going to come back. So Covid is this. So Covid is this.
00:40:46.798 - 00:41:12.164, Speaker A: And so I'd be okay with it coming back because that'll just bring me back up to zero, right? I mean, so that's why I have the dotted line is because I think that's a. I think that's a. The way I think about this is that if it was just Covid, then I wouldn't believe it. So let me show you an easier way where there's no averaging, just to get rid of the averaging. So if we look at the green line. So just forget about COVID So throw that out. You are already flat for ten years.
00:41:12.164 - 00:41:37.204, Speaker A: And so that's really what the result is, is that it flattened out at that point. But look, there's. Ten years is not a long time to try to measure an average return. And so I don't want to be too. I think I'm making some confident claims and I should dial them back a little bit. Like, there are no standard errors on these guys. And that's for a reason, right? That on a ten year information ratio, there's a lot of uncertainty there.
00:41:37.204 - 00:41:48.364, Speaker A: So I can't say it's not going to come back, but this trend has been going for a while. How am I on time? I must be running out.
00:41:52.804 - 00:41:54.664, Speaker B: I'm supposed to refinement.
00:41:58.164 - 00:42:16.932, Speaker A: Yeah, no, this is what I said I wanted. This is what I wanted. I appreciate it. So just in terms of, can we put a little more color on this? Segmentation has fallen over time again. In the nineties, it was hard for retail investors. Didn't really have a way to sell options. But in fact, endowments and pensions didn't either.
00:42:16.932 - 00:42:51.854, Speaker A: They can't directly write options, right? They're legally constrained from doing that. But hedge funds can. And we know that hedge fund returns look a lot like writing options. And so the growth in hedge funds is one way to participate. There is indexed insurance products that have a lot of option like characteristics. ETF's give access to option strategies and in addition, the options are way more liquid, as is the underlying. The other thing to note is that a lot of these standard strategies that we know that hedge funds, and especially these quant equity type funds, exploit value momentum.
00:42:51.854 - 00:43:31.204, Speaker A: Post earnings announcement drift also disappeared around the same time. Just to remember, you guys probably know a lot of this, the hedge funds rose in size between say 2020 by about a factor of ten. We think of them as kind of being a long running thing, but it was a different world in the nineties. And so to the extent that we think that what they're doing is just taking business from the market makers and just smoothing out that premium, it makes sense that it might have shrunk a lot. And so now there's $4 trillion in there daily. Like the options market itself is massively more liquid, at least in terms of daily volume. Liquidity is obviously notoriously hard to measure.
00:43:31.204 - 00:44:14.126, Speaker A: But if we just look at volume, it's again, completely different world than it was 20 years ago. And then last, this is a plot of just the cumulative return that you're getting from, I think it's 94 different anomalies from this paper by green hand and Zhang and the RFS. And what they find is that it's around 2000 when those anomalies all kind of on average die out. So this is your evaluated portfolio value doesn't work that well anymore. Like you don't see that momentum, we know, doesn't work that well anymore. And this is just showing that that holds on average. And so a lot of these other premia disappeared at around the same time that you see this premium from writing options also going away.
00:44:14.126 - 00:45:14.124, Speaker A: These are all simple things to exploit, and the simple stuff doesn't work that well anymore. That's what we got. So the goal is to understand, again, like exactly as Raymond said, it's, look, trying to understand marginal utility with respect to the market over the month, we don't really have anything to say about pricing of, or at least not today, about pricing of the path. What we're interested in really economically is what is the price of crash insurance? Do investors deeply hate these states of the world more than the CAPM says they should? We do that by looking at synthetic options or really comparing the synthetic options to the true options. And the result really at the end of the day underneath all of this, what I'm actually trying to convince you of is that the CAPM kind of works. That this thing that these, a lot of these things that we thought of as obvious deviations from the CAPM that say it obviously is wrong don't seem like deviations at the moment. And the CAPM prices these options correctly like the alphas are not there anymore.
00:45:14.124 - 00:45:42.224, Speaker A: More broadly, even if you don't believe that, this does say that you want to think hard about non stationarity in these models, the returns don't look stable over time so you can throw out everything else I said here, these returns have changed and so just taking the sample average, everybody's going to get a different result depending on exactly which period they're looking at. And that took us a while to really understand. So I'll stop there. So thank you very much for all your comments. It was great.
