00:00:01.600 - 00:00:33.334, Speaker A: Words of wisdom from Alan Kun, from his book. We shall attempt to understand these words and explain what. How Kahn got around the problem. Solved the problem, I guess. You solve problems.
00:00:34.154 - 00:00:38.762, Speaker B: Am I right? I have read this in the book and I didn't understand it. Is that a mean thing or is.
00:00:38.778 - 00:01:13.242, Speaker A: That more the whole book, or just this particular quote? I think. Well, it shows that there's a certain intellectual difference between you and Alain Khan, but that doesn't mean anything, right. If you were to stack us all on top of each other, we'd still be combined. A sort of midget compared to him. So it's a hard book to read. Yeah. So equivalent means in the sense of categories and.
00:01:13.242 - 00:01:16.170, Speaker A: Yeah. And the rest needs some interpretation.
00:01:16.282 - 00:01:20.324, Speaker B: I believe I understood. The part I didn't understand is we would already.
00:01:23.024 - 00:01:57.972, Speaker A: Yeah, let's. Let's take a look at that. As time goes on today. That's our job is to sort of investigate what on earth this sentence, it's actually two sentences glued together, could mean. Okay, we'll see. Hopefully we'll get somewhere. Because just a little reminder, next week is spring break.
00:01:57.972 - 00:02:48.822, Speaker A: No lectures next week. So hopefully we'll reach some kind of conclusion today. We'll see. Let's begin at the beginning. I'm not going to go as slowly as the first sentence might indicate anyway. A bounded Hilbert space operator, probably one should write this down once, is a Fredholm operator, or as people say, is Fredholm. They make poor old Fredholm into an adjective.
00:02:48.822 - 00:04:52.056, Speaker A: If the dimension of the kernel of this operator, let's give it a name, is finite in the dimension of what you get by dividing the whole Hilbert space by the image that's also finite, in which case, of course, you define the index, be the difference. Why would you do this? That's an integer. And the basic theory of Fredholm operators, I mean, you can summarize it in many ways, but you could summarize it like this. Here's a little bit of canadian content hidden by a guy called Atkinson. Not Rohan Atkinson, some other Atkinson, who said that an operator f is Fredholm, proved that an operator fucking, in this context that we're discussing, if Hilbert space operators, if and only if, it's invertible modular compact operators, meaning there's some other operator g. The inverse module are compacts. It's not unique.
00:04:52.056 - 00:05:26.096, Speaker A: An inverse module compacts, and the condition is that one minus GF, identity minus GF should be compact, and identity minus FG should be compact. That's what invertible modular compacts mean. And because compacts are an ideal inside of bounded operators. It's a reasonable definition. And what this thing means is that the set of all freth operators inside all bounded operators on a Hilbert space, or maybe from one Hilbert space to another, that set is an open set. So it's a reasonable topological space. It's an open subset of a bonarch space.
00:05:26.096 - 00:06:59.984, Speaker A: It's a CW complex homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. As it happens, it's a reasonable space on which you could do homotopy theory. And the reason you might even consider doing that is the second theorem, which says that the index function is a locally constant function, integer valued function on the space of all photon operators, which is a reasonable space according to the first theorem. And the reason that this might come up in this lecture is that if you have some operator I know, a p ap is an order zero scalable or pseudo differentiable operator. Or maybe it's not just one operator, it's a whole matrix of operators. I'm not going to emphasize this point. Or maybe it's acting not on functions, or even on vector valued functions.
00:06:59.984 - 00:07:41.316, Speaker A: It's acting on sections of a vector bundle. It wouldn't make any serious difference to what follows. You can do all of those things if you wanted to. If you have one of these operators, and it has one more property, which I forgot to add in the list. So I'll put it here. If p is elliptic, which means invertible within order zero, pseudo differential or scalable operators up to smoothing operators, that's what invertible means, or that's something which is equivalent to the definition of invertible. If you're in this situation, then, and of course, if we're dealing with n by n matrices, I mean invertible.
00:07:41.316 - 00:08:21.548, Speaker A: For the obvious algebra law, which involves n by n matrix multiplication as well as composition of operators, then Pierce Fredholm, we already know piers bounded operator extends to a bounded Hilbert space operator. So we're in this world. We could have called it f if we wanted to, and it's fret on. Yeah. Oh, I missed off. Crucial hypothesis. I got a little carried away somewhere in the middle of this statement.
00:08:21.548 - 00:09:23.354, Speaker A: The crucial hypothesis is that we need to be in some world where smoothing operators are compact operators, because elliptic means or is equivalent to invertible within pseudo differential operators, modular smoothing operators. And to get from here to here, or rather from there down, to hear with Atkinson's help, we need to know that every smoothing operator is compact. And that's true. If m is compact and all of the manifolds everywhere in this lecture are without boundaries. So close manifold. And the first version of the index problem is to figure out the answer to this question. How does one compute the index of P? We'll soon make this question a little better.
00:09:23.354 - 00:09:54.314, Speaker A: It's hard to make it super good. It's hard to really decide what kind of an answer to the question, what is the index of P? Is a satisfactory answer. It's hard to understand exactly what geometric ought to mean in this theorem. Okay. But we'll make an effort nonetheless. Yeah. And we'll do so with a little bit of machinery.
00:09:54.314 - 00:10:40.738, Speaker A: We don't need to know that much about K theory, and thank heavens, because we don't have a lot of time. But I guess George. Is George still soldiering away teaching school? Yeah. Okay, great. So all you guys are experts on K theory. So K theory, there are various flavors types of k theory. This is suddenly becoming fashionable again.
00:10:40.738 - 00:11:01.634, Speaker A: Jonathan Block pointed me to some lectures by Dustin Clawson at IHes, and he's thinking about K theory for sea star algebra, like. Like we did back in, like, algebraic k theory, for example, of sea structures, like we did back in the 1980s. So there you go. Everything comes around something like that.
00:11:02.894 - 00:11:03.754, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:11:05.374 - 00:11:20.538, Speaker A: Yeah. He's a condensed or liquid mathematician. Yes. One of those people. Yeah. Who'd have thought? Who'd have thought? Jonathan says, I didn't find. Well, I was going to tell you an anecdote, but I decided not.
00:11:20.538 - 00:12:03.154, Speaker A: Okay. So this, however, is not the Dustin Clausen k theory. This is just the thing that you learn about in George's class. This is some billion group, which is a functive. So this is functorial. In other words, if you have a sister algebra morphism from a to b, you get a morphism of abelian groups from the k theory of a to the k theory of b. Okay, and what should we like to say about this function? Well, the very reason that I'm mentioning it in, in this context here is the following.
00:12:03.154 - 00:13:53.442, Speaker A: If you have an element f in our new friend, the multiplier c star algebra of a, which we just became acquainted with on Tuesday, this is a c star algebra, which contains a as an ideal. So in the same sense that we were discussing in Atkinson's theorem, we can ask, or we can contemplate, whether or not f is invertible, modulo a, if you like. If the image of f in the quotient siesta algebra, m of a mod a is an invertible element. If that happens, there's a construction which you can do and in order to do this construction, you need to take George's class. You need to know how k theory is defined, or Dustin Clawson's class, although I don't think that will help you with this particular issue. Let's call it the index of f, and it's a class in this abelian groups. And you might therefore ask, what is the k theory of the sea star algebra of compact operators over here? In Atkinson's theorem, we're talking about operators which are invertible modular compact operators.
00:13:53.442 - 00:14:43.382, Speaker A: Those are the Fredholm operators, and they already have this interesting integer invariant, and it lives inside of k theory. As it happens, it turns out that this k theory groups the fear brilliant group on one generator. And it's possible. Of course, there are two possible isomorphisms here. You can send the generator fixed generator of the left hand side to one or two minus one, but you can choose the isomorphism so that the notion of index that I'm talking about here is mapped to the usual notion of index up here. So that, of course, depends on the choice of isomorphism here. So that's very convenient.
00:14:43.382 - 00:16:31.454, Speaker A: And it immediately means that index questions can be placed within this rather strange context of billion groups with names beginning with K. Yeah, I will take an end run around this problem by telling you that Kasparov actually defines K theory using homotopy classes, you know, what Fredholm elements call them, of a Fredholm ohms. Maybe it's worth continuing this parenthetical remark, because what Kasparov did is so wonderful. So maybe we should continue this a little bit. Probably that means we won't get to the final point, but that'll mean you'll be powerfully motivated, especially the geometrical people, because the thrilling geometric conclusion comes at the very end of this lecture, which might mean it won't actually happen till after spring break. Yeah, good to have a clip hanging. Anyway, let's maybe talk a little bit about what Kasparov did in response to Dan's question.
00:16:31.454 - 00:17:55.160, Speaker A: The answer that I gave here so far tells you that it's a tautology. Every fret operator automatically gives rise to a K theory element. But it's a little vague, so let's try to make it just a little more precise, okay? And it's helpful to, so that we don't have to drown in a whole bunch of preliminaries just to assume a is commutative. Let's just see what happens in the case of c zero of X. Somehow this is the most important case. You're supposed to, according to Alain, you're supposed to get everything, push everything into the abelian world anyway, the simple world of ordinary spaces. So here's what Kasparov talks about in this world we already discussed, fortunately last time, the notion of continuous fields of Hilbert spaces cross over X.
00:17:55.160 - 00:20:09.934, Speaker A: X is some locally compact space and associated to any continuous field, there's a corresponding continuous field of compact operator algebras. Compact, I guess, operator algebra, sea star algebras of compact operators. There's a natural continuous field whose fibers are the sea star algebras of compact operators on the fibers of the continuous field of Hilbert spaces. If you started with continuous field of Hilbert spaces. And what we do is we just look at families of bounded operators which are in the multiplier algebra, so invertible on the nose, but invertible modulo something. Here it is, elements big f in the multiplier algebra of the sea star algebra of sections of the continuous field that we started with. So these are c zero sections of continuous field of compact operator algebra associated to a continuous field of Hilbert spaces which are invertible modulo the ideal.
00:20:09.934 - 00:20:47.638, Speaker A: So I write here k of h, but h actually stands for a whole family of Hilbert spaces. And so we're looking here at continuous sections of some continuous field, but it's hard to choose a good notation for that. So instead, I just told you what I'm actually talking about. That's what a Fredholm operator is. In Kasparov's world. It means that any f in this multiplier algebra is a family of operators, one on each of the Hilbert spaces at the top. Maybe give them names.
00:20:47.638 - 00:21:34.270, Speaker A: Hx. Of course, when you define a continuous field of Hilbert space, it's not enough just to write what I did, because you also have to say, what are the continuous sections? But it's traditional not to say that, even though it's absolutely crucial that you do say it. Yeah. So if you have a multiplier, it can be realized as point wise multiplication by a family of bounded operators, one on each HX. And those operators are continuous in a very sort of loose and weak sense, not a very precise sense, but they must have the properties, since they're multipliers, that they map these continuous sections of the field of compact operator algebras into themselves. So that's the essential continuity. And they should be uniformly bounded.
00:21:34.270 - 00:22:02.210, Speaker A: That's necessary to be in this multiplier algebra, too. And that's it. That's what we're talking about here. So this is what a Fredholm operator is in Kasparov sense, what this is the beautiful thing. This is just the best. What is a homotopy of fretholm operators? Well, it's just given by a continuous field over x times the unit interval. Because if you have a continuous field over x times the unit interval, of course, you can restrict it to the endpoints of the unit interval zero and one.
00:22:02.210 - 00:22:41.594, Speaker A: And now you have two continuous fields over x. It's just a continuous field over x times the unit interval, and a Fredholm operator, in this sense, over x times the unit interval, which restricts to the two things which are supposed to be homotopy equivalents, at x times zero and x times one. That's it. So now k theory is that set, the set of all of these things. Fret on, families, fretam operators, whatever you want to call them, modulo the equivalence relation I just defined. Okay, so I did define K theory much faster than Dustin Clawson and maybe faster than George even. This is just the most wonderful definition, especially if you're interested in index theory.
00:22:41.594 - 00:23:10.814, Speaker A: It's amazing that that's just it. That's. Yeah, that's one of the brilliant observations of Gennady. And if you choose to define K theory this way, you're pretty good for everything. I'm going to say. Some things that I'm going to say are better understood using one of the other million equivalent definitions of K theory. But this is a pretty good one for almost everything does that.
00:23:10.814 - 00:23:35.194, Speaker A: Yes, you'll see further such baking techniques as we go on. Definitely, yeah, because I'm going to list some of the features of K theory that we're going to need. So that's the end of the parenthetical remark, which cuts into my time. Sorry.
00:23:38.074 - 00:23:43.894, Speaker B: So, can I think of generation, like the scalability of giving us the hologram?
00:23:45.034 - 00:24:07.104, Speaker A: No, I think that's. You'll see. I think the answer to that question is no. But it all depends on the context in which you're doing the thinking. We're going to see these scaling families and lots of deformations. So maybe the answer is yes. I don't know, but just wait and see.
00:24:07.104 - 00:25:19.824, Speaker A: Yep, maybe. All right, so what are the properties? I made a little list that we should like to. Yeah, here's a nice one. Here's. Speaking of continuous fields, the more you write down these properties, the more you think that this thing, this k theory, was put on planet Earth specifically to help people prove the index theorem. It just seems to fit like a glove. Suppose you have a continuous field of sea strategies over a reasonable space, locally compact, housed off space.
00:25:19.824 - 00:27:00.106, Speaker A: Suppose you pick a point in this space and you pick a class alpha zero in the K theory of the fiber algebra, like that. Here is a lemma, which is not great to be. This definition of K theory is not great for the purposes of proving this lemma. Nevertheless, this lemma is true for that version of K theory, because there's only one version of K theory, the C star algebras, unless you're dusting clothes in this modern one. Yeah. So you can build some compact neighborhood c of t zero in t and a class, I don't know, alpha C in the K theory of ac. What does AC mean? This means the C star algebra of all sections of this continuous field over the compact set c with the supremum pointwise.
00:27:00.106 - 00:27:39.568, Speaker A: You take the pointwise norm of the section that's continuous function. Then you take the supremum or the max of that pointwise norm function. That's what the norm is in this sea star algebra. And the condition is that alpha C maps to alpha t zero under the obvious restriction map. If you have a section, or maybe I should say evaluation, if you have a section, you can just evaluate it at t zero. And now you have an element of at zero. So that's the sea star algebra homomorphism from ac to at zero.
00:27:39.568 - 00:28:13.308, Speaker A: And you can push forward this k theory class that I'm calling Alpha C to alpha to the k theory of at zero. And I'm saying you're going to hit this element. No, I mean an actual compact set. No, because it's a neighborhood. So t zero has to be in the interior and the germ of this class. So is this thing unique? Well, not necessarily. It depends on lots of things.
00:28:13.308 - 00:29:18.944, Speaker A: But the germ of this, of alpha is unique. That is to say, if you have two different c's, c one and c two, and you build an alpha C one and an alpha C two, and they both have this property, then you can find some third compact neighborhood contained in the intersection of c one and c two. Maybe it's much, much smaller, but it still has to have t zero in the interior of it. There's a third compact neighborhood such that alpha c one and alpha c two both restrict to the same thing in the k theory of alpha sub c, sub three. Okay, so the germ of this thing is unique in that sense of restricting to a sufficiently small open neighborhood, well, sufficiently small neighborhood. We're dealing with compact neighborhoods here, because if you have open neighborhoods, the sections over an open neighborhood aren't, they're not necessarily bounded. They don't necessarily form a sea star algebra in a natural way, then you could say, well, okay, fine, just talk about bounded continuous sections.
00:29:18.944 - 00:29:47.128, Speaker A: But, you know, if you're talking about bounded continuous sections, you're really talking about, you know, sections over some ridiculous stone. Check compactification or something. You don't want to do that. Let's just work with compact neighborhoods. All right? And what does this mean? It means the funny thing. You can build a sheaf. We can now say we can do the following thing.
00:29:47.128 - 00:30:47.154, Speaker A: We can build a sheath over the topological space t, whose sections over any open set. Now, o are just functions from O into the k theory groups over the various points of O. And those functions will be good if locally they have this property. So we can talk about, I don't know, continuous or good or algebraic or compatible, consistent, normal, admissible sections of this field. That's a local property. A section is admissible if its value at any point, alpha zero. I should say if for every t zero, all of the values alpha t near alpha t zero come from this construction groups.
00:30:47.154 - 00:32:28.204, Speaker A: And what about these groups that we're REALLy interested in, which are the k theory of at? These fellows here are the stalks of that sheet of sections from the a theory groups, and the good sections, the admissible sections, the normal sections, irregular sections, whatever you want to call them, are the ones I was just describing. Why do I care about all of this sheaf language? Hardly at all. But just for this, we can assign a precise meaning. So the phrase the k theory of at is constantly in T. Certainly, this SHould MEAN that all of the k theory groups, k theory of 80, are isomorphic, but it means more than that. It means the sheath I was just talking about is isomorphic to a constant sheath, a sheet of just locally constant functions from t into some fixed abelian group. All right, so that's a pleasant property, especially for us, because we have continuous fields all over the place.
00:32:28.204 - 00:32:56.316, Speaker A: Yeah, I've decided. Made a policy decision to relax and not rush, so we'll just see how far we get. Actually, do you mind if I just. I had a critical issue with my checking out of my airbnb, which is that I still have this guy's key. I see. And he's. Okay, fine.
00:32:56.316 - 00:33:23.656, Speaker A: Good fun to leave my apartment. And I just can't get rid of this damn key because there's a little lockbox, but the number doesn't work, so. Okay, but everything's good. Back to. Back to now I'm feeling relaxed. I came here, I got my phone here at the key here, which I was going to give to Shiqi so he could dash off and do something with it and. Yeah.
00:33:23.656 - 00:33:45.188, Speaker A: Notebook to write instructions for Shiqi, had the whole thing all worked out. Yeah. Just relax. Yeah, just. All right, good. So it's. Yeah, k theory.
00:33:45.188 - 00:34:37.385, Speaker A: Well, I'm not saying the k theory groups are all the same. What I'm saying is if you have an element in the k theory group at t zero, let's say, and then you just nudge a little bit away from t zero, that individual k theory element sort of prolongs into nearby k theory groups in a canonical way. But it might be that after you prolong it, what you get is the zero element. I mean, that's possible, but each element in the k theory group of each at has a canonical prolongation to elements in nearby k sub ats. K of ats. Yeah, but there can be degeneration, like I just said, it can be the case that. So each element has a canonical prolongation, but two different elements can sort of collapse into the same element.
00:34:37.385 - 00:35:00.984, Speaker A: It can be the case that in this field, excuse me, this sheath, there's only one non zero store. There's just, just one place where the k theory is not zero, and everywhere else it's just zero. So it's not much of a connection. You can't go backwards. You can parallel translate in one direction, but not the other direction. I think thinking about parallel translation would be. Yeah, wrong.
00:35:00.984 - 00:35:11.704, Speaker A: So it's like a sort of semi, I don't know, semi continuity can go in one direction, but not the other. Okay, here's something still. So that's the.
00:35:15.484 - 00:35:18.420, Speaker B: Yeah, sort of just extended zero elsewhere.
00:35:18.452 - 00:35:48.110, Speaker A: But you couldn't, you can't go back. Exactly. Exactly. If, you know, if you have a whole bunch of k theory elements which, which are a section, let's say your base space is the whole line, and everywhere except at zero, you have a section of the sheet, maybe, whatever it is. You've managed to consistently specify elements in the k through group of all of those elements, and now you just want to prolong to t is equal to zero. Can you do it? No. I mean, not necessarily, but that's what I'm now going to talk about.
00:35:48.110 - 00:36:51.974, Speaker A: So you'll be much happier in about three minutes, just like I am much happier now, because I don't have to worry about this damn key. This is the end of, for now of the discussion of this sheep theory property. And here's another property which we could call excision. And I mean, there are the excision property. Is a very abstract thing which I'll now describe to you, but it has an implication for deformations, which is. So what I'm about to say is not going to make you happy, but what I'm going to say after is going to make you happy. Yeah, if you have an ideal in a sister algebra, in the sense of siesta algebra, so it's closed and two sided.
00:36:51.974 - 00:38:49.174, Speaker A: It's automatically closed under the star if it's two sided, but if not, I mean, call it closed, two sided star ideals the sister algebra in its own right. And if it's contractible, which is a word that deserves to be discussed. So we'll come back to this in just a moment. That's not what's going to make Dan happy, then the projection map from a to a mod j induces an isomorphism in k theory. In order to explain this term, it's worth talking about a homotopy, more generally about homotopies, or a homotopy of star homomorphisms, that's just a family of homomorphisms, let's say from one sister algebra to another, b to c. So we don't do anything prejudicial parameterized by the unit interval like this, which is continuous in some sense. And all I want to do is clarify which is the right sense for this to be continuous.
00:38:49.174 - 00:39:55.766, Speaker A: The right sense for it to be continuous is that this map here, t to phi, sub t over b, is continuous. It's point wise continuity. And you may say, well, that's not enough, that's not very satisfying. But if you have, for example, two compact spaces, X and Y, and you're looking at homotopies of star homomorphisms from C of Y to C of X, according to Gelfand, every morphism of sea star algebras from c of Y to C of X is induced by a morphism of topological spaces from X to Y. So each of these phi t's has a sort of dual map acting on Gelfand spectra. And the homotopy that I'm talking about here is usual homotopy of maps of compact spaces. So it's not so ridiculous to be using this motion, and it fits into this theorem here.
00:39:55.766 - 00:40:04.354, Speaker A: So what is a contractible seaster algebra? It's a sea star algebra on which the identity homomorphism is homotopy equivalent to the zero homomorphism.
00:40:05.854 - 00:40:07.510, Speaker C: Sir, I had a question that might.
00:40:07.542 - 00:40:21.204, Speaker A: Strike you as a little bit odd, having just discussed compact topological spaces, but that's the correct notion of contractible in this context of sea stront necessarily have an identity multiplicative identity element a unit.
00:40:21.704 - 00:40:23.072, Speaker C: I just had a question, sir.
00:40:23.168 - 00:40:45.464, Speaker A: Correct context for making a true theorem like I did just here. So that's. Well, that's a property of k theory, if you like. It's a theorem. Okay. And finally, to make Dan happy, finally, in this point, let's consider some of the examples that we looked at before. Consider.
00:40:45.464 - 00:41:24.406, Speaker A: Yes. Yep, yeah, yeah. This is a little piece of a more elaborate structure, some long exact chromological sequence. But. So, for example, let's look at our friend, the siesta algebra of the tangent groupoid. But let's just block it off like this. We saw that the siesta algebra of the tangent groupoid.
00:41:24.406 - 00:41:38.314, Speaker A: I'll finish my sentence and then look at the screen. Thank you. Gives rise to a continuous field of sister algebra. These are the continuous sections over the unit interval. I think the sound is not clear. We can hear him, but he cannot hear. Well, that's certainly true.
00:41:38.314 - 00:41:54.334, Speaker A: I can hear nothing from you guys. Ah, okay. Just had to conjured you into existence. Okay. Apparently I can hear you now if you want to complain about something.
00:41:56.234 - 00:41:57.690, Speaker C: So I had a question.
00:41:57.882 - 00:41:58.592, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:58.738 - 00:42:09.384, Speaker C: So when you are saying that phi t of v is continuous, so what is the. I mean, what is c in this case? I mean, it's. It has some topology.
00:42:10.084 - 00:42:13.092, Speaker A: C is a C star algebra. Both B and C in that example.
00:42:13.148 - 00:42:13.908, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:42:14.076 - 00:42:15.932, Speaker A: So they have normal topologies. I mean.
00:42:16.028 - 00:42:19.620, Speaker C: Right, right, right. Thank you.
00:42:19.772 - 00:42:53.476, Speaker A: You're welcome. Ah, yeah, great. So I'm just reminding you what this thing is. It's the bit of the tangent group, or sister algebra, which lives over the unit interval, closed unit interval and t space. Or if you like, it's the continuous sections of that associated continuous field over the unit interval. Mm hmm.
00:42:53.620 - 00:43:03.828, Speaker B: So, like, this is the key tangent group, like, um, cos zero, one.
00:43:03.916 - 00:43:37.056, Speaker A: That's also true. Yeah. I hesitated to say it that way because then it's a manifold with boundary, but yeah. And so you can do the following thing. If you have such section, you can evaluate it at t is equal to zero, and then you'll get something in the fiber at t equals zero. And that thing is this abelian c star algebra. This is the c star algebra.
00:43:37.056 - 00:44:21.208, Speaker A: You get by thinking of each tangent space in the tangent bundle as an abelian group taking its group c star algebra, and then taking the sea star algebra of sections of that bundle of sea star algebras. Continuous field, incidentally, of sea star algebras over M. That's what we're talking about. C zero sections of M is not compact, but from now on, m is compact. Excision applies. That's all I want to say, because the ideal here is the c star algebra of sections, of course, which vanish at t, zero. And we took a look at what that is.
00:44:21.208 - 00:45:11.024, Speaker A: All of the fiber sea star algebras, except for the one at t is equal to zero, are just the compact operators. So this sea star algebra, which is the ideal j kernel of this evaluation map, is just continuous functions from the closed unit interval into the compact operators which vanish at zero. Here's an artistic rendition of what's going on. Here's a function which vanishes at zero. So down here is the unit interval, and in this axis, so to speak, is the compact operators, an l, two of m, rendered artfully here as a one dimensional space. And here's a function which vanishes at zero. And I'm saying you can homotope everything away to zero.
00:45:11.024 - 00:45:53.504, Speaker A: How do you do it? Well, you just do this. It's. Oh, look, we have all these disgusting colors. What I'm trying to draw, not particularly successfully, is it is just a collection of functions which are translates of the original guy, something like that. I'm taking this graph and I'm just pushing it over to the right, and where nothing was defined before. I'm just going to say the function is zero like this, and like this, and so on. Lost the other color.
00:45:53.504 - 00:45:54.974, Speaker A: That's enough.
00:45:55.674 - 00:46:02.734, Speaker C: So are you trying to say that it's homotopically equivalent to the. To what happens at t is equal to zero?
00:46:03.034 - 00:46:35.928, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm saying the sea star algebra of continuous functions from the closed unit interval into any other sea star algebra, those continuous functions which vanish at zero. That sea star algebra, that thing is homotopic to zero. And the homotopy is you take a function. What are these? Phi t's? Like you see somewhere, I don't know where it was. All you're doing is you. You're pushing the function to the right. That is to say, you're redefining, you're defining phi t to be a function which is zero until point t in time.
00:46:35.928 - 00:46:42.844, Speaker A: And then it's the original function, I don't know, f of x minus t, something like that. That's probably the actual form.
00:46:43.944 - 00:46:46.084, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you.
00:46:47.044 - 00:46:57.820, Speaker A: Yes, I think that was just. Thank you. So, Jake, these are cones. Yeah. And there's a word for this, which is cone. And that's what these guys are. And they have no case.
00:46:57.820 - 00:47:51.270, Speaker A: Well, they have no k theory. But more to the point, for us, this evaluation map is an isomorphism. So now we can kind of get a little bit of focus here. I'm going to go back to the index theorem, and now we can formulate the index problem a little more precisely. First of all, a fact, maybe I'll add it to the list. If your algebra, your c star algebra, happens to be the sea star algebra of continuous functions on a locally compact space like this, this is a functor of X. And what I'm going to write down is also a functor of X.
00:47:51.270 - 00:49:05.774, Speaker A: It's just the famous Etir Herzebruck k theory of X with compact supports, as they say. And the reason I'm telling you this is that for commutative sea star algebras, the k theory of the commutative sea star algebra fits into an algebraic topological context. People know how to calculate what this k theory is pretty well, extremely well up to torsion group subgroups, for example, if, depending on what kind of an answer you're satisfied with. But there's an immense body of material which is dedicated to calculating khomology groups, and we can plug into that in k theory if we want to. We're not going to do that, because time is not going to allow it. But you should regard the k theory of the sea star algebra of c zero functions on a locally compact space as something which can be known. If you want to know something about this k theory group, you can find a topologist and ask that person, and they will give you the answer.
00:49:05.774 - 00:50:35.008, Speaker A: That's the theory. All right, now back to the index problem. And now we are going to try and refine the discussion a little bit close. You have what letter p is an order zero scalable operator on compact manifold, a closed manifold. And suppose it's elliptic. Then first of all, because it's a scalable operator, there is attached to it a scaling family, because that's what the definition of scalable is. So there is some big p, which is, as we saw, a multiplier algebra of the C star algebra of the tangent groupoid of m.
00:50:35.008 - 00:51:27.022, Speaker A: It's a family of operators. And at t equals one, that family of operators is the p that you started with. And everywhere else it's given by this scaling law. And then at t equals zero, you get the so called symbol. And if you want to be in the multiplier algebra, there's just a little sea star algebraic nicety which plays in our favor here, which is you should just restrict to zero one like that. Okay? And this thing is invertible modulo this idea. Oh, yeah.
00:51:27.022 - 00:52:12.694, Speaker A: Okay. Good. So what do we get? Well, first of all, the k theory of this fellow. According to excision, this discussion over here. Is just the k theory of this commutative c star algebra. Associated to the tangent bundle. What we get is a class in the k theory.
00:52:12.694 - 00:52:55.396, Speaker A: First of all, by definition, or thanks to Gennady here, we get a class in the k theory of this sea star algebra. Called the index of big p. But this, I'm not going to lose any information at all. If I restrict from here to here. Because that map is an isomorphism. We'll get some class that I'll call index of little p over there. Now, this class isn't called the index.
00:52:55.396 - 00:53:27.018, Speaker A: Thus, the one I'm about to write down is always called the symbol class. And where it lies is in the k theory of this c snar algebra. So the definition of this thing is, you take the first, the class that comes from big fat p. And then you just restrict to t equals zero. And you get symbol by functoriality. The symbol of p is the same thing as the index of the class you get by restricting big picture. The t is equal to zero.
00:53:27.018 - 00:54:15.286, Speaker A: So this is also the index class of the symbol of p. And the symbol of p is a multiplier of the sea star algebra. You get from T of M by setting t is equal to zero, which is just t of. We're in the world of commutative c star algebras here. This is usual c star of T of M. A commutative c star algebra. We do something.
00:54:15.286 - 00:54:54.300, Speaker A: We construct some element in the k theory of the commutative Siesta algebra. In fact, we construct it from something extremely explicit. Namely, we construct it from some element in the commutative multiplier algebra of the Siesta algebra. If you have a topologist handy, then you can tell that topologist to calculate this thing for you. This is within the realm of calculability. You should regard this thing as in the bag. If you really needed to know what this was, you could, with the help of a topologist and a computer, you could calculate this thing.
00:54:54.300 - 00:55:30.244, Speaker A: What is the k theory? Well, the computer could work out for you an explicit isomorphism with up to torsion, easily with the freewheeling group on 17 generators. And it could tell you which thing this is inside that freebillion group. Once you told it, you'd have to give the operator p in local coordinates. And so you'd have to give the topologist something to work with. And then you'd be in business. This is a computable problem to figure out what this is. I mean, for any one example, you get some horrendous, you know, it's not easy, but you should regard this as in the bag.
00:55:30.244 - 00:55:37.864, Speaker A: This is not supposed to be a problem to calculate. Depends how many friends you have who are topologists.
00:55:41.004 - 00:55:54.544, Speaker B: Maybe I missed here. We're looking at the c star of tm. Thinking of tm as a group of those top ones. No, that's the content.
00:55:55.044 - 00:56:53.456, Speaker A: Yeah. When I say C star of t, I mean think of it as a group order, if you like. Think of each tangent space as a, as a group, and build the sister algebra of the group and then glue them all together in some way, if you like, form the groupoid, sister algebra of the groupoid. And it is a commutative c serology because all of the tangent spaces are commutative in this context we're working with. Now check this out. I want to go from here to the integers. I want to build a canonical homomorphism from here to the integers.
00:56:53.456 - 00:57:23.944, Speaker A: How may I do it? Well, the k theory of this sea star algebra, the siesta algebra at t is equal to zero, is equal to, is isomorphic to the k theory of this sea star algebra over the closed unit interval. And from the sea star algebra of the closed unit interval, I can just restrict not to t equals zero, but to t equals one. And the fiber at t equals one of our continuous field is the compact operators. Not so it's not commutative anymore. It's not bad. It's just matrices. But it's the compact operators.
00:57:23.944 - 00:57:49.444, Speaker A: And the k theory of the compact operators is z. And that's what I'm talking about here. So the recipe for this map is, which is, it's not given in a very concrete way. That's the problem. The recipe is to go back from the right to the left here, then evaluate not at t equals zero, which would get you back to where you started. Evaluate at t equals one. That gets you to the k theory of the compact operators.
00:57:49.444 - 00:58:31.640, Speaker A: And then the k theory of the compact operators is z. So if you like, down here we have the k theory of the siesta algebra of the whole tangent groupoid, not the whole, but over zero one. And here we have the k theory of compact operators in l two of m. Here's a map given by evaluation at one. Here's a map given by evaluation at zero. And this isomorphism is the one we discussed before. Sorry for making the k theory group so much more tiny than the integers.
00:58:31.640 - 00:59:21.004, Speaker A: In fact, they should have exactly the same size. They're equal to one another. But that's what this map is. And this thing is called index. And it obviously has the property from the discussion, that index applied to the symbol class of p is just the index of p, the integer which is the frettel index p. Yeah, because if you take. So what are we doing? We're taking the Fredholm operator p, and we're, instead of studying its k theory class, we're studying the k theory class of the Fredholm element, which is big p.
00:59:21.004 - 01:00:03.544, Speaker A: We certainly know that big p restricts to little p at t equals zero. Therefore, this inverse map which goes from here to here must send the k theory, which is an isomorphism. This map must send the class of little p to the k theory of big p to the class of big p. And now we're restricting big p to t is equal to one, and that gives us actually p. I think I should have wrongfully said p a little while ago, and I should have said the symbol of p. And now we have the actual Fredholm operator p. And under the isomorphism with the integers, the class of a Fret operator goes to its index.
01:00:04.594 - 01:00:06.934, Speaker B: So the obvious is the statement.
01:00:11.114 - 01:00:44.914, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not. Yes. So I asserted that it's not. And I also gave you a definition of the k theory of the compact operators, because that's the same thing as Gennady's k theory of the sister algebra of a single point, c zero of a point of a point. So it's just homotopy classes in Gennady's sense, in Kasparov's sense of families of pretom operators over a point, just individual threat operators. And there's a beautiful. This just always knocks my socks off.
01:00:44.914 - 01:01:22.944, Speaker A: In Kasparov's world, not anyone else's world, not the world of a tyrann singer, for example. But in Kasparov's world, if you have a frethome operator on a Hilbert space, it has some kernel and some co kernel, which are two finite dimensional vector spaces. In Gennady's world, that Fredholm operator is homotopic to the following operator, it's the zero operator. From the kernel to the co kernel, every frat home operator is homotopic to its index. In Kiennadi's world, it's just spectacular. And you could easily write down the homotopy. Difficult.
01:01:22.944 - 01:02:08.038, Speaker A: You can write it down on small piece of paper, such as the one I was going to give to Shiqi. All right, so the index problem is to figure out what this is okay. And to figure it out in a way which doesn't involve this, what, according to Alain, what you're supposed to do. Maybe we'll do it here. Not do it here, but explain what we're supposed to do here. Here's the k theory of the sea star algebra of t, of m. It's some bundle of groups, seastar algebra from the tangent space.
01:02:08.038 - 01:02:42.394, Speaker A: A little bit of harmonic analysis is involved. Fourier transform, I don't know what. It's not exactly the cup of tea of a tear in hrsebruch, because convolution algebra is okay, but there's a Fourier transform. This is a operative at the level of the sea star algebra. This sea star algebra is exactly the same thing as the functions on t. So this is Fourier. And up here we have this index map that I was describing.
01:02:42.394 - 01:03:54.516, Speaker A: So this observation that you should be able to, in fact, you can reconstruct the index, obtain the index just from symbol data, was figured out by Gelferne. So it was he who made this problem explicit that you should figure out how to go from a symbol of an elliptic operator, an integer. So we'll put Gelfand up here, some greek philosopher or something. There's only one integers. And down here, I don't know, more dead white males, maybe a tyr and hersebrook. The problem is to find a recipe for this map, which is recognizable to your friend, the topologist. So, you know, you come to him again.
01:03:54.516 - 01:04:14.556, Speaker A: You've come to him enough times, asking him to calculate by hand some, you know, some things. He'll eventually try and figure out a general procedure. And that's what needs to go right here. So this thing does exist. It's definable in the spirit of a Tiran hysterbruck. And of course, the exact formula was worked out by a tyrann singer. And that's what we're trying to do.
01:04:14.556 - 01:04:49.724, Speaker A: And we want to do it in a way that any topologist would understand. That's not to say that I want to do it in a way that any of you would understand, because I know from experience it just takes time to absorb this stuff. But at least I want to show you the lay of the land, show you how close you can get to the answer here using group points. That's supposed to be the issue. And it's this observation that is the basis of it. All that's due to Alain is really. It's extremely interesting.
01:04:49.724 - 01:05:26.774, Speaker A: He takes very seriously that this seastar algebra, even though it's isomorphic to this sister algebra, it's not. I mean, they're different siesta algebras. And this thing here is outside of the world of a tier in Hertzbruck. It's not attached to a groupoid, which is equivalent to a space. And he takes that very seriously. And he arrives at a different approach to the index theorem, to a different solution to the index problem by following this path. I mean, it looks very close to the, to the standard approach that a Tiran singer worked out, but it's still different.
01:05:26.774 - 01:05:58.334, Speaker A: It's very interesting. Okay, let's see if we can fit something else in. Get right to the edge of the cliff before, before the end of election. There's one more property about K theory that I'd like to mention. Just one? Yeah, somewhat. So we have some excision. We have some discussion about Fredholm operators, that Fredholm operators fit in to the world we have of kth theory.
01:05:58.334 - 01:06:47.134, Speaker A: We had some other properties of, some sheath properties. So for continuous fields, things are particularly nice. I should say maybe a little bit more about that. So we'll pause this discussion and go back to our list for a moment. There we go. Let's go back here. Well, you have to make some compromises, but in fact, you don't have to make many compromises in the Bob and Eric world.
01:06:47.134 - 01:07:19.434, Speaker A: So there's some world which studies index theory in a more fancy way. And the relevant harmonic analysis is not the harmonic analysis of abelian groups, it's the harmonic analysis of nil potent groups. That's the world that Dan is talking about. And in that world, there's something called this c star lambda of TM, but it's not a commutative sea star algebra. Of course, there's still this. And this isomorphism is no longer due to Fourier, but it still exists at the level of k theory. So at the level of K theory, there is still an isomorphism here.
01:07:19.434 - 01:07:59.774, Speaker A: And so you can basically try to answer the same problem. And what Eric showed in his thesis is that the answer, from this point of view, the answer is the same. Once you understand what this Fourier, you need some other names attached to it. Con isomorphism is, then the correct thing to put here is the same thing that you put here before that Etiran singer put here. The difficulty is that this isomorphism becomes a little harder to calculate if you start off with something that's totally concrete up here. And now you want to tell the topologist what you have down here so he can calculate with it. Well, that's not so easy.
01:07:59.774 - 01:08:50.287, Speaker A: Okay. It just so happens that when people talk about symbols of operators classically, when you talk to your PDE friends about symbols of operators, they're down here. Anyway, that's what they mean by a symbol. They mean, well, they don't mean a K theory class for this commutative sea star algebra, but they mean the multiplier of this commutative sea star algebra. So this problem doesn't arise classically, because when you know, you're talking to your PDE friends to figure out what the right operator is that you want to calculate the index of, and what your PDE friends are doing, effectively, is they're telling you about some element down here. But if you talk to your fancy PDE friends who study these hypo elliptic operators, they'll tell you that the symbol is up here, and they won't tell you how to get down here because they don't know. That's what Alan Kahn figured out is how to get from here to here.
01:08:50.287 - 01:10:00.334, Speaker A: So there's an extra computational step in that case. But in the end, it's the same problem with the same solution. Not only the same problem, but the same solution. Oh yeah. So yeah, I wanted to say a couple of things. First of all, sometimes, going back to this discussion here, this doesn't apply to exactly what's on the left hand board, but it's rather interesting. It's worth keeping in mind, one encounters in real life continuous fields, let's say over the real line, which are constant away, like this one over here from t equals zero.
01:10:00.334 - 01:11:40.378, Speaker A: And if the field is constant away from t equals zero, then as we just discussed, specialization with the zero fiber gives an isomorphism in k theory sometimes. So there are a significant number of very important examples where when you evaluate it, t equals one, you also get an isomorphism in k theory. This is not by virtue of excision, because when you evaluate at t equals one, the kernel corresponds to a continuous field which is no longer constant because there's the special zero fiber and there's a whole bunch of other fibers. It's not a constant field, but one encounters this situation. So this is a method to build isomorphisms between k theory groups. If you have a continuous field which is constant away from t is equal to zero, then for sure there is attached to that field a map from the k theory of a zero to the k theory of a one. You take a class in the k theory of a zero.
01:11:40.378 - 01:12:06.664, Speaker A: You extend it, if you like, just a little bit by the sheaf property. So now you're in the k theory of a epsilon, but a epsilon is a one. So there you go. You're in the k theory of a one. And that describes a map from the k theory of a zero to the k theory of a one. So there's always a map coming from any deformation, any one of these continuous fields which is constant away from t equals zero. But sometimes you actually get an isomorphism this way.
01:12:06.664 - 01:13:52.074, Speaker A: And the easiest example of this comes from the sister algebra of the tangent groupoid of not any old manifold, but rn, any rn. So that is a, well, I guess didn't actually specialize. I don't even need that. So the seaster algebra, excuse me, the continuous field of siesta algebra is associated to the, the manifold m equals rn that we've been discussing for the last couple of lectures has this additional property that all of the k theory groups are the same. The k theory of at in this situation here is a constant sheet, like I was saying before, even though the sister algebras aren't all constant, the k theory is. And what you get out of this is an isomorphism, taking into account everything that we said over there, from the k theory of the cotangent bundle of rn, which is just r two n, to the k theory of, well, the compact operators two of rn. And this is an instance of the famous bot periodicity theorem.
01:13:52.074 - 01:14:50.634, Speaker A: In bot periodicity, you build, using some techniques from Siesta algebra, tensor products, and so on. You build a slightly more fancy, it's barely more fancy, you build a small variation of this construction and obtain an isomorphism of this type from the sea star algebra of functions on two reals n. Maybe I'll continue to call it c of rn with values in any c star algebra, K theory of that c star algebra. So there is such a natural ina isomorphism, and out of interest, it's not that important for us, but just out of interest, it happens to come from one of these deformations. Okay. Yes. And I think there's one more topic in K theory that we need.
01:14:50.634 - 01:15:44.364, Speaker A: And then, right, teetering at the edge of the cliff, I'll show you a tantalizing geometric construction, and I'll leave you there, teetering at the edge of the cliff, two wheels over the edge of the cliff, two wheels, not over, you know, and the, the proof will be right at the front of the car. And as you reach forward again, the proof, the car is just like in the italian job. Okay? Yeah. But one more little thing to say before we go right to the edge here. So it's another bullet point like this excision bullet point, for example. I guess bot periodicity has a bullet point. We'll need that.
01:15:44.364 - 01:17:09.966, Speaker A: Sorry. Just thinking what else we might do. Maybe it's in the after spring break. But back to this business here. So this property is called stability, and I'll state it in some sort of groupoid friendly language. So on Tuesday, we were looking at submersions of manifolds, c infinity manifolds, and we were looking at this particular space, which I think I wrote like this, consisting of pairs of points of z, which belong to the same fiber of the map, PI. And I muffed this on Tuesday.
01:17:09.966 - 01:17:58.444, Speaker A: So I'll say it again properly this time. The source and the range maps are just the projections onto these two copies of z. Now, so this thing is a little category, small category, and it's equivalent to, in the sense of category that Alain is talking about there. And in some way which is also compatible with c infinity structures, it's equivalent to another lie groupoid, namely just w. If you look at the category which has one object for each point in w, and no morphisms at all except the ones required by law, the identity morphisms, that's a category, and that category is equivalent to this one. So from an Alan's point of view, if you get to something like this, you're sort of game over. You're in the world of commutative spaces.
01:17:58.444 - 01:19:34.524, Speaker A: And that's what we're going to discuss here. There's a natural notion of punctuality for submersions like this. If you have a map into the base from some w one into w, then you can form the pullback square using, you can pull back PI to w one, and that's another submersion. And so you can do what I'm, you can build this groupoid over w, one just like you can build it over w. There's a version of this groupoid over w one just like there's a version over w. If you have a smooth map from w one into w, you need that smooth map to build the construction, okay? And the result that we want is that the C star algebra of this groupoid is just the sister algebra of the other groupoid, which is just, if there are no morphisms, you can do the math, you can check the definitions. If you're dealing with a category with no morphisms, the C star algebra of the group or C star lambda of w is just the functions on w like that.
01:19:34.524 - 01:20:07.610, Speaker A: Okay? In particular, this map has the property that if you restrict to a submanifold of w. There's going to be some restriction map here to the part of this groupoid which lives over that submanifold. And there's going to be a restriction map here of functions to that submanifold. And the obvious square will commute. That's what all of functoriality that we'll need. Yeah. I should say pullbacks along, because you have to be a little bit careful.
01:20:07.610 - 01:20:21.474, Speaker A: Outside of compact spaces, along proper smooth maps, you need proper to have to get functoriality of c zero of w. Okay, that's kind of nice. Yeah.
01:20:27.614 - 01:20:34.990, Speaker B: Which corresponds to z or m. Interpret. And so this is right there is.
01:20:35.022 - 01:21:27.634, Speaker A: The same one as this one, sort of, yeah. So the k theory of the compact operators is the same thing as the k theory of the sea star algebra of continuous functions on a one point space. That's, that is an instance of this, wherever it is, this isomorphism here. Ready for this? We're really close, but all I will do is show you the secret plan. And then, like I say, I'll store the proof in the engine compartment. See how courageous you are to get. Here's what Alain came up with.
01:21:27.634 - 01:22:18.662, Speaker A: This is really marvelous. Let e be r two n for some n, some even dimensional vector space. Okay, suppose we have a compact manifold, M. In order to make this construction, what Alan starts with is an embedding, smooth embedding of m into e. So every smooth, compact doesn't even have to be compact. Every smooth manifold embeds into some e. We don't care how big this is.
01:22:18.662 - 01:23:18.214, Speaker A: The size dimension of this is not an issue. So for sure, there's an embedding. And now going to build a map from m, it's going to be the way I'm writing it down, a map into e. But you should think of it as actually being into the home, the group of homeomorphisms on e. Each time I have an element of e, I get a map from e to itself, just by addition by that element. So what's really relevant here is that there's an action of this thing, this groupoid, on this space, or I suppose the family of copies of this space over the objects of this groupoid. Anyway, this thing is just going to be a certain smooth function, and here's what it is.
01:23:18.214 - 01:24:17.204, Speaker A: So what's an element of the tangent group point? Well, it's one of two things. Either it looks like this or it looks like this. And what shall we do with this fellow? Well, this doesn't look at all irrelevant. This is the sort of thing you'd expect to do with the tangent groupoid, you form the difference quotient, if you like, of h. And what you do with this fellow is you take the derivative of h at the point m and evaluate it on this tangent vector. And when you do that, you get a tangent vector to e at the point h of m. That's what derivatives do.
01:24:17.204 - 01:24:53.914, Speaker A: But it's e is a vector space, so you can always identify the tangent space with e itself. And that's what we're doing here. So there's a map, maybe call it h bar or something, that you can build out of any embedding. And it's compatible with the groupoid operations. It's actually a functor from this category with many, many objects, to this category with just one object. But you should think of it not quite in that way, more as an action. It's a morphism from this category to the category of homeomorphisms or diphtheomorphisms of this manifold.
01:24:53.914 - 01:26:10.044, Speaker A: Sorry. And now you can build a whole bunch more objects. So let's define not objects, a whole bunch more groupoids. So here's another regroupoid. And you can do this, I'm doing it here for the tangent groupoid. But what you need in order to do this construction is a functor, not there, here, right here, a map here, which is compatible with composition in this guy, like this one is. And what is this? Well, it's the usual sort of thing.
01:26:10.044 - 01:27:12.064, Speaker A: It's made out of triples like that. And the condition is you can get from, to e two from e one by adding h of gamma to e one and second. Ah, thank you. Yes. So if you have such a triple, the source of this, well it starts at e one. So that should be in the source. And it also starts wherever gamma starts.
01:27:12.064 - 01:28:39.154, Speaker A: So that's something in m times r times e. Same thing for the range quickly to now. And a composition law, I will say, dare to say the obvious composition law, namely if you have two triples like I have in this semi direct product, I just drop out the, the middle e and I compose the gammas. Okay, fine, I'll write it down. And it's a legroup od. So now let's write cm cross e. And I'm going to introduce one extra variable here, s.
01:28:39.154 - 01:29:28.630, Speaker A: And I'm going to do something which is suspiciously like what we did when we started out talking about the tangent group or euclidean space at the very beginning. And we can do this construction starting from, instead of h s times h. And what's s? Well, any real number would do the job. If s is equal to zero. Of course, h zero times h is not going to be an embedding. But maybe I should have put this in parenthesis. I'm certainly thinking, and Alain is certainly thinking, that this guy isn't embedding.
01:29:28.630 - 01:29:52.724, Speaker A: But any smooth map will work. So he has in mind a fixed embedding h. But he's perfectly happy to multiply h by zero to get the constant map. Not a problem. This construction will still work. And now it's very interesting. We have a family of groupoids here, and these parameterized by s.
01:29:52.724 - 01:30:22.220, Speaker A: As for the tangent groupoids, they're also somehow families of groupoids parameterized by t. So there's a continuous field of groupoid sister algebras floating around here over not just the real line, but over the unit over r two. And of course, we can restrict to the unit square if we want. Okay. And when we certainly have a good bead. Now on what happens as you vary t. But what happens as you vary s? It's kind of interesting.
01:30:22.220 - 01:30:57.008, Speaker A: If s is equal to zero, then this construction is not terribly interesting. If s is zero, nothing is doing here. And if you think about it, when s is zero, the sea star algebras you're going to get, the group or sister algebras you're going to get will just be the continuous functions on r. On e, I'm calling it with values. In the c star algebra of the tangent groupoid, when s is equal to zero, this construction is trivial. And the sister algebras you get are very familiar. They're basically just the sister algebra of the tangent groupoid.
01:30:57.008 - 01:31:32.684, Speaker A: Except they're mixed up a little bit with buck periodicity, because there's an extra euclidean space in there. Now, when s is equal to one, it's very interesting what happens when s is equal to one. This category with this sort of stupid composition law actually has very nice property. It's an example of one of these categories. When s is equal to one, this category no longer suffers from the Alenkon defect that you see up there. When s is equal to one, this category is equivalent to a space. Pretty cool.
01:31:32.684 - 01:32:27.818, Speaker A: And what space is it equivalent to? I will tell you, Dan, that you know the answer. And now you should know the answer. Now this, the space that you get by setting s equals one. And so now this c star, this groupoid, is Morita equivalent in the technical sense to a space, a category with no more prisms. The space in question is the deformation to the normal cone for the embedding h of M into e. So if you believe, and it doesn't seem too unreasonable to believe it, that you can vary s without really changing the k theory much, you can go from a situation when s is equal to zero, which is basically the original index problem, except we raised the stakes by multiplying by functions on e. In other words, we applied Bob periodicity.
01:32:27.818 - 01:33:26.894, Speaker A: You can go from that situation, the original problem, to a solution. And the solution consists of understanding more carefully this groupoid, which is moritra equivalent to a space by good fortune, the space is, as I say, just the deformation to the normal cone. Our friend, something we've seen for the embedding of m into rn. And so now we can expect the answer to this index problem to involve algebraic topology, but algebraic topology related to the embedding of m into rn. One of the first things that attir and Hersterbruck did when they invented k theory, in fact, they did this even before they invented k theory, is they figured out that this group here is functorial for embeddings of m into rn. And they worked out a formula for the functoriality and they did a number on it, and they calculated how the Churn character transforms. They calculated everything from the perspective of algebraic topology.
01:33:26.894 - 01:34:10.064, Speaker A: After you've varied from s equals zero, which is like the original problem, but just with pop periodicity thrown in to s equals one, you end up just with the standard algebraic topology of the embedding of m into e. And there are formulas which arise from algebraic topology that Etir and Herster figured out in the 1950s. And those are exactly the formulas that we'll enter here. But the whole key to the thing will be this groupoid. And in particular, the variation of this groupoid is as you vary s. I mean, it's another family of groupoids. What kind of properties does it have? The level of continuous fields? We know that's not completely trivial.
01:34:10.064 - 01:34:27.064, Speaker A: Do we get a continuous field in the s variable? Does the k theory change as the s variable changes? These things have to be discussed, and that's what we'll do when we come back tanned and healthy from our vacations at spring break. So thank you.
