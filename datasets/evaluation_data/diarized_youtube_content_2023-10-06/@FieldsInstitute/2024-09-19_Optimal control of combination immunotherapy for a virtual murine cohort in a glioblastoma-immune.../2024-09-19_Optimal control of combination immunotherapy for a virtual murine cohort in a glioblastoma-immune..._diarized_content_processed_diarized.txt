00:00:00.320 - 00:00:14.841, Speaker A: Cases where it absolutely fails. So I think that's ongoing. There are other people, there are simpler. So it also works in prostate, but I think prostate is simpler. Sarcoma is interesting because the cells move. They're mesenchymal cells. They're not tied to.
00:00:14.841 - 00:00:42.295, Speaker A: So they're moving around a lot, which we see. And that creates a problem for this model without longitudinal imaging. Oh, sure. So I haven't. I didn't motivate any of this. But this mu term is basically, you know, remember, f is a vascular volume fraction, Rho is the cellular density. And so.
00:00:42.295 - 00:00:59.173, Speaker A: And epsilon here is just a term that's sort of sensitive to the degree to which the tumor engages lactic acid fermentation. If I didn't have any oxygen, I would just have that. Anaerobic glycolysis.
00:00:59.349 - 00:01:00.625, Speaker B: Was it aerobic?
00:01:02.245 - 00:01:14.821, Speaker C: Great talk. Thank you. I have a bit of a maybe clinical question. What is the timeframe in which really you can pick up this hypoxic signature for patients? Are we talking months, weeks, from the.
00:01:14.853 - 00:01:16.985, Speaker A: Time of diagnosis to the time of.
00:01:17.445 - 00:01:20.385, Speaker C: I guess you show some separation.
00:01:21.965 - 00:01:23.865, Speaker A: Those were head and neck cancer.
00:01:24.425 - 00:01:36.405, Speaker C: Yeah. So in general, just if you get a patient and then you want to pick up this biomarker, I guess, when do you want to look at that? How long? When is it relevant? Is this always relevant or is it just a kind of.
00:01:36.705 - 00:02:14.105, Speaker A: So that's a fantastic question, because what some people argue is that, you know, the initial hypoxic fraction is what's really important. Other people have argued in this paper in particular that what really matters is hypoxic fraction after two weeks. Because the other thing is this thing varies dynamically. So hypox. There's a paradigm in radiotherapy called reoxygenation, where the assumption is the only reason we can control a tumor, which has been challenged these days, because we're really reducing the number of fractions during radiotherapy. But the paradigm is that in order to control the tumor, we rely critically on reoxygenation. So hypoxia disappearing as you go through radiotherapy.
00:02:14.105 - 00:02:26.423, Speaker A: This study and a couple of others looked at the change in hypoxia. So they had measurements initially, measurements at two weeks and maybe even four weeks, which, again, is very expensive. Hard to do.
00:02:26.519 - 00:02:26.871, Speaker B: Sure.
00:02:26.943 - 00:02:32.511, Speaker C: So that's kind of what you believe, too. So the delta between before and after, around the two weeks is what, in your opinion?
00:02:32.583 - 00:02:33.127, Speaker A: Probably.
00:02:33.271 - 00:02:34.035, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:02:39.815 - 00:03:12.365, Speaker D: Hey, Ed, Beautiful presentation for the non hypoxic tumor that you have this gorgeous correlation between vascular, vascularity and cellular density. Right. When you went to the hypoxic tumor, you showed this area that is like low vascular perfusion but high cellular context, which is your hypoxic region. But on the other side of this correlation line, you also have a large area with very high vascular density and very few cells. What's going on there?
00:03:13.705 - 00:03:44.525, Speaker A: So there's a lot of noise in these plots, for starters. So when you get. So probably it's a lot of noise. I don't know how seriously I would take a lot of these data points. You see all the points around zero density and zero vascular volume fraction. And I think some of the these tumors you have, you tend to get like some necrotic components which tend to contribute signal to where you don't. So I don't think that's physiological, but I mean, I would expect.
00:03:44.525 - 00:03:57.565, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know that that's physiological. I mean. Yeah. So, you know, necrosis should show up sort of down here, but I think sometimes it contributes a signal up here.
00:04:05.275 - 00:05:21.637, Speaker E: Okay, thank you, Ed. Okay. Our next speaker is Tracy Stepien from the University of Florida who will talk about optimal control of combination immunotherapy for virtual murine cohort in a glioblastoma immune dynamics model. Thank you.
00:05:21.701 - 00:06:01.323, Speaker B: All right, thanks. First, I'll start off with just a little overview of glioblastoma or dbm, because I don't think that we've had that just yet. Usually this slide has been covered a million times by now, but glioblastoma, I'm talking about the most common type of primary brain tumor. This is not tumors that have metastasized to the brain, but these are tumors that have started in the brain. Median survival time with treatment is only 15 months. I actually was looking at this reference right here, and I realize it's old, but this number hasn't changed. The fact that this number hasn't changed means that we need to do something about standard of care.
00:06:01.323 - 00:06:45.773, Speaker B: We need to be looking at different treatments to try to extend this. One treatment that we are looking at is immunotherapy. Immunotherapy seems to be working in some cancers. We're having mixed results for GBM immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti PD1. We've had some pretty promising outcome in early phase trials, but by the time it gets to randomized phase 3 clinical trials, not so much anymore. However, one of the labs that I am working with, they have a recent paper where they were looking at a combination treatment of two different types of immunotherapies this was in mice, but they were looking at Anti PD1. They were also looking at this CCR2 antagonist.
00:06:45.773 - 00:07:20.183, Speaker B: This is a drug that targets myeloid derived suppressor cells, these cells that kind of stop T cells from doing too much. And this combination treatment was shown to extend the overall survival. We have the survival curves here on the right. So this was with two different types of glioma cells that were implanted in mice. In the black is the control, so no treatment. The red line is for. Sorry, the red line is for the CCR2 antagonist only.
00:07:20.183 - 00:07:34.887, Speaker B: The blue line is for the. Oh, sorry, I switched that around. Sorry. The red line is for anti PD1. The blue line is for the CCR2 antagonist. And then the green line, right, that is for the combination treatment. And so survival has increased.
00:07:34.887 - 00:08:02.543, Speaker B: So this is one of the things that we have been wanting to look at. And so this is a little bit more of the experimental data from the lab. And so this is some imaging data. So we can see that we have kind of the outline of where the tumor is. They have these colored markers so they can see where different types of cells are. In the white here is T cells. These are all T cells with the red and the green.
00:08:02.543 - 00:08:50.784, Speaker B: If there's a spot where red and green show up, that's where the MDSCs are. Then in the blue, that is all viable cells. We make the assumption that all of the cancer cells are the blue, subtracting out the green, the red and the white. With this data, we wanted to then try to build a mathematical model and try to understand the interactions between the cancer cells, these two different types of immune cells. And then can we look at a combination treatment and see can we do in silico clinical trials to see what we might need to do to improve survival? This is our model equations with treatment for our tumor cells. We assume logistic growth. We assume that there's a killing by T cells.
00:08:50.784 - 00:09:30.977, Speaker B: With the T cells, there's just a natural activation of them and a stimulation when there are cancer cells there we have this term right here that represents the inhibition by the PD1PD L1 complex. So we had a talk yesterday that kind of introduced that. And then we also have inhibition by MDSC is, right, because the MDSC is will limit how much the T cells do and then a natural cell death. And then for the myeloid derived suppressor cells, we have stimulation by chemokines. So the cancer cells, they send out chemical signaling that recruit MDSCs to the brain. Right. When there is no cancer.
00:09:30.977 - 00:10:19.447, Speaker B: You will not find MDCs in the brain, but when there are cancer cells, then you have MDSCs that start getting recruited. And then we have a natural cell death. In the orange are all the different parameters that are in the model. Then you'll notice that we have this function U1 of T and a function U2 of T, the U1 that is for anti PD1, so application of that drug. And the U2 is for the application of the CCR2 antagonist. And the way that we've implemented in this model and kind of the way to think about it is that it's really more. It's not exactly the dose of the drug that's given, but rather a reduction in the effect of the different parameters.
00:10:19.447 - 00:11:16.765, Speaker B: So this rho is this inhibition rate. So the U1 will reduce the effectiveness of that inhibition. And then for this U2 it's reducing the effect of the cancer cells being able to recruit the MDSs. So when we started analyzing this model, we had done some existence uniqueness. We did parameter sensitivity and identifiability. And with those results we determined that there were really only four or sorry, five parameters that we needed to target and five parameters that we needed to look at in order to do like a personalized treatment for any sort of mouse. So those parameters we got lambda C, which is the tumor growth rate, ADA is the T cell kill rate, RHO is the inhibition rate by the PD, L1, PD1 complex, R is the inhibition rate by MDSS, and D sub M is the MDSC death rate.
00:11:16.765 - 00:12:11.299, Speaker B: Essentially, we are going to use optimal control to optimize a treatment for each individual mouse. But we created two different virtual murine cohorts in order to, right, so not just look at one mouse, but to try to think about a whole population of different mice. So the first cohort that we did was just we used some Latin hypercube sampling for our parameter values. From our literature searches and from parameter analysis we had done, we had lower upper bounds for parameter values. So we just did Latin hypercube on again these five. And then the other thing that we did is so in a previous treatment free model, we had done approximate Bayesian computation so that we could get probability distributions for each parameter. So instead of just having a uniform distribution, we had ideas about, you know, if it's a normal distribution or something like that.
00:12:11.299 - 00:12:52.745, Speaker B: And so then we sampled from those probability distributions to get our other cohort for the optimal control problem for the objective function, just so that you can see it. We minimize our tumor Burden and the toxicity of the immunotherapies. I can tell you more about the form and the weights and all that thing if you are interested. But essentially that is subject to our ODE system with initial conditions. From the experimental data we have the ending time point free. Then again from the literature, we look to see what the maximum allowed dosages for the two different drugs would be. This is a result for one typical mouse.
00:12:52.745 - 00:13:39.385, Speaker B: What we would do is we would allow first pre treatment. We would have the tumor being implanted and allow it to grow. Then treatment would turn on sometime after day seven. That would be the phase where you would have optimal control. We used software in order, actually I think that was on the previous slide. So we have software that we used in order to gpops to give us what the optimal treatment should be, the optimal application of the anti PD1 and the CCR2 antagonist. Then the other thing we were interested in is okay, so you have this treatment happen, but let's allow the patient to keep going to see what happens after that treatment.
00:13:39.385 - 00:14:13.105, Speaker B: After that optimal treatment for that patient. Let the simulation keep running. This is an example where the patient then the tumor got too large. So we assumed that that would be death. From these results, we took our treatment regimen that came out from this analysis. We compared it to the experimental treatment regimen that was used for that original experimental data. We determined that you should start later after the tumor implementation, but you should have it last longer.
00:14:13.105 - 00:14:53.915, Speaker B: This is something that we would like to test experimentally, but we haven't done just yet. We also looked at survival analysis with our two different cohorts. We have 22 days and 55 days. That corresponds in mice years to 2 years and 5 years human years. We can see that with our uniformly sampled cohort that you know, within two years, right, we have 60% disease free and 50% after five years. So that, that seems to be pretty good when you know, GBM is not that successful. But right.
00:14:53.915 - 00:15:29.195, Speaker B: This is the uniform cohort. So when I look at kind of the GBM specific parameters, so taking the second cohort and looking at these specific parameters, so our survival does decrease. So we have 40% and then 30%. But that is still much better than what we are seeing clinically right now. And so we just kind of have these survival curves up here. So this work is showing that this experimental or the treatment regimen is promising. And of course, right, we would need to continue and actually test that.
00:15:29.195 - 00:16:11.885, Speaker B: So these are some summary of the other things that we found from our parameter analysis. Our High tumor growth rates and low T cell kill rates. If you have that, treatment failure is more likely. This was mentioned in the projects that this would be a case that potentially impossible to amplify the immune response enough in order to do anything. And then high innovation rates by PD L1, PD1 and by MDSS requires a more aggressive treatment. And that seems reasonable. But then if you have increased immune suppression, then you're going to have treatment failure anyway.
00:16:11.885 - 00:16:35.683, Speaker B: And so then kind of like out of all of these parameters. Right. If there's a parameter that you need to target as you're thinking about treatment, it does seem to be the MDSC death rate. That seemed to be a much better indicator of long term survival than either of any, you know, either of the immune suppression parameters in terms of future directions. Right. So that image that I had was a nice spatial image. And an ODE model completely ignores that.
00:16:35.683 - 00:16:55.551, Speaker B: We are currently building an agent based model. We're using FYSEL to explore the spatial distribution and the correlation between where those cells are located. All right. And this is my group. So Hannah Anderson, she was the main person on this project. And Jillian Carr is working on the agent based model. This is the rest of my group.
00:16:55.551 - 00:17:05.155, Speaker B: Group and this paper on bioarchive and as of yesterday accepted into Journal of Theoretical Biology. So you'll see that soon. Thanks.
00:17:07.815 - 00:17:12.155, Speaker E: Okay, thank you. Tracy. Are there any questions? A quick question.
00:17:19.015 - 00:17:48.891, Speaker F: Thank you for a nice talk. I have a question about the formulation of your problem. When you write down your odes, the C grows according to logistic growth with C max as the carrying capacity and that then it appears in your formulation of the optimal control problem. What if you take C max to infinity because you know, tumor doesn't really stop growing just like that. So what happens mathematically? Like does it modify your optimal control problem? What happens?
00:17:48.993 - 00:18:17.935, Speaker B: That's a good question. So we had considered, when we were first building the model, we had looked at different formulations and just an exponential. Yeah, because you're right that also kind of the time period that you're on the exponential may be good enough. You may not really need the logistic because you may not need it till the point that you would actually have that carrying capacity. By the time we got to the optimal control problem, like so we had, we had varied the weights, but at that point we had kind of stuck with the logistics. So I actually don't know your answer of what would happen if we.
00:18:17.975 - 00:18:27.707, Speaker F: Because it appears in the denominator of C under your integral. So I think it may change the mathematics significantly. And I think it's more correct to just get rid of C max. It may make it simpler.
00:18:27.811 - 00:18:28.051, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:28.083 - 00:18:31.355, Speaker F: But I think it's like the tumor doesn't just stop growing.
00:18:31.435 - 00:18:42.779, Speaker B: Right. The reason we kept that term was just so that. For like. So that the relative effect of each of the terms that. That they would be more reasonable. So. Right.
00:18:42.779 - 00:19:07.321, Speaker B: We did that scaling so that it would be scaled. But you're right that that could definitely change. Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. I can put that back. I know it's very, very short talk.
00:19:07.433 - 00:19:10.345, Speaker E: Remember what was discussed, like, just five.
00:19:10.385 - 00:19:16.125, Speaker B: Minutes before just for the sake of.
00:19:16.585 - 00:19:19.285, Speaker E: Understanding of the rest of the party.
00:19:21.665 - 00:19:22.513, Speaker B: There you go.
00:19:22.649 - 00:19:36.865, Speaker E: Actually, sorry to cut everything short, but I'm trying to try to stay on schedule. Have a reasonable tea, but could you please talk to Tracy during the tea and right now? So continue this discussion and we'll thank Tracy for this great talk.
