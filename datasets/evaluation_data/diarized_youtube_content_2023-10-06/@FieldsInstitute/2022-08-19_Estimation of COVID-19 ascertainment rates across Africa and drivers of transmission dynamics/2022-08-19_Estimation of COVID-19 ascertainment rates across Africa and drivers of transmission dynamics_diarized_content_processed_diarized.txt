00:00:03.200 - 00:01:19.286, Speaker A: So hi everyone and welcome to the Next Generation seminar series. It's a networking event by Feeds Institute to early career scholars, junior motors and epidemiologists working on or interested in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and other threats to public health. Bonjour tout se bievenu dans la serie deseminar. Next generation. First of all, we wish to acknowledge this land on which the feeds Institute operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron wandat, the Seneca and Mississaugas of the credit. Today this meeting place is still the home to many indigenous people from across Turtle island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this landat descendant the two church island.
00:01:19.286 - 00:04:09.404, Speaker A: And for today we have a special guest, Professor Jude Kong, who works in mathematics in statistics department at York University and the founded director of the Africa Canada Artificial Intelligence and Data Innovative Consortium. He is the regional node liaison to the Stadium committee of the Canadian Black Scientist Network, a member of the scientific advisory committee for of the Mathematics for Public Health Network, a member of National COVID-19 Modeling Rapid Response Task Force and a member of the Canadian center for Disease Modeling. His talk today will be on estimation of COVID-19 assertion rates across Africa and drivers of transmission dynamics worldwide in the early stages where he will be sharing his experienced enhanced governments and communities to manage and contain the spread of COVID-19 and presenting some of the models that he designed and analyzed for early response and community based risk mitigation and control of developing epidemics using COVID-19 as a case study. And he presents, he will be presenting the results.

So il parloura experience on thank you very much Professor Jude for accepting our invitation. And the floor is yours, professor.
00:04:10.504 - 00:04:23.644, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Professor Seka. Let me share my screen and right from there, my friend. All right, let me know if you're able to see my screen.
00:04:26.384 - 00:04:28.088, Speaker C: Are you able to see my screen? Yeah.
00:04:28.176 - 00:05:09.868, Speaker B: Okay, good. Thank you so much and that's a great introduction. Bonjour tos and welcome everyone. My name is Jude Kong and I'm the director of the Africa Canada Artificial Intelligence and Data Innovation Consortium. Today I will be sharing some of the work that we have done in my group, helping government and communities in Africa to contain and manage the spirit of COVID-19 as well as in Canada. So I would talk about the estimation of COVID-19 assessment rates across Africa and the drivers of transmission dynamics worldwide in the earlier stage of the dynamics. So focus mostly on that subsequently.
00:05:09.868 - 00:06:34.306, Speaker B: If we do, if Doctor Sekek invite us next time, we'll come and expand the conversation from there. Before I move on with my presentation, I really want to acknowledge my funders, the IDRC and the Swedish International Development Agency. The IDLC is the Canadian International Development Research center who initiated this work and trusted us and supported us to work with communities and government in Africa to control and manage the spread of COVID-19. I will calling one to acknowledge my other funders across Canada, new frontiers and research and SEC, as well as the Black Canadian Scientist Network for the work they are doing to ensure that tables are made for other people to sit on and be able to take part in informing policies within our country. We all know what diversity can bring on the table. As I acknowledge the idea CNC, I would like to acknowledge a team that is leading the work in the nine african countries, across nine african countries as well as Canada, that I've been directing. So I really want to acknowledge them for the great work and for ensuring that they continue to help government and communities to control the spread of COVID-19 address mis and disinformation throughout and they have not stopped and they have continued going forward.
00:06:34.306 - 00:07:02.110, Speaker B: So I really want to acknowledge them and thank them for their amazing job. So they did a great job. I would not be doing a service to myself. I take all this credit without talking about the great team that had gotten the work that I'm just sharing with you today head on, which are my team members, ranging from undergrad students to grad students to postdocs that are my friends. When I say friends, I mean it.
00:07:02.222 - 00:07:04.342, Speaker C: There are people I rely on that.
00:07:04.358 - 00:07:45.146, Speaker B: I can call at any hour and they'll get things done for me and so I want to acknowledge them. Whatever I'm presenting here may look good, but they are behind me. They are the one that did the work. So I really want to thank them. Some of them are not here in this picture since this was taken at a one day picture on Zoom and I've not updated, but there are some of them that are not here, but I really want to acknowledge all of them. This picture just represents some of the team that I work with, that I've been helping to do the work, divesting my work with. And our work actually focused have a foundation in SDG three, health and wellness, SDG five, gender and equality, and SDG 17, which is partnership for the goal.
00:07:45.146 - 00:08:19.742, Speaker B: And that's why we create partnership around the world. The pillars of our work is timely and reliable data for public health decision making. We pride in that resilient and strong and fair health systems. Inclusion and equity for vulnerable groups. Even within Canada, most of our work is centered around the gene and Finch community and other economically disadvantaged communities. So we pride in that and bringing all voices. As you will see in our group, we ensure that the group that we put together represent a country where we find ourselves very diverse.
00:08:19.918 - 00:08:22.470, Speaker C: And what we do is that we.
00:08:22.502 - 00:09:10.928, Speaker B: Look at earlier detection of disease, alia warning systems, earlier response, mitigation and control, while using mathematics as a catalyst to address all these things. Today I will focus on these three components of our work that we have been doing, which is on earlier warning, earlier response and mitigation. But we always acknowledge the fact that for us to solve these disease issues within our community, we need to pay attention to the environment, the animal and humans, and multidisciplinary. And that's why SDG 17 is the major component of one of our foundation. So we look at the one health approach. Why ensuring that we inform policy in whatever we do. There's training across.
00:09:10.928 - 00:09:19.424, Speaker B: That's why we have a lot of students in our team that's working with us producing the results as well as learning from the other ones or from us.
00:09:19.584 - 00:09:23.374, Speaker C: So that's very important to us today.
00:09:23.414 - 00:09:48.998, Speaker B: I want to talk to you about the earlier stage of a disease outbreak, and you may be wondering why the time. I want to tell a story throughout with the next generation mathematicians that will be informed forces in the country. And I want to start my story today by what happened within the pandemic or what mathematicians always do during the alias phase, like we have monkeypox right now.
00:09:49.166 - 00:09:54.166, Speaker C: So that the great next generation mathematicians.
00:09:54.230 - 00:09:56.662, Speaker B: That will be informing policymakers present in.
00:09:56.678 - 00:10:00.646, Speaker C: Our midst here understand the thought process.
00:10:00.750 - 00:10:03.070, Speaker B: That always go into these decisions.
00:10:03.182 - 00:10:05.526, Speaker C: So let's assume we have COVID coming.
00:10:05.550 - 00:10:25.810, Speaker B: To our community as a model like you are behind the scenes, very active, sleepless night policymaker. You rely on what the modular is going to give you. You're out there at the forefront. That's what people know. You saying this, you make them look smart. You model us, they are smart. Our policymakers are smart, but you make them look very smart.
00:10:25.810 - 00:10:29.094, Speaker B: And your goal when a disease comes is always.
00:10:32.554 - 00:10:34.122, Speaker C: What is is it?
00:10:34.258 - 00:10:44.994, Speaker B: What is the basic reproduction number? You always start asking yourself, if I infect, if this disease comes into my community and one person is able to.
00:10:45.034 - 00:10:48.436, Speaker C: Infect more than one person, then the.
00:10:48.460 - 00:11:03.452, Speaker B: Likelihood that that was triggered and spread is high. But if one person can infect less than a human being, then obviously the disease will not spread because one person who is infected into my community will not infect other people.
00:11:03.628 - 00:11:09.996, Speaker C: So you always pay a lot of attention with the early data on the.
00:11:10.020 - 00:12:02.952, Speaker B: Spread to look at what we normally call the basic reproduction number, which is the number of person that an infectious person can infect in a naive population. By naive here means that there's no control measure. Nobody's immune to the disease. And if that value is, we look at, well, if below one means that the person will infect less than one person, it will die. Down above one, it means that the disease will spread. Once we realize that the disease will spread as a cause of COVID then we start asking ourselves, is it going to overwhelm our hospital system, our capacity? Are we going to have enough nurses, enough beds in the hospital to handle the patient that will be coming up? We all have heard about ensuring that we do not. We flatten the curve.
00:12:02.952 - 00:12:09.188, Speaker B: We had Trudeau said this over and over. Let's flatten our curve. When COVID started, the idea there is.
00:12:09.356 - 00:12:10.772, Speaker C: Well, if the growth is such a.
00:12:10.788 - 00:12:17.444, Speaker B: Way, that is going to bypass our capacity. This was to be our capacity. How do we ensure that we slow.
00:12:17.484 - 00:12:21.624, Speaker C: Down the growth rate, but maybe prolong the time?
00:12:21.964 - 00:13:13.622, Speaker B: Ensuring that we do not overwhelm our hospital system? Once we realize that this is something that's going to spread in our community. And this is exactly the thought process that went into our mind once COVID started. And today I'll be sharing with you some of the decisions that we made behind the scenes when COVID started, once COVID started here in Canada, where my mind was, and a lot of the team that we were working together within my lab. So I will talk to you about the earlier response and community based risk mitigation and control of developing epidemics. I will talk to you about estimation of the epidemiological parameters and ascending rates from earlier transmission of COVID across Africa. And now we'll talk about the factors that influence the spread of COVID-19. And then I will share something to you.
00:13:13.622 - 00:13:29.134, Speaker B: It's a secret though, when you hear this, it's a secret. But the reason why I'm sharing this is that we are recruiting a team to work on this earlier warning framework for emerging and reimaging infectious disease. And one of my undergrad student, Kevin.
00:13:29.174 - 00:13:31.474, Speaker C: Has done an amazing job doing this.
00:13:31.514 - 00:14:14.104, Speaker B: And a lot of other team, Zara and the other team within my group, that are working on ensuring that we tap into this data set and I'll be able to share with you, as well as the whole network we have in the country, that I'm leading with some of my colleagues to help ensure that we come up with frameworks that address this issue. I will now move on to start some of the work that we have done, and I will focus on these first two goals here. The alia response and mitigation and control of developing epidemics. And this is where we thought about estimation of epidemiological parameters and ascending rates from earlier transmission. So I'll talk about this component for a while, and I'll move to the other one. When COVID started, if you look at the news.
00:14:16.284 - 00:14:19.564, Speaker C: In the initial outbreak, there were a lot.
00:14:19.604 - 00:14:34.838, Speaker B: I was getting data from african countries, actually. And I was echoing every paper. I had an algorithm that each paper that's published on Google, if getting to Google Scholar that talk about Africa, COVID, I was alerted, I was following this.
00:14:34.886 - 00:14:37.078, Speaker C: Very clearly, and there were a lot.
00:14:37.086 - 00:14:57.746, Speaker B: Of papers that came up wondering why there was a low burden of COVID in Africa. And if you look at the data, here is one of my postdoc plotted the first 14 days that we plotted together here, where if you look at Togo, here it's flat. You look at the South Omega principle. Here they had four cases and then.
00:14:57.770 - 00:15:01.854, Speaker C: Flat for a while, you'll be like the continent itself.
00:15:02.634 - 00:15:48.494, Speaker B: And as we gather in the country here, there was a meeting at the field institute where the tax force for COVID-19 was led. And I attended meeting and I started thinking about the Africa. And I reached out to Hilary and the other people in the Africa citizen, and we thought of a task force together, actually, based on what we're doing here. But at that point in my life, when I saw these articles, what was running in my mind was I thought of my community. I grew up in a very small community here, in a place called Jackie. And when I was growing up at that time, there was one. All of these regions used to have six doctors, six doctors sent by the government.
00:15:48.494 - 00:16:26.126, Speaker B: And Jake alone had one doctor, a very huge area. I even look at NBME, and if you were found in a community case, long distance. It would take five days or so to ever walk, more than that, a week to ever walk to the main center where the hospital was located. But there was one hospital and one doctor. So most of the time, my village, when you grow up and you are sick, you never end up in the hospital, because if you can treat yourself, unless you're dying, that's when they knock doors to carry somebody to a hospital. I remember in my village, again, this is not about Cameroon. Same as in Canada.
00:16:26.126 - 00:17:06.724, Speaker B: When you go to Nona vote and you have different communities. I go in a very small communities. And in my village, we had few people with a car. And when somebody was sick, you need to move around and knock at doors to get someone to carry the person to that general hospital where you had one doctor, and you could go when. If two people were sick at that time, you could go when the person was going to carry the person, and it would take long distance for them to come back. So somebody may die throughout the whole night. So the reason why I thought about this and putting this is that in this community, unless it was really serious, you wouldn't want to go to care about the hospital because it takes a while to get to the hospital, or one, you go to the pharmacy and buy things.
00:17:06.724 - 00:17:17.588, Speaker B: And so when I saw the low rates and knowing that the life expectancy in Africa is less than 65, I was thinking that, well, with the life.
00:17:17.636 - 00:17:21.420, Speaker C: Expectancy being 50 something, the great youth.
00:17:21.452 - 00:17:40.964, Speaker B: Population, and given the system, the healthcare system, nobody knows what is happening. It's not clear that COVID is not spreading. What is clear is that in the former system, that is not recorded. And so we wanted to find out the true case count.
00:17:41.384 - 00:17:44.784, Speaker C: And we started with the basic model.
00:17:44.944 - 00:17:57.552, Speaker B: Which is just a basic susceptible, exposed infectious, asymptomatic and recovered model. But when we had this basic model.
00:17:57.728 - 00:18:00.400, Speaker C: Of people getting exposed, we break down.
00:18:00.432 - 00:18:20.178, Speaker B: The infectious into severe infectious and mild infectious. So in the infectious compartment, this is normally typical asymptomatic. Then we break down the infectious component into the severe infectious and mild infectious, and then everybody recover at different time rates based on the viral load in your system. So again, for normal maticians, we are.
00:18:20.186 - 00:18:22.106, Speaker C: Assuming here that if you get in.
00:18:22.130 - 00:18:32.086, Speaker B: Contact with somebody, there's a chance that you can become infected or you will not. Let's say you wear this blue green guy here, you get in touch with this, you can become red or green. And so that's the chance that leads.
00:18:32.110 - 00:18:34.014, Speaker C: You from s to e, and then.
00:18:34.054 - 00:19:23.910, Speaker B: After e, after a time you become, you become infectious or you just be infectious but asymptomatic when you're not showing symptoms. When you put that in terms of equation, then you assume that, well, the susceptible will be changing based on when they get in contact with people from this group, and then they will move this class into this other class, and then they leave the exposed class after a while, and when they leave the exposed class, they can join one, two, three. The severe infectious, the mild infection are symptomatic. So we divided this into these classes and then after a while they recovered. That's why you have all of these components. And we assume that the infectiousness of these classes are different. People that are more severe has more viral load and so they will infect more.
00:19:23.910 - 00:19:36.694, Speaker B: So that's why the infection is between one and 1.5 of the asymptomatic, the mild cases. And for the asymptomatic, they will be less than the mild cases. So we assume those infectiousness.
00:19:38.474 - 00:19:47.290, Speaker C: Then what we did was we wanted to estimate the basic reproduction number and.
00:19:47.322 - 00:20:04.802, Speaker B: Other parameters, including most importantly, the reporting rate of different cases and the overall reporting rate given the importance of the basic reproduction number. Remember, if it is high, you have an outbreak below one, no outbreak. So we wanted to estimate this for.
00:20:04.818 - 00:20:08.134, Speaker C: The countries to know the level, your true value.
00:20:08.514 - 00:20:39.122, Speaker B: And what we did was that if we assume that Rm fraction of the severe cases, so if you compute the basic reputation you have this, this is the component from the severe, the mild and the symptomatic, then if you just isolate for better here, which is the transmission rate, then you can make the transmission rate a function of the basic reproduction number, then when you assume the fraction that can be reported, there's mild and severe cases, assuming that the asymptomatic cases are not even reported, then if.
00:20:39.138 - 00:20:42.426, Speaker C: You keep count of the total number.
00:20:42.450 - 00:21:48.610, Speaker B: Of incidents that you know, the total number of incidents that you don't know, so CI here will be the ones that we know, and ck here will be the total incidence that the non incident cI is the unknown incident, then you can be able to write this cumulative, the total numbers they're adding on daily basis as a function of this exposed class using this. And so if you now apply this to this equation and integrate it, you could have the total symptomatic as a function of this. If then you apply this to the original equation that we have seen here, if you then apply this and take into account rewriting this in this way, and take into account these reported cases and the basic reproduction number, where the transmission rate now is a function of basic reputation number. We end up in this system of equation that have the reporting rate of the mild and severe cases, as well as the basic reproduction number and the relative infectiousness of each of the class. So, from this, this is the same system just changing this equation based on the fact that we have introduced this.
00:21:48.642 - 00:21:50.842, Speaker C: Guy on this left hand side, and.
00:21:50.858 - 00:22:08.530, Speaker B: Take into account the total number of total number of infectious cases as the onset. Once we had this, the next thing was, can we estimate this from the data that's made available? The data that's made available here will be very important. And I want to relate back to.
00:22:08.562 - 00:22:11.306, Speaker C: Cameroon again, where I grew up in.
00:22:11.330 - 00:22:33.682, Speaker B: Cameroon, when this started, there was a center in Yawning. And I lived in a very small community far away from Yaounde in the capital city. So for cases to live there, to the original center, where this was Santa Pasteur, it will take a while for cases to ever reach Santa Pastel. So the tendency that somebody will be.
00:22:33.698 - 00:22:37.282, Speaker C: Infected and the case will ever reach there takes forever.
00:22:37.338 - 00:22:48.290, Speaker B: So with this one center, and it may not in other cases. And so we thought of, okay, let's get whatever the centers have. We did get locally relevant data from.
00:22:48.322 - 00:22:51.334, Speaker C: These centers from all the 54 countries.
00:22:52.834 - 00:22:54.374, Speaker B: Let's try to.
00:22:55.354 - 00:22:56.866, Speaker C: Well, because we are going to be.
00:22:56.890 - 00:23:38.734, Speaker B: Estimating what we know. So we use accumulated cases of what is given to the centers. We use the reported cases of what is given to the centers. And we calculate this again, this is just a fraction of the maya cases and the proportion of the severe cases. When this is the underreporting rate, the rate at which that is being reported. Can we estimate that rate? Now, the time period that we used was from the initial phase of COVID-19 when there was no major cases, to when maybe cases are less than 40. So we start with the start and end when the cases within 14 days or when the stringency index is still less than 50.
00:23:38.734 - 00:24:03.330, Speaker B: And when we acquired this, then we use Markov chain Monte Carlo method, with delayed rejection adaptive metropolitan algorithm, to estimate the parameters. And then, because we didn't know the initial distribution of these parameters, we use an uninformed prior or uniform distribution. Once we fitted the data to parameters. If you look at here, this is Algeria.
00:24:03.402 - 00:24:05.218, Speaker C: Here we.
00:24:05.306 - 00:24:37.914, Speaker B: And this is same throughout, I think Algeria, because the first country in the continent, actually. But this was sent throughout the entire continent. But what we found out was that the model this capture the data pretty world. And the goodness of this statistic that we use was really decent throughout. If you look at Algeria here, which will be the same throughout here. This red here is the known cases, and then the line is the model cases. And then this shaded region is the 95% high probability density interval.
00:24:37.914 - 00:24:56.464, Speaker B: And then this blue here, actually is the data. The, the data of the incident cases is accumulating. This is the incident cases. So we captured that throughout and it feed really well. We equally estimated the reporting rate. If you look at here, Algeria only reported 1.14% of their cases.
00:24:56.464 - 00:25:10.694, Speaker B: This is just the cumulative known cases. If you look at this bar graph here, that's a ratio here is a compulsion. It's kind of the proportion of this severe, mild, asymptomatic and recovered cases within the population. And the black here is the modeled.
00:25:11.354 - 00:25:14.854, Speaker C: Total cases, that incident cases.
00:25:15.354 - 00:25:47.060, Speaker B: Now, when we look at these, we realize that, well, the total number of actually non cases, the reported cases, far below the cases. So Algeria is not unique in here. I'm not picking Algeria to say Algeria only report 1.14. No, Algeria is the first continent in the continent, but this was clear across the continent. Sudan and Gambia reported collectively. Most with. This could be based on the population of Gambia.
00:25:47.060 - 00:26:01.716, Speaker B: And it's something questionable. Well, not questionable, but it was greater. Sudan reported that questionable. They reported 27 and 22%, respectively, with most reported less than 5% in the entire continent.
00:26:01.820 - 00:26:04.084, Speaker C: Most of the countries then the basic.
00:26:04.124 - 00:26:33.696, Speaker B: Production number, actually with a true reporting value, which, this blue one here, we realized that the true values were based on the estimated actually were 2.02. That's the average across all the countries. With Zambia, the range between Zambia and Nigeria, with Zambia having 1.12 and Nigeria having 3.64. Meaning that one person in Nigeria could infect, on average, 3.64 other persons. And in Zambia, one person will infect 1.12.
00:26:33.696 - 00:26:38.482, Speaker B: But what was more important, my friends and my colleagues, is that if you.
00:26:38.498 - 00:26:41.474, Speaker C: Look at this red here, which is.
00:26:41.514 - 00:26:43.290, Speaker B: Based on the true data that we.
00:26:43.322 - 00:26:46.530, Speaker C: Got, in essence, based on the divisional.
00:26:46.562 - 00:26:49.666, Speaker B: Outbreak, this will indicate that there was no outbreak, because this was not more.
00:26:49.690 - 00:26:58.642, Speaker C: Than one based on a definitional outbreak. But in reality, the true one was 2.02.
00:26:58.818 - 00:27:21.420, Speaker B: So one person, on average, could infect two other persons. But because of the younger population in the continent, and the great strength in the continent, they are able to subdue any hazard that come their way. So they were able to survive this and just keep on striving. I don't know if the consequences may be different. This is not speaking today, whatever COVID may cause in the system, but just.
00:27:21.452 - 00:27:23.620, Speaker C: Saying that their immune system could fight.
00:27:23.652 - 00:27:34.990, Speaker B: It within the specific time. The daily reporting rate. Actually, we estimated that the mean overall daily reporting rate was 5.37. And among all countries with the highest.
00:27:35.022 - 00:27:38.070, Speaker C: Of 30 in Libya, this is Libya here.
00:27:38.102 - 00:28:16.318, Speaker B: This is the overall, the ones that they truly reported. And the lowest in South Omega principe down here, almost reported nothing. And then the estimated mean report rate of severe infections was 38% with the highest. So if you look at this, with the highest being in Cameroon and the lowest in Togo. And the estimated main reported of mild infectious was 13.74% with the highest of 47 in Benin and lowest in Mauritania. Then we went on to look at the overall reporting rate and I want to speak strongly into sub saharan Africa.
00:28:16.318 - 00:28:20.914, Speaker B: If you look at this other sub saharan Africa from living our northern part of Africa.
00:28:21.694 - 00:28:23.526, Speaker C: Okay, let's cut down South Africa from.
00:28:23.550 - 00:28:29.334, Speaker B: Sub saharan Africa a little bit. Not that's what Africa wants to cut out, but let's just leave it out a little bit.
00:28:30.114 - 00:28:32.506, Speaker C: Looking at this middle part here, it.
00:28:32.530 - 00:28:45.334, Speaker B: Speaks more into the healthcare systems. And this speaks more into one of the reasons why I got into research which was looking at my own community and malaria. But this is very important in.
00:28:47.434 - 00:28:47.746, Speaker C: If.
00:28:47.770 - 00:29:55.106, Speaker B: You look deeply into this and you grew up in this sub saharan Africa, grow up in Cameroon, Nigeria is same way. I spend a lot of my time, I live a lot in Nigeria, a lot of these countries around here. The fact that the healthcare system is not well developed, not prepared for what will come in, is as a result of the fact that research in this area has not been decolonized. It speaks to the importance of decolonizing research in this component, because innovation was to be left to the colonial masters and you were just supposed to acquire the basic knowledge and the colonial masses were going to be able to provide for everything. I remember at this point when there was COVID having a meeting with director of Santa Pasteur in Yawonde and most of the Cameroon data was sent to Santa Pasteur, France. And this is the same throughout the continent where we had these meetings with different health units within the countries with Nigeria, CDC to cameroonian Santa Pasteur. This alone have really pushed me to say, how do we work as a.
00:29:55.130 - 00:30:04.002, Speaker C: Team to ensure that, first of all, we are able to work and support.
00:30:04.058 - 00:30:58.710, Speaker B: The healthcare system in east sub saharan Africa to be sustained, working with a team there, homegrown team. And secondly, to ensure that we help researchers work with researchers to get a learning issue that ensure that we build a strong, solid foundation that can address this issue. And that speaks to what my team is looking at at the moment for the proportion of severe and mild asymptomatic cases. If you look at this, you realize that, well, if you look at the rate, this is organized in descending out of these severe cases. But what we find is that the mean estimated were 54.546 for severe infectious, 27 for mild infectious and 66. What you realize is that the proportion of these severe subclinical infections among the other cases, which is just a property of the disease.
00:30:58.710 - 00:31:37.456, Speaker B: Basically, if one look at this, if you were to look at this and compare, and this is not just unique to Africa, this was common. If you look at the literature across the global north as well, if you look at the main relative infectiousness, we realized that with respect to the mild cases, the severe cases have a relative infection of 1.25 and then the asymptomatic 0.44. If you look at this, the ratio of the asymptomatic cases throughout was relatively constant with peak to the characteristics of the disease. So by fitting this simple model, we.
00:31:37.480 - 00:31:45.304, Speaker C: Were able to estimate the true case count across Africa and get the real.
00:31:45.344 - 00:32:18.526, Speaker B: Values, which further help us to inform policies that were to inform policies with the governments that we work with in nine african countries. There are other models that we adjusted going forward. Our model did suggest that the basic reproduction number is higher than actually reported. So means that disease was actually spreading. But in fact it was not reported much more than was reported then. The values that we collected here, as time goes on, Tim, have changed. This is just within the initial phase of the pandemic.
00:32:18.526 - 00:32:54.624, Speaker B: As time goes on. We had adjusted the model when vaccines came in and we have different models, which I will continue the story subsequently. If Doctor Sekek invite me to come back. I want to talk about the second part after we estimated the basic reproduction number. So, which is just the impact of social, economic, environmental factors on the dynamics of COVID-19. So, after we had estimated the basic reproduction number for each local community, we did not just keep this at the national level, we did this for each local community that we were working in.
00:32:56.004 - 00:32:56.980, Speaker C: What we found.
00:32:57.092 - 00:33:15.396, Speaker B: Now look at the data, what I was just presenting station here of South Africa at the aggregate level, looking at the country as it holds. If you look at the South Africa data here, the way it moves up, then let's look at Australia. And Australia is almost similar to South Sudan. That went up straight and came down. And then let's look here at Nigeria.
00:33:15.500 - 00:33:18.376, Speaker C: Which will now be what you will.
00:33:18.400 - 00:33:33.724, Speaker B: Find from here is that at the onset, it evolved differently across countries and across communities. This was not just unique to countries. This was equally with communities across.
00:33:34.064 - 00:33:36.608, Speaker C: So we found out that COVID-19 was.
00:33:36.656 - 00:33:52.914, Speaker B: Evolving differently across countries. And we started wondering within ourselves, once we went into this to be like, well, if this were to be the case, what is really causing this different trajectory. COVID take different trajectory across countries.
00:33:54.694 - 00:33:59.814, Speaker C: We hypothesized that demographic, clinical, health systems.
00:33:59.934 - 00:34:23.056, Speaker B: Social and environmental factors had something to do with it. But we had to be sure about that in order to conclude that. And we talked strongly about the policies that different government may have put in place. And the thought process was that if we said that the policies put in.
00:34:23.080 - 00:34:28.920, Speaker C: Place caused that, then indirectly that lead to indigeneity.
00:34:29.032 - 00:34:33.464, Speaker B: Because the policies were in response to.
00:34:33.504 - 00:34:37.155, Speaker C: The initial structures, I don't know.
00:34:37.179 - 00:35:09.364, Speaker B: One can argue. So if the policy were response to nature trajectory, therefore, we cannot assume that the policies actually were the one that caused the tragedy, because the tragedy caused the policies. And so we went on to study if these factors were responsible. So we collected a huge lot of different demographic diseases, economic, environmental and social variables which are present. Some of them here. Population of ages, 25 youths. Mortality rate from lower respiratory infectious disease.
00:35:09.364 - 00:35:37.066, Speaker B: Mortality rate for infectious and parasitic disease. We look at the Gini index, the ease of doing business. We look at temperature, we look at precipitation, we look at air pollution. We look at average people use of social media to organize offline action. We look at Internet filtering, we look at air transport. And in order to analyze this, given that we had an output, what we.
00:35:37.090 - 00:35:41.614, Speaker C: Did was that we use a generalized adjective model.
00:35:42.674 - 00:35:58.422, Speaker B: And if you think of a generalized adjective model, think of that linear model, where if you think of equation of straight line y equals mx plus c, you think of this in this form. But now, or a regression model, but this is not a function. A nonlinear function could be an in linear function.
00:35:58.518 - 00:36:01.526, Speaker C: And then the output here is the.
00:36:01.550 - 00:36:17.190, Speaker B: Output that we're looking at, function of the output. And then these are the error term that you're modeling. And this is. This is a strictly parametric component of the model, which you could think of as the intersect in a straight line. We equally assume that there are random.
00:36:17.262 - 00:36:21.266, Speaker C: Effects that may have caused the spread.
00:36:21.430 - 00:36:27.906, Speaker B: To take the dimension I took meaning that the fact that you're from Asia or close to China, or the fact.
00:36:27.930 - 00:36:32.314, Speaker C: That you're from North America, the way.
00:36:32.354 - 00:36:34.066, Speaker B: The spreading rate may have taken, maybe.
00:36:34.090 - 00:36:36.082, Speaker C: Based on your region proximity.
00:36:36.138 - 00:37:20.940, Speaker B: So we took that as a random effect. The total number of days from when China had their first case to when you had their from the total number of days to the first 30 case, from when China had their 1st 30 case. We equally took that as a random effect, and the gross domestic product was equally taken at random effect as well as we calculated the average underreporting across countries and took that as a random effect that could have affected that initial tragedy. When we fitted the model to data we identified, we realized that our model, first of all, had a high explanatory power and predictability of 75%. And we identified these four major variables.
00:37:21.052 - 00:37:23.772, Speaker C: As having a high impact on it.
00:37:23.828 - 00:38:25.202, Speaker B: And so I will now talk about these four variables, which was the youth, the gene inequality, the number of people living in city agglomerates, and the use of social media to organize offline action. I will start with the social media to organize online action. Again, this analysis is an on face of COVID-19. But what we realized based on the social media that a lot of us from the Africa Canada artificial intelligence and data innovation consortium belonged to, was that in the absence of scientifically informed information, there were a lot of false information that was spreading in social media, belonged to a lot of different Nigeria, Cameroon and other countries social media group. With all of these spreading, even canadian groups. But in order not to empower politicians to say that we were blaming social media, we wanted to be very clear.
00:38:25.258 - 00:38:30.094, Speaker C: That social media may have been used to spread this information.
00:38:30.434 - 00:39:07.056, Speaker B: But in the presence of scientifically information, we do believe that social media will play a very positive role. Because if you look at this as the use of social media to organize online action increased, there was an increase in spreading rates. But we did say that, well, we hope that when scientifically informed information become available, that will not be the case. Another variable that was really that came out to be very impactful or significant was the youth between the ages of 20 and 35. Our interpretation of that was that if.
00:39:07.080 - 00:39:10.864, Speaker C: You have a huge youth population, even.
00:39:10.904 - 00:39:45.964, Speaker B: Though they increase the spreading rate, they equally confer resilience against the disease. If you have a high old population, they will be more susceptible to disease, but they will exhibit a reduced transmission rate. And so when you take the synergistic result, you will realize that the intermediate level of youth will lead to a higher spreading rate of COVID-19. Another one that stood out was a genie inequality. And this was meaningful to us in the sense that if you have countries with a high gini inequality.
00:39:47.704 - 00:39:48.296, Speaker C: This refers.
00:39:48.320 - 00:40:15.268, Speaker B: To the income inequality, then there is physical segregation. And thus this may have initially prevented the spread of COVID-19. Because of this physical segregation. I don't know if that should be a thing to exist, but that may have been it. If you look at country with a larger inequality, it means that there are better social integrations, fewer people are left behind. That's what we want. And so that may have led to a lower spreading rate.
00:40:15.268 - 00:40:33.320, Speaker B: And that's why we have this. One thing that we equally find was number of people in city agromerates, where we realized that, well, the higher number of people living in city, because a huge population coming in touch, in contact with each other, the higher the spreading rate. What we could not explain from our.
00:40:33.352 - 00:40:38.688, Speaker C: Results was this behavior here, this u ten behavior.
00:40:38.816 - 00:41:30.490, Speaker B: And so it was difficult to explain why a lower number of people living in the city could lead to that. So we could not explain that as well. So the conclusion here was that we strongly emphasized within my team that this is at a country level, even though we did for local level within the communities. And so without looking at correcting for temporal strength and reporting a mortality rate, this cannot be generalized to local communities within the country. With the work that we did. Even though we sacrifice these local realities, a work like ours can be used to inform policies going forward. We strongly emphasize that the basic reproduction number is not an indicative of the eventual outbreak sizes or the nature of the subsequent waves.
00:41:30.490 - 00:41:36.130, Speaker B: And this will speak strongly to South Korea, where you realize at the onset.
00:41:36.162 - 00:41:39.130, Speaker C: That there was a spike going up.
00:41:39.162 - 00:41:58.888, Speaker B: Straight in South Korea. And it came down and that did not speak. So they have the high r naught value basic precision number. But that doesn't transfer to the total number of people that will be infected or the eventual outbreak size. Now, the factors that influence are not.
00:41:58.976 - 00:42:02.792, Speaker C: The basic production number that we identify.
00:42:02.888 - 00:42:31.354, Speaker B: Here reflect the naive or the interesting factors that may determine the country's vulnerability to COVID-19. And this is very important going forward with mutant strengths coming up here and there. Again, these values here. At that point, assuming that there were conditions put in place. Because these are basically position, no matter control reproduction number if certainties end up being lifted.
00:42:32.374 - 00:42:34.710, Speaker C: Now that we have people are trying.
00:42:34.742 - 00:42:59.244, Speaker B: To social distance, wearing their masks. If all of these get lifted and things go back to normal, then those country characteristics will still control the dynamics. In a similar way. We did further went on to study this and realize that that was the case with the second wave. This study aims to inform the ongoing control of the pandemic, actually. And we hope that our result can be useful from here. I want to talk now about.
00:42:59.244 - 00:43:30.078, Speaker B: You realize that we started from these two. Starting a new faculty. We're now moving backwards. I want to talk about warning systems for emerging and reimaging infectious disease. We are building a team on this and welcome a lot of people joining us. We are currently, with my colleague John Lee Ma, lead a network within the country. And we want to add as many people as this, and people are willing to help us organize workshop in this earlier warning system.
00:43:30.078 - 00:43:34.738, Speaker B: Since I'm talking to the next generation scientists to join us in this, I.
00:43:34.746 - 00:43:37.218, Speaker C: Will share what within my lab, we.
00:43:37.226 - 00:44:01.090, Speaker B: Have been able to do. Subsequently, we will come here to share the work that as a network within Canada, we have been able to do. But I just want to speak to the great scientists that we have here, that we are looking for a team. We are building a team on this earlier warning frameworks because it's very important that we know that this is going to occur before it occur. So what exists in the country right now, or what is being used around.
00:44:01.122 - 00:44:08.830, Speaker C: The world in order to be able to. The idea here, is there a way.
00:44:08.862 - 00:44:10.686, Speaker B: To determine that something like COVID-19 is.
00:44:10.710 - 00:44:13.286, Speaker C: Going to happen before it happens or.
00:44:13.310 - 00:44:47.254, Speaker B: Any other disease could be a local outbreak? So far, right now, there are two popular platforms that are used. One is the promit, which is a program for monitoring emerging diseases. And this is the official platform for the International Society for Infectious Diseases. And the way this platform work is they have volunteers within their platform, and these volunteers that 30,000 of them also, they observe, they monitor things in different levels and then send emails if they start suspecting anything.
00:44:47.554 - 00:44:49.946, Speaker C: And then there is somebody that look.
00:44:49.970 - 00:45:58.574, Speaker B: At the emails and work with the system to verify the authenticity of that particular email. One that I'm so equally proud of is the one that was developed here in Canada, the global public health intelligence network for earlier warning outbreak, Giffen, which is by the Public Health Agency of Canada, so proud. And they provide 40% of the world health warning outbreak information. And the way different work is that, again, it was created in the 1990s, different collect all news reported in local communities. So for instance, if you grew up in typical communities in Abuja or Calabam, and they are reporting a typical outbreak in Calabar in Nigeria, Jifan will collect that news. And then if you continue a lot of local news articles are reporting that, then they have the agency maybe working with who to verify that. And they do it for all languages in the WHO.
00:45:58.574 - 00:46:33.320, Speaker B: But the thing about this is that one could speak into why they didn't predict COVID and Bluetooth could take credit for. Oh, we predicted COVID before COVID happened blue dot using from it and why don't you have us here as one of the top this thing that could speak strongly and blue Dot could attack us for that. But we could talk about Blue Dot later and other groups that exist. There are other ones not ignoring them, but these are two major ones. These two major ones are not public system. Our hope so far was can we come up with something that's public where.
00:46:33.352 - 00:46:39.976, Speaker C: Everybody contributes starting at the level of Canada and we are building together with.
00:46:40.000 - 00:46:42.664, Speaker B: My colleague John Lima building a team on this.
00:46:44.884 - 00:46:45.944, Speaker C: Can we.
00:46:48.004 - 00:46:50.144, Speaker B: Different rely on news article.
00:46:52.764 - 00:46:56.544, Speaker C: Prominently rely on citizen scientists?
00:46:57.644 - 00:47:02.380, Speaker B: Our hope is to combine that and with the team that have worked in these groups which we have in our.
00:47:02.412 - 00:47:07.998, Speaker C: Network and equally mine, Google searches, social.
00:47:08.046 - 00:47:12.886, Speaker B: Media and newspaper articles to combine all these signals to see if we can.
00:47:12.910 - 00:47:16.326, Speaker C: Be able to predict the outbreak of.
00:47:16.350 - 00:47:40.394, Speaker B: A new disease before. So far we have been working on this as a network, but I will share some of the work that we have done on emerging diseases with you. I will come here subsequently to share our work on earlier warning system with the workshop that we have coming up at the field institute in granted, but today I want to share with you what we are trying to do. What we are doing is that we want to look at the newspaper articles.
00:47:40.434 - 00:47:45.094, Speaker C: Online, Facebook, Twitter, other social media platform.
00:47:45.434 - 00:47:53.826, Speaker B: Google searches for re emerging diseases that already exist. We want to keep on monitoring them.
00:47:53.890 - 00:47:58.066, Speaker C: In real time and collect different metrics.
00:47:58.130 - 00:48:02.268, Speaker B: From different platforms, then trained an AI.
00:48:02.316 - 00:48:04.900, Speaker C: Algorithm to see if they can predict.
00:48:04.932 - 00:48:16.024, Speaker B: It before a disease occur. As an example of the metrics that we are collecting from the different social media platform, let me talk about Twitter here. For the sake of time, I'm going to talk about.
00:48:17.804 - 00:48:18.396, Speaker C: Twitter.
00:48:18.460 - 00:48:45.022, Speaker B: I may not talk about Facebook and the other ones that we're using on newspaper or the blogs. Let me talk about Google searches here. But we are collecting this from all the social media platform across. But I will just talk about Google searches here. In Google searches here. Through a systematic review and checking online, we have came to. We have come to a conclusion that the ratio of seven days average to.
00:48:45.038 - 00:48:47.502, Speaker C: The entire period, and the rate of.
00:48:47.518 - 00:48:55.326, Speaker B: Searches, the rate of spike of searches and the concurrency of these searches could be important metrics that can predict if a disease that had occurred in the.
00:48:55.350 - 00:48:58.462, Speaker C: Past is going to occur again from Tito.
00:48:58.478 - 00:49:02.474, Speaker B: Again, we're getting disease goggles such as. But this will be in a combination with other signals.
00:49:02.894 - 00:49:06.950, Speaker C: So even though Gogo scaled this as.
00:49:07.022 - 00:50:03.356, Speaker B: 100 per country and based on level of country, this is not affected by those because this is just the ratio of these searches to the period of that particular disease and then the spike of that searches and the concavity, whether is it decreasing or increasing. So we have done this for different emerging diseases across different regions. And this is, we update this dynamically every day in our, if you go to the Africa Canada Artificial Intelligence and data Innovation consulting website, you find this being updated on daily basis. And this institution here in Ghana, and this is monkeypox, for instance, we have malaria. We have other things. If you will look at our, if you go to our website, you see here the seven to 180 ratio, the linear and quadratic. The seven to 180 ratio is based on the assumption earlier on when we started with flu, which has a periodicity of six months and have a year, and then we were just like, okay, in the last seven days compared to.
00:50:03.380 - 00:50:07.424, Speaker C: The period before, how have the searches spiked?
00:50:09.964 - 00:50:31.304, Speaker B: The linear here is the spike, the rate of which is spiking irrespective of how Google card is, how many people are searching this. If you look at this within monkeypox, we need time here. I used this long ago. But if you look at our website, you will see the one for today. We update this in real time. We have made the algorithm to be in real time. So Google will spike here.
00:50:32.124 - 00:50:32.820, Speaker C: How is the spike?
00:50:32.852 - 00:51:04.216, Speaker B: And the quadratic one is, is it increasing or tending to be decreasing, convex or concave? So when you look at this, the color intensity will, based on that. So through this we'll be able to know if a disease is coming up in a particular location in the world. Since we update this in real time. The advantage with Google topics instead of keywords is that it's not language sensitive. The question could be around other platforms that are not Google in other countries. We'll get there. We have not integrated other platform, Nongod platform for now.
00:51:04.216 - 00:51:40.090, Speaker B: We have used Twitter and other social media that popular within global north here and global south. And we are using Google for now. What I'm sharing with you is Google, as well as the other blogs that we're checking here, is looking at the linear part, which is a spike. And this is on Monkeypox. Actually, if you look at the color intensity here with varying, and this will be based on how many people are searching, this is increasing, or is this, what is the slope? So that's by the rate. So we use an exponential growth model order to estimate this within a short time, looking at the seven day average. And this is same with, um, the quadratic, which is okay at the stage.
00:51:40.090 - 00:52:28.804, Speaker B: It's going to be turning downward or it comes, is it going upward? Are they, am I checking this at the point when they're about to be going downward so that I feel that it's coming down or not? So this gives us some matrices and an indication of what is happening with a particular disease. How are we going to move from here to a disease that have never occurred? Currently, right now, we have identified different keywords, and thanks to a lot of my students, I want to thank Kevin, who is here with us present, who did an amazing job on this, and I've identified these keywords. We have checked different keywords for different diseases across the world. And the idea would be, what do people say? Once we get, we have all these platforms for different diseases, we want to be able to go backwards, which we have started doing, to say.
00:52:30.704 - 00:52:31.184, Speaker C: Can we.
00:52:31.224 - 00:53:25.208, Speaker B: Train a model that will be able to predict an emerging disease based on those keywords? Which is something we're almost getting there. We did that for COVID-19 and we have been able to see that we could use what we have for Twitter, for Google searches and predict COVID-19. But we want to be able to generalize this for us to come online and say, we already have a framework that can predict any disease or call any emerging disease. We want to be sure that we have tested to all other diseases, especially the three pandemics that we had, serious pandemics that we've had in history or generation. And so we are in the process of doing that, and we are working towards that. But right now, what I wanted to show to you here is just a hint into the metrics and the approach that we are using to build this AI powered toolkit that will be able to predict disease in real time. If you check our platform right now, we made this one go public.
00:53:25.208 - 00:54:01.494, Speaker B: You will see this occurring in real time on a daily basis. And this is done by one of my undergrad student, Kevin, who's working so hard on it. This is a team that I'm working with in the entire country and is led by myself and John Lima, who's present here. And we will be moving, not just in Africa, to build the global south. So subsequently, we'll be announcing a new network, which is the global south artificial intelligence for pandemic and epidemic preparedness network. And we welcome everyone here to join the team that will be working on this. This will involve a lot of teams in South America and the Caribbean, Africa, North Africa, and the arab world, as well as Asia.
00:54:01.494 - 00:54:04.714, Speaker B: So we move into that. I really want to thank you. And Mesi Bukwa too.
00:54:07.054 - 00:54:11.694, Speaker A: Thank you very much for this great talk, great ideas that you shared with us.
