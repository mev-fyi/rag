00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.542, Speaker A: It's time. Yes. So please start the recording. Thank you. Yes. So this is the second lecture of Alexander Lichak on CAD case spaces.
00:00:12.598 - 00:00:50.290, Speaker B: Please go ahead. Thank you very much. So I continue where I had to stop last time. So we continue with examples, examples of, of spaces with curvature bound above. And so the main, probably the main example. So after the space of constant curvature, complete Germanian manifolds. And so the theorem which I not going to prove.
00:00:50.290 - 00:01:05.046, Speaker B: So it's essentially Rao. It's essentially the comparison theorem of Rauch. So it tells us that a complete Germanian manifold is cut k in the sense I have defined if and only if the sectional curvature of all planes.
00:01:05.230 - 00:01:07.154, Speaker C: Is at most kappa.
00:01:07.654 - 00:01:28.444, Speaker B: So this is a local condition. And then there is a global condition. And the global condition is that the injectivity radius is at least as large as in the space of constant curvature. Kappa. Yeah. They simply connected space. So in the case of non positive kappa, it means that deductivity radius is.
00:01:28.484 - 00:01:31.580, Speaker C: Infinite and equal to one.
00:01:31.612 - 00:02:13.894, Speaker B: It means injective is at least nine. So for kappa, not non positive. So for kappa at most. So for kappa zero or minus one, the condition on the injectivity radius is equivalent to the statement that the fundamental group is trivial. This is a version of the theorem of Quantin Adama that I have already mentioned. So essentially, it tells us that if we have a complete remaining manifolds of non positive, complete remaining manifold of non positive curvature, if we take its universal covering, then it is a cut zero space. So this is one of the main plots for examples.
00:02:13.894 - 00:02:19.524, Speaker B: And now we can use this class to.
00:02:19.824 - 00:02:20.644, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:21.184 - 00:02:57.544, Speaker B: To obtain much more examples as follows. First of all, closed convex subsets of cut kappa space as a cut kappa. This is obvious. Then if we take, if we have two cut zero spaces, then we can take their product and still cut zero. And here's the connection between cut one and cut zero. If we take a space and cone it off, so take the euclidean cone over it, then it's got zero if and only if the space over which you take. So pitch your cone off is cut one.
00:02:57.544 - 00:03:02.452, Speaker B: So probably you have.
00:03:02.508 - 00:03:02.900, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:02.972 - 00:03:20.264, Speaker B: So most of you have seen these examples, so slightly more sophisticated example. So trees are cut kappa for every k, for every kappa. So they are the cut minus infinity spaces. So here I saw a tree.
00:03:22.924 - 00:03:23.380, Speaker C: And.
00:03:23.452 - 00:04:12.974, Speaker B: The tree is essentially so possibly infinite, gluing of segments along points, and more generally. So the theorem of rezzetnac, which was the last thing I have stated last time, it allows us to glue spaces. So we can start with euclidean building blocks. Sorry. So we can start with convex axis of euclidean plane, say take a circle and glue it along a pore into an interval, and then glue it along a point to a square, and then glue this one along a segment to something else, which is flat. And we can continue in this fashion.
00:04:14.114 - 00:04:18.698, Speaker C: To obtain my spaces, which look very.
00:04:18.746 - 00:04:20.414, Speaker B: Far from being manifolds.
00:04:24.074 - 00:04:28.514, Speaker C: So another example which.
00:04:28.674 - 00:05:19.204, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It is not very large class, for example, but it is again the very basic of the theory. So, Jordan domains of polygons in r two s. So whenever we take a polygon, maybe convex or not, if we consider so what is inside of this polygon and consider it with its intrinsic structure, then it is a cad zero space. And you prove it by subdividing this polygon into triangles. Using that each triangle is convex and two, so it's cut zero and the whole polygon is obtained by gluing of these triangles. And so the main, maybe.
00:05:19.204 - 00:05:39.034, Speaker B: So the first non trivial example is the example of a non convex quadrangle, which we have started this with. And so with quadrangle. So if we see the boundary of this quadrangle, then it is a triangle.
00:05:39.734 - 00:05:40.474, Speaker C: So.
00:05:44.414 - 00:06:14.084, Speaker B: If you consider this quadrangle within itself, so then its boundary is a triangle. So the shortest connection between y and z is this broken line. And so the statement that this space has cut zero, it means exactly that. This triangle is thin. And this was Alexander of Slemmer. So one of its versions, every version, two of it.
00:06:15.264 - 00:06:16.644, Speaker C: So is it.
00:06:21.104 - 00:06:45.368, Speaker B: Is the connection to Alexander of Zlema clear? This was important to me. There seemed to be no questions. Okay, so then a very important operation is. So the cut condition. So it's condition about four points. So any metric. So any limiting operation for spaces usually preserves.
00:06:45.368 - 00:07:20.816, Speaker B: So finite finite distances. And it's a closed condition. So in any reasonable sense, a limit of kat kappa space is kad kappa. So gram of Hausdorff limit, ultra limit and so on. So, and using this and the example about polygons, one can prove solar the theorem of bishop. So, saying that if we take any Jordan domain in the euclidean plane, so, and this curve might be very complicated. So something like a coal snowflake.
00:07:20.816 - 00:07:24.244, Speaker B: So then what is inside is cut is concealed.
00:07:28.864 - 00:07:29.844, Speaker C: Questions?
00:07:36.664 - 00:08:18.124, Speaker B: So now I have a question. Does it follow from what we did already? Which one? The last one about Jordan domains? Yes, more or less. So you can. So if you forget about details, then essentially you can write any Jordan domain as a limit of polygons which are inside of it. Okay? And so you prove it first for the polygons so for the Jordan polygons and then you use some limiting procedure to reduce it for the limit.
00:08:18.624 - 00:08:19.200, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:08:19.232 - 00:08:23.672, Speaker B: So there are some details, but this.
00:08:23.688 - 00:08:35.454, Speaker C: Is essentially the proof. Okay, maybe a related question. So I missed. In what sense are you talking about limits of these kappa spaces?
00:08:35.534 - 00:08:56.994, Speaker B: Yeah, so I have not been precise. So for instance you can say gromov Hausdoflimon. So any gramophaus of limit of cut kappa spaces, but also more general limits. So any ultra limit of cut kappa spaces is kadkapa. So here for the Jordan domain. So you can, you can go along with pointed gram of hamstrings.
00:08:58.374 - 00:08:59.514, Speaker C: Okay, thank you.
00:09:02.384 - 00:09:52.254, Speaker B: Okay, so the next, so now I will mention some more sophisticated examples. So I will not go into details here, but just I would like to say that the examples are numeral. So the space of a two maps, if you have a quad zero space and for any matter space, the space of a two maps into this casino space is itself cadzero. And so some other large spaces. So space of all remaining metrics, space of keller potentials width. So I don't want to say what the metric is but so they can be naturally equipped with a consider on it. And so it plays in particular in the case of Keller potentials and force plays an important role.
00:09:52.254 - 00:10:12.726, Speaker B: If you already have a cut zero space then within this or cut kappa space you find a lot of other cut kappa spaces. So for instance convex one, but also some non convex one. So for instance the case of rule surfaces.
00:10:12.790 - 00:10:18.678, Speaker C: So you take two curves and connect points on it by geologics.
00:10:18.766 - 00:10:52.450, Speaker B: And as in the euclidean uh, space at this shield surface, uh, is known is. Yeah, it inherits the upper curvature bound from the ambient space. So one has to be careful by, by saying what uh, how you measure the metric. But uh. Yeah, I don't want to specify this. So this is in fact. So this is due to Alexander and so minimal discs.
00:10:52.450 - 00:11:07.682, Speaker B: So this is due to me the version of it by myself Wenger. And then there are many more constructions. So wolf products. I will just mention here some names.
00:11:07.858 - 00:11:15.562, Speaker C: Alexander and Bishop subsets with bound second fundamental form.
00:11:15.618 - 00:11:46.740, Speaker B: So you have some kind of gauss equation in a weak form. And so if your subspace is not, is not too far from being convex then you get an upper curvature bound subsets. So it's again a bishop and myself. Then you can have, you can control conformal changes. This is due to myself and some more. Okay. I don't want to maybe to spend too much time on this example.
00:11:46.740 - 00:12:10.914, Speaker B: So if you have some questions then, yeah, I have just a comment. This is theo fact that l two space of maps in the NPC or kazu. I learned from yoast, so it's not a result of mine. Okay, sorry. Yeah, yeah, I think it's all. Yeah, it's also Korea vaccine. So they already maybe also have this.
00:12:10.914 - 00:12:14.974, Speaker B: Yeah, cory bash. Yeah, sorry. So, yeah.
00:12:16.954 - 00:12:19.054, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks.
00:12:20.834 - 00:12:31.850, Speaker B: Okay, so now we change the sub. So now we start with the second lecture properly. So.
00:12:32.002 - 00:12:40.988, Speaker C: And. Okay, so what I would like to.
00:12:41.186 - 00:13:17.834, Speaker B: Talk about now is another very important theorem of rezzitnac. In this context, it's so called majorization theorem. So, it is a theorem characterizing at zero spaces. And what is important about this theorem? So, in order to check that if you. Okay, so it's a theory about cut spaces, but it's also a possibility to check itself. Something is a cut space. So what is the statement? So, if you have a complete drodesic space, then it is cut zero if and only if.
00:13:17.834 - 00:13:49.894, Speaker B: So any closed rectifiable curve is marginalized by a convex subset in two reals. What does this mean? So, if you have this curve gamma in your space x, then the statement is. So, if your space is called zero, then you find a convex subset in two reals, this convex subset c, and which has a boundary changing out by o.
00:13:51.594 - 00:13:52.454, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:14:08.254 - 00:14:31.226, Speaker B: Something like. Something happened with my screen. Okay, so you have this convex subset c with boundary large gamma.
00:14:31.290 - 00:14:38.294, Speaker C: And you have one Lipschitz map, one lipschitz from c.
00:14:40.634 - 00:15:19.274, Speaker B: Into your space x. So this is inside of x such that. So call this map f such that f maps unknown. Sorry, something is wrong with my. Okay, and you have. You have a map f from. So, the restriction of this map to large gamma is arc length preserving.
00:15:22.444 - 00:15:24.024, Speaker C: Arc length preserve.
00:15:25.164 - 00:15:42.144, Speaker B: So in particular. In particular. So you get some kind of. So the image of this, what is inside of gamma is some. Some disk. So some singular disk which you find.
00:15:42.524 - 00:15:47.124, Speaker C: Inside of your curve gamma.
00:15:48.664 - 00:16:04.684, Speaker B: So that's the statement. And to see that this. So it tells you, in a sense, that every curve in your quad zero space is not thicker than a curve in.
00:16:05.824 - 00:16:09.760, Speaker C: In a plane, then the boundary of.
00:16:09.792 - 00:16:17.334, Speaker B: Some convex subset in a plane. And so to see the. So it's very easy to see.
00:16:18.474 - 00:16:21.962, Speaker C: To see the. So this is an.
00:16:22.058 - 00:16:52.914, Speaker B: This is an if and only if question. This is an if and only if statement. I'm sorry. So something is wrong with my. With my tools meant that. Just a second. I will probably.
00:16:55.054 - 00:16:58.166, Speaker C: Need to restart.
00:16:58.310 - 00:17:02.234, Speaker B: Oh, it's working, but not completely.
00:17:09.474 - 00:17:10.170, Speaker C: No.
00:17:10.322 - 00:17:17.214, Speaker B: Sorry. Okay, just a moment.
00:17:24.074 - 00:17:25.014, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:17:50.773 - 00:17:59.454, Speaker B: I still cannot really write. I cannot even.
00:18:06.434 - 00:18:09.294, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know.
00:18:10.034 - 00:18:46.346, Speaker B: I. I can write, but I can delete what I write, which is even worse. I don't know what to do with it. I'm very sorry. Yeah.
00:18:46.410 - 00:18:50.442, Speaker A: You want to try rebooting your device or whatever you're using there, maybe?
00:18:50.538 - 00:18:53.934, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I tried that. Yeah. Sorry.
00:18:54.274 - 00:19:02.930, Speaker A: I don't know what else. You have a tablet or.
00:19:03.082 - 00:20:34.888, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a tablet. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. What? Okay. Yeah, I can. What I can do.
00:20:34.888 - 00:21:03.344, Speaker B: I can. I can try this. I can stop this. Okay, now I try that again. Maybe that's better. Okay, let us try again. Okay.
00:21:08.044 - 00:21:08.564, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:08.644 - 00:21:22.284, Speaker B: So now it seems to work. Okay, so maybe just one more word about the theorem of the chetnak. So the. The easier statement that this.
00:21:22.324 - 00:21:24.704, Speaker A: Sorry, do you want to go to full screen there?
00:21:25.444 - 00:21:26.780, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I want you.
00:21:26.932 - 00:21:27.824, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:21:28.724 - 00:21:48.396, Speaker B: So the statement that this condition is sufficient. So if you have the state, if you. If any closed curve is marginalized by a convex subset of r two, then your space is cut zero. This is very easy to prove.
00:21:48.460 - 00:21:55.268, Speaker C: So if you have a triangle, and.
00:21:55.316 - 00:22:42.442, Speaker B: Then the statement is that this triangle is marginalized by some euclidean triangle, by some convex set. So this convex set. So you have here some convex set in r two. And you must have one Lipschitz map from this convex set into your space x, such that on the boundary, this is arc length preserving. Since it's arc length preserving on the boundary, it must. So the path which is sent on each geodesic must be a geodesic itself. So this already implies that this convex subset, marginal triangle, must be itself a triangle.
00:22:42.442 - 00:23:03.994, Speaker B: And now the statement that you have here, one dibsc map, this immediately shows that from any point, from any point p here, from any point, p square, new square p. So if you take this connection, if you take a connection.
00:23:04.334 - 00:23:07.582, Speaker C: On the left, then it is mapped.
00:23:07.718 - 00:23:10.718, Speaker B: Into some curve on the left, which.
00:23:10.766 - 00:23:13.190, Speaker C: Has a shorter length.
00:23:13.302 - 00:23:17.714, Speaker B: And so the distance between p and q is not larger than distant.
00:23:19.894 - 00:23:20.634, Speaker C: P.
00:23:21.294 - 00:23:22.674, Speaker B: Prime and q prime.
00:23:25.134 - 00:23:25.614, Speaker C: So.
00:23:25.694 - 00:23:37.334, Speaker B: And this statement is also related to the disclosure. So it should resemble you of the third point in Alexander's lemma, which I mentioned last time.
00:23:40.514 - 00:23:43.454, Speaker C: Ok, so now.
00:23:48.674 - 00:24:15.504, Speaker B: Several characterizations of zero spaces. So again, what I have said. So, a version of theorem of a shet Nac holds for all kappas. And also the characterizations, they are also true. So similar characterizations are true for all kappa. So the following are equivalent. The space is quad zero sum of.
00:24:15.544 - 00:24:20.684, Speaker C: Angles in any triangle is at most PI.
00:24:21.664 - 00:24:58.302, Speaker B: This is due to Alexandrov in the. So in the first. So in the paper where he has defined what cut is. So, he already proved this result. So what we already have seen is that in a cate zero space, all angles are not larger than the angles in the comparison space in the comparison triangle. So any angle in X is not larger than the corresponding angle in the triangle in two reals. So since the sum of angles in r two is PI, sum of angles in your triangle is at most PI.
00:24:58.302 - 00:25:51.774, Speaker B: So, but the conditions also sufficient for being consumer. Another version is the majorization theorem of Richek, which we have seen on the previous page. Another version. So this is a related version of this statement. So a kind of integral version of this miniaturization theorem. It's due to myself and Stefan Wenger. So, the statement of the theorem of Eschegnacht is that any closed curve so is as thin as some curve in the euclidean plane.
00:25:51.774 - 00:26:44.422, Speaker B: And from this you could easily deduce that any that you can feel any closed curve by a disk whose area is at most the area of the corresponding convex subset in r two. And then using there as a parametric connect quality in two reals, you get that this condition is necessary, but it's also sufficient. So if you know that you can fill any curve in the same. So by disk which has small enough area value, space is considered, then there is some nice four point conditions. So if for any four points, the sum, this sum of two diagonals squared is at most. So it's a parallelogram inequality. So then, so this holds it only if your space is quad zero.
00:26:44.478 - 00:26:47.754, Speaker C: This is due to Biac and Nikolayev.
00:26:50.434 - 00:27:14.834, Speaker B: And finally, I would like to mention is a version of the theorem of Kirchbraun, which I have mentioned last time. This statement is due to Lange schroeder.
00:27:14.874 - 00:27:15.194, Speaker C: So.
00:27:15.274 - 00:27:21.784, Speaker B: And the statement is so that for any. So if you have any subset in rn and any one Lipschitz map from.
00:27:21.824 - 00:27:25.424, Speaker C: A to your space, then you can.
00:27:25.464 - 00:27:57.338, Speaker B: Extend it to Evan Lipschitz map of all of rn. So this is so that this is sufficient. You can see by just applying the case of three points. And so, sending x to x, sending x bar to x, y bar to y, z bar to z. And then if you have the extension, then the euclidean triangle must be met.
00:27:57.426 - 00:28:00.698, Speaker C: In one lipstick way.
00:28:00.746 - 00:28:03.770, Speaker B: So this is also closely related to.
00:28:03.802 - 00:28:05.690, Speaker C: The theorem of the shiknax.
00:28:05.722 - 00:28:13.294, Speaker B: So using this, it's easy to prove the majorization theorem of fish.
00:28:14.634 - 00:28:19.042, Speaker C: Okay, so are there questions to this?
00:28:19.138 - 00:28:23.408, Speaker A: There is a question. Somebody is asking if a should be convex? No, it shouldn't.
00:28:23.546 - 00:28:46.944, Speaker B: No, no, no. So it's, so it's easy to see that. So to prove it for all a, it's enough to prove it for finitely many points. So it's actually a statement about finitely many points. So if you have defined so, and the statement is. So if you, if you can define it on finitely many points, then you can extend it to one point more.
00:28:48.244 - 00:28:48.984, Speaker C: So.
00:28:50.804 - 00:29:05.684, Speaker B: By trying to prove it for. So if you think about this condition for three point spaces and another fourth point, yeah, you will get very close to what zero is. Are there other questions?
00:29:05.844 - 00:29:09.224, Speaker A: And the follow up question is, should it be closed?
00:29:10.884 - 00:29:17.984, Speaker B: No. So if you have defined on some a, then you can extend it to the closure.
00:29:18.334 - 00:29:19.414, Speaker C: So this is true.
00:29:19.494 - 00:29:26.114, Speaker B: So the extension from a to the closure of a, it works for any, for any complete target.
00:29:35.054 - 00:29:37.674, Speaker C: Other questions?
00:29:42.774 - 00:30:01.198, Speaker B: It does not seem be the case. Okay, so now I want to say a word about. Yeah. Several words about localization. So actually about globalization. But I start with localization. So we have defined a global notion.
00:30:01.198 - 00:30:37.208, Speaker B: So what is. So kad? Kappa means globally curvature. So now we say that the space, or this is definition. Definition, a space x has curvatured most kappa if it is locally cut kappa. So meaning every point has a neighborhood which is cut kappa. So for this definition, this recovers the riemannian notion of curvature bounds. So riemannian manifold has curvature at most kappa if and on in this sense.
00:30:37.356 - 00:30:38.044, Speaker C: So.
00:30:40.624 - 00:31:34.256, Speaker B: When also say CBa, so curvature bounded above by kappa, so curvature bound about by kappa if and only if all section curvatures are at most kappa. So this is a version of Raoul's comparison theory. So, and there is a statement about, um, spaces of curvature at most kappa. This is, yeah. Also this, this is a metric version of, uh, comparison theorem for Jacobi fields. So, and it tells us that if we have a space, a geodesic space of curvature at most kappa, then there are no conjugate points along local geodesics of length at most, say, PI, if kappa is equal to one, or along any geodesics. So what does this mean?
00:31:34.320 - 00:31:44.096, Speaker C: It means that if we have any geodesic, any local geodesic, then for a.
00:31:44.120 - 00:31:49.404, Speaker B: Pair of points sufficiently close to the endpoints, there is a unique.
00:31:51.544 - 00:31:52.632, Speaker C: There is a unique.
00:31:52.688 - 00:32:07.214, Speaker B: So this is xy, here's gamma, here's x, twiddle y. Twiddle close to x and y. And then we find a unique. So there exists a unique gamma twiddle.
00:32:07.634 - 00:32:12.214, Speaker C: Local geodesic close to gamma.
00:32:14.874 - 00:32:31.384, Speaker B: So what can happen? And what happens on the say, on this circle or maybe I will draw. Yeah, see, I will draw maybe a better picture. So say a typical picture. Is the fold required?
00:32:36.524 - 00:32:37.264, Speaker C: No.
00:32:59.144 - 00:33:33.604, Speaker B: So a kind of. Yeah, so something of this shape. It has curvature at most one, but it is not cut one. Why it is not cut one? Yeah, because you find a clue. So because the injectivity radius is too small. If you sit here, then you have two shoulder Giudesi going to the other side of your short handle. However, if you go.
00:33:33.604 - 00:34:42.912, Speaker B: Yeah, so if you just go on one side, then for any point here, there, there is a unique geodesic close to the first one nearby. So I don't think I have explained it in a very good way. But is it more or less clear what this, what the statement means? That there are no, there are no contradict points? I have not proved it. So the proof is not, if not, is it technical? But is the statement clear? So the statement is this time more important than the proof? So the statement adjusted to any local geodesic. If Kappa is positive and it shouldn't be long enough, you have. So this geodesic is uniquely determined by its endpoints. If you are not allowed to go too far from your geodesic.
00:34:42.912 - 00:35:23.978, Speaker B: So if you stay in a neighborhood of your geodesic. Okay, so other questions doesn't seem to be the case. So now we go from localization to globalization. So yeah, very typical statement. So you have some local assumptions and you want have some global conclusions. So if you have this for your theory, then your theory is. Yeah, should have.
00:35:23.978 - 00:35:41.734, Speaker B: Yeah, it should be very good. It should have good applications. So in here you have it. So here there's a version of localization of this globalization, valid for all Kappa.
00:35:41.814 - 00:35:44.462, Speaker C: But it's rather weak.
00:35:44.638 - 00:36:00.094, Speaker B: It is the following one. So a complete geodesic space. So these are some minimal global assumptions. We assume that it has curvature at most Kappa. So this is local condition. So in the riemannian setting it means.
00:36:00.134 - 00:36:03.998, Speaker C: That the whole section curvature sidemost kappa.
00:36:04.086 - 00:36:08.274, Speaker B: And now the statement is that this space is cut kappa if and only if.
00:36:08.694 - 00:36:13.710, Speaker C: Geodesics of length less than PI for.
00:36:13.742 - 00:36:47.254, Speaker B: Kappa equal to one and of all lenses for non positive kappa are unique, so uniquely determined by the endpoints. And for I continuously with the endpoints. Is the statement clear? So essentially, if you are on a locally compact space, then you can forget about the second part. And then the just statement would be that the geodesics depend uniquely on that part. Then the continuity follows it.
00:36:48.114 - 00:36:48.426, Speaker C: So.
00:36:48.450 - 00:37:18.824, Speaker B: And here's the proof. So the proof of this statement is rather simple. So we need to prove that any triangle is thin. What we do, we go on this third side, so we say on the side yz and subdivide it by small.
00:37:19.244 - 00:37:24.820, Speaker C: Intervals and connect the points of the.
00:37:24.852 - 00:38:06.852, Speaker B: Subdivision to the point x. Now the statement that the geodesics are unique and vary continuously. So it implies that by doing so, we subdivide the large triangle into triangles which are very thin. And by thin we means that the geodesics, the two sides, two long sides that go very close to each other for the whole length. So now we apply this statement about thin triangles. So if you know that about this gluing of triangles. So if you know that any of these thin triangles is cut kappa, then the whole triangle is cut kappa.
00:38:06.852 - 00:38:39.364, Speaker B: And to prove that such a thin triangle is Kadkata, we subdivide it like this. And the assumption that the space is locally cut kappa. So it means that any of these small triangles is cut kappa. And again, we use this lemma I mentioned last time. So, before proving the Lyschegna gluing theorem, and it will tell us that this long contained triangle is, can't come up.
00:38:40.864 - 00:38:45.724, Speaker C: So it's thin, is it?
00:38:48.624 - 00:38:57.924, Speaker B: Do we have questions on this? So this is, again, so this is valid for all kappa.
00:39:01.144 - 00:39:02.364, Speaker C: No questions.
00:39:02.864 - 00:39:36.678, Speaker B: So there is a finite application so, which I will not discuss in detail. So for a finite Euclidean simplicial complex. So we have seen Richard Nag's gluing theorem. So it allows you to glue to start with euclidean simplices and glue out of new cut zero spaces. However, if you take arbitrarily simplicial complexes, then you often need to glue not. Yeah, then some gluings happen. Not along convex subsets.
00:39:36.678 - 00:40:01.174, Speaker B: So if you just take the pyramid after you have glued two sides, if you glue the third one, then you glue it along two sides. If you glue the third face, and then you glue it along something which is non convex. However, so there is a very simple criterion. So if you take.
00:40:03.634 - 00:40:09.106, Speaker A: Can you draw a picture that wasn't really okay for the pyramid?
00:40:09.250 - 00:40:10.854, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:12.234 - 00:40:37.886, Speaker B: So yeah, the statement is the following. So if you, so when you, so if you have seen the theorem of a schutnach for the first time, then you might think that any simplicial complex is cut zero, just because you take euclidean simplices and glue them together along convex subsets. However, that's not the case. So if you take the boundary of.
00:40:37.910 - 00:40:41.110, Speaker C: A pyramid, which I have drawn here.
00:40:41.142 - 00:41:26.926, Speaker B: So then you start with the first side say the one which is the one you see. Then you glue to it the second side, which is on the, on the right. You glue it along an edge, which is a convex substance of the first one. And after the gluing, you obtain a cut zero space. However, if you glue the third side to it, then the gluing happens along two edges glue at the same time. You glue the third side along this.
00:41:26.990 - 00:41:30.478, Speaker C: Edge to the first side, and along.
00:41:30.606 - 00:41:51.454, Speaker B: That edge to the second side. And together these two edges. This is not a convex subset. And so after the gluing, what you get is not zero. Is it better now? Is it better understandable?
00:41:52.074 - 00:41:58.094, Speaker A: Yes, yes. And so just to be clear, you're talking here about the surface of the pyramid.
00:41:58.434 - 00:41:59.202, Speaker B: I'm talking about.
00:41:59.258 - 00:42:03.882, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm talking about the boundary, two dimensional thing, right?
00:42:04.018 - 00:42:05.322, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:05.378 - 00:42:05.922, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:42:06.018 - 00:42:18.554, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So actually, yeah, one could do the same for the triangle, but. But then it's. Yeah, yeah. Confusing because. Yeah, there are two points along them. I'm still confused.
00:42:18.554 - 00:42:32.874, Speaker B: Yeah. So here, what are your two sets that you glue? So I have. So my pyramid. So the boundary of my pyramid consists of four triangles.
00:42:35.014 - 00:42:35.822, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:35.998 - 00:42:51.366, Speaker B: These are the triangles called one. So the first one is the one. We see the first face. The second face is on the right, the third on the left, and the fourth on the bottom. So your sets are triangles?
00:42:51.550 - 00:42:52.314, Speaker C: Yes.
00:42:52.614 - 00:43:05.126, Speaker B: My sets are euclidean triangles, okay? And now my surface consists of four triangles. Now I claim that, first of all, it is not. Okay? So I'm not proving it is not cut zero.
00:43:05.190 - 00:43:05.490, Speaker C: It's.
00:43:05.542 - 00:43:29.226, Speaker B: Yeah. It's not considered because it's not contractible. So. But why does. But I explain why it does not contradict Reczznak's theorem. It is the case because we not always glue along convex sets. So the first gluing of the first cycle of the second happens along one edge.
00:43:29.226 - 00:43:35.122, Speaker B: And this is a convex set. 1st, 2nd, you're getting the sphere.
00:43:35.258 - 00:43:36.458, Speaker C: That's the point.
00:43:36.586 - 00:43:37.402, Speaker B: Okay, I got it.
00:43:37.418 - 00:43:38.138, Speaker C: Okay, good. Sir.
00:43:38.186 - 00:43:38.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:39.394 - 00:43:41.574, Speaker C: Okay, good.
00:43:43.954 - 00:43:47.334, Speaker B: Okay, so now.
00:43:51.514 - 00:43:52.570, Speaker C: Globalization.
00:43:52.762 - 00:44:16.724, Speaker B: So then, yeah, the main part of the globalization. So we assume now that kappa is at most zero. So the cup is non positive. Then the statement is that there is a curve shortening process. Process, which. So you start with the curve and you can attach to this curve a local geodesic with the same endpoints. And this process is continuous.
00:44:16.724 - 00:44:35.862, Speaker B: So if your curve is moved only a little bit, then. So if gamma zero is close to. Yeah, so if you move your curve slightly, then the end of the process also has changed only slightly sorry, the.
00:44:35.878 - 00:44:39.646, Speaker A: Assumptions here is CBB Kappa space, right?
00:44:39.710 - 00:44:52.394, Speaker B: Yes. So, yeah, CBA. Yes, yes, yes. So X is a geodesic space of curvature at most couple.
00:44:54.494 - 00:44:57.870, Speaker C: So. And here is the proof.
00:44:57.942 - 00:45:39.524, Speaker B: So the proof is a very simple picture. So if this is our curve gamma, then what we do is the following. So we start at the beginning and we, so we let the end part of the curve fixed and the beginning part we make straight. And now we use that there are no conjugate points. So if we have come to some point, then near this point, there is for any point close to the end point of this segment, there is a unique local geodesic connecting my starting point with that one. And so we can continue in this.
00:45:39.564 - 00:45:43.084, Speaker C: Way and come to the end.
00:45:43.244 - 00:46:31.588, Speaker B: And this final local geodesic. So this is the, the straightening. So this is gamma zero and this is gamma one. And again, so this statement about no conjugate point, it applies more or less immediately that this process is well defined and continuous. And what does it give us? It gives us the following, give us that following version of the theorem of Catalan Leman, that if X is complete geodesic and has curvature at most kappa, so it's CBA kappa, then X is cut Kappa if and only if it's simply connected. Otherwise, if you have a non simply connect one, you take a universal covering and this is cut Kappa. And this is only true for non positive coup.
00:46:31.588 - 00:46:46.764, Speaker B: So this is a globalization theorem. So you know about your space, something only locally, and you have a global conclusion. Okay, why this? So assume your space is not.
00:46:48.464 - 00:46:48.992, Speaker C: Cut.
00:46:49.088 - 00:47:03.608, Speaker B: Say kappa is equal to zero. So assume your space is not cut zero. Then we find, say, two geodesics between two endpoints. Here's x, here's y. And now, because your space is simply.
00:47:03.656 - 00:47:08.894, Speaker C: Connected, we can connect these two curves.
00:47:11.154 - 00:47:15.530, Speaker B: Through a family of curves. And now we can straighten all of.
00:47:15.562 - 00:47:19.418, Speaker C: These curves by this process.
00:47:19.586 - 00:47:34.974, Speaker B: And then what we get is we start so that we have two geodesics, gamma zero, gamma one. And here in between we find some local geodes, some family of local geodesics.
00:47:36.274 - 00:47:39.254, Speaker C: Connecting x and y.
00:47:40.114 - 00:48:01.164, Speaker B: But now we again use that there are no conjugate points, and so all the geodesics must coincide. So gamma zero must be equal to gamma one. So it's, yeah, it's very tautological. So it does seem. So the whole thing seems trivial now, but so it's really a kind of fundamental result in the theory.
00:48:06.344 - 00:48:08.496, Speaker C: In there.
00:48:08.520 - 00:49:09.352, Speaker B: Is a version of this last statement for kappa equal to one, but it is less useful. So it treats in the following way. So a jurassic compact locally cut one space is cut one if and only if there are no isometrically embedded circles which have lengths less than two PI. Are there questions about this? Does not seem to be the case. Then I will say really only two words about cut zero in groups. So there's a whole and very flourishing theory, the geometric group theory and theory of cut zero groups. And the origin is the following.
00:49:09.352 - 00:49:44.804, Speaker B: So if you have a local space, then it's universal covering is contractible. So it tells you that all topology of the space is. So the only topological invariants are within your fundamental group. So X is a so called kp one space. And the topology of x is encoded. And also the coarse topology of the universal covering is encoded in the fundamental group. And this is the.
00:49:44.804 - 00:49:52.880, Speaker B: So you can, you can study the group, fundamental group and you can study the global properties of your space. But I don't want to go into it.
00:49:52.952 - 00:49:58.484, Speaker C: So I skip everything that you see on this page.
00:49:59.944 - 00:50:35.604, Speaker B: Okay, so now I have a little bit less than ten minutes. I want to say something about several tools very useful in the theory of cut, this particular cut zero spaces. So the first one is convexity. So I have already mentioned. So that cut zero spaces are as convex as euclidean spaces. And so one can use convex functions, convex sets, in order to study them. So they are.
00:50:35.604 - 00:51:12.904, Speaker B: And so we have very controlled properties, convexity properties of distance functions. And there are lots of convex subsets. So balls are convex and there are horror balls and much more. And there is another very important property. So semicondc functions, a particular concave functions, they have well defined gradients, and they are gradient flows, which are as contracting as in the. In the Hilbert or Euclidean. Okay, so if you.
00:51:12.904 - 00:51:45.484, Speaker B: Yeah, so, but I don't want, I don't want to go into it. I think for people who have seen it, they know it and others will be too short. So I want to say a little bit more about center of mass construction. So I think. Yeah, again, I'm not sure if. Yeah, this would be correct. So I would again say, I would mention here, but maybe it has been known before.
00:51:45.484 - 00:51:52.364, Speaker B: So at least in paths, definitely. So it has indefinitely also looks like climbing.
00:51:53.224 - 00:51:55.256, Speaker C: So what is it about?
00:51:55.360 - 00:52:10.658, Speaker B: So there is a center of mass map which assigns to a probability measure which has. So if X is. Yeah. It should have sufficiently small support. So if X is cut one, then the support should be not.
00:52:10.746 - 00:52:11.082, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:11.138 - 00:53:08.818, Speaker B: Say small diameter. If it's cut zero, it suffices that it is a compact support. Yeah. And it should be a safe probability measure. And so it assigns to a measure a point the center of mass of this measure. So, and if kappa is not positive, and this map is contracting from, if you equip the space of measures with natural distance function, and this map is defined just in the following way. So you pick the point in your space for this integral, for which this integral is minimal.
00:53:08.818 - 00:53:12.898, Speaker B: The point is so that the distance functions, they are.
00:53:13.066 - 00:53:18.764, Speaker A: Sorry, question, what metric have you taken here on the set of probability measures?
00:53:19.504 - 00:53:25.376, Speaker B: You take the, yeah, the atom metric.
00:53:25.560 - 00:53:31.792, Speaker A: So the wassermetic, sorry, sorry, you take some Wasserstein metric.
00:53:31.888 - 00:53:33.296, Speaker B: The Wasserstein metric. Yeah.
00:53:33.440 - 00:53:34.964, Speaker A: Which one? W two.
00:53:35.864 - 00:53:36.856, Speaker C: W one.
00:53:37.000 - 00:54:13.882, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's, yeah, yeah, I think it's for both of them, it's contracting. But I, yeah, I would be, aha. Okay, so for w two, I think, yeah, so, sorry, I'm, yeah, okay. I'm not sure now for w two. So I'm pretty sure, but yeah. Okay. So the point is so that the distance function contracting in w one and in w two.
00:54:13.882 - 00:54:15.346, Speaker B: W one and in w two.
00:54:15.370 - 00:54:17.054, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you.
00:54:19.754 - 00:55:01.274, Speaker B: So again, so the point is that this function, so that the distance function squared. So they are strongly, they are strongly convex. So also the integral of this function is also strongly convex. So there is a unique, so there is a unique minimum of this function, and this is the center of mass of this measure. And so in the very important example, so if you take, so if you take linear combination of Dirac measures, then this map just assigns the so, so c of mu is.
00:55:03.174 - 00:55:06.754, Speaker C: The point x.
00:55:07.174 - 00:55:36.404, Speaker B: In your space such that the sum of these distances AI is minimal. So and this, so if you let AI run from zero. So if you go over all AI's such that the AI's are non negative and the sum is one. So then you see.
00:55:38.784 - 00:55:39.888, Speaker C: A simplex in.
00:55:39.896 - 00:55:41.184, Speaker B: The space of measures.
00:55:41.344 - 00:55:45.928, Speaker C: And this map if you, then for.
00:55:45.976 - 00:56:14.654, Speaker B: Any AI, you get a point in your space. And this is the so called barycentric simplex in your cut zero or cut kappa space. Now, is it, is it clear what, what it means? So, so here the .001,010 and so on, 10 zero.
00:56:16.134 - 00:56:17.078, Speaker C: This goes.
00:56:17.206 - 00:56:43.234, Speaker B: So for any point on the simplex of different AI's, you get different points. And this defines. So this map is one. So you get a lot of singular simplices in your space. And the simplest is that they play an important role in cut spaces. So since it can be used to establish.
00:56:47.324 - 00:56:48.420, Speaker C: A dimension theory.
00:56:48.492 - 00:57:32.480, Speaker B: So this is due to Klein. So for any, so for any point in your space, you have the space of direction. The space of direction is cut one. The corner of the space of directions is tangent cone, it is cut zero. It is not, it is smaller than any blow up at the space x. So if you rescale the space and go to, yeah, and go to the limit, then it, then the limit must, can be much larger. But this tangent cone, so this, yeah, it sits in all the space and this itself called zero.
00:57:32.592 - 00:57:36.354, Speaker C: So, and now there is a, there.
00:57:36.394 - 00:58:55.554, Speaker B: Is the following theorem. So for zero, for cut kappa space, the following numbers are equal. So the topological dimension of the space, the homological dimension, then the maximum dimension of the space of directions, so, plus one. So this allows you some inductional approach the spaces, so you can try to understand them by first understanding the spaces or directions, and then understand space of directional direction, so you can decrease their dimensions step by step. And so the most interesting one, so it's maximum dimension of non degenerate baryocentric simplex, or baryocentric simplex is what I have defined on the previous page by using, yeah, center of masses and degeneracy means that it is degenerated like this, that it is contained in the image of its faces. And this is essentially all one can say about topology on general cut spaces. Okay, so my time is over.
00:58:55.554 - 00:58:59.554, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you very much for your attention.
00:59:00.814 - 00:59:05.774, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Ah.
