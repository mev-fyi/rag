00:00:24.880 - 00:01:35.718, Speaker A: Still, after two years, I'm not familiar with. I mean, this is stuff I prefer the board chalk. Hopefully we go back to normal soon. Okay, let's go back to rkhs. Different methods that we can produce k positive and k positive gives us a space h of k. Here we want to consider kernels arising from polynomial or a power series. So we start with polynomial, for which there is no convergence problem.
00:01:35.718 - 00:03:00.858, Speaker A: But then with a little bit of work, we can go to power series. So p of x equal to the sum in from zero up to fix nanxn. And the main assumption is that an is bigger than or equal to zero for all. Nice. That's the main assumption. Then we consider k index p from, not from c, from c two to c. By this formula, kp of z and w is defined by sum an z w bar, the combination that we had before exponent.
00:03:00.858 - 00:03:43.054, Speaker A: Nice. In other words, it's p evaluated at point zw. That is why we call it kp. So it's p evaluated at z w bar. And the claim is that kp is positive, even though it's trivial for us now. But kp bigger than or equal to zero. It means as a kernel.
00:03:43.054 - 00:05:08.494, Speaker A: And this is equivalent. So this is equivalent to say that for any z one z two z n in c, if you consider the n by n matrix kp z I and z j I j from one up to n, it could. It's not the same n as above. Well, it's better not to mix this nvid with the other ones. For any m, this is bigger than or equal to zero. And why is this the case? First of all, we have seen this before. At least when p is a polynomial of degree one, then just p is p of z is equal to z w.
00:05:08.494 - 00:06:39.554, Speaker A: We have seen this before. But in the general setting, what do we obtain if we do the calculation? I mean, replace kp by this formula, you see immediately that this matrix is equal to a zero. A matrix gm plus a one, q plus a two, q on q, the short product of q with itself. And finally, an q on q on q n times, where q is simply the matrix zizj bar. This is the special case that we have seen before, and corresponds to a special case, p of z equal to z. We know that this is, this is positive. I mean, q is.
00:06:39.554 - 00:07:34.674, Speaker A: We know q is bigger than or equal to zero. And jm is a matrix. All of its elements are equal to one. And also this is positive. And why? Now there is a place you see why we assume that the coefficients are also positive. We use short theorem. Sure theorem tells us that if q is positive, then q sure product of q doesn't matter how many times k times is also positive.
00:07:34.674 - 00:08:55.694, Speaker A: So every matrix here is positive. The coefficients are also positive. And therefore, since aj are also positive, we conclude that kp z I z j is positive and therefore kp is a kernel function. And again, by Mohr theorem, which we discuss in detail, we have the function space which we call it hkp. And there is a way to find some of its elements. The way is hidden in this observation. Kp of z and w is the sum n from zero up to nanzw bar to the power n.
00:08:55.694 - 00:10:20.834, Speaker A: And since a n is positive, I can write a n equal to root a n squared and consider root a n with z and with w. So I define f to be root of an zn and kp z w becomes sum from zero up to nfzfn of w bar. That's a very precious representation. The reason is that in the book there is an exercise which I believe it should be a theorem. It's an improvement of a theorem which we proved earlier. We proved that if Fn is a parcel frame, then we have this identity. So the theorem we had.
00:10:20.834 - 00:11:40.594, Speaker A: So recall if n is a personal identity, then k or kp, in any case, z and w has this representation. However, when we say is a partial identity, it is hidden in the, in the assumption that Fn is an element of the space h. It's already there. And then we have this identity. What is in the exercise, which is way more important, is that we do not make this assumption. We just say that fn are functions on this base x. So we do not assume that we, it's part of conclusion.
00:11:40.594 - 00:12:41.874, Speaker A: This is, that's the important part of the that exercise. So we have some function. Our assumption is what we have here in the, in the red box. The assumption is that for each z and w, kp of z and w is this series of complex number. Here is the finite case, but it can be infinite too. F n of z f n of w r. And the conclusion is that that's the important part of the conclusion.
00:12:41.874 - 00:14:02.498, Speaker A: It's in this space and even we can say something about its norm. And fn is a percival frame in the finite dimensional case, which is, I mean, let me write it in the more general setting. Why just why just finite? Let's put it here. Infinite, even in the infinite, it's a. This is true in, if we are in the finite dimensional case, in, we can say, a little bit more, more than a small frame, is an orthonormal basis. The only thing we need to assume here, which causes, I mean, a little problem, is that probably some of these fns are identically zero. But I mean, this is something trivial that we can remove.
00:14:02.498 - 00:14:50.682, Speaker A: I mean, we can, we can assume that fn not equal to zero. Otherwise, if, even if fn is zero, still, this is true in frames we can have. I mean, eleven can be dependent, so being zero is acceptable here. But if we want to end up with a possible, with a, with an orthonormal basis, we need to assume that they are not zero. So it's not something, a big assumption. This is needed here in the box formula, we have k of p is equal to this. We do not know if fnr in this space.
00:14:50.682 - 00:16:24.892, Speaker A: But this observation, which I invite you to prove, and the proof I give a hint, is based on the theorem which I called it finite controlled interpolation. Part three of that theorem helps us based on finite controlled interpolation, it's very easy indeed to see that fn are in h and they form on orthonormal basis. And here we have, we have kp, z. And w is equal to some j n from one up to nfnw bar f n of z is root of o zn. And here this assumption comes into picture. This one, if an is equal to zero, well then fn equal to zero. And it's trivially, fn is in this space.
00:16:24.892 - 00:17:49.644, Speaker A: Nothing important here. But if we consider the set of fn such that an not equal to zero, which is the same as the set of Zn, such that a n not equal to zero, this is a set. This one better not to, because I want to have something normalized. I write it this way. This set is an orthonormal basis for h of kp, based on the above theorem. And also we can say that zn is in k h of kp if an is not equal to zero. So that's the way we can create a function space.
00:17:49.644 - 00:18:25.054, Speaker A: It's not trivial. It needs a little bit of work here to replace this if by if and only if. In other words, it's bi directional. It's a bit of work. It's not trivial, but I don't need it here. A bit of generalization of the previous idea. It's power series instead of polynomial.
00:18:25.054 - 00:19:11.354, Speaker A: So we can see that p of x or p of z equal to sum n from zero. And now up to infinity a n z, and as before a n bigger than or equal to zero, there is a problem of convergence. And now to deal with that, I assume that this series is convergent on a disk of radius two reals. You may say that, why not at this radius r? It's okay. If you want to go with r, go ahead. But later on you will have root square of r somewhere. Because in future I want to have r.
00:19:11.354 - 00:20:20.874, Speaker A: I replace the r here by r two, and that root square of r two becomes r. So it's just a matter of notation to be more convenient in future. So I have a power series which is convergent on a discovery radius two reals. And then I define kp of z w by n from zero to infinity anzw bar n. And be careful here, not for all z and w is in a disk of radius r. That's why I put r two over there. And now what can we say about, I mean, the claim is that kp is a kernel function is bigger than or equal to zero.
00:20:20.874 - 00:22:06.212, Speaker A: So this is the same thing as if you consider kp z I and z j I and j from one up to m. For any m that's a positive matrix. This is immediate, based on the preceding example, because we can consider pn to be this, the same sum, but n from zero up to nanzn. And we know that kpn is positive, which is equivalent to the fact that kpn, zizji and j from one up to m is a positive matrix. It's a matrix with m two elements. And now what happens if n goes to infinity? If n goes to infinity for each I and for each j, in this between one and mkpnzi and z j converges to kp z I and z j. And if you write the definition of this, the definition is a sum being bigger than or equal to zero, a finite sum.
00:22:06.212 - 00:23:34.484, Speaker A: In a finite sum, you can change the order of limit and sum. And when you change the order of limit and sum, you immediately see that this one is also positive. So immediately implies that kp of z I and z jack is also positive. So we have a positive kernel, we apply more, and as before, we have h of kp. Previous result. If I write kp of zw as sum n from zero to infinity fnz f n w bar, when fn of z is root zn. The previous observation says that if an is not equal to zero, this implies that, uh, well, yeah, this input all the time for any n, for any n.
00:23:34.484 - 00:25:05.704, Speaker A: The previous observation says that fn is in h of kp but it is important when n is an is not equal to zero. So for any n such that a n not equal to zero, we conclude that zn is in h of kp not for the other values, and also, and also the set of fn such that a n is not equal to zero. This set is a personal frame. If, if I remove this and write n bigger than or equal to zero, still it is true. But it is not that useful because you can put the elements which are zero if a. And there is one little problem which is the difference between the finite case and infinite dimensional case. If we have a parcel frame, and even here we remove the zeros, we just consider those which are not zero.
00:25:05.704 - 00:27:20.894, Speaker A: Can we conclude that we have an orthonormal basis? Not really. We need another notation which doesn't appear in linear algebra, but it is more for operator theory. Here is the definition. So h is a Hilbert space and fs with some size in set of element. In h, we say that this set is l two independent, l two independent. If whenever sum s in s a s, f s is equal to zero, and this is in l two, l two of s, then we conclude that as is identically zero. In other words, for n is equal to zero.
00:27:20.894 - 00:28:28.184, Speaker A: The only way that this can be zero is that the coefficient is zero. This is not the same thing as independent that we have seen before. Let me give an example to distinguish things. Of course, l two independent implies independent, but not vice versa. Example, consider the ordinary l two, the little l two that we have as our first Hilbert space with en n bigger than or equal to one, the canonical basis. And then consider this element x sum n from one up to n one over n en. This is well defined because one over n is in l two.
00:28:28.184 - 00:28:58.044, Speaker A: So x is what happened. So x is also in l two. I think you want the upper limit of the sum to be infinity rather than n. Yes, yes, thank you. Yes indeed. And I really need that infinity. We'll see momentarily.
00:28:58.044 - 00:30:14.694, Speaker A: Now, first claim the set x e one, e two, e three, and so on is independent. And the second claim is that the same thing is not l two independence. Well, proof not that difficult. Assume that a finite linear combination of these elements are zero. Without loss of generality, we can say that lambda times x plus lambda one x e one up to lambda m em equal to zero. Because if, even if some elements are not there, we can consider the corresponding lambda to be zero, lambda k to be zero. So this can be a general linear combination here.
00:30:14.694 - 00:31:22.324, Speaker A: And now look at the component m plus one. This is a vector. This is a vector. It has first component, second component, and comes up to component m plus one equal to zero. What is this component? Do you agree with that? Because for e one up to em, I mean, this is the first component equal to one, the rest zero, and the same for e two up to em. So all the components here from m plus one up to infinity, for all of these are equal to zero. So the only thing which remains is lambda times x, which gives us lambda times m plus one, lambda over one, m plus lambda over n plus one for this position.
00:31:22.324 - 00:32:34.378, Speaker A: And being equal to zero implies that lambda equal to zero. And then we come back to lambda one, e one plus lambda m, e m equal to zero. They are independent, implies that lambda one equal to lambda two equal to lambda m equal to. So they are independent. But why are they are not l two independent? Because simply consider one minus one times x plus one times e one, one over two times e two, and so on. The sequence we have here is the sequence minus 11213 and so on, which is in l two, and the combination is equal to zero. So it's a non trivial combination combination which gives you.
00:32:34.378 - 00:33:20.084, Speaker A: So therefore they are not l two independent. I mean, you can imagine something naive, but you can imagine like this, this is independent. I mean, the set of all independent vectors, l two independent, is smaller, is like this. There is another notion which is used in some books. For example, in books in wavelet theory, omega independent and in omega independent, they even do not assume that the coefficients are in l two. So it's something even smaller. Omega independent.
00:33:20.084 - 00:35:08.652, Speaker A: I don't use this, I just use the l two independent. And to finish today, the reason I need this notion is this proposition which says that let fs s is in s be a personal frame for h. For the Hilbert space h then is an orthal roman basis, is an orthonormal basis for h, if and only if is l two independent. This is a property between, I mean, in operative theory, which is hidden in these words. When you look at the proof, you will see immediately what's going on. Proof I have. Yeah, I have a few minutes.
00:35:08.652 - 00:35:50.514, Speaker A: I can finish the proof. This part trivial. And now we work for the other parts. Consider the vector v that we had before. From l two. No, v was the other way around. V was from h to l two, l two of s.
00:35:50.514 - 00:36:44.472, Speaker A: By this definition, v of an element h was defined to be this vector h inner product with e s. S is in s. That's, that's the way we defined v. We saw this before and this is an isometry. Isometry is the same thing as parcel of frame. I mean, that's why I said facts from operator theory are hidden here. Behind the words.
00:36:44.472 - 00:38:14.816, Speaker A: Parcel frame is the same thing as this mapping is an isometry. That's the first thing we saw also, or it's very easy to compute. The v is from l two vest to h two and it maps es to fs. That's, I mean, very easy to see indeed. I already did it. And again, another thing which is hidden behind the words, if you look carefully, l two independent is precisely the same thing as v. Star is injective because when you look at the star of the sum over s a s e s, it's the sum asfs and l two.
00:38:14.816 - 00:39:03.094, Speaker A: Independence says that when this is equal to zero, all the coefficients are zero. Therefore this element is equal to zero. In other words, the only element which is mapped to zero is zero. So it's injective. And this argument is, or this explanation is reversible. So when you look carefully, that's another fact which is hidden fact from operator theory which is hidden behind the words l two independent is the same as the injectivity of versus last fact n. The null space of v is equal to the range of v perp.
00:39:03.094 - 00:40:16.244, Speaker A: And what do we want to prove? We want to prove that l two independent implies orthonormal basis. So l two independent implies that v star is injective, which is the same thing as null space of p star is equal to just zero. And this implies that range of v per is equal to zero. And remember, it's a frame parcel frame. The range is closed, so the range of phi is equal to h. And indeed, I mean, if you want, you can also go backward, but I need just this direction. The range of v is equal to h.
00:40:16.244 - 00:40:56.164, Speaker A: Range of v is equal to h. So what do we have here? V from h into l. So resume. Or, I mean, of what we have up to now, we have v from l to s to h. We know that it's on two and we know it's injective and we know it's an isometry. So all of this. Now the only thing was missing was this one.
00:40:56.164 - 00:41:43.064, Speaker A: And so it's a unitary map. And having a unitary map means that it v maps an orthonormal basis into an orthonormal basis. So we are done. Well, I wrote these things about V. Yeah, it's true. It maps. I sorry, this is V star, not v yes, so V is unitary, V star is also unitary.
00:41:43.064 - 00:42:21.074, Speaker A: So versus star maps es to fs. Therefore fs is an orthonormal basis. Let me put it more correctly. What I wrote here was correct. So V is unitary map, and therefore V is also a unitary map. And now I use V star here. End of story.
00:42:21.074 - 00:43:34.618, Speaker A: Now that's why we studied l two independence, and so we could obtain some power series of, I mean, kernels defined by power series. And therefore the theorem that we had before. I mean, this is my last, sorry, bit more than. Let me finish with this. We had kp of z and w sum n from zero to infinity anzw bar to the n, which we can write as before, f n of z f n of w bar. And now we can, based on the above observation, we can say that the set of fn when an is not equal to zero is an orthonormal basis. We already know.
00:43:34.618 - 00:44:39.582, Speaker A: So, fact one, we already know that this is a parcel frame. Even if we remove this, it's already a partial frame. The only thing we need to establish to obtain an orthonormal basis is to show that they are, they are l two independent. But for that, assume, say, lambda n, not to mix with the other one is in l two. And consider the sum of lambda n fn over a n not equal to zero in that h. So the convergence is in h. But we know that convergence in norm implies point wise convergence.
00:44:39.582 - 00:45:18.474, Speaker A: So this implies that the sum over a n not equal to zero lambda n f z equal to zero for any z in doctor. And let's write this usually at the end. Doesn't like what I write. Okay. It's okay. A n not equal to zero lambda. Nice.
00:45:18.474 - 00:46:00.164, Speaker A: A n root of this zn equal to zero for any z in t r. And now we use our knowledge of complex analysis. On a disk we have a series which is identically zero for any z. So this implies that all the coefficients are zero, lambda and root n equal to zero. If instead of a n not equal to zero, I've written n from zero to infinity. From the beginning everything was okay. And here you can still, I can say for all n bigger than or equal to zero.
00:46:00.164 - 00:46:52.260, Speaker A: But I cannot conclude that lambda n's are zero, because probably some of a n are zero. That is why I assume that over all indices such that a n not equal to zero. And I finish with lambda n equal to zero for all of them. So this is l two independence and l two independence by previous theorem means that fn not zero is an orthonormal basis. Finished. You obtain a basis for our space too. Almost at the end of this chapter four.
00:46:52.260 - 00:47:06.484, Speaker A: But, I mean, I will. I will continue next week to. To finish this chapter and go over chapter five. Thank you very much. Hope you liked it.
