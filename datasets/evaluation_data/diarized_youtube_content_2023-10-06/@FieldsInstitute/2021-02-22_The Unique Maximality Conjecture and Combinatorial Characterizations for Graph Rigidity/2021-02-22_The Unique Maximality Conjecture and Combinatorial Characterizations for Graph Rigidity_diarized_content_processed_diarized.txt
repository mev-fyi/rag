00:00:00.520 - 00:01:02.854, Speaker A: Thanks for the organizer for this great opportunity. So, the topic of my talk is about combinatorial characterization for graph rigidity, which is a well known problem in the rigidity theory. And in that context there is a also famous long standing conjecture due to Jack Grabber concerning the uniqueness of the unique maximality of materials. And the goal of this talk is to explain how this unique maximality conjecture is important in the to attack the combinatorial characterization problem. So the top. So this is, should the slide be changed? No, not yet. So this is joint work with Katie Clinch and Bill Jackson.
00:01:02.854 - 00:01:36.904, Speaker A: So let me start. Okay, so because I'm fast speaker. So maybe I should collect the basic terminology from the graph rigidity. So I, so I will, I will try something. I will explain the basic definition slowly. So suppose we are given the graph in d d space, euclidean space. Such a graph is usually called a bound joint framework in this context.
00:01:36.904 - 00:02:30.343, Speaker A: And I will use notation pair of g and p to denote bound joint framework. So here g is a graph underline graph, and p is underline point configuration. And suppose you have a bound joint framework. So this is example of two dimensional framework. And in the DGDT problem, we are asked whether there is a continuous deformation of this bound joint framework. So algebraically this is equivalent to asking whether there is a non trivial solution in the system of quadratic equations that describes h length constraints. So here the p is fixed and x is a variable.
00:02:30.343 - 00:03:23.542, Speaker A: And we are interested if there is some non trivial solution in the neighbor of p. But this is a quadratic system. So usually it is difficult to understand space or solutions. So general approach is to look at the fast order approximation of this quadratic system. And then we get this system, which is linear in x dot. So here the p is fixed and x dot is a variable, and this system gives concept of infinitesimal visility. So in the infinitesimal rigidity, we are asked whether there is a non trivial solution in this linear system because this is linear.
00:03:23.542 - 00:04:07.800, Speaker A: So we can compute solution space. So that's good. But because infinitesimal rigidity is a fast forward approximation of concept of rigidity. So in general, infinitesimal rigidity is not equal to rigidity. But if we assume that p is generic configuration, then it turns out that infinitesimal rigidity is equal to the rigidity. Moreover, if p is generic, then infinitesimal rigidity is completely determined by the underlying graph. So this fact motivates Asimov and Ross to define the concept of the graph rigidity.
00:04:07.800 - 00:05:34.934, Speaker A: So we say that the graph is rigid in RD, if any generic bound joint framework of g is rigid in RD, and because this is a property of graph, so natural question is to give a characterization of rigid graphs in terms of graphs. So this is a combinatorial characterization problem of graph rigidity, okay? And so the most fundamental tool to attack this combinatorial characterization problem is this Max's count condition. This is for the, for any infinitesimal digital framework. So this is a necessary condition for the, for the infinitesimal digitality of any framework. So suppose we have a boundary joint framework, then it is minimally digit. If it is minimally digit in RD, then underline graph must satisfy the following two conditions. The first condition says that the number of edge is equal to d times number of vertex minus d plus one, choose two.
00:05:34.934 - 00:06:29.234, Speaker A: And the second condition says that for any subgraph the number of h must be at most d times number of vertices minus d plus one choose two. So for example, if you look at this two dimensional framework, then you can check that, so number part is six and the number of edges is nine. So we have this condition. But if you look at this subgraph, then this subgraph is too dense to satisfy the second condition. So second condition is actually biodegraded. So you can conclude that this is actually the infinitesimally flexible. And this is an example of the infinitesimal digital framework.
00:06:29.234 - 00:07:31.632, Speaker A: And you can check that indeed these conditions is satisfied. And this condition is nice because this is very, very clear combinatorial, just a deletion between the number of edges and number of vertices. And this condition, this is for any, for any framework. So it, so the condition also stored for the, for the digit, for the dignity of graphs. So you can just say that you can just replace the framework with graph. And you say that you can see that if graph g is minimally digit in RD, then the max count condition must satisfy. And what is interesting is the question.
00:07:31.632 - 00:08:37.804, Speaker A: Interesting question is whether the compass direction of this necessary condition is true or not. And when d is equal to one, you can easily check that actually this condition is just a cycle freeness of the graph from fetch, you can conclude that compass direction is also true. Because graph is rigid in one dimensional space, you can only graph is connected. And the interest cases when d is equal to two. So actually even in the two dimension space, this condition is also sufficient for the minimum rigidity. So this is well known as a Raman cell. But when d is equal to three or more than three, the compound direction is no longer true and characterization problem is still open.
00:08:37.804 - 00:09:46.444, Speaker A: So this is a basic background of the combinatorial characterization problem for digit. And now I hope so far everything is okay. And from now I would like to move to a little bit more detail. So the one of the key tool to analyze this combinatorial character combinatorial combinatorics of digit is a concept of digit matroid. So let me introduce digit metroid. So this is not a complicated thing. So suppose we have the complete graph with n vertices, and let's take a generic point configuration of the vertices of the complete graph, and we consider the digit matrix, which is matrix representing the linear system I just gave you in the definition of the infinitesimal rigidity.
00:09:46.444 - 00:11:02.964, Speaker A: So here is a digital matrix. Maybe you don't have to understand the exact entries of the matrix, but one important thing in this definition is that it has the same combinatorial structure as incidence matrix. So for example in the incidence matrix you have. So let's say this is infringement matrix. Then each row is associated with edge and each column is associated with vertex. And if he links between PI and bj, then you have one and minus one here and remaining entries in this row, zero. In the digit matrix you have the same combinatorial patterns, but the difference is just here, instead of one minus one, you have PI and pj and pj minus p I, which is a direction of the, of the edge in the framework.
00:11:02.964 - 00:12:07.212, Speaker A: And important things in this definition is that each row is associated with an edge. So if you look at a row material in this matrix, then you can get metroid on the edge set of the complete graph. So that's a digit metroid, genetic d dimensional digity. So genic metroid is just a combinatorial structure of the low dependence of the digit matrix. And this means that bases are corresponding to the minimally digital graphs and circuits are minimally dependent graphs. Independence in this matterhoid means stress freeness in terms of the rigidity. Okay.
00:12:07.212 - 00:13:08.664, Speaker A: And advantage of introducing this digital demot abstract concept is that we can compare the combinatorial structure of digitality with existing known discrete structure from the combinatorics. That's the idea of Jacques grammar. So he suggested, he suggested that we might get a better understanding if we study a family of metroids having the representative properties of the digit genetic dimensionality. And motivated by this, he introduced the concept of abstract ddtroid. So here is a definition. So let's look at motoroid on the edge set of the complete graph. Then such a matroid is called abstract DGT matroid.
00:13:08.664 - 00:13:57.624, Speaker A: If it is a kd plus two matroid with rank dn minus d plus one choose two. And what is a kd plus two matroid. So matroid is called kd plus two matroid if every kd plus two is a circuit. So if you consider the digitality. So in one dimensional digitality triangle is minimally dependent graph. Two dimensional case complete graph with four vertices is also the example of minimal dependent graph in three dimensional space. K five is a minimal dependent graph.
00:13:57.624 - 00:15:02.928, Speaker A: So those are well known, maybe the most fundamental dependent graph in digility in d dimensional digitality. So that can be considered as a fundamental. Having the kd plus two as a circuit can be considered as a representative property of the generic digility. And also from the max error conditions, the first condition of the max maxillary count rank of the dimensional digit material is equal to dn minus d plus one choose two. So this is another fundamental property. And we say that materoid is abstract dvd motheroid if it satisfies those two fundamental properties. So I should mention, I should remark that actually this is not equal to the gravas original definition.
00:15:02.928 - 00:15:34.464, Speaker A: This is an equivalent characterization due to the gram. But this formulation will be directly related to our research. I hope definition is clear. And grava conjectures that genetic d dimensional rgd motheroid is an extremely example.
00:15:36.764 - 00:15:37.052, Speaker B: In.
00:15:37.068 - 00:16:10.214, Speaker A: This family of abstract DDG matroid. And in order to explain this conjecture, let me first introduce concept of weak order. So here's the definition. So suppose you have two m one and m two. And suppose they have same ground set. Then we say that m one is at most m two. If any independent set in m one is also independent in m two.
00:16:10.214 - 00:17:25.916, Speaker A: So using this definition, so for any family of metalloids having a common ground set, we can form the poset with respect to this recollection. And let's consider the family of all abstract d ligility materoids on kn grab a conjecture that generic d dimensional digit metroid is a unique maximum unit in this pod set. That's a gravance conjecture. We can formulate a slightly stronger form conjecture which asks whether the genetic d dimensional digital material is a unique maximum kd plus two motorways. So recall that the absolute digit motors is a matrix having two properties. ABCD plus two is a circuit. And also the is dn minus dn minus d plus one.
00:17:25.916 - 00:18:35.800, Speaker A: Choose two. And so this family of kd plus two motheroids is a slightly larger family of mothers. And he proves that when D is at most two conjecture is correct. But it turns out that this conjecture is false. If D is at least four, but still the conjecture is open in three dimensional space. This is a long standing open problem and you will see how this conjecture is important for characterizing the three dimensional digit model and this gudabal's conjecture. This is the conjecture I have shown you in the last page and this conjecture consists of two parts.
00:18:35.800 - 00:21:00.654, Speaker A: So the first part says that there is a unique maximal element in the weak all opposite of all abstract DDT and second part says that this unique maximum element is attained by generic dimensional digital and this first part can be can give you also nice question. So that's. I would like to say we global weak global conjecture so namely the positive of all abstract dimensional d rigidity metroid has a unique maximum element again, a stronger form is that the positive of all kD plus two metroid has unique maximal element and for this weaker form we could prove that conjecture is correct in three dimensional case and if these are at least four, then this conjecture is still open so there is no counterexample for this conjecture. There's a question, why is that stronger form, stronger form over? Yeah, you are right, maybe this is independent. Sorry, yeah, you are correct. Maybe another related conjecture. I should have said this is another related conjecture here.
00:21:00.654 - 00:23:53.874, Speaker A: Thank you. So, yes, may I move to the next page? So let me explain detail about this counterexample for the strong grabbance conjecture due to waterfrontry because it turns out that this metalloid is a key to understand the structure of the. So Walter felt really found a very interesting method from the study on bivariate splines in approximation theory and this method, unfortunately I do not have time to explain this background but the definition of this method is not very difficult if you know about digit matrix. So it is again defined by using a matrix and this matrix is called cofactor matrix and the cofactor matrix is almost same as the digit matrix, so the same combinatorial structure but this time, instead of PJ, we have different entries and this is entries, you don't have to remember those entries, just this has a different entries and important things again is that in this matrix each row is associated with an edge. So you can define by using the raw materoid, you can define the metalloid on the edge set of the complete graph. So this matloid is called S cofactor matloid so s is a parameter like dimension, it's slightly different from D, as you can see, as you see and what is interesting is that the S cofactor matoroid is an abstract s plus one dgdtloid so the disco factor metroid is from the study on sprines. So it's very hard.
00:23:53.874 - 00:25:34.054, Speaker A: It seems that this observation is hard to understand, but this is not super surprising because so if you look at the case when s is equal to one, then 10 spline over plane graph is a piecewise linear function which can be considered as a polyhedral lifting of a plane graph. And by well known Max correspondence, such a lifting has a one to one correspondence with self stress. From this observation, you can see that one cofactor motoroid is two dimensions, is equal to the two dimensional rigidly module. So the question is whether this falls for any s, which means whether there is a non linear barge on the maximum correspondence in the genetic sense. But unfortunately you don't have any such nice relation. So world observes that FEM s is at least three. This cofactor matoroid is strictly larger than the s plus one dimensional digit motoroid.
00:25:34.054 - 00:26:40.344, Speaker A: So in particular, this means that for d at least 4d dimensional rigidity metroid cannot be the unique maximum abstract d plus two rigidity motorola. So this motivates water to give a device to conjecture. So he conjectures that S cofactor material is a unique maximal abstract s plus one digit metroid. And for this metroid, we recently proved that the conjecture is correct when s is equal to two. So that means two cofactor matroid is a unique maximum k five matroid. So here it's a situation. So you have a family of k five motoroids in this mountain, k five motoroids.
00:26:40.344 - 00:27:55.820, Speaker A: The top element is a two cofactor matlon and conjecture. Grabbers conjecture is that three dimensional d in motoroid is also equal to these two cofactor matroid. Unfortunately, our technique cannot be extended to the k six metroid. So we don't know if the cofactor matrix is at the top of the mountain of k six matrix. And more importantly, we could show that, we could show a combinatorial characterization for two cofactor multiplied. So this means that if the gravas conjecture is true from Gravel's conjecture in three dimensional space is true, then our conjecture, our combinatorial characterization gives a combinatorial characterization for the three dimensional rigidity matrix. Okay, so this is a current state.
00:27:55.820 - 00:29:34.870, Speaker A: So let me explain our combinatory archive characterization. So the combinatorial characterization will be described by using the concept of propagating sequence. So let me introduce this. So let's look at a complete graph, and we look at a sequence of edge sets in kn and we say that this sequence is proper if remember, xi is not completely covered by the proceeding edge sets from x one to xi minus one, and we see that this sequence is kt sequence if each member is a copy of kt, which is a complete graph of t vertices. And by using this concept we defined value function for kt, which is a set function defined over the edge set of the complete graph, and for any edge set f, the value of f is defined by this. Yes, this is complicated. So let me, let me explain.
00:29:34.870 - 00:31:09.474, Speaker A: So let's look at any proper kd sequence. Then I will first look at the union of given edge set f and union of all edge set appeared in the sequence and look at the size of this union and we subtract, we subtract k, which is length of this sequence. So here is just one, one simple example. So let's consider the k three sequence and suppose my f is this and let's look at this sequence x one, x two, x three, or copy of copies of k three. Then the union is this and this and this. So the union of all edge sets has size equal to seven and the length of this sequence is minus three. So value for this sequence equal to four, and the value for f is taking is a minimum possible value value overall possible proper kt signals.
00:31:09.474 - 00:31:56.764, Speaker A: So this is a bit complicated. At least this is defined combinatorially and it looks very complicated. But if you try for example k three case, then you will see that the value, this function for k three is just a rank function of the cycle matrix of the complete graph. It's a graphic matrix. A little bit more complicated. Case is when t is equal to case. But you can see that the value function is a non function of the generic two dimensional leading motorized.
00:31:56.764 - 00:33:38.770, Speaker A: And what we have proof is that when t is equal to five value function for k, five is a function of the two cofactor maturity. So this gives a good characterization in sense that the problem of checking the independence independence in the two cofactor motorists is in the intersection of complex class NP and co NP. So this gives a certificate for non digility in the Tuko factor matrix like the Raman cell. But still, we don't have a polynomial time efficient polynomial time algorithm to compute value function. So that's a big open problem. Okay, so this is a first part of my talk. So if there is a question then I'm happy to answer, but okay, no questions.
00:33:38.770 - 00:35:03.334, Speaker A: So maybe let me move to the second part of my talk. So in the last page, sorry Shinichi, there is a question in the chat is the poly time algorithm open even for n equals five? Yes. So that's big open primary. So, so we know that this computation problem is in the intersection of the NP and co NP. So, generally people believe that the problem in this class has admits a polynomial time algorithm, but we don't know how to compute this function. Oh, we have an undermine algorithm because by randomized algorithm, you can check the lank of the dysmotrid. So, polynomial time algorithm for the case when n is equal five or d is equal to five is a very big progress to understand, I think combinatory structure of liquidity.
00:35:08.554 - 00:35:19.894, Speaker C: Wait, before you move on. So, so the certificate of being dependent is just a kt sequence that gives you a value lower than the size of f. Yeah.
00:35:21.154 - 00:35:30.270, Speaker A: You can compute in point run time if you have. Yeah. You can comp. If you have a sequence certificate. Yeah.
00:35:30.462 - 00:35:32.834, Speaker C: So what's the certificate of independence?
00:35:33.854 - 00:35:38.974, Speaker A: It's by Schwartzipirema. So if you have. So.
00:35:39.054 - 00:35:43.806, Speaker C: Oh, okay. Yeah. Gotcha. So you use the algebraic one for the other side.
00:35:43.950 - 00:35:50.114, Speaker A: Yeah. So the giving the combinatorial certificate is interesting, actually.
00:35:50.734 - 00:35:53.114, Speaker C: Okay, that's what I was. Yeah, thanks.
00:36:03.334 - 00:36:33.534, Speaker A: Okay, then let's move to the second part. So. So here the, we look at the case fan. We look at the mattress having the property that every kt is a circuit. But you can look at, instead of KT, you can look at the general graph h. That's a second part of the topic of the second part. So, let me define the concept of the h matroid.
00:36:33.534 - 00:37:29.324, Speaker A: So let script h be a family of graphs. Then we said that the metroid on the edge set of the complete graph is an h matroid. If every member of h is a circuit, and if the script h consists of a single graph, then we just use this h mat notation h matroid. And here's an example. So in case of the k three. So when kh is equal to k three, then cyclometalloid is k three metroid, because any triangle is a circuit in the, in the cyclometroid. But another extremely example is a lung two uniform motoroid.
00:37:29.324 - 00:38:09.152, Speaker A: So in the rank, rank two uniform motoroid. Again, every triangle is a circuit. So this is also the case in material. And another simple example is when h is equal to p four, which is a path of length three, then for example, length two uniform matrix is an example of p for matoroid. Oh, maybe, maybe wrong. Maybe to correct. Sorry.
00:38:09.152 - 00:38:51.740, Speaker A: Yeah, correct. So every. If you look at the pass of length three, then this is a circuit. And here is a question. So for a given n and script h, find that the positive of h materials have the unique maximum element. So, this interesting question was posed by Salam and Vince. And if you try, for example, some simple case, when for example, the h is equal to k three, you can.
00:38:51.740 - 00:39:53.354, Speaker A: So you can see that cyclomataloid is a unique maximum case with metaloid. And in the case of p four materoids, actually this rank two uniform atroid is unique maximally p four metaloid. And for those simple special case, you might guess that this posit of h metaboid always has a unique maximum element. But it turns out that this is not true. In general, this is not the case. So the gula pup observes that when h is equal to c phi, there are two distinct maximal c phi modules. So we need to, we want to understand what's the difference between.
00:39:53.354 - 00:40:48.984, Speaker A: What is the difference between the k three matroid or k four metroid and c five matter. So in this case, we have the unique maximal element in the posit, and in this case posit have more than one unique, more than one maximum matter. And unfortunately, currently I don't have any complete answer. But still, I conjecture that our value function plays a key role to understand this phenomenon. So let me introduce again the our value function. So we define the value function using the kte sequence. But instead of kt sequence, we can use h sequence.
00:40:48.984 - 00:42:22.094, Speaker A: So, definition is just a copy of the definition for the kt sequence. So we say that the sequence of h set is h sequence. If each xi is a copy of a graph in script h, and value for h can be defined in the same way by using the proper h sequence, then we can show that for any h matorite, its rank is at most the value function for h. We have this and this lemmas implies that if this value function is a Sam module, and if there is at least one h matroid, then this some module function is a rank function of the unique maximum h. So if we can show that the body function is how module them, that means that H. Matalloid is this positive of the edge material has a unique maximal element. And we can also characterize this unique maximum matrix.
00:42:22.094 - 00:43:06.194, Speaker A: But the last, as I said, fan h is equal to c five. There are more than one maximal c five matrix. So this means that Barry function is for shear is not submoja. So in general, this function is not submissive. But still, we conjecture that some modularity of this value function characterize a unique maximality. So that's our ambitious conjecture. Some modulity conjecture.
00:43:06.194 - 00:45:04.344, Speaker A: So this says that the positive of all h material is as a unique maximum element if and only the value function is the sum module and why this is important so because it might give a combinatorial characterization for various classes. Matter is related to the rigidity. So here, here are some key examples. So this is already explained. So d minus one coca matroid is kd plus two metroid. And if you look at the d dimensional digit metroid, then balkan rows prove that any k complete bipartite graph kd plus 2d plus two is a circuit. So this means that d dimensional dt matroid is kd plus two kd plus 2d plus two matroid and another interesting example is d hyper connective connectivity matroid by kanai which is which is a kd plus two kd plus 1d plus one motoroid this material also appeared in the context of the matrix completion program by Bernstein and here so far I defined h.
00:45:04.344 - 00:46:11.054, Speaker A: Matoroid on the complete graph, but there is no reason to restrict the underground structure ground set to the complete graph. We can look at the different graphs. For example, if we look at the complete bipartite graphs, then kd method appeared appears in the context of matrix completion due to Sinan, Kuklinku and by rigidity metroid by kadai, Nabo and Novik. And another ambitious conjecture is the following grabber type conjecture. So we may say. So we can pause the following conjecture. So each of the above examples in the unique maximum matter, each of the above example is a unique maximum element in its respective positive of h matrix.
00:46:11.054 - 00:47:39.834, Speaker A: Okay, so if this and this are correct, then we have that this value function is a combinator gives a combinatorial characterization of those matrix. Yes, I know that this is very ambitious, but just it's nice to formulate and currently I have no comment about this second conjecture, but I have several comments, some more observation for this fast conjecture. So let me explain this. So we could prove this conjecture for some special case of h. So if h is a graph in this list, then we can show that the positive all h. Matalloid has a unique maximum element and its rank function is equal to the value function. So here is pk denotes passover length k minus one.
00:47:39.834 - 00:49:33.950, Speaker A: This means disjoint union of k two c. We have also an example for the combination of two graphs and we can also prove that if h is equal to k 23 or like ck, then there are more than one maximal h multiplayer and in this case when h is a combination of k four and k two three, even in this case, it turns out that the posit has more than one maximum element. Okay, so this is a current result we can show. And so, this general context might be difficult, but probably much easier question is whether we can prove that this conjecture in the case when h is a tree. If for this case I do not have a complete answer. And in the proof we have, we use an interesting connection to the weak saturation numbers from extreme graph theory. But I will not go into the detail of this point.
00:49:33.950 - 00:50:23.574, Speaker A: So if you are interested in this, then please have a look at our prepared. And before closing my talk, let me give one particular important special case, which is a d hyper connectivity matloid due to Cana. So here in this matroid. So this material again is defined by using the matrix, which is very similar to the Li TT matrix. And essentially the. Again, the combinatorial structure of the matrix is the same as the DDT matrix. But instead of PI and pj, we have pj here and we have minus PI.
00:50:23.574 - 00:51:50.564, Speaker A: So, Mira has a question, I think you mean maybe. Yes. Yeah. Mira asked is it. The question is whether the case from script h minimum circuit graph in script h half size five. I have not checked, but probably agree that the fan minimum circuit graph in script h have size four, then yeah, probably the. We can solve the conjecture.
00:51:50.564 - 00:52:35.466, Speaker A: Okay. Oh yeah. So let me come back to this hyperconnective material. Okay. And so, this hyperconnectivity matroid is a raw material of this matrix. And this hyperconactive method also appeared in recently in the context of a matrix composition program due to bandstane. And it is known that this matroid is kd plus two.
00:52:35.466 - 00:53:14.524, Speaker A: Kd plus 1d plus one motoroid. So, any kd plus two is a circuit, and any kd plus 1d plus one is a circuit. And we can ask again the combinator characterization problem for this matroid. And when d is equal to one, this material is just a cycle materoid graphic material. So it's not a very interesting object. But it turns out that the computer characterization problem is very difficult, even in the case when d is equal to two. And this is still open.
00:53:14.524 - 00:54:09.744, Speaker A: So recently, there's a very interesting design by Bernstein about np type combination characterization. So this gives like a 3d composition type characterization in the context of the digit. But a counterpart of the Raman theorem is still open, even in the case when d is equal to two. So the case when d is equal to is a somehow interesting smallest case. In that case, we have k combination k four and k three. And for this case, we don't have a combinatory characterization, but still we can solve the conjecture, some modality conjecture. So we could prove that the followings are equivalent.
00:54:09.744 - 00:55:42.502, Speaker A: The positive old k materials has a unique maximum element and value function, for this combination is a sign. So those two items are equivalent. So this means that if the two hyperconnecting material is a unique maximum metalloid in the positive combination of k four and k 33 materials, then this value function gives a combinatorial character. This also further implies that ballet function for the k three district, the complete bypass graph gives combinatorial characterizations rank functions to bidigility matrix by Karai Nebo and Nobig, which is also equal to the matrix completion metroid of rank two by the singer and cook link. So that's, so maybe one of the most important special case. So that's the end of my talk. So I have a lot of questions, for example, some lots of different difficult questions, but I have also much easier question like, so this is the one I explained already.
00:55:42.502 - 00:56:39.384, Speaker A: So can we prove the some modulity conjecture in the case when h is three, or the minimum degree of h is at most two, it's a slightly more complete difficult version. And another question is, is it true that every maximum kd two metroid is an abstract d rigidity metroid? This looks true, but I don't know the answer. I can't prove important open problem is, how can we compute the value of the value function? Yes, so I hope there is some progress during this semantic program about those conjectures. So that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much. Thank you. Shinichi, are there any questions?
00:56:45.124 - 00:57:02.354, Speaker D: Can I ask a question, Tony? Yeah, just on your second last question there, Shinichi said, is it true that every maximal capacity two metroid is an abstract d rigidity metroid? So what? What do you have to prove there? Do you have to prove the rank?
00:57:02.894 - 00:57:03.674, Speaker A: Yes.
00:57:06.214 - 00:57:09.622, Speaker D: So you have to prove that the rank, just that the bound on the.
00:57:09.638 - 00:57:47.174, Speaker A: Rank is it, rank is equal to dn minus d plus one, choose two. So you can easily show that if for any, for any KD plus two metroid, its rank is at most dn minus d plus one, choose two. But I can't prove the equality. So this is equivalent to asking whether the matrix has a zero extension property.
00:57:53.084 - 00:57:56.344, Speaker D: But does that not follow from the fact that KD plus two is a circuit?
00:57:57.724 - 00:58:39.364, Speaker A: No. So there are a bunch of equivalent formulations, abstract digit matrix in the. Thank you. So it looks very, it's an easy, easy question, but looks an easy question, but I don't have a clue.
00:58:42.324 - 00:59:50.804, Speaker E: So I think we have quite a bit about abstract rigidity, metroids in general, and the combinatorial rigidity book that we wrote 93 with Graver. And there are also various characterizations of this, of abstract rigidity in particular. What I think is important here is the characterization of the co circuits, because how do you get a hold of the vertices? And that's sort of the opposite from the cycle. So instead of saying that, okay, 2d plus two s are cycles, one could say that there are these vertex cocycles. So the star of a vertex minus d elements is a co circuit, and those co circuits form the basis of the co cycle space. So that's an equivalent characterization to Viet Hang's characterization that you mentioned here, all of this. So it's quite involved.
00:59:50.804 - 01:00:06.884, Speaker E: And I think that your second to last question is actually sort of buried already in what we know about the abstract rigidity matrix.
01:00:07.864 - 01:00:11.724, Speaker A: I'm not sure. So the difficulty is how to.
01:00:15.304 - 01:00:15.688, Speaker E: How.
01:00:15.736 - 01:00:24.084, Speaker A: To delay this equivalent formulation with the maximality in the process.
01:00:25.854 - 01:00:29.110, Speaker E: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I see.
01:00:29.262 - 01:00:29.798, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:29.886 - 01:01:02.644, Speaker E: But so what I don't quite understand is your definition of h matriid. So not every collection of graphs gives you a matriid. You cannot just freely prescribe cycles, because there is a problem here that sometimes you are forced to the minimality of cycles that no cycle contain. Another is actually not easy to see. So you cannot say any family of graphs.
01:01:04.464 - 01:01:09.304, Speaker A: We can define at least, but I'm not saying the existence of such.
01:01:09.344 - 01:01:22.454, Speaker E: Matter, but some families of graphs will not give you matrix. Any member of edge need not be a minimal dependent set. If they are all dependent, the minimality is not a given.
01:01:24.154 - 01:01:27.414, Speaker A: So this is just a definition. So we can define.
01:01:28.474 - 01:01:50.794, Speaker E: That's what I'm saying, that if you say that definition is that every age set of a copy of any member of age is a circuit that I don't believe gives you a matriarch, because sometimes you are forced to say that no, no, contains another.
01:01:52.054 - 01:02:05.102, Speaker A: I'm not saying that there is such a matter, I'm just saying the definition of material. So if, if h is very bad, then we don't have such an h matroid, then.
01:02:05.158 - 01:02:07.870, Speaker E: Okay, then you have. All right.
01:02:07.902 - 01:02:40.974, Speaker A: Just. Yeah, so probably this question also contains the special case with other age matter exists. Okay, so that's, yeah, that's a true, that's an interesting question. Much easier. Interesting question. Can we characterize when the h matrix exists or not? Yeah, that's a good point.
01:02:44.654 - 01:03:07.948, Speaker E: So it's interesting that kns have the nice property that if you intersect kns, they cannot agree in almost all the edges. So that is a nice thing that actually leads you to the one extension property eventually. And that's what you need to get your rank.
01:03:08.126 - 01:03:08.720, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:08.832 - 01:03:19.484, Speaker E: So that's why I believe for the k five, you can actually handle your question. Just show that one extension works and then you have an abstract rigidity matriarch.
01:03:21.664 - 01:03:45.846, Speaker B: So I have a question about the k three, three k four matriids. And like, what exactly is known right now? So what is known is like do it. So you know that there exists a unique, okay, there, okay, there exists a unique maximal element, but you don't know that this is like the hyper connectivity metroid.
01:03:45.990 - 01:04:03.794, Speaker A: No, no no, sorry. So the current situation is even worse. So I can just prove the equivalence of those two items, but I don't know whether the posit has a unique maximal element.
01:04:05.614 - 01:04:07.594, Speaker B: Oh, okay, I see.
01:04:08.054 - 01:04:17.994, Speaker A: So what I'm saying is that if there is a unique maximum, then its rank function will be, is characterized by this value function.
01:04:18.894 - 01:04:26.834, Speaker B: I see. And so where, I mean, where did you run into difficulty with this? I'm curious.
01:04:28.314 - 01:04:33.814, Speaker A: Well, simply, I don't have any tool to prove the maximality.
01:04:34.314 - 01:04:35.154, Speaker B: Okay.
01:04:35.314 - 01:05:16.564, Speaker A: Yeah. The difficulty is actually that we don't have a constructive procedure for this method. In case of the k five methods, we had nice constructive characterization for the base in the k five cohactor matrix. And we use this for showing that two cofactor matroid is a unique maximal k five matroid. But we don't have such a nice constructive characterization for this case.
01:05:19.284 - 01:05:20.384, Speaker B: Cool, thanks.
01:05:20.764 - 01:05:58.092, Speaker F: Okay, so I had a question about, first of all, shinichi, this is a very nice paper, nice talk. It gives illuminates when unique maximum metroids might exist and when not. I was curious about this weakly saturated sequence. It seems like, tell me if I'm wrong. It seems like when you're showing, I mean, of course you're showing in many cases that things are not unique. And that's not what my question is about. It's when you show that a maximal metroid is unique, it seems like there are some results that you have, I just looked at your archive, by the.
01:05:58.108 - 01:05:58.664, Speaker D: Way.
01:06:00.444 - 01:06:41.904, Speaker F: That rely on this weekly saturated sequence and do not require a representation. But there are other results, like the cofactor one and all the bipartite ones that actually require a representation to prove the uniqueness. Can you tell us when you need the representation and when the simple result using this weakly saturated sequence, which does not seem to need a representation. What sort of separates the two when you can use one and when you can't?
01:06:43.644 - 01:07:06.524, Speaker A: I don't have an answer, but currently. So what I can say is that this results from the weekly saturated sequence can be only used when we know only from our target motoroid is a very simple structure. And.
01:07:08.824 - 01:07:15.404, Speaker F: By which you mean what is the target metroid? You mean the final unique maximal matrix, that's what you mean.
01:07:16.544 - 01:08:22.284, Speaker A: We guess the final unique maximum metroid fast and we try to show that for this matrix we have the rank function is equal to the this body function. And for showing this we can use the results from the weekly saturated sequence. But this is only possible when the flat of the target method has a very simple structure. It's because the result from result on the weekly subject sequence also very limited. So probably we can still, we may have even more like a result. Just we recently learned this connection, so maybe we have more.
01:08:24.764 - 01:08:26.348, Speaker F: This connection with the flats.
01:08:26.396 - 01:08:34.788, Speaker A: You mean this connection of our connection of our body function to the weekly subjects.
01:08:34.956 - 01:08:35.864, Speaker F: I see.
01:08:38.244 - 01:08:39.564, Speaker A: From the extreme graph theory.
