00:00:00.360 - 00:01:26.824, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to point out is an article related to mathematics in the Financial Times. That's a british newspaper published by owned by a japanese company. It's an obituary historian who recovered lost voices of the marginalized. Natalie Simon Davis, pioneer of micro history, 1928 to 2023. One reason this obituary caught my eye is that I know her because the operator seminar every week, which Chandler Davis was one of the organizers for since he arrived for about close to 50 years. Over 40 years afterwards, there'll be a seminar dinner, and often I attended and often China. Davis wife accompanied him to the door.
00:01:26.824 - 00:02:37.904, Speaker A: This is who she was. It is a measure of Natalie Zemo and Davis's influence as a historian. Most people would struggle to name more than a handful of Renaissance monarchs, but a good many have heard of an obscure 16th century french peasant called Martin Guerre. Or to be precise, they know about the impostor who assumed Ger's identity and took his wife and property before his deception was exposed and he was executed. Davis, who has died at the age of 94, published her groundbreaking the return of Martin Gove in France in 1982. And in the english speaking world a year later. The book reached a readership beyond the dreams of most professional historians because even before its publication, the makers of the Retour de Martin Guerre, a hit french film starring Gerald Dupau and Nathalie Bay, had used her as a consultant.
00:02:37.904 - 00:04:01.694, Speaker A: Oh, and it mentions, in 1948, she married Chandler Davis, a mathematics graduate student and fellow radical. In these early years of the Cold War, their activism attracted the attention of the US government, seized their passports in 1952, after her return from the research trip in France. It was a blessing in disguise, for she wrote in a 2013 article for the New York Review of Books. Unable for years to revisit France, she immersed herself in rare book collections in the US, gathering much material for her future work. After years of part time teachings, emo and Davis and her husband took jobs at the University of Toronto, where she taught history from 1963 to 1971. Then she moved to Berkeley, then to Princeton and back here as a professor of America. So on the subject of movies, which is how sort of how she started out, related to how she started out.
00:04:01.694 - 00:04:34.503, Speaker A: One seminar dinner, relatively recently, you can tell from the story. One seminar dinner, we happened to be talking about the movie, about. I'll ask you, I'll see how many people remember or know who it's about. Which mathematicians. About a beautiful mind. Okay. Yeah.
00:04:34.503 - 00:05:43.424, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. Nash, together with von Neumann, was one of the pioneers of mathematical economics. Well, he was a professor at Princeton University right. This is when Mister Davis, when we were discussing this movie, she hadn't really, she wasn't aware of it, but some people had been to it, had seen the movie. And after it became clear that even after John Nash was unfortunately banned from, he was unfortunately enough, not himself, that he was asked not to attempt, not to frequent the university campus. University ground misses, Davis said, but now I know who that was skulking around the campus.
00:05:43.424 - 00:06:29.724, Speaker A: Well, he did come to, he did meet me again at the very end of when you were coming back from an award, I think it might have been the Nobel Prize in New York. There was an accident. They might not have been wearing seat belt because they were thrown out of the taxi. That was it. Well, okay, you might, you might. I haven't. This came out on Saturday and I just noticed that it might be, it might be in the golden mail and see it in the color star or the national post.
00:06:29.724 - 00:07:59.164, Speaker A: Okay, so what have we been discussing? Well, one thing we've been discussing recently is the. How would you describe it? What have we been discussing about Pascal's final. Sorry? Oh, yeah. Yes, the housewarf moment. And that was, I don't know, the exact history of it. Brought up and discussed for a while, well over 100 years ago. Seems now that we have found a solution using methods related to CCR algebra.
00:07:59.164 - 00:09:42.220, Speaker A: Depends on looking at the pascal's triangle and interpreting it, using it to somehow work with the moments of a measure. Okay? A sequence of numbers, which might be the moment of a measure, okay, so. And you have a zero, a one, a two, so on, might be the moment. And then the diagram, the small pussies, which is connected by two lines to each point, connected by two edges to the two points, the two adjacent points and two points sort of below it, connects in the next line, next, next row. So if you say that, apply the algorithm at the sum of two such two adjacent points in one row should be equal to the number in the preceding row and you end up with a full panoply of numbers. Right? The full panorama of numbers. Maybe the, maybe the greek phrase pan, p a n is not so welcome after three years having it in a different context.
00:09:42.220 - 00:10:48.214, Speaker A: So I won't, I won't do it. But after all, you have, you still have the pan american games. I think they're going to be held this year. All right, so you fill out the whole graph, the whole diagram numbers, and then you notice that the different sloping lines parallel to the main line going down to the left, are they registered the various levels of various derivatives, discrete derivatives, different differences of the sequence, okay? A zero minus a one should be the number here, and a one minus a two should be the number here. This puts that equals that. Just keep on going with all the higher order differences. Difference.
00:10:48.214 - 00:12:23.352, Speaker A: Okay, well, remember the story about derivatives, that the economy, the higher order russian mathematicians, soviet mathematicians, had noticed that all the derivatives were of the, all the higher order divisions. In this case, I guess we want them to be positive, right? Of course, it's just a question of how you look at it, which you consider first. In fact, in two numbers, the point is they can all have the same sign. And if you say this plus that equals that, then that says that this is less than equal to that. The, this is positive, saying that this positive. And the condition then, for being the sequence of moments, is that all the higher order derivatives are positive. Okay? And then we'll get a measure, and then the measure of the whole measure on the interval, and the measure of the whole interval will be a zero.
00:12:23.352 - 00:13:06.042, Speaker A: That's the 0th moment x to the zero. Let's put the x's in here. We have one equals x to the zero, x squared and so on. Then it's the same algorithm. If we, if we, um, if we want to know what polynomials have shown the graphic numbers, we want to know what polynomials have the integral equal to that number. So you just probably the same algorithm. This plus this equals x is one minus x.
00:13:06.042 - 00:14:04.380, Speaker A: And this is, it turns out this is, we have to do a little arithmetic. But this one is x. This is x times y minus x, and this is one minus x, the square of one minus. Okay, so you just go down the diagram and it's interesting to fill it in with these polynomials. What we're saying then is the condition that we were discussing, the condition that all the higher order derivatives are positive. It's the same as saying that a certain linear functional on this group spanned by these polynomials is positive. Okay? I mean, it's, well, we're taking it to be an ordered group where positive elements are just these numbers appearing in the various rows.
00:14:04.380 - 00:14:41.764, Speaker A: Note that these maps are injected. So it's increasing sequence of subgroups of some polymers. So the overall group is. But then it goes on like this. And it's really, really entertaining, if not even inspiring, how beautiful it is. So you have say that these are the positive elements. Then, samely, the numbers you get, the numbers you get are positive.
00:14:41.764 - 00:15:44.694, Speaker A: You consider it as a function on the group polynomial. Then it's a positive function. So that's ordered by Pascal then there's this other order. Somehow we got the idea of looking at this other order, which restrict positivity on the interval, on the interior of the interval. And somehow we got the idea of proving that the order, that these two cones were equal. Okay, zx is a group of a group. And then you have two positive coins, and it seems it's very helpful to prove that they're equal.
00:15:44.694 - 00:16:49.768, Speaker A: And it's really mysterious, because before you talk about the point wise one at all, the strict point wise on the open interval, this pascal one, you get a functional on the order group and say it's equal to one on the order. Those are called states. Positive functionals on an order group with an order unit. That means some positive multiple of this is bigger than anything. If you look at, if you have an order group and if it happens to be a ring and such, that the unit of the ring is the order unit, the special order unit, not what you're talking about. I guess you could just say the rate, the unit is an order unit. And then you talk about the state normalized with respect to this unit.
00:16:49.768 - 00:17:44.064, Speaker A: And the states form a compact convex set. And then it's on a, and it's, everything's countable, and it sits on a contact compact convex subset of what's called a locally convex space. So it's well behaved behind no one's run. You know, you would know that this compact convex set of state is generated by its extreme point. It's the smallest compact convex containing the extreme point. Okay, well, so it's interesting to try to determine the extreme points. Well, it turns out that if it's a ring, then the extreme points are multiplicative.
00:17:44.064 - 00:18:34.010, Speaker A: Then that's very easy. Where you just modify polynomials, it isn't very easy to say that they perceive the cream points are just parameterized by extreme states are just parameterized by the closed interval zero one the state. So it's equal to one. The generator of the first zero equals one. There in the second row, it's equal to, say, t at x and one minus t at one minus x. And those, those are both positive numbers. Those are supposed to be positive numbers because these are positive elements in the positive column.
00:18:34.010 - 00:19:40.330, Speaker A: Forget about the point wise one for the moment, which is the same. So it's just must be some number which is greater than or equal to zero and one minus of greater than equal to zero. That means it's less than or equal to one. So the interval zero is extreme points. Extreme points. Well, now, how many people have worked with extreme points of a convex set. This is a standard, okay? You could maybe have a course on convex or books on convex, okay? So this is an incomplete discussion to introduce someone to the subject thoroughly, okay? So I'm just saying that if you have compact convex set and it's in the topology, that's advisable accountability.
00:19:40.330 - 00:20:47.062, Speaker A: And the extreme points, a set of extreme points form a Borel set. In fact, in this case, it's a compact subject. The whole set is compact. And the extreme point from the compact subject, because the topology you have to check, it's not hard to check that the topology on the stage. So we'd start the public, you, point wise convergence. If states converge on a particular on each single polynomial, and then that's convergence, okay? That's the topology that's compact and because, okay, but what's important is that if you have any point in the compact convex, then it's an average of extreme points. Now, what does an average mean? It's not necessarily a finite average.
00:20:47.062 - 00:21:15.572, Speaker A: It's a finite dimensional simplex. Everyone's familiar with what a finite dimensional simplex is. It's big words for familiar things. It's in two dimensions in the plane, if you have a two dimensional symbol. Yeah. It's a triangle, right? Are you familiar with that? Okay, you know, you're familiar with triangles? Okay, well, actually that's, those are already interesting, right? But that's high school geometry. A lot of high school.
00:21:15.572 - 00:21:50.884, Speaker A: What goes beyond that? Circles, ellipses and so on. At least used to. Used to, but in three dimensions, it's. Okay, here's a riddle. Here's a quiz question. If you look at an egyptian pyramid, is it a three dimensional simplex or not? All right, good, good thinking. Because several of the faces, all of the faces are triangles, except for the one you can't see.
00:21:50.884 - 00:22:33.912, Speaker A: So you might dump these inclusions. I think I've done that in the past. But anyway, so, finite dimensional synthesis. Every point is a finite weighted average of finite remaining extreme test. By the way, this is a simplex. It's, we're not going to need that because it's true for any compact convex, at every point is a, is a average with respect to a measure on the extreme point with respect to a probability measure. But that's exactly what we're trying to find, right? That.
00:22:33.912 - 00:23:32.694, Speaker A: What does the whole house moment problem say? It says that if you have measures on the interval zero one, then the moments are given this way. In other words, they come from a functional. On the this order group and the screen points are states are the integral zero one. And if it's a measure, it gives you a, gives you a state. Or if it's a point, that if it's a point and if it is a state, then you have a measure by the general theory of convex sets. You have a measure on the set of extreme points, and the state is the average of the extreme points, which is the average of the points on the interval zero one. That means when you integrate, what that means is when you integrate a polynomial, you integrate it with respect to that measure over the integral zero one.
00:23:32.694 - 00:24:15.366, Speaker A: Okay, so going through things quickly, but this is all, this is already the. Well, okay, there's a question. We have the measure in on polynomials. The integral respect of the measure is the what the given measure is with respect to polynomials. To determine the measure, we determine the measure on integral zero one. You have to prove that that's a general theorem. If you know the wires cross approximation theorem, then the polynomials are dense, and so the measure is determined.
00:24:15.366 - 00:25:13.114, Speaker A: The measure is the one coming from the theory of convex sets. Okay? If we don't, in general, even if we know the polynomials are dense, we don't know the measure of continuous with respect to the sup norm. We just know it's a positive function. But if we knew the order structure coming from this point wide order were the same as this, then we would know the function of those continuous and polynomials with respect to the soup norm on the interval zero one. It's sort of a long story, and maybe even it's too much trouble to make it an essay, but I would welcome either one essay one or essay two to be about Pascal's triangle. And it's its historical significance. Its significance in relating to history with the healthcare moment problem.
00:25:13.114 - 00:25:46.888, Speaker A: Yes. Well, well, yes. We're discussing the proof. Okay? Yeah. And that's the condition is that all the higher, all the higher order differences are also positive. Well, yes, I just said, as I just said. Well, it's different.
00:25:46.888 - 00:26:28.540, Speaker A: It's the derivative. It's the discrete derivatives of the moment sequence. Well, yeah, that's not. Well, not in itself. We have a good, I mean, if you just look at no one diagram, no one diagonal is a moment sequence without all the other diagonals having positive entries. Okay? But what you're observing is something really neat, really nice. If you forget about the, if you fill out the whole diagram, but then you forget about the first sloping line and you only look at all the ones from this, from this, then there's all positive and they have the same algorithm.
00:26:28.540 - 00:27:02.628, Speaker A: This is that and so on. So that means that of course, the number here is not one, but it's some number. So this second sequence of positive numbers is a moment sequence for some measure also. Yeah, that's a nice observation. So you get a whole sequence of measures. Be interesting to see. You know, you could, like this hasn't occurred to me before, but you might be interested in terms of the measures.
00:27:02.628 - 00:27:41.014, Speaker A: Find, but some find out if there's a simple relationship between the two methods. There's one, one, for instance, of absolutely continuous respect for the second one. Here's the second one, for instance. This is just a random guess, but this is absolutely continuous with respect to the first measure in the sense of measures, in the sense of magnitude. You might take a look at that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because sort of a.
00:27:41.014 - 00:28:19.834, Speaker A: Taking the moment, sorry, taking the differences of the moment is a slightly non obvious construction. Okay, that's a good question. All right. You know, this is a really interesting topic. You could keep. I could, I could be happy to keep talking about it, but I think we ought to get back, you know, case theory and systole is so important, there's so many other applications. I think we ought to get back to the main stream.
00:28:19.834 - 00:29:13.144, Speaker A: And one of the main theorems is block free distribute. This is a setting for af algebras, and it doesn't have anything to do with bot pure identity. As I pointed out, there is a theorem for af algebras that directly uses Bach versus. Okay, that's the. If you have in sea strings, it's quite interesting to look at some tensions of one feature algebra by another. You have a closed two sided ideal of a big algebra, and then you have both. And of course, let's call it a short exact sequence.
00:29:13.144 - 00:30:18.420, Speaker A: Well, you get a sequence of k groups from zero goes to k zero of I goes to k zero, of a goes to k zero, k over I goes to zero. This is or k zero, which is k zero, zero. So this is a short exact sequence, right? That short means you have zeros at the end, not the jargon, logical output. And then in the middle, it means in the middle, there's some exact in all three places. So it means the first math is in first non zero map is injected, and the last one is surjective. Well, there are only two maps, non zero, only two non zero maps. The first one is injected and the second one is projected.
00:30:18.420 - 00:30:40.204, Speaker A: But then the exactness in the middle is something that is a little more complicated. Everyone familiar with what exactness is. Who is that in the back row? I can't know. I can't see you. I can't see you at all. Sorry. Quickly tell me your name.
00:30:40.204 - 00:30:58.184, Speaker A: Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Okay, so. Justin. Dustin. Okay, I'm sorry. And you? Okay.
00:30:58.184 - 00:31:33.516, Speaker A: And I. You know, I've temporarily got separated from my list of names. That's terrible. I assume you can hear me, but apparently I can't quite hear you. But I may be enough. Well enough I hope you can see. But, you know, if you were going to ask a question or say what you say that you didn't know something I was talking about, or so I should say more about it, or that you already did.
00:31:33.516 - 00:32:11.136, Speaker A: Remember what I was talking about? It would be nice to see people a little closer. Okay, so this is second sequence. This is a short exact sequence. The second sequence is short, but not in general exact. Okay, so. But it happens that it is exact in the middle. That's because of this particular function with an arbitrary function on groups, which has six values in groups.
00:32:11.136 - 00:32:30.162, Speaker A: And you get a zero here, took zero into zero. That would be surprising if it didn't. You get the same looking sequence. But in general, it won't even be exact in the middle. But with k zero, this is one of the special properties of k zero. It's exact in the middle. So you get a.
00:32:30.162 - 00:33:25.574, Speaker A: You get an extremely short exact sequence. Okay. Or you get a short sequence within an exact .1 point, which says, of course, that the image is equal to the curve and the same is true for k one. Well, it's not surprising since the k one is s of k zero, k zero of s of a k one of a is k one of zero zero, and then k one, y one k. So this is also exact here. K one is a over I.
00:33:25.574 - 00:34:15.942, Speaker A: A one is zero. So neither, neither of these sequences is, in general, exact in the middle, because there are what are called index maps in real or complex case, complex or real case, going from the lower right to the upper left, in the complex case, also going from right to lower left. That's. This is actually not surprising. Okay. That's because I, as I mentioned, we know that, as I said now, k one is the same as k zero after s. Box very dist says that k zero is equal to k one after s.
00:34:15.942 - 00:35:06.289, Speaker A: So by taking the sticking suspension, look at functions and relying into it, which vanishes both ends, either the whole line or the open interval. And in other words, s taking the suspension into a function, of course, it's a very natural operation. It flipped k zero and k one. Well, suppose we want to, in this picture, if we could flip this diagram so that the top one came to the bottom. What you do is you just apply it to the suspension. Well, actually, we don't. Okay, apply it without this one.
00:35:06.289 - 00:35:43.474, Speaker A: We don't know this one. Okay, but you take suspensions instead. Instead of a, take s of I and s of a. This is also going to be a shorter vector. S a over s I, which is the same as that they over I. That's an exercise. Then if you apply the six term exact sequence, well, a part of it that you know is exact to this sequence, then we get some.
00:35:43.474 - 00:36:07.386, Speaker A: We'll get the same sequence as this, the same fixed term sequence as this with suspensions everywhere. But then if we take the. But the suspension comes right after the cave. Right. If we take away the suspension and switch zero and one, what happens is this just gets flipped up like that. So we get a map coming down here. Now, of course, we don't get a map here, but we all.
00:36:07.386 - 00:36:45.844, Speaker A: We know there is one. Okay, so, because. Because this is now k zero. Okay, so I'm getting ahead of myself, behind myself. One or the other. I don't know which is better. Everyone see what I'm saying? Okay, so in other words, because s flips k one and k zero, if you.
00:36:45.844 - 00:37:38.844, Speaker A: So really, we only have to know one of these exactness in the middle here and then the exactness here and here, we know before the flip, this is called the index map, or the even index map because it ends in k zero. And the other map, which we. I did give a suggestion, a candidate for what it might be, for what it is, in fact, how uniquely it turns out. But April, we have. We don't have exactly some. Well, it was coming here, starting here, going to messing things up a bit. Keep practical what zeros are.
00:37:38.844 - 00:39:03.654, Speaker A: If you do have a map, even index math, I should do both real and complex, which has exactness on the tail side of the elbow and on the head side of the arrow. Then when you flip, you'll get. This arrow will get transformed into this arrow into an arrow, which will give you exactness from. Give you exactness at the tail and also at the end. So you have a six term sequence in leaving out the zeros, of course, which is exact everywhere. And this is equivalent to bot pure dystrophy, as I pointed out last time, because used bot predispose to establish it from the index to even index. And then to go backwards, take a special case where you have the algebra B as the quotient and the cone of b is the extension, the coordinate things on the interval zero 10 at the one end and converge at, at the other end, continuous at one.
00:39:03.654 - 00:41:17.318, Speaker A: And if you apply, if you apply, the 6th term is actually going through this, I'm using that, the k groups of C of B are zero, but zero, you can just move it off the interval, slide it off, so everything goes to zero. And you have isomorphism, says you have isomorphism, and this is the, says that the suspension flips, which is what we talking about. Conversely, if, how does this imply that, oh no, sorry, we've done both. This is a special case of the 6th term one, and the 6th term one uses it because this is how you get this list. And furthermore, the reason you have the two equivalent form is that this one is, is easier to prove, okay? Because it's less complicated. And in fact the, you look at the, you have to get a map from the k zero of the quotient to the k one of the ideal k one of the suspension, which have to get a map that uses licent. But the map you use, the standard map used in the proof and in the book is that it's the same as the stupid one that I wrote down in the completely general case.
00:41:17.318 - 00:42:13.686, Speaker A: But I was completely helpless, I said I was completely helpless to prove exactly within this, this is such a special case, you can prove exactly, and that's what a good part of the course should be about. But I seem to be stalling even today. Okay, but very soon we should look at the, what's involved in the proof of, of the even index, that there is an even index map here. It is just the stupid one I was talking about. But somehow in this case it's manageable. This map gives you that map. It's very easy to show.
00:42:13.686 - 00:43:44.014, Speaker A: It maps k zero to k one, k zero would be to k one of the two, same as k zero, it's k zero. We want to show that this very map is an isomorphism that would mean double suspension. These are always the same. What is the map involved in this case? Well, it's the same as I outlined in the general case, calling the stupid map, because what uses is if you're helpless for proving exactness. Here, here. So you start with a projection and b, or in a matrix algebra over b projection, right? And for that, and as I mentioned, as the book mentions, the slips of truth in the book has to be carried out at some point, at least at one point, it has to be carried out in the setting of a bandic algebra. That's not where you move down.
00:43:44.014 - 00:44:41.634, Speaker A: We have a projection and find this map we don't need for the user itself, a joint, I shouldn't say e because there's going to be an exponential involvement. Let's say P. P is a projection, okay. And what you do, you lift, you don't know projection, lift, that's something else. I wanted to talk about another application of this one. I was talking about if the ideal and the quotient are af and the algebra a is af, that's a consequence of production. But here the proof involves first lifting it through k ohms.
00:44:41.634 - 00:45:21.816, Speaker A: Well, no, you just lift it, what you do. So you have a, actually, it's easier to define the map up here. So you have the projection e here lifted to an h in a, everything is to some h. And then the production case h could be taken yourself a joint. And then you, then you assume that a is unit. Okay? You always join the unit. Then you can talk about e to the h.
00:45:21.816 - 00:46:06.416, Speaker A: Well, e to the two PI I within. And why am I putting the two PI I dot? Well, yeah, right. Now the trouble is we don't know that h is an idempotent. If h were an idempotent, this would be equal to one. But then the quotient, it is, e maps into e. H maps into e, which is ideal. And you take two PI I times an idempotent versus zero or one, and you get the unit element.
00:46:06.416 - 00:46:56.354, Speaker A: And that's why not to make sense, I'll do a heavy power series for exponential, involves the unit of the. And, well, all right, but that's about it. If it's a vertical element which maps to the unit, then it's in the ideal with unit of join. And that's the invertible elements of that. The definition of k one is the ideal. So what you do down here, I should have said p. I could have said p, by the way, then what you do down here is you just map p to e to the two PI.
00:46:56.354 - 00:48:14.984, Speaker A: Well, there'd be something, look, if you look at the suspension with unit of joint, then what's the unit? That algebra contains not only a unit, but it contains a z. You look at the suspension of v, and then if the unit is a joint, then that's functions on the interval, but they just converge to one at the end. Okay? But then function constant equal to one will do that. But also the function e to the two PI I t, where t goes from zero to. Yeah. So you take, you just, and if you call that z, it's just z times p. This thing will be invertible inside p, so you can't see this again.
00:48:14.984 - 00:48:37.774, Speaker A: Everyone know the joke painting. This is not a fight. Okay, well, this is. This is not the chemistry. Well, I'm talking to. I'm saying that talking to the camera. All right.
00:48:37.774 - 00:49:06.334, Speaker A: Um, by the way, um, that's not a joke. I mean, they want to work the fight. So. So you take ZP. And so that's an already in k one if you want to fill it out to be invertible. In the unital algebra, if you add one minus three, so that's it's still a stupid math, but now you can work with it. And so we want to prove this.
00:49:06.334 - 00:49:22.194, Speaker A: We want to prove that this gives us isomorphism of proof. Okay. A lot of things to talk about, but we don't have the room anymore today.
