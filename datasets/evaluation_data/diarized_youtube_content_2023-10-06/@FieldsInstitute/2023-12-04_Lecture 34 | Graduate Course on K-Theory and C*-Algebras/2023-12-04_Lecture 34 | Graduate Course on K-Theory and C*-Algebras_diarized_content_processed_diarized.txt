00:00:00.560 - 00:00:38.456, Speaker A: What do we still have to do? Well, we're in the middle of a calculation. Who's online? Oh. Oh, oh. How did I skip this? Well, he couldn't have. He couldn't have answered at least. Well, I guess he could have. So I just.
00:00:38.456 - 00:01:19.918, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I got a bit foggy around him. Thank you. On makeup Thursday, makeup Tuesday. It's called makeup Monday because it's making up for. It's a little hard to understand. I mean, what's the difference between the Monday that the legal holiday and the Sunday? I suppose the answer is that there are more Sundays than there are Mondays. Legal holidays.
00:01:19.918 - 00:02:27.770, Speaker A: And they figured that administration figured it wouldn't go down very well having. All right, so it's the same time, same place, but it's a different day. Different approaches to sexual theorem. One way to use a high school basis on a high school number about polynomials. High school level, ordinary polynomials. If an ordinary polynomial is positive on the whole line ten into sum of squares, if it's just positive on the interval, on the interval, like zero to one, then x would just. X itself would be such a polynomial.
00:02:27.770 - 00:02:44.258, Speaker A: Right. So it's not a sum of squares. It's essentially. But the. That's the only thing that can go wrong is either sum of squares times x or some of the square times one minus that, or just the sum of squares theory. But that's included. That's included.
00:02:44.258 - 00:03:36.064, Speaker A: If you add x and one minus x is at one. Okay, so you just look at the. I got your. I got you already. And theorem follows usually from that fact. All numbers are positive on an interval. To take a finite interval from the norm, from minus the norm of the operator, plus the norm of the operator, and to prove that polynomial is positive, there's also joint operator.
00:03:36.064 - 00:04:31.070, Speaker A: When you plug it into the polynomial operator, that's equivalent to saying that if your operator has normal most one, plug it into the polynomial norm of the polynomial is the most distributed for the polynomial. But then once you have this inequality, then you're finished. Because polynomials are small and you know it's still small. When you plug in the operators, there's a kosher sequence of polynomials. Sequence of operators converges. Well, if you're. Yeah.
00:04:31.070 - 00:05:07.574, Speaker A: What you do. And your kosher sequence of polynomials can be chosen to converge to any continuous function on the interval you're talking about. That's the spectral theorem. That's one formulation of the spectral theorem. There's a whole work of continuous functions on the integral in question. Operators on polynomials. Agreed with plugging in anyway, then that was for self adjoint operators on the Hilbert state for self adjoint elements of the future algebra.
00:05:07.574 - 00:06:27.714, Speaker A: Just like there's also a girlfriend. Nine mark group, by the way, another proof too. Just as I mentioned, as I've already just using the finite dimensional case, that same inequality, not normal continuity, but continuity. Okay, but um, that's one thing that we talked about. Well, I figured that for a whole day. So something else I've always been wanting to talk about is af by Af. Is af extension of an AF algebra? By af algebra is afore.
00:06:27.714 - 00:07:32.304, Speaker A: Maybe you have to work a bit to prove this demo. We have an AF algebra and the ideal supposed two sided ideals. AF means limit to finite dimensional sequence of unit isomorphic finite direction and take the closure of the unit. Well, by the way, in the proof that the extension algebra is afraid, a lot like proving that an ideal of an as algebra is, you have to prove it. What's called a hereditary subalgeber. Well, an ideal two sided idea was a special case of cutting down by a projection projection. A is the algebra and p is the projection.
00:07:32.304 - 00:08:15.174, Speaker A: And it's also af. Using that, you have to also prove its quote of increasing sequence of such subalge. So that's not the definition, that's what you end up proving. That sub algebra looks like it's the closure of an increase in sequence. Definition of a sub algebra. You cut it down by h is a positive element. Look at h a h.
00:08:15.174 - 00:09:00.744, Speaker A: That's an algebra. Not closed in general, but you take the closure and that's called auditory interpret. It refers to the order structure of the silver joint. And that's another way of defining quite important subalge. Well, if you have the algebra is commutative, then a predatory subalge isn't ideal. That's a good exercise. It's ha.
00:09:00.744 - 00:09:44.600, Speaker A: When the h goes to one side, call that h squared. Right? So it's already an ideal, already an ideal application. Okay, but it's, that's one. But the major part of the proof and an idea with AF. And we look at the quotient. They have a projection in the quotient, but it comes from a projection upstairs. And the big algebra doesn't have to be af for that to be true.
00:09:44.600 - 00:10:10.104, Speaker A: As long as the ideal is the quotient doesn't have to be afraid of. You can always reduce the case with the proportion of just the complex numbers. Rather rec number two copies of the complex number, then that's what happens automatically in the unit location. If you're looking at a single production not the unit.
00:10:11.504 - 00:10:12.244, Speaker B: And.
00:10:14.544 - 00:11:54.784, Speaker A: The point I'm trying to make is even in this case, very special case, strategy is rather lift projection, either one of c plus c and you can lift either one of the projections. Why am I saying that? Because that's sort of silly, right? Sounds kind of silly. I can just say you lift one of them and I don't have to say either one or the other. So why am I saying that? You can lift either one or the other. Anyone want to? Okay? But this is actually really unrealized strategy of the whole, of the whole proof, okay? It's really kind of, I don't think, I don't think fiberglass is very common as a verb. Say someone is fiberglass. I don't think fiberglassing, anyway, this is fabric acid, okay? Because the strategy is you look at sea flux c and you say you pick one of the two soft copies of c and you say you're going to lift this and you lift it, but only after matrix algebra, but production, okay? Only after in the matrix algebra, adding a whole lot of copies of the unit, okay? In the matrix algebra and this, that, but then if you look at that, what's the complement of that? So you have the original algebra, which is the sum of two the units.
00:11:54.784 - 00:12:45.430, Speaker A: But then the problem of that, you have a whole lot of copies of the unit. You're filling it up the upper left hand corner of the unit, some of the two productions. Then you have the one everywhere else, okay, what's the complement of that? Well, that's the other projection in the original algorithm. Okay? But the point is that if you, if you try to lift the, try to lift the first projection, you know, you don't get that lifted. You get that plus a whole lot of other stuff is lifted, but the sum of, but if you, that's inside the unit of the big matrix algebra. But if you can lift all those, you can lift that and you can lift the unit, then you can lift the complement, which is the wrong projection. That's how the proof goes.
00:12:45.430 - 00:14:42.642, Speaker A: You, you surely naively find that you've done all the work, you've lifted the wrong project. Okay? That's how it goes. It's fun. Related to the course, which we should maybe just review completely, we had the production, sorry, the path we started, we were surject activity. So we, the domain consists of a k zero group coming to production, maybe matrix algorithm or item post. So this upper left hand corner was our original path. We approximate by trigonometric polynomial.
00:14:42.642 - 00:15:29.846, Speaker A: Then we multiply through because we're mapping into a group a priori. Just get a continuous curve. Well, you could make it unitaries if you wanted. Not with that one definition of k one. But it's the same as looking at connective components of invertible elements in a Banach algebra. That's all. It makes sense.
00:15:29.846 - 00:17:01.714, Speaker A: But we don't have to consider the sea algebra. We don't have to consider an arbitrary Banach algebra enough to look at our feature algebra and realize that the Banach algebra, okay, but because the whole domain of the group, this is a unitary. But we have our passive invertible, which is a raw phone number, you can multiply by one of these. These map into z. Right. What is the math one? And math can produce that. So you can modify it by z is the negative power.
00:17:01.714 - 00:18:12.768, Speaker A: So you get bona fide polynomial. And this one has a degree. So like when they fairly recently they discovered. A whole lot of people read about that. Trouble is, they were preserved because they were caught in a volcano. But not only are they preserved, if they touched and they fall apart, it's quite frustrating to read. Well, okay, but they figured out how to read it, right? You just give them.
00:18:12.768 - 00:18:34.364, Speaker A: Just last them with x rays without bothering, just while they're rolled up. But then you have to apply some mathematics, I guess, to sort of. Maybe they don't use x rays. Maybe they use what used to be called nuclear magnetic resonance.
00:18:40.834 - 00:18:41.614, Speaker B: Yes.
00:18:52.594 - 00:19:17.310, Speaker A: This is already. Something like this has already been done almost 100 years ago now. Well, 70 years ago. What am I referring to? Yes, I'm referring to. I've forgotten the name of the lady who didn't get the Nobel Prize. Just watching. Yeah.
00:19:17.310 - 00:20:26.030, Speaker A: Thank you. Apprently, she's the one that did the work. Second lady I mentioned who didn't get the Nobel Prize. The first one was enlightened, but that one, her nephew didn't get to die. One who actually opposed the word fisher. My baby's got pretty much. Well, I grew up in, you know, that was the cushiest babysitting job I ever had, even if there were no shavings.
00:20:26.030 - 00:20:46.344, Speaker A: Salary wasn't that great. They opened the fridge and said that you might like to have this or this or this or this. Okay. And then they showed me the bedrooms where the children were. But then they said, you might like to lie down here, have a nap. Okay. Yeah.
00:20:46.344 - 00:21:26.024, Speaker A: And then when Otto Frisch drove me home, he gave me a tip. It was after his wife had already paid me. Okay. I do think he was treated unfairly, but. Okay, so the idea is row reduction right. And column reduction and. Well, maybe we don't need to go through the calculations again.
00:21:26.024 - 00:22:49.834, Speaker A: Rishi helped us with actually end up with curves equal to one at one. Maybe I won't do the calculations, but I can remember, I think I can remember the operation. Okay, so the first one was you modify on the right, both row and column. Both row and column operations can be done by modifying on either side. If you look at one 10 a n. Well, I think what we want is z to the n minus one. Preserve even property as long as it were.
00:22:49.834 - 00:23:44.254, Speaker A: Okay, that the first thing you do, and then the next thing you do is you multiply by just z minus one. That's a column. I boost that. It turns out that you get a, I guess, polynomials in z in three places everywhere except the bottom. Right, but the. But you get zeros when z equals one. So it still gives energy, because the new polynomial you get is a degree n minus one.
00:23:44.254 - 00:24:37.754, Speaker A: Most n minus one, but the coefficients are two balls, but they still add up to the same thing. That's just how it works. That's you end up with a polynomial. Since it's linear, that means a zero plus a one z sum of a zero, and a one is still one. We could always. Then you can write it as a z plus one minus or one minus eight. That was one minus eight, writing in this form to compare it with the p z plus rapidly.
00:24:37.754 - 00:25:04.464, Speaker A: And. Except the only thing is the a may not be a b. Okay, what's distinctive about a p in a Banach algebra. What's distinctive about an item pose? No, now we're doing Banach algebra. Spectrum. Yes. It's going.
00:25:04.464 - 00:25:54.704, Speaker A: Yeah, or some subset. Some subset. Second, is always not empty in the spanish algorithm, but typically two points. That would be both points. But now the idea is somehow to homo tope the a to the p, keeping this a bigger path. What's distinctive about this is it's a path of invertible elements, right? Oh, every z. This is invertible along the way.
00:25:54.704 - 00:27:04.652, Speaker A: But, you know, it's homotopy. That means equivalent, equal in k one to what comes from item polls. And there are two questions. How do we get the item phone, and how do we get that a is homocofic? Well, first things first. You have a formula for the p, and you're lucky the formula makes sense for a, and you can connect a and b then by a linear path as element. And the formula makes sense for everything in between, and it gives you a continuous or some perturbed version of the formula. You look at the formula and you perturb the formula.
00:27:04.652 - 00:27:33.876, Speaker A: The formula which gives. Applied to this gives this. And then a slightly modified formula applied to this. Well, slightly modified formula applied to this gives this. Give a one parameter family of formulae and apply to this, you get the same thing and the other end of the path of formula, you get something with a p and then homophobic. That means the whole business is homophobic to the whole business. But then that means it'd be pretty easy to see.
00:27:33.876 - 00:28:04.582, Speaker A: Then the da must be homo. Do we even care? As long as he is idempotent and the path is almost off the. That's all we need. Right. Question first. Well, the formula depends on the formula, right? But the formula is. Depends on the parameter.
00:28:04.582 - 00:28:37.578, Speaker A: And it always formula evaluated in the Banach algebra. Gives you something in the Banach algebra, by the way. This is a formula, which. I guess what I'm trying to do is be abstract, right? Extremely abstract. Charlie, do you want to. Is it a related question? Okay, yeah, well, we're. We're trying.
00:28:37.578 - 00:29:03.614, Speaker A: We're circling around. This is an attempt at a pun, right? We're circling around a serious argument. Okay. But trying to come up with it, what it is. Oh, the a is the a is the old a one. After we did the row and column. Oh, and we did it many times to get rid of all the higher order terms.
00:29:03.614 - 00:29:21.944, Speaker A: Higher degree terms. Sorry. Well, the, uh. Yeah, the. A little. In fact, the algebra is a. Right.
00:29:21.944 - 00:30:24.944, Speaker A: Capital a. The little a is typically an element or capital a. It's from the very beginning, the. Well, I left out how we didn't discuss how you get the arbitrary curve of the vertebral elements can be approximated by a trigonometric polynomial with coefficients in the algebra. That uses the technique partition of unity on the topological phase interval, together with factor polynomials. And you get the coefficients, continuous functions in the partition of unity of positive elements for sum one, positive function for sum one, and those, you would approximate them by phone number. And then when you add up, add everything up, you have a single polynomial.
00:30:24.944 - 00:31:24.344, Speaker A: Well, that's your original question. And let's take that first. It might be shorter. Well, sure. Yeah. The idea is that there's a certain formula you can apply to this, which will give you back the same thing, but then that formula you can put a parameter in and you put a parameter in it, and it will give you, give you this instance at the other end. It'll give you a whole one parameter family of things, which, along the way, all the curves along the way will be, they'll have an a sub t will be a sub t.
00:31:24.344 - 00:31:56.784, Speaker A: In the middle, you'll get a sub t that plus t where t goes from zero to one. P is zero. You get this, p is one. You get something where p is right above, and then you're finished. Because it's almost. We basically just have to inspect the formula, right? And then check. It does the right thing, by the way.
00:31:56.784 - 00:32:16.184, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, right. The k. The k one. The k one is homosophil. Well, that's true for k zero. Two in the panic out.
00:32:16.184 - 00:32:41.202, Speaker A: But we're basically interested. That would come in for injectivity. For surjectivity. We just want to get homophobic things in the past. We start with a given path of invertibles, and we want. The homo comes from the construction, which is what the last line is. This.
00:32:41.202 - 00:33:09.164, Speaker A: This almost. This almost comes from the construction. You could say that. Find k zero in terms of elements like this. If you find it in terms of elements of the bandic algebra, the spectrum equal to zero, or one subset zero, n one. I bet you. Maybe you could define k zero that way.
00:33:09.164 - 00:33:55.146, Speaker A: And then you go into the ball. Homophobia. Then you prove that. So this is sort of one expression for what we do at the end. You could say that the idiom is that after this row, one column reduction, after this, linear algebra, everything is now finished except for the mopping up. This is part of the mopping up. The t is just, that's just the real number parameter.
00:33:55.146 - 00:35:37.564, Speaker A: It's just saying these questions won't arise. Maybe when we write down the formula, we have to write down the formula because it'll be obvious what the parameter. It'll be a little more easier to say what the parameter means. But what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to paint a picture in people's minds so I don't have to talk, I don't have to say, make a specific reference. How successful have I been so far? Jack? Do you want to come back to your first question, or have I succeeded in making you forget it? Well, you're asking me to spill the bean. This could be an exercise that you have element a, such as this invertible. That's the same as saying for every value of z, every z in the circle, just linear polynomial with coefficients.
00:35:37.564 - 00:36:14.174, Speaker A: It's the invertible element of the output. And this is supposed to imply. Who was it who guessed that the spectrum of a head to be zero? Is that you, Charlie? What made you think that? Conceivably, I have let things drop or you've opened the book, which is not a bad thing to do sometimes. Oh, good.
00:36:20.634 - 00:37:20.900, Speaker B: At least. Well, by the way, even if a is just a complex number, suppose a is a lambda, which is a complex number, and that already is a statement. And it's a statement which should be elementary. This is invertible. It's non zero for every z on the circuit. So the question is, what does that say in terms of lambda? What condition is that? What does that, what does that say for lambda in elementary terms? And so you have to solve for when it is equal to zero. And then the.
00:37:20.900 - 00:37:39.272, Speaker B: Yes, it seems like. Seems like the condition that a z plus one minus a is a condition that a minus inverse is n minus one. Kind of like, you know, cut the plane like that particular line.
00:37:39.328 - 00:37:40.044, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:47.544 - 00:38:04.100, Speaker B: Yeah, look, it's the simplest possible line that would separate zero and one, right? What's the simplest possible line? Vertical. Well, vertical line separating zero and one. Well, this is reliant. Okay.
00:38:04.292 - 00:38:04.884, Speaker A: No, but.
00:38:04.924 - 00:39:12.554, Speaker B: No but that's very good thinking. I mean, the idea that a Balik algebra property revolves around a property complex plane. Simple property complex plane that fixes well to wrap your mind around. And if you can start to do it, then is everyone happy with that? Let's see, real power equal to one half. That's the, if you have a complex number, then it's zero for some z, zero for some z on the circle, if and only if it lies on this line. In terms of complex arithmetic, it says that the land lies on the bisector, the right bisector of the interval zero one. So it's almost like the calculation in George Galovan 1234.
00:39:12.554 - 00:40:06.424, Speaker B: There's a map to a treasure which depends on orienting yourself at a certain point. Such a long time when you got there, such a long time since you didn't use there anymore. Then he remembered his complex variables. And because of a rope of 90 degree rotations in the transcription, arithmetic. And he found that he found an arithmetic show. Didn't matter what instructor was gave him exactly the directions for the well.
00:40:08.524 - 00:40:08.884, Speaker A: My.
00:40:08.924 - 00:40:47.514, Speaker B: High school English teacher said people gave the story with some suspense at the end. I won't say that the teacher got there first to math teacher, it was what I told was the story of a court jester. I got this from somewhere. But then they had to copy the ending too. Of course, court gesture had made one joke too much. I hope it just applied to me. But he was sentenced to the hunger to be hanged.
00:40:47.514 - 00:41:43.414, Speaker B: And the jury and retrieve came through so he couldn't resist. No news as good as this. Okay, so english speakers. I won't. Anyway, let's follow the same advice and leave a little suspense. But what the formula is, you apply it to the. I guess the formula is something that's applied to the a formula, something that's applied to the a.
00:41:43.414 - 00:42:28.294, Speaker B: T is exactly what you get from finding zero. You look at a and when t is equal to one, you get denied a potent. Because the map, the formula involves a holomorphism from holomorphic functions. Now I'm letting the cathode, the photo involves holomon function, which convey the identity map of the holoc plane. It'll take a into itself when you shrink it down. Then at the end.
00:42:31.514 - 00:42:32.290, Speaker A: It'S a function.
00:42:32.322 - 00:43:45.822, Speaker B: Of joining the left hand side of this vertical line. The zero on the right hand side is one. And the one thing the holy martial calculator does is it has to be holomorphic and open set containing the factor the holomorphic inspector. It's the functions are defined on that. And if they're continuous family, if you have a diverging family of them whenever family converges uniformly on every contact stuff, I guess it should. So you have, you have a compact settlement with the spectrum. Then you have a coating set containing it.
00:43:45.822 - 00:44:59.068, Speaker B: Then you look at the compact set, any compacts that contain inside the open spectrum, polymarket compounds a to z which converge on every compact set. The purge uniform generic contact subset. And then h, that applies an ht of a l a. That's the homotopic part. And h zero is supposed to be just the identity map. In h, one is the discontinuous function, which is polymorphic in the complement line, which is chained in the cotton, which is disjoint from the spectrum. Spectrum of something of a would be disjoint in this vertical line.
00:44:59.068 - 00:45:46.054, Speaker B: That's okay. So that's. Maybe you want to look at the formula and see how it ends on t. Okay, well, what else? Well, let's say for the foreseeable future, that's logarithm. I guess we didn't finish looking at six term exact sequence. We didn't check exactness data. There's some, maybe some definition of the index map.
00:45:46.054 - 00:47:16.592, Speaker B: It's not that hard to say. Suppose you have a vertical element of quotient algebra. Let's say it's unitary in the sea's drop the language and it lifts to a partial isometry. Not in the original algebra necessarily, sometimes. But after you passed matrix, then your invertible element, that's okay. One of the quotients, once you get something in k zero with the idea, or you have a partial isometry in the extension algebra, that's like having in p of h, that's like having isometry in b of h. The kernel and co kernel of finite dimensional, which is present in terms of telling the difference of elements, find that the level of groups and gives you exactness, and on your side being coordinates.
00:47:16.592 - 00:48:21.760, Speaker B: Right. That's one thing we should look at. Also, there was a memory we need to talk about half exactly a zero large algebra and something in it that maps into zero. In k zero quotient. Something in k zero would be a big outcome, perhaps into zero and k zero proportion. Does it come from something in k zero of the ideal? But we wanted to know, one thing that we just stated was true, was if you have a talk about ideal, you have two projections in the sea structure, and if they're very good of an equivalent, then in fact if you go to matrices, they're unitarily equivalent. And not only that, if you go to larger matrices, they're unitarily equivalent by unitary, that's connected by a path to identity.
00:48:21.760 - 00:49:14.332, Speaker B: So if it is in a quotient, that unitary would lift okay, which is what you use in the, in the documents, copy documents. It's fairly easy. Second step is quite easy, is in the connected component of the vendor and in the next two unitary upstairs. And that unitary upstairs, if you cut it down to the upper left hand corner of production, it gives you a parser hypothetical. So that's the definition of the index number. That's, that's how you prove that it exists. I said it's true.
00:49:14.332 - 00:49:39.124, Speaker B: I just said it's true that every unitary looks to impartialize other training in matrix, but you have to find it. Now in the book they give you a special one. Well, that's what I just mentioned. Now it doesn't matter which one it is. That's a little more, I shouldn't say it, because the book you mentioned suggested this, but I think it's more relevant.
00:49:39.864 - 00:49:40.804, Speaker A: If you.
00:49:42.664 - 00:50:09.700, Speaker B: Definition doesn't depend on a particular construction and partial isometric. Okay, but what's the first step? If you have, this is a very elementary step now, nothing to do with each stated, I have two suggestions that are equivalent and they're unitarily equivalent in the two by two matrix out there.
00:50:09.732 - 00:50:10.196, Speaker A: Two steps.
00:50:10.220 - 00:50:54.434, Speaker B: The first step is projections are orthogonal and equivalent, and they're unitarily equivalent in the same algebra. Because you get partial isometry one way, then the other way. Take the I joint, and if you add it, that's unitary in some of the two projections, or thought makes sense because there is all, then you just take the identity on the orthogonal function. So that's how you get the two orthogonal projections for unitarian equivalent equivalent. But now suppose you have two projections, two arbitrary projections that are just very phenomenal equivalent. Put them in the upper left hand corner, take one and lift it up and put it down in the lower right hand corner. And that's unitarily equivalent because you just flip.
00:50:54.434 - 00:51:10.014, Speaker B: Okay, but now these ones, these are orthogonal now, so they are unitarily equivalent. So two times unitary equivalence is unitary equivalence. That's how it works. Maybe that's, maybe that tip for tonight.
