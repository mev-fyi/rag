00:00:00.480 - 00:00:34.828, Speaker A: Good afternoon. I just, I have another clipping, so I've got some interest. Maybe I won't read it. I'll just quote from it. How many people know the periodic table of the elements? Okay, right. I don't, I don't. Okay, I guess I don't mean know it to recite it, but you know, there's a, there's a method, there's a pattern.
00:00:34.828 - 00:00:53.186, Speaker A: Right. How many people know the pattern? Okay, good. Yeah, but, um. Yeah, all right, but, um. Apparently the pattern has now been exhausted with the last. With element number. Um.
00:00:53.186 - 00:01:19.994, Speaker A: Atomic. Atomic number. Atomic number. Number 118. Yeah. Okay. That's like saying number, right? Okay, you can't read the stop, but you can't read it after with element number 118, which is named after a living scientist.
00:01:19.994 - 00:02:01.044, Speaker A: He's looking for the next one. It's named after Yuri Ogunnessian. By the way, one of the points of this article is this joint effort. It's like the international space station. It's collaboration of different countries and one of them is Russia. And that seems to be on hold at the moment. People in different places are pursuing the goal more independently than before.
00:02:01.044 - 00:02:57.864, Speaker A: But the idea is that number 19, this guy, does anyone know what number 118, anyone know what the name of it is? Yeah, well it's. Yeah, well, yeah, well it's very similar. Yeah, it's with a capital, the small o, lowercase o, it's ogunescent. But apparently number 118 completes the last shell. That's what it's called. Electron stable level. So who knows what's going to happen with the next one.
00:02:57.864 - 00:03:25.408, Speaker A: One guess is that they will not be unstable anymore. Maybe they will last for a long time. Okay. Anyway, that's. This is in the financial times from a couple of days ago. So one of them is very unstable. Nihonium, number 113.
00:03:25.408 - 00:04:13.284, Speaker A: Anyone know where nihonium was discovered? Yeah. Yeah. I mean you have to, if you know a little japanese and the name for the country is Nihon, right? Yeah. Okay, and so the. Okay, so by the way, it's not at the end of an article that this is not just fooling around. As this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry awarded for quantum dots shows, the most verified pursuits can end up being useful. Okay.
00:04:13.284 - 00:05:17.164, Speaker A: I mean, who knew that splitting the atom in 1939 was going to have consequences? Well, the quantum dots are. These nanoparticles are now used in television sets, led screens, and to eliminate some timber tissue for surgeons. But exploration also matters for its own sake. If an unmapped land of exotic chemistry lies over the horizon. We must surely set sail. One thing I was. One thing I was trying to talk about today doesn't sound like K theory and Cesar algebra to begin with.
00:05:17.164 - 00:06:08.094, Speaker A: So it starts off again talking about former Soviet Union. We're talking one of the main constituents of Russia. As everyone knows, Russia suffered. Soviet Union ran into economic difficulties. Well, by the way, the smooth function. And it has all kinds of derivatives, right? And all kinds of derivatives. And if the derivative is positive, that means it's facing up, right? And it's driven as.
00:06:08.094 - 00:06:37.574, Speaker A: But if the second derivative is negative, that means that it's going to start pacing up more or less and less. Right? Okay, well, there's an article in mathematical intelligence from the late eighties. No, early nineties. Early nineties, after the class. Okay. But. By the well known, famous russian mathematician begin their own.
00:06:37.574 - 00:07:43.762, Speaker A: And in this article, I read that all mathematicians, all mathematicians in the Soviet Union knew it was over because all the higher order derivatives were negative. Okay, well, this is. This is a function defined on the whole real line. If you have a function just defined on the integers, you can still talk about the derivatives, right? There's a discrete derivative, something called differences. I forget exactly what they're called, the higher order one. But there's a passion talk about all the higher order differences. So if there, you have discrete time and some quantity which may be increasing at the moment, but recent history might be a level of increasing.
00:07:43.762 - 00:08:20.694, Speaker A: But if the higher orders are negative, then you know, it's not going to be increasing for much longer. Well, okay, what comes up with. Not exactly, chief. I've been making it part of this chief trial before. Pascal's triangle, right? Look at Pascal's triangle. And this is a way of. Of testing whether the.
00:08:20.694 - 00:10:07.054, Speaker A: What the higher order derivatives are what the higher order discrete derivatives are, which it's natural to look at. What the natural way to fill in the number here. Okay. The natural way to fill in the number in the second position, in the second row is you take, you make the sum, the sum of the rows add up to one that says what this number should be. And then in the next row, and you look at the first element, where it's. Which is the first point, which has a number already attached to it. That's the idea.
00:10:07.054 - 00:10:56.700, Speaker A: These are this and this the quantity. Okay? By the way, this one is the difference between those two. It's this one minus that one. It's the difference. And this one then, would be this one minus this one, right? Because the sum of these two will equal to that diagram. It's natural to look at numbers which are related this way, that the point is a few points below it. And what that's doing, we look at the numbers.
00:10:56.700 - 00:11:36.184, Speaker A: So the, uh, this is the original discrete sequence of numbers. And the second diagonal scoping line next to the first one. This is the first order differences, right? Then the next row is the, um. It's the second order difference. And so, um, they're all things are all positive. Just means that we can fill in this, fill in the whole diagram with positive numbers such that the number of any two is. Any two ones at any stage is equal to the.
00:11:36.184 - 00:13:03.982, Speaker A: Here's a way representing diagrammatically the higher order differences and saying that they're positive thing they're positive. Interpreted in terms of the problem diagram, because a single positive number, a zero or single plus number one. So you think of all these points representing coffee like this. A real number, it gives you a linear function on z, right? The number is the linear functional on z coming from the number one. Because we take the number n goes to the number n. And if you look at the number a zero one time, you have linear functionals every state. And they're furthermore what are called positive when you're functional.
00:13:03.982 - 00:14:02.214, Speaker A: Because the numbers are positive, number one has a positive value. So all positive integers have positive values on the function. On the order group. This compatibility condition says functionality. At this state ends the functionality group element, the generator of death. He mapped it down. Some of the values points to some of the numbers of the two points.
00:14:02.214 - 00:14:28.378, Speaker A: And that's positive, right? Positive function and the positive elements of the group. And this functional. And by the way, the sum of the values here is equal to this, which is the value of the functional. At this stage. On this. At this stage, this is an inclusion. This represents the inclusion.
00:14:28.378 - 00:15:34.054, Speaker A: And at this stage, the functional definition of these numbers by the choice of these numbers, agrees with the. So we have a function defined on the limit, the order limit, order group, positive functional on the order group. What's the significance of this? Well, has anyone heard of the name Hausdorff in any other connection than. What connection? Sadak, you've heard of it too. So in what connection have you heard the name house door? Besides the housework? This way. All right. Okay.
00:15:34.054 - 00:15:51.134, Speaker A: Well, I was going to say, except for house dork to mention. No, no, no. That's a very important concept. Okay. But he's just such a good. A number of things. And I don't think what I'm thinking about now is related to house dimensions either.
00:15:51.134 - 00:16:09.486, Speaker A: What were you doing? Well, sure. No, that's good, that's good. I mean, House dwarf dimension is not an elementary concept that everyone familiar with. How many people are familiar with. How do we. Okay, so that's. Actually, notice there's three people in the.
00:16:09.486 - 00:16:45.614, Speaker A: So I got two of them right off. Okay, that's pretty good. Well, no, but maybe more. Sure. Okay, but there's something else that comes up in measure theory. There's something called the house dark moment problem. Suppose you look at the big measure on the unit interval, okay? And you have some, you can integrate functions on the unit integral, for instance, from continuous functions.
00:16:45.614 - 00:18:07.012, Speaker A: Then if you look at particularly great polynomials, and if you look at the function polynomial one, and you integrate that total weight of the measure, that's the measure of the whole space normalizing the negative, that's the normal normalization. So, um, and if it's the polynomial x, polynomial x, function x of x equals x, what's the moment? Integrate one. Integrate x to zero to one. You know, we don't have to. I don't have to know this. I mean, yes, but someone. Did someone say something? Maybe the answer, I would guess what happened? If I had to guess without thinking, I would say one half.
00:18:07.012 - 00:18:46.314, Speaker A: How many people would agree without thinking? Okay, all right, maybe. I guess you sometimes know these things. Okay, so the point is that for moments are the powers of actual, right? I mean, the integral is the powers of x. There are measures and any measure, any. Well, if the measure is positive, that means integral is positive, integral is positive, then stronger on a positive method. The same, the same. The measure of acceptance.
00:18:46.314 - 00:19:25.024, Speaker A: But what the housedorf. Well, there was a problem. I guess it was raised by Hausdorff. Maybe he solved it too. How do you tell, what's a good way of telling the secret to numbers? Positive numbers. How do you tell whether it's the moment sequence or positiveness? Well, the answer is not quite a proof, not approved. The proof will involve the order of group.
00:19:25.024 - 00:20:06.764, Speaker A: Very truth, but not post order group. But the answer is that the higher order, the higher order derivative, should all be positive as well. Um, not only are the numbers positive zero's order derivatives, you might say, but the first order derivatives, which are the differences, is not going to be a decrease in sequence. That makes sense, right? X squared is less than or equal to x on the interval. Zero is a one. So, um, it's going to have a smaller integral, right? And then, so it's obviously a decrease in sequence. That means the second, this second sloping row is going to be part of the number.
00:20:06.764 - 00:21:44.342, Speaker A: Well, so, yeah, I guess we're going to have to think of it to prove that. If you have, if you look at the moment, then the higher order, how Stark's answer was that, that was exactly the condition. If you had a sequence of numbers such as the 0th order of derivatives are positive, first order derivatives are positive, second order, all orders, higher order differences, if they're all positive, and this sequence of functions is off to the ratio, it comes from the measure. Okay, by the way, now if I said something about this diagram. Just forget about the functional, just look at the diagram in the zest, okay? Order group, you get an order group. This order group, suppose this order group were just continuous functions on the interval zero one, and a positive function on that would be already a measure, already be a positive measure. That's in france.
00:21:44.342 - 00:23:31.174, Speaker A: I believe that's how they define a measure. Okay, the positive measure on zero one is a positive linear functional on the order continuous with our function on the interval gives you a positive. That's pretty easy. Conversely, if you have a positive linear function on the vector space of continuous linear functions, continuous real value function, then it just integration effects from positive matrix on the integral. Okay, with this order group, we're just point wise order. Well, assuming we could prove that the order group was just continuous. Oh, doesn't have so much.
00:23:31.174 - 00:24:13.674, Speaker A: Has to be a natural way. If these order structure. I should more be concerned about the way that the order structure coincides with the order function. All right, this can't be true. It can't be quite true. Right? How many are there? Well, all right, but I was going to, I mean, there are infinite integers, too. And these, these are groups that haven't been too many elements.
00:24:13.674 - 00:25:23.294, Speaker A: Okay, but I wanted to be able to say that the, nevertheless, even though they're both infinite numbers, the number of elements in the order group and the number of continuous horses are different. Are we familiar with the terms that say that different infinity numbers are different, infinite numbers are exact different. But we've been talking recently about. So other words, this order group can't be just continuous functions, can't be all continuous functions on zero, but in fact, it's isomorphic to a dense subgroup functions on the interval. Such a way, in an order preserving weight. Well, in order preserving way, if you define the order relation on the interval, this is certainly the function x times one minus x. You won't restrict the positive in the observance, because that's what, that's what you get.
00:25:23.294 - 00:26:14.634, Speaker A: It turns out that these group elements in actual way can be thought of as polynomials with illegal coefficients. And the order relation is exactly strictly positive on the open interval. On the closed interval, that's not the same thing. Slightly, that's a minor point. And it's not just ordinary point wise order. But that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because if you take continuous functions on the interval zero one, take all continuous functions on the interval zero 10 with this order, then also real value functions would be exactly the same as the one that a point size function.
00:26:14.634 - 00:28:04.508, Speaker A: So in other words, even if the order is polynomials, we tend to be a slightly unusual order. We don't require this polynomial. It's continuous functions on the closed, that's the order, that's the vector space of some continuous function. And if you look at the polynomial, well, this is actually, it's not going to be dense. It's not going to be dense because the values at the end value that can't be dense in arbitrary continuous function. Suppose you take this q instead of negative, and then in that case we take q of x, q of x, q of x. The polynomials, rational forces that matter even take real coefficients.
00:28:04.508 - 00:28:54.104, Speaker A: That's now uncountable. But still, it's not, the group is only going to be polynomials. The reason it's polynomials. Well, this is an exercise, okay? It's an exercise of the, I'm not going to do everything today, okay? But it's an exercise. You look at the, the radar diagram, which is passed down triangle. We interpret it either with Z's everywhere or queues everywhere, and it's polynomials in an actual way is isomorphic. The ordered group is isomorphic polynomials with coefficient riders n and q, depending on what you've taken, and isomorphic in such a way that the order relation on polynomials is this.
00:28:54.104 - 00:30:28.804, Speaker A: If you did say q, then what you've got is a dense subgroup of continuous function. The positive function will be continuous in the true norm, which is everything, all continuous functions. If you're french, then you have a measure in this country, many, most places, one of the two theorems which are called representation theorem. What's the other one? Do you have a comment or you're just thinking from your. Well, okay, well, there's even a one theorem that has two races in it. It's called the f and m reach theorem. Okay? In this case, it's two theorems from one and two regions as an exercise to locate rig one, okay? And that's an exercise to locate the polynomial.
00:30:28.804 - 00:31:16.770, Speaker A: Well defined problem. Of course, if it were just, if you look at the group itself, just forget about the order relation. And look at the group, the Zeds. The next group is going to be countable. Not only countable, but it's going to be isomorphic. It's going to be a free ability group. It directs some of isomorphic direct sum of count of the amount of copies and any such group, that group, that group is ISO.
00:31:16.770 - 00:33:06.924, Speaker A: Course it's isomorphic because the group of polynomials within the group isomorphic. I'm not sure that isomorphism doesn't come necessarily. Well, say what the basis is. The idea is to take a suitable base material over Z. Suitable Z basis independent generators generate the group, and then if you consider those as group, isomer also takes the only relation we're talking about here. So the question is, what's the natural basis for the conductive limit to? Maybe, anyone want to make suggestions? Well, okay, that's, that's a good, that sounds good, but I don't quite follow it because, um, you meant the sloping lines are going from the top right to the boards and all of that. Okay, um, but that's, but how do you associate those with elements of the group? We're talking about a basis, we're talking about elements of the limit group.
00:33:06.924 - 00:33:41.258, Speaker A: This is an increase. These maps are injected. It's pretty easy to see that these maps to the next are injected between the groups. And so it's an increasing sequence of generated groups. So every element in the limit comes from confined stage. That means you have to choose a bunch of elements, single elements from the different finite stages. Okay, but just don't say that.
00:33:41.258 - 00:34:12.528, Speaker A: Don't tell me the whole story, just tell me what the elements are. What are the group elements you take? What's the first one? Well, it's not a constant, it's just a label. It's a generator of the first z. In this context. Yeah. Okay, so this is, so this is an element of this group, or the number one is an element of this group. And therefore, actually, I'm sorry, I'm interpreting, number one is a real number.
00:34:12.528 - 00:35:02.494, Speaker A: And also this point in the, in the diagram can be thought of as representing an element of the limit group. And so you're taking that as basis element number one. It's non zero, so we can take it as basis element number one. Okay, and what are you going to take for number two? Basis element number two. Okay, you're giving me more than just number two again. Number basis element number two, natural basis element number two for the limit group, could be a single element. It should come from confinement stage, presumably from level two.
00:35:02.494 - 00:35:39.652, Speaker A: The witches I'm asking you to pick out some elements in level two. Did you say the right one? Well, it's got to be. It should be the right one. Maybe anyone is the right one. Okay. But if you want it to correspond to. Want it to correspond to x squared, then I think there's a clue.
00:35:39.652 - 00:36:10.864, Speaker A: When we thought of these as the moment. This is the moment. The number one is the 0th moment. That's the integral of x to the zero, which is constantly one. But then a zero is in the first moment. I guess I should have called it a one. Well, that's.
00:36:10.864 - 00:36:58.998, Speaker A: What's the definition of the first moment we integrate X, right? Right. But somehow polynomial X is associated with this point we're looking for. We'd like to have basis elements to correspond to monomials. Right. So maybe the best guess would be if you want to take this to the second nice basic number for the second nice basis only. So I suppose this one will work. Except this is supposed to correspond to X.
00:36:58.998 - 00:37:11.286, Speaker A: This one would correspond to one minus X. But that's. Look at polynomials. There are many different bases. If you take. But the monomials would be the simplest basis. Right.
00:37:11.286 - 00:37:39.416, Speaker A: Instead of x, you could take Y minus X. That's getting a little complicated. So I think the simplest choice of basis for the group would be just. You're right. But just take the ones that sit prominent position, alien position. Okay, well, that's. That's what I would do, given that I studied the problem.
00:37:39.416 - 00:38:37.974, Speaker A: Okay. No, but I mean, I think if you take that association, then the elements generate the group. They form a basis for the group. And if you look at the correspondence that gives you the same group of colonial integer coefficients, then that will preserve the. Give you the right order. One thing will be positive in the order of the group, or you have the group is positive in the sense that we're talking about 50 positive at each point in the interior. Even though we haven't really seen how the interval corresponds to this.
00:38:37.974 - 00:39:27.846, Speaker A: Well, actually we have, because what are the possibilities for a one? A one is something. One minus a one is positive, a one is positive, and one minus a one is positive means a one is a point in the unit interval. Okay, so there's. Where the unit integral comes in. Everything has. All right, but, you know, I think I've let so much of the cat out of the bag, it's gonna be worrying. Everyone knows a cat's like going in the bag, right? That's not.
00:39:27.846 - 00:40:06.208, Speaker A: That's. That's what. That's not difficult. Everyone seen the problem about hugging a lion? How do you catch a lion? Well, a lot of different ways, I think. There's a story about mathematical art, not only mathematics. One of them is the projector geometry. You build a circular fence, a large circular fence.
00:40:06.208 - 00:40:55.854, Speaker A: Okay, well, no, it doesn't have to be large. It doesn't have to be large. In fact, in fact it shouldn't be too large because you want to be sure there's no line inside the fence. You build a circular fence and then you get inside and you invert. But that's one thing I want to talk about today. How much time do we have? What's another thing? Well, a lot of things we have to. Some of them are, well, they're all, I think they're all a lot of important things.
00:40:55.854 - 00:42:22.076, Speaker A: Anything that. C theory and c. The algebra of course, is a limit order group, is the occasional group that the c three algebra, right. Described in terms of the Lim algebra, the subalgeber of the Wim algebra. How do you, how do you write this algebra? Now matrix algebra. If you make this point towards going to that point, this is a two by two. And what's the next stage? The algebra.
00:42:22.076 - 00:43:10.258, Speaker A: The first stage here is the complex numbers. So that corresponds second stage of the two copies of the complex number diagonals about. That's obviously going to be compatible with this one. Now the next page. M four. This one is m one plus m two o, I guess. M four has block diagonal subalgebra one by one in the upper left hand corner and the lower right hand corner and two by two in the middle.
00:43:10.258 - 00:44:20.674, Speaker A: Okay, I'll bet you the natural map from here to there is an exercise that means that you get this one in the subalgo without using the diagram. Also that's a good exercise when you just look at the Internet, turns the bond, you pick out subalterns without some diagrams, without looking at the, at the inductive limit of these two. So what are some of the other things I wanted to talk about? Sooner or later most of them have started talking about. One of them is lifting projections. Okay, from the quotient. The ideal is af quotient doesn't need to be afraid of Af. Then lifting projections will allow you to prove that there's big and stable extension algebra.
00:44:20.674 - 00:45:32.034, Speaker A: It's always true. If you have any algebra with an af. Ideal, ideal, direct projections. And that's approved using the six term exact sequence of watt for your distance, as it's called, allows you to check that the k zero map from the big algebra to the quotient, and the map from the quotient to the ideal k, one of the ideal is zero, the ideal is af, and a one of the complex numbers is zero because the unitary group is connected. What's the unitary group of the complex number? Look at the complex number. What's the unitary group? You're answering a different question. You're answering, what is the k zero group? Okay, now I'm not asking what the k one group is, but good.
00:45:32.034 - 00:46:49.464, Speaker A: So there are two questions. What's the k one group of the complex number? And what's the unitary group? And those things are related because defined by looking at the unitary group, and also for matrices by the connected component. So if the unitary group is connected at every matrix algebra over the algebra, then the one group of the algebra is going to be zero. Okay, so that's why I asked you what the unitary group is for the complex numbers, because the next question would be, is it connected? It's hard to say it's connected without saying what it is. Well, maybe it is ten by ten matrices over the complex. Can you prove that the unitary group connected without describing it, without giving it description? So maybe the description is a red herring. In the case of one by one matrices, it's good to get a feeling for something as good to make it as concrete as possible.
00:46:49.464 - 00:48:09.724, Speaker A: Following all helmwiser spectrum, right, for every, every problem is an easier problem. Maybe this applies beyond just mathematics. The trouble is, the easier problem might be hypothetical. Do you have any comments, in other words, you want to think about? Okay, good. That's how you can fill your exercise book with exercise, right? A lot of things pop up in class, and if they're later there, they pop up in your electrical, okay, so that's the af algebra, zero, k one. So the map from the zero of the quotient, that means that the preceding map going from k zero of the whole algebra of the surject. That's what exactly it means, right? Exactly.
00:48:09.724 - 00:48:56.630, Speaker A: We have some object. If that's exact, that situation is exact. That means the image is equal to the current. That means a k zero elements left. That's a colloquial way of saying surely where there's hope to require k zero elements, it'd be surprising if the projection has been. Well, in fact they do. And the proof is kind of, uh, Larry Brown one.
00:48:56.630 - 00:49:33.246, Speaker A: That said, so is k one. I said after he said, when I was doing the k zero, he said, so there's also k one. K zero has positive elements, right? You have a projection in the quotient. And the k zero element is positive. That comes from the k zero element upstairs. Well, that were already positive. Well, you'd almost be in business.
00:49:33.246 - 00:50:07.156, Speaker A: Okay. It could be very close to a projection. And that projection probably going to knock down into the projection downstairs, at least have the same k zero plus. If the algebra downstairs is af. I can look at the cases just finite dimensional, even just c plus c, because you look at the subalge generated by the projection and the unit. And so I keep that. If you have two projectors that have the same k zero class, they're unitarily equivalent.
00:50:07.156 - 00:50:49.254, Speaker A: And so the given production will. Look, if you could find a positive k zero element, remember that every k zero element is the formal difference of two positive ones. Furthermore, you can take the second one to be a multiple of the unit in some matrix algebra. Okay, think about that. Okay. Well, you know, it looks like we have this room for another hour. I don't know how many, well, not usually people would start to come in, but I don't know how many people are free.
00:50:49.254 - 00:51:24.510, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, today's Friday, right? Okay, well, another room for an hour, too. That's from upstairs. That's. Well, yeah, just about everyone, I think. Maybe not quite pretty. Well, if you don't mind standing for a while. It rotates.
00:51:24.510 - 00:51:34.274, Speaker A: But this room is. But if this room is going to be permanently empty, maybe we could move things down here, if that makes sense. No room was ever from the.
