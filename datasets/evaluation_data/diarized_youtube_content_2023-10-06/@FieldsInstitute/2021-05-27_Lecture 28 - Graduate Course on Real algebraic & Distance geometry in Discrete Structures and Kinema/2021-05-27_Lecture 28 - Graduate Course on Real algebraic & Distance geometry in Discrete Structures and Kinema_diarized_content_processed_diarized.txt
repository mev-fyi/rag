00:00:01.000 - 00:01:19.044, Speaker A: So there's, let's Gp be in a universal rigid framework and p is generic in the r dimensional configuration space. And then Gp has a PSD equilibrium stress matrix or Lanka B minus r minus one. So this is the mesome I want to prove. And it uses lots of tools from the convex analysis and the facial structures of a convex cones. Okay, so recall, so we recall some definition, extreme point and exports point. So we have a convex cone, convex set c, and a point x belongs to C. It's called a case extreme if the dimension of the minimum phase containing x is less than or equal to k.
00:01:19.044 - 00:02:38.914, Speaker A: So let x tk c is set other k extreme points in C. Alternatively, you can think extreme case C is the union of other k dimensional faces of a sea. Because other here I only include the k minus one dimensional faces because you can think about the k minus one dimensional faces in the boundary of the k dimensional faces. So, so extreme k, although it contains a small, can contain smaller faces, but it's a union of other k dimensional faces. So the smaller ones are automatically included. And what is, what is the exposed point. So we have a similar definition for exposed point.
00:02:38.914 - 00:03:31.154, Speaker A: So the point x belongs to C. Is k exposed if the minimal exposed phase continuously contain x, you see is the k dimensional or less. So the difference between extreme and exposed. In the extreme cases, the dimension we say x is the case extreme is when the dimension of the minimum phase continuous x is less. Okay. And for the, for exposed point, we say upon x is k exposed if the minimal exposed phase continuous x is at most k. And similarly we let expose, expose k be the set of the k exposed point in k.
00:03:31.154 - 00:04:26.104, Speaker A: Alternatively, you can think exposed kc is the union of the k dimensional exposed, exposed faces of C. So let's see, let's see a picture. So suppose this set is my circle, this is my c. So I have a point here. This is the point here. Let's call this pointer, I call it x. And I have another pointer here, let's call it y and another point here z.
00:04:26.104 - 00:06:31.464, Speaker A: And then z is a belong to extreme point xt zero of C, right? Because there is a, you can find, you can find a hyperplane that exposes this d and the intersection of the blue line. And c is exactly 10 dimensional. And also z is also in exposed t, expose t zero c, right? Because, because this k can be exposed, it can be exposed by this blue line. So k is in extreme zero c is because you have found, because z itself is a minimal phase. So z is in x t zero and x code zero of z. Now let's look at x. So x is in exports, why c? Right, because if ever, if you have a like hyperplane exposing z, then it will inevitably, inevitably contain this big, this big, this line.
00:06:31.464 - 00:07:22.724, Speaker A: So you cannot expose this single point. So you have to include these guys on the right, this point on the right. So z is in exports one c, but so x is in export one c, but not in nothing exposed zero c. But x is actually in extreme point, extreme zero over c. Because x itself is a face, x itself is a face of our c. Okay? And for y, y is y z. Similarly for y, y z exposed one c.
00:07:22.724 - 00:09:06.614, Speaker A: And y is also in, in extreme one c. So that's the difference between extreme point and the exposed point. So we have a theorem called from s plant which says if c is a closed comma set, then the k exposed points are dense in the k extreme point. So this theorem is an extension of the theorem of stress base, who prove it in the case k zero. So let's go back to the picture and illustrate this theorem. So, so let's take a. So from the theorem, we have x, p, t, c is dense in extreme zero c, right? In this picture, what is the zero dimensional exposed point? They are exactly, exactly like this point.
00:09:06.614 - 00:10:00.344, Speaker A: This point, right. So on half circle, this half circle, but without these two endpoint. Well, the zero dimensional extreme point has this included half circle. And then also the two, the two endpoints, right? And therefore you can see that the exposed point at density green point, the only point that's exposed, that's extreme but not exposed, is the, is a tool. It's a two endpoint. Okay, so this is the Aspen theorem. So are there any, any questions?
00:10:02.584 - 00:10:03.644, Speaker B: That's good.
00:10:04.424 - 00:11:09.594, Speaker A: Okay, good. Okay, so now I want to talk about the dimension of faces and the projection. So, so we, let's see, be a comma sf and m is a projection. So you can think about c as the, is the india EDM cone and m is the projection cone to some graph. So for example, and for any y mc in the projection of c and x is a vertex of mc inverse y. So this, this one. So this is the inverse mapping of m restricted to the convex set c.
00:11:09.594 - 00:12:14.534, Speaker A: Right? So let's draw a picture, right? So this could be a, this is a, this is, this is my convex circuit. And then the projection, something like this. So it's a, it's a, this is the projection, which is Mc. Here is the, this is the projection amp. So, so if y is mc and x is a vertex in the preimage of y, a vertex, I mean it's a, it's just a zero dimensional extreme point. So for example, if I have a circle, then the vertex is just any point. If I have a square, then the vertex will be those guys, etcetera.
00:12:14.534 - 00:12:58.782, Speaker A: So vertex is basically zero dimensional extreme point. So if x is a vertex in the pre image, in the pre image of Y, then we have a. So suppose that we have a face of x c. So the face, I mean, is the minimal face. In the convex analysis where you see face, it means the minimum phase. So face xc, I have. So this, suppose this is x and a face axis.
00:12:58.782 - 00:14:50.144, Speaker A: So let's say that this blue is a face, x is a point in this, the face, this will be the face over xc. So X is a, x is a projectile to Mc. And then the face kind of is also, and the face is also kind of projected to the Mc. So, so suppose here this is Y is Mc then, and then for this m, for this y point, I can, there is a face containing y. There's a minimal face containing y in Mc. And this, and this, this one said the face of phase of Y m c dimension of this is less than dimension of this is less than the dimension of dimension of the face of x c. So that, so that's, so the, of course, if x is a universal rigid, for example, then x will be a vertex in the preimage of its projection, right? Because the pre image of a universal, the pre image of the projection of a universal framework is just a singleton.
00:14:50.144 - 00:16:12.894, Speaker A: So this lemma give you a condition such that the dimension of axi is less or equal to the dimension of the dimension of the face of x is less or equal to the dimension of the face in the projected set, less or equal. So, and similarly, we have a, we have another lemma which, which sets the other direction. So it says if the lemma says if again, we have c is conveyor set, m is projection, and if y is in mc and x is in the red, and if x is in the relative interior of the preimage Mc, so this is in the right interior and this means this is the vertex. So the only difference is this condition. The only difference between the two lambdas is this condition. So in this case we have the dimensional phase of x. Axe is greater or equal to the dimension of face of YMc.
00:16:12.894 - 00:18:09.554, Speaker A: So instead of, instead of smaller or equal, so we now have a greater equal. So it totally depends on the geometry of the pre image of y. So, so you can see, if x is a universal rigid, then x is a, if x is a universal rigid, that means PI, m inverse. See m x, it's exactly x. And this is Mc inverse, right? So that means that x is a vertex of Mc inverse y, and also x is in the relative interior of Mcy, because x is a singleton. So the relative theory of our singleton, it's just itself. So x that therefore, for x to be universally rigid, if x is universally rigid, then satisfy assumption of both, both elements and we actually have a dimension phase of the minimal phase of continuous x is equal dimension of the minimal phase in Mc if x is a universal widget.
00:18:09.554 - 00:18:40.424, Speaker A: So actually, I think this theorem, you actually don't need to be universal reading. Right? So x could be locally universally, for example. For example, this instead to be a singleton. This could be like several isolated points. And the results can also hold.
00:18:45.204 - 00:18:55.024, Speaker B: I mean, locally rigid is enough, like locally for the pre image. Oh wait, I mean for the pre image of the projection to be a single point.
00:18:55.604 - 00:19:02.584, Speaker A: Yeah, or it can be, can be some isolated points, for example.
00:19:04.884 - 00:19:06.264, Speaker B: Sorry about the noise.
00:19:06.724 - 00:19:17.640, Speaker A: That would be like a locally universal rigid, right? I mean, locally rigid means it's local rigid in some dimension, but in the, in a higher dimension.
00:19:17.672 - 00:19:28.884, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's true. Locally rigid would mean I'm not just looking at the face of the cone, but rather for a particular dimension of the face. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:30.344 - 00:19:53.634, Speaker A: So, but here, if you. Here we can actually extend it locally to see some point is a, it's a locally universal rigid. But I don't, maybe there's not, there's no such.
00:19:55.214 - 00:20:29.334, Speaker B: Yeah, there's no such things. At least the definition of universally rigid automatically says it's global, which it would have to be a different name. Something like locally. I mean, in the neighborhood, there are no other frameworks that have a realization in higher dimensions. That's what you mean, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Locally rigid and doesn't have realizations in higher dimensions or something like that. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:30.234 - 00:20:32.394, Speaker C: Can you just find, I mean, the.
00:20:32.434 - 00:20:48.494, Speaker B: Definition of universally rigid just technically, automatically assumes it's globally rigid. So locally doesn't make sense. I mean, just from the syntax. I mean, you're going to have to use a different terminology.
00:20:48.574 - 00:20:57.142, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think what locally universally rigid would look like even in this, even in the sense you said it. Mirror.
00:20:57.278 - 00:20:57.994, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:59.694 - 00:21:01.324, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry.
00:21:03.504 - 00:21:06.804, Speaker B: Could you repeat that? I think, yeah. Are you kind of.
00:21:09.344 - 00:21:23.004, Speaker C: My Internet's not great. I apologize. Yeah, I just said I couldn't understand how a definition of locally universally rigid would make sense, or what it would look like.
00:21:24.184 - 00:21:43.974, Speaker B: Yeah. Because the definition of universally rigid starts out by saying it's globally global, it's a global condition. So, yeah, it would have to. Something like this. The following would probably still be true if the graph is locally rigid. I mean. Sorry, automation in all dimensions.
00:21:43.974 - 00:21:51.274, Speaker B: Exactly. So. Or you could say something like locally rigid and in the neighborhood, there is no realization in higher dimensions.
00:21:51.654 - 00:21:53.090, Speaker A: Right. Yeah.
00:21:53.182 - 00:22:12.174, Speaker C: Could you just go like, assuming the graph is non complete, go up to some really high dimension and then perform like a folding motion over some hyperplane? Is that taken care of somehow?
00:22:13.674 - 00:22:23.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's taken care of by the fact that the pre image is a single. I mean, we're starting out with the assumption that the pre image of the projection is a single point. I mean, that's the high point.
00:22:23.570 - 00:22:24.058, Speaker C: Okay.
00:22:24.146 - 00:22:25.684, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:26.744 - 00:22:32.864, Speaker C: So you could potentially have like multiple isolated points in there.
00:22:33.024 - 00:22:34.080, Speaker A: Yeah. Good.
00:22:34.152 - 00:22:35.296, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah.
00:22:35.480 - 00:22:37.752, Speaker C: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
00:22:37.888 - 00:22:38.896, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:38.920 - 00:22:54.742, Speaker A: I think this case, this result by Gottler and assassin may still hold for, instead of a local revision, we could relax this a little bit. Yeah.
00:22:54.798 - 00:23:04.594, Speaker C: If. If you just say, yeah, I was. I was starting out from the viewpoint of the graph rather than the viewpoint of the. Like this pre image. So that's good.
00:23:05.014 - 00:23:09.766, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So.
00:23:09.910 - 00:23:17.734, Speaker B: Okay. You should watch the time because we're already at like 1025. You want to get through the thing, right?
00:23:17.814 - 00:23:20.562, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but.
00:23:20.658 - 00:23:21.490, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:21.682 - 00:23:23.626, Speaker A: We don't have to hurry to last course.
00:23:23.730 - 00:23:25.614, Speaker B: Okay, great, thanks.
00:23:26.634 - 00:23:29.814, Speaker A: I don't have. I don't have something to do after.
00:23:30.794 - 00:23:47.420, Speaker B: 11:00 so I can stay longer, but other people would. So you should. Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks. You might want to just focus on the real, the things that you want to get across. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:47.452 - 00:24:17.784, Speaker A: Okay. So. And now I want to talk about the generic and local generic property. So the def. So, so the definition, a point in the semi algebraic set b defined over q. It's generic if it's local. If it's coordinates do not signify any algebraic equation with coefficient coefficients in q besides those that are satisfied by every point on v.
00:24:17.784 - 00:25:29.324, Speaker A: So this is the definition of the semicity which we have seen before. Right. And also, point x on a semi algebraic s is called locally generic if for small enough, epsilon, x is intersecting a small ball. So this definition, locally generic. And we now have this lemma, et cetera. If x and Y are both semi electric sets defined over q with x subset of y and x is a density in Y, then x contains all of the locally generic points of Y. They said if, for example, if x is the, is the exposed point and y is the extreme point, then if x is also, sorry, if.
00:25:29.324 - 00:27:07.824, Speaker A: Let me see, if x is a, if y is the set of the extreme points, and then we have a, we have a locally generic point in Y. So we have locally generic point which is also extreme point, then x will be automatically an exposed point, right? Because this, because we know that exposed point are dense. And therefore from this lemma, its post point contains other local generic points of extreme points. So this was the lambast. So that's how, how can we get connected its exposedness and the genericity. So now we have, this theorem says that if x is a local generic in extreme, in the k dimensional extreme point, and x is a universal widget, under this projection, m is also locally generic in the projection of Mc. So this is the.
00:27:07.824 - 00:28:05.664, Speaker A: So under the protection Mx, also looking generic. So what we want to prove is that we want to prove x is, if x is extreme Kc, you want to prove mx is in extreme k over Mx. This actually we have to use the universal utility of the x. So how do you prove it? So suppose x is a universal rated under its projection and method y be its image. And then from Pierce lemma, we know that dimension of xc is in the equal dimension of yMc. Therefore the dimension doesn't change. Dimension doesn't change.
00:28:05.664 - 00:28:59.484, Speaker A: So x, therefore x, if x is in extreme k, x implies mx. It's a k dimensional extreme point of Mc. So the green point in the C is a project to the projected to the green point in McDonald's, a k dimensional extreme point is project to a k dimensional extreme point. So, dimension doesn't change. And I'm not going to prove the local projection also preserves a local generic property. But it's not very hard. So with this other demo, we can prove, prove the following.
00:28:59.484 - 00:29:24.416, Speaker A: Prove the result. So. So actually we need another theorem which is from, from this paper. From, from this, sorry. From this paper, the corner shadows of semi depth eugradient is the matrix. The main result of this paper is this. This theorem.
00:29:24.416 - 00:31:11.344, Speaker A: It says if x is a proper convex cone in the equilibrium distance e and m is a linear operator between e and y, and let f be a feasible set of this, our linear system, then v exposed phase of a face in the projected set continuum b if and only if m star. The adjoint, adjoint m m v exposes face in the of the original set convex set. So. So there's a nice let's draw picture. So I have a, so again this is c and for example this is this, this black one line is f, this is, this is f. And under this projection f, f becomes a project to be right. So x is, so this is b, this is b and m under this protection.
00:31:11.344 - 00:33:33.034, Speaker A: So it says, yeah, if v is posed a face, a face of a continuum, b in Mc. And then v has to, of course has to be the, when I say exposed, I mean v has to be in the, in the do, v has to be the dual cone of Mc, right? And Hydron V has within the, the dual column c. It's supposed to mean that there is a, there's a, there's a hyperpolarin that exactly exposes this face. So in this level we can actually, if we can have a exposed, have a v that exposed a facing in the project set, we can actually go back to the original set and this will, this one will give you the stress matrix, the desired PSD stress matrix. So that's why we need, we need to go to, first we need to project to, first we need to go to the projection and then we started exposedness of the projected point in the projected cone and then we have to go back the original sets to find the, to find the stress matrix. If you do not have this use this projection, then you may not be able to find an exploding vector of this form. So, so because always facially exposed, you can always find this exposing vector.
00:33:33.034 - 00:34:35.964, Speaker A: But, but we need an exposing vector in this form such that the exposing vector is adjoint of some vector v. And that gives us the stress matrix. So now I want to prove the mintheorem. So the minterum says let GP be in a university really the framework and p is generic in the r dimensional configuration space. And then Jp has a PSD equilibrium stress matrix around exactly v number vertices minus r minus one. So the pro is good as the following. Select Dp is the EDM corresponding to the, of the framework GP.
00:34:35.964 - 00:36:24.312, Speaker A: And let's see if it's EDM cone and under let PI g be the projection. And then from the structure of the EDM cone we know that the EDM matrix dp is the k dimensional extreme points of the and the k is r plus one through two. So basically for example, right, so if r is three then you have 123456, you have six. So six through two, four two is six. So actually you can think about this, it's been paying PC at the, as the r stratum of Em cone, right, same and then as k increases eventually. This, you have the entire EDM cone, okay? And then we now have, we know that p is generic and which means that p is generic control revision. That means that Dp is generic in extreme kc, and also the generic implies locally generic.
00:36:24.312 - 00:37:37.114, Speaker A: So Dp is locally generic in extreme kc. Hence we know that the projection, a projection of Dp is locally generic in the k dimensional extreme part of the projection of C. So, so PI PI g. So PI PI GdP is also locally generic in equilibrium tk. And since we know it's positive, it's a, it's posed, the k dimension is positive point is this dense. Therefore it contains all the locally generic points. Therefore, therefore it contains a PI Gp.
00:37:37.114 - 00:38:53.504, Speaker A: So now we prove that PI GDP is in the exposed part of k of PI g. So from here, here we have high gp. It's a extreme point. Now it's actually also an extreme point exposed point, sorry, it's also exposed point. And since we know that the damage, the rank of the rank of dp, rank of dp is r, sorry, not the embedded dimension, the embedded dimension. Embedded dimension of, or this grammar matrix, dpg is r. Therefore it's actually in the relative interior of the.
00:38:53.504 - 00:39:56.182, Speaker A: Therefore you can say that. Well, let's, let's, yeah, let's, let's start. Good. So, PI Gp is in the, is a k dimensional exposed point of PI Gc. Therefore there exists a phase continuum PI gp of k dimensional, and this phase is, is exposed by some vector in the dual cone of PI gc. Since we know that the rank of the invariant dimension of dp is exactly r. So the phase we found is exactly, exactly the minimal phase, the minimum phase of PI gp.
00:39:56.182 - 00:41:15.798, Speaker A: So therefore, you can see the minimum phase of a PI g e p in mc is posed by some vector in hydrogen c. And therefore, from this lemma I have a. So. So v is posed minimum phase in the projection project set hydron, v is positive face in the original set in the original cone. Therefore I PI g I joint v exposes the minimal phase of dp in the EDM cone. And the dimension of this both faces is exactly r plus one plus two. And hence we prove that the gp has a PSD equivalent from stress matrix over rank v minus minus one minus.
00:41:15.846 - 00:41:16.434, Speaker C: R.
00:41:20.574 - 00:42:53.494, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the end of the proof. So, actually I want to discuss something about this college. If this, there's a question asked by Mira if the general position, it's similar, it seems to if you have a general reputation framework and also universal rigid, does this term hold as well, yeah, so for general position, for framework, in the general prediction. Yeah. So you actually need to argue that it's actually if GP is at universal, rigid and in general position. And then is this a framework also? It's post. So, so let's, let's say.
00:42:53.494 - 00:44:14.884, Speaker A: So this is the, so you have a, so suppose this is the, this is a cone, this is like a half circle. And at this point, this, this. So all these points here, right, x, they are actually in the extreme one of C. So this is c. So this is c. And out of the extreme Xp, zero c, they are actually the points that, you know, there's a point that do not include the boundary boundaries is excluded. Therefore, if you only consider the generic point is you get the exposed point.
00:44:14.884 - 00:45:53.734, Speaker A: So for point in the general position, my feeling is also it should be also in the, it cannot be pointed like in this position, right. But this is some, these positions are points on this here are actually some special, some special position. So, so if GP is in general position, then GP. And GP is in extreme point k over c and Gp. Yeah, my base might still be in maybe in extreme xpk and. Yeah. And if this is true, then you would approve that this result also hold for not only for generic framework, but also for frameworks in general position.
00:45:53.734 - 00:46:34.434, Speaker A: Yeah, but the hard part is we do not have this MLac based. So we have a theorem like here. So lambda, if we have x and y are both semi depth semi average sets different over q. If x and y. If x is dense in y, then x contains all the locally generic points in Y. So exposed extreme point contains other expose point is dense in extreme point. So it can turn on the locally generic point.
00:46:34.434 - 00:46:58.104, Speaker A: But, but it's open question if, if a exposed point concerns other general position points. Yeah. So if this is true, you would be able to prove the result for, for generation universal rigid frameworks.
00:47:00.444 - 00:47:25.074, Speaker B: So you're saying that the, okay, so this would require showing that all the. So all the. So this would say that the set of general position points are all contained in the set of exposed points, right? Is that what you're saying?
00:47:25.234 - 00:47:48.614, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in this picture that means that. So, so all my is polypona design. See this, this is the half. Half. This is like a surface, right? Like that sphere, spherical surface. So and there's a boundary.
00:47:48.614 - 00:47:52.594, Speaker A: So it's positive fun at this point without its boundaries.
00:47:53.214 - 00:47:53.954, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:54.254 - 00:48:02.302, Speaker A: So you would think about it. It's general position point. I also in the, nothing in the boundary. Not on the boundary.
00:48:02.438 - 00:49:01.074, Speaker B: Right. So here's how I think of general position points, I think of general position points as being sort of so general position in D dimensions, let's say, as being such a point as lying was, you know, the distance vector corresponding to that lies in the inter relative interior of the d dimensional strata. So in other words, it doesn't lie by relative interior. I mean, it doesn't fall into one of the generalized strata, which are the boundaries which would correspond to one of these gelimenger determinants for D plus one vanishing, one or more of them vanishing. So that's what I would think of as a general position. I mean, that's what the definition of general position tells us. Right.
00:49:01.074 - 00:49:26.544, Speaker B: So then, you know, using that definition, I don't, how could it be in a way that. I don't know. I find it hard to imagine how something that's in the relative interior of that three dimensional stratum would not be an exposed point.
00:49:27.404 - 00:49:30.424, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I found this. It's hard to imagine.
00:49:30.854 - 00:49:31.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:32.454 - 00:49:36.234, Speaker A: So I suspect that this should be true. Yeah.
00:49:37.694 - 00:50:39.184, Speaker B: This theorem can use, maybe we can prove that lemma based using this idea of, you know, sort of, it's in the open. It has an open neighborhood around it. The point has an open neighborhood around it, because it's in the relative interior of this, this semi algebraic set defined by setting all the Kalimanger d plus one and d plus one and higher dimensions to zero, or maybe d plus two. Yeah, I forget, I always get that mixed up. So, and none of the d dimensional Klee anger determinants is zero. So it actually has an open neighborhood there. So I don't know, I mean, I don't know what the techniques are for showing some point is that these, all of these points are exposed.
00:50:40.764 - 00:51:38.950, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so yeah, maybe I, yeah, let's say some funny words about this theorem. So in the same, you can see, so it dp'd in the merge digit. And actually you have to show that it's actually an exposed point in the projected cone. So it's, so it is exposed point in the, in the EDM cone. And it's also postponed in the project cone. So why we need to show that the projection is actually also an exposed point because we want to show that this is true.
00:51:38.950 - 00:52:18.754, Speaker A: So we want to go back from the projection to the original sensor. We want to show that there is actually a exporting vector of this form. And this, this will give you the EDM, the stress, the PSD, stress matrix. So, and to show this, we have to go to the projection. If you do not go to the projection. You may not able to find a exponential vector of this form. So that's the main idea of this proof.
00:52:18.754 - 00:52:24.734, Speaker A: Okay, I think that's the end of the talk.
