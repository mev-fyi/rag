00:00:01.520 - 00:00:26.434, Speaker A: The best part of the workshop. I think it is the cooperation at the first there are chinese students and also canadian students so it is a mixed group at the start. We are very hard to communicate a lot and also we should get used to each other's working style.
00:00:27.174 - 00:00:37.844, Speaker B: I think it's wonderful opportunity for, especially for our students. Our students really deeply participate.
00:00:37.924 - 00:00:57.844, Speaker C: Of course you can get ideas for dramatically new problems just from industrial collaborations and things like that. And also from the industrial perspective it's the exact opposite. You know you have a problem that you can't solve or you want to see some other ways of thinking or even generate new ideas. So good from both sides and it's nice for me as a student to have that perspective.
00:00:58.004 - 00:01:18.084, Speaker D: Also I think that the field institute is really high level and cutting age and I think the professors here are really, really outstanding. I really appreciate them. Maybe I will learn a lot from them and maybe someday I will become them. I hope.
