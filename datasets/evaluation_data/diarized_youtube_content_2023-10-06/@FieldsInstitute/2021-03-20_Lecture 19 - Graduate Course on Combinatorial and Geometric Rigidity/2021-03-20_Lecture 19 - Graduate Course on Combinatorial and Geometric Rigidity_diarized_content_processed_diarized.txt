00:00:00.120 - 00:00:04.034, Speaker A: Is about where I stopped. Yeah. You can see it's about halfway through.
00:00:04.694 - 00:00:05.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:05.190 - 00:00:36.266, Speaker A: Right. Right. So there are a few things that. The stuff that I talked about last time was essentially old news, but I wanted to mention some recent results that have been happening, like with the ladders paper and so on. So at least more recent. So, if everybody's ready and everybody can see this. So this is fine.
00:00:36.266 - 00:01:00.794, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you. For the two or three that are sharing their. Have their camera on. That's all very nice. Okay. One of the things for the universally rigid tensegrities is that you have to fuss about affine motions.
00:01:00.794 - 00:02:07.968, Speaker A: And these are linear motions plus a constant from the same dimension. Usually when you say, if it's an affine motion, it's not singular, but singular affine maps also are interesting. Now, the thing is that the first item talks about, oh, if you have a configuration and it has an equilibrium, an equilibrium stress, then if you do any affine motion, it'll have exactly the same stress. That's easy to see. You just take the linear motion through the equilibrium condition. Now, the idea is that, how do you tell from the configuration? Or you think of it as a bar framework, if you like. But even with cables and struts, if they do not lie on a ruled surface, then there is no cable in strut.
00:02:07.968 - 00:02:30.034, Speaker A: The thing is, they're supposed to be. They don't lie on a conic at infinity. And I don't think I've defined it. Maybe I'll define that in a minute. Okay, so, let me continue. Let's see. Yeah.
00:02:30.034 - 00:03:30.334, Speaker A: So, let me continue here. So, one of the examples, a whole class of examples, was essentially instigated by Branko Grunbaugh. And that is if you have a planar convex polygon, where you have cables on the outside, and some of the internal diagonals are struts, such that there's an equilibrium stress for this configuration, for this tensegrity, such that it's positive on the cables and negative on the struts. You don't have to worry about whether the thing is PSD. The theorem says it's always positive, semi definite, and in fact, the tensegrity is universally rigid. It's a general theorem. So, here's some examples.
00:03:30.334 - 00:04:16.396, Speaker A: This is one that has come up a couple times. This is if you remember your projective geometry. This is configuration of points and lines by Desargues, I think in the 17 hundreds, something like that. And the condition for this thing to have a stress is that this line, this line and this line, the three horizontal lines, in this thing, in this picture, will either be parallel. The jargon is that it meets at a point at infinity, or they all three lines meet at a .1 point. If that's true, then there's a stress.
00:04:16.396 - 00:04:56.984, Speaker A: There's nothing in desert's theorem, there's nothing about what the stress is like. But the theorem says that if that's the case, it has a stress of the proper sign. And my theorem says that this thing is universally rigid. In fact, I'll define super stability in a minute. This is another one that came up before in the proof of Cauchy's rigidity theorem. And this thing is, you don't have to have struts every other time. Just you can remove two adjacent struts, and the thing is still universally rigid.
00:04:56.984 - 00:05:35.124, Speaker A: In fact, it's also infinitesimally rigid. But it's also universally rigid, so it's stronger. And it's not, you know, there's quite. It's really rigid in either sense or both senses. This is another polygon that was described by Ben Roth, and there's a lot of other variations on this. This is a Roth polygon on the upper right here. It's, you know, in some cell, in some sense, this is very simple, but it's one example.
00:05:35.124 - 00:06:09.632, Speaker A: It's infinitesimally rigid and universally rigid. This is. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This one on the left is k 33, the bipartite graph, where there's a cycle of points as you go around on the boundary, and they have to alternate in the partition. One partition is red. The other partition is blue of vertices. Then you go red, blue, red, blue as you go around.
00:06:09.632 - 00:06:24.950, Speaker A: And you want them to lie on a conic. In this case, it's a circle, but it could be an ellipse. It even could be a hyperbola. But the thing has to be convex. This one in the middle of the bottom. I just made it up. This is another one.
00:06:24.950 - 00:06:45.974, Speaker A: It's pretty clear from the symmetry that there is a stress. But the claim is, all you have to know is that it's there. The one in the lower right is not of that type, but it can be created from others with this theorem. I'll show that in a minute. Okay. Any questions or comments?
00:06:46.474 - 00:07:09.944, Speaker B: I have a question. So, I'm having trouble reconciling. Okay. The fact that, like, for example, this disargs configuration, it has a stress, the way you've drawn it here. But this is a minimally, generically rigid graph. So, at least in my mind, it seems that this having a stress. And this being rigid don't mesh.
00:07:09.944 - 00:07:14.604, Speaker B: Like, how? How. Yeah, how. How is this rigid? If you've, like, lost a.
00:07:15.664 - 00:07:22.840, Speaker A: Well, the, the thing is that this thing has the correct count. Two n minus three. Is that right?
00:07:23.032 - 00:07:26.128, Speaker B: Yeah. So it seems like with a stress, you would lose, like, one of your.
00:07:26.176 - 00:07:29.284, Speaker A: Yeah, if it has a stress, it's not infinitesimally rigid.
00:07:29.844 - 00:07:32.068, Speaker B: But it's universally rigid.
00:07:32.196 - 00:07:47.144, Speaker A: Yes, that's the point. Universal rigidity doesn't. It's sort of indifferent to whether the thing is infinitesimally rigid. It doesn't need to be infinitesimally rigid to be universally rigid.
00:07:47.964 - 00:07:50.784, Speaker B: Okay, weird. Okay, cool, weird.
00:07:51.324 - 00:08:24.188, Speaker A: But the thing is, what you're doing is you're taking. Wait, I think of as you take, like, the cable, and you put this struts in until you can't do it anymore. And whether it's the critical point is precisely when it's not infinite. So that's the thing. The only trouble with the tensegrity is you have to have the signs correct. You have to have the cables and struts signs on the stress to be of the right sign. And this theorem says that you don't have to you.
00:08:24.188 - 00:08:49.844, Speaker A: The theorem checks the positive semi definiteness of the stress matrix for you. That's the thing. But you can't always say that. It's not always true that if you have a stress, even if it's of the right sign, it's not always true that it's going to be universally rigid. Okay. Okay. So we'll see some examples of that later, I think.
00:08:49.844 - 00:09:28.174, Speaker A: So this is one of my favorite tricks. And I realized when I was making this, you don't need the stress matrix to do this. So, for instance, on the top line here, you can superimpose the triangle, which is universally rigid. You don't even need the stress matrix to do that. And even the one on the next one, the square. But you can do it with elementary means. But it's real easy with the stress matrix as well, since it's only got one non zero eigenvalue.
00:09:28.174 - 00:10:21.062, Speaker A: But in any case, if you put the two of them together, if you take the red and blue vertices of this thing and just superimpose them, then you can say, well, who needs it? You've got one guy that says it can't get smaller, the other guy says it can't get bigger, so you stick them together. But on the other hand, they're only connected along two vertices, so they can rotate. If they're in three space, they can rotate around that red blue thing from one side to the other side. I don't show it, but you can see that. Okay, so that follows directly from the statement that each of those 210 segrities are universally rigid. So this one on the right is also, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know what the count is for this. It might, let's say you tell me whether it's infinite.
00:10:21.062 - 00:10:31.998, Speaker A: I think it is infinitesimal rigid, but it's not globally rigid. It's not even globally rigid. In the play, the one in the bottom is.
00:10:32.086 - 00:10:33.870, Speaker C: Stay with the top one for a moment.
00:10:34.022 - 00:10:34.782, Speaker A: Yes.
00:10:34.958 - 00:10:41.034, Speaker C: Why does the. Is that a strut and a cable canceling out?
00:10:41.404 - 00:10:42.184, Speaker A: Yes.
00:10:43.404 - 00:10:46.628, Speaker C: I thought we would get a bar when we overlapped them.
00:10:46.716 - 00:11:08.000, Speaker A: If you want to put a bar in, that's fine, but it does it for you. I see. Okay. Yeah. The one on the left keeps it from getting smaller. And the one on the right, the one on the left says, well, it could get. What is it? It could get bigger, but it can't get smaller.
00:11:08.000 - 00:11:50.040, Speaker A: Is that right? I don't know. One of them, if you remove it, you know, it can only go one way and the other one, if you remove that member, you know it can't go the other way. So just don't put it in because each side takes care of the other side. And the same idea works with this thing in the bottom. Now, the thing in the top is not universally rigid, so it's sort of in between. Each of the pieces are, in a sense universally rigid, determined by the other side. Anyway, the one on the bottom here you have a triangle with this thing in the middle.
00:11:50.040 - 00:12:23.392, Speaker A: This is a Cauchy polygon in the middle, in the bottom. Now, again, you can add them and the strut and the cable just logically disappear. And so you have this thing on the lower right, which is, again, it's not convex. It's not anything. You can do other operations on this thing. You can do this kind of operation and you get something that's also super stable. This one is super stable on the right because they overlap on three vertices.
00:12:23.392 - 00:13:09.804, Speaker A: So each of them are planar, necessarily. And so when you put the two together, nothing could rotate around anything like the one on the top. Okay, so this is one game that you can play. You can build it. I don't know that this has really been pursued too much as to create at least universally rigid tensegrities this way. Actually, logically, the stress never comes up in this process. You're not saying get your canceling stresses, although you can think of it that way.
00:13:09.804 - 00:13:42.806, Speaker A: I'll talk about that in a minute. But here, it's just logically you can do it. You're a little bit more restricted because it's a little harder to cancel more than one, and you can do that, too. So let me look at some more examples here. So here are some basic tensegrities. They are not infinitesimally rigid. Now, the cube with its long diagonals like that, it's in three space.
00:13:42.806 - 00:14:33.120, Speaker A: And generally, when you're in three space, you don't like to have the struts intersect, because as we mentioned, I think with Dorothea last time, that if they do intersect, that adds another constraint in the actual physical object that you've got. And you're not using the math, so to speak, to make it universally rigid. Although sometimes, sometimes there are gadgets like that that do that. But this theory says even if they're allowed to intersect, the thing is still universally rigid. The Snelson on the right, that's what I call a Snelson, is one of his first subjects. First things with cable triangles up and down, and there are cables that go from the upper one to the lower one, like this. And this thing is universally rigid.
00:14:33.120 - 00:15:06.172, Speaker A: That's sort of why I think it is rigid. There are other notions of rigidity where you sort of combine the infinitesimal and this stress constraints. Pre stress stability is another thing in engineering. I'm not going to talk about that except for that. Now, here's one thing that, again, a set of basic tensegrities that you can prove are super stable. Excuse me, I haven't mentioned super stable, but I will in a minute. But they're universally rigid.
00:15:06.172 - 00:15:54.624, Speaker A: So you have any polygon, regular polygon on the top, a regular polygon on the bottom, and you go and you connect them from the top to the bottom with the proper twist. Cables go from the top to the bottom, and a strut from each vertex goes to a vertex from the top to the bottom, and you twist it in just the right way so that the stress exists. There's one way to do that, and we showed almost a direct calculation that these things are universally rigid. Okay. Yes, yes. Another question. Yes.
00:15:54.624 - 00:16:01.148, Speaker A: No, I thought I heard somebody wanted a question.
00:16:01.236 - 00:16:07.802, Speaker C: But just one clarification. The two polygons are the same, or they have the same vertices?
00:16:07.938 - 00:16:32.974, Speaker A: Well, they're both. They're congruent, in this case, pentagons. The calculation is done for when they're both congruent pentagons. But you'll notice that if we go back to the beginning. It goes. Boy, it's everywhere. Here.
00:16:32.974 - 00:16:43.764, Speaker A: This one is. They're different, but we'll see later in just a bit why you can get one from the other.
00:16:44.384 - 00:16:47.800, Speaker C: They're not congruent, but they have the same number of vertices.
00:16:47.872 - 00:17:02.562, Speaker A: Yeah. They're the same number of vertices. The same thing. And they have to be twisted just the right way. And this thing is essentially. One way to think of it is it's a projective image. This is a projective image of the one where they're.
00:17:02.562 - 00:17:20.594, Speaker A: Where they're equal. So this follows almost immediately from the previous one. Now can I find my way back? Okay, here we go. Where was I? Okay, these.
00:17:20.754 - 00:17:32.614, Speaker C: These structures that. The smelson structure that you just showed looks almost like a set of dominoes falling but arrested in time, somehow stopped in time.
00:17:33.314 - 00:17:34.414, Speaker A: Dominoes.
00:17:34.754 - 00:17:45.730, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, bars. Okay, the bars are like a domino kind of falling. And it looks like all the. All the bars are falling in a kind of circle. And yet.
00:17:45.802 - 00:17:48.322, Speaker A: Oh, yes, they cycle around. That's right.
00:17:48.378 - 00:17:48.898, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:49.026 - 00:18:23.034, Speaker A: I think Girard mentioned this before. What you can do, you can use this superposition idea to connect several of the. The snels. Intense. And what happens is that the triangle in the middle is, in a sense, replaced by. You take the top Snelson and twist it for the triangle. You twist it halfway and then connect the top triangle of the bottom one and the bottom triangle of the top one with a hexagon in the middle.
00:18:23.034 - 00:18:35.934, Speaker A: And that. And then you keep doing that. You can turn it either way. They don't have to turn the same way. It doesn't matter. So there's. By the way, you'll notice there's a right handed and a left handed version of this nelson.
00:18:35.934 - 00:18:49.332, Speaker A: And so if you put them the same handedness as you connect them, you get this spiraling object that goes up. This was the second picture of the Snelson Tower, and I think those two.
00:18:49.428 - 00:19:00.108, Speaker C: Yeah, we missed this opportunity when we created the Fields Institute staircase, which is. I'm sorry, we have this helical staircase in the.
00:19:00.236 - 00:19:02.676, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. We should have made it.
00:19:02.780 - 00:19:04.892, Speaker C: Had a tensegrity on it.
00:19:05.028 - 00:19:13.904, Speaker A: That's what it went. Yeah. I have a picture which isn't too. Let's see. I think. Oh, yeah, this is the. You can do the same thing with these, too.
00:19:13.904 - 00:19:46.330, Speaker A: You don't have to have three. You can have any number. And there's different ways of connecting the top to the bottom. When you have something other than a triangle, you can connect it so that the struts are very close together, or they're further, very far apart. It doesn't matter. There's several parameters, but you must have a convex polygon. If you have a pentagram or something like that, instead of the polygon on the top, you can make it in equilibrium, but it won't be stable.
00:19:46.330 - 00:20:16.724, Speaker A: In fact, I don't think it even. It's even rigid. Oh, yeah. Here's an example of how to just what we were talking about. This thing on the right. I don't know, maybe it's not as illustrative, but this is what the Snelson tower begins to look like from looking from the top down. You take this nelson, and then you take the other Snelson and rotate one to the other, halfway around.
00:20:16.724 - 00:20:41.902, Speaker A: And then you put the two on top of the other. You put the two triangles, but the triangles are different, the angles, the points don't line up. You could do that, too, but you don't put the vertices together. You twist them. But you have this. It's essentially a completed Cauchy polygon in the middle. So you do the superposition idea.
00:20:41.902 - 00:21:18.384, Speaker A: You take the Snelson, you add this thing to it, and it puts struts in the middle, and you add this thing on the top. When you put them together, the cable triangles cancel with the strut triangles. The one on the right cancels one triangle, and the one on the left cancels the other triangle. And then you get rid of it. Now, this is. You have to be careful. I don't think it logically follows from the universal rigidity of the thing, unless you throw in the symmetry.
00:21:18.384 - 00:22:02.474, Speaker A: You can also do it with the stress calculation I'll mention in a minute. So, in other words, you add these three things together, you superimpose them, and you get the Snelson type of tensegrity, the Snelson Tower. And you can also, when you put the one on the top, you can also change the Snelson. You can distort the Snelson, which I'll show in a minute, how you do that sort of thing, so that the top one is smaller, and then you make it smaller and smaller. Snelson cheated, in a way. He threw in extra cables to make it essentially infinitesimally rigid. But he doesn't change the position of the struts.
00:22:02.474 - 00:23:01.684, Speaker A: So there's all kinds of extra cables floating around in there, but they're so small they're invisible, they're hard to see. It looks like he's doing this thing. But this basic Snellson is how he got started. Okay, so I'll explain this a little bit more. Oh, and I hope I have time at the end to explain how this guy, this guy behind me and this thing on the lower right and the thing on the lower left also can be created. The important thing you need to know is the ratio between the cables and the struts. It's extremely symmetrical in the sense that there's a rotation, or rotation and reflection that takes any vertex to any other vertex.
00:23:01.684 - 00:23:56.940, Speaker A: The vertex configuration at each of these is the same. The struts are also all the same. They're equivalent by symmetries and the cables, there are two symmetry classes, the red and the blue. And sometimes, like this one, the standard one that's often built on the lower left, which is this one. If you're seeing this one, this is what it looks like in, you know, in your hands, and it's arranged so. I didn't make this exactly equal, but it's arranged so that all the cables are the same length, and, in fact, they're SymmetriC. This has an extra symmetry, but in fact, you can make some of the cables shorter and some longer.
00:23:56.940 - 00:24:25.374, Speaker A: I'll show that when we get into the catalog. Okay, so this, I hope, is available to everybody, but I'll do that later. Okay. All right, let's skip over this. Let me. This cauchy thing is related to Cauchy's theorem. And let me.
00:24:25.374 - 00:25:17.544, Speaker A: And this is a result about spiderwebs, that TUt's theorem. And this was done, this picture was, I lifted it from SHlomo, a paper that SHlomo did. Okay, now, I want to be a little more precise about everything. So we have a whole bunch of vectors in some Sort of EuClideAn space. And to be more precise, I say they lie on a conic in infinity. If there's a homogeneous quadratic form in the variables of the EuCliDeAn space, like in the plane, there'll be two variables in the line, you might say how many variables? You don't worry about it. On the line.
00:25:17.544 - 00:25:56.934, Speaker A: The line doesn't count. In dimension three, there'll be three variables, and so on. Now, for those factors, if the vector, when you evaluate the vector, a given vector, at the quadratic form, it's equal to zero. You say that that vector lies on that conic at infinity. So this. If you. Why is that relevant? Because if you have a framework, a bar framework, then it has a non congruent affine motion, if and only if, those bar directions lie on a conic at infinity.
00:25:56.934 - 00:26:17.742, Speaker A: Okay, what does that mean? Good question. Well, I think the first thing to really understand this is to look at the plane. And in the plane, it's very simple. In the plane, it means there are two directions. It could be the x direction, the y directions, or they could be skewed. It doesn't matter. They could look like this or this.
00:26:17.742 - 00:27:13.064, Speaker A: But two fixed directions, if they lies, if the bar graph, let's say, lies in such a way that each edge, which is thought of as a vector, you say which one? It doesn't matter. If those edge directions lie on that conic and infinity, namely in two different, at most two different directions, then it's essentially like a lattice. It could be disjoint lattices and so on. It's like this picture at the bottom. And you can see that, that this, it's not really a lattice, but it looks like a lattice. And the lattice can. If you look at my hands, you can see the lattice sort of shears left and right, and in fact, it flexes so that it starts off where it is, and it flexes flat into a line in two different ways.
00:27:13.064 - 00:27:51.882, Speaker A: And that's, you know, you can call that a ruled surface. There's two rulings in the thing. In dimension three, it's actually very similar. It's like it lies on a hyperboloid or a bunch of hyperboloids that have this kind of ruling on it. And if it does, it's flexible. If it doesn't, there may be a flex of the framework, but the flex of the flamework. The framework will be affine motion, so it'll only be a linear plus a constant that gives the motion at each time.
00:27:51.882 - 00:28:29.754, Speaker A: This is important from the, because it's the sort of missing link when you have this energy function and you're at the minimum of the energy function. Okay, so this is the first comment. When are there affine motions? Also, it's important to realize that as this thing moves, this is an affine motion that takes this, let's say, square framework into the skew framework. When it's in the new skew framework, it still keeps on going. It's on a conic at infinity of a different conic. That's all right. It still keeps on going.
00:28:29.754 - 00:28:57.770, Speaker A: So it's not just for. It's rigid, but it's universal. It's rigid under any kind of motion. Okay, so this is just a quick review of affine motions. This is the way I like to think of the basic, the workhorse of universal rigidity. And this is what I call super stability. We talked about this.
00:28:57.770 - 00:29:57.964, Speaker A: Before you have the stress matrix, you want the stress matrix to have maximal rank, N minus D minus one. Now the maximal rank condition is sufficient in the generic case, must be generic for global rigidity. Now we're talking about universal rigidity, where it's rigid in all higher dimensions. So we're talking about universal rigidity. So the second condition is that that thing has to be positive semi definitely. It can't be positive definite because of course it has D minus D plus one vectors, D plus one, a kernel of dimension D plus one at least. Okay, but if it has a larger dimensional kernel and its rank is less, then that makes it more difficult to be universally rigid.
00:29:57.964 - 00:30:32.494, Speaker A: And I'll talk about that too. The third condition is the affine condition that the edge directions do not lie on a conic at infinity. This is generally what you'd expect to be true if you make something up that's pretty exotic with lots of different directions and stuff. Chances are the interactions will not lie on a conic and infinity. This gets rid of the affine motions you can't have. And the first two conditions say that the only possible motions are affine motions. That's the idea.
00:30:32.494 - 00:31:16.384, Speaker A: So you say that a generic framework doesn't allow the conic at infinity. Yeah. Well, if you have a generic framework with one edge, of course it lies on a conic at infinity. But if you have anything that looks like a reasonable kind of graphic that you want to be rigid, it's not going to lie. The edge directions will not lie iconic at infinity. Okay. All you need is just a few random looking edges and it'll be, to tell you the truth, I didn't pay too much attention to this, because it, generally speaking, when you build a tensegrity, you think it might be rigid.
00:31:16.384 - 00:31:45.990, Speaker A: It doesn't lie on a conical infinity. That's easy to do in the plane. It's easy to look at it, see? Well, are there two directions or not? Yes or no? You see it instantly in dimension three. It's a little harder. Shlomo Lewis and I have a result where it's even more precise. This notion of being on a ruled surface is there, and it's actually very useful for some other things. But it's interesting to look at that.
00:31:45.990 - 00:32:16.044, Speaker A: But a priori if you want to build one, this third condition is just a little thing, a little box you have to check. Okay, thank you. And then, of course, the real theorem is that if it's super stable, it's universally rigid. And you would think most likely the other thing is true. And that's not true. The converse is not true. This is a very simple example at the bottom, and it does it with zero stressed edges.
00:32:16.044 - 00:33:15.174, Speaker A: So. Oh, I should mention that the third conditions is that the edge directions with a non zero stress do not lie on a conic infinity. You might say, why not just let, why not make all the edge directions not lie on a conic at infinity? That's not enough, because here's an example at the bottom. Now, you can see I've lifted up the strut a little, so you can see the overlap. So the two struts on the side, the side, the upper two edges of this triangle, they do have a non zero stress. The one on the left, the angled one on the left, the angle on the right, and the cables, they all stress in there very nicely. So it has only two directions at infinity.
00:33:15.174 - 00:33:56.488, Speaker A: So the. So there. So you have those two directions that are stressed. But two directions do lie on a conic at infinity in the plane. So this violates condition three. Otherwise the stress matrix is positive, semidefinite, and the rank is rank, too. Oddly enough, if you have these two edges, if you have two vertices, two edges, they can only span a plane, a two dimensional plane.
00:33:56.488 - 00:34:31.612, Speaker A: So the first condition is true. And the second condition is true. It's the third one that's wrong. Anyway, this thing at the bottom is universally rigid because the angle between those two stress strut directions are, they can't get smaller because of the strut at the bottom, and it can't get larger because of the cable in between. And so it's universally rigid. The only thing is that it looks like that. But you can say, well, why not do three edge directions? You can do three.
00:34:31.612 - 00:35:09.652, Speaker A: Then you'll have, the stress directions won't lie on a conic an infinity because there'll be three directions. That's true. But then the first condition will be wrong because the rank of the thing will have one dimension too small, because the whole thing, the thing is that the first two conditions only see stresses. If it's not stressed, it's like it's not there. Okay, so this is the workhorse, the super. This is where you use the thing. Now, you can use this combination.
00:35:09.652 - 00:35:53.114, Speaker A: Instead of just saying you have a cable and strut that are overlapping, you can say, aha, we have two stresses, and we can add the two stresses for overlapping pieces. Gives you a little more precise way of doing things. Okay, now the question I think that's interesting here is, how do you account for you have one configuration and you do another configuration. Now you can prove it for one. And you have to go back and check the thing again to the calculations. No, no no. One of the basic thing is even for infinitesimal rigidity are projective maps, projective images.
00:35:53.114 - 00:36:14.860, Speaker A: And this is my little picture of this thing. You can take the framework here in three space. It doesn't have to be parallel. It could be positioned any way you like. You take your favorite point and project this guy on the top down to the guy on the bottom. The dotted lines show you the projected lines. And the theorem.
00:36:14.860 - 00:36:33.924, Speaker A: Well, we have to see that's what it means to be a projective image. Now you could also project them. So things collapse. You don't want to collapse an edge length. But never mind. That is the notion of a projective image. Projective geometry comes in.
00:36:33.924 - 00:37:09.650, Speaker A: Now one of the cool things about this, and this also applies to infinitesimal rigidity is what happens to cables and struts. In a sense. The cable and strut are just defined by their endpoints. And you write it as an interval. But the interval is either increasing, allowed to increase or decrease. But if you think of it projectively and you look at an interval. If you have a cable on an interval, the complement of the cable is a strut.
00:37:09.650 - 00:38:01.844, Speaker A: If the cable increases, it decreases in length. The strut increases in length. So when you do a projection, you really should keep this in mind. So the way I would say it is that this red interval which represents a strut in the horizontal line in the bottom if it's projected through the green point here that you see it goes to another interval on this other line, this slanty line that's drawn here. So I project the points, the endpoints. But the inside of this red interval goes to the outside of the other red dotted interval or dashed interval that represents the image. So when you draw it, you draw one or the other.
00:38:01.844 - 00:38:35.564, Speaker A: You draw the line segment. You don't draw it going through infinity. So if you think of it that way. One way to think of it is you project an interval or you project a strut to a cable. If the point at infinity. If one of the points in the interval that represents the strut or the cable goes to infinity. In other words, if it's turned inside out, and that's essentially it, what does this point.
00:38:35.564 - 00:39:06.500, Speaker A: There's a point. I don't know. I haven't drawn it here. But there's a point here on the red interval that goes boom, to infinity to the outside. It turns it inside out. Effectively, if that's the case, then you change the red strut interval to a cable interval. But if it doesn't go to infinity, like the black one on the right, if you look at this strut on the right, it projects through this point.
00:39:06.500 - 00:39:42.014, Speaker A: But the interior of the interval goes to the interior of the interval in the projection. Well, that's good. So that means this guy goes to a strut. Now, the question is, when you. The interesting thing is, when you have a framework in the plane, what happens is, if you project one thing to another, there's always a line somewhere in the projection that goes to infinity. Now, if it's an affine map, the stuff at infinity goes to infinity. So there's not much to check.
00:39:42.014 - 00:40:26.244, Speaker A: But if it's not affine, if it's a slanty, sort of more general kind of projective map, there could be an exchange of cables and struts. So this is a recent theorem. Oddly enough, this has to do with super stability and not with universal rigidity. And this theorem is not. So if you take a tensegrity and do a non singular projective map, you could project things to a lower dimensional thing. Don't do that. Just take it to the same dimension.
00:40:26.244 - 00:40:51.924, Speaker A: You take a plane to a plane, then you can rigidly move it back if you like. If it's infinitesimally rigid, then it stays infinitesimally rigid. That's an old theorem. It goes back. I learned it from Walter. The new result is that if it's super stable, if one is super stable, then so is the other, as long as you take, you know, so you can send a point to infinity. That's not fair.
00:40:51.924 - 00:41:31.764, Speaker A: So as long as none of the points themselves go to infinity, then one is super stable if the others. But you have to keep track of cables and struts. A cable would go to a strut if it's turned inside out, or vice versa. And so now, actually, seeing that you're drawing this, it seems like a computer understands this theorem very nicely, but people have a problem. So here's the way I like to think of it. What happens is that you take your tensegrity and you decide on some line that has to. What goes to infinity is a line.
00:41:31.764 - 00:41:55.034, Speaker A: It could stay there. The line could go. The line in infinity could stay as a line in infinity. But never mind. You take this line and let's say I'm going to make the line in infinity be this dotted line as you go through here. Now, I don't care exactly. I just want to know roughly what the image under the projectivity looks like.
00:41:55.034 - 00:42:24.030, Speaker A: So in this case, the two three. I've decided to cut the interior the line infinity go through two three. So that two three guy had better change its ruling. This thing on the left is universally rigid. It's super stable. So the two three guy is going to go to a cable. The four three is going to go.
00:42:24.030 - 00:42:44.860, Speaker A: It was a cable. It's going to go to a strut. And the one three is going to go to a cable again. Now, things that stay on the same side here, like the one four two, I'm going to keep that more or less the same. So here's the two four one down here. Here's the two four one. They're going to stay the same.
00:42:44.860 - 00:43:26.004, Speaker A: They're ought to be exactly equal. But roughly, it looks like that. Now, I have to position the three so that, you know, there's only so many ways you can do it so that the thing is even possibly in equilibrium. And I claim you put three on the other side and you connect three to two this way, so that the strut three four is in between three two and three one. I claim that's the only way you can get it so there's any chance that it'll be in equilibrium. Okay, so it looks like the one on the right. And this, this is another standard four vertex, universally rigid, super stable tenseground.
00:43:26.004 - 00:43:41.764, Speaker A: So our theorem says if the thing on the left is super stable, that's certainly true. Then. Then the thing on the right is super stable. Well, we knew that's true anyway. But this is an example of how you could go. Now, this is kind of fun. You can play with this.
00:43:41.764 - 00:44:20.228, Speaker A: So here's something that's a little more complicated. You can take a desargues configuration like this. And there are all kinds of different ways that you can take the line at infinity to slice through. Now, notice that the 2314 and five six lines are coincident. They have to go through a point at infinity, which means they're parallel, which is the case on the left, or they have to go to a point. Now, all of those things went to. It turns out that those three things went to a point.
00:44:20.228 - 00:44:50.446, Speaker A: I want to make it so that that point at infinity is going to appear on the right. It turns out that that point infinity has to actually be on the line segments that you draw. So I claim. Now I'm going to keep the three four five again, this thing on the left the same. Then it's a bit more of a challenge to find out how to put the one six two edit the 162 sort of looks the same way. Two six is a strut. One two is a cable.
00:44:50.446 - 00:45:23.404, Speaker A: One six is a strut. So this whole thing is the same, but the two three will be a strut and the five six will be a strut. And actually, they have to meet in their interior because they all go to a point at infinity. If you think about it, that has to be that way. And then the one four has to meet them. So they all have to go through that same point. So this guy on the right, which doesn't follow from at least that I see from any of our other theorems directly, is also super stable.
00:45:23.404 - 00:45:49.052, Speaker A: Okay. And I drew the, the thing at infinity that goes the other way too. So the little dotted line is what you're sending to infinity. So this one, this dotted line in the middle on the left goes to. This other thing on the right doesn't go to the dotted line. Infinity doesn't go to infinity. That, that's certainly true, but it goes to line.
00:45:49.052 - 00:46:28.324, Speaker A: It's at infinity on the right. Okay. Anyway, so this, this is great fun when you can do this. So all this stuff about a convex polygon, you can make all kinds of other crazy looking shapes to do it. In fact, I did an example here. If you take two, I don't want to spend all the time on this, but if you take a, you can do it in three dimensions too. But in three dimensions, it's a plane.
00:46:28.324 - 00:46:54.404, Speaker A: And you can set the plane to infinity as well. And you get other shapes, like two tetrahedra, one inside the other. You can take a hyperplane, it goes through and, you know, you get some other shapes other than the tetrahedron going through each other. Get some interesting shapes in dimension three. But. Okay, I have a little question about.
00:46:55.264 - 00:47:09.212, Speaker C: If you make an equivalence relation so that these two tensegrities are equivalent because one can be carried to the other using this operation of intersecting with the line.
00:47:09.388 - 00:47:14.944, Speaker A: And. Well, it's actually a projective equivalent projectivity.
00:47:15.444 - 00:47:25.064, Speaker C: Yeah. So is there, are there more than one class? Is there more than one class of tensegrities the same number of.
00:47:26.164 - 00:48:07.176, Speaker A: Well, what do you mean by class? I mean the, you can change, you can change any one strut to a cable by taking a thing through the center, but you can't, you don't have complete freedom of which ones to change. So there are a lot, I don't know how many. That's an interesting combinatorial question. How many ways are there? You have a bunch of points with line segments between them. How many different ways can you cut those things? With planes, sometimes you cut them in a completely different way. And you get almost the same. You get two different tensegrities that are almost the same, but the labeling will be different.
00:48:07.176 - 00:48:28.816, Speaker A: I labeled them here so that you can see. Right. So there's a. That's a. That'd be a fun combinatorial question to see how many things that you could get that are different, especially in dimension three. It's really, it's a fun challenge to see what the thing looks like after you. You know, there's a graph aligned, or, or a plane.
00:48:28.816 - 00:48:49.640, Speaker A: It'll go through things. The other idea is to figure out, well, what's the configuration? Right. And there are many different ways of doing this. If by equivalence class, you mean with the same ten segregate cable strut relations, is that what you mean? Yeah. Yeah. So. But there's only a finite number.
00:48:49.640 - 00:49:14.224, Speaker A: That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's one thing I think would be fun to play with. You can make and you can make these things. Now, here's one thing that, just to make things difficult, here are two configurations, two tensegrities.
00:49:14.224 - 00:49:56.824, Speaker A: The trick is, or one of the problems is that you have zero stressed edges. And Shlomo and I have a result that says if something is universally rigid, we have a way of describing them as a sequence of stressed objects, each one depending on the one before. It's an n step process of going from one configuration to the next to the next. This thing on the right is an example of that. The first step of this thing is this stressed cable strut thing. It's very simple. Collapsed triangle.
00:49:56.824 - 00:50:38.022, Speaker A: But then there's no stress on the middle one. But it turns out that you can put a sort of secondary stress on the upper and the bottom. It's like a teeter totter, so that it's in balance. And when you do that, then the secondary stress comes into play to show that it's rigid. But the problem is this orchard ladder is also universally rigid. But the step ladder is what I'm calling it on the left is when everything is parallel, it turns out that's not rigid. If, you know, the stepladder goes like a lattice, it goes back and forth.
00:50:38.022 - 00:51:19.214, Speaker A: And it's not only not universally rigid, it's not even rigid in the plane. There's a nice affine motion in the plane that moves the stepladder. So this orchard ladder is universally rigid. This stepladder and the orchard ladder are equivalent by projectivities. You take that where the two poles of the orchard ladder meet, you take that point to infinity. You don't take any points of the ladder itself to, but you take that point where they meet to infinity, and that gives you parallel lines. And that thing isn't even rigid.
00:51:19.214 - 00:52:17.444, Speaker A: So in a technical sense, remember I said that the stressed members do not lie on a conic and infinity. The horizontal lines are not stressed. So it satisfies the condition, but it has this affine problem. So by the definition, we've used universal rigidity, which is true on the right, is not preserved by projectivities, but it's this kind of degenerate affine thing that comes into it. So the real thing, the affine things, which I sort of ignored for years, is what the bad boy is in this picture. Okay? So it's, so it gets even more not confusing, and so on. Now here's something.
00:52:17.444 - 00:52:27.824, Speaker A: This is the. Let's see, how much time do I have? I want to spend some time on the. Let's see, I need my.
00:52:28.204 - 00:52:31.848, Speaker B: You have five minutes or so, but we can overrun it a little bit if you like.
00:52:31.996 - 00:52:59.264, Speaker A: I might like to overrun it a little bit. I do want to mention this thing, though. Okay, so there are two things I wanted to mention. This. This is some, it's a very recent result. It's actually only a year old. But the theorem is that if it's universally rigid, or even just globally rigid, or even locally rigid, just rigid by the definition of rigidity.
00:52:59.264 - 00:53:27.336, Speaker A: You don't have to care me. You don't have to tell me why. But if it's rigid, or infinitesimally rigid, which is known in dimension two or more, then it's orthogonal projection onto a lower dimensional space. I should have said little D, less than big D. But otherwise, how do you make an orthogonal projection if then it has the same property? It's universally rigid. Globally rigid. Locally rigid, Earth, I don't know.
00:53:27.336 - 00:54:37.960, Speaker A: Anybody said this before, these are all very thin, and the proof is like two lines. Well, it's this thing and the next. So I'm going to mention global rigidity, and the others sort of follow the same way. And to distinct global rigidity, remember what I was saying is that global rigidity is sort of a bad boy. It hides behind its genericness. If you give me a specific example, how do you tell if it's globally rigid? Well, it could be universally rigid, it could be super stable. Well, that's great, but what happens if it's not? Most likely, if you have a generic configuration, it won't be super stable, although there is a result of Shlomo and Lewis and me that says that, well, yeah, you can find another configuration of the same bar framework that is super stable.
00:54:37.960 - 00:55:11.384, Speaker A: But never mind that. I think global rigidity is. It's a scratch your head thing to determine anything that is globally rigid if it isn't universally rigid. And anyway, so here's a proof for global rigidity. So what you do, in other words, if it's in higher dimensions, it projects down to a lower dimensions. If the higher dimensional one is globally rigid, the projection is globally rigid. And I don't need you to tell me why it's globally rigid upstairs.
00:55:11.384 - 00:56:00.584, Speaker A: So here's the thing. So you take the configuration p and you project the Pisces down into a PI hat. If you look at our paper, this is the reverse of the terminology, but never mind. So the PI hat is equal to an orthogonal vector to PI hat and p. So you just write PI as the projected PI plus the vector perpendicular. So those two guys are perpendicular. So if you look at the distance between PI and pj, this is the guy upstairs, right? Then the middle terms cancel.
00:56:00.584 - 00:57:02.630, Speaker A: So it's the distance between the square root of the distance between the PI minus pj squared down squared downstairs plus this orthogonal projection terminal. Now, if q is another configuration corresponding to p, where the cables go the right way and the struts go the right, whatever, you define the object upstairs. So suppose you have some other one downstairs, the qi hats that are determined, you define the qi upstairs to be at the same level as the Qi hat was. So you take two configurations downstairs, PI hat and PJ. You know, all the PI hats downstairs. So the PI upstairs goes down to PI Hat, the Qi goes to its. The queues go to its Qi hat.
00:57:02.630 - 00:57:37.994, Speaker A: So I'm going to make one that goes upstairs. I'm going to define it by using the same hi as I use for the PIs. So that's how I do the qis, and then everything is monotone. You can look at the calculation here, but it's almost obvious. The square root of something squared plus a constant thing, it goes the same way. If the Q's are getting bigger, if the Q hats are getting bigger, so are the Q's. If they're getting smaller, they're getting smaller.
00:57:37.994 - 00:58:02.278, Speaker A: And so you have another thing upstairs, and if it's not equal to zero, it's not equal to zero. Everything works beautifully. So that means that it's globally rigid upstairs. You're using the global rigidity upstairs. And so the thing downstairs has to be congruent. If the thing up. If there's.
00:58:02.278 - 00:58:26.858, Speaker A: If you. You would if you had some other thing downstairs that violated the strut and cable conditions, it would violate it upstairs by this formula. And that's it. Now, universal. That's global rigidity. Universal rigidity is you just multiply everything by the extra thing. You just think of it as it being in a bigger term.
00:58:26.858 - 00:58:54.614, Speaker A: And so universal rigidity follows almost automatically. So let me show you where this could be done. Here's an example. Now, this is one of my favorite examples. You take the Snelson example on the left. And add this triangle with the dashed lines in the middle. That's a standard one.
00:58:54.614 - 00:59:23.384, Speaker A: And what you do is you can get rid of the triangles on the top and put the triangles on the bottom. And I have an example here. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Here it is. This one, if you can see it. So it's the same as the Snelson, except you have this y thing in the middle of each triangle. And it's still rigid. It's still universally rigid, super stable, even despite the superposition.
00:59:23.384 - 00:59:49.884, Speaker A: Then what you do, put the two together and you get this thing. Now, the thing on the right does double duty. You can think of it as in dimension three. It's super stable. The stress matrix has the right right. But now's the rub. You can project it into the plane.
00:59:49.884 - 01:00:20.646, Speaker A: Now, you might say, what happens is, often when you do a projection, you get other stresses. You have a whole bunch of stresses. You might only have one stress possible, one dimensional stress possible upstairs. And you project it and you say, ah, there might be all kinds of extra stresses. In this case, it doesn't happen because when you have a degree three vertex like this. In other words, three members coming in, three vectors. And there's a linear linear combination of those vectors.
01:00:20.646 - 01:00:51.544, Speaker A: That adds up to zero. There's only one linear combination. Each one can be written in terms of the other. So if you do that as you walk around the whole framework, in the bottom, there's only one stress. So whatever the stress is, after you do this operation, you do this delta y. And the thing, it only has one stress, but then it's in the plane. And so it has the same stress as above.
01:00:51.544 - 01:01:26.104, Speaker A: So it has an extra kernel. The stress doesn't see that it's in the plane. The poor thing got fooled. It's in the plane, but he really wants to be in dimension three. So this guy downstairs is universally rigid by this argument that we just gave. Now we Shlomo and I, Shlomo and I have an iterative thing. In principle, our result should show that this thing is universally rigid without having it be super stable.
01:01:26.104 - 01:01:57.214, Speaker A: But this is really simple. You just take a projection, it's super stable, you're done. It's not super. The projection is universally rigid but not super stable. So it's the same sort of thing as before. Okay, any quick questions and I'll show you how to use the software. Okay.
01:01:57.214 - 01:02:28.744, Speaker A: I think this is really incredible. The result. Well, you don't often see that you need to do a projection like this, but the result is so simple. And the thing is, it works for global rigidity. Without asking any questions. Did I mention the word generic here? No, there's no generic here at all. It's just straight from the definitions.
01:02:32.944 - 01:02:35.484, Speaker C: Can I ask what you used to build the models?
01:02:36.784 - 01:02:55.084, Speaker A: Yeah, so the model I have, if you like, it's this one. So here, can you see I. Well, sort of on purpose, sort of. I made the. These two points are on top of each other, so I moved in the picture. I did that too. You could do that.
01:02:55.084 - 01:03:07.304, Speaker A: You could alter the projection too, if you want. In any case, you get something like this. And this is in the plane. Now the object in three space. I have one of those too. Where'd it go?
01:03:08.964 - 01:03:17.852, Speaker C: Do you have a particular collection of bars and cables and struts that you use? Is there a manufacturer that you favor?
01:03:17.988 - 01:03:49.644, Speaker A: Oh, now this is a different question. How to build these things? These are called jack chains and I suppose, but the jack chains have the cool property. You can open them up and close them down with a pair of pliers and they're really good and strong and you can put a lot of stress in these things. This thing is really heavily stressed. So these things come together and they don't die. If you use rubber bands, they die after a mere ten years or so. Let's see, where did my other.
01:03:49.644 - 01:04:17.854, Speaker A: Did I not bring it? Beg me. It was a three dimensional. I guess I don't have the three dimensional version of this. I had it somewhere. I thought I brought them all in here. I have half of them at home and half of them here, but I just don't see it here. But, you know, you just take these two things and you pull them out this way.
01:04:17.854 - 01:04:33.810, Speaker A: So it's. Oh, yeah, badminton. Of course. This is it right here. This is the three dimensional version. These things are in springs instead of the cables. But it's still, it's pretty clear.
01:04:33.810 - 01:04:56.874, Speaker A: It's nicely rigid. So this is the Snelson with the delta y operation, you replace the triangle with the y. Okay, let me go to the software. Okay. If you have any questions, I'll hang around for a while. I have another meeting at 1230, so I have to go. So let me see.
01:04:56.874 - 01:05:21.954, Speaker A: I have to get out of this. I have to stop sharing, and then I have to share to the other software. Hang on. Where did it go? Yeah, here it is. Share. Do you see it?
01:05:23.054 - 01:05:23.814, Speaker B: Yes.
01:05:23.974 - 01:05:48.834, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is one of the very popular things. So here you choose the. These have to do with the symmetry. They're classified by the symmetry groups. And I think of the symmetry groups as permutation groups. They're finite groups, can always be thought of as a permutation group.
01:05:48.834 - 01:06:10.558, Speaker A: This is the group a four, the alternating group on four elements. It's the smallest ones, essentially. Maria Terrell and I did the thing for the Dahedral group, effectively. I don't know, maybe there's some things that are not in that. But in any case, you can see this thing on the left here. You've chosen. We've chosen the group.
01:06:10.558 - 01:06:29.438, Speaker A: These are all the groups you can choose. Thought of as permutation groups. The alternating group on four elements. The alternating group cross z two and the symmetric group on four elements. The symmetric on elements cross c two. A five. A five plus c two.
01:06:29.438 - 01:06:50.544, Speaker A: The alternating group on the elements. I'll do a five. This is a very fun thing, too. Then you have to choose the particular cables that you want. There are two kinds of cables. They're red and blue, as you can see, on the left. And in this case, there are only two classes that come up.
01:06:50.544 - 01:07:09.540, Speaker A: The struts are the same thing. Now, one hint. If you don't want the struts to come together, if you want them to be disjoint, at least at the endpoints, you choose something of order two. This is one, and four is switched. Two and three is switched. So these are of order two. So it looks like.
01:07:09.540 - 01:07:24.356, Speaker A: So this happens to be the one that's very common like this. If you like, you can blow it up. Can you see this now? The big size? Yeah. And so you. There are also other options. You can. You can change the picture, you can change the background.
01:07:24.356 - 01:07:46.580, Speaker A: You can make the. The thing pretty and look different and so on. So a lot of variables you can change. Now, some of these are really very degenerate. The z two things. I'm not sure we've classified them the right way. This has to do with representation theory.
01:07:46.580 - 01:08:18.720, Speaker A: So I think the most interesting one is probably a five starting group of five elements. And so you can tell. So there are two kinds of cables. So if you choose the first one here, this is a cable of order three. That means it'll give you a triangle. The two three and the four five will give you cables that are not triangles, just single cables, but of a different color. The same thing for the struts.
01:08:18.720 - 01:08:54.153, Speaker A: Let's choose a strut that's more cooperative. There. You can see it on the left. And there's still a choice of how you want the cable and the relative cable stresses to be relative to each other. You can see how it moves the thing on the left back and forth. So if you move it one way, it says that to the right, the blue stress is dominating the red stress. And so the blue cables want to get closer together.
01:08:54.153 - 01:09:38.082, Speaker A: They want to get smaller because they have a higher stress. And then once you choose the ratio between the blue and the red stresses, then the whole thing is determined. You can also move it in and out, too, which is a little annoying because you don't want to, but then you can also move it along this. Each of these lines represent a, quote, representation. And in a given dimension for a five, there are three different kinds. There's a trivial representation, which you don't bother putting up. There's two three dimensional representations.
01:09:38.082 - 01:10:17.090, Speaker A: They're almost the same. And then there's a four dimensional and a five dimensional representation. What you do is you choose the stresses and you hope which the first representation is one of the two dimensional representation, in which case it'll show you. Showing the representation means it'll give you the picture, which is the representation of that sort. So I learned what little representation theory I could and just. Just made up this thing. This is in a forthcoming book, tensegrities, symmetry, and so on.
01:10:17.090 - 01:10:42.902, Speaker A: I mentioned earlier, and this is explained in the last few chapters of the book, where there's a lot of symmetry. This is not the kind of symmetry. I don't think it overlaps too much with, uh, what, uh, what's his name, Tony, in your, uh. Uh, does symmetry, uh, blank. Pardon me?
01:10:42.998 - 01:10:44.314, Speaker C: Daniel Bernstein.
01:10:45.454 - 01:10:51.394, Speaker A: Uh, no. Oh, so maybe he does, uh, that, too. But, uh.
01:10:52.174 - 01:10:53.382, Speaker B: You mean Bernd.
01:10:53.558 - 01:10:59.042, Speaker A: Yeah, Bernd. Bern Schultz. Yeah, yeah. Bern Schultz. He does the same. It's not. So.
01:10:59.042 - 01:11:27.998, Speaker A: That's sort of. Well, the symmetry groups are similar sometimes, but this is a different kind of symmetry. And the. Using the representation theory, I think, is a little bit different. But this is emphasis on the group. Each vertex of one of these tensegrities represents a group element. So the group here, if you count this thing, has 60 vertices.
01:11:27.998 - 01:12:06.408, Speaker A: So the group is the alternating group on five symbols, which has order 60. And so it's more like an exhibit of the group, but it also is a super stable tensegrity. All of these are super stable because in the picture, if you go back, what it is, is you start off with the stress. Let's say they're all positive. I forget. Oh, no, that's right. Yeah, that's right.
01:12:06.408 - 01:12:53.926, Speaker A: They're all positive. But the strut stress has to go negative. And this line is the strut stress. And as you start with the strut stress at zero, it gets stronger and stronger until finally the thing goes. You hit one of the tensegrities and the stress matrix has to be singular. Now, if it happens that the first tensegrity, the first representation that you hit is a three dimensional representation, well, you get a picture. If it's only the three dimensional representation that you hit, then it's super stable because there are no other eigenvalues.
01:12:53.926 - 01:13:15.724, Speaker A: But all kinds of funny things can happen when you do something like this. A five and z two, because a lot of the times. Yeah, you see, this isn't right. It really. I wouldn't. It has. It's supposed to have 120 elements and this has 60.
01:13:15.724 - 01:13:35.724, Speaker A: Sometimes the. The configuration you're looking at is doubly covered. Each vertex represents two vertices and they're connected in some crazy way. And. But sometimes you get something different. But anyway, the cross z. Two things are very complicated.
01:13:35.724 - 01:13:59.424, Speaker A: Yes. Thank you for letting me go over. If you go back to my. Let's see. Stop sharing. If you go back to my other thing, I have a. Where did it go? Here.
01:13:59.424 - 01:14:45.524, Speaker A: If I have a. Where did it go? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Screen share. I hope this works. I don't know what happened to it. Well, whatever. If you go back to my slides, I have a link to this webpage where you can do the.
01:14:45.524 - 01:15:02.676, Speaker A: You can make your own. And that's what this is. If I took some time, I could do this. It's interesting. I was just thinking with this thing. Can you see this? Can you see my. Yeah, you can see the thing over here.
01:15:02.676 - 01:15:14.068, Speaker A: If you do the thing, you can see. This is a pentagram. You can do this superposition idea, if I'm not mistaken. I don't know. I was just thinking about it. You can put a star in here. If you have.
01:15:14.068 - 01:15:44.056, Speaker A: The computer says that this guy is super stable, then you. And it's all symmetric. So then you can put in star shape in here by putting in the little triangles and pentagons and triangles in here. And you can do that. And you can also do the thing on the outside. You can from this. Apparently, you can do a superposition to get a pentagon and a star shape from this.
01:15:44.056 - 01:16:09.484, Speaker A: But you always can go back. I don't know that you can go backwards, but in any case. So I chose this one. I thought it was cool to have a pentagram with a brassy shape on the whole thing. And this is, in the end, the virtue of the software is it tells you the lengths, and then you're on your. And it gives you a picture so you know who goes over whom. Some of these.
01:16:09.484 - 01:16:39.590, Speaker A: Some of these arrangements are very struts. There's a little hole. The struts go through holes determined by other struts. So it's very tricky to see how to actually assemble these things. This was done about 20 years ago with some high school students at the time, and it held up the whole time. And I've repaired it and reinforced it. The struts here are done with a double layer of cable.
01:16:39.590 - 01:17:11.596, Speaker A: Struts, not cable. I mean tubes. You can get a brass tube and get another brass tube just one step larger. You put one inside the other, and that gives the appropriate stiffness for the cable. If you don't, they bend. The weak link in this construction is the bending of the. For this size, it's the bending of the switch, but you can just put one inside the other.
01:17:11.596 - 01:17:37.724, Speaker A: It makes it stiffer. It's very nice. Gerald de Jong, who was here last time, I don't know if he's still here now. He did it with a kind of aluminum alloy of some sort, which was also very strong. The aluminum made it lighter, but he also did the nodes, the furnaces a little bit differently, too. But this is a very simple way of doing those with screw eyes.
