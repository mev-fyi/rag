00:00:00.120 - 00:00:19.394, Speaker A: So it's a great. Okay. It's a great pleasure to introduce our third speaker this morning, Boris Zigan. His title is rigidity of periodic cyclic complexes and Goetzler's Gauss Manning connection for over periodic numbers. Boris, please.
00:00:20.134 - 00:01:48.078, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you so much for organizing this and hope to meet you in person sometime soon. So, maybe I would rather call it operations on negative periodic cyclic complexes with applications and questions. So, let a be an associative. Algebra could be differential graded. And hopefully in the future, it will be something way more general, like ring, ring spectrum, or algebra in maybe stable infinity category. But I mean, these are question marks.
00:01:48.078 - 00:03:09.500, Speaker B: I think there is some outline of trying to repeat what I will be doing in this generality, but I am not sure. It's rather one of those questions that I'm talking about. And then, of course, we have periodic, I'm sorry, negative and periodic cyclic complex. And maybe just for the future, or rather, you know, let me have this sort of another object that we consider. There is also this algebra of Hogshield co chains that form a differential graded d object. And again, actually it forms much more. There is a much, much richer structure on it.
00:03:09.500 - 00:03:52.554, Speaker B: But let's say a differential graded lgebra. And then I can. I have a differential graded hope for algebra. And let me. Let me call it, hmm, h four a. And maybe, let me fix the notation here. And I think, well, people probably know what I mean, mainly.
00:03:52.554 - 00:04:16.530, Speaker B: But. But for algebra we have differentia. We have Hochschild and cyclic complexes. For coil algebra, we have dual complexes. And what does that mean? Maybe, and what, for example, this roman numeral two means. Let me briefly outline. So maybe for algebra.
00:04:16.530 - 00:05:17.994, Speaker B: And again, just to be sure, it may be differential graded. There is this, the Hogeshield complex, which, because a may have its own grading, it may go all the way from negative to positive, infinite. And in Ezra Gessler's notation. So here I would say it's b plus d or b plus da. And again, I'm mainly just fixing notation and explaining what I'm talking about. And here I have. So I have this.
00:05:17.994 - 00:06:21.960, Speaker B: In general, if a is graded, it will occupy half of the plane. And my diagonals are, I think they go here. And usually I am taking direction, but also possible to take direct products. And in this case, oh, no, I am sorry. Yes, it's definitely direct sum here. No questions about it. And it will be cyclic homology or cyclic complex of algebras.
00:06:21.960 - 00:07:27.974, Speaker B: But I would rather say that here I have two possibilities. Usually I take. So this is standard. And also, the other possibility is with products and not sounds. And that is called complex of the second kind, due to polishcuk and Pisyselski, I think. And it has its advantages and disadvantages. But there is this possibility.
00:07:27.974 - 00:08:55.464, Speaker B: Okay, so this is always plus here those red diagonals. And just vertically, I may have two possibilities. So dually, for a coil algebra, it I reverse all the. So instead of multiplication, of course, I use co multiplication in definitions. And here dually to the sum, I use the product. And again here, vertically, I have two choices. I think duality to sums, the standard thing would be doing products.
00:08:55.464 - 00:10:34.958, Speaker B: And dually to products, the non standard thing would be doing something. And this is what I am doing. So, if you look at what I wrote, it is this once. So again, it's, we use sums and not products. Just to be on the safe side, it's kind of on the one hand, technical, on the, on the other hand, sort of fundamentally. Okay, so once again, so I have this invariant cyclic homology of the second type of this DG hop algebra as a co algebra. Correct.
00:10:34.958 - 00:11:45.524, Speaker B: Using the co algebra structure. So I would say probably theorem number one is, I think it's almost standard, but so u is this standard parameter, or if you want the, well, the cyclic homology of the coalgebra of scalars, if you wish. And there's an a infinity algebra over it. And of course, you know the product. The product is induced by multiplication in age. And it's foreign algebra age. And again, it's.
00:11:45.524 - 00:12:35.600, Speaker B: I think there is some new piece of. Yes. Piece of information that was not present. By the way, the, or source that I very much invite you to use is a draft of our book with Richard on my webpage. And again, I apologize. I think a lot of what is there did not get any second reading so far. So there may be some issues.
00:12:35.600 - 00:13:18.086, Speaker B: And also, also, by the way, at request of some of you, I, at least I almost have some excerpts that I think I will also post it there. It's like, well, 2025 pages out of it, which is pertinent precisely to what I'm talking about. I think I will post it at some point, but you are welcome to ask me if you wish. Okay. Yes. And so this is theorem number one. And theorem number two is.
00:13:18.086 - 00:15:09.964, Speaker B: So once again, it. And yeah, so the second theorem is that this a infinity algebra, naturally, a infinity acts on the negative cyclic complex away, well, with various properties that maybe I will not state now and again. So what is good is that there were some previous, or, well, many previous statements about those operations. But good thing is I would say there is some hint or some maybe blueprint for a bigger generality. But I don't know now. Okay, so this was statement number two. And then again for NIH, statement number three.
00:15:09.964 - 00:15:55.182, Speaker B: Sorry about this. For nih, maybe, let me stress it, for nih co commutative. We know what it is. We can compute it. So again, maybe I would say that for. So for any bio algebra age or Hopf algebra age, we have constructed some, I hope interesting. A infinity algebra.
00:15:55.182 - 00:17:36.554, Speaker B: And in general, I don't know of any alternative definition, but if H is co commutative, I know. And here it is. Maybe let me write it, let me write it like this and then explain. Okay, so what is, so what is a co commutative biology? Or rather what is, what is this? Actually it will be a differential grade algebra. So first of all, two not coal algebras. I am sorry, two sub algebras. One is age itself and the other is cobra H.
00:17:36.554 - 00:18:22.836, Speaker B: And I'm saying subalgebra. This will actually be a differential graded subalgebra. And this, not quite, should I say this will be a differential grade. It's about Modulo U. So what is it? Let me recall that it's just. Yeah. Bar means the kernel of the augmentation.
00:18:22.836 - 00:18:53.352, Speaker B: So it's a little bit more than by algebra. Yeah. It also has unit, co unit, kind of the augmentation idea. And I think the correct thing to say, it's shifted by negative one. Yes. So if it's a usual age, then this will sit in degree one. Okay.
00:18:53.352 - 00:20:06.580, Speaker B: And it's a free, free, I am sorry, free algebra generated by age of one. Now, commutational relation, I mean there is age and there is. And the, should I say that is the standard thing like this. Maybe. Let me say that. So my generators, let me denote x here and here. Those generators will be correct.
00:20:06.580 - 00:21:25.632, Speaker B: So generators of two sorts. And those are three generators. And then should I just say that maybe the relation is so something like just the standard relation, the standard cross product of H and Q on which it acts. Okay, so this is the algebra. Now what is the differential? And maybe. So first of all, maybe, let me recall that this is the standard cobar differential that I am writing. This is how Cobar becomes a differential graded algebra.
00:21:25.632 - 00:23:25.904, Speaker B: And here is this one improvement that also it multiplies it by u and drops the parenthesis. So I would say that this is the standard D co bar. And this is what I would call u times B. So that's it. And the third theorem was that not only knows at all, but there is some kind of abstraction, abstraction theory, calculation. It tells that this invariantly defined algebra. And therefore we conclude that again, without any denominators over z, this particular differential graded algebra, a infinity acts on the negative cyclic complex away.
00:23:25.904 - 00:26:02.356, Speaker B: And if we invert hook, it will act on the periodic cyclic contracts away. Okay, what are the applications and questions? So, first of all, maybe let's say that a is a free z module and a zero. You have a product which is associative modulity, and morphisms of sash are models of z models which are morphisms of algebra's module. Then from this category, so we'll give it some name. I don't know. A one can construct using that, those theorems, or the last theorem, one can construct an A infinity functor. So the best sort of functionality we can hope for is a infinity, not just infinity.
00:26:02.356 - 00:27:51.740, Speaker B: Where, what do I mean by periodic cyclic complex? I mean, it's not an algebra yet, but periodic cyclic chains is just a standard construction. And so I can, if I don't have a differential and actually capital b, I have, I don't have small b, but chains I can construct. So, part of the claim is that M is a product associative module p. So the claim is that I can construct a differential which module p becomes the standard cyclic differential. So I can deform the cyclic differential, which I know modulo p. I mean, Hofschild plus Siglit. And it will have the functorial property.
00:27:51.740 - 00:29:47.286, Speaker B: It will rise to an a infinity functor. Okay, so this is one thing, and when I'm talking about questions. So, first of all, there is this construction, as probably a similar or related construction by Petrov Volgotsky. Secondly, Kaleidins, he has this construction. It's also, you know, it arises from a cyclic object, from a cyclic set that he constructs from an algebra over ZP, over FP. And there is this non commutative kind of crystal and cohomology also, maybe I would say Cortingas Kunz, Mayor Tamma, probably also related. And then, of course, become varshessholt that Alan mentioned above and other works over s.
00:29:47.286 - 00:31:39.664, Speaker B: So this is one thing I don't know in any, any rigorous comparison results. I don't know. So this is question number one, question number two, and this is what I would like very much to address. So, so I would stress that some more familiar version, which involves some denominators. So it's a little bit uncomfortable to use for the purposes of number one, it's this algebra. Let me explain. I mean, so say, example, the classical or commutative differential graded algebra is the algebra of multi vector fields with this coating bracket, and in particular, inside just the usual vector fields.
00:31:39.664 - 00:34:34.384, Speaker B: So then this thing acts classically on differential forms with the ram multiplied by u, and the action is without epsilon, of course, it acts like vector fields and poly vector fields act, and with epsilon they act by contraction. And then the cartan identities just transform itself into the action of this algebra, as I think was stressed by Gelfand very, very emphatically in the seventies. Okay, okay, so, so one would expect that this thing, when g is ga, and yes, it does. But in general, to obtain this formula, to obtain this action, is always a little bit of a contortion. And in the non commutative world, it's not the most natural thing, and they think it's very important. And instead of this, again, maybe to make them it. So let me compare the two.
00:34:34.384 - 00:36:11.624, Speaker B: And so I would roughly speak that this is what gives on the left, this is what gives classical cartan identities and calculus. And on the right is what is what you get naturally in the non commutative setting. What is u b, zero. So again, maybe, let me, if we just remember, ub takes x and sends it to x, where x is in u of g, or u of g bar, and here u b, zero. And with the letter u, it's this thing. So it's kind of, I don't know, again, it's sort of a classical limit. And then it's a natural resolution of this kind of thing that you would expect to act on the, on the calculator.
00:36:11.624 - 00:37:24.722, Speaker B: Okay, so now, yes, there is a, or should I say not infinity, but a infinity. Infinity. Morphism. And I really would like to describe it, because my thesis would be that. So, first of all, maybe I jlo and should I say also Gessler senesco cycles, they naturally come from here, from the left hand side. If, you know, if I have a second, maybe I will tell it. And I would like maybe to express some intuition that the con Muskovici, you know, residue type cocycles naturally live on the right hand side.
00:37:24.722 - 00:39:01.164, Speaker B: And this is sort of horizontally, there is the comparison. So why is this? Let me describe this. U. So, and here it is. So let me write this formula. And u is this, you know, cyclic formal parameter. Here it is, which is, I think if you write it like this is this one.
00:39:01.164 - 00:40:31.794, Speaker B: So it's some sort of, you know, discretization of e. Yeah, it's one of those five. What I think we were told them five remarkable limits. This one is for e. So it's really the, when r is equal to zero, you get the exponential of y over u. And so how does phi act? And again, formally, I am sorry, maybe if I have, then I am kind of, I read this function f of yr in this. So once again, this is mh and this is in.
00:40:31.794 - 00:41:35.924, Speaker B: Okay, so why am I stressing this? Because it's. Let me compare it with the following. If you have a variety, and if you have a function, then there are two modules over g. Differential operators with an extra parameter s. One is the following. Maybe. Let me write it on the right, it's functions.
00:41:35.924 - 00:42:57.464, Speaker B: And you know, let f be invertible for simplicity, if not notation, just. It's just a symbol. I don't think so. Something freely generated by o of x. Here I have another symbol, and I think it's self explanatory. Self explanatory. If maybe I just write in a shorthand, if g, whatever, any derivation sends any of those delta functions to zero.
00:42:57.464 - 00:44:38.934, Speaker B: Okay, what is s x minus h by dh here? And we know how it acts on the right hand side. And then there is very important morphism of modules due to malgrams, I think, which, well, let me not write it, but it, roughly speaking, it involves r is equal to one, roughly speaking. And also h replaces u. So there are a couple of things to say that first of all, in many calculations, for example, with cyclic homology of deformations of algebras, this, you know, duality between the cyclic parameter u, also known as the generators, the generator of bs, one h of b's equivalent homology of the circle, and the Planck formal. Planck constant h. It's really for me, very intriguing thing. And here it appears as well.
00:44:38.934 - 00:45:50.104, Speaker B: And also. So once again, very roughly speaking, let me just say that kind of, roughly speaking, this exponential is very much related to constructing jlocycles. And maybe not a bad thing to understand how that f two s relates to Kon moskovic. Okay. And maybe in the last few minutes, let me, I mean, as we know, as Alen mentioned, and we will hear more, cyclic homology is not the last word in it. Well, cyclotomic, probably not. Also not the last word.
00:45:50.104 - 00:47:41.244, Speaker B: But very importantly, it's cytotomic homology. And maybe just say that, that we have. If you want many phases for hoaxing chains, we could tensor our, elevate our algebra into tensor powers and consider twisted Hofschild homology, and they all happen to be the same and cyclic as well, for a little bit more involved reason. But it's also true. And interplay between them kind of gives you a cyclotron extraction. Yeah. On the other hand, Kantevich had advocated for quite a long time that also cohomology, and they are emphatically not the same as the usual Hoxheck cohomology.
00:47:41.244 - 00:49:41.920, Speaker B: There is this Kansevi vasopoulos bracket, also known as necklace, I'm sorry, not bracelet, but necklace bracket, which generalizes Gersten Haber and which is very, very important. For example, I think the word is not weak, I am sorry. The word is pre calabial structures. So it's a very interesting thing. And the force or air force structure on all of those probably will be very important. It will also, you know, connect the two this Calabriao theory and that, you know, cyclotomic and crystalline theory, but I am not aware of any of that. And, and again, it should be done in the generality, you know, over the spherical spectrum, or more generally, and algebras and infinity categories.
00:49:41.920 - 00:49:44.404, Speaker B: Okay, thank you very much. Let me stop.
00:49:45.584 - 00:49:46.544, Speaker A: Thanks, Boris.
