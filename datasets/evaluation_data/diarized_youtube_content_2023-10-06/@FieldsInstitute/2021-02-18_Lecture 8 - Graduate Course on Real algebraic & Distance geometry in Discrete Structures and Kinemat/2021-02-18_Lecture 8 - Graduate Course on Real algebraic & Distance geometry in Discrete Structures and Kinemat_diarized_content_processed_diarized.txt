00:00:00.120 - 00:01:38.360, Speaker A: I was planning to go in detail through the proofs of what we talked about last time, which is coming up with this canonical doctor plan. Given a graph, how you come up with the canonical doctor plan, sorry, given a graph that's independent in the corresponding dimensional rigidity metroid, why the canonical doctor plant is automatically optimal. And then if in fact you have a sparsity metroid or an oracle that determines maximum rigid subgraphs, then we actually have a polynomial time algorithm for finding this optimal doctor plan. I wanted to go through those proofs, but I think that's probably not going to be doable in 50 minutes in any case. So I'm just going to put that off until we come back. And in the meantime, I also last time motivated how once we have the doctor plan, how we go ahead and use the doctor plan for solving to forgetting a block triangular polynomial system, and for solving it. So what I wanted to do is spend a little more time on that motivation, just to convince you that this picture that I had in the beginning is actually a viable picture.
00:01:38.360 - 00:02:46.618, Speaker A: So in other words, what we had before, what we are trying to do is extend a kind of a simple situation that we had for the case of three decomposable graphs. The graph is three decomposable. We get the three decomposition very quickly. And once we have, because you can do that using this paper by Fudos and Hoffman. Hoffman, or in general, I mean, they just sort of formalized it, but it was kind of hidden in the sort of very basic algorithm, algorithms, literature and computer science for a long time, which is basically, if you have something like this, it's basically biconnected but not tri connected, you can very simply find these three points that separate these three into three components using any kind of depth first search or standard methods. And as a result of which you have the three parts, and then once you have it, and there are many ways of doing it, splitting into three parts. But the nice thing that fudos and Hoffman prove is that it really doesn't matter which one of them you choose.
00:02:46.618 - 00:03:30.920, Speaker A: You can choose any one of them you want, and all of them lead to the same, it's called the church Rasa property. So you start out, find these three vertices and split up into three components. Keep doing this recursively. And so this finding this tree decomposition is very quick. It's basically quadratic in this number of vertices. And then once you have the tree decomposition, you can get basically a triangular system of equations, polynomial equations, with one, essentially one quadratic that you're solving at any time. So our goal is not exactly to get always one quadratic solving at any time.
00:03:30.920 - 00:04:37.980, Speaker A: It could be some constant number of quadratics. The source of the complexity in general is the number of polynomial quadratic equations that you solve at any given simultaneously at any given time. So in other words, the size of the block, if, and it's exponential in that, if that size of the block is constant independent of the number of vertices of your original graph or the size of your original polynomial system. The size of the original polynomial system, the number of equations was the number of edges in the graph. Number of variables was, you know, some d times the number of vertices in the graph. So essentially, if your doctor plan has, or, sorry, decomposition has, gives you a system where at any given time the number of quadratics you're solving at simultaneously, which, in other words, the size of the block is polynomial, sorry, is constant independent of the size of the input, then you're home free. So complexity wise, that's what you're aiming for.
00:04:37.980 - 00:05:22.088, Speaker A: Of course, later on you can optimize, you can get that block to look good, you know, ensure that the block also has low degree polynomials and whatnot. So in the three decomposition case, you actually do get quadratic polynomials all the time. And the blocks are, you know, one or two, depending on how you think about it, whether you allow linears or not. Okay. And what we want to do is just get a generalization of that to arbitrary graphs. The three decomposable graphs, as I said, is a very fixed, very small class of graphs. First of all, they are minimally rigid.
00:05:22.088 - 00:06:06.622, Speaker A: And second of all, they are not three connected. And so essentially it reduces the class of graphs to a very small set, even among three decomposable graphs. If you remove some edges, make them not minimally rigid, then, you know, I had some examples here. So those, those types of graphs, you know, these are essentially three decomposed, I mean, three decomposable module of the fact that this cannot be decomposed at all except into edges. Right? So this is a k 33 here. But other than that, the way they are connected up, this is a three decomposable graph minus some edges. So it's essentially an under constrained graph obtained from.
00:06:06.622 - 00:07:09.114, Speaker A: So the usual method is not going to work to find the doctor plan. So you've got so already in that case, to find a doctor. So the goal of the doctor plan is to generalize this idea of getting a decomposition towards the goal of finding these nice triangular systems if you generalize the graph. So essentially you want to be able to generalize the graph in multiple ways. You don't necessarily want to only have minimally rigid graphs. So if it is not minimally rigid, then you should get a decomposition into minimally rigid, which then further recursively decompose. And the goal is, after you get that, to get an automatic way of now getting a block triangular system here with low degree and low small size, all constant in proportional to the size of the original graph.
00:07:09.114 - 00:08:35.952, Speaker A: And that's the goal. So if you. I would not, you know, the goal is not to sort of be very particular at the, in the first stage, when you're getting the canonical doctor plan, the goal is to minimize that, what we call the maximum fan, in which, as we said, was the number of subsystems or subgraphs that need to be somehow combined to get the parent graph or the parent system. And that number is a rough gauge of how big this block and how complex the block that you're going to be solving at that stage is going to be. It's not an exact measure. You still have optimization that you can do, after you have the doctor plan, to be able to get the sort of the optimized block, you can do all kinds of elimination tricks, substitution of different new variables and all kinds of things. What I was trying to do in the last lecture was, in the very end of the last lecture was to give you a picture of what that latter optimization would look like, which means you have the doctor plan, and now you're converting the doctor plan into a block triangular system.
00:08:35.952 - 00:10:06.030, Speaker A: And then in that process, there's some optimization you can do. And I was going into that part. So what I was hoping to do today was to just walk through this process a little bit slower. So people, so it's well motivated, this idea of why we want to minimize the maximum fan in, and thereby this long proof that I'm going to go through to get the optimal doctor plan is something that you will see the point of doing. So I was going to take a small, Alex was the one who suggested to me to do a small example, to even start with the three decomposable graphs, and then go from there to see how you get the triangular system. And then that sort of allows you to, then allows us to go to the other example that we had with a three dimensional case and talk about this idea of recombination and how that gives us the system here. So the process of starting with the doctor plan, and at any given stage, sort of getting the solutions of the subsystem corresponding to a parent from the subsystems solutions of the subsystems corresponding to the child children is called the recombination.
00:10:06.030 - 00:10:54.090, Speaker A: So I just wanted to quickly give you some references. I'll put the links here when I make the slides in the. Put the slides in the piazza. Slide links in the piazza. There are some old, this idea of decomposition and recombination as a graph theoretic way of solving it. So just before I go to this, I just forgot to say something. So this portion here, going from here to here is going from here to here is purely based on graphs and metroids, that there's one algorithm doing this, and that's just, you know, the proofs underlying proof saying, okay, this kind of doctor plan exists, and this kind of doctor plan is optimal.
00:10:54.090 - 00:11:57.386, Speaker A: And all of that is just based on graphs and metroids. The algorithm that will then either using a sparsity metroid to determine rigidity, or using an oracle that use ancestry rigidity to actually construct the doctor plan. The algorithm, the proof of correctness and complexity of the algorithm are all just based on graphs. So this portion here, if you think about this, is all only just based on graphs and metroids, it's purely combinatorial. Then you've got this part here where you're now converting the doctor plan into a system that you solve, obviously, that has algebraic, you can solve it either algebraically or semi numerically. It's quite a bit of just algebraic sort of elimination, elimination kind of elimination theory type of stuff. But I wanted to point out here that this optimization, once you have the optimal doctor plan.
00:11:57.386 - 00:13:38.324, Speaker A: So in other words, you've got optimize the fan in to convert a single recombination step, sorry, a node like this, to that single recombination step, which means finding the solutions of the parent from the solutions of the child subsystems. That involves solving a system, and that's the, I'm representing this as this block that obtaining an optimal form of that system in terms of algebraic complexity, that process itself has some combinatorial content. So this optimization of the recombination system that you solve, or put it another way, optimization of the algebraic complexity, by which I mean the number of equations and the degrees of those equations. So that optimization has in it a combinatorial piece. So although one might say, okay, this piece is all combinatorial and this piece is all algebraic, it's not quite the case. Going from the doctor plan to a sort of an optimal recombination system, optimal in terms of algebraic complexity, which we define, also has a combinatorial content to it. So in the, once we come back two weeks later, I will spend the first period just spending explaining or proving that the canonical doctor plan is optimal first and secondly, given algorithm which we sketched previously.
00:13:38.324 - 00:14:21.746, Speaker A: But I'm going to spend more time on it. No, we sketched the algorithm. I'm not going to go further into the algorithm. But then we'll prove that that algorithm will actually give us the canonical or what we call the pseudo sequential, which is equivalent to canonical doctor plan and that it takes and its complexity is no more than v cubed or something. So that's the first thing we would do. And then the second part is we were going to spend some time talking about the combinatorics that are involved in optimizing the algebraic complexity of the block for a single recombination step. Okay, so that's what, that's the agenda.
00:14:21.746 - 00:15:25.344, Speaker A: Now to motivate this sort of, you know, hard work that we're going to be doing, I'm going to just go through the small examples first. I'll do the small example of three decomposable graphs to go from the, our plan to the recombination to get the triangular system. And then we'll go redo the little example that we did in a hurry at the end of last lecture with the general canonical doctor plan, a single recombination step of a general doctor plan and how we go from there to its block triangular system and what the optimization there entails. Okay, so, so let's start with the simple example. Okay. Whiteboard share. Okay, stop me at any time.
00:15:25.344 - 00:16:08.032, Speaker A: I'm just going to go through this at a relaxed pace here. Okay. Okay, so, oh, I guess I turned it off. Okay, so let's take this simple three decomposable graph. Before we do that, let's just, before we do this, even, even before that even basic. So just suppose that all I'm given is a triangle. That's the very basic three decomposable graph where each one of these guys is just an edge.
00:16:08.032 - 00:16:39.330, Speaker A: Each, it's just one edge, one edge and one edge. So, and say, and how do you write this down as a single quadratic in, you know, solving, solving, finding the positions of this, how do you write it down as a single quadratic? So let's just go through that exercise. So um, so what is all given to us? This, there's the graph given to us and then there are these distances given to us. So this, let's call this 0.10.20 .3 and let's say this distance is given. This distance is given.
00:16:39.330 - 00:17:22.008, Speaker A: And this distance is given. Okay, so what are our three equations that the starting polynomial system is? Looks like x one minus x two squared plus y one minus y two squared. I'm just going to keep, I've always debated whether d twelve should already be a squared distance or should we keep it like this? Let's just keep it like this because people are more used to looking at just distances instead of squared distances. And there tends to be confusion because of that. So we'll just stick to this. Two minus x three squared plus y two minus y three squared is d 23 squared. And this one is d 13 squared.
00:17:22.008 - 00:18:04.036, Speaker A: And here we've got x one minus x three squared plus y one minus y three squared. Okay, so we've got three equations and we've got six unknowns. What happened to the remaining three? So three equations. Somebody pin them. Yes. So essentially the point is that we are only interested in solutions, modular rotations. So we want solutions, which means, you know, real values for the point coordinates.
00:18:04.036 - 00:18:55.112, Speaker A: Real point coordinates, real x xi yi. Right. We want those, but we are only interested in those solutions. Modulo rotations and translations, because everything here is euclidean, okay? Translations and how many are there in two dimensions? So this is two reals. So we've got one rotation and two translations. So essentially this point here, if there's an origin here, zero, zero, you know, so this point has been translated by something, then all of those, the same translation applies to all of them. So there are two translations and then there's the rotation of the coordinate system.
00:18:55.112 - 00:20:00.534, Speaker A: So basically you've got one rotation and two translations, okay? So essentially to get rid of those, since we only want the solutions, modular rotations and translations, to get rid of them, simple trick that you apply is you simply say, okay, since I don't care about this translation anyway, let's just assume that this point is zero zero, okay? So x one becomes zero and y one is also zero. Okay, so maybe I should have used a different color there. Okay? X one is zero and y one is also zero. Okay? So we had x one here and y one here. Similarly, since we don't care about the rotation x two, by default, you can simply put it on the x axis. In other words, we don't care about the rotation of this x axis. So basically you can put this point here at d twelve.
00:20:00.534 - 00:20:40.426, Speaker A: And since because we know the distance here is d twelve, just put it there. And then the y, since we're putting it on the x axis, we can just make this d 120. So our y values here, x two is going to be d twelve. And your y two is just going to be zero. Okay, so you can see here immediately this equation. Basically, we have taken care of this equation basically by doing, by making these substitutions. So this equation is basically gone.
00:20:40.426 - 00:21:03.654, Speaker A: So now you've got two equations in two unknowns. And you can modify that a little bit by, you know, just thinking about this as. Okay, there's the point. Basically, we need the. So the x two and y two and x one and y one are all gone. I can substitute these everywhere. So this guy's x two is d twelve.
00:21:03.654 - 00:21:27.434, Speaker A: Y two is zero. X one is zero. Y one is zero. This seems to be two equations in two unknowns, which looks something like d twelve x three squared. It doesn't matter because it's a squared. I could have changed the order here. And then plus y three squared equals d 23 squared.
00:21:27.434 - 00:22:01.290, Speaker A: And then you've got this x three squared plus y three squared equals d 13 squared. We can manipulate this a little bit. And the way I think about the manipulation, and this is very general, you can do, this, is not just specific. So here you've got. Think of this as x x 13, sorry, x three. And this guy is y three. So essentially what we're saying here is that, you know, you can eliminate y three because you can write y three in two different ways.
00:22:01.290 - 00:22:32.634, Speaker A: So basically you've got D 13 minus x three squared. So because you've got y three, basically you can eliminate it. So you just have d 13 minus x three squared. D 13 minus x three squared is y three, which can also be written as. No, no, sorry, I did this wrong. Right, yeah. D 13 squared minus x three squared.
00:22:34.414 - 00:22:34.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:34.854 - 00:23:22.182, Speaker A: So that's y three squared. And you can also write it as d 23 squared minus, you know, d twelve minus x two squared. Okay, so you've got this one quadratic x three. No, x two is d twelve x three squared. Okay. So you've got this one quadratic in one variable, basically. So essentially, that's what you need to solve.
00:23:22.182 - 00:23:22.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:23.142 - 00:23:25.302, Speaker C: Mira here, the quadratic terms cancel.
00:23:25.398 - 00:23:35.014, Speaker A: You only get linear in this case. Uh, yeah. Because everything is a quadratic. I guess what you're saying. Oh, here.
00:23:35.314 - 00:23:36.482, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:36.538 - 00:23:42.834, Speaker A: Sure. You can just eliminate y three squared and you simply get this. You're right. Yeah.
00:23:42.954 - 00:23:46.986, Speaker C: Yes, actually, then when you substitute back into.
00:23:47.170 - 00:23:48.914, Speaker A: Oh, you do have the y equation.
00:23:49.034 - 00:23:50.706, Speaker C: You get two solutions for the.
00:23:50.730 - 00:24:27.442, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. So there'll be one quadratic one way or the other, you can't get rid of it. Right? So, okay, so essentially, that's our system. I mean, so that's corresponding to this. Now what? So this we have done for the very first triangle. But what? So for the moment, okay, before we even go to this example, let's consider the simple situation. Well, actually, I think I'm just going to use this page for a second.
00:24:27.442 - 00:25:26.304, Speaker A: So instead of this, just think of this for a moment. Even though that seems silly, just think of it for a moment as this graph. Instead of these three graphs here, I'm just going to have three triangles. Okay, this is a little bit silly because you can think about this instead of thinking about it as three, you know, three decomposable in this way, you could have simply thought about it as, you know, a HAnNEberg zero construction or whatever it is. And so you construct this triangle first, and then you construct this and then construct this and then construct this using the same idea that we did a moment ago, construction of a triangle. You could have done it that way, but for the moment, if you just think about it as a three decomposable graph. So you have this guy, this guy and this guy.
00:25:26.304 - 00:26:12.830, Speaker A: So you, the idea is that you solve one of them, you solve all three of them. So that's what the doctor plan tells you. So for this, for example, the doctor plan will looks like, I mean, the three decomposition, if you will, which we're going to generalize to the doctor plan will, you know, split it up into these three. So let's call the whole thing g, and let's call these three guys g one, g two and g three. So basically it'll start with g. Split it up into g, one g, each sharing one vertex each, and then take g itself, each of these. So g, one g, will be again split into, say, a triangle and these two edges, right? So triangle and two edges.
00:26:12.830 - 00:26:37.074, Speaker A: And then the triangle will be split into the three edges, which is the step that we just did. Okay. Um, and I'm just taking one, um, uh, step. We don't even need these extra triangles here, but let's say, suppose it looked like we thought about it this way. And these are the three. So then the corresponding g here would be g. I mean, this whole thing is g.
00:26:37.074 - 00:26:57.194, Speaker A: And then these guys are g, one g. So we have g, one g. Then each of those is a triangle. So it has three edges. So the same thing here and same thing here. So the idea is to solve the three of them. And then once you have the solutions to put them together.
00:26:57.194 - 00:27:38.162, Speaker A: And in all cases, even in this case, if you have the solution to this, a solution to this. And in this case, let's say we took the two. So the solution which puts this point and this point on the opposite side. So you have, you have found that length, and you have found that length, and you found this link. And therefore, now all it takes is to find it to position this point. That's all that's left to do in doing this recombination step. This recombination step just requires, since you already have the solution to g one, g two, and g three, and you're trying to get the solution to the whole thing, all it takes is to find this triangle.
00:27:38.162 - 00:28:15.582, Speaker A: So find this point. Once you find that point, you're done. So this step that we did just now is sufficient, again, to do that. So that's how the three decomposition works. So let's just work out the case. So I just want to point out what this recombination takes once you have the solution to this and the solution to this and the solution to this. Okay? So once you have the solutions, the problem, as you can see, is that if you solve this separately, you have, in the same way, you have solved this triangle.
00:28:15.582 - 00:28:44.372, Speaker A: Let's give these guys names. So let's say, let's call this guy x one. Sorry, p one, p two. I could have just done 123456. And if you had already done two, three, five, right? So if you had solved two, three, five, you would have placed 235. Let's say two, three, five. You solved the triangle.
00:28:44.372 - 00:29:27.042, Speaker A: You would have put two at zero, zero, and this point at whatever d two, 30. And you would have found the coordinates of five in the local coordinate. You think of it as a local coordinate system of this triangle where you have placed two at the origin. So that's the solution that you will have for this triangle. And that's the solutions that you will have for this triangle. And that's the same in any one of these things. When you finish solving them, you'll have pinned the local coordinate system of that piece by pinning one point at the origin and another point on the x axis somewhere.
00:29:27.042 - 00:29:47.218, Speaker A: Okay? So that's. And that you would have done the same thing for this. And you would have done the same thing for this. So let's take this example where we have done the single step. So each one of these triangles has been solved in this way. And all of them have such a solution where one of the points has been placed at zero, zero. The other point has been placed, let's say, on the x axis somewhere.
00:29:47.218 - 00:30:49.192, Speaker A: And the third point is the only one that you have solved for, really. So you've used one quadratic for this, one quadratic for this, one quadratic for this. And now you want to put them together, quote unquote. But what that means is to find the rotation and translation of the coordinate system of this thing and the coordinate system of this thing so that these points coincide. This point coincides and that point coincides. Okay? So the recombination step, so to speak, this recombination step, or for that matter, that recombination step, any recombination step, where, as I pointed out in the tree decomposable case, every recombination step corresponds to solving another triangle, all of whose distances are known, but the solutions, quote unquote for this, have been expressed in its local coordinate system. Solutions for this have been expressed in this local coordinate system.
00:30:49.192 - 00:31:27.320, Speaker A: So solving this triangle, so to speak, just corresponds to rotating, finding the rotations and translations of these two, what do you call it, triangles or sub graphs, so to speak, in such a way that these two points coincide. These two points coincide and those two points coincide. You understand? Which I mean by two points. There's a point in this triangle corresponding to this point. There's a point in this triangle corresponding to that point. There's a point in this triangle corresponding to this point, and there's a point in this triangle corresponding to this point. So there are two points that need to coincide, two points that need to coincide, and two points that need to coincide.
00:31:27.320 - 00:32:39.430, Speaker A: So you can think of this recombination system of solving this triangle, so to speak, equivalently as finding the rotations and translations of each of these, each of these pieces. You can always fix this to be whatever it was before, and such that these points, the coincidence constraints of the points, is satisfied. Okay? So the two are equivalent. Thinking of this, in the tree decomposable case, solving any recombination step, you can think of it as, I know these distances and therefore I want to place them in such a way that I know the position of this point and then recompute the coordinates of these guys, the same thing as doing this. So they are identical. So we want to, I want to point, sort of do a, you know, motivate what I mean by this, by just taking this little example. Okay, so let's just take the example we just did.
00:32:39.430 - 00:33:04.558, Speaker A: Right? So just for a triangle, this is sort of like the trivial case of what I'm talking about. Trivial case of thinking about solving, finding a polynomial, finding, solving the quadratic system corresponding to a triangle, you can think about it as finding a rotation and translation of something to get some incidence constraints to be satisfied.
00:33:04.646 - 00:33:30.974, Speaker D: Okay, can I ask a question before that? Yeah, uh, so, uh, you said that, uh, when you're recombining, uh, if you're, let's say you're recombining two, uh, sub graphs, uh, you need at least two points to coincide in 2d. Right. So is that something we keep in mind when we're doing the decomposition, that, uh, you know, two things that need to be combined have to have at least two points in common.
00:33:31.794 - 00:33:35.104, Speaker A: This is not true. Look at this case.
00:33:36.604 - 00:33:48.144, Speaker D: But we are recombining three things there. But if you're just combining two, if you just have one point among them, then it will not give you a unique position.
00:33:49.684 - 00:33:58.864, Speaker A: It's an under constraint system. So in that particular case that you're talking about, you would not have a doctor plan. That's a tree.
00:33:59.044 - 00:34:01.472, Speaker D: Okay, okay, okay.
00:34:01.568 - 00:34:08.120, Speaker A: So, but I think what you're saying is if the whole thing is minimally rigid.
00:34:08.232 - 00:34:08.920, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:34:09.072 - 00:34:20.136, Speaker A: Then if you have two sub graphs that are minimally rigid in it, then they would necessarily have to be coincide on two vertices.
00:34:20.280 - 00:34:20.992, Speaker D: Okay?
00:34:21.128 - 00:34:44.233, Speaker A: Right. And that was sort of incorporated in our definition of the canonical doctor plan. So in other words, if we took, you know, we had the two cases of the canonical. Let me continue with this, Rahul. I can recall the two cases of the canonical doctor plan which exactly reflect the two types of pairwise intersections between the subgraphs.
00:34:44.313 - 00:34:45.121, Speaker D: Okay. Okay.
00:34:45.217 - 00:34:45.853, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:46.553 - 00:35:10.154, Speaker C: Could I ask one question before we move on? It seems like there's some kind of magic that happens as you're doing the recombination step at each stage. It seems kind of clear how you're supposed to go ahead, but right at the very end, you've got, like, for instance, in this most complicated graph that you've got.
00:35:10.194 - 00:35:11.122, Speaker A: Yep, yep.
00:35:11.218 - 00:35:34.478, Speaker C: Right at the very end, you put this, this last piece in, and it has to match up in two spots, not just one. Why does it match up in the second spot? Like the first spot we guarantee, because we rotate it appropriately and translate the piece appropriately. But then it has to match up like with one of the other pieces.
00:35:34.646 - 00:36:11.274, Speaker A: I think maybe it wasn't clear what I was saying, so I was thinking about it in two different ways. Right. The first way is to think about. Just so I have already solved this, right? And I have solved this, which means I know this distance. Yes, I can compute that distance similarly I can compute this distance and I know that. So once I find that this, these two distances, then I can position this point using the same method that we did. Okay, so the point is known.
00:36:11.274 - 00:36:27.838, Speaker A: So because we know that these two distances or what I got from the solution to this and solution to this, I know that I should be able to place this guy with that distance here and same thing here. I see.
00:36:27.886 - 00:36:28.686, Speaker C: Okay.
00:36:28.870 - 00:36:48.904, Speaker A: Okay. And so now all it takes is to find whatever the rotation and translation that will. That, you know, I'll have to re, you know, I see change of basis. I have to do a change of basis for the solutions that I had for the x and y coordinates for this guy and the x and y coordinates for this guy.
00:36:49.644 - 00:36:57.332, Speaker C: That makes sense. So you first solve this kind of purple triangle problem and then you patch the pieces on top of that.
00:36:57.468 - 00:38:06.116, Speaker A: Exactly. And I'm trying to say that the reason I'm doing this, thinking about this in this slightly more general way is because by thinking about this in the slightly more general way, we can extend to general doctor plants, not just the tree decomposable ones. Okay? So if you think about it in a slightly more general way, what you're really doing here is, and I put the triangles here because that was the example I was going to do. But we can stay here if you want. Okay, so I can just use the same picture. So this picture, you can think about it equivalently, as I said, as, you know, either solving this pink triangle, I think I'm usually at another color. So either solving that pink triangle or just saying, okay, I've got a rigid body that I placed here, and I have a second rigid body whose rotations and translations I have to find and a third rigid body whose rotations and translations I have to find in such a way that these two points go coincide.
00:38:06.116 - 00:39:06.564, Speaker A: These two points coincide and these two points coincide. Okay, so I can think of it as finding the rotations and translations, the orientation. So t for any given rigid body ri. I want to find the translation, the rotations and same thing here, you know, such that these incidents, now I've converted it into a set of incidents constraints between points. Okay, there's still a caveat here that some of these incidents, constraints, each of these, you know, you might think of it as I have to equate the X's and I have to equate the Y's, equate the x's, equate the Y's, equate the x's, equate the Y's. That seems like there are six of them, but really, because these distances are known three of off these three incidents constraints. Sorry, of these two incidents constraints, only one is independent.
00:39:06.564 - 00:39:31.764, Speaker A: And that's one of the things that we're going to talk about later is how to get a well constrained set of incidences knowing that this distance is fixed. And I mean this distance is, you know, given the distance is actually given. So you don't have six incidence independent incidence constraints. So, um. So anyway. Yeah.
00:39:32.064 - 00:39:41.400, Speaker B: Um. So just to make sure I'm thinking about this. Right. When you're taking three rigid bodies with these coincident vertices.
00:39:41.552 - 00:39:42.284, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:42.944 - 00:39:52.324, Speaker B: This would correspond to a system of eight equations, two quadratic, six linear in eight unknowns.
00:39:56.784 - 00:40:05.480, Speaker A: If you just think about it as three rigid bodies in two dimensions. You mean. Yes, yeah. Well you can sort of, without the.
00:40:05.512 - 00:40:10.204, Speaker B: Three vertex coincidences are six linear equations.
00:40:10.744 - 00:40:20.090, Speaker A: In the right Xi x one. I mean, x one position in the first one is equal to the x one's position in the second one. Yeah, that kind of thing. Yeah. Okay.
00:40:20.122 - 00:40:28.458, Speaker B: And then two of the rigid bodies, you'll need a rotation. So you introduce maybe two variables whose sum of squares is one.
00:40:28.626 - 00:40:29.650, Speaker A: That's right.
00:40:29.842 - 00:40:37.534, Speaker B: So that gives you two extra. You have six linear equations from the coincidence vertices and two extra quadratics to handle a rotation.
00:40:38.074 - 00:40:51.126, Speaker A: Right, okay. Okay. But then, as I said, you know several of the. Because you fix this position. Right. You know several of these linear ones just disappear. Yeah.
00:40:51.150 - 00:40:53.142, Speaker B: The linear ones will be really nice and easy.
00:40:53.238 - 00:41:26.030, Speaker A: Easy, yeah. Okay. Yeah. So let's, so the reason I'm going through this crazy exercise, you say, oh, I just do the triangle and then I find the corresponding. The reason I'm going through this other way of thinking about it is because that can be generalized to anything. Okay? And that's what I rushed through last time and I wanted to take, and Alex sort of made me aware that I had rushed through it. So I'm going to take a little longer to do that.
00:41:26.030 - 00:41:58.824, Speaker A: So here, let's just take our simple, just to go back to what we did, you know, since in the in. So let's say, let me just draw the three, this sort of three rigid body picture. R1.02 reals. Three reals. So this is all living in r two for the moment, just in case, I say. But it generalizes to any dimension really.
00:41:58.824 - 00:42:44.026, Speaker A: So what we're saying, and, you know, it won't be exactly three things, it'll be you for higher three reals, it'll be four things, each incident on one point. But there are more things, more possibilities will be there that they're incident on an edge and various other things all within minimally rigid grasp. Okay? So for the moment, let's just stick to r two. So here we are. And we want to put this together. And the lazy thing that we did when we solved one of them, any one of them, the lazy thing that we did is we just said, this is zero, zero. And this thing is whatever, d if you had one and two.
00:42:44.026 - 00:43:13.484, Speaker A: So we said d one 20. But let's say, because, you know, these are floating around and really you don't have a. You cannot really do that to all three of them. Think of it that way. You know, so what you really, if you didn't want to introduce sines and cosines in the beginning, what you should have done is just say, okay, I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to call this x one y one and x two y two. And of course, that's your familiar equation.
00:43:13.484 - 00:44:03.678, Speaker A: So that means these are connected by a very familiar equation, which is that x one minus x two squared plus y one minus y two squared is d twelve squared. Okay? And so now if you eventually. So what we're essentially saying is that we don't know where x one y one is in relation to. So there's a translation here and we don't know how this might be rotated in general. So there's that rotation. So there are two translational variables here, and there's a rotational variable there that will take us from zero zero d one 20 to x one y one x two y two. Plus, of course, the fact that we know that one of the distances is this d twelve.
00:44:03.678 - 00:44:33.832, Speaker A: So that's null. So if you think about it that way, you can think of it as rotation and translation. You can simply leave the translation as x one y one. Those are my translational variables. X one y one. And now let me think of this other thing as a rotational variable because this distance is fixed. I can simply set, you know, make the substitution.
00:44:33.832 - 00:45:16.584, Speaker A: And this I can do always, right? I can always make this substitution. By always I mean, it doesn't matter what dimension I'm in. Okay? So x two squared minus y one minus y two squared is just call it. Or this, we know, happens to be d twelve squared. Just call it c two squared, just the cosine of the rotation angle. And you can also make the other one, y one minus y two squared divided by d one two squared. And then simply set c two squared plus s two squared equals one.
00:45:16.584 - 00:46:21.124, Speaker A: Right? So if you do this, then the process that you went through to. So basically you will, because of this, also get that x one minus x two squared is going to be d twelve squared times c two squared and y one minus y two squared. I mean I could have removed the squares, but I'm just leaving it there because that's what falls out of this. So you basically get d one two squared times s two squared. Okay, so essentially you get the trans, you know, the variables, the second variable of x two and y two variables, sorry, the coordinates of the second point. The coordinates of the first point are the translate, we're going to leave it, the coordinates of the second point you can simply obtain from, directly from these two other variables. So basically you changed x two, y two into these two other variables.
00:46:21.124 - 00:47:14.352, Speaker A: So that's essentially what's going on. What you did in the beginning, the pinning of the, each one of these into its local coordinate system by setting one of the variables to zero and the other one to be something instead. If you had just done what we just did, then you have for each one of these. So for r three you will have a c three and s three. And a translate for one of the points translates for one of the points and the same thing for, for this one. So again you'll have a c two and an, two reals, I mean, sorry, s two and a translate. So essentially the, you have just rewritten the equations in this manner.
00:47:14.352 - 00:47:57.004, Speaker A: That's, that's all there is. Okay, so now I think we can go to that second part of the second hour that I had last time. I'll save this. Okay. And, and take our, go through that. Okay, so we had, now we're going to r three. So you have to do a little, um, a little, you know, your imagination has to now move to three reals.
00:47:57.004 - 00:49:10.268, Speaker A: So what we had here, and the clusters are basically, you know, this is one recombination step. We're concentrating just like we did a moment ago, just on one recombination step in that recombination step. In this case we happen to have all the first, in the first case, just think of the first case, we just have the clusters c one, c two and c three. Okay, so it's a decomp. It's one possible way to think about the recombination step corresponding to one parent with its children. Okay, so it's, the parent and its children will look like this in what is called the canonical doctor plan, which essentially has all the maximal, maximal proper subgraphs that are rigid and what I have drawn here, c one, c two, all the way through c seven, are all of the possible children of that parent, I mean all of the children of that parent in this canonical structure. And we are now about to do one recombination step.
00:49:10.268 - 00:50:28.984, Speaker A: And I'm going to point out to you that, you know, the doctor plan will give you this canonical decomposition. And there is still work to be done when you're doing each recombination step to sort of find the best way to write that system. Okay, so first we're going to do the sort of dumb way to write the system and which is almost a direct mirror of what I did a moment ago for the triangle decomposable case. Okay, so what it's going to do is for each of the, it's going to represent the x coordinate in the coordinate system of that particular child, which I call CI child subgraph. And this is what I'm going to call that. So for a given point, a xaci is the coordinates of that point, the three coordinates of that point in the local coordinate system of the child in which it belongs. And as I said, there are some points that are going to belong in two children, which means it'll be clear even though it says a, because I'm looking at that particular child, you're going to have a separate coordinate for that.
00:50:28.984 - 00:52:04.174, Speaker A: So, so, okay, so Xac, so this one, I think this is a mistake here. So Xaci would be the coordinates of a in local coordinate system, and this is the coordinates of a parameterized and c coordinate system. Okay, so there's slight difference here, but we'll come to that later. Let's talk about that later. So now what I call the unoptimized algebraic system, which is what we, which we basically did just now, you can take any subset of children which cover all the vertices and, you know, place them, solve for their rotations and translations, so they are corresponding r sici, whatever, in such a way that incidences and potentially certain distances have to be satisfied. This is one way to do it. Otherwise, if you had done it exactly the way I talked about, you would then use essentially not just c one, c two, c three, but you would also in addition use c five, c six and c seven and make incidences that say that the point h in c two is the same as the point h in c seven, and so forth.
00:52:04.174 - 00:53:08.356, Speaker A: You would have done all of them. But in general, it is sufficient to take a set of children whose set of vertices cover the set of vertices of the entire graph and then have a combination of vertex, I mean incidence constraints and distance constraints and the distance constraints being those edges that have been left out. So when I say covering set here, I mean covering set of the vertices. So if I take covering set of the vertices and then the edges that have been left out from this covering set are then added as constraints that need to be solved in the recombination system. So the set, the coordinate system of c to be one of the child clusters, which is the home cluster. And the simple case we're only going to take c one, c two, c three and we're going to take c one to be the home cluster. So this would be sort of the dumb way in which we did a moment ago.
00:53:08.356 - 00:54:06.306, Speaker A: We had three clusters and we just took any one of them and set them as the home, home cluster. So home cluster means that's the coordinate system in which everything is going to be eventually expressed. Okay, so that is, so get c two and c three's position and orientation within C's coordinate system using a composite 3d rotation matrix and a translation vector t. In the two dimensional case we just had, you know, see two, I mean one angle and a translation, two translations. In this case you'll have three translation because the first point will be some x y, x one, y one. I mean the first point in, the first point in a given cluster will have three coordinates. That's the translation of that cluster and it will have, and I'm here in this case simply going to call it tc one, tc two, sorry, TCi.
00:54:06.306 - 00:55:04.854, Speaker A: So Tci is the x, CI, yci and Zci, right. And the rotation matrix. So basically the rotation matrix that will give you the new positions of any given xy in terms of the old positions, just like we wrote down a moment ago, the x two, y two. I guess I should just go back here. So just like we wrote x two. Now in terms of the rotations here we can just think of it as a matrix that would, then it's a linear transformation that takes the old coordinate system, all the points in the old quad in their old basis express that in the new basis after the rotation and translation, that's a matrix. And you can just think of this as a matrix equation and that's what we've done here.
00:55:04.854 - 00:56:41.566, Speaker A: Okay, so you can now write the, any new, so the, so the positions in the, of a given point in the new coordinate system can be written by just applying this rotation matrix to the, its the positions of the point in the old coordinate system. Okay, in its original coordinate system in which you solved it. So basically you have in three dimensions, of course you have three cosines and three sines, and then of course you have the si plus CI squared equals one three of them instead of just one as you had in the two dimensional case. So if you did that, your unoptimized algebraic system, which is again just for this one recombination step, again, remember, each recombination step corresponds to one block of the larger system that you're solving. Once you solve it, all the points, all the variables here are now going to become sort of fixed. And the only variables that are going to be left are going to be the rotations and translations of the entire system to be placed in the next recombination step in relation to the other that are also children of the grandparent. So if you go here, so you have six active constraints by six, oh, remember that we have these three distance constraints.
00:56:41.566 - 00:57:27.586, Speaker A: So once we took c one, c two, c three, we still have, it didn't cover these constraints. So these, this have to be established. So instead of an incidence, you know, we, we actually have to say that the distance between d, which belongs to this cluster and I, that belongs to this cluster is something. And of course you have the three incidence constraints that says that the a in this cluster is equal to the a in this cluster, c in this cluster is equal to the c in this cluster, and b here is equal to the b here. So you've got six incidences and three distances. So that's what it says here. So six active constraints, three distances of this type, and it says three overlap constraints.
00:57:27.586 - 00:58:32.990, Speaker A: These are incidences, but the incidences are really nine because the three incidences now become nine of these because one for each of the three coordinates. So altogether you end up with twelve polynomial equations and twelve variables. A lot of them are of course these linear ones. They look linear. But if you remember, this is the coordinates that have to be multiplied by the rotation and translation matrices. So each of these will really be, all of these will just be in the variables si's and cis variables. So the three distance constraints will have degree six because, because the, each of these variables themselves have potentially, you know, combinations of sines and cosines, like things like, you know, they have potentially s one, c two, c, three things like this.
00:58:32.990 - 00:59:07.784, Speaker A: So as a result of which each of these might have degree three. And then you square that it becomes degree six and you can work a little harder and use quaternions for the incidence. So you'll end up with eight equations of degree four. Okay, so that's the unoptimized algebraic, let's forget about this last bit. Okay, so just, just think of it as twelve equations and twelve variables and each could have degree six. The linear ones, of course, have degree three. The quadratic ones will end up with degree six.
00:59:07.784 - 01:00:27.882, Speaker A: So if you, now this tells us that if you did it the way that we did it for three decomposable graphs, which is simply solve the three rigid bodies and do the obvious incidence and distance constraints between them in order to place their relative orientation with respect to each other, this is what will happen. But then if you do it a little bit better and just give me a few minutes, we went through this once, so you'll, I can do this very quickly in about a minute or two. So just think of the central, so instead of taking sort of like a minimal set that covers all the vertices, you take another set. And that requires, I will show later that that requires solving another optimization, combinatorial optimization problem, which is to find this set. And why did we find that set? Because if we did that, then because these are adjacent on an edge, there's only one rotation to be solved for each of these three clusters. So there's only one rotation angle and there are of course three incidences. Right? So if you took this as a home, and so again, this is showing two different possibilities.
01:00:27.882 - 01:01:33.644, Speaker A: If you took this as a home cluster, then you have the two incidences here and you now have a rotation of a 3d object around a point. And, sorry, you can fix this and have a 3d rotation about a point, and that itself corresponds to two rotations. And then you have one incidence constraint, you could do it that way, or you could simply say, okay, this, I just think of this as my home cluster, and then each of these is related to it using just a 1d rotation and be done with that. Okay. And so, and in general, you know, you may not know these, these may not be edges in the original graph. So what this is saying is that these need not have been edges in the original graph. This, you know, this could have been a non edge, this could have been a b, could have been a non edge, ac could have been a non edge as we had in this, in this case, in the original.
01:01:33.644 - 01:02:28.494, Speaker A: So in this case, for example, this was a non edge, non edge, non edge. But it doesn't matter. Those distances are known because you've solved this and solved this and solved this. So what this is saying is that what this is saying in this picture, here is that you don't, you know, this thing in the middle need not have been a subgraph that's rigid. Right. As long as we know this, the length here and this length here and this length here from having solved this, this and this, you can use that essentially as a rigid, rigidified, so to speak, triple of vertices a, b and C. Okay, so, so you can simply use that as though it were a rigid sub graph in the middle.
01:02:28.494 - 01:03:09.870, Speaker A: So that's what you do. So the second thing is use c one, c two, c three, and c four. And c 4 may not, may or may not have been a rigid subgraph of the original graph. So in other words, it may not have been in the canonical decomposition at all. You could still use it as an optimized way to actually take the recombination step in the doctor plan and get an optimized algebraic system. So you use the c four as the home cluster, and then you simply use the sine and cosine of the angles, those three angles that are shown here, these three angles. We're not doing this.
01:03:09.870 - 01:03:50.614, Speaker A: This is a silly way to do it, to use this as a home cluster and use like a 3d rotation angle about this point. This is not being used. We're just using this, this one. And if you do it that way, we end up, to cut a long story short, we end up with six constraints and six variables, and all the constraints are quadratic. Okay? And so, and in the, it says compare with degree four. But in the, that comparison with degree four is already doing some non traditional stuff here with quaternions that got this thing down to degree four. Right? So we, in general, it was degree six.
01:03:50.614 - 01:04:31.356, Speaker A: So now we have also done something totally automatizable. And I'll show you that this optimization step that I just did of picking this as the home cluster is also a totally automatizable step. And we can now have decreased the algebraic complexity. So there's some work to be done. I mean, as you can see, it's not quite clear how this can always be done. And that's what then the second set of lectures after the break will be about. Okay, hopefully that made it a little clearer.
01:04:31.356 - 01:04:32.104, Speaker A: Alex.
01:04:33.164 - 01:04:48.340, Speaker B: Yeah, that was great. Thank you. Okay, you could, of course, just start with the original graph and have just all quadratics, all degree two, but, you know, just many equations and variables. Right.
01:04:48.532 - 01:04:56.920, Speaker A: No, the problem is, that's, that's not the thing. How do you solve a, you know, it's an untriangularized system that's the problem.
01:04:57.032 - 01:04:59.312, Speaker B: Like you could solve it with homotopic continuation.
01:04:59.408 - 01:05:15.288, Speaker A: Yeah, you could do homotopy continuation, and that's, that typical complexity of that is double exponential in the number of equations that have to be solved simultaneously. Okay, so that's with grub, the complexity of all of those.
01:05:15.416 - 01:05:16.808, Speaker B: Not grobner basis.
01:05:16.976 - 01:05:34.914, Speaker A: No. Even grobner. Anyone. In the end, if you're going to find all the solutions, it's equivalent to having done rhobdobasis. Even with homotopic continuation, if you want to find all the solutions, it's the same complexity. It's not any better complexity wise.
01:05:35.454 - 01:05:36.214, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:36.334 - 01:05:39.766, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you want to. So the point here is, I mean.
01:05:39.870 - 01:05:44.654, Speaker B: You don't get the actual solutions exactly. You get numerical approximations.
01:05:44.814 - 01:05:54.904, Speaker A: You get numerical approximations. I understand that, but the point, I'm not, I'm not focusing on that point. I'm focusing on the point that you have to find all the solutions.
01:05:56.284 - 01:05:57.124, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:57.284 - 01:06:43.366, Speaker A: Okay. So bottini and all this stuff, I mean, initially in the homotopy continuation methods, which are semanumeric methods, had to struggle with, how do we ensure that we really do find all the solutions? But then, now, apparently they're pretty good at that. But my point is, no matter how you do it, whether you do it symbolically or numerically, or semi numerically or whatever, if you're going to find all the solutions, you're essentially doing something equivalent, whichever way you do it, and the complexities are the same, the only way in which you can defeat the complexity is if you can minimize the number of equations that you solve simultaneously, which.
01:06:43.390 - 01:06:45.622, Speaker B: Is why this block triangularization.
01:06:45.758 - 01:07:27.344, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. So, and once you have minimized the number, you solve simultaneously, which is what the doctor plan gives you. You still have optimization to do to actually reduce the degree and things like that, and the exact number. So the Dr. Plan tells you there is a rough number of these equations that you have to solve simultaneously, but you can still optimize exactly what the proportionality there is, how many, exactly what factor of the doctor plan fan and size you can actually eventually achieve in terms of the size of your system and the degrees and so forth. So that's the second part.
01:07:27.344 - 01:07:46.934, Speaker A: So that's what we're going to do next, maybe two weeks. Okay, so the combinatorial part, how to find the doctor plan second part, what is the combinatorial part in optimizing the algebraic complexity, and then we'll actually do the algebraic, the algebraic part itself.
