00:00:00.640 - 00:01:00.082, Speaker A: Good afternoon. I found something else I'd like to just draw to your attention. It's an article about fundamental fundamental science and about the effect of artificial intelligence on it. The title of the article is the dawn of post theory science. It's an article from the Guardian Weekly. So, does the advent of AI and machine learning mean that the classic scientific methodology, hypothesize, predict, and test, has had its day? Well, Isaac Newton apocryphally discovered his second law after the one about gravity. After an apple fell on his head.
00:01:00.082 - 00:01:50.740, Speaker A: Much experimentation and data analysis later, he realized there was a fundamental relationship between force, mass and acceleration. He formulated a theory to describe that relationship, one that could be expressed as an equation, f ma, and used it to predict the behavior of objects other than apples. Contrast how science is increasingly done today. Facebook's machine learning tools predict your preferences better than any psychologist. Alpha Fold, a program built by deep mind, has produced the most accurate predictions yet of protein structures based on the amino acids they contain. Both are silent on why they work, why you prefer this or that information, why this sequence generates that structure. You can't lift the curtain and peer into the mechanism.
00:01:50.740 - 00:02:27.404, Speaker A: They offer no explanation, no theory. They just work. We witness the social effects of Facebook predictions daily. Alphafold has yet to make its impact felt, but many are convinced it will change medicine. So the article deals with a number of objections. The final objection to post theory science is that there is likely to be useful old style theory, that is, generalizations extracted from discrete examples. That remains to be discovered, and only humans can do that because it requires intuition.
00:02:27.404 - 00:03:22.374, Speaker A: One reason we consider Newton brilliant is that in order to come up with his second law, he had to ignore some data. You had to imagine, for example, that things were falling in a vacuum free of the interfering effects you in nature. The mathematician Christian Stumpf of Ruhr University, Baucham in Germany, called this intuitive step the core of the creative process. But the reason he was writing about it was to say that for the first time, an AI had pulled it off. Deep mind had built a machine learning program that had prompted mathematicians towards new insights, new generalizations in the mathematics of notch. Well, not, not the application of mathematics to not just part of operator algebra theory. So you should look it up.
00:03:22.374 - 00:03:55.834, Speaker A: Look up the Jones polynomial, if you haven't, if you're not familiar with it already. Jones was an operator algebraic in 2020. Well, this was a year ago, in 2022. Therefore, there's almost no stage of the scientific process where AI hasn't left its footprint. And the more we draw it into our quest for knowledge, the more it changes that quest. We can reassure ourselves about one thing. We're still asking the question.
00:03:55.834 - 00:04:47.034, Speaker A: As Pablo Picasso put it in the 1960s, computers are useless. They can only give you answers. Let me just go through the list quickly. Husim, Anjin, Abigail Arsenal. Thank you. Alexander Bullen, Jack Cerrone. Okay, thanks.
00:04:47.034 - 00:05:44.984, Speaker A: Huge ching. Thank you. Carissa cho Lee. Thank you. Archipelago Chowdhury, Siddharth Dagan, Daniel Dima, Justin Hood, Sabek, Germany, Charles Griffin, Ben May Grover, Henry Hoo, fellow Casa. Thank you. Oh, you're Jalal.
00:05:44.984 - 00:05:58.708, Speaker A: But the real Jalal. Please stand up. Okay. No, but I. But you're Vincent. Okay, that. Why.
00:05:58.708 - 00:06:29.564, Speaker A: Is that. Why. Okay, but I don't know if I can. What's your last name? Hanof one. Okay, it's here. It says, shao hua Huang. Okay, sure, but.
00:06:29.564 - 00:07:15.924, Speaker A: All right, well, I. All right, so I should have mentioned your name before. Jalo Cassav's name? Yeah. Alphabetically. Alexander Cole. Luke. Look at.
00:07:15.924 - 00:07:41.858, Speaker A: Thank you. Abu Bakr, Mohib Rubin. Neva Sarjan. Jonathan Egg. Oh, thank you. I don't have any homework for you yet. I had a lot of people I don't have homework from.
00:07:41.858 - 00:08:23.684, Speaker A: But you're sorry you forgot for homework? Yeah. Good. Okay. All right. Rishi Praka, Siyud, Mohammed Raza. Hy hy shein. You go one.
00:08:23.684 - 00:09:38.944, Speaker A: Convolver, can you go? Okay, well, there's. The various ideas in this course are quite closely related. An underlying theme is not very distinctive, but also another underlying theme is classification. And one reason these two themes are related is that you classify things. You look at k zero, or, for af algebra, you look at k zero, and there's k one, too. Okay. One of an af algebra is zero.
00:09:38.944 - 00:10:37.924, Speaker A: And if it weren't for Bach, periodist, you'd have to look at the complex feature algorithm, the usual setting. You'd have to look at k two, k three, k four, and so on. But this is all. This is all taken care of by k zero and k one. And you do have to use k zero and k one for af algebra. Use k zero. Well, let's take a look at why we don't need k one for an afl.
00:10:37.924 - 00:12:01.344, Speaker A: Anyone want to comment on that? Why don't we talk about k one? Both? Actually, as I mentioned earlier, there is a way in which k one gets used for af algebra. If you have. If you have an ideal. And portion of it follows that the tension algebra, large algebra, is also af, and the proof of that is the conceptual point of view. It's more or less immediate for the ray of bot very distance. Okay, and why is that? Well, does anyone remember any of my comments on that? Or have I looked it up to come across it? Yeah, right. These are functors.
00:12:01.344 - 00:13:16.724, Speaker A: Of course, k zero aren't the ideal k zero of a k zero proportion. Then you have, okay, one, I like to write everything from left to right, but some people flip it, I think a circular diagram, more elegant. Well, I said this before, but I think people don't realize is that, and by the way, there are index maps like this going from the k one of the quotient, the even index map goes to k one of the quotient, k zero of the output. And the odd one goes from exist in the over complex field. It goes from k zero, k one, which is why it's called on sometimes. I don't know why, but I got a kick out of. Yeah, sorry.
00:13:16.724 - 00:13:51.140, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. Yeah. And you have to remember, we haven't discussed the non unital algebra, right. But the suspension, unless it's zero, will always be, unless the original algebra is zero, the suspension will always be non unit because it's continuous functions vanishing at infinity. If you had a unit, its norm would be continuous. Right? So it couldn't vanish at infinity, the norm at a point, at every point value. It's a function of values in the algebra.
00:13:51.140 - 00:14:33.540, Speaker A: And if the values could include the unit, then if they were a unit all the way, then the value, the norm, would be equal to one everywhere on the line. Okay, so no unit. But then how do you get k zero for non unit algebra? Fully short answer is you just adjoin a unit. That's why there's an exercise. It's adjoining a unit. This gives you, of course, to do this, all you have to know is joining a unit gives you an algebra, this unit. But yes, well, sure.
00:14:33.540 - 00:15:19.864, Speaker A: Well, we haven't actually got, oh, we did get to a definition. It was phase zero of the suspension rate. Okay, well, and it's true that the Forbanek algorithm with unit, you can get it by talking about, by talking about invertible elements for a C style convert enough to look at unitary elements. Okay, well that's, that's a, that's a good exercise that it comes out to the, comes out to the same thing. That's quite important. We could talk about that. Very good point.
00:15:19.864 - 00:16:47.806, Speaker A: So if you're going to prove something like this, it constructs the index map. It's, you have to decide what the best way to define k one is, what the best what? The most convenient definition of k one is, okay? But the fact remains that when you look at an ideal of an algebra, well, the ideal is very unlikely to have the unit, okay? Because if it couldn't have the unit, if it was a proper ideal, it couldn't have contain the unit of the whole algebra. It would have to be equal to the whole algebra in that case. But even if it has its own, just its own unit, then the ideal would be a complementary ideal. The whole algebra would be the direct sum of two ideals with intersection zero and products. All products between elements of the two ideals would be zero. There might be called orthogonal ideal, the whole algebra meter direct sum of two ideals, which is quite special.
00:16:47.806 - 00:18:07.802, Speaker A: For instance, if you look at the compact operators contained in algebra, bounded operators on the Hilbert space, then I guess that ideal doesn't, doesn't have a unit, because the unit isn't compact. And so now just because it is a direct summon doesn't mean that it has, it has to have a unit, right? If you take any algebra whatsoever, take the direct sum of two copies of it, then you'll have two orthogonal ideals in the direct sum algebra. But okay, one way or one way or another, you define k one. It's a functor. If you define it as k zero of a suspension, then it's. Maybe you can say it's a function as soon as you know k zero is a function because the suspension is natural operation, so on. But okay, let's look and see what the best definition of k one is to prove that k one of an af algebra is zero.
00:18:07.802 - 00:19:08.216, Speaker A: Okay, why is it true that k one of an. So the point is that when I is an af algebra, the ideal is af, then the k one group is going to be zero. Okay, but then this 6th term exact sequence says that the map, the canonical map, the functorial map from the algebra, the unknown algebra, onto the quotient. The level of k zero is projected. Okay, is everyone, is everyone familiar enough with some diagram tracing to see that it's an exact sequence? It's an exact sequence. There we go. Have you run into what an exact sequence is? Yeah, exactly.
00:19:08.216 - 00:19:56.584, Speaker A: As soon as you say, Colonel, then I can see you know the answer. Courtesy. Do you know the answer? So what's the other word besides kernel? We have. Yeah, okay, but what's the important relationship between them? Yeah, okay, that's what exactness means. If you have a map, a diagram with a map going into it, then another map coming out of it and just one map in each case, one map going in, one map coming out. The diagram is exact at that point. If the image of the, one of the map going in is as a subject of the object that you're talking about, is equal to the kernel of the map going on.
00:19:56.584 - 00:20:50.454, Speaker A: Now, image always makes sense for map between sets. Kernel is restricted to vector spaces, right, or group, but we're talking about algebras and particularly their vector spaces. So the kernel should be equal to the image. But then if the image is zero, then that means the kernel is everything, right? The kernel of the map of the, this map. I wanted to repeat my little joke, but you might think that these two, this diagram is quite messy because the two index maps cross over, right. That's okay. You might want to go in a nice circle.
00:20:50.454 - 00:21:25.516, Speaker A: So you might want to flip this one, flip this one so it goes like that. That's what is quite common for people to do. But to me that's a really funny joke because any, well, this particular plane diagram, in any case, it can be distorted so that it's in the plane. None of the lines cross over. Okay, everyone agree? Yeah. You just take this, you consider it as a string and just take it and you move it up. Okay.
00:21:25.516 - 00:22:08.364, Speaker A: If it bothers you. If it bothers you, yeah. Okay. And then the idea of going left to right on the function side, that's just, I mean, that's just, I wouldn't be able to remember anything without keeping track of that. But that helps keep track of them. Okay. But so the, now we're talking about, now if the big algebra is af, that means if you have a projection here, it will be the image of a projection here, it'll lift the projection there.
00:22:08.364 - 00:23:16.806, Speaker A: That's a easy exercise. And by the way, to prove this theorem, it's enough to consider the case that this is just a complex number. The quotient is just quite a more complex number, and then, well, maybe, maybe two copies of the complex number. And let's go you. So at a certain point before it was proved using that, projections do lift. Every projection in the quotient comes from a projection in the algebra, which is true if it's a necessary thing you have to prove. But it's also sufficient because I had developed enough technical tools to prove that Ca had to be af.
00:23:16.806 - 00:23:52.562, Speaker A: If you knew the projections always came from production. That says that the level of productions, the map is projected, right? But what is k zero? K zero is projections. K zero is, I employ. So the map, if we have the map coming out of k zero of the quotient, is zero. That means the map coming in is trajectory. That means every k zero class for the quotient comes from a k zero class. Here, the k zero classes lift.
00:23:52.562 - 00:24:59.414, Speaker A: K zero classes come from k zero classes. We want to prove that the projections come from projection. Well, uh, what's missing? If projections are essentially k zero, k zero classes are essentially projections. Then if you know that the k zero classes downstairs comes from k zero classes, why don't you know the projections come from projections? Well, you have. There's a bit of a song and dance to establish that, for one thing. For one thing, the k zero classes don't come from single productions. They come from pairs of productions, right? Because that's how, if you have a semigroup, semi group consists of the classes of so called equivalence classes, Murray for lemon, equivalents, classes of single product by the board.
00:24:59.414 - 00:26:07.344, Speaker A: And then if you look at the developing group, the universal developing group of a semi group, and you look at pairs of elements, right? If you want to construct integers from natural numbers, you look at ordered pairs of natural numbers. When do people normally do that in school? When do people first learn about integers as pairs of natural numbers? Oh, sorry. As pairs of natural numbers? Well, if you just look at single natural numbers, those are natural numbers. But if you want to look at pairs, trying to look at integers, then you have to have two natural numbers so you can subtract. Oh, okay. Just like when you're defining index. Okay.
00:26:07.344 - 00:27:08.794, Speaker A: But so in particular, no, when you're defining a group from a semigroup, you always look at pairs of elements in the semigroup, and you look at equivalence classes of those pairs. And what this does is allow you to say that the equivalents class is something like the difference between these two individual things, which you might call the formal difference. You can't, if you're just given a semigroup, you don't know how to subtract. And don't forget that when we map it, when we construct this enveloping group, the semi group may not map objectively, may not actually be contained in the developing group. That makes it slightly complicated. In fact, the map may not be objective. In fact, the group might be zero, the developing group might be zero, and the semi group is non zero.
00:27:08.794 - 00:27:30.858, Speaker A: I guess an example of that would be semi group. One plus one equals one. What's the enveloping group? You come. Well, the semi group is a single element. One. Or call it. We'll call it one, maybe call it x.
00:27:30.858 - 00:27:57.114, Speaker A: And the addition is x plus X equals x. So that's a semi group. Right. Okay, so what's the universal development group? X. Sorry? Well, X isn't anything. I mean, you have to say what the operation is because you want to define a group. It's not enough to say what the elements are.
00:27:57.114 - 00:29:07.806, Speaker A: Well, but we're talking about addition. Right, but, okay, but then what is the addition, if you call the single element, obviously. Well, it might be more than a single element, but let's assume it's right. The universal developing group just has a single element and x maps into x. Embedding the mapping from the semi group into the universal developing group is taking a single element x into the, into x. Okay, but then if in the semigroup, the addition operations given by X plus X equals x, well, the map into the group is additive. Right? So the, in the group you're going to have X plus X equals x, right? Well, actually that means that X is zero.
00:29:07.806 - 00:29:34.024, Speaker A: Right? But that's also true in a semigloup. It's also true in the semi group. X is zero in the semigroom because X plus X equals x. X plus anything is anything. So that means that the semi group is already a group in that case. So it wasn't a very good example where the mapping wasn't injected. Okay, so, but suppose you take the semi group with two elements, zero and 10 and one.
00:29:34.024 - 00:30:51.720, Speaker A: Then zero plus anything is anything and then one plus one equals one. How about that? Now the question is, what is the group? Well, I guess the zero is going to go into the zen of the element of the group. But also, just like before, the x is going to have to go into the identity element of the group. Because in any group, if you have x plus x equals x, then x must be zero. Right? Okay, so everything goes into zero, but the semigroup is not, it doesn't, it has two elements. So that shows that they universal developing group doesn't always contain the generated by the major semi group, but it might, it could be zero and the original semi group is non zero, for instance. Okay, so, but in, so in general, the, well, this isn't really addressing the question of what the construction is.
00:30:51.720 - 00:31:40.304, Speaker A: Why you, well, generally look at the formal difference, what's called the formal difference of two elements of the semigroup. That means two projections. Okay? But the formal difference is two productions. And so with the projection here is e. Then upstairs you have f one plus f two and the class of f one. Okay? Zero class of f one minus the class of f two with map to the class of mapped to the class of e. Okay, and, but so something, so the class of e lifts to something.
00:31:40.304 - 00:33:06.038, Speaker A: Now suppose it lifted to its actual production. Suppose f two, if f two is zero, f two is zero, then f one, the class of f one by itself mapped into, into e. But then it's, I think a good exercise now to show that in the present setting where the quotient is an af algebra, the f one itself maps into a projection. So always the f one mapped into a production e prime, production homomorphic. And the, if it's an af algebra, then e prime is unitarily equivalent versus equivalent to be unitarily equivalent. Okay? And so you can, since unitaries do lift, you have a unitary in a af algebra, it always comes from the unitary in the algebra. Well yeah, that's always true.
00:33:06.038 - 00:34:10.884, Speaker A: Not always true. For project that we're using, the ideal is k one equals zero. Okay? But the, so the idea is to somehow get rid of the f two. Well, one way to get rid of it is to take it over to the other side somehow. If you, if you add the class of f two to both, both sides, you get the class of f one goes into the class of e plus the class of f two dot, okay? Which is the amulet of f two. Another prediction. By choosing different representatives, we can make sure that the f two dot is orthogonal to e.
00:34:10.884 - 00:35:31.084, Speaker A: But then the, that means that the e plus e plus something else and the can be lifted and something else can be lifted too. So you can, well, the strategy, the strategy, the final strategy of the proof is to show that if the e plus something else can be lifted and something else can be lifted, then the e can be lifted. You have to fiddle a bit through that. This is a interesting theorem. I'm not going into the proof right now because this could be an essay program, right, to look it up. It's, um, look it up and we're working, try to work it out without looking it up. But the, I'm just outlining it now in order to show how important the, for instance, even just for theory of af algebra, the, this bot periodicity is, how important it is.
00:35:31.084 - 00:36:22.628, Speaker A: So now the horizontal maps are come from functoriality and it turns out that the even index maps exists without seeming complex. Scalars. If it's, if it's real scalars, then any real Banach algebra. It's hard to define a real c strat, but a real Banach algebra is quite easy to define, and this works for manic algebra too. That's one reason people talk about idemposis a lot in algebra theory rather than production. That's because to prove bacteriodicity, at least the proof in the book doesn't prove it for algebra at all. Proves it for Banach algebra complex.
00:36:22.628 - 00:38:18.334, Speaker A: Banach algebra. Then you have to know that idempotent give you the same k zero group, and vertical elements give you the same k one group. Well, okay, but then the reason this having the six term exact sequence is considered to be equivalent to black periodicity is that the special case of it is, it is the case of black radiosphere that k, that is a natural isomorphism between k zero of the suspension and k one with a certain special extension, a certain special a and ideal quotient. Then you get the exactness here and here gives you that zero of the suspension of isomorphic one of the algebra in a natural way. But conversely, if you assume this is true, that taking suspension just flips k zero and k one, means also true that k one, it's not so deep, but it's interesting. K one of the suspension is isomorphic to k zero. Okay, but we're taking the suspension just flipped k zero and k one.
00:38:18.334 - 00:39:35.924, Speaker A: All right, suppose you look at this diagram without the even, without the odd index map as it Vikoni uses that the algebra is real. Manic algebra didn't use it to complex bionic algorithms. Well, the first row is k zero, and the second row is k zero is at the suspension. Well, the, roughly speaking, you just flip, just flip the diagram vertically, okay? And this arrow takes the even index map, goes into some map from the upper right to the lower left, which is exact here and here. And you just call it the odd index map. And you can calculate, you can calculate what it is somehow tantalizing construction of a map here. For in the case of a complex manic algebra, forget about assuming biocharides.
00:39:35.924 - 00:40:07.604, Speaker A: You can construct a map, okay? But you don't know. You get. Exactly. We have to prove that. That's what requires the bot periodistic. But it's in fact, you know, it's so easy to construct the map, I can't resist doing it right now. It shouldn't take long, but it definitely only makes sense for when you have complex numbers, complex skills.
00:40:07.604 - 00:40:57.700, Speaker A: And by the way, that Rishi suggestion to take unitaries is going to come in because, um, complex killers, complex bandic algebra or sea straight a self adjoint algebra. We can have a selfie joint element. Suppose you have a selfie joint element. This is triangle. Okay, well, then you take I times. So take I times. This alpha joint.
00:40:57.700 - 00:41:48.344, Speaker A: Okay, we're definitely using complex theorem. And now you exponentiate. Everyone know how to exponentiate. Everyone who talks about exponential growth, you think they know how to exponentially? Well, sometimes you can do it without thinking. In fact, just about everything is exponential growth or decay. Exponential growth or decay. So one good example of that is radioactive chemicals, radioactive substances, they will.
00:41:48.344 - 00:42:10.508, Speaker A: The amount of substance left will decay in time. And if it's extremely radioactive, then it's very, very dangerous. But it will. Tomorrow it'll be gone. People don't know that. They just think it. Think of it as being very dangerous.
00:42:10.508 - 00:42:36.844, Speaker A: Or on the other hand, if it's. If it's something. Some radioactive substances last for an extremely long time. Well, that means they're not. They're hardly. Barely radioactive, right? So it seems to me that most people, even though exponential growth and decay are the most common things, I don't think they are taught in school. So how do.
00:42:36.844 - 00:43:19.626, Speaker A: How many people know how to exponentially? In a banach algebra. Okay. Arthropava. You do it with a power survey. Okay? And it's the same. It's the same coefficients as for ordinary numbers and real or complex numbers, and always it diverges, right. If the algebra is complete, when you get a coefficient because of the algebra norm inequality, so the norm of the nth power is less than equal to the nth power of the norm.
00:43:19.626 - 00:44:04.300, Speaker A: And so if the norm is. But then, of course, the norm may be bigger than one, but you're dividing by something which is much, much larger. They're always converging. Okay, now, if you look at the exponential of I times h, it belongs to the c. Shalom. Okay, well, bait yourself a joint, then. What's going to be special about this element? Just attend.
00:44:04.300 - 00:44:38.478, Speaker A: Attend me. Sorry. Okay, that's going to be true if h is a production. And so you're saying that each of the ih will be the unit element? Is that what you're saying? I couldn't quite hear. Oh, well, that's true. Yes, that's true. And it'll be normal because h is normal, and its inverse will have.
00:44:38.478 - 00:45:25.364, Speaker A: It'll be invertible because it's an exponential, and the inverse will also have norm one. Well, a normal element without a property is what is called what? Charlie, were you about to. Can you answer that question? No, no. Let me just redirect you your willingness to answer. So you have a normal element of a sea square algorithm, a normal operator in a Hilbert space that has norm one and convertible, that inverse has norm one. Then what can you say about it, Vincent? Well, the spectrum is on the circle. Okay? But.
00:45:25.364 - 00:45:57.624, Speaker A: Yes. Well, are you saying unitary? Yeah. Okay. Yes, that's exactly right. Okay. If it's a normal matrix, for instance, or a complex number, complex number, which spectral theorem allows you to reduce to the case of the complex number, complex number, its norm is at most one, say, and its inverse is norm, has norm at most one. Well, then its.
00:45:57.624 - 00:46:27.776, Speaker A: It sits on the circle, right? Yeah, that's called unit variable. All right, well, but then Rishi was talking about unit variance of all that gives you something in k one, right? That's what we're looking for. And it's. By the way, it's in a. But k one, we want k one is the ideal. Okay, but that means that it should essentially be in the ideal. Okay.
00:46:27.776 - 00:47:19.204, Speaker A: We want it to be in the. We want it to be, actually, we want it to be in the ideal with the unit to join. Okay, the ideal with unit to join. Where assuming that the, assuming that the algebra has a unit, you define the exponential. The first term in the power series is the unit right to one. But then this is equal to the kernel of the map from a to a over I. Plus, at least I itself is.
00:47:19.204 - 00:47:52.568, Speaker A: So what I want to do, I want to show what happens if I map, if I map this to a over I. It's an a. What happens? I map it to a over I? Well, h goes into. Oh, okay. So I'm not talking about an arbitrary self adjoint element. I'm talking about a projection. Okay, I want a map from k zero of the quotient to k one of the ideal.
00:47:52.568 - 00:49:08.404, Speaker A: So I start with some projection in a over I, and then we don't know. A projection lifts to a projection, but it certainly lifts to a self adjointed element, because you lift it to something. You lift it, take the projection, lift it to something, and then add it, add to, take the average of that with its adjoint, and that will map the sulfur joint and will map into the production. So any projection has a self adjoint lifting. But now, if h that goes into I times e, right? I guess I want two PI I times hi, two PI I every day. Well, now, if, um, I mean, that won't affect whether it's unitary or not, but then if h two, if two PI, h goes into two PI I times z, then, then the exponential will go to the exponential, right. And what's the exponential of two PI I times e, what's the exponential? Forget about the case.
00:49:08.404 - 00:49:37.060, Speaker A: What if e is zero, what's the. So e is a production. E squared equals e, star equals zero. Okay? And so I want to know what the exponential of two PI I times e is. Well, follow professor eject. Okay, well, that's too long an answer. You should always look at a special case.
00:49:37.060 - 00:50:14.404, Speaker A: Archipelago itself. Yeah. Yes. I don't know. I'm not quite sure what you were going to say, but Jack is saying that you have a projection in a strange algebra with units, and you need the unit to define the exponential. Right? Then the exponential of two PI I times the projection. It doesn't matter what the projection is.
00:50:14.404 - 00:50:44.664, Speaker A: It's zero, or one, or the identity in two by two matrices. Well, in that case, you'll get the. You won't get one in the original algebra. You get one in the two by two matrices. Well, if it's exponential with respect to the two algebra, two by two matrix, that's slightly more complicated. But if it's just an algebra with unit, then any item, any. It's even true for item poles doesn't have to be self adjoint.
00:50:44.664 - 00:51:08.506, Speaker A: The exponential of two PI I times any item pole. There's a good exercise. Okay. Okay, well, that's true, but. But I don't know how well known it is that it's actually equal to one for an item pokemon. Maybe you have to think of it. Okay, I know how to do it.
00:51:08.506 - 00:51:26.490, Speaker A: Well, at some point, I distinctly recall I knew how to do it. Okay. If someone. People's curiosity becomes overwhelming, then I can figure out again how to do it. For self adjoint. For self. A joint item.
00:51:26.490 - 00:51:56.744, Speaker A: It's a piece of cake. I mean, the spectral theorem comes in, and it's a normal element, and the spectrum is to do the spectrum, you just work with complex numbers. You have any complex numbers that are item potent are zero and one. Right. You just have to check two cases. Oh, okay. All right.
00:51:56.744 - 00:52:51.144, Speaker A: How are we doing? I guess I'm promising a lot of things, but we'll have to see how that goes. And any of any questions, if there's an exercise that you want to do. Yes, no question. But what exercise are you working on? You should always be working on an exercise. Okay, so what exercise are you working on? Sorry. And what does it say? Oh, okay. All right.
00:52:51.144 - 00:53:47.144, Speaker A: I mean, it's linear algebra. Okay, well, that's if we're working with the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Be careful you don't assume that dimension has added. Right. The dimension of a direct sum is the direct sum of the dimensions you have to prove that, define dimension maybe as what I would call fake dimensions, sort things that would make it simpler, make it clearer what's happening. You just take the number of elements in the basis, smallest possible number of elements in the basis, and that's a particular number. And then you have the direct sum of two vector spaces, you have, the union of two bases would be a basis.
00:53:47.144 - 00:55:03.514, Speaker A: So the fake dimension will be at most the sum of these two fake dimensions if you have to prove it's equal. And that's, that might be what the exercise is not true, but that's a good exercise. How do you prove that? Well, you can prove the first principle, but one idea was we'd improve it from the fact that k zero of the field is zen. Okay, so that's a good exercise. And maybe the easier one is to prove is to prove it using that the Murray von Neumann semigroup, if you look at some, say, finitely generated vector spaces, isomorphism crosses up to addition. Okay, I assume that that's, those things are labeled by natural numbers starting with zero, and use that to prove that fake dimension is, that gives you a map into the semigroup. And so exaggerated.
00:55:03.514 - 00:55:41.632, Speaker A: But that's very good exercise, I would say. And then there's a bonus. It's like riding a bicycle. You're eight years old. Look, my, no hands. Okay, you just look at the generated group, you forget about the semi group, and you assume that the group is said. And can you still prove that the fake dimension is added, or can you prove that the semi group is z plus? Okay, but that's how you pick out, that's how you get going on an exercise, I would say.
00:55:41.632 - 00:56:13.074, Speaker A: Now, it's not, maybe not quite fair, because I've been thinking about these things for a long time, right? But sometimes I think of other things too. May not believe it. Okay, so, but like, but dimension is very important for case theory and for classification. For instance, the classifier is recognized. Okay. Anyway, if someone wants to talk afterwards, that's fine.
