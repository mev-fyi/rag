00:00:01.640 - 00:00:46.434, Speaker A: Okay, welcome everybody. Good morning, afternoon or evening, depending on where you are. And let us continue with discussing semi martingales and Martingale Hardy space. So let me first remind you what happened at the end of last lecture. We defined Sammy Martingales. This would be the processes with respect which we would be able to integrate things. So this would be sums of continuous martingales or local martingales rather, and processes of bounded variation, and then Martingale hard space.
00:00:46.434 - 00:02:13.470, Speaker A: Again, we only define h two because that's what would be needed for introducing stochastic integration later today. So h two is a space of continuous martingales for which l two norm is finite. So supremum of expectation of mt squared is finite. And by Martingale conjurgence area you can always find an l two function, function l two of f infinity of sigma algebra generated by all the fts, such that your process at time t is just conditional expectation of the process at infinity conditioned on time ft. And again by the same Martin Gale convergence theorem, expectation of m infinity is just limit of the expectations or supreme of the expectation of ft squared. Now this h two is a closed subspace of l two of f infinity, which we treat here as space of martingales, which are not necessary continuous. So what do I mean by this? You just take a function from alto and you can take additional expectation with respect to ft.
00:02:13.470 - 00:02:58.954, Speaker A: Then you create a martingale, maybe with this continuous trajectories, but it's uniformly integrable martingale of course. And as we discussed last time, our hard space is a close up space of this l two space. So this is again should be very reminiscent to what happens with analytic card spaces. Now let us consider yet another close subspace of this. These are the martingales from Hardy space, which start from zero. Remember, m zero is a random variable, so it's not necessary constant. But we consider only the ones here, h zero two.
00:02:58.954 - 00:03:26.774, Speaker A: This would be martingales, which start with being totally zero. It's a closed subspace. So these two spaces will play crucial role in defining integration. So this is the right abstraction. So they're not bounded martingales. There are more than that, but they are less than martingales. So they, well, they are less than bounded martingales, more than martingales.
00:03:26.774 - 00:03:56.574, Speaker A: Now the next theorem is, is very important for applications. That's how you can prove that a local martingale is a Martingale. Let me start with the following four that MTB continuous local Martingale. And we want to know when it belongs to h two. It's actually, it should satisfy two conditions. First, m zero should belong to l two. So expectation of m zero squared should be finite.
00:03:56.574 - 00:04:40.374, Speaker A: And second, this is very important that when you take the quadratic variation of it, remember, every martingale has a quadratic variation. But when you have a quadratic variation, you. Well, it has limited infinity, which can be infinite, of course. Remember, it's increasing functionality for each omega. So it has limited infinity. And I claim that for guys from h two, expectation of this quadratic variation up to infinity should be finite. And this is, again, if and only if condition.
00:04:40.374 - 00:05:20.644, Speaker A: Okay, so again, why is it useful? Because, as you will see, eta calculus would readily produce for us local martingales. But we will, to derive meaningful conclusions, we'll need to show that these are really martingales. Great. If you consider they abound. But if they are not here, what helps you this variation? The moment you see that it's finite, your local martingale is actually martingale. More than that, it's h two martingale. Okay, so let's prove it.
00:05:20.644 - 00:06:17.204, Speaker A: Let's start with this implication that Hardy martingale is actually satisfies these two conditions. Well, first condition is kind of trivial. That expectation of m zero squared, its expectation of conditional expectation of f imp zero squared, and then expectation by standard young inequality, it's bounded by expectation from infinity squared, which by definition is less than infinity. Again, we assume that we in h two, oh, well, you could just see that mt's expectation from t squared is increasing function. So this is a trivial assumption. This is, the next one is less trivial. So since we assume that it's a local Marsingale, let's create a collection of stopping times which make it into a bounded martingale.
00:06:17.204 - 00:07:17.668, Speaker A: So if you stop at this time tn, then your martingale becomes bounded martingale. Remember, that's the definition of local martingale. You can find the collection of the stopping times. Okay, so now what is expectation of m infinity squared? Of course, this is expectation of mtn squared, right? Because this is again, increasing function. Now let's rewrite it as e of m of tn squared minus mm at time tn plus expectation of mm at at time tn. So we're rewriting this as this plus this. Now, we know that this thing is a martingale, mtn Martingale.
00:07:17.668 - 00:08:01.708, Speaker A: M stopped at stop time. Tn is a bound at Martingale. So expect this martingale squared minus. And I'm missing the brackets here, looked at it and noticed that, yes, so this thing is bounded martingale. So it's expectation, just expectation of m naught squared. And now this thing is just, well, atm tends to infinity. So this thing is just expectation of mm, infinity.
00:08:01.708 - 00:09:00.152, Speaker A: So we get this formula that actually for h two martingale, expectation at infinity is expectation at zero plus expectation of the quadratic equation. Okay, so nothing exciting happened here. We just use the fact that this is a martingale and bounded Martin Luther. Okay, so, but this was an easy part. Now let's go for more interesting part, why conditions a and b imply that our exciting martingale is a square integral martingale. Okay, so what do we know? Let's look at this mean of TnT. They converge almost surely to mt.
00:09:00.152 - 00:09:36.624, Speaker A: The same with mt squared, expectation of positive function, or integral of positive function. We can use fatulam. That expectation of mt squared is bounded by expectation of this m stopped at time t. But by discussion here, this is a bounded martingale, right? M stopped at time t is a bounded martingale. So the previous formula, this formula is definitely true for it. Let's write it down. That would be our formula.
00:09:36.624 - 00:10:41.022, Speaker A: So let me write it more carefully here. So, expectation of m at the minimum of time t and t squared is simply expectation of m naught squared plus this exciting expectation of quadratic equation stopped at time t. And now let's take the limits of both. Well, this doesn't change. And this is an increasing function which happily tends to this. And, well, of course, by this, another Miss print here, I mean t. Okay, so this expectation is bounded by this and.
00:10:41.022 - 00:11:49.714, Speaker A: Okay, and let me continue this inequality. So this is actually equal to this, which in turn, in turn is bounded by expectation of m naught squared plus. Now we can take expectation of this mm net infinity, and this is it. Okay, so we proved our serum, because again, it's just fatula after all. Okay, so now let's move on from this. Let me make the following remark. When m is in hard space, and you just want to look at the supremum of mt squared minus mmt.
00:11:49.714 - 00:12:23.644, Speaker A: Well, what is it? Well, this is bounded by maximal function, right? Mt is bounded by maximal function. And remember, for h two martingales, maximal functions are actually nice. So it's actually l two function. And this is bounded by maximum function square. This is bounded by mm infinity. So this belongs to l one, because again, maximum function belongs to l two. This belongs to l one.
00:12:23.644 - 00:13:08.684, Speaker A: By our theorem. So we see that actually this guy is dominated by a function from l one. So this is actually uniformly integral martingale. So it's not just a martingale, it's a martingale which is uniformly integral. Okay, so again, we know that m itself is uniformly integral. What is non trivial here? Well, semi non trivial, is that the new Martin gal also becomes uniformly integral. So in particular, it's expectation of m infinity squared minus mm infinity conditioned to time t.
00:13:08.684 - 00:14:18.014, Speaker A: Now, another remark. Well, we'll use brownian motion a lot, and brownian motion definitely is not in h two, because, you know, that expectation of Bt squared is t. It's not bounded. But on the other hand, if you stop at time t, then this expectation at infinity of stopped brownian motion is just equal to t. It is just equal to the stopping time. So by our exciting theorem, stopped brownian motion is h two Martin gal if and only if expectations of the stopping time is finite. But again, the way we will use it will actually be illustrated by a technical lemma, which I will prove next, which shows that under certain conditions, a local martingale is the Martingale.
00:14:18.014 - 00:15:38.974, Speaker A: And I would not prove that this local Martingale is an h two martingale. That's simply not correct. But you will see in a moment how I will use this theorem and how I will use relation to hard space to prove that something is just a martingale. And this actually will be used in the proof that brownian revolution is almost surely generated by countries. Okay, so let's start with the local martingale XT with continuous trajectories. And let us assume that the following very technical looking condition holds. So, suppose that for every tau, tau is time, there exists c of tau such that quadratic variation of your martingale up to time t is bounded by the c of tau times integral from zero to t x squared plus one ds for every t less or equal.
00:15:38.974 - 00:16:24.224, Speaker A: So I'm not assuming that this happens globally. That would be wrong. But I'm assuming that up to any given time, your quadratic variation, it's not bounded. I'm not saying that it's bounded the moment, I would say it's bounded. Well, we would be easily, would be able to easily use our theorem to say that up to time tau, you have a martin. No, I'm saying less that it's just bounded by the integral of x squared. And the claim is that under this relatively weak condition, xxt is still a martingale.
00:16:24.224 - 00:17:08.044, Speaker A: Okay, so let me explain again. What's the meaning of this? So you started with local martingale. So you, for example, you don't know that expectation of x t is the same as expectation of x zero. But knowing this, you know that x t is a Marcy. Also, for example, expectation of xt is x zero. Okay, so the proof is the following. It will be very reminiscent actually of the proof of the theorem.
00:17:08.044 - 00:17:42.424, Speaker A: So x t is a local marsingale. So let's stop it at time tm. So we fix a large number m, which will later go to infinity. And tm would be the first time that this xt hits m. And then the stopped martingale x, which you run up to time tm and tm and then stop. It's bounded martingale is bounded by M. Okay, so nothing exciting happens here.
00:17:42.424 - 00:18:41.040, Speaker A: Okay, now let's look at f, by which we denote just yy at time t. So this y t, it's x, which is stopped at time tm. So this is xxt stopped at time tm. And since this is a bounded martingale, this expectation of y t and which y t squared rather, and this is the same as expectation of xt stopped at time tm squared. Okay, so far everything is easy because this is just this stopped thing. This is a martingale. It's bounded, bounded local martingale.
00:18:41.040 - 00:19:26.164, Speaker A: Remember, it's Martin. So now what do we have by our assumption? Let's take the expectations of both sides of this, but now stop at the time tm. So on left hand side, you have f expectation of this. Top t is f of t. Expectation of this, on the other hand, is. Well, you first integrate this c of tau times t plus. Okay, and I'm missing c of tau here, still missing c of tau there.
00:19:26.164 - 00:19:54.574, Speaker A: Good. Plus c of tau times f of s. Because when you take expectation, the usual for be anything, so expectation of the integral is integral of the expectation. So this integral from zero to t f of sds. So this is standard thinking odds. Now you have function which is bounded by its integral, so it has a bounded growth. But let's be very careful here.
00:19:54.574 - 00:20:39.914, Speaker A: Let t not be the first time. You are above this exponentially of tau t. And then you see that f of t naught is bounded by c of tau t plus. Well, up to this moment, you are less than this. So this is e to the two c of tau t. You just integrate, and then you multiply by this, it cancels with this. So e to the c of tau t minus one over two.
00:20:39.914 - 00:21:37.244, Speaker A: Then you plug in t naught equal to tau, and you notice, oops, if t naught is less or equal than tau, you get that f of t naught is actually less than this. Because if t naught is less than tau, you plug in tau here, and this is definitely less than this. So this is a contradiction which means that for every t less or equal tau, f of t is bounded by e to the two c of tau t. Okay, so you would say, so what? It's not yet exciting because this is just horrible. Bound. But it's enough because let's remember what f of t was. That was expectation of x t stopped at the time tm.
00:21:37.244 - 00:22:22.956, Speaker A: It's bounded by this. And now we can let m go to infinity. We get that for any t less or equal than tau, since this converges to this expectation of quadratic variation of x, up to time, t is bounded by this. Okay, so now what do we know? This bound doesn't hold fault t. It holds only for t, which are less or equal than certain tau. Aha. So x t stopped at this value.
00:22:22.956 - 00:23:14.492, Speaker A: This is now not a stopping time. It is just deterministic time tau. This is an h two Martingale. So we know that for every tau, if s is smaller than t and less than tau, then expectation of xt with respect to fs is equal to f. You see, there is nothing stopped here xt. Okay, so let me just make this remark that x thet tau is x t and excess tau is just excess if s less than equals and t less equals tau. So you have this for any tau.
00:23:14.492 - 00:23:56.718, Speaker A: If you take any two numbers which are less than tau, then they satisfy Martingale property. So this is true for any two numbers because you can always find the number which is bigger than both of them. So xt itself, it is a martingale. So again, this is how such proofs price it. You need to establish that up to certain deterministic type. Stop. Your local martingale actually has finite quadratic variation, bounded quadratic variation.
00:23:56.718 - 00:24:26.854, Speaker A: Again, our theorem tells us that it's enough to have a one quadratic variation. But in practice, very often you can, like here, you can establish that it's just bounded. It is bounded. Fantastic. So by our theory, our local Martingale is actually Martingale up to this time now. And since it's true for every town, our Martingale, our local Martingale is in fact Martingale. So we can deal with it.
00:24:26.854 - 00:25:33.854, Speaker A: Okay, so with this technical lemma out of the way, let me finally go to Ita Calculus, invented by Kyoshito, a japanese mathematician. And so let me rigorously introduce the stochastic calculus. So I kept saying that everything that we did up to this point was just a preparation of this to this. And you will see why we need local martingales here and things like that. Okay, so let's start with a definition. Let us look at Martingale from hard space. Again, Martingale trajectory is continuous.
00:25:33.854 - 00:26:17.382, Speaker A: Expectation of Mt squared is uniformly bounded. And now let's look at all key, progressively measurable processes. So what is progressively measurable? Remember, kt up to time t, it's f t measurable. The process up to time t measurable with respect to ft. And so we look at all such processes for which the following norm l two norm with respect to m is finite. So this is key moment. We still don't know how to integrate with respect to M.
00:26:17.382 - 00:27:11.134, Speaker A: We want to introduce it, but we know very well how to integrate with respect to quadratic variation of M. Quadratic variation of M is a nice increasing process. So you can very easily write this integral. So this integral of the square of k with respect to quadratic variation and to integrate from zero to infinity. Now remember that this by itself it's random, so it's increasing function, but it's a random increasing function. So now you take expectation of this and this, is this what you want to be finite. So, okay, again, let me repeat this.
00:27:11.134 - 00:28:39.384, Speaker A: L two of m square integral with respect to Martingale M. This are progressively measurable processes, or essentially any process for which this integral would make sense in integral for which expectation of integral of the squared with respect to your quadratic variation is finite. Now this is just, it's very easy to see that this is just l two space with respect to the following measure on real line, cross your probability space. So if you have a space a set here, so this is set of times and randomness, then the measure of this a would be expected value of this. So you integrate characteristic function of a, you first integrated with respect to quadratic variation with respect to s. And then you take expectation with respect to one. So that would be your exciting probability space.
00:28:39.384 - 00:29:01.694, Speaker A: This would be your exciting probability measure. Sorry. And this space k is l two with respect to this. So all this, I don't have to reprove properties of l two, but of course, don't think about l two or m in this terms. This is bad. So this is the right way to think about it. It.
00:29:01.694 - 00:29:40.124, Speaker A: Okay. And now what will happen next is the integral. First, it won't look like integral at all. First is just abstract thing you get from some soft target. Let me be now very specific. Let us take m in h two and k, which is square integrable with respect to m. So all we know is that this is true.
00:29:40.124 - 00:30:43.714, Speaker A: Then I claim that you can find unique process k dot m. It's not times, it's not multiplication, it's k m, which is hard space, but it starts at zero. So h naught squared, such as the following is true for any other martingale n, which is square integrable. If you take quadratic variation of this process, and then so quadratic correlation rather, which you get by polarization, so quadratic correlation of this new process. And then this is the same as k dot quadratic correlation of m and n itself. So let's remember what we denoted by this. This was the integral of k with respect to mn.
00:30:43.714 - 00:32:00.094, Speaker A: So this is kind of a duality definition. This process is such that when you correlate it with any other process, but, right, correlate with any other nice process, then you get integral of k with respect to the correlation. And another statement is that this map from k to k, it's an isometry from l two of m into space, into card space, all started at zero. So l two norm of this guy is actually the same as this construct. So that's the state. Okay, so this way of introducing things should be very familiar. This is how we usually introduce integrals in Banach spaces, weak integrals by duality.
00:32:00.094 - 00:32:31.704, Speaker A: So this is exactly the same. Thank you. Luckily, as we will see a bit later today, there is much, much more intuitive way to look at it. So there will be essentially this k m, as I said, k m at time t. This martingale at time t would be denoted by integral from zero to t. Here, first DM's. So this is just annotation.
00:32:31.704 - 00:33:33.874, Speaker A: So this is e to integral. And again, it's defined by this property. So let's decipher this. So integral from zero to t ks Dm's, if you correlate it with nt, this is all at time t. This should be equal to integral from zero to TKSDM and s. So I just rewrote this in more integrable terms, if you wish. Okay, so just the integral is defined by duality that you can kind of interchange taking the brackets and taking the integral.
00:33:33.874 - 00:35:05.185, Speaker A: Okay, first, of course, we need to prove that it exists and then we will start generalizing it and eventually we arrive to the fact that it's, you can actually integrate not only with respect to h, two martingales, because that's what happens here, but with respect to any semi martingale so, a sum of local martingale and process of bounded variation. Okay, let's start with uniqueness. Suppose that you found two such guys, l and l prime, which are in hard space and satisfies this condition that ln and l n is just integral kdmn for every n and h two. Well, this identity then holds for any such martingale in h two, including l minus l prime. So, in particular, l minus l prime. L minus l prime is zero. And let me actually write that it's an infinity.
00:35:05.185 - 00:36:16.746, Speaker A: And let me add one more step here. This means that expectation of L minus l prime, infinity squared is equal to expectation of L minus l prime at zero squared plus expectation of L minus l prime. At infinity, we had this identity. This is equal to zero because they are both in h naught, zero, h to zero, and this is equal to zero by what we just established. So this implies that l is equal to l prime. Almost surely, expectation of l minus l prime squared is equal to zero. So this implies that l minus l prime is actually equal to zero.
00:36:16.746 - 00:37:02.906, Speaker A: And we showed the easy part. We showed uniqueness. Now, of course, we need existence. And for this, we start with assuming that m itself is h naught. Let me try to convince you before I start writing the proof, let me try to convince you that this is actually not a restrictive condition. So, when you integrate something, do you care what the value of this is at zero? No. When you integrate with respect to something, when you do, even still, cs integration with respect to something, all matters for you.
00:37:02.906 - 00:37:42.240, Speaker A: All what matters for you is how fast it grows. So, if you subtract a constant from your object, you get the same integral. So this is actually not very restrictive. If you subtract a constant from m, m naught, which we will do well, it's a random constant, but who cares? The integral shouldn't change. So it's very important to first define this for the integral with respect to guys which start at zero, and then we'll continue. Okay. Then we also take n.
00:37:42.240 - 00:38:42.152, Speaker A: To be started at zero, again shouldn't matter, because n is also something with respect to which we integrate. But again, strictly speaking, we start m at zero, we start n at zero. And now, remember, I told you that quantitative attanabi inequality would play a crucial role. It would happen right here. So you take expectation of this guy. So k dot mn infinity, which is by definition, integral from zero to infinity, k with respect to mn with respect to quadratic relation. And now you use kunito botanabi.
00:38:42.152 - 00:40:04.494, Speaker A: So let me remind you what kunito botanibi is, we'll use this h two version of this. That expectation of the integral with respect to quadratic correlation is bounded by the integral of the first guy squared with respect to quadratic variation, integral of the second guys with respect to quadratic variation. And so here we use it with k times one. So we have something like one squared, which will disappear. So this just leaves you integral of one dnn and t from zero to infinity, which is just nn infinity. But so actually add extra things here. So this things think is equal to nn infinity, right? It's just the integral of Dnn, which is equal to expectation of n infinity squared, because again of the theorem that we had.
00:40:04.494 - 00:41:23.434, Speaker A: And here we again use the fact that nothing happens at zero. So this is one half of this, one half power of this. It's just normal for n in h two norm of n squared power, one half normal fan nh two. And this is by the definition of k in l two of n. So what did we just proved? We just proved that this map from n to the expectation of this integral is continuous map on the hard space, and the norm of it is bounded by this. So what does it mean? Well, it's Hilbert space. In Hilbert space, you have a continuous functional, this end to the expectation.
00:41:23.434 - 00:43:00.174, Speaker A: So it means that you can find another element, fixed element of this h zero two, such that for every n in h two, expectation of l infinity times n infinity is the same as this expectation, right? Because every functional on Hilbert space is a scalar product with some element of this Hilbert space. And this is your sum element. And this is, remember, this is, let me add a comment here that this is equal to l and in the space h two. So this is just color products within the space h two. And the reason why I didn't write it, because it's very confusing, of course, here, and here, this is scalar product within h two. This is just quadratic variation, quadratic relation. Okay, so let's prove that this l is actually satisfies all the properties so that this l satisfies this property that l n is this thing for any and in h two.
00:43:00.174 - 00:44:18.818, Speaker A: Okay, so for this, the usual thing, we fix the stocking time. So this is now, first compute expectation of Lc and t. This is of course, conditional expectation of l infinity with respect to nt times nt. This is expectation of l infinity times nt, right? Because by definition, if you take expectation of two t related things that should be ft measurable things that should be the same as expectation of this guy times the original guy. So this is expectation of all infinity times 20. And now remember, we had this exciting property that first your guy nt belong to h naught squared. Of course, your n was already an h zero.
00:44:18.818 - 00:44:55.954, Speaker A: You stopped at time t, didn't stop in h zero. So by our defining property, this is our defining property. This is the same as expectation of k, m and t. So this is, remember, dot, this is integral. Let's be probabilistic and not write the integral. And so this guy is the same as mn stopped at time t. Remember that if you stop one of the guys and take quadratic correlation, the same as to stop the whole quadratic correlation at time t.
00:44:55.954 - 00:45:18.436, Speaker A: We had this property before. And so this is just expectation of k. Let me write it more carefully. So there is a dot here. This is not a product. So this is integral. So this expectation, let me actually write one more thing here.
00:45:18.436 - 00:46:29.322, Speaker A: This expectation of the, from zero to time t ks, dmn. Again, why are we doing this? Initially, the way we defined everything, all we knew is that in infinity, l produces the right result. Now we want to say that it produces the right results at time t. Okay, so what do we see? We see that expectation of this is equal to the expectation of this. So what does it mean? It means that Lt and t minus kt dot mnt. It's a martingale, right? Because if you take this process, you stop it at any stopping time. And you know that the expectation, look at this.
00:46:29.322 - 00:47:27.524, Speaker A: This minus this, the expectation, well, this minus this, the expectation of this would be zero. That's exactly as we saw, one of the defining properties of the Martin gates. So this is Martingale. But what does it mean? It means that this is a bounded oscillation process, bounded variation process, such that when you subtract it from LC and t, you get a martingale. There is only one such thing, and this is the quadratic relation LNT. That was the definition of quadratic relation of the process. Remember, this is something that you can subtract from the product and get a martingale.
00:47:27.524 - 00:48:00.916, Speaker A: So here we are. And so now let's untangle it. Let's take l to be this, to be this k dot m to be this integral. Plug it in here. That's exactly the identity that we are trying for. This is equal to this. Okay.
00:48:00.916 - 00:48:47.194, Speaker A: Unfortunately, this is proven so far under two conditions, that m is in h zero two and n is in h zero two. Let's remove them. That would be easier. So let's look at the general n in h two, then you can represent it as until the plus n not where by definition until this n minus n zero. This is the guy in h zero. Then it doesn't affect the quadratic variation at all. Remember, quadratic variation is the sum of increments.
00:48:47.194 - 00:49:32.830, Speaker A: Doesn't matter where you started. So for n and for n tilde, this is the same. And of course for l is the same. So this identity still holds because it was true for until, if you replace m with until the and then tilde would judge this ipa because it doesn't affect anything. And finally, if m is an arbitrary guy in hard space we again represented as m naught plus m tilde by m tilde. Is this difference again national tilde. And again the same thing.
00:49:32.830 - 00:50:11.064, Speaker A: Command t is until then t. And so if you take km to be the same as km tilde, remember the integral should not depend on the value zero. So we just define it to be this. You just check all sedans as they still hold. Okay, so we are almost done with the theorem. Let us take a ten minute break now and we'll continue with proving that this map is actually isometric. Okay, I'll see you all in ten minutes.
