00:00:05.160 - 00:00:53.402, Speaker A: Okay. And as I mentioned before, the break adet proved that if you have a good random curve. Well, I conjectured scaling limit. This is supposed to be this Slica, but is sle cap I curve. That was a non trivial question. And there was an else paper where it was answered, and the joint theorem of Stefan Rode and Todd Schramm, which says that Sle Kappa is indeed a curve. And for Kappa between zero and four, well, actually including zero.
00:00:53.402 - 00:01:19.342, Speaker A: But for zero, it's, as you will see, it's just straight line. It's not interesting. It's a simple curve. So, meaning that it doesn't have any self intersections. For Kappa, strictly between four and eight, it's self touching curve. It's exactly the curve that we discussed, which is allowed to touch itself. So it's like this.
00:01:19.342 - 00:01:48.398, Speaker A: So for copper between zero and four, it's simple curve. Between four and eight, it's self touching. And finally, for copper, bigger equals than eight, it's space filling. So, this was my caricatures. But these are actual simulations. This, I believe, is Kappa equal two, copper equals six and kappa equal eight. As you can see, for copper equal eight, it's not a good simulation because, well, you don't really see space filling.
00:01:48.398 - 00:02:38.658, Speaker A: And it's very difficult to represent space filling by simulations. There is a twist in this area. It works. The proof, at least that they had, works for all kappa, which are not equal to height. For copper, equal to height, it's also known, but the only reason we know it now, it's because this uniform spinning tree converges to accelerate. And you can show that the limit lives on the curves. So, every few years, there is a paper in the archive which claims to have a good proof of this, an analytic proof of this, without convergence, of uniform spanning three.
00:02:38.658 - 00:03:25.072, Speaker A: So far, all of them were wrong. But again, who knows? Maybe I didn't check the archive distribution in the morning. So maybe that was the correct paper in the morning. But as far as I know, the only proof relies on this scaling limit. Okay, so this, this ethereum kind of gives me to the definition of sla kappa. Now, how do people prove convergence? And here I will start hand waving as crazy. My apologies.
00:03:25.072 - 00:04:08.524, Speaker A: All of this would be rigorously defined later. So, usually it's done in a few steps. First, you want to imitate things which were done for brownian motion and random walk. You want to find one observable. So, instead of random curves, you should start talking about random points, random values, and this should be conformally invariant. So just this one. Then, in the second step, you establish some pre compactness in your family of curves.
00:04:08.524 - 00:04:48.660, Speaker A: So, what do I mean by that? Your random probab, your probability measure, lives on some curves. This occurs on the lightest, nice curves, usually not self intersecting, not self patching. But of course, when you go to the limit, the limit of measures, living column, simple curves could be living on, not simple curves. Well, on one hand, we saw that. It's okay. We can describe by l evolution, value creation, things which are not living on simple curves. But certain curves are still not describable.
00:04:48.660 - 00:05:12.224, Speaker A: Let me show you two examples. One is this. So this is a self touching curve, but you cannot describe it by law. The reason is the following. The moment curves goes inside itself. So it touches itself and then goes inside. You cannot see it.
00:05:12.224 - 00:05:58.024, Speaker A: Remember, we tried conformal math. We tried to unwrap things. So here you cannot see things inside this bubble. So you want to show that you wouldn't go inside. And the other thing which would kill you is that if curves doubles down on itself, it just goes along itself, so it just repeats itself. That is also killing you, because, again, you don't know what to unwrap. There is an axiomatic theory for this due to Campanyan and Smirnov and I will talk about it later, but usually it's done on model by model, model by model case.
00:05:58.024 - 00:07:22.924, Speaker A: And step three is that we use this observable to indeed prove that the driving function of the, of any subsequential limit is the brownian motion. And there is also axiomatic theory for this. So, essentially, model these two axiomatic series about which I will talk about, the thing which mostly remains, is step one, finding a non trivial observable which is conformally invariant. And the worst part is that we'll know lots of candidates for the subservables, but we cannot rigorously prove that they converge to the limits. So, again, as I promised, the problem is, this is very hand wavy, but I hope that this will all become clear at the end of the course. So again, I hope to describe this process in much more detail. Okay, so now let me talk about real course plan after this introduction.
00:07:22.924 - 00:08:26.214, Speaker A: And real course plan starts with the things which are the farthest away from the program. It starts with, essentially, combinatorics. So the problems which I will discuss comes from physics, and I will try to explain why they come from physics, but they are combinatorial in nature. And amazingly, to solve them, you will use not analytic functions, but sort of kind of discrete analytic functions. So this, hopefully, would be the first time you'll you'll see why I'm teaching it here, that there will be huge relation with methods of a series of analytic function spaces. And I will start with self avoiding work. This is something which I didn't discuss in the examples for good reason.
00:08:26.214 - 00:08:50.236, Speaker A: This is. We understand very little about it. Loop raised random walk was proposed to be a model for self avoiding work. Turns out that this is totally different. And actually we can now handle loop raised random walk. Self avoiding work is still out of reach, but we know the observable. So for this step one, we would know the observable.
00:08:50.236 - 00:09:27.064, Speaker A: Show it to you. It's a nice observable. We just cannot prove what we want to prove about it. But the problem is, well, not the problem. The good thing is that it helps us establish a new, purely combinatorial property of the self avoidance work, which was actually conjectured for for quite a long time. This is connectivity constant, and in a few minutes I will really define it. Then we'll talk about other models and their absorbables.
00:09:27.064 - 00:10:42.804, Speaker A: And so this would be our first introduction to step one. I will kind of rigorously describe at least convergence of absorbers without proofs mostly. But to give proofs and to move further, I will need a lot of background and there will completely shift gears. So for quite some time I will talk about conformal maps. I will just start with the basics with Kirby distortion theory, and finish with Ljovnir evolution and pomeranian case about what objects can be defined by Luovner evaluation. Then we'll switch gears completely again, because to discuss s in SLE will need iter calculus. And I would not assume that people who take this course would know a lot about data calculus.
00:10:42.804 - 00:11:35.514, Speaker A: So I will rigorously introduce it and give all the necessary background. And after this we would be able to talk about geometric properties of SLA. So this I plan to prove rodesham theorem, for example, and maybe move a bit further. Then we'll talk about steps two and three. So, I will tell you how the convergence of critical interfaces work, the framework of this, and we'll discuss axiomatic framework of polynomial conversions. This would actually be relatively new stuff. My joint work with my former PhD student Larissa Richards.
00:11:35.514 - 00:12:28.548, Speaker A: And finally, I plan to talk about things which are the closest to the program, about gaussian free field, its relation to SLA, and actually its relation to spaces of analytic functions. Okay, so that's the plan. Any questions? Again, so far I was hand waving. So if you are looking at this and thinking, well, what is it all about? Hopefully, what would happen next will at least make it clear. So what I will be talking from now on is supposed to be rigorous. So if some things are not understandable, not rigorous, please interrupt me. I will be happy to talk about it.
00:12:28.548 - 00:13:16.514, Speaker A: Okay, so, lattice models, and let's talk about self. Self avoiding random book. So let me start with some background here. It was introduced by chemist Paul Fleury in 1949 to describe polymers. And really it's not. So the objects which we saw before, they kind of had their natural time. You run process and some time here, it's not really a process.
00:13:16.514 - 00:14:13.824, Speaker A: What it does is the following. You fix a lysis and our main example would be this honeycomb lattice. And actually our first theorem would be about this honeycomb latis in the plane. And we fix some vertex, let's call it a and consider all not self intersecting paths on the light, starting at a of the fixed lengthen and select one at random, uniformly at random. That would be your self avoiding random walk of lengthen. So no work actually happens. You just take all the curves which don't intersect itself on the slices or fixed lengthen.
00:14:13.824 - 00:15:10.554, Speaker A: And then you well look at them uniformly. The first question to ask is, well, how many of them? Let's denote the number of them by cn. And cn of course, would be lightest dependent. Of course, on square lattice you have one number. On hexagonal lattice you will have another number. But there is a prediction from physics, and this is due to nianhoes, whose picture you will see a bit later. Sorry, I forgot to put him here, that up to a constant, this cn is equal to mu to the n multiplied by n to 1132.
00:15:10.554 - 00:16:26.662, Speaker A: So you can really approximate it just by this simple expression where mu is light is dependent of course, and this is called the connectivity Constant for the lattice. And then another prediction is that you can really parameterize it. So, if you just take this random path of length n and parameterize it as t goes between zero and one, so omega. So you just parameterize your path, and then you define x of t to be the limit of this path rescaled by this power minus three quarters, then this limit exists. And actually what he didn't know in 1992, but what we can add now that this limit is sl eight thirds. This is still a conjecture. So notice that for comparison, if you just look at standard random walk, then brownian motion, you will see, can be defined as the limit of this n to the minus one half.
00:16:26.662 - 00:18:09.264, Speaker A: So, not three four like here, but one half multiplied by what you get up to the time and another prediction also from physics, is that the way to obtain this x of t, this conjectured limiting process from two dimensional brownian motion, it just takes out a boundary, right? The outer boundary of brownian motion. Well, if you cut it somewhere, if you say, run from the first point to the last point, that would be a simple curve, which is conjectured to be exactly this curve x of t. So when the two people who would be mentioned in the next area started working on self avoiding work, of course, their ambition was to prove at least some of these conjectures, they failed. But what they produced instead, they produced regression computation of this constant mu for hexagonal lattice, which was, it's a very elementary computation. I actually described it to high school students. And it's as you will see, it's really, really elementary. And the problem is really combinatorial, right? You are just looking at the rate of growth of the number of path node, self intersecting path of lengths.
00:18:09.264 - 00:19:29.944, Speaker A: And although again they failed so far, again, I don't know. As far as I know, both of them are still working on this viscosers. And maybe, just maybe, they already solved this. So the usual disclaimer as far as I know, but what they were able to prove using this conjectured observable, which is supposed to eventually help to prove all the physics predictions, is that the connectivity constant for hexagonal lattice is this square root of two plus square root of two. So you will see there is a trigonometric meaning to this, and that would be very important. And so this is Dominion Kapan and stasmr Nova again. So before I will show you their proof, which really illustrates actually the power of this absorbable.
00:19:29.944 - 00:21:11.824, Speaker A: Again, they couldn't quite show that this absorbable does what they want to do, but even the existence of this observable, which is quite amazing, gave them the connectivity constant. So, as a warm up, since, well, most of us are not mathematical physicists, let me try to show that mu is indeed that mu exists, that actually really see and grows like some power of mu model or some corrections. So let me start with the standard lemma, which says that if you have a sequence of non negative numbers which satisfy the sub additivity property am plus n is bounded by am plus am, then the existing limit of an over nature. And this is the same as in film of n over n. This is a standard, well, calculus lemma. So I will prove it here, but it's extremely useful both in mathematical physics and dynamical systems. So now let us observe that the number of curves of length n plus nice is bounded by the number of curves of length m multiplied by the number of curves of length m.
00:21:11.824 - 00:22:23.064, Speaker A: Right? Because to obtain the curve of length n plus n, you can just run the curve, cut it in n steps, and then what remains is a simple curve with n steps. And they together would determine this. So indeed, the number of them is bounded by what you do first, what you do second. Cn times cn. Okay, so this is standard submultiplicativity property, which again will happen in other objects in our core store. And now we apply the lemma to logarithm of cn and we get that the limit of one over n log cn's exists. And this is exactly logarithm of our nil.
00:22:23.064 - 00:23:26.248, Speaker A: So mu is the limit when n goes to infinity of nth root of mu of c n. Now again, to warm up, another observation is that mu is strictly positive because this limit could be zero. And that's, well, that's not good. So let me try to convince you that c four n is at least two to the n, because to obtain. So, I will produce at least two to the n paths of length for nice. How do I do this? I simply run a path. So I started here, and then I either go up or down.
00:23:26.248 - 00:23:59.904, Speaker A: And then again I go here, I either go up or down, run here, go up and down. So in four n steps, I would be able to make a choice of up or down n times. So hence two to the nice. So mu is indeed positive. But what is it again remained equation for a long time, although physicists of course knew it. Okay, predicted. Let me put the correct word here.
00:23:59.904 - 00:25:26.634, Speaker A: So how would you prove this? How would you show that the number of passes is about square root of two plus square root of t? What you consider is a partition function. So, it's a function of x. And these things will appear a lot in this course. And this is a very simple thing. You simply sum up x to the minus l curves gamma, which starts on a, and of course not self intersecting. So you look at all these polymers, which start at a and you sum them up as well, x to the minus. If you think about it for a second, this is the same when you group it together as sum of cn x to the minus n, because there are exactly cn curves of length n.
00:25:26.634 - 00:26:15.418, Speaker A: So you just sum it up when n is non bigger equals than one. And what is enough to prove? It's enough to prove that this z of x is bounded if and only if x is bigger than x c. Just root test you know, it's a power series. You want to know the rate of growth of c, of n, just enough to show. Then when x is bigger than x of c, you die, you reserve. Sorry. When x is bigger than x of c, the sum converges.
00:26:15.418 - 00:27:20.440, Speaker A: When x is less or equal than x of C, this sum is impeded. That's all. And that's what will be proven. Now, to really do this stuff, we need to talk about certain auxiliary lattices, hexagonal lattice. So let me spend some time talking about one of them. As you see, in this model and in other models, all our functions will be defined on edges of hexagonal lattice. Now there is another lattice, it's called medial lattice, with the following vertices of this new media lattice are edges of our original lattice, right.
00:27:20.440 - 00:28:08.364, Speaker A: We want to define our functional edges. So well it's natural to define it in vertices. So let's do vertices of medial lattice would be edges of the original lattice, and geometrically we put them right in the middle of each edge and we draw an edge between them if they share a vertex. So it's very interesting light, that's what we get. So medial lattice to hexagonal lattice is what is called kagomelitis. It consists of hexagons and triangles. Again, that would not be very important except for 1 cm.
00:28:08.364 - 00:29:26.900, Speaker A: Okay, and so this is, okay, so this is medial lattice. All our functions will be defined there. Now suppose that we have some curve gamma, which joins two edges a and b of vertices of medial lattice. And let's, we need to define very important object for this proof and for later discussions. It's called rotation of the curve. So what you do, you run your curve from a to b and you look at the rotation of tangent vector to the curve, the total rotation. So for example, for this curve gamma one from a to b, the total rotation would be.
00:29:26.900 - 00:30:28.978, Speaker A: So eventually it would rotate this way. So it's minus two PI for the red curve, for the blue curve, which goes the same way, but then it starts deviating here and it goes to the same b to the same hb, it's two PI and you rotate. But now you rotate in positive direction. And now just one observation. If gamma one is hematopic to gamma two inside omega, from which you removed a and b, so there is still no omega here. I'm, I promise to be rigorous here, but bear with me. So you have some domain, and in this domain you removed a and b and then you have curves, gamma one hematopic.
00:30:28.978 - 00:31:06.394, Speaker A: Then of course they would have the same rotation. Because rotation changes continuously when you change the curve. Well, at least if it remains this differentiable. And so it's an integer. So, well, two PI, multiple of integer. Rather, it's two PI multiple of integer. When a and b are like this, when they're in different phases, well, it's plus minus two, PI three.
00:31:06.394 - 00:32:00.170, Speaker A: And why am I doing this observation? Because, as you will see later, this would be very important for the rest. If you have two points in the boundary of omega, and you only consider curves inside of omega, then the rotation between them does not depend on what curve you took. Again, this is a very simple geometric observation, which is very easy to see, but just wanted to put it on a rigorous footing here. Okay, so that's just what the rotation is. Now, on hexagonal lattice, you can define rotation locally, recursively. Let's let me explain why. You look at your curve.
00:32:00.170 - 00:32:59.722, Speaker A: You started the vertex e naught, and you entered the vertex n, which is b, and then rotation from u naught to u naught is equal to zero. And then you define rotation from e naught to e k by induction. So, if from ek minus one to ek, you turn left, your rotation increased by PI over three, and if it turns right, it decreases by PI over three. That's all. So you, on hexagonal lattice, you define it recursively and, say, on square lattice, it's also easy. For example, if you go straight, your rotation doesn't change. If you turn left, it increases by PI over two.
00:32:59.722 - 00:34:14.134, Speaker A: If you turn right, it decreases by PI over two. And now, our main hero for today's lecture is this paraphernionic absorb. This is recorded, and I call this failed absorbable. My apologies to, again, to the authors of the serum, if they ever see it that, well, it's failed in the original quest. But of course, this observable, as you will see, would give us amazing things about the self avoiding clock. So, we now have some simply connected domain omega, and we have a point a on the boundary of omega and point z inside of omega. Now, when I say point, I mean edges or equivalently, vertices of medial lattice.
00:34:14.134 - 00:35:08.324, Speaker A: So, points in the middle of the edges of the hexagonal lattice, so the function will be defined on them. And this is para fermionic absorbable. It's defined. Well, it has four parameters, but three of them would be hidden. So we want it to be a function of z, but the parameters are the a, x, and then the sigma. So what you do, you do the following. You look at all the passes in omega, which are self avoiding and which go from a to z.
00:35:08.324 - 00:35:54.234, Speaker A: So you look at all of them, and then you do essentially what you would do for the partition function. Remember, we eventually want to show that the partition function converges, diverges for certain values of x. That's what you do here. You take the sum of all of them by of x to the minus l of gamma. But let's now make things interesting. First of all, you don't consider all the possible paths which start attacking. You consider only paths within this domain which go from a to z.
00:35:54.234 - 00:36:48.284, Speaker A: But then you do the following. You add a weight to the path, and the weight initially looks horrible. It's just this rotation multiplied by minus I sigma. But essentially what you do here, you introduce a face. So this was a real number, right? Instead of just looking at the real number, you introduce a face to this real number. And what I will try to convince you is that this function is kind of sort of analytic. So this function is analytic on the lattice in a very precise sense.
00:36:48.284 - 00:37:57.094, Speaker A: I will explain what it is. And this will be supposed to converge to some continuous object, to re to a normal analytic function. But this convergence is not known. But the very fact that this function is analytic would help us compute connectivity constantly. And so here comes the main lemma for this function. If you take very special value of sigma and very special value of x, our critical x, our supposed connectivity constant, square root of two plus square root of two, then for every vertex v inside omega, let's look at the picture. So you have vertex v, and then you have dual vertices p, q and r, which are adjusted to it.
00:37:57.094 - 00:38:49.674, Speaker A: So p, q and r are the vertices of medial lattice or edges. So you are not looking at other vertices of the lattice of the hexagonal lattice. P, q and r leave on medial lattice. And then, very simple thing. You take f of p, multiply it by p minus v, you take f of q, multiply it by q v, and you take f of r and multiply it by r minus v. This sums up to zero. So, as I will try to explain later, this is discrete cashierman equation, unfortunately, not all of it.
00:38:49.674 - 00:40:22.136, Speaker A: But again, so this is the relation that the values of our strange function f weighted partition function at three adjacent medial vertices satisfy this amazing property, not fall x, not fall sigma for this very special x and for this very special sigma. Okay, so the statement, now let me try to prove it. First of all, we consider all self avoiding curves from a that end either at p at q or at r, right? We don't need to consider any other curves, remember, to define f, we summed up all the curves which join a and z. So here we only it would be only going to pq and r. And let C of gamma be the contribution of gamma to this sum. So each curve is, it ends at exactly one point. It's either at p at q or at r.
00:40:22.136 - 00:40:56.624, Speaker A: Each curve that we consider. So it contributes to one of the summits. And let C of gamma be this contribution. So it's not just f of p, or f of q of f of f. It just this contribution multiplied by corresponding factor. And let us consider two cases. So what would happen next, we will cleverly group gammas.
00:40:56.624 - 00:41:40.584, Speaker A: First, we look at gammas which pass through p, q and r, all of three of them. And second, we will consider all of the gamma. So let's look at case one first. So what do I mean by this? The curve will go like this. So it goes from, say, nth root, p goes through q and then ends up at r. So this gamma terminates at v. Again, it's a curve joining edge to edge, but the last edge and heat three.
00:41:40.584 - 00:42:20.484, Speaker A: And for this things we can pair such curves. So suppose that our curve. Well, again, there are some cases here, but everything is symmetric that suppose that our curves starts first at v through p. It could be through q or r. But suppose that it enters through p, and then if it enters through p, it goes like to the queue. And then it goes, goes, goes, and then it returns through r. Let's pair with the curve which does the opposite thing.
00:42:20.484 - 00:42:53.684, Speaker A: It goes on exactly the same trajectory, but in the opposite direction. So if gamma one goes pq and then return. So gamma two would have exactly the same trajectory, but go pr and n q. And let's compare their contributions. So gamma one only contributes to f of r, gamma two only contributes to f of q. Again. And here and here.
00:42:53.684 - 00:43:52.904, Speaker A: And so here I just wrote down the relation and let us do the computation. Let us look at this thing. So, length of gamma one, of course, is equal to length of gamma two along the same trajectory, of course. Now, rotation of gamma one from a to r is the following. It's. Well, first you rotate from a to p, and then you rotate from p to r. And this is rotation from gamma one from a to p plus four, PI over three, similar for gamma two.
00:43:52.904 - 00:44:47.544, Speaker A: Again, you first rotate that gamma two from a to q, and then you rotate it from p to q from a. Sorry, this sprint a to p. So you first rotated from a to p and then rotate it from p to q. So this is rotation from a to p minus for PI over three. Now this corrections. So this rotation from p to r and from p to q, they do not really depend on what I do here. So you can go by any trajectory from q to r, anything, it would still be add four PI over three here and subtract four PI over three here.
00:44:47.544 - 00:45:48.074, Speaker A: The reason is the following. It's exactly this hematopoietical relation. So it doesn't matter which of them you take, because again, when you look at the curve from p to r, it lies in the simply connected domain omega minus gamma going from a to p, right? It's supposed to not self intersect, remember? So this is why we use the fact that it's not self intersecting. So it doesn't matter which one you take, because again, both p and r are boundary edges. Remember that the rotation between two boundary edges of the same domain. And this is domain omega minus beginning of the curve, they are the same. So it's very easy, again, to see that from Q, you rotate by four PI over three and minus four PI over three here.
00:45:48.074 - 00:46:28.776, Speaker A: Okay? And now observe that, of course, these two numbers are exactly the same. Why? Because look at the picture. From a to p, you go the way you couple them, you go the same way from a to p. So of course they are the same. And here comes the main computation. So you want to take the contribution of gamma one, gamma two. So, okay, this is contribution of gamma one.
00:46:28.776 - 00:46:59.004, Speaker A: This is contribution of gamma two. Again, gamma one and z. Gamma two and z. Now the beginning. Well, this is the same, right? So this factor and this factor, they are the same. So let's take them out. Also we can take out the winding of the curve up to p, because all these two are the same objects.
00:46:59.004 - 00:47:54.124, Speaker A: And we also want to take out p minus v. So what remains for the curve gamma one? What remains is r minus v divided by p minus v e to the minus I sigma for PI over three, right? Because the rotation was for PI over three and we are supposed to multiply it by minus I sigma. Here. What remains is q minus v over p minus v divided by e plus I sigma for PI over three, because again, rotation is minus four PI over three. So let's call this contraption star and let's compute it. So this ratio is e to the minus two, PI over three. You plug in sigma.
00:47:54.124 - 00:48:50.344, Speaker A: What was sigma? What was sigma? Let's find sigma. Sigma is five eight. So you just plug it in here and you get e to the minus I, five, six, PI and then the same thing with the plus sign here. So this would be e to the minus three halves PI I plus e to the three halves PI I. This is I minus I, which is zero. So contribution of gamma one and gamma two is zero. So these two contributions of at least these two curves cancel out to the sum.
00:48:50.344 - 00:49:33.394, Speaker A: So it's all good. Now, one feature of this, it did not involve any x. So this computation is true for any x. And actually this computation is the way to find the right sigma. So if I would tell, okay, so this is absorbable, f of z is equal, the thing with parameters sigma and x. And we want to find the right sigma and the right x for this key limit to hold. What would be the sigma? This is the first computation.
00:49:33.394 - 00:49:58.814, Speaker A: You do the computation, you find sigma. As you will see in other models, you can do exactly the same computation and find other sigmas. Now what would be the x? That would be the next computation we'll do right after the next ten minute break. So let's again take a ten minute break. Let me stop recording.
