00:00:00.440 - 00:00:03.834, Speaker A: Arthur, are you ready?
00:00:04.134 - 00:00:06.422, Speaker B: Yes, I am.
00:00:06.598 - 00:00:30.750, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everybody. Welcome to week eleven of our focus program flies. We are already in week eleven, so we are excited to listen to Arthur Nicola from Universita Antonoma de Barcelona, who is going to talk about Plasca products and inner functions. Arthur, please.
00:00:30.942 - 00:01:34.974, Speaker B: Yeah, so thanks a lot, Javard. Well, it's of course, a pleasure to talk here and well, first I would like to thank the organizers for their kind invitation and also for organizing the program, the very interesting program, and also all of you for coming and for listening to this. Okay, so my topic is, as you see, blascular products and linear functions. And this is, as you know, a very classical notion. It may have around 100 years of history. And they are very classical and important work by Nevadina, by brother Fries, by Smirnov, Frosman, and of course, Berlin. And after this classical work, the notion became, I guess, classical both in complex functional analysis and in other areas.
00:01:34.974 - 00:02:46.444, Speaker B: Most of these classical work is collected in many excellent textbooks. So I have decided to follow less common path, and my plan is to present some results which I find extremely beautiful on dynamical properties and also on the statistical properties of inner functions. And, well, more concretely, these mini course, well, should be something like a geodesic between classical definitions and classical results, and more modern results on dynamical. And as I said, the statistical properties of inner functions, which are due essentially to add an Pomerenke, Deringa Mane. And you'll see, you'll see in the next couple of sessions. Most of the results are not collected in textbooks and one has to refer to the classical, to the papers in the journals. Okay, so let's see.
00:02:46.444 - 00:03:32.284, Speaker B: So let's start. Okay, so the plan today is to collect some basic definitions and basic results. We will need. And let's start with the definition. As you see here, an inner function is an analytic function from the analytic function from the disk into itself. So this unit disk in the complex plane, which has this extreme property of having radio limits of modulus one at almost every point in the circle. So inner functions are mappings, as you see, this should be the unit disk into itself.
00:03:32.284 - 00:04:30.146, Speaker B: Mappings which bring analytic mappings which bring the disk into itself and which have this property, right, this nice property that are extremely. In this sense, in the sense that they map, in some sense, they map the circle into itself. Okay, one important thing, and this will have, well, this will be important, is that the mapping from the circle into itself, defined through the radial limits, it's only defined on almost every point. So this is defined not at every point, but at almost every point in the circle. Okay, so. And as you'll see in a minute, this function. This boundary function.
00:04:30.146 - 00:04:49.364, Speaker B: This function, defined it on the boundary is far from being smooth in general. Okay, so. Okay, so this is a finishing. So then I guess I should give you examples. Okay, so here are the examples. There are two families of examples. One is basically products.
00:04:49.364 - 00:04:58.884, Speaker B: I hope that you are seeing my writing. Right.
00:05:00.824 - 00:05:01.920, Speaker A: Very good.
00:05:02.112 - 00:05:38.854, Speaker B: Yeah. So, assume that you have a sequence of points in the disk which satisfy this Blaschke condition. So the sum of the distances to the boundary to the unit circle is summable. Okay? So this means that the points in the disk approach the unit circle at a certain speed so that the sum of distances. So if this is a ten. Of course, this is just. This is just the distance.
00:05:38.854 - 00:06:20.212, Speaker B: So they approach the unit circle sufficiently fast so that this army is converging. Then you can consider the blascker product with 00:10 which is. Which is just this product. So here we have some unimodal constants, and then we have z minus z. One minus zn z. Okay, so maybe I should use this. Yeah.
00:06:20.212 - 00:07:00.054, Speaker B: Okay, so. Well, it turns out that under this condition, under this Blaschke condition, this infinite product converges. So if you only have finally many points at n, then we say that this is a finite blascker product because it has a finite number of zeros. Right? It's clear that the zeros of this function will be just the sequence z. And moreover, what happens is that this product converges not only at every point in the disk, but at every point in the complex plane. Minus, say, the pole.
00:07:00.954 - 00:07:02.374, Speaker A: Male kandao, shush.
00:07:05.754 - 00:07:09.934, Speaker B: Is something happening? Okay, minus the.
00:07:27.774 - 00:07:47.990, Speaker A: Arthur, please unmute yourself, because I muted everybody and you are included in everybody. I'm sorry for that. Yeah.
00:07:48.022 - 00:07:48.934, Speaker B: Can you hear me now?
00:07:49.014 - 00:07:51.394, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, I hear you back. Thank you.
00:07:52.074 - 00:08:32.898, Speaker B: So, I was saying that the Blaschke product, I mean, this infinite product not only converges at points in the unit disk, but also at points which are outside the unit disk as soon as you are far away from the reflected points of the zeros. Okay. Okay, so. And it's not hard to believe that this is an inner function at the end. I mean, you need to prove that. But at the end, this is just a product of optomorphisms of the disk, which fix the boundary, which sends the boundary to the boundary. So it's not hard to believe that when z approaches a point in the unit circle, this has radial limits of modulus one.
00:08:32.898 - 00:09:23.144, Speaker B: So this is an inner function. But there is another collection of inner functions which are what we call the singular inner functions. These are inner functions which have no zero sheet. So since they have no zeros, they will be exponentials. So this is how one can describe them. So, given a measure, a positive measure in the unit circle, which is singular with respect to Lebeque measure. So Lebeque measure in the unit circle will be denoted by dm, then.
00:09:23.144 - 00:10:31.280, Speaker B: So this means that the measured mu is a positive measure in the unit circle, but it's concentrated on a set of Lebesgues measure zero. So it's concentrated in a small set. So, for instance, mu could be a didact mass at the point in the unit circle combination, a linear combination of the DaC masses at points in the unit circle. But you should also think on more sophisticated singular measures. For instance, the counter measure in a counter set of Lebec measure zero. Okay? So given a singular measure of a singular positive measure, one can consider this, what we call the singular inner function associated to it, which is just the exponential of minus the hertz integral of the measured mu. So again, say z will be a point in the unit disk.
00:10:31.280 - 00:11:54.034, Speaker B: So this is the definition, and this is an integral over the unit circle. So, for instance, if mu is a Dac mass at the point, say psi naught, then the measure will be just this exponential, right? This exponential here, for instance. But as I said, mu could be much more complicated. Okay, so it turns out that this is also a singular, I'm sorry, this is also an inner function. And to show this, well, this is, let me give you say, a pseudo sketch of the argument. You look to the, to show that mu is, that s mu is inner. So this is the question, right? So we need to show, we need to compute the log of the modulus of s mu at the point r sine zero sine naught will be a point in the unit circle.
00:11:54.034 - 00:12:24.170, Speaker B: And then we need to show that this limit, when r tends to one, tends to zero. Okay? But here you have the modulus. So you have here the modulus. So you have the modulus of this exponential. So you need to take the real part of that. And this is very convenient, right? Because the real part of this kernel, of this helicopter kernel, you can compute, and this is just the Poisson kernel. So it turns out that this is right here minus.
00:12:24.170 - 00:13:41.426, Speaker B: Then what I will get here is the integral of one minus r squared psi minus r sine naught squared d mu psi. The integral over the unit circle. And as I said, the plan is to show that this tends to zero at almost every point. But when r tends to one, this tends to the derivative of this measure with respect to Lebec measure at the point sine naught. This is because the Poisson kernel is an approximation of the identity. So this means that you will get here the derivative of mu with respect to Lebec measure at the point sine naught, at least at almost every point sine naught on the circle. And this is the end of the story, right? Because since mu was single with respect to Lebeque measure, this means that the derivative of mu with respect to Lebec measure is equal to zero at almost every point of the unit circle.
00:13:41.426 - 00:14:22.604, Speaker B: So this means that this is zero at almost every point in the unit circle, because, as I said, mu is singular with respect to Lebec measure. Okay? So at the end, what we have shown is that this logarithm of the modulus tends to zero. So this means that the modulus of smu tends to one at almost every point of the unit circle. Okay? So this is a singular. So this expression here, it's really an inner function. It has radial limits of modulus, one at almost every points. And actually what happens is that these are all the examples.
00:14:22.604 - 00:15:17.584, Speaker B: Actually, there is a theorem here, a classical theorem, which says that any inner function is the product of a blasker product and a single linear function. So f inner. Then f is the product of the blascker product and a singular inner factor. Okay? So of course, here in this decomposition, in this factorization, the points at ten are very easily seen, because of course, the ten are just the zeros of the inner function. And then you have this extra factor, which is the singular inner part of your inner function. Okay? Okay. So these are the examples you should have in mind, blascular products or single linear functions.
00:15:17.584 - 00:16:09.914, Speaker B: And what I want to say next is that what happens is that the behavior of an inner function is very nice. I mean, we are, we are going to be interested essentially on the behavior of the inner function in the boundary in the unit circle. And we'll see that this behavior is very nice if you are far away from the zeros and from the support of the singular part of the inner function. However, if you are close to the zeros or close to the support, then you'll see that there is a kind of, say, chaotic behavior of the inner function. So this is the content of my next slide. Okay, so this. Well, the title is singularities of an inner function.
00:16:09.914 - 00:17:34.082, Speaker B: And here is the definition. And if you have f is going to be here an inner function which will decompose as a Blaschke part oblasque factor, and a singular inner function, as I wrote here. Okay, then you define the singular, the singularity, the singular set of the function f as the set of points in the circle where the function does not extend analytically. Okay, so the single set is a subset of the unit circle, and it's the set, the subset where bad things happen, because the function does not extend analytically. Well, then what? The first remark is that this singular set can be easily found when you look to the zeros and the support of the measure. And it turns out that the singular set is precisely the set of accumulation points of the zeros union, the close support of the singular measure. So here is, say, an example.
00:17:34.082 - 00:18:25.294, Speaker B: So, assume that you have a blast product whose zeros approach, for instance, this point and also this point. So in that case, the singular set will be just the union of these two points. But as I said, the only condition you require on the zeros is condition. So the only condition you require on the zeros is that the sum of the distances to the boundary are convergent. So this means that the sequence of zeros must tend to the boundary very fast, but they could accumulate to every point in the unit circle. So in other words, it could happen that this set is the whole unit circle. Okay, so this singular set could be large.
00:18:25.294 - 00:19:30.184, Speaker B: Okay, so let me, let me show that. Okay, so there is a part, I mean, let me show this identity. So this part is essentially, well, it's trivial, right? Because if you have a point which is not in here, so it's not an accumulation point of the zeros, or it's not pointing the support of the measure, then what happens, as I said, is that both the Blaschke product and the singular part extend analytically, because this, you can see directly from the formulas, right? See, if you are far away from the zeros. This extends analytically. If you are far away from the support of the measure, then you do not need to integrate over the whole unit circle, but only on the support of the measure. This denominator here never vanishes. And then the function extends analytically.
00:19:30.184 - 00:21:09.724, Speaker B: Okay, so this is, in that case, it's trivial, because both factors, these and these, extend analytically at psi. Okay, for. For the other inclusion, what we are going to show is that if you have a point, if you have a point in here, if psi is a point in here, say psi naught is a point in here. So an accumulation point of the zeros or a point in the support, on the closed support of the measure, then we are going to show that there exists a sequence of points converging to psi naught such that the function at these points tend to zero. So if you, if you are close to the zeros or you are in the close support of the measure, you can always find points which are very close to this and still on which the function tends to zero. Then of course, if this happens, then it's clear that the function cannot extend analytically at the point psi naught. Right? Because you cannot extend analytically, because if so, if you could, the function should have modulus one right at this point because it has modulus one at almost every point.
00:21:09.724 - 00:22:28.594, Speaker B: Okay, so how can you see that? Well, it's quite easy. Right. How can you choose these points wn here where the function tends to zero. So here there is two cases, right? If sineaught is actually an accumulation point of the ten, then you can take as wn. This wn could be just a subsequence of the zeros, the subsequence which tends to psi naught, just a subsequence of the zeros. So in that case, I mean, if you are in this situation, then it's clear. What about if you are in the close support of the measure? If psi naught is in the close support of the measure, then what happens is that you can find points, other points in the circle which approach sine zero such that the derivative at these points with respect to Lebec measure is infinite.
00:22:28.594 - 00:23:20.354, Speaker B: And in that case, it's again easy, because if the derivative is infinite, then what happens is that the corresponding singular inner function at this point tends to zero. So the situation in that case is the following. You have here the point sine zero, and here you have the points psi n which approach this point psi naught. Then what we are saying is that the red limit here tends to zero. So what you only. So what you need to show, what you need to do is the following. Then you will, you can take wn to be just rn psi n where rn tends to one.
00:23:20.354 - 00:23:50.958, Speaker B: Okay? So you take points which are close. This will be rn psi n. Then this will be extremely small. And these points, of course, will tend to the point sine naught. Here will be next. Here will be next, and so on. Okay, so in other words, at the end, what we have shown is that the singular set of inner function consists precisely.
00:23:50.958 - 00:24:51.868, Speaker B: I mean, the bat set. The set where the function does not extend analytically consists of two parts, the close support of the measure and the accumulation points of the zeros. Now, I'd like to tell you that the situation at this singular set is very, well, it's the behavior of the inner function at each of, at any point of this singular set is very wild. And here is the content of, of my next slide. So, here is the theorem. The theorem says that you have an inner function. Again, f will be an inner function, and then you have this singular set right on the unit circle, which could be, as I said, the whole unit circle.
00:24:51.868 - 00:25:31.166, Speaker B: Okay? Or maybe it could be an arc. So it could be a large set. Well, then what happens is, for instance, think that this is just an arc. Then what happens is that your function extends analytically outside the singular set. So here you have an analytic extension. However, the behavior, as I said, in the singular set is very wide. So this is, well, this is described by this set, this cluster set.
00:25:31.166 - 00:26:18.646, Speaker B: So let me, let me explain what this notation means. So here is the definition. A cluster set of a function at the point psi, sub psi, will be now a point in the singular set. Okay? So here is a point psi. Okay? So the cluster set of, say, this inner function at the point psi is the set of possible values of, I'm sorry, of possible limits of the function f. So is the set of complex values such that there exists a sequence of points tending to psi, such that the function tends to w. So it's the set of possible limits of the function f when you approach this point psi.
00:26:18.646 - 00:27:03.564, Speaker B: Okay, so what the theorem tells you is the part, I mean, part b of the theorem tells you that the cluster set is as big as it could be. It's the whole closed unit disk, okay? And this happens for all points in the singular set. For all points in the singular set. So this means that, as I said, the behavior of the function of the inner function at any point of the singular set is very wild because the possible limits are as, I mean, the possible, the set of possible limits is as large as it could be. It's the whole closed unit disk. Okay? Okay. So let me try to explain a proof of this result.
00:27:03.564 - 00:27:34.134, Speaker B: I'm going also, this is still very classical. I'm just going to sketch it. Okay, so the idea. Well, parta is already proved, right? Because if you are outside, I'm sorry, if you are outside the similar set, then both the blascker product and the singular inner part extends analytical. So here, part a is already proved. So we need to restrict to part b. Okay.
00:27:34.134 - 00:28:43.098, Speaker B: And as you'll see, part b is, well, in a sense, I already proved it, because what we show is that if you have a point psi in the singular set, we show in the previous proof that there exists points. We know we already did that. We know that there exists points, let me call them alpha n in the disk converging to psi such that f of alpha n tends to zero. So this means that if you have a point in the singular set, the origin is in the cluster set, zero is in the cluster set of this function. At the point side is a possible limit. Right. When you approach this point, the function can approach the origin.
00:28:43.098 - 00:29:17.454, Speaker B: Okay? But then, of course, you can apply this. So now fix a point w in the disk. Then you can apply this argument to, not to the function f, but to the Mobius transform of this function. This is, of course, also an inner function. And the set of singularities of this inner function is the same of the set of singularities of f. Sub psi is also a singular point of this function. So we know.
00:29:17.454 - 00:29:52.334, Speaker B: So this is inner. And the singular set of these is, of course, the singular set of f. And psi was here. So psi is a singular point of this function. So there are. So hence the origin is also in the cluster set of this function at the point side. So this means that there are points where the function f tends to w.
00:29:52.334 - 00:30:32.742, Speaker B: So this means that w is in the cluster set of the function f. Right. And then, well, of course, what happens is that the whole, what we have proved is that the whole disk, the whole open unit disk is contained in this cluster set. Okay? So what we know is that the whole unit disk is contained in the cluster set. But of course, the cluster set is a set of possible limit values. So it's a closed set. Right.
00:30:32.742 - 00:31:29.134, Speaker B: And it's a closed set, of course, contained in the closed unit disk. Whoop. This should be closed, is a close set. So this means that the cluster set is the whole thing. So this. Well, with these two screens, what I have, what I hope I will, I have convinced you, is that when you look to an inner function and you look to its boundary values, which are only defined at almost every point, then there is always a good set and a bad set. The good set is the set where the function extends analytically precisely the complement of the singular set.
00:31:29.134 - 00:32:27.724, Speaker B: And then at the bad set, the function behaves as wild as it would be. So this means that when you look to this function defined at the boundary, you should be especially careful when you look at points where the function does not extend analytically, because there the situation, the behavior of the function is very well, and it's a kind of zero one law. If you are outside this set, the situation is very nice. If you are inside this set, the situation is very chaotic. Okay, so now I have a couple of slides where, well, I will not present proofs, but I will just refer to this classical textbooks. Okay. One concerns angular derivative.
00:32:27.724 - 00:33:20.044, Speaker B: So what's the angular derivative? So, when you have an analytic mapping from the disk into itself, and you have a point in the boundary. So the idea is that in some cases, you can define what the, even if the function does not extend analytically at this point psi, you can still define the derivative in a sense, which has a lot of meaning, the derivative of the function at a boundary point. Okay, so here is the unid disk. Here you have this boundary point. Okay, this is what's called the Julia Caratheodori theorem. It says the following, that if you have your, if you are in this situation, the following three conditions are equivalent. The first is that the lean infinite.
00:33:20.044 - 00:33:57.604, Speaker B: Observe that this is a lean inf. When you approach the point psi in any possible direction, this lean inf of one minus mod g over one minus z is finite. Second condition, I mean this, the fact that this is finite is equivalent to the following condition. The function has radial limits, even non tangential limits, when you approach the Pom's eye. This is my notation for non tangential limits. And this non tangential limit lies in the unit circle. So the function g maps, in a sense, this point to a point in the unit circle.
00:33:57.604 - 00:34:45.744, Speaker B: And moreover, the divided differences, as you see here, these divided differences has a limit. When you approach, again, non tangential, this is the second condition. The third is the first part of the third is identical to the second. And here, instead of the divided differences, you can replace divided differences by the non tangential limit of the derivative. Okay, these three conditions are equivalent. And this thing is what's called the angular derivative of the function g at the point psi. Well, in the case of linear functions, this, I mean, this result holds for any analytic self mapping of the disk.
00:34:45.744 - 00:36:01.154, Speaker B: In the case that g here is an inner function, then you have a very nice description. And this is essentially due to Frostman and Mercer. It says the following, that if you have an inner function, then, I'm sorry, the modulus of the angular derivative at the point psi is precisely this quantity, just the sum of Poisson kernels at the point psi. I'm sorry, the sum of Poisson kernels at the series of the plasket product evaluated at the point psi plus two times the integral of these of the singular measure. This is very nice, because what this result tells you is that when this quantity is finite, the function f has an angular derivative at this point. And when this quantity is infinite, the function does not have an angular derivative at this point. So it's an if and only if, right? This is actually formally, it's formally, it's not hard to show that.
00:36:01.154 - 00:36:53.354, Speaker B: What is a little bit more delicate is precisely what I have said to show that when this is finite, the function has an angular derivative. But from the formal point of view, this is quite easy. Let me just, well, mention this from the formal point of view. So what happens is that this is a, instead of writing the models here, what you do is you write, you do this trick. Okay? So, of course, since you are in the unit circle, f has modulus one, psi has modulus one. So nothing happens here. When you compute this quantity, this term turns out to be positive.
00:36:53.354 - 00:37:37.274, Speaker B: This is the trick. When you compute this, this is just positive. I'm not caring about convergence, right? I'm just acting for mole. And then, of course, this is just the sum of the two logarithmic derivatives of the blasphemy part and the singular inner part. So this is just psi times b prime divided by b and psi times s mu prime divided by s mutation. And then when you act this in this way, then you just compute. The blasphemy product is of course, a product.
00:37:37.274 - 00:37:58.086, Speaker B: So this is the lower ending derivative of a product. So it's the sum of lower ending derivatives. And then you get this part here. And when you compute this, this is, again, very easy because Smu was an exponential. So this is easily computable. And you get disquanted here. Okay, so this is the notion of angular derivative.
00:37:58.086 - 00:38:56.504, Speaker B: And this is used in my next class. The next result I want to recall, which is still classical, and it's theorem. Okay? So what we're going to do is we're going to move to dynamical properties of inner functions. So the first result in this direction is this classical result, which tells you about the dynamical behavior of the inner function inside the unit disk, in the interior of the unit disk. So let g be an analytic mapping from the disk into itself. So for instance, an inner function, but could be just an analytic mapping from the disk into itself. And what we are going to do is to assume that g is not an optomorphism.
00:38:56.504 - 00:39:38.438, Speaker B: And what we are going to do is to look at the nth iterate of g. Okay? So we are going to iterate this picture n times, and this is just the nth iterate. Okay? So this will be just the nth iterate. It's not the power, but just the iterate. So, theorem tells you that there is always an important point, and this is the point p. So there are two possible situations. So, assume that you have a fixed point.
00:39:38.438 - 00:40:24.892, Speaker B: Your function g fixes a point inside the unit disk. Then what happens is that these iterates converge uniformly complex of the unit disk to this fixed point. But it also could happen that your mapping has no fixed point in the disk. So if you don't have any fixed point in the disk, then what happens is that there exists a point in the circle such that so there is a point in. In that case, there will be a point in the circle. So, for instance here, such that the rate of limit is equal to p. So this means that the boundary mapping fixes the point p.
00:40:24.892 - 00:41:19.578, Speaker B: So the point p is, in that case is not in the disc, but in the circle, but still is a fixed point. And then still happens that the iterates converge uniformly on complex to this fixed point. Moreover, it happens that the, the angular derivative at this fixed point is smaller or equal to one. Okay? So in other words, what the jug wolf theorem tells is that there is always a fixed point. And maybe this fixed point is inside the disk, or maybe it's on the circle. But it always happened that the iterates converge uniformly on complex of the unit disk to this fixed point. Okay? So in practical terms, how, how would you find this fixed point? So, in practical terms, this fixed point acts as an attractor.
00:41:19.578 - 00:42:04.364, Speaker B: The iterates converge uniformly on complex to this fixed point. So how you find this, the fixed point, which, by the way, is called the wall fixed point p. Ah, here is p is called the individual fixed point of the function g. So, in practical terms, you'll find it in the following way. So, if you have a fixed point inside the unit disk, this is an individual fixed point, and you don't need to worry more about it. But if you find no fixed, I mean, if your function has no fixed points inside the unit disk, it could have infinitely many fixed points in the circle. But among these infinitely many fixed points in the circle, there is just one which satisfies this condition.
00:42:04.364 - 00:42:32.724, Speaker B: This angular derivative is smaller or equal to one. And this is the individual fixed point. So, in the circle, if your fixed point is in the circle, the dendritical fixed point is described by this condition. Among the fixed points is the only one which satisfies that this is a smaller equal. Okay. Okay, so here this theorem has, as you see, two parts. And the first part is really easy.
00:42:32.724 - 00:43:44.070, Speaker B: And the second is, well, the proof of the second is more, is more tricky, it's more complicated, but still, it's, well, you can find it in many text about it. Okay, so now let me start with some dynamical properties of the inner function, but now not look as a mapping from the disk into itself, but as a mapping from the circle into itself. So what we are going to, in this session, and in the next two sessions, we are going to worry essentially about the behavior of the mapping defined on the unit circle in the boundary. Okay, so here is the first important fact, which is the invariance of harmonic measures. So, let me start with the definition. So if you have dm, as I said, will be my notation for normalized Lebec measure in the unit circle. So the measure of the unit circle is just one instead of two PI.
00:43:44.070 - 00:44:33.710, Speaker B: And whenever you have a point z in the disk. So here is the disk, you have a point z and a set e. So for instance, this set e, this is the harmonic measure. And this is the definition of harmonic measure from the point z of the set e, which lies on the circle. So it essentially measures how you see the set e from the point z. So imagine that you are standing on the point z here, right? And say that your horizon is the whole unit circle. So what this quantity measures is which proportion of the horizon, of your horizon, which is the whole unit circle, is covered by the set e.
00:44:33.710 - 00:45:34.704, Speaker B: Okay? So for instance, if instead of here, instead of here, you have a point which is in here, you essentially see the set e, right? So this means that this harmonic measure is very close to one. However, if you are in here, if your point z is in here, you essentially see no set e, right? All your horizon is located around this point. So this harmonic measure is very close to zero. So this harmonic measure measures, well, as I said, the part of your, of the unit circle would you see from the point z. It is of course, a harmonic function. I mean, this is just a harmonic function of the, this function as a function of z is harmonic. It's just a Poisson integral.
00:45:34.704 - 00:47:15.854, Speaker B: So it's harmonic is of course between zero and one because it has boundary values. When you approach the circle, when you approach your set e, this tends to one, and when you approach the complement, it tends to zero, right? So it has the same boundary values as the characteristic function of the set e, right? It's just the Poisson integral of the characteristic function of e. Okay? It's also very important because it's conformal invariant, the harmonic measure from the z e. So this is part of, I guess it's important because it's conformal invariant. So the harmonic measure, if you consider tau to be the optomal physical, which interchanges zero and z, then the harmonic measure from the point z of the z e is precisely the harmonic measure from the origin of the set tau v. And this is precisely, of course, the harmonic measure from the origin, as you see here, is just, when z is the origin is just Lebec measure, right? So it's just, this is just Lebec measure of this. Okay? So what happens is that harmonic measure is invariant under inner functions, and this is something what sometimes is called lef nerlemma.
00:47:15.854 - 00:48:32.396, Speaker B: So if you have an inner function, it's very nice, right? Because here you have your inner function and you have here a set e. So for instance, e could be an arc, okay? Just this arc here. Okay? So the pre image, as I said, the function defined at almost every point is far from being continuous. It could be discontinuous at every point. So the pre image of an arc would be something very complicated, could have many different components, for instance. So what happens is that if you have here a point f of z the way you see f, the set e from f of z is the same as the way you see the pre image of the set d from the point z. So for instance, assume that your point z is a fixed point of your function f.
00:48:32.396 - 00:49:23.004, Speaker B: Then what happens is that harmonic measure is invariant. The invariance means that the measure of a set is equal to the measure of the pre image. So, for instance, if p is equal to zero, this means that the measure of the pre image is equal to the measure of the set. Okay? So let me finish the talk today by explaining the proof of this result, which is something which is essentially obvious. Okay? It's obvious because why this result is true. Well, it's true because both are harmonic functions, right? This is harmonic and this is harmonic. Both are bounded harmonic functions.
00:49:23.004 - 00:49:59.168, Speaker B: It's always, harmonic measure is always bounded between zero and one. So this, you want to show that these two harmonic functions are equal. So you only need to show that the boundary limits are the same at almost every point. But the boundary limit of this harmonic function is precisely the characteristic function of the indicator function of f minus one of e. And the boundary limits of this is, of course, the point. I mean, this will have limit one precisely when z is in the pre image of the set e. And we'll have limit zero if you are outside the preimage of the set b.
00:49:59.168 - 00:50:14.174, Speaker B: So these two bounded harmonic functions have the same boundary limits, so they must be the same. Okay. So they are the same. So I guess I will finish with this today. Thanks a lot for your attention.
00:50:16.394 - 00:50:52.114, Speaker A: Thank you indeed. Arthur. Let's thank the speaker first. Wonderful talk. Is there any question or comment for Arthur? Arthur, one comment. On page six, you mentioned a result for Frostman and Greece. I don't know why I always thought that this is a result of Ahern and Clark.
00:50:52.574 - 00:51:23.856, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, I also thought that. And then it seems as far as I. Well. Well, my comment is that maybe you are right. Actually, I thought that you were right. But when I was preparing the course, I saw in several places that, for instance, in the mono, in the survey of Eros Xman, I saw that he attributed this result to Frostman and Bris.
00:51:23.856 - 00:51:46.526, Speaker B: And actually, I saw it in another place. So. But I have to confess that I haven't looked at the original papers by Frostman and Ries. So maybe. Maybe you are right. And what is, what I'm sure is that this identity is also proved in the paper by Ahern and Clark. You're right, but it's probably previous.
00:51:46.526 - 00:51:47.234, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:48.334 - 00:52:09.632, Speaker A: The result I think Javad is referring to. So the result you stated here, Artur, is of Frostman and Reese. The result of Hernan Clark, is that this condition is equivalent to every function in the model space corresponding to the inner function has a non tangential limit at that point.
00:52:09.688 - 00:52:26.792, Speaker B: So that's. Yeah, you're right. But precisely in that paper, they start. I guess it's the same paper, they start showing this. Right, showing this identity. Achelman, Clark. And I guess that they prove, again, this identity.
00:52:26.792 - 00:52:33.404, Speaker B: So it could happen that they were not aware of the previous papers by Frostman and Reece. I guess.
00:52:34.344 - 00:52:49.466, Speaker A: Okay, I should have a look again at the paper. Maybe another difference is that Crossman and Ries considered singular inner function. But. Ahem. And Clark, it could be any positive measure. Maybe. I have to double check.
00:52:49.570 - 00:52:53.218, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I should also check. Yeah, yeah. Maybe you are right.
00:52:53.266 - 00:52:57.426, Speaker A: Yeah, this is true. I mean, it can have an outer factor.
00:52:57.570 - 00:53:00.974, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:03.394 - 00:53:19.374, Speaker A: Okay. Any. Any further comment or question for Arthur? If not, let's thank him again. We.
