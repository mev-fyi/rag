00:00:00.280 - 00:00:53.144, Speaker A: Okay, well, um, does everyone remember linear algebra? What's, what's the, um, what's the take home from linear algebra? Larry? Well, well, that's, that's the take home from my take. Okay. Uh, I wish, I wish I could make a whirlwind tour of all linear algebra factors and try out that theory. That's what linear algebra is. You know, I think for 99.99% of people, linear algebra is a phrase that has two words. Both begin with r.
00:00:53.144 - 00:02:14.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I think matrices are rho reduction, of course, column reduction, too. Row and column reduction. Okay, that's, that's what, and to be honest, that's what I would, if I wanted to prove any of these trivially equivalent terms, I would start with. I would probably start because it was tricky proof, but I never can remember. Okay. I mean, I studied them, but I definitely, definitely say that one of these trivially equivalent non trivial theorems. Good.
00:02:14.274 - 00:03:42.614, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's, let's see what, let's put it into practice. Let's see if it works. So the idea was we have two strands in the a algebra, if you want, but you can't ignore the fact for the proof in the book. Okay, so we look at connections. Unit don't have a unit. You join a unit with complex numbers, you don't have to worry about throwing it away. You don't have to worry about recycling.
00:03:42.614 - 00:04:45.574, Speaker A: The unit is information. We have a, and we want to prove subjectivity. What was our strategy? We have the map. We'll, first of all the maps. We want to get a group map. This is what the inductor meaning is a consequence of transactivity. You do it for instead of the original algebra, you look at continuous functions.
00:04:45.574 - 00:07:41.474, Speaker A: Suspension. There's continuous functions on the circle that are pure multiple of the units, either scalers or we're looking at matrices. Then we're going to have to deform it to matrices. But also at the beginning we have to look, I can read it more easily, okay. To homotope it to a very special kind of curve right inside matrix, some projection, some idempotent p times z plus some one minus p. One is the unit in some n by n. And the first step is to pass to the case.
00:07:41.474 - 00:09:34.134, Speaker A: Using the compact outdoor space. You have a partition of unit of, partition of unity that's sitting inside. Subordinate too, given open covering. That's how you reduce the polynomial case. This is sort of, before we get to the row reduction, we reduce a zero plus a, one plus a, except you have to start off approximation theorem in terms of trigonometric polynomials. So we multiply through by power zens the, before we're using that, this is a group, that the image is a group, we're given an element that we're allowed to prove that it is in the, given an element of the code domain, prove it in the image. We can multiply it by something that is in the image or add it to something.
00:09:34.134 - 00:11:11.904, Speaker A: In terms of the group operation, we can modify it by something that is in the group. That's how we convert a trigonometric polynomial to ordinary polynomial. This now is one by one matrices. If we start out, if we loop the continuous path, that's where the coefficients and the whole, the whole curve is in. What that says, by the way, is zero plus one killer invertible matrix. So we can take the curve constant equal to that. That would be a trivial curve, multiply by the inverse, but by one.
00:11:11.904 - 00:12:35.136, Speaker A: This stage, it's still the unit of a or the matrix out of a given curve. Okay, so it's one by one. Before we start to discuss what the main strategy is, it's row reduction, right? So we got to have a matrix, but it might not be, it might be just the algebra itself. But then going one by one, in the textbook, professor warden and his two, that kind students do a very careful calculation of the exact size of matrices that's needed to get rid of the higher powers of the z. Okay, we're never going to get rid of z to the curve. Don't expect to have a constant curve. We don't expect to end up with a constant curve.
00:12:35.136 - 00:13:25.446, Speaker A: Linear curve will have all the, and this is an optimal result. And that's reducing the degree by one. Reducing the degree by n minus one. The car is going to n minus one by n minus one matrices. Someone can check that. That's what the formula. Has anyone checked it already? Okay, well, we just have to glance and see how large the matrix is.
00:13:25.446 - 00:14:26.824, Speaker A: I think they even write the matrix out. Let's not try to get an optimal size in execute, but just double the size of a given size, double the given size until we can reduce the one. So instead of two to the, instead of n minus one, we're going to get two to the n minus one. I don't think given we have to go to matrix, I don't think anyone's going to mine too much to make. Well, that's sort of a second or third or subtitle. Okay, so let's, let's look at the simplest way to introduce two by two. Matrices.
00:14:26.824 - 00:15:36.732, Speaker A: We just look at the upper left hand corner. Diagonal matrix is one. And the other, diagonal division, zero algebra. This is the path of vertical elements of two by two algebra. Two by two matrix algebra over the two by two matrix value functions on a, which are two by two matrix value functions on the circle, one. In fact, point one. Okay, so I'm open for instructions.
00:15:36.732 - 00:16:39.584, Speaker A: What should we, um, what should we, uh, what should our next, what's in our first, um, row we do have, we gonna, well, okay. Okay. By the way, we're not going to try to get rid of, exactly. The trouble is, if we, and then you're saying maybe put it up here also. The trouble is if we do that in the next stage, if we move it over, we're going to be stuck with the end here. And we get rid of this one, we'll still have this one. But why not, why not be less ambitious and just aim for that, try to get rid of that.
00:16:39.584 - 00:18:08.170, Speaker A: So why not, and up here, why not just put, or, because then next time we can multiply by z to the n minus one. And then we're never going to get any terms. There won't be any residual terms of degree. Okay, so let's try it with some. By the way, why don't we put, why don't we be a little more sort of preparing for the future? Why don't we put an an here too? The next time we just have to modify my value. An doesn't belong to Ian, is just an element of algebra. It's not a scaler.
00:18:08.170 - 00:19:08.574, Speaker A: But when z is equal to one, we want to hold a unit element here. Why don't we subtract an? Then when z is equal to one, this is zero. In fact, it's even the identity, it's even the unit element, okay? Which is sort of, sort of an ideal behavior. But this final step, the final step is going to be quite handy. To have the final curve. Find a linear curve, general linear curve plus a one. Zen.
00:19:08.574 - 00:19:48.274, Speaker A: But this doesn't mean that these are a one, is not important. Okay. Okay. But then at the next stage, we keep the next stage. We have the same, same thing here, same thing here, but it won't be the same thing here anymore because we're removing things. We're doing column reduction. We multiply this column by something.
00:19:48.274 - 00:20:45.694, Speaker A: But then whatever we, since this is a one down here, whatever we multiply, we choose what we want to multiply by looking at this upper right entry. But we have to then remember to get hitch, the lower right entry too. And so we'll get, what is it we should modify by. Okay, let's try that. Who said that? Yeah. Oh, okay, good. How many people agree? Okay, well, okay, I mean you're not, you're not putting, you know, reshape is the only one that's putting money on it.
00:20:45.694 - 00:22:11.304, Speaker A: Okay, so um, and what do we have here? Well, we have star and then um, I guess we want to just subtract. Okay. We could have put a minus sign here the way it is, as long as we keep track. Okay. But then that means that what we have here is after we've taken the z to the n minus one times this, that gets rid completely as we. So what on the other hand, the z to the n minus one, or going to be a n times a n times z minus one. Oh, a n plus an minus one, which is still there plus a n plus a.
00:22:11.304 - 00:22:42.214, Speaker A: Notice that this is really quite fun. We wanted to get, we wanted things to be just equal to the unit at the .1 on the circle, right? Well, it seems to me that that's what's happening. That equals one. So we still have the sum of all the answer. That's one. Okay, so, oh, we have a, we have a one here.
00:22:42.214 - 00:23:34.144, Speaker A: Okay, but that doesn't matter because that's at least it's a convex number. So, so we have this, this final matrix, which is a now degree n minus one. Polynomial coefficients. Well, the coefficients are in two by two matrices over a. Except the, when evaluating z equals one, such a .1 on the circle, we don't, we get a scalar. Three of the terms are scalar.
00:23:34.144 - 00:24:06.434, Speaker A: This one is still zero. The upper right is still zero, lower left is one. They're all one except the two ones down the diagonal and zero for right. And then one over left. Well, if we can just multiply, that's a scalar matrix invertible. We just multiply to look at the constant curve equal to that matrix modified by the inverse. And we have something that's equal to units everywhere.
00:24:06.434 - 00:25:02.494, Speaker A: Sorry. It belongs to two by two matrices of a everywhere. And it's of course the connective component, so it doesn't deformation of the original curve. Okay, so that's the, we can do it once, we can do it any, any number of times. What is it we did modify? We modified by minus z to the n minus one. Or we modified by z to n minus one and subtract. But what are you suggesting? Add one here.
00:25:02.494 - 00:25:31.974, Speaker A: So you think, okay, well now we've got to modify two things that are not monomials. Right. Can you do. You've done that? Yeah. Well, okay, that's, that's neat. Yeah. And, um, let's multiply this by.
00:25:31.974 - 00:26:12.524, Speaker A: We want to multiply with the factors, multiply it by z to the n minus one. Minus one. And you're saying that that's equal to one. Oh, no. By the way, when we do the row reduction, this doesn't change. If we do a column reduction on acting on this column, then when we're finished, the other column gets changed. But this one is the same.
00:26:12.524 - 00:27:02.704, Speaker A: Okay, but if you did modify by z minus one, the question is whether does it still give you one here when z equals one? Okay, well, that's, that's quite. I'd say that's quite tricky, and that's very nice. So why don't we leave that for people to check if they would. Okay. Maybe it's ahead of the game, but if you would like to have it, this would be a little more direct hindsight. So, thinking you have, you have something off diagonal. Scalar value matrix.
00:27:02.704 - 00:27:57.234, Speaker A: Convertible. Sort of unclear. It's nice to get exactly on the button the first time. Okay, but let's, let's take a look at what it is. Linear polynomial. It could happen. Very unlikely, I guess, approximation of the interval after you modify through.
00:27:57.234 - 00:28:27.824, Speaker A: So if you're going to get a linear polynomial, that means that before you model, before you modify through by a power of z from the Laurent polynomial, it's going to be a polynomial in negative degree. So actually, uh. And it can't be like. And it must be just negative degree one. Okay. Um. And so, um.
00:28:27.824 - 00:29:24.974, Speaker A: But in that case, you might just as well if it's already has no, there are no positive moments. You might just work with a negative one. That's perfectly good to do. We don't really have to. Modifying by powers at the beginning is unnecessary. Well, in 30 cases. But one way or the other, either sort of given way those place or work for hard.
00:29:24.974 - 00:29:56.580, Speaker A: That was hard work, right? Not just ten years ago. Less than that for you and more than that for me. Right. But with the hard work then and hard work now, we're not finished because we're perfectionists. We want to have a most elegant approach, the one that we want to go to a lot of trouble to save a little trouble. This is a worthy endeavor. Again, sure.
00:29:56.580 - 00:31:03.382, Speaker A: No, definitely. Okay, so what do we do if it's a linear polynomial? And clearly, that's what we're looking for. The forward maps work with linear polynomial. So the implication is that any with the homotopy classes in matrix algebra? Arbitrary. Okay, so what do we do, by the way? Let's just make a rough plan for next week. Last week. Monday.
00:31:03.382 - 00:31:26.096, Speaker A: And there's Wednesday. Then there's makeup Monday. Kind of a hypothetical Monday. Visionary Monday happens to be this year. It happens to be on a Thursday. Be very confused. Wouldn't it be confusing if makeup Monday were on a Monday? I suppose the Monday part of it.
00:31:26.096 - 00:32:40.952, Speaker A: The Monday sort of part of the name thanksgiving is on a Monday. I don't know anyone that has the Thanksgiving dinner on the. Thank you. So I did suggest that if someone wanted to discuss the proof of the factor theorem, they could do that on the third number of proof. Maybe everyone could come with their favorite proof of joint operator or for a. For a normal operator or unitary officer. Normal operator.
00:32:40.952 - 00:33:24.474, Speaker A: That has to be on a complex joint or attorney on it, too. Joint one works independently without even using the fundamental theorem. Fundamental theorem. Complex analysis. Complex analysis. That's what we're coming to. We're working over the complex scalers now.
00:33:24.474 - 00:34:09.752, Speaker A: We're going to use that. Don't forget, the theorem isn't even true over the real theorem. Right. And this, this map makes everything we've done so far, it doesn't use complex theorem. And I don't think it's the injectivity alone. That depends on the complexity of. Well, the injectability for complex.
00:34:09.752 - 00:36:34.130, Speaker A: For the complex number, we have a curve, starts off as they did on the diagram. Proof of that takes the determinants of it, brings it back to one by one. Matrices and elementary theory, very elementary. Number is going to vary. Very. So how many people have studied complex analysis? Good for the ones that have something called the holomarkic functional calculus, just like the special theorem is the continuous functional console operator defined on the real line. Continue continuous functions, continuous in the continuous function.
00:36:34.130 - 00:37:56.044, Speaker A: If you move the continuous functions continuously and the super norm operator, you get the plug. And if you have a polynomial, or if you plug in a plug operator into a polynomial, you don't need. Not on the whole line. Well, if it's not a normal operator, then you can still apply functional calculus. You can apply a polynomial. You can always just do anything into a polynomial as long as you can add and multiply of any algebra. Polynomial coefficient in the field.
00:37:56.044 - 00:39:31.516, Speaker A: Again, the elements of the algebra, it's a complex field of the complex number. We talked about a boundary operator, but then the, by the way, in the element, you don't just have to operate function doesn't have to be continuous on the interval from minus the norm of the element to the norm of the element. It's enough that it'll be continuous on the spectrum of this given shell for doing. Why am I saying that? Well, I'm saying that because in the present setting we want to do a work with holomorphic function that are holomorphic. Not so, not so. It might be that the element has a certain norm, and that is looking at a disc in the complex plane with radius, the norm of the element. Then you might look at functions.
00:39:31.516 - 00:41:17.524, Speaker A: What's true if you have functions that are polymorphic, some open set containing, strictly containing the, the unit, and then you can plug in your, plug in the element of any complex manic algebra. By the way, this is has the same properties, it's a polynomial, and it's obvious what you got. And a bunch of polymorphic functions will converge uniformly on every compact subset. They all are defined on some open set containing some fixed compact sets uniformly on every, on every fixed compact set, which is contained even from the containment, all the means of hormorphism. In fact, maybe I do want to have a fixed open where they're all polymorphic. And then you look at the convergence to be uniform, and then you pick compacts contain the mass. In that case, the function, the elements of the Banach algebra, the elements of the complex Banach algebra, you get that plugging in the given element in your sequence functions according to this, which is unique with this continuity property.
00:41:17.524 - 00:42:49.504, Speaker A: Continuity property is in this setting, it converges beyond convergence, just like with the continuous functions converging in the Fibonacci on the subject doesn't have to be as large as it has to be now, it's not enough just to be holomorphic. It doesn't quite make sense. The spectrum is a compact set, right? Doesn't quite make sense. It doesn't quite make sense to possibly holomorphic on a closure. If a total mark is going to open that containing the principle of the operator, sorry, the unit ball of the plane and the operator, static algebra, then you can, I don't want to have to write the formula for the old, for the elements on the board. Okay? But you can do it. Okay, instead of a scalar, right? Well, instead of the, here in this presentation, instead of the scalar, you put an element.
00:42:49.504 - 00:43:42.450, Speaker A: But no, there's a better, remember, for the continuous functional calculus, you could do it for the interval going from minus the norm to plus the norm. You also do it for the spectrum, which is smaller so it's important here, you can do it for the spectrum too, because it opens up open set containing spectrum, contact arbitrary. The fixed open test contains arbitrary, compact set, contains continuity. In many cases, you just want to use the formula. You don't have to worry about uniqueness, you just apply the formula. You have to want to know the map from the functions to the element. Plugging in the element into the function.
00:43:42.450 - 00:44:23.540, Speaker A: This is multiplicative. Maybe I didn't forgot to mention that. Take a product of two holomorphic functions and plug in each one of them, plug in into the product. Then you get the same thing. Why is that important? That's important because if the holomorphic function is zero, if the values on the open set are just zero or one, then it's equal to its square. Okay? That means that if you plug the operator in, plug the banic out of the element in, that's going to be equal to its square too. So you got your item potent.
00:44:23.540 - 00:45:07.344, Speaker A: That's how you get the p. But how many holomorphic functions are there with all values only zero and one? Well, yes. Yeah, well, that's if the domain of holomorphy is a simply connected open set. That's why I'm not finished yet. Okay, you can have two, you can have two open sets instead. But then two open sets will not contain the. They won't help covering the unit disk, right? But they will help covering the spectrum.
00:45:07.344 - 00:45:59.514, Speaker A: So what we want to do is show that this linear polynomial, it's the spectrum for every event, every value is n the spectrum. We want to show that the spectrum is contained in always in two or three open set, disjoint open set. Then we can take a holomorphic function, which is zero here and one here. It'll be holomorphic on an open set containing the spectrum. That's how you do it. Does that make sense? Okay, so you see why I gave them a big feel about. The easiest thing is if you take the whole connect the connected set containing the spectrum joint case, the interval combine is robust.
00:45:59.514 - 00:47:07.252, Speaker A: And in the spanish algebra setting, you take the ball of radius, the normal. That's just fine if all you want to do is plug in, plug your element into some holomorphic functions on the whole disc. But if it's not holomorphic on the whole disk. So what happens here? What's a good exercise? Look what we know. But by the way, we know that, we know that a zero, a zero plus a one is equal to one, right? So what this is, is one minus a one plus a one z one minus a plus a z. And that's exactly the same as this, except instead of the p, we just have an a. And we'd like to show that the, we'd like to show that the spectrum of the a spectrum of the a sits inside two open sets, two disjoint open sets, one of them containing zero and one of them containing one.
00:47:07.252 - 00:47:30.290, Speaker A: Then we're different. Well, that's a good exercise. Apply it for complex numbers. Just take a to be a complex number and z to be the usual z complex number of f value one. Suppose that this is. So it's invertible, right? That's the condition. Suppose this is non zero.
00:47:30.290 - 00:48:14.154, Speaker A: Non zero for any z. Can you prove that the a must lie in through this joint open chain, one in one must lie in one of two fixed universal open disjoint opens up. Okay, that's a, it's probably too easy for it's all very elementary. So it's complex. It's not complex analysis. It's complex, okay? At high school, at high school level, someone learns about complex numbers, addition and multiplication as a simple answer. That's why I'm not, that's why I, trying to hide it, make it look more material.
00:48:14.154 - 00:49:27.644, Speaker A: Okay, but that's how it goes. And, but it's enough by way. By what? Working the spectrum in Banach algebra, the problem reduces to prove the spectrum is in the union of two disjoint open text universal well, the, if a is an element of a Banach algebra over complex number, then the spectrum of this element prefix this, the spectrum is just the set of. Put lambda in the spectrum of a. That's a set of one minus lambda plus lambda z, where lambda is in the spectrum. I'm showing what's called the mapping theorem. True for sex and true for holomorphic functions and true for continuous functions.
00:49:27.644 - 00:50:14.554, Speaker A: But we don't need that. But that elementary the second spectrum of polynomial, polynomial in a single important, it's important to be a community balance between one minus a community or something in the spectrum of this to fix it. It's exactly the same as being one minus lambda plus lambda z. Okay, well, that's for today. Yeah.
