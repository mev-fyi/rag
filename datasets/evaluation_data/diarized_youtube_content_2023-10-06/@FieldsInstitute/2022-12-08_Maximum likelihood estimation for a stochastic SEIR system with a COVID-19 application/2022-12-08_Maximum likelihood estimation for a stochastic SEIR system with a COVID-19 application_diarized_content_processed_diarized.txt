Professor Fernando Balthazar Larios. He the professor schercher of Department of Mathematics de la Faculte des Science Epidemiology. Today's talk will be on maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic SEI or system with a Covid-19 application. Covid business professor, thank you for accepting our invitation and the floor is yours. Professor Fernando, can you.
00:02:54.314 - 00:03:29.964, Speaker B: Okay, sorry. Thank you for the introduction and thank you very much for the invitation. It is absolute pleasure to be here. Okay. Today I will present a stochastic version of the cell model. It's maximum likelihood estimator for some parameters, and an application of this model to Covid-19 with data from Mexico City. This is based on joint work with Francisco Elgato and Taul Dias Infanti.
00:03:29.964 - 00:04:31.384, Speaker B: Right. This is the structure of the talk for today. First, I will present the motivation or some motivation for the work, the inclusion and some previous works. After, I will present the version of the stochastic model that we the deterministic version after the corresponding stochastic version. In the third section, I will talk about a method for obtaining estimators of some crucial parameters and their properties. Here in simulation study section, I will present a simulation study to calibrate the method. And finally, I will show a feed of this model to data from Covid-19.
00:04:31.384 - 00:06:16.024, Speaker B: Okay, I want to start giving some motivation for develop the version of the stochastic model presented in this talk. Parameter calibration of epidemiological models with data is a demanded but a crucial task. The current Covid or the past COVID pandemic has revealed the complexity and developing epidemic data driven models. Models based on stochastic differential equation study the behavioral disease have the advantage of characterizing the central tendencies and this capture in their formulation the random variability of the data and therefore quantify the uncertainty that is naturally related to the parameters or phenomena. On the other hand, when you have epidemic stochastic models based on the stochastic differential equation, in general it's noisy, have good estimators for its parameters. So we want an epidemic stochastic model based on stochastic differential equation. To that we can obtain its good estimators and fit this to real data from Covid-19 what about the contribution? We first took a deterministic shape model, perturbed this and obtained the corresponding stochastic version.
00:06:16.024 - 00:07:59.384, Speaker B: After we develop a good estimation of the model for some crucial parameters, the next step is we illustrate our methodology by simulation and finally we calibrate the stochastic version, a model with the data of symptomatic reported and confirmed cases in the Mexico City. Okay, there are previous works that consider epidemic stochastic model based on the stochastic differential equation. In particular, there are words that report estimation for models, but using a a more simpler structure. For example the SIS model and with only a present numerical experiment of synthetic nature, complex stochastic models similar to the one considered here that only studied the theoretical basis of a presentation numerical simulation, but without estimation methods and words about the same model. For example. Sorry, give me a moment. For example, Gangusan focused on the calibration parameters by adaptative MCNC and extended Kalma filter method Hota report other biosian techniques.
00:07:59.384 - 00:09:05.450, Speaker B: Rios Gutierrez applied the maximum likelihood method and finally Otunaga reports parameters estimation with local methods of moments. But all these works is for different version of the same model considered here. Okay, now I present the version of a stochastic shape model. We use a common deterministic structure that has been applied for Covid-19 our formulation splits the according to the following compartments. The first compartment is subtitled the class s. This compartment denotes the population members on the risk of contagious. The next class is exposit.
00:09:05.450 - 00:10:16.766, Speaker B: Members of this class come from the s class and represent the population fraction that hosts but cannot transmit the virus and after a period of days or time period, these people developed the faculty to spread this virus and became infected. A symptomatic infected class. In this class or this class they know the population infraction and the spreads the virus. But these guys not developed symptoms or maybe mild symptoms symptomatic infected. This represents the Covid-19 reported and confirmed cases that develop symptoms. The recovery class in this class, after a period of time, a member of the infected class entered to this compartment and to become recovered and immune. And finally the d class death.
00:10:16.766 - 00:11:22.484, Speaker B: Here we count the cases that dies due to Covid-19. Okay. With this compartment we obtain the following deterministic system of equations where mu is represent the natural uh, death and birth rate. Beta S is the symptomatic infection rate beta a is the asymptomatic infection rate. Kappa is here and is the transfer rate from the exposed class to the infected stage and p is the proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Obviously one p is the proportion of symptomatic individuals. Theta is the proportion of symptomatic individuals who die by the virus.
00:11:22.484 - 00:13:21.524, Speaker B: Alpha A is the symptomatic recovery rate and alpha S is the sorry. Alpha A is the asymptomatic recovery rate and alpha s is the corresponding symptomatic recovery rate. And finally gamma gamma is the decide in unity and rate and this is the deterministic system following the description of the compartments in the next section. Now I present the parametric estimation for this case using biogestian propose in this case and in the stochastic case too, we only focus and underestimate the three parameters. P the proportion of asymptomatic people beta a and beta s the infection rate. To calibrate parameters of this deterministic base we deploy MCmc by counting the cumulative incidence of new infected and reported symptomatic cases and we denote by xt these cumulative incidence time table and suppose that its profile follows a Poisson lambda t with min lambda t. And following the ideas of Acuna and Segarra, we propose the priors for p and betas and cumulative report confirmed cases in the Mexico City.
00:13:21.524 - 00:14:49.204, Speaker B: With this size of population, the biasian estimation results in these values. And now I present the estimation. You remember that I only estimate the betas and the p the other parameters. We took this work. Okay. Now we take the deterministic model and perturb the natural death rate and obtain the stochastic version. There are many words about the epidemic modeling with stochastic differential equations that pertures the infection rate but we proceed in different direction because we want reduce the estimator for the infection the infection rates by minimizing the underlying livelihood and we need a tractable form for the diffusion sorry for the likelihood function.
00:14:49.204 - 00:17:26.956, Speaker B: We perturb the natural rate because the role of this parameter is particularly important with the demographic process as burial death are significant. It is well known that the introduction of a new mortal and contagious disease modifies these processes. But when the disease is in the starting phase, these demographic processes tend to experimental small fluctuations and with this we can propose the following hypothesis. The number of deaths in the context of the regarding pandemic can be estimated as random fluctuations of the natural death rate. Then we describe this rotation with the inclusion of the conveniently stochastic processes for my objective with it as a good idea the perturbation with standard window processes and with this approach we obtain a track table stochastic formulation to deduce the explicit estimators for the parameters of interest because p. Then we perturb the natural mortality rate mu by a standard by a standard standard binary process wut with a noise intensity sigma and we obtain the follow stochastic system where we normally sign with respect to the size of population n and obtain this system is the system or the version the stochastic version based on the previous deterministic system. What about the advantage of this version? First, we know that because the model copless mortality rate mu in all compartments, this perturbation implicitly captures random fructation from all compartments.
00:17:26.956 - 00:19:57.794, Speaker B: And second, this particulant forms allows to reduce a closet for for the underlying light liquid function and modulate variance of the solution, but the noise intensity. And finally there are existence and uniqueness of the solution in a compact time intervals from zero to t on the conditions on the coefficients of the each stochastic differential equation component. Okay, now I will present the statistical inference. First I describe the methodology. First, we assume that the true values of the parameters of interest, in this case four parameters, because p and the noise sigma are constant. But to estimate the parameters of the function sigma we can use the quadratic variation over time interval of the processes of system of stochastic differential equations. After by applying Lamperty's transformation to each component, we can rewrite the stochastic differential equation as a system where all the function parameters are one and we can apply the gearsanode formula for the new system and we can obtain the likelihood function and the corresponding maximum likelihood estimation for the rest of parameters betas and p to estimate the parameter of the fusion, we can use the quadratic variation over time intervals zero to t of the process of the system of the stochastic differential equation.
00:19:57.794 - 00:21:37.904, Speaker B: In this case, the quadratic variation over t is denoted by this notation. Sorry, I can mark. Okay, no problem. And this is the when this expression, we can obtain the estimation for the diffusion parameter and by maximizing the log likelihood with respect the corresponding beta, we have the following maximum likelihood estimator and we can observe that these parameters depend on the diffusion parameter and observation of all classes of the population. And now the similar form. By maximizing the log likelihood with respect to p, we have the corresponding maximum likelihood estimation for push the corresponding estimator is this and in this case we can observe that this parameter depending on the diffusion parameter and observation of all classes of the population and the other parameters of system. In particular the parameter kpa kappa kappa, remember is the transfer rate.
00:21:37.904 - 00:24:10.154, Speaker B: Now to prove a consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood parameters, we will make the following hypothesis, this hypothesis, in other words, give me the conditions to estimate parameters in a ground phase. The outbreak under these conditions, the s class, the s population, the susceptible population decreased while the exposed and infected classes are in the ground phase. And now under test hypothesis we obtain the following theorem. We have consistency result of the maximum likelihood estimation. If you want, you can see the ties of the proof of this theorem in this work, this paper. Okay, now I present the calibration of the method and for this we use the Milstein method to generate a path of processes of the stochastic system in time interval zero t and we apply the expression of the previous section to estimate first sigma and after the corresponding maximum likelihood estimation for betas and p. Then using the Milsen method, we divide the interval from zero to ten to this case t into n sub intervals of the same length and we obtain the observation of each process at the same time and using these parameters we simulate 1000 data sets in the interval from zero to one and we use these values for betas, p, sigma and this discretization.
00:24:10.154 - 00:25:16.534, Speaker B: And for the other parameters we use the values of the deterministic version in the past table. Okay, the average of these data sets and the corresponding standard estimation are present. In this table we can see that we have a good estimation and this estimation have a small standard deviation. Now I present the application to real data. I start with a data description. For the data description we use the data set of new symptomatic and confirmed Covid-19 reported cases daily in Mexico City. Considering that its population is this population.
00:25:16.534 - 00:28:42.004, Speaker B: It was the population on March 10, 2020. The pandemic started in Mexico. The data set the data set contains 47 records in the period from March 10 to April 25 of 2020 and we use these records, denoted by ISO, to construe the observation of the process infected, symptomatic infected and combining this observation and the milstain method we can generate the other four processes of the system with the parameters of table table one. Table one is the parameters of the deterministic case sigma, this value for sigma and this discretization. We use this algorithm to generate the data set data set for the other four processes. In step one we need to choose the initial values of the other four compartment and we use we took the first two classes of the deterministic case e and ia and the symptomatic infection in this case 74 is the number of symptomatic and confirmed Covid-19 report in Mexico City on March 10 and I take the recovered zero pinpoint and the complement is susceptible and in the step two we generate the brownian increment and using the parameters of the deterministic model and the observer systematic class we generate the other four classes with the step using the step from step three to step six until have the 47 record for the five classes. Okay then using the describe methodology in the previous algorithm to generate the data and apply the expression corresponding, we can calculate the estimation for sigma, betas and p and this is the result and we generate and repeat 1000 times and we obtain 1000 data sets using the data of Mexico City and in this table gives the average of the estimators and the corresponding confidence interval.
00:28:42.004 - 00:30:47.952, Speaker B: Now I present the evidence these words well, this figure shows the average and the 19 five confidence interval of the 1000 pounds of the cumulative new symptomatic and confirmed Covid-19 report case from Mexico City. We can note that the new estimation followed the git data profile in the closer way than the corresponding Biosian calibration. This is the comparison between the biasian biasian is for the deterministic case and MCMC is for sorry for maximum likelihood estimation is for the stochastic version and quarter all observation drop in the corresponding confidence interval only for the a maximum likelihood and this suggests that this proposed methodology and the stochastic extension improves the for this data set. And finally, I present the validation of the model. To validate the stochastic model we compute the residuals corresponding to data or report and confirmation Covid-19 the objective is to show that the residuals are gaussians. If this is the case, then the noise w in the stochastic model won't be consistent with the brownian motion. And we can conclude that the residuals are gaussian.
00:30:47.952 - 00:31:12.184, Speaker B: So the models fit well. This is the cuckoo plot, the theoretical quantity versus a sample quantile and the sources, and we can model fields well. And that's all. Thank you very much.
00:31:13.404 - 00:31:37.144, Speaker A: Thank you very much, professor, for this great talk. And it's time for the questions. I think there was a question from Mohammed Khalifi about what is your time unit that you used a question in the chat?
00:31:42.034 - 00:31:44.794, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I was actually asking.
00:31:44.834 - 00:31:51.734, Speaker B: About the time unit is for, is a day, for the, for the.
00:31:55.114 - 00:31:55.474, Speaker A: For.
00:31:55.514 - 00:32:04.904, Speaker B: The real data, we use the hub records or day by day.
00:32:07.964 - 00:32:47.604, Speaker A: Okay, so, uh, is there any other question? Okay, uh, I have a question about, uh, stochastic. There's a part of stochastic modeling with Markov chain regime switching. So I don't, I don't know if you have experience with the estimation of such as model. Do you have any comments on how to deal with those type of stochastic differential equations with the regime switching?
00:32:55.344 - 00:33:32.224, Speaker B: I only work with the stochastic differential equation with the random random effects. Is some similar but not specific with the switch or markup and hidden models, but it's more complicated. But we need use another technique, for example, the EM algorithm or maybe amba technique.
00:33:34.204 - 00:33:38.624, Speaker A: So I think there is another question from Mohammed Khalifi.
00:33:39.364 - 00:33:46.244, Speaker C: Yeah. Sir, can you please reshare again your presentations this slide?
00:33:46.284 - 00:33:48.744, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:49.784 - 00:33:57.684, Speaker C: It would be nice if you go back to the first estimation algorithm. I mean, where you.
00:33:59.704 - 00:34:01.044, Speaker B: Deterministic case.
00:34:01.664 - 00:34:16.343, Speaker C: Yeah, not that case, but the Biogen case where you put some assumptions on the incidents and just go back. Go back to your slides. Okay.
00:34:17.203 - 00:34:17.943, Speaker B: Here.
00:34:18.243 - 00:34:20.943, Speaker C: No, but go back, please.
00:34:23.163 - 00:34:25.503, Speaker B: You tell me where.
00:34:26.203 - 00:34:38.627, Speaker C: Just go, just go back. I will stop you when you reach. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:38.675 - 00:34:39.219, Speaker B: Here.
00:34:39.371 - 00:35:21.524, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So I'm just wondering, here you have x is the incidence. Yeah, it's, I mean, yeah, it's poissonian distributed with the mean lambda t. And here you have lambda t. You are just integrating one minus p. You know, is that the probability of an exposed individual to be symptomatic, isn't it? So this means that this. You are just assuming.
00:35:21.524 - 00:36:14.174, Speaker C: Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I see here is that you are just assuming that only symptomatic individuals who are responsible in generating new infections. So what about the others, the asymptomatic individuals? And we know that you know, for Covid-19 there is a, I mean, we have a long, I mean, it's hard to say if it's a big portion of new infections become pre symptomatic before, before even developing or show symptoms. But also we have another part of asymptomatic infections, so it's hard to neglect their effects or their contribution in generating infections.
00:36:15.274 - 00:37:08.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree, but it's previous words and I don't sure if your proposal is better, but I don't have arguments to defend this. But I agree, this prior sounds very large for the asymptomatic people, but we only take the previous words based on the records of Mexico City.
00:37:10.914 - 00:37:15.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, yeah, you can just maybe modify your assumption.
00:37:16.914 - 00:37:17.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:17.282 - 00:38:22.326, Speaker C: By including also asymptomatic individuals and would be better if you extend your model to have like a presumptuumatic phase. So that would be also interesting. Also this assumption of uniform probability of being asymptomatic, you know, if you have, for instance, like a population of 100 people put within a closed room or a closed space, and you have enough, uh, resources to track their prevalence situation at the time, you can realize who is and what is the proportion of asymptomatic individuals. And right now we have no, I mean, we have a lot of uncertainty about the parameters. So I was also looking forward to see how much the uncertainty that you will get about B. But it looks like, I mean, you have, it looks like quite narrow the standard interval, I mean. Yeah, just the world interval for your estimation of P.
00:38:22.326 - 00:38:26.878, Speaker C: That's, I mean, yeah, that would be interesting to.
00:38:27.006 - 00:38:31.514, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's very, very good observation. Thank you.
00:38:34.294 - 00:39:07.274, Speaker A: Thank you, Mohammed. Is there any question, so I have a question regarding if you have, in case you have a data with jumps and how can you fit those type of data to data to the epidemic model or any type of model with such kind of data, how can you detect those jumps in order to, to fit them to the model?
00:39:08.494 - 00:39:47.254, Speaker B: Jones, maybe. You talking about the stochastic differential equation with Jones? Yeah, yeah, it's possible I have some words about the inference, stochastic inference for this kind of processes, but not in using this type of data. I only work in the, for the price of the stocks.
00:39:49.114 - 00:39:54.082, Speaker A: Okay, that's good. So maybe it will be agreed for extension.
00:39:54.258 - 00:39:56.898, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good idea.
00:39:56.986 - 00:40:28.994, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Is there any other question? If there isn't, thank you very much, professor, for this great talk. And it was nice to see such estimation for the stochastic differential equations. That's a great field to work on and also as an application for epidemiology. It's great.
