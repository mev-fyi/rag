00:00:15.880 - 00:00:17.074, Speaker A: Why don't I try that?
00:00:17.414 - 00:00:18.158, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:18.286 - 00:00:21.554, Speaker A: You know, it would help if there was a little more light in this room.
00:00:21.974 - 00:00:24.754, Speaker B: It's interesting.
00:00:25.554 - 00:00:37.898, Speaker A: I guess people don't have to take notes on paper. If you have a piece of paper, can you see it? You can, but it's just not shining on your face.
00:00:37.946 - 00:00:38.614, Speaker B: That's.
00:00:41.154 - 00:01:24.964, Speaker A: I can imagine them. A whole bunch of happy faces. That's accurate. Anyway, it changes all the time. One thing I wanted to do today was just draw to your attention some articles written some time ago about Israel Halpern and referring to von Neumann.
00:01:34.664 - 00:01:35.444, Speaker B: There's.
00:01:37.144 - 00:01:47.136, Speaker A: An obituary of the Ronald Star, which I have a copy of. You have to otherwise subscribe to look at it.
00:01:47.160 - 00:01:47.804, Speaker B: I think.
00:01:51.304 - 00:02:40.524, Speaker A: It'S also one in the golden Mail, too. So what you can see, it's very insured. There was a. 23 years ago, in the year 2000, there was a industry of the outstanding newspaper in financial Times of London, which is called the financial problem. And I've read you an article, just one article, from lots of publications every year have a. This is old fashioned language, but every year they have a man of the year. Maybe it's also different now, different ideas of what the word man refers to.
00:02:40.524 - 00:03:43.494, Speaker A: I mean, the historical television series, the ascent of man, I don't think that would be the same. If you see the ascent of person, every year there's a particular person picked out often, and maybe once every hundred years, there's a particular effort goes into picking up a person in the year 2000. The Financial Times took it on themselves. The man of the millennium. Okay, well, that was someone that Israel Helper and spend a lot of time studying.
00:03:45.794 - 00:03:52.658, Speaker B: Work. So I.
00:03:52.786 - 00:04:27.390, Speaker A: And I also have a interview with Israel Halpern. It's part at something called Princeton mathematics community in the 1930s. You can look it up. Just type that in on the computer. It's Albert Tucker from here. And he was a professor at Princeton. And he interviewed large number, extensive interviews.
00:04:27.582 - 00:04:28.954, Speaker B: Large number of.
00:04:31.134 - 00:04:48.054, Speaker A: People associated with Princeton, Princeton mathematics department in the 1930s. This is an interview with Princeton University on 20 different day, 19 interviewers over topic.
00:04:50.554 - 00:04:51.130, Speaker B: So.
00:04:51.242 - 00:05:14.668, Speaker A: Well, it's a whole week. I'd use up all week reading it to you, but it would give time well spent that week, because it would get you to do. I think it would. I think you might find it inspiring. Okay, so let me just read the first couple.
00:05:14.796 - 00:05:20.148, Speaker B: First couple of questions. Doctor, would you.
00:05:20.196 - 00:05:58.434, Speaker A: Would you tell me how it was that you came to Princeton as a graduate student? Well, I came in 1933. Prior to that, I had done years graduate work at University of Toronto for the master's degree, before the end of that year, I applied to a number of institutions in the United States, graduate schools of higher. I was accepted to several places, including Princeton. So it was just a case of choosing which I convert, since one of Toronto's graduates, Albert Tucker, had gone to Princeton. That was a place that I knew something about.
00:06:00.694 - 00:06:01.358, Speaker B: Tucker.
00:06:01.446 - 00:06:19.666, Speaker A: There was a second one. Oh, and that's true. But Albert Tucker had not only been there, but he, by this time, had taken his PhD and gone on to higher things. The reputation of the Princeton staff had become rather solid at Toronto. Yes, they were. The second one, Malcolm Robertson, in the.
00:06:19.690 - 00:06:23.974, Speaker B: Course of doing his PhD, that was.
00:06:24.354 - 00:06:44.774, Speaker A: By the way, there's a math department has an award named after. That was enough for me. It was also so that another student with whom I was in close touch with the close friends, had an offer to go to Princeton.
00:06:44.814 - 00:06:45.914, Speaker B: To do graduate.
00:06:47.774 - 00:07:09.384, Speaker A: Yes. Together, we decided we were like. You remember your first days at Princeton? Oh, yes, of course. We were very poor. We were all very poor in those days. Was there any difference now? And we came by bus. We arrived at the bus station at the edge of Princeton, as it was then.
00:07:09.384 - 00:07:15.616, Speaker A: So I phoned Al Tucker and said, we're here. What should we do? He said, stay right there.
00:07:15.640 - 00:07:16.444, Speaker B: I'll come.
00:07:16.984 - 00:07:20.888, Speaker A: So he came and took us to a place where we could have a room. He had been there, a place called.
00:07:20.936 - 00:07:25.684, Speaker B: Brown hall residence Theological Cemetery.
00:07:26.734 - 00:08:10.330, Speaker A: Of course, by then, Tucker, of course, by then, fine hall was in use. Fine hall opened for business in the fall of 1931. It was very interesting that to those who had been there, this was a rather new building. To someone like myself who had just arrived, it might as well have been there 100 years. From whom did you take courses in your first year? Do you remember? Oh, I remember very well. I got the impression I wasn't taking courses. I hope nobody here gets that in person, but those of us who were in our first year of graduate work were apparently expected to take Luther P.
00:08:10.330 - 00:08:20.434, Speaker A: Eisenhardt's tensor calculus course. When I started that course, it was all very dull, because I had been through all of this with singing. No one else singing in Toronto.
00:08:23.694 - 00:08:26.074, Speaker B: Yeah, well, okay. Well.
00:08:31.054 - 00:09:13.434, Speaker A: The obituary is arresting. A beautiful mind and crusading spirit. Award winning mathematician Wright's champion never got tired of seeking truth. By Catherine Dunfin. Isabella Hoffman had a beautiful mind, one of the finest of its generation that flourished in pure mathematics, the only discipline in the world in which something is either right or it is not. There is nothing approximate about mathematics that help bring son and Steve also a mathematician. That's correct.
00:09:13.434 - 00:09:25.934, Speaker A: It is forever. That's why you have to keep checking. It is also a challenge because it is harder to do.
00:09:29.434 - 00:09:29.794, Speaker B: Well.
00:09:29.834 - 00:10:14.714, Speaker A: Some things are impossible. That's what good will prove. Steve Halpern is dean of the College of Science at the University of Maryland. His brother Bill is the John Edmonds professor of physics at Northwestern University. Her sisters Mary and Connie are a medical doctor and head of the Terry Fox research lab in Vancouver. Okay, we'll take the one of our recent things.
00:10:24.454 - 00:10:28.022, Speaker B: But one of the recent.
00:10:28.078 - 00:11:45.804, Speaker A: Things we've discussed is how's the word moment as this interesting relationship? These are the like anything you have to keep revisiting and usually impossible to number crunch everything all at once. Just review briefly one of the main questions. You have ordered ring and what we're thinking of is the important case thinking of is the Pascal triangle. It's an ordered group. You put copy of z for every point and then the reading of the edges you interpret as maps multiplying by.
00:11:45.844 - 00:11:46.424, Speaker B: One.
00:12:00.554 - 00:12:21.194, Speaker A: Because group, and it's an order group because that is an order group. These maps are positive maps. They're also conjunctive. Every stage the map is injected z to the nth to the n plus one. You can think of as an increasing sequence for the group. The group is getting larger and the.
00:12:22.014 - 00:12:29.234, Speaker B: Positive clones getting larger and larger and.
00:12:30.814 - 00:13:48.372, Speaker A: Investigated, as I hope everyone has looked at it, has looked at it both as a group and as an order group. As a group. If you just look at the generators coming from first points and those are independent and generate the whole group. So it's an infinite drag sum of copies of group, not as an order, though the order, the order of relation is more interesting. The order of relation is, by the way, if you take the direct sum of copies of z, you can think of that as the group of polynomials with integer coefficients and as a group, that's a kind of trivial state. But once you do that allows you to multiply me. And so let's just say polynomial one squared and so on.
00:13:48.372 - 00:13:50.404, Speaker A: And here you get one minus x.
00:13:50.444 - 00:13:51.024, Speaker B: Because.
00:14:05.444 - 00:15:20.264, Speaker A: In terms of master k, roof zen, one goes to one comma, one. This is the solid one. So this one is, and this one is one minus x. Then the ring structure is recognized ring structure. Once you assign the polynomials to every point, if it's a commutative ring product, doesn't depend on the order, just ordinary multiplication polynomial and they're positive in the sense of being known sums of monoliths.
00:15:23.684 - 00:15:26.464, Speaker B: Productions.
00:15:29.124 - 00:16:04.714, Speaker A: And you have a ring has a unit, this unit one times anything. And in, furthermore, it's an order unit. If you have any, any integer is less than or equal to some positive multiple of one. And it's the same, same here. Look at the element one, comma, one. And every element here is less than or equal to some.
00:16:07.854 - 00:16:08.750, Speaker B: Multiple of that.
00:16:08.782 - 00:16:26.034, Speaker A: For instance, x is less, x is positive, and it's less than or equal to one because one minus x is positive and x plus one minus x one. Okay, but the unit is an order unit.
00:16:30.574 - 00:16:31.314, Speaker B: Well.
00:16:42.114 - 00:16:47.994, Speaker A: You have a state which is a function of r values to real.
00:16:48.034 - 00:16:51.974, Speaker B: Number of positive.
00:16:54.034 - 00:17:25.548, Speaker A: Positive elements and positive elements, additive x element of six state. Well, it's related to the word state in physics. That's already a subject for an essay. Maybe everyone has written all their essays.
00:17:25.596 - 00:17:29.324, Speaker B: On me, but they can always write more.
00:17:33.624 - 00:17:37.804, Speaker A: They don't have to be, they don't have to be theses.
00:17:40.744 - 00:17:41.264, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:41.304 - 00:17:50.164, Speaker A: So whenever you have, by the way, average two things.
00:17:52.484 - 00:17:54.544, Speaker B: Such hints is still positive.
00:17:56.884 - 00:18:05.144, Speaker A: Still equal to one on the unit convex set. And it's a compact convex set, international.
00:18:18.224 - 00:18:19.524, Speaker B: Functional center.
00:18:25.544 - 00:18:28.124, Speaker A: With compact space.
00:18:30.504 - 00:18:32.084, Speaker B: Compact contact set.
00:18:49.244 - 00:19:09.756, Speaker A: Extreme points. Screen points are important because in a compact complex step, every element is an average of screen points. And in a finite dimensional case, which is finitely many, in this particular case is what's called a simplex. We just find every many points and.
00:19:09.780 - 00:19:10.464, Speaker B: Finite.
00:19:13.844 - 00:19:41.404, Speaker A: Every point uniquely recombinant of the dream of unique point of combination. And in the infinite dimensional case, it's still true. But not only is there a measure on the dream points such as everybody, probability measurements, at every point in the set is an average three points.
00:19:43.824 - 00:19:45.324, Speaker B: Probability measure.
00:19:47.704 - 00:20:16.834, Speaker A: That'S unique. And that's how you prove, that's one way of proving the house door. Giving a solution to the house door moment problem. The first thing that the hell store moment problem gives you exclusion to it. You're given the moments.
00:20:16.914 - 00:20:18.694, Speaker B: Moments are just numbers.
00:20:19.234 - 00:20:20.650, Speaker A: You want to find a measure, then.
00:20:20.682 - 00:20:21.894, Speaker B: You have the.
00:20:24.754 - 00:20:32.222, Speaker A: Position you put on. And just to see given the integrals.
00:20:32.278 - 00:20:48.714, Speaker B: Of one overplace.
00:20:52.054 - 00:21:18.994, Speaker A: Over the space that the. And the question is, when there's a sequence of numbers, this sequence of integrals.
00:21:20.554 - 00:21:21.374, Speaker B: Measure.
00:21:25.874 - 00:22:04.774, Speaker A: Well, this is the numbers themselves, but also that they decreasing. And also the second order discrete derivatives would be decreasing. It's like Arnold's reference to the history of the late lab, the final history of the Soviet Union. Everyone knew it was on the way out because all the higher order derivatives were negative. Okay, so that's what the condition is per measure.
00:22:04.894 - 00:22:06.114, Speaker B: That's the exclusive.
00:22:08.534 - 00:22:22.884, Speaker A: You fill in all the numbers in a natural way, then they should all be positive. That says all. And since you're subtracting, this process equals that, this is smaller than that.
00:22:25.624 - 00:22:25.936, Speaker B: All.
00:22:25.960 - 00:22:27.884, Speaker A: The higher order.
00:22:29.664 - 00:22:30.632, Speaker B: Decreasing.
00:22:30.808 - 00:24:02.484, Speaker A: That's the condition that coast north discovered in a sequence, positive numbers. All right, but this is, then this is exactly a positive linear functional on the, on the ordered group. So the, in other words, the numerical pattern, that is the condition for a man, according to Hausdorff, is the condition for the numbers to rise and fall. It's precisely the purely algebraic, straightforward formulatorial point of view. It's exactly the condition that you have a state on the ordered group called a pascal. This PhD thesis had a detailed analysis triangle from the family diagram point of view, calculating the order group in terms of evaluating the polynomials on the line on the interval polynomial. It can be thought of as a function on the interval.
00:24:02.484 - 00:24:29.984, Speaker A: And all these functions, all these monomials which are considered positive in the order group, they're clearly positive, positive on the open interval. And proved the converse. If you have a polynomial which is integer coefficient, which is strictly positive on the interior interval zero one, it must be a finite sum of polynomials in x one minus x. And the print uses.
00:24:33.204 - 00:24:34.224, Speaker B: Ordered rate.
00:24:34.764 - 00:25:18.544, Speaker A: The extreme states are nonflicted and the theory of extreme states. So extreme states are more frequent. And of course they're just evaluating at the points of the interval. But we don't know that, we don't get theory. We don't know that evaluating an arbitrary point of view gives you an extreme state, but we don't matter. It doesn't matter. We don't mind, because if you have, because you get to measure anywhere for any compact complex, that there's a measure on extreme points, which you average them and you get the state.
00:25:18.544 - 00:25:33.068, Speaker A: And whether the extreme points are the whole interval or just some subset, no, it doesn't matter. Of course, at the end, when you're finally finished, you can prove that in this case that every point in integral is zero minus extreme point.
00:25:33.116 - 00:25:36.664, Speaker B: But that's extremely relevant. That's sort of a thrill.
00:25:37.084 - 00:25:56.524, Speaker A: The point, the important thing is that the extreme points are multiplicative. And that's something I wanted to pick up a couple of weeks in. Maybe, maybe you might want to think about it a little more.
00:26:03.544 - 00:26:04.232, Speaker B: Be good.
00:26:04.328 - 00:27:44.174, Speaker A: As an exercise, this implies that f is reserves, the product happens. Converse is also true in this case, because when you're absolutely finished, then you're talking about measures on the interval zero one. It's easy to prove if you have an extreme measurement, then it must be if you have a, sorry, if you have a point, if you evaluate a point, that's a measure delta function, and you can work that into what's called the theory of distributions. How many people have studied the theory of distribution? It's an important part of that line. One of Israel Halpern's publications was an elegant, short introduction to the theory of distribution. Oh, okay. So if you have a point, if evaluation at a point is an average of two measures which are not concentrated at a point, but you can.
00:27:49.594 - 00:27:49.882, Speaker B: I.
00:27:49.898 - 00:28:33.174, Speaker A: Think you can find a continuous function which is working with continuous functions. It's hard to work with polynomials, but if you're allowed to work with continuous functions, are measurable functions, then you can easily show that the evaluation of the point can't be an average of two measures which are not concentrated at point. That's a good exercise tool. What I would like to invite people to look at is a question for a general order to bring whether but.
00:28:48.274 - 00:28:49.134, Speaker B: 7Th.
00:28:52.994 - 00:30:23.110, Speaker A: Okay, so what is the I invite people to review proof of. Okay, well, that's the way to say it's good to have things to think about because I don't, I don't think my suggestions, but it's something to think about. We were looking at the, we started to look at the question of what pre existing. Taking the engine of algebra, you have to treat the sabbatical for two reasons.
00:30:23.142 - 00:30:23.794, Speaker B: Anyway.
00:30:30.894 - 00:30:33.366, Speaker A: Look at the suspension and the.
00:30:33.470 - 00:30:34.114, Speaker B: Third.
00:30:36.374 - 00:31:46.382, Speaker A: A zero of the algebra. What's this version of function along the line 20 plus or minus infinity and q would be k one of any balance k one. If you look at the also b is a bandic out k one and b is by definition it's a complex dynamic algebra. It's k one, b tilde, you join the unit.
00:31:46.438 - 00:31:48.474, Speaker B: Okay, and.
00:31:52.054 - 00:32:02.394, Speaker A: The benefits of the unit of valley calculator, it can talk about it very well.
00:32:03.154 - 00:32:03.894, Speaker B: And.
00:32:07.354 - 00:32:47.694, Speaker A: Topological, Alyssa, topology on the invertible elements where we have connected components and they're connected components forming the group of the set of invertible elements is a group. And if you look at the connector component of the unit and that is some group and it's a normal subgroup. So you take a look at capacity, the quotient, then you get the group and that's the k one group. Well that's equal to matrices too. So you look at the alpha.
00:32:52.274 - 00:32:52.610, Speaker B: Two.
00:32:52.642 - 00:33:22.214, Speaker A: By two matrices, you say that two things are equivalent connected to the unit that's connected in some larger matrix out. That's by the way, this is.
00:33:26.994 - 00:33:27.498, Speaker B: Vertical.
00:33:27.546 - 00:33:36.602, Speaker A: Elements are an open subset of the beta of the atogen. In any case, there are subsets so that they have topology.
00:33:36.698 - 00:33:43.334, Speaker B: Then that's true. That's how positive we do.
00:33:47.254 - 00:34:36.964, Speaker A: And if you divide out by the connected component, it opens up our series. It's important that we're not talking about arbitrary topological. Component of the unit is open substitute of the whole manic algebra, because the invertible is open subset of the vertical elements. You can see it just looking at the complex numbers, variable elements, nonzero one. There's no concepts and that is connected components. It's not a very good example. Matrices over the complex numbers and the vertical elements are connected.
00:34:36.964 - 00:35:11.186, Speaker A: That's a good exercise. Over the real numbers. It's not even true, particularly real bionic algebra for a real number. And what are the invertible elements? Well, again, it's the non zero you can have. If we sort of borrow this copy of the real numbers, then suspension, we don't really keep track of where the.
00:35:11.210 - 00:35:13.162, Speaker B: Zero is because we want a group.
00:35:13.338 - 00:35:50.794, Speaker A: And we keep track of where the zero is. And then the zero is not vertical. Everything else is right. But then it's take away the, that's one way of defining dimension. If it's dimension between the light and the plane, take away a point, the line is no longer connected, whereas in the plane, take away a point to open it. So that means the k, one of the real numbers.
00:35:52.734 - 00:35:54.754, Speaker B: Is grouping two elements.
00:35:55.674 - 00:36:28.354, Speaker A: Connective components of the center minus one. We're talking about convex. So if it's the, um.
00:36:31.134 - 00:36:31.566, Speaker B: It is.
00:36:31.590 - 00:37:01.926, Speaker A: A real kind of guy. When you join a unit, you have to be careful, you have to, you have to throw away the unit. You have to do the same thing as you do for defining k zero. In the complex case, you join map. Take the natural map to complex number of times the unit, and then look at, that's a map between two units allowed versus the k zero functor. Take an elementary wave, you take the.
00:37:01.950 - 00:37:03.194, Speaker B: Kernel of that map.
00:37:03.534 - 00:37:05.742, Speaker A: So that's the case there with the.
00:37:05.758 - 00:37:10.634, Speaker B: Non unit world numbers.
00:37:11.094 - 00:37:36.544, Speaker A: And it counts only real numbers as we might want to period. Anyone remember what period is? It's got to be, I'll give you a hint. It's got to be a multiple of two, because it's two in the complex case. And any complex manic algebra is a real magic algebra.
00:37:37.164 - 00:37:41.524, Speaker B: Okay, so if, if.
00:37:45.944 - 00:38:02.044, Speaker A: It'S a complex algebra, taking the suspension just flips the k zero and k one, well then if the real static algebra.
00:38:04.464 - 00:38:05.008, Speaker B: The period.
00:38:05.056 - 00:38:17.624, Speaker A: Of that which is larger, not a multiple, then two things together, they interfere, right? You'd get them eventually. Again, everything had to be the same.
00:38:22.764 - 00:38:23.864, Speaker B: You have a.
00:38:25.604 - 00:38:28.024, Speaker A: One way of expressing it is if you have a.
00:38:30.244 - 00:38:30.556, Speaker B: Look.
00:38:30.580 - 00:39:07.454, Speaker A: At the natural numbers in the semi group, and you have two semi group change. Two natural numbers are relatively prime. And then Semigoove doesn't have to be all natural. Semigroup semiconductor generated by two relatively prime number doesn't have to be everything. But it has to be, if you go far enough, it has to be everything.
00:39:09.034 - 00:39:10.374, Speaker B: There's an average number.
00:39:10.674 - 00:39:37.974, Speaker A: So you take two and three for instance. Those are relatively, right, okay, so what's the semi group they generate with multiples of two, also multiples of three, but no one gets the number one. Okay, so it's eventually. Eventually you have to work a bit to prove every, every number beyond two foot two or more. There's a multiple of two plus a multiple of three.
00:39:38.014 - 00:39:38.430, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:38.542 - 00:39:39.582, Speaker A: I guess you have.
00:39:39.758 - 00:39:41.274, Speaker B: Maybe there's little arithmetic.
00:39:43.934 - 00:40:14.274, Speaker A: Well, it's a general fact to have two relatively prime numbers in this group, but it's even a little more. And that's number theory. Then arbitrary, relatively prime natural numbers and then some sort of elementary embryonic number series generate. Well, the group they generate is everything, all linears. The semi group they generate is almost all.
00:40:15.254 - 00:40:15.994, Speaker B: Many.
00:40:18.914 - 00:40:25.174, Speaker A: Also find it in many positive. Okay, so.
00:40:28.114 - 00:40:28.934, Speaker B: We'Re.
00:40:36.834 - 00:40:38.694, Speaker A: Schematic picture right here.
00:40:42.954 - 00:40:47.264, Speaker B: On this. And then.
00:40:57.604 - 00:41:04.584, Speaker A: How many people? So I didn't finish reviewing what.
00:41:07.844 - 00:41:08.180, Speaker B: As.
00:41:08.212 - 00:41:11.444, Speaker A: A very told it was s of a is the things that vanish.
00:41:11.484 - 00:41:12.304, Speaker B: Infinity.
00:41:12.684 - 00:42:16.056, Speaker A: They told the employee unit. And since the algebra has a unit, it functions into values of a which converge to the same number at plus and minus infinity. The same complex, same complex model. What is. Abigail, what's an invertible? What's the right invertebrate? What's a reasonable invertible? Vertical. Yeah, okay, but if p is the p is zero, then maybe you'd map it into one. And if p is equal to one, maybe you map it into what you.
00:42:16.080 - 00:42:17.744, Speaker B: Map it into close.
00:42:17.784 - 00:42:26.976, Speaker A: P is the unit of a. Then what would be the invertible? What would be the. So over here, if p is zero.
00:42:27.120 - 00:42:29.044, Speaker B: Then you take the constant. Constant.
00:42:31.164 - 00:42:58.664, Speaker A: By the way, it's, this is, I'm stretching things out on the line. It's maybe better sometimes to think of the line as a circle, because when the .1 removed. And so then there's a natural. Oh, on the line you can look at the function of x. There are function t, function t. On a line, t of t equals t.
00:42:58.664 - 00:43:44.784, Speaker A: And then on the circle, you can look at the function z. So, I always learned that you shouldn't confuse the notation for the function with the notation for the variable, right? So, I always try to get it right, completely clear. Because, as you know, that's one thing. People in physics are way ahead of people in math. They have no trouble whatsoever using the same notation. Seriously, they have many. A function of many variables.
00:43:44.784 - 00:44:17.084, Speaker A: Then, as vector value function notation looks very similar, you can't tell from this notation whether it's a dependent variable or an independent variable. So then, for me. For me, when I was taking thermodynamics, basically, that's. Thermodynamics was the chain rule. Early elementary thermodynamics is basically just a chain rule, but it's applied in this setting. So, I was completely unwinded. I knew the chain rule.
00:44:17.084 - 00:44:45.904, Speaker A: Once I wrote an essay, I put everything into mathematical notation. And the physics professor said, what's this? Fortunately, it wasn't an essay that got marked. It was just that, my own sort of struggle. Well, maybe he wasn't. He wasn't rough. He wasn't. He wasn't angry.
00:44:45.904 - 00:44:48.904, Speaker A: I thought it necessary.
00:44:51.404 - 00:45:02.664, Speaker B: Okay, but look at those pictures.
00:45:03.604 - 00:45:28.826, Speaker A: And so, Abigail, does that help as any kind of hint? By the way, I suppose I don't need the circle. I could just say, look at the lap of engine function t. T is a. T is a. Oh, no. T itself is not. Doesn't converge at infinity.
00:45:28.890 - 00:45:29.306, Speaker B: Right?
00:45:29.410 - 00:45:37.144, Speaker A: You take e to the it, then that would do it, right? Because plus or minus infinity, you get.
00:45:40.444 - 00:45:41.504, Speaker B: Is that right?
00:45:42.004 - 00:45:45.184, Speaker A: No, actually that's not so good.
00:45:47.044 - 00:45:47.784, Speaker B: So.
00:45:50.684 - 00:45:52.396, Speaker A: Making the line is not so good.
00:45:52.500 - 00:45:53.304, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:54.044 - 00:46:50.624, Speaker A: Because this function is not parameterization of r as the circle minus the point. You have to stretch a bit to stretch your imagination, not align, to take the variables corresponding. I think it's better to start with the circle. Just if you're not talking about quantitative things, qualitative. The suspension is things. Again, the joint is functioned on the line which converge to a scale or same scale or plus on the circle is the same thing. Functions a value functions which converge, which extend to continuous function in the whole circle, which at the .1
00:46:50.624 - 00:46:51.404, Speaker A: is just.
00:46:52.144 - 00:46:55.644, Speaker B: One multiple gauge from the class of eight.
00:47:10.164 - 00:47:28.504, Speaker A: Charlie, does that help? Well, no, but, I mean, I'm waiting to get to say what. Someone to tell me what to write on the board. It helps, but maybe not very much. Okay. Yeah.
00:47:34.844 - 00:47:35.744, Speaker B: Okay.
00:47:36.764 - 00:47:44.564, Speaker A: You're doing the general case. I was just wondering what you would map another unit into. If you start with one, you know, that's true. Let's do.
00:47:44.724 - 00:47:46.660, Speaker B: I think it's good to get into.
00:47:46.692 - 00:48:05.434, Speaker A: The habit of starting a simple case. I'm sure you can tell me what the general case is, but I might not be able to check it right away. I might have to do a little calculation myself, whereas I know exactly what to do. You just take the unit. So, what would you do?
00:48:08.974 - 00:48:09.754, Speaker B: Sorry?
00:48:10.734 - 00:48:22.444, Speaker A: Oh, no. You're doing a lightning calculator. Okay, Charlie, do you want to take another look? What does the unit. The unit of a.
00:48:25.824 - 00:48:28.964, Speaker B: Some function.
00:48:32.384 - 00:48:52.804, Speaker A: But at the moment, a is a complex number, right? So we certainly can't involve too many complicated. This function must be this complex value function on the line, or circle function on the circle, which has complex values everywhere.
00:48:53.184 - 00:48:53.924, Speaker B: And.
00:48:56.624 - 00:49:22.090, Speaker A: Is there any. Are those. It makes a difference. They're not all connected. They're not all going to be connected to the fact. None of them is going to be. If it's not constant equal to one, then it's unlikely to be connected to the function constant equal to one.
00:49:22.090 - 00:49:41.854, Speaker A: They all might be. What about this z? I went to the trouble of working out a systematic notation, right? So why don't we try that? I'm not saying I did it. I'm not saying I did it on purpose.
00:49:41.894 - 00:49:42.598, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:42.766 - 00:50:06.814, Speaker A: Why don't we try. So, essentially, if you've got something, maybe you should use it. Why don't we try this out? Is it an element of f, sub a interpretive function? Is one negative s, or. Well, Abigail, do you want to generalized. P equals zero. P equals zero.
00:50:07.834 - 00:50:11.054, Speaker B: Zero goes to one.
00:50:12.034 - 00:50:38.022, Speaker A: What about. What about a more general? Yeah, that's invertible, right? If we just took z times p, that wouldn't be quite invertible. It would be invertible inside b. If you looked at pa, then that.
00:50:38.038 - 00:50:41.622, Speaker B: Would be invertible there. Okay.
00:50:41.798 - 00:50:48.830, Speaker A: But then you find it to be invertible to a. The cheapest way to do it is to add multiple of the unit.
00:50:48.982 - 00:50:51.954, Speaker B: One minus b times.
00:50:53.214 - 00:50:55.924, Speaker A: That's in one minus piece times a.
00:50:55.964 - 00:51:03.104, Speaker B: Times one minus piece.
00:51:08.324 - 00:51:21.956, Speaker A: Sum of the units. Even the unit of this p, the unit. This is one minus p. There's something invertible here, something invertible here. If you add them, you get something invariable in a. Okay, so this is a variable. You can just break down the.
00:51:21.980 - 00:51:22.854, Speaker B: Nice.
00:51:28.304 - 00:51:30.524, Speaker A: That's step one, that's step one.
00:51:32.704 - 00:51:35.784, Speaker B: And then step two.
00:51:35.824 - 00:52:19.816, Speaker A: It's supposed to be. It's almost supposed to be an oversimplification, but, you know, sometimes I imagine myself being one of a troublemaker. And I keep remembering what the late professor I was my AFL dramatic repetition of the exam which I was able to justify completely as very precise and want me money. Of course, if you haven't studied Greek, you know, you don't pronounce the m.
00:52:19.960 - 00:52:20.644, Speaker B: Then.
00:52:26.464 - 00:53:17.934, Speaker A: Of course who knows how it was pronounced in ancient Greece. I also learned how to pronounce ancient Latin too. Okay, so what will happen? So the first step is algebraic at the level of algebra. The second step is after you've done some work, this. Think of this as projections, if you like.
00:53:22.554 - 00:53:23.294, Speaker B: And.
00:53:25.234 - 00:53:27.734, Speaker A: Equivalents. And so you get.
00:53:32.134 - 00:53:32.638, Speaker B: You get a.
00:53:32.646 - 00:53:48.206, Speaker A: Semi group map and passing through the adulting group you got a group map, k zero a into one, well into k one of the k one of.
00:53:48.230 - 00:53:48.794, Speaker B: The.
00:53:54.254 - 00:54:08.914, Speaker A: Step two, step three, let's reject. That's where you find you need to be a vatical. Okay, let's come back to that.
