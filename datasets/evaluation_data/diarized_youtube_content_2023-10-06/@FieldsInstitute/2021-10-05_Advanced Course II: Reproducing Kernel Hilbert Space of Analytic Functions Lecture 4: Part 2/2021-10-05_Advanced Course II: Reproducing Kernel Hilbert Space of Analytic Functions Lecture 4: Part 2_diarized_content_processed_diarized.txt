00:00:00.320 - 00:00:26.498, Speaker A: So this for h, you prove that the kernel reproducing kernel is just the product of one upon this. And when we had h kernel was simply one of this factor one upon one minus omega j.
00:00:26.646 - 00:00:27.138, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:27.226 - 00:00:34.494, Speaker A: And yeah. Dimensional. And for Dn is turning out to be product.
00:00:34.914 - 00:00:35.694, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:36.114 - 00:00:45.458, Speaker A: So yeah, I'm not sure what to ask, but basically is it some kind of general phenomena which is occurring for DNA?
00:00:45.626 - 00:01:03.374, Speaker B: Yes, we will see, indeed, there are even abstract theorems a little bit in future we will see that, that in some cases the kernel is the product of the kernel of spaces. We will see this is in a sense a special case of a more general theorem.
00:01:05.634 - 00:01:08.050, Speaker A: Okay. And that we'll see later.
00:01:08.242 - 00:01:59.072, Speaker B: Yes, yes. This is a very specific example just for, just for h two. But we will see that in some, I mean, under some conditions, what would be the kernel of h one h two times hn? I mean, we need to develop some tools to arrive at this theorem later on and also give a meaning to this product. Okay, we will see. Yeah, that's one of our goals in future. No. So there is something in the chat.
00:01:59.072 - 00:03:05.364, Speaker B: Let me see. Okay, the information about the Sheldon paper. I strongly recommend you to read this and then if you are more interested, go into more specialized book. But the paper is perfect reference for this subject up to now. I mean, for almost three, even four weeks, we talk about special cases and just to show how diverse Rkhs can be. And now we go more into the direction of abstract Rkhs, we developed some tools. And so each of these tools are equally applicable to all the examples we have seen up to now and to the examples that we will see in future.
00:03:05.364 - 00:04:42.994, Speaker B: So, fundamental results. The first one is about Hilbert space structure of Rkhs. So more on Hilbert space structure of an Rkhs. A very simple proposition, but extremely useful. In many occasions we use this innocent, simple looking theorem. So, assume that h is an Rkhs on a set omega. Then the linear span of kernel functions of k y in h is dense.
00:04:42.994 - 00:05:26.860, Speaker B: That's the first version of a proposition of this time. In some spaces we can replace h here by something smaller. We do not need to consider all point of the. I wrote h of omega. We do not need to consider all point of omega to obtain something which is denser. A smaller set is enough. But that's the first version of the theorem.
00:05:26.860 - 00:06:29.384, Speaker B: And the proof is extremely easy. It's a standard Hilbert space technique, how to show that something is dense. Show that if f is orthogonal to this set, then f is zero. If we show this the whole thing is equivalent to show that the set is dense. That's a technique from Hilbert space. And now, what does it mean that f is orthogonal to ky, f orthogonal to ky. This means that f inner product of ky equal to zero.
00:06:29.384 - 00:07:09.734, Speaker B: But from the structure that we developed, we know that this means that f at point y is equal to zero. So for any y in the set, f at point y is equal to zero. So f is identically zero. As I said, the proof is extremely easy. It's just based on the definition that we had before. But it's amazing that it's a very strong tool in studying rkhs. Here is the first consequence of that.
00:07:09.734 - 00:08:43.390, Speaker B: I mean, it has the same flavor as before. Again, I pulse and call it lemma. I mean, we can call it proposition, if you like, to lemma, as before, h is always an rkhs on omega, and fn is a sequence in H. Our hypothesis is that assume that fn goes to f under the normal h. Then for every x in this set s, f at point x is equal to the limb and goes to infinity of n. Other words, convergence in H implies point wise convergence, and a bit more than that, indeed, can be said. Let's see.
00:08:43.390 - 00:10:21.704, Speaker B: The proof of this proof is again based on the identity we saw before. F at point x is given by the inner product of f and the kernel in H. Therefore, absolute value f at point x is majorized by the norm of f times the norm of kx x is fixed. So we can say that the absolute value of f of x is controlled by a constant which depends on x. This constant times the normal f. And so if we replace fn f by fn replacement f minus f n f minus f of x in h. And so if norm of f n minus f in h goes to zero, this implies that f n of X goes to f of x again.
00:10:21.704 - 00:10:43.794, Speaker B: And the proof. Two comments about this proof. It's a proof. It's. There is nothing wrong in it. But I believe such a detail is not needed, because let's go back to the statement of Lama.
00:10:46.454 - 00:10:50.874, Speaker A: Sir, we know that evaluation maps are continuous, right?
00:10:51.494 - 00:10:52.474, Speaker B: I'm sorry?
00:10:53.294 - 00:10:56.302, Speaker A: We know the evaluation maps are continuous.
00:10:56.438 - 00:11:24.684, Speaker B: Precisely. That's my first comment. No proof. The way I wrote is needed because it's hidden in the definition of RKHs that evaluations are continuous. So if FN goes to f, then fn should go to f. That's a part of the definition of rkHs. That's the first comment.
00:11:24.684 - 00:12:46.940, Speaker B: But there is another probably that's why such a proof is given? Uniform convergence is not part of the definition here. ClX that we had in the proof is the norm of kx in H. Usually this is the case. If we have a domain omega like this, and x goes toward the boundary, usually cx goes to infinity. In other words, we do not have a uniform bound for all reproducing ken. But if at least in the analytic setting, if we stay away from the frontier. So if omega prime is inside omega and supremum of kx in omega prime is a constant, which of course depend on omega prime, which is not plus infinity.
00:12:46.940 - 00:13:40.708, Speaker B: So kick x is uniformly bounded on this subset, then we can say this part and this is not. For this we need a proof. It's not part of the definition. If fn goes to f in nor, then fn converges to f of x uniformly for x in minor prime. Sometimes the old notation in some old books fn, this is the notation for uniform convergence. F uniformly goes on f on omega prime. True, this is not part of the definition.
00:13:40.708 - 00:14:38.570, Speaker B: So this proof can be useful for what I mentioned here, because again, you have the same estimation. But if you are in omega prime, you can replace cx here by constant m. And still the same thing works. And we use this usually in oversetting analytic function spaces application. In all of these spaces, at least three of them, we saw by now we saw Hardy space, irishly space and Bergman space. I mean. And to our collection you can add model spaces k theta, which are inside h two, and also weighted Dirichlet spaces.
00:14:38.570 - 00:16:11.794, Speaker B: It will come a little bit later and Dobranche rogniac spaces, which is again, they are in h two, but they are not closed. I mean, these spaces come a bit later and the list still can continue. I mean, I just focus on the main three parts. This is open unit disk. If you stay away from frontier a disk r, but r is strictly less than one on this disk. If fn goes to f in any of these spaces I mentioned above, then if n uniformly goes to f on a fixed doctor, when we repeatedly use this property in other applications of Rkhs to analytic function spaces. Okay, that's the second property and the third one, which in conjunction with the Moore theorem, probably I will not arrive at mood theorem this week, but it will be.
00:16:11.794 - 00:17:00.690, Speaker B: That's a good point to mention about canadian Thanksgiving. I will mention it not next week. The week after next week we do not have a course I will explain, but the next time that we come, a more theorem will be one of our main theorems. That I want to prove. Conjunction with this proposition shows that kernels are in one to one, a bijection between rkhs and the function. So whenever you have a space, you have a kernel, and whenever you have a kernel, you have a space. That's, that's the point I want to elaborate.
00:17:00.690 - 00:18:54.576, Speaker B: So the easy one is this one proposition. Let h one and h to be reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on a set omega with kernels k one and k two, respectively. Assume that the kernels coincide, k one x y equal to k two xy. For every x and y in the domain back, then the space both space means the space is coincide. I mean, h one is equal to h two assets, but more than that, and for every f now it's the same set. The norms are equal. Normal f in each one is equal to the normal f ing.
00:18:54.576 - 00:19:13.624, Speaker B: Of course, the other way around is trivial. If I mean, h one is equal to h two and you have an isometry, then kernels are equal. But the message here is that if the kernels coincide, you have the same thing.
00:19:18.364 - 00:19:23.134, Speaker A: So will it be just the norm equality or the inner product ultimate?
00:19:24.794 - 00:19:36.306, Speaker B: Well, when you have normic equality here or in any other setting, you can use the polarization identity.
00:19:36.490 - 00:19:37.170, Speaker A: Right?
00:19:37.322 - 00:19:44.490, Speaker B: And then this immediately implies that f and g h one is equal to.
00:19:44.642 - 00:19:50.340, Speaker A: F and g, so h one equal to h two. Edit Hilbert space itself.
00:19:50.452 - 00:20:43.638, Speaker B: Yes, precisely. If the kernels, you can summarize the theorem as this. If the kernels coincide, then they coincide as Hilbert spaces. Yes, absolutely. Well, since k one is equal to k two, I call both kick. The reason is that when I want to, for example, consider k one of x, which is k at point x and y. It's easier to write it as this way than write it as well.
00:20:43.638 - 00:21:53.944, Speaker B: It's k one of x by two. If I want to write it as this way, it would be k one, then y. It's a bit difficult to write it this way, so that is why I introduce k. And whenever I write it as a kernel function, it can be interpreted either as a kernel in a space h one or as a kernel in a space h two. Indeed, writing this way immediately, I can define at the first glance two sets. But when you look carefully, it's just one set. W one is the span of kx in h one, and w two is the linear span kx in h two.
00:21:53.944 - 00:22:56.714, Speaker B: It's just the finite linear span for the time being. But because of this, actually w one is equal to w two. I mean, it's just one space. What is, what do I want to do? What I want to do is to, geometrically speaking, for the time being, I don't know if h one is equal to h two is my goal. So let's assume that we have this picture. I introduce w here, which is the same as, I mean, w one equal to w two equal to w w is in both h two one and h two. What they do is to show two things.
00:22:56.714 - 00:22:59.514, Speaker B: If f.
00:23:06.854 - 00:23:11.154, Speaker A: Double closure in h one is h one and h two, it is h two.
00:23:12.134 - 00:23:16.342, Speaker B: Yes, because of this identity here, I.
00:23:16.358 - 00:23:19.034, Speaker A: Think the first Lamborghini did.
00:23:19.644 - 00:24:02.974, Speaker B: Yeah, no, just because of this. When I write k index y or k index x, well, it can be interpreted as k one index x or k two index x. It's the same thing. But if I write it this way, it stays in h one. If I write using k two, it will be in h two two. So it's the same function space, but k equal to k one equal to k two says that it's in h one and also in h two. True.
00:24:02.974 - 00:25:19.082, Speaker B: And also I want to show that for every f in this w, we have an isometry, the normal echo. Why do we have this? Another way to. To realize that it really doesn't matter that we consider it as in h one or in h two. Is this interpretation. Consider f is in w span what this means? It means that f is a finite combination of alpha j k x j. That's the definition of span j from one to n true, because it's in span of kx in omega. Up to now, there is no indication that f should be in h one or h two.
00:25:19.082 - 00:26:29.854, Speaker B: But when you evaluate f at point x, it becomes alpha jkxj at point x. Based on the definition of k, it's j from one to n alpha j capital k. Now capital k x and x j. Now go back to what we had before, to this. First, I can write f of x equal to sum j from one to n alpha j. Instead of k, I write k one, because k is equal to k one. And so I can write alpha j little k one index xj at point x.
00:26:29.854 - 00:27:36.306, Speaker B: And this is a function in h one which is evaluated at the point x. So this interpretation shows that f is in h one. Precisely the same thing can be repeated up to here, except that the first line is the same, is the same, except that instead of k one. Now I put k two because k is also equal to k two. And so it's sum alpha j, little k two index xj at point x. And now this is a function in h two evaluated at point x, which implies that f is also in h two. That's a more detailed version of what I said.
00:27:36.306 - 00:28:40.034, Speaker B: So I have, so I have something like this. I have a w, a set of functions which live inside h one and live inside h two. That w is dense in h one and dense niche two is a consequence of previous lemma. But now I can say a bit more. I want to say that norm of f in h one is equal to normal f in H. It's an isometry, if the identity map is an isometry. And again, this is not something difficult to prove.
00:28:40.034 - 00:30:56.920, Speaker B: It's similar to what I did here, really similar to what I did here, to show that f is in h one and h two. How do we do that? If f is equal to the sum alpha j k xj, what is the norm of f in h one squared? Now that I can write this as sum alpha j k one xj, because they are the same, and the summation is j from one to n, j from one to n. That would be sum over j alpha j k one xj and sum over. I usually put I here, the other one, j alpha j x j. And when we develop the summation, the the inner product, we can take this out and take this out, because it's a finite sum sum over I, sum over j alpha I, alpha j k one point x, j index xj and k one index x. Everything is in each one. And now alpha j.
00:30:56.920 - 00:32:33.754, Speaker B: Know what this is? It's the value of this kernel at point xj. So it's k one xj xi. The value of this at the point xj is precisely equal to this, and do the same with h one replaced by h two. Similarly, if I do the same calculation, normal f in h two squared, doing the same thing, I arrive at the same summation, but at the end I will have k two xj. Again, though I have used this before, by using the fact that k one equal to k two equal to k, immediately I conclude that the normal f in h one is equal to the normal f in h two. So I have a dense subset in h one, which is the with respect to the norm of h one, which is dense also in h two, with respect to the normal h two. And also it's an isometry.
00:32:33.754 - 00:33:50.138, Speaker B: So what can I say for the whole, for an arbitrary element? So the last step, take, let f be an arbitrary element of h one, w equal to w one is dense in h one. Therefore, there is a sequence fn in w such that f n converges to f in this space h one. The convergence is in h one. That's one thing consequence of this convergence. Two things. First, f goes to f of x for every x is in omega. If we have convergence in norm, we have convergence at each point.
00:33:50.138 - 00:35:03.694, Speaker B: Second, the fact that if n converges to f in h one. This implies that fn is cauchy in h one. But in fact, fn is in w and norm of fn in h one is equal to the normal f in h two. Even we can replace fn by fn minus fm because w is a linear manifold. So this implies that fn is cauchy in h two. H two is complete. So there is a g in h two such that fn converges to g in h two.
00:35:03.694 - 00:35:59.704, Speaker B: Again, using the fact that convergence in norm implies pointwise convergence. This implies that if n of x goes to g of x for every x in omega. And now compare this with this one. If n goes to f and fn goes to g. Comparison tells us that does f of x is equal to g of x for every x, which is the same thing as saying that f is equal to g. So f is in h two. I started with an element in h one.
00:35:59.704 - 00:36:52.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I started with an element of h one. Conclusion was that this element is in h two. In other words, h one is a subset of h two. Now change the role of h one and h two. Similarly, h two is a subset of h one. Therefore, as in short, h one is the same set as h two. And indeed more than that.
00:36:52.404 - 00:38:03.576, Speaker B: More than that. It's kind of hidden in the proof of h one subset of h two. What happened? It's hidden in the proof of h one is a subset of h two, the same sequence which goes to f in h one. The same sequence goes to f in h two. Remember, g is equal to h. I just proved that. So what? You can also start from beginning not referencing to this, saying that for every f in h one which is equal to h two, there is a sequence fn in w such that fn goes to f in h one and f goes to f in h two.
00:38:03.576 - 00:39:25.494, Speaker B: We saw it disabled. And use the fact that let's see, normal fn as an element of h one is the same as normal fn as an element of h two for any n. Now you let n go to infinity. We obtain normal f as an element of h one is equal to the normal f as an element of h two. That that finishes the proof, and as I mentioned based on the question which was asked, nor of f in h one equal to normal f in h two. Indeed, that's equivalent to say that for every f and g, the inner product f and g is equal to the inner product of f and j h two. That's one direction is trivial, the other direction, this one is a consequence of polarizing identity or polarization identity.
00:39:25.494 - 00:40:24.714, Speaker B: This is a typical example that we see in Rkhs many, many times in this proof and proof that coming in future you will see that we use the fact that convergence in the norm implies 0.5 convergence or uniform convergence on a set which is away from the frontier. And we did use conclusions after this. So please look at this proof again and again, because it will come in some other lemmas and proposition in future too. Well, so up to now.
00:40:29.774 - 00:40:31.314, Speaker A: May I ask you this?
00:40:31.974 - 00:40:34.550, Speaker B: Yes, so what?
00:40:34.582 - 00:40:46.090, Speaker A: We have proved that if we take two subspace of functions on a same set omega, which are arches.
00:40:46.282 - 00:40:47.094, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:48.074 - 00:40:55.614, Speaker A: And their kernel match, then they will be same as you set and Hilbert space and everything.
00:40:57.194 - 00:40:57.810, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:57.922 - 00:41:04.174, Speaker A: And so our, and we had seen that every arches had given us a kernel.
00:41:05.594 - 00:41:39.078, Speaker B: That's the over. Next is a more, more theorem. We need to develop some tool to arrive at that theorem. Up to now, this is my comment. I say that if we have h one and h two and k one is equal to k two, we conclude that h one is equal to h two. So the function spaces are given. If the kernels coincide, the space coincide two.
00:41:39.078 - 00:42:08.934, Speaker B: That's half of the, indeed, the easy half, the other not. The function space is given, a k is given, a kernel is given with some properties. Is there a space h such that for this space kernel is k? That's an important question.
00:42:09.314 - 00:42:13.174, Speaker A: Okay, okay, my question was a little bit different.
00:42:13.674 - 00:42:14.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:42:15.354 - 00:42:19.842, Speaker A: Yeah, please go ahead. My question was a little bit different. I'll ask it later.
00:42:20.018 - 00:43:25.474, Speaker B: Sure, sure. So this is, this is the kind of half of the story, but the easy part, the easy half, the order, which is a bit more detailed, is that the kernel is given and we want to see if a function space exists such that for this Rkhs, the kernel is precisely the one given before. And you will see the answer is yes, based on more theorem. And that is why after having this result and this result, we see that between h, the space of functions and k, the space of kernel, there is a bijection. Whenever we have h. Well, k is somehow in the definition. And whenever we have a k, we can construct an Rkhs for which the kernel is already given.
00:43:25.474 - 00:43:32.104, Speaker B: So if I misunderstood your question, please go ahead and say what you wanted to ask.
00:43:32.604 - 00:43:50.060, Speaker A: Yeah, so, okay, this one is. Okay, so what I was trying to ask. So, given a archs, we found a kernel. Yeah, and now you prove that if you have a two arches with the same kernel, then they have to be exactly same.
00:43:50.252 - 00:43:51.080, Speaker B: Yes.
00:43:51.252 - 00:44:39.284, Speaker A: So kernel function is basically capturing everything about arches. Yes, and basically this correspondence, which you told is also the same thing. Yes, but we have seen that given a RKHs, finding its kernel, like for the soviet species, at least the kernel, which we found doesn't seem to house a direct connection. Just as a function, it doesn't seem to be directly related with how the what is our cache is. Basically, we calculated those, but guessing then is not something we can do. As your fourth example of solar space was also like that.
00:44:42.024 - 00:45:29.976, Speaker B: I fully understand what you you mean, and indeed not based on the sub spaces that we saw. Based on HP spaces, which mean one of my favorite topics. Yes, you are right. From abstract point of view, the kernel has everything in it, but it doesn't mean that when you look at the kernel, you see everything immediately. These are two different things. The information are there in the sense that it uniquely determines our space. True, but it doesn't show all the properties.
00:45:29.976 - 00:46:23.102, Speaker B: Immediately you have to extract them. You mentioned several of the spaces. It's a very good example. If you look at the kernel, for example, in the first space that we consider, the kernel was like this kx at one t here, zero one tx. It was a linear map, linear line here and another line there, and with different slopes. So yeah, I agree with you. When you look at this case, you cannot immediately say that this kx is related to space of absolutely continuous function, such that the derivative is in l two.
00:46:23.102 - 00:46:51.614, Speaker B: No, absolutely not. And you have to cook. But at the same time, the abstract theory tells us that it gives us a unique space, which is what we studied before. To get those properties, you have to work and extract the information are here, but you do not see it. No, nobody sees it in the first glance. We need, we need to work on it and extract this information.
00:46:53.554 - 00:47:00.738, Speaker A: So let me ask one more question. I think my question is a little bit weird.
00:47:00.826 - 00:47:53.584, Speaker B: Please, please allow me to, because this is related to this question you asked to finish with hb. I will explain this after proving more theorem. If b is in h infinity and norm of b is less than or equal to one. In other words, an element in the unit ball of h infinity. Then consider kz w by this formula, one minus bw bar, is that one minus w bar z. True. Well, it's a function, and based on, I will explain before Moore's theorum, it's a kernel function.
00:47:53.584 - 00:48:59.434, Speaker B: So it satisfies the properties that you want from the kernel. So whatever it means, it's a kernel function or function kernel. And so based on the theorem I will prove later, it gives a unique space edge such that its kernel is precisely equal to this one. So, but at this point, you cannot tell what is this space. It's a very rich theory now that it's hb, not hp, the branch spaces, which is the topic of this weekend. Tomorrow? Is it tomorrow? Let me. Yes, it is tomorrow.
00:48:59.434 - 00:49:40.158, Speaker B: It is tomorrow. And Dan Timothy is going to talk about it, Dante is going to talk about it. So it's a way to arrive at HB spaces as dobrozniake spaces. Probably the fastest way you can do that. But you cannot see the properties of HPS spaces after this kernel, not, at least not all of them. Immediately you need to cook and develop a whole theory to do so. So that answers your first question.
00:49:40.158 - 00:49:42.094, Speaker B: What is your second question?
00:49:43.074 - 00:50:03.346, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, I think you might first question properly. So my second question is like, we have a similar correspondence in linear algebra, right? Like let us just take a linear transformation on a vector space, and they will correspond to matrices.
00:50:03.530 - 00:50:04.294, Speaker B: Yes.
00:50:05.194 - 00:50:54.510, Speaker A: Okay, there we can say something, but matrices, we can't say directly what will be the linear transformation if we don't fix a basic. Yes, but what we do, like we have matrix operations and we have the linear on the operations from the linear operators, and they also correspond one. One correspondence, like composition, will correspond to the multiplication of matrices, addition will correspond to additions. Is there some kind of thing we can do here also? And let me take example of h. So h 2D Kernel was one upon one minus omega bar z, and h was just a product of that.
00:50:54.662 - 00:50:55.394, Speaker B: Yes.
00:50:55.694 - 00:51:30.804, Speaker A: So let me rephrase it now, like this, we had a kernel, one upon one minus omega 1 bar z, one zi bar, and I took n such kernels and they correspond, and I took the product of that kernels. And although you have not defined what is kernel function, but I believe that product will be a kernel function because. Yeah, we appreciate know that that correspond to the particular arches. And that sounds are to be.
00:51:32.224 - 00:51:42.804, Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes, very good question. A version of this question was asked even today for when I talked about h. Two of the end.
00:51:43.664 - 00:51:46.856, Speaker A: Yeah, right. I'm asking on the same.
00:51:47.040 - 00:52:53.994, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. This question is related to that question and related to the subject that we will discuss in our course in future, the title is operation on kernels. In other words, when we add them, when we multiply them together, what happens? Do we obtain a new space? And if yes, what is that space? It's a part of our course. So yes, the answer to your question. We have operations on the kernels, some operations, I emphasize, because you mentioned linear transformation. We can add them, we can multiply by positive constant, but we cannot always, we cannot subtract, and sometimes we can not always, no subtraction, no multiplication by negative scalars, but we can multiply two kernels together and obtain another kernel. So we will see.
00:52:53.994 - 00:53:58.988, Speaker B: And also we have Hadamard multiplication. So all these topics is our agenda for future under, as I said, the title operations and kernels. But before that, still half of the correspondence is not done. I have to Moore's theorem to say that whenever a kernel is given, there is a corresponding function space. When I do that, then I explore the, I mean this, the domain, the families of kernels. And to see given, say, a sequence or a finite number of kernels, how can I create a new kernel? And when I created a new kernel, I immediately have created a new space. This is similar to what we do in functional analysis or in linear algebra.
00:53:58.988 - 00:54:52.884, Speaker B: We have one vector space, we have a collection of vectors spaces, and we do operation to create new vector spaces. For example, we do Cartesian product. So out of some spaces we create a new space. Or in group theory, we have some families of groups, and out of them, either by taking the quotient, or by cartesian product, or by other operation, we create a new group. Here is the same story. We have some kernels, and by some operations we will see which operations are legitimate. By some operations we create new kernels, and new kernels give us new functional spaces.
00:54:52.884 - 00:55:00.304, Speaker B: Thanks to theorem, which is not proved yet, we'll do it probably next week. Is that good?
00:55:01.044 - 00:55:02.452, Speaker A: Yes, sir. Thank you.
00:55:02.588 - 00:55:12.444, Speaker B: Yeah, you're welcome. Okay, four, so again, another break, refresh my coffee, and then we come back.
