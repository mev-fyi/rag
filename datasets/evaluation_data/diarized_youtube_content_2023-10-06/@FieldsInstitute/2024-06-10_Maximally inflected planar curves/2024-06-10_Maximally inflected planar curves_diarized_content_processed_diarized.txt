00:00:00.080 - 00:00:37.684, Speaker A: Without further ado, let me introduce Thomas Brazelton, who will tell us about maximally inflected curves. Awesome. Well, thank you, Taylor. Thank you to all the organizers for throwing this awesome conference. I've had a chance to meet new people and to get to know a lot of other people who I sort of knew and talk math with a lot of amazing, amazing mathematicians in the same space. So I come not from, really, algebraic geometry or from numerical algebraic geometry or anything with a lot of polynomials. I come from homotopy theory, and I'm sort of a recent convert to real algebraic geometry and all that it has to offer.
00:00:37.684 - 00:01:26.450, Speaker A: But I guess in the interest of having little stories about Frank, my first trip, my first mathematical trip for a few years, because we were all sort of not traveling for a little bit there. I forget exactly why. Yeah, I think I blocked it out, but it was down to Texas A and M to meet with Frank and give a talk. And I remember going in to blocker hall, is it? And doing math all day and then going back to the hotel, and I was sitting, typing furiously, and I talked to my mom on the phone, and I was telling her about my day, and she was like, you need to calm down. She's like, this is the most excited I've heard you in, like, two years. And so I think probably a small part of that is not traveling for a little bit. You get really antsy, and then when you get at the board of people, you get really excited again.
00:01:26.450 - 00:01:37.626, Speaker A: But a big part of that is that frank just, like, exudes mathematical excitement, and it's really hard to talk to him without feeling that. So I was like, at, you know, 10:11 p.m. still typing. I'm like. I'm still ready to go, like.
00:01:37.730 - 00:01:43.042, Speaker B: So that's how you get your money out of the travel money.
00:01:43.218 - 00:02:09.266, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so, today, I want to, um. I'm gonna say some things out loud, and then I'll. I'll start writing a little bit more. So, uh, if you get lost, it's not really the main focus of this, but the question that I want to ask about is a really vague one, which is, what is the shape of a real curve? And let's give the degree a name.
00:02:09.266 - 00:02:38.826, Speaker A: Let's say maybe of degree d. So, for example, if I drew an elliptic curve on the plane, I could have something that looks like this, or I could have something that looks like this. And these, topologically, look very different. And this question sort of dates back about as far as mathematics goes. We have the capacity to add things, to multiply, to scale them. That leads us to polynomials, and then we start to visualize polynomials. And this is one of the first things we do in high school is real algebraic geometry.
00:02:38.890 - 00:02:39.538, Speaker C: Newton.
00:02:39.706 - 00:03:08.886, Speaker A: Newton, yeah, yeah. And we start looking at y equals mx plus b and things like that and studying these sorts of curves. So, in a certain sense, real algebraic geometry is one of the first things that we bump into and one of the very first problems, which is, what do curves look like? What do polynomials and two variables look like on the plane is somehow still completely wide open. And I consider it one of the great open problems in mathematics. Newton did classify cubics, so if we go back, we can look at certain degrees. So d equals one, that one's okay. We have lines.
00:03:08.886 - 00:03:42.562, Speaker A: These sort of exist in nature, whether we like it or not. For d equals two. Again, if you look over the complex numbers, things aren't quite so interesting. We understand how curves look over the complex numbers, but d equals two is sort of the first interesting case over the reals. And it was back to the ancient Greeks and other civilizations like that who understood these were conic sections for d equals three. Like Frank says, Newton was classifying these. But even before this, the ancient Greeks knew that if they had access to cubics, they could solve certain problems that they couldn't solve with conic sections.
00:03:42.562 - 00:04:22.568, Speaker A: For example, the delian problem of doubling the cube is not solvable with conics. But if you have access to certain degree, three things, like the sysoid of diocles, you can solve these sorts of problems. But in general, a total classification of these curves and what they're allowed to look like topologically isn't known. But one sort of granular invariant you might look at is what is like the number of different components of this thing over the projected line. And this has one connected component, and this thing has two connected components. And what Harnack tells us from the 18 hundreds is that you have a maximal number of connected components. I don't want to write so much because I don't want to go on a tangent.
00:04:22.568 - 00:04:48.316, Speaker A: You have a maximum number of connected components. It's the genus of the curve plus one. And these things are called m curves. And m curves, I'll give a fake definition. This is when you have the most connected components over the reels. And so these were invented in the late 18 hundreds. They've been studied steadily for 150 years.
00:04:48.316 - 00:05:21.164, Speaker A: Now. There was a paper of Baron Sternfels, who was here earlier in the week. Mario Kumar and Riluk of Vlad, within the last month or so where they were talking about m curves. So this is still a very active topic of discussion. So this whole story is when Hilbert formulated his 16th problem, it was for arbitrary curves. But studying m curves and things like this, you generally expect them to be smooth. But one of the other things that we see in high school algebra is these curves that are not defined by a polynomial in x and y, but are rather given parametrically by something in t.
00:05:21.164 - 00:06:19.694, Speaker A: And this in algebraic geometry is the discussion of rational curves. So what about rational planar curves of degree d? And by this I mean something that looks like this. So I'll go from p one to p two. You can do this over any field, but we should really think about all this happening over the reals for our purposes. And I'm going to send this to some polynomial f of St, g of St and h of St, where all of these are homogeneous of degree d, and they don't share any common factor. Okay, so if we think about what m curves are, m curves is when like the most is happening over r. So if we want to study rational planar curves, again, this is a really hard problem, but we might look for some the most is happening over the reels and try to study something like that.
00:06:19.694 - 00:07:02.834, Speaker A: So one thing you could look at is when the curve has an inflection point. So a curve C has an inflection point, or we'll just say a flex. And the inflection point occurs when you graph it on the plane. But this is parameterized. So I might just tell you what time the inflection is happening. So a curve has an inflection point at maybe, let's say some point on the curve, if the tangent line to the curve meets c, and the tangent line will always meet to order two. So I'm going to ask that order to actually just be bigger.
00:07:02.834 - 00:07:43.168, Speaker A: So order greater than or equal to three. And if we remember again from calculus, when I have a curve and the second derivative vanishes, this is what's happening. This is what we're calling inflection. And if we computed the multiplicity of that intersection, we would see that it's maybe three or something in that example. Okay, so a curve c, that's given by the data of f, g and h inflects at some time t. So maybe I'll work on the chart. So this t is living, sorry, let me call it t naught.
00:07:43.168 - 00:08:30.154, Speaker A: It's living on an affine line, living in p one if and only if, when I look at let's say the position of the curve. So f of t, g of t, h of t. I look at a velocity vector, and I look at an acceleration vector. There's some dependence between these. So this, the determinant of this, what I'm asking is, when I take this determinant and I evaluate it at t equals t zero, this is equal to zero. And we might recognize this object from an ordinary differential equations class. This is what's called the Wronskian of these things.
00:08:30.154 - 00:09:40.528, Speaker A: So, we'll call this the Wronsky of f, g, and h, and it'll be some polynomial in t. And I'm asking for t naught to be a root of this thing. So, I'm going to leave this up. And I promised you we were going to do something with, like, the most happening over the reals. So, here's this definition let's do to, and some guy named Satele, and it says a curve is maximally inflected if all of its inflection points, sorry, let me say inflection times, maybe I should say, or real. Okay, so I've got this polynomial right here. This is this Wronsky polynomial, and I'm wanting it.
00:09:40.528 - 00:09:58.128, Speaker A: I can just sort of look at it, and I could factor it, and I can ask how many of its roots are real and how many are complex. And what I want to happen is, I want these curves to inflect at real times. And that's what we're asking. And so I can look at this if this is degree D. So let's say this is degree D. So it's t to the d plus some stuff. This is degree D.
00:09:58.128 - 00:10:29.604, Speaker A: So it's t to the d plus some stuff. But I can do some sort of column operation. I can get this down a degree. I can get that down to two degrees. And when I sort of count the degree of this, overall, what I'll see is that a rational curve of degree D has three times D minus two flexes. And this is counted with multiplicity. So if I base changed over to c, I might have a complex conjugate pair of flexes.
00:10:29.604 - 00:10:58.634, Speaker A: It's very, very hard to draw, but at least when I count with multiplicity, you just don't, you just don't draw it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, sure. That's like, what's the safest way to go skiing? You don't go skiing. But sure, yeah. Point taken. Okay, so what we're really asking for a maximally inflected curve.
00:10:58.634 - 00:11:37.956, Speaker A: I can always define a curve for u over C and I can have this sort of behavior, but it's not clear that anything like that will have real roots. If I give you a real polynomial. It's not ever clear that the wronsky has real roots, right? You have to sort of construct by hand to see that these curves even exist. I gave you a definition, but we should really cook up ones that do exist. Let me also just make a comment that this whole thing extends to higher dimensions. I could look at a curve valued in PR and then I could take that bigger thing where I take even more derivatives and I ask that to vanish. I might call that a ramification point rather than an inflection point, but everything generalizes to higher dimension.
00:11:37.956 - 00:11:59.256, Speaker A: I'm going to stay with planar curves. For the purposes of this talk we do call them fluxes. Yeah. Okay, so I have this data. My curve is given by the tuple of polynomials F, G and H. And I want to study something about the topology of this. And I want to study sort of what it looks like.
00:11:59.256 - 00:12:27.496, Speaker A: I want to see where the fluxes are occurring. I want to study rationality of the fluxes. And one thing I notice is that this sort of thing is insensitive to taking the curve and just sliding it over or maybe turning it right. And what I see is if I do a column operation on this determinant, that'll change the Wronsky up to a scalar. But what that corresponds to is doing a projective transformation on p two for the curve. So it's moving the curve around and doing something to it, but it's not really structurally changing the curve. So it's insensitive to those sorts of things.
00:12:27.496 - 00:13:42.434, Speaker A: So I'm looking at that tuple and I sort of care about that tuple only up to column transformations, right? So it makes sense to think about this not as an ordered list of polynomials, but really as a three plane of polynomials in a vector space of polynomials. So I think about these, you know, all of these live in global sections of O of D over p one. And what I should think about instead, potentially, is let's think about these as a span. And this now lives in a grossmontion of three planes in this vector space. So these sort of constraints that you have on flexes and things like that for rational curves, they're really coming from your ability to understand things as, as linear subspaces of these linear series on p one. And you get stronger things like stronger puker formulas for rational curves because of your capacity to do things like this. And now from this perspective, I can take a three plane here and this is d plus one dimensional, right? Because I'll have d plus one coefficients to define something like this.
00:13:42.434 - 00:14:30.608, Speaker A: And I can think about this wronsky thing that inputs a Grossmanian and outputs the Wronsky polynomial. And I'll extract the coefficients of that polynomial. And I'll note they're well defined now up to some common scalar because I was allowed to do these column operations. What this tells me is I go to a projective space of dimension three times d minus two. And this is what's called the Wronsky map. Okay? So to be super clear, I'm inputting this thing right here, span of fgh and I'm outputting the Wronsky of f, g and h of t. And I'm extracting the coefficients of that and viewing this as living.
00:14:30.608 - 00:15:10.544, Speaker A: So maybe I should say actually this is the projective space of polynomials over your field in t of dimension at most. Yeah, that works. Yeah. Cool. Okay, great. Okay, so let's fix some time t zero on p one. And let's ask the following question.
00:15:10.544 - 00:16:27.004, Speaker A: What is the locus of planes in gr three? D one so that the Wronsky polynomial has a root at t naught. So I fixed some t naught and I'm going to look at all the things in the fiber where when you take the Wronsky polynomial, it vanishes at that. And when it turns out to what turns out to be true here, the answer for this is this is given by the vanishing of a single plucher coordinate. I believe the word for this is that it's a simple Schubert condition. Is that the right? Yeah. In other words, I take my grassmanni and I embed this in projective space by the puker embedding. And this locus is the same as taking that and chopping it with a specific hyperplane, projective space.
00:16:27.004 - 00:17:11.564, Speaker A: So every time I fix a potential root for the Wronsky, I'm cutting the Grossmanian with a hyperplane. And I'm also prescribing you a time where the associated planar curve would flex. So this leads me to the following observation that the following are all in bijection. So this is so. Sorry. Let me fix some data before I write this. Let's fix sometimes t one through t on t one.
00:17:11.564 - 00:18:14.150, Speaker A: And let's say they're distinct for our purposes. Okay, now the following are in bijection. So the first is, let's say, spans of things like f, g and h living in the Grossmannian 3D plus one. So that the Wronsky polynomial fg and h is equal to maybe some scalar multiple of the product of the t minus ti's. So, I fixed all of the possible roots for my Bronski. It's also in bijection with planar curves p one to p two. Again, given by fg and h that inflect at ti for all I.
00:18:14.150 - 00:19:32.506, Speaker A: And this again. Now, this is considered up to projective linear equivalence. What else are we in bijection with? We're also in bijection with the size of the fiber of the Wronsky map, grd three plus one to p. So why is this? When I fix these times, that's giving me a point in here corresponding to this polynomial? And again, that's defined up to a scalar multiple. And what I'm asking you is exactly what are the things that map to this under the Wronsky? So when I say the size of the fiber of this, what I could also say if we were over the complex numbers is I'm asking for the brower degree, if we remember this from if you were awake when I spoke on Wednesday morning. And another thing I'm running out of space here is also the degree of the gross monument 3D plus one as a projective variety. Under the pulcher embedding, that last dash, you have strictly.
00:19:32.530 - 00:19:33.810, Speaker B: That's a number, not a set.
00:19:33.922 - 00:19:34.574, Speaker A: Sure.
00:19:35.874 - 00:19:41.410, Speaker B: You have a dash for the size of the fiber. You actually mean for the points in the fiber.
00:19:41.522 - 00:19:41.786, Speaker A: Oh.
00:19:41.810 - 00:19:44.666, Speaker B: Oh, points to the fiber. But those last things are.
00:19:44.810 - 00:19:45.066, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:45.090 - 00:19:46.506, Speaker B: Those numbers are equal to each other.
00:19:46.610 - 00:19:55.438, Speaker A: Yeah. The size of the fiber counts with multiplicity is the broward degree over c. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Some of them are about. Some of them are sets and some of them are numbers.
00:19:55.438 - 00:20:26.864, Speaker A: But what is a number if not the size of a set? Right. Okay. All right. So what is this number? It counts all of these things. And there's a theorem that's due to Schubert. That's a lie, but I'm going to state it anyways. Yes.
00:20:26.864 - 00:20:53.592, Speaker A: Yes. So this is equal to the number of standard young tableau. Frank knows a lot of history, so I assume he already sees where the lie is. Yeah, I'll say it in a second. Don't worry. I know. So this is the size of the number of standard young tableau of size three times d minus two.
00:20:53.592 - 00:21:22.404, Speaker A: Again, remember what this is? This is. I have. I think we've seen this in maybe a couple talks. I'm filling out numbers, one through however many boxes I have and what I'm allowed to do is I can go over. I can go always go to the right or down in such a way that I'm weakly increasing, or I'm just increasing along rows and I'm increasing along columns. Okay, so the lie here is Schubert did this in the 1880s, and he wrote down this number right here for Grossmannians. Incredibly complicated thing.
00:21:22.404 - 00:21:48.564, Speaker A: All these crazy formulas that he had almost no justification for, that all ended up being correct. And he did, like, multiplication of Schubert conditions before we had a visual calculus for actually being able to do them. He wrote down, like, conditions in these crazy formulas. And then Alfred Young came out in 1900 and formulated young tableau. And now this is, like, depending on who you are and what you mean by Schubert calculus when you say it, this is sort of the visual calculus attached to intersecting Schubert conditions.
00:21:49.224 - 00:21:52.328, Speaker B: Yeah, he wrote down the hook formula before the hook formula.
00:21:52.376 - 00:21:54.910, Speaker A: He did also the biocharacter part of.
00:21:54.912 - 00:21:56.976, Speaker B: The biochar, and he proof.
00:21:57.080 - 00:22:27.564, Speaker A: Yeah. That's awesome. Okay. All right. So this whole story is over c, and this allows you to do so many cool things with Schubert calculus. A lot of the problems that we saw on, like, the conference website and all of the talks we've seen over the course of the week had something to do with Schubert calculus. It's a really fascinating area of math if you haven't seen it yet.
00:22:27.564 - 00:22:29.424, Speaker A: But the question that.
00:22:31.644 - 00:22:36.304, Speaker B: Equating or bijecting. The size of the fiber of the bronze.
00:22:39.484 - 00:22:41.620, Speaker A: Yeah, the fact is probably.
00:22:41.652 - 00:22:43.664, Speaker B: Are you certain that these are obvious?
00:22:46.884 - 00:23:12.664, Speaker A: Oh, no, no. These are the number. The sizes of these sets are equal, but that's very different than explicitly giving you a bi direction. That means something. The numbers are equal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This should probably be a theorem attributed to, like, hundreds of people.
00:23:12.664 - 00:24:09.004, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm just calling it a proposition and then not attributing it to anyone. Okay, so I want to talk about rationality here. So, the question is, what does rationality of the flexes tell you, if anything, about rationality of the curve? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Whether or not it's defined over r. So there's this beautiful theorem that is still as many theorems still referred to as a conjecture, the superior, superior conjecture.
00:24:09.004 - 00:24:34.756, Speaker A: And this is the maybe. I'll call this, like, a planar curves version of it. It's a much stronger conjecture, and I'm going to just phrase it in the context of this talk. And what this says is a maximally inflected curve is real. Sorry. Maybe the definitions are a little messed up. Let's say.
00:24:34.756 - 00:25:14.044, Speaker A: Sorry. A real sorry. A rational curve, say cp one to cp two, with all real flexes, is itself real. All right, so this is a really powerful, powerful statement. And I want to say, yeah, this is now a theorem. Yeah, I'll say a little bit about all the many people in this room that have worked on this thing, but, yeah, yeah. So it is shocking.
00:25:14.044 - 00:25:48.864, Speaker A: It is shocking. So what does this mean? So, let's take Bronski polynomial of f, g, and h in t. These are now complex univariate polynomials because they're giving me some complex planar curve. So, if this. If this has all real roots, then the curve spanned by f, g, and h. I'll really say f, g, and h. Define a planar curve.
00:25:48.864 - 00:26:22.714, Speaker A: A real planar curve. Okay? In other words, that three plane in the gross margin is fixed by complex conjugation. So it's not obvious from when I give you a complex curve that you could even graph it over the rails, right? It has complex coefficients. What this is telling you is you actually are capable of graphing it over the reals, and this constructs maximally inflected curves for us. Um, and maybe I should have had that the curve was real in the definition of maximally inflected. Right? Okay. Um, what else does this tell us? So, when I fix a time, right, I fix some t.
00:26:22.714 - 00:27:16.814, Speaker A: I fix a root of the wronsky. This is corresponding to a single pleucor coordinate. And this is giving me a simple Schubert condition. And what this says is that if we fix, I'll say, nice, real Schubert conditions. All solutions to the Schubert problem are themselves real. Okay, so I want to give an example of this. We've seen on the conference website, and we've seen, in a lot of people's talks, this hyperboloid thing and the lines and talking about four lines and two lines meeting them in three space.
00:27:16.814 - 00:28:04.790, Speaker A: And I think in most of the cases where this comes up, this is like a lie. We're doing the same thing that we always do in algebraic geometry, is we, like, describe something over c, and I graph it over r, and I pretend like it works over r. What this is telling us is that if I actually take four lines in rp three, so actual lines in rp three, I know that if I base change to c, I have two complex lines meeting them. What this is saying is that if I picked those lines sufficiently nicely and for the experts, I want them to osculate a rational normal curve in p three. So I want them to be tangent to a rational normal curve. If all four of them are tangentially, then the two lines that meet them are themselves defined over the reals. All right, so this sort of thing also gives us a.
00:28:04.790 - 00:28:15.754, Speaker A: Like I said, this, first of all proves the existence of maximally inflected curves, but it also gives us a recipe for cooking up maximally inflected curves. Yeah, yeah.
00:28:16.734 - 00:28:20.666, Speaker B: Every possible one. It gives you a lot of.
00:28:20.770 - 00:28:57.126, Speaker A: Yeah. So get to get a maximally inflected curve. I'm first going to fix some real times. So t one through t. Then I'm going to solve a Schubert problem. And this is. I'm going to throw some notation here.
00:28:57.126 - 00:29:28.314, Speaker A: This is the Schubert problem, the simple one attached to a flag, oscillating a rational normal curve at time t one. And I'm going to intersect with all of these. So, x square, f bullet, t. What this tells me is that all of the preimages are going to be real, all the solutions will be real. So I could solve this. I don't have to solve this symbolically. We could solve this numerically, and we could find something that has a little extra fuzz in the complex direction, and we can just truncate it and graph it, and then we're good to go.
00:29:28.314 - 00:30:21.444, Speaker A: Okay, so, like we said, this is now a theorem, and it's been worked on by a lot of people, many of whom are in the room with us right now. So, Frank solved this in a special case in 1999, I believe. So Frank's result was there exist real times that you can put here so that all solutions are real. And the full power of the conjecture says any real times you picked would solve this. Um, this was solvent. This is, uh, work done by Eremenko and Gabriela in what year? Zero two, I think. I think it's published in zero two.
00:30:21.444 - 00:30:45.670, Speaker A: And they proved this for. Again. Right. This is an instance of a more general problem for GRK. And they proved it for GR two. Nice. It was finally proven in sort of its full power by Mukhin, Torasov and Varchenko in, I want to say zero six, but I think Jake says it's zero six.
00:30:45.670 - 00:31:22.912, Speaker A: It was online in zero six, maybe, and then it was published in zero nine or something like that. And this uses some incredibly complicated tools that I believe are derived from mathematical physics and some really powerful commutative algebra. It was reproving using completely different methods by Jake Levenson and Kevin Perbouch in 2019. 2018. Yes. Jake's being modest. It's an awesome paper.
00:31:22.912 - 00:31:28.244, Speaker A: And also, I think Stephen Karp and Kevin Perboo are working on related things.
00:31:31.224 - 00:31:32.856, Speaker B: Related. But it's different.
00:31:33.000 - 00:31:36.072, Speaker A: Yeah. They have two papers that this has.
00:31:36.088 - 00:31:40.164, Speaker B: Been proven many times. Yeah, I mean, all very different.
00:31:41.744 - 00:32:34.004, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so, uh, I'll sort of write this question out. Well, maybe I'll just say this out loud because it's kind of a digression from the talk, but, uh, Alex sort of asked something related to this a second ago, which is we've got these abstract bi directions between all of these things. Um, and we can ask to what extent you're allowed to make these explicit. So if I have solutions to a Schubert problem, I can graph the associated curves. Can I put these sorts of things in bijection with standard young tableau? And in some senses we know roughly how to do this. Like if you're really approaching the boundary in a very specific way, there's really cool work of Kevin Perbou that shows you how to put fibers of the bronze in bijections with young tableau.
00:32:34.004 - 00:33:29.660, Speaker A: I think it was in Erimeko and Gabriela's work. Yeah. Um, but sort of a vague question in that direction that I've been, uh, talking to Frank and to Jake about is how do you go between real planar curves with prescribed flexes in standard young tableau? Three times d minus two, let's say. Okay, so what do I mean by, so if I'm sort of near the boundary, I can solve for these Schubert conditions, I can set things in bijection with young tableau. I can move everything over to get to some position that I might want. And like, if I look at a curve, I could try to maybe like homotopy continuation away from the boundary, figure out what it's being tracked to. And you can do all these sorts of methods.
00:33:29.660 - 00:34:09.684, Speaker A: But what I personally would really like is I draw you a curve. Can you tell me the tableau associated to it? And more generally, if I give you a tableau, I think this is the far more interesting direction. If I write out a tableau for you, can you interpret it as a recipe to draw a rational curve of a given degree? And I think in general this is a really hard problem. It's very hard to know when the curve has to self intersect. If I'm sort of, as I go along the curve, I have to hit some flexes and I have to inflect at certain times. And if I'm going to go cross myself, do I inflect before I do it? Do I inflect afterwards? Not really sure. And in general, it's also really hard to draw a curve because you have to bend it enough times to have that given degree.
00:34:09.684 - 00:34:35.964, Speaker A: But you can't bend it too many times because you violate Bezieu's theorem. So there's some, I think, really interesting pictures to be drawn here, and a lot we don't know. All right. I can tell you how this works in low cases, for sure. Yeah. But I think broadly, we have no idea. Okay, so the definition of the Wronsky map.
00:34:35.964 - 00:35:02.176, Speaker A: You know, we didn't really use any complex structure to define this. So this Wronsky map that goes from a Grossmannian. Let's stick with the planar thing. Uh, actually, let's do this more generally. K planes in n space. Going to projective kn k space. This is a map over the complex numbers.
00:35:02.176 - 00:35:16.444, Speaker A: It's between complex manifolds of the same dimension that are smooth and compact over the reals. They're also smooth, compact manifolds of the same dimension. And this is a very nice map. It's finite, it's proper. It makes sense in a lot of contexts. You could talk about this over other fields, if you like.
00:35:17.124 - 00:35:17.864, Speaker B: Over.
00:35:18.684 - 00:35:57.032, Speaker A: Yeah, it's finite over z. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe, let's say, in a broad setting. Yeah, you're speaking my language now. Okay, so what can I do? If I'm working over the reels, I could take a point in here, and I could look at the preimage. And in general, it'll lie on some open chart. And I can take that open chart, and I can just restrict my attention to the open chart.
00:35:57.032 - 00:36:37.760, Speaker A: So I can look at all the fibers lying on an open chart over r. And when I do this, what happens is I get something that looks like this. R times k, n minus k. And I get an induced map here. And what I think about as I've got over here, I've got some regular value. And in the preimage here, I've got all the different fibers of the Wronsky that are all lying on that affine chart. And I made some choices by doing this.
00:36:37.760 - 00:37:16.714, Speaker A: Right. In general, these sorts of things won't be oriented, and they won't often be oriented at the same time when they are. And what happens is, when I make this chart, I'm really like, I need to tell you, when I hand you two reals, I'm telling you which way is up on the plane in some sense. And by picking these things, I've also told you which way is up. Because I could very well, I could have picked it this way, and I could have asked Frank to pick charts, and he might have swapped the x and y axis. He might have called what I called Yx and called what I called XY. So, whatever sort of computation we get, we should remember that it's always only well defined up to some orientation data.
00:37:16.714 - 00:38:03.764, Speaker A: But I talked a little bit Wednesday morning about brower degrees and about sort of counting fibers over the reels together with that orientation data. So, because this is a nice map, and because I can sort of restrict my attention to charts, I can look at this induced map. It's polynomial. It's lovely. And I can compute its broward degree. And this has been computed by Gabrieloth and Eremenko. This, I think, was 2003 ish.
00:38:03.764 - 00:38:46.300, Speaker A: There's a series of two papers that do it, and the second paper does it in full generality and says, this is the brower degree. And just to remind you what the brower degree is picking up over R. Right. It's picking up the multiplicity of each of these zeros in the fiber. Uh, but it, together with this orientation, is together. If there's a little neighborhood around this point, when I map it forward, is it flipping over, or is it staying pointing up in the same way? Um, the brower degree of this restricted Wronsky map is equal to. There's two cases.
00:38:46.300 - 00:39:48.604, Speaker A: So I'm going to have zero if n is even, and I'm going to have what's called ikn minus k if n is odd. Okay, so what is this ikn minus k? This is I'm going to sum over all tableau of size k times n minus k, and I'm going to sum a minus one to the number of inversions on the tableau, which maybe I won't define, but I hope people know. And again, all of this is only well defined up to some sort of common scaler that would come from flipping this. If I flipped the orientation on this, every single local degree would be multiplied through by minus one. So I should really throw an absolute value. And now I get some well defined thing. Okay, so, a question that we could ask and a question that I've been very interested in.
00:39:48.604 - 00:40:46.164, Speaker A: So this. This whole thing is a sum over all the local fibers. It tells you if I count in every single fiber, and I sum up the local Broward degree in general, they won't have much multiplicity. But I'll see a plus one or a minus one for everything in the fiber. When I add these up, this is what I get. And my question is, each of these points in the fiber is representing a rational curve for me on the plane so what does the local brower degree, what is the local degree, which in general is a plus one or minus one mean in terms of the topology or the geometry of the associated rational curve. And in general, we don't know the answer to this.
00:40:46.164 - 00:41:38.784, Speaker A: So I'll say sort of one thing about this. Sure. Yeah. So, like, yeah, I guess. Is there a connection? So what is it? So the Wronsky it counts things that are solving simple Schubert conditions. And what these simple schuberth conditions can be reframed is you're sort of intersecting an appropriate number of planes of the right co dimension that osculate a rational normal curve. So there's this, you know, one of these examples is you're counting lines, meaning four lines in three space.
00:41:38.784 - 00:42:28.214, Speaker A: You can count lines, meaning six lines in p four. All of these sorts of things can be reformulated in terms of computing the degree of the Wronsky. So a theorem that I proved towards this direction is that the local degree of the Wronsky, I'm going to phrase this in a really vague way, but is a determinantal quantity in the puker coordinates of the planes the solution intersects. Again, this is super vague. This is not a theorem in the way that I've stated it. You can make this precise. I really don't want to, because it'll get really nasty.
00:42:28.214 - 00:43:16.984, Speaker A: But I'll give you an example of what I mean by this. And this example hinges very, very heavily on work of Padne Shuny Vasant and Kirsten Michelgrin, is that let's say I've got my four lines, maybe. Let's say, actually I've got like six lines in p four or something, and I look at a line intersecting all six of these, which hopefully I'll be able to draw. Then I get six points on this line. And one thing I could do is study these six points and look sort of among the six of them at the four, pick four of these and look at a cross ratio and take all those cross ratios and put them in some big matrix and take its determinant. And this is roughly what you're picking up as the local degree. Lebronsky.
00:43:16.984 - 00:44:21.138, Speaker A: And for more, there's more precise stuff on this in the literature, if you want. Or I can tell you more about this after the talk, but this is roughly what you're doing. Ok? But again, this doesn't answer the question over here. This is still in terms of solving a Schubert problem and doing something there. Ok? So I'm going to tell you a totally different thing, and then we're going to bring it back to this. And it's this question of interpolation. So how many rational curves of degree d interpolate or pass through three d minus one points on p two? Okay, so the answer to this is nd, I guess not an answer, it's notation.
00:44:21.138 - 00:44:53.056, Speaker A: But what I could say is, okay, what are some easy examples of this? Uh, let's say I had d was equal to one. I'm asking how many lines interpolate, should this be two points? Two points on the plane? How many lines pass through two points? That one we, I think we can figure out. This is one. Let's say d is two. I'm asking how many degree two curves? How many conics interpolate five points on p two? Well, five points uniquely determine a conic. So this is also equal to one and three. I know Taylor knows this.
00:44:53.056 - 00:45:28.394, Speaker A: It's equal to twelve and n four is equal to 620. And then you can sort of keep going. I was really hoping one of these was equal to 60, because that would be a really fun part of the talk, but that, sadly didn't happen. Okay, so Kinsevich gave recursive formulas for these using tools from Gramov Witten theory. And this sort of goes very deep into the realm of mathematics. But again, this conference is about, or at least today is about real algebraic geometry. And this story is taking place over c.
00:45:28.394 - 00:46:49.894, Speaker A: So you could ask what happens over the reals? And if we look at this n three problem, if I go over r and I take twelve points on rp two, I can ask how many rational cubics interpolate these? And I think we'll hear a lot more about this story in person's talk next. But I can have 810 or twelve cubics interpolating twelve points, or, sorry, interpolating eight points. And this really depends on the placement of the points. In other words, if I summed over the curve c, so this is c of, you know, the right degree, interpolating three d minus one points. If I sum to one every time I see a curve, which is a fancy way to say I'm counting the curves, interpolating the points, I don't get a conserved quantity. So when you see something like this and it breaks over rubber, what we know is now, I think is you should, instead of summing a one every time you see an object, sum something else about the object. And it's a theorem that goes back to Velshin J that I can take a certain invariant of the curve and get a well defined sum here.
00:46:49.894 - 00:47:29.434, Speaker A: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the curve, and I'm going to take minus one to the number of isolated points of C. And I'll say what that means in a second. And the theorem is that this is well defined. In other words, it's independent of the choice of points that you started out with, provided you pick them sufficiently generally. Okay, so let me draw a couple examples for you. So, actually, oh, we're doing okay on time. A little more space for this.
00:47:29.434 - 00:48:07.790, Speaker A: So I should have drawn pictures of maximally inflected curves earlier. I just knew I'd erase them, and then I would be kicking myself at this point in the talk, because I would really want them on the board. But better late than never, I guess. I'm going to draw some for you now. So here's one of them looks like this. It has so three d minus two d is four. Here I should see six inflection points.
00:48:07.790 - 00:48:40.614, Speaker A: And then I've also got these extra points that lay out here. And these are what are called isolated points because they're real solutions to this curve, but they have complex tangency. If you want to think about this in like a. I've got some sphere. That's my cp one. It's sitting in some four manifold that's cp two, and it's coming and intersecting here and then just coming and barely touching rp two at these points. And I've got another one that I never quite know how to draw.
00:48:40.614 - 00:48:58.992, Speaker A: This looks like that got isolated points here and here. I believe those are the same points. Sorry, what? These are the same point. But I have two isolated points for these.
00:48:59.008 - 00:49:03.564, Speaker B: Yeah, but they have to be. They can't do this because then the antipodal points are identified.
00:49:04.344 - 00:49:07.144, Speaker A: Don't put them here and here. Okay. Yeah, sorry.
00:49:07.304 - 00:49:09.284, Speaker B: The problem with having v in the audience.
00:49:13.444 - 00:50:01.714, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so what do I have here? So what are the Velchan j invariants of each of these? The Velchan j invariance of c here is minus one cubed, because I have three isolated points that's equal to minus one. And the Velchan j invariant here is minus one squared, which is equal to one. Okay, so, uh, you can set up the Wronsky map. You can do it on a nice chart where you have all these things, and then you can compute brower degrees, and you can do it with the code that I outlined on Wednesday. And you can find equations for these curves. And you can compute the brower degrees at each of these.
00:50:01.714 - 00:50:21.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I brought up this problem just to motivate the Velshan j invariant. Yeah. They're not a priori related, but they have to be in some way, right?
00:50:21.194 - 00:50:23.738, Speaker B: Well, they're both rational curves. I think that's the only relation.
00:50:23.786 - 00:50:48.194, Speaker A: That is the only relation right now. Yeah. Okay. So what I see is that for this curve, if I compute the degree of the Wronsky, I'm going to fix some chart, some sort of ambient thing that's happening, and I'm going to compute the degree of the round scale in the chart. Again, it's only going to be defined up to some scalar due to orientation. But let's fix the same orientation to compute degrees on each of these sides. Here I'm going to get a minus one, and here I'm going to get a plus one.
00:50:48.194 - 00:52:07.834, Speaker A: Okay, so, a conjecture that I've formulated with Frank is the local degree of the Wronsky of the Wronsky map over r is equal to the Velshan Jane variant of the associated rational curve. The associated curve. So this is really, like Frank said, it's mysterious to suspect that there would really be, like, any interpretation of the local degree in terms of the geometry of the curve. It's very cool that it appears to align with some things that are coming from Grimau Witten theory. Maybe. Let me just say sort of what we know about this so far, we can prove it for degree four curves. This relies on work of Frank and Harlamov that classifies degree four maximally inflected planar curves up to isotopy.
00:52:07.834 - 00:52:16.154, Speaker A: We guess it's true for degree five. And like, computationally, a million examples can't be wrong.
00:52:16.594 - 00:52:17.454, Speaker B: Example.
00:52:23.474 - 00:52:54.488, Speaker A: If we. One of the reasons we can do this here is we understand a lot about the classification, because Frank and Karlamov did this. I learned at the start of this conference that Andre has classified maximally selected quintex up to isotopy. So hopefully we can use that to actually prove it for degree five and for degree six. Probably true. Yeah. There's a lot of numerical instability in solving these sorts of Schubert problems over.
00:52:54.576 - 00:52:55.704, Speaker B: In the current formulation.
00:52:55.824 - 00:52:56.200, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:56.272 - 00:52:58.864, Speaker B: And this is partially due to the problem with non standard reality.
00:52:58.944 - 00:54:05.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. I'm a little bit over time, I want to say one more thing really quickly, which is, if this is true, then I look at in the fiber over a point in the wronsky. So I can look at curves with one isolated point. And I'm going to take minus that, because I want to take minus one for each of these and I can sum the number of curves with two isolated points, and I can subtract the number of curves with three isolated points and so on. And what I'll get is the degree of the wronsky over r as computed by Ermico and Gabriela. If we believe that conjecture, what ends up being true or what ends up, we have some fairly strong evidence for this, is if you look at the vector whose ith entry is the number of c that has I isolated points.
00:54:05.434 - 00:54:52.254, Speaker A: This thing appears to be independent of the choice of flexes. So what do I mean by this? So I fix some isolated points downstairs. These are living in that projected space. I go upstairs to the gross millennium, and I look at the rational curves that interpolate these points, and I count how many points in the fiber have one isolated point, how many have two isolated points, how many have three. Those quantities appear not to change when you vary around in the base. And I want to just clarify that this is completely, this is independence of that conjecture. We have to believe it to align the global degrees.
00:54:52.254 - 00:55:08.084, Speaker A: But this conjecture wouldn't imply this. This is sort of a strictly stronger thing. And I'm a little bit over time, so I'll thank you there. Questions for Thomas.
00:55:09.784 - 00:55:18.744, Speaker D: I have a question about the kind of a comment about the bijection between real planar curves with prescribed flexes and standard young tableau.
00:55:18.904 - 00:55:19.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:19.464 - 00:56:01.804, Speaker D: Just if you have a real plane of curve with prescribed flexes, you can formulate that geometrically as a Schubert problem, and then you can find the solutions to it. And then I think that once you do that, you could, if you have a situation where the degree is enough, or if you have enough of those, I would think that you could use those to define kind of a dual shooter problem, to figure out what the flags were. And once you know what the flags were, I think you could go back through the forward Schubert problem and use the methods of Prabhu and Aramenko and Gabrielov to get the standard young tableau out of it. Does that sound like something that might work? It'd be a lot of work.
00:56:02.864 - 00:56:05.504, Speaker A: I'm not sure I fully understand it, but, yeah, we should talk about this.
00:56:05.544 - 00:56:06.920, Speaker D: Let me say it again to you later when we have more time.
00:56:06.952 - 00:56:34.572, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds great. Other questions? Can you say some more about why you believe the conjecture, about the invariant? Do you think it's true about d equals six, or do you think it's sort of a first guess? And given the challenges of computing, no, this is like a faith thing. This is like a I really want it to be true. The evidence is.
00:56:34.668 - 00:57:03.324, Speaker B: So the problem with d six is there's numerical instability for counting the number of isolated solitary points in the current formulation. But whenever Julie homotopy and the add ons I wrote have not died like a fish in a tank, the answer is yes. But half the time it's like your goldfish is dead. Okay, maybe three more times. But when that doesn't happen, both of these are true. There's. Guys.
00:57:03.324 - 00:57:08.624, Speaker B: Yeah. So I feel very good. Up to degree angle sets, the data.
00:57:09.564 - 00:57:37.036, Speaker A: I will say there are things about extended descent sets that we were working on that start failing at degree seven. So it's possible something like this might not work. But thank you for great talk. Of course. Can I ask you to say a word or two about, like, you're using the classification of degree four curves. Maybe you can use it for degree five curves. Isotopy here.
00:57:37.036 - 00:57:46.708, Speaker A: But like, what are the. I'm guessing there's some. A one homotopy theory that you have to put under the hood for the proof. No. Okay. Yeah, like, what's. Yeah.
00:57:46.708 - 00:58:16.314, Speaker A: What's crucial here is let me draw these a little bit differently, that the bi tangents are going to separate the isolated points from one another. This is not my argument. This is in Frank and Karl Moff's paper. But the bitangents will separate these isolated points. So as I do a rigid isotopy, or as I do some sort of isotopy of this thing, they remain separated. The isolated points can never cross over a bi tangent because it would violate they Zeus theorem. Right? So they have to remain away from one another.
00:58:16.314 - 00:58:22.514, Speaker A: Anything similarly, please, please. Yes. Yeah.
00:58:27.954 - 00:59:47.824, Speaker C: So for the queen kicks, I consider a dual curve, which has lots of flexes and dual tough low flexes. But for each flex of acrylic, there is a cusp. So, and this dual curve has self intersections. So if you mark its point of self centered dissection, there are two points on the curve, dual curve on the original curve in the same letter. Then you get some chord diagram connecting the same letters associated with. So what I proved, it was never finished, never published, is that. Well, when you deform the curve, chord diagram may change, but there is a unique reduction of this chord diagram that is associated with all the formations.
00:59:47.824 - 01:00:58.008, Speaker C: So I have exactly an explicit list of chord diagrams of dual curves. And for each, if you are given a queen k, you look at the dual curves, you produce a chord diagram, and you know which leave of the grass minor in particular, you can compare with Frank's boundary classification, which gives you the tableaus. Then you can assign a tableau explicitly to each given. So now in tableau, you know how to come that dimension and you can check this condition. But that's an, a variant that I was able to produce for twin text or sextext. Doesn't work because 60. There are three intersections in there, though curves for quintix, there are not.
01:00:58.008 - 01:01:00.684, Speaker C: And that's exactly why this is very.
01:01:03.324 - 01:01:16.464, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Can you say a word about why you believe the vector of number of C with I isolated points might be constant?
01:01:19.044 - 01:01:30.704, Speaker B: Million calculations can't be wrong. Yeah, so that actually the same vector wasn't necessarily, but it was observed in the taper column up we have.
01:01:33.564 - 01:01:33.948, Speaker A: This.
01:01:33.996 - 01:01:40.612, Speaker B: Extends to higher order flexors, where the conjecture we have does not appear to.
01:01:40.748 - 01:02:17.264, Speaker A: I think that's how we initially formulated the conjecture to where you're looking at that vector. And notice the alternating sum was equal to the degree of the real Wronsky. Can you write, can you write a couple of those vectors down? Do you remember them? Oh, it's on my laptop somewhere. I think Frank equals three and four. Frank gave a talk at Siam a while ago and had some slides on that. I think I'll ask later. Okay, let's thank Thomas again.
