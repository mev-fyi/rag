00:00:00.240 - 00:00:29.819, Speaker A: One of the most common ways that we see users earn yield on Bitcoin is actually to use bitcoin as collateral in lending market and then borrow stablecoins or ETH to farm somewhere else. I think right now is a fairly interesting time because technology has enabled like bitcoin to be staked. I think Babylon is just one of them but there are a few other protocols in the pipeline that are building something similar and would offer yield opportunities for bitcoin.
00:00:29.867 - 00:01:08.663, Speaker B: Blockmates Orange is sponsored by Core Network, the ultimate Bitcoin powered EVM compatible blockchain. Learn more about core@blockmates.com welcome back everyone. Special guest today, Tien from Pendle. Been wanting to speak to tian for about 30 years. No, just joking. Ever since the end of the last bull market, Pendle was born, grinded out the bear markets, came up with some really good ideas, delivered in absolute loads and so good to have you on the show today Tien.
00:01:08.663 - 00:01:14.815, Speaker B: Thank you for joining us. I assume it's quite late that side, so. Yeah, I really appreciate you making the time.
00:01:14.935 - 00:01:19.345, Speaker A: Welcome, thanks for having me. Yeah, it's good to be here.
00:01:19.505 - 00:01:45.455, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a pleasure man. And obviously CEO, co founder, you've definitely walked the walk. You've talked to talk. How does it feel to kind of like be in the situation you guys are in at the moment from a Pendle perspective, Obviously huge success. Just come back from 2014 from Singapore, from token 2049. What's been going through your mind? What's been happening? How are you guys feeling at the moment?
00:01:46.715 - 00:03:06.737, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think it's if, I mean this year we've been very, very fortunate. We were able to ride the restaking narrative quite successfully and grew our TVL substantially in a very short period of time. I think the feeling, especially the first billion dollar TVL was extremely surreal because I think very few protocols have achieved that and now we're one of them. And then the subsequent like say billions, they were all very nice. But also at the same time we were thinking about how else we can grow the protocol because ultimately I think this is still a very, very beginning of Pendle. There's, there's a lot more that we can offer beyond just points trading. I think we started out wanting to enable rates to be traded, rates within crypto and hopefully in the far future, hopefully not too far from now, actually we can also start working on some of the rates that are not specific to crypto, but that's probably further down and we don't actually have concrete idea around it yet.
00:03:06.737 - 00:03:09.265, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just, it's a vision.
00:03:09.385 - 00:03:28.113, Speaker B: Obviously, you guys built a lot of interest out of offering points as a point system. There's a lot of people in the market that think points are done and dusted. You guys don't think that's the case? Are you going to continue with points? Is there another chapter? What does that look like?
00:03:28.289 - 00:04:20.949, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So internally we think that points will continue to be around because points are actually a very good way for protocols to gather initial traction. There are some differences though, like between now and then, I think specifically back in the first half of the year because points were relatively novel. So there were a lot of inefficiencies around the pricing of points and especially because. Sorry. And when Pendle made all these points tradable, I think most users couldn't really figure out how to price points and an outcome of it was just overbidding for whiteies because of the implied leverage. Right.
00:04:20.949 - 00:05:25.499, Speaker A: And also just general bull sentiment across the market, which also resulted in very, very healthy fixed yield on the PT side. So created all like the very interesting dynamics between PT and YT trades. Fast forward. Yeah. After points, some of the protocols have realized the points to actual tradable tokens like etherfi, Renzo and Binary. There's a lot more data points now for users to reference to and I think moving forward, the pricing of points will become more efficient because there's a bit more knowledge in that domain and I think the premium that is allocated to just Points campaign will continue to erode. So, yeah, effectively what it means right now is that if a good project issues points, I think the community will still be excited about it.
00:05:25.499 - 00:06:23.085, Speaker A: But if a shit project issues points today, it's not going to make a lot of difference. So what it means is basically that community sentiments for points will gravitate towards how they view the prospect of the project, which is very different from a couple of months ago. So, yeah, with respect to where we think the points will grow. So firstly, I think the premium for points will erode, but we see that there is a potential resurgence of interest around points in the Bitcoin, sorry, BTC 5 segment, starting with Babylon and then Babylon, LSTs and a host of other L2s that are also issuing points. So we are now becoming involved in this segment and we're hoping to grow this BTC5 segment along with all these different participants and stakeholders.
00:06:24.825 - 00:07:14.283, Speaker B: Okay. So I mean, obviously that's why you're here today. So as a, as an introduction to, you know, the podcast today, I mean, this is a bitcoin centric podcast that obviously looks at, you know, the evolution of Bitcoin in its current form, particularly Bitcoin defi. I mean we, we've, we've obviously had a lot of time in the, in the trenches that is EVM and obviously Ethereum and, and this understanding that is defi. But now we're seeing something that's quite topical. But in my opinion it's something that's actually even more important in many ways to, you know, what Ethereum has achieved. And that is that we have the most valuable crypto asset that is Bitcoin, which in many ways you could argue is quite simple.
00:07:14.283 - 00:08:10.295, Speaker B: Even though we could study it for many years and we can have many discussions around it, which a lot of the Maxis have done. There isn't really this idea of extracting value beyond Bitcoin as a savings account or a savings vehicle. Pendle has obviously had this really interesting journey around obviously extracting value through yield process and obviously creating value around, expanding the concept of saving, expanding the concept of collateralization. Now we have Bitcoin entering into the fold. Trillion plus dollar asset. I think the question to kick this thing off is possibly an obvious answer, but maybe not. Why, why go into the space at this time? What is the interest? Where do you guys currently see the value in that process?
00:08:11.395 - 00:09:43.395, Speaker A: Yeah, so like you pointed out, right, Bitcoin is the single largest asset within the crypto segment, over a trillion dollar in market cap. So from our perspective at least, like in my opinion, right, I think there is a sizable group of users who hold Bitcoin would like to utilize Bitcoin to generate wealth. But right now, because of tech limitations and possibly other considerations, there aren't that many avenues for users to utilize Bitcoin to earn yield. One of the most common ways that we see users earn yield on Bitcoin is actually to use Bitcoin as collateral in lending market and then borrow stable coins or eth to farm somewhere else. I think right now is a fairly interesting time because technology has enabled like Bitcoin to be staked. I think Babylon is just one of them, but there are a few other protocols in the pipeline that are building something similar and would offer yield opportunities for Bitcoin. And then on top of Avalon, There are also LSTs like Lombard and Uni, BTC, Solve, BTC and a host of others that will make all these red bitcoins usable for defi activities.
00:09:43.395 - 00:10:39.585, Speaker A: So the hope is that just given the fact that the bitcoin market cap is so big if we're able to convert maybe 1 to 2% of that TVL, sorry, that market value for DEFI activities, I think we have a fairly sizable addressable market. That is where we think the market is heading toward and we want to position ourselves to capitalize on this particular trend. That is why we're working with a number of protocols, including the ones that I've just mentioned, and then the Bitcoin L2s that are also trying to utilize all these bitcoin assets to power their ecosystem. I think there's a lot more that we can expect in the coming months. But the way I see it, we're still at the very, very early stages of BTC fi.
00:10:40.485 - 00:11:16.467, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we obviously we're very fortunate that we've done quite a lot of work with the core DAO team and we've covered what they've been doing quite extensively. And. And I mean, the interesting thing is that you know, obviously kind of like side chains versus Altus. I mean, that's obviously another discussion in itself which we actually addressed on the show. Because I think right now at the very essence of it, I think it looks like everything is a side chain, but it doesn't really matter whether it's. Whether you label it alt your side chain. The point is that there is this meaningful interaction between what we understand, if I to be.
00:11:16.467 - 00:11:39.705, Speaker B: And obviously bringing bitcoin into the fold. I'm very curious to find out how you guys are going to position yourselves in the context. Are you going to go and do the partnership side of things within these ecosystems, or are you going to bring these ecosystems or aspects of those ecosystems onto the Pendle EVM protocol?
00:11:41.085 - 00:12:39.219, Speaker A: So I think there are probably two stages that we can explore, collaborations and partnership at this stage. Given that most of the protocols, especially the L2s or sidechains, are not live yet, we can only work with them in the EVM premise. So yeah, at this stage our value add is really to help all these upcoming L2s to bootstrap liquidity by running pre deposit campaigns. So what we do is we create markets for users to deposit some of the Babylon LSTs like Lombard Uni BTC and soft BTC into pools that were set up by. That they were set up for the likes of the. Sorry. They were set up for the L2s, such as corn and a few others in the pipeline.
00:12:39.219 - 00:13:52.315, Speaker A: Now the plan is when these L2s become live, when their mainnet is ready in a couple of months, we can help with the migration of liquidity from the current pools to their L2s. So this is, I think, a more effective way of getting liquidity on day one versus the more conventional means. Because historically a lot of L2s or new ecosystems would have to bootstrap liquidity by issuing tokens and then gradually build up the liquidity traction versus right now with Pendle, we're running pre deposit campaigns for a lot of these ecosystems and then accumulate sufficient traction. And then when the mainnet is live, incentivize the liquidity migration from the current set of pools on ethereum to their L2s so that they have, yeah, maybe hopefully hundreds of millions of dollars in TVL when the chain is live.
00:13:53.215 - 00:14:05.205, Speaker B: So is it a, is it a process of creating pools that facilitate the various forms of wrapped BTC that are currently in existence? Is that the idea?
00:14:06.065 - 00:15:04.425, Speaker A: Yes, that is the idea. So just to illustrate right now how we're structuring the campaign is something like this. Right at the base of it there is a Babylon layer. And then in the middle part there's a Babylon lst, which is, which could be at the moment there's Lombard UniBTC and Solve BTC. And then to top it off, there's Korn, which is an L2 that takes in the Babylon LST as deposit asset. So when a user interacts with Pendle and deposit into the corn market, right, Whether it's for corn LBTC or corn unibtc, the user is immediately exposed to three layers of points. There's quant points with its own multiplier, and then Lombard points, or UNIBTC points, or SOL points with its own multiplier as well, and then Babylon points.
00:15:04.425 - 00:15:25.945, Speaker A: So collectively, all these points will accrue to the yield tokens. And from what I can see as of today, the range of the implied yield is trading at around like 6 to closer to 9%, which also means that the fixed yield on bitcoin is between 6 to 9%.
00:15:27.845 - 00:15:59.745, Speaker B: Okay, so the biggest, the biggest challenge here is how do you get somebody who might consider themselves to be a bitcoin maxi to hand over their BTC into the idea of contract risk? I mean, is there kind of like. Well, this is what it is and we, we've proven ourselves over the last four years. Is it all intents and purposes safe or is there another process that you guys need to undergo from an educational perspective in order to persuade these people?
00:16:00.645 - 00:17:02.147, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot of education effort needed in order to convince someone who has, who has not interacted with DEFI contracts to put something Into a DEFI protocol. Right? To put a precious asset into a DEFI protocol. I think ultimately there's still a pretty big gap at this point in time. From what I can tell, there's a pretty big gap in user experience. So for comparison, when we launched the restaking market, we were targeting a group of users who are already familiar with DEFI activities. They are generally quite aware of contracts, the notion of contracts and all the peripheral infrastructure, like wallets, like signatures, all those things. When it comes to Bitcoin, it's fairly different here.
00:17:02.147 - 00:18:01.273, Speaker A: So I think I was going through the process myself a couple of weeks ago. In order to take part in the Kendall markets, I would actually have to use LBTC from Lombard to deposit into the pool. Now in order to get lbtc, I would have to deposit my raw BTC into, into a designated wallet that Lombard provides and then after which LBTC will be minted in my ERC20 wallet. So this process requires some form of bridging. Right. And it's hard to consolidate it in a single step versus like, unlike, unlike how we did it with restaking. So I think from a UX standpoint this is one big difference that is not that simple to resolve.
00:18:01.273 - 00:18:59.233, Speaker A: And then of course like when it comes to general awareness, we are also looking at a slightly different group of users because a lot of users who have eth, they are fairly comfortable with contracts. But when it comes to retail users, especially retail users with Bitcoin, to get them to learn all these different components of defi, it's going to take some time. So we'll have to explore how we can best distribute some of these opportunities through distribution partners, for example, centralized exchanges, wallet providers, even trading Desk. Right. Lending Trading desk. They could potentially put together structured products that might be interesting to some of their customers. Then the desk can actually handle the wrapping of assets and deposit of assets into pools.
00:18:59.233 - 00:19:02.605, Speaker A: So these are different avenues that we're considering at the moment.
00:19:04.305 - 00:19:37.345, Speaker B: This kind of like really ties in, I think quite well to a question that I wanted to ask you. Just kind of like going, taking a step back now and looking at Pendle as a, as a protocol, as a business that offers these, these, these yield strategies. Right. Have you guys seen an interest from your traditional institutions up until this point is, are you having those conversations? Are you seeing institutions using the protocol? What's, what's the landscape looking like from that perspective?
00:19:37.965 - 00:20:36.231, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think when it comes to institution, we tend to have a relatively broad definition of what constitutes an institution. By our definition, we consider any Fund with more than $30 million in AUM to be an institution. So there are actually quite a lot of hedge funds that are 100% crypto who and involved in defi now by institutions. If we're looking at, say, the more traditional ones, aside from family offices, then I would say they would be more hesitant to consider a defi protocol for yield generation. They would probably be more comfortable with maybe a brokerage where kyc KYB are enforced. But yeah, in our case, because of. Yeah, there could be multiple reasons.
00:20:36.231 - 00:20:55.845, Speaker A: Many times they might not be familiar with defi and they don't have the technical competency to evaluate the contracts. So they would prefer to stick with something that offers steady, lower yield, but at least predictable versus taking on more risk despite the higher yield.
00:20:57.945 - 00:21:40.655, Speaker B: I find that really interesting because the way that I imagine DEFI to be is kind of like this environment that allows for that. That flow of capital, whether it's, you know, a hedge fund that is solely focused on. On crypto 100% or whether it's a black rock that's coming in and saying, you know what, Pendle, can you please build us a protocol? That is essentially Pendle, but obviously in the context of what us as BlackRock would like to. To present it to the world as, and then it's kind of like business as usual, but it seems like we might have quite a way to go. Is that a fair assessment of the situation right now?
00:21:41.995 - 00:21:45.195, Speaker A: That is my. My understanding, yeah.
00:21:45.235 - 00:22:16.705, Speaker B: Okay. And then in terms of, okay, so now let's kind of like move forward on the bitcoin side of things. Do you think that as a business, you guys would have to almost package the true sense of traditional finance institution differently in terms of selling this amazing product that you guys have built? It's been tried and tested, it's been battle tested. It does what it says on the box. Would you have to approach it in a different way, do you think? And is this something that you guys are potentially interested in doing?
00:22:17.525 - 00:22:57.607, Speaker A: Yes, maybe not immediately, but I think further down, definitely something of interest because for one, I think even though I think there's a lot more potential on defi, I also think we shouldn't have to confine ourselves to just defi opportunities. It's still a very big world out there. But of course, to begin, we will be defi native and we will focus on defi. It's just that maybe in a couple of years with a bit of restructuring, we might be ready to take on newer kind of opportunities outside of the.
00:22:57.631 - 00:23:45.803, Speaker B: Context of DeFi yeah, I mean, it's really. I think that's also quite an interesting discussion to have around having a token and having value accrual through a token versus being a business that actually offers this incredible potential around, like, enhancing a product like Bitcoin, enhancing a product like Ethereum. Ethereum. It doesn't matter. I mean, you guys, I think from looking. From the outside looking in, I think you guys have done a really good job primarily around, obviously, building a product, but secondly around those partnerships that you guys have built. And I mean, I can see you sitting down and doing something with, you know, one of the big institutions, whether it's a Van Neck or blackrock or the rest of it.
00:23:45.803 - 00:24:46.595, Speaker B: So, yes, expectations are high for you guys, but I think you've proven yourself to be able to actually play in quite a competitive market. And speaking of competitive markets, I'm really curious to. To get your thoughts around, you know, how you guys have kind of, like, adapted to, you know, being in a bull market then being in a bear market, because there's not many protocols that have done that. You know, like, generally protocols do really well in a bull market, and then a bear market comes and, you know, they basically lose the plot or they don't have the answers. And you guys have managed to navigate both, both those aspects. Where do you think we are in terms of the evolution of crypto right now? I mean, or your relationship with the evolution of crypto? Has it changed since kind of like the last. The last cycle going into a bear and then into this one? I mean, is it the same? What are your thoughts around that?
00:24:47.575 - 00:25:21.285, Speaker A: Oh, tough question. Some aspect of it, I think, has remained and sustained. But there are differences, of course. I think in terms of. Yeah, in terms of the level of sophistication, it has definitely improved. We see. We see more establish players with strong track record, like maybe in trading or building, getting into the space and really shipping very interesting products.
00:25:21.285 - 00:25:56.705, Speaker A: Some of these might take some time to deliver, but they are in the pipelines. Right. So not really proven. With no proven track record, trying to build a protocol, most of them didn't succeed. But for the ones that did, they continue to be very relevant today. And I think, And I think, yeah, this sort of cycle will continue to persist. I also think that in terms of the.
00:25:56.705 - 00:27:25.385, Speaker A: Okay, in the past, the level of optimism and pessimism, they were much more extreme. So, like, for example, I remember in 2018 and 2019, a lot of people, because it was. It was a bear market, a lot of people were speculating that crypto is doomed. And then crypto asset prices tanked pretty badly and a lot of early participants had to figure out ways to maybe regain their footings and search for opportunities. I was actually one of them because I was feeling a little discouraged looking at the fraction on chain activity, and that didn't seem to go anywhere these days. I believe that there's a lot more people are less pessimistic about crypto in general, and those who are optimistic will continue to be. So I don't think anyone would say crypto is doomed right now, just given that there are bigger institutions that are really recognizing crypto as an asset and then having Bitcoin and ether in their company treasury balance sheet.
00:27:25.385 - 00:27:34.875, Speaker A: So the appetite for it has definitely improved. Yeah, I believe it should continue to improve over time.
00:27:35.735 - 00:28:35.345, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you and I think there's a lot of credit to that. Through protocols like Pendle coming in and obviously building stuff that actually has a use case as opposed to kind of like the degen gambling aspect to things. Obviously AAVE has done really well over the last couple of months, just kind of reinforcing the idea that find a use case, find a product market fit and you can do really well in the space. You know, not only for the short term, but for the long term. Just looking back kind of like to the whole BTC side of things, is Pendle looking from a long term perspective to be completely diversified across many ecosystems, or is there kind of like an idea of being resident in one place and kind of using an Omnichain approach to doing things?
00:28:36.525 - 00:28:56.495, Speaker A: I think from a scaling standpoint, we definitely want to be able to support more assets across different ecosystem. Especially considering that right now it's so easy to spin up a new L1 or L2 literally in minutes, right?
00:28:56.795 - 00:28:57.691, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:57.883 - 00:29:38.425, Speaker A: It is very likely that in the near future there would be a lot more ecosystems that will exist. And just given our current set of implementation, we have to scale better. So what we're building in V3 is something a bit more chain agnostic. And the hope is the plan is that we want to capture more opportunities within and outside of the EVM ecosystem.
00:29:39.535 - 00:29:59.631, Speaker B: So I mean in terms of your kind of like your, your, your presence at the moment, where are you guys? Where do you guys have a good presence and a presence that has good TVL and has obviously a lot of volume moving through? So obviously Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Arbitrum is.
00:29:59.743 - 00:30:40.625, Speaker A: Pretty good, but I'd say Arbitrum is also fairly seasonal. In general, the activity level on Arbitrum has come down somewhat substantially in the last couple of months. So that has affected our presence on Arbitrum as well. But I believe they're working on strategies to bring about the activities back to the chain. So as one of the bigger protocols on Arbitrum, we will, we hope to benefit from the inflow of capital and activities there, hopefully in the next couple of months.
00:30:41.165 - 00:30:45.945, Speaker B: And where else do you guys have a presence? Solana? Not yet. You are on Solana?
00:30:46.725 - 00:30:54.173, Speaker A: No, not on Solana. We have a presence on Mental Optimism and BNB Chain.
00:30:54.349 - 00:31:11.175, Speaker B: Okay, and how are those doing at the moment? I mean, for me, Mental has got all this potential. I think they've. They've done all the right things, but for some reason, it seems like there hasn't really been the kind of traction that I would have expected. I mean, are you also finding the same thing?
00:31:12.315 - 00:31:54.655, Speaker A: Well, generally speaking, I think the activity outside of Ethereum has been. Has been relatively slow in the last couple of. Couple of months, I think. I think most users are probably reverting back to using Ethereum in the meantime, until there's something more interesting and unique in each of these ecosystems. And then users would migrate their liquidity from ETH to whichever ecosystem it is, earn some yield, and then consider whether to stay on or move back to Ethereum.
00:31:55.035 - 00:32:05.815, Speaker B: And the prospects on Solana. Is that something that you guys are looking at or will. Will be looking at, or is there not really an interest for kind of Solana Defi at the moment?
00:32:06.275 - 00:32:14.971, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, so Solana is definitely something of interest, I think. Yeah, it's just. It's just a matter of time.
00:32:15.163 - 00:32:49.025, Speaker B: All right, great. So that's a little bit of alpha. I'm gonna, I'm gonna claim that as mine, so thank you for that. In terms of kind of like just closing off, what is the, you know, as. As CEO, as a co founder, when you, when you sit down with your co founder and your team, what is the vision that you guys would like to work towards? I mean, what is kind of like the ultimate, you know. Right. Obviously, you know, this might change, but I think, you know, it'll be a good idea as to, you know, where you guys are looking and what you're aiming for.
00:32:50.105 - 00:33:57.545, Speaker A: So we want to push the boundaries of yields and eventually become the premier destination for anything that's got to do with yield. After all, I think we were drawn into crypto because of the prospects of APYs, and for a long time, APYs, APYs, they were just numbers. When Pendle came about we tokenize these APYs and we make them tradable. So suddenly these numbers can actually be swapped and there's additional utility there. So right now I think with the V2 implementation, we're still confined to a specific set of yield like for example lending yield on AAVE compound. So these are the ones that we are supporting. And then points being another form eth staking yield through STE and RE can be supported, but there are so many more types of yields.
00:33:57.545 - 00:35:05.205, Speaker A: There are other types of yields that are very, very significant but still unaddressed or at least unaddressed at scale. For example, I think borrowing rates is one of those market that can be very interesting. If I'm a borrower, I'd like to have some certainty over the amount over the rates that I'm paying my cost of capital so that I can be more certain about how much I cost. This and another time is actually on, I think on the POS yield like if staking yield. Solana staking yield. As it is, there are markets and desks that facilitate the trading of the staking yield, but because they're generally traded as if a spot market, it's usually not very interesting. Considering the fluctuation of yield for staking yield.
00:35:05.205 - 00:35:27.495, Speaker A: Right. Like between 3 and 6%. Yeah, I think with leverage it can be more meaningful and then we could probably encourage more users to express their views on how the rates will move. Yeah, so those are some of the things that we look to achieve in the future.
00:35:28.355 - 00:36:00.533, Speaker B: Nice. Looking forward to that. I mean that's, that's quite a big expansion from where you guys are at the moment, but obviously very doable, I'm sure. And look, really look forward to, you know, the development and the growth that obviously is Pendle T. Thanks for your time. I really appreciate firstly getting to the point and not kind of like doing a rehash of questions that people asked you over and over and just jumping right in. I really appreciate that and allowing me to do that.
