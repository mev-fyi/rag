00:00:00.160 - 00:00:07.780, Speaker A: Blockmates Orange is sponsored by Core Network, the ultimate Bitcoin powered EVM compatible blockchain. Learn more about core@blockmates.com.
00:00:12.960 - 00:00:41.950, Speaker B: Welcome back everyone. Another episode of a Blockmotes Orange. We have Russ from Core, from corex, one of the main dexes, if not the main decks on the Core DA ecosystem. User experience, simplicity. Yeah, a whole lot of TVL and yeah, just basically taking the whole bitcoin defi space by storm. Obviously. Well established.
00:00:41.950 - 00:00:51.450, Speaker B: Russ, welcome. It's good to have you. Thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy and I know it's early on your side of the world, so I really appreciate you taking the time out.
00:00:52.710 - 00:01:38.920, Speaker C: Great to be on the show, great to be invited. Looking forward to all the discussions we can go through today. I think corex is a pretty exciting product. There has been a tremendous interest even as we see in the market with the capital rotation into bitcoin. I think BTCFI is still at its early stage but has already shown a lot of advantage in terms of product, in terms of technology and a lot for interest coming from both traditional and web3 institutionals. So yeah, I think we have a lot to discuss. Very excited to go through all the questions.
00:01:39.660 - 00:01:56.630, Speaker B: Great. Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot to discuss. But before we get into the broad strokes of Bitcoin Defi and what you guys are doing, tell us a little bit about yourself, what you do obviously at corex and what brought you to this very moment. How did it all begin for you in crypto?
00:01:56.970 - 00:03:04.910, Speaker C: Sure, love it. So yeah, my name is Russ. I am the founder and CEO for corex and funny thing is I actually personally never really had a tech background. I have always been kind of on the operational side, business operational side. I actually came from a tradfi background and that really is demonstrated by the center thesis of our Corex products. So I worked in State street for some time and I actually acted as a desk trader. Following that I started with a few other friends, started a fund that invested in different vehicles from literally from commercial real estate such as, such as hotels, office spaces to equities to you know, crypto projects.
00:03:04.910 - 00:03:17.042, Speaker C: That's how I got in the industry initially. Initially I was an investor, a trader and yeah, I came into the web.
00:03:17.106 - 00:03:22.658, Speaker D: Today's podcast is sponsored by Glyph. Glyph is a non custodial decentralized exchange.
00:03:22.754 - 00:03:24.514, Speaker B: Operating on the Core network.
00:03:24.682 - 00:04:07.028, Speaker D: As you know, we've spent a lot of time focusing on bitcoin Defy on this podcast and essentially what Glyph is Doing is replicating what Uni Swap has done on Ethereum. So they are obviously dedicated in developing a sustainable and innovative decks on top of Bitcoin, much like Uniswap and just taking this whole Bitcoin narrative to the next level. So they've got a unique non custodial approach which allows users to retain ownership of their Bitcoin while enjoying the benefits of a decentralized exchange experience. Their website is Glyph Exchange and you can go and trade a variety of assets there like BTC, USDT, USDC and a lot more. Go check them out.
00:04:07.084 - 00:05:06.560, Speaker C: 3 space. I saw a lot of potential with DeFi. Got me super interested. Wanted to build some projects in the beginning that was back in 1819, but I quickly realized my lack of full understanding of the technology itself which hindered my ability to successfully launch anything. And also at the time I was less connected to a lot of leaders in the industry. That prompted me into working with couple of centralized exchanges. So I went into HTX first and started as a bd, just a small bd, worked there for almost three years which was I guess kind of a long time considering exchanges does have a very high turnover.
00:05:06.560 - 00:06:17.140, Speaker C: Stayed there. Eventually I was part of the team that's responsible for the strategic partnerships for the exchange in the US and European region. After I left htx, I did join another centralized exchange first. ARK acted as their kind of go to market chief, Go to market, then acted as their CEO for some time. But through this, you know, through those experiences, I think number one my background as a trader allows me to kind of understand what traders needs, how can they make better and and more educated trading decisions, have better returns. That's something that I have not yet seen in the market and that's what corex is trying to fulfill. We're trying to be extremely intuitive, easy to trade with a lot of comprehensive amount of information kind of condensed into one platform, easy to navigate.
00:06:17.140 - 00:07:08.054, Speaker C: At the same time, I think being in centralized exchange it also demonstrates that, okay, so people do want to use a more user friendly interface, they do want to see more tools and how can that all come together to aid traders and help them make more money. So ultimately I'm trying to bring that centralized exchange trading experience to a decentralized platform that's somewhat similar to a tradfi trading experience. I think ultimately that's going to be the key to achieve mass adoption for exchanges in the web. 3 space. So yeah, that's kind of, I guess not only a brief introduction about myself, but also the Product itself.
00:07:08.182 - 00:07:08.850, Speaker E: Right?
00:07:10.190 - 00:08:09.480, Speaker B: Yeah. I think it's really good to see that the space has obviously evolved from, you know, the, the, the basics of, you know, what we expect from a Dex. You know, like way back in the day you could hardly read the text, but now it's become, you know, the business is more about the user experience as opposed to, you know, the Dex itself. And, and it's great to hear that, you know, you guys have taken that to heart and more importantly, you know, delivered on that. So I wanted to kind of ask you a general question to kick things off, you know, on, on, on this whole idea of bitcoin defi. And you know, for many years we kind of like saw bitcoin essentially as, you know, story value. It started out as a payment or the peer to peer payment network.
00:08:09.480 - 00:08:17.750, Speaker B: And it kind of evolved in terms of the way that we, we, I think, prescribed value to bitcoin.
00:08:18.730 - 00:08:20.402, Speaker D: But then it didn't really do anything.
00:08:20.466 - 00:09:13.590, Speaker B: You know, beyond the fact that it was almost in many ways like, I think one dimensional is the wrong word or the wrong thing to call it because it's, I think there's a lot of complexity in bitcoin, you know, just in its, in its purest form. But then all of a sudden, I think in the last 12 to 18 months we've seen this, the surge of interest around bitcoin, obviously around an etf, but more importantly, this whole idea of bitcoin defi. And the question for you is like, why has bitcoin defi only now taken this amount of time to kind of like get momentum and we're now identifying it as bitcoin defi. Why didn't it happen, you know, in 2019 or 2018 or even in 2020? What, what do you think has changed around Bitcoin?
00:09:14.170 - 00:09:29.170, Speaker F: I think, I think really from a few different angles. Like you said, like you said, bitcoin was originally just product to reserve value, right?
00:09:29.210 - 00:09:34.702, Speaker C: Much like gold. In fact, people called it digital gold.
00:09:34.886 - 00:09:48.370, Speaker F: Even Warren Buffett talked about bitcoin as, you know, a kind of a reserve for value, but it does not generate any additional value. And in fact, that's why he himself never became an investor in bitcoin.
00:09:51.110 - 00:09:54.446, Speaker C: Traditionally, all the protocols, especially defi, they're.
00:09:54.478 - 00:10:06.750, Speaker F: Built on Ethereum, right? I think when bitcoin come out, people were investing it. It was part of obviously the number one asset in the blockchain space.
00:10:07.050 - 00:10:10.050, Speaker C: But bitcoin was, you know, it had.
00:10:10.090 - 00:10:27.440, Speaker F: Its limitations in terms of functionality. The block generates basically 10 minutes, one block every 10 minutes. That's way too slow for it to be really functional. Not to mention that Bitcoin itself, like.
00:10:27.480 - 00:10:32.704, Speaker C: Elon Musk said too, it's hard to be a transactional tool, even though that.
00:10:32.792 - 00:10:34.560, Speaker F: In the original white paper it does.
00:10:34.600 - 00:10:40.540, Speaker C: Describe to be a transactional tool, but it is volatile to start.
00:10:41.560 - 00:10:46.320, Speaker F: Secondly, the transaction process and kind of.
00:10:46.360 - 00:10:48.448, Speaker C: Expense are a little bit too high.
00:10:48.504 - 00:10:50.740, Speaker F: To be used as a normal currency.
00:10:52.000 - 00:10:56.824, Speaker C: So then I think while a lot.
00:10:56.832 - 00:11:08.232, Speaker F: Of L2 ROPS came out on top of Bitcoin, it opened up the door for really functionality and what's possible to.
00:11:08.256 - 00:11:10.140, Speaker C: Be built on top of Bitcoin.
00:11:10.880 - 00:11:19.860, Speaker F: And among of them, I think Core is definitely a leader in the sense that while other L2s or sidechains are.
00:11:19.900 - 00:11:23.732, Speaker C: Still being kind of at a vicious.
00:11:23.796 - 00:11:28.676, Speaker F: Stage where they have a grand vision, they want to build something out, they're.
00:11:28.708 - 00:11:32.532, Speaker C: Talking about this, talking about that. But when you look back, Core is.
00:11:32.556 - 00:11:53.600, Speaker F: The only one that actually has been on mainnet, has pushed out a product and has been operating for some time. A lot of things that people are talking about, such as bitcoin staking, has been happening with Core. In fact, Core Chain itself has the most bitcoin staked at this moment, leading by quite a bit.
00:11:54.460 - 00:11:56.132, Speaker C: I think bitcoin does have a lot.
00:11:56.156 - 00:12:19.090, Speaker F: Of potential in the sense that, yeah, there are ETFs for Bitcoin, right? People are coming in because they believe there is price appreciation potential in here and transferring money. They want to obviously gain from that. When we look at different asset classes.
00:12:19.910 - 00:12:24.238, Speaker C: We are potentially cutting rates and new.
00:12:24.294 - 00:12:47.990, Speaker F: Bonds are going to be less attractive. Equities have been growing for such a long time. Everything valuation wise has been kind of crazy, especially anything tech related, anything AI related, that has kind of expectation, they have been growing at terrifying PE ratio. Now that when you look at crypto.
00:12:49.130 - 00:12:52.466, Speaker C: Industry, no doubt crypto industry is also.
00:12:52.618 - 00:13:01.688, Speaker F: Valued relatively high, but it is still overall a small industry with a lot of growing potentials.
00:13:01.834 - 00:13:02.476, Speaker E: Right.
00:13:02.628 - 00:13:08.716, Speaker F: And one other angle I want to remind is the regulatory clarity.
00:13:08.828 - 00:13:10.908, Speaker C: I think one reason that crypto industry.
00:13:10.964 - 00:13:27.564, Speaker F: Has remained to be relatively small compared to equities or fixed income is because ultimately the mass adoption of crypto has not yet happened. Right. We in the industry think, oh, everyone.
00:13:27.652 - 00:13:31.456, Speaker C: Is familiar with it. There are many conferences that DEFCON is.
00:13:31.528 - 00:13:44.320, Speaker F: Happening right now, right? A lot of conferences, a lot of things going on in the industry. We think it's grand, but in fact, when we compare the entire industry, it's smaller than a lot of firms out.
00:13:44.360 - 00:13:48.368, Speaker C: There like Microsoft, like Nvidia, right.
00:13:48.504 - 00:14:05.552, Speaker F: Compared to those firms, the entire industry is smaller. Yeah, I think we need the massive adoption to happen and regulatory clarity across the world in different countries. Even in the US There has been a lot of progress.
00:14:05.696 - 00:14:07.664, Speaker C: And that, you know, that shows, you.
00:14:07.672 - 00:14:09.712, Speaker F: Know, you're seeing traditional money coming in.
00:14:09.816 - 00:14:12.060, Speaker C: You'Re seeing that there's more and more.
00:14:12.520 - 00:14:51.312, Speaker F: Ads being displayed, being allowed eventually. I do believe that the decentralized landscape of blockchain can offer a lot of value to people by allowing them owning their own asset on chain. And that's a very attractive value proposition once they do be aboard, aborted to this industry. I think this industry at least has at least. I don't want to, you know, give financial advice, but I think right now it's definitely too small. I think we should be at least one third or maybe half of what equity market offers.
00:14:51.376 - 00:14:51.980, Speaker E: Right?
00:14:53.920 - 00:15:26.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree with you. So do you think that from this point onwards we have kind of like an acceleration or do you think we still have, particularly with bitcoin defy, that is. Do you think that there's still a whole lot of learning that needs to happen where it is kind of like one step forward, two steps back? Or do you think we figured things out to the extent that, you know, we can actually approach the big institutions like the blackrocks and the rest of it to actually come and play in the bitcoin defi space?
00:15:28.380 - 00:15:41.680, Speaker F: Yeah, I think, I think first of all, the adoption will always be a little bit difficult, right. Unless the policy maker changes their.
00:15:43.420 - 00:15:43.732, Speaker C: Kind.
00:15:43.756 - 00:16:02.870, Speaker F: Of changes their objective and perspective quite drastically, which is possible. Right. In the US we're having the election today, which is really a big milestone because if the US become more crypto friendly, it will lead the world.
00:16:02.990 - 00:16:03.318, Speaker E: Right?
00:16:03.374 - 00:16:13.018, Speaker F: Everyone will become more crypto friendly and that could really speed up the process and the speed of adoption.
00:16:13.174 - 00:16:13.682, Speaker E: Right?
00:16:13.786 - 00:16:40.242, Speaker F: I think for bitcoin environments, no doubt there's gonna be a lot of growth and that's why we're here as well. When you look at Ethereum, I think Ethereum really, this might be kind of a bold statement, and I'm not talking about now either. But personally, I think Ethereum is slowly dying. There has been less and less people building on Ethereum.
00:16:40.306 - 00:16:40.658, Speaker B: No doubt.
00:16:40.674 - 00:16:59.272, Speaker F: It is still, still the most widely accepted and built on chain, but the speed of it, the acceptance of it is just slowing down because there's too many different choices. You can build on Solana, you can build on move, language, ecosystem, you can build on BTC ecosystems.
00:16:59.336 - 00:16:59.752, Speaker E: Right?
00:16:59.856 - 00:18:25.270, Speaker F: I think Ethereum is slowly dying, but at the same time, bitcoin is kind of on the rise. Bitcoin has always been the most well known asset in the crypto space. There they it has the strongest consensus. People know it worth good amount of money. I doubt that ever bitcoin will go through a, you know, will lose that consensus and go, you know, go down in price and you know, one, one key reason that I think we are seeing a lot of price turbulence is because there are a lot of bigger investors, especially traffic investors are trying to come in and getting this asset before the drastic policy change, before anyone else start rushing like you know, and that's, you know, that's, that's what happened with equity before as well. You're seeing family office starting first because they have for risk tolerance, then followed by, you know, money capitals, money funds, hedge funds, eventually to pensions. But I think yesterday I already saw news like 1 of the UK pension has started accumulating bitcoins and doing a new fund.
00:18:25.270 - 00:19:06.660, Speaker F: I mean those are signals, right that there has been more and more acceptance among trifi institutional, so bitcoin. And in the past couple of days, literally if you look at the market, all the money accumulating into bitcoin, I think it is definitely a sign whether it's going to accelerate. I think it will highly depend on the policymakers, not just in the U.S. but across the world. But I just kind of want to remind that this is inevitable future that bitcoin will come back. I see mainstream asset. I see what not only people are holding, but people are building on top of.
00:19:06.660 - 00:19:29.492, Speaker F: And obviously like I said, I think ultimately there are different hypes about different bitcoin chains, different L2s, different side chains. But so far the only chain that has dapps built on top of and has real tvl, has been operating, has been doing a lot of staking is core.
00:19:29.556 - 00:19:29.972, Speaker E: Right.
00:19:30.076 - 00:19:45.268, Speaker F: So we ultimately are competent. I, I cannot predict the future. I would say I think if the election result come out to be bullish, it might accelerate. I cannot guarantee. But I do believe that we are best positioned with core.
00:19:45.444 - 00:20:55.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I think core has definitely been very much at the forefront of its great community. And as we know, crypto is all about community. It's all about, you know, a buy in from a group of people that believe in something that you know is bigger than themselves. I mean I know that that sounds a little bit cheesy, but that's just the way that it is. And especially in terms of where we are in this evolution, you know, not only crypto, but I Think in general, you know, you need that community and obviously Core's managed to do that. And like you said, you know, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, an ecosystem that has, you know, the TVL from a, from a locked Bitcoin perspective, obviously they have the novel idea, you know, not idea, but the technology that allows you to still retain custody and, you know, lock their Bitcoin as a commitment to the network. I think the most important question at this point is to, you know, just kind of like get a perspective, you know, we've had an eagle's eye view now of what's happening in the market, what Core's been doing, and then obviously, more importantly, where you guys sit in this whole thing.
00:20:55.566 - 00:21:20.660, Speaker B: Just give us kind of a broad perspective in terms of how you see corex participating in the core DAO ecosystem, obviously, from the most obvious, besides being a dex to the not so obvious. Share your thoughts around that. Love to hear, you know, what's what, what your perspective is on Core. Corex's role.
00:21:21.280 - 00:21:44.080, Speaker F: Yeah, of course. So for Corax, what we really wanted to do from the very beginning is to bring the trading experience to allow our DAX trading experience to be similar to what a Web2 or Tratfi professional trading spreads on equity will be.
00:21:44.120 - 00:21:44.512, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:44.616 - 00:22:21.848, Speaker F: I mean, like when you trade a stock right here in the U.S. maybe you'll use Thinkle Swim, right? Maybe you use IBKR. Those are pretty massively utilized platforms. And when you check out their platform with their trading station trading interface, the ui, right. It really is different. It really is different than Web three. I mean, I get that Web three, where younger crowds, people are more edgy, I guess.
00:22:21.848 - 00:22:36.290, Speaker F: Edgy and maybe cyberpunk, whatever will be a good word to describe. But we're seeing a lot of interface that are minimalistic or they're more of a cool variable.
00:22:36.370 - 00:22:36.658, Speaker E: Right.
00:22:36.714 - 00:23:33.558, Speaker F: It looks cool, visually appealing, but it doesn't actually offer the functionality for anyone trying to trade professionally, trying to trade smart and educated. I mean, I think part of the reason for that is crypto market is driven by a lot of fomo, right? And those are like kind of the words that crypto industry uses. FOMO Legion, right? Yes, that is true in the early stage of the market. I think the kind of the psychology of it or kind of the vibe of it, right? It's important you want to use a platform that feels cool. But end of the day, why are we in anything, right? Why are we in this industry? It's because this industry is full of Potentials, potentials for us to grow and for us to make money.
00:23:33.614 - 00:23:33.830, Speaker E: Right.
00:23:33.870 - 00:24:36.788, Speaker F: Ultimately that is a go. We're all here working because we want to be successful, we want to be able to achieve personal goals and I think Corex really wanted to deliver that and we are in the process of delivering it. We offered a lot of different tools for traders to make better decisions. Started by visualization, we offer real time charts, T indicators, you're able to kind of plot your own trend line and all that. We also allowed social channels where you can share your thoughts with verified token holders of token that you're interested in and kind of, you know, share your maybe techn drawings, maybe just your thought leaderships on different tokens. So that's something we also offered. We are looking to add some AI advisory which we believe will help traders identify different new opportunities they might overlook.
00:24:36.788 - 00:25:23.250, Speaker F: Right now it's still under development, the product itself actually is complete. It's just we haven't seen enough asset within the BTC environments to fully utilize this tool. So it's not on yet. But that's kind of where we're coming from, right and where we think we'll be going. We will never rule out the possibility of being Omnichain. I think the ultimate goal for us is to be the go to Dex for OBDC environments. I mean when you look at DAX in BTC landscape, PC file escape, right now we have about 25 million plus in TVL and we're going to.
00:25:23.250 - 00:26:07.082, Speaker F: We actually had more than 50 million just a month ago. One of our partner saw protocol, they are rebalancing their contribution. So that is going to come back. But when you add that back I would say that we are where the most QVL hosting or deep DAX that's available in BTC environments. That's in terms of obviously liquidity, in terms of user. We're currently responsible for about 85 to 90% of all trading volume happening on Core. And when you look at other chains they're buried in starting.
00:26:07.082 - 00:27:20.420, Speaker F: We believe we can deliver a similar thing for other ecosystems. I think the main reason we're able to capture that much TVL as well as trading volume is because we really do provide a lot of useful tools within our platform and people are kind of used to using us and you know, ultimately I think that goes that the same perks, the same advantage goes for any other bitcoin driven ecosystem. So I wouldn't rule out to be Omnichain but for now we want to serve Core and serve Core well. We believe Core is the best position BTC chain out there and it is truly a leader. To be honest, I have learned tremendously amount of knowledge and built more than ever connections through Core and I think obviously we want to be able to stay with the leaders, continue to fulfill our product when the time is right. Obviously we will be looking to further expand our reach and potentially gather more interest and have more TVOs to be brought onto Core as well.
00:27:20.960 - 00:28:03.570, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think you've obviously spoken about lot of stuff there but the thing that, that gets me thinking now is, you know, this whole idea obviously around, you know, AI and the role that AI has to play and I don't necessarily want to get into kind of the AI aspect and the role that it can play, but more importantly the role that it can play in the context of trading and, and the decks. And you did mention earlier on that there was this, this, this, this idea of, of getting AI to obviously advise users in the context of trading. Am I understanding you correctly? Is that what it is that you guys are currently building over and above your decks at the moment?
00:28:03.910 - 00:28:31.540, Speaker F: Yeah, I think AI is a very interesting topic. Me myself is very pro AI. You know, obviously a lot of people are a little bit scared of the process that we're making a little bit too fast. Yeah. But me personally, I think AI ultimately is a great tool to analyze data in such a quick. Right. Such a quick pace.
00:28:31.540 - 00:28:37.552, Speaker F: They're able to give unbiased. Most of the AI models not.
00:28:37.576 - 00:28:38.272, Speaker E: All right.
00:28:38.376 - 00:28:53.392, Speaker F: Most of the AI models able to give unbiased statistic driven answers or results or suggestions that a lot of times humans, when we read different articles, we have our own perspective.
00:28:53.536 - 00:28:53.936, Speaker E: Right.
00:28:54.008 - 00:29:27.434, Speaker F: The stats are there, how we interpret it, it may shift a little bit. So I think AI is tremendously helpful and I see AI helping traders essentially. We're a DEX platform, we serve traders, we see how it serves trader in a few different ways. Number one, obviously we want to have our traders succeed in making trades, in making money that comes to steel.
00:29:27.482 - 00:29:27.834, Speaker E: Right.
00:29:27.922 - 00:30:25.706, Speaker F: They need to first identify the proper opportunities number, then they have to be able to kind of capture it and make right decisions. So first of all we have kind of opportunity seeker, that's what we call it. This function has been in development. We would like to see more tokens listed with corex before we deploy it so that it is useful and it's more accurate. Essentially what it does is it looks at individual users, treating habits, talking about which sector you're trading most frequently. May that be social fi gamefi or infrastructure or DEFI protocols. And what kind of market cap do you trading? Is it a small cap? Something under 20 million? Something 20 to 50? Something above 100 million or even more?
00:30:25.778 - 00:30:26.202, Speaker E: Right.
00:30:26.306 - 00:31:03.464, Speaker F: And what kind of technical level do you trade based on what level you use? May that be rsi, may that be ema. Then we give recommendations to traders when they trade. For example, today I'm trading, I'm sitting here trading. Let's say I'm trading dodge, right? Obviously I've been trading a lot of meme tokens. Let's say there's a new meme token called Mudin that came out. I didn't see it, but it is also say. Let's, let's say it's not, but let's say it's also listed with Corex.
00:31:03.464 - 00:31:28.008, Speaker F: Right? Muden came out. I did not know it did. This is also a main project. It trades at a lower valuation currently that I normally trading. And based on the technical level, this is pretty much where I would potentially be buying. I didn't see it, but the AI will seek it out and actually deliver it to me. It will not tell me to trade it.
00:31:28.008 - 00:31:59.564, Speaker F: It will tell me, okay, there's another mint token, what time it was created and you know what price market cap, token price and technical level is at. Ask me if I will be interested, I probably will do a little bit more research and then I will be trading it. I'm not saying that it's one stop shop, but it does bring the opportunity in front of me in case I have missed it personally and allow me to make a good trade otherwise I will miss.
00:31:59.652 - 00:32:00.236, Speaker E: Right.
00:32:00.388 - 00:32:53.032, Speaker F: And of course we also have partnered with some industry winners leaders to provide better trade guidance. I'm mainly talking about the sentiment scores right now. When you look at crypto industry, I think if you're investing based on value, which is great, the way that you would invest in equities, it's great, it's great, don't lose it. But it is hard to make money in crypto right now. A lot of things don't really trade based on their potential value or their product really still most of the time cryptocurrencies, they're trading based on hype. That's why once again the formal concept comes in. It's based on hype, it's still early stage.
00:32:53.032 - 00:33:51.110, Speaker F: But what is hype? Hype ultimately is a sentiment, it is an emotion, formal is an emotion. And every project is on different social media platforms for us to read their social and not just look into their Social, but look into every little detail, post every little comment, right? Whether those comments are positive or negative. Be on top of their telegram group and read every message. And seeing how people are reacting, that's going to be tough, right? You might be able to track one project, but not all. It's going to be tough to track where the sentiment is, how people are feeling about it. You literally have to stay up day and night because crypto runs across the world and it runs 24 hours a day. What we do ultimately is working with some planners and they collect.
00:33:51.110 - 00:34:30.250, Speaker F: They have developed a program for the past five years. They actually won the Bitcoin magazine trading competition last year. First place, $1 million in reward, very successful team. What they do is they collect all the data from all the social media platform about the token and they analyze it through a large language model and they assign it with a score from 0 to 100 where 50 is kind of a neutral. More towards 100, the more positive it is and towards the 0, the more negative the sentiment is.
00:34:30.400 - 00:34:30.902, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:31.006 - 00:35:19.070, Speaker F: And in a way I think nobody has done is we can actually somewhat predict the token price moving forward. Kind of a price target, right? When you trade stocks, everyone's giving out, okay, price target for this quarter for this stock. That does not happen for crypto because no one is able to truly predict. And we're not going to predict the price for the quarter or for the year because that's arbitrary and that's not real. That's not going to be helpful for our traders. But we can tell them what the sentiment score right now is and what we are seeing for the next 24 hours. That's something we can actively monitor and, you know, assist our traders with such information to help them make better trades.
00:35:19.070 - 00:36:10.386, Speaker F: And lastly, I think AI helps with kind of accessibility, right? One thing that people struggle with, some of them may struggle with a VPN issue because they're in the region that, you know, that cannot use certain apps. Some of them might have Internet issues, some of them might just not be super familiar or in tune with different defi products and it might be hard for them to go through everything. So we're working with another team to develop an AI bot. Essentially the airboat is trained with small language model that is closed in the crypto industry. It does not give you random answers. It does not tell you, okay, what the weather is going to be tomorrow. It does not tell you that.
00:36:10.386 - 00:36:30.374, Speaker F: What it does is it specializes in learning about the crypto industry, about trading. It will be able to execute trades for you. And in a very smart way, it will ask you which, you know, network you would like to utilize, which kind of gas, fee or speed you like to pick, and all that.
00:36:30.462 - 00:36:30.902, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:31.006 - 00:36:40.790, Speaker F: Tell you about slippage, potential slippage, and all that. It will give you information about different tokens when you ask, but essentially it makes trading more accessible.
00:36:40.870 - 00:36:41.302, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:41.406 - 00:37:08.374, Speaker F: If today you're busy, you cannot up on the platform and make a trade. Connect your wallet on your phone, you think it's risky, but you don't have access to a computer. You want to make a trade, you just want to talk to Chatbot. You can do that too, right? You just type in. You can literally just record yourself, you know, speak to the AI, tell that to trade for you in any way you would like, and it will do the job. Right. It's about convenience as well.
00:37:08.374 - 00:37:21.540, Speaker F: So those are kind of the directions that we are tackling, ultimately, helping users make it easier for them to trade and help them make more money in each trade. Those are directions we're going after.
00:37:25.920 - 00:37:46.096, Speaker B: Awesome. I mean, I find it really interesting that you guys have taken this idea, especially in. In. In the context of a Dex. I don't think that I've seen anything like this. You know, I don't know if anyone is working on something like this, but I. I haven't heard about it.
00:37:46.096 - 00:38:11.842, Speaker B: So it's great to obviously get almost like a first. A first take on this idea. What do you think the challenges are around kind of like this, this model, this. This example that you guys have been building. Have you found challenges at the moment? Can you share kind of like the trials and tribulations that you guys have had to go through up until this point?
00:38:12.026 - 00:38:39.820, Speaker F: Yeah, of course. So there has been challenges almost every other day. I think it's same for everyone out there, right. What we're building on an infrastructure level, it's not too different than other decks. Right. And my excuse for that is because we want to make sure we're delivering something that's secure and safe. When users are putting their asset on our platform.
00:38:39.900 - 00:38:40.476, Speaker E: Right.
00:38:40.628 - 00:38:58.016, Speaker F: We want to use something that's already proven. And of course, we have audits from Certik and 40 KYC as well. But, yeah, you know, the infrastructure itself is safe, but we're doing a lot of development on the user friendliness side.
00:38:58.088 - 00:38:58.416, Speaker E: Right.
00:38:58.488 - 00:39:47.034, Speaker F: On making things better, the trading experience better for users. And when you try to innovate, obviously there are times that things don't go the way that you think will go. There are times where certain features that we had brought Unexpected obstacles. For example, one thing I guess I talked about is that chat channel which allow users to talk to each other. We verify whether you are a token holder of the token you would like to talk about. We will also display how many tokens you are holding and you will allow you to share technical indicators and all that and thoughts, all that. But one thing we notice is that there are spamming issues.
00:39:47.034 - 00:40:18.012, Speaker F: People spam messages and there are also phishing messages. Right. Even when you are a token holder, you could be sending things that are not really beneficial to other traders but rather harmful. So that's why we temporarily suspended the chat channels. Things like that. Right, things like that. I think ultimately we are not going to mess around with users capital, with users asset.
00:40:18.012 - 00:40:48.004, Speaker F: That's why the infrastructure itself is very solid. It's proven, it's audited and everything. But we intend to keep on building on additional features that are user performance enhancing, I guess. And those are like you said, like you said, not really existing in the landscape yet. We're kind of innovator in that way. And when you innovate, obviously there's going to be drawbacks. Sometimes things don't work as you expect.
00:40:48.004 - 00:41:26.318, Speaker F: Sometimes the product is not fully built out as you want it to be. We have been on mainnet since May, so we could potentially add those features to testnet and have people try out. If everything goes well, then we bring it to mainnet. But then we realized, right, we realized that not many people are still trying on testnet anymore to really get a realistic kind of a view on how each product is functioning. We have to bring it on. So I guess that's kind of the obstacle we face sometimes. And we really appreciate all the patience our users are showing, all the support they're showing.
00:41:26.318 - 00:42:03.350, Speaker F: And we'll continue to build that way, right? We'll continue to build that way. We'll never mess with your asset safety. But there might be some user experience hiccups once in a while as we're trying to roll out new features. But overall I would say that the building experience of course is not easy. I think if you're trying to create anything legit, unless you're just forking something and trying to slap a label on it, that's something that people used to make money in, that's much easier. But I don't think it works in this cycle anymore. But while you're trying to build something new, obviously there's always going to be difficulties.
00:42:03.350 - 00:42:25.272, Speaker F: But I think overall experience we have received is tremendously great. Positive. Well, I'VE gotten a lot of support from core, the ecosystem, a lot of support from our partners, from our investors and yeah, we're just waiting for the right time to kind of move on to the next stage.
00:42:25.416 - 00:42:26.104, Speaker E: Right.
00:42:26.272 - 00:42:29.060, Speaker F: So yeah, I think so far so good.
00:42:29.680 - 00:42:35.180, Speaker B: So what is the next thing for you guys? What's on the roadmap?
00:42:35.520 - 00:42:45.680, Speaker F: Couple of things, right? From product perspective, we would like to bring the chat channels back online with modifications to protect our traders.
00:42:45.760 - 00:42:46.336, Speaker E: Right.
00:42:46.488 - 00:43:25.100, Speaker F: And we would like to bring the AI functions online. I think the AI functions have to wait till we have more asset listed with our exchange. We are seeing more and more projects surfacing with a token. So I wouldn't say that it's going to be a long wait. Maybe sometime towards end of the year or maybe in Q1 we should be seeing them. It also obviously is driven by the market, the overall market sentiment which we're seeing more positive notes in recent days. I think after election it will be more clear on the direction.
00:43:25.100 - 00:44:19.886, Speaker F: Sorry, just smoking a cigarette. But on the operational level, one thing that users and followers and everyone really are kind of asking is when the TGE is going to happen. We obviously will benefit the most when TGE does happen as well because we actually are building this without a salary just so it is clear we are building this with essentially no salary and all we are doing is kind of using the builder incentive to fuel our further development, our marketing strategy and all that. And for all the teammates that is in corex we are all aiming for eventually a gain through our token allocation which does not unlock until a year and a half post tge.
00:44:20.078 - 00:44:20.478, Speaker E: Right.
00:44:20.534 - 00:45:42.520, Speaker F: So that's a bit of a wait time and we obviously wanted to push TGE as well like any other project founders and funding teams, same as our community members, right? They have been allocated airdrops points, they would like to exchange that to a token. Maybe they want to realize that as well. But we do want to go on TGE at a good moment. I feel like it's or to time the market. It truly is difficult but at the same time I want to have at least overall positive market to go into and that's kind of the feedback that we got from investors as well. All of our investors, including different runs, as long as they're a venture capitalist they have been suggesting for us to wait, right? To wait until after the election result come out after we know how the market react which is happening right now. So I wouldn't expect too long of a wait going forward but we intend to see how coland which is the leading lending protocol on core chain performs with their tge which I think will be happening in about two weeks.
00:45:42.520 - 00:46:37.768, Speaker F: Once we see their performance, we will adjust our strategy in terms of market makers in terms of which centralized exchange we'll be listing on. So far we have gotten approval from several top tier exchanges. We want to keep in mind of the listing expenses and save enough money for market making to ensure our token does perform well whilst it gets listed. And if we're seeing positive notes from COLAND and the market, we will proceed to a TGE with an adjusted strategy that ensures that all our investors and token holders will benefit from the action. We're not going to TGE just for the sake of tge, but we're going to TGE when we're certain that we can bring value to our community.
00:46:37.904 - 00:46:38.580, Speaker E: Right.
00:46:39.520 - 00:46:54.220, Speaker B: So how does, how do you, when you say provide value for your community, what does that actually mean? What is the advantage of holding your token? Going into the TGE and beyond?
00:46:55.360 - 00:47:20.638, Speaker F: Yeah. So when a token goes for TGE or goes for listing, ultimately what any project, why they are going for listing. Right. Listing is expensive, very expensive. When you're talking to centralized exchanges, any, you know, good ones, the price will range from 100,000 all the way up to 600,000, maybe a million dollars.
00:47:20.734 - 00:47:21.134, Speaker E: Right.
00:47:21.222 - 00:47:47.032, Speaker F: While you're listing with say like Binance or Byban or whatever. Right. It's quite expensive. If we're spending say half a million dollars on listing. Why, why, why not just give that money to our community? Right. Or investors. The reason for us to really go list is that we expect price appreciation and good liquidity.
00:47:47.176 - 00:47:47.576, Speaker E: Right.
00:47:47.648 - 00:48:09.990, Speaker F: That's why anyone will list. It's for the valuation and it's for the liquidity. So very straightforward. Right. I think token utility is clear. Our token has a full on utility. There's things like staking program that we're providing that's a VE33 social staking that we kind of develop ourselves.
00:48:09.990 - 00:48:31.574, Speaker F: There are other use such as trading fee, discount and feature subscription in the future, especially with the AI features we're pushing out. There's a lot of utility with the token itself. But I think ultimately people want to buy our tokens and people wants to sell our tokens.
00:48:31.622 - 00:48:32.118, Speaker E: Right.
00:48:32.254 - 00:48:44.970, Speaker F: People who are interested in our product and they did not get enough airdrop points to dim our tokens, they want to get more tokens. Currently they are unable to do so until we're listed.
00:48:45.310 - 00:48:47.828, Speaker C: And of course there are people who.
00:48:47.884 - 00:49:47.692, Speaker F: Are here supporting us for some time. They got points, they're able to exchange for some airdrops and maybe they would like to kind of, you know, diversify their risk portfolio and you know, potentially liquidate some tokens. We want to provide that value venue for them as well. I think it's only healthy that we bring in big buyers who are long term buyers or like they're positive, they're confident with our product, they like what we do. We want to allow them to get their hands on our tokens for price appreciation. And obviously for people who are more in tune with the short term goals, we want to be make sure that they are able to kind of liquidate on their decision on their position as well. Just, you know, whatever our community needs.
00:49:47.796 - 00:49:48.440, Speaker E: Right.
00:49:50.340 - 00:51:27.116, Speaker B: Correct. It's a good attitude to have and you are correct. I think people aren't honest enough around kind of like token liquidity around the token and more importantly, you know, caring about, you know, the price and also the value that the token holds beyond just the price as well, which clearly you guys are considering. I think from my side of things or from my perspective, I've always been an advocate for rather wait to launch a token, find your product market fit, create value around your protocol without the token, and if you are able to provide value within the token that transcends your product into the token, then by all means do it, you know, and I think protocols that wait and that find that product market fit land up doing well in the long term or better in the long term than protocols that just launch a token for the sake of launching a token. And I think we need more of, more of product market fit and then token as opposed to token and then hope and pray that they find a product market fits. Yeah, I think it's, it's an ongoing problem, you know, and people don't recognize it and you know, maybe they're just too fixated on the money or I don't know what it is, but I think, you know, if you want longevity in this space, you need to think beyond just a token and you need to think about your community and, and the value that you are creating for them. And clearly that's something that you guys are doing and if you do it properly, you know, you won't just be in business for the next year, you'll be in business for the next 10, 20 years.
00:51:27.116 - 00:52:04.604, Speaker B: And I think, I think that's important and especially if you're playing in the bitcoin space and you know, bitcoin's not going anywhere. It's going to be around for a very Long time. So anyways, Russ, we're pretty much at the top of the hour. I appreciate your time. I appreciate your insights. It's been really interesting to chat to you guys because I think, you know, we. We chat a lot about dexes and, you know, but not many dexes actually look beyond just, you know, kind of like swaps and liquidity provision and the rest of it.
00:52:04.604 - 00:52:32.296, Speaker B: Like, you guys are looking at it from a trading experience. You know, obviously discounting. Discounting, you know, trading fees through the token, you know, all that kind of stuff I think is really important in terms of growing the space. But more importantly, you know, being in the. In the Bitcoin D5 space, I mean, essentially, you guys are pioneers. You're pioneering, you know, the ability to. To bridge that divide between, you know, bitcoin and evm.
00:52:32.296 - 00:52:42.488, Speaker B: So well done on that. And yeah, it's been great to chat to you. Appreciate your time and we look forward to, you know, catching up with you at a later stage. I'm sure we will.
00:52:42.544 - 00:52:42.808, Speaker F: And.
00:52:42.864 - 00:52:53.880, Speaker B: And obviously closer maybe to a tge, whether it's next year, whatever time frame that is. It's been great to meet you and also just catch up with what you guys are doing.
00:52:54.180 - 00:53:15.640, Speaker F: Thank you. Thank you for inviting me to the show. I agree with everything you said. I think ultimately people need to understand that we're not here to make a quick gain. I think a lot of projects come out with a quick product. They push for TGE and they ultimately just liquidate their position as a team and gain from that. That's not what we're doing.
00:53:15.640 - 00:53:21.384, Speaker F: We're building for the long term. We believe there's tremendous opportunity within BTC environment.
00:53:21.472 - 00:53:24.120, Speaker C: We are best positioned right now and.
00:53:24.160 - 00:53:37.784, Speaker F: We want to kind of maintain that leadership, maintain that advantage, and, you know, continue to have a solid platform that's operating for years to come. So, yeah, we obviously are taking serious.
00:53:37.832 - 00:53:41.630, Speaker C: Measures and be very cautious with our.
00:53:42.250 - 00:53:49.474, Speaker F: Strategy and how we enact them. Appreciate the exposure, appreciate the help, support.
00:53:49.642 - 00:53:52.350, Speaker C: I love to come back in the future.
00:53:52.890 - 00:54:03.922, Speaker B: It's a pleasure and we definitely will invite you. And yeah, once again, all the best. And yeah, just go out there and make it happen. Sir, we wish you all the best. Take it easy.
00:54:04.066 - 00:54:04.658, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:54:04.714 - 00:54:05.420, Speaker C: Have a good one.
