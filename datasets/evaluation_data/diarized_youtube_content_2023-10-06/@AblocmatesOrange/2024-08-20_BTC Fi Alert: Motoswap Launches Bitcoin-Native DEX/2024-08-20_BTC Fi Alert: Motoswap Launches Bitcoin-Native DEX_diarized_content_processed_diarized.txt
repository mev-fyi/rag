00:00:00.200 - 00:01:09.390, Speaker A: We've sort of tackled some of the really basic gaps right now in terms of user experience with. With our application, Motoswap, which allows, again, the user to trustlessly, non custodially and permissionlessly create LP's, deploy tokens, create LP's open trading liquidity mine. There's a number of things that you can do with these tokens now that is programmable and most importantly, non custodial and permissionless. So the user experience is much, much, much, vastly improved as far as token trading with our application, Motoswap. But I think that as more and more applications come into the space and start developing, we'll start to see a bunch of different user experiences emerge on bitcoin layer one. Whether it is, you know, lending or staking or staking your bitcoin or stablecoin protocol, stablecoin issuance, bitcoin issued stable coins, I think are going to be a really, really, really hot narrative that, again, opnet really allows for super, super ease of access to deploy these types of applications. This is really where I think the user experience is going to shine.
00:01:16.050 - 00:01:44.050, Speaker B: Welcome back, everyone. We have an interesting one today. Kind of like bitcoin meets EvM. Evm meets bitcoin. Where's it all going? We've had ordinals, we've had all of this, kind of like the surge of interesting things happening on bitcoin. And we have two very interesting individuals, Chad and Danny. This morning, this evening, depending on where you guys are, I know that they're evening, I'm morning.
00:01:45.150 - 00:01:45.526, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:45.558 - 00:01:55.470, Speaker B: So I'm not going to do too much of an intro. Just trust me, this is going to be an interesting one. Danny, Chad, welcome, Danny, kick it off. Good to have you guys. Welcome.
00:01:55.930 - 00:02:23.002, Speaker C: Hello. Hello. Thank you very much for having us on. We are with two projects that kind of link together. One is called Opnet, which is a bitcoin layer one metaprotocol specifically made for smart contracts. So very, very simple way to understand that is it's, you know, the ordinal client was made for NFTs on bitcoin. And Opnet is basically like that, but made for smart contracts.
00:02:23.002 - 00:02:51.990, Speaker C: So there's no gas token or anything like that. It's just bitcoin. And everything exists on the l one itself. And then on top of opnet, we've built Motoswap, which is basically a uniswap fork, Uniswap v two fork on bitcoin for Dex trading and liquidity pools and liquidity mining, all that fun stuff. We want to see it happen on bitcoin l one directly. So we hope to kick off the slow fi bitcoin defi season with those two things.
00:02:52.450 - 00:03:34.430, Speaker A: Yeah. And a really high level overview of how it works is basically you deploy your smart contracts directly onto the bitcoin blockchain. You interact with those smart contracts through bitcoin transactions. You make your transactions using bitcoin wallets. So pretty much everything is completely native to bitcoin layer one. I know we've sort of seen a lot of projects and L2 solutions trying to bring functionality to bitcoin through side chains or things that actually really don't mesh with bitcoin layer one at all. A lot of these solutions actually don't even touch bitcoin layer one.
00:03:34.430 - 00:04:07.470, Speaker A: And we wanted to deploy something that really allowed for full creativity, full expressibility, full programmability on bitcoin layer one. Because again, in our opinion, my opinion, I think that app development on bitcoin layer one, stuff like Defi, pretty much anything you could really do on any other blockchain, I think that's going to be a really important development for bitcoin. I think it's going to be something that I think is going to power bitcoin. And honestly, I think that this type of narrative is really what's going to be driving, uh, the next bull run.
00:04:07.890 - 00:04:43.030, Speaker B: So, yeah, great intro. Um. Uh, you guys didn't hold back, just jump straight into it. Um, so there's obviously quite a bit there that we can chat about just to kick things off. And that's, you know, obviously this whole idea of bitcoin defi. And, um, I think a lot of people have been paying too much attention to kind of like the meme side of things. And you guys have obviously, and there's a lot of other guys that have been very busy with this whole idea of incorporating smart contracts, essentially, the idea of smart contracts as a functional basis onto, onto bitcoin.
00:04:43.030 - 00:05:12.528, Speaker B: I want to get into kind of like, what, what other ecosystems and protocols are doing in terms of, like, that relationship between bitcoin and EVM at a later stage. But I just want to unpack in terms of like, what you see. And Chad, you can kick it off, like, what do you see? Or how do you define bitcoin defi? I mean, and it's. Yeah, I mean, from the most obvious to maybe kind of like your, your kind of like, quirky side of it, maybe.
00:05:12.704 - 00:05:54.110, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. You know, I would honestly say bitcoin or DeFi right now is pretty undefined. I think a lot of people are really excited about that concept, but there hasn't really been an implementation of it, really anywhere. I know that people listening might be familiar with something like bitcoin ordinals, which is a NFT protocol, allows you to deploy nfts to the bitcoin blockchain. But there hasn't been anything by way of app development or anything by way of DeFi for bitcoin. So right now, it's kind of the wide open water. It's like a vast ocean that's sort of undiscovered.
00:05:54.110 - 00:07:04.474, Speaker A: And in this ocean, there's a lot of liquidity that has really yet to be tapped. But I think that one of the huge advantages of developing DeFi on bitcoin at this stage is that we can look to something like Ethereum, like a testnet, and look to a lot of the successful applications that have been built on Ethereum and other EVM based blockchains, and I guess sort of learn from them, copy the most successful protocols, make improvements where people kind of see as necessary. And I guess what I would sort of see as the, I guess the environment. And I know Danny, this is sort of Danny's coin term that has sort of now been circulating around the Twitter sphere, is slow fi. And that's because bitcoin, of course, is constrained to ten minute block times on average, which means that the network moves a lot slower. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be building on bitcoin or building applications that are based on bitcoin. It's just that the dynamic of how assets move and trade, I think, will shift.
00:07:04.474 - 00:08:30.770, Speaker A: And in a lot of ways, especially for DeFi, specifically DeFi, I think it can actually really significantly benefit the DeFi world and DeFi applications because of the slow nature of the blockchain, you are not going to experience some of the crazy fast crashes, these crazy liquidations that we saw last cycle with DeFi on Ethereum, which led to some of the downfall of the interest in DeFi, because a lot of people lost a lot of money in these big collapses that happen super, super fast. And it really asks the question for something like DeFi, which in a lot of ways mimics the financial world that lives off chain. Your tradfi world, do you need high throughput transactions? Is that something that is really a feature of the tradfi world? Like for example, when I'm trying to get a loan at a bank, it's not like I can instantly have access to a ton of capital just like that. It takes weeks, sometimes even longer for a bank to approve my loan. And this is somewhat of a safeguard, I think, in the tradfi world that allows for the system to be a little bit more sustainable. And obviously things are going to move faster than that in the Defi world. But a slower aspect, I think really can benefit in a lot of ways.
00:08:30.770 - 00:08:42.769, Speaker A: And I know this is sort of Danny's mantra, his bible that he follows. I kind of want to pass off to him a little bit to explain a little bit more about the slow fi thesis.
00:08:43.589 - 00:09:55.538, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, slow fi is really interesting because we haven't really seen a blockchain. Like everything has been been focused on speed for the past two years, ever since EIP 1559, where ETH kind of turned into a cheaper and faster experience than it was previous. We've kind of seen a drop off of Defi TVL, especially on Ethereum, but also on places like Solana and other like high TPS blockchains. The high TPS is really great for like meme coins and for retail to have a near instantaneous experience with trading, but past trading for things like staking protocols or rebasing or Olympus dow type protocol and liquidity things, those protocols tend to do better on a slower environment. Just based on the history of short history of defi that we have. So high tps blockchains tend to not really have much defi at all. Versus bitcoin, it pretty much only has jpegs and shitcoins that people are playing on right now, which is a pretty non optimal way to play with specifically those two types of things in a slow environment.
00:09:55.538 - 00:10:44.738, Speaker C: But if I could take my bitcoin tokens and stake them, or if I could add them to an LP and stake that LP, I could be earning rewards the same way that I do on other blockchains. But now, instead of every 1 second Solana, every 1 second, 100,000 people can claim their rewards or unstake a token and then sell immediately. That kind of causes these, for lack of better term, Ponzi, to fall apart very quickly. Versus on bitcoin, you only have 6000 people that can do one thing every ten minutes. That's just the way the blockchain is designed. So it sounds a little bit silly. But also the normal real world market also kind of follows this slow fi thesis where buying physical gold or real estate, or even just like sending a bank transfer, that stuff takes multiple days to clear and process through.
00:10:44.738 - 00:10:59.630, Speaker C: So a slow environment for finance, especially when it comes to like assets that you don't need to not shit coins, not very, you know, speculative, high volatility assets. A slower environment seems like a positive that we just haven't seen happen in crypto yet.
00:11:00.410 - 00:11:36.150, Speaker B: I mean, I think there's going to be quite a lot of disagreement with what it is that you're saying right now. I mean, obviously it's quite a controversial take around, you know, this whole thing, but I totally understand, like, you don't need. I get it. You don't need, like, you know, how high throughput on something that you're staking, etc. Etc. Let's just jump into kind of like the really important part of this whole thing. And that's obviously attracting that liquidity to essentially come and play in inverted commas.
00:11:36.150 - 00:12:01.768, Speaker B: I mean, that's actually what this is all about. You've got a trillion dollar asset. There's so much of that, you know, that. That collateral that's sitting there and it's not really doing anything. How do you actually attract that? I mean, obviously, there's kind of like a lot of. A lot of perspective that says that, you know, Defi is high risk. I'm not really prepared to subject myself to that high risk.
00:12:01.768 - 00:12:11.100, Speaker B: How do you see kind of like bitcoin defi overcoming, in my opinion, that being the biggest stumbling block at the moment? I don't know who wants to kick this one off.
00:12:11.840 - 00:13:04.340, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, for sure. So you can kind of look at the Defi interest on bitcoin based on two metrics. One is going to be the wrap bitcoin by bitgo solution, which is basically an ERC 20 token that's backed by the holdings of bitcoin, of bitgo and a couple other custodians. And that has about ten to $12 billion of bitcoin in it right now. So it's about 1% of the circulating supply of bitcoin is in wrapped bitcoin looking for yield on EVM, ERC 20 type chains, and then natively on bitcoin. The biggest metric is going to be lightning network, which is a pretty spectacular failure since it's been implemented about three years ago. There's only $300 to $400 million in TVL in the entire lightning network, which that pales in comparison just to the wrapped bitcoin on ERC 20.
00:13:04.340 - 00:14:11.010, Speaker C: So the opportunity for growth on TVL of L1 bitcoin is pretty insurmountable and kind of playing back into the slow fi portion. It's like DeFi environments thrive when there's an inflow of capital into the ecosystem. That's kind of why, like this past market cycle, we haven't seen a super huge resurgence in DeFi because the chart going from $80 billion in TvL to $180 billion in TvL. That's what, a 2.5 x, that's not enough for it to be crazy APy and things like that again. So in the bitcoin environment, even if it just goes to $1 billion in TvL, that's a pretty insane amount of growth compared to the near zero amount of dollars in TvL on l one right now. So I do think that staking and liquidity pools also lending those three things are going to be kind of the main factors of attraction for bitcoin itself to enter into like a metaprotocol layer of defi.
00:14:11.010 - 00:14:20.504, Speaker C: It's very attractive to bitcoin people to stay on bitcoin and have Defi as an example. It just hasn't happened yet.
00:14:20.622 - 00:15:12.532, Speaker A: Yeah, and I might mention as well that I think a couple of things. One, that the philosophical nature of bitcoiners cannot be underestimated. Bitcoiners fundamentally don't like to leave the bitcoin blockchain and they want to stay on bitcoin layer one. And they want to play games on bitcoin layer one if they're going to speculate at all. A lot of bitcoiners are very content just holding their bitcoin. And so the success of something like bitgo's wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum, the fact that they were even able to get about 1% over to Ethereum, which if you ask a lot of bitcoiners, they say that ethereum is a pre mined shit coin. Bitcoin L2, that they don't want to touch.
00:15:12.532 - 00:16:26.050, Speaker A: The fact that they're even able to get any of that liquidity over there at all shows that there is an amount of interest. And this is sort of my other point, is that if you were able to, well, I guess harkening back to the defi bull run on Ethereum, you had these crazy cranked up to the max Ponzi schemes because that was catering to the type of user that wanted to play with those. And not saying that those types of games won't be deployed to bitcoin using the text deck that we've put out. But I think that the games that will really have success and actually attract liquidity from these bitcoin holders are going to be more sustainable. Protocols that offer a small amount of Apy that's much more, much more sustainable. Because right now a bitcoiner gets no yield. And so if you're able to offer even 1%, even 3%, 5% to a bitcoiner without having to leave the bitcoin blockchain, if you can offer this all natively on chain, I mean that to me I think will be the real winners of this DeFi on bitcoin long term.
00:16:26.050 - 00:17:43.152, Speaker A: I think that they're all putting all the crazy DeFi cranked up Ponzi games will attract all sorts of users from all sorts of other blockchains as well that are, are hunting for 1000 x opportunities and stuff. But the real winners I think are going to be the protocols that are able to offer a safe, stable yield. And I think that the concept of DeFi has this, as you mentioned, has this bad name to it because it's seen as this high risk speculative thing. But that's just because of how it went last cycle. I think that there's a lot of people, everyone who's holding bitcoin right now, who's never moved it off of bitcoin get 0% yield. So offering something that's more sustainable and a lot safer, less lower risk, way lower speculation. If you're able to get even 5%, 10%, 20% of the people who hold bitcoin to stake their bitcoin or post it as collateral on a lending platform, all natively on chain, and you offer anywhere between one, anywhere, anything over zero to five or 10% yield on that bitcoin without them having to move their bitcoin off chain or utilize a sketchy platform like Celsius et cetera, or FTX, everything stays on bitcoin if you're able to do that.
00:17:43.152 - 00:18:00.430, Speaker A: I think we're going to see a lot of liquidity getting tapped into and I think the narrative and the reputation of DeFi will fundamentally shift as more sustainable long term protocols kind of emerge.
00:18:02.410 - 00:18:57.748, Speaker B: So are you familiar with kind of like the idea that you can time lock bitcoin and then commit it to. So, I mean, I don't know if you've seen what the guys at core have done because core core dive, got the side chain aspect going. I think they've managed to get, I think close to 5000 bitcoin. Kind of like time locked and, and obviously dedicated is the TVL to the ecosystem, which I think obviously gives credibility to the ideas that you guys have. You know, it's kind of like, well, what are the proven test cases that we have in the market right now? And that's kind of like, okay, well, we're in the formative stages of this journey. But there are, there are solute, well, not so much solutions, but there are ecosystems that are looking at capturing that TVL, but more importantly, giving that yield back to holders. And the biggest challenge as a bitcoin holder for me is like, well, I don't want to give up custody.
00:18:57.748 - 00:19:27.526, Speaker B: Like, screw you, I'm not going to freaking subject my bitcoin to a contract risk, which is obviously a real risk. I think we've got a long way to go in terms of mitigating that risk, you know, from a Defi pure D five perspective. So if you've got time lock in play and you guys are incorporating that into your strategy, I think the sky's the limit. So, I mean, that's just an idea. I don't know if you guys have thought about that. Yeah, just quickly, I mean, this is something that you guys are aware of. I saw you were nodding furiously.
00:19:27.638 - 00:20:37.408, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We actually, we actually met the cordao people in at a theorem Denver had some good chats with them. And yeah, you mentioned, like the success of their protocol is proves that people are interested in getting this yield on their bitcoin and the solution, which they have, which is a different solution than some, but it's a similar sort of approach that a lot of these solutions are coming up with, which basically says, okay, you time lock your bitcoin or you custody it on chain in some sort of multisig and on a completely separate blockchain, we issue you a version of that bitcoin where now you can actually get some yield on it and you can use it in a programmable manner. And I think that the adoption that's gained is small. I think it's actually going to be dwarfed. Just my prediction, it's going to be dwarfed by, because you're still leaving bitcoin, right? You're still using a completely different blockchain. And again, speaking just to the philosophical bitcoiner, no offense to Cordao, but their side chain to the fist, I don't believe this.
00:20:37.408 - 00:21:01.056, Speaker A: But the philosophical bitcoiner says, well, that's a shit. That's a shit coin chain, whatever, right? Now, if you can combine that concept with issuing a raptor version of bitcoin on bitcoin and never having to leave the bitcoin network and still allowing people to use applications and get that stable yield, now that really, I think is the winning play and that, that's the exact design that we have implemented with opt.
00:21:01.128 - 00:21:15.050, Speaker B: But Chad, that is, that is your, that is essentially your sales pitch. Right there. You know, like, if you were gonna. If you're going to stand in front of a crowd and sell what it is that you guys have built, that's exactly what it is, and it's a damn good sales.
00:21:15.990 - 00:21:56.756, Speaker A: Well, thank you. And, you know, really, again, like, we built this to just off of observations and conversations that we have. Like, the overall protocol design is not, you know, the. Maybe the design I would have come up with off the top of my head, it came from talking to people who look at ordinals and say, no, those are just JPEG scams. And talking to people who look at these other l two solutions and say, no, I don't want to touch that stuff. Even though I could get yield on my bitcoin doing that type of thing. And also, again, looking at people who are willing to play with core Dow or you obviously have other solutions, there's babylon, there's a number of these types of solutions that are coming out.
00:21:56.756 - 00:22:19.972, Speaker A: And all of those have sort of, uh, influenced our, our own protocol design. Uh, and we tried to design it with the bitcoiner in mind. We tried to be. This is sort of our tagline is the ideal bitcoin meta protocol, uh, because we want to be as aligned to bitcoin as we possibly can. Um, yeah, so, yeah, it definitely is. This definitely is the sales pitch. Um, but I.
00:22:19.972 - 00:22:38.000, Speaker A: I do. I do truly believe it in my heart of hearts that, you know, like, it's not going to be adopted by every bitcoiner. Not every bitcoiner is going to be wanting to put any, any amount of risk up with their bitcoin. No, not every bitcoiner is going to want to touch this type of stuff, but you don't have to leave bitcoin. And that's really the environment we're trying to create.
00:22:39.700 - 00:22:40.600, Speaker B: Danny.
00:22:41.500 - 00:23:21.536, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I will say that the idea of hashtag locked contracts for, like, backing an l two or a rap version of bitcoin is interesting. We discussed this quite a bit. The issues that we saw with that is that, let's say that I wrap one bitcoin and in that wrapping process, I lock that bitcoin for a year. Well, if I add that bitcoin to an lp and then you swap for it and you want to unwrap it, you're, you know, like, you can't. You can't do anything. So time locking for staking seems like a cool idea where as long as you're the recipient back of that bitcoin, then that makes sense.
00:23:21.536 - 00:23:48.448, Speaker C: Um, but unfortunately, that the htlcs on bitcoin are pretty non customizable. Like when you set it, uh, upon deploy, you can't change any of the, you can't change the length, you can't change like the owner of the HTLC or anything like this. Um, so they're a little bit limiting, but I think it's a cool, it's a cool idea. It definitely, uh, like you said, it's got like 5000 bitcoin, uh, that has entered into TVL. So there's a, wants for people to play with bitcoin for short.
00:23:48.624 - 00:24:38.578, Speaker B: You know, like for me, like when you, when you speak about those concerns, obviously they're real concerns. But then I start thinking, but surely there's another product that can be built like a product that essentially says, well, if you want to sell your bitcoin, we will sell it in escrow through a contractual process so that if you do need liquidity and you can't sell it, well, we'll give it to you, you sell it to us at a discount and then we'll give you the dollar value per sale or the bitcoin value, but then transfer of ownership of that bitcoin that is currently time locked then gets transferred to us. I'm just kind of just shooting from the hip here, you probably thinking of all the possibilities as to how that can happen. But I'm just saying, like that's, you know what I mean? That's just another avenue of what Defi could possibly land up doing.
00:24:38.634 - 00:25:55.292, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, I mean, just to dig into the, I guess the design that we chose for this because again, it's sort of a similar concept to how someone like cordow is doing it. But instead of using htlcs or anything like that, we have tapped into what's called tapscript, proof of authority vaults. And this is an undocumented piece of the taproot upgrade that allows for, effectively, the user to create an on chain vault that is owned by this proof of authority network of nodes of indexers. So let's just say from the user's perspective, I want to use a lending protocol on bitcoin that's powered by Opnetz. I would wrap my bitcoin when I do that. I essentially create this vault that is owned by the network of indexers. And you get a programmable version of bitcoin, this op 20 version of bitcoin, which we're calling wrap bitcoin on bitcoin because that's exactly what it is.
00:25:55.292 - 00:26:45.890, Speaker A: Now I can use that in a programmable fashion when I want to. And in fact, what this allows me to do is I can, in one transaction on bitcoin, I can make one bitcoin transaction and wrap my bitcoin and make my swap or use the lending protocol. I could take my position, I could do whatever I want. I can interact with the smart contract and wrap my bitcoin all in the same block. And then when I want to unwrap that bitcoin, or let's just say even better, I make a trade. And actually Danny ends up holding the wrap, the bitcoin that I wrapped, however that happens, let's just say I traded for some token and then Danny had that token and he sells his token and he ends up with some wrapped bitcoin. Well, what he is able to do is he's able to unwrap that bitcoin within two blocks.
00:26:45.890 - 00:27:25.446, Speaker A: Basically takes two blocks to unwrap that bitcoin. Because these proof authority vaults work where the indexers actually don't have to manually sign anything they are doing. They're basically pre programmed with validity checks to make sure that your unwrap request is valid. And when you make your unwrap request, as long as it's valid, it just takes two blocks for the bitcoin to be unwrapped and released to you. And that is, that is the design that we chose. Because it's as seamless, as trustless as it can be. Given obviously the limitations of bitcoin in its current format.
00:27:25.446 - 00:27:28.290, Speaker A: I know Danny probably wants to go into it a little bit more.
00:27:30.030 - 00:28:02.842, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically the way that people do wrapping of bitcoin for l two s right now is on what's called a federated system, or federated network of nodes. Like stacks uses this and liquid network uses this. The ogs in the space tend to use this style for their multi sigs. That's basically where there's like a single entry point in. So there's like a hard coded multisig where there's one address and everybody just sends this address and then they get issued a version of bitcoin on whatever chain exists. It's backed by that bitcoin there.
00:28:02.842 - 00:28:42.560, Speaker C: And it's great. Like it works, but it just is a manual process that takes 24 hours to bridge in and 24 hours to bridge out. So it's very, very slow moving for these federated systems. The way that we work is, yeah, it runs on proof of authority through Tapscript, which is like an actual feature of Tapscript that exists on chain. It's like a very basic version of a bitcoin smart contract within the scripting language itself. And so basically, when a user wants to wrap in, they create a multisig address on chain, actually through the transaction that's controlled by the different proof authority multisigners. And then within one block you're wrapped in.
00:28:42.560 - 00:28:46.852, Speaker C: Within two blocks, you're wrapped out. Like Chad said, it's a pretty seamless experience.
00:28:47.036 - 00:29:03.840, Speaker A: Right. And there's no single point of entry. So every time a user is wrapping bitcoin, it's creating a new. A new address, a new vault where that bitcoin is stored. So there's a bunch of different addresses that are all owned by this proof of authority network.
00:29:04.580 - 00:29:05.100, Speaker C: Yep.
00:29:05.180 - 00:29:33.380, Speaker B: Good. So I want to get into, you know, essentially what, you know, op net is doing, and, you know, then kind of like branching off into motorswap as essentially a Dex. So let's start at the beginning, like. Like, what is it actually all about in its essence? We've obviously spoken about very general topics, which obviously are attributed to what you guys have built. But let's get into kind of like the finer detail of open it.
00:29:33.920 - 00:30:46.036, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually pretty simple. So there's basically within bitcoin, because bitcoin itself is not made to do nfts or tokens or DeFi or any of these things. There's this kind of like. It's almost like a workaround that has been accepted by the market, which is this concept of off chain indexing. So basically, like, you know, when I, if I'm a user and I open up my metamask wallet and my metamask wallet tells me that I have 100 shiba inu tokens or whatever, I, as the user, I believe that metamask is telling me the truth. Even though I'm using fully centralized services and I'm not verifying any of this stuff myself, I believe that etherscan or metamask or all these different Internet services, the information that they're telling me is accurate to the chain, and I kind of trust it just because if I ever want to, I can spin up a node myself and double check the information and it should all check out, right? It's like, to the user, for developers, it's a bit different because they're kind of seeing the actual chain, but the users really exist on the side of Internet services when they're interacting with the blockchain. So this concept of off chain indexing, well, you're indexing on chain information, giving a result.
00:30:46.036 - 00:31:44.952, Speaker C: Off chain is kind of the core part of all these meta protocols on bitcoin. So essentially like ordinals and Opnet work on the exact same type of tech stack where you basically make a bitcoin transaction that has some extra arbitrary data inside of the transaction. When that transaction confirms it's stored on the blockchain forever, it's not like that's going anywhere. Everyone can point to that information forever. And then through the indexing, whatever metaprotocol you're using for ordinals, they attach that information to basically a unit of bitcoin called a satan, which is like a serial number on a dollar bill, basically. So you can say whoever holds this dollar bill with this serial number also is the owner of this piece of on chain information. And it's not really real, but the market again has kind of adopted this to where the users, they're just interacting with the same, they're interacting with websites and with wallets.
00:31:44.952 - 00:31:55.488, Speaker C: And as long as the website and the wallet are accurate to these indexing rules to the user, it doesn't really matter whether they actually own that bitcoin information or not. Experience is the same.
00:31:55.584 - 00:32:45.800, Speaker A: You can think of ordinals, I know we're not, we haven't got into opnet yet, but you could think of ordinals as like, danny, it loves to make this analogy like, you know how you can buy a star? You know, you could buy a star in the sky and name it or whatever similar to that, right? You're basically getting off chain. You're putting data onto the bitcoin blockchain. But since nobody can own data on the bitcoin blockchain, you're getting basically like an off chain receipt that says, hey, I own this piece of a bitcoin block. And that's how ordinals work. And ordinals are made for these, this sort of NFT concept that we sort of just described where you have this off chain ownership of on chain data. But the really, really, really interesting thing about ordinals is that you're putting data on chain and off chain, you're indexing that data. And again, they designed that just to do jpegs.
00:32:46.180 - 00:33:45.648, Speaker C: It's flipped from like ERC 721 is the ownership is on chain and the data exists on ipfs or off chain, right? So it's flipped where ordinals is like the data is on chain, but your ownership is decided by these off chain indexers. So the end result to the user is this feels exactly the same as ERC 721. So in the case of opnet, what we did is we took that concept and built upon of this indexing on chain information and then kind of assigning ownership or tracking of it off chain. And so when a user wants to like deploy a smart contract, they literally are making a bitcoin transaction with all of the bytecode and the salt and the hash. All these things are inside of their transaction, which is then recorded on the blockchain. And instead of a sat that we normally would point to like a JPEG or for something, for ordinals, we tie that contract information with a bitcoin address. So it's a little bit more familiar to like the Ethereum users where you have a contract address now.
00:33:45.648 - 00:34:35.998, Speaker C: So that address is tied to the on chain information through. Again, Tapscript literally generates a bitcoin address in the tab script itself and then assigns that address to the contract. So the user is always on bitcoin with opted either deploying a smart contract or they are interacting with the smart contract. Interacting with a smart contract is the same idea where you're basically targeting the address of the contract you want to interact with. And then your call data is the bytecode of that is deployed in your actual bitcoin transactions. So all of the data exists on chain. And then off chain are opnet indexers, which the more familiar term to EVM people is be like a node, right? So off chain, these indexing nodes are looking at the on chain data linking everything together and creating like a state of all of this stuff on bitcoin.
00:34:35.998 - 00:34:50.246, Speaker C: And then the user, when they connect their wallet or when they go on a website, it's calling the API of that indexer. And the indexer is giving, you know, here's what you have in your wallet, here's what the contract says for this. It's just kind of acting like a middleman, right?
00:34:50.278 - 00:35:01.860, Speaker A: And built in to the indexers is this. It's actually not an EVM, it's a bitcoin virtual machine. But effectively it's awesome.
00:35:02.160 - 00:35:03.960, Speaker C: It's webassembly, yeah, it's a web assembly.
00:35:04.000 - 00:35:26.450, Speaker A: Based virtual machine that basically, again, that is really what's executing all of the smart contract interactions. And, yeah, so it's like we are plugging a virtual machine into bitcoin and then allowing you to deploy your smart contracts through bitcoin transactions and interact with those smart contracts through bitcoin transactions.
00:35:27.750 - 00:35:53.810, Speaker B: So you guys obviously went into the weeds there, which is great, but this translates into something, it translates into a product, a functional protocol. In practical terms, what does op net offer the user right now? And you're very welcome to jump into motorswap, but, like, what is it offering right now? And then what are you guys looking to do? Kind of like in the short medium to long term.
00:35:54.390 - 00:36:22.426, Speaker C: So opt basically allows anyone who holds just bitcoin. That's all you need, bitcoin in your wallet. You can now deploy a smart contract or interact with a smart contract on bitcoin natively. So there's no extra gas token, there's no extra layers or extra blockchains. It's if you have any type of bitcoin address, you can do smart contracts on bitcoin now. And so what that might look like is something like Motoswap, which is a Dex that's literally a fork of uniswap v two. We'll have v three and v four as well.
00:36:22.426 - 00:36:33.150, Speaker C: But you can deploy an LP, you get LP tokens the same way that uniswap V two works. You can stake those LP tokens to liquidity line, other things like MasterChef, Sushiswap style.
00:36:34.290 - 00:36:42.672, Speaker A: We kind of combined some elements of sushiswap and uniswap for motoswap.
00:36:42.826 - 00:36:43.560, Speaker B: Cool.
00:36:44.820 - 00:37:29.006, Speaker C: Yeah, it's anything like whatever you can do with a smart contract, you can now do on bitcoin with only bitcoin in your wallet, which is. Which is, you know, a lot of people have not really moved over to bitcoin because it's not so defi friendly right now. But any other programmable option requires some kind of gas token right now or other blockchain to exist while, you know, having a bitcoin. So this is the first time where you don't need anything except for bitcoin in your wallet to now deploy or interact with smart contracts on bitcoin. And that's just that. That, to us, seems to be the reason why ordinals was so successful is because you don't. I mean, NFTs on bitcoin is not like a new concept.
00:37:29.006 - 00:37:44.692, Speaker C: People were doing that for almost ten years. It just. It just always required some other kind of token or incentive model. It was never just bitcoin. And then Casey Road armor, who created the oral client, he's just kind of like a, you know, funny guy programmer. He was like this. This seems like a fun project to work on.
00:37:44.692 - 00:38:00.800, Speaker C: I don't think this is going to be a $10 billion market. So he put the ordinal client out with no profit model, and that's, of course, what took off, because the user only needs to hold bitcoin to work on this protocol so often it's kind of the same thing, but now not just for nfTs, it's. It's for also smart contracts.
00:38:02.020 - 00:38:03.988, Speaker B: Chad, do you want to add to that?
00:38:04.124 - 00:39:19.464, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. You know, Danny and I, uh, with our design here, and just in general, subscribe to the Fat app thesis. And what that entails for us in terms of our protocol design, is that basically we're looking at bitcoin like computers before the Internet. And we could, and people have tried, theoretically, to say, well, I could build a programmable layer for this, or I could use some sort of side chain, and I can make my own token, and with that token, I could raise money, I can make a bunch of money, et cetera. There's an instant profit model for me to do this, but it's fundamentally limiting for whatever solution they're trying to bring, because the highest you can ever possibly go with any application built on your solution is the height of your whatever token you're releasing. Just like the Internet, for example, the Internet has no, there's no way to speculate on the Internet itself as a protocol. And because of that, all of the value accrues in the applications built on top of it, which makes the Internet simultaneously valueless and the most valuable thing in the entire world.
00:39:19.464 - 00:40:05.480, Speaker A: And there's an unlimited cap on the value that can accrue into the applications that are built using the Internet. For that reason. And when we were looking to create some sort of solution for smart contracts and app development on bitcoin, we're looking at bitcoin as the. That already is the highest cap in terms of any cryptocurrency that exists. So there isn't a need to have some sort of other value capturing piece to this. We need to have something that effectively acts like the Internet for bitcoin, that plugs directly into the bitcoin blockchain, allows you to do all this stuff on chain. And so all the apps that are built using it that are just really just built on bitcoin layer one, all the value can flow into those applications.
00:40:05.480 - 00:40:56.064, Speaker A: And that's sort of our rolling the dice a little bit in terms of where we make money or anything like that, because we don't make any money off net, we make money off of the application that we built that we see as like a key first pillar of Defi. And it kind of fills a big market need right now, especially in the bitcoin space, because there are these types of experimental type tokens in the bitcoin world right now. But there's no way to trade them in a liquid fashion. There is no Dex. There's nothing like that. They all trade in ways that are not user friendly and frankly, is somewhat ridiculous. So our gamble is that we'll build this protocol that allows for anyone to permissionlessly deploy any smart contract they want or build any application they want on bitcoin layer one.
00:40:56.064 - 00:41:36.720, Speaker A: And we compete by. We have to. Also, we have to build a great application. And if people use that application and it gets great adoption, then the platform that we've built is successful. And if we don't provide a great user experience, then someone can come along and the free market can decide. Someone can come along and put out a competitor product, and again, we lose market dominance. But no matter what, in my opinion, sort of the best outcome for all of that is if there's high competition in the market, that means that there's high demand for these applications, which means that inevitably we've succeeded in our underlying mission to bring app development, to bring something like DeFi to bitcoin layer one in the first place.
00:41:36.720 - 00:41:40.624, Speaker A: So that's our sort of underlying philosophy with all this stuff.
00:41:40.792 - 00:41:43.512, Speaker C: So you can. Oh, go ahead.
00:41:43.696 - 00:41:44.900, Speaker B: No, no, go ahead.
00:41:45.480 - 00:42:03.440, Speaker C: You can draw the comparison to like, arbitrum and optimism as well, where like, these are l two s that exists on Ethereum, but they still use the eth token as their gas token, and that's why they're the highest TVL. You know, like when you introduce a weird third thing, it's just kind of extracting capital from, from the people who want to, want to play.
00:42:03.940 - 00:42:42.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, when you were explaining, I was actually going to ask, like, so weird, how does this, you call yourselves a meta protocol, right? But then it almost seems like what you're offering is like another blockchain, but I know that it's not. But it does have that vibe, you know, it's kind of like, well, we've created this thing that essentially allows you to interact with bitcoin, and there's a whole interpretation around that, but you've just summed it up really cool. It's, it's like, it's merely an access point. We've built the gates. The gates are there. You can go through them and you can go into this, whatever you want to call it, this protocol. But it seems more than just a protocol.
00:42:42.350 - 00:42:46.278, Speaker B: It seems like, like something else, you know, I don't know whether.
00:42:46.334 - 00:43:43.914, Speaker A: Yeah, it really is a pure upgrade to bitcoin layer one. And, um, I know talking about it in the abstract can make it seem like it is this extra thing and maybe in our name as well. Op net maybe makes it seem like it's this new network, but it truly is just layer one bitcoin. And this is sort of the thing that I think will emerge as more and more people use it. Obviously, we just released the public testnet today and for moto swap the application and for Opnet and for allow people to start deploying smart contracts bitcoin, this is really going to be the thing that I think shifts people's perspective is the user experience, and the user experience will shift this from when we're talking about it in the abstract, it seems like, oh, there's this whole new thing, it's a different network, etcetera. Using bitcoin with Opnet, quite literally, you're just making bitcoin transactions. You stay on bitcoin layer one, everything you're doing is just on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:43:43.914 - 00:44:50.620, Speaker A: When you are making a transaction, when you're interacting with a smart contract, etcetera, every you're using a bitcoin wallet, everything is just layer one bitcoin. So talking about in the abstract, especially when we're talking about app development, especially when we're talking about smart contracts, execution, et cetera, it does make it feel like there's some extra layer, some other blockchain that's involved, but it really is all done on bitcoin layer one, which I think is going to be the real thing, that sets it apart from any other option, especially when it comes to hearkening back to what we were talking about earlier, especially when it comes to attracting liquidity from existing bitcoiners. You don't have to leave bitcoin at all. In fact, you don't really have to, you don't have to do anything extra. All you really have to do is use bitcoin, the bitcoin network. And that I think is sort of the killer versus everything, all these other L2 or side chain solutions, because you never have to leave the bitcoin blockchain. Then again, as far as app development goes, there's a lot, a lot of resources that we've built out for people who want to develop applications.
00:44:50.620 - 00:45:18.108, Speaker A: There's going to be, in my opinion, over the course of the next couple of months as we are live on the testnet, as we gear up for Mainnet, there's going to be a number of applications that start launching or building these bitcoin layer one apps. It's not just going to be motoswap. There's going to be, I mean, there's already a number of them in development we can maybe sort of get into, but there's going to be, ideally, there's endless, right? We want to see thousands and thousands of apps developed for, if you go.
00:45:18.124 - 00:45:53.120, Speaker C: On Defi llama, there's over a thousand tracked projects on Ethereum to this day, just in the Defi section. So it's like the, especially when you bring in the concept of forking, which to anyone who's an EVM person, it's like, well, that's got to be a given, right? On bitcoin right now, you can't fork anything. Like if somebody makes a cool thing, that's their cool thing to decide what can and can't happen with it. So, so we want to see this permissionless environment. Maybe this is a stupid example, but I like to say it's like putting a switch on under a Glock. We're going to turn the blockchain into a Glock chain. That's what I like to say.
00:45:54.460 - 00:46:27.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, a really good example of what Danny is talking about is this protocol that the guy who made ordinals made, which is called the runes protocol, which is an attempt at a fungible asset standard on bitcoin. And he programmed this runes protocol to only be able to do a few things. You can deploy a token, you can mint a token, you could transfer a token, but you literally can't do anything else. You can't use these tokens in applications, you can't use these tokens with contracts. There's no programmability.
00:46:27.540 - 00:46:45.168, Speaker C: You can't fork this client either. You can't fork the runes like standard and make your own things. Because if you, if you make a fork to the runes client, and then now there's like a version of runes here and a version of runes there, and the marketplaces don't know which one to choose. It's just so clunky still to this day.
00:46:45.304 - 00:47:22.678, Speaker A: And there's, there's no way to even build an application for any of these assets. So I'll give you an example. Like for a runes token, let's just say we wanted to build a, something that resembles a Dex for a runes asset, literally the way it would have to work. And this is just how the runes protocol was built. If I want to build an application for runes assets, I would have to basically, okay, I want to make a Dex. This is the basic layout for a runes Dex, which isn't a Dex at all, but you basically send your runes tokens to my wallet off chain. I manage the positions and then I send the.
00:47:22.678 - 00:47:45.144, Speaker A: When you make a swap or something, if you want to add to an LP, you send your tokens to my wallet and I create some sort of LP in an off chain order book. And when you want to make a swap, you send your tokens to my address and I interact with the lp that's available and I send you your tokens back, which obviously that sounds psychotic and ridiculous.
00:47:45.232 - 00:48:14.836, Speaker C: It's like ether delta. It's like these old pre uniswap style trading markets, wherever they weren't exactly a centralized exchange that you had to pay to get listed on. But it wasn't this permissionless environment where you can just, anybody can launch a token ad LP, and now it's listed on Uniswap. Everything on bitcoin is still pre uniswap days where you need specific support if you want to do these types of liquidity pools. It's just a total nightmare if you're trying to do defi.
00:48:14.988 - 00:48:32.350, Speaker A: Right, right. Which is why our introduction of the ability to do smart contracts and build applications is so important for the space. Yeah, yeah. It's so important for the space right now because there's such a gap in the market. It's insane.
00:48:32.770 - 00:48:56.866, Speaker B: Yeah. From a user experience, I mean, that's probably the single most important thing. At the end of the day in defi, we've gone through kind of like the walking through the mud and, you know, just making do with. From tomb. From tomb folks to, you know, we've been there, we've done that. It's kind of like, well, we've got to obviously transcend that in terms of how the space develops. And.
00:48:56.866 - 00:49:13.310, Speaker B: And I think bitcoin is like, a really good example of how we've always made do with the basics, and we're fine with it, but we've got to reach a point now where we've got to obviously, like, improve. What have you guys done from that perspective, in terms of the user experience?
00:49:14.550 - 00:49:28.702, Speaker C: This is the user experience, in my opinion. It really depends on, like, the wallet that they're using. Right. Like, metamask is just kind of the standard for EVM. I don't think it's necessarily the best wallet for EVM, but everybody just interrupt you.
00:49:28.766 - 00:49:48.162, Speaker B: If you're still using metamask to this day, then you are failing at everything. So I'm just putting it out there. There are way many options. I'm really like, rabbi. I think it's great products. You know, it's got all those security checks in place. Make the move.
00:49:48.162 - 00:50:04.546, Speaker B: If you haven't made the move, just trust me. It's a way better experience. To those that are listening, don't use metamask. It really is kind of like summing from ancient times. Yes, it works. I understand. And you scared, but we've got to move past that.
00:50:04.546 - 00:50:12.994, Speaker B: Anyways. I had to put that in. And no, we're not sponsored by rabbi. I wish we were. I've tried. They're not interested in speaking to us. I love their product.
00:50:12.994 - 00:50:15.230, Speaker B: I think it's way better than metamask.
00:50:15.650 - 00:50:50.618, Speaker C: That's really funny. Yeah, I mean, it's funny because like the bitcoin space doesn't even really have like a leading wallet yet. It has two, there's two main brands, there's X verse and there's Unisat. Most people use X verse for ordinals. Most people use Unisat for like the metaprotocol tokens, things like that. But they're still just very, very starkly different from metamask. So we forked, right now we have a fork of Unisat wallet that, I mean, you can use the non forked version and still interact with opted, of course, but on the forked version we have like swapping in the wallet is natively supported.
00:50:50.618 - 00:51:23.232, Speaker C: We have unwrapping and wrapping your bitcoin directly in the wallet, deploying tokens directly in the wallet. So I think the UX, from a wallet perspective should be a little bit more familiar to people who have used EVM style wallets before, even like Phantom things like that. But then on the side of the developer experience is really where I think that we shine. And really that's where like the bitcoin stuff is also lacking, because the developer experience has to be somewhat good in order for the user experience to continue to get more better, you know.
00:51:23.256 - 00:51:34.496, Speaker A: So Devex always drives ux, and especially in a space that's basically, there are no developers doing any of this type of stuff, especially in regards to app development.
00:51:34.688 - 00:52:21.254, Speaker C: Well, they're trying. No, there are, there's just no standardization for them to follow is like the issue. So there are app developers, there are people making these like centralized type dexs, and people trying to make staking platform, even people trying to use like htlcs with these metaprotocol assets to kind of get a basic form of staking everything is really cool, but there's just no standardization. So if you're a new dev coming into the space, it's like you have no idea. You kind of just have to pick a direction and go and hope that you chose the right direction because there is no set path for you. So we have created basically a standardized suite of developer tools. There are NPM packages right now that developers can use that mimic the ethers web3 J's library.
00:52:21.254 - 00:52:59.858, Speaker C: So it basically is like, if you're familiar, if you've built a DAP that metamask or Ravi or Phantom can connect to through wallet connect, you are able, you already are right now able to build a DaP on bitcoin with Opnet because we put the work into to make these standardized rules and just make it easy for you. So most of the time, if you're a defi dev and you want to start making an ordinal DAP or something like that, you have to learn all about how bitcoin works and how Utxos work and how opcodes work. It's a fucking nightmare. Now, you don't have to do that. You just, you can just come right over and import your NPM packages and get going.
00:52:59.994 - 00:53:16.650, Speaker B: So that's actually another sales pitch right there in terms of what it is that you guys have built. I mean, absolutely. It really is. It is quite compelling as well. So, yeah, well done, Danny. There seems to be a salesman in you as well. Did you want to add anything on that?
00:53:16.810 - 00:53:56.066, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, I mean, again, I, as Danny said, like having the, this ease of access, like. So for example, like a really easy thing. So let's just say, strictly speaking to the shit corner, right, you want to launch a token on bitcoin. This is how easy it is. You can literally use our wallet, drop your, the smart contract file for your token into our wallet and deploy it on bitcoin directly from the wallet, right? Boom, just like that. And, and now you, now you've deployed a smart contract directly onto the bitcoin layer, one network. And from another perspective, let's just say you want to do something like create a tax token.
00:53:56.066 - 00:55:12.270, Speaker A: Danny, literally just using chat GPT, didn't code a single line himself. Everything coded by chat GPT in 1 hour was able to create a tax token and deploy that to the bitcoin blockchain as well. We're talking about this extremely, extremely easy to use dev experience. Now, once you actually get really experienced developers and people who are familiar with building Dapps on every other programmable blockchain, once they see and use all of the things that we've created for them to be able to easily deploy DApps to bitcoin, that is really where I think the user experience is going to actually, really, really, really shine again. We've sort of tackled some of the really basic gaps right now in terms of user experience with our application, Motoswap, which allows, again, the user to trustlessly, non custodially and permissionlessly create LP's deploy tokens, create LP's open trading liquidity mine. There's a number of things that you can do with these tokens now that is programmable and most importantly, non custodial and permissionless. So the user experience is much, much, much, vastly improved as far as token trading with our application, Motoswap.
00:55:12.270 - 00:56:20.446, Speaker A: But I think that as more and more applications come into the space and start developing, we'll start to see a bunch of different user experiences emerge on bitcoin layer one. Whether it is lending or staking or staking your bitcoin or stablecoin protocols, stablecoin issuance, bitcoin issued stable coins, I think are going to be a really, really, really hot narrative that, again, opnet really allows for super, super ease of access to deploy these types of applications. This is really where I think the user experience is going to shine again. Ideally, you have bitcoin, and let's just say I want to leverage myself on chain. I can take a loan out against my bitcoin in an Aave style lending protocol, in a bitcoin issued stablecoin, and then I can go to a Dex like motorswap, buy more bitcoin, go back to the lending protocol and stake more of my bitcoin to get a little bit more. And again, I can leverage myself on chain in a way that's just so easy. Right.
00:56:20.446 - 00:56:26.198, Speaker A: It's extremely easy to do this. Obviously, that's not financial advice I wouldn't recommend.
00:56:26.254 - 00:56:29.196, Speaker B: Listen to the DJ and everyone listen to the djdeheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh.
00:56:29.378 - 00:56:53.736, Speaker A: But I mean, again, for the dj, right? But, but let's just say I'm the counterparty to that, right? And I want to get some yield and I don't want a high amount of risk, right. I could be the counterparty who is staking my bitcoin on andre and just saying, hey, the let the degens degen. And again, so that type of experience on bitcoin layer one is completely foreign and there's just, there's a lot of.
00:56:53.768 - 00:57:25.192, Speaker C: Like, liquidity providers in the EVM space who are not like Maxis about where their money is. These people are money Maxis. You know, they follow the yield, whether it's on this chain or it's on that chain. And then on bitcoin, there's an entire group of the largest whales that are in crypto are on bitcoin. And you also got to think about bitcoin miners. The only way that they pay for their mining rigs is by selling the bitcoin that they mine. And then hopefully, you know, the price of bitcoin pumps to where the little bit they have left is worth it.
00:57:25.192 - 00:58:14.184, Speaker C: But it's really not like the bitcoin miners are hoarding all this bitcoin. Most of them are selling 50% to 80% of every single bitcoin that they mine. So if the opportunity for, like, a new class of people who want to take loans out against bitcoin are given the opportunity, there's billions of dollars in liquidity providers floating around on EVM chains just because that's where the money is right now. That I'm sure would be more than happy to earn five. Five, 6% on their stable coins lending it out to these bitcoiners. And if I'm a bitcoiner, I'm pretty sure that bitcoin, if I'm confident enough to take a loan out against it, I think it's going to go up more than five or 6%. So again, it's kind of like the floodgates open for all of the money, to all the money that's just sitting on these EVM forks.
00:58:14.184 - 00:58:43.064, Speaker C: It's gaining not very much in APY, could be moved to. It's kind of the same thesis is like Barachain, right? Where Barachain is, this thesis of there's going to be a new EVM. It's going to have proof of liquidity. So all this liquidity that's floating around in the EVM space should just move to Barachain, and that'll have a Defi resurgence. The theory really is the same on bitcoin, except now you also have, like, institutional players and the biggest whales in the entire space who don't even have to leave their backyard to start playing these games.
00:58:43.192 - 00:59:19.380, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a no brainer. I mean, it's kind of like, follow the money and the rest will fall into place. We are reaching the top of the hour. I wanted to just get into, like, what you guys are doing, you know, from kind of like your short, medium, and long term goals and kind of maybe even hold you to account and revisit this conversation later on, but I was just really curious to see like, you know, where you guys are thinking and what your prosp, well, what are your potential prospects? But more importantly, like where do you want to take this thing and what does that roadmap look like?
00:59:19.720 - 01:00:06.648, Speaker C: Okay, real schizo talk here. Like, what could actually happen with this? Okay, so the first stage of Opnet will be this, this proof of authority based network where users can wrap their bitcoin in if they want to. That bitcoin is secured by the proof of authority nodes. We call them trusted indexers. And then the rest of the network doesn't have anything to do with these trusted indexers. It's just like an ordinal client relationship. Basically, once we get, there's not a certain threshold number, but once we get enough wrapped bitcoin into this system, where the, the trusted indexer network is maybe custodying a couple thousand bitcoin or something, this is where we can change the consensus model of opnet from proof of authority and upgrade it to proof of stake with bitcoin itself.
01:00:06.648 - 01:01:23.514, Speaker C: So the proof of stake method would basically be like, again, just arbitrary numbers here, but ETH is you stake 32 ETH and you can run an Ethereum validator. In our case, maybe it's you stake one bitcoin, and you can now run an Opnet validator as well. That's earning part of these fees, and it's securing the proof authority, wrapped bitcoin, etcetera. So we want to get it to a point where proof of stake is happening, because proof of stake allows for fees basically to be paid in wrapped bitcoin as well, which that wrapped bitcoin, the execution cost of a single transaction on Opnet will probably be higher than the sats per VB, like the normal network fee, because there's more data going into that execution, right? So there could reach a point where if every transaction in one block of a bitcoin block is an opnet transaction, the execution cost is higher than the actual network cost. And so more bitcoin is paid to the opnet proof of stake validators rather than the people mining bitcoin themselves, because there's just a higher amount of money floating around to this fee side of things. It's still just normal bitcoin, though. So once we have proof of stake on there, I mean, then shit can get really crazy.
01:01:23.514 - 01:01:49.230, Speaker C: You basically could build actual l two s on top of bitcoin through the op net proof of stake validators. The same way that arbitrum and optimism work as well. That's like, you know, very, very far down the line, assuming everything goes just as planned. But that's kind of the one, two, three that I personally see going as is proof of authority, proof of stake. And then we can kind of start getting into these l two s that are secured by the proof of stake validators.
01:01:50.570 - 01:01:56.720, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, you just put a delivery there that calls for at least another two shows. But let's just.
01:01:58.260 - 01:01:58.956, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:01:59.068 - 01:02:01.348, Speaker B: Thanks for that, dude. I really appreciate it.
01:02:01.364 - 01:02:02.052, Speaker C: Let's go.
01:02:02.196 - 01:02:13.668, Speaker B: Like, let's just fuck with Jedi on a. On a freaking Thursday morning. That's fine. Okay. I'll get you for that one. Wow. Okay.
01:02:13.668 - 01:02:21.388, Speaker B: Like. Like. Okay, we're gonna. We're gonna wrap it up over there. Thanks, guys. Really, really cool conversation. Yeah.
01:02:21.388 - 01:02:26.426, Speaker B: I could carry on for at least another hour, but we're gonna lose people on this one. Um, we.
01:02:26.458 - 01:02:30.470, Speaker A: I have to know. I have to know. What is your favorite Star wars movie?
01:02:31.530 - 01:02:33.394, Speaker B: I think the return of the Jedi.
01:02:33.562 - 01:02:36.510, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an excellent choice. Yeah.
01:02:37.570 - 01:02:48.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Kind of like Empire strikes back is also super cool. Like, you know, kind of like the crescendo of it all. But I think Return of the Jedi is kind of like, you know, when you're a kid.
01:02:49.490 - 01:02:53.510, Speaker A: But I've got the. I've got the. The Rebel alliance tattoo.
01:02:56.130 - 01:03:04.830, Speaker B: That's another show altogether. Like, do you get it? You either get it or you don't. You know, it's like, what's your favorite?
01:03:05.210 - 01:03:17.082, Speaker A: Oh, man. Yeah, I mean, it's gotta be the return of the Jedi, or. I mean, this is. Might be a controversial take, but I really enjoy episode three. I think that the. It's a beautiful crescendo to.
01:03:17.186 - 01:03:18.254, Speaker B: Yes, it is.
01:03:18.442 - 01:03:41.214, Speaker A: Two movies in the prequels. I think the two prequel movies that preceded episode one and two are. Can be seen by some. Is a little bit boring and a little bit political, but it's amazing crescendo. And I think it really fills in a lot of the gaps of the Darth Vader origin story. And again, the emotional moment and the fight between Anakin and Obi Wan is like. I mean, that is one of the most.
01:03:41.302 - 01:03:45.290, Speaker B: So clearly, you like the messy bits, which is fine. I mean, it was. Macy.
01:03:45.790 - 01:04:00.126, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. I mean, again, nothing beats the original trilogy. Again, if I was to only pick three, I would. Obviously. I would go original trilogy prequels. And I. Personally, I don't even count the.
01:04:00.126 - 01:04:01.450, Speaker A: The Disney ones.
01:04:03.390 - 01:04:04.130, Speaker C: Bad.
01:04:04.510 - 01:04:24.950, Speaker B: Yeah. They're not great. Guys, it's been awesome to chat. Good luck in the trenches, because clearly this is very much. Yeah, you guys are in the weeds and it's been super cool to chat to you and to anyone who's listening or watching. Go follow these, these lunatics. They are on the cutting edge.
01:04:24.950 - 01:04:32.866, Speaker B: Yeah. Brave new worlds. Well done, lads. It's great to chat to you and. Yeah, let's check in in a few months. Take it easy. Alright.
01:04:32.898 - 01:04:33.570, Speaker C: Thanks for listening.
01:04:33.610 - 01:04:38.210, Speaker A: If you enjoyed the show, please give us a like subscribe and turn the notification bell on for next time. See ya.
