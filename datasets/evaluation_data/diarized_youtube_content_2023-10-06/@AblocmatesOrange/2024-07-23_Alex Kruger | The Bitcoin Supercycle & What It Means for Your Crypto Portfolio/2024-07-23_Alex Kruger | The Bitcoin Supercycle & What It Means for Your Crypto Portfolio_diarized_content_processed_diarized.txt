00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.790, Speaker A: We are on a super cycle and.
00:00:01.830 - 00:00:03.534, Speaker B: There really are kind of two solutions.
00:00:03.662 - 00:00:06.982, Speaker A: Even if you dislike Trump very deeply.
00:00:07.046 - 00:00:10.262, Speaker B: And there's some amazing groups that are building a toppled core for restaking.
00:00:10.326 - 00:00:18.930, Speaker A: So when you say RWA and you're talking about real world assets and you're someone from the real world, you go like, where are these guys smoking?
00:00:25.880 - 00:00:55.150, Speaker C: A little bit of a change to what we normally do. Got three guests, well, two guests in three of us on the pod. Our special guest today, not that rich isn't special, but Alex Kruger, economist, portfolio manager with 25 years of experience in commodities. Very cool macro perspective on things. If you're not following him on twitter, get out there. He's been in crypto for close to 110 years. I mean, eleven years.
00:00:55.150 - 00:01:18.550, Speaker C: He's one of the ogs, apparently got a whole lot of money from Mount Gox today and he's considering permanent retirement, but he'll tell us about that in a minute. He also runs Asgard, an asset management and advisory firm. And yeah, he's, he's one of the cool guys in the scene. A lot of wisdom. Alex, welcome. It's good to have you. Thanks for taking the time.
00:01:19.300 - 00:01:21.480, Speaker A: Thank you. Jita. Thank you very much.
00:01:22.380 - 00:01:27.960, Speaker C: It's a pleasure. Rich, welcome. One of the founders of core. How are you doing, sir?
00:01:28.700 - 00:01:42.920, Speaker B: Slight correction. Initial contributor at core, but doing well. All things core have been pretty exciting since the last time we chatted. Happy to fill you in on all the updates and just general macro conversation around bitcoin.
00:01:43.540 - 00:02:35.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I wanted to just get a discussion going just primarily around, well, the huge interest and more importantly, this momentum around bitcoin defi, and obviously specifically looking at l two side chains. And I know rich, you guys from core identify as a side chain. And I just wanted to get into where the value proposition lies at the moment. Uh, obviously from the most obvious stuff to the not so obvious stuff. And, you know, where we potentially are going with this. So, I mean, I'll kick it off in terms of like, you know, where core is at the moment. Um, I don't know if you've got any perspectives before we go into the specifics of core, Alex, but like, thoughts around bitcoin defi and, you know, where we're going in terms of where bitcoin started and where we are right now.
00:02:35.920 - 00:03:14.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we could touch briefly on basically what's happening. Bigger picture with crypto and bitcoin. And when I say this, I'm aware that a lot of bitcoiners, a minority, but a very vocal minority, take an issue with calling bitcoin crypto, but bitcoin is original crypto asset. Right. I think it'd be helpful to set up the tone to basically where we are in the cycle. A lot of people are very concerned about it. Maybe not as much now, given the run.
00:03:14.210 - 00:03:59.362, Speaker A: It's Wednesday right now, given the run since the weekend events, but still. So I'm gonna make it very briefly not to launch into a monologue here, but the way I see it, we are on, we are on a super cycle. And this word used to be thrown around as a meme in crypto circles. And it was actually proven to be a meme, unfortunately, because bitcoin did dump 86% from top to bottom, 21 to 22. Right. But what supercycle basically means is that it's not that we don't have any more bears or we don't have any more corrections. If we just go up.
00:03:59.362 - 00:04:27.364, Speaker A: What it means are the corrections to Cam are shallow. So we're not looking at 6% corrections. We're looking at somewhere between 20 to worst case scenario, 50%, 60% corrections in the most extreme cases. And these don't last for an eternity. And the main driver behind these change is basically how. Basically Wall street is here and ETF's are now here. And this has changed dramatically.
00:04:27.364 - 00:04:56.646, Speaker A: Market structure. And we're basically going. We're going towards a place where people are. People need to have more bitcoin in their portfolios. Why they need to, because they gonna be shield this by asset managers and Rias and basically pretty much everybody in Wall street. That's where we're going. Ownership of bitcoin right now is very low on an aggregate basis across portfolios.
00:04:56.646 - 00:05:38.382, Speaker A: And the narrative, the marketing pitch from Wall street is this should be around 2%. We're very far from that. So I think we can be somewhat confident of this super cycle view for as long as we're far away from that 2%. And for as long as bitcoin's market cap is such a small fraction of golden. Because that's the second narrative is bitcoin is digital gold. And it's been pushed very hard now by even Larry Fink, the head of Blackrock, and a lot of other people. Yet.
00:05:38.382 - 00:05:57.910, Speaker A: However, these people are still a very large minority. They're a minority, not large. They're a significant minority. And there's a lot of people that still think that bitcoin is worth zero. So, yeah, pass it on. What do you think, rich?
00:05:59.530 - 00:06:31.094, Speaker B: So I think it's a really interesting take, and I agree with you. I think the super cycle is here. I think we've seen like probably systematic dampening of volatility now that we have the ETF's in place. And I think your idea of being under allocated to bitcoin is totally true. And I think that's a lot of the opportunity with some of these bitcoin scaling solutions as well, is people want more bitcoin exposure, because fundamentally, both bitcoin holders and Wall street just want more bitcoin. It's not like some of these other assets where you're trying to get higher cash basis returns. Whatever.
00:06:31.094 - 00:07:29.944, Speaker B: Bitcoin is this scarce digital asset that will only ever be 21 million. And that in and of itself, like, started as a meme, but now is this major macro narrative. And I think to go alongside that, people are kind of realizing that, hey, digital gold is amazing. But what if we could get more? What if we could separate bitcoin, the asset, from bitcoin the rails? And that's really the promise of some of these scaling solutions. And I think one of the ways that some people characterize these scaling solutions as essentially is like a higher beta bitcoin, right? Which is like, if bitcoin itself has more dampened volatility, you don't look to hire beta assets to get some of those bitcoin like returns going forward while still giving back to bitcoin in some sort of aligned or symbiotic way. And I think that's what most of these groups are actually trying to do, is they're trying to scale bitcoin, whether it's through building bitcoin defi ecosystem, or they're trying to build maybe bitcoin staking or some sort of yield or structured products on top of bitcoin. But I think we'll realize that this space now is 1.5
00:07:29.944 - 00:08:04.432, Speaker B: trillion, roughly. There's an easy path to gold, which is now ten plus trillion and beyond. And we really haven't seen what real macro institutional buy of crypto can look like. And it's really a bull case not just for bitcoin, but also for bitcoin defi. If you think about the Ethereum space, ten to 30% of Ethereum wound up in DeFi today. If you look at bitcoin, you're talking hundreds of billions of inflows, potentially at the current prices. If we're really in a super cycle, you're talking a trillion dollars plus of new demand coming into the crypto space.
00:08:04.432 - 00:08:07.820, Speaker B: And I think it's a super exciting time to be in the bitcoin space.
00:08:08.910 - 00:08:24.110, Speaker C: Yeah. And, I mean, what's interesting about this discussion is that it's. It's not even the show. It's not even the sales pitch. It's kind of like, well, this is what's going on, and this is what's transpiring. And we're not like, yeah, I mean, you guys aren't coming from this place. Well, I've got something to.
00:08:24.110 - 00:08:49.394, Speaker C: To prove here. It's like, this is what the opportunity is. It's a huge opportunity. And, you know, obviously, I think in the last two years, what's been really interesting is. Is just how, you know, I think from my perspective anyways, and I'd love to hear what you guys think is, like, I always viewed bitcoin as being very kind of like, one dimensional. It was like, what you see is what you get. And we understood it.
00:08:49.394 - 00:09:19.288, Speaker C: I mean, obviously, there's a whole lot of layers to that. Not entirely one dimensional, but we knew what we were in for. It was kind of like network, 21 million coins. But now, all of a sudden, things are changing, and we're understanding that it's nothing just about this one thing. This one thing can be three things or five things. Whether it's runes, ordinals, it doesn't matter how you feel about them emotionally. The reality is that the market determines kind of the appetite for it.
00:09:19.288 - 00:09:35.464, Speaker C: There's appetite for these things. And now we're sitting in with a situation where, you know. Cause being created and this understanding that we can collateralize bitcoin. And I'm just really curious to. To get into kind of like the. First of all, the collateralization of bitcoin from. From.
00:09:35.464 - 00:09:49.740, Speaker C: From this digital gold perspective that, Alex, you so eloquently put to something that. That it could become more of, or does it still remain digital gold that then gets transferred into other value?
00:09:51.600 - 00:10:42.934, Speaker A: I think that's a very important point. Is. Is similarly, for example, is. I mean, we're here in the business of making money, right? Not just getting excited about crypto assets just because they offer freedom. My analogy here is, even if you dislike Trump very deeply, one should be cognizant of how important he is for crypto as a whole. And even if he ends up not being so, and he ends up actually selling us a false narrative for just boats, we can worry about that way later. In the meantime, what matters is what the market cares about and the perception of the market.
00:10:42.934 - 00:12:30.810, Speaker A: What does the market want? We are not the market. Market is like millions and millions of people, right? Same thing with bitcoin defi, I think is very important is even if one dislikes using bitcoin and building on top of bitcoin because you want it to be something simple and minimize attack surface and all of that. The point is there is very large demand for bitcoin five BTC five bitcoin deFi because as rich was saying, it offers higher beta exposure. Like people want to make money, right? And it is not as easy to do so with bitcoin unless you're already rich. Not rich, but rich, you know, and so betting on higher beta assets, even though it is much more complicated and much higher risk, it brings a lot of, that's where a lot of value is. And furthermore, these innovations on building on bitcoin, from basically core to ordinals, runes, BRC twenties and all the l two s and sidechains, there is demand for it. And they help the bitcoin ecosystem by basically giving up as core does, by directly helping miners, bitcoin miners by giving them an additional revenue stream or by indirectly helping them by increasing transaction fees, by increasing basically traffic in bitcoin, which at some point in time is going to be very important once basically.
00:12:30.810 - 00:13:04.620, Speaker A: This is getting very long at this monologue. I have a tendency of talking for a long time, but the point is that the halving keeps on going every four years, right? So eventually having rewards won't be that large and it may not happen, but it's highly likely that bitcoin would significantly benefit from consistently hard transaction fees to incentivize, to keep bitcoin miners incentivized to continue providing hash rate, which makes basically bitcoin more secure.
00:13:06.290 - 00:13:57.550, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean that's a great response and by no means is it a long monologue. Please carry on. Yeah, I think the, the really important part here is, is exactly that timeline, the timeline is finite for all 21 million of those bitcoin to be mined. And from that point onwards, the network still needs to be secured. And the only way, well, I don't know if this is the only way, but from my understanding of it, like, there aren't many options for miners and this is definitely one of the big aspects, is creating l two side chains that obviously bring the miners into secure network. Explain that dynamic, rich. How does that actually work in like, you know, practical terms? So do the miners get brought in as a partnership on the network? What is that dynamic? What does that dynamic look like?
00:13:58.270 - 00:14:24.358, Speaker B: Yeah. So any miner mining pool is free, at least in the core ecosystem, to join or leave at any time. And the additional security and decentralization they bring to the core network. They receive core block rewards for doing so. So it really serves as a second block reward for bitcoin, which, as Alex brought up, it's probably not one happening from now. People are worried about it's the next happening. It's about eight years from now where things might get into a dicey spot.
00:14:24.358 - 00:14:58.586, Speaker B: We'll see. The historic idea has been the bitcoin price will rise enough to offset it. Right? Historically that's been true, but having chatted with many of the largest bitcoin miners and mining pools fairly often, that seems to be the time where people are coalescing around as like, hey, maybe we have issues here. And there really are kind of two solutions as of. Well, there's a few different solutions. One is, and this is like Brian Salkis has brought up a few times, one is you change it from 21 million coins, which again, we have a lot of friction. You move bitcoin to positive, which you'd also get quite a bit of friction.
00:14:58.586 - 00:15:56.802, Speaker B: The bitcoin network gets enough transaction fees to sustain itself, but that in itself has a lot of ifs. You really haven't seen any period of sustainable transaction fees besides some rooms, ordinals, time periods that really overwhelm the network, but in a positive way, from a miner's perspective, or you have some exogenous funding mechanism in the bitcoin miners like core, where it helps provide this digital economic security. And that's why the 81 year tail mission of core is so long. It's to ensure that that smoothness is there over the long, long term. And also why bitcoin staking is in place is to help kind of add to those dynamics, to increase the security and economic participation on both sides of the bitcoin and the core ecosystem. I mean, there's one other possibility, but I think that's a little more unlikely. But it's a hot take for a pod, is actually that with the advent of the ETF's, you're actually seeing these capital bases that could be in the trillions one cycle from now, whatever.
00:15:56.802 - 00:16:33.068, Speaker B: And maybe some of these ETF issuers will actually wind up becoming some of the largest bitcoin miners. And if they wind up becoming some of the largest bitcoin miners, maybe at that point it's not as much of a perfectly competitive market. Maybe they would run that as a loss to protect this very large money that is essentially, quote unquote, trapped in decentralized provider. That's a more extreme take. I don't have a lot of faith in that one, but I've heard that one talked about, at least recently. But I think it's really about solving this problem. And this is why the idea of bitcoin l two s or side chains, being symbiotic with bitcoin is so important.
00:16:33.068 - 00:17:07.148, Speaker B: If you're just taking away or being parasitic from bitcoin, you're actually not helping the bitcoin holders, the underlying network. And just to round out the answer, I think Alex had a great point of talking about this demand. And it's also important to think about bitcoin holders as this heterogeneous group. For some of the people, maybe the loudest voices on Twitter, they're fine just sitting on digital gold. They can do that. No one's forcing them to participate in bitcoin staking or bitcoin defi. But there is so much demand and there's already 300 million plus bitcoin staked on cores, hundreds of millions of TBL throughout all these different bitcoin ecosystems.
00:17:07.148 - 00:17:16.630, Speaker B: You're going to see more and more of this capital flow as people start to walk that complexity ladder. And I think it's the biggest story of this cycle and potentially the next.
00:17:17.810 - 00:17:45.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree. I think that momentum will carry on. And yeah, I think it's a conversation that we've had before is that there's this incredible amount of value that's lying in people's wallets and kind of like not really being utilized to its extent. And I. That needs to be tapped into. I mean, for obvious reasons, you know. Alex, do you think that people will.
00:17:45.700 - 00:18:04.124, Speaker C: Will kind of like be accepting of kind of like bitcoin as more than just a savings account, as something that they can. They can use to create more wealth as opposed to be a little bit stagnant. It's just.
00:18:04.232 - 00:19:15.036, Speaker A: Just, it goes after basically basic human nature. We want to do as best as we can and extract as much value as we can from our assets. Right. But one thing I wanted to comment there on what you were saying right before, which I think is very interesting, important as well, also is not very well known with core bitcoin holders can get yield on their bitcoin by doing something called time locking and basically giving them yield on their bitcoin without giving up custody of their bitcoin. And yes, you can get yield on bitcoin in many different other ways. Let's say, for example, you can wrap it up and you can send it wrapped bitcoin to ETH, for example, to participate in Ethereum's defi, and that works, and that is great. But however, there, for example, you have an issue, which is you actually, you gave up your bitcoin.
00:19:15.036 - 00:19:38.890, Speaker A: You gave custody of your bitcoin to a custodian who holds the bitcoin for you and gave you a token to represent that bitcoin. And. And that's what we call credit risk. And everything is fine. I'm not expecting them to blow up at all, but you never know down the line it can happen. Shit happens. Hey, we had coronavirus.
00:19:38.890 - 00:20:31.570, Speaker A: Weird things do happen. That's one case. Another case is you could be doing what, for example, stacks does to validate their chain. If you're a stocks miner or somebody investing in stocks, miners, you can go and you get yield on your bitcoin, but you have to give up, they give up custody of the bitcoin. They have to send that bitcoin to a specific address or set of addresses to then on that receive stocks rewards. So, yeah, you also get, it's another way of getting yield, but once again, you're giving up your bitcoin, and we can go on through the whole list. And core is just the only one offering yield on bitcoin without giving up custody, which is very important.
00:20:33.230 - 00:21:09.820, Speaker C: So, I mean, in terms. I mean, you're 100% right. I mean, that's the single biggest barrier to entry, especially for kind of like, you're more maxi orientated community, irrespective of whether they're a minority voice. I think it's a valid concern from my perspective, having to give up my bitcoin. For someone who's had bitcoin in a ledger for an extended period of time, now I have an opportunity to earn yield on it. If I was asked to give it up, my answer would probably be no. And it's great to see that, obviously the innovation has come to the fore.
00:21:09.820 - 00:21:22.970, Speaker C: I mean, we've written about this in terms of how core goes about it, but tell us anyways. I mean, how did, have you guys managed to actually do the time lock? Is it a mechanism? I mean, how does it work, rich?
00:21:23.990 - 00:22:15.408, Speaker B: So I think it's important to go back to first principles with why the core product works the way that it does. And I got into bitcoin in 2013. I've been very fortunate to avoid blockfi, Celsius, Genesis, and many of these other centralized solutions, because there was that problem that Alex mentioned, which was you would get some sort of depository token, or you would get a number and some sort of centralized database, and there's only 21 million bitcoin. If it doesn't come back to you, there's no way to go get that back. And that was always pretty daunting to me. So the idea was, hey, how is a product going to come to market that can meet both the staunchest security and trust requirements, while also providing an attractive yield for bitcoin holders? And that was the problem set for the team. And there was a bunch of different stops and starts, different ideas and that sort of thing.
00:22:15.408 - 00:22:46.198, Speaker B: The idea was, hey, wait a second, we just use bitcoin native features and we can encumber those funds using bitcoin time walks. We can still factor that in to Coruscantoshi plus consensus. And it was really this unlock. And as someone who has conversations with bitcoin stakers or potential bitcoin stakers, quite frequently, the first answer that everyone always gives is, I'm never giving you control of my bitcoin. Without a doubt, that's always what everyone says. And then I try to explain, hey, just so you never have to, like, the Utxo never leaves your wallet. And then it like, perks up.
00:22:46.198 - 00:23:33.172, Speaker B: It's like, all right, well, what's my credit risk? Who am I? Like, who am I lending this to? And I'm like, no, you're not doing that either. And you like, kind of go through 20 different questions and then at the end of the day, like, people will dip their toe in and then for time, you know, as we've seen, have like, kind of added on and added on, and now there's an over $300 in bitcoin staked. And we think that's the pattern where essentially what's happened as part of this bitcoin staking initiative is there's now like a risk free rate, quote unquote, for bitcoin that's out there. So if you're like a galaxy or you're one of these desks, that's like quoting bitcoin yields. Now, in theory, you should have to look at cores risk free staking rate, and you should have to go beat that. And it's like this new primitive that bitcoin holders have never had before. There's never been this transparency as part of this process.
00:23:33.172 - 00:24:01.078, Speaker B: It's always been opaque. And this is what's missing from some bitcoin structured products. Like, there's this whole new wave of what's going to come in bitcoin finance. And this was really kind of the missing primitive was this staking yield. And there's some amazing groups that are building on top of core for restaking. There's pell network, there's several others that are all doing at the same time. And I think we'll see so many more that will all go live because people are realizing that, okay, here's your risk free rate.
00:24:01.078 - 00:24:27.140, Speaker B: If I'm willing to go take risk, maybe I can take an LST that's powered by core yield, wrap it into something else, and you'll start to see more and more of this complexity. But the key now is that people can choose where they want to go in that process. They no longer have to default to risk. And that was a huge unlock, and I think the world is just starting to wake up to this. There's now some yield bearing that are actually powered by coors yield, and there's so much more to come.
00:24:29.080 - 00:25:12.670, Speaker C: Awesome. Alex, just kind of like a. More like eagles are perspective in terms of something you mentioned at the start of our pod, and that is kind of the involvement of, you know, the big boys are in the room now and, you know, they participating through this ETF, but obviously it's not going to stop there. What do you think the prospects are for exactly this kind of product and products that, you know, obviously cause developing and, you know, yield bearing, even kind of like, does bitcoin have a place in kind of like the RWA landscape as well? I mean, how do you see this playing out within this, you know, the super cycle perspective that you presented?
00:25:13.650 - 00:26:14.436, Speaker A: Well, the RWA, how to put it, narrative or move within crypto, basically. It's mainly infra, right? It's mainly people developing infrastructure products for allowing entities or individuals to get yield on stable coins, for example, or allowing them access. Giving them access to what we unfortunately call real world assets. I say, unfortunately, I'm going on a tangent here, but if you think about it, sorry for this, but this actually gets me. RWA weighted assets, it's a banking term, means something entirely different. So when you say RWA and you're talking about real world assets and you're someone from the real world, you go like, what are these guys smoking? But we like it. So back to RWA.
00:26:14.468 - 00:26:17.720, Speaker C: What, the smoke or the acronym?
00:26:18.460 - 00:26:39.710, Speaker A: All of it. Yeah, we like all of it all at once. Yeah, it's so. So. Yeah. I don't yet. It's too early to think to see bitcoin and BTC five, for me, as part of RWA narrative at this moment, they're entirely different things.
00:26:39.710 - 00:27:31.900, Speaker A: And if one guy wants to get exposure to RWA, best to look at some very specific names there. As an asset allocator is very bad when you have a view on something and you allocate towards that view, expecting that if x happens, y is going to be the consequence, and it doesn't, and it's not the case. But. Sorry, I want to go back and stress once again. I've had discussions about core with a lot of people, and there's a lot of people who've been in bitcoin for literally ever, who are not even aware that time locking is something that is possible. And it's something that basically has been possible. It's a function in bitcoin that it has existence since 2015.
00:27:31.900 - 00:28:02.554, Speaker A: And yet, I would even say most people who've been in crypto or in bitcoin since 2015 do not even know about this. And once again, what it does is leveraging this. You get risk free is truly the only risk free thing out there in crypto, aside of the fact that you're time blocking. So therefore you do have, like, if you wanna. If you wanna sell, well, you can't. So that's the risk, right? Liquidity. Let's call it liquidity risk.
00:28:02.554 - 00:28:06.030, Speaker A: We have credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk.
00:28:07.850 - 00:28:33.068, Speaker C: You weren't. I mean, theoretically, you weren't gonna sell it anyways. That's why you would have embarked on this agreement in the first place. I mean, that's the assumption, obviously, like you said earlier, shit goes down, you know, Covid happens, you need to pay off your loan, you won't be able to. That's the risk. Like you say, liquidity risk is pretty much the only thing. Custody, however, or giving up your custody isn't, which I think is.
00:28:33.068 - 00:28:49.402, Speaker C: Is huge. I mean, from that perspective, it's a monster. You know, that. That is the elephant in the room. And I think a lot of people are on this assumption that, well, I'm not giving my bitcoin away. Well, guess what, buddy, you don't have to. So you can get yield.
00:28:49.402 - 00:29:07.458, Speaker C: You can unlock the real value. I mean, I had. I had a hardcore bitcoin maxi on. On. On my pod a few weeks ago, and he just didn't want to hear about. He didn't want to hear about Brad Mills. He didn't want to hear about bitcoin as a yield bearing asset.
00:29:07.458 - 00:29:09.826, Speaker C: He just wouldn't believe that it was possible.
00:29:10.018 - 00:29:39.462, Speaker A: I mean, sorry to interrupt, but it's. It's. That's. That's very real. Like a lot of people I know if it's a lot, but it's. There are people out there that if you're talking about, if you mention yield on bitcoin, they will call you a scammer and they will block you or they will start, basically, something gets crossed. Wires get crossed in the brain, and they become obsessed with you because you dared say that you can get yield on bitcoin and therefore you're a scammer.
00:29:39.462 - 00:29:44.490, Speaker A: It's very interesting how, how the brain works, you know?
00:29:44.830 - 00:29:49.134, Speaker C: Yeah. So just, just go ahead.
00:29:49.262 - 00:30:25.764, Speaker B: One thing on that. So I think that viewpoint was actually super common up until, like, early 2023. Like, I think in, like, I give a lot of credit to Casey Rodimere, to Domo, like, these early, like, kind of pioneers of doing more stuff on top of bitcoin. That helped, like, you know, kind of open the Overton window, if you will, like, doing more things with bitcoin. And I think you've seen a bunch of people who are historically like laser eyed maxis that have now started to be more open. There's always going to be vocal minorities, like, don't get me wrong. And I think that's also important is, like, there's some groups that you just can't reach, and that's okay.
00:30:25.764 - 00:31:09.028, Speaker B: They're going to have to get there on their own time. Bitcoin is such a large asset today that you don't need to unlock everyone to be successful. I tell this to folks all the time. People will say, hey, rich, why do you want to work in bitcoin? What's exciting about bitcoin to you? And I go, how many markets have a trillion dollar tam today and a path towards ten x ing that tam in the next five years? I can think of one. I can't really think of many others. And that's such a unique spot. And I think that sort of a gravitational pull is what will slowly bring some of these people on, because ultimately, a lot of their friends or people that might have a little bit more openness to some of these things will wind up acquiring more bitcoin.
00:31:09.028 - 00:31:40.580, Speaker B: And that's kind of ultimately what they're all after at the end of the day. So overall, I think we'll see more and more of that shift. It's okay for that to be a slow process. Most of what core and some of these other scaling solutions are doing are primarily education. It's just exposing people to some of these opportunities, and it's not everyone goes from, hey, I'll never do anything like bitcoin towards like, like, I'm borrowing against my, my ordinals, and then, like, you know, lever and five x poke trade, those are not the same people. But, you know, over time, you know, there'll be some sort of like, meeting.
00:31:40.620 - 00:32:14.990, Speaker C: Of the middle in terms of this time lock mechanism. I'm just thinking from a dj's perspective, because I can't help it. Is there an opportunity within the kind of like the current business models per se, which would allow for kind of like a more dj and approach where like. Like almost like a. A process of liquidation within the time lock? I mean, is, does that exist if you, like, willing to take like a really high risk scenario? I mean, does that exist within the confines of what you guys are doing?
00:32:15.650 - 00:32:59.232, Speaker B: So it's not possible on bitcoin natively. However, there will be a market that will form around these things because you can think about, like, different lock durations having different values, right? Like, there's a whole bunch of pieces there, and someone is willing to go take that risk. Right? Like, so you're going to see more and more of these, like, kind of new products and weirdness emerge, if that makes sense. But markets will form. I think it's also too important to highlight that bitcoin staking is designed, by definition, to be risk free. It's supposed to be like, really for the staunchest bitcoin advocate all the way to people that just want yield, right? But it's designed to be that way, and it's inflexible to a degree for that purpose. Right.
00:32:59.232 - 00:33:41.526, Speaker B: Some of these later products that will come out in Q three and Q four are going to be more liquidity focused. And when you get into more liquidity focused again, you just have to be aware that you're incurring some risk as you start to go with these. But some of the things that we're super excited about are like bitcoin lsts. And this is like, this going to be like, really kind of a missing piece for bitcoin defi. But if you're willing to take a little bit of risk, why not take core staking yield and then also bring it into a defi product on sort of core? So now you have yield stacking, or now that yield can go, or that LST can go into a restaking protocol. But that's really the next wave of what's going to unlock this. You're going to see the bitcoin TVL overall triple tenant.
00:33:41.526 - 00:34:19.370, Speaker B: Like, it's going to be crazy short term because now you're solving a little bit of liquidity for those that are willing to go take the risk. It's no longer either more. And that's going to be a big unlock. And again, so, like, core will have some stuff that they'll announce there. We're also partnered with so many amazing, amazing lsts currently because the space is just so big. And I think there was a question earlier around, like, how far along bitcoins path are we towards, like, it being a collateral asset and that sort of thing? And I think we can look at the eth space a little bit as Steve. And if you look at Steth, there's been this trend towards eth plus staking, yield plus utility better than just raw eth.
00:34:19.370 - 00:34:31.710, Speaker B: Right. And I think you'll see that to some degree on the bitcoin side to be able to track some of that LST usage. And it'll give you some sort of a proxy for where along the maturity curve we are at bitcoin. Fi.
00:34:34.250 - 00:34:35.910, Speaker C: Do you want to add to that, Alex?
00:34:37.320 - 00:35:50.948, Speaker A: Something kind of like going back before. It's like rich was saying how things changed recently. And it's kind of like, important to mention that basically, this whole move towards BTC five started with basically taproot, which basically it's something that enhanced bitcoin's capabilities, basically, by making it possible to add different script methods in bitcoin. And taproot, basically is what gave birth to ordinals. And with ordinals. Ordinals is a move that took a lot of traction, that the vocal minority absolutely despised them because ordinals, it's basically nfts on bitcoin using satoshis, right? Making inscriptions on bitcoin and tying those to satoshis. And it clocked for a while.
00:35:50.948 - 00:36:16.090, Speaker A: The network bitcoin and this Pokemon absolutely despised it. However, it's a bulk of minority. The market actually really liked it. They really liked those fees. And it opened up this entire new world of, basically acceptance towards building on bitcoin. And I think this has very long term implications. It's a mindset change.
00:36:16.090 - 00:36:54.290, Speaker A: And if we think that at the end, bitcoin and ETH do compete for assets, I have to say it's like we have the ETH. ETF's launching in six days. They may end up coming earlier, but I don't think so. It's going to be the 23rd again. It doesn't matter if it's 23rd or 22nd, whatever. But the point with that is that you can be, and I am bullish on ETH relative to bitcoin. Short term, this can last for a month until, I think we last for months until the flows come in, but eventually, now it's bitcoin in the forefront.
00:36:54.290 - 00:37:04.010, Speaker A: Now that we can build on bitcoin, it makes sense to bet on bitcoin long term from any possible angle, and not just store value.
00:37:06.510 - 00:37:31.268, Speaker C: I love that. I think that is actually the sales pitch, is that there is so much more now. There's so much opportunity, and I want to do, obviously, and I'm glad you brought up ordinals. And, I mean, do you think it just remains a creative thing? I mean, there's this other. There's this other proposal or idea that's also emerged. I forget what it is now. I apologize.
00:37:31.268 - 00:37:52.610, Speaker C: But it was something that essentially changes the way that. That bitcoin transacts. I'm not. I'm not entirely sure, but it was also introduced during Taproot, the q q something. Anyways, I'll come back to it, if I remember, but essentially what's happening right now is that we've got. Sorry, Alex, do you want to just.
00:37:52.770 - 00:37:53.630, Speaker A: No, no.
00:37:54.130 - 00:38:06.510, Speaker C: Okay, so I think. So I think from Arun's perspective, ordinal's perspective, do you think it's just a creative thing that affords an opportunity from a creative perspective, or do you think that there might be something there going forward?
00:38:08.010 - 00:39:13.606, Speaker B: I mean, I think it's ironic, but bitcoin did nfts better than ethereum did. Like, the rareness and, like, provable scarcity of ordinal theory makes a ton of sense, right? Like, you can disagree with the artwork, whatever else, like, from, like, a rarity point of view, it actually makes more sense. And I think that's very interesting. And, like, I think that also helped kind of get some of the most staunch bitcoiners excited about it, is because it allows them to say, bitcoin did it better. And there's that whole narrative that, like, ethereum is a test network, bitcoin, and, like, all those sorts of things, right? But in some ways, you know, that's actually kind of proven to be true. But I think there is more staying power here than people think. And I think this idea of bitcoin being this open minting platform for anyone to participate on, I don't know if it's icos, I don't know if it's that same kind of mindset, like, fundamentally, but this open access, like, purely eco terian viewpoint has really gotten people excited all over the earth in a way that we haven't seen such participation in a long time.
00:39:13.606 - 00:39:15.530, Speaker B: So I think it's here to stay.
00:39:17.750 - 00:40:03.718, Speaker A: On ordinals. I think it could be helpful for the audience. Like, we repeat and talk about ordinals a lot, and it's not entirely clear what they are to many people. So basically, ordinals are a protocol that an innovation that allows people to create and transfer nfts, or let's call it unique digital assets on bitcoin. And they do this by assigning a unique identifier to satoshis. And then you can track them through bitcoin. And they use basically the order of satoshis in the blockchain.
00:40:03.718 - 00:40:40.898, Speaker A: And these kind of like creates a unique serial number and that's why, you know, each one is unique. So, yeah, it's nfts on bitcoin. And right now it's. Yeah, nfts are dead right across, all across. I think they will make a comeback. I'm not an NFT guy, and I have no stake in nfts, but I do think they're going to make a comeback. We just need, I mean, it's cycles, euphoria always come back.
00:40:40.898 - 00:41:16.106, Speaker A: We may be doing very well on bitcoin and the major crypto assets, and we are. But almost everything else in crypto is being, with a few exceptions, like coal core ton maker Ondo. Everything else is really bad. And that's because retail hasn't truly come back into crypto. Retail has come back into bitcoin. Retail is buying the bitcoin ETF, but they're not buying our shit coins. And it's cycles and human nature.
00:41:16.106 - 00:41:46.560, Speaker A: They will come back just as liquidity improves and people start having more money. Right now is disposable income is basically going down as a response to a lagged response to basically to the Fed's monetary policy. This is going to change. And when that comes back, I think it's sensible. It's a high odds bet thinking that the NFTs will make a comeback, therefore ordinals and so on. Right.
00:41:49.300 - 00:42:31.644, Speaker B: I was going to say actually went to something recently that was, I think it was the first ordinals hedge fund called unbroken. And essentially what they were saying is kind of similar to what you were saying, alex, was like, there's this cyclic nature, or cyclical nature of bitcoin and nfts on top of bitcoin. If you want bitcoin structurally, like, should be even higher beta, potentially even than some of these assets, right. You look at almost as like levered bitcoin, you have a lot of different risks there, right? Like your ability to, like, identify the art and like, there's more pieces under the hood. But it was interesting. I'd actually, until I met those folks, I'd actually never heard of like anyone systematically deploying capital into the ordinal space. So it was an interesting one to watch.
00:42:31.644 - 00:42:36.398, Speaker B: But I think, I think it will come back and we'll see more and more money coming back. Go into the NFT space generally on.
00:42:36.414 - 00:43:25.814, Speaker C: Bitcoin, just kind of like going a little bit left field here. I mean, we have touched on it a little bit, but like we seeing quite a different trajectory in terms of how we've seen other cycles behave. I mean, the behavior of the cycle has been quite different. You know, you saying that liquidity has pretty much gone into bitcoin, the majority of bitcoin, and nothing, not much else. And I believe you on that side of things. But why is it that we haven't seen retail come in like they have in the past, particularly after the halving? What is actually going on from a sentiment market perspective, in your opinion, Alex, right now in general, in crypto, well.
00:43:25.952 - 00:44:24.406, Speaker A: I mean, most crypto assets, again, with few exceptions, I can count them with my two hands, they giving up, not only they've given up the entire gains of 2024, which is pretty rough in a year where basically bitcoin is up like, I think it's up like 70% right now. And furthermore, they've actually given up many of these giving up the entire market. They went back last week, they were back down, trading to basically summer of 23. And for those who remember summer of 23, it was pretty rough. We were playing chickenshit and hamster fights with shitcoins, basically, because things were pretty depressing and trying to get entertained and make money in the process. But yeah, they went back down there. And so sentinel is pretty rough.
00:44:24.406 - 00:45:22.320, Speaker A: And something else happened is most people in crypto, they are very light on bitcoin. You have the ones that have a lot of bitcoin because they are maxes to call them, in a way. You have the ones that have a lot of bitcoin because they are actually not in crypto. They live normal lives and they just like bitcoin and they accumulate bitcoin and they have normal lives, or they have normal portfolios with a lot of bitcoin and they don't touch, really, the bitcoin. But the guys who are very active in crypto and the ones who basically define narratives within this small crypto world that we have, which usually stems from crypto Twitter, they are very light on bitcoin, and they were very, very suffering from PTSD last year. And they still kind of are. So when bitcoin started going on the ETF news, they missed it.
00:45:22.320 - 00:45:51.526, Speaker A: Most people missed it. And then they turn around and it's November, and go like, what the fuck? And then they see the ETH. ETF news and go like, okay, here it is. Now ETH is going to play catch up with bitcoin. Let's bet on ETH and let's bet on shitcoins because they're going to catch up. And they all came in late in the bitcoin move and they bought really high. And then that pump like, ETH has been doing fine.
00:45:51.526 - 00:46:28.370, Speaker A: But it's nothing extraordinary if you strip away the yield on ETH, right, and everything else got destroyed because people came in late. So what happens when you come in late and you see a bitcoin flying and you are actually, you made no money? Well, you get depressed and that goes through, that gets transmitted, and that sets the mood of what we're seeing right now, which in a way makes it even more bullish. When everybody's bearish and we have all these flows that just keep on coming, it's pretty bullish. So, yeah, I'm bullish. I don't know if that's clear.
00:46:29.600 - 00:46:54.802, Speaker C: I'm actually more bullish than anyone, and I haven't stopped. If you follow me on Twitter, you'll know that. And it's because of this kind of discussion. I mean, I completely agree with you, Rich. I know you also super bullish, but I mean, I think, where do you see the rest of the year going from this point onwards? I mean, we've got this ECTF coming in. I think that's huge. I think that's very bullish for bitcoin.
00:46:54.802 - 00:46:58.750, Speaker C: Funny enough, I'm curious what you think, just in general.
00:46:59.650 - 00:47:33.908, Speaker B: So I think the macro backdrop here is super important. Like, if you zoom out rather than just look at maybe the crypto natives. I was fortunate to spend a few years at Coinbase during some of the biggest moments of the last cycle. And the retail narrative is just not there the way that it was previously. Right? Like, if you look into 2021 coming off of COVID you're hitting multiple rounds of stimmy checks. Like it's a very different environment. And just mania is really kind of what took hold and that propagated through a lot of 2021.
00:47:33.908 - 00:48:09.424, Speaker B: You also had Alameda and you had FTX, which potentially was kind of the second half of 2021. There was just a very different structural environment there. But I think the macro backdrop this fall is quite interesting. Right? The market's now, now pricing in maybe three different rate cuts, seeming ever likely that Trump will take office. And there's a much more dovish approach to crypto, which could be psyops. You never have any idea when it comes to american policy. But just in general, I think the backdrop is setting up for what really could be a supercycle.
00:48:09.424 - 00:48:40.946, Speaker B: And I think the shakeout that happened earlier in the year is actually largely healthy. Crypto has the tendency to get way over its skis and then to come back and these really brutal shakeouts and deleveraging periods. But I think long term, it's actually healthier for it. I think. I do ascribe to the theory, though, that this time is different. I think we might be out of the four year cycles to Alex's original point, because we have structural inflows from these ETF's and soon again, this ETF that we've never seen before. Right.
00:48:40.946 - 00:49:09.200, Speaker B: And the capital bases that have been exposed to crypto in the last 15 years are a drop in the bucket relative to what's on the sidelines today. Even if we get to, like, 2%, like Alex was mentioning, that's just an enormous amount of capital flowing into this space. And how it goes from bitcoin or ETH to alts, I have absolutely no idea. But I do think that this time is different. And I think the backdrop heading into this fall and into 2020 2025 could be really interesting.
00:49:09.540 - 00:49:36.130, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, just to summarize, like, shallower dips in bitcoin, because obviously there's institutional awareness, and more importantly, they're not going to dump on a whim. Secondly, you know, this constant flow of capital coming into the. Into the ecosystem, even if it's confined to Ethan, bitcoin, I think that's obviously a net positive thoughts on Solana and ETF. On Solana and. And how that will play out. Alex?
00:49:36.630 - 00:50:10.200, Speaker A: I'm very bullish, Solana way more than, to be honest. For me, it's mostly, it's bitcoin. Bitcoin ecosystem, and Solana well, and ton as well. But let's leave town for another conversation. I think Seoul has. Well, they have the mind share. They have a lot of volume and a lot of traders, and they have something that ETH has a problem, which is fragmentation.
00:50:10.200 - 00:50:55.176, Speaker A: And all of these l two s are like their own tribes fighting one another. And by the way, I fully expect that to happen in BTC five. But we're years away from that because BTC five is so young, ETh is mature, and you have all these mature players fighting one another with very high valuations at the same time and very high issuance in short schedules. I expect BTC fight to grow and eventually get there, and the winners going to fight one another very harshly as it's happening in ETH. But we're a long way from there. This is a very nascent, and valuations are much lower, so we can worry about that later. Right.
00:50:55.176 - 00:51:11.620, Speaker A: We should worry about that later. We're years away from that. So back to Eth. It's the fragmentation. It's an issue. It's not just liquidity, it's liquidity is mind share and is the people fighting one another. And you don't have that in Solana.
00:51:11.620 - 00:51:41.330, Speaker A: Solana is exactly opposite. It's very simple, is a very simple message. Simple is good. So that on Solana, something I wanted to say that I just had this thought, is Trump is releasing his fourth NFT collection. He just said it yesterday. What are the odds that he launches his fifth or 6th one and it's launched on ordinals?
00:51:42.280 - 00:51:55.500, Speaker C: Yeah, it looks like you need. Richard, looks like you need to get on the phone and just explain to him that there's this thing called core and it's very capable of doing what he needs it to do without the complexity.
00:51:56.280 - 00:52:07.180, Speaker B: To be fair, I'd much rather see an ordinance collection than Trump on pump phone. I think better outcome for us all.
00:52:07.850 - 00:52:32.430, Speaker C: So just, I mean, just coming back to, obviously, you know, the. The product that, or the products that that core brings to the table. I mean, is that something that essentially, could. Could we ever see a scenario where we have a Solana bitcoin combo the same way that we have an east bitcoin combo? Sort of a bit of a curveball question.
00:52:33.140 - 00:53:07.470, Speaker B: No, I think there is a possibility. Right. I think, like, the oposs, like, only possible in Solana meme is true in a lot of ways where, like, you know, many of these other ecosystems aren't trying to have sub 400 millisecond block times and aren't trying to build clocks. Right? Like, they just don't work in some other systems. So I do think you'll see some of these other ecosystems, you know, like core, act as these liquidity layers for bitcoin, bitcoin derivatives, and then maybe some of these execution will happen in other places, like Solana. So I think you'll see more and more of this, like, coopetition, if you will. Stupid business school word.
00:53:07.470 - 00:53:21.398, Speaker B: But I think makes sense in this case, where it's going to be a one plus one equals three opportunity. Because those ecosystems aren't actually really competing with each other for the same thing. Like, what we've seen in the Solana world is they're the retail chain.
00:53:21.534 - 00:53:21.830, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:21.870 - 00:53:47.738, Speaker B: And it's been amazing to watch. I mean, I've had so many friends tell me I need a phantom wallet. They don't know that they're really even using Solana. They just know they need this thing called Sol. Like it's that abstract in a way, on some level. And I don't recall anything like that past the previous cycle when I was getting random phone calls of I need Shiba Inu. You know, like these various kind of things that kind of came out of the blue that show you, okay, retails here.
00:53:47.738 - 00:54:12.110, Speaker B: Like doge, maybe the cycle previously. Right. And I think what we'll see more and more of, like, is some amount of specialization of these different ecosystems where you are general purpose in that you can support n dimensional use cases, but some groups will do some things better. And on that would be a better opportunity for you to partner versus risk, fragmentation or some of these other issues which we've seen, you know, in the ETH experiment.
00:54:13.370 - 00:54:23.720, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a question for you, Rich. How would you compare core with stacks? Let's talk core versus stacks, if you may.
00:54:24.740 - 00:54:48.120, Speaker B: Totally. So I think stacks, we're friendly with these guys. They've been around for quite a while. They really helped show people that there is interest in building on top of bitcoin. And they built one of the first bitcoin ecosystems. And soon their Nakamoto upgrade will go live, which I think will get them to more. More best in class or close to best in class performance.
00:54:48.120 - 00:55:27.896, Speaker B: One of the things that I loved about the stacks folks is they've been pretty transparent with some of the issues that they've had about the last year. Plus, in particular, where they've talked about some of the censorship from different mining pools and the unpredictable block times, but they've actually kind of taken those on the chin, which I really respect most crypto projects would never do that. They try to paint some story around it and give you a full runaround, but they've said, no, here's the solution. Solution is Nakamoto. And I think that's something that we really respect. Neven team been in the space for a super long time, and I think they're good actors that will be here for the long term. I think with all that said, I think the way that I view them is kind of an isolated, isolated ecosystem at the moment.
00:55:27.896 - 00:55:55.408, Speaker B: Their clarity language has a lot of very admirable properties where it's potentially safer and some of these other pieces on top of it. However, it's really difficult to bring in builders that way. And with that, if you're not EVM compatible, there is this uphill battle to go attract builders and to go get them into your ecosystem. It's harder everything, all your audits are more expensive. It's harder to get different partners. Everything has to be kind of bespoke and new. And that is something I know that they're working on with their wasm and that sort of thing.
00:55:55.408 - 00:56:40.176, Speaker B: As time goes on to open it up to potentially other vms, that's a little bit of like a future thing for them. But I do think they're slowly starting to kind of walk that way as, hey, there actually is more of this than just our own closed ecosystem. I think from an ecosystem point of view, I think Core's vision is again, just a little bit broader. Core has on one side this whole bitcoin defi ecosystem, and on the other side it has since. What is bitcoin Lido trying to power bitcoin yield for all these different folks. And the reason I hate the word competition, but I think fits here so much, is that when you think about it, there's actually competition on one side with stacks, but also partnership motions, right, where they'll have their own bitcoin derivatives and things like that. Maybe that will want to plug into core yield.
00:56:40.176 - 00:57:08.950, Speaker B: So there actually is this spot now where it's not about cutting each other down at the knees, it's about trying to get more and more excitement around bitcoin ecosystem to help bring that narrative forward. Because that's how we all wind up winning in some ways, by trying to get this whole narrative to be bigger than the bitcoin, the ethereum, l two space to begin and then orders of magnitude bigger later. But I think they're great for the space and we're really excited to be able to compare ourselves to them on a daily basis.
00:57:12.410 - 00:57:33.600, Speaker A: Something also I think it would be useful to talk for the audience is understanding what's the difference, for example, between a L2 on a side chain. If you have taken that, you're the expert on the field here, not me.
00:57:34.820 - 00:58:11.422, Speaker B: Totally, totally happy to give my take. And the hot take is they're all side chains today. And I think the way to think about it is many of these l two s in the bitcoin space are actually more aspirational l two s than they are today. And a lot of that's due to limitations of bitcoin itself. There is no building unilaterally exit in bitcoin. Hopefully with BitVm V two or BitVM X or one of these other solutions that some of these groups are working on, we'll be able to get closer towards unilateral exit or maybe be able to do a full ck prover with some sort of soft fork to bitcoin over time. Like maybe we'll get there.
00:58:11.422 - 00:58:59.752, Speaker B: But as of now, these are centralized sequence that you have to trust with, with all your funds. And that's a tricky spot for a lot of these bitcoin, for a lot of these bitcoin holders. Like bridge risk is really real, but especially if you have to just trust one entity. But I think many of these teams are actually in it for the right reasons and trying to build the forefront of really hard tech, which is to make this all possible, because they want to get to this underlying solution that is trustless bridging and to be able to actually go to these other ecosystems. So I admire many of these teams, but I think it's really important to be honest who we're at today, because in reality, when you think l two, you think of the ethereum l two guarantees, but the ethereum l two guarantees are just starting to get there. We just got fraud fruits in arbitrum not that long ago. So there's been a lot of overselling of the l two narrative.
00:58:59.752 - 00:59:51.740, Speaker B: And as of now, if you have no fraud proofs, it's all off chain computation. That's scary. It's nothing really crypto potentially, right? And I want to get to that spot where we can trust because I think l two s are a viable scaling solution. We just have to crawl, walk, run to go get there. So I think the course is, we've always said we're a sidechain because we're not as much of like a narrative focused group where it's really just about, hey, we're this scaling solution for bitcoin, trying to reward bitcoin holders, bitcoin miners, and try to expand the bitcoin economy. And when some of these other things come into place, whether it's a bit vm bridge or one of the BitVM derivatives, core will add one of these bridges that meets that requirement. Right? Like it's important that core is product focused, where the idea is in the day we want to build stuff and bring them to users versus try to be just in research land and just in research land.
00:59:56.360 - 00:59:57.140, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:59:59.050 - 01:00:00.830, Speaker C: So they're all side chains.
01:00:03.010 - 01:00:10.834, Speaker B: That's my view. I think it's a common view from a lot of bitcoiners, if that makes sense. But there's nothing wrong with side chains.
01:00:10.962 - 01:00:11.630, Speaker C: Yes.
01:00:12.690 - 01:00:45.782, Speaker B: And I think this is also a little bit of that shift that I mentioned. I remember when people would first talk to me about core being a sidechain. I was initially skittish because I remember when rootstock first launched, everything else, everyone was like, oh, side chains are terrible, and everything else, and it's like, it's not really true. Like, the idea behind all these things is like, you're trying to do something that isn't possible in bitcoin today. And that's the key thing. If you're trying to add capabilities or add more utility to bitcoin, that's being bitcoin aligned. Right? Like, that's actually trying to grow the pie, and that's so important.
01:00:45.782 - 01:01:08.472, Speaker B: But it's like getting rid of a little bit of that dirty word, if that makes sense, because historically, like, there was that connotation with it. But I think that's mostly been broken. And I give a lot of credit to the bitcoin layers folks, actually, for helping on that, because when they very clearly go through their list or whatever, and they don't view pretty much anything as they'll do, so I really appreciate them having to kind of, like, propagate.
01:01:08.496 - 01:01:13.640, Speaker C: That message in terms of, like, just quick.
01:01:13.680 - 01:01:31.270, Speaker A: 121. A criticism of polygon or matic back in the day was precisely, oh, it's not a L2, it's a sidechain. Piece of shit. Dump it. Yeah, it used to be a dirty word indeed.
01:01:35.090 - 01:01:50.850, Speaker C: Just in terms of like. Yeah, just in terms of security. Like, when you look at, like, functionally, if you've got core doing its thing, how does core doing its thing contribute to the greater bitcoin network?
01:01:51.870 - 01:02:16.608, Speaker B: Yeah, so with the Satoshi plots consensus mechanism, core rewards the bitcoin miners and mining pools and help them secure the core chain. And that's that bi directional flow. That's really nice. Right. They're providing security and receiving, you know, capital in the form of emissions from the core for doing so. And that's one of the models. Some of these other models are, again, they want to help increase transaction fees in the bitcoin chain, using bitcoin as a DA layer.
01:02:16.608 - 01:02:46.740, Speaker B: And that's one of the things that's really kind of challenged at the moment is bitcoin doesn't have enough DA throughput to handle lots of these. L two s. So it's one of these problems that people are working on. But some folks like Nubit and others are working on these bitcoin native da layers going after like kind of the celestia stuff, but built on bitcoin. So there's some really cool stuff that will happen there. But I think at the end of the day, it's important that these scaling solutions are again, symbiotic with bitcoin versus just parasitic.
01:02:50.560 - 01:03:08.720, Speaker C: Cool. Just in terms of the kind of like what's been successful, like on the bitcoin side of things. Do you guys think that the lightning network was successful or is successful? Do you think there's kind of like a bit of fail there?
01:03:08.880 - 01:03:43.508, Speaker A: It's failed to get any traction. And I think the main issue, the main reason that's happened is complexity. The ux of lightning is very, very, very complex. So, like, setting up the lightning network is complex for average users. It requires running a lightning node, managing channels, understanding channel liquidity is just not user friendly. And this explains why there was, there's been no. No traction and no adoption.
01:03:43.508 - 01:04:16.930, Speaker A: And to be honest, I think bitcoiners or some very small vocal minority within bitcoin has been gaslighting us on the importance of lighting for many years. I think this stopped around about two years ago. Kind of like, you know, it's already dead. You know, that meme, it's already dead. So we kind of moved on. But till 21, it was lighting these, lighting that for so many years, and it just doesn't work.
01:04:17.520 - 01:04:22.520, Speaker C: You know, isn't that what Jack Molars is using to do his transactions?
01:04:22.640 - 01:04:26.860, Speaker B: Supposedly it's the back end of strike. Yeah.
01:04:27.280 - 01:04:40.500, Speaker C: So strike is back end of. Okay, so that doesn't bode well for his business. Yeah, but does that not bode well for his business? I mean, or is he just fine carrying on using it?
01:04:41.600 - 01:05:44.020, Speaker B: I don't know the specifics of his, of his business in particular, but I. I think to go back to a little bit of the original question of is lightning success or fail? I think in some ways it's both. On one, I think lightning set this amazing, almost like a bastion of trustlessness that all bitcoin scaling solutions should aspire to get to, which I think is really important. I think on the other side, it taught us a very valuable lesson, which is you can't over invest in something because we essentially spent five years on lightning, and lightning really does work in any sort of, like, practical way. And it also showed us that the way to make lightning work, quote, unquote is to make it custodial, which is like how all these different solutions work today that have any scale because of the capital efficiency problem and other things that Alex mentioned. So I think it taught us a bunch of valuable lessons, but I don't think it itself has been a success in the way that we would have hoped. I would say that there are some payments use cases that are potentially promising, but we haven't seen anything in scale today.
01:05:45.720 - 01:06:25.448, Speaker C: Interesting. I think the real challenge here at the end of the day, is obviously being able to effectively send your bitcoin without any issues. I think that's something that we know can be done, but can it be done better? I mean, that's what obviously lightning was attempting to do. Are there any potentially other solutions out there that could do it better than it's currently being done? Or are we kind of like stuck in inverted commas with the current options that we have outside of like, that's.
01:06:25.464 - 01:06:50.100, Speaker B: What all the bitcoin scaling solutions are trying to do effectively, right? They're trying to allow you to use your bitcoin in cheaper, faster environment for all these higher throughput, lower cost use cases, and then to bring it back to bitcoin l one when you want it to be in more like cold storage mode. So I think, like, there's very different approaches to how these solutions work, but they're ultimately trying to do the same thing, which is scale bitcoin.
01:06:50.260 - 01:07:15.480, Speaker C: Okay, just final question before we wrap it up. Alex, specifically for you, obviously from a kind of like a big picture perspective, and then, rich, you can also chime in, is where do you see kind of like bitcoin, not only from a, you know, a valued asset in the future, but where do you see, and what role do you see bitcoin playing in the next, say, ten years?
01:07:17.420 - 01:08:03.890, Speaker A: It's. It's what I was discussing initially. It's digital gold in the process of adoption and in the process of basically convincing potential stakeholders that, hey, I am digital gold. That means increased adoption. It means increased holdership across traditional portfolios. I do not see it as a means of payment. I see it as digital gold, and I see it as a potentially, eventually, eventually and very far off a reserve asset.
01:08:03.890 - 01:08:47.200, Speaker A: The odds of this, actually, this is interesting, maybe increasing with the new BP nominee of Trump, advance. JD Vance, is very interesting. Like, he's been, he's been talking about the devaluation of the dollar for a while. And if you look at the Trump Bloomberg interview he gave last night, the first thing he talked about was effects and about how the dollar would be. It would be an official for the dollar to below was very interesting. Like, he was not asked about the dollar, he was asked about the economy in general, and he redirected straight to the dollar. So, I mean, this is kind of like stretching it up.
01:08:47.200 - 01:09:40.474, Speaker A: Like, my view is that we're very, very far away from the US acquiring and using bitcoin as a reserve asset. Even more so because of the fact that the US barely even has gold as a reserve asset. It's like holdership is like diminutive. But that being said, it's like, how do you devalue the dollar? Well, you could actually start buying gold. You dump dollars and buy gold, you could lower interest rates and basically put pressure on the long end by various means to basically keep yields down. Although that being said, effects rates are usually determined by short rates rather than long rates, even though that still affects short rates means like the short end of the yield curve, meaning like maturities, and then like from. From days to up to two years.
01:09:40.474 - 01:10:34.880, Speaker A: Right. And so my point here is that there is, there is, yeah, you could, you could. You could lower rates by basically being active in the bonds market, or in the bills market, or notes market. Sorry, it's three different words depending on the maturity, it's a different word. Or by putting pressure on the Fed to keep rates low. But the point of this rant was the sudden emphasis on the dollar being expensive from Trump, which ties back to Banza's point. In a very unlikely, yet feasible world, we could see the US starting to basically incorporate, starting to buy bitcoin.
01:10:34.880 - 01:11:31.826, Speaker A: I really don't think this is going to happen. I'm just opening up the possibility based on this in the near future, it's store value, digital goal in the process of adoption, eventually reserve asset. And at the same time, a last thing that I want to mention is this is a thesis I've been presenting for many, many years, which is basically that bitcoin at the end. What bitcoin is, or what it is for many, is it's a hedge. It's a hedge against the tail risk of central banks collapsing on the devaluation of the dollar and hedges. Oftentimes, this is very, very common in the volatility world. It's like nothing happens.
01:11:31.826 - 01:12:15.650, Speaker A: Nothing happens then all of a sudden, and then it's when you want your hedge, it happens all of a sudden. So if we ever were to get to the point where we are very concerned about the value of the dollar and or the sustainability of debt, which is already happening. You want to be long bitcoin and you want as much bitcoin as possible for as long as you're not screwing up your portfolio by, because you also want to have like Nvidia. It has to be a well diversified, a good portfolio. Unless you are a crypto native, in which case you're just 100% crypto. Right. And kind of like insane.
01:12:15.650 - 01:13:21.802, Speaker A: But a last point on this is ties back to what I was saying, which is this increasing concern about sustainability of debt. People have been talking about it in bitcoin worlds for a decade, but it's the curve. It's been doing like this. And we are on the accelerating part, actually. Even Powell, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, repeatedly mentioning how the US is not in a sustainable fiscal path. And recently, and this is starting to pick up at the very beginning, but this is happening is this view on bitcoin precisely as a hedge towards that. In broader macro slash traditional markets circles, bitcoin can help you hedge against the dollar collapsing and against debt getting out of control.
01:13:21.802 - 01:13:55.960, Speaker A: So those three things, potential reserve asset number three. Number one is store value and the increasing, increasing adoption of bitcoin as digital gold. And the number two is bitcoin as a hedge against debt out of control and the dollar imploding. And I'm aware that usually you say one, two, three nor three, one, two, but there you go.
01:13:57.260 - 01:14:01.880, Speaker C: Awesome answer. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you, Rich.
01:14:04.740 - 01:14:56.702, Speaker B: Super hard to follow that one up, admittedly. Where do I see things going over the next ten years? So a different version of that I get pretty frequently is like, when does bitcoin hit a million dollars? And my answer that I give back to people pretty frequently is hopefully not like in the immediate future because we're probably all in the streets like fighting an apocalypse or something. Like there's, there's some period of like maturity that we need to get to before that becomes a reality. But I do believe that Alex's three points are totally valid. And, and I think when I think about kind of like what it looks like, I think getting back to the first principles of why bitcoin was creative is meant to be an alternative to traditional financial system. And I think what we've seen is that bitcoin is actually the perfect collateral asset. And it is, again, this hedge on central banks imploding.
01:14:56.702 - 01:15:31.180, Speaker B: But what I can see happening over the next ten years is not necessarily bitcoin as payment because I don't think bitcoin's payment as a use case is really what most of the market wants. I think what people want to do is use bitcoin is collateral. So I can totally see a world where p two p blending becomes way more common, especially in emerging markets. And you're collateralizing your bitcoin for dollars on, like, short term rates. It's all trustless, using HDLC time locks. And I think that's a massive unlock to get rid of these traditional intermediaries. And I think could be this huge movement, but it's going to take some time.
01:15:31.180 - 01:16:19.304, Speaker B: Maybe it starts in emerging markets, starts to go other places. But why do I want to use banks? Why do I want to go to some groups if I don't have to trust them? And I think once some of these possibilities open, it's like a different version of hyper bitcoinization, if you will. Like, there was always that idea where, like, bitcoin uses money everywhere and that sort of thing, which I've never fully ascribed to. But I think even if you can get to bitcoin, just this amazing collateral asset that people can lend and borrow against freely, you now open up banking to billions of people that have never had access before. And I think that's what bitcoin was really trying to do originally. And I think that that possibility is now close, because you needed to be able to get to places where bitcoin could be used in cheaper, faster ways. Because I can't go spend $20 in a bitcoin transaction doesn't work in that system.
01:16:19.304 - 01:17:04.706, Speaker B: Right. This is why you need these scaling solutions. But I think you'll see some of these hit potentially global scale in the next decade. And that's the version of bitcoin I'm as excited about, where there's so much potential there for it to live its original purpose. And I think that's like a derivative of several of Alex's different use cases all put together. I do think that during the Trump administration, though, it's like at least ten, if not more percent chance that we do see some sort of like, strategic bitcoin reserve or something like that announced, whether it's by the US or someone else. But I do think we're like one or two market cycles away from that actually becoming something that's important, because it will get driven by larger capital allocators that want this hedge.
01:17:04.706 - 01:17:18.700, Speaker B: So as it becomes harder and harder to acquire, gets more and more expensive, you'll see that eventually nation states will want to get involved for the same reason they'll no longer have to trust the us government and everything else. So long story, long answer. But I I'm excited for the next ten years will bring.
01:17:20.480 - 01:17:54.340, Speaker C: What a great way to finish a very interesting discussion around a lot of topics we could probably carry on for several hours. I've got way more questions, so we're going to have to do this again, but really excellent perspectives just in terms of where we're going, where we've been. And the best part for me is we're in a super cycle and it's not a meme. So thank you for that. Your gift to me. I appreciate that, gentlemen, and let's do it again. Thank you very much for your time.
01:17:54.340 - 01:17:55.680, Speaker C: Is appreciated.
01:17:56.180 - 01:17:57.388, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks for having us.
01:17:57.404 - 01:17:59.724, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, likewise.
