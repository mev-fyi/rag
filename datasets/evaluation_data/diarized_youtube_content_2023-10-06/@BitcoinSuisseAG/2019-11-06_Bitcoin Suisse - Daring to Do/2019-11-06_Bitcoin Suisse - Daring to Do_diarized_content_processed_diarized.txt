00:00:09.800 - 00:00:37.384, Speaker A: A pioneering spirit has long been at the core of transformational change. Pioneers dare to do what no one has ever done before by spearheading the crypto financial revolution in Switzerland, we took this spirit to heart.
00:00:44.404 - 00:00:50.504, Speaker B: There were a number of storms just after we got started, and it actually almost killed the company.
00:00:51.514 - 00:00:58.134, Speaker C: We lost a few pounds, but we had a very clear belief in what crypto assets could do for the world.
00:01:15.034 - 00:01:18.002, Speaker B: Unlike many other companies in the scene.
00:01:18.138 - 00:01:19.754, Speaker C: We had seen this, and we were.
00:01:19.794 - 00:01:23.858, Speaker B: Confident in the technology lying behind the crypto assets.
00:01:23.986 - 00:01:27.614, Speaker C: So where other people started firing, we started hiring.
00:01:58.154 - 00:02:12.894, Speaker D: As a company, we retain the innate characteristics of a crypto firm, of a pioneer that started early, many years back, and that we can keep that together and add on layers of opportunities.
00:02:26.174 - 00:02:29.114, Speaker B: I guess you can say we were really the pioneers.
00:02:52.014 - 00:03:08.694, Speaker E: Every day we strive to continue to set new standards in the crypto financial industry with the mission to bridge the world of crypto assets with traditional finance for the benefit of our clients and the world.
