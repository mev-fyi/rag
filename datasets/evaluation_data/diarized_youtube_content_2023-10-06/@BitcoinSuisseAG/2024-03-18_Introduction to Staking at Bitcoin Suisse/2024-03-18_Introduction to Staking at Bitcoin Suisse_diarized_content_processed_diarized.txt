00:00:12.000 - 00:01:14.570, Speaker A: Staking is a way to participate in the validation of transactions and security of a blockchain network. Instead of mining, which requires computational power, staking involves locking crypto assets as a form of collateral for honest behavior. In return for their efforts, stakers receive staking rewards from the blockchain protocol. To stake, the cryptocurrency protocol has to be based on a proof of stake consensus algorithm, which nowadays most protocols do. The most prominent examples are Ethereum, Solana, Celestia, Polkadot, Tezos, and many more. One risk is related to the lockup periods for unstaking transactions, which several protocols have. This means if the market moves, I cannot withdraw my assets and sell them fast enough and may incur a loss.
00:01:14.570 - 00:02:10.782, Speaker A: Another risk can come from slashing, which typically occurs if the actual validation action isn't performed properly. Properly. In order to participate in staking, you as a client only have to hold the necessary crypto assets. Our hassle free staking services then take care of all the rest related to operational and technical processes. We run the validators and we distribute the staking rewards to you. In decentralized systems, you need a way to achieve agreement on whether a transaction is valid or not, and consensus algorithms do exactly this with the proof of stake consensus algorithm. The staker provides assets as a form of collateral to actively vote on whether transactions are valid and get penalized if they don't behave correctly.
00:02:10.782 - 00:02:36.274, Speaker A: Therefore, you have an economic incentive to not cheat. If the majority of the network participants do so, the integrity of the network is guaranteed. We take off the whole effort of operating validator infrastructure so that our clients can simply hold the assets in a staking account and sit back and participate passively.
