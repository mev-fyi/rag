00:00:00.640 - 00:00:18.902, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Andrei Meitzen. I'm the head client services and co founder of Bitcoin Swiss. When we talk about Ethereum, I remember quite clearly when I heard the first time of it. It was back in summer 2014 when the early founders came to our office to exchange some bitcoin against swiss francs.
00:00:19.078 - 00:00:51.018, Speaker B: They approached me and they said, hello, we are here to sell some bitcoin. We want to fund our project and our house. And it was here in souk in Switzerland. And I said, oh, your project, your house, what is this? We are going to build a global supercomputer which will execute distributed applications. And I said, hey, hey, can you explain it a little bit slower? And they said, oh yeah, we will dumb it down for you. We want to build a bitcoin 2.0. And I said, all right.
00:00:51.018 - 00:01:14.022, Speaker B: And we did the transaction. Even in the late evening when we visited, Vitalik was still hard at work at programming or writing. The house was covered in glass windows, and on every glass window in pens, you could see code and mathematical formulas scribbled and they worked bone hard. Looking backwards, it's super impressive on what they achieved.
00:01:14.198 - 00:01:25.206, Speaker A: Besides the business relationship also friendships started to evolve, not just on a personal, but also on a social level. We connected extremely well with them, and those are also friendships that we still maintain today.
00:01:25.350 - 00:01:55.534, Speaker B: We celebrated with the foundation into the early morning. It coincided with the birthday of one of the Ethereum founders. And here we are today, five years later. What an amazing achievement. Guys, what has this not meant for the crypto space in which we work and how privileged we have been, sitting on the sideline seeing everything you have achieved. So from the bottom of my heart, congratulations to Ethereum and to the Ethereum foundation. Happy birthday, Ethereum.
