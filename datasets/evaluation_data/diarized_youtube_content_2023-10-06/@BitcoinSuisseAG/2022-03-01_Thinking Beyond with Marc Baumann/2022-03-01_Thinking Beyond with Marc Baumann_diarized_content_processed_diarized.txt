00:00:00.440 - 00:00:56.562, Speaker A: In the days when bitcoin Swiss was founded, no one was talking about cryptocurrency. No one was talking about bitcoin. And it really took a lot of gut, a lot of courage to start that venture. I think crypto is an industry which is foreign to many people, which not many people know now more do than one or two or three or even seven, eight years ago when bitcoin Swiss was founded. So it needs a lot of convincing and it needs a lot of courage to start working in that industry, and it needs a strong belief why you do it. You don't start working for bitcoin Swiss nor any other crypto company if you're not convinced that crypto and blockchain technology have the potential to change the world. That's what many people at bitcoin Swiss have.
00:00:56.562 - 00:01:03.154, Speaker A: That's what we as a company believe, and that's why we are in the game, and that's why we're fighting every day to make it happen.
