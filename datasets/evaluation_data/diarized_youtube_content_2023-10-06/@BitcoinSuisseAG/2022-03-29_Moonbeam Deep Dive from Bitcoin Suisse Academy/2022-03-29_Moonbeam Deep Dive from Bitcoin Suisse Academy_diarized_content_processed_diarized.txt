00:00:04.640 - 00:00:39.684, Speaker A: Hi, Ian. Yeah, thanks a lot for the invitation to be part of this session. Yeah, today I brought some slides and I'm going to do a live demo of how is it to interact with Moonbeam? We're not going to go through Moonbeam in the code base and everything, but how is it as a user, how do you use Moonbeam? And it will feel very familiar. Basically, the title of the presentation, it's Moonbeam. It's an introduction to Moonbeam and we're an ethereum compatible blockchain on Polkadot. Like Ian said, my name is Alberto. I am part of the developer relations team that is working on the Moonbeam project.
00:00:39.684 - 00:01:41.858, Speaker A: So the agenda for today is that we're going to do a brief introduction into moonbeam. We're going to answer mainly two questions. What is it and why us? Why Moonbeam? Among all the options out there, why moonbeam? And then we're going to also talk a little bit about moonbeam tokenomics. So mainly it's going to be collateral economics, delegations, proof of stake, everything related to the tokenomics of Moonbeam, the inflation and the staking part of our technology. So, yeah, with that in mind, I guess the first question is a what? Right? What is Moonbeam? What is the project about? What do we offer? What is our unique selling point around many other options out there in the ecosystem? So Moomim is, like I said before, it's an Ethereum compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot. If you remember from Daniel's presentation, Polkadot is this like hub, this like central blockchain that is often called a or zero or relay chain. And Moom is one of these blockchains that connect to Polkadot.
00:01:41.858 - 00:02:25.606, Speaker A: And if you think about it, Polkadot does not offer any, like, end user functionality to users, right? Like developers cannot really build on top of Polkadot. So need to rely on these parallel blockchains or parachains to build apps to provide a functionality to the ecosystem. So mumim is just that. It's a parachain that provides an Ethereum compatible smart contract on Polkadot as any other Ethereum compatible blockchain. The base layer is the EVM. So we have an EVM as other parachains in the ecosystem, but we also have added layers that provides very different Ethereum compatibility features compared to other projects. Of course, we're built with substrate.
00:02:25.606 - 00:02:49.164, Speaker A: Substrate is this tech stack that it's used to build Polkadot. Polkadot. How do you say polka.com patable blockchains. If you want to connect to Polkadot, the easiest way is to start with substrate. What this provides us is just connect to Polkadot and use this native interoperability features, among other features. We have a full web three RPC support.
00:02:49.164 - 00:03:47.104, Speaker A: This means that we have a seamless integration with the Ethereum JSON RPC and you will actually see what this means in the demo that I'm going to do for you today. But what this means for developers is that they can easily use the theme technology stack if you're not familiar, if you're familiar with tools like Metamask, remix, Ether J's, Web three JF. So all these tools that developers know and love, they can easily use them on top of moonbeam, which gives us a very like a good advantage to other projects because you don't have to start with a completely new technology stack from scratch. You can use already the tools that you know and love and you have used on Ethereum for many years now and directly use them on Moonbeam without any problems. We have done what we called unified accounts. And so I'm not sure if Daniel mentioned it, but Polkadot uses an account system called with SR 25 59 cryptography. What this means is that for us it is a different technology account than Ethereums.
00:03:47.104 - 00:04:41.664, Speaker A: That's why when you see Polkadots accounts, they are like a different format than Ethereum accounts. For us, this was a big friction point if we wanted to be the most Ethereum compatible parachain on Polkadot, because Ethereum developers and Ethereum users are familiar with the Ethereum account system. So we basically merge the two account systems and we only use Ethereum accounts now. So that is why on the if you've ever used Moonbeam delegated tokens on Moonbeam, you're always using like Ethereum wallets and it's always related to an Ethereum account. And this has a lot of benefits that I can, I can mention later. And last but not, definitely not least, is like that we've done an amazing job from a business development perspective, from a dev rel perspective, to make sure that all the developer tools that developers need are available and they're usable with Boombeam. And also this is true for integrations.
00:04:41.664 - 00:05:21.660, Speaker A: And I have a slide next that is going to show you why this is important and why this is key, truly a key feature that Moonbeam offers as well. So basically the why. Now we answer the what. And now we're answer, going to answer the why. It says because Moomin combines the power of substrate with a being fully theorem compatible, right? So on one hand, like I mentioned before, we have a full EVM implementation and other features that separates us from, from just a basic EVM layer. But on the other side, we're built with, with substrate, and this means that we're natively interoperable. We have features such as governance as well that we actually inherit from Polkadot.
00:05:21.660 - 00:06:06.334, Speaker A: And we also have a proof of stake system. And we're going to talk a little bit about proof of stake later on the presentation. This means that Moonbeam is the easiest on ramp to Polkadot for a multi chain deployment. And this has been a big, let's say, selling feature that a lot of projects have actually seen on Moonbeam. Right. If I'm a project that is already deployed to ethereum, binance, smart chain avalanche, and I want to tap into another ecosystem, I want to tap to Polkadot. I want to enter the Polkadot Gear game, right? I can, if I go through Moomim, I can just use all the tech stack that I've used before and like seriously deploying the contracts in Moomim, it's a matter of like ten minutes if you're familiar with your tech stack, right? So it is the easiest on ramp to Polkadot.
00:06:06.334 - 00:07:17.614, Speaker A: So one of the things that I think that Ethereum has that is truly beautiful is the composability, right? So if you're not familiar with what composability is, is that projects might work with each other in a decentralized way, and this provides limitless combinations. What means, for example, is if you want to interact with Ethereum, you can go to do a flash loan on a project, let's say aave, and use that flash loan on the same transaction on a Dex and swap some tokens, and then in the same transaction pay your loan and everything. So that is what I think it's beautiful about Ethereum is that it has so many projects that can interact with each other, providing basically limitless combinations. Another thing that has been important is the tooling. Like I said before, Ethereum has created quite a lot of tools, and that is why it's in a totally different planet right now compared to tooling and developers in the blockchain ecosystem. For us, it was really important to make sure not only that our tech is there, but also there's some sort of composability on moonbeam. So that's why what I really like about this slide is that we wanted to bootstrap an interoperable ecosystem.
00:07:17.614 - 00:08:04.996, Speaker A: Polkadot provides the interoperability, but then we need to provide the correct tools, tooling for developers to build on top of. And so that is why I really like the interoperable composability, because we have had projects like Sushiswap, Moonwell, Curve, finance, fracs. All these projects deploy to our blockchain and actually users and developers can compose stuff with these deployments. So you have a similar sort of space that you would on Ethereum to start playing around and really exploit everything that Ethereum offers bought on Mumbi. Not only that, you also have the tools as a developer. You also have the tools that developers expect from a truly Ethereum chain. So you have indexers such as the graph and Covalent.
00:08:04.996 - 00:08:52.854, Speaker A: You have wallets such as Metamask and many others. You have a blog explorer such as Etherscan, which was a big important step for us and we had to develop quite a lot of tooling underneath to be able to support Etherscan. We have multisig capabilities with a friendly noses fork, all the developer tools that they use quite often like truffle, hard hat remix, etherjs, and we have also some oracles. Chainling is actually pending on Moonbeam, but we do have oracles coming and they can deploy their solutions quite easily to our blockchain. So who is building on Moomim this slide? It's truly hard to keep up to date. Honestly, I think I grabbed this picture from like three weeks ago and there's probably a more updated one right now. It's crazy.
00:08:52.854 - 00:09:19.786, Speaker A: We have all sorts of projects from different areas. We have Defi Dapps developers. We should add probably a new one here called gaming because there's a lot of gaming going on on Moonriver. Explorers, wallets, nfts. It's really great to see the traction and the interaction we have received from projects that want to build on Moonbeam to tap into Polkadot. And we also have another project called Moonriver for the Kusama ecosystem. So this image is quite incredible.
00:09:19.786 - 00:10:07.410, Speaker A: And this summarizes not only that the work we've done on the tech side, but also the work we have done on the business development side, marketing, developer relations. Because this is truly a joint effort, I brought a little bit of stats just to get a glimpse of how, you know, what has been the performance of Mumium since we launched nearly two months ago. So we've had roughly 3.7 million transactions. We have over 212,000 wallets created. There is right now 102 million glimmers, which is a native protocol token locked in the staking pallet, basically, which this means roughly $275 million. And we have more than 1200 ERC 20 tokens have been created to date, and this is only in the first two months, right.
00:10:07.410 - 00:10:51.354, Speaker A: For us, it's been quite mesmerizing how the network has gotten all these stats in only two months for sure. So this truly is a representation of the need of this sort of like technology in the Polkadot ecosystem. So I did, like Ian mentioned, I wanted to show you a little bit of a demo so you can, you can see what is to use moom. How is it a lot of people actually, when they see Moonbeam as a Polkadot project, they fear to use it because they're not familiar with the Polkadot technologies tag. I hope that this demo shows you how easy is to use moonbeam. If you're familiar with Ethereum. It is basically like using an Ethereum network.
00:10:51.354 - 00:11:13.414, Speaker A: I have metamask here, as you can see. I'm going to zoom in a little bit. I have metamask here, as you can see. And if you notice on the top right corner, I'm actually connected to our testnet. So this is Moonbase Alpha, which is our testnet, but for sure, I have also moonbeam and I also have Moonriver. So this is, you know, you can just use metamask to connect to any of our moom networks. Basically.
00:11:13.414 - 00:11:46.484, Speaker A: If you're wondering how you can do that, you can check our documentation site, which is Docs dot moomim.net work, and there's a little button here at the middle of the screen that if you can, if you click on it, it will actually configure metamask for you. So you can get started quite quickly. As a demo of how ethereum compatible we are, we actually deployed Uniswap fork. This is just to show the user base how ethereum compatible we are. And we created a website around this. So this is called Mumu swap.
00:11:46.484 - 00:12:05.854, Speaker A: This is nothing official. This is just to demo our Ethereum compatibility features. As you can see here. Because I have metamask connected to Moonbase alpha. You can see that the page already, the text here connected to Moonbase Alpha. This is just a defi Dex. A Dex.
00:12:05.854 - 00:12:42.484, Speaker A: In defi you have some tokens. Our native protocol token for the testnet is called Dev. And so I can just go ahead and do a swap, as you would on any ethereum network, any Dex on an ethereum compatible network, and I can just confirm the swap and you will see metamask popping up. My metamask is super zoomed in, so it's going to look a little bit weird. But you can see here that metamask is popping up. And as with any live demos, there's a slight delay or lag. But you can see here that I have this is a metamask transaction that if I scroll down there are some gas fees being charged and I can just confirm this transaction.
00:12:42.484 - 00:13:25.250, Speaker A: And I should be able to see this on a blog explorer like you would on Ethereum. So you see here that this transaction is pending, and after this transaction gets finalized, or like included in a blog, we'll see this transaction being successful. And I don't know if you noticed on my metamask, but I already had this Jupyter tokens added here on Metamask. So once the transaction is successful, I'm going to have quite a bit more. I do have quite a, quite a bit of Jupiter tokens here, but I'm going to have a little bit extra now that I swapped on a Dex. Right, so this shows you that this is basically the same experience as you would on any ethereum compatible chain. You can see that my transaction already went through.
00:13:25.250 - 00:14:09.406, Speaker A: So I swapped ten dev tokens for 1.16 Jupiter tokens, and if I refresh this, you can see that this transaction was successful and this is basically the tokens that got transferred. So like I said before, this is a very sort of like Ethereum like experience. Even though we're a Polkadot based blockchain, all the dapps that have been deployed until now, you will actually interact with them with your metamask wallet. A really cool feature is that because we've done the unified accounts thing where you actually, like I said before, we are now using Ethereum based accounts. You can actually import here. Wait, no, actually you can connect hardware wallets and you can use Ledger tresser.
00:14:09.406 - 00:14:57.210, Speaker A: I've not used lattice before, or any QR based wallets that connect to metamask. You can actually use them on moving. So we're actually, right now the only parachain that it's like ledger compatible or tracer compatible. And this is only true because our ethereum compatibility features. I'm going to go back to this demo at the latter part of the presentation because I want to show you some three other tabs that I have open. But I'm going to go back to the presentation so we can talk a little bit more about the tokenomics and parachain inflation and everything else. But before we do that, I wanted to show you a bit of like how do we fit the Polkadot context? And if you've ever asked why the name Moonbeam is because there is a song that got popularized by Frank Sinatra called Polka dots and moonbeams.
00:14:57.210 - 00:15:34.312, Speaker A: And you see here, there's a phrase of the song that, that I saw, Polkadot Amumius. So we thought they were like a really good match. So that's why where the name comes from. But the idea is that, like Daniel said, the Polkadot idea is that you have a central hub called Polkadot and you have these spirit chains. And I think he showed this picture as well. This is a very famous picture that Polkadot has basically used since day one. So the idea is that if you want to tap into the Polkadot ecosystem, so any other project in the ecosystem, Moomim can provide basically an easy ramp up for these developers, like I said before.
00:15:34.312 - 00:16:25.334, Speaker A: And so basically we have seen projects like Sendlink who have used Moom as a hub, as a Dex hub, and then you can get tokens from other parachains and ecosystem listed on Sendlink. Like I said before, we provide the best of both worlds because we're powered by substrate. So this means that interoperable, we have governance and staking and other features that we can develop because we'll build with substrate, but we're fully ethereum compatible. As I mentioned before, we have aether scan, we have the graph, we have oracles and everything. Last but not least, XCM. So XCM is the technology that allows this interoperability feature. And so basically the idea is to connect to other services in the ecosystem through mum's unique ethereum compatibility.
00:16:25.334 - 00:17:17.218, Speaker A: So like I said before, if you're a project that are spaced on moonbeam, you will be able to access other parachains that offer different features for the ecosystem as a whole. So the moonbeam tokenomics, so basically glimmer, it's GLMR, I think it's a native token of the protocol. And so basically we target as a parachain a 5% annual inflation. This is of the total supply. And the token is used basically for gas metering protocol security, which we're going to discuss a little bit on chain governance. So actually this is really cool because like I think Daniel mentioned Polkadot's governance, we also have the same governance features, meaning that the people, the token owners, actually can decide the future of the network with forkless upgrades. And this is also used for network transactions.
00:17:17.218 - 00:18:00.828, Speaker A: So this is not only within Mumbi, but also for XCM features, for example. And this is very cool. So basically because we want to be similar or like the same as Ethereum, our fee model is based on EIP 1559, but 80% of the fees are burned and 20% goes to the treasury. So the treasury is one feature that you can actually enable easily on Polkadot that there is like a parachain controlled treasury where like users via on chain governance, they can decide how to spend those funds if they want to fund grants, if they want to fund any project in particular and so on. Well, I said that the token is inflationary, but it really depends on engagement. Like EIP 1559.
00:18:00.956 - 00:18:01.220, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:01.252 - 00:18:35.092, Speaker A: So this could mean that in the future moonbeam can be a deflationary token, but it just really depends on the engagement and how much, how many tokens are burned. Part of this 80% compared to the new supply that is being created. Part of the tokenomics as well is considering that we are delegated proof of state network and this is key for protocol security. Why is taking. Why did we go through a proof of stake network? And the answer is called Nimbus. Nimbus is part of our parachain consensus. So the consensus that we've created internally as a parachain.
00:18:35.092 - 00:19:30.052, Speaker A: And so basically Nimbus allows us to go from, to say who is going to be the collator of the block producer. When I say the term collator is the same as block producer or miner on Ethereum, even though this is a proof of state network, Nimbus allows us to go from a pool of candidates, collaters. So people that are part like they want to be collaters and they have done a minimum requirements to be collaters, allows us to go from a candidate pool set to selected candidates. Right. So basically it's a filter scheme that will help us say who is going to be the person that is going to produce a next block. And the first filter is what takes you from a set of collateral candidates to a set of selected candidates for a round and around is 1800 blocks on Mumbi. So this is basically a first filter and this is done by amount of stake, right.
00:19:30.052 - 00:20:18.904, Speaker A: So the top n collators that have the most tokens staked will go to the selected candidates for the next. So the selected candidates will have a chance to produce a blocks in the next 1800 blocks, basically. And the second filter is basically amongst the selected candidates. It's going to help to select an eligible candidate, to author a specific block. So basically using a random source, there's an entropy source. We're not going to grab a subset of selected candidates and for a specific block, you know, n amount of collaters are going to be able to produce that block. Currently on Moomin, there's only one, meaning that if that candidate, that, that that collider that was selected to, to produce block XYZ is not available for whatever reason, the network will, will have a micro stall of one block, basically.
00:20:18.904 - 00:20:55.206, Speaker A: And, and basically the collator will miss an earning that the reward that he was, you know, allowed to have because of that, he was eligible to produce a blockbuster, basically. So another part of the moving tokenomics is around the inflation, like I said before. And we have to secure the block production basically of the network. And so that's why I presented a little bit of staking. And so this part is to show you how the 5% inflation, it is distributed, right? So we have collators, which are the block producers and the network maintainers. And they will get basically 1% out of the 5% inflation. So this is 20% of the inflation.
00:20:55.206 - 00:21:31.362, Speaker A: Basically they earn blocks, they earn rewards based on blocks produced. So out of this 1800 blocks, in a certain bound, they're going to produce, let's say, I don't know, 300 blocks, 200 blocks, and they will earn rewards based on those blocks. 2.5% go to delegators, which is basically they're going to be selfish and they're going to try to select the most performing collaters because they're actively looking for better rewards. And last but not least, 1.5% of the inflation is basically sent to the parachain bond reserve. So this helps secure future parachain leases.
00:21:31.362 - 00:22:09.610, Speaker A: And this is basically because when you connect to Polkadot, you have to bond or lock some tokens for a lease to be able to connect. And so this is just an example that I brought here. This is that the payout for a single collater that he received basically 112 glimmers for like 1800 blocks, he received 112 glimmers. So this means that he produced x amount of blocks. And you calculate these rewards basically by using this formula. So the reward that collateral gets is going to be 0.2 or 20% of the amount due for those like, you know, 1800 blocks, and then 0.5
00:22:09.610 - 00:22:16.974, Speaker A: because this is 50% of the inflation that delegators. 50% of the amount he also had for staking.
00:22:17.054 - 00:22:17.630, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:17.782 - 00:22:56.154, Speaker A: And then delegators basically get 50% for the amount due for those 1800 blocks times the stake they had. Right. So if they have, for example, 20% of the collateral stake, they'll earn a lot more rewards. So I have some staking resources, some information, how to stake, and more information you can find in these three websites. So basically this DAP is the one that the moving foundation basically is sponsored for staking on the network. And then you have a couple of dashboards that helps you a little bit, interacting with staking or getting more information around staking. So basically this is the DAP.
00:22:56.154 - 00:23:25.984, Speaker A: This is for sure in our testnet, Moonbase Alpha. But you can see Moonriver and Moonbeam here and you can see there's a lot of information around crowd loans, cross chain assets. So this is part of the interoperability. This is not yet enabled in Moonbeam. And down here you have the part of staking where you can manage your delegations and then you can, for example, delegate a collator or manage your active delegation. Down here we also have some tutorials on the dashboard website. You have some tutorials on how to stake.
00:23:25.984 - 00:23:53.500, Speaker A: A couple more interesting resources is the web three go dashboard where you can see all the different collators or block producers and you can see some stats around them. For example, some aprs. So minimum bonds, average blocks, they produce current blocks and so on. So there's, there's a lot of information to go through here. You have some of the bitcoin suites, collaters. So there's a lot of information here that you can check out to, to, to start delegating. Last but not least, we have a similar one.
00:23:53.500 - 00:24:24.290, Speaker A: This was created by a collator actually, who is also part of the community. And you have here also some other stats similar to the other one, but, you know, a different interface basically. So, yeah, I think with that, I basically finished my presentation. You know, you can contact us through our website. We also, you know, you have a telegram group, you also have Twitter handles and discord. If you're a developer that wants to start developing, we're very active on Discord for that. Yeah.
00:24:24.290 - 00:24:27.894, Speaker A: Thanks, Ian, for inviting me and I'm open to answer any questions that you have.
00:24:31.854 - 00:25:03.018, Speaker B: Super Alberto, that's been a really great deep dive into moonbeam. Super well done. I think that's covered a lot of topics. I'm sure the audience will also have some questions to throw in just now, but to get started, I'd like to throw one or two questions your way, which were already collected before. As mentioned. As we know, Polkadot has really grown a lot. The ecosystem has taken off in the last year and a half, two years.
00:25:03.018 - 00:25:24.542, Speaker B: So a lot of projects building on the network, a lot of innovation happening. One project that already launched on Polkadot is Acala. And maybe you could give us one or two points, just compare and contrast how moonbeam and Acala compare, if that is possible, from your side.
00:25:24.638 - 00:25:37.494, Speaker A: Yeah, no problem. And that's not the first time I've heard that question. It's quite, quite common. Right. How do we compare to others? And I would say, I think I don't want to speak on behalf of the Acala team. We respect them quite a bit. They're an amazing team.
00:25:37.494 - 00:26:31.858, Speaker A: So I will say what do we offer as a parachain? Right, so basically we are a platform for projects to build on top of. We provide basically a unique Ethereum compatibility features. We have the unified accounts thing that I mentioned before, meaning that we only use the Ethereum account system while for example Acala, like I said, without speaking for them on behalf of them, because I'm 100% familiar with the technology stack that they offer, but they are a defi hub. They want to be a Dex for the Polkadot ecosystem even though they are EVM compatible. We're just a platform for projects to build on top of. Right? So I would say those are the two main differences, being that Acala has offerings, has tech offerings like their Dex, their stablecoin. But us, we don't have any offerings as adapt.
00:26:31.858 - 00:27:03.054, Speaker A: We offer a platform for developers to build on top of. So I would say that it's the main difference. And we have also pushed quite a bit on the Ethereum compatibility side. So we have developed certain technology stacks to make sure that we're as Ethereum compatible as possible from actually feedback that we've gotten from projects. So we wanted to have like the graph support and ether scan, they needed features that we develop ourselves. Right. And so that is part of our push to be, you know, Ethereum compatible 100%.
00:27:03.054 - 00:27:03.754, Speaker A: So.
00:27:05.534 - 00:27:26.986, Speaker B: Okay, okay, makes sense. Just on that topic. I mean, with, with the focus on Ethereum compatibility, does that mean you from a developer side are really targeting current Ethereum developers, getting them in, teaching them, doing workshops or hackathons or things like that. What's going on in this set of things?
00:27:27.170 - 00:28:03.560, Speaker A: Yeah, you're 100% on point. So we are targeting Ethereum developers mostly. Well, I mean, I would say we are targeting two serve developers, new developers. I just want to start building, right. Because they have no clue about what technology stack to use or anything, but also Ethereum developers. So a lot of our projects that have deployed on Moonbeam or Moonriver early on, they're the Ethereum developers that have for other projects or have built native projects from scratch. That's why you see a lot of familiar names on Moonbeam, like the graph you've seen, Chainlink, you've seen uniswap v two forks.
00:28:03.560 - 00:28:25.172, Speaker A: You have also seen Moonwell, which is a banki fork, which is based on compound. You have seen curve, Sushiswap. So a lot of the names are familiar in the Ethereum ecosystem. You see them here on Moonbeam. And right now we have supported a lot of hackathons. We were in east Denver, which is one of the biggest Ethereum conferences in the world. We supported a hackathon there.
00:28:25.172 - 00:28:55.124, Speaker A: We're actually launching quite soon with Dora hacks, one of our first self hosted hackathons. And it's mostly focused on two things. Building on top of our EVM or build features, substrate with like around substrate features, such as interoperability, governance, staking, which are not native ethereum things. Right. So this is part of our technology stack, where I presented, where we have the best of the EVM world, but also part of the substrate world, which is those features that are not native from the EVM. So.
00:28:56.924 - 00:29:13.984, Speaker B: Okay, makes sense. Another question which we had already, just regarding the growth of moonbeam. How scalable is it? How can you measure that? Are you looking to scale more? What is the outlook on that side of things?
00:29:14.524 - 00:29:56.154, Speaker A: Yeah, that's another good question that we've heard quite a bit. Right. I mean, we, right now, the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems are very, very young. I mean, even though Polkadot has been around for a while, like I said before, Polkadot does not offer any end user features more than staking and governance. So this is actually the first time that Polkadot or Kusama have been stressed in terms of performance. And actually, fun story is that Moonriver was actually basically being limited by Kusama at a certain point to go back to scalability. There's actually quite a few things that we've actually thought about already in terms of scalability.
00:29:56.154 - 00:30:21.968, Speaker A: If you're familiar with Moon Mimmer, Moon river, we have basically 12 seconds block time right now. We hope in the future to go down to six second block times, but right now, we have 12 seconds block times. And out of those 12 seconds, we're executing everything around the EVM in 300 milliseconds. So that is quite, quite less than 10%. It's not even. It's quite less than 10%. It's not even 5%.
00:30:21.968 - 00:31:09.404, Speaker A: So out of all those 12 seconds, we're actually executing all the transactions in less than 300 milliseconds. So that time, we can easily expect that time to quadruple. So that means that we should be able to four times increase the transaction throughput with just basically quite easily code implementations that will come from parity actually. So we're helping parity help us basically become more scalable. Besides that, there's another very interesting concept that we've played around in terms of parachains, like Moonbeam being the relay chain of other parachains that will go below moonbeam. So this is sort of like an l two approach, let's say. But it is sort of like using the same tech stack.
00:31:09.404 - 00:31:52.974, Speaker A: So it'll be like a sub chain sidechain, however you want to call it. But it will be like this will actually make moonbeam as scalable as you want because you can have x amount of subchains. So depending on the scalability that you want, I mean, for sure, like ethereum l two s where l two s have like different, basically, how do you say it, compromises, right? I mean there's not like the best of everything. So you can have different compromises where, okay, like if you're a game, for example, which needs very, very fast transaction times, but you can basically get finality. You can expect finality to be in around 1 minute. You can go to a side chain. Well, you have very fast block times, but the security guarantees are a little bit less on the moving chain as a whole.
00:31:52.974 - 00:32:04.220, Speaker A: There are different concepts that we've toyed around with and we're actually looking into scalability right now, even though we're not being limited right now in moonbeam in terms of transaction throughput.
00:32:04.252 - 00:32:04.444, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:04.484 - 00:32:17.024, Speaker A: But since day one, we understand this is a very big concern because, you know, we are, we expect a lot of like more transactions to come in the near future. And so, you know, scalability is always a point of concern for sure.
00:32:18.124 - 00:32:45.744, Speaker B: Okay, let's, let's jump over a little bit to the side. We have one question regarding oracles. Many defi protocols use chain link or oracles. And Chainlink has been live on Moonbeam Alpha and Moon river for some time. Why not on moonbeam itself? Is there a timeline on that? What's going on there?
00:32:46.124 - 00:33:12.064, Speaker A: That's, that's a great question. And you know, I wish I could answer you like, oh, it's because of this. It's basically on their, on their side of the court right now. So we, we launched chainlink on Moonbase Alpha, basically ourselves. So it was just like to show once again how ethereum compatible we were. We deployed the chainlink tech stack and notes and everything. And then the Chainlink team deployed on Moonbase Alpha, but also deployed on Moon river.
00:33:12.064 - 00:33:39.804, Speaker A: And that has been live for a while now. But like you said, Ian, I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but a lot of projects depend on Chainlink. So basically, lending protocols depend on chain link. And I think it's because you're like the best in the game, right, of Oracle games. So we expect hopefully to have a Chainlink deployment very, very soon. I would probably say hopefully by April, but I don't want to shoot myself on the foot. But it's basically on their side of the court.
00:33:39.804 - 00:33:51.644, Speaker A: We hope to have this chain link deployment soon. And there's actually a lot of projects depending on a chain link deployment to go live on move. But, yeah, it's definitely a blocker for a lot of projects.
00:33:54.444 - 00:34:25.344, Speaker B: And just coming back to the, to the entire collater, collator topic, we had one question and then we have one in the chat, actually. Great to see the current setup with, like, community collaters. Why was this particularly chosen? And, like, how does this play into certain, quote unquote whales who might be operating in the space or coming into the protocol? How does this work?
00:34:26.204 - 00:35:32.590, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. And so the idea is that the Mumin foundation, which is basically the foundation that it is looking out of the network in the rollout process or through the decentralization process. It was really important for us and for the foundation to make sure that the block production mechanism is as centralized as possible. Decentralization is a key feature on all of this because there is no single point of reliance. If you have a big whale controlling 50% of the network, it is really hard for them. They can be malicious, but it's not 50% on Ethereum, because remember that in the Polkadot grand scheme of things, the pair, that relay chain is the one that verifies the blocks, right? So let's say, you know, a collateral can produce a malicious block saying, I now have 100 million glimmer, or whatever. But then when the relay chain and Polkadot's basically economic model, which, which basically supports the validators, right, make sure that the validators are not being malicious.
00:35:32.590 - 00:36:26.884, Speaker A: You know, when the relay chain validators are going to check the block are going to see that this block is malicious issues. The main problem about centralization on moonbeam is terms of censorship, terms of block production, even though if they control quite a bit of a large part of the network, they can censor transactions or they can just don't produce a block because they don't want to. And so that will tamper network stability. So for us the Moving foundation supported a program on moon based alpha to make sure that the Moomin collaters were as performant as possible, but also as decentralized as possible to make sure that there's no single point of failure. So that is part of the collateral community guidelines where we actually foundation basically set out to say we won't support any more than four collaterals being run by a single entity. And I would say the main, main idea behind this is decentralization to prevent single points of failure.
00:36:28.264 - 00:36:52.594, Speaker B: Okay, makes sense. Let's jump to the question that we just had in the chat with regards to roll ups on moonbeam. Would this be possible and would it actually make sense? Or is it just actually breaking the benefits of being part of the entire interoperable Polkadane polka chain Polkadot blockchain ecosystem?
00:36:53.294 - 00:37:38.982, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's a very good question. And so basically for a scalability solution, you can do roll ups. That's basically, you can do it on Moonbeam because like I said, we're fully ethereum compatible. So any roll up solution we'll probably have to check from a text perspective if our EVM and web three implementation supports roll up, but it should be doable for scalability purposes. And I don't think that really breaks benefits with being part of the Polkadot ecosystem. So I would say that one thing is being part of the Polkadot ecosystem and the other thing is scalability from mu means perspective. Like I said before, we've toyed around with the ideas of having roll ups and l two solutions for specific purposes within the moomium ecosystem.
00:37:38.982 - 00:38:05.814, Speaker A: But the thing is, now that if you want to interoperate, we still not sure how that it's going to work for interoperability purposes. So if you're an application that are looking for performance, for example, you might jump into this l two solution being a role, a sub chain or whatever. But, but you know, you might be, you know, you might have certain like uh, you know, compromises you have to do because you know, you won't be on the main moving parachute.
00:38:05.854 - 00:38:06.222, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:06.318 - 00:38:19.394, Speaker A: We're still exploring quite a bit of these ideas. So we're still like, you know, doing a lot of research and we're not sure how it's going to play it out, but it's definitely something that, it's interesting from, from the terms of like in like scalability, for sure.
00:38:21.094 - 00:38:30.794, Speaker B: Another great question in the chat just now, how can Polkadot validators understand EVM transactions and actually validate them? How does that work?
00:38:31.134 - 00:39:08.396, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good question as well. And the thing is that Polkadot validators don't really, like, validate transactions. I mean, they validate the state transition. Right. The state transition is that in block n you had, I don't know, Alberto had standard amount of tokens and En had a certain amount of tokens. And then let's say I send you ten tokens, en, and then the next state transition is that you had certain amount plus ten, and I had a certain amount minus ten. So basically, validators, what they check is the state transition from one block to the next one.
00:39:08.396 - 00:39:47.004, Speaker A: And basically, if you think about it, EVM transactions are just state transitions that are done through the EVM. So using the ethereum technology, basically the EVM technology, to perform a state transition. So if a state transition is a swap in a Dex, that is going to change some storage elements, and basically the validators are going to check that those storage changes, let's say, are valid. And that's it. So basically, the Polkadot validators check what it's called prove or state transition changes. But the EVM is just like an added layer of how you can do a state transition, basically.
00:39:48.464 - 00:40:16.400, Speaker B: Okay. And we're just getting close to the end of our session today, but I have one more question, or kind of combined question from people who submitted questions before. Looking forward. Moonbeam is growing. Adoption is happening. Adoption on Polkadot, adoption on moonbeam. But there are other networks that are also growing quite a bit.
00:40:16.400 - 00:40:48.964, Speaker B: For instance, Solana Ethereum continues to grow quite a bit. And this question about really being careful when it comes to being risk averse with the testnets and so on and so forth, and then main debt development, do you think this is actually hindering Polkadot or the Moonbeam network? Are others going to take off and grow faster? Or how is moonbeam actually planning to grow and expand in the near future?
00:40:49.784 - 00:41:10.108, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good question. And I think it's a very hard line to draw. How fast do you move, but how stable you want to be? So we've seen networks, like you mentioned, Solana had had a lot of issues with network stability and so on. And so there's always this question of, like, where do you draw the line?
00:41:10.156 - 00:41:10.364, Speaker B: Right?
00:41:10.404 - 00:41:23.036, Speaker A: So we have a lot of internal networks, right? I mean, you only know three, right? You only know Moonbase alpha, Moonriver and Moonbeam. But we have, I would say probably around ten internal networks or something to test stuff around.
00:41:23.100 - 00:41:23.324, Speaker B: Right?
00:41:23.364 - 00:41:55.730, Speaker A: So if you think that that setup actually slows us down, you have to check, like, how fast. We've moved with Moonriver and with Moomin. It has been crazy. We have had, like, numerous runtime upgrades on Moon river, numerous clan upgrades on Moon river, and that all, like, will translate to moomim at a slower pace because, you know, moonbeam is the more, like, stable network where, like, you know, Moonriver is running the state of the art, let's say, on production on Mainnet. But then Moomim is going to run, you know, battle tested code.
00:41:55.762 - 00:41:55.954, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:55.994 - 00:42:18.920, Speaker A: So that's why you saw, for example, EIP 1559 coming to mid river first and then Moonbeam. Yeah, definitely. It slows us down a bit. And I'm error quoting because like I said before, what it is that really slow? I mean, it has been crazy, the amount of upgrades and features that we brought to the network just two months after launching. Right. And that's going to be. It's going to keep happening.
00:42:18.920 - 00:42:44.014, Speaker A: I think this year is going to be the year of interoperability. So we're pushing really hard around interoperability. But I also think that this approach allows us to test things and make sure that only things that have battle tested end up on moving. So it's a very, very hard line to draw. But I think we're doing a really good job of making sure that the network is stable as we bring a lot of features to it.
00:42:46.114 - 00:43:11.782, Speaker B: Okay with that. Alberto, thank you so much for joining us today. Thanks for the deep dive and answering all the tough questions. You've done a great job. Super. And also thanks to the team behind you because I know they did some work to help prepare you for the tough questions today. And we very much look forward to seeing your development and all the things going on.
00:43:11.782 - 00:43:29.876, Speaker B: We at Bitcoin Swiss, I think, also are helping to support the network with our offering for staking and love to keep in touch with you and the team. So that's great and look forward to many more things coming from your side very soon. Thanks a lot.
00:43:30.060 - 00:43:37.884, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you very much, Ian, for the invitation and always happy to participate in any other presentation you need me to. So thanks a lot. Definitely.
