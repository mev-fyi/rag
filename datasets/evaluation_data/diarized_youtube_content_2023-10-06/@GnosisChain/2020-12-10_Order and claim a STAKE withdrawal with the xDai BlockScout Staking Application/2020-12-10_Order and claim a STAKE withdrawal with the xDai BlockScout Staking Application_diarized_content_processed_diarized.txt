00:00:04.010 - 00:00:30.942, Speaker A: Let's take a look at the withdrawal order and claim process. A withdrawal can be ordered while stake is active in a staking epic. A claim is ordered during the epic, then the claim is collected. Once the epic is complete, I'm in a test environment. To get to the application. I'll go to blockscout and select an item from the stakes menu in the validators tab. I can see I'm currently delegating on this validator pool.
00:00:30.942 - 00:01:04.966, Speaker A: The Me flag shows my address as a delegator. I'm also delegating on a second pool. I'll close out this modal and start the withdrawal claim process. I click on the withdraw button and can see the amount available to order. Keep in mind that to remain a delegator, I need to maintain the minimum 1000 stake so I can withdraw up to 700 in this case if I want to continue as a delegator. If I wanted to exit from the pool, I could withdraw the full 1700 stake and I'd be removed from the pool. At the end of the epic I'll take out 500.
00:01:04.966 - 00:01:41.786, Speaker A: I click, order withdrawal and confirm in Metamask the transaction is successful and now I'll need to wait until the end of the epic. In the test environment, this happens quickly in production. A staking epic takes one week. I'm speeding things up to get to the end of the epic. We'll see the icons disappear towards the last few blocks where all actions are disallowed. Once a new epic starts, the icons reappear and we see a new icon for claiming our withdrawal. The interface here is super simple.
00:01:41.786 - 00:01:54.090, Speaker A: We just click to claim the amount and confirm the transaction of Metamask. Once it goes through, we'll see our wallet balance increase to reflect the withdrawal claim.
