00:00:00.440 - 00:00:32.704, Speaker A: Welcome to the gnosis Lisbon Meetup. We are back in town, as you can see. Please make silence while the present, while the presentations are going on. The last two meetups, we were having them in London and afterwards in Berlin, so we were out of town for a few months. Yeah. And now we are welcoming our first guest and presenter. His name is Diogo Almeida.
00:00:32.704 - 00:00:54.944, Speaker A: He's representing light shift capital. He's also one of the heads behind it Lisbon since the first edition. So please, a round of applause for Diogo and he will be telling us more about Ethereum gas derivates. Thank you so much.
00:00:55.104 - 00:01:35.934, Speaker B: Hi everyone. Thanks for coming. Today I'm going to talk a little bit more about Ethereum gas derivatives and why I think they are important for the ecosystem. And so Ethereum gas prices are always spiking. They are very volatile. Since Ethereum existed, basically, we can actually see this on the, the last 14 days of Ethereum gas prices, there's huge spikes in volatility on daily prices and so this is very bad for ux. Users never know how much they're going to have to pay for a transaction.
00:01:35.934 - 00:02:30.882, Speaker B: They are paying for a service that costs x one day and then two x the other day and three x a day after. So it's very hard to estimate these costs. That's why I think Ethereum gas derivatives are needed because I think they can help applications hedge Ethereum gas costs and also create a better ux for users. So today I want to raise a little bit more awareness to this solution and also highlight some of the issues that have been happening around this area. About myself, hes Karwina said, I am part of white shift Capital. I also organized Lisbon for a few years now and my background is in engineering. Very briefly, about Redshift, we are an admin stage fund, but in Portugal we invest in crypto companies and we like to be very involved and help them build with our team of engineers as well.
00:02:30.882 - 00:03:47.692, Speaker B: And so touching on the point. And before explaining what gas derivatives and how they can actually help us hedge Ethereum gas, maybe just giving a quick background on hedging and what it is like. We all here are crypto guys, right? And guys and girls, and we want to go to Defcon, to Taiwan for DeF Con in six months. And being like responsible adults, we cannot buy the ticket now because we can have a cheaper price, right? However, let's say that in four months the road is crazy, there's a new war coming out and the price of oil spikes, right? However, you already bought your ticket, right? The airline wasn't expecting this. They already made their calculations on how much they're going to have to spend on a trip, and they already sold you the ticket. But now the price of oil went up massively, and so they have a few options, right? They either charge you more for the ticket, which you're not going to do it, you're not going to pay more for a ticket that you already bought, or they can lose money because their margins are so small that a 20% price increase is going to make them lose money, or they can actually not make the trip happen. They say, oh, I simply cannot do it, it's too expensive.
00:03:47.692 - 00:04:23.276, Speaker B: You have to stay in Lisbon. And that's why they hedge their positions. They use financial markets to hedge it. And how they do it is basically there's two sides of the market. On one side, there's the consumers of this product of oil, which are the airlines, in this case, on either side, you have the producers. So like Saudi, Aramco, BP, and all of the deal producers, right? And then in the middle, there's a middleman that hedges it out of both sides. So the consumers, they bet on the price of oil going up and the producers bet on the price of oil going down.
00:04:23.276 - 00:05:07.122, Speaker B: And why is that? Because if the price of oil ends up going up, the airlines, the consumers, they're going to have, they're going to have a higher expense on oil, but they're also earning more money because of the bet they made. Right? So they are spending more on oil, but they are making more money on the financial markets because of the bet. And so these averages out and they end up, like, in theory, not losing money. Right. I'm oversimplifying things just to make a point. And then on the other side, if the price of oil goes down, the producers are going to make less money because they are literally getting paid less for the product that they are selling. But they are also earning more money on the financial markets because they have a short position.
00:05:07.122 - 00:05:33.150, Speaker B: They are betting that the price is going down. And so this averages out. And that's basically how hedging works. Again, very simplified. And why should you care about all of this? Because Ethereum gas functions just as oil. In the real world, if you want to do something productive, you have to pay for energy. If you want to produce a new brand of coding, you have to pay for the energy.
00:05:33.150 - 00:06:34.212, Speaker B: And that's mainly done through oil. In Ethereum on chain, if you want to make something productive on chain, you have to pay for the computation. And that's done through gas. That's why I think that these derivatives are so important. If you look into the numbers on the last 90 days, the price of oil only changed 20%. So it was at 77 and now it was at like 91 and then back to 80. This is like a 20% change and it's like three millions of dollars used to edge just 20% change, right? But then like you look into the price of ethereum, it went four x, right? It was at 20, then 80 and now, like it's back at 15, right? And so like if we are spending trillions to hedge like a 20% change, like hedging this forex increase should be worth something, right? We should be able to do it and it's worth doing it, right? And so why is this important now? Right? I think it was always important, but now it's becoming feasible to do it.
00:06:34.212 - 00:07:25.774, Speaker B: And I think it's one of the most important next steps to make ux improve. And the reason is like we want to pretty much like abstract like blockchain away from for users. We don't want users to know that they are actually interacting with blockchain or if they want to know, they can, but they don't have to know what's gas, what's a wallet, everything should be abstracted. But the issue is that for you to do that, you have to abstract gas payments away. Things like account obstruction with paymasters and similar entities are going towards that route where applications are trying to abstract the payments away and do the gas payments on their side. And also l two s are spending millions on gas. Even with blobs, it's still a big cost for them.
00:07:25.774 - 00:08:26.112, Speaker B: It's still one of the biggest costs for them. And so how can applications actually handle this volatility? They can keep things as they are, they keep gas separated and the user pays for gas on their side. So they say my service costs x and then gas is like something else that you have to pay for, right? They can abstract the gas away where the user pays in USDC and then they use that USDC to pay for it. But they can still pass the cost to the user where from day to day the price of the product changes in resty systems just to reflect that increase in gas costs. This is like every day you go to buy a product and every day the price changes again. It's better, but it's still not a great ux. They can reduce their margins, aka they can take the hit themselves, but it's not great because they are doing less profit every time that the gas goes up.
00:08:26.112 - 00:08:47.564, Speaker B: This is terrible for treasury management and they're never going to do it. There are companies that have to make money. This is never going to happen. And the second thing is they can wait, aka trust me, right? Which is like they just wait for the gas to come down. It can take one day, two days, you don't know. You have to wait for it to be settled on chain. I don't think this is a great experience as well.
00:08:47.564 - 00:09:45.016, Speaker B: And it certainly doesn't go with the blockchain ethos. And so there's another solution, which is like doing gas derivatives and using that to edge Ethereum gas prices, right? And so what are the characteristics of Ethereum gas and why nobody has done this before. And the reason is like Ethereum gas is structured in two things, right? You have the tip and you have the base fee. And because of this, like, there's no natural short side for this market, right? There's no producer that can take the short side. If we go back to the airlines, the oil producers were taking the short, right? They were betting against the price of oil. In this case, there's no short side, right? And like, why aren't builders and validators? The short side is because like the base fee is burned, they don't have any access to the base fee, right? They're not the ones selling the base fee and they're not the ones like making more profit because of the base fee. They only set the tip.
00:09:45.016 - 00:10:38.790, Speaker B: And the thing is like, the tip is not a problem, right? If you look at here, this is the tip and this is the base fee. The base fee is the biggest productivity issue and it's the biggest problem in terms of productivity. And so if the builders and the valve letters can't be the ones taking the short sides, you have to have someone doing it and you have basically to depend on speculators and agents being the ones willing to take this risk and to edge and to take the short side. And so many people think that valves can solve this, and I think they are a good improvement. But the market dynamics involves, are the same as in blogspace, right? Like there was use volatility for a time period in blobs. And even if things have cooled down now, the market dynamics are the same. So eventually, once valves become more saturated, the same thing is going to happen with valves.
00:10:38.790 - 00:11:37.252, Speaker B: That has been happening with blogspace. And so what are the potential solutions? I don't think there's any of them is perfect. I've been seeing some options and I just want to highlight some of them. So one is just like kind of trying to do like physically delivered futures where like you have an order book and a builder says, sorry, a consumer says, I want to pay like x amount of gas for three transactions two days from now. And then someone on the side says okay, I can take that price. But then because the builders and the competitors don't have access to the base fee, you can actually like, you're not edging, sorry, you're not edging the Bayes fee and you need to control a big percentage of the network to actually ensure that these transactions are being fulfilled. And again, this is going to cause huge centralization and it's really, I don't think it's going to be the solution.
00:11:37.252 - 00:12:30.764, Speaker B: So you can take the same order book, but we like cash settled, where instead of on the other side someone saying, oh, I'm going to submit your transactions, you just have someone, a speculator, a market maker, whatever you want to call it that says okay, I can take your bet and in two days I'm going to pay for your transactions. But this guy is taking all the risk, right? If in today's the price goes three times instead of two times, he's going to have to be the one paying for that, right? And so he's taking all the risk by himself. And you can actually, you can guarantee inclusion because if the market maker says, oh, this is like too expensive for me to pay. You already paid him, but there's no way for you to enforce him including your transactions. Right. And because it's an order book is actually extremely hard to bootstrap all of this liquidity, right. Because every single person has different needs of transactions and of gas.
00:12:30.764 - 00:13:05.934, Speaker B: And so you always have to find a counterparty willing to take that. And so there's also people trying to do like CDP's or insurance pools. But the thing here is that you kind of create a base token, a token that tracks the base fee with characterized by an LSD and you do an Amm for price discovery. But this is very capital inefficient because of characterization ratios. And it doesn't solve the underlying problem where DLP is off the pool. They're also taking the risk all by themselves. They have no way of hedging this.
00:13:05.934 - 00:13:35.948, Speaker B: They're just saying, ok, I don't care. I think it's going to come down, I'm going to bet on it and if it goes up I get wrecked. If it doesn't, I make money. And so again, all of these products are dependent on speculators to take the short side, because there's no natural short side. And the issue with this is that for speculators to actually be willing to take the short side, you have to make it worth their while. So we have to make the yield on the short side very interesting. And this makes the hedging itself very expensive.
00:13:35.948 - 00:14:40.474, Speaker B: And that's why, one of the reasons why this wasn't done before, because it was too expensive for people to hedge and it was not used enough for speculators to bet on it. And so besides creating the actual derivatives, there's a further problem, which is now that you have it, how are we actually making Dapps use this? Because apps, they shouldn't have to, needs an in house trader to like buy and sell perpetuals on gas. And all of these, like, it's simply too, too hard, too complicated and too risky, right? And you actually like having a broker is too terrifying. We also don't want this guy like being the one like hedging our guest positions, right? And so you need to have like a protocol in the middle that hacks as kind of like a broker of some sort. And he's the one putting the positions and he's the one actually creating the, the edges in an automated fashion. So this can look like a lot of different things. But my point is that besides creating the derivatives, you also have to find a way to actually build the products with it and sell it to dapps.
00:14:40.474 - 00:15:41.908, Speaker B: And for me in the future, the perfecting is sending that hedges everything. So you as optimism or you as uniswap, you can hedge your base fee, you can hedge the eat price, because if users are paying in USDC, you have to edge for the price of it because it's also very volatile, right? And then you can also use something like pre conformations to edge the tip. And so you are fully edged in terms of gas costs. This is like a complex product, but I think that broker can be the one building it. And I also think this is not only a ethereum problem, right? Because gas fees on L two s, they suffer from the same market dynamics, right? Once op blocks start to get full, the price starts to going up. And so the apps on L two s have the same issue and the users on L two s have the same issue, the same with deep ins. So if a cache costs of GPU's are dependent on market demand, you never know how much it's going to cost you to run an Am model every day.
00:15:41.908 - 00:16:25.790, Speaker B: And if you have a service that relies on you running it every day, you can be spending different amounts every day. And so I'm not saying that gas derivatives are going to be the solution for everything, but this is a problem in every single one of these ecosystems. And even if gas derivatives are not the solution, something has to be done to solve this problem. And I don't know how Ethereum is going to evolve. I don't know if Vitavik is going to come with some proposal and some improvement for this and it's going to make derivatives not needed. But what I do know is that for now, I think derivatives can be a good short term solution. And even if they have a lot of problems, I think there's enough smart guys to try to solve them and to try to make this work.
00:16:25.790 - 00:16:28.674, Speaker B: So, yeah, thank you all for the time.
00:16:33.534 - 00:16:59.834, Speaker C: That was actually very interesting. I'm not deep into the topic, but it was really nice talk and it was a really good idea and good issue. But I had this question, like, you speak about the short side, that there's no natural party to take. Can you elaborate on like the contract solution, how that would be different or what you like? Is there then someone to take the short side or how would that work?
00:17:01.654 - 00:17:19.778, Speaker B: So you have like speculators or LP's that are willing to say, oh, I think the price of wheat is going to go down. So I'm willing to bet on that. And so if it goes up, I lose my money. If it goes down, I make that profit. Right. And then you also have to give them like a premium for them to take that risk. Right.
00:17:19.778 - 00:17:46.964, Speaker B: But that's why I was saying that, like, it becomes too expensive because that premium becomes so high for them to be willing to do it that they, it's like, it's too expensive to edge. Right. And then if you want to scale this up, right? If you don't want to just be a DJ, and if you want to be like a professional market maker doing this, you have to have like pretty good predictions of the price of it. And so, yeah, it becomes like really complex to do it as well.
00:17:52.344 - 00:18:47.292, Speaker D: Thank you. So my question is actually about do you just do it for ethgas also for overall application activity? Because from my understanding, if you have a DAP, well, you need to estimate what is going to be the price of gas, let's say. But also how many users will use your DAP? Because in the example of a plane, for example, well, you know how much gas you will need to be able to fly the plane. But for your dapp, well, you need to know how many customers multiplied by the price of gas you will need to spend. Right. And actually with the smart contract solution it seems that it is feasible. It will not be easy with like a synthetic of ethereum gas price, but with your solution that seems possible.
00:18:47.292 - 00:18:57.644, Speaker D: So is it something that you intend to do, like to allow people to describe any kind of activity, not just the Ethereum gas price or not?
00:19:01.504 - 00:19:44.852, Speaker B: Yeah, so first of all, I'm not building any solution, I'm just like, I'm just like presenting and doing some research on the topic and I'm not an expert at all, but answering your question, you are totally right. But what apps have to do is like so how I see airlines doing it is this is the maximum of weight I can have on my plane. So this is the maximum of oil I'm going to spend on this travel. The same for applications, this is the max amount of gas a user can spend on my application per whatever you want to do. If it's a swap, they spend x. If it's two swaps or whatever, they spend two x. So you have to calculate that.
00:19:44.852 - 00:20:06.824, Speaker B: But that's on the application side, the protocol doing the derivatives, they shouldn't care about that. That's like the broker job and the application job. Right? So like the protocol that says whatever you want to add, I'm here to do it. But like you have to be the one doing those estimations. And that's why I'm saying you need that broker because I don't think the application is going to have the skill to do that.
00:20:13.024 - 00:20:40.184, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a question. So you mentioned that like you will have a lot of the logic for the decision making is done on chain right through the smart contract that you mentioned that replaced like the traditional broker, etcetera. So I had the impression that this logic is actually pretty heavy usually. So how do you have any thoughts on this could work or it's just still open question?
00:20:43.084 - 00:21:23.374, Speaker B: Yeah, well I think that's like a bigger question than on this topic because it's all about how do you solve computation heavy things and put them on chain? There's a few solutions for that, but I don't know how is it going to be if it's off chain and then something you have a proving system on chain to prove it or it's done totally on chain, I don't know. But my point there was more to explain that, like simply having the derivatives, I don't think it's enough. You also have to have some party doing that computation if it's off chain or on chain, we can discuss it, but I didn't go that deep into that topic yet.
00:21:28.754 - 00:21:30.174, Speaker A: Can you come closer?
00:21:30.474 - 00:21:39.174, Speaker E: How do you compare approaches where you go directly to the builders and negotiate with them at fixed price versus the bureau?
00:21:43.114 - 00:22:04.828, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's the thing is, like, those builders aren't necessarily setting the base fee, right. They just set. They can, like, guarantee you a tip. But, like, if the base fee goes up, the builders themselves have to pay for it. Right? So, like, a builder can say, oh, I'm gonna, like, allow you to, like, pay for, like, 15 for a transaction. Right. But the builder only controls the tip.
00:22:04.828 - 00:22:27.030, Speaker B: If ethereum, then on the base fee level, if they say, oh, actually, like, so let's say the builder plans that, like, from the 1510 is base fee, and then five is steep. But then Ethereum says, oh, now the base fee is 15. The builder either doesn't make money or it has to come from their pocket. Right. So they're not the ones, like, setting the base fee. So they also have to take the risk on themselves. Right.
00:22:27.030 - 00:22:29.758, Speaker B: So they can do it, of course, but they can take the hedge.
00:22:29.806 - 00:22:31.822, Speaker E: Like, builders are more professional.
00:22:31.958 - 00:22:39.678, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. So you are saying it like, builders are the ones taking the hedge. Yeah, that's, that's possible. Yeah. But again, you are this.
00:22:39.678 - 00:22:55.424, Speaker B: You are centralizing it a lot because there's only three of them, but, yeah, yeah, but I agree that, like, in theory, builders could be the ones hedging it, and they. They are much better at doing it than anyone else. So. Yeah, I agree with that.
00:22:57.364 - 00:22:59.304, Speaker A: We have time for one more question.
00:23:03.324 - 00:23:04.064, Speaker B: Sure.
00:23:04.444 - 00:23:13.104, Speaker F: What's a blob like? Honestly, I understood. It's weird. I understand derivatives. I even understand derivatives on gas. But what's a blob?
00:23:16.344 - 00:23:41.952, Speaker B: Well, I don't know the formal definition, but it's like. So l two s only need to post transactions on chain, right? They don't need to, like. And so the bob is just like a separate entity of, like, instead of you having to, like, spend on gas cost, it's just like. Because you just have to put the data on chain. Bob is just that amount of data that you need to put. Right. And so it's a separate market.
00:23:41.952 - 00:23:50.944, Speaker B: So if you have to do computation, you pay walkspace. If you have to post data, you pay ball. I'm over with simplifying it, but that's my understanding.
00:23:54.644 - 00:23:58.164, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Amazing questions as well. Thank you, Diogo.
