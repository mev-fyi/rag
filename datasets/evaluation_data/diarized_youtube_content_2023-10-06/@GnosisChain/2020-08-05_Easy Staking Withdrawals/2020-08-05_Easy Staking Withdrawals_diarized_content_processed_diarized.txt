00:00:00.970 - 00:00:32.980, Speaker A: Let's have a look at the easy staking withdrawal process. We have two deposits and I'll demo both types of withdrawal. We click on details for the first deposit and schedule a zero fee withdrawal. First we need to request the withdrawal. We'll confirm this request in Metamask and can see the transaction is being processed. If we click here we can view the status in ether. Scan back in the UI we see that the transaction is mined.
00:00:32.980 - 00:01:14.560, Speaker A: We've approved the withdrawal and we'll need to wait for 12 hours to process it. We can now click back to see the deposit details and click back again to get to the home deposit screen. We can see that we have a pending withdrawal as well as a second deposit that's still staked. While we wait for the first one, let's go to the second deposit and make an instant withdrawal. We click on the box and enter the amount to withdraw. If you click Max, it will auto populate the max amount and you can choose to withdraw any amount up to the max. Now we confirm in Metamask and can view our pending transaction in Etherscan.
00:01:14.560 - 00:01:51.390, Speaker A: It looks like it's been mined. We press back and see that deposit is no longer in our list and the transaction is completed in ether skin. So let's fast forward now to check on our pending withdrawal. It's been over 12 hours and we're ready to withdraw our scheduled withdrawal. We click on the details and see that we have 8 hours left to withdraw. We can enter the max or a smaller portion to continue staking. I'll enter and withdraw for stake.
00:01:51.390 - 00:02:34.656, Speaker A: We confirm the transaction and see that it's pending in ether skin. This is taking a while too long for this demo, so I'm going to cut out some time here and up the gas price. We can now check the transaction to Metamask and link to the new hash where our transaction has already been processed. When we get back to the UI we see we're still staking one stake and if I refresh the browser I can see our new token balance in the wallet. The four stake has been returned. We've successfully processed the second withdrawal within the withdrawal window. It it's easy to withdraw.
00:02:34.656 - 00:02:42.290, Speaker A: You'll want to weigh gas fees and other considerations when thinking about the best time to withdraw or deposit more stake. Close.
