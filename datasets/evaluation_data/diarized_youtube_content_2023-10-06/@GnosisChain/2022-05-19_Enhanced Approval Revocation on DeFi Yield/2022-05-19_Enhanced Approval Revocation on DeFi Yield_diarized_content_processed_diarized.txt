00:00:08.340 - 00:00:40.070, Speaker A: Yeah. I wanted to add that you have mentioned order revoke tool. Right? So the order revoke tool just provide you the ability to revoke or update the allowance in some case. In our case, we are categorizing the smart contract risk. So there's a lot of back end identification process. So what does it mean? It means that you have approved someone's malicious smart contract. And we are going to inform you the other Revoke tool doesn't have this function as well.
00:00:40.070 - 00:01:04.980, Speaker A: Our tool is just like an enterprise grade, professional grade tool for revoke again. And the approval that you see in the website that we have now, we did it one year ago. It was really the first version. The. The new version that we're gonna have this month is gonna be ten x more advanced than that. So, yeah, it's. It's gonna be totally a game changer.
