00:00:04.010 - 00:00:38.726, Speaker A: Let's look at the stake withdrawal process. There are two types of withdrawals available in the staking application immediate withdrawals and ordered withdrawals. Here, we'll focus on immediate withdrawals. When you place stake on a pool, you can always withdraw it during the same staking epic when you placed it. If you wait until the next epic and your stake becomes active, you'll need to order a withdrawal. Otherwise, if it doesn't become active because either the candidate you staked on does not become a validator, or because you staked on an inactive pool, you can withdraw the stake immediately. I'll show you how this works.
00:00:38.726 - 00:01:22.520, Speaker A: We're in a test environment. I click on the stakes menu in block scout to view the application. To start, I'm going to stake more on a validator pool I'm already delegating to. I click on the stake icon and can stake more in this modal I'll add an additional 300 stake and press the stake more button, then confirm the transaction in Metamask. Next, we can go to the withdraw icon and see that we have two options. Either order a withdrawal or withdraw an amount up to 300 stake. I'll withdraw 200 right now, press the withdrawal button and complete in Metamask.
00:01:22.520 - 00:01:54.572, Speaker A: As you can see, the 200 additional stake have been added to our address balance I want to look at the active pools tab in production. This shows all available candidate pools, including ones that are not current validators. I can also stake on these pools. However, in the test environment, both of these pools are validators, so there are not any additional active pools which are not currently validating. Let's look at the inactive pools. There is one available and it's not banned. I'm going to place some stake on this inactive pool.
00:01:54.572 - 00:02:40.942, Speaker A: Perhaps it will be activated by the validator and I can be a delegator in the next epic. I'll put in 1200 stake back on the validators tab. I still have 100 outstanding stake that I placed in this epic. It is currently available, but let's see what happens when the epic is overload. As we can see, the hundred is now active joining the 1200 I had previously staked. So now I'm delegating 1300 stake and if I wanted to get it back, I'd need to order a withdrawal and wait for the next epic. However, our inactive pool is still not a validator in this epic.
00:02:40.942 - 00:03:20.790, Speaker A: So the amount I placed during the last epic is still not active and should be available to withdraw immediately. I click on the withdraw button and see that the full amount is available to withdraw now. I can't leave less than 1000 in this pool. If I try to take out 300, the button stays grayed out. I can remove 200 and keep my delegation stake intact. I'll enter it in and process and I can see there are still 1000 stake left with this pool. If I want to exit, I can withdraw the full amount now we'll process this final transaction and see that I'm no longer a delegator on this inactive pool.
00:03:20.790 - 00:03:30.920, Speaker A: For more information on withdrawals, please see the website@xdichain.com you.
