00:00:03.370 - 00:00:38.700, Speaker A: Today we have Sonali from Defi yield. It's a Defi and crypto portfolio tracker, but I'm sure I'm selling it short. It's capable of doing many, many things, especially in a week like this with all the volatility, you surely need a good portfolio tracker. Sonali has head of communications at Defi Yield, and we also have t wells from one high tv to conduct the AMA with us today. So if the two of you want to just introduce yourselves and then t wells, you can just take it from there.
00:00:43.520 - 00:01:12.096, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Great to be here, Jim, everybody. It's the second installment, I guess, here of the gnosis chain show, and we're live here on Twitter spaces. If you also want to head over to gnosis chain, the channel on YouTube, we're also streaming live over there. We'll have some great on screen visuals. We'll also be posting some highlights of today's show there as well. So make sure to subscribe to gnosis chain YouTube.
00:01:12.096 - 00:01:18.668, Speaker B: But very happy to have Sonali with us from Defi yield today. How you doing? Sonali?
00:01:18.704 - 00:01:36.750, Speaker C: Gm awesome. Thanks so much for having me, guys. It's a pleasure to honestly be here and be able to just be a part of this AMA and connect with more of the gnosis community. So we're really happy about that.
00:01:40.000 - 00:01:52.050, Speaker B: Fantastic. Well, I'd love to just kick it off here and hear a little bit about you, Sonali, maybe the brief overview. What is your journey into crypto and how did you land with DFI yield before we get into the project?
00:01:52.980 - 00:02:49.056, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. Okay, well, a little bit about me. I got started in the crypto space around, like, 2017, and I think that's really when I started to really take a lot more notice of crypto. I just started learning about it, I think, honestly, just like anybody else, really just doing my own research and, yeah, I just started learning so much that I started getting really passionate and really fascinated, interested about the whole crypto space and bitcoin and blockchains that I started holding these educational workshops in Vancouver. So I'm from Vancouver, BC, Canada, and, yeah, so I would hold these educational workshops. I do like once a week. They were sort of like meetups, and it was great.
00:02:49.056 - 00:03:51.224, Speaker C: I just noticed that. I just realized there was a lot of people that were really interested in learning more about crypto, but a lot of people just were struggling to understand the basics in terms of where to buy it, how it works, who created it, and what exchanges can you use and how do you cash out, for example? So, yeah, I would do these workshops, we'd get like 50 to 60 people that would join these. And it was weekly even. I was shocked, honestly, by how many people would show up, and it was great. So after that, I ended up also hosting the very first blockchain yacht cruise event here in BC. And it's where I showcased different, say, companies and industries that were trending in the blockchain space. And so they were speakers, and, yeah, I hosted it on a nice boat that we took out, and that was a sold out event.
00:03:51.224 - 00:04:38.576, Speaker C: That was great. And then I got into doing some public speaking in 2018 and 19, and then after that, it was, I guess, crypto, winter and Covid until we all emerged. And you know what? How I got connected with Defi yield is I'm friends with one of the co founders, Michael Rosmere. And so, yeah, he reached out to me. I used to run a marketing agency, like, a few years ago, and so he was one of my clients. And so he reached out to me out of the blue, and he's like, hey, there's this position open. I think you'd be great for it.
00:04:38.576 - 00:05:16.610, Speaker C: What do you say? Are you open to connecting with the team? And I said, sure. I said, why did. And honestly, yeah, it's been great. I'm so glad that he reached out and I'm glad that connection was made. It's been a great experience working with the Defi team. It's honestly really incredible to see how passionate a lot of people on the team are about this project and also just about the Defi community in terms of really building it. So, yeah, it's been really great.
00:05:18.200 - 00:05:31.320, Speaker B: That's awesome. Well, I think that's a great segue to start chatting it up here. So what would you say here if somebody is just encountering the Defi yield project today for the first time? How would you describe it? In a nutshell?
00:05:32.380 - 00:06:34.648, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. So I would essentially say, for people that are just learning about Defi yield and are sort of new, I would say Defi yield is essentially a DeFi asset management dashboard. So it's a place where people can manage all of their Defi portfolios, everything from pools, vaults, staking, swapping, and also nfts. There's a lot of things that make Defi yield very unique, and I definitely have to express this. And it's like, one of the things that really make Defi yield the dashboard unique is the fact that it's the only dashboard right now that supports non EVM chains, because a lot of dashboards out there are EVM focused. Right. Because it seems like the one that's sort of like the most compatible and easy maybe to integrate.
00:06:34.648 - 00:07:22.248, Speaker C: But yeah, we're actually really proud and really excited to support and offer non EVM chains. So we currently are integrated with Solana, Terra, Cosmos and Cardano. And so all of the chains that are built on those, we support. Along with that, we also offer over 100 different yield farming protocols that are built across all of those chains. And that's really exciting. And we're also currently on track. We're on track because of a really unique and special technology that we have and have developed.
00:07:22.248 - 00:07:48.870, Speaker C: We're on track to onboard 800 yield farming protocols by the end of this year. So that would be something. Yeah, it's great. We're going to be offering a lot of different opportunities in the defi space to just the defi community, and we have a lot more things coming down the pipeline as well. So we're really excited about.
00:07:50.520 - 00:08:34.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I had a chance, obviously, to check out the app and I'm sharing on screen, folks. So if you want to, at some point, I'll remind you, if you want to click over to YouTube on gnosis chain, I'm going to do like a quick walkthrough of the app here, just so you can see. Andali just mentioned that you're first greeted with a list of different network options. And you can see right up in the front you have a number of these different integrations beyond EVM. So, as she said, solana terra Cardano Cosmos with the Kepler wallet one of the other things I think is really cool is that even if I click into EVM, you have this very large variety of wallets that can connect, including Nosisafe, which is really cool for DaO operators in.
00:08:36.500 - 00:09:24.748, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. And we're integrating more and more protocols every day. And so, yeah, that's why it's really important to us, and very valuable to us to work very closely with the blockchains that we have integrated so that we can start to get more of their yield forming protocols integrated into the blockchain so that we can start offering that to all of our users. And what's really great is sometimes you'll have users that maybe only are connected. Who knows? Maybe just EVM chains or. Sorry, just like maybe avalanche or polygon. And they may not be always aware of what protocols are offered on other chains.
00:09:24.748 - 00:09:54.350, Speaker C: And so what's nice about our dashboard is users will be able to see all of that in one screen. So when they click on more protocols, they're going to be able to see the various different protocols that are offered on each chain. So it's kind of like a great way for us to just support each of the chains and for people just to be aware of those opportunities that they may not have been aware otherwise. So it's a great way to grow the community that way.
00:09:55.360 - 00:10:18.644, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I'm logged in now on screen, so I'm particularly interested to hear. I mean, right now it seems super relevant. The security and audit components of the dashboard, they're unique and they're really easy to use. I just think they're awesome. You want to speak a little bit to those?
00:10:18.842 - 00:11:45.196, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So that's actually another, I would say, key feature about defi yield is the security tools that we have available and that we're going to be offering users. Now, some of these tools are coming out, I would say, within this month and next month, so second quarter, but just to kind of share more about that, I would say we have three really key important security tools that we offer users. One of them is the defi yield shield, and that's a tool that's going to be released very soon. And the way that's going to work and for users is when users log in and they say, sorry, they connect their wallets, and then all of a sudden now they can see all the different accounts, so they can see their entire portfolio across various chains and across various protocols, and they'll be able to see that on one screen. What's going to happen is with the Defi yield shield, it's essentially going to be like the very first DeFi antivirus in the industry. I haven't seen anything like this out there right now, but, yeah, it's essentially going to be like the first DeFi, I guess you could say, like antivirus.
00:11:45.196 - 00:12:49.776, Speaker C: And the way it works is it's a tool that will automatically scan through a user's through all of their portfolio, so through all of their wallets and the smart contracts that are connected to that, and it'll be able to identify and give people an immediate risk analysis. It'll let people know whether that particular wallet smart contract is low risk, medium risk, or high risk. But it also gives, like, a lot more detail. I've seen other tools or something like that out there, but they're nowhere as advanced as what we're going to be releasing and putting out. So it'll also give detailed information, because sometimes people don't understand the average user. Not everybody has a really techie background. Sometimes the average user, they're just researching things on YouTube and reading articles.
00:12:49.776 - 00:13:32.000, Speaker C: But not everybody has a developer's background. So what we want to do is we want to be able to offer what an advanced user would usually have access to. So like a developer for example. And usually developers can kind of take a look at the code and smart contracts and understand what's a vulnerability or an issue, but the average user can't do that. So we want to be able to give that same access to the average user and that's how we're doing that. So we're letting them know specifically what's a concern or what's a risk in that particular smart check code. So maybe the token router isn't hard coded, or maybe there's a proxy issue, or maybe there's unlimited minting.
00:13:32.000 - 00:14:45.240, Speaker C: Maybe the smart contract hasn't been verified, for example. So there's a lot of different issues that our tool can catch it, actually, to be more specific in that it can catch, I believe, over 600 different vulnerabilities, sorry, different risks, so different threats, I guess you could say. And so when a particular risk or threat comes up, it'll identify that, tell the user exactly specifically what that threat is and then the user will have the opportunity. Everybody has a different risk profile for themselves. Some people like to play with risk more than others, but everyone will have the opportunity to revoke that smart contract if they wish to do that. So we're going to also have a revoke feature that's coming out around the same time. And so if something's getting like code red, high risk, red flagged, a user will be able to revoke that smart contract, which essentially means they'll be able to disconnect their wallet from that smart contract so that protocol no longer has access to their tokens.
00:14:45.240 - 00:15:31.640, Speaker C: And so that's just offering a lot more safety security tools for the user, which on a lot of platforms users don't often have that or know whether there is even a risk for that particular account, I guess you could say. So, yeah, that's actually one of the top tools that we're going to be offering. Another one is also the rect database. So we have a rec that's actually available right now. People can start using that and checking out for themselves. So we have an audit rec database. It's actually the largest rect audit database in the world right now.
00:15:31.640 - 00:16:05.928, Speaker C: We have over 5000 audits on various different yield farming protocols and just different protocols actually in general. So a person can type in the name, the token, the ESN and be able to pull up various audits on various protocols. So a lot of these are also done manually. Maybe one day in the future we'll find a way. Actually, sorry, actually, sorry. That's what our defi yield shield does. But yeah, a lot of these are done manually, so they're in depth audits.
00:16:05.928 - 00:16:53.324, Speaker C: So it'll let a user know whether there's been anywhere between zero to two to three or more issues that were found. It'll let them know whether it's been a minimal medium or a major issue, and whether it's also been resolved as well. But a lot of these audits often have to get updated because an audit is only as good as up to the date that it was done. And of course there's always more developments that are occurring on these different protocols with their smart contracts. So that's the second security tool feature that we offer. Just the average user, anyone can use it. And I would say the third one is our smart scanner.
00:16:53.324 - 00:17:58.048, Speaker C: The smart scanner is, I would say, more of an advanced tool. It will be available through our defi, through the dashboard. But the smart scanner, I would say, would be more geared to say developers, blockchains and the protocols themselves. And the way that works is blockchains, protocols, or developers will be able to essentially run their smart contract through the scanner. And the scanner will provide them with a much more detailed, in depth overview of if there's any vulnerabilities. So it'll go through an analysis, different social elements, it'll even offer very suggestions on how to fix or correct some of these risks and issues. But yeah, this is actually a great tool and I would say API for blockchains and protocols to use because they can integrate a tool like this onto their dashboard and just be able to scan through a lot of these smart contracts.
00:17:58.048 - 00:18:15.550, Speaker C: And if there is any vulnerabilities or issues that come up, it's a great opportunity for blockchains and protocols to jump on that right away. So that way they can just offer a more transparent, of course, and safer space for the community.
00:18:18.160 - 00:19:02.952, Speaker B: I think safety is the name of the game now, particularly in light of recent events. Tools like you all have here, I think are a big deal. Not only the people who are already in the industry, or just general users in crypto, but it's a compelling tool to onboard new people who may have these. They know enough about smart contract risk that they don't have much interest, but a tool that enables them to sort of pre screen projects that they might be interested in. Yeah, this is really cool stuff. I guess the combination, is it the sort of the audit and other components that you're building? I want to make sure because I'm looking at the UI to make sure I know the right feature. Right.
00:19:02.952 - 00:19:07.710, Speaker B: So the scanner is different from the shield that you're referring to, is that correct?
00:19:08.560 - 00:19:09.756, Speaker C: That's correct, yeah.
00:19:09.858 - 00:19:16.930, Speaker B: Okay. All right. So the shield is not on the UI yet, but the scanner looks like you can sign up for early access if people are interested. Is that right?
00:19:17.460 - 00:19:34.400, Speaker C: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. So both of them are going to be released, I would say, within the month or next, so very soon. So we'll be coming out with some major announcements for that to keep people in the loop.
00:19:35.300 - 00:20:07.330, Speaker B: It's really cool. The approval revoke, the ability to revoke approvals is super important. And I think the combination that Defi yield provides as far as analysis of the approvals that you've given is perfect here, and it makes it much more accessible for people to sort of make those decisions. And FYI, folks, right, like, if you're not aware of approvals and how that can sort of get you wrecked, then I think that it's definitely worth doing some research on that. And it looks like Defi yield makes it easy to.
00:20:09.140 - 00:20:59.952, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And you know what, with Defi yield, in the past, especially with a lot of these audits, they've done various audits on different protocols. And in the past, they've flagged certain risks and things that are risky for the Defi community with some protocols that were found in some smart contracts and like Dow finance. Right, is an example. And so there's a lot of different protocols that say defi yield has informed, saying, hey, we noticed there's a particular potential risk here. And this is kind of what's going on. And there's been some protocols because we make this information public.
00:20:59.952 - 00:21:55.330, Speaker C: And so there's some protocols that have seen that and been like, okay, thank you very much for letting us know. And they've actually fixed that. They've actually corrected those issues as a result of the audits that we've done and what we've been able to share with them. Of course, there's protocols that we've also flagged and shared that haven't corrected some of those issues. But I think that just really, because we make a lot of this information public, it really gives light to, I think, the protocols and communities that are really focused on being trustless, permissionless, decentralized and noncustodial. So whatever we can do right to support that for the community is great.
00:21:56.680 - 00:22:16.040, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. One of the other things I noticed in perusing the app here is the ability to add wallets, to watch wallets, as well as bundling wallets. I mean, these are just these small features that I really appreciate if you're using debank or other similar things. The functionality here is just like much more advanced.
00:22:17.820 - 00:22:40.850, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Much more advanced. Most definitely. Yeah. So you can access a lot of these protocols via multiple wallets. You can also bundle wallets across different chains and you can't really do that on any other platform. So we're just really happy to be able to offer that.
00:22:40.850 - 00:23:57.364, Speaker C: It's so nice when you can just sort of consolidate everything, at least from an ability to just view what's going on and what you have on one dashboard. So that's always a very valuable feature for a lot of people. But, yeah, some of the features that we have coming out this year is we have a feature coming out where users are going to be able to invest directly into some of these pools. We have a swap feature coming out, and as we mentioned earlier, we also have the revoke feature. And so the invest feature that's also going to be part of a feature that we call explore opportunities. And explore opportunities is essentially going to be an opportunity where users can view a lot of the top liquidity pools in one page, but across different protocols. So often you have to log into a particular protocol to connect your wallet to see what pools that they're offering.
00:23:57.364 - 00:24:36.260, Speaker C: But here you'll be able to see the various liquidity pools across different protocols that are trending as the top in terms of top API. Sorry, Apys. And you'll be able to see, and so you'll be able to invest directly into them through the Defi dashboard and also just scroll and check out different ones. And so that's going to be a feature that we're going to be coming out with also this year. There's some really exciting stuff coming down the pipeline.
00:24:37.080 - 00:24:43.530, Speaker B: Right on. And is one of those things you all are planning to launch your own chain, is that correct?
00:24:46.140 - 00:25:32.040, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely, we do. So DFI yield is coming out with its own, I would say, blockchain network that's coming out at the end of this year. So end of 2022, that's going to be our testnet, and then our main net is going to be coming soon after that. We have a token as well coming out too. With the token, users are going to be able to stake that in order to run their own nodes, to run their own nodes on the network and get rewarded with the token. We're also coming out with a stable coin token as well, which is going to have a one to one peg ratio.
00:25:35.020 - 00:25:36.200, Speaker B: Stable coins.
00:25:37.100 - 00:25:42.492, Speaker C: All right. Yeah, defi yield. Oh, I know. Tell me about it.
00:25:42.546 - 00:25:43.150, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:25:45.040 - 00:25:59.120, Speaker C: Totally warranted. Yeah, super fresh. But yeah, that's coming also for androids and iOS.
00:26:00.820 - 00:26:35.740, Speaker B: Got it. Yeah, the mobile experience is quite nice as well. And maybe just to ask a quick question here, obviously on the gnosis chain show here you all have a relationship with gnosis chain. And what attracted you all to this neck of the woods? Obviously people can access gnosis chain from any of the networks within defi yield, but I believe I might be having some microphone problems, so I'm going to mute up for just a moment. You can continue Sonali if you have any input on the gnosis chain side of things while I troubleshoot.
00:26:37.120 - 00:27:33.196, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. No, for gnosis chain, we really value what gnosis chain is doing in terms of their development, and we also see a lot of potential and we also see a lot of the vision in terms of where it's growing. And so, yeah, we want to be able to offer as many very valuable blockchains like gnosis chain on our dashboard. And so gnosis chain has its own community, and there's a few protocols on there that are also building like hop. I know they have some other great protocols that they're working with that we're also currently talking to as well. So we're looking forward to getting them integrated.
00:27:33.196 - 00:28:13.260, Speaker C: And I know that they have hive as well. So I was taking a look at that protocol before, but yeah, there's like a whole ecosystem. Right? Onosis. And I know there's a lot of it that's also just getting started. And so we want to make sure that we can support the ecosystem, at least in terms of a lot of the yield farming protocols that are being built on gnosis and for the Defi space. So, yeah, I think it's really great. We're looking forward to getting more protocols that are being built to the gnosis chain integrated onto our dashboard.
00:28:15.960 - 00:28:50.050, Speaker B: Fantastic. Well, yeah, I can speak for somebody who's been working on gnosis chain for a while, building here. There's a lot of serious Dao is building. And so definitely, I think the tools that you offer are something that, for example, I would share with contributors, people that are interested in. They're operating a lot on chain and want easy access to revocal of approvals and want to nerd out on audits. I think there's a good sync on almost the ethos side of things with the gnosis chain community?
00:28:51.620 - 00:29:41.840, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And it's nice because it's like then a lot of gnosis chain and protocol users, they'll all have the opportunity to view a lot of their gnosis protocol assets all in one place, and then they'll be able to see the assets that they have across other chains, also in one place. And like you said, it's a great opportunity for them to nerd out if they want to take a look at audits. And it's also easier when you have tools like these. It just makes doing your own research way easier and way faster. And you're not having to just always pull from ten different websites. We actually share a lot of the resources also in terms of recs and audits on our page.
00:29:41.840 - 00:30:05.380, Speaker C: So sometimes we'll cite from different resources and we consolidate a lot of that also and make that available for users. But, yeah, it's a great opportunity for them to track their pools, their vaults, their staking, and have that all be on one seamless, sort of easy to use dashboard.
00:30:08.080 - 00:30:21.350, Speaker B: Yeah. I've got to ask one question, though. Are you all considering bridge integrations so that people. You said you have a swap coming? Are cross chain bridges something that you all are considering adding to the UI there?
00:30:21.960 - 00:31:06.720, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we're definitely taking a look at that, and I believe that's something that's currently just in the talks right now. So bridging is. I believe that's going to be a feature we're definitely going to look at having integrated. So that way it's nice to be able to have a lot of the key features and tools accessible on one dashboard. I mean, if we're going to be known for offering a lot of non EVM chains, which is really exciting, it'd be also great to have a bridging feature to bridge some of those chains, to move some of the tokens across the different chains.
00:31:07.780 - 00:31:20.790, Speaker B: Absolutely. Well, I would be remiss if I didn't ask on behalf of my own curiosity and everybody in the audience here, can you give us a little alpha on the token ido or what does that sound like?
00:31:21.660 - 00:32:45.612, Speaker C: Yeah, so, honestly, I think the only alpha I can give on the ido is that we're aiming for second quarter. However, I would say, in all honesty, a lot of it also depends on the status of the market. And I guess everyone's aware of the current events that have happened in the last few days. Ideally, it's the best interest of our investors and we want to make sure that when we launch the IDO that it's going to be really strategic timing and it's also going to serve our investors in the best way possible. So we want everybody to have a win with this and have a really good upride. Right now it's aiming for second quarter, but it's also going to be, I would say, dependent on the status of the current market. So as things start to calm and enter a place of sort of restoring balance and enter a little bit of an upwind bull market, that's going to be the best time for us to go full throttle with the launch.
00:32:45.612 - 00:33:34.720, Speaker C: We have all the marketing prepared for this. We have a lot of the contracts prepared also in terms of exchanges for listings, we're ready to go. It's really just all about pulling the trigger. What we're doing in the meantime, as we plan and as we scope this out, we're really focused on the product development. It just makes sense to invest as much as we can into the utility, into the product development. So that way a lot of that will just offer more value to the token and to the ido once we launch.
00:33:35.620 - 00:34:08.860, Speaker B: Sure. Very cool. Well folks, definitely check out defiyield app. If you haven't been there yet, connect your wallet. As we were discussing earlier, they got a really remarkable number of EVM chains, plus Solana and terra and cosmos. So definitely check it out and you can is the way to if people are interested in participating in the idea, is this private sale feature, is that the button on the UI? Is that the place that people should go to learn more or is there a better location?
00:34:09.520 - 00:35:03.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say, you know what, for anybody that would like to get more information on that, say Ario or just more information in general, like would like to just get more involved into the Defi space. And I would say check out our defi yield community telegram. So we have a community telegram that's available. And you also go to our website, you'll be able to access a lot of those links from there as well. Follow us on Twitter and you can check out also like our youtubes. So with a lot of our protocols, we create tutorials that run people that run users through how to navigate each of these tutorials if they want to get started into yield farming. So that's a really great place to connect and learn more.
00:35:03.950 - 00:36:12.050, Speaker C: Also, another thing that we also have available for maybe users are a bit more involved into the Defi space is we create these ultimate guides and these are dedicated very often to our blockchains that we work with. And these ultimate guides are essentially almost like an ebook. They're very in depth. It's like a Bible when it comes to walking people through the most valuable golden core features of the blockchains, their ecosystem and their core space. So we're going to be creating one actually, sorry, we actually already have one created for gnosis chain and so we're going to be putting that out very soon. So I'd like to invite a lot of the community to keep an eye out for that. And we'll tag gnosis and ideally we'll share it with all of our telegram channels in our community with that one as well.
00:36:12.050 - 00:36:31.400, Speaker C: And then I'd like to give a heads up also to community that we'll have an interview with gnosis chain coming up on our YouTube channel shortly. So keep an eye out for announcements around that as well. And please check it out and tune be. I think it'll be a great interview.
00:36:34.140 - 00:36:42.750, Speaker B: So the resources that you just mentioned about the chains that you're deployed on, where can people find that resource? Or those resources rather? Is it within the app?
00:36:43.600 - 00:37:05.750, Speaker C: Yeah. So if you connect your wallet to the app, if you're connected to any protocols, there'll be a little section at the bottom. It's in gray and it says view more protocols or view 100 plus protocols. If you click on that, it'll show you all the different chains that we have.
00:37:09.240 - 00:37:09.940, Speaker B: Okay.
00:37:10.090 - 00:37:11.990, Speaker C: I wish I could screen share with you.
00:37:13.240 - 00:37:26.780, Speaker B: No, I'm in the app right now, actually on YouTube. So if they scroll to the bottom of the page, just walk me through this. If anybody's watching, they can check it out. So I'm in the app right now and I scroll down to the very bottom on the dashboard. Where will I find those resources?
00:37:27.200 - 00:37:54.260, Speaker C: Okay, your wallet is connected, so probably the first thing you see is account overview networks. And then. Sorry, I just logged into mine and it is still loading. Yeah. So there should be.
00:37:55.190 - 00:37:55.566, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:37:55.608 - 00:38:04.890, Speaker C: I'm just going to take a look at this with you while I'm with you. Transactions.
00:38:08.300 - 00:38:33.890, Speaker B: I would say in the meantime, folks, if you're not interested in logging in to see your balance, you can always log into defi yield and really do some cool research on their audit database and their rec database. I think this is really neat. I mean, the filters themselves on the rec database are pretty awesome. I mean, you can target specific attack vectors if you're interested in this kind of stuff. This is a really cool tool.
00:38:35.540 - 00:39:13.390, Speaker C: Totally. Yeah. Actually, I think our developers are doing some work on the back end right now on the dashboard, it will show, like under networks it'll say protocols and it'll show you all the different protocols that we have and also chain. So I think they're actually just doing some work right now in the back end. So I would say maybe check back in a little bit later and you'll be able to view that.
00:39:14.560 - 00:39:28.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I did notice right now on the il calculator, if people are checking out the UI, you scroll down, they have a link to the YouTube content and the like. So you can sort of check that out, folks, if you're interested in learning more.
00:39:30.180 - 00:40:16.960, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah. And then also if you connect, sorry, to the, like, to the top right, there's a little arrow that points down. It looks like it's next to a settings kind of icon. It'll also show you the networks that you're connected on. And I think the developers are actually working on the back end right now because all the chains will show on your dashboard. And so, yeah, give it a bit and we'll have that updated back to its original kind of settings.
00:40:16.960 - 00:40:19.424, Speaker C: Not too long.
00:40:19.462 - 00:40:24.630, Speaker B: Sure thing. Well, I don't know, Sonali, did you want to take some questions from the audience today? How do you feel about that?
00:40:25.400 - 00:40:29.700, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to take any questions. If there's any questions from the audience.
00:40:31.000 - 00:41:00.610, Speaker A: If you just want to raise your hand, then I'll make you a speaker. Anyone has any questions, just throw up an emoji or whatever you'd like and I'll bring you up on stage. I actually have a question for you, Sonali. Sure. Let's say I go on to defi yield and I bundle a bunch of wallets together and then I close out my browser and I come back the next day. Does it save all those wallets in one bundle or will I have to manually re add all those wallets again?
00:41:02.420 - 00:41:32.120, Speaker C: It saves it. And so once you've added it, it'll save it. And then in the future you can select from which of those wallets you'd like to bundle each time. Because sometimes you want to bundle it for a particular day and unbundle it. It'll actually save a lot of the wallets that you put in there and then you'll have the option to create different bundles.
00:41:33.340 - 00:41:33.896, Speaker B: Cool.
00:41:33.998 - 00:42:03.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's an awesome tool. I mean, for anyone who remembers vfat tools or even something like revote cache, those are all amazing open source tools that are available for retail users, but you have to know where to find them. It's great that you brought all these resources into one place and put it on an accessible dashboard and you're going to save people just a lot of pain. So hats off to that.
00:42:05.560 - 00:42:38.508, Speaker D: 100%. So yeah, just join as a speaker. Matt here. Yeah, so you can find the noses guide in our homepage. So you just go in our blog, blog defiled or you write ultimate guide niosis chain defiled, and then you can find the guide. As Sonali mentioned, it's really like a mini book. Just write on Google noses chain defiled guide or noses chain ultimate guide yield farming guide so you can find it.
00:42:38.508 - 00:42:41.920, Speaker D: Or again from our homepage, our blog.
00:42:46.320 - 00:43:21.610, Speaker C: Awesome. I'll make sure I share that with you guys. So I'll share it in our chat. Yeah, that's really exciting. But actually that's a really good point. Kind of like you said on the revoke website that it's great to have tools like these because a lot of people, they have to really do some work to find sites like that. And even when they do come across see sites like Revoke for example, they're not always the best user friendly to understand how to even get started or what to do.
00:43:21.610 - 00:44:46.290, Speaker C: There's still a little bit of technical background that a person needs to have in order to understand how to navigate that. So I think it's really important finding ways to really simplify these steps for users. I think the less clicks, the better. The more streamlined we can make. A lot of these steps is going to be, I think will just support the growth of the Defi community because it'll allow them to just focus more on their portfolio, the opportunities, the end result of the research that is already done for them, and information, and be able to make better and more informed decisions in terms of how they navigate the space. Also be able to enjoy it more because they'll be made aware of if there's a risk or threat that they can have a heads up about and at least have an informed opportunity whether to stay or leave. And yeah, I think in a lot of ways it's really just about simplifying, I think a lot of these steps for our defi community.
00:44:47.300 - 00:45:30.610, Speaker D: Yeah, I wanted to add that you mentioned other revoke tool, right? So the other revoke tool just provide you the ability to revoke or update the allowance in some case. In our case, we are categorizing the smart contract risk. So there's a lot of back end identification process. So what does it mean? It means that you have approved some malicious smart contract and we are going to inform you the other Revoke tool doesn't have this function as well. Our tool is just like an enterprise grade, professional grade tool for Revoke again. And the approval that you see in the website that we have now.
00:45:33.860 - 00:45:34.176, Speaker C: We.
00:45:34.198 - 00:45:44.660, Speaker D: Did it one year ago. It was really the first version. The new version that we're going to have this month is going to be ten x more advanced than that. So yeah, it's going to be totally a game changer.
00:45:46.840 - 00:46:14.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. Just real quick. That's one of the most exciting things about this industry or this space that I find is that you have all these open source tools and people can iterate on it and you take someone else's idea and you can build on top of it and improve it or take it in whatever direction you want. So yeah, I think it's great what you're doing and I'm all for investor protection all day long. So more tools that are available to people, the better.
00:46:15.680 - 00:46:30.100, Speaker B: I feel like right now the first part of the assessment is just your Twitter notifications. You expect to hear about some issue on Twitter and then maybe you go to revoke cache and you're familiar with that, but folding this all into one UI is brilliant.
00:46:32.040 - 00:47:15.200, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We're just really excited and again, we're really grateful and happy to be working with gnosis chain and finding as many ways as we can to really consolidate a lot of the top chains, top protocols and best tools that people want and are going to need to really make the whole defi experience a lot smoother, enjoyable and just a better ride.
00:47:19.190 - 00:47:44.620, Speaker B: Well, perfect timing. I think there's no better tool for people to get informed about and it's been really great to have you on today, Sonali, and to really learn and be able to share a bit of more about defi yield folks. Defiyield app. Definitely check it out and connect again soon. When is again the interview that you'll be having with gnosis folks on Defi yield? Or is there a date you mentioned?
00:47:44.990 - 00:48:12.120, Speaker C: Yeah, dates not set yet for that. So we're actually currently in the talks right now of getting that coordinated. We should have a date soon. I think we'll be talking to them today about that, but yeah, definitely we'll share that material with you as soon as it's out and we look forward to sharing it with the whole community. So I think they're going to be excited about that. As.
00:48:20.470 - 00:48:28.600, Speaker B: John, we had one other person that looked like they raised their hand. I don't want to cut anybody off here. What do you feel. Oh, yeah, for sure. There you go.
00:48:30.490 - 00:48:31.298, Speaker A: Rolls.
00:48:31.394 - 00:48:49.706, Speaker B: Go for it. Hello. Hey, yeah, I just had a quick question. I don't know if you covered it already. Is DFI yield planning to delay due to the current market conditions, or are.
00:48:49.728 - 00:48:50.906, Speaker D: They still planning to go ahead and.
00:48:50.928 - 00:48:52.140, Speaker B: List in q two?
00:48:56.370 - 00:49:52.110, Speaker C: That's the aim in terms of when we're looking to list. But at the same time, we want to be really mindful about current market conditions. Right? Because it wouldn't make a lot of sense to launch when the market is in a downward spiral because nobody's going to win in that sort of condition. We're focused on whatever is going to support our investors the most and make it a winning kind of experience for everybody. And best times to do that is when it's not a bear market. Yeah, when things aren't, like, crashing. Totally.
00:49:52.110 - 00:49:54.320, Speaker C: But thank you for your question.
00:49:56.150 - 00:50:01.538, Speaker A: Anyone else want to come up on stage, feel free. Just raise your hand there.
00:50:01.704 - 00:50:29.370, Speaker B: In the meantime, I'll encourage people to again follow gnosis chain. Follow defi yield here on Twitter. Make sure you check out YouTube. Both projects have an active YouTube channel, so definitely head over there. Gnosis chain YouTube Defi yield on YouTube as well for some great educational content, but that looks like it as far as hands raised, et cetera. It's been really great to chat with everybody. Yeah, awesome.
00:50:29.440 - 00:50:44.406, Speaker A: Thanks everyone for making the time. Sonali, thanks for coming up and talking to everyone. T. Wells thanks so much for hosting. It was super informative. Everyone check out gnosischain world if you want some more info about the gnosis chain ecosystem. And definitely please drop in on our discord.
00:50:44.406 - 00:50:47.360, Speaker A: You can find it on Twitter page and come say hi and hang out.
