00:00:00.090 - 00:00:45.926, Speaker A: Okay yeah. Now one more time. So today I will be talking how to deploy your own token on ZKVM roll up via Presto. My name is Vika Tirina, I have more than ten years in tech. I have been working in different projects and now constantly exploring the web3 space. How many interesting projects are now available and transition from web two to web3 in free time. Interested in brain and brain computer interface about Gateway Gateway was established in 2021 in Norway.
00:00:45.926 - 00:03:07.426, Speaker A: We are a small team, about 17 members and we have a lot of competence in blockchain DevOps, quality assurance front end and we have been audited by PwC. We are a finalist of nordic awards. Recently we have launched platform as a service prest and it is platform that allow you to create your own ZKVM roll up or validium just in four clicks and it will take from ten to 20 minutes and it deployed with all the infrastructure you need. So it will be not just ras, so not just the KVM roll up, it will have all the infrastructure, block explorer, KYC, different oracles and we can customize it for your project so it could be included different solutions, different wallets for example or data availability actually about some basic theory about roll ups, why we need them. As mainet constant increases there are more and more applications on the main net and we see the delays and the cost is rising and here coming the roll ups that doing all the computation, they're doing computation off chain and sending the results to the l one so it can increase throughput and as well make it cheaper. The transaction simply to say and presta it is a roll up or validium small difference between validium and roll up. Validium is sending to l one proofs and roll ups is sending proofs and data availability and now I just will show you how it's easy to create the roll up.
00:03:07.426 - 00:04:28.684, Speaker A: So you just need to go to our website and it's just four clicks after that after login, yeah, you press add new and choose between the base layer. Now we're supporting ethereum agnosis and you can choose different options on premises, on your data centers or on our data centers. You can choose the tokenomics, use the default gas stock and the same as in layer one on to use gasless so it will be free for your users but you will pay only one fees. Gas fees. Yeah, here you see that it starts in deploying and the status will be available. So when it will be deployed you see that it is active. Now I would like to show the core features.
00:04:28.684 - 00:05:08.348, Speaker A: So you see on the main dashboard, what is root chain? Where it's deployed. You can copy URL for RPC for your usage and wallet UI. Coming soon we have a breach. So you can breach from l one to l two and vice versa. You can add to metamask your chain easily. And yeah, you see that it's added and just general information about RPC. Now we have public RPC, but as well we can provide access via API keys to economics that you choose.
00:05:08.348 - 00:06:03.804, Speaker A: We in the future will release that. You can set up the tokenomics as you wish for your needs, for your project analytics faucet, you can send test tokens for your development. And yeah you can see the data availability and proofs on layer one and in general information about data centers where it's deployed. And now finally how actually to deploy your own token. We providing hardcut config. So you can just download your hardcut config, add it to your wrapper and it will be all the settings of this chain that you just created. So you see all the required information as well.
00:06:03.804 - 00:06:56.960, Speaker A: The gas price here. Today I will be deploying rc 20 tokens. So I just using open zeppelin open source library and import it. So it's simple. This is showing that how easy it for you as already developer on Ethereum to use this roll ups. You don't need to use any new tools, learn new language, you can use everything what you are normally using for Ethereum development. Now we will deploy our token to this network, just copying the name of network, run the deploy script and you will see how easily it will be deployed.
00:06:56.960 - 00:08:43.550, Speaker A: Yeah, and now my token is deployed, we can check and browse explorer that it has been deployed the contract and we can as well verify the contract. So to verify and publish you just need to flatten your solidity code and then go through the verification process and name of your token compiler version and the code. And now it's published and you have your contract deployed. We can see as well in block Scout that we have available this token. Yes, so it's such easy to deploy your own token or any other smart contract. For ZKVM rollabs there are different applications. For example for ZK Validium is usually for small projects or test proposed for projects that require more security.
00:08:43.550 - 00:09:49.010, Speaker A: It's better roll ups and you can use ZK EVM roll ups starting from the small projects to the big enterprise projects in pharmacy and medicine and different domains NFT markets. And as I mentioned before, it's not just Ras, it's platform as a service. So it's not just a roll up. We are providing on top verified partners. So you already integrated to our platform, so you don't need to spend time on the integration with new partners and verification. We have partnership with Safe Block Scout, Celestia, Redstone, Dora and others and soon coming new partnerships. We are constantly working on it and we would like to provide seamless integration for you as a project.
00:09:49.010 - 00:11:07.780, Speaker A: We already have these projects running, so it's not only in Testnet, we have two main projects that's already using this setup. It's Palm NFT Studio and Gnosispay and other projects in our pipeline. So it is working solutions and in general some partners and clients that we have been working and working. Now it's gnosis chain agnosis, pay, Palm NFT Studio, Luxa, Opera, Polygon, ZKVM, Goldsky and give us and we one of the official lidar validators. Now, in conclusion, I think the future of web3 is in scalability, seamless integration of complex blockchain technology and strong focus on UI and UX. And all this we try to integrate in our platform. So in terms of how easy it's to create your own roll up and how easy to integrate it with different partners.
00:11:07.780 - 00:11:33.170, Speaker A: And actually for web two projects it will be easy to use even without knowledge, deep knowledge of blockchain technology. And I think this will help and accelerate mass adoption and transition from web two to web3. Thank you for your time and my twitter. Yeah.
00:11:39.960 - 00:11:50.650, Speaker B: Thank you so much Katerina. And do we have any questions about deploying tokens via. No? Okay.
00:11:54.460 - 00:12:16.396, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you for your presentation. I can definitely also confirm that previously what took us probably like one or two months to actually get a roll up on those chain deployed. Now, it's really impressive to see that this can be condensed to a few minutes only. It's also great that you support DKE EVM by Polygon. How does it relate to the efforts by polygon in terms of the polygon.
00:12:16.428 - 00:12:31.730, Speaker A: Supernet we are using now, Polygon CDK. So it's not Polygon supernets. We are using Polygon CDK with proverbs that they are supporting. So it's different technology.
00:12:34.980 - 00:12:40.330, Speaker B: Perfect. Anybody else any more? Okay, well, thank you so much.
00:12:40.860 - 00:12:41.350, Speaker A: Thank you.
