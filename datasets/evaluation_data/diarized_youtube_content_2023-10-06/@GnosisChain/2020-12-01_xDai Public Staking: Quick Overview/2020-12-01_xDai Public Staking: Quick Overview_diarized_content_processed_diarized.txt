00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.790, Speaker A: This is a quick preview of the upcoming public staking application with postdow consensus on XDAi. We're using a local instance for testing purposes.
00:00:10.210 - 00:00:14.174, Speaker B: Once the app is live, you'll see the correct chain information along with one.
00:00:14.212 - 00:00:20.880, Speaker A: Week staking epochs and other XDAi specific details. Here we have parameters tuned for testing at the moment.
