And there's been some protocols because we make this information public. And so there's some protocols that have seen that and been like, okay, thank you very much for letting us know. And they've actually fixed that.

Of course, there's protocols that we've also flagged and shared that haven't corrected some of those issues. But I think that just really, because we make a lot of this information public, it really gives light to, I think, the protocols and communities that are really focused on being trustless, permissionless, decentralized and.
