00:00:08.710 - 00:00:45.366, Speaker A: Not everybody has like a really techie background. Sometimes the average user, they're just researching things on YouTube and reading articles. But not everybody has a developer's background. So what we want to do is we want to be able to offer what like an advanced user would usually have access to. So like a developer, for example. And usually developers can kind of take a look at the code and smart contracts and understand what's a vulnerability or an issue, but the average user can't do that. So we want to be able to give that same access to the average user, and that's how we're doing that.
00:00:45.366 - 00:01:25.840, Speaker A: So we're letting them know specifically what's a concern or what's a risk in that particular smart check code. So maybe the token router isn't hard coded, or maybe there's a proxy issue, or maybe there's unlimited minting. Maybe the smart contract hasn't been verified, for example. So there's a lot of different issues that our tool can catch it, actually, to be more specific in that it can catch, I believe, over 600 different vulnerabilities. Sorry, different risks, so different threats, I guess you could say.
