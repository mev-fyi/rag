00:00:01.080 - 00:00:19.798, Speaker A: Hello, hello. Welcome to Index podcast, where the three of us come together every couple weeks to discuss on chain data chart crimes and metrics that move the crypto industry. The three of us are denning on chain corgi at flashbots. Hildobi, resident data house elf at Dragonfly. Hello.
00:00:19.846 - 00:00:20.474, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:21.214 - 00:00:45.072, Speaker A: And me, that is boxer. And I am the community powerhouse at Dune. And before we get into it, nothing we say in this podcast is legal, financial, or life advice. We are acting independently of our employers. And you know the drill. Take everything with a grain of salt that we say here. So in this episode, we are going to talk about restaking.
00:00:45.072 - 00:01:06.374, Speaker A: And restaking, obviously quite a big topic at the moment. Eigen layer dropped their token. I think at this point, we are recording on Wednesday, fiftieth of May. So I think a week ago, the Eigen layer dropped. And maybe to get into the topic, are any of you to restaking at the moment or staking general? Maybe Dobby go first.
00:01:07.034 - 00:01:19.188, Speaker B: I'm restaking through LLT protocols, so liquid restaking protocols. So I'm not restaking my own eth, but I'm restaking liquid staking tokens, if that makes sense.
00:01:19.306 - 00:01:24.204, Speaker A: How so are you, actually? So you actually deposited in eigenvalue?
00:01:25.064 - 00:01:44.964, Speaker B: I deposited, yeah, through Ethify. Renzo, I wanted to try, like, the big restaking protocol, so I tried a bunch. I threw some eth into a bunch of them. So Renzo, Ethify and swell, I think. No, sorry. Kelp. Kelp Tao, which is another one.
00:01:45.604 - 00:01:47.584, Speaker A: Okay. Danny, how about you?
00:01:48.364 - 00:02:21.154, Speaker C: Yeah. Hell yeah. I am a solo staker myself. I accumulated, like, 32 yeast over the years, and it's been hard. And my validator probably landed, like, two or three blocks in the past ten months since I've staked. And then I also been accumulating more yeast. I want to spin up another solo staker, but I couldn't get up to 32, so I've been, like, just like, putting, like, 17 east across Lido and rocket pool, and now there's Eigen lair.
00:02:21.154 - 00:02:34.734, Speaker C: And so I think I was mostly thinking about farming it. And so I put my yeast, restake the sorry liquid, stake the yeast into Eigen. So, yeah, got some eigen points as well. So that's my stack.
00:02:35.274 - 00:02:59.974, Speaker A: Okay. What about you? I don't re sick. I don't stake. There's weird german tax laws that basically make it unsure if. If you stake an asset, if that is, then, like, its income, and, like, it might be business income if you have, like, a certain size. So it's like, I talked to my tax advisor about this. He was like, do you really want to risk it all? Like, there's like, big tax benefits.
00:02:59.974 - 00:03:33.104, Speaker A: On the other hand, if I don't do it. So, like, he was like, do you really want to risk it all to, like, earn? I don't know, how much yield is 3% of one, or like 32 eth? How much would that be in a year? Not enough to, like, not enough to warrant all the worries. So until the taxation laws are a bit more clear, and I actually think they are, like, more clear now, but I'm just, like, too lazy to actually deal with it. So, yeah, I'm not restaking at the moment. My ETH is just sitting around and being lazy. But, yeah, fair enough. But, yeah.
00:03:33.104 - 00:04:12.584, Speaker A: So obviously we don't come fully unprepared, and I'm just going to talk about our own staking experiences here. Hildavi is actually probably one of the authorities in the e three staking kind of data market. He's built a dashboard on Dune which has been referenced quite a lot throughout the industry. So, Robbie, if you could take it away and just walk us through that dashboard and maybe through an introduction to staking and what is this actually? And why do people do this? And we've already thrown around quite a few words which might be unfamiliar to some listeners. I hope not too many, because if you listen to this podcast, you hopefully know what all of this is, but take it away.
00:04:13.204 - 00:04:42.124, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me take you through staking through data. I think it's a good angle. So I think to start up, we need some context. And the reason we have, like, ethereum moved to proof of stake is it happened in a three phase rollout. The reason in the first place is that beforehand you were mining. So it was proof of work, much like bitcoin, and you were mining.
00:04:42.124 - 00:05:31.092, Speaker B: So you just run a validator, and it was computing and generating some ETH in the process. Now it's different where you need to put increments of 32 ETH at stake in order to generate and validate the network and generate some rewards. And this transition started in late 2020. So if you can see my screen here, you can see that the first, like the Beacon chain launched in essentially, like November 2020. And even if it was September 2022, I think that we had proof of stake went live. I know it's in September, but I feel like it's 2022. So, yeah, it was live for quite a few months.
00:05:31.092 - 00:06:17.294, Speaker B: And the reason being that before actually having this live, we want to accumulate a fair bit of stakers in order to make sure that there's different participants. It's decentralized and we're not just launching and then there's three validators and the entire Ethereum blockchain is running on the back of three people. So you needed to build up that stake. There's also some. You have queues in order to make sure that you can have massive flows in either direction. So in or out that are too sudden. This is to mitigate any potential impacts on the network and make sure we don't have any issues related to this.
00:06:17.294 - 00:07:07.532, Speaker B: And in September 2022, proof of stake went live. And that meant that we actually made the switch of the Ethereum blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake, and that it was actually validated through that new process. What it led to is, I guess it reduced a lot the consumption of Ethereum in general as a blockchain because proof of stake was very energy consuming. But it also led to more things which are now you're incentivized to be a honest actor because you have actual eth at play here. So you can't just say random stuff like validate random stuff. You got to actually be honest or you'll be penalized. So there are different reasons.
00:07:07.532 - 00:07:47.134, Speaker B: There's also another reason is that you can much more reliably control the block time and the block size. So now block time is 12 seconds. So every 12 seconds there's a new block. Beforehand, it was more about like when someone had finally validated and found a correct hash to validate the next block. So it was much more sporadic, I'd say, but yeah. So these are the first two phase and the third phase was in, I believe, q one last year. So Q 120 23, I think probably February or March where we had withdrawals that went live.
00:07:47.134 - 00:08:29.964, Speaker B: So those weren't live in the first place. Also to make sure the rollout, since it's such a big blockchain and you got so much value at play, you want to make sure that the rollout is controlled and tested properly. So that's why it took such a long time. But we finally had withdrawals and since then withdrawals have been live. And I'd say there hasn't been much of an issue in this whole process. It went pretty smoothly, which is, I think, pretty impressive considering all things. So many things could have gone wrong, but it's actually went really, really smooth.
00:08:29.964 - 00:09:14.736, Speaker B: So I think congrats to devs on this. It's pretty impressive of an upgrade, but since then. So now that you have staking, you have different ways to stake, and the first and obvious way is to stake it yourself, control it yourself, run your invalidator, blah, blah, blah. So that's like the normal solo validator setup, but you had protocols that were like, ok, how about you give us your eth and we stake it for you? So there's different types of validators that do this on this dashboard. I tried to categorize them into different sections. So the easy one is central exchanges. So this is coinbase, binance and everything.
00:09:14.736 - 00:09:17.644, Speaker B: Central exchanges, taking your Eth and staking it for you.
00:09:18.184 - 00:09:19.912, Speaker C: It's like custody, right?
00:09:19.968 - 00:09:40.358, Speaker B: Yeah. They act as a custodian and do the staking and give you back your reward with. They all have fees. I think it goes up to 20%. I believe that's the max range I've seen. But maybe I'm wrong and there's more. They take a fee and they give you back the rest of the rewards.
00:09:40.358 - 00:10:27.756, Speaker B: So you don't have to basically do anything, which is much easier because to stake, you actually need a bit of work and make sure that your validator is constantly running, you don't have any issues. It involves a bit more work. So central exchanges, then we have staking pools, which are essentially, they're essentially also custodians, but I labeled them differently because they're not central exchanges in the first place. There's, of course, not everyone is doing exactly the same. There's different kind. We're not going to get into each specific ones because I think it can go pretty deep. I have, like here I have 96 different protocols tagged, a lot of which are central exchanges, staking pools and stuff.
00:10:27.756 - 00:11:13.308, Speaker B: So they all vary slightly in how they operate and how they work. And the last one, liquid staking, and that is protocols such as lido rocket pool, which let you essentially pull your each together in order for them to stake, but in an ideally decentralized way. Many of those are not fully decentralized, but are on a path to decentralization. But the idea is to do the same as central exchanges or staking pool in a completely decentralized manner. Some staking pools are also decentralized. Again, there's so many different ways they operate.
00:11:13.396 - 00:11:23.584, Speaker C: Do you know if, like generally the institute custodian staking is higher yield, or like if like lido and rocket pool is higher? I'm curious.
00:11:24.524 - 00:11:59.070, Speaker B: That's a good question. Let's see here. On rated's website, we can see the APR for each of them. I don't think there's a difference between whether they are central exchange or decentralized or whatever, but it's more about how they operate. Do they run mev boosts and stuff like this? This is what is going to impact your APR here. You can see that they're all in the same range of 3.2 to four or something.
00:11:59.070 - 00:12:28.894, Speaker B: Fracs here is an outlier, it seems, and doing very well. But, yeah, it also varies over time. It's not a stable metric. It varies greatly. Also, if they have some validators that are down, of course that impacts their APR and stuff like this. There's so many considerations, but it doesn't matter what the protocol is in the first place. It's how they stake in their custody eth.
00:12:28.894 - 00:12:30.234, Speaker B: That's what matters.
00:12:30.274 - 00:12:37.392, Speaker C: It's pretty crazy to see Etherfi is higher than binance and kraken here in this list in terms of penetration.
00:12:37.488 - 00:12:59.564, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Etherfi, they grew a lot. They were a bit later to their, like, what got them to be this big? You know, it's like restaking. And it's interesting that we had this dynamic, like, late into the staking scene, I guess, where it kind of shifted to restaking. You can look at this. Maybe later. Later.
00:12:59.564 - 00:14:02.864, Speaker B: So far we've got 27% of ETH that is validated network, 28% of which is staked through Lido, which is the biggest protocol in terms of state ETH. Of course, here I'm tagging it all as Lido, but they actually have quite a few validators. So if you look at a single entity that controls the ETH, it's actually not Lido, but it's more going to be Coinbase, who. We don't have much of a picture on how the staking operation works, but they should be, as far as I know, the biggest in terms of staked amounts operated by a single entity, because Lido have many of the entities created for them. But, yeah, so here you can see how it shared amongst participants. We can also see lower in the dashboard how it's shared amongst different protocol types. So liquid staking is by far is dominating.
00:14:02.864 - 00:14:33.912, Speaker B: Central exchanges are the second one of 25%. Liquid staking is 32, by the way, staking pools 16%. And then the thing is, you can't obviously identify everything. So a lot of the time I spend on this dashboard is me tagging entities. And of course, you can't tag everyone. Many are very discreet, and you don't know who it is. My goal is generally to tag more custodians than solo stakers.
00:14:33.912 - 00:14:54.370, Speaker B: I think custodians are going to be aware it matters. Solo stakers are great, but it's very hard to tag, and it's also extremely tedious, because if you tag one solo stakers, it's usually not a big stake in amounts. So the amount of work you need to tag one person is going to lead to much, you know, a much smaller impact. So it's, you know, do you actually.
00:14:54.442 - 00:15:00.534, Speaker A: Identify them on a personal level? Like, would you be able to say, denning ETH is this sticker?
00:15:01.114 - 00:15:20.784, Speaker B: If they have an ens, it should show up as their ens, as the name. But you also have, like, if you look here, like Vitalik, Daniel Wang, and other people who have staked, like, significant amounts, like Daniel Wang controls, like, 0.5% of staked ETH.
00:15:21.284 - 00:15:21.996, Speaker C: Who is he?
00:15:22.060 - 00:15:40.916, Speaker B: I'd say who is he? Is a good question. He is the co founder of Taiko, and I don't honestly know much more about him, but I think he's just a very early participant in Ethereum, hence why he's got so much eth.
00:15:40.980 - 00:15:46.820, Speaker A: Okay. And you identify these people by looking at the withdrawal address for their beacon.
00:15:46.892 - 00:16:52.914, Speaker B: So there's various ways I try to identify. Was it where the ETH came from? Is one thing, who executed the transactions? Is it tied to any specific entity? If I see an address that has regular movements with just one specific, let's say central exchange, especially if it's like a wallet that doesn't behave in a way with other wallets, but only with this one, you got, like, you don't have many different ways to tell. And I try to use everything in my power, everything that's available and public, to tag them and regularly eat away at that. 16.3% of identified unidentified share and trying to stay on top of things. You also have wallet rotations that I need to factor in. As for security purposes, especially central exchanges, they'll regularly move their ETH from one node to another.
00:16:52.914 - 00:17:55.738, Speaker B: So, yeah, it just is a lot of work of maintenance, and it's very easy for decentralized protocols because you'll see the smart contract and usually from there you can easily tell where it's from and stuff like this. Before centralized custodian protocols or centralized custodians, it's much harder. Those are trying to obfuscate more and try to hide a little more. So I think it's generally info that's very necessary if you are participants in or use Ethereum as a blockchain or interest in any way. It's like what is securing the network. Who is it? Is there anyone that is taking too much so that it's at risk of centralization? So these are all things that you should keep in mind, and if you use it, you might as well make sure that it's a blockchain that is secured properly and is trustworthy in terms of decentralization.
00:17:55.876 - 00:18:20.030, Speaker C: And just to emphasize on top of that, because I think in the very beginning a lot of people were confusing that when lid having this big amount of the network stake, it doesn't really mean that it's centralized because they have a decentralized or a big list of operators. It's like not one entity is controlling this amount of e staked and validating all the blocks they're receiving.
00:18:20.222 - 00:19:15.358, Speaker B: Yeah, the reason here I've got it all tagged as Lido is because it's just easy to track on chain, whereas who is actually validating is much harder since this isn't decentralized or even normalized. So I need to account for every specific protocol. So it's just such a large amount of work, and it's not something I had in consideration when I created the dashboard in the first place. So it need, it need a severe rework. And I don't know if I would even be able to tag many of them because it's not necessarily easy to find all those. It's a lot of work, but it's something I've had in mind and want to eventually tackle is just so much work compared to what the impact is. Actually, I think, rated probably has a clear picture of this.
00:19:15.358 - 00:19:39.834, Speaker B: Here you can see the different people staking for the different entities staking for Lido, for example. So there's 37 of them right now. Oh, by the way, I forgot to caveat. Just a disclosure. That dragonfly, we hold some of LDO Lido's covenant circuit, I think on a high level. That is it. Do you guys have any questions specifically.
00:19:39.914 - 00:19:59.594, Speaker A: Do you think the people who thought of ETh two would be happy about the staking distributions now with like kind of centralization through Lido and like Coinbase and Binance and all of these other liquid staking providers? Like, did we actually like, was this good network design?
00:20:00.534 - 00:21:00.490, Speaker B: There's like. There's things that are great and there's things that aren't, and I think it's one of the like. EF publishes a lot of work on this. Mike has shared a lot of thoughts on what he thinks we could do to improve it and how our expectations relative to what happened slightly differ of course, MEV, for example, playing such a big role is an interesting dynamic where in order to increase your APR, you could let your validator essentially accepts MEV transactions and be bribed for it, and therefore gain more ETH. And that of course quickly gained traction because more APR people are interested in just higher revenue, I guess not revenue, but the higher APR on their ETH. So that led to some dynamics. There's also another topic going to get deep into.
00:21:00.490 - 00:21:53.874, Speaker B: But censorship was another thing, especially with ofaccension address, such as tornado cash, which some validators decided to not accept into their blocks that they were validating. That was another interesting dynamic. I think this concern for now is much, it's much less of a concern, but for a while, a lot of the validators were actually censoring and that was concerning. But yeah, for now we're back to being good. So Geth, for example, is an execution trend. So one worry was that too much of state ETH is controlled through one execution client. Because if there ever is a problem with that execution client, that can cause trouble through all of Ethereum.
00:21:53.874 - 00:22:30.244, Speaker B: You know, we've had like execution clients have bugs every once in a while, which can be mitigated as long as it's not, you know, a high amount of staked ETH. And Geth is still over 50%. So ideally this keeps going down. It's been going down lately, especially since people have been pushing, you know, to switch to a minority client. So if you are staking and using Geth, please consider switching to nethermine Bisu or ergonom or another one or whatever. But yeah, we gotta mitigate that issue if we can.
00:22:30.744 - 00:23:06.642, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I saw. When you are a solo sticker and you go through each step, it's advice that you try to diversify the clients. But I think that's also another whole rabbit hole of discussion. Cause there's also both sides of opinions that, okay, but if you're encouraging all kinds of diversity and they're just new random rapport of implementation, it's not really battle tested. And so it's like when the, you know, the client's version, that's like a lot more long lasting and battle tested, and it's probably more safe. So like, it's hard to argue which is better for the long term.
00:23:06.738 - 00:23:07.306, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:23:07.370 - 00:23:15.794, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Either way, please switch to minority client.
00:23:15.914 - 00:24:20.240, Speaker A: So all of that to say, it is complicated. We can't really answer if this was a good network decision, because I also like, I think it's like there's other blockchain systems where restaking or kind of liquid staking is enshrined on a protocol level, right. I think in the cosmos ecosystems happens on Polkadot, on Ethereum we've kind of taken the decision hey, let's try to decentralize this and make sure that everyone can run a node from their home or like from a I think there's people running these things on Raspberry PI or something. And I think that's like one of the things that like the EF wanted to ensure with, with having this upgrade. In the end it has kind of led to decentralization. But at the same time now there's a whole ecosystem and lots of different people are kind of working on enabling this restaking instead of just one team working on this. So like there seems to be a trend in the ethereum ecosystem where it's like ah, we're not going to do, I don't know, sharding on the protocol level but rather we now have a bunch of roll ups and like they can all solve their problems like on their own.
00:24:20.240 - 00:24:54.450, Speaker A: And it seems like there's a similar situation happening here where we don't have an enshrined kind of liquid staking token or anything like that. But rather maybe it's a happy accident. Maybe the EF is just Bob Ross in the end. And it's like now there's like a bunch of different like restaking solutions and like people can like do more stuff with the Ethereum which is actually a good bridge to Eigen layer I guess where there's kind of an evolution happening that is not just facilitated by the EF but rather by a broader ecosystem. And actually more people can work on this.
00:24:54.642 - 00:25:45.980, Speaker C: Just one extra comments because earlier in the chat you asked why would anyone stake and I think there's rated at work as well. They had this number of what's the ratio? Spill it of the rewards across consensus layer and execution layer. The exclusion layer rewards would basically mean gas fee and mev. And I know that number is like around like 500 million a year. And like so that means the consensus layer rewards for staking nodes. It's like more than a billion a year kind of market industry. And so you know for sure there's incentive for all these institute and like how to say the staking providers to provide this service and like you know, aggregate liquidity and try to stake but also you know that meme the GIF of the soldier like doing a salute of like I'm doing my part, because that's actually a lot of, like, the solo stakers.
00:25:45.980 - 00:26:09.694, Speaker C: It's like, you know, yeah, the rewards isn't really big. Like, I actually spent more than $2,000 to buy a machine for, like, staking it. And, like, so far I made like three, three blocks and plus attestation rewards. And I don't think break even yet. But, like, for me, it's like I'm proudly, you know, securing the Ethereum network as doing my part. So, you know, so there's all kinds of reason for that, so.
00:26:10.594 - 00:26:28.494, Speaker A: Okay, fair enough. Isn't there also, like, I think there was a lot of talk at one point in time where it's like, oh, yeah, solo stakers are gonna get so many airdrops, and they're gonna be like the richest people in the world. And so many people started solo staking, but I don't think I've seen any, like, significant airdrops happening yet.
00:26:28.994 - 00:26:50.502, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, like, there's been some, like, for example, the Omni token, their job, etcetera. And there were like, rewards for a solo staker vertical, but I haven't got any of those. I wonder how they're accounting those for, you know, the addresses who are staking. I've actually got a lot more airdrops from just delayed NFT. Maybe that's the best investment.
00:26:50.598 - 00:27:27.606, Speaker B: This is like, I think Starknet did their airdrop where they gave to solo stakers, and there was a big discussion there because they used a data set that rated put out where they try to, through various heuristics, identify like, home stakers. And they of course, like, you know, heuristics based aren't 100% accurate. So there was a bit of a discussion and back and forth between some people saying, hey, like, I'm not included. There was one guy, I think, who had staked like an insane amount. I was like, hey, I'm actually not like a central exchange. Like, this is, this is me. I'm just a solo guy.
00:27:27.606 - 00:27:30.278, Speaker B: So there was like a discussion on GitHub, which was, which is funny.
00:27:30.366 - 00:27:33.274, Speaker C: That's probably Daniel one.
00:27:34.134 - 00:28:14.288, Speaker B: No, it was another guy. Like, even another guy, like completely anon, just a GitHub username that just for this was created. And I think it led to improving and cleaning that rated dataset that they've been working on. So it's like, in a way, it's, the best test scenario is having an airdrop and having people complain because they're not in it. The only thing is, of course, the other way around, like, if people were wrongly tagged, they're not going to be, hey, like, I'm actually not a solo validator. Like, no one's gonna, you know, no one's gonna do this. But if you didn't get, if you didn't get any, you should reach out to Elias from rated and see what he's got, what he's working on.
00:28:14.456 - 00:28:34.788, Speaker A: Yeah. Talk to the customer support of rated, please. I'm sure they're very happy about any inquiries why you're not included in any ad groups. Oh, man. But, yeah, with that said, yeah. Thank you for doing your part, Danny. But obviously, I think the main incentives here are always economic.
00:28:34.788 - 00:29:26.994, Speaker A: People stake the ETH because there's yields to be had. Or rather, yeah, I'm getting inflated because I don't stake and you guys are not getting deflated. So that's like one way to kind of view that whole thing. So obviously people chase economic rewards long. Then came eigen layer with a radical new idea, which is people can not only stake their ETH to secure the eTh consensus chain or the ETh beacon chain, or in general just the eTh consensus, but rather, we could utilize that kind of economic stake that people put up to also validate all kinds of other things. And that's the core idea of eigner. It's like, I put up my ETH to secure the ETH network, and why don't I also use this economic stake to also validate other things?
00:29:28.094 - 00:30:16.258, Speaker C: Yeah. So I have one last question. Follow up from what Dolby had in your dashboard. I remember because I was researching about the restaking topic, and in the bottom of your dashboard, there was a breakdown of different category of how ease are staked. And like, you could see this, like, light, how to say neon greenish color, which is restaking protocol has been growing up like crazy, you know, since the beginning of this year, and now it's jumped to around what, like 8% of the network. And if you see the whole picture, you can pretty much see that, like other category of the staked ease get absorbed by restaking protocol. And so the most obvious drop was from centralized exchange.
00:30:16.258 - 00:30:40.088, Speaker C: So if you like, put back all the category. And so you could pretty much see that, yeah, if you put all of them back, you can kind of see the drop or basically the amount that restaking absorbed are mostly from a centralized exchange and maybe some of the staking protocols. So I wonder if you know, more dynamics of why that happens and if that's true, that it's asset moving from one type to the other?
00:30:40.186 - 00:31:20.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. This has to do with how Eigen layer works as a protocol, and it accepts two different things. It accepts native eth that they restake for you, and they also accept liquid staking tokens. So this includes stuff like rocket pools, lidos and others binances, various different lsts. The only thing is they capped those. So you can only restake so many lsts before it reaches a cap. And they gradually increase this cap in that process.
00:31:20.080 - 00:32:10.810, Speaker B: Some protocols were created that were liquid restaking protocols. So kind of like liquid staking, except they also restake it for you. The major ones being Ethify and Renzo. I think these are the biggest in terms of dominance in restaking. And at first they accepted liquid staking tokens, but eventually, because of the cap. And since people kept wanting to stake more through those, they had to, for you, convert these lsts into ETH and then restake it for you. And that's why some, if you look, you also have liquid staking that lost a bit of stake since earlier that year, which is really when Eigen layer took off.
00:32:10.810 - 00:32:54.230, Speaker B: In terms of TVL, it's like since the three first month of this year was really the big piece. And also central exchanges also lost, but they've been losing in terms of market share for a while, which I think is a good sign. Ideally, I'd want that ETH going towards decentralized protocols. So, yeah, overall good signs. And yeah, it's already at 7.9%, which is really impressive, I think. But you also have another interesting thing is if you look at inflows for liquid restaking, you see that it kind of like, it kind of died down lately.
00:32:54.230 - 00:33:37.256, Speaker B: And my hunch here, of course, is that all major restaking protocols alongside Eigen layer have all announced the details of their tokens and how they will be airdropped. And of course, many people were farming this. So it has led to a decrease in terms of inflows. But I think eventually we'll have the, you know, the APR of staking through Eigen layer actually be such a big incentive that people will, you know, that inflow will start again to pick up. That's my hunch. But of course, it's more of a guess than anything interesting dynamic.
00:33:37.440 - 00:34:58.345, Speaker A: So, to summarize that, a lot of the, you are saying a lot of the demand in liquid staking tokens and then kind of this liquid restaking category that was basically just fueled by Eigen layer came from the Eigen layer points and the Eigen layer airdrop program. And now that that's done, we're kind of seeing outflows out of the category. But long term they might come back because eiglayer actually offers more rewards for not only securing Ethereum consensus, but also securing other things. And that is actually not a bad intro to Eigen layer. All of ETH consensus is basically like it's an economic game, right? Like you stay capital, you get rewarded for staking your capital and kind of like performing services by validating the ETH chain. And what Eigen layer has basically done, they've designed a system in which you can not only use your ETH to validate the ethereum chain, but rather you can also stake that ETH, or use that staked ETH and restake it to also validate something else. So how that works is basically Eglare has a bunch of operators, and those operators accept stake from stakers.
00:34:58.345 - 00:36:01.438, Speaker A: So if I go to Eigen layer and I stake etH, I can then choose an operator to actually kind of like delegate. I think delegate is the word they use. Delegate my eth, my e stake to. And then that operator has kind of economic control over my ETH. So I trust them with doing whatever additional services they take on with like, I don't know, diligence, maybe that's a good word. So they don't get economically punished, and they kind of like keep it in good custody, let's put it that way. And then this operator network, why would this exist? And it's like this exists because there's services who basically have the same problem as Ethereum, where it's like we want to validate something with an economic stake at play so we can be sure that the actors in the system are honest and they need the angular operators.
00:36:01.438 - 00:36:55.968, Speaker A: So the Eigen layer operators, in this case, kind of like, you can kind of think of it like in Ethereum, that there's so Ethereum consensus class, Mev Boost, or for Solana, there's the Solana G two client, so they get additional yields for performing those services. So if we track back through the chain, I'm staker, I want more yield. So what do I do? I delegate my Eth to an operator. That operator takes on additional tasks from an AV's, which is actively validated services. So my operator participates in securing the consensus of that actively validated service. And in exchange for that, my operator that I stick to puts my eth up for kind of like as economic security deposit, if you want to put it that way. And then we have this AV's layer which is different services.
00:36:55.968 - 00:38:07.226, Speaker A: I think the kind of easiest way for everyone to understand this would be like, we could use an AV's to secure rollup. So right now, most rollups work with one centralized sequencer, and we could decentralize that sequencer by having the operators, through an actively validated service, perform a series of operations that actually decentralized the operation of that sequencer. So I think cello wants to eventually switch to be an optimist network or like a part of the super chain. The initial proposal was that they're going to use AWS or AV's secured decentralized sequencer. And like, all of this jazz, they basically, like, they played like a buzzword bingo. It's like, oh yeah, we're going to be like a part of the super chain with like an idea, validated data availability, blah, blah, blah. But anyways, I think this idea is super cool because basically, like, you can use the economic stake of Ethereum to also do the economic security of Ethereum, or like, of those Ethereum validators, to be specific, to also validate other things.
00:38:07.226 - 00:39:06.946, Speaker A: But now kind of trouble ahead. And of course, a lot of people in the ecosystem were unhappy about this because you don't want to overload the consensus, you don't want to have your eth that usually should only secure Ethereum. And it's like, oh yeah, this secures the world's most secure defi and like, I don't know, probably the most trusted chain in the world that was like billions of TVL and like so many actual real world, or like, not real world applications, but like, you guys know what I mean? Ethereum is like the network where like, if you want to build something that you think should be around in ten years, you would probably choose Ethereum nowadays. So it's like to have the consensus of that chain be kind of captured or also like this kind of a codependency with like the Eigen layer network where now the operators of the Eigen layer network can take on the validation of some, like, of cello. And then there's, now there's a correlation between the security of cello and between the security of Ethereum. So like, big trouble. Like, nobody liked that.
00:39:06.946 - 00:39:55.906, Speaker A: So now last week, the Eigen layer token dropped, and they kind of like, put this under the big, the big word of intersubjective work talk, which is like, everyone on Twitter was like, we don't like this. This is like, what the fuck are you guys talking about? But I think like, if you break this down, it's like I don't know. I think that, like, a lot of other, like, podcasts that I listen to was just like, very botched communication and then, like, the problems with the airdrop at the same time. So I think the token design is actually, like, beautiful, and it's like, very, very cool. So basically, what we need to go into, like, a bit of a philosophical mode for a second where it's like, there can be objective faults and there can be subjective faults. So, like, if I. What's the best restaurant in Paris? Like, that's a very subjective thing.
00:39:55.906 - 00:40:41.698, Speaker A: Like, there's no, there's no right or wrong answer. We can't really stake eth on that question. Like, that would be stupid. What, what we can stake eth on is, did this EVM code get executed correctly? There's like a very, there's a determination determinism in the system where we can very objectively say something's wrong or something's false. And then between those two poles of, like, subjective work and objective work is, there's like something that Eichlayer calls intersubjective. The example they give on the website, for example, is the price of bitcoin is $1. And then this is a, this is kind of like an inter, subjective question where, like, depending on where you stand in the world and depending on what your environment is and depending on the context you have, this could be false or wrong.
00:40:41.698 - 00:41:25.514, Speaker A: But in the end, if you have a kind of network of active. How do they call this exactly? Intersuke defaults can usually be resolved by broad based agreement among all reasonable active observers of a system. Let's take a chaining node, for example, that reports the bitcoin price is $1. There's like, maybe for that chain link node, that is true. Maybe, maybe it only looks at something like, maybe it looks at Creighton circa 2016, where like, the, the matching algorithms were all fucked up all the time. Maybe for that note, it's true. But then you go into the broader world and there's more context, and there's a bunch of other nodes which are reporting actually the bitcoin price is, I don't know what it is today, 64,000 or whatever, probably less, but that's not the point.
00:41:25.514 - 00:42:45.202, Speaker A: So you guys can kind of see how there can be an objective fault, there can be a subjective kind of truth or fault, and then there's something which kind of depends on the context. So this is what eigenlayer is trying to so bridge the gap to this Eigen layer system. Now they are saying that ETH is going to be used for objective, for something that can objectively be kind of judged whether it's true or false. So like in the case of, in the case that I mentioned earlier, where it's like we are validating the cello consensus, we're probably going to put up Ethereum at stake, actually, then I think this is going to be very much operator dependent, where what kind of risks do I want my operator as a staker to take on? And then there's going to be natural competition and kind of like there's a bunch of different parameters which basically decide what happens with the system. But now for anything that is intersubjective or where the answer is something wrong or false, it's not so easily found as did somebody calculate this code correctly or did somebody execute this code correctly? So, for example, I don't know, let's actually take the oracle example of Chainlink notes. Did somebody report the price correctly or not? There you wouldn't stake ETH on that, but rather you would stake the Eigen token. And that's why it's called the inter subjective work token.
00:42:45.202 - 00:43:40.034, Speaker A: And basically what all of this is, this is way to not overload Ethereum's consensus. So I think a lot of people in the ecosystem should actually, I think the broader ecosystem sounds, from the reasonable voices that I've heard, everyone is like, this is actually a really good solution for the problem that we had before where we don't want to overload the Ethereum consensus with, I don't know, like validating doge chain or something like this. So now there's going to be a dual token system. And basically if you are running an AV's, the actively validated service will charge fees, right? Like, let's say the validate cello. So cello is going to pay them in cello tokens. And then part of that stake will probably go to the ethereum that is at stake. And then another part of this will go to the eigen that is at stake.
00:43:40.034 - 00:44:49.074, Speaker A: So we'll have a dual staking system, and you can stake both Eigen and you can stake Ethereum in the Eigen layer system. And then the operators will probably decide the allocation of what do I actually stake, where and how does that all work? But that, just as a short summary of this whole system is, we're going to use ETH for the, I want to say, more bulletproof stuff and more objective stuff. And this is what Eigen Layer says. Ethereum is going to become the universal objective work token. Eigen is the universal inter subjective work token. And what is inter subjective work? And what is subjective work and objective work? That's kind of a philosophical idea, I hope. I did a kind of okay job with trying to explain this, but yeah, this is basically like in the future we're going to live in the world where if you're an Ethereum staker, you can delegate your staked ETH to an operator, which then is working for a bunch of actively validated services in the eigenlayer network and can kind of generate yield for you.
00:44:49.074 - 00:45:11.094, Speaker A: So for example, like, I don't know, verifying some AI computations or like doing machine learning or doing like all bunch of stuff where you need some kind of guarantee that the calculations that some, somebody in the system is doing are correct. So yeah, that would be my Eli, let's say, 18 of the IC layer system.
00:45:12.994 - 00:45:38.122, Speaker B: It's good. Yeah, I think it's. Yeah, it's like, it's one of the more complex token designs I've ever seen, and one of the more interesting even, because most tokens are, I mean they're governance, but otherwise mostly unproductive. And this eigen feels like an actual like really interesting development, I think, in the ERC 20 world.
00:45:38.258 - 00:46:20.056, Speaker C: I have a question. So what does the restaking protocol do? Say, you know, like, so I understand that for liquid staking you are depositing ease to Lido, and Lido can basically deposit those ease into beacon chain and try to RoM alligators. And then they get rewards and they distribute to the users. But then for restaking protocol they are getting, say, already liquid staking tokens. So it's like Lido eth or Rocketpool eth. But then where do they get the money to, like first of all, do they then stake some ease into beacon chain and actually round validators? Or if so, how are they converting those deposits into, I think.
00:46:20.080 - 00:46:50.794, Speaker B: Well, they mostly accept ETH itself in the first place. But yeah, they have also lsd. The way it works for native ETH is you change your withdrawal address to an eigenpod so that your rewards are accumulated to a smart contract that is tied to eigen layer, essentially. And that is, that is how you delegate for lsts. I'm not too sure. You just. I think it's, it's a pool where you put your lst.
00:46:51.094 - 00:47:25.894, Speaker A: You give up economic control over the liquid restaked ETH the moment you, you like deposit into, into the pool. So like if you delegate that to some operator and the operator gets slashed, like because they fucked up and they take, they take your, like, they take ETh from the operator, and then by proxy they take Eth from you. So, like, but yeah, with the. With the native Eth. Like, as Toby said, like, you, you actually give up control of the. Like, you need beacon EtH to. You already need to be validating the chain to be stake with.
00:47:25.894 - 00:47:39.574, Speaker A: You can't just go there with your kind of native eth. So that's actually how etherfy and everything. Like, that's how they came to existence, because they are just spinning up a bunch of eigenpots for you, basically, and they're taking over the validation.
00:47:39.734 - 00:47:56.794, Speaker C: I think my question was more like, say, okay, the restaking protocol, what they get is really just liquid staking token. And how are they converting those liquid staking token into eth value? Like, where do they get the money they stake into EtH?
00:47:58.374 - 00:48:10.324, Speaker B: It's a good question. I'm not exactly sure how it works for LST, to be honest. Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not sure how they put the lsts to work. I need to look into it.
00:48:10.784 - 00:48:31.000, Speaker A: So you just need the economic value. So as long as you have economic control over the stake, then you can set up that stake. And it's not like you can move in and out of Eigen layer. There's also a withdrawal queue and everything. As long as Eigen layer has the economic control. Like, they only. They only need that they don't.
00:48:31.000 - 00:48:47.000, Speaker A: Like. It's actually like, kind of a few levels separated from the actual, like, validation of the east chain. So, like, Lido, like, let's. Let's run through the example of, like, Lido doing something. Like you. I deposited into Lido. Let's say I take five eth, deposit that into Lido.
00:48:47.000 - 00:49:03.346, Speaker A: Lido has, like, their operator network or like, their validator network. So, like, maybe it blends with. I think Deutsche telecom does some validation for Lido. I don't know. Let's just say that for hypothetical. So then I get my restaking token. So now I have Steth staked Eth.
00:49:03.346 - 00:49:38.106, Speaker A: I put that into Eigen layer, and with that, I've given up economic control. Now, Eigen layer is actually like, they have custody of this. So then I delegate my state eth to an operator. Now, the operator, by extent, is like, kind of responsible for DDS, but it's still, like, in custody of the whole kind of eigenvalue ecosystem. The operator goes and validates something for one of those AVss in exchange for. For some tokens or some rewards. My operator fucks up the operator that I delegated to, now my operator gets slashed.
00:49:38.106 - 00:49:58.498, Speaker A: Part of, like, what, what they get slashed is proportionally what, what I've delegated to that validator. So, so, like, there's no connection. I guess there's some connection. This is actually. So wait, I get slashed. My staked ETH balance in the Einlayer contract decreases.
00:49:58.666 - 00:50:00.418, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question.
00:50:00.466 - 00:50:21.734, Speaker A: I don't know how this is. Well, like, yeah, but wait, no, I just lose my staked ETH. The staked ETH is still somewhere. Like, it doesn't get withdrawn from the, from the beacon chain, it changes. Like, it doesn't get destroyed. It just like, changes owner inside of the system. So now some other operator in the eigenvalue system.
00:50:21.734 - 00:50:55.574, Speaker A: I don't actually know where this version goes. So, like, I would assume that whoever is like an honest participant of the system then gains a share of my state Eth. The ETH consensus. I think it's just like, if there's like too many things going on, and then like, eventually you get like a kind of pyramid system where like, if like, something breaks down, then, like, a bunch of other parts of the system will also break down. But I think there's enough separation from the actual ETH validation that it's not that bad. Does that make sense? Yeah. Very complicated topic.
00:50:56.794 - 00:51:19.390, Speaker B: We can touch on how big Eigen layer is. I'll share a dashboard and how much it's accumulated in stake. I think this is interesting to give a proxy for how big of a protocol it is. It is pretty big. So it has like 5 million ETH in control. There's 3.2 in native ETH and 1.6
00:51:19.390 - 00:52:31.282, Speaker B: in lsts on Eigen layer. One thing I'll say is you have like two issues with June dashboard reporting on Eigen layer. There was one issue a couple days ago where Eigen was claimable, and since people didn't look for specific tokens when it was transferred out, it looked like on media dashboard, look like state ETH was transferred out when it really wasn't. But that is, I think, mostly fixed by the biggest dune dashboards. This is probably the one, I think, in terms of likes. And another issue, which I think isn't currently fixed, is that for liquid staking tokens, the way they work is they usually have a rebase event, so that when you hold so ste, for example, daily there's an event where your amount, your balance is slightly increased to account for the yield that was generated during that day. So every day there's a rebase event and usually in data rebasing tokens are just a pain to deal with.
00:52:31.282 - 00:53:19.626, Speaker B: And most account for transfers but not rebase events, meaning that over time those balances, TvL metrics, will increasingly get inaccurate, you know, as per the yield that was generated and not accounted for. So that's just one thing I'll guess, caveat when looking at these metrics. For now, it should be fairly negligible in terms of change, in terms of difference. But I think it's worth keeping in mind, because over time that percentage will grow. And I have some work in progress tables for rebase events I'll try to put out in the next couple days so that people can use and get more accurate metrics there. But yeah, just I guess more of a data people caveat thing to know.
00:53:19.770 - 00:54:02.206, Speaker C: Yeah. I'd be also looking at these dashboards. So like for example, this is just the same charts I forked from that dashboards. And you can see that if I label those, how to say protocol name out, you can see that Etherfi is the biggest one and then renzo the second highest, and then puffer is the next one, and then kelp Dao. And the other way to look at it is the distribution of token. And this is kind of confusing as well. If you compare, say that, you know, the first chart on the left, which is showing the total TVL of Eigen layer, like break down by the east, go through Eigenpot directly or LST.
00:54:02.206 - 00:54:33.750, Speaker C: And so it shows like a 5 million total. But then like on the breakdown of the Eigen layer restaking by protocol, it's around 3 million. So I think the difference here is that the amount people are staking directly towards Eigen layer's website. I think that is not accounted in this breakdown. So that looks like around like a million or two ish. There, there is this, you know, like 3 million of all the other restaking protocol. That's staking into Eigen layer.
00:54:33.750 - 00:55:16.624, Speaker C: And there is another part that people are directly staking into Eigen layer. That's me for example. And so, you know, it's kind of confusing that you are accounting basically all the restaking protocols. TVL to the Eigen layer. TVL so basically Eigen layer is accumulating all the TVR into themselves, right? So and on the breakdown of the asset side, you could see, okay, so across aggregated, all these different protocol and or people who are staking directly on their website. These are the assets type of people are staking as a collateral. So like it doesn't necessarily mean, it's directly, you know, this person staked this token or that it's like aggregated across based on whatever eiglitre accepts.
00:55:16.624 - 00:56:06.206, Speaker C: So yeah, it's kind of like, yeah, very complicated to figure out all these concepts and few other dashboards. I've been looking besides, the main one you showed earlier is this one from hemistats. And I think he provided a lot of interesting metrics which can somewhat provide aspects of the risks of all these restaking layers stacked up together. Cause like, in my opinion, this feels very familiar. Like the DeFi Lego back in 2020. Like when, remember, like when yarn finance came out and there was like a very popular way of playing stacking up your yields is by staking your money into curve and put that into the curve eth or whatever. I forgot, what's the token into yarn again.
00:56:06.206 - 00:56:46.334, Speaker C: And so you're stacking up, you're compounding their Ethernet yields, but you are also compounding the risk. And so there was, then there's a DeFi insurance protocol like Nexus mutual. I think they're also even insuring for the restaking protocol these days right now. So like, it's basically saying, okay, if one of whatever layer of the protocol rugged or have like a risk, a smart contract risk, and they're say, money get basically hacked, you might get some, you know, money back from the insurance protocol, etcetera. It's like, right now, okay, eigen layer, it accepts native ease. It also accepts like liquid staking ease. It even accepts some restaked assets.
00:56:46.334 - 00:57:40.410, Speaker C: Like for example, one of the protocol they accept, or, sorry, the collateral they accept is origin ease. And origin themselves is a restaking protocol that accepts lido ease and eth. So it's like you're stacking up and kind of like double spending or triple spending eth. So it's like, is it also maybe like diluting the security guarantee from ease? It's is my question. So yeah, back to this dashboards, I think like it provides a bunch of like, you know, economic wise metrics. For example, he looked at the total TVL on amms where all these like, you know, stake how to say liquid or restaked how to say east assets, how much TBR are on different amm pools. And so it could mean the liquidity depth in the markets for these assets.
00:57:40.410 - 00:58:44.410, Speaker C: And some other popular metrics would be like basically, what's the market rate? Or basically, I wouldn't call it like the de pegging or pegging rate because it's not really a pegged asset, but like maybe call it like the liquid restaking market ratio towards eth. They're supposed to be one to one, maybe with some rebasing ratio or something. But if you're seeing in the markets, in the Dex trades volume, there is much less how to say, if you can exchange with the restaking assets, then that means this asset is like, you know, below the market ratio. And, like, you're trading it with a discount or when it's higher, I think you would call it as like trading with a premium. So that's another indicator of, like, if this asset is economically stable right now, and if this ratio is going off the charts like, crazy, like, say now with like, the liquid restaking token, you cannot sell it for almost one ease. You can only sell it for like 0.1 ease.
00:58:44.410 - 00:59:32.056, Speaker C: It's almost like a deep event, right? So your money becomes, like, valueless. So, yeah, I think a lot of the question I have right now remaining for the restaking protocol is the risk part. So, like, there is token economics risk. There's smart contract risk. There is also potentially, like, governance risk. For example, if someone holds a lot of the restaking and they can, like, withdraw, like, pool from somewhere, would that cause any, like, events? And now I've seen also, like, there's governance proposals on DeFi protocol, like Aave and compound to include, like, pools, like restaking assets. So, meaning, like, there's now defi composability for these assets.
00:59:32.056 - 01:00:11.916, Speaker C: And so now people can basically stake their liquid restaking token and borrow, say, eTH out or USDC out from those deFi lending protocols. So that's even more crazy. Like, say, okay, so if any of these token assets, like, dropped, the price dropped, and you're below collateral ratio, and now you're getting basically liquidated. And so would that cause, like, liquidation events, like a bank around risk, et cetera, on deFi? That's a lot of problems. I think. I think another biggest one is the slashing, which is not even alive right now in Eigen layer. So, yeah, that's pretty much it.
01:00:11.940 - 01:01:03.598, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the risk, like smart contract risk is the reason why we have capped lsts. My guess is they want to obviously mitigate that risk and make sure it's not out of control, and they have full control over the caps, keep raising them over time. And if you look at this, I think there was a chart I saw on your screen earlier that was in this dashboard where you could see the LST TVl increase very incrementally in sudden, sharp moves. And that was when they changed the caps. But they usually get filled up extremely quickly because people want to render their assets. Even their LST is even more productive if they can.
01:01:03.686 - 01:01:13.894, Speaker A: But we'll see if they still follow up now that Eigen is announced and it's non transferable. And I don't know. There was a bunch of unhappy airdrop farmers after the airdrop.
01:01:14.054 - 01:01:24.382, Speaker B: They even like to answer the unhappy farmers. They even, like, the next day say, we're gonna give you 100 eigen more to basically almost everyone, I think.
01:01:24.518 - 01:01:43.134, Speaker A: Yeah. Which actually now, like, rewards sibyls a lot, which is really stupid. So now if you deposited, I don't know, what's their minimum, but even, like, one eth or something now you actually, like, have a yield of 15% or something like that. So, yeah. Pretty weird decision to listen to the Internet mob.
01:01:43.514 - 01:01:52.414, Speaker B: I have a chat crime to share. If this. If this join shares this, like, I don't know, fire him.
01:01:53.154 - 01:01:57.174, Speaker A: Don't let the design team design anything that has math in it.
01:01:57.474 - 01:01:59.620, Speaker B: I don't know what's wrong.
01:01:59.802 - 01:02:00.712, Speaker C: What's wrong here?
01:02:00.768 - 01:02:01.040, Speaker B: Okay.
01:02:01.072 - 01:02:02.024, Speaker C: What's wrong here?
01:02:02.184 - 01:02:05.176, Speaker B: You try to figure it out. What do you think? Could be.
01:02:05.200 - 01:02:10.792, Speaker C: Okay, look at the number that 2.5 looks too big. As in terms of ratio.
01:02:10.888 - 01:02:25.996, Speaker B: Look at the 30%. 25. It's like, oh, yeah. Just weird. Like, I don't even know how, like, someone can validate this and says, like, obviously this is gonna get, like, some backlash. And so they redesigned it and changed the website afterwards. But it's interesting.
01:02:26.060 - 01:02:26.820, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
01:02:26.892 - 01:03:23.378, Speaker B: I don't know. Yeah, that was bad. And also, I think another thing I want to share is the restaking scene is about to potentially get more interesting, especially since all this tv out quite like, it's a very successful product thus far, Eigen layer and NLT. So, obviously, competitors. You probably have competitors being in the work. And, like, there's a tweet yesterday by woo blockchain today actually saying that paradigm, alongside some lido founders, are working on a competitor called symbiotic. So I think it's going to be, you know, I like it when there's competition because it means it's more interesting and everyone needs to actually put in more work rather than let things sit as they are.
01:03:23.378 - 01:03:49.986, Speaker B: So, yeah, this is true. This would be very interesting to see. And the dynamics between the two protocols, especially since Eigen layer has acquired, like, a lot of mind share. It's restaking is akin to Eigen layer in everyone's mind right now. It'll be interesting to see how a competitor tries to garner some market share, grow alongside. I can layer.
01:03:50.050 - 01:03:55.214, Speaker A: Yep. Things always stay exciting. Any last things you want to plug?
01:03:56.314 - 01:03:57.610, Speaker B: No, I think we like.
01:03:57.682 - 01:04:16.952, Speaker A: I mean, the thing is, you could go YouTube, anything. Dashboards. Okay, fair enough with that. Thank you for listening to the index podcast. I hope we could illuminate a part of the restaking landscape for you. We're going to be back with with another episode, I think, in two weeks, and. Yeah, thanks for listening.
01:04:16.952 - 01:04:18.364, Speaker A: See y'all. Bye bye.
