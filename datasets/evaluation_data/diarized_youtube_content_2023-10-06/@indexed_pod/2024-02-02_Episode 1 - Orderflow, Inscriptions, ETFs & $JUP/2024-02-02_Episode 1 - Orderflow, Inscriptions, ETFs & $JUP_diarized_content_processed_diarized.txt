00:00:01.210 - 00:00:17.230, Speaker A: Hey everyone. Welcome to Index podcast, where the three of us come together every couple weeks to discuss on chain data, chart crimes and metrics that move the crypto industry. The three of us, that is Denning, the on chain. Corgi at flashbots.
00:00:17.730 - 00:00:18.480, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:20.370 - 00:00:23.550, Speaker A: Hildoffy resident data wholesale at Dragfly.
00:00:23.970 - 00:00:24.720, Speaker C: Hello.
00:00:25.370 - 00:00:53.210, Speaker A: And me, community powerhorse at Dune Boxer. Before we start, nothing we say here should be relied upon as legal, financial, investment tax, or even life advice. We are acting independently of our respective employers, and none of the views here are the views of our employers.
00:00:55.170 - 00:00:55.678, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:55.764 - 00:01:12.722, Speaker A: With that, let's get started. Our first kind of section of this podcast will always be the chart of the week. And this week, Denning has brought us a great chart from the research that flashbots is conducting on MeV. Denning, go ahead, explain it.
00:01:12.856 - 00:02:19.770, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty excited to bring this work of me and Angela and a few others from flashbots that is trying to index the Dex trading how to say landscape and how they are tied to each other in the MEV supply chain. So two weeks ago, my teammate Angela, she shared the links for this website that we put up. Finally, after six months of work in data, and also her blog post on her opinions summarizing the whole thing. So what is orderflow art? So what we did was really trying to, how to say, connected the dots between all these players or entities that is connecting this whole Dex trading experience today. Whoever is interacting with Ethereum trying to make a trade on. So this word has been, how to say, evolving and sophisticating into so many layers and rarely I would say if you go to uniswap today, you wouldn't imagine there are so many pieces behind. So we developed two piece here.
00:02:19.770 - 00:03:20.880, Speaker B: So one view or one version is like how to measure the retail demand or traffic from the front end side. So with this version we have a few components like front end meta aggregators, solver and how did go to the public mempool or private mempool and if the user's order got into an order flow auction or not, and to which builder it landed on chain. I know there's so many jargons, so feel free to stop me anytime. And with this picture in mind, we're trying to quantify who in the Dex space has the most. For example, retail distribution power, meaning who has the most volume coming from a user end in the front end, and how potentially autos floor going into a private member, meaning all those order flow become some builders potential power. And another view is more like focusing on the liquidity side. Okay, this is a very complicated and so many details here.
00:03:20.880 - 00:04:01.846, Speaker B: This Dex trading, how to say space started with how to say OTC order or like order book model. And then we had Amm model come up and now we have aggregators who is aggregating AMM and RFQ orders. And so the liquidity side also has become so complicated with different structures. And the goal here is really trying to showcase which liquidity pool is the most dominant today and how all those RFQ system has been tangling it into each other. So yeah, I have a few, how to say view preloaded. Like for example, if you felt, can.
00:04:01.868 - 00:04:29.570, Speaker A: We really quick take a step back and kind of, we're looking at this Senki diagram and from left to right we're looking at front end to finally kind of like whoever matches the order, if you go back to retail trade volume. So maybe can you quickly walk us through what all of those individual steps are and then maybe what the players in those individual categories are? Just so we have a common frame of understanding here before diving deeper.
00:04:29.990 - 00:05:25.278, Speaker B: Yeah, so if we go from the left, you see all these major front end that we indexed. You see cowswap, you see uniswap and one inch, there are some small, how to say, segments here where we for example, segmented it one inch website default and one inch integrators. Because right now a lot of these platform, they also develop something more sophisticated called a solver model. So like one inch fusion cowswap and Uniswap X would be the three represents of a solver model. And so actually let me go by how to say from the simplest to the most complicated. Right? So today if you are trading on Dex, the simplest model would be like you go to a Dex front end and they just check all the amm liquidity pool they have and they find the best price for the user that's routing across their liquidity pool. Okay, so that's more like, just like a Amm router.
00:05:25.278 - 00:06:16.530, Speaker B: And so the next would be there are Dex aggregators where they are checking across all the Dex Amm and they're checking across those pool and then they're also checking RFQ. So request for quotes. It's a system where behind there are professional market makers waiting for the ping from the user and basically going to give you a price that they can offer. And a lot of time they can have a better price than AMM prices because they're also moving liquidity, making trades, arbitraging trades on a centralized exchange with the profits. So that would be Dex aggregator who is checking both AMM and RFQ. And now we have an even more sophisticated model where started with cowswap, they were saying, okay, I'm not going to be even the person doing the centralizing routing decision. I'm going to just outsourcing my routing to a bunch of people.
00:06:16.530 - 00:06:55.730, Speaker B: I call them solvers. And so I'm going to just say there is this user coming in with this intent of trading this pair of this side who are going to give me the best prices, and these set of solvers, they're going to basically figure out what's their routing algorithm, what's their best price they can offer. Some may have some integration with RFQ or market makers behind. Some are directly just market maker, and some could be just like really good at routing across AmM. And so now this is solar model. After cowswap, there is one instrument, there's uniswap x. And you could see like starting from the left side on front end.
00:06:55.730 - 00:07:47.822, Speaker B: Apparently uniswap is still the distribution power king, right? They have the highest count of the volume of this seven day chart. But then going down, you could see like for example, cowswap's sankey has different flow, not only from cowswap front end, but also from safe, from Defi llama's flow. So if you are measuring the power of router, it's different. It's like how many integration you have from left side, from the front end. Many other, for example, like Xerox API or like paraswap and one inch. They also have a bunch of different integrators sending flow from different front ends and then going down. If this is a solver model, you could see that there's this layer of solver information that we labeled out like resolver, the t, one inch lab, cys, et cetera, for one inch fusion.
00:07:47.822 - 00:08:42.270, Speaker B: And we will have a more clear view in separate Senki. But then you're going down. You could see in the past what we know is we all just use metamask RPC and sending towards inferior alchemy and everything goes to public mempool. But today with this chart, you can see like half of the retail trading volume actually goes through private memp pool. And how is that happening then? If you see the connection there, you can see, oh, all those private mempool volume are coming from those solver model. Because in those solver model case, it's not a user submitting their order, it's actually the server or basically the application submitting for you. So in this case, they have the control over how the order can go down the supply chain, and they will potentially probably send towards some builder endpoints or even our order flow auction endpoints.
00:08:42.270 - 00:08:47.458, Speaker B: So to avoid the user transaction being attacked by MeB in the public mempool.
00:08:47.554 - 00:08:58.310, Speaker A: If that makes sense, would that impede on their profitability if they would not send this privately? Or like, what's their incentive to do this privately?
00:08:58.890 - 00:08:59.254, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:59.292 - 00:09:56.566, Speaker B: Yeah. So first, sending to private mempool would avoid your transaction of a big trade on uniswap being, how to say, monitored by some searcher. And they'd be like, oh, I'm going to front run you or sandwiching you and sort of make profits. So sending privately can protect user from MeV to some level. Also, one thing I was going to show is here, if you look at the cowswap Senki, they are deliberately sending toward private Memport and then towards map blocker, which is a order flow auction that Cowswap team has released. So what does order flow auction do? It's a private RPC essentially, but also they have, I would say like a list of searchers who are monitoring all the transaction coming into the private mempool and trying to background you. So background is one type of mev that doesn't hurt users prices because they're basically trying to add a trade after your trade.
00:09:56.566 - 00:10:48.070, Speaker B: So to make the arb trash that coming out, how to say that your order is making the price differences from. So imagine you're a big trade user, and after your order, this pool's price going to be pushed up by so much that there is an arb trash opportunity between this pool and all the other pool that you didn't use. And then this time the backrunner, they can make a trade here. And so to just make the price the same and make profits from it. And order flow auction is more like a platform that guarantees basically the searchers is not going to harm you by front running or sandwiching you, but only back running you and also going to give you a certain percentage of refound. So like for example, Mapshare has a default setting of like 90% profits going to user. And I don't know what's the set for map blocker.
00:10:48.070 - 00:11:12.882, Speaker B: But basically here, if cowswap is forwarding their order to map blocker, they're basically sending the flow to do another check on it. Say, is there any background opportunity so potentially to add another price improvement on user, so that if user got a background, got a refund now, basically, ultimately the price they receive is better than even directly sending to the Dex and direct selling to the solar model.
00:11:12.936 - 00:12:00.718, Speaker A: Wait, can we walk this through one example? So I want to swap, let's say 100,000 die to eth. I send that, like I go to cowswap, cowswap actually sends that order. I do my request for quote on Cowswap and then from cowswap, the cowswap solvers pick that up, they send it to the private mempool. From the private mempool it goes to math blocker. The math blocker actually refunds me part of or like it kind of checks if my transaction causes any backrun mev or kind of positive externality mev. And then up to 90% of that gets refunded to me as the actual user, like small little user who's sitting at the very front of the chain. Because in the end that provides me with the best quote.
00:12:00.718 - 00:12:02.274, Speaker A: Is that correct?
00:12:02.472 - 00:12:44.058, Speaker B: Pretty much, yeah, pretty much. So some nuances there is that. For example, when you send to cowswap and cowswap is going to ping all these solvers and all these solver going to give cowswap some response maybe within like 3 seconds or 10 seconds. And then cowswap be comparing the price and be like, okay, this solver is giving me the best price and kaoswap is sending for you. So not the solver is sending, but the cowswap team is actually forwarding the. So in this case, Kaoswap team has the full control and they forward towards a basically mev blocker RPC endpoint. Like usually you send to infuriar RPC, now you're sending to their mev blocker RPC.
00:12:44.058 - 00:13:27.230, Speaker B: And now what blocker RPC does is that they're going to stream out all those transaction information actually. And this RPC streaming endpoint is actually public. So it's kind of still public. But the Coswap team does something to trying to make sure it's not that easy to be attacked. Like for example, they will simulate some fake transaction hash transaction info to mix in it. And so the searcher cannot have full certainty to be like, I'm going to spend money to front run this or something. But now with this public endpoint, any searcher supposedly can just check how to say Amev strategy, like checking back running if there is any backrunning opportunity.
00:13:27.230 - 00:14:06.378, Speaker B: If so, they'll be like, okay, I want to make this background transaction together with these users. And so I'm going to send this two transactions together as a bundle. So bundle is basically just like a set of transactions that's next to each other. And so the searcher going to forward this bundle to maplocker back, say I want to lend this bundle and then I'm also going to give user like 90% out of my profits, which is like 0.5 e. And can you help me lend this? And so map blocker going to basically forward all this bundle towards the builder. And then builder is the one in PBS like today in proposal builder, separation word.
00:14:06.378 - 00:14:16.720, Speaker B: That is like how to say merging all this bundle into a block. So yeah, that's how it goes. Well, another question.
00:14:18.210 - 00:14:31.186, Speaker C: So you've got all this data, how did you get there? Is it just tagging from following transactions or I'm guessing you also monitor the public mempool to see what transaction make it there.
00:14:31.368 - 00:15:07.838, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much. So something that's crazy is that actually all these are constructed in queries in Dune. So primarily in the beginning we were just using Dex trace table because we were like the initial idea is really just labeling the router. Basically I want to see if this aggregator is connecting to that AmM later. And later we were like, yeah, we actually can expand it to see the whole supply chain. So we integrated the mempool dumpster data set from flashbots and it's now actually uploaded on Dune. So anyone can query it just by checking if the transaction hash is in the public mempool or not.
00:15:07.838 - 00:15:58.670, Speaker B: So if it's seen in public mempool, then it went through public mempool, which that data set was like checking five different node sources. And then later we were just mapping with the map blocker data set and also the flashbot protect data set to see if that hash was ever in those of. And then we're labeling just the block in which block those transactions landed and then label the builder block. So yeah, everything is on chain actually, except the mempo part, but which also is not. Yeah, of course we have a methodology page that's like detailing all these nuances of the accounting that we do. Because for example, one big debate in Dex trading data accounting is that a lot of time, the router, they will spill it up. A pair that's pretty illiquid say you want to trade.
00:15:58.670 - 00:16:50.074, Speaker B: Actually, I guess PayPal is pretty liquid today. Let's say you want to trade like Dolby two Boxer. And then there is no liquidity provider is providing this pair in the Amm pool. So the router will have to split it up to like, I'm going to try to make a trade of Dolby to west and then west to boxer. So there got to be someone doing this pair. And in this case if you're accounting just like some of the trading volume, it will be doubled. So what we try to do is when we try to really represent what's the retail traffic or demand side, we did the deduping by just checking what's the in and out amount and then trying to just account once from the in and out, say how much amount user received or how much user sent out and the retail liquidity impact version.
00:16:50.074 - 00:17:35.226, Speaker B: So the liquidity version is fine. We don't care about the duping, we'll just sum up all those trading volumes that happened in the event log, if that makes sense, because it still represents how much liquidity that each pool is able to provide. So we have to be pretty careful about these. So yeah, I think this is very interesting that these sankey, if you filter by each project you can see those structure. Like for example, if you look at Kaoswap, it's pretty clear what does a silver model mean? Like you see all this silver winning some volume, probably because there are strengths on different trading pair. You see uniswap x is also like having different, they call it filler. So you see different filler.
00:17:35.226 - 00:18:16.630, Speaker B: And it's very interesting to know a lot of these filler are directly just labeled as market maker. So that's what we were expecting, right? Market maker is competing and winning the order on X auction. If not then it fallbacks to a dutch auction to AMM as well. And so concerning thing here is like for example winter mute has one market maker is winning over 50% of trading volume. The second and third is also market maker. And something else also interesting is that there's also a lot of nuance of how the landscape has been complicating. We know that market maker oftentimes stands behind a router.
00:18:16.630 - 00:19:13.370, Speaker B: So like for example, this Matcha Xurex example is a very clear example where you see matcha is a front end and Xerx API is aggregator. And you could see they're just routing through either Xyrex RFQ or a bunch of amm. And all these market makers are standing behind RFQ right here. I don't know why it's zoomed out, but with some new innovation projects, for example hashflow, basically they have a website, but they are primarily a, how to say, middle layer for a lot of market makers. You could see that a lot of solvers who are very small team like two people, they develop this algorithm to merge or sourcing across AmM. They don't really have a platform kind of team to talk to market maker or to talk to many market maker. And now hashflow becomes so useful as an intermediary to provide market maker quotes as an RFQ system for all those solver.
00:19:13.370 - 00:19:52.506, Speaker B: They also are behind our one inch aggregator router as well and paraswap. So that's interesting to see this structure in the landscape that's hidden. Usually something else also interesting is like you see in the past, usually market maker steins behind RFQ. But now they're so smart, they're trying to remove all the layers of know those are aggregator can potentially charge them. So you see now like SCP, just go directly to like go to the order flow owner directly and try to say, hey, just ping us. Don't ping the aggregators. And where we will have to be charged but with fee, meaning we will have to provide a less competitive price.
00:19:52.506 - 00:19:57.386, Speaker B: If you go us directly this direct integration, we probably can quote you better price.
00:19:57.488 - 00:20:00.490, Speaker A: So it's like who's SCP?
00:20:00.910 - 00:20:09.760, Speaker B: It's a MEB trading firm that also does market making, that also build blogs that also search. So yeah.
00:20:11.890 - 00:20:20.914, Speaker A: And how do you think, do you think they just reached out to Metamask and they're like, hey, just give us some of your retail flow. How do you get them to that?
00:20:20.952 - 00:20:58.510, Speaker B: I don't know how that happens, but I believe so. I think so. I think they have, with all these volume that they are covering and all these market share they have in each layer, it's very compelling with data like, hey, just quote us, we're the biggest market maker on Xerox, ARFQ, or we're the biggest market maker on it. If anyone's interested. There's like a whole methodology page to really elaborate on what's the definition and everything. We also linked all those queries. So anyone, if you're a SQL monkey or wizard, you can go and figure out, you can also use these data sets.
00:20:58.510 - 00:21:29.000, Speaker B: Also, my teammate Angela, she also posted a very comprehensive piece about all these stats as a summary and very opinionated take overall, because what we see from all this landscape is that DeFi is not really defi. It's CDFI, all these market maker that's off chain coding. And potentially that is kind of like monopolies these days, like covering all these order flow power. So yeah, very interesting stuff.
00:21:31.370 - 00:21:49.230, Speaker C: The piece by Angela is really good. I recommend people read it and even you've got even more. This is an insane amount of work, by the way. I think I don't know. For people who made dashboard, this is quite the work. And you've even got more on the front ends and other June charts embedded. It's wild.
00:21:51.170 - 00:22:07.830, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Maybe one question that kind of arose for me, is there like individual ecosystems that are kind of forming around like cowswap and then there's one inch and I guess uniswap is now. Or is this like the same teams competing in just different arenas?
00:22:08.170 - 00:22:51.630, Speaker B: Yeah, that's very interesting question. Because it's like, I mean, initially cowswaps really started this ecosystem of solver and I believe all they did was really go into all the hackathon and encourage people to do this hackathon. And later when there's more team is adopting this over model, all those people were like, yeah, oh, we can also solve on one inch. So at the end of day it's actually similar set of people. It's like a bunch of independent team of solvers plus market makers. And because all these business are similar, I would say like routing somewhat is also solving, is somewhat also searching. So for market makers, they also like to go directly towards the order flow owner.
00:22:51.630 - 00:23:15.770, Speaker B: So that makes sense for them. And they also want to be in the end of the order flow because then they have last look to how to arrange and construct their trades. So they also want to be block builder. So what we were seeing pretty much in the past recent months was like, everyone wants to be a solver, also wants to be block builder also who are probably also market maker.
00:23:17.790 - 00:23:21.306, Speaker A: Kind of horizontal integration across the landscape.
00:23:21.338 - 00:23:22.766, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah.
00:23:22.868 - 00:23:24.206, Speaker C: Okay, I see.
00:23:24.308 - 00:23:43.860, Speaker A: That sounds like centralization risks. Isn't that like one of the big critiques of tradfi, that if I trade on Robinhood, my order flow is getting sold to, I don't know, the trading firm anymore, but there's like one big trading firm who's basically like the cabal who's running all of these.
00:23:45.050 - 00:24:27.730, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's exactly the blog post was talking about. We're all going back to Tradfi and Defi, really trying to decentralize the finance. But one, I think very spicy take from there was like Uniswap X when it was about to come out, people was expecting it to be one step further to be defi, but really they kind of took a step back towards integrating market maker trades and somewhat make it a little bit CFI. So, yeah, that was a pretty spicy take there. I think it makes sense. But I would argue slightly back that user did benefit from it. Market maker was able to provide a more competitive price for users.
00:24:29.830 - 00:24:30.980, Speaker C: We don't know.
00:24:31.910 - 00:25:01.594, Speaker A: It's like a transparent version of you're getting maybe winter mute is 50% of Uniswap X or something. That's what I remember. Or the 50% of the volume of the front end or Uniswap X, I don't remember anymore. But as long as it's transparent that they are filling me for a certain quote and the system decided this way because they are just offering the best quote. And all of the Uniswap V three pools are actually like a worse option for me as an end user, then I guess that's actually like a good thing.
00:25:01.632 - 00:25:22.340, Speaker B: No entity that's on chain and so saying that's in Uniswap's hand. Maybe Uniswap be like whatever the volume comes from this market maker, I'm going to charge five bips. And then in this case I'm going to favoring the volume comes from market maker discounting it compared to amm. So that part needs to be transparent to really make.
00:25:26.870 - 00:25:32.066, Speaker A: Where does this infrastructure run today? Is it just uniswap server somewhere?
00:25:32.258 - 00:25:51.002, Speaker B: I think so. Right now any RFQ system is off chain, but overall the direction is that. I think some people were know, on chain decentralizing block building. Decentralizing, like RFQ auctioning. That will be the real optimal transparency comes from.
00:25:51.136 - 00:25:58.590, Speaker A: All right, is that hildoby, do we have any more questions for the mev order flow? Dex?
00:26:00.690 - 00:26:15.640, Speaker C: Like, I have questions, but it's like a whole other discussion on proposal builder separation and going deeper in there, I don't think it's probably not the right moment to cover it, but like a whole other episode, I think it would be cool. Yeah.
00:26:16.970 - 00:26:17.880, Speaker A: All right.
00:26:18.490 - 00:26:18.950, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:19.020 - 00:26:43.360, Speaker A: Thanks for this chart of the week and the very elaborate explanation of the same. That was really interesting. So next up, we have a couple topics. So, dobby, why don't you get us started with inscriptions and why inscriptions are still a thing and why people think that storing things in call data is the future.
00:26:44.050 - 00:27:14.354, Speaker C: That's a really good question. I think we can start by rolling back to how it all started first. And that is, let me share my screen. Okay, so that is with ordinals on bitcoin, which popped up early 2023. Late 2022. And they basically, on a really short, concise way, they're like nfts on bitcoin. And those are basically inscribed within a satoshi, which is the smallest unit of a bitcoin.
00:27:14.354 - 00:28:03.202, Speaker C: And here we can see the dashboard from data always, which is really good. And you can see how those have maintained traction throughout the year. And they keep filling a lot of bitcoin blocks and actually generating, I think, a lot of revenue towards miners. So they've been controversial because a lot of people say it's not within the ethos of bitcoin in the first place, and it's not what bitcoin was built for. But the thing is, what can happen will happen, and people are doing it, and I think miners are happy about it. So there is a positive. And previously, the whole minor revenue, I think, was solely reliant on, like, I mean, very heavily reliant on new bitcoins being created.
00:28:03.202 - 00:28:21.440, Speaker C: And this actually tips the balance a bit better towards transaction fees, also helping miners. And I think it's a lot more sustainable for the long term to have these models within bitcoin. I think it's still early to tell where we'll go from there, but it's been interesting to see that happening.
00:28:24.530 - 00:28:36.450, Speaker A: You mentioned that people have been storing images or, like, documents, but there's, like, other development where people actually start doing more programmatic use cases. Maybe you can explain those real quick.
00:28:36.520 - 00:29:18.522, Speaker C: Yeah. There's also somewhat like L2. I'm not the most familiar with how those applications on bitcoin actually work, but they essentially are trying to mimic what's happening on blockchains like EVM chains such as Ethereum, and mimicking smart contract compatibility. But it wasn't made for it, so it is all happening. The rules for indexing are all off chain. And then while the data and the metadata is posted on chain, which is the difference compared to evms, where evms, the metadata isn't always on chain. The ruling and the consensus on how those work, this is all taken off chain.
00:29:18.522 - 00:29:47.414, Speaker C: And there's the olden OS protocol, I think, that you can look into. But I think this is kind of like old news somewhat. It's not really the noble thing. Although they've been maintaining traffic so far, nothing crazy has happened. I think the leading teams are bitcoin wizards. They're also launching another collection. So there's some interesting stuff.
00:29:47.414 - 00:29:54.778, Speaker C: They raised some money last year, so there is some traction. We'll see if that keeps going and where we go from.
00:29:54.944 - 00:29:57.046, Speaker A: Taproot wizards. Do you mean taproot wizards?
00:29:57.078 - 00:30:06.974, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, tap root wizards. Exactly. And they have op cats, I think is a new thing, but I haven't read too much about it, so don't want to say anything I don't know about.
00:30:07.092 - 00:30:43.402, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think it's a stretch to say nothing crazy has happened. I think this is literally, sorry, a new market segment. Like nothing new crazy has happened. But I think in general people have found, I don't know, they've been trying to find a new use case for the bitcoin blockchain or I guess they have found and one of that was storing images. And then people started kind of like minting shitcoins or supposedly also sometimes legit coins on the bitcoin blockchain. So I think that's something pretty crazy that happened. And I think it's a giant, giant industry that has like billions in trading volume so far.
00:30:43.402 - 00:30:48.234, Speaker A: So I do think it's quite the news.
00:30:48.432 - 00:31:31.858, Speaker C: No, I agree. What I mean is that all this happened throughout the past year, but in the very recent term there hasn't been crazy developments, but they has generated like $220,000,000 worth of fees. And that's pretty wild. It's like quite a bit of traction. I'm just curious about where we go from here and I think it's worth keeping a track on this data. This is more of the intro of what I wanted to get at, which is that those have also been moving to EVM chains recently. I think in November, December 2023 that started popping up and they've been quite prominent.
00:31:31.858 - 00:32:34.974, Speaker C: And I think, well, first of all, it's kind of absurd because I think those chains have smart contract compatibilities. There's tokens that have been defined long ago and work really well and have the four indexing working properly on the blockchain. This is basically sending JSON metadata, little packet, little bit of info in JSON format on the indicator of transactions, which makes them very cheap. And that's basically the only advantage that I know of. Otherwise it's like for indexing you need to have rules that are defined off chain. Like I said before, just like for bitcoin, everything is as easy, I think, to fetch for analysts like us and for everyone building on top, it's not as easy to integrate within protocols. I mean, the blockchains were basically not made with this in mind.
00:32:34.974 - 00:33:23.622, Speaker C: It's kind of like the user who has taken the leads and is like, oh, well, this is cheaper. And it's like I can also on the short term there's probably some speculation frenzy happening. But if you look at what is happening is if we zoom back on weekly view in November and December, it really happened quite a bit. There was quite a few inscriptions. I think avalanche was the one with the most inscriptions where gas was taking like 30% in some weeks that was just inscriptions, although they're cheap, so you needed a lot of transactions for those to cost high gas amounts. And you can even see below how that affected transaction counts. So you saw some blockchain posting.
00:33:23.622 - 00:33:59.042, Speaker C: Hey, we actually had like an all time high end transactions, but it was basically all led by inscriptions. And you can see all these all time highs. So Gorali, Ethereum, arbitram, zkasync, neosys, BNB, phantom, shallow, avalanche, polygon, all these had an all time high within sometimes the last year or early this year. And it was all with almost all with like 80% plus of those transactions being encryptions. So it's like when the big wave happened. So they're somewhat easy to filter out if you know what you're doing. So you just filter out.
00:33:59.042 - 00:34:23.310, Speaker C: If you just want to look at transactions in a comparable amount to before, you can filter them out. And the reason I filter them out is because the blockchain is limited, constrained by the block space. So with them costing so little in block space and so little in gas, it's much easier to have a lot of those than a lot of smart contract based transactions.
00:34:25.250 - 00:34:25.662, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:25.716 - 00:35:00.090, Speaker C: And then lately it's still happening quite a bit I think relative to November, December. So if you look at this chart here, you can see it's down a lot. But actually it's also because this was very high. If you look within last 24 hours, goalie, which is a testnet, is having over 85% of transactions being encryptions. So here you can see this huge spike. I think it's pretty popular, or at least it was up until yesterday, was again really popular on Zksync, arbitram and some of the op chains. Based on optimism.
00:35:00.090 - 00:35:03.514, Speaker C: It kind of fluctuates. To be honest.
00:35:03.552 - 00:35:17.380, Speaker A: I don't really understand what's going on here. What are people even doing once these tokens are minted? Or I guess, is there a wallet that even supports them? What are people doing with this stuff?
00:35:17.990 - 00:35:29.446, Speaker C: I think it's very primitive for now, but maybe it seems mostly to be asian communities, which I have less of an eye on. I don't know, maybe. Danning, you have some things to share there.
00:35:29.628 - 00:35:51.422, Speaker B: Hey, I briefly scroll through those chats and it seems mean people are very excited and obsessed about it. Seems like people really made money from it and seems like they're just like minting it and trying to make profits from it. But I didn't fully understand where even the secondary markets are. Does Gorli have a inscription market?
00:35:51.556 - 00:35:54.880, Speaker C: I guess that's a really good question.
00:35:56.370 - 00:36:04.282, Speaker A: We need to know. We need to know if there's somebody out there who knows. We're all mystery.
00:36:04.426 - 00:36:16.114, Speaker C: When I was looking to them, I saw marketplaces on polygon, BNB, probably zksing. There's like some cross chain ones as well. But I don't know about testnets. I don't know. That seems mean.
00:36:16.152 - 00:36:56.930, Speaker A: Somebody can probably deploy the contracts on the need to have a whole website and everything. I don't know. None of this really seems to make sense. Maybe it kind of reminds me of NFT minting in 2021, I guess, where somebody would post a link in a group chat and you'd just be like, yeah, whatever, I'll mint this. We'll see what happens. And maybe that's the approach that most of these people can. You break down the transactions by min transfer and delete, I guess, or however else is out there.
00:36:57.080 - 00:37:33.694, Speaker C: For now, this data is all inscriptions combined. Because I think on the first thing to look at, it's probably the first bit interesting. And then you can break it down. There's transfers. Before you can have transfers, you also have mints. And before mints you also have deploy events which you create the deploy events just like you would deploy a smart contract token on an EVM chain and you define the base building blocks, basically saying, okay, this is the max supply. You can mint x per wallet at a time and what is the symbol and stuff like this.
00:37:33.694 - 00:37:47.710, Speaker C: And then once you go and mint it, I think you reference the symbol that is the identifier for the encryption. You define how many you're minting and stuff like that. And then there's transfers.
00:37:48.610 - 00:37:57.830, Speaker A: Of course, the call data needs to be structured in some kind of way. But have you looked at the data of how much of this is mints and how much of this is transfers and how much of this is just.
00:37:57.900 - 00:38:28.318, Speaker C: I haven't looked within the past few weeks, but I looked late last year and it was still overwhelmingly mints. It was basically almost all mints. But yeah, I think I would expect we can look back at this next week or sometimes, but I think maybe transfers are on the rise. Hopefully that would be the sound development where there's marketplaces and stuff happening like this. But yeah, I don't have much a.
00:38:28.324 - 00:38:33.780, Speaker A: Picture there because a sign of maturation in the shitcoin market. Let's go.
00:38:34.630 - 00:39:06.102, Speaker C: There's also something you take for granted is like all the smart contracts, you can't have fake events right here. Anyone can put anything with the call data. So when you're indexing, you have so many edge cases. All the possible edge cases you can think of, they're there. And that's also why if you look on, even on June, ordinals haven't been really properly indexed yet, although that could be done. But it's like there's so many edge cases. Try to look into it and I'll have it eventually.
00:39:06.102 - 00:39:25.380, Speaker C: But it's quite a piece of work. Like we talked about before, I'm not really familiar with a lot of people who use those, so it's kind of hard to really get a sense of what is going on other than looking at transactions on the blockchain. Who are those people? What are they doing with it?
00:39:27.910 - 00:39:42.254, Speaker B: Yeah, one ridiculous argument I saw was like, because there is no smart contract, then it's more secure or safe, as they say, because there's no contract vulnerability and there's no rock. So I don't quite understand that.
00:39:42.312 - 00:39:43.014, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:39:43.212 - 00:40:12.320, Speaker A: But there's also no composability. You can literally do nothing. Can I put up a BRC 20 as a collateral in another? I don't think so. How would that ever work? Yeah, it's a strange world. We would be really interesting to talk to someone who actually knows what's going on, but I think those people are far and few in between. And yeah, we'll see if we ever learn more about this.
00:40:13.490 - 00:41:04.500, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just like ordinals, I think we need to monitor it because I don't think it's going to go away for good. I think there will probably be some use case we haven't thought of that makes sense. I think one thing that could be cool is like for mints and how, I don't know if you remember the other side. Mint from ugalabs, which clocked the whole blockchain. Basically all of Ethereum was like crazy high fees and no one could use it. It was like one Ethereum to pay for gas throughout that day, which was crazy for minting mechanics, since you can actually limit per transaction the number of mints you can have in a much more precise way. It's kind of complicated in how it works, but basically there's different mechanisms that could allow for different things to happen.
00:41:04.500 - 00:41:23.942, Speaker C: Eric wall did a thread on this in December and I think it was pretty interesting. I don't think we're even close to seeing those new use cases for now. It's just like speculative frenzy from what I can tell. But maybe we'll get there at some point and there's some interesting things that come out of this.
00:41:23.996 - 00:41:36.538, Speaker A: So you're saying, like, just leaving something in call data as like, a method of signaling that you want to mint something in the future, basically, for the.
00:41:36.544 - 00:42:13.350, Speaker C: Mint distribution, and then you can migrate to an actual ERC 20 or ERC 721 or whatever. But for the initial distribution, if you look at past mints, it's been very, well, heavy in terms of how it's distributed. It's not as easy to participate for retail. Who just wants to mint wine or something? So I think this has some potential. This is more, like, theoretical right now than anything. I don't think you can see anything of this kind of happening on chain right now.
00:42:13.500 - 00:42:20.970, Speaker B: Speaking of. Sorry, I wanted to transition to the bitcoin ETF.
00:42:21.950 - 00:43:30.574, Speaker C: Oh, right, yeah. So, on another topic, which is a bit more recent, I looked into bitcoin etfs, which were approved by VSCC on January 10, I believe, of this year. And since then, there's been ten different bitcoin etfs which have gone live. One of them is Grayscale's GBTC, which is actually converted from the trust that they had before, since, I believe, sometimes earlier in mid 2019. And I wanted to track those on chain because I think that's the interesting bit relative to other ets, where you can only see what is being reported, but here you can actually look into the addresses and see what is going on, what are the flows, and there's some interesting bits there. So, first of all, most of those, nine out of ten of those have not disclosed their addresses, only bitwise has, which I think is a really cool move to do. And it's a good.
00:43:30.574 - 00:44:14.750, Speaker C: Like, if you use the blockchain, you might as well prove that the assets are there. Especially, like, in the wake of. We had FTX still a few months back, and it was all about proof of funds not really being there. If it was there, people would have been aware about this much earlier. So I think proof of funds is generally something that a lot of custody platforms should be forced into disclosing, but we are not there yet. So I think I appreciate bitwise's effort to disclose this. And for the rest, Arkham has shared the addresses they found for all the others.
00:44:14.750 - 00:45:13.986, Speaker C: They did it for Grayscale, I think, in September last year, and they shared that it was one of the biggest bitcoin holders at the time. And I think, like, seven out of ten of those are using Coinbase custody. And so they have a specific way the flows between wallets work. And basically, for grayscale, there's like, ten new wallets that are created per day, and there's a specific flow. So I believe Alchem has systems where they monitor this automatically and automatically tag new addresses. I want to eventually work towards a system where I have this publicly available and having this heuristics based identifier in a query. I haven't gone there because I'm not as familiar with bitcoin data as with EVM data, but I think it's something we can eventually have, and that would be super cool.
00:45:13.986 - 00:46:07.874, Speaker C: There's also obviously what I mentioned before of Coinbase custody, or the issuers of those etfs providing all addresses some way through an API or whatever, because unfortunately, it's not like bitwise has a single address. I think Vanek as well, Franklin Templeton and wisdom tree as well. But the rest, they keep creating like ten new addresses per day. So I've been adding addresses like multiple times a day to this query, which for now has like 2000 different addresses. And that's how I track everything in my dashboard. Wait, you can't see when I click, wait, share this tab instead. So here is the query, and you can see all the 2000 or so addresses that I've tagged so far.
00:46:07.874 - 00:46:34.986, Speaker C: But yeah, I keep on appending new addresses. I even have people reach out saying, hey, you're missing this address. Can you add this one? Can you add this one? Which I think is pretty cool. So collaborative work and then. So, yeah, other than disclosures in terms of data, there's something pretty cool that I wanted to share. Let me see which tab it is.
00:46:35.088 - 00:46:56.962, Speaker B: Before you move away from this. Dash, maybe. Newbie, question. So how does this work? I thought all these are issuers of bitcoin ETF. And so, meaning they are buying bitcoin and they're having this thing you can buy on their website as bitcoin ETF, or can you buy it on chain or it's more like just the exchange you buy on their platform.
00:46:57.096 - 00:47:42.106, Speaker C: It's like a way for tradfi to have access to bitcoin. So the financials products like this, you can get exposure to it. You can get exposure to bitcoin on those now using those issuers, which was previously not really possible. It's just basically bringing bitcoin within tradfi rails and for people to be able to leverage it within currently existing products for us. That's my understanding, yeah, these are all us issuers. There's actually, like, ets from other countries that were approved by other countries, but they're much smaller. I don't know about bitcoin.
00:47:42.106 - 00:47:58.760, Speaker C: I think Ethereum has some. I'm guessing bitcoin must have as well, but I know way less on those. But they've been approved in other countries. It's just that us is a big part of the market. That's why it's so important.
00:47:59.210 - 00:48:14.060, Speaker B: This flow chart though, it seems like grayscale is all outflow and all the other are like, inflow. Does that mean the others are all like buying in yet? And the grayscale is selling pretty good already.
00:48:14.670 - 00:49:13.390, Speaker C: So grayscale is like. It has a bigger history to it, and it was a thresholding before it was born in sometimes in 2019, and what you will see. So here are the holdings of grayscale addresses. So you can see them increasing in terms of amounts up until February 2021, where it kind of stalls and then slowly bleeds for a few years up until now. And the reason why that is, is if I share this tab, is because it was not trading at exact value for bitcoin. So when it was trading at a premium, everyone wanted to redeem them and wanted to mint some more, essentially. But once it started trading below bitcoin's net asset value, no one wants to take some new ones anymore.
00:49:13.390 - 00:49:25.280, Speaker C: So that's why you see how it perfectly matches the premium to nav charts here. Is that clear?
00:49:25.650 - 00:49:28.020, Speaker B: What is a premium and what is super interesting?
00:49:29.270 - 00:50:17.890, Speaker C: No, there's a premium on the price of the ETF relative to the price of bitcoin. So if it's like positive, you want to hold GBTC because that means now it's more valuable than the amount of bitcoin it's tied to. But once it's the opposite, no one could. How do you say? There was no outflow for it, but people were stuck holding it up until it was finally approved for conversion for an ETF on the 10 January this year. And that's why you see on the very. I don't know if you can see here, but on the very last part of this graph, you can see the start of a decrease. And that's because people were starting to finally redeem those underlying bitcoins.
00:50:18.870 - 00:50:19.860, Speaker B: I see.
00:50:22.950 - 00:51:03.006, Speaker C: Redemption were quite large in flows early on, but it's starting to decrease a little for today. I still need to probably add some wallets after this, I'll go and add some new wallets. So maybe there's some things missing. But up until yesterday, up until here should be very accurate. And you can see the flow is starting to decrease also. In the same way, when the other ETFs launched, they had an early high amounts of inflow. It's starting to cool down a little, and maybe we'll reach an equilibrium where there's a more stable inflow over time.
00:51:03.006 - 00:51:53.540, Speaker C: We're still, like two weeks in, so it's hard to fully see where we'll go from here. But what's impressive is this was already mostly true with just GBTC, but it's like over 3% of all bitcoins, which is quite a bit. But it was like 1 billion of inflows over the past week. But if you exclude grayscale, if you just look at the others, like 6.3. So it is quite a bit, but it'll very likely have a long term impact on the bitcoin supply. There's actually something which is really cool, is 21 shares made dashboard, where they share all the data using on chain to. The next step, obviously, is to share the addresses, but we'll see if that ever happens.
00:51:55.430 - 00:52:01.406, Speaker A: But, yeah, there's probably some compliance reasons or something why they wouldn't want to share their addresses.
00:52:01.598 - 00:52:14.210, Speaker C: So there's some reasons here. I don't know if you can read on these. So there's dusting attacks that they are afraid of because now you need to disclose all those holdings.
00:52:14.290 - 00:52:15.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Kyc stuff.
00:52:18.650 - 00:52:29.354, Speaker C: I understand a little less on the two other points of operational security measures because I'm guessing maybe once you know the addresses, maybe you're more vulnerable. But is that really true? I don't know.
00:52:29.472 - 00:52:30.460, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:52:32.050 - 00:52:52.610, Speaker C: Geopolitical risks. I'm not too sure. Again, on. I would say the dusting attacks are probably the most annoying one because they need to disclose those assets. But obviously, I haven't worked for an ETF issuer, so I don't necessarily know the full picture.
00:52:53.510 - 00:52:55.630, Speaker A: Yeah, they probably have their reasons.
00:52:55.790 - 00:52:57.140, Speaker C: Yeah, of course.
00:52:57.690 - 00:53:24.474, Speaker A: Beat them down for it, I think, just to close the story out. So the reason why there's big outflows out of grayscale is because they have not adjusted their features to be competitive to all the other issuers. So maybe if you can switch back to the other tab real quick, I think since we've now talked about this so long, to kind of close the loop on this story. So there's a bunch of these different issuers, I think. How many is it, Dobby?
00:53:24.522 - 00:53:24.974, Speaker C: Ten.
00:53:25.092 - 00:54:01.642, Speaker A: There's ten different issuers. They all have different fee tiers, and the fee tier is basically, if they hold your bitcoin for a year, they're going to take 1.5% or 150 basis points of your money. Just for holding the bitcoin. So it's a ridiculously high fee, especially for a product that you could theoretically self custody. So a lot of people are actually kind of like taking advantage of these etfs because I think in the US especially, there's a lot of tax advantages, and it's easier to access for boomers and for corporations and all of this stuff. So they are fine to take the risk, or to take the downside of paying 0.2
00:54:01.642 - 00:54:34.914, Speaker A: or 20 basis points in fees to the issuers. So to Blackrock or to fidelity or something, just so they can use their traditional financial roads. But because grayscale already has this giant net asset value, or this giant deposits of bitcoin, I think they're just riding this out while they can. So they're like earning the 1.5% fees on 20 billion, which is. That's quite a lot of revenue. So they're slowly bleeding out.
00:54:34.914 - 00:55:22.034, Speaker A: I don't think they really care about bleeding out. And eventually, as the market reaches an equilibrium, I guess they'll also lower their fees. But for now, I think they're just like, why should we lower our fees? People are not prone to, I don't know, roll their investments around every five months. There's some active investors, what you can see here, who are actually, they're price sensitive and they've rolled around their investments, but there just seem to be a lot of people who are like, I believe that bitcoin goes up two or three x. I don't care about these 150 basis points that they're charging me in fees. Or at least that would be my assumption that this is the belief that these people are in. Or maybe it's also like a tax reason where if I convert this to a Franklin Templeton ETF, then I've technically sold my bitcoins once.
00:55:22.034 - 00:56:08.462, Speaker A: So I can't really do this without having to pay a lot of taxes. So there's a lot of diverse reasons why grayscale still has that much net asset value. In the end, it's a very weird business decisions. It's a weird state of the industry that grayscale has that big of a market share, and it's all kind of historical. And in the end, I guess you can kind of blame the SEC because they approved the grayscale whatever fund vehicle that was carrying bitcoin before, and they didn't approve anyone else, so they basically created a monopoly. So that's just the whole story to this dashboard. But I think one of the main things here is tradfi data fucking sucks.
00:56:08.462 - 00:56:18.900, Speaker A: And this is actually one of the best data sources for flows in the bitcoin etfs that we currently have. That's really cool.
00:56:19.510 - 00:56:53.326, Speaker C: I have two other points. For the first six months, all the fees are waived actually, other than for grayscale. So it's actually 0%. But this is like the long term fee that they've planned and will be defined in a bit. And actually comparing to Tratvi, I wanted to show something quickly. And basically if you look before the SEC had made it, so that you should have the transaction settle at the maximum two days later. I think it was in February 2023 that changed it.
00:56:53.326 - 00:57:20.730, Speaker C: So it was only one day later. So now you can see how these are the reported flows and those are actually matching by one day later the on chain flows. So this is like one week day later relative to the previous graph. This is from the block. I think we'll link all the sources in the description as well for people to see. But yeah, I think this was pretty interesting too, because it's like the only one where you can really see this settlement time. Wow.
00:57:20.800 - 00:57:41.338, Speaker A: So tradfi just takes a day to settle all your trades. I guess they would technically be able to do it faster, but for some reason or another it's probably more profitable or better for them to max out the time between the trade intention and actually settling the trade.
00:57:41.514 - 00:57:53.300, Speaker C: Yeah. It's also all within Coinbase custody. So technically they market as settled, but they move on chain afterwards. They just have maximum one day to do it.
00:57:55.110 - 00:58:06.070, Speaker A: I see. Maybe there was one more thing. Do you have any inclination why some of these have like 1000 addresses for one bitcoin ETF? That just seems very strange.
00:58:07.130 - 00:58:34.190, Speaker C: I don't know. They keep moving addresses. I think it's like maximum 1000 bitcoin per address for Grayscale. I don't know. You'd need to know more about how Coinbase custody works. It's also a question I've had for east taking on Coinbase where they created one address for every single 32 e validator. And that was very costly and gas.
00:58:34.190 - 00:58:39.250, Speaker C: But they could have gone for one address instead and that would have been much cheaper.
00:58:39.910 - 00:58:42.770, Speaker A: I guess it's like security risks.
00:58:43.270 - 00:59:14.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm guessing it's diversifying the found security. Right. It's like if you're holding shit ton of bitcoin one address, then you're done. But then if you put them to be like small amount. Another thing is I think it might be easier for them to manage the deposits. So if you are depositing to 1000 people, then you can do it at the same time across different wallets rather than do it across a longer time from just one wallet one by one. Something like that.
00:59:14.740 - 00:59:52.220, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the interesting thing is just how it's, I'm pretty sure they're the only ones doing know other custody platforms. There's one of the etFs, which is custody by Gemini, and they have a single address, and that's it. And, well, that's much easier for analysts, obviously. So that's nice. But I don't know, what are the different implications? I'm guessing, like you say, security measures are different, but if you store, it's all about how you store access to all these addresses that matters. And that sounds very complex of a system to have.
00:59:54.190 - 00:59:57.094, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, I guess we're not the experts.
00:59:57.222 - 00:59:57.562, Speaker C: No.
00:59:57.616 - 01:00:19.250, Speaker A: Of course, if you look at the on chain data, it looks very strange. But if you think about it like, one step deeper, you're like, yeah, this might actually make a lot of sense. It's always od to encounter these things and then actually get to them. Do we have anything more to add to the bitcoin ETF saga?
01:00:19.990 - 01:00:42.460, Speaker C: No, I don't know. I think there's rumors of ECTF happening at some point, maybe. I think on polymarket, it's like a 40% bet on it happening before end of May. So we'll see if that happens. I don't know. It'll be interesting if it does. Either way, I think it's a few months away at most, probably.
01:00:42.460 - 01:00:48.620, Speaker C: Maybe that's just me having like, that's just hopeful thinking. But we'll see.
01:00:49.070 - 01:02:01.140, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see how slow or fast the SEC is in allowing these things, and they even want to allow it. So, yeah, I guess we can move on to the final story of the day, which is, I think the Jupyter Airdrop has gone live as we record this, or shortly before we started recording this. So in front of this Jupyter airdrop, there was a lot of kind of interesting comments on Twitter, and let's call it an interesting. So I do kind of take an issue with how people are comparing the trading volumes of the trading volumes and general transaction volumes of different chains to each other. Because I think fundamentally, there's economic costs associated with transactions on, especially ethereum, Mainet, and to some extent like bitcoin or something like this. And as the fee structure of a chain changes, so, like, the SVM is like, the SVM, to explain, the Solana virtual machine is very much a chain that has very low fees, so it's very easy to actually fake transactions. So I think this is almost like the chart crime of the week.
01:02:01.140 - 01:02:52.180, Speaker A: So it's not really in charts, it's actually more numbers that people are comparing here. But there's a tweet that got a lot of impressions on Twitter the other day, which basically is just a screenshot of the coin gecko top decks volume. And it shows that Jupiter has done more trading volume than unisoft v three on Ethereum. And I think fundamentally, then decrypt picked this up as a news story even. And they reported as Solana flips Ethereum in DFI trading as Jupiter airdrop years. And I think all these grand jewels had headlines. I always think you need to be careful about what you're actually looking at, because I found this beautiful dashboard on June built by decrypto space.
01:02:52.180 - 01:03:57.746, Speaker A: I don't notice creator, but it's very helpful in kind of making my point here. I think he's actually taking the seven day average of what a token swap costs. And then you can see that on Ethereum, on average, a token swap currently costs 27 80 if you actually settle on chain, on uniswap v three or something, if you use cal swap, or if you use Uniswap X. And there's a lot of factors to this, but let's just take the very basic assumption that these numbers are correct and there is a significant economic cost attached to doing trading volume on Ethereum. And then in comparison, Solana only costs you, a swap only costs you, most of the time, is actually even cheaper. I think this is currently, there's like a lot of activity happening on chain, and Solana also has local fee markets. So if you think about, you could actually spread out your trading volume between a lot of different dexes on Solana, and you wouldn't increase the global cost of transactions, but rather just the local cost would increase.
01:03:57.746 - 01:04:47.800, Speaker A: So all that is to say, it's very, very easy to fake transaction volume on Solana. And I'm not saying that this is purposefully done by some people, I'm just saying that until somebody has done the proper research, and I'm not trying to spin up some conspiracy theory here, I'm just advocating for being careful about what kind of metrics we are comparing. Because in the end, if you really think about it, a motivated actor with 50,000 in capital could, theoretically for like $500, they could really, really bump up the transaction volume, or like the Dex volume on Solana with a somewhat sophisticated setup like even if you just have 300 wallets or something, you could literally pay clickfarm in China to simulate millions of transactions for $500.
01:04:49.230 - 01:05:54.126, Speaker C: There's even on top of potential fake volume, there's also just arbitrage, which, with cheaper fees, I'm guessing market makers are feasting a lot more. And I'm much less familiar with how the Solana VM works in terms of the whole component and how the data can be analyzed. But what I know is over 50% of transactions are failing on Solana, and those are like arbitrage bots. So you could actually see those addresses that have a large amount of failing transactions. How much volume are they generating on trading on this? And then you could get actually, a sense of how much is driven by arbitrage and how much is driven probably by more like retail. So that could be at least some start to the filtering, I think, actually, Andrew, and that's the way he filtered, I believe, for retail, or quote unquote real volume. Obviously, you can always improve it.
01:05:54.126 - 01:06:17.160, Speaker C: I don't know. But filtering is hard, especially on cheap chains. It's really hard to determine if it's organic volume or if there's more to it. But, yeah, exactly. This half of the volume is basically pots, which, I mean, it makes sense. I think it is efficient. It is more efficient to have more arbitrage happening, I guess.
01:06:17.160 - 01:06:48.606, Speaker C: But it does mean that you're comparing apples to oranges a bit, because they're very different systems. It's just like the same as comparing a number of addresses, even on ethereum versus l two s, the implication of what an address is is very different, because it's just much cheaper to spin one up on l two s. And there's also farming involved for potential airdrops and stuff. So, yeah, just comparing different systems, you have to put them on equal ground before then. Yeah.
01:06:48.628 - 01:07:01.940, Speaker A: And even within the same system, if you say the trading volume in Solana last week was 4 billion, and this week it's. I don't like what, what is actually happening here?
01:07:02.790 - 01:07:03.346, Speaker C: I don't know.
01:07:03.368 - 01:07:48.226, Speaker A: Is there meme coin mania, or is there just a click farm in China somewhere that's generating a lot of clicks? We don't know. And I think as an industry, we kind of have to take steps to find more grounded metrics because everything is so easy to inflate here, especially if things have very low economic costs. TVL was like the meme of the last bull run. It seems like this bull run or this run up or whatever this is. It seems to be that people care more about actual activity metrics or like product metrics. And part of that is Dex trading volume, I guess. But now it seems like, okay, even Dex trading volume is not a metric we can actually look at.
01:07:48.226 - 01:08:01.320, Speaker A: So what's the next thing here, and how can we evolve away from these things? Even though I still believe it's a useful metric, I don't know what to do.
01:08:01.930 - 01:08:20.300, Speaker C: I think it's good to compare within the same system, comparing it to itself, like, how has that evolved, but comparing different? It's also why I'm very wary of making cross chain dashboards on whatever, because you've got to measure the implications of those and different systems and how those work.
01:08:20.990 - 01:09:21.902, Speaker B: Well, I wanted to bring this back a little bit, like, argue with you guys, though I think on Ethereum, the bots volume is also somewhat near like half of them. I don't know what's the actual overall number, but I remember back looking at just the uniswap. Half of them were like boss volume. And I think Ethereum or whatever blockchain it's designed, certainly we want to be real person usage, but it's somewhat undeniably also a financial platform where all those financial activities are going to happen. Like arbitrage is also a legit type of economic behavior, and bots are run by people. And also, actually, I think even the breakdown of the bot and person volume doesn't really tell the truth of how all the hype of airdrop can happen, because person can also do all those airdrop thing. I literally clicked through my three wallets to try to make swaps on Jupiter, but I didn't get any airdrops, so good job on them.
01:09:21.902 - 01:09:49.660, Speaker B: But I'm just saying. Not even caring about the breakdown of bots in person. But overall, airdrop is not organic needs. That is defined to be say, oh, is this blockchain serving people's daily life? And needs are like real demand rather than just the speculating behavior. So I guess maybe more organic metrics could be like trying to really differentiate what's the organic needs versus what's the speculating kind of needs.
01:09:51.150 - 01:10:23.490, Speaker A: Yeah, but how do you even. It feels like we've just built this giant decentralized casino. So what even is organic versus an actual use case of somebody in turkey paying their coffee with USDC on TrON or USDT on TroN or something. So it's all very murky. But all I was trying to say is we need to be careful of comparing apples to oranges because the economic costs are very different. So that's all I'm trying to say. I'm not saying bot activity is completely irrelevant.
01:10:23.490 - 01:11:25.254, Speaker A: It's just like, yeah, if somebody in our audience has better ideas for actually measuring these things, we are open for debate. We're up for evolving on these metrics. I just think the way it is oftentimes interpreted on Twitter, and I think that's part of what we want to do with this podcast, is actually give context as data scientists like, hey, you could literally, do you know how this is measured? And you know that this could be faked by a motivated actor with literally 50,000 of capital or more time and 10,000 of capital. So we just need to be careful, because I do think that there's bad actors in this space who are trying to make a narrative. Imagine somebody has like a $10 million long, or 10 million is not even a lot of money in this industry. So imagine if you go long, Solana, and then you just, over time, you start manipulating the Dex volumes to spike ever higher. It's like, yeah, of course, your long is probably going to be in the green after a while.
01:11:25.254 - 01:11:38.410, Speaker A: So I think that's the final point that I want to make. I think this space is almost sometimes misled by data because the data is so easy to almost fake.
01:11:39.390 - 01:12:35.680, Speaker C: I think Solana seems to be having its DFI summer moment that Ethereum had. Was it 2021? Somewhat. So just like the same type back then when after the sushi and unidrops, things starting to change a lot because now people started farming and being like, okay, well, if this is a trend, maybe I should actually start generating volume here for no reason, but maybe I'll get an airdrop someday. So that did change things. It's always tough to measure real activity until there's no incentives anymore, whether it's speculative incentive of an airdrop might be coming or actual current points system or whatever. Yeah. So it'll be interesting once things settle and there's all these that are, well, in a few days, looking back at Jupiter volume, I think could be cool.
01:12:35.680 - 01:12:36.574, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:12:36.612 - 01:13:14.810, Speaker A: But then as a counterpoint to that, I think you can't really say that speculation is not a valid use case. Do you think the volume of the Robinhood app. No, I'm just playing devil's advocate. I'm just saying the trading volume of the Robinhood app during the. What was this? The meme coin run ups in actual stocks. Not like crypto meme coins, but rather like, I don't know, what did they pump? Like GameStop and Tesla was like a meme stock for the long. So, like all of these, a lot of trading volume on financial markets, I guess, is driven by speculation.
01:13:15.790 - 01:13:17.340, Speaker C: If you really break it down.
01:13:19.950 - 01:13:27.870, Speaker A: We'Re always so high at night, like, oh, our speculations are real use case. It's like, yeah, no, not really. It's pretty fair.
01:13:28.020 - 01:13:54.134, Speaker C: No, it's more about different kinds of speculation. It's like, are you speculating on the asset itself, or are you speculating on what you could get trading on there? And you could get rewards in whatever form that is? That's what I mean. So there's nuances, I guess, to it, but they're very hard to properly define. But, yeah, we'll see how things go on the long term, I guess.
01:13:54.252 - 01:13:55.480, Speaker A: Any final words?
01:13:57.290 - 01:14:00.300, Speaker C: I think Solana is really cool, despite what we just said.
01:14:01.310 - 01:14:09.660, Speaker A: No, I love it. The trading experience is so much better than on point. Trading is actually fun on Solana. Yeah.
01:14:12.830 - 01:14:16.190, Speaker B: Reverts case when you make the swap.
01:14:16.690 - 01:14:28.260, Speaker A: I haven't traded during any busy times, but the experiences I've had so far are really good. And Jupiter is a product especially. It's actually really solid. I really like it. All right.
01:14:29.430 - 01:14:48.540, Speaker C: I was going to say just I had the Solana phone and the UX is pretty cool. I think it's kind of an eye into the future of how this whole blockchain thing could work for everyone. Having things on the phone as apps and having little to no fees makes a lot of sense. Right. And it's pretty cool to use it.
01:14:49.950 - 01:15:20.814, Speaker A: All right, go out and pre order the new Solana phone. I guess not an official endorsement. Yeah, I think that finishes our first episode. If you're still here, thanks for listening. We'll be back in sometime in the future, the next few weeks with another episode. And since this is the first episode, we'd really like feedback. So if you like this, give us a thumbs up or write us a comment below.
01:15:20.814 - 01:15:28.680, Speaker A: And if there's something you didn't like, we'd also love to hear that so we can improve for the future. Yeah. Thank you, guys.
01:15:30.010 - 01:15:33.426, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye.
