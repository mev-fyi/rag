00:00:00.320 - 00:00:14.726, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Index podcast, where we come together every couple weeks to discuss on chain data chart crimes, things that move the crypto industry. With me, I have Danning on chain Corgi at flashbots.
00:00:14.878 - 00:00:15.502, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:15.646 - 00:00:18.158, Speaker A: Hildobi, resident data house, Dragonfly.
00:00:18.254 - 00:00:19.222, Speaker C: Hello, everyone.
00:00:19.406 - 00:00:22.734, Speaker A: Andrew, our guest for today, headmaster at Dune.
00:00:22.862 - 00:00:23.758, Speaker D: Hello. Hello.
00:00:23.894 - 00:00:55.340, Speaker A: And I am boxer. And I am the community powerhouse at Dune. Before we get started properly, nothing we say here should be relied upon as financial, legal, or tax advice. We are acting independently of our employers in this podcast. And with that, today we are diving into Solana data, a topic of struggle for a lot of analysts. The Solana data landscape was a desert before Andrew brought life to it. That's why I think we're all very excited to have Andrew on today.
00:00:55.340 - 00:01:00.100, Speaker A: Andrew, maybe if you could quickly just give us a 1 minute intro into who you are.
00:01:00.220 - 00:01:30.016, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I've been in the space a couple years. I think I was part of the COVID cohort from last cycle. Started out doing hackathons with ETH global. I was very lucky that the first people I interacted with in the space was Linda, she, Austin Griffith, Trent van Epps. I did not end up in an NFT community on accident. So, yeah, learned solidity in JavaScript, spent a couple months building some contracts, realized I kind of sucked at it and hated security.
00:01:30.016 - 00:02:05.032, Speaker D: But it made doing data work a lot easier because I was like, oh, I understand exactly what's going on here. Dune is a great tool. Started putting out some dashboards, and then I think this was like January or February 2021. I wrote, like, a guide because I was like, everything I learned for data science in Web two was from tors data science on medium. And I was like, wow, there's no one writing anything about how to do crypto data. So I put out a guide, and then a lot of people liked it, and I was like, oh, okay, feels nice to be appreciated. I'll do more of this.
00:02:05.032 - 00:02:19.908, Speaker D: And then now it's basically my full time job is to go and find unexplored data spaces and try to put some guides and educational material out there. Basically, that's 90% of my time.
00:02:20.044 - 00:02:27.780, Speaker A: Well, I think the broader analyst community really appreciates that spend time, otherwise we would not be able to know what happens on Solana.
00:02:27.900 - 00:02:53.138, Speaker C: So I think in general, we wanted to interview you with the angle that it's kind of hard to make sense of Solana data. It's not really well articulated in the space, and you actually had a tweet on just this a while back saying how frustrating it is to analyze sonata data. I think that's probably a reason why. Can you just quickly speak on this and explain your frustrations?
00:02:53.234 - 00:03:27.928, Speaker D: Someone will have to stop me. So I don't take up the whole 30 minutes talking about these pains. But yeah, I mean, I think it's a few things, right? I think one of the starting points, and I think we hear this a lot, just comparing Ethereum to any other chain is just like Ethereum has really good dev and data tooling. Like, I think that's inarguable in terms of like, let's say we had to analyze traces on Ethereum with just Etherscan. That would be pretty painful. But we have like 20 other tools to choose from to kind of dive deeper. There's already a good set of knowledge.
00:03:27.928 - 00:04:14.636, Speaker D: Contracts are all verified. Well, not all closely verified, you know, so it's like bearing in mind that the Ethereum data experience is already, like fairly top tier. I think going into Solana, there are a couple pains. One is the explorers are extremely, how do I say, bloated to read partially. This is just because of how Solana transactions are formatted. So if you think about an Ethereum transaction, like, if I go swap on uniswap, if I wanted to do multiple swaps, I have to go and use what's called a multicol contract. I have to use a separate contract that will batch these swaps separately, assuming I'm not trying to do a router transaction.
00:04:14.636 - 00:05:24.340, Speaker D: But for Solana, this multicall is automatically part of the transaction payload. If you think about approving and then swapping on Ethereum as two separate transactions, you could automatically bundle that in a multi call on Solana. So that means that you have these giant transactions that have basically ten actions, five to ten actions within them, an insane amount of data. And so if you go to any random transaction on Solscan or Solana FM, which are two of the main block explorers, you could scroll for 20 seconds before you scroll to the bottom of the page. And I think that's just you take that, and then you take the fact that only half of these things are maybe decoded, and we can talk about how decoding and open source works on Solana later. But imagine half of that is in just raw hex, and then you have the added complication that Solana does. Like they parallelize transactions based off of access to accounts.
00:05:24.340 - 00:06:16.126, Speaker D: And I promise I'll stop ranting for a bit after this. But Solana, you have to declare the accounts you access when you do any instruction. If I do a swap, I'm accessing the account of the liquidity pool, the account of my token balance that I'm swapping, and then maybe one or two other accounts, depending on the complexity of the Dex. You have a list of ten addresses per instruction because those are basically locked for that transaction. So you take that list of ten accounts and then you multiply it by five to ten instructions per transaction. And I think that leads to this feeling of the first time anyone goes to a block explorer. You're kind of just like, I don't want to do this, this is painful.
00:06:16.126 - 00:06:37.204, Speaker D: I haven't looked at the other three tabs yet, and I haven't even talked about the other three tabs. But I think just as a start, that's already like, this is not fun. I think for any data person, if even the block explorer is not fun to navigate, you just know that the rest of it is going to be very, very painful.
00:06:37.292 - 00:07:00.064, Speaker C: You quickly touched on that decoding, and how does that differ from EVM? I think when you look at Etherscan, it's very nice when things are decoded. It's a huge benefit for everyone involved. How does that work in Solana? Is it, are you seeing as many like as, would you say there's as much being decoded? What is the difference there in terms.
00:07:00.112 - 00:08:02.770, Speaker D: Of like verified contracts? You don't nicely have the code in the Explorer. I think Soulscan is working on this. So you maybe have like a couple of them that have the contracts verified. But the key thing to remember here is like if you're familiar with Avis in Ethereum world, which is just a summary of the function that's an event on a contract on Solana, it's called an IDL, which I'm forgetting the name of, but it's instruction DL something. One of the reasons, yes, there actually are a lot of programs that upload their IDL on chain, which is a nicety to have your IDL on chain because abis technically are not on chain. But one of the difficulties here is all programs on Solana are upgradable by default, like every single program you deploy. And these teams will upgrade their programs like two or three times a month, if not more.
00:08:02.770 - 00:09:02.638, Speaker D: Any decoding you do have, you've probably even seen this on some Ethereum explorers. Sometimes polygon scan, for example, is decoding with the wrong ABI. And so I think you run into that semi often on Solana where it's like, oh, it might be decoded, but it's only half decoded, or if the version is slightly off, then it just says unknown transaction. So it's kind of these frustrations of like, sure, like Jupyter, tensor, orca, like all the big programs, you can see the decoded data in an interface. But like, because of all these upgrades and inconsistencies and having to track down the code bases over time, like, it's just really, really painful to try to get it working. Versus Ethereum, where it's like compound is deployed once, they maybe do an upgrade through a governance proposal once every like three months maybe, if that. So it's just very different beasts you're playing with there.
00:09:02.734 - 00:09:17.272, Speaker B: Is there any difference, like why they are loading so frequently, so different from how I feel? Like on EVM, if there is a project that's established, it won't change after, you know, like four years until they have v two, v three.
00:09:17.376 - 00:09:54.182, Speaker D: Yeah, good question. I think partially, I think there's two reasons for it. One is just like, Solana does not have an EIP process. If some team wants to implement a new standard, for example, Metaplex, which is the biggest NFT team on Solana, uh, basically all minted nfts go through their program and we should talk about standards. But, um, essentially there's, they have the main NFT factory contract. They've probably come out with like two or three other NFT standards in the last month. Like not month, like three to four months or so, some of which I haven't even included in here because I haven't gotten to it.
00:09:54.182 - 00:11:39.760, Speaker D: Um, and they just create the standard and they go and deploy it and they go make their other contracts or programs backwards compatible. And then that means if Metaplex did that, then now tensor swap and Magic Eden also need to update their logic so that they support this new token account structure for this new, like there's a new standard they put out called Metaplex core, which they're asking me to add in here and I have not gotten to it yet. But essentially they will deploy a new standard and then all these other teams downstream have to update their programs to account for this standard. And so you can see how there's just this constant downstream dependency of upgrades we're used to on Ethereum, that standards go through an EIP process, they become an ERC. For example, ERC 4626 vaults on Ethereum took maybe like a year and a half before it was finalized versus on Solana. A lot of these standards are pushed basically by the Solana foundation plus another team, and it's just those two that work together, get into the ecosystem, and they'll put out a single factory contract that then everyone will use for whatever, creating nfts, creating liquidity, staking tokens, et cetera, et cetera. So because of this, you have standards being updated and pushed by teams, like individual teams much more than you do across the whole ecosystem.
00:11:39.760 - 00:12:23.518, Speaker D: Metaplex, they had their token metadata standard, which was the oldest. They released compressed NFTs with heliuse last year, and then they just pushed out metaplex core, a new standard like maybe a month or two ago. So each time they do one of these, they are essentially updating or uploading a new program. And then tensor swap, Magic Eden. Everyone downstream now has to also support these token types in their trading. So then you end up with kind of upgrades all the time as these programs are adding different features, different instructions, different interfaces. Again, there's pros and cons.
00:12:23.518 - 00:12:39.010, Speaker D: The pro is Solana is undebatably moving faster than Ethereum in some of its development. But the cons is everyone else's life, especially the data analyst sucks.
00:12:39.510 - 00:13:07.430, Speaker C: Well, Ethereum has a fairly robust standardization process with eips and stuff. And you mentioned it takes a while for everyone to adopt, and they usually built into the core protocol or at least try to be standardized. In that sense, Solana, I guess, has more of analyst as an afterthought, or at least not the priority. The goal is more to move fast and iterate quickly rather than focus on it being analyzable easily, I guess. Yeah.
00:13:08.050 - 00:13:56.330, Speaker A: A lot of this also comes down to the vm design. Just like the high level design concepts, they're running a parallel or like a vm that can execute parallel transactions. And therefore they have like, a very different account and address system where an ethereum, kind of, like one token is one address in Solana. If I own USDC on Solana, that is stored in an additional account, and that account has its own address and you need to pay kind of rent. Like, that's not really enforced at the moment, but, like, that's beside the point. And it's like all of, all of these, like, different decisions. And then I think, Andrew, if you could touch on, like the, like, one address unequals one account, I think that's like, very important for people to fundamentally grasp if you start looking into Solana data.
00:13:56.330 - 00:14:06.306, Speaker A: But then there's also programs which are like, you've kind of touched upon, like, everyone using NFL tplex. So, like, how's this called?
00:14:06.418 - 00:14:07.858, Speaker D: Metaplexes?
00:14:08.034 - 00:14:22.802, Speaker A: Yeah, metaplexes NFT program. And if you like, this is just not a thing in Ethereum where like one piece of software is deployed somewhere or like one piece of code and then a lot of other people can use it. So if you could maybe quickly give us an introduction to that concept, that would be cool.
00:14:22.906 - 00:15:12.870, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, on tokens and like accounts, I think the easiest way for me to usually think about it, something that helped getting into it, was like unsigned transaction on bitcoin. Like if I'm a sending bitcoin around, technically the bitcoin is being held in a separate address that my address. Well, not separate address, but in a separate id that my address then holds. Solana kind of takes that to the extreme where it's like, hey, for every token, let's say I have USDC and I want to deposit that USDC in Solend or Camino or something. Um, I'm going to create a new token account that basically says I own the tokens, but Camino's program has ownership over movement of those tokens. Right.
00:15:12.870 - 00:16:29.804, Speaker D: So on Ethereum, that would be a balance mapping, uh, technically, uh, on the USDC contract and then the, there's some like transfer from whatever approvals on the contract side. Basically, Solana just abstracts that all out and says, hey, instead of you doing like a mapping here and then some roles and permissioning here, we're going to put all of that into one kind of account so that it's easier for you to manage different kinds of permissions on an account, whether you're a user or a program. So I think this is one of those things as an analyst, it takes some time wrapping your head around, but I think it's actually a very smart design decision because it leads to a lot of very standard token interactions. And we'll get into this at some point. Maybe today, maybe not today with token extensions. But I think one of the reasons that, for example, Solana can do Uniswap V four style hooks, but at the token level versus in Ethereum, let's say uniswap v four hooks are adopted. Like, you can't just apply that easily to every token and then to every contract using that token.
00:16:29.804 - 00:16:45.852, Speaker D: That's going to be a whole mess that we have to deal with and actually is pretty big vendor lock in for Uniswap as well, versus on Solana, because those kinds of extensions and permissions are handled on this token account level. There's a lot of efficiencies there for.
00:16:45.876 - 00:17:39.646, Speaker A: Like EVM data analysts comparing like there's internal EVM state addresses, where, like, your USB USDC balance is stored somewhere in the contract storage. And like, in Solana, it's actually like, way more explicit concept where, like, hey, like, you hold USDC, it's just stored in this account. Like, to, like, bring that whole concept into like, a transaction level. It's like, if you, like, commit any transaction in Solana because, like, nothing is, like in ethereum, we get around this problem because everything is executed sequentially. So, like, there can't ever be like, two people who trade at the same time in some uniswap pool. So, like, in Solana, like, by difference, it is if I trade with the Uniswap pool, or, like, there's no uniswap pool in Solana, of course. But like, if I trade with a liquidity pool, I need to lock it up for a second because otherwise there's like, I'm trading against it and Dobby is trading against it at the same time.
00:17:39.646 - 00:18:02.780, Speaker A: So, like, by including an account access list, I think it's called, at the beginning of the transaction, you basically, like, you can, you can lock up, like, a bunch of accounts that you're gonna interact with. But by having this concept of accounts that I'm gonna include inside of this transaction, Solana can do things in parallel where DVM is just like, oh, like one transaction, two transactions, three.
00:18:03.080 - 00:18:03.900, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:18:04.480 - 00:18:06.820, Speaker A: It needs to do it all sequentially.
00:18:07.560 - 00:18:07.872, Speaker D: So.
00:18:07.896 - 00:18:37.930, Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting concept. I think there's also some problems with this where people are just spamming. You can just lock up accounts for free, essentially, or not for free, but I, for some, like, miniscule amounts of money and, like, potentially create big arbitrages and stuff. So, like, every design has its trade offs to kind of, like, establish, like, a basic understanding of the vm. We probably didn't do the best job with this, but I think that's like, a good kind of groundwork to lay here.
00:18:38.350 - 00:19:20.360, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah, yeah. And they're working on, like, other key concepts here is gas on Solana does not work the same way it does on gas on Ethereum. In terms of, like, on gas and Ethereum, your gas used, like, basically how much computation, um, your transaction used is multiplied by your gas price, um, versus on Solana, no matter how much compute your transaction used, you're paying a flat fee. Uh, whether that's the base fee or priority fee, that's exactly the same. So that's like, a very big difference that allows you to do the kind of spam that you're talking about, because, like, there's no scaling of compute, which is actually a really interesting design decision.
00:19:20.740 - 00:19:29.076, Speaker B: I thought they changed the flat fee to something like per state access, like per account access. And you have some sort of gas auction now.
00:19:29.188 - 00:20:00.634, Speaker D: So they've always had priority fees. You're essentially paying a priority just to access a certain state or certain account is a way to think about it. But it does not scale. It only scales with the demand of that specific account. It does not scale with the complexity of the transaction. So you could have a very complex mev transaction, but it's going to be priced basically just off of how in demand does that account versus how many versus the extra variable of, like, gas used.
00:20:00.722 - 00:20:01.298, Speaker B: Got it.
00:20:01.394 - 00:20:24.338, Speaker D: So that, like, that's a pretty big difference. And Solana is kind of working through ways of making that work because. Yeah, that not working well led to the failed transactions and spam that we saw earlier this year that they solved with their 1.18 update that had no notes about it.
00:20:24.474 - 00:20:27.778, Speaker C: Wait, so they release it? And what do you mean there's no notes?
00:20:27.874 - 00:20:53.976, Speaker D: Oh, I mean, Solana likes to just. They'll release it, have the validators adopt it. The repo is kind of like a very simple pr, like, normal pr message. There's no, like, here's a full description of specs of everything that's changed. The knowledge is somewhere in their, like, very busy discord. Helios did a good summary of 1.18 in their own kind of, like, developer blog.
00:20:53.976 - 00:20:55.344, Speaker D: Separate from the Solana.
00:20:55.432 - 00:21:01.778, Speaker C: Are docs in generally lacking on Solana, whether it's like sonata itself or protocols on it?
00:21:01.874 - 00:21:53.942, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I would say docs in general are lacking. Like, the documentation I see on Solana is very much like, this is the bare minimum you need to do and to, like, run this piece of code and run this CLI to like, get a Jupyter price or something. But, like, if you try to find documentation on, like, how Jupiter perps works, or like, how some of the deeper token 2022 extensions work, like, you have to go and read the code yourself to really understand it. The documentation is literally just like, here's the one line that you need to copy to get your program to work, which is still good documentation, but it's like, if you're trying to be an analyst, it is very much like, as an analyst, that one line of code doesn't really mean anything to me. I'm like, I don't care about the CLI, different audience.
00:21:54.006 - 00:22:24.954, Speaker C: It's funny, every once in a few weeks, I want to go into Solana data, and then I message, Andrew, and say, hey, do you know about this, this and this? And there's like 15 exceptions to the rule. And it's just, it seems very frustrating to me to analyze and like you said as well earlier with your metaplex, how the constant change of data means you in terms of maintenance is also much, much higher maintenance in terms of workload.
00:22:25.002 - 00:22:26.830, Speaker D: Yeah. So shit out of maintenance.
00:22:27.470 - 00:22:37.982, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you foresee any potential fixes or standardization happening in the future on Solana, especially as it grows in size and in usage?
00:22:38.086 - 00:23:26.058, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of these, this is just like missing developer tooling. For example, all of the idls are on chain. Someone just kind of needs to create compiler processes to verify your compiler, verify this IDL, and then have that in a nice IDL compiler block slot, kind of like output. And that would help us a lot. And technically probably the falls on us at dune. So maybe build some of that. They're working on a bunch of these kinds of developer and interface improvements on Solana, something we didn't really get into, but like, interfaces are much harder to build in Solana because you have to prep all of these account access lists ahead of time.
00:23:26.058 - 00:24:02.218, Speaker D: So if you try to call uniswap in solidity, it's a very simple, just pull uniswap, router, interface, whatever function, two lines, that's all you need. But on Solana, you basically have to go find their SDK and their example repo and the 15 functions they used. Here's how you get all accounts. I think there's a bunch of tooling there that's just missing. And I think as Solana builds, continues to build momentum, we will see the people, the kinds of people who build that tooling appear more, I think, is what people are hoping for.
00:24:02.354 - 00:24:36.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I would be much more interested in diving more into Solana once there's a more iterative process that can be easily followed, which makes sense as well. Ethereum is in a state where it's so big, there's so much money on it as well, and there's a lot going on already. So you can't just like try random stuff like that are instrumental to everyone. Solana, I guess, is in a growing phase that it's already like huge. I'm not saying it's not, but it's much more able to iterate quickly and do those changes on the fly.
00:24:36.110 - 00:24:42.650, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it has this luxury for maybe another year, and then it needs to get his shit together.
00:24:43.510 - 00:25:23.266, Speaker A: But wait, Andrew, the way you describe accessing all the functions, lists, and, like, you need to basically understand the entire SDK. That kind of sounds like composability in Solana would be way harder where, like, I can't just easily build on top of some lending protocol or something, because, like, I always need to construct these, like, super, like, not super complicated, but like, rather complicated transactions with which basically are, like, not deterministic before I start them. But I need to have so much knowledge of what's going to happen inside of the transaction before even starting that transaction.
00:25:23.338 - 00:26:17.548, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah, I would say you need the SDK for a couple things. One is just to stay up to date on different functions and the access lists. But two is a lot of these, because everything on Solana is stored in accounts. We only talk about token accounts in terms of you have your USD token, and then you have your USD token accounts, and an address can have multiple USD token accounts. But like, everything on Solana follows this, like, main program and then sub account structure, like my stake accounts, my multi SIG accounts, my governance accounts, my liquidity pools. So a lot of the times, if you look at the instructions, like, a lot of the complicated part will be like, what order do I create, what accounts in, and then initialize them to what owners and what permissions? Because every token account has, like, your freeze permission, your delegate permission, your approval permission.
00:26:17.548 - 00:26:43.386, Speaker D: With token extensions, there's even more kind of different permissions. So it's like, if you look at the process of creating like, a position on Jupiter perps, or like, drift perps, like, it's an insane, insanely complex account structure. You need an SDK for it. It's pretty painful. I have not successfully written a single Solana script, so. And I'm like, I think I'm like, I'm not bad at typescripts. It's painful.
00:26:43.386 - 00:26:44.150, Speaker D: It's hard.
00:26:44.570 - 00:26:52.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we haven't mentioned yet. Solana is like, written in a fork of rust, basically. So, like, all the programs.
00:26:52.842 - 00:27:18.150, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, we. Yeah, we somehow got this far without talking about it. Yeah, Solana is written in rust. It all uses abortion serialization, which. Okay, we'll talk about three more data panes. But yeah, it's all in rust, which means everything is compactly serialized. So, like on Ethereum, for an array, let's say I have an event that's like, address, address, array.
00:27:18.150 - 00:27:56.748, Speaker D: It'll give me in the bytecode, like, address, like 32 bytes. 32 bytes. And then for the array, it'll give me 32 bytes as an indicator of where the array starts. On Solana, the array would just be packed in there directly. And so if I have an array and another array after it, I have to figure out the length of the first array to figure out the length of, like, where the second array starts. And anyone who dives deep into Solana is going to realize rust supports, like, option enums, which means, hey, this variable can exist or it cannot exist. And if it doesn't exist, the length is zero.
00:27:56.748 - 00:28:44.568, Speaker D: So some of my custom decoding has, like, a bunch of case ones cause the length of where on a variable start changes. So that's a pretty big data pain. And the other one I did forgot to mention at the start, and maybe we edited it back in. At the start is, like, one of the base things people in Ethereum rely on for balances is, like, every time I transfer eth, there is a trace call that ETH was transferred on Solana. You can transfer Sol without emitting any transfer function. So you can't just, like, a lot of these, like, tensor swap, for example, or stake program, or now token 2022, they do this kind of back end. Like, you can just change the balance of an account without calling a transfer function.
00:28:44.568 - 00:28:55.000, Speaker D: So then that means, like, if you just sum transfers, it's wrong. You got to go to balances table. Anyways, I forgot what we were talking about. I'm just having, like, PTSD.
00:28:55.980 - 00:29:35.476, Speaker C: I have a pain point, actually, to add on to this, which I think you probably run into compute and how, like, in general, analyzing Solana, because of all these consideration and how there's so many things to consider, is just much more intense, and I don't know, can you speak on that? I think you created a lot of your dashboards. What many people don't know is dashboards on dune, most of the time, the better dashboards. It's not just about the dashboard, but the data underneath and the tables that are created on spellbook. Can you talk about, like, creating on spellbook for Solana versus for EVM chains?
00:29:35.588 - 00:30:32.082, Speaker D: Yeah, I can say that I have personally racked up quite the bill of compute to create those tables. I try not to ask our. Like, sometimes I ask our engineers, like, hey, how many. How many credits have I spent on these Solana queries? But, yeah, I would say for Solana, you have to create a lot. Like, many, many more intermediate views. So for people who aren't so familiar with ETL, like, when you create a view, whether it's materialized or not, it's kind of like, if I want to take all balances, I might take a sub filter of just token accounts first, and then in a separate query downstream, take the balances of that filtered account list. So if anyone really dove into my queries, they would see this like seven or eight view string long of different materialized views and spellbook tables.
00:30:32.082 - 00:31:15.350, Speaker D: To get this stuff to run, we've moved Solana into its own DBT cluster because I think on the main cluster it was like 70% of all compute and it was slowing down the rest of our Ethereum pipeline. And we were like, okay, we just spent literally two weeks like moving that out, running that separately, it's very expensive, it's very slow. It's like 1000 or 10,000 times more data than all these l two s combined, I think. Again, yeah, that's definitely part of the reason why I think a lot of people don't analyze it. Because when you're debugging now, it takes like ten minutes to run your query and see if there is an error versus like 30 seconds. So that doesn't help.
00:31:15.430 - 00:32:17.174, Speaker C: Yeah, in general, spellbook was, I guess, built with more EVM chains in mind that are just lower tps and just less intense to run. And I was wondering why some of my prs weren't getting merged in the past month. And I asked Jeff and he's like, oh, we're working on Solana data and Andrew keeps pushing out this humongous tables that we're struggling to have run properly. And I guess it was a good stress test for Dune because now they are like their own separate environments and that makes it maybe a lot more manageable for you guys. Solana, Dexs, NFTs all have their own separate structure, which is super nice. And my, I mean, I dont know if its like, I dont think its a crazy guess, but were going to see more and more of high throughput chains and more and more of those kind of heavy in terms of compute ones. So it's a good problem to fix now.
00:32:17.262 - 00:32:46.950, Speaker D: Yeah, we're definitely, we're not scared of all the different l two s or pre confs or like whatever monad mega eth chains, because we're like, they're not going to be as messy as Solano. We'll be ready for when those launch. Yeah, we've already hit all the limits we could hit across, like AWS, DBT databricks. We've hit issues they've never expected us to hit.
00:32:48.050 - 00:33:04.970, Speaker C: Nice. Now I think it'd be cool to look into some actual Solana data of ecosystem level. I think we can start with the most obvious one which is Dexa, usually the biggest sector. Solana especially. Here's your dashboard. Do you want to, do you want to run us through it?
00:33:05.130 - 00:33:39.988, Speaker D: I mean, high level, we can see that the Solana story, this is the first thing I usually point out to people is just the amount of activity on Solana this cycle beats out. Its last cycle peaks by like ten to 20 x, if not more like even like peak. Like Solana Bowl, FTX bull market, they were seeing like maybe 500 million of volume a week. And now easily we've seen like $10 billion of volume a week for the last, like, I don't know, six months, five months or so.
00:33:40.044 - 00:33:47.396, Speaker B: So which is higher than the Ethereum volume now. End of last year, Solana, people were tweeting about, yeah, the volume is over ethereum.
00:33:47.468 - 00:33:55.314, Speaker D: There was a couple days where I think it was over main net. Yeah. So like ethereum, what's ethereum at here?
00:33:55.402 - 00:33:59.858, Speaker C: Ethereum is eleven and Solana. Eleven. It's on par.
00:33:59.994 - 00:34:36.867, Speaker D: Yeah, it's basically tied obviously with all the l two s. The Ethereum ecosystem overall is still more than Solana, but like volume wise they're about the same. Traders wise, they're also about the same. Like, I think I saw Uniswap put out some tweet that was like across all l two s. Uniswap is seeing like 4 million active traders. And classic chart thing, the reason why everything is dipping is because it's a Monday. So charts always dip on Monday.
00:34:36.867 - 00:35:12.508, Speaker D: But yeah, Solana is at like 3 million active wall. Active traders. You could segment this by volume traded as well. Like even if you filter out the ones who are trading less than like 100, there's still like a good chunk of people trading like 1000 or more a week. We'll have to see how sticky these users are. But I think, yeah, on a volume and traders level, like Ethereum and Solana are basically on par. One of the bigger differences is that Solana has many, many more meme coins or coins in general than Ethereum.
00:35:12.508 - 00:36:17.140, Speaker D: There's like a tokens deployed chart above this active walleth. Oh, yeah, new trading, new trading tokens. So yeah, like we can see like this is like number of tokens trading for the first time on a given blockchain, on a given week and through like all of the last cycle, binance finance smart chain was leading by like, I don't know what is like 2000, 5000 tokens a week in the last like couple months. Like since September basically of 2023, Solana started taking off and Solana is now seeing 100,000 new tokens trading each week. Obviously a lot of those die out, but base is second to that at 17k in terms of number of new tokens trading. So it's a pretty big momentum shift here where it's like, yeah, all of the meme coin traders and pumping and dumping has probably moved to the Solana side more so than the Ethereum side.
00:36:17.260 - 00:36:19.620, Speaker C: Seems to be a lot with the pump fund as well.
00:36:19.700 - 00:36:34.316, Speaker B: I wanted to comment the same thing. When you break down into within Solana, it seems like all from Palm dot fang. But what I noticed earlier was like when you look at the volume across Solana, palm dot fr is very small. It's so small they have a thing.
00:36:34.348 - 00:36:43.470, Speaker C: Where they migrate to radium I think after reaching a certain market cap or threshold. I think that's why.
00:36:43.510 - 00:37:07.136, Speaker D: Yeah it's like 70k market cap which is like 30k. Like if you buy 30k worth of tokens then it gets graduated to radium basically immediately. So it's like a very very low amount of liquidity, but they take 1% fees which is like.
00:37:07.208 - 00:37:16.128, Speaker C: It's interesting. Why is the, what drives that migration? Why wouldn't pump fund fun? Like want to keep it a hold of those?
00:37:16.304 - 00:37:59.360, Speaker D: I think partially it's just like building an order book is not super simple to do and it's kind of painful to manage on Solana and we can get into order book systems if we want. But I mean that's a big difference between Solana and Ethereum as well. Is this is ethereum, everything is amms Solana only Orca is an amm. Everything else is a limit order book. But yeah, I think its purely from a product shipping perspective that pumped up fun. Wanted to just get out there to market with just like hey, launch a token on a bonding curve. I would not be surprised if they came out with their own kind of Dex.
00:37:59.360 - 00:38:12.360, Speaker D: Or I guess it wouldn't be like their own kind of order book system soon I don't think I'd find that surprising. Or maybe they have some sort of deal with radium would also not be surprising.
00:38:13.180 - 00:38:49.032, Speaker A: It actually like whether this was by design or accident, kind of a genius system. Because like the tokens graduate out of pump fun. So like they make space for new tokens and like the tokens only ever like there's tokens that die on pump fun as well where it's like they don't even make it out. But like if a token has gotten big enough then it doesn't really die on pump fun. But rather it dies on radium. So, like, I think that, like, circle of life and death that constantly happens on pump fun is kind of a good design choice. And, like, whether it was intentional or not.
00:38:49.032 - 00:39:32.250, Speaker A: And, like, I think it's also like, I think they, they did this because, like radium, like when pump fund launched, it's like, it's like a joke project, right? So, like, for, like, not a joke project, but like they needed, they needed to kind of build their credibility and for meme coin to kind of graduate to like the proper amm or central limit order books, book exchange on, on Solana, I think that, like, allowed a few meme coins probably to like grow much bigger than if there was only ever a liquidity pool on hand, that fund. So I think, like those, like, seems like good design, actually. Like, it's pretty ingenious. I think some people are experimenting with this on base, but so far no experiment has worked, or at least I haven't seen them yet.
00:39:32.370 - 00:39:48.836, Speaker C: I think also a good proxy in general for usage of Dex marketplaces of like, organic usage tends to be mev. So I don't have mev data on hand. I'm working on it. You just put more in my pr.
00:39:48.908 - 00:39:52.680, Speaker D: Thank you. I've shared the pr with many, many teams.
00:39:53.380 - 00:39:54.132, Speaker C: Oh, well, thank you.
00:39:54.156 - 00:39:55.680, Speaker D: Coming soon? In a week.
00:39:56.220 - 00:40:12.400, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to work with Sonata. You know, I'm working myself towards it. But actually Dan from blockworks shared a chart a while back showing that basically Solana had overtaken Ethereum in generated mev.
00:40:13.350 - 00:41:05.340, Speaker D: I will say I'm not an Mav expert. It's one of the fields that I usually stray away from because it gets really deep into builders and validators and a bunch of other technical stuff. But essentially you have geedo, which acts as the one builder on Solana. So you can think of this mev as Mev captured by searchers. So that's a very big difference than how MeV works on Ethereum, which is mostly builders. So Jito is the only builder per se, and they feed the built blocks to validators running the Geeto Labs version, mevboot, basically geo version of a Mev sidecar. Searchers will submit their batches to Jito and they'll tip the Jito.
00:41:05.340 - 00:41:38.728, Speaker D: Like there's Jito has a bunch of tip addresses and they'll basically tip one of those addresses to get their searched, like bundle into a built block. So what we're seeing here is tips. I believe Jitto takes 5% cut of those tips. So that means Jito actually makes a fair share of this mev revenue. I don't think. Correct me if wrong. I don't think like flashbots, I don't think they don't take a percentage cut, but yeah, Cheeto takes a 5% cut.
00:41:38.728 - 00:41:46.336, Speaker D: So they are quite. I think they might be the most profitable protocol on Solana right now.
00:41:46.528 - 00:41:51.408, Speaker A: Yeah, I think their revenue was higher than Solana base fees.
00:41:51.464 - 00:42:15.958, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. The overall mev revenue is higher than Solana fees. The revenue that judo takes is not higher than Solana fee. But yeah, I think they generate. Jitto generates more revenue than Jupiter Metaplex or any of these other protocols on Solana. So it's pretty interesting. I think there's lots of ways to dice and slice this.
00:42:15.958 - 00:42:45.428, Speaker D: We could get into how liquidity staking works as well because I think that Jitto creating their own Jito soul LsT as well was a smart business decision to get more geno adoption. Yeah, it's quite staking a mev is quite complex on Solana and I'm excited to have hildebe help me out in diving into that stuff. So that'll be interesting.
00:42:45.444 - 00:42:48.080, Speaker C: I don't know if I'm excited or scared. We'll see.
00:42:49.780 - 00:43:26.102, Speaker B: Yeah. To add some comments, like I think the chart you show me tips to validator is basically like mevdeminal. I would say mev revenue to validators. And the Ethereum one is pretty much all the revenue validators gets from running the mapboost software when they run the validator. And it's like all the basically searchers profits paid out to builder. And after the builder layer, how much are paid out to validators? Supposedly builder are competing to give as much as they can to win the block while potentially make some profits. But I think most of the time builders are not really making profits.
00:43:26.102 - 00:44:21.970, Speaker B: A lot of the small builders are subsidizing actually. So for Ethereum it could be like actually surprised that's given out plus some maybe even builder subsidy. And like in terms of the MEV breakdown of all these revenue for Ethereum, I think large chunk could be centralized exchange to decentralized exchange arbitrage mostly for like the top few high frequency trader builder. So Beaver and Rsync and there's a huge chunk of revenue are from the telegram bots, Banana gong who has an exclusive deal with Titan and their user are paying like shit ton of gas priority fee. And also like builder tip for potentially sniping the newly minted tokens. And I think that is probably even more on Solana compared to Ethereum and I think overall, Solana probably also just have more like atomic mvv with all these meme coins.
00:44:22.950 - 00:44:48.024, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll see very soon with Hildebee's sandwich data, we'll be able to attribute that to different bot sources. We'll be able to attribute, like, how many of the sandwiches are, like, Jito provided and how many could be using a separate private mempool. So, like, Solana Mev might. It's probably actually higher than what we see here.
00:44:48.112 - 00:45:25.408, Speaker B: To add on what you said, Guido used to run a manpool for Solana where searchers are actually adding sandwiching. And, like, when the volume picked up in March, Solana foundation was like, all we care the most is about user experience. We don't want user to get so much sandwich. And so they kind of basically, I feel like, you know, it's like social layer pressured judo to shut down the manpo and. But then afterwards there's being, I guess, like separate mempool has been spin up by some searchers, I guess. I know this one called a deeds node, is one of the private mempool spin up by, like, one of the searchers. So I think that's what you're saying.
00:45:25.408 - 00:45:29.880, Speaker B: That, like, there could be some site revenue that's like, coming from those Manpool, but we're not accounting.
00:45:29.920 - 00:46:10.430, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah, and there's, there's generally, I think this gets into LST's and we can maybe move on to that next. But, like staking and validators on Solana, you can easily redelegate your stake to another validator. So a lot of these LST systems, like Jitto and marinade, actually have a scoring system. So based on your score, that depends. That will determine the weight of LST share that you get delegated to you. I think we'll very soon see, like, if you are running a private mempool, that could hurt your score, which hurts the amount of LST delegated to you.
00:46:10.430 - 00:46:50.288, Speaker D: So that social consensus layer that Danny was talking about, that can actually be very quickly implemented on chain through a scoring system. And that's something on Ethereum we're still pretty far away from, I think, rated is trying to do some similar sort of scoring. But, like, having delegated proof of stake natively built in means I think you can do this kind of social layer pressure on stuff like private mempools, like, much faster than you can on any other chain. So that's actually probably one of the most interesting things to watch in the.
00:46:50.304 - 00:46:59.024, Speaker C: Salon ecosystem right now is staking through lsts. Do you know, if it's more permanent in terms of market share relative to Ethereum or.
00:46:59.152 - 00:47:08.654, Speaker D: Yeah. So on Ethereum, staked, and I think from Hildebe's dashboard, like 30. Wait, what percent of it. What percent of Ethereum is staked? Of total supply?
00:47:08.742 - 00:47:09.610, Speaker C: 27.
00:47:10.430 - 00:47:14.398, Speaker D: 27. What percent of staked is LST?
00:47:14.574 - 00:47:18.530, Speaker C: 33%. And then there's also 8.5 through restaking.
00:47:20.030 - 00:47:42.100, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, yeah, what's interesting is on Solana right now, I think it's only like 7% of stake is liquidity. Most of the stake is not liquid yet. That's something that everyone is kind of waiting on to pick up more. I think there's a chart on it farther down. Oh, it looks like we've moved up. What are we at now? Oh, no, still 5%.
00:47:42.100 - 00:48:32.300, Speaker D: So I think something interesting here is on Solana. I think we can assume that staked Sol is going to be more prevalent than Sol just because of the inflation rate of soul. It doesnt make sense to ever just kind of whole soul by itself. So assuming most soul is staked, we should see this LST percentage move up, because thats how youre going to be able to transact in DeFi on different platforms and whatnot. But, yeah, it still has quite some way to go in terms of adoption. I think were really only seeing the beginning of, like, lsts and like, mev and how like, how all these things can tie together on Solana. We're early.
00:48:33.800 - 00:48:38.580, Speaker C: Yeah. What's the percentage in total that is staked, as you know.
00:48:40.680 - 00:48:47.990, Speaker D: I actually don't know because as you would expect, getting total supply is actually not easy.
00:48:48.120 - 00:48:50.522, Speaker C: That's a problem. On every chain is the same.
00:48:50.626 - 00:49:39.872, Speaker D: Yeah, on every single chain, getting total supply is a pain, but I believe that. So 21 co says total supply is 578 million sol and 400 million soul is staked. So someone can do the math faster than I can. But that's like, what, 70, 70% of total soul is stake compared to, what did we say for Ethereum 27. But for Solana, there's no reason why it shouldn't go up to, like, 90% of solar stakes, especially because it's super easy to create lsts on Solana. It's literally like an ERC 20 factory contract to create an LST, which is much easier than deploying like a lido or rocket pool or something. Yeah.
00:49:39.936 - 00:49:42.744, Speaker C: It's entrained into the protocol, essentially.
00:49:42.832 - 00:50:13.292, Speaker D: Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, I would expect that total sole state goes to 80, 90%, and LST should make up a giant portion of that which, again, affects validator scoring, which affects adoption of things like private mempools and potentially different inclusion lists. Like, you don't have to enshrine an inclusion list, you could just have that as part of a validator scoring system. Lots of impacts there.
00:50:13.436 - 00:50:14.188, Speaker C: Okay.
00:50:14.324 - 00:50:14.716, Speaker D: Okay.
00:50:14.748 - 00:50:37.354, Speaker C: Very interesting. I have another sector to dive into, which is Solana, NFTs. I'm amazed how you managed to cover all the big topics in Solana. It's very impressive. Just in general, doing it on any chain is impressive. Doing it on Solana of any chain is very impressive. Very, very well done.
00:50:37.354 - 00:50:39.950, Speaker C: Congrats on this. Thank you.
00:50:41.010 - 00:50:42.550, Speaker D: I pulled my hair out.
00:50:43.250 - 00:50:45.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I can imagine. I can imagine.
00:50:45.810 - 00:50:46.314, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:46.442 - 00:50:56.362, Speaker C: We currently have about $80 million worth of NFT marketplace volume per week on Solana.
00:50:56.426 - 00:51:04.342, Speaker D: Yep. I think ethereum is actually about the same kind of fallen on all chains. So like, just like 10 million.
00:51:04.406 - 00:51:08.894, Speaker C: So now is above actually well, out of, as of like, last week. But otherwise it's.
00:51:09.022 - 00:51:21.410, Speaker D: I think there's rumors that madlads is doing some sort of airdrop. So someone came and swept a bunch of nfts. Literally. Yes. Like last night. Oh, good for my bags.
00:51:23.270 - 00:51:31.108, Speaker C: And by the way, I wanted to point out I accidentally broke your graph by adding blast because I think it was a bar shot at first.
00:51:31.254 - 00:51:34.900, Speaker D: Yeah, I literally just edited that. If you refresh the page.
00:51:35.240 - 00:51:37.420, Speaker C: Oh, damn, you're quick.
00:51:39.040 - 00:51:48.296, Speaker D: It's the classic. I created it as a line, as a bar chart, and then changed it to lines. Blast has. Oh, blast actually has a good amount of NFT volume. I didn't know that.
00:51:48.488 - 00:51:58.176, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, it's gone down as blast. TG came around and I guess people stopped farming a bunch and blur volume overall.
00:51:58.248 - 00:51:58.528, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:58.584 - 00:52:29.430, Speaker C: Went down on blast, but it kind of stuck around actually, on Ethereum. So it's like fairly constant on Ethereum. But it's another topic I'm generally curious about the state of the ecosystem in terms of nfts. I think the. Honestly, I'm not super familiar. The ones I know are like mad lads, probably are one of the rare ones I know on Solana, and I haven't heard of nsts as prominently as I have for cryptopunks, gold apes and pudgy penguins. Would you say it's a thriving ecosystem.
00:52:29.470 - 00:53:12.712, Speaker D: Or is it nfts still play a part in it? I think that they, the people who are building NFTs, whether that's compressed NFTs or whatever, are trying to do it much more at like a consumer level versus like a trading level, like for example, Boba guys uses Solana NFTs for their rewards program. And, like, that's kind of more of what the Solana foundation and other teams have been pushing for versus launching collections. I think that's purely, like, a cultural difference of, like, you just don't have those. You don't have the people who want to launch collections building on Solana right now.
00:53:12.776 - 00:53:33.572, Speaker A: Also, no audience. No, like, everyone is caught up in newtongs. Like, I think, like, in general, like, nobody cares about nfts anymore. They were like, they're, they're sold. 2021. I don't. Like, I genuinely, I think the market for, like, ten k pfes or any, like, similar projects which were, like, all the hype in 2021.
00:53:33.572 - 00:53:56.956, Speaker A: Like, I think that's just, like, I don't think it will ever revive. So it's like, I think, like, we'll soon need to kind of differentiate in nfts where it's actually, like, are you, like, is there trading volume for, like, I don't know, nfts that have, like, real world assets attached to them? Or, like, are they, I don't know, like, real world, like, collectibles or something like this?
00:53:57.108 - 00:54:39.830, Speaker C: The last bull run was mostly about, like, nfts being treated as meme coins. And people eventually realized, if we want to do meme coins, it might as well be liquid because it's just much more efficient in every single way. I'm excited about nfts for, like, with the other, like, potential use cases, rwas and like, anything else that just is, like, different. Rather than just putting a JPEG attached to an NFT, I think eventually it'll take off and there'll definitely be stuff like this, but I'm still waiting out for what that looks like. They haven't come back in a big way as of yet, but maybe one day they will stay hopeful.
00:54:41.050 - 00:54:58.156, Speaker D: Yeah, there's nothing. There's nothing I can really call out for nfts on Solana. The size is cheaper to mint them, but, yeah, there's. I haven't seen any special use case or something that's, like, super interesting to me there.
00:54:58.268 - 00:55:25.594, Speaker A: Yeah, you said you should see all the polkadot parachains who are really cheap and minted nfts and the success they're having. It's amazing. That's like, a particularly compelling argument anymore since I guess, like, we have way too much block space to sell nowadays and the infrastructure costs don't, like, at some margin, like, they will start to matter, but, like, in general, it's like.
00:55:25.722 - 00:55:29.830, Speaker D: Yeah, when they find a use case again, it'll matter, but not now.
00:55:30.410 - 00:55:32.018, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:55:32.154 - 00:56:14.984, Speaker C: What do you guys think about like pudgy penguins launching their own chain? I think bold apes are also working on one. It's called abstract and they recently launched it. I mean, they recently announced the launch and also acquired frame. So essentially now they're like, oh, we have the social layer. Frame is going to help with the infrastructure layer and together we can fill the pieces. Because the thesis is that current chains are very focused on infrastructure rather than actual social and all the rest, which I think is a very valid argument, but I don't know, I'm kind of curious. NFT focused chain, like, what would that look like? We have like, Zora.
00:56:14.984 - 00:56:46.916, Speaker C: Zora is probably the best example of one that actually works fairly well. And, you know, they found their own niche and they're like, in terms of editions, Zora is kind of synonymous with it and they have their own chain and it's working very well. But, you know, maybe there's more. In terms of, if you look at nfts, pudgy penguins, port apes are both like top in terms of mind share, I guess, and market cap. So of all people, maybe they are the one who would succeed if there's an angle there.
00:56:46.988 - 00:57:08.140, Speaker A: I think the chain is called abstracted. Right. So what I'm hoping they will do is just implement account abstraction in a reasonable manner. And since they have the distribution and pudgy penguins is also the guys who've like sold like plushies in Walmart and stuff. Right? Like, yeah, that's okay. That's very. Their team off sites must be interesting.
00:57:08.140 - 00:58:02.130, Speaker A: On the one hand, you'll have like giga brain, like engineers and on the other hand, like, people who design plushies for, they've proven they can, they can like use their distribution channels very well. So, like, if, if they're the ones who actually bring, like, maybe not. I wouldn't call it so much as an NFT chain, but rather like, I think they're even trying to like integrate more with other chains and just be like this, like, chain of chains. I'm kind of like Nir's making this pitch at the moment as well if that's what they're going for. And like, they have the distribution. It's crazy where you just can randomly find on the Internet, like, pudgy penguins. It is like, it's genuinely like kind of sifted into popular culture and like, it's the only NFT project that has survived or like survived and thrived and like, actually broke out of the chains of the kind of crypto Twitter ecosystem.
00:58:02.130 - 00:58:11.486, Speaker A: So in that regard, like, I wouldn't say bullish, but like, I'm very excited to see what they'll, what they'll do with this.
00:58:11.638 - 00:58:42.132, Speaker C: I'm excited for anything that's like people trying out new stuff. If it's just a yet another chain that's yet, like, the rest is not going to be interesting. But I. I'm hoping they really leverage their social current layer to bring more masses on chain. I think they also see some gaming stuff happening on there. They have partnership with Zksync on having pudgy games there, whatever. I'm interested in how the NFT ecosystem goes from there.
00:58:42.132 - 00:58:58.484, Speaker C: And they seem to be the team that is actually iterating on new ideas the most rather than sticking to like, trying to make money from like royalties and stuff. So I'm, you know, I'm actually excited to see what they build next.
00:58:58.612 - 00:59:19.264, Speaker A: Yep. I can't say the same about Yuga, but yeah, exactly. We'll see what they build. Not, not to totally disqualify them. They have a giant treasury and we'll have to see what they can come up with with all that money.
00:59:19.352 - 00:59:47.216, Speaker C: Sorry. So this was a little sidestep from the rest of the episode, but can we reel back to you, Andrew, actually, and talk about your current endeavors? Aside from Dune, which are more about teaching and trying to pass along the torch to other wizards, there's both crypto bytes. There's also, you have entire tutorials to dive into, Solana, bitcoin, and all these kinds of things.
00:59:47.248 - 00:59:47.768, Speaker D: Can you.
00:59:47.864 - 00:59:55.336, Speaker C: Where can we find all this? If I were a new analyst stepping into the space, what would I do? What would you recommend I look into?
00:59:55.528 - 01:00:29.906, Speaker D: Yeah, I suggest people go to read dot cryptodatabytes.com, which has literally everything I've worked on in there. There's guides for Solana, Ethereum, bitcoin. Most concepts that you're wondering about are probably covered in one of those guides somewhere. So definitely take a look. They start from beginner level and get into, some of them get into really hard stuff. And I always think that it's easier to learn more with the community in this ecosystem.
01:00:29.906 - 01:01:13.876, Speaker D: If you try to just build analysis by yourself in a silo, you're going to bad time. So I created the byte explorers as a way for people to kind of learn and earn together. Basically anyone can mint and join us. You can use any data platform you want, and we go on different quests. Such as, like, you can share what you're working on and get feedback and tokens for sharing your work. You can answer people's data questions on, on Farcaster and also earn tokens, both NFTs and like, USDC payouts, for answering those questions. A lot of people ask me like, hey, how do I find a bounty? I'm like, if you answer people's questions, guaranteed you will find a bounty.
01:01:13.876 - 01:01:46.400, Speaker D: But if you just go out there and try to find bounties or jobs, you're not going to have a good time. So there's that. And then we're also running missions which are kind of longer research missions with larger rewards. So we're running one right now with open rank. So anyone who likes graph algorithms and graph data sets, we're running a month long competition to build the best graph data sets using Dune and OpenRank. But you can find all of that basically on my twitter and also just go to read dot cryptodatabies.com dot.
01:01:46.400 - 01:01:47.784, Speaker D: Literally everything is there.
01:01:47.872 - 01:01:49.980, Speaker C: Links will be in the description as well.
01:01:51.480 - 01:01:51.960, Speaker D: Great.
01:01:52.040 - 01:02:24.982, Speaker C: But yeah, thank you for doing all this. I think it's kind of lacking this education angle, and we're all like, if we look at how we learned to do crypto data, there's not really a standardized process that we can recommend. I'm constantly asked, how the fuck do I get to analyze to understand the blockchain and stuff? I don't necessarily know what to point to. And now I point to your stuff, which is by far the best that I know of. So, yeah, thank you for this. Thank you.
01:02:25.006 - 01:02:27.598, Speaker D: Thank you. Yeah, of course. My pleasure.
01:02:27.694 - 01:02:41.110, Speaker B: Yeah, echo on that. I like getting requests or questions from Normie data friends being like, how can I start on crypto data? And I just send our network thing? That's like forever ago that you've done with a bunch of people.
01:02:41.150 - 01:02:42.686, Speaker D: I need to do a new version of that.
01:02:42.758 - 01:03:45.946, Speaker B: Maybe, like, before we close out, I have another question for Andrew, which is, I guess, like a quick, just basic rundown of, like, what are the resources for people who want to look into Solana data? Like, what are the data ecosystem? Or, like, the data tooling for Solana? So far we know Dune has Solana data. Is there any other platform has Solana data? And, like, do you just use basically social scan and. Or pretty much has to be something like, you have to dig into each project's docs and code and stuff, and that's question one, or basically generate your tips for people to dive into Solana data. Second is, what's your outlook? Or basically your suggestions for people to solve this problem. Like Solana is so data, so hard to query. Like what do you see as the challenges needs to be addressed to say either by Solana foundation or all the apps developer building on Solana, or maybe just missing a data tooling or platform dedicated for Solana. Like what can be done to improve this current situation? So two questions.
01:03:46.058 - 01:04:23.550, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's a great, great set of questions. That is exactly the presentation that I'm going to be giving at Solana Breakpoint in September is just showing them. Here's everything I can do on ethereum tooling. Here's what I have to do with Solana and just showing them. I have probably a dozen helper queries to help me find one. Was an account created who owned this account at a given time? Give me this function call that included this account because you have account lists I can look for. Like show me a Jupyter swap that included this pumped off on token.
01:04:23.550 - 01:05:14.500, Speaker D: I've built a bunch of queries with this tooling on its own. I might have to just go build a repo or some CLI for this. I'm hoping that the explorers like Solana FM and Solscanhorn build better tooling for exploring this data. Solana FM is, I think, pushing a lot of the barriers here in terms of you can actually filter by instruction, which is already a big step up from last year where you couldn't even filter out failed transactions. You go to any program and it's like, oh, it's all failed transactions. I guess I can't use this, but it's extremely limited, to be honest. It's just me with my ten or 20 utility dune queries and then hoping and praying that one of the explorers can help.
01:05:14.500 - 01:05:55.828, Speaker D: And a lot of my time is spent dming the devs, which is like, the devs are actually very responsive and happy to explain the code to you, they just won't document it. So, like all of my blogs that you've seen me put out, probably 60% of that is like telegram messages and explainers from Devs at Orca, Solana Foundation, Jito whatnot. They just don't put it to doc. You kind of have to go and ask these people and build the relationships which has its pros and cons. But yeah, we could use a lot better tooling for sure. Like we've been spoiled on Ethereum, but.
01:05:55.964 - 01:06:16.884, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope that improves going forward and we see better tooling so we can have a better insight, like look into Solana. Yeah, thanks for, I think and also a really good starting point is looking at your queries and your dashboards and forking so you can dive into specific stuff from there.
01:06:17.052 - 01:06:17.724, Speaker D: Agreed.
01:06:17.812 - 01:06:53.480, Speaker A: All right, if there's no last words from anyone you've listened to. Index podcast thank you so much, Andrew, for coming on and for everything you do for this space. I think, like, especially the Solana ecosystem would still be a dark forest. Very happy to have had you on, I'm sure in the history of this podcast, we'll have you on again once you speedrun. Whatever ecosystem gets popular next might be up. Whatever's next to Monad or, like, near like, nobody knows, but it's all gonna be fun. I'm sure you're already looking forward to that.
01:06:53.660 - 01:06:55.496, Speaker D: Hey, I'm looking around. Looking around.
01:06:55.648 - 01:07:02.860, Speaker A: Yeah. But, yeah, thanks for listening and catch you in two weeks. Bye bye.
01:07:04.200 - 01:07:29.730, Speaker D: Crypto day wizards, come join us for the parade. Bag chiller, cherry picking liar. We call them out of that shot clown of Fire Index podcast crypto band fire.
