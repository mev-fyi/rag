00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.038, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to the index podcast, where the three of us come together every couple weeks to discuss on chain data charts, crimes, and metrics that move the crypto industry. With me, I have Denning on chain Corgi at flashbots, hildobi, resident data Hauself at Dragonfly, and myself. That is boxer community powerhorse at Yoon. Before we properly start this episode, it we need to disclose that nothing we say here is legal, financial, investment tax, or even life advice. The views expressed in the podcast are not representative of our employers, and we are acting independently of our respective professional roles. So with that, last week, we all hung out at Denver.
00:00:46.038 - 00:00:49.974, Speaker A: So maybe, dobby, how was your week in Denver?
00:00:50.022 - 00:01:20.550, Speaker B: It was awesome. I mean, it's really cool to meet a bunch of people that you work with, closed or not. The whole data community thing is like, we're all connected aside from our companies, and it's kind of cool to meet all those people, you guys as well. Then we also had lower points where we tried to book the podcast recording thing and we couldn't. And then. So it was empty most of the week. So that was not as happy at the moment.
00:01:20.550 - 00:01:23.286, Speaker B: But overall, very cool week.
00:01:23.388 - 00:02:01.138, Speaker C: Yeah, I liked it. I had a more packed agenda of meeting the teams, and I didn't even go to the main venue until last very day. I was at the MeB side events. The one organized by Titan was pretty cool. There was like a heated panel of all the block builders on the stage, and the moderator was asking unhinged question about, are you guys going to launch a relay, et cetera. And there was like a photo taken by someone who was like, oh, that's 90% of blocks of Ethereum on the stage, which is like, by three top builders. So it was quite interesting event.
00:02:01.138 - 00:02:21.958, Speaker C: I learned about execution tickets by Mike Neuter, like the new EPBs direction, et cetera. Yeah. And also great to see y'all in the venue briefly. Dune happy Hour was cool. Like, a lot of the data people were out there. Low lights was definitely like, Denver sucks. I'm just a hater.
00:02:21.958 - 00:02:29.814, Speaker C: Denver, it's so cold and it's also so dry. My nose was bleeding every day. Yeah, and it's dusty, kind of.
00:02:29.952 - 00:02:49.330, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know who decided that Denver was the place we're all going to meet at in strange. I think it just developed like this historically, but also my lips and my nose, they were absolutely fucked. I've never had it this bad in my life. It was insane.
00:02:49.990 - 00:02:54.882, Speaker B: I think it used to be a small meetup with locals there. And that's why going to this.
00:02:55.016 - 00:03:16.406, Speaker A: Yeah. Crazy how these things go. I also, like, pretty good week. We had a dune company on signed at the same time. So I also met a bunch of dune people. We kind of aligned on product directions and stuff. But, yeah, in general, it's really cool to always meet wizards wherever you go, especially as a dune employee.
00:03:16.406 - 00:03:27.920, Speaker A: You can just walk around a conference with a dune shirt and somebody will go, oh, my God, you work at Dune. This is amazing. I love the product. You're just like, yeah, we're trying our best. It's always quite a humbling experience.
00:03:28.450 - 00:03:40.660, Speaker C: So funny. Like, the very last day, I went to the main venue to meet Dobby. He said he was, like, working with dune dashboards. And then you and another dune guy walked over like, oh, you're a dune user. And.
00:03:43.750 - 00:04:17.406, Speaker A: Bernard and me, we were just hanging out, and Bernard spotted from the distance, like, hey, this guy's working on Dune. Turns out to be Dobby, which was pretty hilarious. Just a total coincidence. But, yeah, overall, really cool to also meet kind of the north american wizards before I mostly meet the european and I guess the asian people because they have an easier time coming to Europe. But now I actually met quite a few people who are based in North America as well. So, yeah, just real good times. The conference itself is, like, giant, and it was really interesting for me.
00:04:17.406 - 00:05:09.514, Speaker A: It's always like, really, I have a good time just asking questions and going deeper and going deeper. And usually it's not really socially acceptable to just ask 100 questions, but if the people are in the booth, they need to answer my questions. So I have a really good time just pressuring them and asking not the nicest questions sometimes, but, yeah, really engaging conversations. And you can really kind of load your brain with a lot of content with a lot of understanding and kind of the vibes of the industry. So I think while it is very time intensive and your usual work productivity really suffers in such a week, I think long term, it's always useful to kind of go to these conferences, like, once in a while. So, yeah, with our weeks in Denver covered, one big topic that repeatedly came up in conversations. There is the blast launch.
00:05:09.514 - 00:06:09.554, Speaker A: And just to kind of recap, blast launched their chain, or like, they announced their chain in November 2023. So that's four months ago. And their initial chain in quotation marks was just a fancy multisig, so they didn't really have a chain. They were just like, hey, deposit your money with us. You're going to get the native yield, which is the whole kind of trademark, or the whole pitch of blast is they are developing an l two, which has the native yield for DAi or USDB, however, they call that, which basically deposits stable coins into the maker reserve module. And then they have Ethereum, which they deposit into the liquid staking module of Lido. And basically, up until February 20 eigth or 29th, this capital was just sitting around there.
00:06:09.554 - 00:06:24.710, Speaker A: It was not like an actual chain, but rather it was just sitting in this smart contract, multisig, and they had gathered an insane 2.2 billion in tbL. So that's pretty insane. So maybe let me share my screen real quick.
00:06:24.780 - 00:06:25.750, Speaker B: Let's do this.
00:06:25.900 - 00:07:15.430, Speaker A: So 2.2 billion in TbL. And for those just listening, we are now opening up DFI llama, and we're looking at a chart which basically just shows the pre launch farm blast TbL. And surprisingly, if we look at this in us dollar terms and in ETH terms, because ETH went up 70% during, like during the time from November when blast first launched to now. And surprisingly, if we look at the US dollar and the ETH chart, they're not that different, even though ETH went up quite a bit. So what that basically tells us is that continuously during the whole time this farm was live, people were depositing funds in there, which is quite surprising to me. I would have not expected this.
00:07:15.430 - 00:08:04.306, Speaker A: I only looked at this data yesterday, the first time, and very surprising that there's so many people who are kind of not late to the party, but in mid December, end of December, they were like, yeah, let me deposit my eth into blast, which is. I can't really rationalize that decision. But in the end, I think a lot of blast TBL was big farming capital. So maybe it was just this was the best opportunity for them, risk adjusted to deploy their capital in this yield opportunity. So I guess it's not really the retail users who are driving a lot of this, but more like the big farmer or like the professional farmers. So, yeah, that for that. And then Blast finally launched February 20 eigth.
00:08:04.306 - 00:08:58.470, Speaker A: I think I wrote this down somewhere like twelve days ago. I wrote down twelve days ago, but not the date. That's just pretty stupid, but yeah. So blast finally converted to actually being a chain. They chose the optimism stack, but they didn't choose to be part in the super chain. So maybe the superchain is, if you follow certain methodologies or certain standards, that the optimism collective is kind of enforcing, so that all the chains are kind of interoperable, in case they ever get to a level where they can more easily do interoperability in the future. Blast did not choose to follow the super chain standard because Blast has made too many changes in their kind of core mechanisms just because of the native yield and all of this jazz.
00:08:58.470 - 00:09:39.218, Speaker A: But they're still using the optimism stack. So in the end, they kind of benefit from what optimism has developed in the open source stack there. And yeah, in the beginning there was like a bit of unclarity. There's a bunch of articles from blockworks or from other news outlets where there's like, ah, blast has lost all of its TVL. But then what ended up happening is just defi llama is only. So Defi llama had indexed the multi stick contract that was the bridge, or like, that is supposedly the bridge, but it ended up that you didn't. So if you actually funds moved into a different smart contract.
00:09:39.218 - 00:10:16.786, Speaker A: So it looked like a lot of capital left the blast bridge, but in the end it just moved somewhere else. And now, twelve days after launch, we are at 2.66 billion in bridged total value locked. So I think there's a net outflow of 50k in ether. So I think the ether terms here are more kind of. That's the better metric to look at because the market is sending so hard at the moment. So at the time the bridge or the pre farm finished, we are sitting at 670k ether in value.
00:10:16.786 - 00:11:01.198, Speaker A: So it's not 670k ether, but rather the stable plus the ether in the bridge contract were worth 670k ether, and now we're sitting at 650k worth of ether, even though the ether price has gone up. So nominally they've actually lost 20k in ether. But since the prices are all going up, the TbL overall has, like, in dollar terms has increased. So, yeah, what does all of this tell us and what is actually happening on blast? So if you look at the blast protocols and for those of you just listening, we're still on the DFI llama page. There's kind of a lot of new names here. There's a few names which are kind of noticeable. I kind of remembered Basabi from 2021.
00:11:01.198 - 00:11:28.662, Speaker A: This was like the peak DFI yield farming era. I think I lost quite a lot of money in their pool too. So no good memories from me to Palsabi, but fair enough. And there's not a lot of kind of reputable protocols deployed here. So there's no uniswap, there's no Avo, there's no maker. I mean, maker is being used in the background, but maker itself hasn't deployed here. And yeah, just a lot of new names.
00:11:28.662 - 00:12:21.702, Speaker A: And I overheard some conversations at ETH Denver that basically what is happening is that a lot of teams, they basically forked themselves or they just spun up a new entity and are now operating under a new name in the blast ecosystem. So if you've previously kind of had whatever, I don't want to put bad names on any protocol now, so I'm just going to like, I don't know, some like uniswap v two fork on Phantom or polygon or whatever. They just have a new skin now. And now they're operating on blast as, I don't know, pec finance or orbit protocol or thruster. And I think sometimes the associations are publicly known. So they've actually kind of like, they've publicly said, hey, we're going to do this. And this is like a project that the team's also taking on.
00:12:21.702 - 00:12:46.930, Speaker A: But I think there's also quite a few protocols of basically like, we are a new team. And since the old team or the team that was operating on, I don't know, mitus was anon, they can just sprout up in a new place and this place is now blast and they're basically rinse and repeating their, I don't know, they're siffening grant money on Matis and now they're kind of like farming the developer airdrop on blast.
00:12:50.230 - 00:13:32.800, Speaker B: In a way it makes sense where as a dev, if you're working on a now dead chain and you see this chain that's just launched with all this liquidity and you have a chance to be like first mover and there's like 50% of the upcoming airdrop or something going to protocols. So there's a good flywheel for potentially your protocol doing well there. And so I guess if it wasn't doing so well in other chains or if you just want to expand, there's probably a good rationale here, but of course it's a degen chain, maybe for now and kind of a bet on its future more than anything.
00:13:35.830 - 00:13:45.774, Speaker C: People are saying there are going to be so many scams on blast, but I'm not aware of what exactly are you guys aware of any projects that's scam on blast?
00:13:45.822 - 00:13:54.760, Speaker B: I mean, why more or less than other chain launches, maybe? I don't know, but I'm not really looking for scams, so I don't really know.
00:13:56.010 - 00:13:58.940, Speaker A: Let me ape into some scam farms. Let's go.
00:14:01.550 - 00:14:22.382, Speaker B: Memcoin was like a thing. There's several few meme coins that launched and were announced prior to the launch of the main net. So maybe that's where it comes from, where it's like DGen heavy. And therefore if it attracts dgen, they'll probably have a lot of scams as a result. But yeah, I don't know if there's much proven to that.
00:14:22.436 - 00:15:11.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so for those legit projects here. So if you're a uniswap fork or if you're Ava v. Two fork or something like this. Actually, I think the game theory basically plays out in a way that it's an EV plus action to just stay in the game and actually farm the airdrop legally. I think if you kind of weigh like committing a crime versus just getting money from the developer, airdrop from blast, I think that turns out to be the better decision in a lot of cases. And that's basically the whole playoff. Last year they've tried to do a good kind of web two inspired GTM motion, the same play that they did with blur, just rinse and repeat, or not rinse and repeat, but basically evolved that playbook to be like, hey, we can actually power a whole chain with this.
00:15:11.774 - 00:16:19.286, Speaker A: Maybe put a little bit of innovation with the native yield on this chain. And now they're basically trying to get developers to deploy on this chain with a developer incentive program. And this developer incentive program is designed in a way where it's mostly kind of like not BD heavy and you don't need to lobby for grants or something, but rather the smart contracts that are deployed on the chain and that are getting usage are actually just going to get airdropped. The points or gold I think, is like the internal name that they're using for this. So it is really interesting where a lot of other chains are. Basically they have this very heavy BD process and you need to submit governance proposals and do all of this stuff. Basically what blast is doing here is they're more or less employing this retroactive program where they're like build something useful, make people use the contract on our chain and we're actually going to reward you with the native chain tokens without having heavy BD or all of this bells and whistles or hoops you need to jump through.
00:16:19.286 - 00:17:06.390, Speaker A: So we'll see how this ends up. I think this is like blurred the founder, Pac man, whatever his real name is, I forgot. He's really keyed into are like he's learned the lessons that all of these other chains are painfully learning slowly. And we'll see if this actually has attracted any useful builders or any good builders, maybe as a last aspect from the data side, even though there's so much bridge TVL. So bridge TVL is not value locked on the chain, but rather just like, how many stables and how much eth is on the chain they place eight or nine. So really impressive number, actually. They've surpassed optimism.
00:17:06.390 - 00:17:09.490, Speaker A: Wait, have they surpassed optimism?
00:17:09.570 - 00:17:18.120, Speaker B: Wait, in terms of l two, is there like third? I think if you just look at total bridged roll ups. Yeah, optimism. I think.
00:17:19.850 - 00:17:56.530, Speaker A: Optimism has mayor, but they've basically like, they're in the top ten of bridged TVL chains. So that's super impressive for a chain that's twelve days old, basically. So we'll see if actually something useful comes with this. What I can say for right now is that even though there's all of this TVL, and theoretically there's a lot of users, there's very little Dex activity, or in general, I don't think there's that much interesting stuff happening on this chain. So we will see how this actually turns out. I think users will kind of keep grinding for the points and for the airdrop. There's a lot of other interesting things happening at the moment.
00:17:56.530 - 00:18:46.050, Speaker A: So maybe that's actually kind of bad for blast in a sense, because it's not really the most exciting thing. And the casino is not spinning as fast on blast as of now. And how do you get the casino over on blast? So, yeah, that's my short recap of what's happening on blast. And, yeah, really a big topic in Denver. I don't know, lots of conversations which are like, is your project going to deploy there? And is dune going to integrate blast and what is happening here? So, yeah, it really has captured a lot of attention, which is compared to all the other, I don't know, there's so many l two s and layer ones who had even booth in the actual east Denver. And you just walk past them and be like, whatever. Another l two and blasters, really, we're talking about it.
00:18:46.050 - 00:18:54.374, Speaker A: They've captured the attention, they've captured a lot of rich capital. So, yeah, we'll see how this story ends up.
00:18:54.572 - 00:19:39.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like this chain is definitely going to be more like a yield heavy or speculation heavy chain. And in east Denver, most thing I've heard, it was like it's going to be a shit show because all the developer tools aren't even ready. A bunch of devs complained to me about even the node provider. You can only use quick node back then to deploy on blust, but then the node doesn't even allow you to query per block range specified, et cetera. So it's just really a pain in the ass to integrate blast and seems like it was kind of like a shisho after the launch, but I guess it's live now. This morning I saw they were down for a few minutes after Duncan upgrade, but they're back now, so we'll see how it goes.
00:19:42.090 - 00:20:51.130, Speaker B: You confuse me with this morning because for me it was like 2 hours ago, which in the middle of afternoon I always forget, but my bad. It's funny because I think they're the first one to have native yields and you have manta that tried to pivot into doing the same thing in December. So Blast had their reward program starting from November up until like two weeks ago or something. And Manta was like okay, we're going to front run them by basically doing the same program but even more dgen starting in December and only making it last a month. So we launched prior to Blast, but I think if you look on l two beats you'll see like Manta is number four behind blast, but I don't know much going on on mental, which has launched a bit earlier. While I like I've heard more about things launching on Blast, so I don't know what the reasoning here is. Maybe it's just like Blast has the bigger branding and was the first mover and the first one to do all this, whereas mental was more of a copycat.
00:20:51.130 - 00:21:19.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just curious on how that plays out in the long term. I think native yield does make sense for the end user, though on a protocol level. It's not really how it was intended or how it was designed, but it makes sense to have the user not being diluted to death through native yield of ether and stablecoins, especially since funds are often just sitting there.
00:21:19.692 - 00:21:32.634, Speaker C: Anyways, speaking of l two s, I remember a lot of people were talking about bitcoin layer two as well at East Denver, so I think Dobby going to walk us through about some findings and data there.
00:21:32.832 - 00:21:37.594, Speaker B: Yes, so give me 1 second while I share my screen.
00:21:37.792 - 00:22:04.446, Speaker C: First of all, I don't know why bitcoin layer two. My general understanding is that people think now there is capital flowing through bitcoin ETF and people want to use bitcoin in a more easier way. You could use the WBTC on Ethereum, but they want the capital to be bridged off from bitcoin. So there's needs of using bitcoin layer two, and they are supposedly all EVM compatible.
00:22:04.558 - 00:22:51.890, Speaker B: And that's all I understand all more or less. So I first want to roll it back to the original state of what was the first layer two, which is lightning, which isn't a layer two in how you would compare it to what you have on Ethereum. So it only is for transfers, but has much lower fee and everything. And you can see that usage. It hasn't ever really been crazy high in terms of usage, but also it's been going down lately. So this has been the main known staple of bitcoin in a way, and was a big part of, I think it was launched in 2018. So that was a big development for the chain.
00:22:51.890 - 00:24:08.598, Speaker B: Then you had others come in and one of them was stacks, which also launched in, I think, 2018, and was, you can compare it more maybe to Polygon, where it's a side chain more than an l two that you'll find on Ethereum, much like optimistic roll ups or Zk roll ups. So technically, while it is connected to the bitcoin chain, it really can sustain on its own, and I think it tracks the state rather than the actual every transaction those are settled off chain. So that's why you are able to have much lower costs. And this didn't get much traction until maybe later on, where actual inscriptions came around and you could settle on bitcoin and have actual proofs posted on bitcoin. That's where it came through TVL. You also have another one, which you may have heard of, which isn't either an l two, but Thor chain, which is another one, but it's a bit controversial. So the point of thor chain is to bridge native assets across chains.
00:24:08.598 - 00:25:19.826, Speaker B: So one of the main ones being east to bitcoin. The problem here that I'm showing is a tweet that shows that a lot of the transfers are used basically for kind of like scammers moving across chains to obfuscate where the funds are headed. So that's just one thing, is just that there isn't any check. You're not going to get censored. So it's just an easy way for anyone, including, of course, bad actors, to bridge off of ethereum onto bitcoin and just keep shuffling funds until hopefully you've lost the y hats trying to track you, I guess, or you move first onto the exchanges before they're able to alert them and say, hey, can you block these funds? That's just an unfortunate development, but that's thought chain. I don't know if they've done much work there, or if they've actually iterated on Thor chain in a way to make it like, it's hard to have permissionless chain that also prevents bad actors. But I don't know, maybe this is.
00:25:19.848 - 00:25:48.906, Speaker A: Basically the tornado thing repeated, right, where it's like, are you really trying to be permissionless? Or, I don't know, do you want to prevent North Korea or Russia to use your protocol? And it's a really hard philosophical debate and question, but I don't know. Torchain doesn't seem to give a fuck. I haven't seen any communication from them being like, no, we're going to implement censoring or whatever.
00:25:49.088 - 00:26:39.446, Speaker B: Yeah, they would lose most of the volume if they prevented this. So it's kind of like, it's hard to. Which side do you choose? Do you choose being greedy or do you choose being right? And I guess they chose the first one for now, maybe that changes. And then you had another development that you heard about which are ordinals. So ordinals are, in a way, roughly to put nfts on the bitcoin blockchain, but really it's encryption. So you are submitting JSON packets on bitcoin, to put it simply. And the major difference will be that the metadata is going to be posted on the bitcoin blockchain straight away rather than being off chain like on other, erc.
00:26:39.446 - 00:27:41.054, Speaker B: 720 ones at ERC. And what I want to show here is how actually some of the, if you look in the top few, some of the more prominent nfts overall in terms of market cap, although I mean, for more illiquid tokens, market cap isn't necessarily the best metrics, but I guess it's the best we have, probably. You can see that node monkeys here is like second to board apes. And if you look throughout the top 20, you'll see quite a bunch of bitcoins in there. So it is a prominent chain. There's probably fewer Solana ones than bitcoin ones, for example, which I would have guessed the opposite, but I think this comes from Solana. We have more public access to Solana data, whereas bitcoin usage especially, I honestly, I know little less on the data and also because usage of the bitcoin ordinals seem to have stayed like they've stemmed from the asian side of the world.
00:27:41.054 - 00:27:51.986, Speaker B: So we probably didn't see it coming as much. So, yeah, that's another thing. And if we look overall. If we look overall, sorry, if you.
00:27:52.008 - 00:27:58.690, Speaker C: Click on the number of owners of the ranking of this NFT number of owners.
00:27:58.770 - 00:28:27.790, Speaker B: Yeah, there's fewer for node monkeys, so I guess it's not as spread out. But also those are younger, so supply holders tend to grow over time. So maybe this is just an impact of them being younger relative to board apes. Honestly, I don't know the dynamics exactly of holders on board apes and node monkeys. Maybe there's something there. I honestly don't know. But yeah, it's probably more whale heavy on node monkeys.
00:28:27.790 - 00:28:33.598, Speaker B: But if you look. Wait, maybe. How could I?
00:28:33.684 - 00:28:41.982, Speaker A: Can we quickly put in plain words what we're looking at here? Was this the last 24 hours trade volume of NFT collections?
00:28:42.126 - 00:28:54.726, Speaker B: This is based on 24 hours. Let's look at 30 days. 30 days. I put 24 hours, but it roughly looks the same, even more skewed towards bitcoin, it seems on, if you look on 30 days.
00:28:54.908 - 00:29:23.142, Speaker A: Okay, just to put this in the plain words once, for anyone who's not looking at this website. Oh yeah. In the last 30 days, ordinals related collections or NFT collections on bitcoin are taking up maybe ten spots on the top 20 leaderboard of NFT volume in the last 30 day in nominal, like volume in us dollar.
00:29:23.306 - 00:30:11.360, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It doesn't necessarily mean, I think volume, it's hard to find a good source again for all in all because it's hard to track it. But I think volume is comparable to Ethereum Mainet's volume, but it overall isn't much higher. But it is higher in terms of, I guess, what high value nfts are going to be more prominent over there. And also because I think Ethereum overall hasn't moved all that much for nfts lately. In volume it's been relatively stable. It's grown slightly, but relative to previous 2021 highs, it's much lower.
00:30:11.360 - 00:30:51.390, Speaker B: We're yet to even come close to those. And I think the biggest price moves have been like budgie penguins moving up over the past three months and then over the past month with Ethereum going up, most of the nfts have gone down because I'm guessing people are exiting to get native assets. And also maybe it remains somewhat stable in USD value. Yeah, those are mostly guesses, to be honest. So it's just that bitcoin seems a lot more active lately in terms of NFT trading than Ethereum, which is surprising.
00:30:53.570 - 00:31:39.754, Speaker A: Could we maybe say that the NFT cycle, there's an NFT cycle happening on bitcoin just because they don't have access to shitcoins? There's so many meme coin and shitcoin trading happening on Sonana and Ethereum. And I think on bitcoin, even if we look at this list, there's some BRC 20 related nfts or something. So maybe this website just groups them weirdly and they're actually just fungible tokens and not really non fungible tokens. It's a weird thing, but it seems to me that almost like the meme cycle in bitcoin is more happening on the NFT side rather than on Ethereum and Solana, where it's on the fungible shitcoin side.
00:31:39.952 - 00:32:05.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think it's not as black and white as on Ethereum, where you have a clear cut between the two. So there's definitely some of this because you just can't have shitcoins on bitcoin. I mean, ERC 20s on bitcoins, I guess. So, yeah, there's definitely this. But what I wanted to get at with this ordinals, I didn't really want to talk about ordinals themselves. It was more about like.
00:32:05.054 - 00:32:23.690, Speaker B: Ordinals was the first practical application of inscriptions on bitcoin. But with those actually came other applications which are roll ups. Well, roll ups, l two s, which can mean a lot of things.
00:32:23.760 - 00:32:24.380, Speaker C: But.
00:32:26.590 - 00:33:18.620, Speaker B: The main two l two s on bitcoin, which if you look at like tvl now, Merlin is at like 2.1 billion in TvL. But I think I had it there in total, if you include the ordinals that bridge on there, there's almost 4 billion on there, which is quite a lot. And you also have B squared, which is another l two, but this one is yet to launch. I think the difference between the two is Merlin has launched and is on main net, whereas B squared is still on testnet. And Merlin is currently in its pre farming program where people are essentially mining the main governance coin that will come later. That is called merrow, basically.
00:33:18.620 - 00:33:50.630, Speaker B: So that's also why the high TVL. I think one interesting thing is the reason these are able to grow so quickly. So to such high TVL. I mean, if you look at the TVL charts, it's kind of insane. That spike, how it basically started in February and over a month it's gathered substantial amount of money. And that's because bitcoin is just full of very dormant capital that's just sitting there and doing nothing. So you might as well bridge your bitcoin.
00:33:50.630 - 00:34:36.070, Speaker B: If you're fine with the risk factor of bridging it, you might as well bridge it to farm another token, if it wasn't doing anything else in the first place. In that sense, it does make sense, if that's your goal. But, yeah, we'll see how those develop. I think one interesting factor is if we look here. So here are the two recent raises of Merlin and B squared. And I looked through all those vcs because I wanted to see where there were based and I think it's a really good proxy for where interest is. And basically all of those, there's like 80% based in Asia.
00:34:36.070 - 00:35:02.614, Speaker B: There's only like uphonest is based in California. Two of them are based in Qatar, two in Seychelles. In the Seychelles? Yeah. And then one in London. And the rest is all Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul. Yeah. It's basically very concentrated over in Asia.
00:35:02.614 - 00:35:14.720, Speaker B: So that's probably why we. I mean, it seems very distant from us. All this maybe. I don't know about you guys. Do you guys hear a lot about bitcoin l two s? Or is it more something like you don't understand?
00:35:15.030 - 00:35:40.200, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it kind of all makes sense because the first time when I heard about bitcoin layer two was when the Asia people were talking about inscription, and inscription was really hot in Asia and there was so many trading and looking to bitcoin layer two mev ahead of time. So I think it's all chained together from the inscription ordinals. And now there's bitcoin layer two.
00:35:41.470 - 00:36:03.460, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All is related and it's basically this. It's kind of like. It feels similar to BNB maybe, where it's not a chain that I don't necessarily understand all that well and it's heavily tied to Asia. I don't know. It's interesting. I'm definitely curious to see how those things develop.
00:36:03.460 - 00:36:13.890, Speaker B: For now, for context, those are like just settling ZK proofs on bitcoin through inscriptions. So that's the only thing that really makes them layer two.
00:36:13.960 - 00:36:14.580, Speaker C: So.
00:36:18.730 - 00:36:58.574, Speaker B: You'Re not going to have optimistic roll ups like on Ethereum. You can have those, but you have EVM compatible chains. And in fact, there's even one of them where people have proposed to deploy unisoft v three. The chain is called rootstock. It's a side chain, so kind of like stacks, but it is ethereum compatible. And people are already looking into deploying existing Ethereum protocols on bitcoin l two s, which I thought was pretty interesting. But now this is all very much like in the proposal stage.
00:36:58.574 - 00:37:18.360, Speaker B: I don't know how the integration actually looks, how usable the chains are. I haven't played around with them. I think this will take a bit of time before we're past the farming stage and where we actually see actively used protocols on there. But it's probably worth keeping an eye on.
00:37:19.630 - 00:37:28.010, Speaker C: I have a question. So these are bitcoin layer two. And so do they submit the confirmation batch back to bitcoin, I guess.
00:37:28.080 - 00:37:29.130, Speaker B: Bitcoin chain.
00:37:29.470 - 00:37:39.600, Speaker C: I guess there's something you can submit in bitcoin chain rather than value transfer. So how is it taxed back to the bitcoin, you say consent, security or whatever.
00:37:40.290 - 00:37:55.060, Speaker B: It's just a ZK proof. That's a batch hash of transaction posted as inscriptions. That's basically it. That's all there is to it. I could technically deploy it now too.
00:37:57.930 - 00:38:02.994, Speaker C: The chain will submit transaction with inscription back to bitcoin chain.
00:38:03.122 - 00:38:04.310, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:38:04.380 - 00:38:05.160, Speaker C: Got it.
00:38:08.250 - 00:38:20.150, Speaker A: In the same field that people do encryptions now, they basically just post either the ZK proof or I guess you could also post the raw call data. The way that optimism, like the optimistic proofs do it today for Ethereum.
00:38:20.310 - 00:38:25.678, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's only ZK proof for now. And there's anyone posting code?
00:38:25.844 - 00:38:29.150, Speaker C: Not anymore. Not codeata anymore. Now it's blob.
00:38:31.330 - 00:38:32.378, Speaker B: Get with the plans.
00:38:32.394 - 00:38:56.390, Speaker A: Of an hour ago. But basically these are independent chains and there's no decentralized validator set. It's basically the same kind of decentralized theater that we are seeing on Ethereum chains. We are roll up or like we're using the security of bitcoin. And in the end all they're doing is like they're posting data on Mainnet.
00:38:57.610 - 00:39:42.034, Speaker B: It's like encryptions where the main thing is the narrative, where it's on bitcoin. And that's the biggest chain, regardless, it's the first one. And that is bound to attract people regardless of what we think, because we think like this being in the space. But people outside of the space may see this as like, oh, I'm going to use the application that's on bitcoin because that's the biggest chain. And I don't really care what the hell is going on behind the scene as long as I'm told it's secure, I guess. I don't know, but it'll be interesting to monitor how those develop. But I think in this dormant capital as well, which you don't really have on ethereum because you have on ethereum, but you can already use it on mainnet for all kinds of things that can't be done on bitcoin.
00:39:42.034 - 00:39:55.094, Speaker B: It's just sitting there. So you have funds that maybe you'll have yield bearing stuff on l two s. And that's already a huge thing for a huge unlock for anyone having capital sitting on bitcoin.
00:39:55.142 - 00:40:00.780, Speaker C: And are they mostly optimistic roll up or, like ZK. Or ZK. Okay.
00:40:01.230 - 00:40:02.074, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:02.272 - 00:40:11.006, Speaker C: And I saw that there is, like, wormhole bridge, that if you want to interact your assets between EVM chains with them, you can bridge it over anyway.
00:40:11.188 - 00:40:20.194, Speaker B: Yeah, that is possible. I don't know. If you say so. I trust you, but, yeah, I'm guessing there's bridges. Oh, really? Wait, what?
00:40:20.232 - 00:40:55.246, Speaker A: Yeah, that was in the uniswap governance proposal. Yeah, there's also t. There's also tbitcoin, which I talked to them at Eastburg. They actually have a trustless bridge on bitcoin. So it's kind of like, not really a smart contract, but it's a wallet that is managed by a federated validator set. And they have a kind of trustless bridge to kind of bridge your assets natively from bitcoin, the network, to another chain. Also quite interesting.
00:40:55.246 - 00:40:58.590, Speaker A: And I guess an alternative to wormhole.
00:40:58.930 - 00:41:04.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it is flourishing. There's even, like, restaking protocols starting to pop up on bitcoin.
00:41:06.310 - 00:41:09.422, Speaker C: It's just repeating all the narrative hype in Ethereum.
00:41:09.486 - 00:41:54.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's an easy playbook. Maybe it's a good career decision to go over to bitcoin. Everyone's going to think, oh, man, this guy is so smart. All you're doing is, like, repeating the Eth playbooks. There's people out there who are farming this career wise at the moment. With that out of the way, I think what I'm observing over the last couple of weeks is kind of a split in the market, where on the one hand we have institutional flows, which is like bitcoin etfs, and then on the other side, there's a lot of meme coin craze happening, and that's mostly focused on Solana. So maybe, Dobby, you've been posting these great updates on Twitter regarding the bitcoin ETF, since you're kind of like the guy to go to for this data.
00:41:54.990 - 00:42:13.398, Speaker A: So maybe if you could give us a high level take of what you see, and then, Danning, you've kind of participated in the Solana meme craze. So maybe we can see both sides of the trenches here. I think that's, like, a really interesting contrast or comparison that we can draw here.
00:42:13.564 - 00:42:18.700, Speaker C: Dobby is the official bitcoin guy for our podcast, and I'm the Solana girl now.
00:42:19.950 - 00:42:21.930, Speaker B: Damn. Okay. Tons have changed.
00:42:23.310 - 00:42:23.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:23.840 - 00:43:20.650, Speaker B: Bitcoin etfs have been interesting. So if you look at how etfs are traditionally being reported, they're just reported based on numbers reported out of like, Bloomberg terminal and everything like this. The difference here for bitcoin etfs, which, as a reminder, launched on January 10, they were approved by the SEC, and one of them was the grayscale bitcoin holding, which was converted into a bitcoin ETF. And since then, I've been looking into the flows, and my goal was instead of looking at reporting numbers, I wanted to look on chain and actually snoop around and see, okay, which addresses are holding those, trying to track the actual flows on chain and ensure that, because I think those are more interesting based on. That's just what I like to look at. And looking at on chain flows also add more context. You can see more metrics.
00:43:20.650 - 00:43:57.510, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's all kinds of things that are interesting here. So the main thing is going to be the flows themselves. Here you can see how the ten different ETF issuers have been seeing flows over the last few weeks. You see how originally you had high grayscale outflows and maybe somewhat high launch inflows for the other etfs, which slowly dwindled. But then over the past weeks, they've been back up quite a bit. And in fact, I think there's quite a few that are seeing record numbers lately.
00:43:57.510 - 00:45:07.150, Speaker B: So fidelity is one of them. With recent really high numbers, Blackrock also saw really high numbers, and like blackrocks just yesterday, so the flows happen on chain, the next day they're settled one day after being traded. That is according to the SEC's ruling, where you have one day settle it. So just yesterday there was 800 million and so much for Blackrock, which is its all time high again. So it's kind of crazy to see for an ETF these high of flows and continuously breaking all time highs just a few weeks after launch, that really rarely happens. And for context, we are now at 58 billion, which is a little over half that of gold etfs already. But as a reminder, a lot of it comes from Grayscale, which had a lot of bitcoin in its bitcoin trust that was there for a while prior to ETF being approved.
00:45:07.150 - 00:45:59.582, Speaker B: If you look, they had like 600,000 bitcoin. They've sold off a lot of them, so now just under 400,000. But interestingly, in terms of USD Aum, they're almost break even from the start, just because of bitcoin's price going up over time. So technically, they're just earning as much fees as they were on launch day, which I think is like the highest at like 1.5%. So they're doing very well over there. So far, 1% of bitcoins have moved into etfs, which is like, I think, way out of people's expectation. And that's also what has driven a lot of the price hike recently, if you annualized that number.
00:45:59.582 - 00:46:39.420, Speaker B: So currently there's like 4% backing etfs, 4% of the bitcoin supply. And if you annualized the past two weeks of flows, roughly 8.2% of bitcoins would be absorbed into etfs, which is really insane. It has the impact of the housing from not the previous one, but the one before. So it's quite a wild impact on supply and why that hasn't been seen in a very long time. So, yeah, it's kind of interesting. It's kind of cool.
00:46:39.420 - 00:47:13.842, Speaker B: We talked about it previously. There's rumors of the ECTF happening sometimes this year, the first deadline is end of May. I think now that speculation is around 20% of that happening, because not much has happened on it, and we're just a few weeks away. The other next deadline is going to be in August. This one has a higher probability, obviously, because further away. So maybe things will have moved by then. But, yeah, it'll be interesting to monitor if the same happens on Ethereum.
00:47:13.906 - 00:47:19.130, Speaker C: Okay, the 8% number, did you consider that happening in April?
00:47:20.510 - 00:47:42.400, Speaker B: This is just looking at etfs. So if you only look at etfs and the flows. So the past two week, if you look at, I guess, those numbers here, the past two weeks, and you spread the two weeks onto a year, you would see that 8% is being absorbed into the etfs. Does that make sense?
00:47:43.350 - 00:47:51.940, Speaker C: You're saying it's bitcoin supply, percent absorption. So it's like your denominator is total supply of bitcoin. Right?
00:47:55.290 - 00:48:06.902, Speaker B: Yeah, I am factoring all the consideration I have, the model of how the supply is going to look over time. And, yeah, it's factoring all this. I see.
00:48:06.956 - 00:48:20.540, Speaker C: It's also kind of interesting to see this daily bar chart. And every five days there is a bar, and there's, like two days missing. And there's five days they're still operating in a boomer banking way. Like, only five days.
00:48:22.050 - 00:49:04.700, Speaker B: I've now also started to know a lot more about when banking holidays are in the US, because if you see there's a three day hole in the middle. Yeah, it was like president's day. That's interesting. It's a big throwback to the old system, but it's cool to see it. Like, I think it's kind of cool to see this kind of bridge between treadfi and crypto. So yeah, that's what stemmed this analysis. It is kind of maintenance heavy because every day I need to look into, so maybe I can show for quick context how I look through it.
00:49:04.700 - 00:49:51.078, Speaker B: I know that blackrock. For now, right after this podcast, I'll be looking into where those 800 million come from. And I've kind of familiarized myself with the patterns and how coinbase custody handles them. And you can see how they tend to increment by round numbers of 600. So these are the wallets I've tagged from yesterday. But if you look at today, you'll see, wait, those are still yesterday. Do I see any with 600 and not tagged? Okay, maybe they haven't popped on yet, but I'll eventually see some with like 600 and I'll know that those also all are funded through the same Coinbase custody address.
00:49:51.078 - 00:50:27.574, Speaker B: And there's a pattern to it. So that's how I identify them. But it is very manual and I'm up to right now I'm just under 3000 addresses overall that I'm tracking throughout all the issues. But my goal is to force those issuers into disclosing those addresses and proof of funds. Because at the end of the day, my goal isn't to dox everyone at all. My goal is here doing so because there's actual investors behind and who have custody their money through them. So you might as well leverage this whole thing.
00:50:27.574 - 00:50:55.920, Speaker B: The blockchain enables, which is transparency. And if you look now, there's only 21 shares has shared a proof of fund. So I'm tracking 37,800. So these are the flows from today. So there's probably 1000 or so bitcoin that moved today as well. But otherwise we're in the same ballpark. When I have updated every day, I check that I'm on the same number and I am.
00:50:57.650 - 00:50:58.542, Speaker C: I have a question.
00:50:58.596 - 00:51:00.240, Speaker B: Oh wait, yeah, I forgot. Here.
00:51:01.330 - 00:51:08.050, Speaker C: With all these addresses you labeled, are you able to label who are the top holder of bitcoin on the chain?
00:51:09.110 - 00:51:58.206, Speaker B: It's an individual. I know how to label Blackrock now because they have a similar pattern, but each of them have a distinct pattern in how things are done. So for now it's all in my head. I know what I'm doing because I've done it so much that now I know what I'm looking for. But the original idea is you have so many people who are moving these high amounts on chain, so already that singles out so many wallets. And then from there you're just looking for a set of addresses that matches roughly the reported number. The only problem is that the reported numbers are going to be in dollars and they're going to be in dollar denominated based on the bitcoin price from yesterday.
00:51:58.206 - 00:52:10.520, Speaker B: So I look at the average price of bitcoin yesterday during trading hours, the average price of today, and then I do, what is the ratio between those to get a sense of what I'm looking for?
00:52:11.290 - 00:52:24.982, Speaker C: Yeah, but my question is, are you able to say, tell people, reveal what's the top ten bitcoin holders, for example, because I've heard us government and China government are on the top five holding.
00:52:25.046 - 00:53:23.290, Speaker B: Bitcoin, which I think Arkham should have this because they're regularly, when they shared their grayscale sloughing thing, where they found all their holdings, I think back in September, that's when they discovered that they are actually in the top five. I can't remember exactly. One of the top five holders of bitcoin and the first one to actually associate all those holdings to one single entity because it's so spread out across. Like the reason why there's so many addresses is because Coinbase custody spreads out their holdings by chunks of like 1000 bitcoins or something, and they also regularly shuffle them. So every two weeks or so, Blackrock is going to remove all their addresses, move to all new ones, and is really annoying. But that's how it just, I'm guessing it's for security purposes. Of course, that makes a lot of sense.
00:53:23.290 - 00:54:08.330, Speaker B: And you don't want to have everything held in one address. And I'm guessing they have systems that are put in place to handle all this for them. It's interesting to reverse engineer the systems and try and understand why and how those work. There's definitely a lot more work to be done at. If you follow Arkham on Twitter, you'll see them regularly doxing new high entities. I think they recently did maybe the british government and maybe the german one or something. And there was like the biggest ethereum traded product that was finally found on chain today or yesterday in Europe.
00:54:08.330 - 00:54:33.314, Speaker B: And that's also a very big holder in terms of, you know, there's a lot of stuff to be done in terms of labeling, and labeling in the open source side is still a very lacking thing. There's a lot of work to be done and I think we can collaborate on this idea a lot more, show.
00:54:33.352 - 00:54:44.760, Speaker C: You guys a bunch of ridiculous meme from the Solana side of casino. So I guess, are you guys also trading on Solana or at all?
00:54:45.930 - 00:54:47.480, Speaker B: I got the saga phone.
00:54:50.270 - 00:55:16.210, Speaker A: The original one or the second one? Okay. Yeah, you're OG. Yeah. I've also started trading on Solana and it's a really nice experience in comparison to what we had to go through last cycle with Ethereum. I don't know, it is like all this bridging and all this bullshit on Solana. You can just, if you want to ape, you can ape. And transactions are basically free.
00:55:16.210 - 00:55:20.530, Speaker A: It's really a very smooth experience and it's a great casino.
00:55:20.870 - 00:55:34.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's definitely a better experience. But there's still problems that are very different to the ones you're going to see on Ethereum, where revert rate, for example, is going to be much higher and you're going to have a lot more failing transactions and stuff like this.
00:55:35.210 - 00:55:37.030, Speaker A: But I'll set your slippage.
00:55:38.170 - 00:55:43.306, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a whole topic there. I'm sure Daniel is going to cover this.
00:55:43.408 - 00:56:41.758, Speaker C: Yeah, I've experienced everything you guys mentioned last week. So disclaimer is that I'm not really like Djen Trader, but it was my first time a week ago because just like I have some Djen colleague around me who was telling me about the bok token and then the dog with hat token has been going up and then. So I guess it started as I think I started maybe end of last year, I went to a few meetup in SF and people were like, what's your new year prediction? And people are like, the new cycle comes up. Salana will always have its narrative, as in, it's a cheaper chain with better, higher throughput. I bought a bunch of bunk back then, maybe 5000 bunk, and I holded for like three months, kind of forgot about it. And then until last week, my colleagues were hitting me up and I was like, oh shit. My bonk went up to basically three x.
00:56:41.758 - 00:57:18.230, Speaker C: And so I sold it and he was like, you should buy this token called retardio. And I was like, what? Retardio. It's a funny name, but it's really funny. Like on a meme and you see this thing, but it's kind of too bad. It says it dated 911 and there's a lot of interesting meme, but we were like, this token is not going to be listed on Coinbase, so the potential is limited. And when I noticed this token, it was already going down. But then the next one my friend told me was like oh, you should get on Joe Bowden.
00:57:18.230 - 00:57:59.330, Speaker C: So Joe Boden as he misspelled from Joe Biden and I don't know, it was like this wrecked face apparently. It's like how does it mimicking the politician? And then also a lot of good memes. So I got on Joe Bowden and then 12 hours later it's like four x and I was like oh shit, let me sell it. But then so many problems of when you're holding. I only bought 2000 and it become like 8000 and it's already a really big whale size. So I wasn't able to sell it with slippage threshold set to 0.5% as default on Jupiter aggregator.
00:57:59.330 - 00:58:39.742, Speaker C: So I had to broaden it to 1%, sell it in three trades pretty much like a manual twap trade. But you will not get the price, you see because there's price impact, there is slippage. But I was still very happy. I think I end up with like six k or something actually I think 4600. Yeah. And then the next one after Joe Boden I discovered this whole salana starter kit. So you would want to trade on Jupiter aggregator, right? Because the aggregator will help you to get liquidity across like Raiden, orca and different amms.
00:58:39.742 - 00:59:22.542, Speaker C: And then in the Jupyter aggregator how to say interface, they link this particular token's specific basically token contract or program address and they link you to bird eye. So I got into this basically bird eye interface which is I think is like where all the djens, people who are using UI are looking at. And then I started looking like spotting some tokens like 20,000% up in 24 hours. And I starting to click into all those tokens. For example, this one is Alex Johns. So apparently the same family was a geobodom one. It was the same PFP thing.
00:59:22.542 - 01:00:11.038, Speaker C: And I discovered a bunch of token which was just 2 hours fresh and I was like oh okay. So I found one that's called baby whiff. I was like oh this is a nice one because whiff is kind of really too high. I know when you're doing ape djen trading you don't really care about the fundamentals but you still look at some numbers like for example like the market cap. So you know like the Dodge and Shiba token, those meme, how to say the mainstream memes are all around like 2 billion or 20 billion. And then when I checked I think the wif token, it was around already 2 billion. So I thought it's really pretty high, it's kind of too high.
01:00:11.038 - 01:00:58.846, Speaker C: And then when I found this token baby whiff it was around only 2 million. So I was like this token is going to go up just proportionately related to wif. So I bought it around maybe like 0.3 and it went up in 2 hours to almost a cent. And so it's like four x basically, or three x within just a few hours and I hold it slightly and then I sold them when it dropped until nine and I saw my trade of 6000 literally cost like a big dip right there. You see all these trades, a lot of them are only like $100 or like few dollars really. And then I was really lucky I got out of it.
01:00:58.846 - 01:01:35.402, Speaker C: So after that it has been dipping much lower. And one thing you want to keep attention to is you want to join the telegram group chats and see if it's popping. And a lot of those chats are actually now have a bot plugged in and showing all the buys. They don't show the sale, they only show the buy in the telegram group chat. So it's like so bullish. Oh another baby whiff bought buy of 20k or like 2000 et cetera. And the more you djen into these tradings you get so much pain about like you can't sell it reverts all the time.
01:01:35.402 - 01:02:29.146, Speaker C: Fenton actually as a wallet they provide a simulation before you submit, which is great, which has been pretty accurate. Whenever I see there is a revert in a simulation and I still submit, usually going to revert which I think is basically simulating all the slippage you're going to come from. And so yeah the next level would be like instead of using the UI on those aggregator interface you would want to use the telegram bots. So for example in bird eye interface they have this unibot button, they have bonkbot which is a solana telegram bots. Banana gong which is a big telegram bots on Ethereum is also on solana. But I think they said it could be sometimes buggy. They're still going to improve it later on when they have bandwidth et anyway.
01:02:29.146 - 01:03:16.630, Speaker C: So and then there's like a series of meme token after Joe Bowden came up like Martin Luther King, I have a dream and the meme is like Martin Luther King in that PFP format and with like a lambo. So I have a dream about lambo and then there's this one called Elizabeth Horan. So basically the politician like crypto relevant celebrity et cetera. Phantom Wallet posted about a list of meme coins and the list of a horrend account was like, you have to add this girl. And they were like, yeah, interacting, et cetera. It was quite funny. I saw another overheard tweet.
01:03:16.630 - 01:03:37.860, Speaker C: Well, Haseeb also had a tweet about all these meme coin was like some animal with. They misspell with as wif. So with all the genital parts of human. So like wolf with balls, et cetera. Gisturdo. I don't even know what that is.
01:03:40.230 - 01:03:48.500, Speaker A: I think that's supposed to be Justin Trudeau, the president of Canada. I think this is pretty.
01:03:49.270 - 01:04:38.578, Speaker C: And there was more like overheard tweet I saw like people were talking about Jitson, so which I think is Michael Jackson. And then there were also like Brown Armstrong, which is know Coinbase CEO was misspelled. Yeah, it's pretty wild, but people keep buying these things. There was definitely also a bunch of data coming like the whole Solana meme coin thing has definitely, how to say, bring up the whole usage on Solana. One chart here is showing the total amount bridged basically per chain. And Solana is now taking over compared to all the other chains, like pretty much number one compared to the second would be Ethereum and then Arbitron. But there are also a lot of chart crime.
01:04:38.578 - 01:05:25.700, Speaker C: I would say, for example, people are saying, oh, there's all time high of all the Solana wallet addresses. But really it can be so easy that this metrics to be gamble and you can deploy all the new things and all the new token addresses will be like a new contract address. It doesn't really say much. And especially if you're comparing that with other chain, it's saying like more usage and it's saying like non voting user transaction, more transaction compared to Ethereum, arbitron and all the other chain combined. So are you counting all the transaction or you're counting successful transaction? There could be such a huge spam amount of transaction if it's having a high revert rate as well.
01:05:27.030 - 01:06:02.394, Speaker A: Maybe if I can jump in quickly. It's also like the transactions of Solana are virtually free. And I think there's like a whole new kind of meta of meme coins on Solana which have like, they're basically like speed running the things that Ethereum meme coins did in 2021 in the span of ten days or like three days on Salana. This literally happens in hours. It's absolutely crazy. And then if you also look at the Jupiter DCA feature where you can down cost average into literally any token for virtually free. It's like that also is a huge part of transactions.
01:06:02.394 - 01:06:56.194, Speaker A: If you look at the transaction history of a lot of the meme coins on deck, screener or whatever you showed there earlier, bird eye, there's people literally cheating or buying coins via DCA, meme coins via DCA with literal $5 transactions, and then they just like every 10 seconds they'll buy this coin. It's just mental. There's so many charts which just look like absolute. I don't know, it just doesn't make any sense in general, even if you take away the transaction and addresses part of Solana, which is also weird, but you could solve that with the signer transactions. So it depends on the provider what they're actually counting, if it's like the actual accounts or if it's the signing transactions. But even then, nothing of this makes any sense to compare. I think in the end it's always like the economical value.
01:06:56.194 - 01:07:13.350, Speaker A: But then even if you look at the trades volume, it's like it's super hard. People just, you can do so much for so little amount of money. So I don't think at the moment we have any reasonable basis to even compare things anymore.
01:07:13.690 - 01:07:47.940, Speaker B: It's really hard to just everything cross chain compare statistics and that's like a growing problem because it's like more and more things are spreading out across chains. I know I'm seeing more and more demand for cross chain analytics, but it's hard. You can compare all super chains across one another because they're relatively on the same level and comparable. But comparing Solana to ethereuml one is very much, very hard because the user doesn't pay as much and it just doesn't have the same value as you said.
01:07:48.390 - 01:08:46.690, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. Yeah. So Mert from Helios was calling out this like it really doesn't make sense to compare number transactions, neither the active addresses, although I did see like Phantom Wallet, their official account posted about they reached the all time high in terms of monthly active wallets. They said a user, but I guess wallets, unless they have a way to maybe group by all the different. So I'm not sure if they're talking about actually wallets or maybe like UI wise tracking because one person can have multiple wallets loaded into one device id, but they posted that they've reached like a 4 million monthly active user all time high. And along with all these meme coin frenzy, who is making the most money? Which is I think the trading bot is like making shit ton of money. And this sole trading bot is one of the, I guess like sniping bot.
01:08:46.690 - 01:09:59.420, Speaker C: Whenever there's a new meme coin getting deployed you always see there's a spike going up crazy in the beginning which is usually because of the sniping. And this is definitely the most profitable, how to say the period for you to make the most gain because all the token most of them they launch with the digits considering the fee they're charging per swap which is going to time up two hundred k per day for each of the bot. So this is like sole trading bot and in one day they're making around 200k fee. And then I have this other chart dash from whale Hunter. It's listing basically this how to say I think this is bunk bot and per day fees also is like crazy in that just one week and it's like two hundred k per day and then like banana gone. They have both Ethereum volume and Salana volume. Actually when you compare here, their salana volume is quite small.
01:09:59.420 - 01:10:28.930, Speaker C: So banana gown is quite big on Ethereum but they're also available on salana but not really big on Salana. But yeah, times them altogether. Their total fee was also around like 300k. Combining Ethereum salana in that week. Pretty crazy. And imagine what's the annual revenue for all these teams. I think this is the most promising investment a VC can do, which is telegram bots.
01:10:28.930 - 01:11:38.330, Speaker C: And in the new bull cycle with all this meme casino thing, well I'm not justifying know it's the greatest product because it does have private key security issue. Although I did talk to banana gun team people in east Denver and they are actually quite legitimate group of people and they are actually trying to design some a wallets kind of like extension so user can actually store their funds there without worrying about giving out private key and et cetera. But I'm just saying that this app will be the one that's making the most money in the bull run with all this retail meme crazy money. But also they're probably too rich to be invested. Yeah it's really crazy. It definitely bring up all the telegram bots usage and also how to say overall fee. But I will say there's maybe not a twist but there's a new development after all this which is Jito, which is the mev boost basically or like the flashbox equivalent on Solana Jito Labs.
01:11:38.330 - 01:12:55.682, Speaker C: They posted an announcement like a few days ago about shutting down their service, about providing the mempool. So for how to say general context wise searchers are using this mempool service to submit their transactions and potentially do sandwiching on Solana. So basically, pretty much, I think the only mev service on Solana now is basically shut down by the team themselves because of the negative externalities impacting users on Solana. And looks like this decision is made in collaboration or know by the order of Solana ecosystem stakeholders. So I would assume like Solana foundation overall or maybe few other teams, they all felt the users are complaining about high river and bad ux in terms of this high activity of meme coin and bot activity. So for the benefits of user, they shut this down. And it kind of caused a bunch of discussions in the beginning, the first reaction was like, you shutting down this service, other people can spin it up still.
01:12:55.682 - 01:13:42.610, Speaker C: So is that really good thing to do? But I think one thing is their code base is private, so it's not going to be like anyone can just fork and spin it up. So it really is shutting down actually the only private mempool service on Solana. And I've also talked to some Solana searcher and they said, now, if you want to sandwiching or front running or whatever, you will have to build your own private mempool. And building the private mempool, you also need to get enough adoption from validators, so to take the transaction from Mempool. So it will be much harder for people to do mev on Solana. So yeah, I think it did serve its purpose. Basically, it's kind of like winding down all the mev activities.
01:13:42.610 - 01:14:02.220, Speaker C: So another tweet here was like someone was talking about during that week when you set a maximum slippage of your trade, it's going to be your expected slippage because there is crazy meb bots activity going on there. So yeah, that's basically the rule of how to casino on.
01:14:04.830 - 01:14:26.340, Speaker A: We can we roll this back for us normal non math people real quick in actual terms. So Jeter was providing me with a service to actually prevent mev, right. They provided a private mempool so I could submit my transactions into that private mempool. And I was not being front run if I was using g two services.
01:14:28.710 - 01:14:50.150, Speaker C: Sorry. I think it's actually like they are providing a whole basic layer of map boosting on Salana. And so where searcher can submit their bundle to the service and then lend their transaction, which is basically allowing the searchers to sandwiching and making mev activities.
01:14:52.250 - 01:15:11.600, Speaker B: You were saying, brian? Sorry. It's the opposite of what boxer was saying, where instead of now you can't sendwitch anymore because this menpol isn't available anymore, and Sonana doesn't have any public menpool in the first place, as far as I know. Right. I think that's the main reason why you don't have any.
01:15:14.690 - 01:15:33.590, Speaker A: So then Jeter shut down because the Solana ecosystem was basically saying, hey, you guys are causing all of our traders to be sandwiched. But why in the aftermath of this is now my why has the situation improved? Or hasn't it improved?
01:15:34.490 - 01:15:38.380, Speaker C: I believe user has been mev less. Yes.
01:15:39.630 - 01:15:47.020, Speaker A: Okay, so what was this one tweet which was like, your max slippage is your expected slippage. What's that about?
01:15:48.430 - 01:15:53.070, Speaker C: That was before they shut down. My timeline might be okay.
01:15:53.220 - 01:16:49.360, Speaker A: Now things make sense. So basically, if we translate this into normal people language, Jito was providing a service for searchers to submit bundles and basically made possible they provide the whole mev pipeline for Solana, or like big parts of the mev pipeline. And now Gtool has basically, they had to step back and be like, oh, shit, what we are doing with the ecosystem in Solana? Because nobody has really built up defenses against Mev yet. So all of our users are getting sandwiched to death, and that's making a better experience. And then behind closed doors, there was some kind of agreement taken with unknown players. We don't really know if the Solana foundation was actually quite, that's quite spicy due to shutting down the mev pipeline for Solana, because nobody has defenses for.
01:16:50.610 - 01:17:27.542, Speaker C: So they are giving up shit ton of revenue. And then by providing a better user experience for Solana overall. And so it's for the longer term, better gameplay play out. But overall, now there is no native Memphis Solana. And so searchers will not be able to really easily submitting transactions with guarantee or basically revert cost. So now it will supposedly actually have much less mev going on or the searching will be harder, basically. So, yeah, I think it's like net positive for the Solana ecosystem.
01:17:27.542 - 01:17:37.040, Speaker C: But definitely Jito is taking a big sacrifice in terms of whatever much money they can make. So, yeah, I think.
01:17:39.090 - 01:18:23.120, Speaker B: You can't sandwich anymore, but we can do all other types of arbitrage, like atomic arbitrage. So where you look at different pools and see whether discrepancies and make money from there. And also statistical arbitrage, where you look through different chains and different maybe on binance and whatever, and look at arbitrage across there. So this is still possible. It's just sandwiches that aren't anymore. And the problem that I was told is like, the code base is such a huge hurdle, it's really hard to get there. It's not an easy to code thing, that it's just a heavy lift for anyone to go ahead out of their way and remake themselves.
01:18:23.120 - 01:18:39.710, Speaker B: And also, you would need to acquire, I think, a significant stake yourself in order for your pool to be used, and therefore to have the ability to have all this change activity.
01:18:41.730 - 01:19:34.180, Speaker C: And then so along with this whole shutting down Jito, there's also new chart crime come up. So people were like, oh, the jeto thing was shutting down and salana trading volume is down by 50%. So I guess these guys is trying to say, oh, all those Salana volume, most of them are just mev activity, and now it's like gone or whatever, but that's not true at all. So we saw murder was calling out this by showing that if you just compare this with Ethereum, it really just is market trained. It was really hyped up in terms of the volume in that past week, but now it's like winding down across all the markets. But then they were just taking the Solana one and making the connection with the jiro thing, but not really when you look at things in scale. So it was quite funny as well.
01:19:34.790 - 01:19:45.254, Speaker A: That is, I think, the worst chart crime we've seen so far. That is like an actual. That is a crime. That's such a misrepresentation of what was happening. Wow.
01:19:45.372 - 01:20:14.740, Speaker C: This one is saying, look at what happens in salana volume when just one of their clients removed a malicious mev down over 50%. Well, there are still plenty of bad mev occurring on chain. So Salana user, you have no clue how much being stolen from them. So it's saying like, oh, the volume are all mev, and basically you're getting wrecked so bad when you're trading on Solana. So it's super bearish, but it's a fraud. This chart is a chart crime. So, yeah, same thing.
01:20:14.740 - 01:21:12.622, Speaker C: It's actually the market going down overall. So, yeah, that's like a recap of what happened in past week on Salana meme coin. And I had, like a trader friend who made a lot in 2021 on trading of meme coin on Ethereum, and he made a comment that it's basically the same cycle of shipcoin going on, but this time the gas is free on Salana. So I'm excited to also see how I've seen also some positive comments about why meme coin actually has its value, as in the past, there is no way for any subcultural to just easily launch as currency and having this magnitude of impact in terms of in the financial side. So I don't know if that's a legit enough or convincing enough comments, but I'm excited to see how the meme coin thing play out in the new cycle.
01:21:12.686 - 01:21:46.494, Speaker B: Yeah, Solana seems to be finding its own user base, which seems very distinct from the ethereum one. There has been some degen activity on Ethereum, but it seems to come in waves. This is probably just a wave. I don't know. We'll see how Solana goes on the long term, but so far it seems more sticky there, the whole degen activity. And if you look at like you were saying earlier, the top trending tokens seem much more djen heavy, at least for the time being. So we'll see if this sticks around.
01:21:46.494 - 01:22:45.214, Speaker B: But maybe it is the meme coin chain as one of its big usage relative to other chains. Maybe that's one of the big things that distinguishes it. It's an interesting development, I think, and whether people like it or not, meme coins are here to stay and people want to trade them. So I don't think it's actually as stupid as people may think in the first place. It's just Internet culture, and that's like the core of it. Even if you look at like I was looking at coin market cap and doge is bigger than avalanche and it's about to overtake Cardano as like number eight, and then Shiba is like number eleven and about to overtake avalanche, which is like, if you look at all cryptos we've ever heard of, two of the biggest ones are number nine and eleven right now, which is there's some substance to it, right? Pippa is probably not too far behind either. I don't know.
01:22:45.214 - 01:22:46.702, Speaker B: I haven't looked closely lately.
01:22:46.766 - 01:23:43.314, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely also see myself having a different behavioral preference in terms of trading on Salana versus trading on Ethereum. Trading on Ethereum for one transaction, it's going to be like at a peak time, still going to be like $20 or $30 sometimes when I was trying to sell my pepe, I think. But on Salana, each transaction will be just a few cents. So I'm like, okay, to split it into ten transactions. Which is another point to prove that novel of transaction is not a great metric because it's so much cheaper. So probably need to consider the basis cost. But also, I think how to say the post effect of this gambling experience is that I put a bunch of those gain into bitcoin, and bitcoin went up from 68 to 72 in a day and my total didn't really change much.
01:23:43.314 - 01:23:44.434, Speaker C: And I was like, this is not.
01:23:44.472 - 01:23:49.030, Speaker A: Good enough, this is too boring. Give me my dopamine.
01:23:51.610 - 01:23:54.840, Speaker C: I needed the three x or four x in 2 hours.
01:23:57.210 - 01:24:18.206, Speaker B: On what you were saying at the beginning. It'd be interesting actually to look into the transaction to active addresses ratio across chains. And I'm guessing it's higher on Solana relative to Ethereum. Those would be interesting metrics to use to adjust other metrics, I guess. Yeah, that could be cool research to do on.
01:24:18.388 - 01:24:59.094, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds interesting. I think on the Solana point, I just want to say that the UX is super clean and I think the Phantom team has done an absolutely fantastic job of building their wallet. I haven't tried any other wallet for Solana, so I don't know how they're squaring up. But the mobile wallet and the in desktop browser wallet, however you call that, they're both amazing. If I wanted to recommend my friends to meme coin trades on anything, I would not send them to base. I would send them to download Phantom on your phone and just trade from phantom on your phone. It's so much easier.
01:24:59.094 - 01:26:13.410, Speaker A: So I'm even a little bit confused why there's even telegram bots for Solana, because the mobile experience or the general experience of trading on Solana is already so clean you don't have the approval patterns and all of this, frankly, bullshit that we have on Ethereum nowadays, which only will be abstracted away with smart account wallets which are supposedly around the corner for like a year now, but they're not really finding the adoption. So it's kind of interesting how the Ethereum ecosystem, the Ethereum ecosystem is behind in UX, but they're trying to catch up now, or not trying to catch up, but a lot of this will be abstracted away once we have proper smart account wallets, because then you don't need to have these approval patterns and all of this stuff anymore, but rather we'll just trade with intents. So yeah, we will see where all of this ends up. But for now, I think all of this meme coin trading on Salana just happened. It's cheap, transactions are virtually free, and the UX is just 100 times nicer. So I'm absolutely not surprised that meme coins have found their home on Salana. We'll see how much of the meme coin capital over time flows to Salana, but absolutely not surprised yeah.
01:26:13.480 - 01:26:28.150, Speaker C: And Phantom probably also is making pretty good revenue. Initially, I was just swapping within the wallet, and until the point I realized there is 85 bips fee on swapping on phantom wallet. But it was quite smooth.
01:26:30.430 - 01:26:56.414, Speaker A: If we're making like a two or three x in 3 hours, you don't fucking care about the 85 bips fee. And I think that's even why metamask can keep their fees so high. People are using the in app or like, in wallet swap functions. They're not like, I've got to invest in bitcoin, and I'm going to look at this in a year. Again, just a year.
01:26:56.452 - 01:26:58.002, Speaker B: Ux. Yeah.
01:26:58.136 - 01:27:05.922, Speaker A: And they're the people who are hunting the five x or the ten x or the 100 x. They're in the casino. They're not the long term value investors.
01:27:05.986 - 01:27:07.202, Speaker B: Not in the trenches.
01:27:07.346 - 01:27:08.040, Speaker C: Yes.
01:27:08.730 - 01:27:48.100, Speaker A: So, yeah, with that, I think we've covered both sides of this market beautifully. The tradfi side, where there's the institutional investors, and we're seeing a lot of inflows from. Yeah, it's actually a good question of whether retail is participating in etfs or it's more like companies or organizations onboarding or buying bitcoin. And I don't think the on chain data really tells us much there. So I guess we'll need to wait for the quarterly report of Blackrock for them to tell us who's actually buying bitcoin. Yeah, that would be interesting, actually. That's a really good point.
01:27:48.100 - 01:28:37.714, Speaker A: So, yeah, we can't really tell what's happening, but I think the words on the street is definitely, it's more institutional money. And then that kind of drives the whole meme coin frenzy, because bitcoin is going up, crypto is getting attention, and then people are trying to participate in this casino. And the casino is currently spinning the fastest on Solana with a lot of meme coins, which have taken very od shapes from Gioboden to Andrew Tate, whatever all of those coins are. So I think you can kind of assess the stage of the cycle very well with the degeneracy of the memes. And I think we're getting into a state of. There's a lot of very weird things. At least it's getting pretty degenerate out there.
01:28:37.714 - 01:29:06.106, Speaker A: I'm hearing a lot of weird stories, but always remember, what goes up must come down. If you look at a lot of those meme coin charts, you can buy them and they can make a ten x in a few hours, but they can also just be worth like a 10th of whatever you've bought them for. I was reminded of that last week a lot. I did some bad trades, but it is what it is. And yeah, I think any final comments for this episode will be interesting to.
01:29:06.128 - 01:29:44.658, Speaker B: See the quality reports of those ETF futurists and see who's using those and also how Solana usage, especially because I think the jeter thing, we can't really look into the data now and see how it is impacted. But in a few weeks, maybe we'll see how things have changed. And also, is there going to be some novel way to sandwich and what is that going to be?
