00:00:01.440 - 00:00:19.830, Speaker A: Hello, hello. Welcome to another episode of the index podcast, where the three of us come together every couple weeks to discuss on chain data chart crimes and metrics that move the crypto industry. Today is Thursday the 4 April, and we are denning on Chain Corgi at flashbots.
00:00:20.022 - 00:00:20.754, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:22.494 - 00:00:25.714, Speaker A: Hildavi, resident data household at Dragonfly.
00:00:26.354 - 00:00:27.414, Speaker C: Hello everyone.
00:00:28.114 - 00:01:02.984, Speaker A: And I am boxer, community powerhorse at Dune. Before we get into it, nothing we say here should be relied upon as legal, financial, investment tax, or even life advice. The views expressed in the podcast are not representative of those of our employers, and we are acting independently of our respective professional roles. And with that last podcast, we talked about blobs, and a lot has happened in the blobs on Ethereum Mainnet. So Hldob is going to give us an update on what is happening there currently.
00:01:04.164 - 00:02:09.024, Speaker C: So let's look into blobs. Yeah, blobs have changed quite a bit. Last time we looked at it, they were still, like at a third of the targets, which is the current target is three blobs per block and limit at six. So whenever we reach three, the EIP 1559 market dynamics start kicking in. And that's when it really gets interesting, and you see who is happy to pay those fees and who was just here for free transaction span. And so here we're looking at my blobs dashboard, and we can see that about a week ago, on March 27, inscriptions started to come around and be quite prominent in terms of blog posting, and even posted over 50%, quite a few days in a row of all blobs being posted. And this actually triggered blobspace to reach its target.
00:02:09.024 - 00:03:08.034, Speaker C: And even for a bit, it extended it. So that's why if we look at blobs target, it's been fairly close to target. And we've seen also the blog base fee basically rise on the same day that inscriptions came around. And interestingly, actually today, well, I mean, a few hours ago, we've seen that inscriptions have started to, I guess, like, slow down in activity, for reasons that I'm not too sure. And this means that the blob fee has returned to its zero dollar original price, I guess. And we've seen also other chains. But I think this has been an interesting thing, is if you look at this top chart, what you can see is every l two is posting blogs based on how much activity it has at this time.
00:03:08.034 - 00:03:56.274, Speaker C: And you'll see, for example, linear has variable amounts of blobs over time, and inscriptions has been taking, like, the remaining amounts of blob space without necessarily, you know, you can't really go further than this. And therefore, that's been the case up until a few hours ago when they started to, well, they stopped posting blobs. And also, interestingly, linea has been increasing in terms of blog posting, which is another topic. So since last time, the new chains that have started to post blobs are mostly linear. And there's another one, but I'll talk about this one later. What happened with Linear is they started to post. And actually they caught my eye being like one of the biggest posters.
00:03:56.274 - 00:05:12.914, Speaker C: If we look in the past 4 hours, they posted 37% of blobs, which extremely high base is behind 24%, and then it brings back down to 11% for arbitrum, ten for optimism, stuff like this. So it's very, very high in terms of amount of blobs. So there must be a lot of activity on there, which I think we can dive into afterwards. And another thing that has been interesting is that I think compared to posting in core data, where you kind of need to know which addresses are posting for each l two, now you can really see who is posting on blobs, because if someone is posting on blobs and you don't know it, there's something going on. And so far it's been either inscriptions or other l two s. And there's been, for example, a new l two that I didn't even know, which is the op stack that has been posting one blob every 2 hours and has just launched, which is called metal. And I wouldn't have been aware of it if it weren't for seeing it pop up on blobs and posting very regularly, which is very l two like and not very inscription kind of style of posting, if that makes sense.
00:05:12.914 - 00:06:19.674, Speaker C: So, yeah, it kind of like is a good proxy to see what new chains are popping up and using blobs, which wasn't really possible in the old cold data system. But in terms of chain activity, I think the more notable ones, of course, like I said, are linear and base, which I think we're going to dive into in this podcast and see why are these popping up, what is going on? But before then, there's a bit more on blobs, and I think it's good to look back into. Okay, now that we have blobs, like, what has it achieved is actually a lot cheaper than it used to be with cold data. And you have this tweet from Rob who looks into it, and compared to what it would have cost to post the same amount of data on cold data. And there's roughly like 80% to 90% reduction, going from like 50 million to 1.9 million of dollars, which is so I'd call that quite a success. And you know, it's reflected in fees on across l two s.
00:06:19.674 - 00:07:08.214, Speaker C: So it's super nice to see that even now that the market that has the blob space market has kicked in for a bit, everything has been going fine and there's not much of a hiccup, so that's always a good sign. And then there's also, we've seen also base. The transaction fee on base has risen like considerably recently due to its activity it's been seeing. And as a response, the base team has been increasing the amount of the gas limits, I think originally from 2.5. And they did it gradually. They wanted to increase it 100%. And that was done by going for 2.5
00:07:08.214 - 00:07:40.144, Speaker C: to 3.75, making sure that everything is running fine and increasing another time to 5 million gas per second. And it has resulted in fees basically now being extremely low back again for base. So, you know, all positive sign. It'll be interesting to see like how, what is the strategy going forward? Is that going to be like their go to to constantly increase the gas limit? The problem is that. Sorry, go ahead.
00:07:40.224 - 00:08:19.172, Speaker A: Isn't that like you're just turning up the volume without like having better hardware or anything like that? That's going to make it harder to decentralize it down the line, right? This is basically the Solana approach where like, ah, like in the future, like if base ever wants to decentralize or like have a decentralized validate. You said you'll have like a bunch of data centers. Because that's, that's what you're doing. If you're increasing the gas limit per block, it's like the nodes will have to process more transactions, so they'll have to have more compute power, more memory in the end, more storage as well. Storage is not really constrained, but yeah, it's still something you should think about.
00:08:19.348 - 00:08:58.812, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think it's like the only best solution and there's probably much better ones, but it's like an easy fix, I guess, for like, for the short term it works and it's not increasing by crazy amounts. Of course, I hope they don't go for that route where they're constantly increasing that gas limit. Otherwise that means if you want to run a sequencer, it's basically you're very limited in terms of you need really good hardware to make sure it's following. And it's always at the head of the chain and stuff like this because you got to process a lot more data. Yeah.
00:08:58.828 - 00:09:39.284, Speaker A: It's also the DVM kind of falls apart after a while. We saw this with BNB where I think new. I don't think anyone can really join the network anymore because it's really hard to get it to sync at all. Or at least this was like, I don't know, word on the street a year or two ago. I don't know what BNB is doing nowadays, but it's basically like, yeah, the EVM is not really designed to have this high of a gas limit and just cranking everything up to 100 and then just sending it is not really a sustainable approach. No educated opinion on what the base guys are doing here. And since they're only running on essentially one validator, it should be fine for now.
00:09:39.284 - 00:09:46.064, Speaker A: But in the future if they want to decentralize, I think, yeah, we'll see how those decisions have panned out.
00:09:46.564 - 00:10:24.494, Speaker C: I'm also curious, like, speaking of BNB, they have op BNB, which is also like a fork of op chains, but like. Like tuned up to eleven. And I'm curious how that's doing just in terms of usage. But also like, is it actually, isn't it having like a ton of rewards or is it like having any trouble running at all? Because, you know, they've tweaked it to quite high levels that I guess wouldn't be recommended in general. But, you know, for the user it's great. For the dev, it's probably not the best experience.
00:10:26.494 - 00:11:06.306, Speaker B: And I feel like when price keep being so high, that's when the narratives of l, three and other da solution comes in. Right. So now you don't want to store those data really on Ethereum or even on the sidechain l two blobs, then you seek some other cheaper solution, maybe. It was really funny. One of the tweet comment was like, people really paying $600 to store 256 kb for 18 days right now. That's like the peak of the blob fee, I guess. And I guess, like, we hope the economics will regulate the usage of the blob.
00:11:06.306 - 00:11:09.174, Speaker B: But yeah, as you guys said, there's a cap there.
00:11:10.714 - 00:11:24.174, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like, interesting to monitor how this goes and hopefully they do it reasonably, but yeah, I don't know.
00:11:25.274 - 00:12:02.470, Speaker B: Yeah. Also, like, I think this whole blob inscription, Jose inscription coming to Ethereum, just ridiculous to me. It's like Ethereum has a functionality of like having token and then the contracts for sale and all that. Like, inscryption started with a chain without EVM features and now you're basically like, you're able to do that, but you want to do it in an inscription way and trying to like, make a ledger of like, how much token you might have bought and like, you hold, etcetera. It's like I'm a, like, vision. Like how to say a person with full vision, but I'm like covering my eyes and walk on the streets with a white can. Like, I just, I just like to do that.
00:12:02.470 - 00:12:14.754, Speaker B: Like for what? Gord had a funny too. He was saying ethereum is world war three resistant, but not blob description resistant. That's like a funny comment.
00:12:17.324 - 00:12:35.580, Speaker C: I think. Like the inscriptions kind of had three phase where they're like, oh, there's a new place to post inscriptions. We might as well do inscriptions because I guess that's what inscriptors do. So. Sure. Then they did it and then they realized, oh, fuck, we're posting a little too much. Surprise.
00:12:35.580 - 00:12:58.954, Speaker C: To post them is like a little high and it's actually higher than posting them just in cold data. So they started to slow down, regulate themselves. And now as of 24 hours ago, they stopped posting. Well, I mean, they decreased posting to a point where we're no longer at target. So I guess maybe it was just a fad that died down. We'll see.
00:13:00.094 - 00:13:20.534, Speaker A: It's kind of like blockchain graffiti. Yeah, there's just a bunch of kids running around the different blockchains, just tagging up, taking up the blog space, and they seem to have left town. We're in luck. Maybe there's the festival now three towns over. I don't know. It is really strange.
00:13:21.634 - 00:13:58.464, Speaker C: Yeah, no l two is going to stop posting blobs because they actually genuinely need it. So they essentially decide what the price of blobs are. As long as we haven't reached Max of else who is posting on blobs. But that's probably not for now. And I don't even think once every l two is posting blobs, we probably still are not our targets. I think we're missing blast mental stuff like this, which has high activity. So those would be, I assume, posting significant amount of blobs.
00:13:59.004 - 00:14:19.436, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to ask about that. So you have identified all the blob posters, which are like, outside of blobscriptions. I mean, there must be many accounts that are posting those. But all the chains that you showed earlier on your dashboards or that people can look at on your dashboards. Those are the chains which are currently posting. So Metis is missing, for example. I think that's a big one.
00:14:19.436 - 00:14:30.618, Speaker A: Or like Boba network. I don't know if they're around still, but what do you think? Is it just their devs haven't really spent enough development or they just haven't shipped this yet? So that's why.
00:14:30.666 - 00:15:08.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they'll ship it eventually because it just makes sense. It's just lower cost and revenue is a big thing. So you might as well. You might as well increase your revenue there using it. But I think Michael did some calculation before blobs were a thing where even if all else is worth, post would still be at one third of blobs space. The thing is, since then, l two usage has increased quite substantially, especially on linear and base. So now they're taking up quite a bit of blob space, which wasn't the case.
00:15:08.774 - 00:15:27.244, Speaker C: But the thing is, we had space for quite a bit of margin and probably more chains. Now we've got l three s popping up. Maybe we'll have some of those posting into blobs. So the meta is launch your own l two or l three, I guess.
00:15:31.904 - 00:15:51.500, Speaker A: Yep. And with that, I think that covers blobs very well. So in general, we've seen quite the uptick in l two activity. We already kind of brushed over the topic briefly here. So maybe I hear, Toby, you've kind of explored linear for a bit.
00:15:51.692 - 00:16:26.302, Speaker C: I honestly wasn't clued into it too much. I think all I did was mint an nft a few weeks ago on linear, but haven't used it all that much otherwise. And I was looking to grow the pie and where the NFT activity is, mostly because I wanted to look into how base is doing. And then I realized, like, what the hell? Like, Linea is having twice as many transactions lately, which is absurdly high relative to all l two s. So it saw like 4.8 million transactions in a single day. Like a few on the 31 march a few days ago.
00:16:26.302 - 00:17:12.374, Speaker C: And I was wondering. So I just posted on Twitter, like, hey, does anyone know where this is coming from? And there was basically just one answer, which is that they currently have. So layer three, which if I share here, has a thing where you can. You have like quests, essentially, and people are farming those quests to death, and there's quite a few quests. So I tried running through it. For some reason I'm not logged in here as you can't see it, but like I did maybe a third of them, and even just a third has like, I'd say a substantial amount of transactions, maybe like 30 or something. So there's maybe a hundred, at least a hundred transactions just to complete the whole.
00:17:12.374 - 00:18:00.014, Speaker C: So if you want to farm this thing, which is currently what people are doing, everyone is posting a lot of transactions, thus driving the activity way up. I also think that as we are recording this, layer three's quest program should end in transition to new ones. So maybe it's worth looking back in a bit and see what is going on. Has activity died down or has it been sustained? In which case that's awesome. But I haven't seen much signs of sustainable activity other than NFT mints for weird nfts I've never heard of and other protocols that are starting to build something, but they don't look as full fledged as you can see on other chains yet. For now.
00:18:02.634 - 00:18:28.456, Speaker A: Yeah. I also played around with this yesterday. You're really doing a lot of transactions. And this is an interesting kind of concept, the experience of like, hey, this is what you can do on the chain. But there was some very questionable things in there and UX wasn't always perfect. The linear UX actually worked really well. So I didn't have any RPC issues or stuff like that.
00:18:28.456 - 00:18:36.242, Speaker A: It's just like, whoever developed those apps which are behind those links. Yeah, some of them were a bit cumbersome.
00:18:36.418 - 00:18:37.402, Speaker C: Yeah. But.
00:18:37.418 - 00:18:44.134, Speaker A: Oh, well, I think. So much for Linia or. Anyone have more comments on Linia?
00:18:45.514 - 00:19:11.890, Speaker B: I got the frogs, though. I got the Og nft for the chain. And so, yeah, I mean, overall, it's probably a lot of the, you know, this kind of early incentive farming, minting events going on. Yeah, but I mean, it's from consensus. So I'm kind of, I'm kind of bullish. They will have, you know, a team, you know, building out the ecosystem. You know, it may be slow, but let's see.
00:19:11.890 - 00:19:12.614, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:14.354 - 00:20:00.574, Speaker A: And speaking, I'm interested in what the, like, this is basically going to be the metamask chain. So I'm interested in how consensus uses metamask and linear together, which is like, it's kind of like Coinbase has all the users because they're the exchange, and meta consensus has all the users because they are still the largest wallet, I would think. I mean, wallet numbers are hard to come by, but I would think if we look at Metamask swap volume, it's probably still like way up there. So they have the user access or the point of sale. Kind of like if you take this into web two, or like customer relationship, if you take this into the web two terminology. So linear. Really should.
00:20:00.574 - 00:20:39.114, Speaker A: I don't know, it's their advantage to lose really. Everyone else is kind of like they're building things starting at from zero. But Lyndia already has, theoretically with metamask in the back, they already have all those customer relations at the distribution. So yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what kind of builders and applications they can actually attract to that chain. But with that said, actually perfect segment to the coinbase chain, which is base daning, I think you've looked into what's happening there currently, so maybe just walk us through that.
00:20:39.774 - 00:21:12.354, Speaker B: Yeah, so this chart I'm showing here is the base fee of most of the L2. And the most obvious one here you see is a blue one that's base. And it's like spiking up to crazy level. That's like, you know, other chains are nowhere near. It's around the peak was the first peak was the smaller one around like one GUI for base fee and maybe around two for the second one. And then overall, the whole gas fee, including base fee and priority fee was also just like the same trend. Like there was a crazy spike.
00:21:12.354 - 00:21:58.354, Speaker B: It's still really high compared to others, but it looks like it's kind of like cooling down a little bit. And so you wonder so why l two Gatsby went up so high. And like I got this query from actually you, Boxer, where if we look at this breakdown of all the function call that's happening on base, the bigger segment of the bar is showing trading or execute, which is likely also I guess a trading kind of, of function. And then you also see approve as like the number 304 function call there number three, which is also for swap tokens. And then there's mint cube. So I guess this is, this is some sort of projects, maybe cube related.
00:21:58.434 - 00:22:07.694, Speaker A: And it's like minting Cube is actually, that's layer three. So there seems to be some kind of layer three thing going on on base as well.
00:22:08.354 - 00:23:06.088, Speaker B: I see, yeah, and it seems like it stopped a few days ago. But then, yeah, you see friend Tech is also another one and Ming team is another generic big one. So yeah, I think like it's mostly, I would say like trading activity of actually the meme coin wave recently going to base one data that showed this clearly, I thought it was really insightful. Is this one called deep bridge, which is a bridge that I use mostly when I do Solana stuff. And they have an analytics page where you can see their accounting among all their own traffic. What are the movement of the money across different chain? And if you look at the Solana one, which is the second biggest in terms of the out traffic next to ethereum, Solana money mostly going to Ethereum. And then the second one is base, and then next would be arbitran.
00:23:06.088 - 00:23:31.570, Speaker B: And so you pretty much can see I've hearing people saying this as well, like the meme coins going to base. There's the sea launch June dashboard where you can see the base. Dex volume is going up crazy as well. Just like up to the right kind of chart. Went up to like 1.2 billion per day at peak and end of March. I think this number is almost like half of Ethereum, because I remember ethereum.
00:23:31.570 - 00:24:07.754, Speaker B: Dex volume is around like 2 billion per day. Yeah. And then if you look at the breakdown, 80, 90% are uniswap. And it's like increasingly higher and higher during this, like frenzy time because like most of the meme coin are just like launching on uniswap, easily creating a pool, deploying their token there for liquidity. Yeah. Another one that I was like looking at is Dolby's dashboard about atomic arbitrage. So pretty much, I think as far as I know, there isn't really any l two mev data.
00:24:07.754 - 00:24:27.800, Speaker B: Dolby's data is actually the exclusive for sidechain mev activity. Yeah. And it's showing this name. Yeah. It's doing the same thing here. You see that Dex trading model overall has going up crazy. And also if you break it down to how many of them are like atomic arbitrage.
00:24:27.800 - 00:24:54.652, Speaker B: And you see this number is going up, the number of bots also going up. Yeah. So I think we can pretty much draw a conclusion that like most of them are dextrading activity, trading odds activity and media activity. Although to caveat though, is like, when you're on this kind of l two, there's only one. Like, I don't. I think beys also only have one sequencer. I'm not sure.
00:24:54.652 - 00:26:00.482, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. And then there's, there is no native mempool. There isn't a way for a searcher to really like say, I can see clearly what are the user transaction and then do a sandwiching between it because I need to know exact how much token going to come out from the user and how much price it going to move to really have a sandwiching kind of strategy, what the searcher can do with no information, would it be blank back running or like back running, say end of last blocks price to be at the top of next block and say like I'm going to do the up trash between the pool where I see the price already, not even, or basically saying I'm going to do a token mint sniping. I'm just like blindly sending this transaction assuming it's going to launch the next block and keep doing it. So that's easily like spamming the chain and increasing the gas. And then you can also increase the rate, revert rate of your transactions, but you don't care if it's like really cheap, right? So I looked at like multi chain revert rate across transactions base.
00:26:00.482 - 00:26:26.374, Speaker B: At a certain time point it was like 23% of revert rate. It spiked down now around maybe six 7%, which is still really high. Like Ethereum is around 1% overall. This similar thing for optimism, it's like eight 9% of revert rate. It's pretty crazy. But again, to caveat, it's mostly probably bots rather than retail user suffering reverts.
00:26:26.674 - 00:27:43.450, Speaker C: I think that was when optimism. So I was looking into sandwich data and when optimism added EIP 1559, which was a bit later than Ethereum, you saw a lot of sandwich activity basically dying down to zero level zero. And my guess is that people were spamming like crazy beforehand and hoping to. They're like, oh, what are currently the things being currently traded most? And based on this guess, like have a transaction with high amount of gas and one with low and try to sandwich by just doing my guesswork, which was when it was extremely cheap to do so it was an arb that worked. But now with EIP 1459 and more activity on the l two, it's just not as good of a, you know, like it's not as profitable of a strategy. So it basically isn't happening much anymore. And with single sequences, of course, it's not really, you know, no mempool means it's really, really hard to see what is going on, is there? I don't think there's with the mempool at this point, but it would be really cool to see like in all the market, the only two.
00:27:43.450 - 00:27:53.106, Speaker C: The only two with like high central activity are going to be like, if German BNB, there's some other l one s. But in terms of l two s, they're not that much for now.
00:27:53.290 - 00:27:55.174, Speaker A: Wait, you said mempool on BNB?
00:27:56.314 - 00:28:15.622, Speaker C: It's a good question. I know there's a lot of. There's some sandwich activity. I'm not sure if there's a mempool. I'm not sure, because there's, like. There's, like, a. Last I checked, it's, like, only a select few amount of people who are running BNB.
00:28:15.622 - 00:28:20.150, Speaker C: So it's not just one sequencer? It's a few, but it's a limited amount.
00:28:20.182 - 00:28:23.542, Speaker A: Yeah. It's CZ in 19 different costumes.
00:28:23.678 - 00:28:24.394, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:24.814 - 00:28:26.554, Speaker A: I mean, that's a rumor.
00:28:28.574 - 00:28:34.074, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So it's a good question. Actually, I have no idea.
00:28:35.244 - 00:28:37.644, Speaker B: I just googled it. Looks like. Yes.
00:28:37.684 - 00:28:38.384, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:28:38.724 - 00:28:44.984, Speaker B: Yeah. Seems like there's a mempool data service for finance.
00:28:45.964 - 00:28:48.500, Speaker C: Okay, so there has to be something, I guess.
00:28:48.692 - 00:29:12.044, Speaker A: Yes. I guess as soon as the. Like, as soon as there's even two validators, they have to. Because you can't just submit them somewhere. You have to submit them into some reservoir where then the validator picks what they actually include. Okay, interesting. So all of this to say, is there mev on base or is there not mev on base? I'm still left in the dark.
00:29:13.264 - 00:29:46.326, Speaker B: I think the conclusion is that sandwiching or any strategy that needs a lot of certain information would be hard. But there is definitely a maybe token based sniping and also arbitraging, as Dolby's dashboard shows. So, yeah. Guess who is making money again? Trading bots. So, like, banana guns? Dashboards here is showing, actually, if you can. So they seems like they're on base now. You can see basically, it launched, like, maybe just a few weeks ago.
00:29:46.326 - 00:30:19.334, Speaker B: It was, like, very little volume for the first few days, but quickly it surpassed Solana. Now, for some days, like, for example, this day, it was, like, 18 million on base volume for banana gang trading bots and 9 million on Solana. You kind of could also see the shift of, like, Solana dying down a little bit. Base goes higher, and then, like, yeah, they're printing pretty much, like, 500,000. So half million a day with three chains combined. And it's simple. It's just 1% transaction fee.
00:30:20.874 - 00:30:21.570, Speaker C: Okay.
00:30:21.682 - 00:30:28.254, Speaker A: And do they redistribute this to, like, banana stickers or something? How does that work? They have a token. Right?
00:30:28.594 - 00:30:29.814, Speaker B: Banana gun.
00:30:30.674 - 00:30:31.894, Speaker A: They don't have a token.
00:30:33.154 - 00:30:34.334, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:34.954 - 00:30:35.814, Speaker C: They've got.
00:30:37.474 - 00:30:38.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:38.170 - 00:30:43.734, Speaker A: So there must be some kind of, like, revenue share going on or something, I would assume.
00:30:44.274 - 00:30:45.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:45.514 - 00:30:56.264, Speaker A: Is it not on this dashboard? Wait, Hunter is usually good at figuring these things out. Oh, there it is. Annualized pen. So they are paying out to their. To their stakers.
00:30:57.684 - 00:30:59.664, Speaker C: Apy is, like, 150.
00:31:01.484 - 00:31:01.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:02.052 - 00:31:12.624, Speaker B: Okay, I see. We can basically participate by staking banana to take share of their revenue then.
00:31:13.124 - 00:31:13.500, Speaker A: Wow.
00:31:13.532 - 00:31:13.884, Speaker B: Got it.
00:31:13.924 - 00:31:36.834, Speaker A: A 1.16 P e ratio. Do you know how crazy that is for tech? I mean, it's technically a tech startup. Okay, I guess thea research is gonna assume by, like, they're already in this segment. So I don't know, but this. Very interesting. All right, so all of that.
00:31:36.834 - 00:31:45.334, Speaker A: So general base activity, in your words then, are you saying it's kind of driven, like there's real users?
00:31:45.854 - 00:32:14.204, Speaker B: Yeah, I think overall there are users who are mostly degen, who are basically like, going there to trade meme coins and that drive massively. All those, like, trading bots. Volume, actually. And with the user transactions coming in, there is also maybe bots transactions come in basically, like doing arbitraging across the pool because there is price movement. So, yeah, I think, yeah, it's organic, but it's like financial nihilism kind of activity. You know, it's like.
00:32:15.944 - 00:32:43.874, Speaker A: You just wanted to say that word. So, so basically it's kind of what you're saying is there's real users coming in, partly driven by, by probably deejun, like the forecaster connection and everything, and they're just doing meme coin trading. And then that meme coin trading activity in turn pulls in a bunch of bots. So the transact, like, the transactions per day is kind of like the more they are, the more like there's demand for them. Kind of. It's almost like it's like a self.
00:32:47.014 - 00:32:48.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, it's a whole.
00:32:48.398 - 00:32:50.678, Speaker C: It'S a whole self fulfilling prophecy.
00:32:50.806 - 00:33:03.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Self reinforcing effect where like, if you have more transactions, then there's more arbitrages to be had if there's no arbitrage to be had. Like, if there's more activities, probably pulls in more users. Okay, very interesting.
00:33:04.914 - 00:33:30.334, Speaker B: Any, anything more to say? DJ in a generic dj way. But now that you mentioned Djin token, it was actually the token that was like going up the most. It's pretty crazy. I met up some sf guy. One of the guy, I think he has like 500 million. Like, this person, Joe, he's also like pretty big on forecaster. And he was just like posting very actively and everything.
00:33:30.334 - 00:33:52.194, Speaker B: I think what he told me was like, you know, initially he was like trying to speculate the, whatever token from warpcast. What was it? Warp. But then, you know, the forecaster team is like, very anti speculative. So, like, that token is like, no, no curve at all. Like it's gonna be whatever the price is. And he was like, okay, now there's this new Djinn thing. I'm gonna try that.
00:33:52.194 - 00:34:30.206, Speaker B: And the first airdrop was to incentivize any activity or engagement of your cast. And so he was like, I'm giving out these warps to all the people react or like, like. Or reply to this thread. And so he farmed a shit ton of, like, engagement with that, and he got like, shit ton of airdrop. And, well, guess what? Like, there was VC also invested in Degen. One confirmation, they bought like, a million dollar value of Degen in February, and now it's 100 x, like $100 million in terms of the price. And so I guess, you know, the farming is bringing Joe to a half billion.
00:34:30.206 - 00:34:48.534, Speaker B: I mean, he said if Dejan is gonna be $1, he will be having half billion. So, yeah, it's kind of crazy. And also, like, imagine the performance of one confirmation, right? How, like, what's the usual rOI for VC domain?
00:34:48.574 - 00:35:20.728, Speaker A: I mean, it's one of their, like, it's one of the VC bets actually working out, right? Like, their whole game is like, we are going to make a million investments and one of them is going to hit. And this one certainly has it. I actually met Richard three days after this was publicly announced. And I kind of in a poking manner, kind of like, what is this about? Because I frankly didn't understand. I think the lesson is always, just follow Richard. Whatever Richard is doing, you should definitely pay attention to. And if they like investing a million, just.
00:35:20.728 - 00:35:25.204, Speaker A: Just put a thousand in there. It's probably a good idea, but obviously not financial advice.
00:35:26.064 - 00:35:32.392, Speaker C: The only thing is that, like, for, like, VC, I'm guessing it's the token is vested is unvested for now.
00:35:32.488 - 00:35:42.204, Speaker A: I think they just bought it. Yeah, they just bought it on the open market. It's just an on chain transaction with the literal one confirmation ETH, like, address.
00:35:42.744 - 00:35:46.368, Speaker C: Oh, wow, then, okay, then. That's really impressive because I don't know if they.
00:35:46.456 - 00:35:54.884, Speaker A: I don't know if they did any, like, contract of they're gonna lock up or anything, because I think, like, it might have been like an OTC transaction, but it was just on chain.
00:35:55.044 - 00:35:56.064, Speaker C: Yeah, I think.
00:35:58.044 - 00:36:21.078, Speaker B: There is a vesting schedule based on what I see, like, from this post from Nansen. So they purchased it in February. Vesting starting at, I guess, instant. Right? It was like February this year. And there is a vesting cliff. So, meaning, like, it's vesting, but you're not getting it until you can't sell it. Until this.
00:36:21.126 - 00:36:23.318, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a six month cliff.
00:36:23.486 - 00:36:28.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Six months. Yeah. And so total of two years. Vesting ends in two years.
00:36:29.734 - 00:37:02.544, Speaker C: So what I mean is like, as. I mean, I think Degen is cool and I hope it sticks around. But it's still short term to say like if it's a definite win for. It's looking good though, for one confirmation. Haseeb recently tweeted, like, like, you guys who, like all VC's who invest in meme coins, like, what are you guys telling your lp's like because you got reports to your LP where you're invested in. And I didn't really get any conclusive answers in the replies. I didn't see much.
00:37:02.544 - 00:37:23.240, Speaker C: And I don't think there's much you can justify because the problem is, like, for like venture, meme coins are very short term. In like 99.9% of cases. Degen seems to be like an outlier more than anything. There's probably like, there's very, very few who. Which are like still traded on the long term.
00:37:23.352 - 00:37:41.402, Speaker B: So because they're. Because they have a roadmap, you know, they're actually building things. And I think it's quite bullish that. I mean, my first impression was the same. I didn't even try to engage about Djen when I saw it, like earlier, early on in Farcaster thought it's. Oh, it's another like airdrop or that like farming thing. I don't have time for that.
00:37:41.402 - 00:38:08.434, Speaker B: But then turns out, I mean, it's actually. It has a utility where you can tip people on firecaster with Degen. And they have this partnership with Strokula, which is the crypto TikTok, I guess. And they also use Degen as a tip token as well, I guess. And now they. They are also launching l three. So layer three last week launched, which I think is using Bose.
00:38:08.434 - 00:38:26.874, Speaker B: They were using arbitran orbit and base for sediment and any trust for DA. So I mean, they're building a chain. And so now DJ token is becoming a native gas token there. So it seems like it's going legit. I don't know.
00:38:27.854 - 00:39:00.986, Speaker A: Utility is a bit like. I don't know. That's a big word to use. I think basically what has happened is focus has become the unofficial or the unofficial official token of Wopcast or Farkhast in general. And it's kind of like the community token of that ecosystem where I think it's the critical mass of that social network and that social graph is putting their power behind Deejun. And Deejun just is the vessel for making this happen, for sure. The founder of Degen has actually built something useful.
00:39:00.986 - 00:39:33.486, Speaker A: It's really cool that they're doing all of these integrations and the user experience is nice. I bridged to Degen yesterday and I had some problems connecting my ola connect, but in the end it worked. They're actually building the infrastructure. But I think it's much more about the social network. It's not about the utility itself that much, but rather it's kind of like they're casting a vibe into reality and like I. It's kind of a meme token in that sense. But like I would almost more say it's like a community token where like this community of people of like it's kind of in the east.
00:39:33.486 - 00:39:53.094, Speaker A: Like, I don't want to say maxi in the like ETH og like camp. That token, it's like the community slash meme token of that like whole guard. So I don't know, it's, it's, it's very interesting. I wouldn't, I wouldn't call it like a classic meme token. I think it's a bit like, I think it like fit the bill.
00:39:53.554 - 00:40:28.100, Speaker C: It did the transition from meme coin to actual. More than that. Than just that, really well, but it like, it's also, you know why when you look at the DBridge volume, people are coming from Solana because they're meme coin traders. That's what a lot of Solana activity is currently. And that moving on to base because it became the meme coin l two for now and with Degen being like at the lead of it. But there's other meme coins. I'm not as glued into all of them, but there's quite a few popping up.
00:40:28.100 - 00:41:09.444, Speaker C: And if you look on like, I forgot Dex screener, you can see that like on the top few, it's like it's 80% Solana and maybe 20% is going to be base tokens. So I guess that's a good proxy for the activity is at currently in terms of meme coins at least meme coins, otherwise they're either short term or you do something with it. And that's what Zizek did with Degen, which is interesting. It's probably the first l three that I know of at least that has hit somewhat mainstream. And that's an interesting new development.
00:41:09.974 - 00:41:12.114, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe we can quickly.
00:41:13.574 - 00:41:14.006, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:14.070 - 00:42:07.554, Speaker A: What is an l three? So, yeah, I actually prepared something on this. So l three is just another layer on top of an l two. So you can kind of imagine base is an l two built on top of ethereum mainnet. And then now Jadzek or the Degen team has built an l three using like a roll up as a service provider. So first of all, they've built an l three. So that l three settles on base and uses arbitrum, any trust, as data availability solution. So the transactions are kind of like they're settled on base, but then the data availability layer is something like they haven't used celestial or near or like they could even like, I guess, post this into like blocks or something.
00:42:07.554 - 00:43:07.904, Speaker A: But instead they have actually chosen this arbitram thing. So very interesting there. And yeah, I think the rationale behind this is basically, okay, we are paying too much transaction fees even though basis transaction fees have really reduced. Now with an l three, it's basically free. But I think, again, you're sacrificing one more layer of neutrality, kind of where it's like, this is just a centralized database at this point. Of course there's DA and we're settling the transactions and everything, but it's not really like, can you really say that this is secured by ethereum? I mean, both, the funny thing here is both base and any trust post their data onto ethereum, but there's like a layer of abstraction between that. So it's like, it's, yeah, it's, it's a bit fishy.
00:43:07.904 - 00:43:49.696, Speaker A: Like philosophically, like, I don't really have a problem with this. Like, it's like, am I gonna store like a million dollars on base? Like does, or like on the Degen chain? Does it have to be censorship resistant? It's like kind of, kind of also, I don't know. And I even think, like those properties, you could, you could still, still kind of a scrap to that. But at the same, yeah, I think there's some trade offs that must have been made. So, yeah, that's kind of what I can say on that. And, yeah, then maybe on the kind of ground scheme here. So we have also, so Deejun is the first one that is actually successful and syndicate.
00:43:49.696 - 00:44:33.044, Speaker A: So syndicate is the roll up as a service provider. They've actually tweeted yesterday that they have 770,000 active addresses on there, 25,000 deployed contracts, $60 million bridged. And that $60 million bridge is mostly in the native, or like, it's only in the native token DJ. But now there's kind of like a, there is a, there's a Dex that has, or like multiple dexes that have popped up there. Of course, it's called Djinn swap or like whatever. So every chain needs to have its theme, and the theme on Degen is everything is purple. So if you scroll to the next screen, just every shit coin on there is purple.
00:44:33.044 - 00:44:53.478, Speaker A: But yeah, very impressive. And this is pretty much the first l three that we've seen that has actually hit any notion of traction. There has been the attempt of bnB, I think we talked about it earlier, Opbnb. So optimism. Is that even an l three?
00:44:53.566 - 00:44:54.822, Speaker C: It's not an l three.
00:44:54.998 - 00:45:24.864, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an l two on top of B and D. Right. So yeah, I actually don't know of any, like maybe there's some game l three s that we don't really know about. But this is like the first l three that I see, like actually having success. And it is because they already have a community. So like, they're not kind of building their l three first and then they hope to like find the community, but rather it's the other way around where it's like they have an established use case they haven't, and now they're just spinning up the app chain, I think. Yeah, I guess, like you could.
00:45:24.864 - 00:45:41.732, Speaker A: I guess you could also sort it into the app chain category. And like, of those, we've seen quite a few. It's like Evo or Dydx or. Is there anywhere. I think those are the two that I. That I know there's a few, but.
00:45:41.748 - 00:45:53.494, Speaker C: Like, it's those, like DJNC is more agnostic to one specific. Like it's more general purpose meme coins, I guess, or I don't know what.
00:45:53.534 - 00:45:56.894, Speaker A: Yeah, the other ones are basically like they're, they're being administrated by.
00:45:57.014 - 00:45:57.754, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:59.534 - 00:46:23.446, Speaker A: Like only, like the Evo people or only the DyDX people have admin access to that chain. If you could, like, you can't really say it like that, but I think that that's going to make sense to most of our listeners if you look at it from software development or even database management perspective or something like that. Can you deploy contracts on Evo? Can I deploy contracts on Evo? Probably not.
00:46:23.590 - 00:46:24.670, Speaker C: I don't think so.
00:46:24.822 - 00:46:34.194, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's what I mean with. Yeah, we'll check after podcast and tell you guys in the show notes. What were you saying?
00:46:34.614 - 00:46:51.624, Speaker C: No, I think, like Danning said Zora in the chat, I think Zora is, it's like vertical specific. So it's going to be mostly on nfts, but it's still permissionless and I think uniswap recently deployed on Zora, although it's not really an ERC 20 chain, but.
00:46:53.564 - 00:47:28.080, Speaker A: It'S a general purpose EVM. People have kind of seen, like, the EVM madness and they've recognized, like, hey, we can do the same, the Djinn EVM madness where like, anyone is just deploying, like, Dex or like, ERc 20 token and people are just doing the same thing on Zora because again, the distribution has already happened. So it's like there's users on these chains who you can conventionally, like, who you can maybe convert to use your, I don't know, zora swap, like, by your buy your meme coin. So I think that's what basically happening here.
00:47:28.152 - 00:48:02.670, Speaker C: I think the reason uniswap deployed is also was driven by. So you know how you can tip Degen on Farcaster? There's a similar token now on Zora where, you know, in the Zora ux, you can comment on mints. And I forgot the name of the token, but you can do the exact same tip in the comments of Zora Mint. Okay, I forgot the name. It's like a blue orb and whatever, but it's. They have their own token and they essentially. I don't think it was done by the Zora team.
00:48:02.670 - 00:48:14.398, Speaker C: I think it's also just a dj, like, done externally by someone else. But it's seeing the same interesting development as Djen did on base in Farcaster, I guess.
00:48:14.566 - 00:48:52.634, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. So maybe to quickly finish this l three thing. So there's now. So syndicate has actually is kind of managing the Degen chain for the Degen team. And syndicate is a roll up as a service provider. And Denver, the conference in Denver, Ethan, was full of rollup as a service provider. So this is definitely going to be a trend in this cycle where as soon as something gets big enough, if Rentech were to launch now and have the same success, they would probably immediately launch an app change as well.
00:48:52.634 - 00:49:30.634, Speaker A: Or like, maybe. Yeah, maybe if they had their own token already. I don't know. But yeah. Raw service providers is definitely going to be a theme in this cycle, much to the dismay of data analysts, because every time there's a new chain, all the data providers need to first index that chain, and then only then we can look into it. So we can't really be of useful service here with, like, providing deep insights into Degen because the chain is not on flip side, the chain is not on dune, the chain's not on allium. We can't do anything yet.
00:49:30.634 - 00:49:38.714, Speaker A: But, yeah, we'll probably. I don't know. There's probably going to be solutions for this problem going forward, hopefully.
00:49:39.574 - 00:50:08.114, Speaker C: And just to get back up. So the token is called enjoy. If anyone was wondering. I don't think it's seeing as remotely as much activity as like, DGen, but it is interesting. And I haven't looked into activity actually, but it is the dominant way. Just like Degen was on. I mean, is on Flakester for Zora comments, which I learned was a thing because of this.
00:50:08.454 - 00:50:31.056, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so we've really gone down a rabbit hole here of meme coins and bass and Degion filecaster. So to go back up to the. The base level of why is there so much activity on base? I think there's also some institutions, and I think Coinbase is now starting to store the USDC. So, dobby, if you can tell us more about that, that would be great.
00:50:31.240 - 00:51:00.234, Speaker C: So I was looking into TVL a while back, and l two beat has this interesting breakdown where if you look here, this is TVL, but you can see native assets and canonically bridged assets. So canonically bridge is going to be, you know, stuff that's bridged for on the chain. That's usual stuff. And there's native minted, and those are going to be. So I'm going to. Maybe it's. It's there somewhere.
00:51:00.234 - 00:51:22.624, Speaker C: Vue TVL breakdown. That's the one. And here you can see that the dominant one are so degen TYBG, which is another meme coin arrow, which is a Dex on base. And then you got USDC. And there's a significant amount of USDC. So 1.3 billion on base right now.
00:51:22.624 - 00:52:04.506, Speaker C: So it got me curious. I think I tweeted about it. I didn't get much answered. And we were like, with. I think with Michael, I was trying to see where is this coming from and why is this there? And just a bit later, we had an announcement from Coinbase that they're starting to move their corporate and customer USDC balance on base because it means it's easier to manage and settle faster, which is an interesting development. And we'll see if that keeps going. At the time of the announcement, it was at 600 million.
00:52:04.506 - 00:52:28.246, Speaker C: That was mostly 400 million came in two weeks. And since then, that was like two weeks ago. That's like double the amount on base now. So 1.3 billion, which is a substantial amount. And especially, like, if you look at the TVL in terms of percentage, 1.3 is like more than a third of the entire TVL.
00:52:28.246 - 00:53:19.924, Speaker C: So it's quite high of an amount. I don't know if it's all just based all just like Coinbase moving their assets or there's also retail. I'm guessing it's a bit of both, with the majority coming from Coinbase, but yeah, worth taking a look and monitoring in the future and seeing if that keeps rising. But yeah, it's kind of cool to see them move their assets on chain, and I don't know if they're selling them on Ethereum or keeping them all in one wallet and like, keeping the ledger off chain entirely. I don't know to what degree they were moving stuff on chain, but if that means we get more of the things more granular, I guess, movements on chain, that's kind of a cool development.
00:53:23.224 - 00:53:34.124, Speaker A: It's kind of interesting how USDT is the biggest stablecoin, but everything that I touch, or like, all the chains that I'm interested in are USDC stablecoin chains.
00:53:35.124 - 00:54:16.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I think USDT is mostly very prominent on Tron, and I don't think there's USDC on Tron. And Tron is used by exchanges to settle the transaction and move them from one another. That's my understanding. I'm currently actually diving deep into stablecoins, so hopefully I'll have some dashboard on that soon. But the reason I'm doing it now is because Dune just listed Tron as a chain, which I don't know much about and I'm trying to understand, and it's also extremely necessary for the full picture of stablecoins.
00:54:16.632 - 00:54:17.432, Speaker A: Yep.
00:54:17.608 - 00:54:53.644, Speaker B: One thing recently I noticed was like, if you check the Dex trading volume on Ethereum, USDT to wath pair is higher than USDC. At least that day when I was looking at. Because like, you know, people always, you know, doing research using the USDC and wetpayer as the sample because it's the biggest by TVL or trading volume in the past. But I think right now USDT is kind of like doing this, taking over in terms of volume. I would be curious to see if that's a stable train from your stable coin. Stable train from the stablecoin dashboard.
00:54:54.504 - 00:55:24.084, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see how far along I managed. Like, I have some. I often have, like, plans for dashboards that I don't fulfill because there's just too much going on and it's just too high of a maintenance going forward. But I'm guessing this one should mostly be about labeling addresses in like, future proofing. And I just want to make sure also it supports, like, Solana and Tron. So yeah, if hopefully I have it at some point and I can share it with you guys.
00:55:24.424 - 00:55:50.948, Speaker B: Yeah. And one thing I recently just learned, which is, like, so obvious, is like, do you know what's the business model for the stable coins? Like, how do they make money? They. They literally just put their money in bank, takes interest from bank when right now the interest is 5% plus in us. And like, I was like, oh, shit. Yeah, it's. It's such an easy business. You know, like, just don't do all those algorithmic and stuff and just put money there.
00:55:50.948 - 00:55:54.436, Speaker B: Earn yields, you know, it's kind of genius.
00:55:54.500 - 00:56:20.554, Speaker C: Yeah. This for the, like, fully collateralized one. So USDC, USDT, I think that's the strat. And then there's different. One maker is also, I think, one of the biggest. The protocol with one of the biggest revenue currently that is like, decentralized. And there's also, well, it's not really a stable coin, it's a synthetic dollar, but I don't really know how to cross qualify it.
00:56:20.554 - 00:57:19.544, Speaker C: Athena's USD is another one that, full disclosure, we are invested in, but it's another thing, which is the trading on shorting Ethereum and then also having some LST so that there's yield on both sides. As long as the. As the. How do you call it? As long as funding rates are positive, which has historically been the case in extremely extreme majority of days. So, yeah, there's different approaches and maybe there's space for still more. I think obviously the easiest one is fully collateralized because that's a historically easy thing that there's a lot of data on.
00:57:22.804 - 00:57:41.664, Speaker A: Yep. We'll see how USDT does. So Danik's actually right. USDT is the most dominant token in defi at the moment. Or like, it's being traded more than USDC at least. So, yeah, very confusing to me. All I see is USDC.
00:57:41.664 - 00:58:18.156, Speaker A: Where did you check Henry stats? Has he released a dashboard this week on Dexus? And it's one of the. Yeah, it's one of. It's the second most token being bought and sold. So on both places, weather's one and USDT is two. So there's a lot of trading activity happening on chain with USDT and not only on Tron, but rather on DVM chains that we all know. I would guess it's mostly ETH. Haven't looked into it that deep.
00:58:18.156 - 00:58:25.820, Speaker A: But anyways, I think we have a few more kind of rapid fire topics. So. Dolby, take it away for the first one.
00:58:25.972 - 00:59:29.192, Speaker C: Yes, boss, on it. So something that I've been looking into for a while, closely is staking. I don't think we mentioned it on the podcast, but historically, liquid staking tokens have taken most of the market share in terms of where, like, who controls and who stakes the ETH. So let me scroll to on this dashboard, and here you can see that there's like 30% of liquid staking, 30% of state teeth is behind liquid staking protocols in early 2024. So at the start of it, and then we saw another primitive, which is Eigen layer and liquid restaking and protocol starting to actually stake the yeast themselves, because that is mostly because of the Eigen layer caps. So liquid staking tokens are capped. You can't infinitely have them on Eigen layer, but you can spin up Eigen pools and stake it yourself.
00:59:29.192 - 01:00:29.594, Speaker C: And therefore, liquid restaking protocol started to take in ETH themselves and stake it on behalf of users and thus earning them higher yield. And since the beginning of the year, we've started to see that some of the staking share has moved from liquid staking to liquid restaking, which has taken a significant amount of a significant share now over 3%, although it was like below 1% at the start of the year. And liquid staking has, like, gone down three or 4% since as well. So some of it has been moving, you know, from one place to another. But there's also probably, well, there's definitely also some that came in from other places. And that's, like, historically very, very different to what we know. Lido has usually been always the biggest in terms of inflow.
01:00:29.594 - 01:00:56.224, Speaker C: Now it's the biggest in terms of out. It's the biggest. Sorry, it's the highest outflow, whereas Renzo and Ethify have the highest inflows. I thought that was an interesting development. So I expect things to keep going that way, at least until we see some Eigen layer airdrop happen, which I'm guessing at some point does. I'm not sure that's also.
01:00:56.384 - 01:00:58.528, Speaker A: It's going to be a while. It's going to be a while.
01:00:58.656 - 01:00:59.404, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:01.784 - 01:01:11.284, Speaker A: The last I heard is their development is not. Their timelines are not like, oh, we're going to release this in three months. The timeline is, we're going to release this in a year.
01:01:12.144 - 01:01:38.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I have no clue on the timeline at all. But I'm just saying, like, I think people are also speculating on that airdrop, which also drives this, this move even further. We'll see how it goes over the next few weeks and see if that keeps being the case. I want to move on to another. Sorry.
01:01:38.534 - 01:02:38.914, Speaker B: I have a theory about this. Like when you look at this chart, you can't really just say, oh, the lido money is flowing out and it goes into Etherfi. Etherfi is a newer project than Lido and they are. Maybe it's just like they're a different phase of the growth. Like Lido was very early adopted by absorbed a lot of TBL and now with the market warming up and I think there is the overall like a macro kind of theory that when the market is more bullish or like more warm and people will withdraw their money from staking and to do things here and there doing yields. And so maybe that's why Lido is showing a withdrawal trend and Etherfizer showing a inflow because they're just starting with all incentive and else. And I paste the link there, if you would share on your screen that there is a breakdown of total rewards across Ethereum, across the exclusion layer and consensus layer.
01:02:38.914 - 01:03:17.076, Speaker B: So if you hover on the rewards distribution bar, you could see that the consensus layer rewards, which I guess is from like attestation and staking, is like 74% and priority fee and MEV are coming from execution layer. So it's like the priority fee user paid and also the Coinbase transfer builder or whatever searcher transferred to the proposal on the exclusion layer. It's like less than 30%. That number was seven to three last year. Like a year ago when we checked. So it means like the consensus layer rewards percentage has been going up. So last year was still bear market.
01:03:17.076 - 01:03:49.074, Speaker B: And I think I actually was like Tom and another person, Mike Nooter, they were saying like, you know, when the market warming up, this number going to shift towards a higher rewards on consensus layer because like I guess less staking, it means higher rewards, you know, like less amount of staking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, yeah, I think just combining this number you could maybe see, you know, the lido outflow may not just be, you know, people are moving to other pools.
01:03:49.494 - 01:04:30.242, Speaker C: So yeah, it's a, I don't know if it's a flow from one to the other. I'm guessing there's some of it because there's just higher yield on one of them. So if you've got your state d, that's liquid, it makes sense. Also one already has a token, the other, I think Ethiopian now does, but it only just recently does. And Eigen layer is also rumored to eventually launch a token. I'm not sure if Renzo has a token. But all these things is, it's just you get more reward.
01:04:30.242 - 01:04:41.894, Speaker C: There's just higher incentives on liquid restaking protocols right now. And maybe not driving everything, but I think it is a small driver for the transition, at least.
01:04:42.434 - 01:04:53.042, Speaker B: Although Eigen layer will not say, drive the money out from Lido. Right? Because it's like you stake in Lido first, and then you stake in Eigen layer. So that's the restake.
01:04:53.098 - 01:05:32.988, Speaker C: No, no, no, no. So the reason. The reason this is also flowing, I think, to LRT's is because the LST's are capped in terms of how much can be placed into Eigen layer. So they regularly increase the cap. But the ETH itself, through eigen pools is not capped. So in order to gain more stakes, in order to keep activity going, LRT's need to stake it themselves. And this is why people are putting ETH rather than liquid stake lsts into liquid restaking protocols.
01:05:33.156 - 01:05:35.224, Speaker A: Oh, is it actually solo validators?
01:05:35.844 - 01:05:43.504, Speaker C: Well, yeah. So the chart I was showing is exclusively ETH, so it doesn't look at lsts or lts.
01:05:43.924 - 01:05:59.560, Speaker A: Yeah. So they accept Coinbase ETH, I think Cbeth or whatever it's called. They accept rocket pool ETH. They accept Lido ETH, but then they also accept solo validator ETH.
01:05:59.712 - 01:06:01.368, Speaker C: So just.
01:06:01.456 - 01:06:06.144, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you have to stake it yourself or you have to find some kind of service provider.
01:06:06.224 - 01:06:07.432, Speaker C: They stick it for you.
01:06:07.608 - 01:06:09.120, Speaker A: Ah, through.
01:06:09.232 - 01:06:10.912, Speaker C: That's what I mean. Through eigenpools. That's.
01:06:10.968 - 01:06:11.432, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:11.528 - 01:06:35.334, Speaker C: They run a pool that is doing restaking themselves. That's. They handle all this for you. And since every time it takes like, a day or two for LSD's to reach the cap, and therefore no one can stake through those anymore, people keep on staking through the native asset.
01:06:36.354 - 01:06:39.666, Speaker A: There's my growth strategy that makes the.
01:06:39.690 - 01:06:45.470, Speaker B: Restaking pool a staking pool. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
01:06:45.502 - 01:07:16.014, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. What I track on the dashboard is exclusively like the native assets. There's no. I have no idea how much etherfi has in lsts. And I think from what I heard, they also converted all the lsts they had into ETH itself to stake it all themselves and have it under their control. Yeah, but I'm not 100% sure. But all I know is this is only dragging the native asset.
01:07:17.314 - 01:07:20.494, Speaker A: Okay? That was a long, rapid fire.
01:07:21.594 - 01:07:22.706, Speaker C: That was a slow fire.
01:07:22.770 - 01:08:01.424, Speaker A: But fair enough, there were some things to be clarified here. So on the next topic, ask all as on chain analysts, Haydn Adams from Uniswap tweeted out, so Hayden just hit us out of the blue with is it worth removing events and moving to call traces for Uniswap v Thor for 1% gas savings on all swaps? And obviously us analysts or I'm speaking for myself, I say no because events are beautiful and makes it way easier to actually analyze those events. But maybe does anyone have a contrarian perspective here?
01:08:01.804 - 01:08:43.015, Speaker C: Yeah, I also clicked no so you can see the check mark. It's also because it's the right answer. But this has been a discussion for a while. I think you also have protocols popping up that intend on letting people have a modified client so you can actually run a forked version of Ethereum and follow the chain, but have events that aren't there being emitted on your chain, on your like, on your pipeline. Which is interesting, but I don't think, I don't like moving everything to that. I would rather have all events on chain. If you look, there's a good example.
01:08:43.015 - 01:09:37.154, Speaker C: So ambient is basically everything uniswap v four has as far as I know, and events aren't there. And what it's resulted in is I have no idea where to find ambient data and there's no, there's no way I'm gonna go ahead, go out of my way and abstract the data because looking through all traces and seeing like, okay, which token is this for? Is this just a swap or is it like some kind of, I don't know, you know, you got tokens that give a percentage of every swap to some other contractors. A lot of things going on. It's just a ton easier if there's events for everyone involved. And that includes analysts, but also devs that run any kind of app or protocol that need this data readily available for them to digest into their own pipeline.
01:09:37.854 - 01:09:55.934, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems to be the data standard that we've all kind of settled on. And a lot of applications are built on the premise that there's going to be events to index. And if you suddenly say we're not going to do events, you're just going to cause a lot, like you're of going to cost so much work throughout the entire industry it's going to be insane.
01:09:56.314 - 01:10:31.666, Speaker C: Yeah, there's also like, it's a weird thing where I think the focus should be on reducing fees rather than saying, hey, let's remove 1% of those. 1% is like negligible for, I think almost everyone who, every user, at least the protocols themselves, aren't the one paying. They're like they can spin it up as like we're paying this and it's expensive, but the reality is the user is paying and I don't know if the guy who's paying a high amount of gas is also paying it for this. I don't think he cares all that much about this.
01:10:31.690 - 01:10:36.374, Speaker A: 1% what do you mean by fees? I think that's a bit confusing terminology.
01:10:36.754 - 01:10:48.274, Speaker C: So the gas savings, if you remove the vents you'd have around 1% of savings in terms of gas that the end user is paying. That's what I mean by fees.
01:10:48.574 - 01:11:37.458, Speaker B: I mean even though you say okay it's user paying the gas fee and so maybe developers don't care that much. I think developer want to build things that user will adopt so there's still incentive developer there. Although I think my opinion on all this topic was that I was like strongly against it. I'm just like on chain data maxi as like first of all if you remove swap token event, swap eventually, then the call data doesn't really tell you how much in the end they get. It only tells you like what they intended to execute and that's not going to be the actual token you're receiving because of the slippage and traded collision. Like swap event was the actual only truth. Maybe you can argue then you can maybe join a token transfer event to find actual the token received amount, but then that would be like a lot more complicated to join correctly and everything.
01:11:37.458 - 01:12:36.458, Speaker B: So yeah, I thought I was like really bad kind of movement. But then there were people who were talking about this project called Shadow XYz, which is a data project. They proposed this pretty bold idea of dev. You can remove all the events and you can just do a customized event locally towards a shadow network. And so basically not posting the events on chain on Ethereum, but we can run another like you know, network of, you know, people, people can run nodes and then anyone can create from a shadow node and you can add like shit ton of like details into events which actually could maybe make the data work easier. But again there will be composability issue, you know like only when the shadow data is like really easy to consume and everything it might be, you know really a good thing. But I also think like there is a layer of, you know, credibility or like security guarantee that's removed once you are moving off from Ethereum in it.
01:12:36.458 - 01:12:48.866, Speaker B: So yeah, I think it makes sense for them to try to remove things to save gas overall, but it will just be some headache for data people. Yeah, yeah.
01:12:48.890 - 01:13:09.644, Speaker A: I mean is there maybe a world where they remove it on Mainnet and just leave it alive on all L2s that they deploy to. Because on the L2, I really don't care about this 1%, but if I pay 100, I mean, even on Mainnet, like, what are you gonna like if you pay $100 for a swap? Are you really gonna care that it's $99 instead?
01:13:09.804 - 01:13:22.180, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. It's like, I don't think the end user cares all that. If he's ready to pay 100, he's fine with 1% change regardless of how much he's paying. Like, 1% is just negligible.
01:13:22.372 - 01:13:27.944, Speaker A: Anyways, this sounds like an engineer trying to over optimize problems that don't exist.
01:13:28.324 - 01:13:36.584, Speaker C: Exactly. Like moving to Altus and reducing gas. There just is much, I think, a much more better way forward.
01:13:36.924 - 01:13:58.064, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, well, we'll see if Hayden will send him this segment as the data analyst experts here. But, yeah, I think, Dobby, you wanted to show something that Andrew built, so maybe let's switch over there.
01:13:58.804 - 01:14:42.518, Speaker C: Yeah. I have one last thing, which is one of my most frequent questions I get is I analyze stuff on Dune, and I think it's not necessarily easy to go from someone who's never really touched on chain data to being familiar and understanding how it all goes. And Andrew has been kind of like the teacher of all things. He's headmaster at dual analytics, as you can see on the right. And I think it's a good title because it actually represents, like, he releases articles very frequently on how he analyzed something new. So he's done stuff on bitcoin, he's done stuff on Solana, of course, on evms as well. But I find his resources super helpful.
01:14:42.518 - 01:15:27.724, Speaker C: So here in this tweet, he shows a small demo, and you can actually check it out on here and here you can see. So for the audio listeners, it looks like a tree that you can click through. And every branch has topics that you can go and dive into. So that can be topics very broad for understanding how on chain data works, but also much more specific. So how do you want to look into tokens, specifically bridges, roll ups? And he's done quite a few articles where he explains his process and how he goes about his analysis. Yeah, I think this is a really, really good job for if you ever want to jump into on chain data, I really recommend you check this out.
01:15:31.904 - 01:16:01.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I can only agree to that, Andrew. Yeah, his work output is insane. He's the most productive person that I know. So with that, Danny, you've prepared a section on April Fool's scribes of the week, or however we will call this section. There was some very stupid April Fools jokes, and we haven't heard anyone else talk about them, so we might, we thought we might just give it a shot.
01:16:02.864 - 01:16:29.344, Speaker B: I just thought it's kind of hilarious. Like, initially, the thing caught my eyes was like, David Hoffman from backlash was saying he's joining Solana. I thought it was. It's real for a second, but then I was seeing an article saying, oh, plus the bag is very juicy. And I was like, okay, this is for sure a joke. And then there was like a bunch of fire there caused and then merged from Solana ecosystem. I guess he kind of trolled against that.
01:16:29.344 - 01:17:19.584, Speaker B: But yeah, they were like doing the kind of like, reverse trolling on this. And so there's this thread together by cointelegraph, and there is this new bunkered coin announced by Toli from Solana, saying they're going to transmit through shortwave radio channels. That's a good primitive Vitalik joint. As well as introduced the Degen communism as the only correct ideology for crypto. And then there was like, this one is a ridiculous one was like, there is a pseudo anonymous account claimed that juice box was raised by paradigm for $69 billion and the price went up. Crazy. This is straight scam.
01:17:21.124 - 01:17:23.024, Speaker C: This is like pope and dump. Like.
01:17:26.284 - 01:17:26.764, Speaker B: They can.
01:17:26.804 - 01:17:36.248, Speaker A: Excuse me, a pseudonymous account can. Do we know anything more about this? Like, is it just literally some random guy on Twitter is like, oh, juice box?
01:17:36.336 - 01:17:37.376, Speaker B: I think so.
01:17:37.560 - 01:17:41.320, Speaker A: Paradigm and then some. Okay, that's very interesting.
01:17:41.512 - 01:18:07.188, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I thought it was just like, ridiculous. Yeah, actually, so things were finishing this episode. I prepared also an Easter egg for you guys. So recently, there is a, you know, like a music AI called suno AI. I don't know if you guys seen it, actually. Storm from paradigm.
01:18:07.188 - 01:18:40.992, Speaker B: He's also a data guy, but he also loves rust. He showed me first his song, which is rewrite in rust. And, like, the lyrics is hilarious. It's just like, oh, we want to rewrite everything from python to rust, etc. It shows, you know, represents perfectly the fanatic personality of all the Rastasians. So I tried the snow one for our podcast, and so I wrote a song called Wizard Anthem in like five minutes. It was the AI generated lyrics and AI generated tone.
01:18:40.992 - 01:18:52.146, Speaker B: So maybe this can become our future theme music. Like, I got feedback from audience that, like, we need an intro and outro music. So you want to give it a listen?
01:18:52.210 - 01:18:53.014, Speaker C: Let's go.
01:18:53.634 - 01:18:58.494, Speaker B: So I'm gonna play the music now. Okay. Yeah, let's go.
01:19:08.754 - 01:19:26.814, Speaker C: We met online in the data community three friends with a love for crypto in Unity Hill Dobby the house elf casting spells with magic he likes to trace black rock wallets with heuristics boxer the horse with crypto story to narrate keep transit drama from timeline.
01:19:30.394 - 01:19:32.894, Speaker B: Diaper she talks about me.
01:19:35.954 - 01:19:36.934, Speaker C: Crypto.
01:20:07.184 - 01:20:08.204, Speaker B: How's that?
01:20:09.224 - 01:20:13.004, Speaker C: That's impressive. Like, AI wise. That's really impressive.
01:20:13.344 - 01:20:18.884, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I tuned the lyrics slightly afterwards. Like to make it more content wise, relevant.
01:20:19.664 - 01:20:49.414, Speaker A: Yeah. If we ever record a live episode, we have to wrap this live. You know, we gotta do the chorus live. All right, I think that is it for this week. I learned a lot. I hope you, our listeners, learned a lot, and we will be back in two weeks with another episode. I don't know if we are going to have a guest or not, but we will see and you will find out.
01:20:49.414 - 01:20:54.654, Speaker A: As always, feedback is appreciated. Any last words, stanning?
01:20:56.234 - 01:20:57.534, Speaker C: No, this was great.
01:20:57.954 - 01:20:58.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
