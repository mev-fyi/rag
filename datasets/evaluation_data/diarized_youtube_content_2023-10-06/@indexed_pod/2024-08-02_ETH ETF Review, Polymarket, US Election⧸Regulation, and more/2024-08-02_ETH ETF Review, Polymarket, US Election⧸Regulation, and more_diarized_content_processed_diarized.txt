00:00:00.480 - 00:00:31.015, Speaker A: It looks pretty bad if you think about it. It's like, yeah, we launched an ETF and like the total AUM has actually decreased. But like that is mostly due to the market structure of Grayscale having this one fund which is very high fee structure. Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Index podcast where the three of us come together every couple of weeks to discuss on chain data metrics that move to crypto industry and of course chart crimes. With me today, I have Denning Onshake, Corgi at flashbots.
00:00:31.095 - 00:00:31.719, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:31.887 - 00:01:10.405, Speaker A: And Hildobi resident data house of at Dragonfly gm. And I am Boxer and I am the community powers at Dune. Before we get into it, nothing we say here should be relied upon as legal, financial, investment, tax or even life advice. We are acting independently of our respective professional roles here and with that I'm very excited to dive into this episode. Today we're going to talk about ETFs and poly market. Really the only two kind of metrics that or topics that are any interesting right now. I think the industry is kind of like everyone is on vacation.
00:01:10.405 - 00:02:09.509, Speaker A: I think the French have like the Olympics are going on. It's like there's not really that much happening even though like an ETF was released which is like, that's super exciting. But like the price is just like everyone is just asleep at the wheel. So like, and like the US election is still coming up. So like, or like the hot phase of the election is still coming up. So it's like everyone, it's just like a big suspension moment in time and we thought we'd take the time to kind of dig through two old favorites and that is Dobby, of course, as the kind of industry expert on, on chain ETF flows is going to give us an update or like give us an introduction to Ethereum ETFs and we're going to get an update on Bitcoin ETFs and I duck a bit more through Poly Market data. Previous listeners, previous listeners of the podcast know that it's one of my favorite topics.
00:02:09.509 - 00:02:25.103, Speaker A: So I just curated a bunch of news and charts and we're going to dig into the rise of polymarket. And yeah, with that Dobby, how do we, how do we start talking about Ethereum ETFs? Like what's the, what's the best angle here?
00:02:25.159 - 00:03:43.915, Speaker C: Well, I think we can start from the beginning is that last week on July 23rd, 24th. 24th, there were nine ETFs that went live that were, you know, kind of like akin to the Bitcoin ones but for Ethereum this time there's a lot of similar issues and there's also grayscale that introduced the second trust fund. So yeah, I'm going to run through all this first I think it's important to look at, to make the distinction between reported flows, which are the flows that are going to be reported by centralized actors and Bloomberg term like you're going to find on Bloomberg Terminal and stuff like this. And then there's, you know, the different differentiator to other ETFs is that you're going to have those flows happening on chain as well. And I've kind of had this little thing where I'm trying to track those myself, trying to track where those assets are held and I'm going to run you through what that looks like, what the process is and the, you know, how to interpret this data differently from the reported flows and everything. So first I think let's look at reported flows from the popular. The website to check those is going to be Far side.
00:03:43.915 - 00:04:13.145, Speaker C: Far side has a. Has. It's essentially just a table that has the flows but they tend to be the most efficient in terms of reporting. So those numbers come in here first before anyone any anywhere else. I guess like they say they focus on speed over accuracy but usually it's pretty accurate. They also have some charts. So here you can see a high level of the reported flows but I think it's still fairly limited.
00:04:13.145 - 00:04:58.931, Speaker C: And yeah, so this is how it looks like what you're used to for usual ETFs data. So we have the on chain flows those. The caveat is those happen due to necessity rule within one working day after trading actually happened. The rules basically you got to settle within T +1. It used to be T +2 but now it's T +1. But yeah, basically the flows you were going to Observe here on July 24th were reported and happened on July 23rd, but they just were settled the next working day. I think actually that's one of the things we should, you know one of the proving points we could have with blockchain is that we could settle much faster and we don't even need T +1.
00:04:58.931 - 00:05:42.325, Speaker C: We could even have like, you know, settle at the end of the day. That would make a lot of sense. There's not much of a reason in the blockchain world as far as I know to settle the next day, but maybe that's my tradfi illiteracy and my reading on this is wrong. But Yeah, I think that's, you know, blockchains are much more efficient than pure systems and that would be one of the ways to showcase that, I think. Anyways, those ETFs were for the most part started from scratch with almost 0 ETH. But there was grayscale that had a trust already eth E. So ethe which already had quite a bit of Ethereum from way back in the day.
00:05:43.465 - 00:05:55.495, Speaker A: Is that the same as the old bitcoin situation with the bitcoin whatever fund they had, was it also depict as strongly or is it actually.
00:05:56.195 - 00:06:38.219, Speaker C: It's the exact same situation where with GBTC where people waiting to redeem and essentially assets were stuck for a while until the ETFs were converted. So in this case that last week for bitcoin it was in early January 11th I want to say, but I'm not exactly sure somewhere around there. But yeah, here you can see that there was 2.9 million eth that it started with. And to start actually something differently. They started with by making two separate funds, trust funds and they created grayscale and grayscale mini. The grayscale is going to be the usual fund.
00:06:38.219 - 00:07:07.693, Speaker C: So the similar, the one that's similar to the one we found on, we've seen on Bitcoin with 2.5% fee and then they created the mini one which has 0.15% fee and they started it by seeding it with 10% of the assets they had from grayscale. So they started with 2.9 million eth and then I guess 290,000 of those went to the grayscale mini to start it.
00:07:07.829 - 00:07:19.335, Speaker A: So if I was an investor in ethics e, I got 10% of my shares in like a mini form and that's the rest. That's the part I'm not.
00:07:20.875 - 00:07:50.831, Speaker C: That's the part I'm not too sure on the. They also. The Mini trust fund was also launched today for bitcoin so they converted also 10%. But the way they phrase it is, they say you don't have to do anything. I'm not exactly sure which customers are converted how that plays out for the, you know, on the other side and the actual investors. Yeah, that's. I'm not exactly sure to be honest.
00:07:50.903 - 00:07:54.807, Speaker A: Maybe they own 10% of the float. Like maybe they just.
00:07:54.951 - 00:09:00.843, Speaker C: That's probable. It's probable, yeah, it's probable. I think the strategy though is, I think pretty clear is that due to the very high fee, if you compare it to other ETFs here you can see that 2.5% fee is very, very high compared to the rest and therefore they have quite a bit of ETH that they had already and people are slowly withdrawing them, but they're benefiting from those fees, but they're bleeding out in asset under management. So they introduced this other mini fund that has the lowest fee and in a way, I guess to gain, to keep getting market share, to retain their market share. Because if we look at the bitcoin situation over the past few months now, they're close to 25% in market share, which is way down from 100%, obviously. But yeah, that has to do, I think with the fees and the current competitors that are at play here.
00:09:00.843 - 00:09:17.295, Speaker C: I also found it interesting how their ticker for the mini funds is eth instead of having a differentiated one from Ethereum. And same for bitcoin where it's btc. Now I think that's a bit confusing, but I guess also maybe a good strategy. I don't know.
00:09:18.315 - 00:09:53.855, Speaker A: Yeah, any boomer goes into his like whatever terminal and types in ETH and like that's the first thing that pops up. And it's the same ticker is like the ETH that you see on your, I don't know, your Yahoo Finance News or whatever. It's like that seems, that seems like a good strategy, even though that is pretty confusing. Yeah. One more question. Do you know why they call it mini? Is it like the shared denomination lower? Like, what's their like, marketing move of calling it mini? Like that's a, that's a bit of a confusing.
00:09:54.715 - 00:10:21.465, Speaker C: It's a good question. I'm not too sure, honestly. The only differentiator I know is the fee. And I guess my understanding is probably that grayscale, the large one is for larger investors and many for smaller ones. You know, if you want to. Depending on the size of, of if you want to invest the amount of ETH you want to invest. That is my understanding, but I'm not exactly sure on the exact differentiators here.
00:10:21.465 - 00:10:40.195, Speaker C: I've never traded an ETF myself. I'm just looking. I'm just more on the on chain side. That's more where my expertise is. But that would be a great question. I think we, we should one day have some, someone from one of these EQRs, maybe explain more this side.
00:10:40.695 - 00:10:42.727, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be interesting to get.
00:10:42.751 - 00:10:43.955, Speaker C: Both sides of the story.
00:10:44.575 - 00:11:28.939, Speaker A: Okay, we'll just run with the theory that mini fees, like smaller fees. So they just called it mini, but I don't know, it's probably some Mixture of targeting small investors. Maybe the share price is lower and then the fees are lower. And yeah, just using the E ticker for this, this is obviously their product that's future ready. And with the eth, it's like the same story as in Bitco, just milking those like poor people who are stuck inside of there for tax reasons or for like they're lazy and they don't want to convert or like there's like a platitude of reasons why you could be stuck in there. So like they're just keeping the, like never change your running system. It works like they're, they're earning 2.5%
00:11:28.939 - 00:11:50.735, Speaker A: management fees for doing fuck all on $7 billion. Like I, I keep that running like, yeah, it's not, it's not very honest. Or like, is it honest? Is it dishonest? It's probably the wrong word. It's not very nice. Let's just put it that way. It's not very nice of them, but from a business perspective, yeah, of course, that makes sense.
00:11:51.315 - 00:12:48.117, Speaker C: I think the fee has always been even Pre conversion at 2.5%. So people who invested were in the know of what was going on, but they also kind of filled the gap of this lack of etf. For a while it was like the institutional product equivalent of having Ethereum or having Bitcoin. And that's why they accumulated all this, all these assets. Actually right now mostly because, I mean, because of grayscale, there's over 2% of all ETH that is backing Ethereum ETFs. It's a little over half that of Bitcoin where I think we're in the 4% or something. But yeah, basically this seeded amount kind of helped propel these AUM to these current levels.
00:12:48.117 - 00:13:37.757, Speaker C: And so far the outflows have mostly been bigger than the inflows of the other ETFs. So all outflows are from grayscales, large funds. And all the others have seen inflows since or none or nothing at all. So far we've seen negatives aside from the first day. If we look ahead we can see that yesterday I had the second day with a positive flow. So that will be reflected as well. And what we're seeing as well is I don't have this chart on mine, so showing it here, but that the, the assets in EFI have been bleeding faster than they have for Bitcoin in terms of days since conversion.
00:13:37.757 - 00:14:08.895, Speaker C: So we're already like down 20% of Grayscale's Ethy Aum and that also, of course, one of the things that the chart doesn't factor in is this conversion of the 10% into the MiniTrust. So yeah, it's not just as simple as outflows have been bigger here than before because also it's not the same dollar amounts and everything. But yeah, it's, I guess, good for perspective and especially if you put the.
00:14:09.355 - 00:14:13.139, Speaker B: 10% back the chart kind of line. Right.
00:14:13.307 - 00:15:23.285, Speaker C: Because if we look here, we look roughly to be. Yeah, I think we would be somewhat in line with the previous outflows. But yeah, it's. The thing is now today we should see not 10%, but here a few percent drop because 10% of those amounts were converted just this morning into the Bitcoin minitrust which they launched right this morning. I was actually confused because if you look here, you're going to see on this chart this like mace windu little candles, those are actually From Grayscale withdrawing 10% of their AUM and then over the same day, plus the next day. So plus this morning could have earned those into grayscale mini, which actually right now is already 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6th largest in terms of ETFs for Bitcoin, just because it barely just started. I don't think there was any trading yet or at least not recorded on here.
00:15:23.285 - 00:15:55.769, Speaker C: So, yeah, 1.8 billion started and 2.8% of market share. And you can also see that grayscale has gone way down since it started. If we look here, it's especially helped with we were in 30% before the conversion and now we're closing in on 25% of assets. So that's also why I think, you know, they're starting to bleed and you know, they're running out of like aum, given the fee. So it's a good idea to make a second fund that has lower fee.
00:15:55.769 - 00:15:57.713, Speaker C: I guess, you know, it's a, it's.
00:15:57.729 - 00:16:24.467, Speaker A: A strategy that makes sense going back to the eth. Etf. Yeah. So this went live when I think last week somewhere July 23rd. Okay. And since then we've basically observed a lot of outflows, but those outflows mainly come from grayscale. And you could now theorize like, okay, people are finally unlocked.
00:16:24.467 - 00:17:24.815, Speaker A: They finally have liquidity on this asset without having any. What is it? Deviation from the normal market price or deep pegging is like, I don't know, you could use both words. Um, but ETF in general, they've kind of like suffered under the spell of grayscale because grayscale has this like huge fee structure and now like maybe some of these like, like I, I looked at the like outflow charge and I was like okay, probably eth ETF investors are a bit more switched on because it's like even further down the risk curve. So like they will be exiting the grayscale like 2.5% fee fund even faster than like the bitcoin guys who. Or probably like I don't know, like my, my assumption would be that like more people in general have invested in Bitcoin just because it's more proven and like the ETF is even further down the risk curve. So like less people who are like more keyed into the space have invested into that like eth like trust fund or whatever grayscale launched before.
00:17:24.815 - 00:17:56.999, Speaker A: Yeah. So, okay, so eth ETFs down. Like it, it, it looks pretty bad. Like if you think about it, it's like yeah, we launched an ETF and like the total AUM has actually decreased. But like that is mostly due to the market structure of grayscale having this one fund which is very high fee structure. And like savvy investors now probably like maybe they switch to something like Fireblocks or like another custodian platform. Maybe they just like raw dock their ETH on.
00:17:56.999 - 00:18:23.915, Speaker A: On. On. On Coinbase or they like they actually like hold staked ethical somewhere. And it's like this, like this ETF is like really kind of a joke product for anyone who's keyed in. And if you were locked into this like grayscale vehicle, like I'd be getting the out of there as well. So this like if you look at like the trash fire guys probably look at this and they're like oh yeah, like this is, this is worthless. Like look, the market doesn't want eth.
00:18:23.915 - 00:18:45.955, Speaker A: But I think you need like, I think this nuance like actually really helps of like we, you can break this down into like okay, it's probably just nobody likes grayscale. Like this, this like vehicle from Grayscale is like very dis. Like it's not a, it's not your like game theoretical smartest move to stay in there so like you, you bail as soon as you can.
00:18:46.655 - 00:19:43.815, Speaker C: Like for, for a long time it was the only solution to in terms of regulation. Like you can't, you know, Americans can't necessarily have their company or fund or whatever directly invest into ETH or bitcoin and these are like investment vehicles to facilitate that. So it's more of a regulation thing than anything else. But of Course, if regulation aside, you are not getting the better deal. You can stake your eth, you can even stake it with liquid staking or with a custodian, so you don't even have to manage it. And you would be getting more higher returns on your, on your investments in that case. And for now the staking was out of the, out of the question for ETFs but I think my guess is eventually those will be able to stake those ETH because it just makes sense.
00:19:43.815 - 00:20:31.199, Speaker C: But yeah, it will take a few months for good regulations to agree there and be like, okay, we agree that you can stake it. Also, the assumption based on the data we have is that the discount pre launch was actually smaller than it was for bitcoin. So it was smaller on EC on grayscale than it was for GBTC grayscale. And the reasoning is that people think there's going to be less outflows because there's less of an overhang of people waiting to redeem those, those tokens. We'll see how that plays out. I think we'll just watch the data, but maybe that's the case. We'll see.
00:20:31.199 - 00:21:01.815, Speaker C: I don't know. Because Bitcoin ETFs had seen pretty brutal outflows early on. Flows remain mostly positive, but they were heavily impacted by, if you look here, all the negative flows are in 90% of cases from grayscale with the rest being mostly positive. Aside from like the off day where you saw other stuff happen of course, but that, you know, that tends to play out with market movements and other stuff like this.
00:21:01.935 - 00:21:43.895, Speaker B: My way of reading this data is I think it actually might just be somewhat kind of like speculative and also regulation reason, like maybe some big funds tradify funds they want to invest in eth and as Dobby said, there's no way they can actually invest legally and grayscale was the only one. And the fact that they're willing to pay 2.5% fee means that they think the ETH price during the anticipation of the ETF will go up more than that. And so they are kind of like selling the news. My understanding it's like east might go up until the ETF is actually live and it makes sense to hold it until then. And when other issuers coming up with lower fee and they might naturally go to others.
00:21:44.725 - 00:22:34.279, Speaker C: So yeah, they were also stuck. I think that's why if you look here, you can see this very linear decrease. As far as I understand that's mostly the fees more than anything else. So the assets were locked in and just the fee was bleeding out until the conversion happened. So since mid-2021, not even early 2021, I think the other interesting side of the story isn't just the data, but how I gather the data. And that's something maybe I haven't been super transparent on. So basically the way it works is I used to have, for Bitcoin, I had a query where I tagged every address individually.
00:22:34.279 - 00:23:16.055, Speaker C: I went daily to add new ones, and it can be quite a bit of work. The reason being that you don't. It's not just about adding new addresses, but those issuers, they rotate those addresses for security purposes. And so every once in a while you'll have like all of grayscale, have like basically outflows to zero, but it's actually just then moving to new wallets. So you got to keep those tracks and make sure that you're tracking the proper wallets to mitigate that. I've moved essentially all my process offline. So if you can see here on the right, I have these data sets that I upload on Dune that anyone can query.
00:23:16.055 - 00:23:54.765, Speaker C: So Bitcoin ETFs, addresses is going to be the list of addresses, metadata is going to be the ticker, the fee amounts, the websites and everything that I can have. So I can put it in place on the dashboard. Same for Ethereum. So it's structured the same and then there's update thresholds. This one is actually really important. The reason is that given this wallet rotation, if I just kept it going without having a threshold on the data, it would mean that there's a wallet rotation. Therefore the chart shows mass outflows when it's not really the case, because it just is that I haven't tagged the new addresses.
00:23:54.765 - 00:24:28.017, Speaker C: So I have a threshold that I update on every, every time I do a manual update to make sure I'm not like, it's not processing wrong data and not, you know, misleading anyone. That's, that's my, my main goal is to make sure. I try to remain as factual as possible and try to get as close to the full story as possible. So, you know, tracking all these addresses, which isn't easy in terms of tracking. There's, there's. There's multiple things. So most of these have.
00:24:28.017 - 00:25:19.005, Speaker C: Much like Bitcoin, they haven't disclosed their addresses, but wait, but two of them have disclosed something. So 21 shares has disclosed a proof of funds. So it's a chainlink, Oracle. And here you can see at different moments in time how much is reported to be under management for backing the CE product. So you can see it jumped to 2800 ETH as of last week, but it hasn't seen much flow since. And I think this is such a cool product that like it's such a cool way to showcase some of crypto's, you know, benefits to TrackFi. Like you can actually see the assets under the management and you can have different autocores oracles looking up and querying this data without necessarily disclosing the addresses.
00:25:19.005 - 00:25:26.657, Speaker C: Yeah, to me it's like such a cool proof of the benefits of crypto relative to current systems.
00:25:26.801 - 00:25:37.129, Speaker A: Have you looked into how this actually works? Like, is there like a ZK proof, whatever thing happening? How do the Oracles know which addresses to look at? And how's that?
00:25:37.177 - 00:25:39.289, Speaker C: Like, that's a good question.
00:25:39.337 - 00:26:13.471, Speaker A: I'm not sure what are the trust assumptions of this? That would be because like I, I can give like a bunch of random, I guess they could, like the addresses could sign transactions and then prove that it's actually 21 shares to the oracles. But like the Oracles don't finally disclose who's like, I don't know, like there's probably like some kind of cryptography that you can prove. Like I can prove that this address is like they could just sign transactions in the end, I guess, like they wouldn't appear on chain but like they could prove to the nodes that they are actually who they say they are.
00:26:13.543 - 00:26:53.735, Speaker C: It's a consensus thing where there's like 16 different oracles. So like, you know, I mean much like basically blockchains, you know, if one's laying, I don't know what they have. Maybe it's some ZK proofs or maybe they just have the addresses and are, you know, like, I'm not exactly sure, but I guess that's another story. We should dive into Oracles and Chainlink at some point. I think that's a, that's a whole bigger story that is interesting in and of itself. But yeah, so that's one thing is you have proof of funds and then you have address disclosure, which is what Bitwise is doing. And Bitwise shares on their website.
00:26:53.735 - 00:27:32.685, Speaker C: If you look here, that's like the front end of their ETF product. If you scroll a bit here, you have the list of addresses that, where the assets are located and they keep updating those and they have the same for Bitcoin. And also I'm in touch with them and they've shared an API, so I can easily query and update them on the fly. So props to them for making all this super easy. And I think it's also a cool showcase of crypto is like where you have these threat people investing in those products. You might as well showcase them. What are the benefits? So much like proof of funds.
00:27:32.685 - 00:27:44.885, Speaker C: I think address disclosure so anyone can look it up is also super cool and makes a ton of sense to showcase. But it'll maybe take a while to convert larger issuer into this.
00:27:44.925 - 00:28:18.755, Speaker A: Thinking, yeah, why like if they're, they're just like I'm going to release my addresses, I don't care. It's actually kind of interesting that everyone else is like oh no, please don't look at my addresses. Like I'm so vulnerable. It's like what are you, like what are you guys laughing about? Like you should just have like good private key management. I don't like, I, I like I, I would want to understand this but like I, I haven't ever understood the argument of like my addresses are public. So like I'm more of a security threat. It's like how, like how would that make sense? Like I don't see that.
00:28:19.345 - 00:28:41.561, Speaker B: I feel like it's just like a trap fi mindset and the web3 gene. Like I don't know if it's true, but I would like to attribute the fact that 21 shares always share their addresses. They're so on chain because there are analysts like Tom Wan and others, they always on chain, they probably nudge them being like hey, we should share this. And they started.
00:28:41.633 - 00:29:13.605, Speaker A: They didn't actually, they don't actually share their addresses. They are going through this hoop of the chaining oracles. So maybe there's also some regulatory stuff in the way here like because like I like this is probably like the 21 shared people are probably like we would want to release this but like we can't. So yeah, I think like at this point we really should talk to some ETF issuer and ask, ask why, why the hell this is not possible or like what their perspective on, on this is because like we can theorize all we want.
00:29:14.115 - 00:30:03.099, Speaker C: They also made this. So that's tom1 from 21 shares and sharing. All these are private so you can't see the addresses. And they have I think API from Coinbase something where they pull the address list and generate the flows from it. And I've talked to some funds and it's mostly about regulation and just like it's just work to get the regulation in a way that this is possible and it's too heavy of a lift for too small of a reward I guess to them in their eyes, hopefully that changes. But yeah, this is what they have. The thing is they're not necessarily willing to disclose the addresses but just the amounts that are flown.
00:30:03.099 - 00:30:35.673, Speaker C: This is plenty to just dox them because such large amounts that not many addresses have remotely closed of a flow. And that's like basically how I dox them. That's how I find all the addresses. Like blackrock moving funds. It doesn't just, you know, it's not like someone buying an nft, it's a whole other story. And therefore it's pretty easy to track. The only one that is much harder is Fidelity that's commingling the fund of all its assets.
00:30:35.673 - 00:31:02.039, Speaker C: So it's kind of hard. Like I can track the inflows and I'm tracking the outflows but the actual holdings, it, you know, it commingles everything. So it's a bit of a mess. That's for, I don't know, security purposes. They have a whole article that's interesting about this. But yeah, right now I think they don't realize how easy it is actually to dox if you put in the work. But it's also important if you do put this work.
00:31:02.039 - 00:31:36.915, Speaker C: Like I would never put this out if I wasn't very confident that my flows actually match what is reported because that wouldn't make sense. So that's also what I track. I track also, you know, the seeded amounts. So the amounts that were already in there to start with the flows when those happened. I make sure that there's no flows during the weekends, that it's only during training days. Yeah, all this, all this kind of stuff. And another thing as well that I forgot to mention is the other reason other than legal why they don't necessarily share addresses is because they're afraid about people like sending them stuff.
00:31:36.915 - 00:32:07.645, Speaker C: And you know, like therefore everything that's in there they have to report. So there's some funds that are getting ordinals that are like hodl. Like I saw a bunch Arkham was posting about this about like receiving like HODL or like stuff about like anti government and stuff like this which is like crazy but whatever. Like that's, that's a possibility and they have to report this Ethereum, it's probably even bigger of a mess because you could send, you know, there's much many more tokens than just bitcoin and ordinal.
00:32:08.185 - 00:32:22.645, Speaker A: You could, you could tornado, you could tornado dust them. That would be the most Fun thing, just send them something straight from Tornado Cash. I think just get the regulators. It's just like, let's talk about it like what's happening here.
00:32:24.625 - 00:33:03.289, Speaker C: You can send them like liquid staking tokens as well, which they're technically not allowed to have. Where did you cut the line? And it's like legally it's problem but I think it's just also regulations have to at some point catch on to just the way things work in crypto if they have to embrace it. Yeah, it'll take some time but I think eventually we'll work our way for the through this. But generally I really appreciate 21 shares in Bitwise like commitment to being more I guess crypto friendly and being more you know, understanding of those products rather than just releasing an ETF on top of them.
00:33:03.417 - 00:33:29.975, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. I think we should celebrate and elevate those who, who do share and who do live these crypto values. And the other ones, maybe they'll, they all like get it one day. I mean they already have an ECTF so like they're probably in it for the money but like that's, that's how you get them, you know, like yeah, over time they'll just realize okay, this is actually, this is actually pretty cool. Like we're earning money with this, but it's also just good tech.
00:33:30.055 - 00:34:24.477, Speaker C: I have one more thing, one last thing which isn't actually ETF but more about my pipeline. I want to share this tool that Storm from Paradigm made which I'm leveraging which is called Spice and enables you to query the Dune API in the most. I think it's, I think it's a better, it's just more simple, it's way simpler to use than the rolled in API and it's just a great product. So if you ever looking to query Dune Data, this is a super cool tool that I recommend using both the. Because a lot of the Dune API works in a asynchronous way where you got to wait and ping to ask if it's ran this does it synchronously so you just wait for it to be done and outputs the result and other like ease of use features. But yeah, this is, this is a super cool product. So thank you Storm for this.
00:34:24.541 - 00:34:33.225, Speaker A: It's awesome. Where are you hosting all your like are you manually running your pipelines or are they in some docker image or.
00:34:33.925 - 00:35:00.750, Speaker C: For now it's all on a. It's all locally like It's a private GitHub repo. I'll probably make it open at some point. Like I don't think there's much of a need for everyone to see it. It's not like super informative. I'm creating a bunch of queries where I look for patterns that I know are definitely going to match what I'm looking for. And then I'm also creating afterwards individually all the addresses still to make sure I'm not adding anything wrong.
00:35:00.750 - 00:35:22.315, Speaker C: Any deposit addresses. That's also why I'm working on deposit address spells so I can programmatically single those out. But yeah, there's a. It's like. There's like three different scripts that I run, plus some manual checks that are all local. Yeah, I'm happy to share it with anyone who needs them.
00:35:22.435 - 00:35:27.059, Speaker A: Of course with that, that was a very thorough rundown of the current ETF landscape.
00:35:27.147 - 00:35:30.055, Speaker B: So when I say nothing, there was legal advice.
00:35:31.555 - 00:35:32.495, Speaker C: Oh yeah.
00:35:34.275 - 00:36:06.033, Speaker A: Of course. We don't know anything. Don't trust us. Yeah, I think interesting kind of stage of the market where it's like we, we now have like Bitcoin ETFs with Ethereum ETFs, 4% of all Bitcoin are already in an ETF, which is like. That actually seems like a lot. Rather large amount. And I'm actually surprised that like even for eth, it's like 2% which was like, I guess a bit more hidden when it was just like this weird grayscale vehicle because like it, it was the same amount before.
00:36:06.033 - 00:36:21.481, Speaker A: Right. It's just like now it's like more coming to, coming into the spotlight. Yeah. Who. Who are gonna be the like Wall street bros who. Who buy the Ethereum etf? I don't really know. Like all of this is like very confusing to me.
00:36:21.481 - 00:36:52.195, Speaker A: And yeah, we should, I mean the problem like if we get somebody on from one of those ETF issues is probably like they can't talk very openly since they're like even more bound by regulation than like usvc. Denning and me are like kind of free people in that. In that extent. But yeah, it's going to be. Yeah, it's going to be interesting to observe this future and we'll check back in in a couple months with our resident ETF expert.
00:36:53.295 - 00:37:32.015, Speaker C: This all relies on the accuracy of the address list that you're looking into. And I think the problem is, you know, you can, anyone can do the job, but it's, you know, it puts. It takes in some extra work to do it well and if you don't do it well, it can be, I think pretty misleading. And misleading. I would rather have nothing than misleading. And unfortunately I think like Nenson tried to do the job, but they relied on a, on a incomplete address list, which makes it like inaccurate. And you know, like Alex from, from Nansen was tweeting about like how.
00:37:32.015 - 00:38:10.791, Speaker C: What was it? Bitwise flipping BlackRock, which is not remotely true. I think like BlackRock has more than double what they showcase here because they're missing more than half of the addresses. And yeah, it's just, it's just a bad look. It's not super good. I think Bitwise is having a crazy start, by the way, compared to the other ETFs, but it doesn't mean we should share stuff that is wrong. Especially since it's pretty easy to check that this doesn't match at all reported flows. And I don't know, I wish Ninson had better due diligence on this rather than sharing it.
00:38:10.791 - 00:38:34.011, Speaker C: All they have is this. And on the website there's this little barriers on the side. Bitwise is the only one who have disclosed all the addresses. So this is like easy together. The rest is more slothing work that takes a bit more. But having this little emoji that says like the address list is incomplete, kind of like it's not really, you know, super clear. And this isn't the first thing people see.
00:38:34.011 - 00:38:52.525, Speaker C: So I don't know, it's just for a product of this size of Nenson and the aura they have, it's not a great look. I think to showcase this as a somewhat official dashboard and tweet about it despite the information being clearly wrong and.
00:38:52.565 - 00:39:34.585, Speaker A: Not going back and actually correcting the information once called out. I think if you make mistakes and if you correct them after, like everyone makes mistakes, it's all right. But yeah, this was not a screenshot. The tweet is still live and it's like there is a data source out there. You can actually kind of go back or issue a correction statement or whatever. Yeah, not the standard we should have in this industry, but yeah, it is what it is. With that, let's switch gears a little bit and go to the other side of the market.
00:39:34.585 - 00:39:58.155, Speaker A: The fun side. Like this is all tri, like big money, whatever, laws, regulations. I mean laws and regulations also rather than this topic. But of course I'm talking about polymarket and I think first of all we need to say Dragonfly is an investor or like, yeah, Hildobe works at Dragonfly. Dragonfly is an investor in polymarket. Anything more we need to add?
00:39:58.975 - 00:40:01.879, Speaker C: No, we invested in their series B recently, earlier this year.
00:40:01.927 - 00:40:36.125, Speaker A: And with that let's switch gears a little bit and go to the kind of other side of the, of the bell curve of the market. Let's talk about Poly Market. I think first of all we need to say Dragonfly is an investor in Poly Market, so they recently invested in their Series B. So there is conflicts of interest here from Derby side. Neither, neither Denning or me have been angels or anything in Polymarket. So we, we are free to speak. But yeah, that just as a disclosure and yeah, it's been going really well for Polymarket.
00:40:36.125 - 00:41:19.895, Speaker A: We might actually have a breakout product from our crypto Twitter universe into the wider world. It's like the one that made it. I'm very proud. No stake or no affiliation, but yeah, I'm just very happy to report that Polymarket is actually doing, doing kind of well. And I think the best way to probably go through this is to first look at some high level metrics. So you guys have probably also seen this floating around on Twitter, but absolutely. Hockey stick charts for, for Polymarket, their recent or this month.
00:41:19.895 - 00:41:51.711, Speaker A: Wait, yeah, this month is pretty much over. So like this is actually a really good result. Like good time to record this podcast. They had $366 million in trading volume. And of course comparing that to Dex trading volume which is like in the billions, that's still nothing. But if you kind of like look through the progression of this chart, it's like they, they had 111 million in June and 60, only 63 million in, in May. And I think May might have been the last time we checked into this.
00:41:51.711 - 00:42:38.575, Speaker A: And it's like, yeah, 63 million in crypto, like that's kind of pocket change. It's like, it doesn't sound like too much, but yeah. Now in the month of July there was $366 million of trading volume. So that's really exciting. And with that of course there, there's been a huge growth in traders. So actually 42,000 people have traded in the month of July on polymarket, which is like I think for crypto user numbers, I think that's like maybe the highest number I've ever hear aside from like outdoor farming, whatever bullshit protocols, but like from like non, I guess like Uniswap and stuff. They also have like user numbers in that height or like 1 inch or like the kind of like Dex front ends.
00:42:38.575 - 00:42:53.671, Speaker A: But like for an app that's like it's not really defi. And it's like not like I don't think people are using Poly Market to airdrop farm like over like too much. So I think overall like this is really, really exciting.
00:42:53.823 - 00:43:45.311, Speaker C: I also think it's a, it's interesting. One of the things Polymarket is known for is more around politics and if you look at the volume it's going to be, it's matching. Like one of the spikes is in 2020 and the more recent spike is also heavily driven by politics. And there was a really interesting thread by I think Kyle Simani about how these prediction markets are almost more about having a like, I don't know how he calls it but like a sector to bet on that is continuous. So maybe like sports, something like this more than you know, fun little bets that are going to be every once in a while because you want to, you know, keep that volume. Yes, exactly. I recommend everyone to read this.
00:43:45.311 - 00:43:52.937, Speaker C: I think it's a really interesting read and interesting take on how this is just a different type of product that has this, these considerations.
00:43:53.041 - 00:45:00.751, Speaker A: Yeah, Kyle is basically saying here like what matters is regularity and if Polymarket turns out to be a FL in the flash in the pan of like ah, like the volume is going to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise until the election but then there's no stickiness and people are just going to leave again. Then you, you haven't built a sustainable product. Even though like in crypto it's like what is a sustainable product? Like what's the actual goal of like running a business? It's like Polymarket currently has zero fees. So like they're not earning like too much money on this but if they had fees they could actually like kind of like do the friend tech move where it's like ah, we're gonna like have five weeks of attention like earn like a gazillion like in fees and then we're just gonna like go off into the sunset. I, I don't quite know if that's like an accurate description of the Frantic saga, but like it kind of like from the outside kind of felt like that. But for that they also like, they also took VC money and like I, I don't understand any like, I like no, no shade thrown towards Frantic. It's just like that, that's like a good example of like some like a team that actually like earned a ton of fees in like a short amount of time.
00:45:00.751 - 00:45:35.873, Speaker A: And like even for like if that was like the whole outcome of Poly Market of like we're just going to make like $50 million in fees in the election markets and then like whatever happens afterwards, it's like, of course you want your business to be successful, but like, having earned $50 million is also pretty impressive. So like, maybe, yeah, maybe. Maybe we need to shift our thinking to more temporary companies or something like this. Even though, like, this doesn't make any sense. Like, you want economic security and like, you want that for like, quite some time. You don't want to like, I don't know, like work at new companies all the time. But that's.
00:45:35.873 - 00:46:02.571, Speaker A: I. I think I went to some weird, weird like, philosophy figure. But. So I think the, the polymarket story, as Dobby rightly pointed out, is like very much driven by, by the US Election and like all the, all the drama that's going on in between there, which is like, ah, like, is Joe Biden gonna. Like, this is an actual like really dramatic kind of U.S. election. So like, I think polymarket is kind of like perfect.
00:46:02.571 - 00:46:27.147, Speaker A: Like this is like a perfect like combination of things where it's like in 2016, was that like the Hillary Trump. Well, I don't know. Maybe it was 2020. Like, I like, I think Hillary Trump was like, that was like also an exciting like, election thing. And like there was like a lot of shakeups. But like, I think the drama like, of this one is like unmatched. Like there was like a literal assassination attempt.
00:46:27.147 - 00:47:02.745, Speaker A: Like, can you guys imagine? And like two weeks later, nobody's talking about it anybody. It's like, oh, like this is just like some little small side story. It's like insane. So like, I like, it just feels like a perfect combination of like everyone is super online. Actually that Twitter is kind of like freed from censorship is actually like a huge or like X is also a huge part of the story where it's like news kind of get first populated through X and poly markets. And it's like the more kind of traditional media is kind of lagging behind. And of course they have their reasons for lagging behind.
00:47:02.745 - 00:47:34.273, Speaker A: They actually need to verify the sources. But it kind of feels like that method of media is no longer as relevant than this 24.7information Thunderdome that we're all living in. So I don't know, there's a bunch of factors that come together here and maybe to share some of the most recent updates, polymarket has integrated. Has released an integration with Substack, which I thought was like, kind of interesting. I had not heard about this on, on Twitter or anything.
00:47:34.369 - 00:47:46.485, Speaker B: When Biden drop out and there's this new candidate which is, I think Kamala. And then how does the prediction market change? Are you able to add an option there or you have to start a new market.
00:47:47.355 - 00:47:59.299, Speaker C: I think there's a bunch of candidates for the election thing. There's. It's not just a binary one. Yeah, I don't remember Michelle Obama and stuff like this. Yeah, it's probably. She wasn't. I'm not sure.
00:47:59.387 - 00:48:15.753, Speaker A: I think all of these basically work as like 01 binary options. So Trump win, Trump not win. And then like that's an isolated market. And then Biden, Biden win Biden. Notwin is an isolated market. Kamala win. Kamala not when it's an isolated market.
00:48:15.753 - 00:49:18.705, Speaker A: And then people just arbitrage between the different markets because otherwise you have like this multi sided, whatever like weird convoluted thing and like you can't add things like going back and it's like, I think like pretty much it's always like yes, no questions. And then they also like they, they used to have multi side market but I think they decided against it because like the market making in those and like the overhead complexity like gets just gets like super high. So like everything they like everything that I see on polymarket and I think what's most relevant is their central limit order book. So like it's basically like just an order book like on a centralized exchange and there's people who submit asks and bids and that's how the markets get made. And it's like for each individual like option of like who wins the Republican nominee or whatever, I mean that's done now. But who, who becomes president, it's like there's literally like 10 different order books for like who might be the winner.
00:49:20.285 - 00:49:41.489, Speaker C: So yeah, there, there are some more than binary markets. So I shared one here. But it's, it's like there's a. So Democratic nominee, 20, 24 and there's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There's a bunch of options. I probably have 10, including Joe Biden, that's now under 1%. There's Kamala, now is 97.
00:49:41.489 - 00:49:50.033, Speaker C: But there's Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and stuff like this. So there isn't just binary markets, but I think binary. Yeah. So.
00:49:50.169 - 00:50:09.227, Speaker A: Oh, but that's what I'm saying. Like all of these, like if you like these are all isolated order books. So like they're like this is a, this is like one larger category. But these are all like, that's why the price is like if this was like a perfectly efficient market, the. I mean the chances do kind of add up.
00:50:09.411 - 00:50:13.995, Speaker C: Yeah, they make up to 100%. So maybe they are isolated no, this.
00:50:14.035 - 00:50:49.917, Speaker A: Actually doesn't add up to 100%, but that's just like order book inefficiency as well. But like all like, if you go here you get like an order book and then if you go here you also get an order book. And those order books are not the same. So like you always bet yes or no on individual options. So like, it's, it's just like there's like one kind of outcome that you bet on which is kind like, it's kind of like a decision tree thing where it's like all of this gets resolved by the same like, overarching question. But then the order, like if you want to trade the individual outcomes, they're all like, separate.
00:50:49.981 - 00:51:04.681, Speaker C: Okay, I thought, I thought like, you know, if I bet big on like Joe Biden right now wouldn't affect like decreasing Kamala's chance on this as well, despite it being like separate markets. My guess is that's the case.
00:51:04.873 - 00:51:55.835, Speaker A: Even here there's just a bunch of individual markets. You can even like this market even has an option of like other Democrat politicians, which is like, that's kind of ridiculous. Or Kanye, of course. But all of these are like, if, if I trade the Donald Trump option today and I like, let's say I move the order book like up to like 70 cents. Like, I, I just buy like how many, like 2, 3 million worth of like Trump wins. This has no effect whatsoever on the, on the Harris chances. And like, what will, what will probably happen is that there's bots running and they're basically like doing the arbitrage of like now there's a risk free bet to be had to bet on Camela because like, like, I don't know, some like, mathematics.
00:51:55.835 - 00:52:32.415, Speaker A: Yeah, some mathematics. Very eloquently put. But like, there's like a, I think you, you can like reasonably make the assumption that like market makers or arbitrage bots or whatever can then profit of it. But it's all, it's all individual markets. So, so there's kind of an internal price of like Trump will win is currently the odds are priced at 60 to kind of 40. But like, currently the market is not efficient, so it's 41. So that's always like, like in defi.
00:52:32.415 - 00:53:11.001, Speaker A: We went to AMMS because we didn't have on chain market makers. And like now we're back in like, okay, we actually have to like have market makers. And the central limit order books are not the most like, they are like very good at matching trades. But like, it's like not the best at finding prices always. Sometimes there's like giant spreads in the order books where like the sum of both outcomes will literally be like 150 or something. And you're just sitting there like, huh, like how does this make sense? So there's still like on like the far edges of Polymarket, there's still like market inefficiencies I guess, but I think these markets are actually getting quite efficient and working quite well.
00:53:11.073 - 00:53:45.565, Speaker C: One of the cool things is this is one of the very first websites, apps or whatever that I have normie friends talking about that you don't necessarily know that crypto is in the hood. You don't need to know, it doesn't really matter. But I think that's kind of cool as one of the first few showcases that you know, we, we break the, the wall of like crypto native people into broader markets. And yeah, I'm, I'm, I wish, I hope to see more and more of these kind of apps over time.
00:53:46.145 - 00:54:40.023, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think it's super exciting as well. And I think like in this information environment I think they've like perfectly like all the odds kind of align for, for them to succeed in the moment and now they've even like. What I wanted to talk about earlier is like they've integrated like a substack integration or like they have worked on integration with substack. So basically now you can, in your substack articles you can embed polymarket odds. So like this makes it easier for like the kind of like old school political pundits to like work with a polymarket. They can literally just drop this embed in here and I would think it's just like posting the link and then this automatically converts into an embed. While personally I'm no longer a fan of substack, it's still cool to see this integrating with such a kind of large media organization in Web2.
00:54:40.023 - 00:55:51.445, Speaker A: And I think it's just going to kind of this has network effects and the more integrations you get and the wider the reach gets, the better it is for, I don't know, for Polymarket. And actually if you think about the market structure of betting, it's like huge, huge network effects where it's like if the order book is deeper, like the price algorithms are going to be smoother and it's like you're more like more people are more likely to actually venture into other things. So like this is going to be a winner takes most or winner takes all market in my opinion. Until we get to like a reach where it's like you as a company can just like do the matchmaking or whatever. And I don't know how, like how would this work for like sports betting? Like who does the order book there? I don't but that's like I, I think for like the first couple, like I don't know until probably a certain size this, this becomes a winner, takes most market and then like if the market opportunity becomes big enough, then it's like the big players kind of like probably encroach on that and it's like they maybe might be able to split it up again. But what do I know? It's actually quite a hard prediction to make.
00:55:51.605 - 00:56:41.179, Speaker C: It kind of replaces polls data like all data from previous polls that may have like, you know, errors due to sample size. That's just limited. This probably represents like a wider, like a better representation of overall market since anyone can participate without much limits. And yeah, it's just, it's just, I think it probably makes sense as a eventual replacement to polls data. You could still have polls more for narrow markets. Okay, what is this city or what is this view from? I don't know in New York? What are they thinking over there? What are they thinking? Different sample sizes but on a representation like representing the whole, the aggregated view I think is probably, this is probably a good way to.
00:56:41.297 - 00:57:25.973, Speaker A: And yeah, polymarket has made some like pretty high profile hires and they also just recently announced like in May they announced a Series B with support by Founders Fund. So that's Peter Thiel's investment vehicle. And it's actually like Peter Thiel has his fingers in the US election. It's kind of interesting. He's like invested in polymarkets and Founders Fund and I think JD Vance has like very close or like kind of close connections to Peter Thiel. So that, that's going to be kind of interesting that he's a, he's a man in the background kind of pulling strings. Something unusual about the Poly Market race was probably that they also at the same time disclosed an un like under previously undisclosed Series A.
00:57:25.973 - 00:58:08.085, Speaker A: So like they announced Series A and Series B in May OR Series B, 45 million funding. Series A, 25 million funding. So like they're, they're like very well equipped to, to take, to take care of this opportunity. And like I wonder if they, they probably can't do advertisements in the US on a large scale because of some regulatory things, sadly. Otherwise it would be, it would be insane to drop like a bunch of advertisements advertisement Money into kind of the mainstream culture and try to onboard a lot of normies to Poly Market. But yeah, lots of exciting stuff cooking on their side. UMA also recently.
00:58:08.085 - 00:58:12.865, Speaker A: So the way Poly markets resolve. Do you guys know?
00:58:14.325 - 00:58:14.685, Speaker C: No.
00:58:14.725 - 00:59:20.765, Speaker A: Please inform us. So there's this problem of what is the actual truth of resolving a market. So if some, like, what's the best example to pick here? I guess just like, if the US President is elected and like in the last election we actually had like, I don't know, January 6th happened afterwards. So like it was kind of unclear if like, is this the actual result or like, is this not the result? And of course like most people just like were like, okay, like whatever the government says are the actual results. But like, if there is a dispute, and let's just say for argument's sake, it's like you could actually officially depute the US government's kind of election counting from the last election, then this goes to uma. UMA is a kind of decentralized truth provider. They're kind of like, if you remember back in the Eigenlayer episode, it was like we have intersubjective truths.
00:59:20.765 - 00:59:59.215, Speaker A: They try to kind of resolve those kinds of things where it's like you can have multiple perspectives on it, but in the end there's like one true outcome. So like, polymarket historically has had a lot of markets which were like, not cleanly defined. So like the UMA people had a lot of trouble with this actually. But I think now there's like more creation happening. It was just like not clearly worded. What is the actual like, outcome? I think like, I remember there was like a big controversy about like there was this like the U boat that went to the Titanic. Like that market was like, somebody just spun that up and like, I don't know, he just typed some shit in there.
00:59:59.215 - 01:00:47.195, Speaker A: And then I think it was unclear, like the method of how they died or something. And it's like, then like there was like a lot of disputes and like, finally somebody has to make the decision of like, who actually like resolves the market to true or false. And that in Polymarket's cases, UMA is a kind of like independent third party. Yeah, very kind of interesting. And like, I, I think that's like Poly Market, like not doing that themselves is probably a good thing because like it, it like, I don't know, it has like more of a vibe of neutrality and it's like independent, very and independently verifiable and stuff like that. And I think if you want to Dispute something. You also need to put up a bond and like there's like a whole like economic game theory.
01:00:47.195 - 01:01:26.545, Speaker A: Uma is a long blog post. We're going to link it under the article. If anyone wants to actually read into this. I am certainly not the expert. I just think the whole structure of Polymarket and how it actually the inner workings are fascinating and these people have worked on this for a long time for us to now enjoy, I guess for the world to enjoy the fruits of their labor and to close this out. There's of course more dashboards on Dune. What we looked at at the beginning was Richard Chen, who of course with his like very simple dashboard, but it, it breaks down the gist of Poly Market.
01:01:26.545 - 01:02:11.335, Speaker A: But what I've also brought with me is a dashboard from Cryptocoryo and cryptocoryo in general, like prolific Dune wizard. And he's actually taking like the whole sector or like the whole sector. I'm saying like he's, he's combined the data of both Azuro and Poly Market. And what's interesting about Azero is that they're actually trying to make their. I think it's more of like European thing and they're, they're really going into the football niche. So if you were to see the screen today, you could see that they regularly have football matches with, with over 1 million of volume traded. And I think Azuro is on gnosis or like at least last time I checked they were on gnosis.
01:02:11.335 - 01:02:54.205, Speaker A: So like they're trying to make this recurring thing that Kyle is talking about. And I think Polymarket is also like they have like a Twitter account which is like Polymarket Sports. But like so far nobody has really bitten. So like I think this will be interesting to watch in terms of like, okay, can like, does Azur just take the sports betting angle? Like are they maybe the more like natives in that area and Polymarket is going to take the election or like the more political things. But again there probably is network effect. So like if Polymarket gets their product right in terms of like also offering sports betting or like a better experience for sports betting, they already have it today. But like probably not the, probably not what people want yet.
01:02:54.205 - 01:03:47.595, Speaker A: But yeah, recently Polymarket has really, really dominated just because of the election. If you were to exclude the election markets, this probably looks a lot more like. Even so what we're looking at is share of prediction market users. And you can see that until maybe April, Yeah probably like April 2024, it was pretty much a 50, 50 split between Polymarket and Azuro, but now it's like 95%, 97% Polymarket. So you can really see that Polymarket has a huge, huge new influx of users and their user growth numbers are just insane. And then I think down here somewhere we also have total value locked in both of these platforms. There we go.
01:03:48.345 - 01:03:55.433, Speaker B: It would be cool to break down the user by the markets they participate and so we know if it's fully just election.
01:03:55.609 - 01:04:21.019, Speaker A: Yeah, the problem, I think you can probably do this. Korea has done this for individual markets here and individual categories, but there's no kind of bar chart that stacks all of them up. But that would indeed be super interesting research to see this much is spent on. I think polymarket has these couple. Do I still have a polymarket tab? Nope.
01:04:21.107 - 01:04:34.975, Speaker C: I think the market metadata is off chain and this requires constant like querying for new markets. So it's just a, it's a bit of annoying to maintain and instead of a. So not easy to make a dashboard out of.
01:04:36.155 - 01:05:00.041, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, you can just query the API though. So it's not too hard. But yeah, it's a bit of added friction definitely. And yeah, if we look at the TVL, Poly Market now sits at something like 80 million and Azura only has 7 million. It's like pretty stagnant since January 2024. So yeah, it's really.
01:05:00.041 - 01:05:56.721, Speaker A: This dashboard really tells the story of the growth of Poly Market and the not growth of Azero, sadly. And it's like. But I think Azur is still probably in a good position to like in general like kind of capture some of this like newfound attention for decentralized, decentralized betting marketplaces. So yeah, I think this is going to be really interesting and I think if you compare open interest to tvl. So Richard has a open interest chart which is something like 73 million and then the TVL that's just sitting, sitting in Polymarket is also something like 70 million. So there's a lot of kind of like potential if, like, if people like I always have money on Poly Market just in case something happens. So like I think like the closer we get to like, I think the event frequency is probably not going to decrease from here, but rather increase.
01:05:56.721 - 01:06:54.819, Speaker A: So like I think the, I think the, the future looks bright for fall Polymarket. This is going to be a very kind of interesting election as they always kind of tend to be in the US somehow. It's always a good theater to look over from Europe and be like, what the hell is happening over there? So yeah, I'm excited I think this is really exciting data for crypto adoption. And of course part of this is like polymarket doesn't really feel like crypto that much. It's like you can actually log in with I think Google and like charge your account with a credit card and like they've really like, they've built like a cool exodia. Like, are you familiar with Exodia, like the YU concept of like you need to have five cards and then you can combine them. It's like they're running on like an old fork of saves to basically like kind of emulate smart accounts.
01:06:54.819 - 01:07:20.991, Speaker A: So like the, the user like UX of Poly Market is not very like crypto. You don't need to approve tokens, you don't need to do any of this stuff. It's like, no, like you, you bet on outcomes. It's like normies can really easily understand this. So like I, yeah, just kudos to that team. It's like really cool to finally see a crypto consumer application where it's not like, oh yeah, they're trying to find pmf. No, like polymarket has found pmf.
01:07:21.063 - 01:07:41.887, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I think that's probably like the end goal is to not look like, like when you're on your browser, do you really care, like what the stack is behind the website? You're, you know, it doesn't really matter at all. And it's the same as like crypto is probably not thought of right now in this way, but I think it's evolving and yeah, I'd like to see this evolution continue.
01:07:42.071 - 01:07:46.063, Speaker B: It's not available for us. Right? Poly Market.
01:07:46.119 - 01:08:03.625, Speaker A: Yeah, we had this, we had this in a pre episode actually where we're like, did I like somebody actually tried to log in with a VPN or something? Or maybe this was off camera. But yeah, as a US citizen, you are not allowed to use Polygon. They had to settle with the cftc.
01:08:04.205 - 01:08:06.505, Speaker C: Wait, Polygon or Polygon?
01:08:07.125 - 01:08:33.311, Speaker A: Poly Markets. Okay, yeah, sorry, yeah, they were fined by the CFTC before, but they're banning, they're banning you from trading Denning. So it's legal now. The employees in the US are safe. It's like they're probably also banning the major proxy providers, but beyond that I, I'd be surprised if they, if they go any further. Shout out.
01:08:33.343 - 01:08:33.915, Speaker C: Gary.
01:08:34.735 - 01:08:39.799, Speaker A: Yeah, you did. No, this was not Gary. This was the C. Ctfc. Whatever.
01:08:39.847 - 01:08:41.574, Speaker C: Oh, cf. Oh, my bad. CFT here.
01:08:41.694 - 01:09:36.559, Speaker B: Yeah, well, before we move away from this topic, I want. Have you guys seen the recent like Bitcoin 2024 conference last week, just a few days ago where Trump was. I'm curious about what you guys take on, like if Trump actually going to win the election or what's the general, you know, like the different parties leaning on crypto and what's your take? We don't need to go too deep. But like last week in the conference, Trump was like promising a bunch of things like he going to fire Gary Gensler, he going to promise that the bitcoin held by the US government will not be sold at all. And he going to say like bitcoin going to go to the moon somehow. And like he promised there will be no CBDC from the government. I don't know, it seems like the Trump side is very pro crypto.
01:09:36.559 - 01:10:02.117, Speaker B: And I saw actually also a few weeks ago Misari CEO stepped down. I think he's a very radical like Republican advocate. And so it kind of makes sense that the data company in particular, like a data research company should not have any political leaning. And it seems like the political standing or like if they're pro crypto or not is affecting the whole industry right now a lot.
01:10:02.301 - 01:10:53.421, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean we've had like in crypto this problem of the US government being kind of like anti crypto for a while and I guess Trump is the first that's trying to change this. And honestly like politics wise, I'm like super uninformed and not even remote. Like I'm concerned I guess in some way because I work for a US company and everything. But I live here in France. I'm not the most informed or the most concerned, like I said. But it's nice to see at least a party changing its opinion and hopefully changing things as a whole on the crypto side. But I also agree with a recent article from Vitalik that your candidates view on crypto shouldn't affect your whole vote.
01:10:53.421 - 01:11:02.949, Speaker C: Like it's just part of the, just part of the situation. But it's, you know, you should take the hole and what, what happens overall? What are his political, political biases?
01:11:03.037 - 01:11:29.295, Speaker A: You can't understate how much this affects like the entire crypto industry. Just because there's like so many important, like all the important companies are basically US companies. Like of course Europe has no innovation, we all know that. So sadly, sadly, this is the bottle caps. Yeah, it's like I always like, I think defi is entirely happening in New York. Basically. It's like whoever you talk to say oh yeah, we based in New York, whatever.
01:11:29.295 - 01:12:16.965, Speaker A: So like I think like having a US administration that would actually be favorable towards crypto would be great. Or the other thing. Like I think like Trump ended his speech with something like have fun with your crypto and NFTs and whatever else you're playing with. And like this like playing with is like very indicative of like the level of seriousness that he like considers crypto with. And I think it's just like I read some take that he's just like yeah, he's just like a populist and he's like, he's found like that this industry is like throwing a lot of money after him. They very influential. It's like one of the kind of wedge issues where it's like ah, like this could like decide someone like this could like tilt someone towards like voting Democrat or voting Republican.
01:12:16.965 - 01:13:08.009, Speaker A: So like yeah, he's kind of like, I guess he's catering towards the crypto industry because he has self interest. But like if anything Trump is a businessman and like a business. Like, but that might not, that doesn't have to be a bad thing if like he actually like follows like if he just stops harassing the crypto industry for God's sake like then we're fine like that. Like we just do nothing and like we're, we're like we're going to the moon. Like it's going to be amazing. Like the way like the, how, how like extreme the US government is at its current like, I don't know level of incompetence of dealing with this like new emerging industry that could actually like help them establish like US dollar hegemony across the entire world is like insane. So like, like yeah, it would be good for the crypto industry.
01:13:08.009 - 01:13:44.895, Speaker A: Like do I think that Trump has some other problems? Probably. But like I don't know. I work here. It's like I think, I think it's not like I actually think the, the like metallic post of like ah, like you shouldn't just vote but like dude, my entire life depends on this. Like my livelihood, my career, my, like if we stomp like of course I have transferable skills and like, like I, I'm probably gonna be fine. But like I think this technology is exciting. I think this is important and if we can keep building with this thing to accelerate the world, I think that would be great for all of us.
01:13:45.795 - 01:14:13.533, Speaker B: I think that's not great because that makes you a single issue voter. But it's okay. None of us here has a vote. I agree with you in general. Politician really is trust, like trustworthy and like they, they're probably just being opportunistic. I saw like the Democrats party also, you know, starting trying to appeal to the crypto side and it's all about just like the leverage from the industry with the funding.
01:14:13.589 - 01:14:51.701, Speaker C: So yeah, the, the two reasons Trump is probably so pro crypto right now is he, he benefited from it like in, in two ways. One, he extracted value from donations, but also like the NFT grift he released like a, like a year or two ago and, and then polymarket is like, like it shows him favorably. So he's been using it a lot to like showcase his like stats of like Paul's equivalent, I guess. But I think that's the main reason he, he was able to, you know, profit from this industry as well and he sees the benefits he can reap.
01:14:51.783 - 01:15:19.567, Speaker A: Yeah. Which like he's a businessman, he profits from something, he likes it. Like, I think that's, I think that's a totally like, it seems to me almost more honest than whatever the Democrats are pulling now of like, oh, like we don't actually hate you guys. Come back. Like we, like, we, we didn't mean to like, I don't know, prosecute you for the last four years and put all the possible boulders into your way that you could, you could have. It's like, oh no, this was just an accident. Like we, we have a misunderstanding here.
01:15:19.567 - 01:15:42.959, Speaker A: It's like, guys, I, yeah, so like we are. We, we shall, we shall see what. And like within recent developments and like now Camela is the other. Like, I, I think the US election is not as clear cut or like from my perspective and like pol, what polymarket says as well, it's like no longer as clear cut as it, as it, as it once was.
01:15:43.047 - 01:16:03.233, Speaker C: I mean they've clearly heard like, like the BUSD situation for example is pretty crazy how it was like the dominant stable coin on binance and everything and basically it got shut down and then once it no longer existed, it's like, actually we're good. I don't know. It's kind of weird and yeah, obviously.
01:16:03.289 - 01:16:14.645, Speaker A: Not great, but yeah, so much for our political expertise. We promise we're not going to turn into politics podcast like every other crypto podcast looking at you chopping block guys.
01:16:15.425 - 01:16:16.205, Speaker C: Whoa.
01:16:16.865 - 01:16:45.911, Speaker A: I mean they've really become a crazy crypto politics podcast at this point. But I, I enjoy it. I, I don't think it's, I don't think it's boring, but like that's what moves the industry at the moment. So like, I think it's totally fair for Anyone to basically like talk about this. I think like, people are like, oh, like, why are you turning into like this is important for the industry. Like, you should allow, like, I don't know for like the future of the industry. If you're like only tech, then you're not listening to chopping block anyway.
01:16:45.911 - 01:16:48.643, Speaker A: So like what? Like, stop laughing. Like, this is.
01:16:48.699 - 01:16:51.235, Speaker C: They're also all US citizens, unlike us.
01:16:51.395 - 01:17:08.555, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But by proxy, we are all affected by the US like, oh yeah, who's gonna pay for my defense budget here in Germany? You know, we can't afford this ourselves. That's our, that's our excursion into. Into politics.
01:17:08.635 - 01:17:12.081, Speaker B: Should we quickly talk about EIC02?
01:17:12.243 - 01:17:52.995, Speaker C: So there was this initiative started to make a quarterly review, a quarterly journal which encompasses kind of what happened recently in the crypto industry, mostly around ethereum and its L2s and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. There was the first edition earlier this year and the second edition just released. So you're free to go ahead and read it. The main story is about Bitwise and yeah, I think it's an interesting read. It's all for free. You're available for everyone if you want to support. You can also mint a token that allows you to redeem the physical version.
01:17:52.995 - 01:18:29.615, Speaker C: But yeah, overall super cool thing. I've started to help them by curating all the charts. So all the charts at the end have been created by me and I'll keep doing this for the following editions. But yeah, I think if you want to have a quick look into Ethereum, what is going on, but also maybe present it to some of your relatives or stuff like this. This is probably a good intro piece. So here are some of the contributors. You've got Andrew, you got Hong Kim, of course from Bitwise, a bunch of others, Joke, race, whatever, a bunch of other cool people who wrote some articles in here.
01:18:29.615 - 01:18:53.375, Speaker C: Here are some of the people who minted the Founder Edition. So kind of supporting the. The project Content, the editors. And yeah, you've got a bunch of stories. They range from quite a few. There's quite a few different things. So maybe only a few are in your interest, but there probably is at least one that you will find interesting in some way.
01:18:53.375 - 01:19:03.699, Speaker C: So yeah, please, please scroll through. It's 156 pages, so I'm not going to showcase all of them, but yeah, there's plenty of comment in here. Content.
01:19:03.787 - 01:19:51.759, Speaker A: Yeah, this is very cool. Basically a quarterly report for Ethereum akin to a company quarter. Yeah, we're going back to quarterly reports, even Though the Revolution will not be reported quarterly, as we all know. But the revolution is reported live and in color. But sometimes it helps to just like look back at the, at a quarter and I think to just like frame this a bit more. This is hosted by Lemonade Eth and he just like asks literally anyone or like not anyone, but like major kind of like Personas in the ETH ecosystem to write an article. So it's a really nice collection of like different perspectives and different kind of like angles and different expertises.
01:19:51.759 - 01:20:06.055, Speaker A: So I think this is a really cool initiative and he actually asked me to write for the first eic, but I don't know, I was busy or something. Should have done it, but it is what it is.
01:20:07.595 - 01:20:20.655, Speaker C: If anyone has anything interesting to write in here, please reach out. If there's any comment, anything on the data side as well, please reach out to me and let me know any feedback. If there's anything I should have included or should have removed or whatever, please tell me.
01:20:21.405 - 01:20:45.145, Speaker A: Yeah, we have the resident data editor for EIC Quarterly here now. That's pretty cool. I think in the next couple of weeks we're going to say goodbye to our local Frenchman. He's of course going to be off the entire month of August. So Danning and me. So Danning and me are going to do a deep dive into mev. Denning, do you want to give a few spoilers here?
01:20:46.045 - 01:21:36.847, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, I'll just like tease a little bit. So we lined up for the next episode to interview a PhD researcher who I recently published the paper with to describe basically our findings and like the summary of what's currently going on in the Ethereum block building market or like the block builder. And this is such a deep rabbit hole. It's like you have to basically explain what is mev, what is PBS and all these like in protocol, out of protocol. We have been avoiding touching any of this topic in the past. And so now that Dobby is gone, we need some data topics. So we decided to, we decided to start it to, you know, like talk about this, this whole thing and I, I'm thinking that we can interview a bunch of like really good data wizards in the space, like Tony from Ethereum Foundation Data always.
01:21:36.847 - 01:22:32.445, Speaker B: They all had like a lot of interesting research post about like what's the latency and what's the timing game happening in the validator side and everything. And it matters to everyone because you know, that's how 95% of transactions on Ethereum being settled. So any user on Ethereum, you're affected about this like so just like a quick tease about what this paper started with. So this data website might be a good way to showcase what we're like looking into. Like for example I found out about this website from Payload De a while ago and they did a good job about visualizing all these off chain data. Also these are all the block bidding data that is not living on chain and lives in a public data API called relay data API here. What they did is that they visualized within every block 12 second slot.
01:22:32.445 - 01:23:30.155, Speaker B: How did each block builders bids for the next block raise up from a very lower value to a much higher value over time when they accumulate more and more transaction in the mempool and potentially doing a lot of strategic thing where they inserted some searcher transactions. They might be organizing some CEFI defi app in the top of the block. They might be exposing their current block end of state to some searcher to insert some end of the block backgrounding, et cetera. And so I looked into some of their data and they did another interesting view where they kind of break down into each blog about the order flow composition. So they kind of labeled out all the transaction by their category say oh this is a Dex transaction. This is just a random token transfer, this is an ETH transfer, this might be some other transaction. This red one is I think bridge.
01:23:30.155 - 01:24:28.503, Speaker B: And when you like click into like enough number of blocks you would notice like some trend already like on the top of the block. It's always some Dex transaction or MEV transaction because that matters a lot because they want to be accessing the prices that they saw in the last block as fast as possible. And so they can potentially do app charge across binance and stuff. So with this we were inspired and we wanted to do some very comprehensive labeling across all the Ethereum transaction order flow. And this was like host system how we label stuff and honorable shout out is that we had a lot of data sets used created by Hidobe. So you got shouted out in the academic papers now. But yeah, I think maybe a quick show of one key chart here is that if you actually now categorize all the transactions on Ethereum, the left one is by the MEV value.
01:24:28.503 - 01:25:04.295, Speaker B: So basically like gas priority fee they pay and also the tip they pay to builder on the right side is the gas they use. So on the right side it's more like basically block space and you would see like there's a lot of like 2080 rule here happening. Like for example the biggest one that right now is like Making up the MEV value is actually telegram bots. It's not, it's not exactly an MEV transaction. It's just telegram bot user paying super high gas fee trying to like snipe meme coin and like trade a coin and they actually like when you look at the block. Yeah.
01:25:05.715 - 01:25:15.325, Speaker A: Is this due to the telegram bots configuration or is this a user kind of like people just unnecessarily paying too much fees for the telegram bots?
01:25:15.485 - 01:26:14.955, Speaker B: I would say the latter because the user doesn't even configure how much gas fee they pay. It's the telegram bots decide like okay, we are going to pay this much to put the transaction on top of block and in the next very block and you will see actually out of all the Ethereum transactions or the block over 20% at peak almost 30% value are contributed as by just telegram bots user and like they actually make up like very small amount of transactions compared to the retail swap or other public transactions. Particularly something also interesting like sandwiching transactions. They paying a lot to the proposers. They pay around like 20% of all the MEV value proposal received but here it's like less than what 2% or 1% in terms of like how much block space they take up. Yeah, there's a lot more interesting findings but I'll leave it to my co author to do the presentation next time. So I'm excited to start to talk about mev.
01:26:14.995 - 01:26:27.855, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we're not just a bunch of nerds talking shit. We actually have credentials sometimes comes in here with like a 30 page academic paper. It's like okay, okay, that's pretty serious.
01:26:31.015 - 01:26:45.911, Speaker B: Shout out is to like all the DUNE wizards and like we were like my co author like he was like how, how do I put a DUNE link in my like like all the article references and it's the new norm. Like so many charts and DUNE links there.
01:26:45.983 - 01:27:20.849, Speaker A: Yeah. We'll see you in the next episode. To dive deep into MEV data and if this topic scares you, I am also not really familiar. So I'll be asking all the stupid questions on, on all of our listeners behalf. So we all understand whatever PBS and MEV and, and SPB and like all of these like nice, nice acronyms that nobody is able to follow anymore. I think we're going to say goodbye to Hildobi until September. You're going to listen to me and Denning rave about MEV data and I don't have any clue about MEV data either.
01:27:20.849 - 01:27:38.585, Speaker A: So I'm going to be the stupid guy in this podcast and ask all the questions to make sure that our listeners are not lost in PBS and MEV and whatever else acronyms we can come up with. But yeah, thanks for listening to the Index podcast and see you guys along.
