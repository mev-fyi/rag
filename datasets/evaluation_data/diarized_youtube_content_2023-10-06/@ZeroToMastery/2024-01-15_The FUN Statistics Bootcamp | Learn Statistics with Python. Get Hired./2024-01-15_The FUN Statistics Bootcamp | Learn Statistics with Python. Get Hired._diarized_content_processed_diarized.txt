00:00:01.200 - 00:01:08.130, Speaker A: When you start to pay attention to what's going on around you, you see that statistics is important for everything. I'm going to guide you through the fundamentals of statistical analysis, using Python to learn the beginner concepts but also to build real world applications. And you don't need any prior programming knowledge to get started. This isn't like statistics in school, and I promise you that statistics doesn't have to be boring either. That's because you're going to use the Python skills you learned to build six fun projects that use statistics, such as a virtual escape room where players use statistical pattern recognition to progress through puzzles, use inferential statistics to unravel the mysteries of the box office performance for movies, and even use the logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic sinking. Using the famous Titanic dataset, you're quickly going to appreciate the power and simplicity of statistics with Python. I'm sure that welcome to my bootcamp course on statistics with python.
00:01:08.130 - 00:01:09.230, Speaker A: I'll see you inside.
