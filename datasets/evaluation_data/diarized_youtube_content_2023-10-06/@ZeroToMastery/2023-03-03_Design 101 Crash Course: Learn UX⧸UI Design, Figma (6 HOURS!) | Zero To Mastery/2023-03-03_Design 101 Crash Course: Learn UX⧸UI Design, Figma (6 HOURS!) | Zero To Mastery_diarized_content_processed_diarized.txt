00:00:04.200 - 00:00:31.798, Speaker A: Have you been bouncing between design tutorials and disappointed by what you're finding? Yeah, I don't blame you. But I'm glad you landed here because I can assure you that those days are over. You just landed on the best damn design crash course you're gonna find on YouTube. Bold statement. I know. So let me explain. Reason number one, you're getting to learn from Daniel Schiafano, who has been a product designer for almost ten years and has led design for major vc backed companies.
00:00:31.798 - 00:01:21.194, Speaker A: Reason number two, this crash course doesnt just scratch the surface. It covers some of the key skills and topics that you need to know to become a professional designer. Topics like how to use figma from scratch, sketching, user flows, sitemaps, wireframes, plus expert tips, tricks and advice that you can only get from someone that has years of experience in the industry. Reason number three, most people are paying for the content that youre about to watch. This crash course is part of Daniels complete web and mobile design boot camp course, which is actually one of the highest rated design courses online and has been taken by over 100,000 students. His bootcamp takes people from complete beginners to getting hired as full time designers. So if you like this crash course and want to keep diving deeper, then we highly recommend checking that out.
00:01:21.194 - 00:01:29.910, Speaker A: It's worth every penny and more, but that's enough chit chat for me. Let me hand it over to Dan so you can see exactly what I'm talking about. Enjoy.
00:01:39.110 - 00:02:13.140, Speaker B: Guess what? You have just found your first client. And this guy, his name is Bruno, he has a huge idea. They're going to create a new product to take on Amazon. You see, shopping on Amazon isn't the best. I mean, sure, you can find lots of stuff, but the whole experience, design, there's room for improvement. And Bruno, that works at Keiko Corp. One of the fastest growing tech companies in the world, well, he wants to take on Amazon and build their own shopping experience.
00:02:13.140 - 00:03:20.172, Speaker B: And they found you as a designer to lead the charge to design their product, their mobile and web presence to take on Amazon. Now, this is the first part of any design project that you may have. It's this idea of meeting the client. You meet someone that needs your expertise, but you're taking this course because you're starting from scratch or you already have some knowledge and you want to improve upon it. Now, because everyone has different skill levels with this course, we're going to assume you have already met the client and you're starting to work right away, just like we have with Bruno at the end of the course, we have some extra bits for you to show you how you may find and get your first clients. But we also want to start with the actual practical designer things to get started on the course, because I know you're getting excited to learn. So the first step that we're going to take is to learn the skills and have that dream portfolio by the end of this course.
00:03:20.172 - 00:04:11.190, Speaker B: So we're going to start designing the product that Bruno wants and eventually have a finished design system and portfolio. So that when we come back to this idea of meeting a client, you already have the portfolio and the skill set needed to start looking for your first clients, whether it's on a freelance website or just an existing client. Hooray. But here's a quick thing to get you started. When meeting a client, the whole thing is about solving their problems. When you meet a client, can you solve their problems? Are you the person that can take what they say and wow them? Are you the expert that they have been looking for all along? You see, people want somebody that makes their life easier, not harder. By the way, you might be wondering something.
00:04:11.190 - 00:05:30.360, Speaker B: Why are we saying product designer here? Isn't this a web and mobile designer course? Well, yeah, it is. But the idea of design and designing, as we're going to find out throughout the course, isn't necessarily just about the web or just about mobile. Our technology is constantly evolving. There's new platforms coming out all the time, and a designer should be flexible. Sure, we can just learn web development, but then what happens if we want to build a mobile app or a VR app or any sort of product that can be on any platform? So we want to describe this course as a product designer because you can design on any platform for any product. So although we might use web design, mobile design, product design as a term, in the end we want to build the skillset so that you can design for any platform that are out there right now and also future platforms. So our job as designers is to understand the need of the client and create designs that they themselves aren't able to do.
00:05:30.360 - 00:06:53.182, Speaker B: Now, Bruno wants to build this massive shopping experience online that can take on Amazon. So how are we going to do that? Well, let's dive in and let's start exploring the world of design, the processes and how we might go about designing a beautiful product. Now, this course has two paths for you to take depending on your situation. So what are these two paths? Well, one is to just follow along. We're going to show you step by step, how to go from start to finish, from sketching to having ideas, to final full fledged interactions, animations and final designs for the product. If you want, you can follow along, customize however you want, so that by the end you have an entire design system that you can use on future projects, as well as a product that you can put on your portfolio and wow your employers. The other path that you can take with this course is that you already have a client or you have a product that you want to create.
00:06:53.182 - 00:07:52.400, Speaker B: Maybe you're an entrepreneur. The way this course is structured is that we show you the exact steps a designer would take from the very beginning to the end. So by following along the step, you can actually implement your own design systems, your own designs, your own product. If you already have something, we want you to create this course so that in the future, when you get different clients, you can keep coming back to these sections and follow the steps all along, so that you have a professional, full fledged system that takes you from zero all the way to mastery, to wowing your clients. So decide on these two paths, whether you want to just follow along and customize the product that we're going to build or you already have something that you wanted to work on and follow along the steps and create your own product. I'm excited to see what you end up with at the end of the course. Let's get started.
00:07:52.400 - 00:09:00.160, Speaker B: So designing websites and apps, I mean, sounds pretty easy, right? Everybody can do it. Well, not really, because when you first think about design, most people don't consider all the things that go into designing a beautiful product. Because when we talk about design, there's actually four key elements to designing. And specifically for web and mobile designers, the first part is graphic design. This is the idea of using colors, color theory, layout, typography, sketching, using fonts, imagery. It's the idea of telling a story, to convey a specific feeling or to target a specific audience. Graphic design is all about the visuals, but just knowing graphic design isn't enough.
00:09:00.160 - 00:09:55.780, Speaker B: The next part is this idea of user experience, or UX. Because to be a good web and mobile designer, you need to study user experience and user interface design. So what is that? It's the art and science of designing products that provide users with the best possible experience. How can you make a user move through your product in an enjoyable way, in an easy flow? It's all about understanding your customer. Again, don't worry, because we're going to dive deep into these topics throughout the course. The next part is conversion focused or goal conversion. As a designer, you need to know how to design a product that drives the results that your clients want.
00:09:55.780 - 00:10:29.046, Speaker B: For example, Bruno hired you because he wants to be successful with his product. So you need to design something that increases this. Conversions. Conversions, meaning that a user takes a desired action. So your job is to motivate the visitors of your mobile app or a web app to take that desired action. Maybe sign up for a mailing list or buy a product and there's a science to go conversion. And then finally we've talked about this.
00:10:29.046 - 00:11:30.406, Speaker B: But it's this idea of platform development, whether it's on mobile or web. Although some designers limit their work and don't focus on web development or mobile app development, having at least a basic knowledge of how the platform you're designing for works. For example, HTML and css on the web can be a really important skill and a really boosting skill to be a top designer, which is why we've included in this course. Now, these are the four main things that you need to learn, and we're going to learn to be a top designer throughout all of these. And something that we keep mentioning is this idea that you'll also need to be good at client and project management. But we'll get to that later in the course. Now, throughout the course we're going to use all modern tools that top designers are using right now, but we're also going to link to some resources that you can use to help along your journey.
00:11:30.406 - 00:12:09.466, Speaker B: Now, we've already checked out the zerotomastery IO resources page where we have a bunch of resources that you can use. But here are some of my favorite ones that I recommend you check out. The first one is goodui.org dot and this is great for that goal conversion that I was talking about. It actually tells you how you can improve your conversion on your designs by showing you a b tests. So for example, Amazon discovers that showing structured product detail is better. So it actually shows you which design or which layout is better.
00:12:09.466 - 00:12:48.692, Speaker B: So they have a ton of these that they constantly post. So you can learn about good patterns, good UI practices that you can use for your website. The next one is awards.com and this is great to get design inspirations. And you can even search for inspirations like different colors or different topics and get ideas for designs that you may want to use. Another one for inspiration is this one right here. And this again shows off other people's portfolio, but can also be used as your inspiration.
00:12:48.692 - 00:13:27.182, Speaker B: Now, if you ever want to use icons in your products, well, I personally like using flat icon but if you're looking for a free version, there's also things like the noun project that give you beautiful icons that you can use if you want images for your product. Something like unsplash.com is also great to use. Now this is just scratching the surface. There's a ton of resources that you can use, but the key is to remember we have a lot of resources online as designers to develop our ideas. So don't get too intimidated. You don't always have to start from scratch.
00:13:27.182 - 00:14:11.680, Speaker B: So as a designer you can expect three things or three types of work environments. One is a freelancer. You're your own boss, you have your own clients. It involves a little bit more management on your time, but again, you're your own boss. Another scenario might be you're working at an agency. An agency is a company that has a bunch of designers and developers and they look for clients for you. And those clients talk through the agency so that you don't have to go looking for clients and the agency just assigns you different projects, which is a great way for you to gain experience working on different types of projects.
00:14:11.680 - 00:14:50.230, Speaker B: And then finally, the last type of work you'll see is working what we call in house, working for an actual company, working for a product. And you're the designer or a lead designer for a specific company. As you can see, the world of a designer is vast. There's lots to learn, but there's also lots of opportunities, which is why you're taking this course. So enough jabber. It's time for us to get started moving forward. Daniel's going to show you the step by step process that we're going to take on this course, but also for all your future projects.
00:14:50.230 - 00:15:06.410, Speaker B: Remember, the flow of the course is simple. We start with a client and then we end with a portfolio for you to use on future projects, plus the system in place for you to use moving forward for all future projects. Alright, let's get started.
00:15:16.200 - 00:15:53.150, Speaker A: Hey peeps, it's Aldo here again. I know you're dying to immerse yourself in the world of design, but before that I have a quick announcement to make. For the entirety of this crash course, my challenge to you, and quite frankly, the key to you actually succeeding, is to grab the information you're learning and apply it to your own designs. At the very least, try and modify the projects we're working on and make it your own in some way. You see, design is all about creativity, so there is no right or wrong. Well, there are rules and guidelines to help you, but you know what I mean? All I'm saying is, don't be scared to put your own twist on anything you learn with Dan. And feel free to pause the video to practice what you're learning.
00:15:53.150 - 00:15:57.130, Speaker A: Okay, enough from me. Let me hand it back over to Dan. Enjoy.
00:16:05.950 - 00:16:27.030, Speaker C: Hello and welcome back. We're going to be talking about sketching today in this lesson, and sketching is really interesting. I mean, there's so many different ways we can use sketching for user experience design. One thing I really like to do is use it just for idea generation. And, you know, we're going to learn about that. We're going to learn about the process. We're going to learn about sketching different types of flows and some tips in between.
00:16:27.030 - 00:16:59.162, Speaker C: So let's jump right in. We're going to start with an intro to sketching. So sketching is a two step process. It's very important to remember designers consider their options and then proceed to work out those details. That first step is called idea generation. And what we want to do here is we want to approach a new product and generate as many ideas as we can. It isn't uncommon for us to be missing certain ideas or elements or details, but, I mean, it's just about getting ideas out there quickly.
00:16:59.162 - 00:17:28.622, Speaker C: Doesn't matter. It isn't really focusing on the detail just at this moment. Generate as many approaches and then decide on which one is the most efficient for the task you're trying to solve for. The next step is adding detail and refinement. So step by step, you work on refining those sketches and then adding more detail. It's okay to kill some of your ideas here, and that's the point. So don't really get bogged down by all the messy sketches or the lack of detail.
00:17:28.622 - 00:18:03.990, Speaker C: Just keep on going and refining, and it'll come over time. Now, let's jump right into how we actually take a look at that process, and we go from idea generation all the way to refinement. Now, that first step is generating ideas like we just spoke about. Now, these are the initial sketches you basically create, and they have lower level details. They have no colors, usually maybe some colors to signify key parts of the sketch. But the goal here is to draw a lot of basic sketches. You'll notice here that there's just like a square, an arrow, some text.
00:18:03.990 - 00:18:45.912, Speaker C: I mean, at this point, like I said, just generating as many options as you possibly can. Don't get bogged down by those details. From here, we're going to start really kind of refining and start adding some details and we can start making some sketch like wireframes. And you'll notice that your promising sketches start to lead to more detailed view. And it may not have all the details still, and that's totally fine, but it will have a lot of the key details and you want to refine those from those sketches that you had over here. So you'll notice that, like, we start adding a little more elements and different types of UI elements up here and down here, buttons, different types of inputs. This is when we're starting to think a little bit more about interaction.
00:18:45.912 - 00:19:04.820, Speaker C: Now it will feature a lot more detail flows as well. So we'll get into this soon. Don't worry about that. The next step. So when I'm getting into visual design and start thinking much more about these wireframes in much more detail, I'm actually going to refine a lot of sketches and start to pull out certain elements.
00:19:04.860 - 00:19:06.292, Speaker D: That I think are really needed.
00:19:06.396 - 00:19:46.070, Speaker C: So, like, I'll start to realize that as I start building out these kind of components, I'm going to need like buttons, I'm going to need different inputs. I'm going to need to account for different types of content. And that's really going to help us in the future when we're thinking about the different types of requirements that we need. That is the basic process from going from ideas all the way to components. Next, we're going to be talking about entire sketching process. Welcome back. We're going to talk about the sketching process in a little bit more detail.
00:19:46.070 - 00:20:11.430, Speaker C: There's a couple different steps and steps within those steps that I want to talk about and touch upon, so that when you start sketching, you're just ready. That first step is be prepared. Always be prepared. You know, prepare your tools beforehand. Lots of papers, pens, markers, pencils, whatever works for you, even if it's like a tablet. We also want to think about what our goals are. You can think about what you're trying to solve for.
00:20:11.430 - 00:20:45.370, Speaker C: Maybe it's a certain flow, maybe it's a certain interaction, but that should always be the center of your attention. We're also going to think about our audience. This is really important. If it's for yourself, I mean, go crazy, be as messy as you want. I mean, you don't really need to annotate anything as long as you understand your own process. But if it's for somebody like a client or a stakeholder or your teammates, I mean, you need to clean them up a bit. So maybe add a bit more detail and explain your thought process so you don't waste time trying to explain it while you're presenting it to them.
00:20:45.370 - 00:21:15.566, Speaker C: Remember, always time box yourself. This is like one of the best pieces of advice I ever got in my career is to time box anything. Time box your sketching presentations. Keep yourself under a time limit because it'll help you focus on sketching for your goal and it'll put a little pressure on you to just throw out those ideas, not get bogged down by those details like we talked about earlier. So don't worry about them being messy. Just time box yourself and I promise you, you'll just produce a bunch. Step two.
00:21:15.566 - 00:21:44.344, Speaker C: Now, what you want to do here is just start. Just go draw a frame for your device. Is it a browser? Is it a desktop window? In this case, right here we have a little mobile frame. So it just needs to be a frame. It's just going to help you kind of guide your sketch a bit. The next step is to think about the bigger picture and more basic elements, elements that are much more redundant that you'll see. They'll really help you kind of frame your sketches, whether it's a footer, it's a header.
00:21:44.344 - 00:22:09.014, Speaker C: Think about those elements that you're going to be seeing a lot of, and then from there, move on to some of the more detailed elements and the more detailed interactions. You know, have fun. Start sketching those interactions. Keep them very simple. At this stage, all you need is one or two shapes, you know, squares, circles, rectangles that can make up any sketch. You'll notice here that they're just using rectangles. We have circles, we have lines.
00:22:09.014 - 00:22:39.702, Speaker C: They get their point across pretty well. Now, this is really important. This is one of my messy sketches, so I want you to just annotate and document your sketches. The worst thing is looking back and not understanding what you sketched before. You're going to be creating messy sketches. And sometimes you may not understand what you drew the day before or the week before whenever you revisit them. So the thing you need to do is just be as detailed as you can, but just quickly point out some certain reasoning or proposed interactions.
00:22:39.702 - 00:23:04.590, Speaker C: Like over here, I have some titles, I have some just some text explaining what the interaction is. It just really helps give a little more context to what you're drawing. Now, what I need you to do is just keep going. Find the sketches you like and start building alternatives from that. Don't just stop. Organize the ones that you think have the potential and keep on going. And what's going to really help you do that is by sharing them.
00:23:04.590 - 00:23:39.194, Speaker C: Share those sketches, bring them to your product team to discuss. I mean, if you're working beside them, just tap them on the shoulder, set a meeting time, just get everyone in a room to just talk about certain things that you've been working on, whether it's an interaction, whether it's an overall flow. I like uploading my sketches into figma sometimes and I share that document with the team and people can comment. I also just bring printouts or originals. So if I'm sketching on paper, I'm just bringing my paper there. Or if I'm sketching within like a tablet or something, I'm bringing that print out. What I'm doing is I'm just talking to everyone.
00:23:39.194 - 00:24:15.490, Speaker C: It doesn't matter. Developers, product managers, QA, everyone has valuable insight that you should really tap into. And after you get some feedback, you can start building off of those sketches a bit more. This is an ongoing process for every type of feature that you're going to design, the last step is refining. So how do you clarify your sketches? So you have some sketches indicating some sort of flow or interaction, and you want to clean them up a bit or think through them a bit more, but they're a bit messy and unorganized and that's okay. So what do you do? Add titles. You really want to add titles for all your sketches.
00:24:15.490 - 00:24:41.680, Speaker C: They really help you understand which screens are relevant and without thinking too much about it. This is so useful if you have a bunch of sketches like we see here. And yes, annotate again, I know I mentioned this before, but here it is. Good. Annotations are like little notes, right beside elements that explain its purpose. They also really help clarify certain things that are just too hard to draw. So it's really great.
00:24:41.680 - 00:25:13.906, Speaker C: So I mean, like over here, you can see that there's a bunch of different annotations in regards to the sketch and these different UI elements, but we also can use numbers. Try numbering your sketches. It can really help define where certain sketches within a flow or interaction. It helps speed up discussions, and it really helps others to try and make sense of where something fits in within your sketches. It also helps others to point out certain numbers when they're giving you some feedback. So they could just say, hey, Daniel, screen three. I love it.
00:25:13.906 - 00:25:56.096, Speaker C: We're going to keep that the same and it really helps you gather that feedback as well. If you're taking notes, definitely use arrows. Arrows help to indicate a transition. So we can see here that if somebody interacts with this element something else is going to happen and may push them in two different directions. Even though I don't necessarily understand this flow, I do know that something's happening here that's going to push them in two different directions, and that's with no context whatsoever. You can only imagine what somebody with context could see and the level of detail and context you can give them. So remember, use arrows that can really help indicate where there's a page transition or even an interaction transition.
00:25:56.096 - 00:26:42.700, Speaker C: And lastly, if you're feeling a little brave, you can start drawing some gestures for certain interactions. These are a bit hard, and there's a bunch of different ways you can kind of do this. You can like, try to use like little circles, you can use arrows to indicate them. But what I usually do is I sketch really quickly, and I'm not really worried about, like, refining, like, these gesture sketches. What I'll do is I'll just go right over to the developer that I'm working with or developers and have a conversation. I mean, I run it by them and try to explain this in person, maybe even sketch on a whiteboard so they can really understand my intention and I can get some insight into what they think about the interaction. These are the different types of things you can do when you're thinking about the actual sketching process.
00:26:42.700 - 00:27:14.652, Speaker C: Next, we're going to jump into actually sketching some ux flows. Hello and welcome back. We're going to be sketching some ux flows. You can tell that I'm on a tablet here because I just want to demonstrate how we can sketch those flows without using paper. A lot of people like to use tablets, and I'm using an application called concepts. It's a free application. You can pay for some additional features, but I'm not paying right now.
00:27:14.652 - 00:27:42.838, Speaker C: And, you know, I can just, like, draw. I can export this as a JPeG and send it to myself if I need it. And that's all we really need for sketching. So I totally recommend if you want to go the digital route, you can even do it in Figma and, yeah, so, I mean, you can just grab your pen. You can even change the size of it if you want to get a little more thick there. If you double tap with two fingers, you'll just go back. This is your eraser.
00:27:42.838 - 00:28:07.010, Speaker C: So for the sake of this video, I'm going to keep it pretty. I think that's good. Also, you can select different types of pens. So what we'll do is right now, we're using the regular pen. There's the fixed width pen. That's something that I rather use just for actually drawing wireframes. So let's bring that down.
00:28:07.010 - 00:28:47.094, Speaker C: I think that's a little too thick. Okay, perfect. Now we're ready to go. Here we're going to be focusing on a user's experience through certain journeys, both big and small. Before we even jump into those types of journeys, I just want to give you a little understanding of what I'm asking myself every time I approach something like this. Step one, I want to understand what I need to draw, so I got to figure out exactly what I'm thinking of sketching. Do I want to sketch a large journey, or am I thinking about a small interaction? Step two is defining some sort of starting point.
00:28:47.094 - 00:29:13.776, Speaker C: You can start at the beginning of a journey, or in the middle or at the end. You choose what you think is best. Typically, I like to start thinking about the most difficult or riskiest parts of the product first. Some people actually like to start at the end and work their way backwards to figure out how users get to a certain point. Like I said, it's whatever works for you. Step three, decide your next steps. After you define that first starting point within your flow, you need to know where to go.
00:29:13.776 - 00:29:43.202, Speaker C: Well, that is up to you, and you need to ask yourself some important questions. Which way this step lead our users? Where do you want them to go? What does a user need to do to get there in the end? When I'm thinking about alternate scenarios or alternate flows that I'm trying to sketch, I think about all the different questions in terms of alternative ways that a person can go through a certain route. So what options do they have? What happens if the user closes the.
00:29:43.226 - 00:29:44.266, Speaker D: App at this point?
00:29:44.418 - 00:30:14.050, Speaker C: Where will they resume? So these are the types of questions I'm always asking myself every time I approach a sketch. So let's start with our very first sketch. We're going to talk about mapping overall flow. Think about a user's journey through the product. That's like, from point a all the way to point b. We want to understand when they come in and when they leave and what that experience is like. It's like creating some sort of customer journey.
00:30:14.050 - 00:30:58.172, Speaker C: And here we can really outline different types of pain points when they're feeling happy through this journey, when they're feeling sad, and, you know, pick out different types of opportunities where we can really improve that experience for them and also understand where exactly we can branch out and focus on different types of flows. Let's start sketching a general journey. It doesn't need to be neat, it needs to be just a little like, you need to be able to understand it. We're going to start sketching a flow here. The first one I'm thinking about is mapping the overall journey for our client, habitual. So if I think about step one, I'm just gonna put one, I'm gonna draw a frame. And we're not really focusing on UI elements here or anything like that.
00:30:58.172 - 00:31:30.320, Speaker C: I just want to think about what the user is possibly seeing, what screens they maybe they possibly are going to and what they're expecting. So when they come to our application, you know, they may see a welcome screen and like some sort of button. Maybe it's an onboarding process. We can figure that out later. But now, like, we've kind of established that. Step two, let's create another frame. You know, maybe the user, when they come here, they're thinking about searching right away.
00:31:30.320 - 00:31:45.450, Speaker C: They want to find a product. That's why they would use something like habitual. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just draw like maybe home screen that looks like a queue, this just, that still looks like a cube. That's fine. We're gonna just draw like some boxes.
00:31:48.390 - 00:31:48.782, Speaker D: Okay.
00:31:48.806 - 00:32:31.330, Speaker C: So they come to this home screen and what they're gonna do is they're going to search for a product. And the next step is that they're going to actually find that product. So they find their product and they go and research those details. And from here, after they've done that, they're interested in actually purchasing it right now, you'll notice that this is a very happy flow. This is like what we really want our users to do every single time they come into our product. And that's not always the case. So they'll probably see like a cart with a little x, maybe there's like a checkout button.
00:32:31.330 - 00:33:07.682, Speaker C: There are details of whatever they're purchasing, whatever product they want to buy. And if we move that over, okay, little messy, but that's okay. I mean, we're getting a general sense of what this journey is looking like and they get some sort of confirmation that the package has shipped, you know, you bought it and it's right out the door. And then I don't think the journey really ends there. We need to think about what happens after it's shipped. In this scenario, it's delivered and the user is happy. So this is what our whole flow starts to look like.
00:33:07.682 - 00:33:36.280, Speaker C: User comes in and is welcomed by us. They search for a product, they find that product and review it, add it to their cart and check it out. The package ships and it is delivered to them and everyone is happy. Now, that always doesn't happen. And this is where I'm asking myself, well, you know, we asked ourselves the question of what the goal was. The goal was to sketch the whole journey. We thought about what steps come next, but we didn't really think of alternate scenarios.
00:33:36.280 - 00:34:23.300, Speaker C: So what happens if, like, they can't find their product, there's a scenario there. If they can't find their product, maybe they have to go through some category searches. So they start searching based off of categories, or they start maybe reading reviews. There's different things that we need to always take into account, not very rarely, and this is an assumption, and we always try to validate our assumption, but my assumption is that very rarely that everyone goes through the same exact flow. Maybe they want to read reviews. So we're starting to think about all the different types of scenarios that a user may experience in their journey. You know, maybe over here they're happy, so we can give them a good onboarding experience.
00:34:23.300 - 00:35:10.588, Speaker C: And over here when they're searching, maybe they're a little confused. And maybe this is a great way to implement a really easy search experience that makes them happy. So maybe we can really capitalize on that opportunity when you really need to think about who our users are and what they really want to experience when they're moving through our app. So that's how you map an overall flow using sketching. And if you wanted to, like I said before, you can just export this, bring it into Figma, clean it up a bit and start thinking about it there if you want to. But that's how you map an overall flow. Welcome back.
00:35:10.588 - 00:35:34.876, Speaker C: And we're going to jump right into sketching more flows. This time we're going to focus on screen flows. Now, here you should really focus on a user's actions through a specific flow. It could be a small sequence, a sequence of screens, or it could be a journey that branches. So let's think about our client again. This could be a user who actually searches for a product. So let's get in there.
00:35:34.876 - 00:36:10.478, Speaker C: So I'm just going to just title this. I mean, it's really hard to kind of draw on this tablet, but I'm not going to really title everything. We can just say like search, zoom out. And what we're going to do is we're going to just draw a frame here. Perfect. Once again, not really worrying about the details here, but we're going to just focus on how does a user complete this flow properly? How do they achieve their goal of finding a product? What I'm going to do is I think, you know, they'll come to the home page and they may access our search bar. You know, there may be a navigation.
00:36:10.478 - 00:36:25.302, Speaker C: I'm not sure what those navigation items are just yet, but this is what the makeup of the page is thus far. After they interact with that, the next sequence is a user sees results.
00:36:25.446 - 00:36:26.130, Speaker D: So.
00:36:28.070 - 00:36:57.178, Speaker C: Pardon my messiness, but that's okay. So they'll see some results, and over here we'll have some images. I know that there's going to be some sort of content here, and this is going to really help me start building some sort of requirements that I need to account for when I'm designing elements. So, like, I know that there's these cards that have an image, they have some text. I'm not sure what that text is. It could be a product name. It could be a combination of that plus price, plus other elements.
00:36:57.178 - 00:37:25.366, Speaker C: But I do know that when they do click over here in this area, we're going to move over. Step three would probably be something like a product description. So we'll just write item. So, I mean, you don't need to copy exactly what I'm doing. I really urge you to think outside the box. Take some time to just sketch out. I mean, you can use a tablet.
00:37:25.366 - 00:38:00.900, Speaker C: Whatever really works for you. The item description, I'm starting to really think about some of the content that's going there. It could be like the name, let's get in there and start writing a little bit of content. Price could be over here. There could be options to change color. I'm not sure exactly, but there's some text and then maybe there's like a button sticky to the bottom that says, like, add to Carta. Just double tap with two fingers in concept and you'll be able to actually just go back.
00:38:00.900 - 00:38:20.974, Speaker C: So if I go like this, double tap. Perfect. Next step, they've clicked that button. They've added that to their cart. Step four, actually, you know what? If they add that to the car, they found the item. I'll probably just go to the cart and, you know, we'll end the flow right here. I think we can actually start thinking about alternate scenarios.
00:38:20.974 - 00:38:49.080, Speaker C: So they've added their item to a cart. Perfect. And maybe there's a checkout button over there. Another interesting thing is we start thinking about different things like hierarchy. So if navigation sticky to the bottom, maybe we start using that for primary buttons. And start sticking other things to the top which are a little bit more harder to access on mobile. Just different things we're starting to think about in terms of like page hierarchy.
00:38:49.080 - 00:39:23.124, Speaker C: It's really going to help us influence like ways we start building sitemaps and actually start building that page hierarchy. Let's think about different alternate flow. What we know here is that we made the assumption that they're going to come in and they're going to click that search bar. But there's other ways to actually find a product. And this is where we can start thinking about other ways to make this process a little bit easier. So we'll label this one and we'll just call this home. But what happens if we really think about like, placing products strategically there, products for our user.
00:39:23.124 - 00:40:09.228, Speaker C: So we do know that the application that we are building is for personalized shopping experience. Like a really personalized shopping experience based off of their habits, based off of their interests. And we can really push items at the front and really hope that these users will go down that funnel instead of actually just searching. We want to make this experience much more enjoyable and more catered to them. So we could really like, take advantage of that. So we'll start thinking about, you know, maybe there are images here of products that they could like or products based off of their interests, products that maybe they're in their wish list and are on sale. So we start thinking about these different types of scenarios.
00:40:09.228 - 00:40:10.284, Speaker C: Looks like enough.
00:40:10.412 - 00:40:11.676, Speaker D: I just fixed that.
00:40:11.788 - 00:40:57.860, Speaker C: So if they do come to the home screen, they could actually tap on one of these products here. And if they do, the next step in their flow would be to actually go for the item description page that we actually built over here. So we start thinking about all those different scenarios and look at that. We already kind of came up with a little user flow and an optional user flow. We should always think about more than one scenario when we're building something like this because there always is more than one scenario and one route to get to a certain page or reach a certain goal. This is really going to help influence our page hierarchies, like I mentioned before, and sitemaps. That's how you draw screen flows.
00:40:57.860 - 00:41:44.100, Speaker C: We're back in concepts on my iPad and we're going to be sketching navigation schemes now. Navigation schemes really help you figure out which options your users can choose, the directions they can move in, and various parts of your product. It helps to define your navigation and the hierarchies within. I always do this at the beginning and it really helps influence my user flows later and my sitemaps. Basically, this is the structure of your product. So what I like to do is let's just title this quickly. So number three is a different type of flow and we're going to call it structure.
00:41:44.100 - 00:41:45.820, Speaker C: I like to call it structure.
00:41:47.000 - 00:41:48.140, Speaker D: There we go.
00:41:48.520 - 00:42:15.948, Speaker C: Okay, so number three. Now, what we're trying to do here is we're really trying to think about navigation schemes. We're trying to think about that structure of our product. Sometimes I start thinking about the different types of screens that we actually do need. The one screen I know we need and that we've actually had sketched a couple times is our home screen. That's that main screen that somebody comes to. So when I think about the home screen, I'm thinking about like maybe like a welcome message on top.
00:42:15.948 - 00:43:02.548, Speaker C: Maybe there's like a profile image, just different things like that. I mentioned certain things like having like product images at the top. So we can start thinking about that a bit more and what that could look like and what that experience can feel like. Maybe there's some deals at the bottom, but I do know that there is some sort of homepage so we can kind of like create a little icon here. Now when I think about a user moving through this app, maybe they have a saved page as well. You know, sometimes we don't want to buy a product right away or we're waiting for a sale and we just save it to some sort of wish list or something like that. So let's have a saved page.
00:43:02.548 - 00:43:36.526, Speaker C: I think that's a really smart way. We're allowing users to keep track of their products. So maybe there's some text there. We have some sort of persistent UI or navigation at the bottom. And over here it could be something really simple, like just a list of products that they have with some details. Maybe there's a call to action here that, you know, add it to your cart and buy it right away. Maybe this is synced to some sort of notification, like when a product goes on sale.
00:43:36.526 - 00:44:12.872, Speaker C: But we can start thinking about like, okay, we, we have a home page and maybe we have like a saved page as well. I do know one thing we do need for sure, and that is a cart. And we need to make that much more prominent because if a user adds something to a cart, we want that to be right at the bottom or right in place where a user can see it and click it easily. And notice that maybe there's a notification there. So let's create like a little card screen. And now I'm starting to think more about that hierarchy. I mentioned it a little bit in the last video, but maybe there's a button at the bottom.
00:44:12.872 - 00:44:57.830, Speaker C: And if you notice, like, we've had a persistent bottom navigation over here and over here. And what we've done is we kind of switched that up a bit at the bottom here. Now we have a button that links them to, like, the checkout process, and it'll allow them to easily tap that, especially on mobile and especially using that kind of design pattern. We're allowing them to click easily and then putting the option to go backwards up top, which is a little bit more harder. But if a user is going to cart, my assumption at least is that they want to check out, you know, review their products, check out quickly. So we want to make that experience really quick. So we have several navigation pieces over here.
00:44:57.830 - 00:45:22.930, Speaker C: You know, cart could live in here as well. Let's draw a little cart. That's going to have to work. Okay, so now we know some basic navigation pieces that we like. Now we can start thinking about, like, our home screen a little bit more. So, like, if we redraw it here, see about making your sketches messy. I mean, it doesn't really matter about the details or too much.
00:45:22.930 - 00:46:01.380, Speaker C: Those start to kind of come naturally. Later on, if I start thinking about where these different things lead, I can start thinking about the structure of our whole product. So I know that there's a homepage and that's the first layer. This is layer one, but on L2, I can actually go straight to a product page. So I know that's on L2. And from there I can go into checkout. So I start thinking about different ways I can prioritize certain tasks that are really important to a user and really important to our business goals.
00:46:01.380 - 00:46:37.700, Speaker C: Okay, there's our cart. But now we start thinking about that. We can also start thinking about, well, what happens after this scenario. You know, a user has gone through the checkout process and they get that nice happy screen and their item has shipped. Well, don't you often keep track of your orders? I know I do, but we can test that assumption later. Maybe there's a different navigation piece. You know, we talked about a profile, the little profile button at the top.
00:46:37.700 - 00:47:35.924, Speaker C: And, you know, maybe that leads to like a user settings page or like your current orders, but doesn't seem like that is prioritized and maybe that should be prioritized. So maybe we could create an order screen. So if we go back up, maybe there is an order screen and let's draw that up just quickly right here. We can start thinking about maybe you can search your existing orders. I'm not sure if that's a feature we would build right away, but we want to build like that most, the minimum viable product, the pieces, the features that users really want right away. So if we think about what you would see on an order screen, you'd probably see your products that you ordered, their details, and maybe the status, there's multiple statuses that we need to think about. And this is what I mean when we're talking about the different requirements that just naturally surface.
00:47:35.924 - 00:48:23.866, Speaker C: When we start thinking about different components on a page right here, this could be a product that has been shipped and there's like a map with a tracker that's like pulsing. You can start thinking about things like motion, a bit of maybe over here, this is a delivered one. So we could start thinking that, you know, we have maybe a fourth navigation piece. I would argue that, you know, your search is a part of your navigation because it's a very prominent feature for a product like this. Being able to search and find products is so important. So from here, what I would naturally do is I would start kind of, you know, sketching a little bit more screens, thinking about how these different screens link together. I would actually start building some sort of like mini sitemap.
00:48:23.866 - 00:48:57.152, Speaker C: So I know that home is like my ground zero. And from home if I move over, I get items. The product description I can get to. What else can I get to? I can get to like a category possibly. So let's write that in. And you know, there's other things like, okay, so this product is about personalization. Maybe there's like an interesting portion about like interests.
00:48:57.152 - 00:49:22.338, Speaker C: Maybe that's front and center on something like product like this. So maybe there's like, I don't know, a component around interests. So I started thinking about these types of navigation trees. We can also think about saved as well. Like we created a saved page. So if I make a little box here for saved and I go down, I can start thinking about where saved actually leads. I know I have products.
00:49:22.338 - 00:50:06.860, Speaker C: I can go to an item description page and that obviously can lead to the cart. This isn't an entirely complex product, but there's a lot of different ways you can find certain pages from saved. I could probably go directly to a checkout. That would be awesome. Especially if something comes up as like on sale or like, yeah, like a flash sale. That would prompt a lot of people to probably just bite the bullet and buy what's in their wish list. Maybe we have other items that are relevant to them and whatever's in their wishlist.
00:50:06.860 - 00:50:39.038, Speaker C: Maybe if they have something in relation to like shoes, maybe there's another pair of shoes that we can kind of push to them and hopefully they'll choose those pairs. It really depends. So we can start thinking about this navigation tree, which will definitely affect how we build out our sitemaps. So that's how you can take an approach at sketching navigation schemes. It's really easy way to just kind of get that overview of your application. I mean, we just kind of scratched the surface over here. But I urge you to kind of go back.
00:50:39.038 - 00:50:56.570, Speaker C: You know, you don't necessarily need to copy exactly what I did here. Like I said before, use what you think is best, whether that's like paper, do it digitally. Refine them. Ask questions constantly. Never stop asking questions. Cause you'll find different routes like we did. And that's navigation schemes.
00:50:56.570 - 00:51:30.432, Speaker C: Hey, and welcome back. We are going to be talking about sketching screen states now. I love sketching screen states. This focuses on drawing the entire screen or different interactions. An example is a user comes to a search page, clicks on a search bar, an overlay pop pops up, they type, get suggested searches. You know, you get the point. We start thinking about those little micro interactions as well.
00:51:30.432 - 00:51:46.980, Speaker C: That's the fun part too. I spent a lot of my time actually drawing these. So let's go back to our client. Let's think about something that we can work on. I kind of gave a little example about searching for a product. I think that's a good way to kind of start. Let's think about our home screen just a little bit more.
00:51:46.980 - 00:52:26.652, Speaker C: So let's just title that. And what I'm going to do is, well, you'll notice that I'm not really writing any annotations because they're kind of illegible. But since we're doing this together, you know, get out your sketchpad, keep on going. You know what I'm drawing and we don't really need them in this case. So if I start to think about this in a little bit more detail, I start to think about, well, what are the kind of like the different types of features and different types of elements that this page should have? You know, we talked about a profile image. We have a search here as well. And we could start thinking about, well, you know, we created a saved page.
00:52:26.652 - 00:53:00.570, Speaker C: How does a user save an item? So we have our item here. Maybe it's a little heart on each image. I don't know, I kind of like that. You know, I start to think about different things. Like the user can see in relation to that image, that type of content. That's really important. So if we zoom in, I start thinking about, like, the product name, start thinking about, like, maybe there is the price, maybe there's some product information, if that's useful.
00:53:00.570 - 00:53:52.624, Speaker C: I'm not sure. Is there a button? Can users click this whole section? Is it like a card? That's really going to be up to you and what you think is best for users typically, I don't like placing like, little buttons over here and just limiting a user because, like on mobile, you know, you want to tap larger surface areas, you gotta make your buttons much larger too. In this case, I probably will use like a card. I'm not sure just yet, but something to start thinking about. So this probably like, this interaction, when I'm thinking about it, maybe it's a carousel. So when the user kind of swipes left, what will happen is this will go there and we'll kind of start getting images that go left to right, which is pretty cool. So those will go left to right.
00:53:52.624 - 00:54:38.074, Speaker C: But let's think a little bit more about this home screen I mentioned, like, thinking about interest. We can start thinking about, like, ways that fits into the app. Maybe there's like a interest title and like a see all thing where they can go find more interest, or maybe edit their current interest. Maybe they'll see items in relation to certain categories and they can click on them and put them into a different funnel. So I'm starting to think a little bit more detail in terms of, like, what's on the page, what I need to account for when I'm building a product. And that's really helpful, especially with screen states. So we did talk about search.
00:54:38.074 - 00:55:06.120, Speaker C: So what happens if you actually click this search over here? Let's draw a state. When somebody clicks a search, I'm thinking like, an overlay will pop up. What does that interaction look like? So let's just start ground zero number one. We'll just name it overlay. Maybe an overlay pops from top to bottom. There's little x with the search. We're on mobile, so we have to remember that, you know, that there's a keyboard here.
00:55:06.120 - 00:55:41.410, Speaker C: It's a lot of rectangles. We also need to remember that these keyboards have some sort of large button that could be used as like an entertainment. So that's an alternate way for them to select something. So if they're writing something in there. If they're typing something in there, we need to start thinking about what happens. So once they start typing, we'll stay in the same screen. Everything up here will stay the same.
00:55:41.410 - 00:55:57.418, Speaker C: But now we'll start getting some type ahead results here. Let's zoom in. So we write a little bit more neatly. So if I start typing in something like book, we're going to change our.
00:55:57.434 - 00:55:58.722, Speaker D: Pen weight just a little bit more.
00:55:58.826 - 00:56:41.714, Speaker C: And we can bold it and say something like books four eight plus. And that's a great way just to kind of like make the user's life a little bit easier. Maybe they're looking for a bookshelf so we can do the same there where we just bring that down and it'll be like shelf, it'll just finish off the rest. So it's just kind of auto suggesting, auto completing for them. So we start thinking about those types of elements that we're going to need. Obviously this kind of stays persistent and we'll start thinking about, well, what happens then. Maybe it's like a 1.1,
00:56:41.714 - 00:57:14.920, Speaker C: but the next step is that they would go straight to search results. Now, what do search results look like? Maybe there's like a back button. Maybe we got our search at the top, whatever we wrote. Maybe we have some information about the amount of results. I don't know, maybe there's a filter up here. Let's draw a little filter icon. Not the best, but, you know, it works.
00:57:14.920 - 00:58:23.690, Speaker C: And they get the results here. Now here we start thinking about, well, what do they see? What can they interact with? I know that they could be, if we split these up, maybe they seem more like cards like before, so they can tap the whole thing and go straight into like a product page that we've been sketching a bunch lately. But, you know, there's probably a couple of other things that we can pull out here. Maybe we have that heart and users can go straight to our saved page, whatever that may look like. I started off with understanding that I'm going to be creating an interaction for this certain flow, searching for some sort of product, and I ask myself the question, well, what comes next? And now I'm asking the question of, well, what alternate scenarios are there? So there's a couple different scenarios here. Users can, from here we have different flows. Users can go see a product, users can save their products to a saved page.
00:58:23.690 - 00:58:52.962, Speaker C: Users also can enter a new search. It can go all the way back. And users could even filter. Users could also kind of like just abandon the search if they want to maybe we have a persistent, like, navigation at the bottom. So there's so many different scenarios, like what happens with filters. Maybe it's like another overlay. It comes down from the top, nice little animation.
00:58:52.962 - 00:59:27.014, Speaker C: And, you know, I'm starting to think about these animations a little bit more, these micro interactions, because if I leave them all the way to the end of the project, you know, they're not going to look good, they're going to look amateur. And you should really incorporate motion early on. They really help a lot with different types of things, like feedback and understanding the state of a screen. And we're going to do a whole lesson on motion later, but it's great to just start thinking about it right now. So this is like our filters. We're just going to call it fill. And now I can start thinking about the content here.
00:59:27.014 - 01:00:09.710, Speaker C: I mean, now we're branching out and that's totally fine. Sometimes I don't branch out, sometimes I just kind of stop here and I start refining this kind of flow. But it's pretty cool to start thinking about all the different types of things that you're going to need to account for, like the different types of UI elements, different types of content. So if I think about filtering for a product like this, there's a title maybe that people are going to want to filter for something like price. So that may be an option. Maybe it's by customer review or maybe it's by newest items. Maybe there's another section where it's by review, solely by review.
01:00:09.710 - 01:00:39.498, Speaker C: So we can start thinking about what we're going to need to actually implement moving forward. It's going to really help us in the future. And this is why we actually just kind of sketch and, you know, just do it quickly. So take some time to really go through that. Like I said, don't get bogged down by the details. Like, you could tell that we just went through it really quickly and we learned a lot about what possibly could be in our application. We created a bunch of screens and we have a really good, like, jumping off point.
01:00:39.498 - 01:01:05.990, Speaker C: But now we can take these, use them for like user flows, use them for sitemaps, and even start building wireframes like ASAP. The whole point of sketching is to just be lean, be agile, and don't get bogged down by the details. Ignore things like dribble or where you see like really high definition, like sketches. Just go for it, jump right in, and that's it for sketching.
01:01:06.030 - 01:01:06.850, Speaker D: Screen states.
01:01:17.020 - 01:01:55.116, Speaker C: So we're back again in concepts and we're just going to go through some quick tips just to kind of wrap everything up in terms of sketching. So let's just give ourselves a little title here. You know, I'm going to repeat a couple of things that I've been talking about, but I really want you all to understand how important they actually are. Number one is, don't worry about being messy. Go jump right in, ask yourself those questions and just keep going. Like you saw, I created a home screen pretty quickly and I started understanding that, you know, maybe we do need these elements here. They're going to probably be useful.
01:01:55.116 - 01:02:31.500, Speaker C: And I started learning about what content I can actually get from just like a quick sketch like that. And from there, we can actually go in and start refining that a bit more. You know, add icons, figuring out maybe that's an avatar, figuring out what type of information goes in here. Like, we found out that we needed a heart and maybe we need a price tag. Most definitely need a price tag, but this is the kind of stuff that it's just a natural progression. And you don't worry about drawing something like this because eventually it's going to get to something even better into the product that we eventually build. Don't worry about being messy.
01:02:31.500 - 01:03:04.606, Speaker C: Like I said, be lean, agile, sketch quickly and save yourself some time instead of worrying about the detail. The next tip is, you know, it takes a little practice, but only a little. You know, think about it as building blocks. All you need are some squares, rectangles, you know, maybe circles, and you can build a fairly decent UI like we've done before. Like our cart screen is, you know, just an x. Whatever text we have there. We have a square, some lines, another square to us, we understand what we're building here.
01:03:04.606 - 01:03:32.860, Speaker C: We can refine that if we're going to present it to teammates. We got a fairly good understanding of what we need to build a screen like this. Don't worry about it too much. If you want to have a little bit of practice, like, you can go and open an app that you love or a website that you love and try just sketching that out, just using some shapes or some basic type, and eventually you'll just develop your own type of system for sketching. There really is no wrong or right way to do it. It's just whatever is going to work for you. Next tip, keep your sketches safe.
01:03:32.860 - 01:03:59.080, Speaker C: Buy yourself a folder, please. I mean, if you're doing it digitally, that's, that's great, too, because, like, services like this will allow you to, like, export it in JPEG or whatever file format. It doesn't really matter. For sketches like this, if you're using paper, store it in a folder, scan it right away. Take a picture, please, because I can't count how many times I've lost sketches that I really needed or I really liked it. Sometimes you lose details. Just remember, keep them safe.
01:03:59.080 - 01:04:25.070, Speaker C: Always be prepared. Keep a sketch pad near you, a pencil, a pen with you on my desk at home. I always have my sketchbook. It's a dotted line sketchbook, so it's really easy for drawing wireframes and stuff like that. So keep something with you. If you like to draw digitally, like on an iPad, or if you have a tablet that you draw on, like a wacom tablet, keep that by your side because, you know, you never know when an idea is going to come. You just never know when you need to sketch.
01:04:25.070 - 01:05:11.656, Speaker C: Keep it by your side. Another thing I like to do is I like to hang my sketches up. So, like, say, if I have some sort of board beside me or a wall, I just like to hang up my sketches for some inspiration, and then I just write additional notes. If I'm working from home, I have my whiteboard that I hang up, and it serves as a daily reminder just so I can see what I've been thinking about. I can maybe scrap some ideas. I can maybe take this new idea that I have or this old idea I have, and, you know, maybe something else comes from it because I've taken some time to just take some breathing room, you know, just put it up for yourself. And if you're working with teams, they help as well because other people can kind of get into it and they can start to provide some valuable insight.
01:05:11.656 - 01:05:33.710, Speaker C: You want to keep people on your team participating. So that's the best thing I've always found, is just put your sketches up, share theme. And that leads me to, like, my next tip over here. My next tip is to kind of communicate. Just please communicate. Don't hide these gems that you're making. And I call them gems because, like, every product starts from something like this.
01:05:33.710 - 01:05:52.336, Speaker C: You know, that may not seem true, but that's what really is the skeleton of your product. They'll always start from, like, a messy sketch. So share them with people, because this is a collaborative process. Share them with your team. Talk to every teammate. It doesn't matter. They'll always provide valuable insights.
01:05:52.336 - 01:06:33.858, Speaker C: We talked a little bit about, like, a certain feature over here where there was going to be a carousel. We'll just quickly draw it again, and if a user swiped left, the new image would come in. And if I were to develop a feature like this or build a feature like this, first person I would talk to would be a developer. And I would like to understand, you know, is this feasible for our timeline? What's the best way to do it? And you can have those conversations early on. Next thing I like to do is I mentioned it briefly about, like, putting your sketches up. But some people like to get a big whiteboard and sketch on a whiteboard, and that's totally fine too. I love sketching on whiteboards now.
01:06:33.858 - 01:07:06.570, Speaker C: It's very collaborative and it's easy to involve team members in this discussion. And, you know, when you're just drawing screens, everyone can kind of just come in, point certain things out because it's marker. Nobody really gets tied to the details. Everyone's thinking about, like, the overall flow. You have so much space, sometimes you'll be surprised at how fast you can actually fill that up with your whole team. And what I also like to do is I like to pin my sketches there as well, so maybe they have some sort of relation to a certain screen. It's a good jumping off point for yourself.
01:07:06.570 - 01:08:08.140, Speaker C: So you can kind of go back to your desk or wherever you're working and start thinking about different things that could relate. And one of the last tips I have, and I do this fairly often, sometimes I'll grab a sketch. So if I have our search experience, like, so it's easy to, you know, it's easy to just sketch these out, but sometimes you don't necessarily get like a feel for the product. You know, that's natural. It's because it's on paper, it's just static. And sometimes you want to understand, like, how does that feel when a user actually clicks this? So what you could do is you can export like, individual frames any which way you want to do it. Like, you can export this whole thing here in concepts, this whole canvas, and you can kind of duplicate it and crop it to crop out each individual frame, and you can bring it into figma and link it together in a prototype, and bam, you have like something super simple and it gives you a little bit more context on how it will actually work in a digital product.
01:08:08.140 - 01:08:55.775, Speaker C: So sometimes I'll do that or I'll scan in a sketch, and that will really help me to figure that out if things actually work while I'm tapping it on a mobile screen. It also gives me a sense on, you know, these elements need to be bigger than I thought. Maybe it's not going to work here. So, like, on a home screen, we thought about things like the little hearts, but, you know, maybe we'll realize that that's not really feasible for our user to tap. Maybe it is for larger images on a mobile screen, but maybe if we're thinking about smaller ones, maybe we leave that out there because it's a little confusing and a user may go to tap that and then actually tap into the image when they didn't want to. Where do they go? They go to, like, that product description page that we've been talking so much about. All these different tips are going to really help you create a much better user experience.
01:08:55.775 - 01:09:47.210, Speaker C: It's going to help you, like, drive that communication throughout the whole team, create that collaborative process. At the end of the day, it's going to make you a better designer. It's going to make your users happy. So follow these tips, follow that process we talked about earlier in the lesson, and you're well on your way to sketching some amazing interactions and different types of flows. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So we're going to be learning about inspiration, and inspiration is a pretty tough topic because I always get the question of, like, how do you stay inspired? Where do you find your inspiration and things like that. I mean, it is a tough question to answer and, you know, we're going to get right into that.
01:09:47.210 - 01:10:06.914, Speaker C: I often get the question, how do I stay inspired? And, you know, it's easy to go to a site and find, like, a mobile design. And, you know, you may get excited about that, but, I mean, that just kind of burns out eventually and you don't know where to go from there. It's tough to stay inspired and this is what we're going to learn right now. So it's not a secret that being.
01:10:06.962 - 01:10:09.322, Speaker D: Creative, like, you can get drained of ideas.
01:10:09.466 - 01:10:37.186, Speaker C: You know, it could be like you're working at work and you're on a single project and it's just like, it's draining the life out of you. And that does happen, and it's hard to stay inspired in moments like that. So creativity is kind of like a muscle and, you know, if you don't use it, you kind of lose it. I mean, well, not entirely, but it may get weaker. You must constantly stimulate your creativity so that whenever you're asked for, like, a great idea, you're like, you're just ready.
01:10:37.218 - 01:10:39.170, Speaker D: And you're on the ball. That's the goal.
01:10:39.290 - 01:10:53.912, Speaker C: This doesn't mean that, like, you're hanging out on, like, dribble or behance or any site like that and looking at pretty screenshots. There's a couple of things that I do and a couple things that my coworkers do a lot of. So you want to learn?
01:10:54.056 - 01:10:55.140, Speaker D: Let's jump in.
01:10:55.480 - 01:11:32.820, Speaker C: Number one, this may kind of seem obvious, but I mean, talk to the people, you know, your peers. I mean, having engaging conversations with the super smart people you work with is going to be amazing. If you're not doing this, you should. Some of the most inspiring conversations I have had have been with my peers over lunch or coffee or a walk. Sometimes these chats end up with you maybe helping out with a design challenge of some sort or just understanding what they're going through. It may make you think about your problem a little differently or may inspire you to do something differently. So definitely talk to your peers because they are where you are.
01:11:32.820 - 01:11:49.982, Speaker C: They are smart like you, and they have a lot to talk about and they have a lot to share. So tap into their brains. Next is study others. This is another big one. So I kind of lied a bit when I said that, you know, you should be studying your peers and what your peers are doing at all times.
01:11:50.046 - 01:11:51.734, Speaker D: I mean, it could be on dribble.
01:11:51.782 - 01:12:36.046, Speaker C: Or something like that, but it's important to study their work and break down their solution to discover how they thought about it. It's not just about looking at what the solution is, but it's also about dissecting it, understanding what their solution was for what the problem was. I like building little collections of these solutions that I can always pull from as inspiration. So if I'm thinking about a certain design pattern, like social login or something like that, I may have, like, just a collection of screenshots on how people solve that that I really like. I think you should collect examples of great techniques. Don't copy, but learn from them, so that it can inspire better solutions for the products you build. The next one is you should surround yourself with great design.
01:12:36.046 - 01:13:09.546, Speaker C: Try thinking about how you can surround yourself with that inspiration. You know, it could be your home, it could be a desk like this. You know, it could be digitally if you have like, a dribble collection or something like that. I know I keep on going back to dribble. Keeping inspiration around you allows you to pull from whatever you need to. It also serves as a great reminder for what you want to achieve. I also find that even making, like, your workspace just very comfortable and very much attuned to how you are as a person could really help just your workflow in general, like, a desk like this is really nice.
01:13:09.546 - 01:13:32.602, Speaker C: And, you know, it may not suit all of us. I have a really nice desk at home and I really love just sitting there and working there. You know, there's some plants on the desk, there's some lights just to have less strain on my eyes. It's just a more comfortable workplace and it's really zen for me. And I also have some paintings that I really love hung up around here. So surround yourself with great design. Surround yourself with things that inspire you.
01:13:32.602 - 01:13:52.484, Speaker C: I think this one's kind of, it speaks for itself. You know, you should really educate yourself and stay educated. Reading books is huge. I love to read. I love to read on a variety of different topics. I mean, not just design. I like to learn about product management and how to like increase my workflow and increase like team velocity and stuff like that.
01:13:52.484 - 01:14:15.278, Speaker C: So stay educated on a variety of topics. Remember to always try and learn. It's huge. Read books about your discipline. Read books about other discipline. Read articles. You don't need to be an expert in terms of the different types of disciplines that you're reading about, but you should want to learn about like things like development or like facilitation or user patterns or marketing.
01:14:15.278 - 01:14:55.314, Speaker C: This really helps you contribute thoughtful ideas whenever you discuss those types of topics. And sometimes it's good to have that extra context so that you can approach it from your design or mindset. So if there's a problem with, like, marketing, maybe you know a couple of different things about marketing, you can approach it differently. It always helps me to read up about developing and really lean on my peers who are developers to understand how things are built. So when I approach my design, I know that certain things are not feasible. I know certain things that can be achieved. So I really try to learn about different disciplines and it has made me a much better designer and more well rounded designer.
01:14:55.314 - 01:15:20.860, Speaker C: And the most important thing is knowledge is definitely power. So this is probably the best thing you can do is just stay educated on a variety of topics. Sometimes you have to take some time to design for yourself. You know, it can be exhausting designing for a client, and sometimes it can get demoralizing at some points. You know, you may be stuck on a project for six months. I know people that have been stuck on projects, sometimes for a year, and it really depends on what type of company you're working for. But it may happen.
01:15:20.860 - 01:15:42.588, Speaker C: And at that point, you know, you could be, like I said, on a project for months and have total lack of inspiration. You may feel like, your work or your ideas aren't inspiring you or anyone else. And you should probably think about ways that you can design for yourself. It can be anything. It could be an app. It could be like painting. I sometimes like to paint on my spare time, especially with my children.
01:15:42.588 - 01:16:08.388, Speaker C: So, I mean, stuff like that just really takes the load off your shoulders. It allows you to kind of express some of your creativity and get back, get inspired to also design. Now, this one is another great one. I don't do this personally. I have a lot of coworkers that love to travel. And one thing they say is like, you know, travel exposes you to new culture. It could be like different people, it could be different experiences.
01:16:08.388 - 01:16:49.760, Speaker C: And by immersing yourself in an area away from your home, you kind of push yourself out of your comfort zone, and it kind of opens your eyes to new possibilities. So, you know, travel the world if you can. I know a lot of remote workers that love to travel and work elsewhere. So if that's definitely a possibility, and I've heard great things, and the next one I like to do, I do this all the time. It's so easy to just stick around at your desk and try to come up with ideas, but, you know, scientifically. 2014 study by Stanford University found that walking boosted your creativity. And sometimes you just need to leave your office and go for a nice walk.
01:16:49.760 - 01:17:21.836, Speaker C: You know, you don't know who you may see. You don't know what you may encounter. I often like to chat with coworkers on a quick walk. I like to go grab a coffee or something like that and just get a breath of fresh air and then come back to a problem if I'm having a tough time. So these are the different things that I do and my coworkers have done, and they have been proven to work. I feel inspired all the time just because of my surroundings personally. And, like, I love taking my walks, I love talking to my peers, and I'm just staying educated on a variety of different topics.
01:17:21.836 - 01:18:03.774, Speaker C: Take these tips with you and do your best to stay inspired. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So we're going to talk about how I find inspiration online. Now, we already went over how we can stay inspired, and generally, that's where I get most of my inspiration. You know, talking to peers, walking around, studying other people's work, you know, staying knowledgeable about different topics, that's what really keeps me inspired by. Also think that a key to your product design process in this is what I find absolutely necessary, is to have a constant source of online inspiration. So there's several sites that I like to visit.
01:18:03.774 - 01:18:29.876, Speaker C: These are some of them. The main one I like to visit is dribble. So here's dribble. It's a great place. I'm sure many of you know it already, but I love it just because I can just make a bunch of collections of different types of like design patterns that I really love. Also, searching on here is really easy and this is probably one of the best places to go and get ideas for your designs. I mean, not because there are so many people posting cool things, but you know, it's a great way to study your peers.
01:18:29.876 - 01:19:08.094, Speaker C: You can discover some of the world's top designers and creatives and you can also get inspiration from a wide range of disciplines, like anything from animation, branding, illustrations, product design, web design, print. I mean, there's so many different things on here. There's always a project you can learn from. And what makes it great is that it's a place where people can post their content and get feedback. I mean, feedback doesn't happen very often on a lot of these posts, but it's just a great way to get a lot of different type of inspiration. Some people even like showcasing their portfolio for potential clients or studios. And because of this, like final pieces that are uploaded are like of the highest quality.
01:19:08.094 - 01:19:46.778, Speaker C: I generally love to catalog different things, like I mentioned before, and this is what I generally do and this is how I use it. So I like to sometimes just browse all. I'm a big fan of like different things. I guess like an example would be like if I just typed typography, some people are doing some really interesting stuff that may inspire me. Like just seeing something like this print collateral and looking at all these different shapes and the way they're positioned and even the way like the text is bolded, laid out. Something like that could inspire me for like website hero page or something like that. So, like, anything you can grab inspiration from.
01:19:46.778 - 01:20:27.026, Speaker C: And I feel like a lot of people get really hooked up or held up on trying to find just the right solution that they can kind of mimic. Don't do that. I mean, that's one way to kind of stunt your creativity. So what I like to do is like, if I'm going to search for something like navigation or mobile navigation, I like to see all these different types of like options. So like if I go into this, this is pretty cool, just the way they have these little kind of micro interactions and animations. So I may just like save that and I have a bunch of different, like, collections. So you can see I have a collection for calculators or carousel forms, color.
01:20:27.026 - 01:20:54.450, Speaker C: There's like CRM tools that I like to look at. I may save this under mobile navigation and I can just create a collection really quickly. So this is really cool. And there you go, it's saved. You can even like it if you want. And you can start typing. And, you know, some people like to give their feedback or just ask questions.
01:20:54.450 - 01:21:30.310, Speaker C: It's really great place. So this is what we typically do. Like, I would grab this, I would save it. I would type in, like, mobile navigation and start creating a collection of different ways people have done this. If I'm trying to solve for a similar problem that I'm stuck on now, I may not be stuck on this per se, but I may get inspired by something like just how they have done these smooth animations, like in this example I just showed you. So I may really like this, just the subtlety of it, and I may want to implement something similar for my product. And the easy way to get there is to hover over your profile and go to, like, my collections over here.
01:21:30.310 - 01:21:31.976, Speaker C: And you can see, like, I have.
01:21:32.008 - 01:21:33.048, Speaker D: Like, even a test.
01:21:33.144 - 01:22:14.258, Speaker C: I have a bunch of different options here. So I have mobile navigation right there and I'll just, you know, kind of go through them. I may, like, copy them or, like, make notes about this mobile navigation if I edit it and add a description to it. So that's how I typically use dribble. I mean, like I said before, you can get inspiration from, like, any type of discipline. Like, even if it's branding, like, just seeing, like, maybe like, just the way that they've incorporated a background here seems very interesting and how sharp, like, in terms of contrast there is between color and shade. You know, don't limit yourself just by trying to find the right solution for what you're trying to do.
01:22:14.258 - 01:22:34.916, Speaker C: You know, look elsewhere. Another thing I like to use is Pinterest. This is a whole lot of library of visual content. I mean, you can get inspiration for everything here, but there is a lot of noise. I think the best way to get inspiration from something like Pinterest is to do what I've just done here. You know, just have a very, like, targeted search. So I've chose mobile design.
01:22:34.916 - 01:23:01.750, Speaker C: And, yeah, there are a lot of different options here. And what you can do is you can just kind of save it. I have, like, a keto family meal plan, little kind of collection over here. And you can, like, save those collections for yourself or your, those boards they're called in Pinterest. I mean, one thing you can also do like, is create a bunch of different boards about different types of design patterns that you love. So that's one way to use Pinterest. I also like to just like use Pinterest just to look at different things.
01:23:01.750 - 01:23:30.634, Speaker C: I mean, it could even be like interiors. It could be anything, like design related, even if that's interior design. Like I said, don't limit yourself just to, like, finding the right solution. So what I typically do is I like to just kind of go into one and I'll like, I'll save it to a certain board. So like, I'll click save and it'll go into that board. It went into the wrong one, but you can kind of change that. You can pick basically bunch of different boards.
01:23:30.634 - 01:23:58.990, Speaker C: You can even make a new one on the go. So that's definitely an easy way to keep track of a bunch of inspiration. There's also a plugin that allows you to actually, like, save different types of content. So if we go back to dribbble. So here's my Pinterest extension. And what you can do is like, if I focus on here, I have it pop up over here that I can, I want to save it to somewhere. Even if you're on a different site, you can save things to your Pinterest board.
01:23:58.990 - 01:24:36.086, Speaker C: Easy way to use Pinterest and collect inspiration over time. The next one I like to use, I don't use this very much, but I mean, one thing I really love about behance is that the quality is really good here. And, you know, there's a lot of explanation behind some of the work. This is another interesting place to find a bunch of different types of inspiration, whether it be like graphic design, you know, all different types of design. I often use this kind of like alongside dribble, but not as much as dribbble. A good thing to note is that big businesses will spend a bunch of money advertising job roles here with hopes of attracting, like, top talent. So since there are big brands on the lookout, you can expect to find lots of work.
01:24:36.086 - 01:25:22.842, Speaker C: You know, there's a lot of great ideas and lots of creativity. So if I go here and I search like mobile, like, I can already see there's a bunch of different, like, options. And one thing that's really great about it, that's way better than dribble. Dribble just kind of gives you like a snapshot of a design over here. Like, a lot of people like to upload, like, so much content in regards to the actual app, like, you often only see like just a snippet that looks really good, but you kind of are left in the dark about how the rest of the application pans out and if it's good at all. So this is what, like a lot of the different types of like kind of things you'll see on the hands. Like a lot of different types of gallery image, like images like this, they'll break down, like the challenge or customer development.
01:25:22.842 - 01:25:52.060, Speaker C: I like this stuff way more than the pretty screenshots because I'm really interested in like how they solved the problem and how they got to the solution. So some people will often post things like that. I like to see how people even lay out like or define their style guides. So this is really cool. Like see more in depth animations which look really, really smooth. I like to see different types of things. Like they have a transactions over here, they have card settings, just like how the bank cards will look.
01:25:52.060 - 01:26:25.026, Speaker C: It just gives you a lot more versatility on how you want to like view those projects and what you're looking for. Like if you're looking for a quick solution for like a design pattern, then, you know, maybe dribble may be one of the better sites to look at or patterns which we'll get into next. But I. This was really great to get overview of certain projects. You know, there may not be as many, but a lot of the projects on here are just top notch. So another thing I really like to use is patterns. So one thing you need to know is that patterns isn't free entirely.
01:26:25.026 - 01:26:52.992, Speaker C: This is essentially like a focus on mobile design patterns. And there's some great mobile app designs here and you'll get screenshots of like in depth UI elements. You can even search just based off of Ui elements, which is really cool. And like I said before, it's paid. So it kind of limits the amount that you can see. Sometimes what you can see is enough. But I mean, if you're really looking into solving for different design patterns and you don't mind paying for premium, then I think this is a really great resource.
01:26:52.992 - 01:27:36.516, Speaker C: So like if we take a look on the side here, we have like different categories, which is really cool. Like if I'm going to look for cards, I see how different people have handled cards and I'll only get to see just a little bit. I think they'll stop me like right now. So it's not a lot, but I mean it's not necessarily like everything is super pretty. Like in terms of like the dribble effect, but you get to really see some actual solutions that have been implemented, which I value, I think, a bit more. What else do we have here? Like, I love to see different things, like, you know, lists is another cool thing, like how people handle different lists. So I mean, this is really great for just finding individual like, Ui elements and stuff like that.
01:27:36.516 - 01:28:16.730, Speaker C: I love using patterns. I have a paid account through my company, so that really helps. And yeah, this is how I solve a lot of like different types of like individual problems or like problems that are kind of more secluded and more focused in a certain area. So like, if an example would be how do I handle like privacy or popovers? So I have privacy here and there isn't many options, but it's very interesting, like, you know, they have a verify your identity option. So I may think about that when I'm implementing something like that. If I think about like popovers, I think like, you know, maybe like the overlay can come from the top, it can come from the side. So I see a bunch of different implementations of that.
01:28:16.730 - 01:28:57.690, Speaker C: And the last site I kind of use, I like this site, especially for websites, is awards. So this is another great option for web based design. They have an award system. Like you can see that over here and, you know, it displays exceptional designers and they have expert judges and a pretty strict evaluation process. And you'll notice a lot of the latest web trends are over here. So we can search up something like banking, and here you can search by websites, you can search by like elements. So if we go to load all results, let me just click that.
01:28:57.690 - 01:29:34.672, Speaker C: If we, yeah, if we go there, we can see bunch of different websites based off of what we searched for. And what's really great is like, I searched up something like banking, which you would assume would be really like rigid and, you know, strict in terms of like their design and their design principles. But you see a bunch of different, like, takes on what banking could look like. I mean, not all these things are necessarily banking related, but there's a lot of inspiration here. So like, we could just click over here. We have a small banking business and this is Lone Star National bank. It's a really great site.
01:29:34.672 - 01:30:13.204, Speaker C: I can see just a bit of the hero. If we click into that, we'll go to the actual website and be able to actually experience that experience. So this is obviously a little bit different than what we saw. But, you know, maybe they've had a design update and maybe for the better or for the worse, but it gives you good context as well into like the solution. You know, going back to pretty screenshots and not necessarily knowing if certain things have been implemented. These have pretty much all been implemented. And you can see how that actually functions when you go to that website and try those different like interactions or you know, explore navigation schemes and stuff like that.
01:30:13.204 - 01:31:09.278, Speaker C: So these are basically the top ways I get my online inspiration. I mean, I mentioned before that I get a lot of my inspiration by just staying inspired in general and like staying knowledgeable on different topics, whether that be like design trends, whether that be like development trends and everything like that. So I think it's really important that you kind of catalog some actual visual design inspiration online as well. And these are some resources that you can definitely use. So if you want to categorize everything from all different sites, you know, Pinterest is probably best to have like one source of truth in terms of board. But if you want to stick to certain sites like, you know, dribble, you can like save collections there and have it all in one place over there. So this is what I use and you know, go out there, have fun, don't copy people, but just try and stay inspired online and surround yourself by online inspiration.
01:31:09.278 - 01:31:21.230, Speaker C: So that way when people come to you for ideas, you're kind of on the ball. You understand a bunch of different design patterns and you just have general knowledge of what are the latest trends. So go out there and have fun.
01:31:30.330 - 01:32:08.014, Speaker A: Hey, again, just a quick heads up that in the comments section, Dan will be introducing an extremely valuable tool named Figma. It's quickly become the go to tool for designers and it's a must learn if you're new to the design industry, whether you're looking to get hired or even just working on your own designs. Now, you may have used Figma in the past, or this may be your first time, just in case it is your first time. We have included some helpful guides to help get your account set up down in the description below. Now, you do have to create an account, but it's completely free, at least for what we will be doing. We've also included some links for accessing and duplicating course Figma resources just in case you get stuck. But that's all for now.
01:32:08.014 - 01:32:10.330, Speaker A: Let me hand it back over to Dan. Enjoy.
01:32:20.230 - 01:32:45.616, Speaker D: Hey everyone, this is the Figma website. I want everyone to understand what Figma actually is. So Figma is free. There are some paid plans and I'll get into that. But Figma is free. It allows you to create amazing uis, allows you to collaborate with your team really easily and allows you to prototype and get feedback. And it's an easy handoff for developers.
01:32:45.616 - 01:33:15.830, Speaker D: Let's jump right in so I can show you. So this is their website. Now some of you may be using the web browser to log in and this, you're going to sign up here and log in here. But you know, if you're really interested in using something like Figjam, which is one of the other Figma products, you can use Figjam here as well. It allows you to easily brainstorm. It's a really great tool. But one of the great things about Figma is the ability to just bring.
01:33:15.870 - 01:33:18.358, Speaker C: Your ideas to life, whether that's just.
01:33:18.414 - 01:33:31.160, Speaker D: Creating, iterating and repeating that whole process. Figma allows you to create some really beautiful designs. I think one of the other great things is the collaboration aspect.
01:33:31.320 - 01:33:32.472, Speaker C: As you can see just in this.
01:33:32.496 - 01:34:15.620, Speaker D: Little illustration over here. You know, you have two people working together, you can see comments, it's great for getting feedback if you're a design system nerd like myself. I know this may not make sense to some of you, but design systems are really powerful. They allow you to create components, they allow you to, you know, use those components everywhere. And there are some different distinctions between how you can use components within Figma, and I'll get into that, but components are really powerful. It really is great to work with developers on how to use these components, what they look like, what their different states are. It's really great.
01:34:15.620 - 01:35:04.232, Speaker D: And the last part is developers can easily come in here and understand what exactly makes up one of your designs, whether it's like a UI element that they're clicking on. They want to know, maybe position, they want to know like if there's like a border radius, they can get all the CSS from Figma as well. So Figma is a great tool that allow you to work with your entire team, whether it's strategy, design and even development. Another great thing about Figma is that they have a bunch of resources. I'm going to get into what is the community, but you can get files and templates, plugins and widgets. It's amazing. It'll really help speed up your workflow and share some of your designs.
01:35:04.232 - 01:35:34.070, Speaker D: Even with the community. It's a really great place. Hey everyone, we're going to talk about pricing and just the plans in general that Figma offers. Now Figma offers three different plans. Most of you are going to be totally fine in the free starter plan. Now. There are some limitations.
01:35:34.070 - 01:36:23.166, Speaker D: Some of those limitations are that you can only use one project with three files. That's a bit limited, but some of you may not mind. So I wouldn't worry too much about that. I would just try Figma out and then maybe move to professional if you want something that's a bit more expansive. Now, some of the things that you can do in the professional account is that you can use these components I was talking about earlier and use them across a bunch of different files. Now, if you do create components and you like using design systems or design libraries, you won't be able to use them outside of their local files. If you're in a starter plan, which is limiting to some, some won't care as much because they may not be using components a lot.
01:36:23.166 - 01:36:57.570, Speaker D: But if you plan to, then the Figma professional plan is going to be the plan for you. That is one of the biggest differences that I personally noticed from one plan to the other. So I would recommend start off with the free account. Go from there. If you do like it, the professional account is way worth it. If you need the projects, if you need those files, if you need to be able to use design libraries across multiple projects and files. So just a heads up, that is the biggest difference.
01:36:57.570 - 01:38:04.358, Speaker D: Now one of the other things is you can come over here into the website where I'm currently at, and you can just see and compare them really easily. So I'm going to post this link as a resource for everyone who's interested. It's super, super helpful if you're looking to distinguish line item by line item, what the differences are. When you do want to sign up, you're going to be able to come in here and just click sign up. You can use like a Google password or a Google account and do it like that. You can actually just sign up with your email, but you're going to sign up right through here and it's going to ask you a bunch of questions about which plan you want to be a part of, etcetera, and you'll be pushed right into the actual website. Hey everyone, I want to talk about where you can get the Figma downloads.
01:38:04.358 - 01:38:36.488, Speaker D: So I know many of you may have signed up already, some of you haven't. That's totally fine, so don't worry about that. Now you can sign up on the website and you can use the web browser as your way of using Figma, and that works perfectly fine because the actual desktop experience doesn't very much. Some people just have a preference. I'm one of those people that use it both on my PC, I use it on my MacBook, and that's how I prefer to use Figma. I like that dedicated space without the noise of a browser. But if you want to use the browser, go right ahead.
01:38:36.488 - 01:39:06.978, Speaker D: You don't need to worry about the Figma download section here. Now you can access this on the website by just clicking on products going down to downloads. And this is where it'll be. Now you can find the desktop app here for both Mac OS and Windows. You can also find the mobile app for Android and iOS. So the mobile app is really great. If you're on the go, you want to take a look at design files, you want to answer some comments, you want to take a look at a prototype.
01:39:06.978 - 01:39:50.524, Speaker D: That's what the mobile app is really good at. If you want the desktop app for that dedicated experience, this is where you're going to come. So I'll make these links easily available for everyone. Hey everyone, and welcome back. I wanted to go through the Figma UI and more specifically just the structure of the dashboard area over here. Now where we currently are is where you're going to land when you first open Figma every single time. Now you'll have a navigation bar up here.
01:39:50.524 - 01:39:54.076, Speaker D: You can search, you can see your.
01:39:54.108 - 01:39:55.252, Speaker C: Accounts that you have connected.
01:39:55.316 - 01:40:21.840, Speaker D: You can connect more than one account, so it's really easy to switch. You can access the community as well. If you're working on multiple teams or if you shared a file that has comments on it, notifications will show up over here. If you want to access more things about your account, you can do that here. Even has a nice, nice link to get the desktop app. You can add your account here. If you have multiple accounts, like I mentioned before, you switch them on this side.
01:40:21.840 - 01:40:49.558, Speaker D: So I do that really often. I have multiple accounts and I love switching between them, between my work and my personal. So that is the navigation bar. Then you have the sidebar. Now, your sidebar is made up of a bunch of different things. You have your recents where you're going to be accessing all the files that are available to you based off of what you recently opened. You have your drafts now, these are where all your files are going to live.
01:40:49.558 - 01:41:26.620, Speaker D: Now, if you don't have a professional plan, majority of your files are going to live right here. And that's fine. I would just name them properly and, and find a convention that works for you to create a little bit of structure. Because if you do have a professional plan, you'll have the ability to add a bunch of projects and a bunch of files within those projects. Unfortunately, that's a bit limiting right now to the starter plan. A great thing about Figma and I'll get back to this file I just opened, is you can have favorite files. So if I go back to my recents up here, you'll see that I've starred a couple of files now three files, and they'll all show up here.
01:41:26.620 - 01:42:13.240, Speaker D: So if you're working on a file or there's a file that you constantly like refer to, that's a great way to just find it in one spot. All this functionality is also within the desktop app. Now these are the files, so you can click them like I did before and open up a new tab, or you can right click them and you can, you know, see all the different options available to you, whether you want to share it. You can copy a link, you can remove it from your favorites, you can duplicate it, etcetera. You can even start a new design file right from your drafts or recents, or import a file like some of the resources we have. So that is the easiest way to do that over here. And that is your figma dashboard.
01:42:13.240 - 01:43:00.584, Speaker D: Hey everyone, we're going to talk a bit more about files now. Files can be a little tricky to just understand quickly. I mean, maybe not so tricky. This is where you're going to do all your designing, but using the resources available in the course is basically one of those things that are really going to help you be successful at the end of the course. So I'm going to talk about how to use those files and just how to access them. So you can see here, if you've accessed the link that was given to you by the course, this is what will happen. You'll be pushed right into this link and you'll see, oh, ask to edit.
01:43:00.584 - 01:43:40.414, Speaker D: Don't click that. That's just not what you're going to do here. The easiest way to actually get here and get this file is to go and click this little arrow. We're going to duplicate that file, we're going to click the arrow and we're going to duplicate the file to our drafts. And just like that, a new tab is made, a new file is made, and if we go back, we can see that this is the new file, it's our recent, this is still one that is the original. This is my file that I'm sharing with everyone. And now you can use this file as well.
01:43:40.414 - 01:44:27.740, Speaker D: So this layer is locked. I believe you can go ahead and move it around and start editing this actual file. So that's how you're going to duplicate files. If you've downloaded the resources or if you have another file that you want to bring in here, you're going to click the import file and what you're going to do is you're going to take the Figma file like that, bring it right in, and it has been imported. We can click it and it's going to open up that new tab. And here you'll be able to edit it as well. So that is how you bring in files.
01:44:27.740 - 01:45:18.612, Speaker D: You can duplicate them, import them. If you want to create new design files, all you have to do is just click this new design file right here, this big button. So you click that, it's going to open up a new file and it's going to bring you right inside. And here you can click whether you want to name it something. So I have my new design file and now you are on the canvas. This is the canvas area and that is how you basically use design files in Figma. Hey everyone, I want to talk about tools.
01:45:18.612 - 01:45:42.094, Speaker D: So what we're going to do here is we're just going to create our new design file. So I'm going to click that button. It's going to pop open that new tab. I'm just going to call this one test for now. Now I'm going to show you a bit about Figma and all the different things you have going on over here. So over here we just have the tabs. So these give you like a quick overview of what you have open.
01:45:42.094 - 01:46:09.000, Speaker D: You can have multiple tabs open up here is the toolbar. So let's start from the left. This is going to be your menu. And your menu is going to have a lot of different interesting things in here. You're going to be able to see quick actions. So if you like using quick actions, you can click that and say, I'm going to search for plugins so I can go and search plugins in the community. Really great way to see what you have available to you.
01:46:09.000 - 01:46:54.758, Speaker D: You can also see different types of settings for like your file, the ability to edit, view. I would say the majority of these you may not be touching, you may touch them once and then just leave it. I think one of the biggest things that is really helpful here is going into the help and account and going to keyboard shortcuts, which is going to pop open a shortcut tab right at the bottom based off of your system that you're using. It'll help you think about, well, how do I access something like the pen tool. And how do I make select all for MacBooks? For Mac OS, it's going to be command a versus control a. So I mean, you're going to be able to get all that information right within the app, which is super helpful. So I'm just going to close that right now.
01:46:54.758 - 01:47:17.870, Speaker D: So that's the menu. This is where you're going to access your tools. So we have our basic tools up here. We have move and your scale tool. We have your frame tool. Now, I'm going to go into these a bit deeper later, but these are where you're going to get your frame tool. Frames are where you're going to draw essentially your canvas.
01:47:17.870 - 01:47:33.442, Speaker D: You're going to draw things on the frame. It's like the canvas or your artboard, whatever you would like to call it. But in Figma they're called frames. So we have our frame and slicing tool. Frame is probably the most important. Then we have our shapes. And this is where you can come in and make some great shapes.
01:47:33.442 - 01:48:04.066, Speaker D: If you're making logos, if you're just using shapes for just interest on your webpage or whether it's like a mobile app or something, this is where you'll come to use your shapes. And they have these shortcuts on the right. So you have your rectangle, you have your line, arrow, ellipse, polygon, star, and you can place your image here as well. This is your pen tool, which is really helpful if you're making custom shapes. I love the pen tool. We have the text tool. This is really helpful.
01:48:04.066 - 01:48:32.756, Speaker D: If you need to write something, text tool is going to be your friend. So that's the text tool. And we have the hand tool for moving things around. Really helpful for moving around selections and not clicking into them. And then we have the comment tool. So one great thing figma does is they have like this onboarding tutorial system. So when you sign in for the first time, they're going to run you through everything.
01:48:32.756 - 01:48:52.686, Speaker D: You'll also see certain things for new tools and whatnot. So that is really helpful. So I'm just going to close that. So we have our comments. You can just leave a comment when you click on that tool. So I have a comment here I'm going to describe, hey, great work. And then press enter and that comment is stored and you can move comments around.
01:48:52.686 - 01:49:14.656, Speaker D: It's really great. And you can keep track of them over here. Then you have things like contextual tools. So let's say I have a rectangle. I'm going to make a copy of that rectangle using command C. You can use control C if you're on Windows, and then command or control v and then I have that copy. So you can see that over here in the layers panel.
01:49:14.656 - 01:49:44.206, Speaker D: So if I have two different rectangles, I can see my contextual tools. So over here you have components. This is a little advanced, so I'm not going to really talk about components too much right now. We have masking. Masking essentially allows you to create shapes and hide different aspects of other shapes. So you can use the masking tool there. And we also have boolean tools as well.
01:49:44.206 - 01:50:27.040, Speaker D: So I'm going to actually select both of these and you have these Boolean operations so you can like create a union, subtract. So if I'm going to do that, I'm just going to subtract and it's taken a chunk out. So a lot of cool things up there in the contextual tools. Aside from that, you do have like the file settings over here. Whether you want to see like the version history, you want to publish components, you want to rename it, you want to move it to a new project or another project, delete it or favor the file, you can do that all within here. This is where you can access the project. It was in, so ours was in drafts and I clicked drafts.
01:50:27.040 - 01:50:56.460, Speaker D: I'm going to go back. So that's what I clicked over there. And over here on the right side you have some of your share and view settings. You'll see the different people that are in this file when they're in here as little avatar bubbles. You'll be able to click the share button and get into all the nitty gritty ways to share, whether that's with anyone with a link can view. This is how you're going to get your files. You're going to get them as viewable files, like I said.
01:50:56.460 - 01:51:40.020, Speaker D: You can also just invite people manually, you can let them edit and that is how you just grab the link. You could also play prototypes. So if I were to make a frame, I'm going to press f to make that frame. So if I have a little iPhone 13 mini, I'm going to just put that there and just drag one of my text layers on here and I'm just going to place that there for now. So this is just my design. I know, it's great. And if I press play, it's going to open up that prototyping tab for us and you'll be able to see your prototype.
01:51:40.020 - 01:52:24.472, Speaker D: You can link together prototypes and they'll show up there. So that is essentially how you would play a prototype. If you want to get into the zoom and view settings, you can do that here as well. You can customize what you see and you can customize basically how you see it. You'll see like all the shortcuts here for zooming in and out and how to access some of these view options. And that is the toolbar. Hey, everyone, I want to talk about now the left sidebar.
01:52:24.472 - 01:52:51.140, Speaker D: So you'll see that I'm not in my test file anymore. This is what it looked like before. It was kind of a mess. So I think it's probably best that we look at a real file that, you know, has a bit more structure to it so you can understand what the left sidebar looks like. So I'm just going to pop this out and we are going to talk about this area, the left sidebar. So the left sidebar is where you're going to find layers.
01:52:51.440 - 01:52:52.736, Speaker C: There's different types of layers here.
01:52:52.768 - 01:53:13.340, Speaker D: You can find frames, there's groups, there's components right here. This is a frame is what a frame looks like. And this is an auto layout frame. These are this different types of shapes. So this is a line shape, which is a horizontal rule that's going right across. You can see it highlighted. You have groups or different types of layers.
01:53:13.340 - 01:53:41.090, Speaker D: So if I were to make this a component really quickly, that's what a component would look like. Or a master component. If I make a copy of it, that's what an instance of a master component would look like. So I'm just going to backpedal over here so we don't get too deep in the weeds there. But essentially there's so many different types of layers. You can have shapes, images, gifs. I mean, they're all, they'll all show up differently here just based off of their icon.
01:53:41.090 - 01:54:06.984, Speaker D: And this is where you're going to find them. And you'll see some of them are even nested. So this is the header area. And within the header area I have like the navigation for this design. And within the navigation I have like the main navigation, which are these different options over here. And if I click this little arrow, I can see all those different options. And essentially, you know, you can nest different types.
01:54:06.984 - 01:54:38.268, Speaker D: And that's how figma works. They allow you to nest frames within frames or shapes within groups. It makes it really easy for you to understand and where things are and kind of take the approach like a developer as to how to structure some of your content like within containers and so on. So that's how nesting works. And the easiest way to do that is I'm just going to take a rectangle. So I'm just going to click the rectangle tool. I'm going to take a rectangle and over here we see my special rectangle.
01:54:38.268 - 01:55:09.622, Speaker D: I can take that and put that within my header area. So you can just drag them into wherever you would like and they will show up accordingly. So I'm just going to quickly delete that by pressing my delete key. Or you can press your backspace key and that is how you get rid of the layer. So you can easily right click on a layer and see all the different options you have for it. You can even do that over here if you'd like. You can right click on a certain layer and get those same options.
01:55:09.622 - 01:55:51.742, Speaker D: By doing that here, you can drag them, reorder them, you can even delete them by pressing backspace or delete the delete key while you're selecting them. So that's essentially it for how to like kind of use them within this sidebar. But you can also double click and I can name this to like cool logo instead. So now that one's renamed. So really, really great here. That's just like easy way to rename files. I love naming all the different aspects of like my file just so it's nice and clear for me to come back to it, even share it with others so they understand like what they're looking at.
01:55:51.742 - 01:56:15.212, Speaker D: When I see things that are like frame 1204, it gets really messy. Like that's what it comes up as. And if you just make new copies, like, it's just, they mean nothing. They just mean frame one, frame two, frame three. And it's really hard to follow that. So I'm just going to delete that really quickly. Okay, so that is how you rename layers, nest layers.
01:56:15.212 - 01:56:35.058, Speaker D: You can also lock them, which I find really helpful. Sometimes you want to work on something and you don't want, like in this instance, let's say we don't want to touch the navigation. So I'll right click, click over here. You can also see the little lock. You can hide it, but you can even lock it. So once you lock it, you can't really. Oops, I'm going to lock the header.
01:56:35.058 - 01:56:58.130, Speaker D: Yeah, you can't move the header anymore. So that's really great. If you're working with like layers that are over top one another, you can easily hide it too if you just don't want to see it at the moment or lock it. So different options there. You can also do that by right clicking and going to the bottom. These are the shortcuts. Shift command l on macOS and shift command h on macOS.
01:56:58.130 - 01:57:36.950, Speaker D: And that is how you lock and unlock layers. There's also another aspect, so of this sidebar. So right now I showed you layers, now there's assets. You can come in here and create components. So an example is if I take this logo or this button is actually probably a way better example. So if I take this button and I'm just going to drag a copy by holding option on my Mac, but if I just take this button and turn it into a component, it shows up in my local components and then I can drag them from there. And now I have a responsive button that I can use anywhere.
01:57:36.950 - 01:58:13.404, Speaker D: And Figma will just throw that little tutorial up there. Really helpful for us. But that is how you would use your assets panel. And you can use components from other libraries, other projects, other people can just share libraries with you that they can control. But maybe you'd want the components in there to reuse, but this is a great way to use reusable components. Remember, if you're on a starter plan, you won't be able to use components that extensively. You will only be able to make components within your file like I just did, and use them.
01:58:13.404 - 01:58:48.504, Speaker D: So I can make this a component of oops, I'm going to grab the logo here that we made, or that I made. We're going to make this later, but I'm going to grab this logo over here and I'm going to turn it into a component. And now that logo is there. So you can use your local components, but you won't be able to access components beyond that, unfortunately. And that is the assets panel. The last thing I did want to talk about though is the pages. So you'll go back to your layers and you can see over here you're on the, the landing page or I'm on the landing page.
01:58:48.504 - 01:59:23.958, Speaker D: You can see all the different types of pages here by just clicking this little dropdown. And I can add a new page and it's going to create a new canvas for me over here. But if I go back here, I have that canvas. If I go back here, I have my cover canvas. So you can move through all these different pages as you see fit and you can create new pages. Remember, there is a limitation to the starter plan. I believe it's only three pages within a file, which isn't too bad, to be honest, many people won't really exceed that.
01:59:23.958 - 01:59:50.990, Speaker D: And some of these files already have a bunch of pages and you'll be fine using those files because I've given them to you, but you won't be able to create new pages from that. So just keep that in mind and. Yeah, and you can just delete pages. You can copy a link to a specific page. You can rename them in the same way you rename layers. You can do that all over here and you can duplicate pages as well, like I just did. And that is the left sidebar.
01:59:50.990 - 02:00:35.878, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, and welcome back. Let's jump right in because we're going to talk about the right sidebar now. The right sidebar is really where you're going to do a lot of your work. So let's jump right in. So I'm just going to click on this frame over here and I close this. So your frame is going to have, well, our frame over here that I'm, you know, the landing page frame that's housing all of this content is going to have a bunch of different things on the side here.
02:00:36.014 - 02:00:37.726, Speaker C: You'll notice that this is your like.
02:00:37.798 - 02:01:17.436, Speaker D: Alignment and distribution up here. So example is I can take say, these three things. I'm just moving really quickly here just for the sake of the demonstration, but I can take these three things and select them all and then you can tidy them up by just, you know, moving them to the top or I making them all come to the middle. You can space them out separately by clicking this over here. So distribute like horizontally the same way. And yeah, you can align them easily. So that's where you're going to get your alignment and distribution.
02:01:17.436 - 02:01:41.970, Speaker D: You can also see your frame size or just the size and orientation of your, your layer. So I have the x, the y, that's where it's positioned. I also have the width of the frame. I have the height of the frame, I have the angle. You know, you can turn things if you want. So I just threw a 90 over here. I'm just going to go back.
02:01:41.970 - 02:02:21.950, Speaker D: Command Z or control z depending on what system you're on. You can even set a border radius up here so you can see that the border radius has smoothed that corner. And that is basically all for your frame size, your orientation. You have your position on the canvas, the x and y values. Up here you have your dimensions, which is the width and the height. Another interesting thing that I want to talk about is constraints. So we have sometimes you'll have like your, just your resizing options over here.
02:02:21.950 - 02:02:45.080, Speaker D: So this one's set to fill and you can hug, like hug the content. You see how that kind of like messes up the frame a bit? We'll get into this in much more detail. But this is where it's located. You can fix the height of this. So it's a set height. You can clip your content. So if I were to go like this, you can see that that content's not showing anymore because it's set to clip.
02:02:45.080 - 02:03:14.976, Speaker D: So you can hide content beyond the frame. That's where all that is going to be. And another interesting thing is your constraints. Well, actually, let's go back here. So if I select my hero frame, constraints are going to show up here, because constraints can only show up within a regular frame. I'll get into that later, but this is what constraints look like. So left and right and top and bottom are for your vertical and your horizontal constraints.
02:03:14.976 - 02:03:41.350, Speaker D: So if I move the landing page like this, it's going to shrink with it. If I move it like this, it's going to shrink with that as well. So those are your constraints. If you have an auto layout frame, these are where your auto layout details are going to be. So we'll get into that later as well. You have the ability to create layout grids if you're into creating grids. So you can create grids if you want.
02:03:41.350 - 02:04:17.634, Speaker D: You have your layer properties, whether it's set to like pass through or darken, kind of like Photoshop a bit, and then the ability to set your fill. So if I press just that plus button, I can create new fills in here. I can also select this fill. It's turned off by default, but I can select it and, you know, color it any which way I want. Now I can remove it. You have stroke, you can set a stroke. You see a stroke just showed up on the outside, which is like a border.
02:04:17.634 - 02:04:45.390, Speaker D: So you have all your selection, colors, you have a, and in effects you can select like drop shadow, inner shadow. This is basically your bread and butter. You can even export your screen from here as well as like PNG. You can do it as PDF, SVG and JPeg. So lots of options for you there. You'll notice that text has its own as well. So text has its own properties and you can really dig deep into those properties.
02:04:45.390 - 02:05:38.400, Speaker D: The other part of this tab is you have design, now you have prototype, and prototype is really great. And this is how you would create flows together. If I have two screens and I link them together in some way, like if I click on that screen, it goes to the next. I've created a prototype and then I can access it by clicking. Plus I can also see a bunch of different things. I can choose the interaction, so whether it's on click or whether it's on hover or while I'm pressing, and once I've chosen the interaction, I can choose the destination, where is it going to? So just one frame to the next and then you can choose the animation, you can go move in, you can choose smart animate and it'll give you some cool bouncy effects that you can use. So lots of cool things that you can play with over here.
02:05:38.400 - 02:06:14.156, Speaker D: Another thing is you can define a lot of things like devices that you may see, whether it's like 1113 Pro and you can customize that all here as well. So that's what you'll do. Your prototyping stuff inspect is really great for developers to come in. So if I wanted to just jump right here and go to my button. Whoops, zooming in. So if I'm going to go look at my button over here, I can easily see all the properties for that button. I can see its height, I can see its border radius, I can see the padding involved in that button.
02:06:14.156 - 02:06:54.030, Speaker D: I can see all the actual CSS codes spit out over here. This is where her developers will really find it easy to find the elements that you've created and turn that design into code. And that is the right sidebar. Hey everyone, I want to jump right into frames. So frames are very important for creating UI in figma. So this is where the frame tool is. You could easily create a frame by pressing f.
02:06:54.030 - 02:07:42.700, Speaker D: So if I just press f, I've already have the tool selected over here. I want to just point this out really quickly because when you do create a frame, you're going to see the ability to create a frame based off of a phone size or a tablet size. They even have desktop sizes. So you can create the frame based off of that. You can also just draw it on the board, on the canvas area. So I can just draw a large frame like that and it's automatically going to say frame one. I'm going to just go back really quickly, but if I select like say the phone, it's going to automatically create that frame and also create the name for the frame or name the frame based off of the type of device.
02:07:42.700 - 02:08:21.568, Speaker D: And you can also, you know, select that frame name and, and rename it any which way you like. So frames are really great for creating content or putting your content inside. So how do you use frames? So if I have my frame selected, I can see all the properties associated with this frame. I can see, you know, its fill. I can, you know, add a different fill if I want to. I can see like its positioning, I can see its size. Basically, this is the majority of the stuff that youre going to basically see with a frame.
02:08:21.568 - 02:08:57.036, Speaker D: Now to create a frame, you can do a couple different things. So say if I have a couple of different items, so I'm going to create some squares. So I'm going to take the rectangle tool or I'm going to just press r and I'll hold down shift while I'm dragging to make a square and I'm going to make a copy by pressing option. So I have two squares here. Let's make them blue squares. So we have two blue squares here. Now you can take two items and actually select them and group them as a frame.
02:08:57.036 - 02:09:38.240, Speaker D: The easiest way to do that is either click one and hold shift and click the other. And you can do this until you decide not to do it and select a bunch. Or you can just drag over and you would select command option and g. That is for Mac Os. You can also do the same with control Alt G on Windows. So that's how you group a frame and that's the easiest way for that. Now if I wanted to take this frame away, I'm just going to just press shift command g, which is actually the same or similar command to which is on Windows, which is shift control g.
02:09:38.240 - 02:10:13.712, Speaker D: So I've selected that. Now the frame has disappeared. So I like to, you know, put frames within frames just as containers to hold my content. And you're going to see how I do that later. Okay, so you may be wondering, you have frames which are really important. Then you have groups and they may seem really similar. So if I take two items here, I'm going to hold down shift and do it.
02:10:13.712 - 02:10:38.658, Speaker D: I'm just going to press Ctrl G on windows. So I'm just going to create a group. You can also select whether you want that to be a frame. Up here you can toggle between the two. Now there's a couple different use cases for groups versus frames. Frames are really great for, I mean, a lot of things. I personally like to use groups for shapes, whether that's like a logo.
02:10:38.658 - 02:11:18.356, Speaker D: Because when you do select a group and you scale it all, the content basically retains that like dimension of the group. So it's going to shrink within every single way. It's going to scale with it. And that's really helpful for things like logos or little, like little elements that you have on the screen. So that's really helpful for that. Now, if I were to do that with a frame, you're going to notice that this is different. See, the frame acts like a box and you can have the same desired effect that a group has with a frame, but it's going to basically be a little bit harder.
02:11:18.356 - 02:11:48.078, Speaker D: You're going to have to select the items within and adjust their constraints accordingly. So over here I have the box, and I'm going to have to set it to maybe left and right and top and bottom. That means that when the frame moves left and right, it's going to move with it. So let's look at the difference between this one versus this one. So I'm going to make this one red. So it's just easier to know which one has the constraint set. So this one has a constraint set, the blue one, and I'm just going to move it around.
02:11:48.078 - 02:12:28.120, Speaker D: You see how that kind of takes on the same, same type of movement as the larger frame, whereas the red one is just kind of sticking there because right now it's set to left and top. So if I were to move the left side or the top, that's going to stick. So groups are really great for basically when you want to retain like the size of the larger group that those items are a part of. So I like to use them for shapes and things like logos and those types of vectors. Now, if I want to ungroup, that's really easy. You just shift command G. Basically the same thing as ungrouping a frame.
02:12:28.120 - 02:13:05.342, Speaker D: And for windows, that is shift ctrl G. So command G or ctrl G. Shift command G. Shift ctrl G. And that is how you create and remove groups. Hey, everyone, I want to talk about both basic shapes and boolean operations because these are some pretty cool things that you can do in Figma. So let's jump right in.
02:13:05.342 - 02:13:19.540, Speaker D: So up here in our toolbar, we're going to have our shapes and we can basically see all our shapes. We'll see our rectangle, our line, arrow, ellipse, polygon, star, and there are associated shortcuts on the left hand side.
02:13:19.840 - 02:13:23.336, Speaker C: So an example is for rectangle.
02:13:23.368 - 02:14:04.770, Speaker D: If I just press r, I have it selected and I can draw a rectangle. A rectangle basically will be able to create both rectangles and squares. Now if I select l, I have the line tool and I can make horizontal lines like that, or I can make some vertical lines. Let me just select l again. I'm holding shift because if I hold shift, I can create squares that are actual squares instead of like rectangles. If I hold shift here, I can basically create lines that are very straight and not on an angle. So if I want a vertical rule like that or vertical rule like that, I'll hold shift to do that.
02:14:04.770 - 02:14:43.598, Speaker D: So I'm just going to select those and turn them to white rolls because I'm using the dark mode in Figma and we have arrows. So that's shift l. So you could just draw an arrow like this, turn that into a white arrow. And you can set the settings here. Whether that's like a triangular arrow, you can set like the back, whether it's a little circle, you can set the stroke. So you can create arrows also within Figma, which is really helpful. You can also create ellipses in circles.
02:14:43.598 - 02:14:50.010, Speaker D: So I'm going to press o and o is going to allow me to do that. So that you can create ovals.
02:14:50.670 - 02:14:52.670, Speaker C: So you can both create ovals.
02:14:52.710 - 02:15:22.240, Speaker D: And if you hold shift, you'll be able to create circles. And these can be used as they are or manipulated to create custom shapes with curves of the lines. So you can create like pie charts like that, you know, some pretty cool stuff. I'm just gonna go back. You'll see this little dot pop up this arc, and you can create like your pie chart as you see fit. So really cool. I created like a little pac man there, but really cool feature that Figma has released here.
02:15:22.240 - 02:16:04.876, Speaker D: And we have the polygon. Polygon does not have a shortcut, so we're just gonna select that. Now, the polygon tool allows you to draw an enclosed shape that is made up of any number of straight lines. So I'm just going to draw. And the default one right now is the triangle, but I can adjust the radius. I can also adjust the count to make like hexagons and so on in octagons and, and, yeah, so, I mean, you can really create some pretty cool shapes just with the polygon tool. And then we have the star tool, which is really cool as well.
02:16:04.876 - 02:16:55.905, Speaker D: And it kind of functions very much like the polygon tool. So if I take this, I can, you know, make it a little more chunkier, I can make the radius a little more softer, and then I can increase the count or decrease the count. So lots of cool, different shapes that can come out of both the polygon and the star tool. Now, if you're really into creating unique or complex shapes, you can build your own vector networks using Figma's pen tool. And that's over here, right beside the shapes dropdown. So if I select that or, you know, if I select p, I can create these little lines and connect them to create some cool things, give that a fill. I can also go back and adjust, like the curves if I want to.
02:16:55.905 - 02:17:15.469, Speaker D: So if you're really into doing stuff like that, the pen tool is your friend. And let's talk about boolean operations. So we have the union tool. So I'm going to actually start fresh here. Just lower. I'm going to press o and get the ellipse holding down shift. And I'm going to make another one.
02:17:15.469 - 02:17:34.230, Speaker D: So now I have both of these layers. So as you can tell, this one's over this one. And if I want to make like a moon, I can select both. And here I have my boolean operations. I can merge them together. So that's your union. So I have these two circles.
02:17:34.230 - 02:17:59.840, Speaker D: Actually, let me just like, grab a square as well. Like, we can make some pretty unique things. So I have my square here or my rectangle. And I'm going to just pick a new color for it. So there's my new color and I'm going to select both and go to Boolean operation. So the union selection. So what this does is it combines the shapes into like a group.
02:17:59.840 - 02:18:26.200, Speaker D: So it doesn't matter what's overlapping, what it will essentially just become like a group like this. You're going to basically take the color from the overlapping shape in this instance. Now I'm going to undo that. And let's look at the next one. We have subtract. Now, subtract is basically the opposite of union. It removes the area of a shape or set of shapes from the shape on the bottom.
02:18:26.200 - 02:19:04.270, Speaker D: Only the bottom layer is solid and the rest are subtracted from it. So let's see. So we have like a half circle here. Now, the next one is the intersect selection. Now, this one's actually really interesting because the intersect creates a group where the shape consists only of the overlapping parts of the layers. So do you see how only this is going to show up when I select that intersect selection? And the last one is exclude. That's right here.
02:19:04.270 - 02:19:34.474, Speaker D: And exclude is essentially the opposite of intersect. Exclude only shows the areas of its sublayers that do not overlap. And that is how you use shapes and boolean operations. Hey, everyone. Welcome back. We are going to talk about images within Figma. So we are going to use a ton of images.
02:19:34.474 - 02:20:10.596, Speaker D: I mean, it's just the way it is. Whether it's for, like product images, whether it's just for like landing page images. I mean, there's so many reasons why we are going to use images, and I'm not going to get into that because I think you all know now the ways we can add images to our file, it varies. I personally like using plugins, and I'll explain what plugins are after. But the ways to add images, the two main ways that I personally like to do it is through copy and pasting. I mean, and then there's drag and drop. Then there's the third way, which is essentially importing the image through the file browser.
02:20:10.596 - 02:20:43.500, Speaker D: So I'm going to show you the easiest way to do it. An example is say you're in another file. So I'm in this file and I see this image that I really like. I can just copy it by pressing command C or Ctrl circumental and then going back to my other tab and then pasting it with command v or control v. And that image is going to show up here. Now you can also access that file on your desktop and you can drag it right into the canvas. And that's going to be totally fine as well.
02:20:43.500 - 02:21:18.018, Speaker D: You can do this with everything, frames. You can do it with like groups, anything from one file to the other. You can basically do that. So as you can tell, I just pasted the whole frame in here. So I'm just going to delete these. I'm actually going to use the other way to get one of the pictures I want in here. So if I use the rectangle tool and go down to place image, you'll see the shortcut, and you'll see that you can just click this button and it's going to prompt you to select the image that you want.
02:21:18.018 - 02:21:59.016, Speaker D: So I'm just going to go into my figma images and then I'm going to my large image png and I'm going to place all, you can just click on the canvas as well, and it's going to place that. So that's how you get a picture into your file, through importing it. Now you can edit your picture in so many different ways. Let's take a look over here to our design tab on the right sidebar. Now you can scale it. So if I want to adjust it, you'll notice that the image is actually like, it's fine. It's just kind of filling the container.
02:21:59.016 - 02:22:30.762, Speaker D: This is kind of acting like a frame in a way. It's pretty interesting. And that's why I like using pictures like this in Figma. So you can just size it like that. You can also hold, shift and size it, and it's all going to size as well. So if you want to retain that original ratio of the image that you had, you can also just adjust things like the radius. You can adjust like if it's rotated here, you can even do that here by just like spinning it.
02:22:30.762 - 02:23:03.548, Speaker D: You see this little angled cursor I have now. Now I can just take it for a spin. So that's really easy. And the other thing that I really like about images is like the settings right here within the fill. So you can choose right now it's set to fill and that's why it's moving like this. But if I said that to fit, it's going to fit basically, whether it's the fitting it horizontally or vertically. See, it's fitting the top and the bottom.
02:23:03.548 - 02:23:38.030, Speaker D: But if I shrink it or make it more skinnier, it's going to keep the original ratio of the image and it's going to just fit the width. And then you have crop. So you can crop it any which way you want. The problem with crop, though, is when you go to move it in different ways now, it's not going to keep the same aspect ratio for the actual image and you're going to skew it. So I'm just going to go back. So we have crop and we also have tile. So if your image doesn't span, I don't really use tile at all.
02:23:38.030 - 02:24:08.016, Speaker D: Probably could be useful for patterns. I personally use fill a lot and sometimes crop depending on the image, especially with like, landing pages. So that's how you can adjust some of the different types of cropping and positioning. You can also set different things like the exposure if you really want to get into some editing, the contrast saturation. I know I'm making this look really bad, but I'm just showing you all the different things you can do with a image. You know, shadows. That's horrible.
02:24:08.016 - 02:24:56.816, Speaker D: So I'm just going to reverse all of that. There we go. You can also set the blend mode over here. You know, you have multiply, darken. So if you want to do a little bit of like, you know, Photoshop kind of esque stuff, you can do that as well with some of the layers. The other great thing that I really love about Figma is that, you know, you can actually come here into the fill and adjust and add. Like if I want to add, say, a gradient, I can do that I can just add a new layer, go up here, set it to like solid, you know, set to 100%, and then you can start playing around with like, how that kind of looks like, whoops, I'm going to go back and, yeah, you can make like your own gradient if you want.
02:24:56.816 - 02:25:35.834, Speaker D: So here I can just make like a white gradient that slowly goes into white up here. So that's, that's another thing you can do with some of these figma fills over here, which is really, really interesting. And that is how you use images in Figma. Hey, everyone. Welcome back. We are going to talk about how to get started with text. Now, text is really easy to use.
02:25:35.834 - 02:26:10.582, Speaker D: First thing I'm just going to do to make it easier for everyone to see is I'm going to press f and create a frame. I'm just going to use one of the frames over here. So we have our frame now we have our text tool. And now you can just press t to get that tool and you'll be already equipped with it. So if I zoom in here, I'm going to go right in. So what I'm using, you'll notice how I can zoom in pretty easy because I'm using the command over here, the shortcut. You use what is best for you.
02:26:10.582 - 02:26:36.660, Speaker D: That's how I like to just quickly zoom in and out. I love using the shortcuts. And the easiest way to create a text layer is just by pressing down. So I've already, you know, there is the layer, it's showing up in my left side. And if I say, hello, welcome, melanie. Maybe this is like the intro text to an app. So I've created the text layer.
02:26:36.660 - 02:27:26.926, Speaker D: One thing we're going to do is we're going to jump right into here. This is what is available for you now. These are the properties for a text layer. So we've learned how to create a text layer. Now, we can resize text layers, but the problem is, you know, it's a little hard to resize text layers, so they don't necessarily shrink, but the content will go to the next line if you drag it below, you know, that may get things messed up. And the easiest way to reset once you've done something like this is to either press one of these so you can set auto width, which would mean that it's just going to go based off of the width of the content. Or you can set an auto height, but it's going to basically cut it at a fixed width.
02:27:26.926 - 02:28:04.170, Speaker D: So now I've created this width, it can still build below like, like you've noticing right now, but it's not like totally uncontrolled when it comes to like how we were initially resizing it. So that's how you resize. So I'm just going to keep it like this for now right here where it's just like totally automatic. And let's take a look at some of the text properties. So I have my font, I have the font weight. So I'm going to use like a bold on this one. Oh, maybe a little too bold.
02:28:04.170 - 02:28:16.882, Speaker D: I need semi bold. And we have our font size. So I'm going to set that to like 48. Whoa, too huge. Let's get down to 24. Okay. We have the spacing between letters.
02:28:16.882 - 02:28:47.928, Speaker D: So if I set that to like 4%, you see how the letters basically are more spread apart. So I'm going to undo that because I think they're fine right now. We can set also the line height. I like to go based off of percentages. So I like to go to say like 115% for headings, maybe 125% to 150% for body copy. I'm going to make a copy below this just so you all can see what I'm doing here. And I'm going to actually, you know, use some filler text.
02:28:47.928 - 02:29:07.540, Speaker D: So I'm going to use a plugin really quickly so I can grab some of that text. And I'm going to give it like four sentences. So you can see now it's been filled with four sentences. It's really long. So I'm going to have to shrink that text. Oops, let's do that again. Sizing to 14.
02:29:07.540 - 02:29:31.464, Speaker D: And I'm going to zoom out so I can grab it and bring it in. So there's my text. Now I'm going to bring it to 150% so the spacing between the lines is better. And set it to regular. Now we also have paragraph spacing. I've already talked about some of the resizing options here. You can make them center aligned.
02:29:31.464 - 02:29:52.870, Speaker D: This is just alignment. Right aligned, left aligned. You can have an example as if I've set the height fixed. You can adjust where the text aligns. There. Another interesting thing is you can go even into more details by pressing that more icon. And you can set the resizing in here.
02:29:52.870 - 02:30:15.156, Speaker D: Oops. You can also make it justified for an alignment. You can have underline strikethroughs. You can have paragraph spacing and indents and list styles. Yes. Figma now supports list styles, which is great. You can also specify the case style.
02:30:15.156 - 02:30:45.984, Speaker D: So really great for like things like subheadings. So that is what is available to you when it comes to the properties for text. Now I have two text layers here. Pretty cool. And that didn't take us long. And you'll be just zipping through all of this really quickly once you get your handle on text because text is one of the big types of UI elements that we're going to use a lot of. Now I'm just going to just quickly demonstrate list items.
02:30:45.984 - 02:31:38.916, Speaker D: So if you do have a list item, I'm just going to go to the very front of my list item and then just dash and a space and it's automatically going to create a list item for me. So you can create a bunch of them. I'm just copy and pasting them and you can set what type of list item they are, whether they're a numbered list or a bulleted list. So Figma also allows you to adjust the fill of text as well. So you can do that all over here in this little fill panel. And that is how you use text in Figma. Hey, everyone, welcome back.
02:31:38.916 - 02:32:05.360, Speaker D: We're going to be talking about constraints. Now, constraints are really important if you're using regular frames. And I'll get into that right now. So let's jump right in. So I'm going to press f to get my frame and I'm just going to pick any frame. I'm just going to pick this one over here. So now that we have our frame in place, what we're going to do is we're going to place some items in there.
02:32:05.360 - 02:32:43.640, Speaker D: Now I'm just going to press r to get a rectangle. I'm going to place one rectangle here and I'm going to place another rectangle below it. Now I have two rectangles. So constraints tell Figma how layers should respond when you resize the frames. So let's take a look here. If I'm going to resize my frame, you notice that the layer beneath doesn't actually move. Now this really helps you control how designs look across different screen sizes and devices.
02:32:43.640 - 02:33:12.862, Speaker D: So there's two types of constraints. You have horizontal constraints and vertical constraints. Constraints are located over here on the right sidebar. So these are horizontal and these are vertical constraints. You'll notice that it says left and this one says top. That means that when I move the left side they are going to move with it. And if I move the top side, they're going to move with it as well.
02:33:12.862 - 02:33:47.020, Speaker D: Now I want to set it to left and right and I'll leave that one at top. Now let's see what happens to this rectangle when I resize the frame. You'll notice that now it shrinks and grows. So that's pretty awesome. You can even do it in this way as well. So I'm going to leave that one I left and I'm going to do top and bottom for the vertical constraints. You'll notice that now it shrinks up and down.
02:33:47.020 - 02:34:15.510, Speaker D: You can even do things such as let's move this one just a little bit lower. For vertical constraints you can do center. So that means it's just going to stay kind of in place. Watch so it centers itself. You can do this even for horizontal constraints as well. You can do scale. This is really great if you want something to grow.
02:34:15.510 - 02:35:02.990, Speaker D: So notice how that rectangle is going to grow in height and in width as you grow the frame. Pretty cool, right? You can apply constraints to any layer within a frame. It's not possible to apply constraints to layers outside of a frame. So if we now have this layer, I'm going to just create a copy. So I'm going to do command or control c and go click outside the frame and I'm going to press command V and Ctrl V would be for windows and I'll just drag that right outside the frame. So you notice how it doesn't have the constraints on the side like it did within the regular frame. That's because it's not within a frame.
02:35:02.990 - 02:35:36.410, Speaker D: You can only apply constraints within a frame or layers within an auto layout frame. So layers within an auto layout frame and layers outside of a regular frame will have constraints. Only regular frames will have constraints. Sometimes though, you do want to resize the frame with resizing the items within. And the way to do that is to ignore the constraints. And the shortcut to hold is command for Mac and control for Windows. So let's take a look.
02:35:36.410 - 02:35:56.150, Speaker D: So if I'm going to resize this again, this is set to scale. I'm just going to leave it so you'll notice that. Okay, now I don't want to do anything. I'm just going to hold command and I can do at any point. See, I'm holding command now and it'll be control for Windows users. Now the items within are not moving. Let me just move this one out of the frame there.
02:35:56.150 - 02:36:41.412, Speaker D: But as soon as I start to let go of that shortcut, things start to scale again. And that is how you use constraints within Figma. Hey everyone and welcome back. We are going to get into how to use auto layout. So auto layout is a feature that is essentially part of regular frame. So let's jump right in. I'm going to press f to get my frames list and then I'm going to just, you know, select the first one just for the sake of our demonstration.
02:36:41.412 - 02:37:11.502, Speaker D: So, so I'm going to rename this and to rename it quickly, you can press command r or control r. And I am just going to call this my auto layout frame. And I'm just going to shrink it just a bit and I'm going to create another frame below it. And I'm just going to call this my regular frame so everyone can see the difference. Now, auto layout frames are really great if you want to have like responsiveness.
02:37:11.606 - 02:37:12.566, Speaker C: A part of it.
02:37:12.678 - 02:37:45.482, Speaker D: If you want to essentially make sure that like you can build some nice lists. It's really great for even, you know, creating like buttons that are responsive. So I'm just going to get into a quick demonstration. So I'm going to create a rectangle or a square, doesn't matter. And I'm going to place it inside both of these frames. Now when we look at the regular frame, you know, everything is as we learned before about frames. But now let's turn this into an auto layout frame over here.
02:37:45.482 - 02:38:25.588, Speaker D: So I'm going to click that frame. And if you go over to the properties panels over on the right, on the right sidebar in the design panel, you'll notice auto layout if you click that little plus button. Now it is in an auto layout frame. I'll get into what all this means in a quick second. But this allows you to adjust padding and between items, and the padding between that is horizontal and vertical. So if I were to say, add another item, like let me add another rectangle, you can just copy and paste it. You notice how the whole frame grows.
02:38:25.588 - 02:38:59.770, Speaker D: And if I add more, the frame keeps on growing. And you can even adjust how that frame works, the direction if you want it to go vertical or horizontal. And there are many more details there. You can even nest auto layout frames within frames. So I'm just going to move this one down. And like here, if you press command c and command v or control c, control v, it doesn't adjust the frame. So auto layout frames are really great for responsiveness.
02:38:59.770 - 02:39:26.446, Speaker D: Let's jump right in. So we have another frame that I want to create. So I'm going to just create two frames of two. So one and two and then another frame. So I'm going to select these ones. I'm going to hold down shift and I'm going to right click and if we go down, we can see that we can turn it into an auto layout. So we can add auto layout.
02:39:26.446 - 02:39:50.206, Speaker D: There's another frame, so, and you can see it here, it is applied as well. And I'm going to do the same over here. Right click and it's shift a as the shortcut. As you notice over here. This allows me to nest frames within frames. This is really powerful for layouts. We'll be using this in certain demonstrations as well.
02:39:50.206 - 02:40:31.350, Speaker D: But if I now say change the direction, we're not going to have four vertically. We're going to have those two frames stack on to one another and you can see how they're nested below. So we have our two rectangles up top and two rectangles at the bottom. And you can make some pretty cool grids. And you can even nest another frame within this frame if you'd wanted to. And the easiest way to add new items, you can, you know, copy and paste. You can also duplicate which is command D or ctrl djdehdeh, which will duplicate what your last action.
02:40:31.350 - 02:41:06.726, Speaker D: So I'm just going to go back with a command z and you could also reorder the object. So I'm just going to change the color here really quickly. If I use my arrow keys, I can order the object within a frame and even the frame within the other frame. So you can reorder things really quickly just using your arrow keys. Or you can click and drag, oops. Just be careful not to drag it outside the frame. And if I really wanted to just, you know, if I wanted to hide them or delete them, I can do that as well.
02:41:06.726 - 02:41:56.900, Speaker D: So I can hide them like that, or I can just delete it and it's gone. And that is how you use auto layout frames in the most basic sense. Hey, everyone, welcome back. I wanted to get a little bit more into the details of using auto layout within figma. So auto layout is, like I said, a great tool for creating some responsive designs, but there's a lot of different things that we need to learn about in order to use it effectively. So I'm going to create another frame. So here's my nice frame here.
02:41:56.900 - 02:42:26.032, Speaker D: And we're just going to call this our auto layout frame. Perfect. Now I'm going to take another rectangle and just place inside my frame. Now I'm going to go to auto layout over here on the right sidebar. And now I've created an auto layout frame. I'm going to just duplicate another rectangle within this frame. So that way we have two rectangles to work with.
02:42:26.032 - 02:42:43.704, Speaker D: Actually, let's just do three as well. So I press command D. You can even use control D. So let's jump right in. So auto load frames are really good. I mean, you can create buttons that grow or shrink as you edit the text label. You can build lists that adapt as items are added, removed or hidden.
02:42:43.704 - 02:43:08.948, Speaker D: You can combine auto layout frames to build complete interfaces. So think like cards. You have like a card portion with like the button that's in there. You have text in another frame. Mind you, the button is probably its own auto layout frame. And then you have the image that's a frame as well. So you can build these complete interfaces just with nesting all these auto layout frames.
02:43:08.948 - 02:43:30.480, Speaker D: Now let's talk about the different properties within an auto layout frame. So selecting my frame, I'm just going to go to the right here. You can select the direction. This is the direction you can do horizontal or vertical. And direction describes the way the auto layout frame will actually flow. So I'm just choosing vertical for now. You can choose the spacing between items, which is over here.
02:43:30.480 - 02:43:58.204, Speaker D: So this is ten pixels. I can choose say 24. That's perfect. Now adjusting the spacing between using canvas controls or spacing fields in the right sidebar. Now you can do it this way manually like that, or you can just go over there. Now padding is another very important part. The padding is going to be your horizontal padding, which you see over here, and your vertical padding.
02:43:58.204 - 02:44:43.136, Speaker D: And you can adjust that by either dragging it. I'm just going to select 24. You can even do that manually by using the canvas. Now the padding is essentially the empty white space between the boundary of an auto layout frame and the frame's child objects. So think of frames as like a parent, and these are little children within them. So like I mentioned, you can set padding uniformly, which is like selecting 24 and 24 here, which will, oops, not that much, that's too big. And you can also go into the nitty gritty details and just select bottom padding to be twelve and left padding to be eight or something like that.
02:44:43.136 - 02:45:19.540, Speaker D: It really depends on your use case here. Now, the other thing that I haven't mentioned is alignment. Now you need to choose how to align child objects within an auto layout frame. Both the direction of the auto layout frame and the distribution will determine what alignment options you have available. So with that being said, say I had a couple of different objects like this. And I'm going to change the direction like that. You can see this is where you can choose the alignment if I want them to be centered.
02:45:19.540 - 02:45:38.580, Speaker D: Line to the bottom, you know, to the middle. This is the middle. This is the middle, bottom, bottom. Right. You can choose all these different types of directions. If I wanted to say, make one wider. Then you'll start seeing the differences here.
02:45:38.580 - 02:46:15.302, Speaker D: So that is how alignment works. Distribution is another key part and that's hidden in this little menu, the advanced layout settings. So let's get into it. Once you set the alignment rules for your child objects in a frame, choose how those objects will then be distributed within that frame. So right now they're packed and that means that they're packed based off of the spacing between the items. If I were to select space between, now they're going to just spread a out. So let's take a look at what that looks like.
02:46:15.302 - 02:46:55.610, Speaker D: So I'm just going to make this a little smaller. Now if I extend this like that, you'll notice that the padding is just automatically spacing itself out. Now that is because it's set to space between. That's how distribution essentially works. You notice that the frame now doesn't go back and that's because it is not set to hug contents. Let's talk a bit now about resizing. This is resizing up here.
02:46:55.610 - 02:47:18.314, Speaker D: Now, one of the most powerful functions of autolayo is its ability to control the dimensions of the objects in an auto layout frame. So there's different types of ways you can resize. You can make it fixed, hug and fill. So let's take a look over here. This is set to fixed. That means it has a fixed width of 218 pixels. I'm going to fill the container.
02:47:18.314 - 02:47:42.770, Speaker D: That means it's going to fill all the way across. And this is amazing. If you want to create frames that are responsive, look at the top layer in comparison to the two bottom layers. Those rectangles are set to fixed. But say I want my frame just to hug the width of the content within. Now it's hugging the maximum width. These are still set to fixed.
02:47:42.770 - 02:48:10.108, Speaker D: Now this one is still set to fill. You can have one say set to fixed like this and then these ones set to fill as well. So that is how resizing works. It's really powerful. Now you can still apply constraints to the auto layout frame itself. If it's nested within a regular frame, the constraints section and resizing options will appear, allowing you to really set those options. If you need to.
02:48:10.108 - 02:48:41.430, Speaker D: So let's take a look here. So you'll notice if I select this, my constraints don't show up because it's in an auto layout frame. Again, my constraints are not here, but I'm going to create a new frame. If I take this and throw it inside this frame by just dragging it over and I'm going to set a stroke so we can see where it is, I'm going to center it. Now my constraints are showing up here. You can set this to anything you'd like. So the problem is left and right isn't showing up here.
02:48:41.430 - 02:49:17.000, Speaker D: That's because it's set to hugging content. So if I say set it to fixed width and leave the hugging up here, that's fine for now. Now is available and I'm actually going to select all of these items. And you can do that quickly by pressing shift and holding them or ctrl a or command a. And I'm going to set them all to fill container. And now we're going to see how responsive this gets. So you can still build responsive interfaces even with regular frames combined with auto layout frames.
02:49:17.000 - 02:50:06.046, Speaker D: This is a really great way to show how you can build some really great interfaces and that's how you use auto layout frames. Hey everyone, I wanted to teach you all what the Figma community is. Now, the great part about the design community is we love to share files. We love to share what we're doing. And making those resources easily available to one another is a big part of the Figma community. Now, how do you find files? Well, that's really easy. So you can go into this little section right when you log in.
02:50:06.046 - 02:50:48.940, Speaker D: And I'm going to go to the community and here you'll be able to find so many different things you can just explore based off what is, you know, the most recent, you know, based off of what the award winners are. I mean, this is currently what I'm looking at, trending files. There are so many different things based off of different types of categories. Even Figma produces its own types of files for you to use. This is where you're going to find plugins, files and everything in between. Let's jump right in. So the reason why you would come here is because you would like to maybe reuse something.
02:50:48.940 - 02:51:18.520, Speaker D: Now the easiest way to do that is just to basically search. Or you can go ahead and take a look at what's been trending. Let's take a look. So say I wanted to grab one of these, you know, one of these files. All I would do is I would click on the file. So this isn't interesting one. This is an auto layout one.
02:51:18.520 - 02:52:10.830, Speaker D: And then you'd be brought to that listing page or file page here you can take a look and move around with the file to see if it's something you'd like, which is a great feature because sometimes you don't want to download things that you don't want. You're not necessarily downloading them, but you'll be duplicating the file. You can heart the file up here. You can even see what discussion is happening below. You can share it, you can read more about it. Sometimes certain files that you're duplicating or certain plugins that are here will have a lot of information about where else you can read up about it, if it's something that's really complex, or if you'd like to learn a little bit more about the person who created it. Now, to get this file, what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit duplicate.
02:52:10.830 - 02:52:58.270, Speaker D: And what it's going to do is it's going to open that file for me. And what it's done is actually made a duplicate in my drafts. So if I go back to the home icon and go back and I look at my drafts, I can now see that right there, I'm in there right now. You can see my little avatar. And now I have full control over this entire file. And that is how you access free resources through the Figma community. Hey guys, welcome back.
02:52:58.270 - 02:53:28.344, Speaker D: We're going to be talking about plugins. So I have this nice little card here that I designed using some auto layout. You can see that we have some nested containers in here. Now the only thing that's missing, actually there's a couple of things missing here. I don't have a nice image and I don't have potty copy, body copy here and title copy. So I really don't know what to say. This is just going to be a placeholder, but ultimately I need some stuff to fill in my card.
02:53:28.344 - 02:54:20.674, Speaker D: Now you may be wondering, like what does this have to do with plugins? Well, the good thing is Figma offers plugins, and those plugins are created by the community. Ultimately, they're going to help you increase your workflow. So they're not going to make you think about the unimportant things like which image needs to go here and what type of copy do I need to think about here? You can think about all that important stuff afterwards and you could just worry about designing. So plugins are essentially these third party scripts or types of applications that extend the functionality that Figma has to offer. You can use these plugins to customize your experience or create more efficient workflows in Figma. And that goes the same for Figjam, too. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go home and I'm going to go to the community page over here.
02:54:20.674 - 02:54:46.340, Speaker D: You can search specifically by the category of plugins, or you can search your community. Now I'm going to just do a text search, and I know what type of plugin I want for imagery. I'm just going to search up unsplash. Now, this is a really great plugin, and I suggest everyone gets it as well. Now here we go. I'm going to the plugins tab up here. And here it is.
02:54:46.340 - 02:55:33.254, Speaker D: I'm going to install it. So when you find the plugin that you want, you can either go to the page or you can go to that list page that we were just on. And once again, you can read all the content here. You can go to the actual website, any comments, version, history, all that important information is going to be here. And then you just click that little install button, which I've done, and now it's telling me that, okay, it's installed. Now you may be thinking, what do I do now? Well, the good news is you don't have to do much. All you have to do is go back to your file, give it a right click, and then you'll notice I have unsplash here and I have alorm ipsum plugin.
02:55:33.254 - 02:56:00.246, Speaker D: You may be wondering what that is. So let's use that one first. So what I'm going to do here is I am going to click onto my text file, sorry, my text layer, go into my plugins and go to Lorem Ipsum. Now, this specific plugin, this is what it looks like. So I don't want to close it after generating the text. And I don't really want to begin with Lorem Ipsum. This is going to give me some placeholder text.
02:56:00.246 - 02:56:23.770, Speaker D: So I just want two words. Okay. And there's just a title. It allows me to just fill up my card with easy, easy placeholder stuff. So I'm going to use around three paragraph. Oh, not paragraph, sorry, three sentences. That would be way too long.
02:56:23.770 - 02:56:56.740, Speaker D: Okay. And I'm just going to resize that to fill the container and oops, there we go. So I'm just going to close that plugin, and I'm going to go over to here and space that out. That's the line height at 150%. And there we go. Now we have some placeholder text. Now let's use our other plugin so we don't really have to select anything for our other plugin just yet.
02:56:56.740 - 02:57:19.426, Speaker D: At least we're going to go into our plugins and I'm going to select unsplash. Here it is. Perfect. I love this plugin. This is one of my favorite ones. It gives me really great imagery without having to worry too much. So I'm going to go into my search and I'm just going to find something abstract.
02:57:19.426 - 02:57:42.738, Speaker D: Let's see. So it's going to give me a bunch of different options here. And that is when I'm going to select my rectangle. So this is a rectangle layer. You can use a frame layer, but ultimately what we're going to do is when you select this layer and select an image that you like, let's first find something that we like. Hmm. There are a lot of different options here, I think.
02:57:42.738 - 02:58:03.870, Speaker D: I'm going to go with. Let's go with this. Okay. So I'm going to select it. And what it's going to do is it's going to appear in the fills panel. So it's going to keep the rectangle. But now I can just remove this other fill because I don't need it, and just keep this one here.
02:58:03.870 - 02:58:32.986, Speaker D: And there you go. Now I can close this. If I didn't want to put it in here, I can just select that image that I want, and it's just going to appear in my canvas and then I can do whatever I'd like to it. I could place that inside. Let me close this plugin. I can place it inside my card. So you can do it that way, too.
02:58:32.986 - 02:59:22.850, Speaker D: Still an image layer, but yeah, that is how you use the unsplash plugin and the Lorem ipsum plugin. Remember, try to use, the plugins are going to work for you. They're going to be really great for making you create some more efficient workflows in Figma. Hey, everyone. Welcome back. I want to get into something else that is really important. Now, if you're going to be working on a design team or working with engineers or developers, working with project managers, you'll often be sharing your prototypes and your designs.
02:59:22.850 - 03:00:03.034, Speaker D: Now, you may be wondering, well, how do I share? Well, it's that big blue button right in the right corner. Now, a couple things about this. When I do click this, I have a couple of different options here. Well, several options you can actually put in their email here. You can enter that email and you can select what type of, you know, permission they have, whether that's editing or viewing. So that's, that's really great if you know their email. Or you can specify that nobody can essentially access this file.
03:00:03.034 - 03:00:53.216, Speaker D: Even if there is a link, you need to be invited to this file. Or you can say anyone with a link can view. Now, when you're on a professional account versus a starter account, you're going to have a couple little differences here. The starter account's not going to allow you to have that option to allow them to edit just yet. You're going to need to either invite them by email, or once they show up in this list, you can specify their permission, but you can have another person editing your file. Then all you need to really do, and this is what I often do when I'm interfacing with my design team and I'm telling more junior designers, okay, this is what this needs to look like, or this is what I did. I want some feedback, or I left some feedback on your file.
03:00:53.216 - 03:01:24.192, Speaker D: Here's a link. So I'll just copy that link and you'll notice that little toast come up and you just paste that link to them. And that's essentially how you share a file. Now, the real great thing is when people are in your file, you'll see their little avatar pop up beside yours. So that's my avatar right now. So you'll see theirs pop up, but they can make comments. And all you need to do to make a comment is to go to the toolbar and click this button, this little icon here.
03:01:24.192 - 03:01:59.930, Speaker D: Or you can see that little shortcut is c. So I can leave a comment there and say, whoa, cool image. And you can do a couple things when you're making a comment, you can comment directly onto a layer over here or a frame, and these will be attached to that frame. You can comment on a prototype. You can also mention people with using the sign. So I just mentioned myself. You can also add emojis.
03:01:59.930 - 03:02:24.924, Speaker D: And there's my comment. So I'm just going to press v because that's going to bring me back to my move tool. So I'm going to press v. Now, when you move this, the comment is attached. If the comment were off the frame, it wouldn't attach. Let's go back to our comments. So if I click that comment icon again, this is where I'm going to manage my comments.
03:02:24.924 - 03:02:56.652, Speaker D: On the right side. I can, you know, sort them and filter them by all comments, mentions and replies. We also have the ability to hide comments. We also have the ability to sort them here. You know, you can sort them by specific things, pages and or threads and whatever is resolved. And I'll get into that in a second. But this is where you're gonna see all your comments.
03:02:56.652 - 03:03:25.900, Speaker D: You can delete them here. You can copy a link directly to that comment. You can also resolve that comment by clicking this little icon with a checkbox. You can do that here as well. You can dock it to the side so that way you can move around and it's not over your design. You can copy a link here and delete the thread. You can also just close the comment.
03:03:25.900 - 03:03:56.550, Speaker D: But this is how you would resolve a comment. So once it's resolved, it's gone. You can however, go back into your sort and show the resolved comments. So I have one from even three days ago that's over here that shows up. So that's basically how you use comments in figma. And you should get notifications if somebody either mentions you or if there's a comment on your file. And you can adjust those notification preferences as well.
03:03:56.550 - 03:04:38.248, Speaker D: But that is how you comment in Figma. Hey everyone, and welcome back. We are in our resource right here that is available to you all. And essentially what we are going to do today is we are going to create an awesome landing page. Now, I have it ready for you all and it's in that resource. But we're going to do it side by side, piece by piece together. We're going to learn a bunch of different things.
03:04:38.248 - 03:05:06.150, Speaker D: We're going to learn how to use text layers properly within a design. We're going to learn how to use imagery. We're going to create some shapes. We're also going to use things like frames, groups and constraints. We'll also use auto layout frames for general layout and Ui element creation. And what you're going to need is the resource file. You're going to need a couple of different plugins.
03:05:06.150 - 03:05:47.162, Speaker D: I'll show those to you right now. You're going to need the Lorem ipsum plugin, which I will provide for you. So this is what it looks like. I'll provide a link for you, and you will need the unsplash plugin, which I will provide for you as well. And that is all. So let's jump right in and start creating this landing page. Hey everyone, and welcome back.
03:05:47.162 - 03:06:13.368, Speaker D: And I want to talk about logos. So this is a landing page that I created for a consultancy pretty quick in terms of you know, just the execution in general. And the logo is a pretty quick logo as well. So I'm just going to take that logo here. So let's take a look. So how did I create this logo? You'll notice a couple things here. We have a bunch of different items.
03:06:13.368 - 03:06:29.568, Speaker D: So we have shapes here. We have triangle shapes. We have a circle. We have a square. And then they are grouped in a group. And you can tell the difference between a group and a frame in two ways. A frame looks like this, traditional frame.
03:06:29.568 - 03:06:53.644, Speaker D: That's the layer, what it looks like, and a group looks like this. You can also look up here whether it's a frame or a group. So I'm going to show you how I did that. So I'm just going to work just above here and you can work with me, too. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my toolbar and select a rectangle. And I'm going to hold down shift while I create that rectangle. And there we go.
03:06:53.644 - 03:07:20.054, Speaker D: I have a square. Now I want that color. You can do a couple things here. You can either select manually through here or if you see a color on the page, you can just press I and get the color picker. Then I can select whatever color I want. So I'm going to select the red and I'm just going to leave it like that. The next tool I'm going to grab is the ellipse tool.
03:07:20.054 - 03:07:50.560, Speaker D: Instead of going to the toolbar this time, I'm going to press o and I'm going to hold down shift two to create a perfect circle. And via color picker, I'm going to select I and select a circle. And then I'm going back for the triangle. So the triangle is going to be under the polygon tool. And same thing. I'm going to hold down the shift key. Now I have my triangle and I'm going to make it yellow.
03:07:50.560 - 03:08:13.106, Speaker D: So I have three different shapes here. I'm gonna make this one a little bit bigger because it does give you a little bit of extra space here. Now you may be wondering, okay, we have some shapes. Now. What do we do so you can rotate them? This is what I did. I actually rotated them like this. This one, I mean, a circle, you don't really need to rotate.
03:08:13.106 - 03:08:36.348, Speaker D: And I'm gonna rotate like that. And there we go. I'm actually going to just leave them like this. And I'm going to select them all. Then I'm going to go up here into my alignment tools. I'm going to align them together like that. And then I'm going to rename my layers just because I am.
03:08:36.348 - 03:08:56.982, Speaker D: Oops, I spelled triangle wrong. Circle is the second one. You can see what type of shape they are as well. Let's. There we go. And this one is going to be square. I'm going to select them all and I am going to group them.
03:08:56.982 - 03:09:19.664, Speaker D: So that's going to be Ctrl G or command G. Or you can right click and go here into the menu while selecting all of them and select group selection. So now I have my group there. So let's take a look. I'm just going to rename it logo. And there we go. That's all it really takes to create a group and a logo.
03:09:19.664 - 03:09:58.790, Speaker D: So you could go ahead and you can do a bunch of different things here. You can either leave it at that or if you're feeling a bit ambitious, you can try and create something a little bit more original than using basic shapes. Say I wanted to make a circle, and then underneath that circle, I wanted to create another circle. I know I'm moving a little quick here. So you can overlap shapes. You can even select both of them and go into your boolean operations and I can say subtract. And now I have a pretty cool shape here.
03:09:58.790 - 03:10:35.760, Speaker D: And that is essentially how you can just make some pretty unique shapes by using basic shapes, essentially. But I'm going to delete that one for now. So this is our logo. And what I'm going to do is I am going to just create another large frame because we're going to create it side by side. And I'm going to show you how to do that. So we're just going to put that here, just so we know that is available to us. So we have that landing page ready and we could put it side by side.
03:10:35.760 - 03:11:05.014, Speaker D: And now we have our logo asset. So we're just going to move that over here. And there you go. Hey, everyone. Welcome back. I want to talk about something really cool now. And that is auto layout buttons.
03:11:05.014 - 03:11:33.486, Speaker D: So let's jump right in. I'm just going to copy this right here. Let's copy that and just drag it. Same thing here. Okay, so now I have two buttons. These are both auto layout buttons and we're gonna create them together. So a lot of people like to create buttons with rectangles in the back.
03:11:33.486 - 03:12:15.460, Speaker D: And I personally don't like that. So you'll see somebody go like, basically they'll grab, you know, just the text layer and then they'll take rectangle and do this. And I'm just gonna move it to the back here. So, but they'll do something like this and then they'll maybe put in a frame and then they'll have to deal with constraints and, you know, things not working properly because then you have like a couple of different things you have to worry about. You'll have to worry about maybe the constraints or the resizing of the actual frame and also that of the rectangle within. So this is a no no. Let's, let's avoid that.
03:12:15.460 - 03:12:48.360, Speaker D: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually keep that text layer now I'm going to remove the rectangle. I'm going to take this text layer and I'm going to group it again. So remember, if you need the shortcut, just right click and you'll see it over here. So I framed it already using the shortcut. And I'll call this my button. And then I'm going to auto layout now because I'm selecting this button frame right here. I'm going to press I and grab this color.
03:12:48.360 - 03:13:18.484, Speaker D: You'll notice that it didn't pop up. That's because it's hidden. So don't be scared if that happens. Here, I can now adjust padding and I can also set like fixed heights. I like to set fixed heights on my content when it's like a button that's not going to reach like a second line. So I'll just bring that height to 48 pixels and then I'm going to start building it with auto layout. So we have that selected.
03:13:18.484 - 03:13:45.318, Speaker D: The direction doesn't matter here. Neither does the spacing between the items because we don't have an icon in there. So it's not really going to matter here. We can actually start to the horizontal spacing, the padding. And I'm just going to select something like 32 and I'm going to make sure that this is aligned in the middle. That's really nice. And I'm not going to worry about the vertical padding because I don't really need it.
03:13:45.318 - 03:14:02.990, Speaker D: I set a fixed height on this, as you can see up here. And you don't really need to worry about that. The other thing is the border radius. You can adjust that over here. I'm going to set it to four. Let's see what that looks like. That looks really nice.
03:14:02.990 - 03:14:43.450, Speaker D: So there's a couple things you can do with buttons here. You can either set them to a fixed width like this. So if you want really long buttons or you can set it to hug the contents. And hugging the contents means that it's going to essentially be hugging the width of whatever's within plus the padding. So you'll see the paddings over here is at 32 pixels. Now you may want to make a bunch of different buttons. I like to have a couple different variations.
03:14:43.450 - 03:15:27.050, Speaker D: So I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this one by clicking in pressing command D. I'm just going to drag it below and I'm going to make this version. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to bring down the text to, let's say 14. I want this to be a transparent button like this. So what I would do here is I would remove the fill and set a stroke. So I'm going to press the little plus button on the stroke. And from here I can click on this color, click the color picker and then take that same blue, same thing for the fill.
03:15:27.050 - 03:16:19.006, Speaker D: Now one thing you may be wondering is, oh my goodness, this is a little bit of a large button. So we can just shrink that down, say 32 I think is fine. And then we can adjust the padding accordingly. And now we have a primary and a secondary button. And that is how you make some quick buttons using auto layout. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So the next part of this tutorial we're going to jump right into the navigation.
03:16:19.006 - 03:16:40.606, Speaker D: So let's click in here. So I have it set up as a header. That's what I've named it. And you can tell it's an auto layout frame just by its icon. I've actually nested a couple things within. So I have the navigation and then I have a horizontal rule that rules that long horizontal line that goes across. I'm going to teach you how to build this navigation.
03:16:40.606 - 03:17:15.500, Speaker D: So we've already built a couple pieces of it. We've built the secondary button and we've built the logo. Now let's work on the text. So I'm going to just work just above so you can see them both together and we're going to group them into a frame. So let's jump right in. So I'm going to just select the text icon with my shortcut and I am going to start typing some options here. So I have home and now I'm going to duplicate it about four times.
03:17:15.500 - 03:17:41.990, Speaker D: Oops. There we go. There we go. And there we go. So I have about, so I'm going to type about. I have our work, services and careers now when you're working on navigation items. They all have different states.
03:17:41.990 - 03:18:03.962, Speaker D: They all just look the same. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select them all and use the color picker. And this is going to change the color for every single one of them. I like this color I used, so I'm going to do that. You can also change the textiles. So let's take a look at that. So I'm going to have two different states here.
03:18:03.962 - 03:18:26.552, Speaker D: For now. You'll probably have three. You'll probably have something like an active state and a hover state and a default state. This looks like a default state and we should probably have some sort of hover state. I'm not going to really get into that right now. I'm just going to show what the active state is and the default state. And I'm just going to select regular for the default state.
03:18:26.552 - 03:19:08.980, Speaker D: And now because we're going to be on the homepage, I'm just going to select this one to be semi bold and we're going to steal that color again. I'm going to find it down here in my document colors. And that's essentially how we can start creating our navigation items. I'm going to select them all again, but this time I'm going to rename them altogether. I'm going to press command r and it will be control r for Windows users. Over here where we have the batch renaming modal and you can either, you know, put their current name in. That's the sign for the current name.
03:19:08.980 - 03:19:56.922, Speaker D: Some people like to have like them all named the same and then maybe some sort of variation afterwards that says like v one or v two or something like that. It's totally up to you, but I'm going to rename them all to nav item. And the reason I'm doing this is just so I know exactly what they are. And the next thing I'm going to do is since these are all essentially hugging their content, you can tell that from over here they're at auto width. I'm going to select them all and I'm going to group them into a frame and I'm going to rename that frame by pressing command r. And I'm going to just call it navigation items. And then I'm turning into an auto layout frame.
03:19:56.922 - 03:20:28.480, Speaker D: Pretty sure you guessed that by now. And you can select the spacing I'm gonna select. I think 32 pixels is fine. You don't really need to select the alignment. They're all essentially the same here, but they're gonna be spaced out horizontally in that direction and I'm not worrying about anything else. I just want this to, you know, be responsive if I need to add another navigation item or like, remove one, like it's all going to work together. So now I have my navigation item here.
03:20:28.480 - 03:21:13.728, Speaker D: Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to start bringing this into the frame. I'm going to take this button as well because we're going to complete our navigation and I'm going to take this logo group. Now, I think the logo group is fine. We can either move it or I'm actually going to keep it at that same size. I like having a group here because I can essentially, you know, manipulate it and the contents within the shapes are going to take that form as well. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take all of these, select them all while holding, shift and group them into a frame. You may be thinking, my goodness, frame after frame after frame.
03:21:13.728 - 03:21:58.890, Speaker D: And I promise you it is so worth it because you are going to create some really beautiful designs and you are going to have really clean files looking like this. Now, this is a regular frame. Now we are going to turn it into an auto layout frame. Again, we are not going to worry too much about the actual width, but I am going to actually make it span all the way to the edge. Now I want it so that all the content is spaced across from each other, away from each other and not packed in. So what that means is I want this on the left side, I want this on the far right side, and I want this content to be centered in the middle. So let's do that.
03:21:58.890 - 03:22:23.980, Speaker D: So I'm going to go into my advanced options here. Right now it's set to 64 pixels. And instead of spacing mode at packed, I'm going to select space between. And there we go. The only thing here is now we just need to ensure that the width is fine. Leave the padding around the sides here. So I'm going to select, let's do 30.
03:22:23.980 - 03:22:56.124, Speaker D: Actually, let's do maybe 56 pixels. There we go. So now we have 56 pixels for the spacing. And I think that works perfectly. Now, the last part is we need to get a horizontal rule like here. Now to do that, I'm going to go into my shapes and you can press l as well. Now I have my line tool and I'm going to hold down shift while I click and drag.
03:22:56.124 - 03:23:19.200, Speaker D: And it's only going to let me go into 45 degree increments. In terms of the angle, but I'm just going to hold it like this and make it straight. Right now it's black and we don't want that color. We want something a little bit lighter. Something like that works perfectly well. And I'm going to rename it. And there we go.
03:23:19.200 - 03:23:52.650, Speaker D: And I'm sure you've guessed it, but now we are going to group this into a frame again. So I'm just going to use a shortcut here. And there we go. So we have a frame, I'm going to call it header like I did in the previous file, or a frame that I'm showing you over here. And I'm going to make that an auto layout frame. And the thing that we need to do here is we need to adjust the spacing. Now, I think 24 pixels is sufficient here.
03:23:52.650 - 03:24:12.804, Speaker D: That's kind of what it looks like there. Not that we're trying to match it pixel by pixel. And you'll notice one thing, the rule is out of place. It doesn't go all the way. So we're going to have to resize it. And the easiest way to do that and make it responsive is to go up here. So I'm going to fill that container.
03:24:12.804 - 03:24:42.588, Speaker D: And now we have it spanning the entire width. So let's take a look here. It's making me select. Okay, so now you'll notice one thing. The line moves the horizontal roll, but the navigation doesn't. And that's because we need to set it to fill the container. If you select hug contents, it's going to hug the contents and it's not.
03:24:42.588 - 03:25:07.250, Speaker D: It's going to be packed instead of actually having the space between. So don't do that. Perfect. Now we've created our navigation. Whoops. See, it's trying to make me set the horizontal padding there. The last thing I do is just give it a top padding of 24 pixels and then I can place it up here.
03:25:07.250 - 03:25:55.410, Speaker D: And there we go. We have a pretty cool navigation. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. We are going to now work on some of the text elements here and we're going to start grouping this with some of our UI elements, like our button. So let's get right into it. Now, the easiest way to do this is to just press the text layer so t and then you'll want to define what your heading looks like. So sometimes I'll like just write headline or header or title or something like that.
03:25:55.410 - 03:26:26.296, Speaker D: And I'll grab a large, large font size. Then I'll look for the font. I want. In this case, we're using Merryweather. I'm just going to use regular and I'm going to grab the color by pressing I. There we go. Now, you can use the text I used, or you can go ahead and use one of your plugins like Lorem Ipsum.
03:26:26.296 - 03:26:49.700, Speaker D: I'm going to use Lorem ipsum for this particular tutorial. But I'm going to select this layer because Lorem Ipsum won't work unless you select layer. So I'm going to select a layer and I'm going to just write one sentence. And there we go. We have our sentence. Perfect. That's great.
03:26:49.700 - 03:27:19.562, Speaker D: That looks okay. Now, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to duplicate this and drag it down, and I'm going to find something more along the lines of some nice, subtle body copy. So I am going to grab that color right away. And I definitely urge you all to, you know, experiment a bit. See what you like. Oops. That's source.
03:27:19.562 - 03:27:30.346, Speaker D: Any sorts. Source sans pro. I like that one. Like I said. Yeah. Do you think is, you know, going to be best for your content? Not everything is going to be perfect. Maybe you don't want some body copy here.
03:27:30.346 - 03:27:50.720, Speaker D: And I mean, that's totally fine. 18 pixels maybe. Okay. And I think that's fine. And once again, I'm going to grab the plugin and I want three sentences. Great. So I have that.
03:27:50.720 - 03:28:17.824, Speaker D: Perfect. And I am just going to increase the line height. Now this is essentially where we are now. Now what we're going to do is we basically have this. And I'm actually going to just step away from there for now. So we have some copy here. And you may be wondering, well, I want my copy maybe to be responsive or I want to group it so it's easier to move around.
03:28:17.824 - 03:28:54.860, Speaker D: And like I said, what I'll usually do here is first I'll just rename this to like title or header or something like that, or headline. And I'll rename this to like body. That way they'll have like a similar type of naming convention. And I'll select both of them. Right click, click. And I am going to frame that selection and select auto layout here. Now I have my frame here and I am going to go into the spacing and select something reasonable like 16 pixels.
03:28:54.860 - 03:29:26.830, Speaker D: Now this button, lets throw that in here. This is our primary button that we made. Now this is the one problem with auto layout. You're going to have to nest frames. And I think one of the big reasons is because you don't sometimes want the same spacing between elements like we see here. So I'm going to take my text layers again because I want them to be closer and the button to be more further down. And I'm going to frame them using that shortcut.
03:29:26.830 - 03:29:45.668, Speaker D: And you can find that shortcut here. And I'm going to make them an auto layout frame again. And I'm just going to call this copy or text. It really doesn't matter. Whatever works for you and whatever is clear. And I'm going to set it to fill the container. And there we go.
03:29:45.668 - 03:30:27.708, Speaker D: And I'm going to select all the layers within and set it to fill container as well. And there we go. Now we can go ahead and select a larger spacing between the text content and the button. And that is essentially how we can create our own text layer here. Now we can do a couple things. We can leave it as is because right now nothing's responsive. So we can go into here and go into our constraints because it is an auto layout within a regular frame.
03:30:27.708 - 03:31:11.422, Speaker D: I hope you all remembered that little distinction about constraints and set that to left and right. We can also set this to left and right. And now when I select it, everything's a bit responsive. So I'm going to leave it at that. And that's how you create text layers and create responsive layouts within. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. We are going to get into some fun stuff over here.
03:31:11.422 - 03:31:43.710, Speaker D: We're going to talk about some of these images and shapes, and we're gonna get into how to get these images, how to lay them out, you know, working with fills. Let's jump right in. So the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna use a frame. It doesn't matter. You can use a frame or a rectangle. I'm just gonna create a frame here, and I'm just gonna call this large image. And what I'm gonna do is I am going to go into my plugin and I'm going to unsplash.
03:31:43.710 - 03:32:12.304, Speaker D: So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to essentially just grab an image. Maybe whiteboarding is a better image. Oh, there's one of them. So we can actually go here and duplicate this frame and call it small image. We found the exact image here, actually. That's kind of funny. So we got that image.
03:32:12.304 - 03:32:30.032, Speaker D: We have it ready already. So that's great. And I don't know, these people look like they're brainstorming. Maybe we'll find something along the same lines. Okay. I think this one's going to actually suffice. So I'm going to close my plugin.
03:32:30.032 - 03:33:06.460, Speaker D: So now I have my images, my large and my small image. And what we're going to do here is we're just going to actually start working in this area. I'm going to layer them now. I didn't do anything super crazy, to be honest. I'm going to just select them together and group them in a frame. So they're grouped in a group. Right now I'm just going to select a frame and I am just going to call this imagery.
03:33:06.460 - 03:33:47.310, Speaker D: Now, I wouldn't worry about resizing the frame or anything. I'm just trying to get a sense of, you know, how I want to lay this out. I'm going to bring that because I think, yeah, I think it can be like a full width almost. And this content over here, we can even apply a stroke to it. So I'm going to apply a white stroke to give the kind of like cutout effect that I've got going on here. So I'm going to apply a stroke and then I'm going to create a larger width on that stroke. So I'm going to call it something like ten, maybe 20 is enough.
03:33:47.310 - 03:34:26.106, Speaker D: Let's see, even 32. Okay, so 32, that's going to work for us. And you can essentially either specify if you want in the center or outside, we'll just use it on the outside. So now that we have our images, I'm actually just going to place them within our frame over here. So we have our frame with our images. We're not worried about responsiveness just yet. We're just trying to think through.
03:34:26.106 - 03:34:38.618, Speaker D: Okay. Like, I like this placement. It looks nice. It looks kind of natural. And I want this to be underneath here. So what we're going to do is we're just going to drag it up. Whoops.
03:34:38.618 - 03:35:06.560, Speaker D: We're going to drag the frame up. And right now it is above. So you can do a couple things here. You can either. This is our text layer, so let's just name that quickly. We can either drag this to the very top or you can say, you could do something like this, you can right click on here and send to the back or bring to the front. So a couple different options you have there.
03:35:06.560 - 03:35:33.430, Speaker D: So now I have my layer. What I'm going to do here is I'm going to maybe shrink it a bit like that. And I bring this in. I'm going to bring this in as well. Okay, that's good. The problem is this part is not easy to read. So let's make that a little easier and remove this layer.
03:35:33.430 - 03:35:53.812, Speaker D: And I'm going to add a new one now. It's only going to come in at 20% and I'm going to change that to 100. Don't be scared. It's just black. And we're going to change that immediately. So I'm going to select linear because we're going to make a gradient of. So we have white and this is the end of the gradient down here and make that white as well.
03:35:53.812 - 03:36:36.890, Speaker D: But it's at 0%. So that gradient kind of tapers off. See how that works? So we can get a little, you know, we can make it come in from the top there in the corner and adjust that nicely just so we can make sure that users will be able to read this and we can even adjust that. And that's how you can make a gradient on top of an image. Already you don't need an image to make a gradient. You can use just like a regular shape. And I think that's going to suffice for now for our images.
03:36:36.890 - 03:37:23.354, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, and welcome back. We are going to be talking about this little section over here. We have some little shapes, actually, I would say large shapes, but they do derive from our actual originals here. So I'm going to show you how to make these cool shapes on this side. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually take these shapes and duplicate them or I'm just going to copy them and paste them. So I'm going to copy, I'm going to go into my frame here and command v. So I have my little shapes here.
03:37:23.354 - 03:37:58.410, Speaker D: I'm just moving them down while holding shift and arrow keys so you can move them. It's faster to hold, shift, shift. So I'm going to select my frame and I'm going to make sure that it's not set to clip content because I want some of these shapes to come outside a little bit. And I'm going to go into here and I am going to ungroup this layer. Hopefully everyone remembered how to ungroup, but if you didn't, don't worry about that. Just right click and the options there with the shortcut once again. So I'm going to ungroup that layer and we can do a couple things here.
03:37:58.410 - 03:38:32.090, Speaker D: You can see on this example. I've rotated them in different ways and I'm using strokes. Now let's get into how to use strokes and create these dotted lines. So I am all over the place with this. Okay, so we have our square. I'm going to make this a little bit larger and I'm going to make it over this guy's head. And what I'm going to do is I am actually just going to create that stroke right away, select a color.
03:38:32.090 - 03:38:46.894, Speaker D: And there we go. We have a stroke. And I'm going to remove the fill. So the stroke is kind of hard to see. That's fine. I'm going to select four pixels as the stroke width. And from here we can go into our advanced stroke settings.
03:38:46.894 - 03:39:19.426, Speaker D: If you wanted to, you can have, you know, one stroke at the top or the right, or you can set it to custom. But we're not going to get into that just yet. We're going to go into our advanced stroke settings and we are going to set the style to dash. And there we go. We can specify the amount that we want. Do we want more space between the dash? Do we want less space? I'm going to say we want more space to start. So that is how you create strokes.
03:39:19.426 - 03:39:50.098, Speaker D: Let's keep on going. So we have a circle. I'm going to bring the circle down here like it's circled around this little area like a sticky. And I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to go here, go into my strokes, select the color I want, which is blue, remove the fill, select maybe, I don't know, let's say two. And we are going to go into our advanced settings, set it to dash. And I actually like four on this one.
03:39:50.098 - 03:40:31.280, Speaker D: I like the little spacing that we get and it's almost kind of like a dotted line. Okay. You can also set the dash, captain, to a circular, rounded edge. So we'll just do that. I like that look, too. And then we're going to be really simple with this one. I'm going to make this one one of the largest ones because, and I'm going to tell you this right now, modern design principles still apply to the web.
03:40:31.280 - 03:41:09.850, Speaker D: So what I'm saying and where at least I'm trying to get across here, let's just bring that above, is that we can use certain things like arrows or just the way we outline or place our images to point users eyes in a certain direction. I want them pointed right towards that button. That's like the main CTA here. So I'm going to set that stroke. Where is that yellow? There we go. Remove the fill and set this to something like ten. We can make that yellow a little bit more darker and easier to see.
03:41:09.850 - 03:41:38.656, Speaker D: And there we go. We have some pretty cool shapes over here. Now, they're all within this frame. They're all contained. And I think that's it for the most part. This is how you use images and shapes within Figma. Hey, everyone.
03:41:38.656 - 03:42:25.332, Speaker D: Welcome back. Now, we are at the very end of our project, and you probably have something that looks maybe similar to this, or you have some sort of web page that you've put together. Now, the. The one thing that I like to talk about is now if we take a look at the resource that's given to you, use your right and left spacing and just resize, you will notice a couple things, like this thing is responsive. Now, how are we going to get that same effect for ours? Let's take a look at what I have so far. So nothing there is responsive. The only thing that has kind of responsive here is the nav.
03:42:25.332 - 03:43:00.040, Speaker D: This isn't working the way I want it to. So a couple things. Let's work on these pieces. What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to put them together and I'm going to group them into a frame. I'm going to rename them, and I'm just going to call it hero. Kind of like a hero image or something like that. Now, I'm going to make sure that is the full width and the full height, but I'm going to leave this to the right.
03:43:00.040 - 03:43:22.910, Speaker D: I'm going to leave it fixed in terms of its width. Now let's go into our hero frame. This can also stay as an auto layout frame because we have random shapes all over the place. They're little. It's a little different when you have things that are overlapping. You can't really do that with auto layout. Okay, let's do this.
03:43:22.910 - 03:43:44.822, Speaker D: Let's do this. Perfect. Let's work on the text first. So I want the text to be off of this page by a wide margin and I want it to fill the container. So let's go in here. Let's go into our spacing. And on the far left, I'm going to set something like 120 pixels.
03:43:44.822 - 03:44:08.718, Speaker D: That way it pushes everything over and then go into our text and ensure that it is actually set to fill. So what this is going to do is it's going to fill, this is going to be responsive, and this is going to remain the same. So when I start to move it like this, let's sit. There we go. We got fixed content. Sorry. You got to set the constraints on that left and right.
03:44:08.718 - 03:44:40.620, Speaker D: So when we start moving this, the hero should respond like that. Now we have some issues here with some spacing. So let's go into our hero container, our frame, and we can set that spacing. So I'm going to take a big chunk, maybe 56. Maybe that's not enough. Let's try that again. How about something like 80 or more? We can even do something like maybe like one, not 1120.
03:44:40.620 - 03:45:01.870, Speaker D: There we go. That seems a bit better. So we have a lot of spacing because we remember that we have this arrow that's hanging out of the frame. Okay. I think that's basically it for the text. And our text is centered. That's because we have it, the alignment set like this.
03:45:01.870 - 03:46:00.168, Speaker D: Let's do some work over here on the images. Now a couple things. I think it's fine when we're moving like this, but what about when we're doing this? Okay, so the easiest way to do that when we're expanding from top to bottom is to ensure that this frame is going to not only be fixed, but it's actually going to fill that auto layout container. So regular frames can fill auto containers as well. I'm going to leave the horizontal resizing to fixed. Now we're going to have to go inside to this container to play around so we can start working on, you know, some of the spacing. I'm going to bring this down here like that and I'm going to make sure that this is set to right and bottom.
03:46:00.168 - 03:46:37.074, Speaker D: So that means when I resize it, it's going to come in on the right, but it's also going to, oops, stick to the bottom. So we got to make sure that is set. This one's going to set to fill. And let's go back into that small image. Perfect. The square is fine. We can set that to center because we just, we're not really going to worry too much about how these work too much when they are responsive.
03:46:37.074 - 03:47:14.540, Speaker D: Center is fine as long as like they kind of have some movement. Same with this. Perfect. Now this larger image, I'm going to have that come down a bit like here. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure when we scale from top to bottom, this is going to stretch as well. So we know that is working this way. Let's see how this is starting to shape up.
03:47:14.540 - 03:47:44.246, Speaker D: Okay. So one thing I noticed is our constraints aren't working properly. That's because we haven't set the constraint for top and bottom here. So let's do that again. Okay, now we got something going here. Now we can fine tune here. This is set to left.
03:47:44.246 - 03:48:15.480, Speaker D: That's fine. This one can be set to bottom so it maybe follows this sticky. This one too. Bring that here over this guy's face and we'll set this one to bottom. So let's take a look now. Okay, some more fine tuning we have here. We have the square.
03:48:15.480 - 03:48:51.166, Speaker D: So it is set to bottom left. Oops. Perfect. And for some reason that one isn't working properly. But that's okay. We're going to bring it down. I think we can settle with something like center.
03:48:51.166 - 03:49:39.350, Speaker D: Let's see how this one works now. But that is essentially what you're going to need to do to create a pretty awesome layout. Sometimes things can get a little finicky, like you're witnessing with how this one's working, but that one isn't. But don't let that to tear you. I mean, ultimately, look at what we created with just some shapes, some basic images, some text, ui elements. We created a whole responsive layout pretty quickly and that's how you create a pretty quick landing page in Figma. Hey everyone, welcome back.
03:49:39.350 - 03:50:39.940, Speaker D: We're going to be talking about user flows today. So what are user flows? I see this question thrown around a bunch and people always say they are working on them but never really present them at all. So what are they? Well, userflow is essentially a series of steps like we have illustrated over here. And it is a series of steps a user takes to achieve a meaningful goal. So why do we use them? Well, you may be thinking, you know, are these wireframes? Are these like some part of our sketches? Well, I mean, they are used to communicate the intended flow of a user through various pages and actions in an app or website. So how do we make them? Well, your flow should include a name, steps, users, and a description of what happens at each step. So I really like this quote, but Ryan Singer from Basecamp created a great shorthand for user flows and he actually calls them UI flows.
03:50:39.940 - 03:51:26.976, Speaker D: It's basically what the user sees and then what they do, and then the next step is what the user sees next and what they are going to do next. It's really simple, but ultimately, user flows are just another method that designers are going to use to define their product experience, websites, etcetera. But wait, it isn't just another method. It's not just like sitemaps or it's not just the same as just sketching. They have the ability to define sections of something abstract or technical from the perspective of the user. The most important thing about user flows is that they outline the goal your user achieves by completing the flow. So here's an example.
03:51:26.976 - 03:52:01.842, Speaker D: This is a very basic user flow. Step one, a user goes to a welcome screen. Step two, they use a social login, maybe step three, and they get instant access to the product. That is as simple as it gets. So why do they help, you may be asking. Well, I mean, they are the best way to solve the issue of communicating the way we want our products to work and the way users interact with our products. They also help us think about our product and the users who interact with it.
03:52:01.842 - 03:52:29.360, Speaker D: In three simple questions. What is the goal of this thing? So we want them to register for the product. In this example, who is doing it? Well, a general user who is external from the product is doing this right now. And how do they do it? Well, they go to the welcome screen, they use a social login, and they get instant access to that product. Let's take a look at the process in a bit more detail. Before we begin. We need structure, we need foundation.
03:52:29.360 - 03:53:01.770, Speaker D: Gone are the days of creating these massive user flows that are sprawling all over the place, and they really lead nowhere. And they're hard to just comprehend if you're not the person who created them. So step one is, what is the purpose of your user flow? You really need to name your flow. It's as simple as that. Give it a name that describes its purpose. That is the goal the user achieves by completing the steps. And surprisingly, people often miss this.
03:53:01.770 - 03:53:36.740, Speaker D: Step two, right here. Despite popular belief, user flows go in one direction. You don't want to be going all over the place. Limit your decision points in each flow so you can avoid crazy huge site maps and huge prototypes. Yes, it's okay to have multiple decision points, like what we see here, and multiple prototypes and a sitemap. We'll get into that later. But when we want to convey a distinct interaction, user flows work best.
03:53:36.740 - 03:54:26.094, Speaker D: That's the big difference. And why is this the case? Well, they tell a story, and it's far easier for anyone to remember than a large product map or a series of cards in whatever tool you're using, like, like Jira or GitHub issues, et cetera. The third piece of the process is they represent a complete task to ensure that your product is organized. The scope of each flow should be a single task or a goal for your user. You shouldn't be having massive, you know, you shouldn't have massive user flows that have like three or four different endings. You really want to just hone in on, like maybe one or two. Maybe there's a successful and unsuccessful path over here, and ultimately that's going to be maybe something.
03:54:26.094 - 03:55:09.086, Speaker D: Like you've applied for something and you didn't get accepted. So remember, keep those user flows concise. If they're too short, then you fail to tell a story, and if they're too long, then they lose their meaning. Remember, your user flows should be the clearest model of your product, and you can do that if you follow the rules I just laid out. Hey, everyone. Welcome back. I know I explained what user flows are, but I really want to get into some details about the things you should do and things that you shouldn't do.
03:55:09.086 - 03:55:39.820, Speaker D: So let's start. User flows show the purpose of what you are trying to create. So don't do this. Don't be vague. Vague? User flows and names hide potential complexity, and it really doesn't communicate enough information back to the viewer. Instead, let's move up over to here. Instead, you should use more descriptive names like add user payment details in comparison to just profile or something like that.
03:55:39.820 - 03:56:07.474, Speaker D: Organize them into also separate flows if you need to. If you have something that's a little bit more complex. By naming your flows, you're able to design from the user's perspective, and you can split goals based off of their goals. Another don't. Let's get over to over here. Okay, I see this a bunch, especially from junior designers. Your flow should always go in one direction.
03:56:07.474 - 03:56:36.660, Speaker D: Basically, don't do this where you have these flows that are sprawling. I mentioned this in the past, but confusing flow maps are the absolute worst. These work as a good sitemap or to show the way the navigation works in your product. But ultimately, these aren't essentially what a user flow is. Instead, you should do this. Split them into distinct flows, and categorize. Let's move on to the next one.
03:56:36.660 - 03:57:03.346, Speaker D: Here it is. Okay. A very important part of a user flow is its details. Don't do this. Don't add in useless information, and don't miss the key information. We need to know the details the user needs to take to complete a task and the actions instead. Let's take a look at a better example.
03:57:03.346 - 03:57:42.450, Speaker D: This is what you should be doing. Add the right amount of detail, outlining each step and goal. This way anyone can read and understand your flow. So these are the do's and don'ts of creating user flows. If you follow them to a t, you should be good to go. Hey everyone, and welcome back before we start, I want to talk about what we are going to be building today. So we're going to be working on our own user flows.
03:57:42.450 - 03:58:31.422, Speaker D: You'll have available assets over here in the assets page where you can use these different types of containers containing different types of like blocks of text, imagery. We have buttons and form elements and all that kind of stuff. So you'll have all this available to you to just use right out of the gate. I'll go into in a bit more detail on how to create some of these things really quickly, but that really shouldn't hold you up too much. The purpose really, that we want to focus on is actually creating some really amazing user flows. So I'll be working on three different types, and these are the user flows that we're going to have at the end of our tutorial. And we are going to need a couple of things.
03:58:31.422 - 03:59:17.590, Speaker D: So we'll have those assets and we're going to need a plugin. And that plugin over here is called Autoflow. Now, you may be wondering, you can use these arrows that I've created, or you can go ahead and actually use that plugin called Autoflow. I'll make that link available for everyone, but this makes it really easy to just connect flows. So all you need to do to use auto flow is hold or click on a device, click on another device while holding shift, and it's automatically going to create the arrow for you. So totally up to you what you want to do. If you want something a bit more like custom and different types of spacing, I mean, you have to go this route.
03:59:17.590 - 04:00:14.734, Speaker D: If you did want to create a user flow just really quickly, I would definitely suggest using this plugin. Super helpful, and it's going to come in handy in a lot of different areas in design. So let's get right into it and have some fun. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. Before we actually jump into the fun stuff of creating our own user flows, I want to just talk about something that's really important here. When you are creating a bunch of user flows, you really want to be efficient and you want to speed up your workflow as much as possible. You don't want to be spending time and time on trying to get like a perfect box or making sure your user flows are like high fidelity, because they really don't need to be.
04:00:14.734 - 04:01:00.700, Speaker D: They can be really simple. Now, in this page over here called assets, I have a bunch of different types of assets and what these are, they kind of look like wireframe assets, to be honest. Now, the best thing we can actually do here is we need to think about all the different types of assets that we could possibly use and we can keep it really simple. So what I've done is I've created a one column bunch of assets. So like just an image or image and you know, like text and you know, there's like some subheading and a heading and all that kind of stuff. I also have a grid here as well, all using auto layout. It's really simple stuff.
04:01:00.700 - 04:01:27.548, Speaker D: And I'll show you how to create a couple of these different things. But. But I've created like even three column products based off of our client and what we want to build. And I've also created just plain text pieces over here. Then we have some like inputs and buttons if you have like forms that you want to use. I have like a primary and a secondary button. And that's all I basically have here.
04:01:27.548 - 04:01:56.590, Speaker D: And I think you should do your best to also create something similar to this. So that way you have something always to reference and to use. So let's get into creating some of these little pieces so you can do it any which way you want. I like to keep my things really neat, so I'm just going to make a copy over here. You have this file. So I encourage you all to follow along to take a look and see if you could recreate some of these pieces. I think maybe we can start with something like this.
04:01:56.590 - 04:02:39.942, Speaker D: So basically, if we wanted to recreate this, what I've done is I've have a frame here which is like the device frame. And you can choose any size, or you can just go ahead and choose like the 13 pro. I believe that's the size I'm using. What I've done here is I've just rounded the corners to just give it a nice little effect and put a nice faint stroke just on the outside. So I'm just going to add a stroke and add a color. And we're going to move rather quickly through this. And I am going to make that stroke dark so we can all see it.
04:02:39.942 - 04:03:00.982, Speaker D: And it was set to the outside. Now you can create anything you like. You can create something that looks like mine. It doesn't have to. I'm just creating something really rough here. So just to walk you through that process. Now, the other interesting thing here is I'm going to make this an auto layout frame because I just want my content to like stack nicely.
04:03:00.982 - 04:03:22.346, Speaker D: I don't want to have to worry about like laying out, to be honest. Like that's not my priority here. I just need it to be neater and I can focus more so on writing the details. So what I do is I just created an auto layout frame. You can set the palette into whatever you like. I think 16 or something like 24 is probably the best. And then you can set the spacing.
04:03:22.458 - 04:03:22.850, Speaker C: I like.
04:03:22.890 - 04:03:51.548, Speaker D: Keeping everything to 16 is totally fine. Now for these little squares, what I did was I just created a square and I used the rectangle tool. So you can go up here and get it, or you can just press r. So I'm going to use r, and it doesn't really matter for the size just yet. And I'm going to duplicate that by using the shortcut, which is command d or control. Djdehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe and it's over here. We'll make this a little bit darker so that way we can see.
04:03:51.548 - 04:04:41.242, Speaker D: So now we have two blocks, and we can use things like this as, like, imagery, and we can group that into a frame, and we can just call this images or whatever you want. Then you can set the spacing in auto layout, and we can just throw this frame right in. Whoops. So you can resize your device if you want. So that is basically how you can just make, like, images. And the same thing basically goes for these little, like, text layers. All I've done is I've made these little rectangles and put them in a auto layout frame, as you can see.
04:04:41.242 - 04:05:12.312, Speaker D: So if you're confused as to like, oh, well, how did you make something like that? Just always look at the actual layers in here and break them down. This is an auto layout frame. You don't actually need this one. So I could actually remove it and it still functions the same. You can just adjust the width here instead of setting it to, like, fill the container like this. And you can also set, like, some paragraph text if you want to have, like, the effect of having long text. So there's, there's a of things you can do like that.
04:05:12.312 - 04:05:56.574, Speaker D: For buttons, I essentially just created, like, the same thing. I have another rectangle. I just gave it like a fixed height of something. And, you know, you have like a black version for like a primary, and then, you know, you create another duplicate of that and you have, we'll have a secondary. So maybe like, if you have like a cancel and save button or something like that. So you can go ahead and create different types of assets like that. And I really do encourage you to do your best to name those assets.
04:05:56.574 - 04:06:24.446, Speaker D: Right now, I'm not being the best over here. I just call it rectangle. But if you look at the assets that you have available to you, I have like primary button laid out. And I think this is the first step into understanding how you could be way more efficient with your workflow. Now that is all you're really going to need to know to get started here. And I wouldn't worry too much about like creating components just yet or anything like that. I would use some of these assets and just start throwing them inside these devices.
04:06:24.446 - 04:07:26.730, Speaker D: You'll notice that they are fixed width and a fixed height. So you can fill, set these to fill the container and not really worried about, you know, how the container reacts and yeah, that's basically it. These are going to be some useful assets for you. Hey everyone, and welcome back. I want to talk about user flows and more specifically I want to talk about the one user flow that is registering for the product because it's very important for something like this. Now if you have images of your sketches or other types of resources that you think are going to help you, you can bring those images right into figma easily by just going over here and by placing the image. And that's the shortcut for Mac users and you'll see it there for window users as well.
04:07:26.730 - 04:07:49.762, Speaker D: So that's an easy way. Or you can copy and paste that image directly from a website. You can copy and paste it from another file. But so I have all my assets here. I have even like a title asset and a details asset and a device asset. Additionally to what we have here, I'm going to create a large frame by pressing f. I'm just going to just bring that over there.
04:07:49.762 - 04:07:58.680, Speaker D: So I'm going to rename this one. Just generally just onboarding. Then I place my title in there.
04:07:59.780 - 04:08:00.556, Speaker C: Doesn't really matter.
04:08:00.588 - 04:08:25.616, Speaker D: I'm being, you know, a little messy and that's okay. Now the title of this flow is, it's one of the most important things. I think it should be like registering for our product. So let's type that in. Okay. And let's bring in our device and our details frame. So I'm holding shift while I'm selecting both and just dragging them directly in the frame.
04:08:25.616 - 04:09:10.726, Speaker D: And you can see that pop up over here in the layers panel. I also have an arrow here so we can keep that trusty arrow. Okay, so this is going to be our step one. And when I think about just the first step of registering for a product, I am going to start typing before I actually start designing just yet. Like just placing things within this device. But the first thing I think about is like the user arrives at our welcome screen and notices a button to proceed forward to registration. Perfect.
04:09:10.726 - 04:09:59.552, Speaker D: I mean, I think we should probably have like a little thing here that says this step is skippable or the user can skip this step. Okay, so I'm just gonna increase the frame. So I'm gonna hold down command or control and just bring that up here. So that way we have a lot of space. The one thing I want to stress here is that, you know, the first thing somebody sees when they come into the website or the product is that they are essentially, you know, they are going to see like a welcome screen of some sort. So I duplicated this and brought it into here. You can just like copy and paste it as well.
04:09:59.552 - 04:10:41.164, Speaker D: So I'll just grab a button here, like a primary. I'm going to copy that and click my frame and paste it. And there we go. I mean, you can also go ahead and like, I like to use colors sometimes because I think it helps just show you, you know, what are the interactive states? Like, do they click this and then do they click something else? So I think this is just going to suffice as like some sort of welcome screen. Then we're going to move over to the next screen. So you can see, you can start building these out rather quickly just by thinking even in your head. I would actually sketch these out first and think about every single flow you have and you know, which ones are really important for the success of your product.
04:10:41.164 - 04:11:21.410, Speaker D: Like, you don't need to do like a normal login flow. I mean, you could, I mean, it would take you probably like five minutes. But I think that kind of design pattern is, is pretty normalized when you're thinking about things that are much more custom. Like this registration where, I don't know, step 2 may be something like the user is prompted to add their email and password. Oops. They can confirm those details. So this is pretty standard, but I think we need to also mention it.
04:11:21.410 - 04:11:51.402, Speaker D: But let's actually copy this whole container. We can throw it in there. Oops, there we go. Finally, we can remove that just by pressing delete while clicking it and remove this one. So, and then there probably should be like maybe like a back button. So I'm gonna take this whole container and paste it in. Take this black and I'm gonna use the color picker by pressing I and select that blue.
04:11:51.402 - 04:12:26.490, Speaker D: So we have like a primary and secondary. Maybe this is like a skip button or something like that. And I don't know, I'm just trying to cover some bases, while I'm also thinking a little bit about wireframing at the very, very simplest and most basic stage. So we have this step now, this is where things are going to get interesting because like I said just before this step, you know, you are going to have situations where you have very custom flows that really need to be thought through. And user flows are going to be the best way to, to do that. So I'm going to increase that frame. Let's think about this third step.
04:12:26.490 - 04:13:06.854, Speaker D: Now, step three, I'm going to jump right in there and I'm going to go right into my details. So the user can add a photo or skip the step, and I think that's fine. So maybe, you know, there's some customization aspects and we can take this one column image and we can throw this here and, you know, at this point you can do a couple different things. I'm going to ungroup it by using shift command G. Or you could do shift Ctrl G. Whoops. Oh, never mind.
04:13:06.854 - 04:13:31.480, Speaker D: This is actually, the frame is actually the piece here. So we can make it smaller and you can start customizing that. And we all know how to use auto layout now, so there's no real need to explain how that works. But you can, you know, mess with the alignment if you need to here. But I'm just gonna keep everything centered. For the sake of simplicity. Let's get into a little bit more of the custom.
04:13:31.480 - 04:14:16.146, Speaker D: Oops. The custom stuff that we're gonna see in this flow, or at least I think we're gonna see. So I think the big part of this app is just like customization in general, and we want the user to be able to, you know, add things about themselves. They can, you know, pick, let me think. They can pick interests and hobbies to personalize their shopping experience. So I think this is another thing that we didn't really talk about just yet. When we're thinking about a whole flow here, it's very straightforward.
04:14:16.146 - 04:15:07.276, Speaker D: Even though this flow is a little bit longer, I think it is fine because it's like one step after the other, just outlining each step. What's skippable? What's not skippable? What are the areas that you can like, you know, truly manipulate if you need to? So I'm going to take this one column asset and just paste it into here. I'm going to click into this device, paste it, and I'm going to move it with my arrow keys and I'm going to just delete this image at the very top. So it kind of acts like a title. And I set this to hug the contents and I can just bring everything to the top. So say there are like, maybe, I don't know, like a bunch of categories that they can click here. Let me back up there because I don't know if they'll have paragraphs or anything like that.
04:15:07.276 - 04:15:42.930, Speaker D: Not that that's important, but I think it's, it's good to try and be, I guess you could say, a little bit truthful in what type of content may actually be there. And the last step, and I think this is going to be it after this step right here. But I'm going to select all these. And you can do that just by dragging your cursor or by clicking shift. So I'm going to do that. I'm holding option shift and I am dragging it. So it's kind of acting like a duplicate.
04:15:42.930 - 04:16:02.928, Speaker D: Okay, now this is step five. So I think step five ignore the actual design in there because I don't think that's what it's going to look like. But step five should probably be something like, like, okay, I've picked my hobbies, interest. It's going to personalize my shopping experience. Now I should get some sort of confirmation. And I'm done. Like, happy success.
04:16:02.928 - 04:16:48.546, Speaker D: That's it. So success. The user has registered for the product and can now access all of the member related features. This is just off the top of my head, but you can kind of see how this does follow the same line of thinking when it comes to just the general way things should flow with a user flow. So I'm just going to paste that in there and I'm going to once again make everything centered. And there's like my confirmation screen. I know it's nothing like beautiful or anything, but it definitely gets the point across.
04:16:48.546 - 04:17:15.400, Speaker D: And these blue buttons are like, this is what I'm really clicking on. Maybe we can even come in here and just set one of these. We can set these colors. See, these are the selection colors. So if you click them and you select like, say, blue, then we're starting to select everything as blue. Then you can go ahead and maybe adjust the opacity here. I mean, you can say that this is clickable and so is this.
04:17:15.400 - 04:18:01.344, Speaker D: So color picker while I'm selecting that and just pick the color. And these are a little bit interactive, so you can go ahead and do that across the board if you really want to. Not necessary at all. I mean, I think the details are the most important part as you can see how I've basically laid out every single step what can and can't be done and kept it really, really succinct. And that's how we created our first user flow for registering for a product. Hey, everyone, welcome back. We are going to create one more user flow.
04:18:01.344 - 04:18:28.752, Speaker D: I think the most important one that I really want to get to is finding the right product through search. Now, this one is a huge one. So we have this one over here. And literally, I'm just going to just duplicate it. So it's going to duplicate beside it by pressing command D or Ctrl D and you can bring that down. That is exactly what I'm going to do. And I'm going to jump right into here and I'm going to start naming this one.
04:18:28.752 - 04:19:09.070, Speaker D: So you can name it anything you want. We could just call it search or something like that. Let's get a little bit more specific with the name. Okay. Finding the right product through search. Now, search is very, very key to a lot of products success when it comes to, like, ecommerce or when it comes to, you know, just searching for different types of products, search results, for knowledge sharing. When you think about, like, things like Google, I mean, there's a lot of ux work that goes into that and I just want to kind of build out that flow a bit.
04:19:09.070 - 04:19:51.164, Speaker D: Think about all the different scenarios that are possibilities and yeah, just go through that with you. So you can either just follow along with me or you can actually start building some design. So I'm just going to, like I said, I have a duplicate here. So we can just start from that. Now, when I think of search, like, where does it start? So step one, I'm going to start writing some details because it's the way I personally work. You can just start visually, I like to just start from just writing down what I think is like the job to be done here by the user. So when I think about, like, search, you know, the user is able to begin that search from like the home screen.
04:19:51.164 - 04:20:20.410, Speaker D: So begin their search from the home screen. The user can click the search input. Okay. And then we can put together like a quick home screen. We could repurpose this button to be at the very top. Maybe this image is like a header of some sort of like, like some big, I don't know, product maybe. What else is there? There may be some more products.
04:20:20.410 - 04:20:40.324, Speaker D: Let's go to our assets. So I'm going to actually, oops, I'm going to zoom out a bit. I'm going to grab these assets over here and bring them right beside, at least for now. Oops, I'm zooming in and out so much. And here we go. So we have more products. This is like just me quickly building home screen.
04:20:40.324 - 04:21:08.710, Speaker D: Maybe there's some smaller products too. And there we go. That's our search. And, okay, so now that we've clicked search, what do we think is going to happen? So we need to think about like every little detail. I mean, you know, step two, I think the user, hmm. The user receives a keyboard prompt. So I'll even go into sometimes like little details like this as to how certain interactions should perform.
04:21:08.710 - 04:21:57.144, Speaker D: And you'll need to do this for everything. I like to do it for the most important types of interactions that maybe users really need outline because they have such high traffic, not like, okay, the button is clicked and then it hovers and does a spin and then jumps out at you. I don't know, like those types of micro interactions, I don't think you really need to worry about. I like to do certain things like this where the interaction is more like a multi step interaction. So an example is, you know, the user receives a keyboard prompt within a search overlay and is able to enter their search. So this is pretty standard as well. I think maybe we'll just remove this and we'll start fresh.
04:21:57.144 - 04:22:24.820, Speaker D: Like maybe the search is still at the top and maybe there's this massive keyboard prompt that comes from the bottom. And now we can just play with autolay a little bit instead of packed. I want them to be separated. So I'm going to go and do space between. So yeah, this kind of does look like a keyboard prompt that comes out and I'm going to just make it blue as well. This can be like secondary. Like you can still click on it in some way, shape or form, but this is the main interaction that's happening.
04:22:24.820 - 04:23:06.040, Speaker D: And then step three. So now this is what I'm talking about. Like, let's get into the details here. So as the user types, the product gives the user suggestions for potential searches. So think about like type aheads and stuff like that. The user can click on this search item that relates to their intended search. So I'm thinking about a couple different things here, to be honest.
04:23:06.040 - 04:23:36.774, Speaker D: I have this screen, I'm actually going to delete this entirely and just duplicate this screen and drag it over because I think this one's going to actually work well. So this is maybe like secondary now. And what we have is, I don't know, let's think here. Let's steal this. So we have these rectangles and that's going to be kind of like our list items. So we're going to set it to fill. So there's like some sort of subheading.
04:23:36.774 - 04:23:55.760, Speaker D: We're going to just copy and paste it. Command C or control c. And, you know, the same for adding the paste as controller command v. And we have a bunch of different items here. Maybe that's too many. It doesn't really matter, but let's see. And then over here, we'll just make this like blue.
04:23:55.760 - 04:24:23.400, Speaker D: So they're going to click on this. Now you can make another flow where they just click. Or you can do a branch here. Like instead of clicking the type ahead, they click the, they just click enter on the keyboard and then it goes to the same place. Ultimately, I mean, it's basically the same flow. And I'm not sure it's worthwhile to think through that too much. But step four, I think the user is then presented with many search results.
04:24:23.400 - 04:24:58.358, Speaker D: And then this is where you can branch again. Maybe there are no search results. What happens then? How do we get them back to searching? So these are the types of scenarios that you're going to need to think through. And they choose the product they have been looking for. Okay, so I think we can actually reuse some of this stuff over here, maybe. Or maybe we can use like these types of pieces. So I'm actually going to delete everything that's in this frame and I'm going to start fresh.
04:24:58.358 - 04:25:59.170, Speaker D: So maybe there's like tons of search results. Maybe we still have that search at the very top that's easily accessible. And then we have like our, maybe our step five here where the user is then like finally in the product page. So the user is now able to review the product that they had searched for and can decide if they want to add the item to their cart. So this is a very important step as well because this is actually the end, right? Like this is our goal and we've found the right product through the goal. So what does this screen look like? I mean, I think it's, you know, maybe very similar here where it's like there is. Let's go to our assets.
04:25:59.170 - 04:26:25.424, Speaker D: I think we have like, oh, there we go. We can use that. So this looks kind of like a product page now. And maybe there's like this big add to cart button or something. I don't know. I think it doesn't really matter right now, but this is essentially maybe how the flow plays out. And essentially, that is what it is like to create, like a user flow for finding the right product through search.
04:26:25.424 - 04:26:42.240, Speaker D: So remember, get into those nitty gritty details. Think about the optional routes users can take, because if you do not, you're going to have a lot of trouble trying to design later for solutions that you should have been thinking about way more earlier in the process. I know we all love to jump.
04:26:42.280 - 04:26:44.272, Speaker C: Right into like, creating nice UI designs.
04:26:44.296 - 04:26:49.310, Speaker D: And whatnot, but take some time to think about some of the more important user flows.
04:26:59.890 - 04:27:23.410, Speaker C: Hey everyone, we are back at it again. And today we're going to learn about sitemaps. So before we even get into creating them, we're going to talk a little bit about the anatomy and why they're so useful. And yes, they are still useful. So the big question is, people still use sitemaps? Of course they do. It's not just limited to information architecture. Everyone should use sitemaps, especially designers.
04:27:23.410 - 04:27:55.908, Speaker C: They help provide structure for your product. Like look at this, we have the primary navigation or secondary navigation. We can really plan out all the different navigation schemes within our product. Sitemaps help a lot. So what are they? Sitemaps are hierarchical diagrams of a website or an application that shows how pages are prioritized. I want you to think about the last lesson that we went through. User flows that we did prior are kind of like a street view of what we were discovering in terms of like how the user should achieve goals and where we discovered different types of content we needed.
04:27:55.908 - 04:28:35.772, Speaker C: You remember this user flow over here? This is making a purchase. And we discovered a lot of different things. We discovered like the different steps that it took to actually complete a purchase. We discovered different types of micro interactions, all the different close up details that we didn't necessarily know before. Now, a sitemap is essentially a bird's eye view. This way we can take an early glance of what our product looks like from the treetops. So when do we use sitemaps? Well, sitemaps are generally used in the beginning or really early on in the design process, like right after discovery or kickoffs, right after you get all that information from your clients or, or from your product team.
04:28:35.772 - 04:29:06.128, Speaker C: Kind of like what we're doing right now with application that we're trying to build. They'll really help us when we need to start working on our wireframes. Welcome back. So you may be asking yourself, well, how do I create a sitemap? Well, let's jump in. The first step is anatomy. Let's learn about the anatomy of a sitemap. So essentially a sitemap will consist of all these linked pages.
04:29:06.128 - 04:29:25.456, Speaker C: So we have this as our page. I mean, they don't need to necessarily look like this. Like I said before, with other things, it's all about what works for you, what best represents what you're trying to get across. So right now I'm just kind of using a little card. I don't necessarily use this when I'm creating the sitemap. So this is the main card. And within the anatomy you have a reference number.
04:29:25.456 - 04:29:47.810, Speaker C: Some people like to use reference numbers. They really kind of help when you're like creating actual wireframes. Afterwards you can use that same reference number. You don't necessarily need to. I know a lot of people that like to, but it's a preference. But one thing that is definitely needed is a label. So this label over here is definitely going to be needed because it'll let us understand what the page name is.
04:29:47.810 - 04:30:09.772, Speaker C: That is what we really want to know. So what you want to do is you want to start with your homepage. Always the rows that follow afterwards are by the highest priority. So I say rows because typically people, when they build a sitemap, they're building it from the top to the bottom. You can build it from left to right. Like I said before, it's all preference. So I'm going left to right right now.
04:30:09.772 - 04:30:42.710, Speaker C: So the next step of the sitemap would be like your primary, secondary and tertiary pages and so on. So right now we have a primary page. So if we were to think about our current client, we have our homepage and you could access a category on that page and that would be our primary level. And then afterwards you may be able to select a subcategory and that would be our secondary level and it could go on and on. I wouldn't advise doing that, but you get the gist. So this is our primary and our secondary, and this is ground zero. Now you could use a legend if you'd like.
04:30:42.710 - 04:31:06.850, Speaker C: It's totally up to you. That's another preference. If you're sharing it with a lot of people, it may help if you have a lot of symbols in there. If you have colors. I like to use colors because it helps to signify whether like a page is public or a member only. So totally up to you if it really helps to get through what you're trying to say with your product and your sitemap, use a legend. So there are two types of sitemaps.
04:31:06.850 - 04:31:41.940, Speaker C: This is a flat site map and this is better suited for smaller to medium sized products. I'm thinking maybe like ten to 100 pages, maybe even less, to be honest. There are four or less vertical levels. You'll notice that there's only two vertical levels here and that's probably what we'll be using when we create our sitemap. But there are four less vertical levels and they all help enhance the discoverability of content because there are fewer levels to click through. So you want to use this for smaller products. You don't want people to be going too deep unless it's absolutely necessary.
04:31:41.940 - 04:32:08.128, Speaker C: The next type of sitemap is a deep site map. So these are better suited for larger size sites and they help house a lot of information. So we're talking like hundreds and hundreds of pages. We're talking maybe pages for like a government website, maybe like a huge e commerce website. They can get around to five vertical levels, which is huge. I mean, we're at four here and you can imagine the amount of pages that you can get into. This ultimately makes it harder to discover content.
04:32:08.128 - 04:32:49.794, Speaker C: So you'll need to think about the different ways for users to get to places like menu shortcuts. But yeah, so deep sitemaps use them for larger products, don't use them for a product like we're building. So why are they so valuable? Well, they help you plan for usability and it provides a full overview which can really help teams simplify and trim unnecessary pages. But really, when you build a sitemap, you can also strategically place content where users can find it. It results in the creation of navigation hierarchies and categorizations of your product. You get a good understanding of your navigation, you can calculate the amount of content you need, and it gives you a good understanding of your scope. So sitemaps are incredibly useful.
04:32:49.794 - 04:33:07.719, Speaker C: You may not create like a final sitemap, and that shouldn't bottleneck you in terms of starting wireframes or even like sketching and user flows, but you should really start one to get a sense of what your entire navigation scheme is going to look like. Let's jump right into Figma and let's start building our own.
04:33:17.739 - 04:33:48.182, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, and welcome back. We are going to be talking about sitemaps today. Before we begin this tutorial, though, I want to show you what exactly we are going to learn within Figma and what we're going to build. So we're going to learn a bunch of different things. We're going to learn how to build these types of assets for our sitemap that are going to be reusable for you in the future and today. And we're going to make non component versions and we're going to learn how to use components and that's going to be super fun. Trust me.
04:33:48.182 - 04:34:23.701, Speaker D: It's going to make your workflow and your life just so much more easier. Then we're actually going to build our own sitemap as well. So you're going to need a couple of things before we can actually start building. You're going to need, obviously you need Figma, but you're going to need the auto flow plugin. So if I go into my plugins just by right clicking, this is what Autoflow looks like. And if I were to make a rectangle, it basically allows you to connect one layer to the next. Kind of like how we're seeing here.
04:34:23.701 - 04:34:59.019, Speaker D: We're going to be using that a lot. So if you haven't used this plugin yet, definitely get it before we start. Okay, let's get started. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. I am going to teach you how to create these assets that I've used for our sitemap. Now, these are some great assets. I'm just going to run through them really quickly to explain why.
04:34:59.019 - 04:35:35.178, Speaker D: We have a bunch of different colors and what they mean and what this container is over here. So these are actually going to be components. We are just making some reusable pieces here. If you're not comfortable with components yet, that's totally fine. We don't have to jump into that just yet, but I will teach that. Now, I have decided to show the sitemap in a couple of different ways. Now we have a page and I'm going to break it into pages and the links that are available within that page, we have public links, and that means links that anyone can see, even if you are not signed in or registered.
04:35:35.178 - 04:36:04.956, Speaker D: We also have member only links. Those are links for people who are specifically registered with our product. We have more specific links for logging in, signing up, logging out, that kind of stuff. And we have yellow to indicate the outside links, links that are going to push you outside of the app or product. Ultimately, you may not use all of these. You may use this for future projects. I think it's just great to have them, like, just ready.
04:36:04.956 - 04:36:31.283, Speaker D: But I'm going to get into how to build these. And this is the container over here on the right side that is going to house all of these items. So let's jump right in. So actually, I'm going to just take one of these just to show you what it looks like. So this is essentially just a frame. If we break it down so we can build it together. So what I'm going to do is just use a text layer like I just done.
04:36:31.283 - 04:37:09.400, Speaker D: I press t and easiest way to do that is just press t, click, and you have your text layer ready. So if I write, say something like link, and then after I wrap this within a auto layout frame. So I'm going to right click on it, add auto layout. So now I have my link frame. There we go. You can't actually see anything right now because there's no fill. But if we were to say, press I to get the color picker and use the color picker on this little link over here, you know, we can easily just copy that.
04:37:09.400 - 04:37:34.260, Speaker D: So that's all I basically did. You can choose whatever style you like. I'm going to actually stretch this out a bit. And I am going to add a border radius to this. So I have a four pixel border radius. I'm also going to make this a tad taller. So I like using fixed heights, things like this.
04:37:34.800 - 04:37:36.688, Speaker C: It really depends on if it's going.
04:37:36.704 - 04:38:05.234, Speaker D: To run to two lines. It may be wise not to for something like this though, like a button makes sense to use like a fixed height, but something that may run onto two lines. I don't really like to take the chance because then it'll look kind of awkward. I'll show you what that looks like in a second. So I'm actually going to keep this pretty simple. We'll make a copy. I'm going to just duplicate that to the side and we'll show you what that looks like when you have a fixed height and, you know, two lines.
04:38:05.234 - 04:38:26.082, Speaker D: But, so let's jump right in here. So we have the link, we have the auto layout frame. We don't need spacing between items. We can just keep it pretty simple. 16 pixel spacing there and maybe 16 up top. And we will add a stroke. So I'm just gonna press the little plus icon here.
04:38:26.082 - 04:38:50.706, Speaker D: And there we go. We got our stroke. Now for the stroke, what I did was I just grabbed the color and I basically went down, you know, don't make it too dark, don't make it too light. Just looks like it's kind of like, you know, just a little bit darker version there. And you can adjust the width. And basically, there you go. You could also adjust like opacity if you want of like the link.
04:38:50.706 - 04:39:35.690, Speaker D: So the text here, I'm just going to adjust the opacity is 75%. And that is essentially the link. Now let's actually remove this one and make a copy from this since we have it already ready. So if we had two sentences that are on two different lines, this is a very long link. So if we have a very long link and we set that to fill the container, we shrink it. You know, the, the actual auto layout container grows. But if we were to set, say a fixed height and then copied that text over here, make sure it's set to fill container.
04:39:35.690 - 04:40:10.570, Speaker D: Then we have this issue where this is a fixed height and it's not going to grow with this anymore. So definitely make sure that if things are going to go to a second line, you know, you don't have it set to a fixed height. So that's essentially how you create these individual links, so you can just give them different colors. I like to do that personally. When it comes to the actual page container, though, this one's a little bit more trickier. Let's take a look at how it's built. So first off, I'm going to take that right out of.
04:40:10.570 - 04:40:45.798, Speaker D: So you can basically command C or control C. Or you could just drag it out of there. Command V. It's going to paste it underneath there, but you can take it out. So I have my links actually set up in an auto layout container and they only have a spacing of eight pixels. And within that container are my links, then I have another layer that's right here. So that is just like my page title.
04:40:45.798 - 04:41:13.180, Speaker D: Really simple stuff. Now this is the part that is a bit difficult. All I've done here, if we take a look at it, is create another auto layout container with these traffic lights. So these are just circles in a group. We have greenhouse yellow and red. Basically it is literally just grabbing the ellipse tool, which is o making a copy. Oops.
04:41:13.180 - 04:41:47.520, Speaker D: And just to mimic like a top of a browser. So really simple stuff. Then you can group it and then we would frame it again into like an auto layout frame and call it our header. I know I am moving a little quickly here, but I do just want to give you a good understanding. I'm going to grab the color picker with I and click on this just to get the color. And that's basically it. I mean, that's all there really is to mimicking this header.
04:41:47.520 - 04:42:12.660, Speaker D: Once we have that header, we can take the rest of our content. We're going to take everything. You guessed it, if I press shift a, it's going to throw it in auto layout frame. And now we have our frame here. And now we can do a bunch of different things. First of all, I'm actually going to set the fill to white. I am going to also add a stroke like I have here.
04:42:12.660 - 04:42:52.428, Speaker D: That stroke will be, say, two pixels and I want it to match the color that I have for the header. Another thing I want to do is I want to ensure that this has a nice border radius. So I'm just going to slap something quick on there and it's going to clip the content because you notice I put the border radius but it didn't really apply to the header. That's because the header background is bleeding off of the frame and we haven't clipped it. So now that we clip it, it's hidden. Now we have the issue of these things. Now you can't just set the padding within because if I were to do that, it would also create padding for here.
04:42:52.428 - 04:43:25.764, Speaker D: So the best way to handle something like this is to actually wrap these two into their own container. So I'm going to use shift a and set this can new container within here to fill. And then I'm going to select all the contents within. You can see my layer is opening up here. I'm going to select them all. You can use Ctrl A or command a and set them all to fill the container. So now that we have everything fill in the container, we can actually set the different padding and spacing between things.
04:43:25.764 - 04:43:46.734, Speaker D: So 16 pixels. I'm going to just have like that as the padding here. And I'm going to set 16 pixels here and 16 pixels at the bottom and the top. And then you can go into your frame. Finally your top level page container. Mine has the name of a frame one I think it is. And you can remove the padding if you need to.
04:43:46.734 - 04:44:31.504, Speaker D: And that's basically all there really is to creating this new page container. Now the only thing here I have to fix is the header and set that to fill container. And there you have it. You can create your very own version of this pretty quickly. And I would say, you know, if you have some time, you know, you can put your own personal spin on it, but that's how you create your own like reusable little asset for sitemaps. Hey everyone, and welcome back. I want to talk about components, basic components.
04:44:31.504 - 04:45:00.426, Speaker D: We're not getting into really, really deep details on how to use like components super properly. I just want you to increase your efficiency, make you also feel like you can build better components in the future. But let's start here. So we have these reusable assets, the only problem is that you're just going to need to copy and paste them over and over again. And maybe it's not super efficient, it's still efficient. It's definitely better than nothing. 100% big improvement.
04:45:00.426 - 04:45:31.452, Speaker D: But if we turn these into components, they would be so much better. So let's jump right in. Really the only difference I would say between this and a component is you'll be able to access it in your assets table over here. So let's jump in. So these are our current link components. So I'm going to copy them with a command C or Ctrl C and paste it. I'm going to drag them right out.
04:45:31.452 - 04:46:02.270, Speaker D: So these are our links. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to deselect the group, ungroup them. So for me it's shift command g. You can even go into our right click, it's going to be shift control g for Windows users. So now that we have all of our components that we want to build, we can do a couple different things. Now we can either, we can either just create a component like this.
04:46:04.410 - 04:46:04.722, Speaker C: Or.
04:46:04.746 - 04:46:49.430, Speaker D: Using the shortcut, create individual components, or we can select all of them. So if I just go back in time and undo that, we can select all of them. So we can create multiple components. And now I can access all those components right here whenever I want, just drag and drop them into whatever I field I need and so on. So these are components and they're not really, you can edit them, but they're going to be reusable and you won't be able to necessarily like do much in terms of like touching this master component. So there's two things here. We have our master component and then we have what we call an instance, and these are copies of the Master.
04:46:49.430 - 04:47:20.726, Speaker D: So whatever you do to the instance will not affect the master. Whatever you do to the master though, will affect the instance. As you can tell. If I select all of these and I say change the border radius to 100, that's going to change everywhere. Now the great thing about instances is that you can swap them pretty quickly. So if I go into here and I select member only, this is where our instances are. I can go and select outside link.
04:47:20.726 - 04:48:10.630, Speaker D: So if I want to switch something really quickly on the fly, I can do that, but I'm going to just go back quickly and fix that. So now that we have these components, we can do a couple of things. We can either leave them as is or we can actually go the route of using something that I like to call variants. And variants are very powerful. So if we select them all, since they're all very similar, the reason why you would do this is because you have a similar component to the other similar master components. So an example is primary and secondary buttons or different states like hover states versus active states. And when you're thinking about like things like inputs and forms.
04:48:10.630 - 04:48:15.190, Speaker D: Now for our little links here, the only difference really is color.
04:48:15.730 - 04:48:17.106, Speaker C: It's the color and the type.
04:48:17.178 - 04:49:06.080, Speaker D: The differentiator is essentially the color, but the type is like public member only login or sign up and outside link. So if we select all our components, we can click over here, combine them as variants. That's going to put them in this little box and inside this box. Now we have the link version, we have the member only version and we have the login or signup version and the outside link version. If we click this bounding box around our variance, we can go in here and specify a couple of things. So they're called properties and those are the differences between the components. So we're going to say that our property type here is the type of link or link type.
04:49:06.080 - 04:49:35.972, Speaker D: You can go deeper, you can have so many different types of properties, you can have like, you know, icons and so on and so forth. Like it can get really advanced, but for this we're just going to keep it super simple. So we have four variants. Now if I were to say take a copy or I have them here now. So it's in my assets panel over here. Now if you were to take a copy and now go here, you can select member only. It looks a little different.
04:49:35.972 - 04:50:14.032, Speaker D: This is going to be great for more complex components. So that's how you create a component and that's how you start to use variance. The next step I want to talk about is actually creating a component for this over here. So I'm just going to drag a copy over and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this public link, I'm going to copy it and I'm going to select in my layers the links container that is housing all of these versions and I'm going to paste it. There it is. You can see it's outlined in purple. You can see that layer.
04:50:14.032 - 04:50:56.694, Speaker D: I'm going to just shift it right to the top and I'm going to take the rest of the links, select them all here so I can select them in my layer panel too and delete. Then I'm going to take this link and I'm going to copy it and paste it. I'm just going to make sure that's dragged right back into this layer because sometimes when you copy and paste and there's only one layer within, it'll paste right outside so we can copy and paste it again and again and again and again and again and again. I know that's kind of crazy, but just stick with me. I promise it's going to get better. So what I'm going to do is now that I have this setup with a button of different links, I'm going to turn into a component and that's it. And you may be thinking, what are we doing here now? Like, we have a bunch of links.
04:50:56.694 - 04:51:07.158, Speaker D: So the great thing about components is you can't add to an instance. So you can't necessarily say, okay, now I want, you know, this, another public link in here.
04:51:07.334 - 04:51:08.582, Speaker C: It doesn't work that way.
04:51:08.686 - 04:51:54.994, Speaker D: Once an instance has been created, you can't add to it, but you can hide what you have added. So if you make a very long list, you can take whatever you don't need and press like, say, delete, and it's just going to hide them in that panel. Then you can go in here and start specifying what you want. Oh, I want it to be this one an outside link and this one a member only link and this one a login or signup link and so on and so forth. And you never know how many links you're going to have on one page. So it's great to just, you know, prepare for the absolute worst and throw them in there. And now you can just, you know, either grab links or just, you know, grab this every time you need a new page and just keep on going.
04:51:54.994 - 04:52:39.864, Speaker D: And then, you know, link them together. And now you have these components that are reusable. Now you may be thinking, oh, my goodness, like, why are we doing all this? Like, it just seems so excessive. Well, maybe for sitemaps, but this is a great way to demonstrate how useful they can be. And if I really wanted to change things, you can start to tell why they're so powerful for things like user interfaces, because sometimes you make one change on a button because maybe you don't like rounded buttons anymore and you want flat buttons with strong, sharp corners. You're going to have to go through all your designs and find all the, use all those buttons. Now, if you were using components, you would switch one and, you know, it will be modified everywhere else.
04:52:39.864 - 04:53:27.174, Speaker D: If I wanted to, you know, switch here and say that this no longer has like a rounded corner like I did over here, and it put the border radius to zero. That's going to reflect everywhere. So that's how you use components to create some pretty awesome reusable assets that you can use within your local file. Remember that if you have a free starter plan, this is the only way to use components. You cannot use components across multiple files. You can only use them within the file that you're working in. Hey, everyone, and welcome back.
04:53:27.174 - 04:54:08.450, Speaker D: We are going to be jumping right into creating our very own sitemap. Now. We are going to start with the home screen and work our way out. We'll do what I call the top layer or the, you know, the login and registration stuff, onboarding some of that kind of stuff, and then we'll get into some of the main pages. Now I'm going to be using my component that I created. You can use it to, the assets are there for you. And if you have any sketches, like when we actually did the sketching section, or if you have any user flows, bring those in here because they're going to really help you understand where you need to go and what you need to do.
04:54:08.450 - 04:54:39.402, Speaker D: So let's jump right in. So I have the home screen over here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to start with search. I know this isn't necessarily like a public link or anything, but it's actually a very important part of the flow. And then I'm going to go with a member only link. So I think there's probably going to be some sort of like shopping interests section or something like that. Yeah, I'm just going to leave it at that for now because I'm not sure what going to be called just yet.
04:54:39.402 - 04:55:26.680, Speaker D: And then we probably have a way to get to categories and deals. Now, one of the big things that I think you should know is that it's just going to come naturally to you when you are actually building your own sitemap and you're starting to work through the project a bit more, depending on what exactly you're building. It's going to be something that you're going to start getting, you know, more and more comfortable with in terms of, like the subject matter. So we're going to have a couple, a couple more member only links. Okay. So we have a wish list. Maybe we'll have orders as well.
04:55:26.680 - 04:55:54.136, Speaker D: And it seems like the other option is something like profile. We'll probably have cart. Now, I'm not sure what exactly is going to be part of the main navigation just yet. And that's something I'm going to figure out more and more with, you know, as we refine sitemaps and as we just move forward into the wire framing stage. So what do we have here? Probably a login or sign up. Oops. Let's install that on next launch.
04:55:54.136 - 04:56:25.250, Speaker D: And here we go. Okay, so this looks like the great place to start with home. Now, one thing I want to do is I want to think about registration. I think that's fairly important. And we'll start building out that portion. So there is, I'm going to actually make a couple of copies because I'm going to use a bunch of these. So I'm just making a bunch and I'm leaving them here because I'll grab those in a sec.
04:56:25.250 - 04:56:57.894, Speaker D: Okay, let's take a look. So we probably have like an introductory screen that I think, you know, makes sense. Something like you come in, there's a tutorial maybe, or there's like, you know, either sign up or log in. That seems like something that's really logical for a mobile app. So let's take all these. And what we're going to do is we're just going to press delete and you can actually delete them and they'll hide because it is a component. And so what I'm going to do.
04:56:57.942 - 04:56:59.950, Speaker C: Here is I'm actually going to create.
04:57:00.030 - 04:57:26.622, Speaker D: Two different sections, one for login and one for signup. So I'll call the signup, just sign up. So delete the rest of the text there. And for login we'll delete the text there. Probably steal this one. That makes sense. Okay, so, and then I'm going to just make another, another one of these for login as well.
04:57:26.622 - 04:58:14.040, Speaker D: What you want to do is you want to make sure that you have everything laid out to the best of your abilities. So from the login screen it makes sense that you'd be able to go to like some sort of registration and onboarding and then from there you'll probably be able to go to login and then go to the home because we're not necessarily going to force people to sign up and that's, that's the right approach, I think we should take. So I'm just going to link these together now. I'm going to run my plugin. Where are you? Autoflow. So I got my autoflow plugin going. Definitely download this plugin if you don't have it.
04:58:14.040 - 04:59:04.550, Speaker D: So when I think about the introductory screen, I think that, okay, from the home I'm just going to, you know, hold down shift when I clicked that little layer and then connected it to home. I'll show you again in a second. So if I click login. So I'm going to click this link layer over here and I'm going to hold shift and then click this, this whole container. And just like that, we've created our connections and some of them are, I would say, you know, you don't necessarily need to do it, but you can, you can fill that in. I mean, I think it's more so useful when you have like the main navigation going somewhere and. Yeah, that, that's basically the first step.
04:59:04.550 - 04:59:51.672, Speaker D: Like just get these normal screens, I would call them out of the way and then we're going to move into some screens outlining just the main architecture of it all. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So what we're going to do is we are actually going to start building out some of these different screens that are going to house, like things like shopping interests, categories, deals, etcetera. So let's jump right in. So I'm just going to close my plugin. I'm not going to need it just yet. And I am going to zoom out.
04:59:51.672 - 05:00:13.554, Speaker D: Okay. Now I think what makes sense is to start just maybe, I don't know, we can pick a couple, but I'm going to start with shopping interests. So I'm going to go in there and I'm just going to name it. Now, you can just follow along with me or you can go ahead and, you know, do your own thing. If you feel like you have enough.
05:00:13.602 - 05:00:14.866, Speaker C: Of what you need to actually just.
05:00:14.898 - 05:00:43.600, Speaker D: Get started, I think you should at this point. But this will be just something that you can watch just to see how I'm going through that process. So when it comes to the shop interests and habits, this is definitely going to be a members only section. So I'm going to just make a big note here. What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to make a login and sign up. So like, to somehow prompt us that. Okay, hey, you need to absolutely sign up to go any further.
05:00:43.600 - 05:01:11.006, Speaker D: So kind of like a paywall over here. What we're going to do is make all these member only links and then we can probably hide the rest. I think four is going to be enough because what I have in store for this, I'm thinking that this is where, you know, you can discover new products and maybe a way to see just like your general interests and maybe.
05:01:11.038 - 05:01:12.370, Speaker C: A way to update them.
05:01:12.830 - 05:01:40.576, Speaker D: And then you have categories. So you can have a bunch of different types of, you know, categories for the interests and then you have maybe some deals, maybe. So I mean, this, this definitely can work. So deals may be specific to your shopping interests. So I think that will probably suffice for shopping interests. I'm going to move into over here. I'm going to just do categories and let's see.
05:01:40.576 - 05:02:12.246, Speaker D: Oops, there we go. So we have categories and I'm just going to keep these very, very open. They're going to be all public links. So we have maybe some, like, trending items or like trending categories. I'm going to leave that. And then we probably have, like, categories for specific, like, events, like whether that's something like, oh, it's Mother's Day or.
05:02:12.278 - 05:02:17.050, Speaker C: Something like that, or it's, it's a holiday. This is what you can get for.
05:02:17.390 - 05:02:46.260, Speaker D: Your partner, maybe, or your friend. I think there's definitely a lot of stuff we can do with that which will be really interesting. And then probably, I like to say that maybe every page that's like, in relation to products will probably have some sort of like, deals section just because we want to push people to stay within the app and deals are probably one of the best ways to do it, serving up, like, really good content like that.
05:02:46.720 - 05:02:48.696, Speaker C: So, I mean, I'm on the topic.
05:02:48.728 - 05:03:08.330, Speaker D: Right now, so let's think about deals. So deals, we probably have, like, trending. Oops. I know Amazon does stuff and other, other larger retailers kind of do this stuff where they have like, these types of like, you know, lightning deals or.
05:03:08.370 - 05:03:10.050, Speaker C: Like giveaways or something like that.
05:03:10.170 - 05:03:44.100, Speaker D: Maybe there is a section for like, giveaways. I don't know. I think that's, that's something we should maybe explore. And then we have like, maybe deals based off of categories. I mean, that, that seems like just like a common pattern I've seen on ecommerce sites and oops, you know what? Maybe we do have a member only type of link here where it's like, the content is more so around deals, like, just for you.
05:03:44.640 - 05:03:46.500, Speaker C: I think that that makes sense.
05:03:47.240 - 05:04:47.682, Speaker D: And, yeah, I think that's, that's gonna do it for the first half here when, when we get back into our next video, we are going to work on the other half of some of these, these links over here. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. We are going to be jumping into the other half of the, of this sitemap over here. So we are digging deeper into some of the finer details. And one thing I really want to point out right now, just before we jump right in, because we are going to get lost in there and just, you know, go through the weeds of, you know, building out those page containers and whatever content is within them. But I think another thing to really stress here is, like, a sitemap is so good for developing a content strategy. It is so good.
05:04:47.682 - 05:05:27.660, Speaker D: Like, you can already see that the types of content links that I'm trying to push through each page can make some for some, like, really interesting designs, really interesting experiences for users. So definitely, definitely go through this exercise. Even if you're going to do it on a very lightweight scale. I mean, this is very lightweight. I don't like to spend too much time here, but this lets me think about everything from like, a bird's eye view. And then I can make some of those bigger decisions little by little when it comes to the types of content that's going to be on each page and maybe some pages that I really do want to prioritize. So let's jump right in.
05:05:27.660 - 05:05:48.680, Speaker D: So I still have a bunch of my duplicates over here. I'm just going to drag them over. So. Okay. I think maybe, like, the next thing that makes sense right here is I want to actually talk about the cart. We can work our way up now. So the cart is going to be pretty simple.
05:05:48.680 - 05:06:21.300, Speaker D: Let me move these out of the way. They're a bit of a distraction. So with the cart, definitely, I think there's going to be a section here where it's like, if you're not logged in, but you have stuff in your car, you should probably, you know, log in. So I'm going to just put in a login and sign up section there. Here, you should be able to, you know, go to the items in your cart. So you can probably, like, go to an item listing or something like that product page. And then you should probably see maybe some similar items.
05:06:21.300 - 05:06:55.050, Speaker D: I'm not sure how wise that is because at this point, we really want people to convert and actually check out. So I'm going to keep this one really simple. Maybe we'll have a big CTA to, like, place your order. Actually, you know what? Let's actually do this. We'll have one right here that says place, order. Okay. And so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the profile page.
05:06:56.230 - 05:06:58.062, Speaker C: So that's.
05:06:58.126 - 05:07:32.676, Speaker D: Yeah, that's next. Now we're going to have a bunch of, a bunch of member only links. So I'm going to just make like maybe five or five just to cover all my bases and close those ones off. Okay. So when I think about the profile page, like, this doesn't need to be something that's super crazy. I think, you know, there should be some account settings here. Definitely some way to maybe, you know, see your interests and get to that section.
05:07:32.676 - 05:07:57.206, Speaker D: Maybe this profile is a bit more involved is what I'm trying to get at customer service. Maybe like a help center. I think that's a pretty cool option. And then I think maybe your orders like a way to see what you've done in the past. And I think that's it. So, I mean, this isn't a really big task that I'm working on right now. I think ultimately, you know, we're keeping it really simple.
05:07:57.206 - 05:08:17.370, Speaker D: So I have orders here now for orders. This one's a little bit more. Yeah, I think we need to think through it a bit. So we have like, probably like a search and filter. People could have many orders, so we need to account for that. Wait for people to filter through. Probably the most important thing is like the orders that are in progress.
05:08:17.370 - 05:08:24.140, Speaker D: So I'll just throw that in there. Then we have past orders.
05:08:26.000 - 05:08:26.800, Speaker C: And then.
05:08:26.920 - 05:08:51.008, Speaker D: Finally we have a help section. Beautiful. So, I mean, I think that's what comprises of an order screen search. Definitely in progress. We definitely need to see all our orders and maybe a way to contact somebody if something's gone wrong. Maybe that's something that's like an faq section. I'm not entirely sure just yet.
05:08:51.184 - 05:08:55.540, Speaker C: And then the final, the final, final.
05:08:55.840 - 05:09:21.562, Speaker D: Screen that we're going to work on is wishlist. Okay, so with wishlists, this one is pretty simple as well. So you probably have like your saved items. Then you probably have a way to like, go to those items. That's why I'm putting saved items. And then we have maybe some sharing options. Maybe you can share a list with somebody.
05:09:21.562 - 05:10:13.982, Speaker D: I mean, when I think about like, maybe my partner and I are buying gifts for people or, you know, we're trying to buy gifts for our kids and we have lists for each individual kid. I don't know, maybe there's something like that in terms of like a work flow or a user flow. So maybe sharing options and what that looks like and how you link out and support, you know, internal third party linking, I don't know, maybe some social media stuff. And then we have similar items. I think this one's a really interesting one, just trying to get people back into the funnel of adding stuff. And I think that pretty much details what I think is a pretty good sitemap. I mean, we could go into search and talk about like what does it look like when you click search? You have like an overlay, but we're getting more into the nitty gritty of, you know, maybe search results.
05:10:13.982 - 05:10:41.304, Speaker D: Search goes to search results or something. Maybe you can add one like that. But there's not much to really add there and I think that is pretty much it for our sitemap. Great job, everyone. This is, let's take a look so we can go ahead now and actually link them up. So I'm going to delete this. We are not going to need it and I'm going to select everything, bring them down and then we can link them.
05:10:41.304 - 05:10:50.584, Speaker D: So shopping. Let's get our plugin first. I actually really love this part.
05:10:50.672 - 05:10:52.288, Speaker C: I know it sounds a bit childish.
05:10:52.344 - 05:11:43.636, Speaker D: But it's fun to just see everything come together and that's perfect. We have wishlist, then we're going to have orders and profile and then, and cart. I don't, I don't think it's useful to maybe bring login up here. I mean, I think that's pretty self explanatory. One thing I do want to note though, I mean, we can even go deeper than this. Like this probably isn't totally complete and that's fine, but like, there are sections in here where like we haven't even mentioned, like the product page, we haven't even mentioned certain things like, you know, deeper within like a category page. So there's a lot of different things that we are, you know, not looking into.
05:11:43.636 - 05:11:45.148, Speaker D: That's going to take a lot and.
05:11:45.164 - 05:11:48.412, Speaker C: A lot of time, but I very much urge everyone to kind of keep.
05:11:48.436 - 05:12:34.586, Speaker D: On going deeper until you feel like it's enough. And that is how we create a sitemap in Figma. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. I want to give you some very quick tips on how to build great sitemaps and not get stuck in the process. This may seem overwhelming, but it is really easy to pull off. So one of the big tips I always give people is don't think about two things at one time. If you're working on a sitemap, you know, you don't want to start thinking about where to put things while you're also thinking about what things to put.
05:12:34.586 - 05:13:16.766, Speaker D: Keep it simple, focus on one thing at a time and you'll make way more thoughtful decisions. So when we were thinking about some, these types of pages, like, yeah, it's great to start thinking of this content strategy. I love to, but we're not going that deep just yet. We were touching the first layer, and then, you know, we're digging deeper and deeper gradually. The second tip I'd like to give is to bring in your user flows. Now, your user flows should indicate the types of pages you need and where they may fit within the structure of your app. So I mentioned, you know, search not necessarily being an actual, like, link, but this user flow is something that we already had thought of.
05:13:16.766 - 05:13:59.850, Speaker D: We know that there's some sort of like intermittent overlay where they're searching and then they go to the search results and then they get to the page. So we already had an understanding of that model and that flow. So definitely use your user flows and your sketches. Now, speaking about sketching tools, now, you can definitely start with sketching, but once you start to revise, move it over into an online tool like Figma. It's great to see, like, you know, those structure maps that you can build. But ultimately this is where you're going to refine everything and move forward. I think another thing that people don't think about is colors.
05:13:59.850 - 05:14:21.182, Speaker D: I mean, you don't need to go crazy with colors. Just because it's the sitemap, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't have colors. I like to use colors to highlight things like screens that are maybe visible to certain users, like we have here with member only links and public links. It also makes your sitemap much easier to just remember instead of thinking of it as like a black and white set of cards.
05:14:21.286 - 05:14:22.570, Speaker C: That's super boring.
05:14:22.910 - 05:14:57.848, Speaker D: And I think the last thing, and this is it, don't aim for perfection. Things are going to change. You just want to set yourself up for success and give yourself the best chance possible to succeed. You're never going to get it perfect. I've seen things like this thrown out later in the process when there's like some sort of large product pivot. I need you to remember that once you have a good idea of what your product structure is going to look like, move on to your wireframes. Dig deeper and test some of those assumptions that you're making here, because these are a lot of assumptions.
05:14:57.848 - 05:15:09.380, Speaker D: This is just giving us a nice little bit of a plan to move forward. Your sitemap's not going to answer all the questions, but it will give you that starting point for your wireframes. So remember, be lean.
05:15:20.050 - 05:15:42.406, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So we're going to be talking about wireframes, so we're really going to get into designing very soon. But, you know, we're done. Our sitemap, we're done. User flows. You know, we've done a lot of sketching and, you know, we have a good understanding of the content and the structure that is going into our product. So now I think wireframing is pretty much the next step.
05:15:42.406 - 05:16:42.230, Speaker C: But the big question is, well, what is a wireframe? Now, you may have seen images like this when we were sketching, and wireframe is a low fidelity layout that, you know, serves three simple purposes. It presents the information that will be displayed on the page in a little bit more detail than our sketches and our user flows. It gives an outline of structure and layout of the page, and it conveys the overall direction and description of your user interface. It's basically, as you can see here, it's just like a blueprint of a building, but instead of a building, it describes the details clearly and specifically while giving everyone involved a good overview of the product. It's kind of like that middle ground between your sketches and higher fidelity designs and prototypes. They help you really plan layout interaction patterns for your users without worrying about distracting details like colors or copy or, or, you know, typography. You know, all those things can really bog down your design process.
05:16:42.230 - 05:17:35.042, Speaker C: Another thing to really know is that they are really heavily influenced from your prior work. So if you've done story mapping, you have user stories, if you've done things like user flows or sitemaps, I mean, all these different artifacts should really influence the way you create your wireframes. So just keep that in mind that you shouldn't just be like jumping in and I creating a whole bunch of wireframes and not necessarily really understanding the type of content that needs to be there and the requirements that need to be there. So really consult all those artifacts that you have, and if you don't have them, you know, talk to the right people that can get you that information, whether that be product managers, client stakeholders, internal stakeholders. You know, use your voice if you need those requirements to even start. So why do we use them? Two big reasons. I like using them because they really help to test your concepts and your structure.
05:17:35.042 - 05:18:13.692, Speaker C: So they really help you to understand how users will navigate your product. Sometimes you can use your wireframes to highlight certain areas that you think need to have prominence on a page to test if that piece of content is actually working and if the user flow makes sense. So this is one of the big reasons I use that, so that it could be like user flows again, but in much more detail. Understanding the different types of interactions and putting it into a wireframe makes it a little more easier to test with users to get, I guess, better results. The next best thing, actually, I think this is the number one thing, actually. You need to use them to learn. You know, they are fast, cheap and impermanent.
05:18:13.692 - 05:18:48.720, Speaker C: Don't get attached to wireframes. They're meant to change. As you gather more information through research and feedback from your clients and from your users, they're a great place to fail, and I don't mean that negatively. On a project, you want to fail as quickly as possible, and that means you want to test your assumptions as quick as possible before it gets to high fidelity designs or even development. You know, they serve as that common language for your team as well. They're complex enough to inform everyone, but simple enough to not get bogged down by too much detail. Now, the little kind of graph I have here is the build, measure, learn graph.
05:18:48.720 - 05:19:14.852, Speaker C: And if anyone's read lean startup, I think like, that's amazing because it's an amazing book. But if you haven't, you should definitely read lean startup. It talks a lot about building, measuring and learning. So what that essentially means is you build, and that could be a wireframe, that could be a sketch. You measure it against something, what metric you're testing against. It could be like, I want to know if this interaction works. I want to know if users actually are interested in my product.
05:19:14.852 - 05:19:48.926, Speaker C: You learn from those results and then you build again. So wireframes really help you to kind of implement that build, measure, learn cycle. So I want you always to think about that whenever you're kind of testing with users or just talking to other clients or stakeholders. You know, keep that in the back of your mind because the design process isn't linear. It's very iterative. So how can we use them? They're useful for three big reasons right now. You know, they help your team estimate the type of work they're going to complete, clarity and common understanding across the team.
05:19:48.926 - 05:20:15.154, Speaker C: They help your team understand what is going to be built. I mentioned this a little bit earlier. It gives them an opportunity to chime in as well if you're presenting to them, and you should always be presenting to them, even if it's just like ad hoc, you know, talk to your peer really quickly. Specs are kind of dated and wireframes can be really much more collaborative than that. So get your team involved as much as possible. The next thing is user testing. We use them a lot for user testing.
05:20:15.154 - 05:20:59.800, Speaker C: The sooner you test, the better. And that's the big thing, you know, like I said before, fail fast so you can get quick feedback without necessarily developing complex prototypes with all those different types of visual things like typography, color, and all the different types of details like that. So testing with users really uncover like the different types of pain points and opportunities. So this is a little customer journey map. You know, if you've created one at this point, that's great as well because it will really help you understand how the user moves throughout your product and other products. So really document how your user can move through your wireframes, understand like, what their pain points are. And usually there you'll understand that there are certain opportunities that you can really benefit from.
05:20:59.800 - 05:21:54.968, Speaker C: And I also like to, I think this is kind of inevitable. I really like to use these to, you know, demo to clients. It's a good way to get really quick feedback instead of like going all the way and sprinting towards like that beautiful design or that beautiful complex prototype. I mean, you got to remind them that it isn't the final design because, you know, you may have a client that is just like, this has no color or this has no like, typographic elements, like, what is this? It doesn't look good and it's not necessarily meant to look good. So you need to explain that to them just so they can give you some quick feedback on certain things like interactions and, you know, flows and just placement and layout and hierarchy. Another thing about getting quick feedback is that, you know, making changes to high fidelity designs is like really time intensive and you don't want to be making bigger changes when you're nearly done the product. You want to be making those changes as you go along.
05:21:54.968 - 05:22:22.148, Speaker C: And the earlier the better. So that's how we can use wireframes. We can definitely use them to, like, test. And I think, like, that is the best. Biggest thing is testing early and testing often and not worrying about the details. So I'll teach you next how to create them. Hey, everyone, and welcome back.
05:22:22.148 - 05:22:53.120, Speaker C: We're going to be talking about how do I create my own wireframes? So the one thing I really want to stress is to keep things simple. You know, don't worry about fidelity, especially when you're wireframing. You just need just enough to really get people to understand what you're trying to convey. Pencil and paper is probably the best way to wireframe quickly. You know, this is one of my mantras. Like, we've already done this. I mean, we sketched a bit, we did some user flows, and you've already kind of started wireframing.
05:22:53.120 - 05:23:18.796, Speaker C: Even if you have a whiteboard, you can use one. But I mean, pencil and paper are huge. You know, if you do have a client, you can polish them up to showcase some of your interactions or more prominent areas within your flows and, you know, pages that you're designing for. You can definitely like add a little bit more fidelity to just showcase or demo them. But you want to keep your colors to grayscale. White and black is perfectly fine. You know, grays in between.
05:23:18.796 - 05:23:35.294, Speaker C: Don't go crazy on fonts. Maybe two. You can even get away with one. You can easily show hierarchy with bolding fonts as well, or increasing the size. Avoid any flashy images. You can use rectangles and squares and, you know, an x through the middle. Just say that that would be an image.
05:23:35.294 - 05:23:38.166, Speaker C: And for videos, you can add a triangle in the middle to indicate that.
05:23:38.198 - 05:23:39.278, Speaker D: That'S one as well.
05:23:39.414 - 05:24:10.864, Speaker C: So, you know, keep it simple. Don't worry about fidelity, especially at this stage. Next thing is you got to ask yourself some pretty important questions. You know, what are the users and the businesses goals when interacting with this page? How can the content be organized to support these goals? What should the user see when they first come to a page? What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page? I think these questions are a perfect segue really into wireframing and, you know, consult your old artifacts.
05:24:10.912 - 05:24:12.704, Speaker D: Right here I have a story map.
05:24:12.832 - 05:24:44.270, Speaker C: And definitely go back to the story map if you have one, to really consult like user stories and requirements so you can understand what will be on every page. We even did user flows as well, and we're going to get into that right now. So consult your user flows and your sitemap. You know, as I consult my sitemap, I'm always looking at the key requirements and hierarchies for a certain page. I want to know like what is the most and least important thing that should be there. You know, different user stories. Like, they're really great because they're better indicator of what exactly needs to be built from a user's perspective.
05:24:44.270 - 05:25:33.946, Speaker C: And a proper, like, if you have a story map, like I mentioned before, we would, you know, have user stories for every single instance throughout the product journey. And then we would come together to discuss which is like the riskiest part of the product we want to tackle first. So, like for our client, we probably want to, you know, tackle search or the homepage or maybe the initial registration, all those different points where it really depends on users actually finding products or registering their interests so that way the product can actually be successful. They're high traffic areas and the interactions are pretty integral to the user goal and we need to get them right to succeed. I always, and I mean always, tackle the riskiest features first. So like I mentioned before, like, that's a perfect segue into this because everyone has a different definition of what risk is, and it can mean a lot of different things. It could be features that dictate the success of the product.
05:25:33.946 - 05:26:29.286, Speaker C: It could be certain assumptions that your team and client have for a certain feature. When I'm in a kickoff meeting or I'm talking to clients, I really kind of, I have a list of risky assumptions that we have as well, and I mark all those things down. Anything from what we assume the user wants or assume will be a good feature, or certain things like risks. There are high traffic areas that really depend on nailing the interaction in order to succeed for the business, for our client, if we release a search that just doesn't work or the interaction is way too complex, the product essentially will fail. So there's a lot of things like that that we need to account for and we should probably be focusing a lot of our attention on like in comparison to another feature like profile or a wish list. So always keep that in mind. Another big thing is to bring your team into the process.
05:26:29.286 - 05:26:51.176, Speaker C: I mean, this is huge. You should often be talking to every member of your team. It doesn't matter. Product managers for business goals, developers for like development strategy. You can even talk to quality assurance people like quality analyst people to talk about just how certain things work within the product and what their expectations are. Other disciplines will provide priceless insight into.
05:26:51.208 - 05:26:52.992, Speaker D: The ways you can build those wireframes.
05:26:53.056 - 05:27:30.634, Speaker C: So make sure that you include others in your process. It may be a business goal that you aren't meeting or a technical challenge that you may have, like for certain interactions, you want to come to life. So tap into your peers example of, you know, trying to do things that are way too hard to develop. So if you have like a wireframe that is just way too complex, you should definitely be talking to your developers. I often take a look at dribble. I mean, I mention dribble a lot because it's a great place to get inspiration and all that. But the majority of the designs showcased there will probably never be built and have never been built because they just are way too complex and time consuming.
05:27:30.634 - 05:28:17.190, Speaker C: I'm not saying that it isn't possible because everything is possible with enough time and money, but most times you want to build your way up to something that is like considered perfect. We may release in different stages whether that be like a minimum viable product that has only the features that you truly need to validate if your product has any legs, or sometimes we may be releasing on top of that the next best features. And over time we'll get to a point where we can really hone in on the design and polish different things. But generally you want to release in kind of waves. Instead of building out a product from zero to 100, you want to get like 25% of the way there. Build another set of features, improve on other features based off of what you've.
05:28:17.230 - 05:28:19.606, Speaker D: Learned from your wireframe testing and even.
05:28:19.638 - 05:29:02.350, Speaker C: Just basic prototype testing. So remember, loop your team in. It's really going to help you understand what you can cannot build it. Also really help you understand what kind of like different business goals you may have that you haven't considered. Maybe stakeholders have certain goals. So these are the tips I often give other designers for when we want to actually use wireframes and when we actually want to create our own. So follow these tips and you'll be well on your way to making some awesome wireframes that are based off of facts and different types of data and are used to actually validate everyone's assumptions.
05:29:13.730 - 05:29:53.754, Speaker D: Hey everyone, welcome back. We are going to be working on wireframes and a bunch of other things in this section. What you're going to learn is going to be huge. You're going to learn to how to build or at least start building and using a small asset library. This means we are going to jump into some very quick things about styles when it comes to color and typography. We're going to learn a little bit more about components and maybe how to create some more complex components that allow you to have variants and these different layer styles. It's going to be super fun.
05:29:53.754 - 05:30:12.306, Speaker D: And then once we work on that and finish it, we are going to work on some wireframes for ourselves. That means we're going to build a bunch of pages based off of our user flows and sketches and sitemap. So if you have all that knowledge that you've built up over the last.
05:30:12.378 - 05:30:13.530, Speaker C: I don't know how long you've been.
05:30:13.570 - 05:30:54.884, Speaker D: Watching, but I mean, last couple of days, last couple of hours, we've learned so much about user flows, sketching and sitemaps and we can use all that information to really funnel into these wireframes. Since we are starting to get a really good understanding of where certain content is placed so we're going to learn a bunch about that. We're going to build home screens, wish list screens. We'll go into even some product pages and stuff like that. We'll build some fun pages together and then we are going to be using a couple of different plugins this time. So definitely going to be using lorem ipsum. So if you do not have that plugin, definitely grab it.
05:30:54.884 - 05:31:22.030, Speaker D: That will let you come up with some easy, easy content. So definitely, definitely grab that plugin. Okay. I can't wait to jump in and start building some of these amazing screens. See you soon. Hey, everyone. Welcome back.
05:31:22.030 - 05:32:07.750, Speaker D: We are going to learn about components and we're going to create like a basic button component that we can reuse. So many of you may already know how to create a component, but I just want to do a quick refresher for some of you that don't. So I'm here in just a test file and I urge you all to just create a regular design file and follow along. So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to move around, I'm going to press f and I'm just going to create just a frame like this. It doesn't matter right now because we're creating the body of the button. Then I'm going to press t for the actual text tool up here and I'm going to click inside that frame here. We're just going to write button label.
05:32:07.750 - 05:32:27.690, Speaker D: So there we go. We have a button label and I'm just going to adjust that to 16 pixels. Or we can leave it. Yeah, 16 is fine. We can adjust that to 16 or 14. I like to keep my buttons around that size and I'm going to give it a medium font weight. You can choose any font you want.
05:32:27.690 - 05:32:51.710, Speaker D: I'm using enter. It's a really great font. And that's it. Now we are going to go to this frame layer and I'm going to rename it so you can press Ctrl R command R, whatever product you're using, whether it's Mac or windows. And I'm going to just type in button. There we go. Now, the great thing is I'm going to go over to auto layout.
05:32:51.710 - 05:33:37.104, Speaker D: So I'm going to adjust the spacing between items to zero because we don't really need that right now. And then I'm going to adjust the actual horizontal spacing to something like maybe 24 pixels. And I'm not going to have any vertical padding right now. We're actually going to make sure that the vertical resizing is fixed and we can adjust that height to whatever we want. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep it at, let's say 40 pixels in height and make sure my content is centered. I'm going to zoom in now. And there we go.
05:33:37.104 - 05:34:10.886, Speaker D: We have a button. We can go ahead and adjust things like the border radius. We can adjust things like the fill so we can give it say maybe like a nice blue fill and we can adjust the label within to white. So I just pressed FFF and there we go. We have our button label. Perfect. And that is everything.
05:34:10.886 - 05:34:47.390, Speaker D: Now this button label is kind of responsive so you can, you can keep it to like HUD content like hit this or you can make it a fixed width if you want it to spread across something. So that's our button. And what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to press the component button here. And there you go. Now we have a component. So remember, if you are using components, they are only available for professional users across multiple files. So I won't be able to access this button from another file unless I took it.
05:34:47.390 - 05:35:33.020, Speaker D: This is the master one with that, those little squares over here. But unless I took this, copied and pasted it. So now I can go ahead into my assets file and I can see that that components there and I can use it any which way I want. And even when I update this master, it's going to update that as well. So that's how we're going to create a basic button component of. Hey everyone, welcome back. So we just created a basic component, but we all know that there are many types of components out there.
05:35:33.020 - 05:35:39.260, Speaker D: They have components with icons which we're not really going to get into just yet, but we have components with icons.
05:35:39.300 - 05:35:40.180, Speaker C: Like buttons like that.
05:35:40.220 - 05:36:18.022, Speaker D: We have buttons that are different colors, different sizes. So what we're going to do now is we're going to create something we call a variant. So let's jump right in. So I'm going to make a copy of this component. So I'm just going to duplicate it and drag it below and here I can go ahead and I'm going to actually make this button way larger. This is like my marketing button. So it's going to be like 56 pixels and it's going to have like more width on it and then I'm going to create another couple of variations.
05:36:18.022 - 05:36:54.540, Speaker D: So I'm going to have a button over here as well. And this one is actually going to be like an inverted button. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep the fill to zero and I'm going to take the stroke here, give it a stroke and go back to my document colors. So it's going to have a stroke on the outside and then the actual fill of the label is going to be the same as the blue. So now we have a stroke like that and we're going to do the exact same thing. So we can actually just copy this. Oops.
05:36:54.540 - 05:37:42.580, Speaker D: We can copy this instance that we're using and just shrink it down. So now we have four buttons. Now the thing is you don't want to create like four different separate components because that can be really hard to just manage. So what we'll do here is we're going to select them all and I'm going to actually remove this instance. I'm going to select these all and I'm going to actually detach the instances. So if I right click here and where is it? Right there. So for Mac users it's going to be command shift b.
05:37:42.580 - 05:38:24.008, Speaker D: But this is your shortcut. So I'm going to use my shortcut or I'm just going to click there and now I have all these buttons and they are nothing components yet. I'm going to go into this little drop down here and create a component set. So what's going to do is it's going to create this stroked bounding box that basically encompasses all these versions. And this is what we call a variant or variance. Now what we're going to do here is we are going to look over here into the variant panel. So if I click this box, I can come here and specify properties.
05:38:24.008 - 05:38:45.928, Speaker D: And properties are basically the distinguishers between the types of variants. So you can have a property for like say type of button. So that could be the primary and secondary. Then you can have a, another property, you can have a lot of them. You can have a property for size. So that's we're going to do, we're going to create two properties. So we already have one here, we can double click on that just to rename it.
05:38:45.928 - 05:39:24.928, Speaker D: And we're going to make the first one called size and we're going to select our larger one. So I'm going to hold shift. And here you can see the current variant. Right now the size is set to default, but we're going to just rename that and we're going to rename that to large. So, okay, now we have those set to large and now we're going to take our smaller versions and we're going to click that and go to the size and we're going to rename those as regular. And now what we're going to do is we're going to click that button again and click the properties up here. And we're going to create a new component property.
05:39:24.928 - 05:40:02.976, Speaker D: So you can choose what type of property you want, whether it's Boolean interface, swap text, and these we will get into later. These are called component properties. A little bit more advanced and we're going to go into the variant. That's what we want. We want another variant and we're going to name this one type. So basically what we're going to do is we're going to say these two are the type primary and these two, we're going to call them the type of secondary. And there you go, we have our components.
05:40:02.976 - 05:41:10.214, Speaker D: Now, what does this look like in the assets panel? Let's delete our original button. So now we still have the same button here, but now when we drag it, you can see on the side that now instead of having to go back into your assets panel and pick new buttons over and over again, you have them over here. So now I can specify that this is a large button and it's secondary and you can swap between these different variants really easily. And if you want to make sure everything's neat here, you can even adjust the stroke of the bounding box to whatever color you want. You can actually make it an auto layout frame and stack those nicely on top of one another if you really wanted to. That all comes down to preference, but that's how you create variants within Figma. Hey everyone and welcome back.
05:41:10.214 - 05:41:56.308, Speaker D: We are in our wireframes resource. Before we begin, I want to talk about the assets panel and how to use some of the things that we have here. Now if I just click onto the canvas like I'm doing right now and I look to the right, I can see all my text styles for things like buttons, body copy, body bold copy, body regular copy, and headings. I can see things like color styles. And then I can even go into my assets panel and see all the different types of components that are available to me. I have inputs, I have icons, tons of icons, I have content blocks. So I can drag a cardinal like this, zoom in and I can start messing around with it.
05:41:56.308 - 05:42:42.120, Speaker D: Now, before I get into just how to use that, I want to just run through this really quickly. So these are all our typography styles that we're going to just use for wireframes we're keeping it really simple. You don't need to like modify these, but they're over here. I'm going to teach you how to use these later, but I'm going to teach you how to create your own typography and color styles. But this is something that we don't really need to get into at the moment. We have our color styles here, we have our icons which are all individual components that you can easily swap out. So if I use one of these icons and I drag it out here, I can go ahead and you know, find a new one that I can replace it with up here in the instance panel.
05:42:42.120 - 05:43:27.768, Speaker D: So let me just delete that. Also if I go over here I can see all the different components. I have things like buttons, we have icon specific buttons, we have different elements and these are all variants and everyone shouldn't understand what variants are by now, but these are all variants. So if I use like say this tag button and I drag it out I can, you know, choose the type of variant whether it's like outlined or the light version. Then we have this other thing called component properties. These are these other types of properties on the component. Now you don't really need to know how to create them but I'm going to show you how to quickly use them.
05:43:27.768 - 05:44:05.850, Speaker D: So as you can see, I have this tag selected and if I don't want an icon with this tag, all I have to do is, you know, use this boolean property over here and just click that. That toggle will turn it off. And as you notice, the other component property went away. If I turn it back on it appears and now I can select the type of icon component that goes with it. So there's a lot of flexibility to all the things you can do. Think of component properties as things that you can easily turn off and shut off, not things like, you know, changing color or things like changing the size. Really it is for turning on and off things.
05:44:05.850 - 05:44:57.356, Speaker D: So here's an example. I have a bunch of component properties here, but here is the variant property. So I can turn it into a horizontal card, I can turn it into a vertical card, but then I can say that hey, this card doesn't have an image and this card doesn't have an icon or just an image and no icon and maybe it doesn't have a headline and maybe it doesn't have a subheading and or content or a button or any buttons for that matter. So there's a lot of different things you can do with those properties just to turn things off. That doesn't necessarily suit you. And if you know, you can't find anything that works, just detach that instance by right clicking and going over here and then you can make that card whatever you want. So definitely a lot of flexibility here.
05:44:57.356 - 05:45:43.354, Speaker D: You're going to have a lot of different types of components, different types of inputs, different types of placeholders that you can use. And over here to the right, you have some base components. And these components, if you want to make an edit to the style of the inputs here, you're going to make them on the base component. Basically, these components make up the majority of the components in here. So it's easy to, instead of changing all the different types of variants, all you have to do is change, say, one value. So an example is if I come over here, I can change, say this color to like 700 and there you go. And like, it's changing over here instead of having to change it twice there.
05:45:43.354 - 05:46:19.830, Speaker D: So definitely don't delete these, but these are going to be where you're going to basically change the styling of some of these components. If you really want to. I would definitely urge you to, you know, keep things really simple. You don't need to, you know, do that for all these different types of components. But like I said, oops. Like I said, you can just take these components, you know, use like, if you have a label or content you want to write, you can write them right in the property here and say, say something like hello. And it's going to be reflected in the component.
05:46:19.830 - 05:47:00.488, Speaker D: You can specify things like icon left and a type of icon and icon right and so on. And you can specify the variance as well. So these are the components we're going to use to build out our wireframes really, really quickly. This is going to really help speed up our workflow. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. So if you have any sketches, bring them into this file. If you have things like your sitemap that are going to dictate the content on the homepage, bring them into this file.
05:47:00.488 - 05:47:45.810, Speaker D: We're going to work together right now to work on some of the different pages within our app. So let's start with our homepage. Now. I have a pretty good understanding of what I want to build already based off of all the stuff that we've done thus far. I know that our homepage needs to have things like recommendations ready, needs to have things like maybe things pointing you towards, deals to buying stuff, definitely categories to pull people in towards and a really good search. So let's jump right in and I'm going to show you how to build a quick wireframe. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press, press f and I'm going to just use the iPhone 13 Pro as my frame and I'm going to rename this to home.
05:47:45.810 - 05:48:24.540, Speaker D: Okay, so we all know how to use those wireframe components. And what I'm going to start it with is I'm going to actually start with the navigation. So I'm going to grab our little toolbar component here and place it right at the bottom them. And here we go. So now that it's placed inside the frame and you can see it right here, it's inside that frame, we can just resize it to fit the frame. And now we can specify the different labels we want to see. So I think there's going to be a couple of different options here.
05:48:24.540 - 05:48:53.952, Speaker D: I think we're going to need around like maybe four. So I'm just going to specify the amount of Navda items there and I'm going to jump right in. So definitely going to need a home and we're going to need wish list maybe. That's what I was thinking. Definitely don't need to follow me in terms of where I think the content should go and what I think the content should be. I would definitely urge you to do that yourself. We have a cart.
05:48:53.952 - 05:49:21.026, Speaker D: And then what going to do is I'm going to go ahead and select a new instance, a new icon there. So I'm going to use the wish list icon. I don't know what icon. Maybe a heart. Yeah, that works. And oops, there we go. What else should we choose? So for profile maybe would it be under something like user.
05:49:21.026 - 05:49:34.420, Speaker D: Oh, there it is. Perfect. I think that could work. So I want them to be able to see like maybe their orders really easily. And this one's really easy. Instead of a home, we should probably use something like a cart. Perfect.
05:49:34.420 - 05:50:02.276, Speaker D: So there we go. We have our versions ready. Now I can set this property to active. So definitely nice little nav that we've just created really easily. So that's going to be our nav for now. And what I'm going to do next is I'm going to go into my assets panel once again and I'm going to start top down. So I'm going to maybe build from the very top here and go all the way down.
05:50:02.276 - 05:50:41.188, Speaker D: And I'm going to get a search input. So I see all my input fields here. What do we have so I'm just going to use the regular input field and you may notice that, okay, this has a label but now I can actually turn that label off because that variant has been created and then I'm going to switch that value to search. I'm not worried too much about like the looks here, like as long as there's enough contrast, you know that's going to be totally enough for us. And so I have a little search icon already placed there. Okay. So making it really easy and apparent to search right at the top.
05:50:41.188 - 05:51:22.180, Speaker D: So we have that ready and I think it would be nice to have, you know, maybe some text here. I'm just going to press t for the text tool that says something like a welcoming thing. So maybe like hi Leslie, exclamation mark. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my styles so you press this little icon here in text. So I'm going to go my text styles and I'm going to select maybe like heading SDE. I like the other one better and we can even go into our fills and then choose the type of color we want. So there we go.
05:51:22.180 - 05:52:06.500, Speaker D: So I'm just going to do that and then I'm going to make a copy of that and drag it down and I think we should do something like oh, we have some recommendations. Okay. And I'm going to select all that with command a or control a and then we can specify the text. So I'm going to leave the body copy here at like medium or something like that. And then we can set that to 600 just creating a little bit of contrast between the two. So I'm going to actually group these. So I'm going to go right click and I'm going to frame that selection, turn it into an auto layout of frame.
05:52:06.500 - 05:52:34.480, Speaker D: So I'm going to move a little quickly now. And now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to make this really easy on us. I'm going to set up some sort of foundation where there's just like auto layout. So once again I'm going to frame this selection. So I'm using my shortcut which is option command g and I'm going to make this an auto layout. And so here we can, you know, start making some nice changes wherever we can. Just like pop content in and out.
05:52:34.480 - 05:53:10.002, Speaker D: We can make this the full width and the full height and specify, you know, just like the padding around. So say we want like maybe 24 pixel padding on the edges and then at the top, you know, maybe there's like 56. It just comes down there. And all the content within the. We can just select it all and set the fill. So now anytime we have like content here, it's always going to span like the entire width. So there we go.
05:53:10.002 - 05:53:37.826, Speaker D: We have like an introduction now. I think the next thing to do is to probably have, let's see what other pieces of content we have here. I'm going to go into my content blocks and grab a card and I'm going to drag that right into that auto layout frame. We can just move it down with our arrow keys. And here we can actually start specifying some of the things. Look, I don't want any buttons, so we'll just turn those off. And I think, I think that will be good.
05:53:37.826 - 05:54:12.372, Speaker D: And maybe we'll have like a price here so we can just change that to like say $25 and we can call this like the product name and. Yeah, and now we can actually just shrink it as we see fit. And now we have a product card. I'm going to make a copy of that. And I'm actually going to group them into a auto layout frame. So I just press shift a while selecting them both. And there we go.
05:54:12.372 - 05:55:00.030, Speaker D: We've created some sort of like container here, which is essentially just like a vertical scroll, but it doesn't really have a title. I think the best way to do that is maybe just bring in a title bar. And here we can remove the divider, set this to like maybe small, and set this to fill the container, maybe not button two. We can see how like we can just like run in here and change all these types of buttons. So maybe this is like, okay, so we can set the properties and I want this style to be like a ghost button. And I can say something like, oh, see all. And the title is something like just for you.
05:55:00.030 - 05:55:24.740, Speaker D: And then we can take these and press shift a. And we are in an auto layout frame again. And now we can just specify that this is like maybe only eight pixels. Apartheid. And we have like our own little content area here. So now that we have that, I think we're getting pretty close. I'm going to just right click on that frame to an empty area and drag it out some more.
05:55:24.740 - 05:56:02.232, Speaker D: This can go right to the bottom. We can specify that we want this fixed to the bottom and we can say this is right there to the bottom, the constraint. And what I'm going to do actually is I'm going to take this and copy it and it's going to make a new copy. Now I want to make a deal section. And this is where I'm going to start messing around a bit with the actual card. So I'm going to take these two cards, make kind of like a grid. So I'm going to select them both, set them to fill.
05:56:02.232 - 05:56:22.678, Speaker D: Okay, that looks a little messed up. I don't think we need all this content. So I'm going to, now that I'm selecting both of them, I can remove things like the content. I can, you know, keep the product name like that. That's totally fine. And I can keep that just the same. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to select them both.
05:56:22.678 - 05:56:46.016, Speaker D: Whoops. Let's go in there, select them both, and let's bring them up in size. Now we can even come in here and, you know, mess around a bit. Like this title is maybe a little bit too big. So we can make it smaller. So now we have the little grid of items. Oops.
05:56:46.016 - 05:57:26.490, Speaker D: Let's bring this in a little bit and we can select these together. I just made that copy shift a and maybe 16 pixels apart or something. And these two are right now 32 pixels, but we can make them like 16 pixels apart. And we have a grid of items. So now our wireframes are starting to come to life a bit. I think the last thing that we do need is maybe just a categories page or something on here. Just a place where people can easily come to see, you know, what kind of categories I can jump into right away.
05:57:26.490 - 05:57:41.580, Speaker D: So here we go. I have my categories title. I'll just keep that. See all there? And I'm going to modify this card a bit. So I don't want an image. I don't even want an icon. I think all we need is a subheading.
05:57:41.580 - 05:58:14.590, Speaker D: And I'm pretty sure we could just like, you know, make it centered. And I'm going to select that text. Jump in there again, get right down to the text layer and center it. And there we go. And how many pixels should this be? So I'm going to make it like maybe like a horizontal scroll. So this can be like just hugging the content. This can be set to hug the content.
05:58:14.590 - 05:58:42.040, Speaker D: Okay, so let's take a look at our layers. So you have a lot of layers here now. So there we go. We can remove this one. So I'm going to ungroup that and we can actually spread it out. So it's something along the lines of this. Okay, so we have like these squares now.
05:58:42.040 - 05:59:34.554, Speaker D: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just, you know, come up with some category names. So I have tech, I have fashion and the last one maybe something like gaming and we can jump right in here and we can like tighten it up a bit. And there you go. We basically just created a, our own homepage really quickly. So we have like a search which I really wanted to bring in. Obviously, I'm going to think I'm going to come up with like different variations here and that's what you should do too. You should come up with different variations of like your homepage and, you know, start choosing and testing which one is you think is the best in terms of like the content strategy and just like the hierarchy of information here.
05:59:34.554 - 06:00:10.480, Speaker D: But I have like my, my, just for you personalized products. I have deals and I have like a categories page. I also have a nice navigation at the bottom, an easy way to search. So that's it for our homepage. Hey, everyone, welcome back. I want to make another page right now. So I think what we're going to focus on at the moment is just the cart page.
06:00:10.480 - 06:00:53.732, Speaker D: So very, very important part of this whole app. We want to ensure that when people come to the cart page they are going to be able to easily jump right out and just, you know, check out and get through the process. So I've just duplicated this frame and I have like this auto layout frame on the inside that's just going to allow me to like, you know, delete comment and everything's going to be responsive so we can do that. And I'm going to name this one my cart. And before we go any further, I'm going to switch this to the active instance. Turn that one off. So now we know which one we're on.
06:00:53.732 - 06:01:36.790, Speaker D: And now the next thing we are going to need is we are going to have to create some interesting stuff here. So I'm going to delete that and I'm going to delete this. Now what I'm going to do is you may notice that like I'm not really caring too much about like the container names in the final resources. I'm going to rename everything just to keep it neat for everyone. But when I'm going through my wireframes, like I really do do not care that much about renaming layers just yet. I try my best to, but if I'm working really quickly like I am now, I really don't care. So definitely keep that in mind.
06:01:36.790 - 06:02:04.384, Speaker D: So I have these layers. I'm going to just delete one of them. And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to take this and use some horizontal cards. I'm going to delete this. So I have this massive horizontal card that we can also delete that frame on the outside. So I have this horizontal card here and then go into this right side. Okay.
06:02:04.384 - 06:02:25.210, Speaker D: Everything looks good. Make sure all that contents there. I don't think we're going to need the icon on this card, especially when it's in your cart. Like, we just want them to get in and out. So I'm just thinking about what. That's all the information they're going to definitely need in order to, you know, check out appropriately. So I have the product.
06:02:25.210 - 06:02:42.142, Speaker D: And there we go. Oops. That one went right outside the frame. So maybe there's like three products. So that's fine. So there we go. So far, we have the products in our cart.
06:02:42.142 - 06:03:07.454, Speaker D: The next thing to do is to think about the content within. So I'm just going to take this container and, like, just drag a copy over. I'm holding option down and I'm going to switch the direction. So sign that to fill the container. All the content within. I'm going to select them all to fill the container. This one, I'm going to have it right aligned.
06:03:07.454 - 06:03:30.130, Speaker D: So now I have this neat little thing here. Wherever we have both the, like, I'm going to have, like, a title here saying, like, the cart total. And, you know, the other information over here, I'm just going to change that to hug the contents. There we go. Because the text was spanning too high. So, oops. Cart total.
06:03:30.130 - 06:04:00.772, Speaker D: So we can actually bump this down in terms of, like, the size here. I'm going to just use 16 or maybe 20. Yeah, 20 is fine. And I'm gonna come over here and, you know, say this is gonna be the car total of $75. Before I go any further, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna create a copy because I think I'm gonna need this again. And I'm gonna bump this size up. So there's gonna be maybe like a heading around, like, there.
06:04:00.772 - 06:04:29.770, Speaker D: And it's gonna be really dark. This is going to be set to hug the contents just like that. And there we go. So we've hugged the contents. The next part is when I am thinking about checking out, definitely want to know, like, okay, is this delivering to my house? Delivered to Leslie and the address. So you can do a couple things here. I have plugins that really help with this.
06:04:29.770 - 06:05:07.130, Speaker D: So you can go into your plugins and you can go to, I have one called content reels. So definitely grab this plugin if you don't have it, or just use your own address just for the time being. And what this lets you do is just the free content allows you to, you know, plug and play. So I'm gonna go to like a us full address and it's just gonna give me like a basic address like that and it fills it right in for me. So I have that address. We can actually switch this to a line at the top. These can actually come down in size.
06:05:07.130 - 06:05:28.058, Speaker D: They're a little bit big for what we need. They're taking up too much horizontal space. This one can come down in size as well. And this is something that could probably be bolded. Perfect. Okay, so now we have that. And now I'm going to go into my assets layer.
06:05:28.058 - 06:05:57.290, Speaker D: And I think we need a big button here. So I'm going to drop that in and move it down to the bottom here. I'm going to set that to fill container. And for my button, I'm going to go ahead and say that I want this to say checkout. So I'm editing it right in the properties over here instead of having to, like, deep click into the layers. And I think, like, maybe there's like a cart button. I don't know, something like that that says like, hey, check out right away.
06:05:57.290 - 06:06:44.474, Speaker D: I'm gonna use just like a horizontal rule because I think maybe there's an option here. I don't know. I'm gonna put this in and I'm not sure how I feel about it just yet, but I think there's, like, a way that we can, you know, bring stuff like this in to, like, the cartae to say something like, hey, others bought similar things, so, you know, you should buy them too. And I don't think we need content for this. We can definitely shrink the height, though. And there we go. I think this is going to suffice for our cart because when people first come to this screen, what they're going to see is something like this based off of the height of the phone.
06:06:44.474 - 06:07:34.680, Speaker D: And so they'll be able to click the checkout really quickly. And still, if they're not sure about what they want to buy, I mean, they can add more things to the cart, but they definitely see everything that they need right away to start the checkout process. So that's how you create a cart screen as a wireframe. Hey, everyone, and welcome back. I am going to work on one last screen and that is the profile screen. So I'm just going to, once again, I'm going to take this copy, drag it over here. And one thing I do want to remind everyone is when you're working on these wireframes, I mean, it's not the end all and be all.
06:07:34.680 - 06:08:10.898, Speaker D: We are going to definitely work to, you know, change these to be a little bit more different, maybe. It really depends on the direction we're going to change. The direction we're definitely going to take with some of these, these different concepts that we have here. But the whole point of wireframe is just to get those ideas out, definitely a much more, you know, quick and iterative way. So, you know, don't spend too much time, like, worrying about, like, how things look, because things change pretty quickly, especially in design. So the profile page is going to have a pretty similar makeup. It's going to have a profile header.
06:08:10.898 - 06:08:42.980, Speaker D: I think one of the things is going to change here is maybe we have something that is very personalized. You have your own profile and items that you want to buy and interest that interests you. Maybe there is some sense of, you know, maybe there is, like a social media aspect to it. I'm not sure. So maybe there is like an image and, oops, I'm going to take this again because it's been really useful. So I'm going to just drag that into here. So maybe there is like an aspect of, like some sort of social media.
06:08:42.980 - 06:09:07.490, Speaker D: I'm not sure just yet. So we have, I don't know, I'm trying to think of a last name, Leslie, maybe Flores. So we have that. And I'm going to use the plugin called Lorem Ipsum. So you definitely should have this by now. I mean, this is a great plugin. I'm just going to generate, and it's going to close the plugin right after I do it and generate some content for me.
06:09:07.490 - 06:09:50.920, Speaker D: We can make that smaller and that is that. So we have like, maybe like a profile image that they can edit. I mean, we can even make it a little more apparent. We can go into our assets panel and go into our buttons and grab a button, throw that in there, and we could say this is like a small button and it's like light version, so it's very secondary and say something like edit profile. So that looks pretty good. So we have, like, this area here. This probably can fit in there.
06:09:50.920 - 06:10:22.282, Speaker D: So I was just holding command while I was dragging that so it can go inside that auto layout frame. And I think we're going to steal this divider. So sometimes I'm just like, I'm not even using the assets panel. I'm just like copying, you know, different components over. So I'm going to steal that and throw that in there. Now, the interesting part about this now is that I'm going to actually take these. So I'm going to actually leave these here because I'm going to reuse them.
06:10:22.282 - 06:10:44.052, Speaker D: But I'm going to take these and I put them in there. You'll notice that it's acting kind of weird. So fill the container and hug it. And then we could specify the height. I'm going to call this like my interest section. And the content here is going to be like maybe like gaming. So we have our interest gaming.
06:10:44.052 - 06:11:17.638, Speaker D: What else can we put here? Maybe we have another one. Oops, I'm gonna make a copy there, throw it in there and put to hug the content. This is where we can, you know, jump inside here and, you know, essentially delete some of the content that's in here. It's kind of confusing. So we have our frame and just going to set this to fill and I'm going to create another one that's in there. So now I have two. So I'm just going to leave it at that.
06:11:17.638 - 06:11:49.402, Speaker D: And I'm going to select these two and make them more squared. And over here, what I'm going to do is I am going to set this to like maybe reading. I mean, I personally love to read. And we have, I don't know, sports. And there we go. So we have like an interest section. And I'm thinking, you know, maybe they can come in here and they can see all their interests and, you know, be a quick way to go ahead and, you know, like, see those interests, edit those interests and so on.
06:11:49.402 - 06:12:21.554, Speaker D: So I'm gonna make a duplicate and drag that down. And now we have another section here. Now I think this is where they can get, you know, another maybe deep dive into their account. So maybe this account details. And over here we have things like your orders. And then we have other things like buy again and okay, maybe wish lists. So definitely some things here that we can use from the other part, like how we just drag those components over.
06:12:21.554 - 06:12:57.010, Speaker D: But there we go. Like, we've created a pretty simple profile page just by like throwing in the some quick components and staying true to what our goal is for this app. We want to make a personalized app for shopping, as personalized as it possibly can get. And now we've started exploring maybe this idea of having a profile that other people can maybe access. I'm not sure just yet. Maybe that's a post launch feature or something that we don't really build in right away, and it's more of like an account screen, but lots of different strategies can come out of from, you know, just simple wireframing. And that's how you create wireframes within Figma.
06:13:03.830 - 06:13:27.040, Speaker A: Congratulations. You made it all the way. Most other people have already given up, but not you. You clearly have what it takes to become a professional in this industry. So I would highly recommend you keep the momentum going and take the rest of Daniel's complete web and mobile design boot camp course. You could check it out in the description below, or watch that video right there on your screen to see everything you'll learn in the rest of the course.
