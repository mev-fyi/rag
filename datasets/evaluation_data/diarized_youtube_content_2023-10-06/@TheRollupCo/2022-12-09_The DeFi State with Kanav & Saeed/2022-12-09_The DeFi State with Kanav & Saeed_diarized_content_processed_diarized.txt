00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.226, Speaker A: GM. GM. And by GM, you know I really mean good afternoon if you're in some parts of the world, and good morning if you're in LA, and good night if you're in Europe. Welcome to the Defi state, a weekly show brought to you by Hashflow. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Benham. I host this show. I'm the head of community for Hashflow, and I actually have a co host on this show, the CEO of Hashflow, Varun, who's always here with me, and it makes the show that much more exciting.
00:00:34.226 - 00:01:14.386, Speaker A: On this show, we lead discussions with notable speakers, founders, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and generally the brightest minds in the industry. And we discuss everything from what the future of decentralization will look like to the future of crypto. I know I say this every time. My favorite thing about this show is that every guest brings something so different to the table and has such different insights on DFI, web3, and the world. I wouldn't have it any other way. If you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you're in the right place. If you're worried about the market and what's been happening, you're still in the right place.
00:01:14.386 - 00:02:09.750, Speaker A: We'll get to that, too. Also, if you'd like to share this space with your friends, I get this question every time. You can just click on the arrow at the top right of the space and then copy the link. Tweet it out to your feed, text it to your friends, whatever works. Some of you may know this, but we tweeted an announcement recently, and in case you missed it, that announcement is that Hashflow has just teamed up with wormhole to do cross chain trading, which means trading will be ultra gas efficient, MeV protected, and with zero slippage. It's only appropriate that after this announcement, we have the two following guests to talk about what this integration means and much more. Today, our special guests are Kanov, president of Jump Crypto, and Saeed, who does strategic partnerships at Jump.
00:02:09.750 - 00:02:12.360, Speaker A: What's up, guys? How are you?
00:02:14.730 - 00:02:16.920, Speaker B: Pretty good, Nicole. Yeah. Thanks for having us on.
00:02:17.850 - 00:02:31.950, Speaker C: No, excellent. Guys, I think we've been working on this integration for quite some time. Pretty excited to finally have it rolling. So I think we can talk more about this, what forum hold does and so on. Nicole, you can take it over.
00:02:32.100 - 00:02:40.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the first thing I want to start with is how is everything at jump, amidst all the madness?
00:02:42.530 - 00:03:19.180, Speaker B: Well, things are good, Nicole. I think the last few weeks, and maybe the calmest weeks I've personally experienced in crypto over the last three years as a result of everything coming down post collapse and the way things have been shaken out, I think we're very fortunate in a very well capitalized position. Everyone's kind of head down, shipping product, building new strategies, everyone's adjusting to a new reality on internal horizons and a different macro environment. But yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.
00:03:22.670 - 00:03:42.020, Speaker C: I was going to say Enchant has been one of the most committed players I've seen, despite what the nature of the market is, what's going on. They've been super committed to everything, to the space, and then just pure innovating generally. So I think I'm quite happy that things are really well with you guys, but let's just go on.
00:03:47.050 - 00:04:06.918, Speaker B: Thank you. It kind of feels a little bit like it did a couple of years ago, where people are completely unable to trust each other again. Where liquidity is dry, capital environment is dry. That also means opportunity is high, but return horizons are longer. And that's just kind of the nature.
00:04:06.934 - 00:04:13.706, Speaker C: Of the game now, surely by the Khan. I just want to add a quick note that your voice is kind of muffled.
00:04:13.898 - 00:04:14.586, Speaker D: Perhaps.
00:04:14.698 - 00:05:05.226, Speaker C: Maybe there's a bit of noise in the background, but yeah, just wanted to mention that in case if you're in a noisy location or something. But I think we can dive into the interview rather so we can talk more about the wormhole as well. I think for many people would be nice to kind of understand how. I think two questions, right? A how wormhole works. And then also how do you guys compare wormhole to other cross chain solutions out there? What's the trade off? What makes it better? Maybe somewhat technical, non technical overview would be interesting. And just assume that most people here in the space do not know anything besides the magic they see in the front end, which is the trades going through. But what's happening behind the scenes and what we do about the security and stuff like that, I think that would actually really be helpful.
00:05:05.226 - 00:05:06.560, Speaker C: Can we go over that?
00:05:06.930 - 00:05:49.180, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. I think, as you and others in this space know very well, mole is one of the most exciting portfolio companies that jumps involved in. We've famously historically plugged a security breach in February. There's a lot of cool stuff going on and our commitment to the project is pretty huge. I guess I'll just dive into the architecture of boomhole overall. So we've got the genesis of boomhole as a project occurred because there was a desire to take Oracle's cross chain where there was no such solution available. When state was being developed on one chain only.
00:05:49.180 - 00:07:02.638, Speaker B: And so Boomo was developed as a genetic messaging bus that connects, today, 22 heterogeneous networks, allowing the transmission of assets, messages, nfps, or any other kind of state securely between one kid and the other. The means by which it works is there is a network of guardians that are running full nodes of all the networks that are connected to. When someone wants to transfer information from one chain to another, they're able to request the Guardians via an on chain contract invitation to observe the request for state. The guardians then look at that state, attest to it independently. And when supermajority of the guardians are able to attest to the state, that aggregate signature is then able to be transmitted to the receiver chain within the action. There's a whole host of security measures that live on top of Vomo's token bridge called portal. But with respect to hashflow and the integration that we're talking about today, this is leveraging Romo's generic messaging layer at its very core in doing cost chain atomic swaps.
00:07:02.638 - 00:07:08.690, Speaker B: And maybe Varun, I'll leave it to you to best describe how your team has engineered.
00:07:09.130 - 00:08:07.062, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Just to give you a quick tldr of how hashflow and wormhole integration works, more important, how hashtag works in general. Right? The way hashdow works, it's an RFQ system. So what's going on is the market makers are basically on the other side of the trade. They're the ones responsible for providing liquidity, meaning they're always the counterparty to any buy and sell order that a user requests. And that same fundamental applies to block cross chain as well, where a user requests a quote from a market maker, and then the market maker signs the quote off chain once a price agreed upon between the user and the market maker, and then the quote itself, the signed quote, is broadcasted on chain. Right? And because it's a cross chain transaction, there's two nuances here.
00:08:07.062 - 00:09:24.046, Speaker C: You need to have one transaction on the source chain where the user is selling the asset, and then you need to have another transaction on the destination chain where the user is buying it. Right? So an example is if you're trading Ethereum with Awax, then you need to do one transfer on Ethereum where you transfer ether from user's wallet to the smart contract, and then you have another transaction which goes from awax smart contract to the user wallet. And then in between, we're using Wormhole's message passing to let these two chains talk to each other. So what's going on is the first transfer occurs on Ethereum as an example. And then you have your guardians that kind of described, which you can think of these guardians as so few of your validators or miners who are basically looking at transactions and making sure they are real transactions, they're verifying them independently. And once they reach a consensus that this is actually a legit transaction, then they attest that proof, and then anyone can basically relay that transaction on the destination chain. And once the transaction is relayed upon the destination chain would know that transaction is legit, the right people have signed it, and because there's a consensus it will initiate the second transfer.
00:09:24.046 - 00:10:35.590, Speaker C: Now, as you would see, between all these user flows, there was like no user bridge or anything else. And the reason is because your market makers are basically acting as oracles in a way, or who are basically giving you the quote, and because there is no more need for an external oracle to verify the price, because the price is already agreed upon between the two parties who are trading, you basically can bypass the need for using any synthetic or wrapped assets to do the conversion on chain. So by basically moving the whole pricing logic off chain, you've essentially allowed for a more seamless cross chain transfer and not worry about any of the on chain attack vectors like front running or sandwich attacks or anything like that. And you've simply built probably the most seamless way to do cross chain swaps without the issues that users would encounter. Right. And I think that's basically the beginning, the way we started right now, this month we are starting with just the stables, just test things out and then we'll ramp up to add even the native swap so people can just send ether and receive BNB, for example, and not have to worry about using a bridge or using any other third party applications to convert anything. And all this is really done and the gas consumption is going to be the same as a regular swap.
00:10:35.590 - 00:11:07.298, Speaker C: I think one of the reasons why it's so cheap is, again because of wormhole architecture and the simplicity of it, in the sense that all you're doing is one s load where you're storing the signature on the destination chain, but everything else happens off chain. So I like kind of hybrid model that optimizes for the gas, but also allows for a very seamless experience. That's a general overview of what the integration looks like, but I think a follow up question there would be maybe talking about before we jump into a.
00:11:07.304 - 00:12:09.960, Speaker B: Follow up, maybe one more thing to highlight that this architecture enables is the incredible capital efficiency of swaps. Most cross chain swap modules we've kind of seen so far have relied on big thick liquidity pools deployed on chain, where you have to lock up hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in idle capital on chain only low yields to make these swaps possible. We're all very well aware that these models are unsustainable in and of themselves kind of going forward because of the capital environment, macro interest rate people sort. And this enables people and liquidity providers to just in time step in and provide liquidity for cross chain swaps, which will dramatically improve economics, reliability, fees and a bunch of other stuff. And so the architecture that separates the components that strictly need to be on chain with the ones that are off chain drives. Some other efficiencies there as well.
00:12:10.650 - 00:12:38.714, Speaker C: No, absolutely. I think I was going to actually. Sorry. Yeah, I should highlighted this earlier, but I think I 100% agree there. One of the core functionalities, or interesting things that comes out of this is cap efficiency. You don't have to park tons of liquidity or TVL in the pools. I think that's been a general criticism I had of most DeFi protocols, is that they are too capital hungry in the sense that if you want to do anything on chain, you need to require users to lock in lots of, lots of TVL in order to price the assets.
00:12:38.714 - 00:13:30.430, Speaker C: Because if you don't, then the pricing just goes out of whack. Right? So on the other hand, requiring billions in TVL locked in is not the most efficient way of putting the capital to work. And in this case, you're basically having on demand liquidity, where only when there is requirement for quote, you can actually provide that, but otherwise you're free to use that capital and deploy it elsewhere and use that, I think, which makes for a much better market structure than we previously had. I like to tend to say like the 2019 run was about zero to one of DFI. People got excited about interacting with online calculators or vending machines. And now I think what we're building out is a more sophisticated market where things converge to a better capital efficiency, at the same time also preserving the permissionless nature of trading on these platforms.
00:13:33.110 - 00:14:48.680, Speaker E: I also think it's worth just kind of from a high level, kind of talking a little bit about what wormhole actually enables. A lot of people do consider it just a bridge that is meant for a token or asset transfer. And I think the hashful implementation is a really nice use case to kind of highlight how you use this interoperability messaging layer, which really, the way that I like to think about it is like the Internet that connects all of these different blockchains together. And so when we're talking about messaging messages that are passing from one environment to another, you need a type of infrastructure or architecture like wormhole, so that DAP developers can actually access users regardless of what chain those users may live on. I think wormhole does a great job of that. And hashflow has done a fantastic integration to kind of say, hey, you can leverage all of these capabilities that we're bringing to you guys, regardless of where you enter into the crypto space. If it's on Avax or if it's on Solana or if it's on Eth, you can take advantage of the technology that you guys have built.
00:14:49.690 - 00:15:27.860, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good. Yeah. It's worth noting, and maybe even reiterating that this integration explicitly does not use coral, which is the famous token bridge built on the vocal generic message. So astronaut is a completely orthogonal application built on that platform is one of the most exciting ones that have kind of rolled out in the recent past. Guru, if I can turn this on you for a minute, what are your market plans with the cross chain swaps? Embedding them across defi interfaces and working with different teams to get these. To get this.
00:15:28.570 - 00:16:07.502, Speaker C: Absolutely. So I think the way we started off is first deploying to all EVM compatible chains, because that's just the easiest way to start, and it's a low hanging fruit. I think right now we are pretty much with warmhole, we are on five chains like ethereum, polygon, BSE, arbitrum and Avax. And I think optimism is being added. Currently, the plan is to start with EVM chains and then roll out with the stable swaps to see things, make sure that things are going well. And if that's going well, then the next stage is to add the native swaps. And then I think if that goes well, then we'll be adding non EVM chains.
00:16:07.502 - 00:17:03.838, Speaker C: We're still looking into the designs for Sui and Solana and such, so that further increases the functionality. And then obviously the next stage is to basically build. But we already have the APIs that people can just plug in to take cross chain liquidity from us now that the next GTM would be to basically work with most teams who have a retail facing product and are looking for swap features. And I think the big advantage here is we are not just an Ethereum chain or an Avax chain. Ethereum, DAP or Avax. Have you actually a general purpose Dex where you can basically swap across any chain or even do interoperability. And now with wormhole capability, the GTM is basically to talk to any team that is looking for any cross chain taker flows or that want to serve the users and allow the users to swap across chains.
00:17:03.838 - 00:17:38.400, Speaker C: I think we just want to work with any of those guys, anyone in the space right now wanting to have add cross chain functionality into the application, you should reach out to us, send me a DM. I think the APIs are ready and we should be ready to go get the ball rolling. Saeed and I also talked about building a widget that people can just simply integrate into the application and instantly have cross chain functionality available on the application. So perhaps say you can tell me more about that because warmhole has been spearheading that of it. So I think that'd be pretty cool.
00:17:39.570 - 00:19:07.250, Speaker E: Yeah, totally. I think the idea around a widget really makes sense. If you look at the way that portal or some of these other interfaces that interact with wormhole's architecture work, they all need a home to live in, right? And you have dapps across the ecosystem that, especially in new l ones, right, where you really want to attract TVL, you really want to get your first thousand users. And so they want to partner with a bridge or an interoperability messaging protocol like wormhole to embed that technology right in the front end and make it super easy for their first thousand or first 10,000 users to come in and bridge assets into the protocol. Now, it makes a lot of sense to be working with hashflow, for instance, to be able to bridge those assets and then swap them to the types of assets that are necessary for them to start interacting with those dapps. And that's kind of how we're looking at the ecosystem widget for wormhole, which is like, there's a lot of great cross chain infrastructure and technology being built, and how do we do the first model of that with wormhole and let all of these other Dapps integrate that directly into the front end so that they can enhance and make and move a lot of the friction for them to attract users cross chain.
00:19:07.410 - 00:19:59.590, Speaker C: Because I'm thinking like platforms like Magic Aidan and such, who have both Ethereum NFTs and then Solana NFTs, they have multi chain functionality. And I think many people who are buying Solana, sometimes they may not have currency on those chains. So having these cross chain widgets available instantly for people to convert and then buy them natively, where you basically take away or you abstract away this complexity away from the end user, and all they're doing is simply buying with what they have in their wallet. So they don't really care about bridging or going to something to convert and doing any of those things. All they're doing is seeing something they want to buy and they just click buy. And then basically the APIs and everything else takes care of the rest of all the conversions. So I think that's kind of the world when I get to where you basically abstract away all this complexity from the user.
00:19:59.590 - 00:20:18.770, Speaker C: And I think this integration is the first step to moving towards that kind of ux where all the jargon is kind of hidden away from the user and all they care about is just doing a swap and which chain, which network and which bridge to use, and all those things become almost irrelevant from a retail perspective.
00:20:20.150 - 00:20:41.240, Speaker B: 100% we're in side maybe is it worth touching on the ability to hit multiple different runtimes quickly because of this partnership and being first to market on new chains, given womo's velocity of one deployments and its presence in six or seven different runtimes, which is novel in the interoperability space.
00:20:43.390 - 00:20:44.726, Speaker D: Sorry, I kind of missed.
00:20:44.838 - 00:20:45.226, Speaker C: You said.
00:20:45.248 - 00:20:46.554, Speaker D: I think there was a bit of a noise there.
00:20:46.592 - 00:20:47.450, Speaker C: Could you repeat?
00:20:47.870 - 00:21:07.680, Speaker B: Oh, okay, yeah. Very briefly, is it worth talking about the ability to hit new chains on day one as the GPM kind of going forward to be able to get their audience connected? Given Vermont's ability to play across so many different runtimes and the go to market levers, that gets us as an.
00:21:09.010 - 00:21:09.566, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:21:09.668 - 00:21:10.442, Speaker D: I think.
00:21:10.596 - 00:21:20.478, Speaker C: I think if I'm understanding correctly, you're asking, talking about the importance of being on a new chain, let's say like.
00:21:20.504 - 00:21:25.174, Speaker D: After three right now, when things are a little mellow, but then we know.
00:21:25.212 - 00:21:26.534, Speaker C: That things are going to pick up.
00:21:26.572 - 00:21:30.314, Speaker D: Once things get exciting and being there and how we.
00:21:30.512 - 00:21:31.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:31.168 - 00:22:21.850, Speaker E: As well as Varun. As well as just the idea that it's such a non trivial task to be able to support such a large diversity of runtimes, right. Kind of these heterogeneous environments. And so we've seen a lot of work done in the multichain world that's EVM specific. But I think everyone kind of understands that the crypto ecosystem and the crypto world is going to grow and become more and more diverse. And so that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about wormhole, is that they're just a team that has been able to prove that they can build connections to what many devs would call very hard places. To connect to, whether that's algorand or near native or Solana.
00:22:21.850 - 00:22:30.780, Speaker E: And I think that's just part of the wormhole DNA. So just want to hear a little bit more on how you think of expanding outward outside of.
00:22:31.630 - 00:23:16.682, Speaker D: So we've been looking into a bunch of ecosystems, and I think the way I generally see it is two things. One, which chain has a lot of demand? And I also generally like to look at the community feedback to see where they want to trade and so on, and to see where's the most excitement. So, so far, it seemed like Sui and Aptos or the move ecosystem more generally, it has had lots of excitement. The building on move ecosystem is super, super seamless, which something I really like about them. And I think right now the market is still far more nascent. That just is just being there and being the first mover is going to be quite exciting. I think that is one ecosystem I'm personally excited about.
00:23:16.682 - 00:23:46.594, Speaker D: Obviously, Solana has had a bunch of history now, they've been here for nearly a few years, and I think it's been more battle tested than any other chains, or new chains, rather, I think, which means that is something that we have under contention as well, and also been looking into celestia, which has been lately has caught my attention as well, in the sense that how they've designed their architecture, I think it's been something.
00:23:46.632 - 00:23:48.206, Speaker C: We'Ve been heavily exploring.
00:23:48.238 - 00:23:53.670, Speaker D: So I think these are some of the chains we've been looking into, and not to mention the cosmos ecosystem as well.
00:23:53.820 - 00:23:55.960, Speaker C: So the question really comes down to.
00:23:56.570 - 00:24:32.450, Speaker D: Which one is easier to build and also which one has the most demand from a user perspective. And I think going there would make the most practical sense, in my opinion. But I also keen to hear you guys'thoughts, in terms of where you guys are. Like, which ecosystems are you guys most excited about? Because at the moment, I think we can go in any of these directions and I think eventually we'll add them all. So to the point is about sequencing and which chain should come first. I think it'd be interesting to see what chains are you guys most excited about or what ecosystems.
00:24:34.230 - 00:24:35.282, Speaker C: You guys think.
00:24:35.416 - 00:24:37.970, Speaker D: Could be the most interesting ones to launch.
00:24:38.790 - 00:25:49.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the on chain trading volumes in general are so low right now that using them, any of them, as a signal, seems like a difficult proposition to undertake. And so the one that, from our perspective, given the design of flow, it's easy retail experiences and the API that you can integrate is think about which ecosystems are building consumer facing apps that need liquidity and looking at those to kind of get traction. And obviously there's large ecosystems across Solana and Cosmos and maybe even in the Polkadot world that have built some front ends and some attractions that are useful. And those would primarily drive at least my take on where trading API integrations are needed versus not. The other piece is on the cross chain one, I think on the cross chain side. Day one, liquidity is super important for people bridging in farming, trying to get access to the ecosystem overall. And so he mentioned the move ecosystems earlier in the conversation.
00:25:49.670 - 00:26:03.550, Speaker B: Being there, day one poses so many big advantages because it allows you to get embedded within every front end, every ecosystem app, start to network. I guess those would be my priority.
00:26:15.370 - 00:26:17.160, Speaker D: Hello, can you hear me?
00:26:20.330 - 00:26:22.760, Speaker A: A hard stop in a minute or am. I.
00:26:25.050 - 00:26:45.600, Speaker D: Think that's what say mentioned, but that's fine though. I think we covered a lot in the 30 minutes we had. I think we covered the Romhole architecture, the upcoming ecosystems, how this integration works, what it means. I think we can proceed to conclusion, unless you guys want to add more things.
00:26:47.810 - 00:27:05.490, Speaker A: I guess the question that I want to end on is, what else are you excited about besides this integration in general in the space? What are you looking forward? Yeah. In terms of your roadmap?
00:27:06.890 - 00:27:10.200, Speaker B: Yeah. Nicole, is that a question from you?
00:27:11.850 - 00:27:15.000, Speaker A: That question is towards all of you guys.
00:27:19.930 - 00:28:17.100, Speaker B: Maybe I'll take first crack here. I think overall, we've been looking very deeply into the hardware acceleration landscape in the zero knowledge space. Everyone's very excited about gks that's fairly standard and canonical across the ecosystem at this point. There are so many different challenges at different levels of the stack that we need to solve in making algorithmic improvements so that we can actually practically do these things, not in the academic, practical sense, but in the practical, practical sense. And there are application level problems, or infrastructure level problems on standing up proven networks to be able to serve the demand for poops. But even before that, there is a demand to actually produce optimized circuits and hardware to be able to produce these groups in reasonable time and jump 360 machine spending a bunch of time trying to publish results on accelerating perimeters in that space.
00:28:20.950 - 00:28:40.490, Speaker A: Thank you, Sayeed. I think you're muted. Or am I?
00:28:42.460 - 00:28:43.370, Speaker B: 1 minute.
00:28:46.380 - 00:29:02.828, Speaker D: Sorry. I think Saeed is muted still, but yeah, I think we can take Kana's answer as a source of truth here. Go on.
00:29:02.994 - 00:29:04.510, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so too.
00:29:05.840 - 00:29:59.856, Speaker D: But I think generally, if you're asking me what I'm excited about besides this integration, I think generally, I think this is the best time to build, right? I think I like the fact that we are pretty well positioned to basically deliver on the things we promise. And I think this is the time where most speculators and everyone is going to leave and it's going to feel like it's the end of the world. But I think this is where I think I generally keep the philosophy that success comes to those who are patient. I think it applies more so than ever in these conditions. This is where it's like the fortune favors the brave, and I think this is a time to make the difference and then reap the rewards later.
