00:00:01.850 - 00:00:17.850, Speaker A: Gm. Gm. Good morning and welcome to the Defi State, a weekly show brought to you by Hashlow. Guys, can you hear me? Just making sure guys.
00:00:21.660 - 00:00:22.936, Speaker B: Here we can hear.
00:00:23.118 - 00:00:24.280, Speaker A: Oh, perfect.
00:00:24.430 - 00:00:27.320, Speaker B: By the way, Nicole, you might have to add John as a speaker.
00:00:27.820 - 00:00:30.690, Speaker A: I have added John as a speaker. John, are you with us?
00:00:34.010 - 00:00:36.840, Speaker B: I test listener for some reason. Not sure why.
00:00:37.690 - 00:01:19.778, Speaker A: Yeah, just FYI, guys, if you're new to Twitter spaces, it can be glitchy sometimes. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Benham. I'm the host of this show. I'm also head of community for Hashflow. This show, the DeFi state, brings notable speakers, founders, investors, and generally the brightest minds in the industry to discuss what the future of decentralization will look like. My favorite thing about this show is that every guest is so multidimensional and has so much to contribute beyond insights on DeFi and web three. So if you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you're in the right place.
00:01:19.778 - 00:02:02.610, Speaker A: If you also want other people to learn and expand their minds, you can also share this space so people can be aware of it. I know Twitter has changed the design of how you can experience Twitter spaces, so not everyone is seeing that this space is happening. Always helpful to share. Today we have with us my co host Varun, who's the CEO of Hashflow. And also we have with us a very special guest, John Cole. John previously worked at Galaxy Digital and is now a co founder of Hyperlane, which is an interchange messaging platform for developers. He's focused on all things crypto.
00:02:02.610 - 00:02:31.020, Speaker A: He has a great blog that I can share later. He's particularly interested in interoperability, new ways of incentive design and choice architecture, everything at the intersection of crypto assets and financial systems. And he's also interested in anyone attempting to create new or novel business models or modes of monetization, which makes him the perfect guest for this show. John, what's up? How are you?
00:02:31.470 - 00:02:34.218, Speaker C: I'm great. Great to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:02:34.384 - 00:02:36.940, Speaker A: Was that a good intro? Was that fair?
00:02:37.550 - 00:02:39.600, Speaker C: More than fair. I don't deserve it.
00:02:40.530 - 00:02:49.410, Speaker A: You do deserve it. I want to talk to you, I mean, about so much. But let's start with Hyperlane. Can you tell us a little bit more about Hyperlane?
00:02:50.230 - 00:03:37.166, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. Hyperlane, like in a nutshell, is an interchange communication platform. It's a developer tool. Developers can use it to send messages between blockchains. But what does that really mean? Is that now you can create an app that can serve users regardless of the blockchain. You're know, probably most of the people here familiar with Varun's amazing app, cash flow. Cash flow is one of the first ones that really created like a true, what we'd call an interchange app, one that can serve you on a number of chains and just fill your order at the best know.
00:03:37.166 - 00:03:58.200, Speaker C: Varun's got an incredible team. They were able to do a lot of the heavy lifting themselves. What we're building with Hyperlane, it's something that we hope will allow any developer team, even the ones not as talented as the ones at hashflow, to do this much more easily, to do it securely. And that's the.
00:04:02.330 - 00:04:43.638, Speaker B: Think. John, thank you so much for all the kind words. I think it's been a kindness overload early in the morning. I like that, though. I had a bunch of follow up questions on that. So for TLDR, for everyone who just got here, John is building a new interoperability protocol to allow for cross chain communications. And I was curious to, I think it might be actually helpful to sort of discuss the trade offs and how you guys are different from other folks, like layer zero and wormhole and so on, because I already have some insights into how your product works.
00:04:43.638 - 00:04:54.866, Speaker B: But also it'd be nice to kind of click on that, maybe even discuss some of the fundamental cross chain concepts that people may not be knowing.
00:04:55.058 - 00:05:02.940, Speaker C: Of course, yeah. And I'm going to ask you in advance to stop me if it feels like we're getting too into the.
00:05:06.130 - 00:05:13.310, Speaker B: Also, John, sorry to interrupt. There might be a bit of a disturbance on your end. I was wondering if anything you could do.
00:05:13.380 - 00:05:15.200, Speaker C: Let me try and move the slightly different.
00:05:17.730 - 00:05:26.610, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I heard that too. I wasn't sure if it was just on my end, but I guess it isn't. Varun, how are you today? In the meantime?
00:05:26.950 - 00:05:34.120, Speaker B: I am doing good. I'm doing good. I think for all you guys looking for Alpha, there might be a big reveal next.
00:05:36.250 - 00:05:39.266, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I love an alpha drop.
00:05:39.458 - 00:05:43.158, Speaker C: Dropping a teaser like that. Hopefully this is a little bit better.
00:05:43.324 - 00:05:44.040, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:45.290 - 00:05:49.420, Speaker A: I'm not going to lie, John, it's slightly better, but we'll take it. All right.
00:05:49.870 - 00:05:59.918, Speaker C: Yeah. I'll have to apologize. These days with big conference in New York, you got to be in and out of a million places. I get it today.
00:06:00.084 - 00:06:01.200, Speaker A: I get it.
00:06:01.570 - 00:06:43.386, Speaker C: So high level, pretty much every. There's two general approaches, how you can do cross chain communication, because really what you're trying to do is you're trying to tell one blockchain about something that happened on another blockchain. So spent enough time with crypto now probably sounds a little bit like the oracle problem. We're trying to learn something about something outside of a blockchain. In this case, it just happens to come from another. So if we could bake that into the consensus process and have some type of verification in that way, that would be ideal. But that's very difficult.
00:06:43.386 - 00:07:27.414, Speaker C: To do that, the blockchains need to be very similarly constructed. Now, the best example of that is the cosmos ecosystem, and they have the IBC. IBC is probably easily one of the best interoperability protocols. And as long as you build within the confines of something that fits into that IBC mode, it's amazing. There's so many things we can do with it. That's why you're seeing a growing ecosystem around the cosmos. SBK and we are very much inspired by IBC.
00:07:27.414 - 00:08:21.210, Speaker C: But what we saw is, huh, the world's getting bigger than just this construction. Maybe we can't convince everybody to build blockchains that look like this. And so how do we take those same principles from IBC and expand them to a much broader set of architectures? So if you're not going to bake it into consensus, like the best approach, what are you going to do? You're going to have to create some type of Oracle system. And now there's different ways to do that. Our way is one of the ways. So if you think of wormhole, the way wormhole does it, it puts together a group of people who are very know, they have their guardians. They are some of the best firms in the know, folks like Figment and stakes and FTX and others.
00:08:21.210 - 00:08:54.562, Speaker C: Really trustworthy people. And they are the ones who are telling you, hey, this stuff happened on chain a, so you can trust it on chain b. Another approach would be to employ some type of economic security. So something like proof of stake. So you get these validators, they all put up some money that they stand to lose if they lie. And that kind of looks like excellence. Or you can do what layer zero does.
00:08:54.562 - 00:09:41.720, Speaker C: Layer zero has two parties. One's known as the relayer, and one is known as the oracle. The oracle tells you what happened on the chain, and the relayer sends it to the next chain. So, of the existing approaches that generally kind of summarizes all of it, we learned from everything that's come before us. And we try to create something that we think will be at the same time the easiest for developers to use, while maintaining a very high bar for how secure it is. And allowing them to very easily leverage that security. So we borrow a little bit from the reputation and the economic security in that we'll have validators on every blockchain that we support.
00:09:41.720 - 00:10:41.830, Speaker C: Those validators are going to look to the authenticity of the messages, sign them, kind of putting their name on that message, and then that gets relayed over to the relevant blockchain. And now comes in the things that we do that we think really changes the game for interoperability. We created this thing, well, I shouldn't say mostly my co founders. I was in the room while this was happening. It's a gig of brain type of work stuff that I'm not suited for. And what it does, basically, is it lets the developer of any application configure their own security model. So if they want to add an optimistic security model, which is like another approach, to force some latency and say, hey, there's going to be a time window where this message doesn't get processed, we're going to look at it, make sure that it's okay.
00:10:41.830 - 00:11:06.160, Speaker C: If it's not okay, we're going to submit a fraud proof. But once the window checks out, we can process it. They can do that. If they want to have just economic security, they can do that. If they want to mix and match those, they can do that. We have a menu of what we call interchange security modules, and you can pick up any item from that menu. You can mix and match it.
00:11:06.160 - 00:11:50.910, Speaker C: You can even customize the security based on the content of an action that someone's doing. If you go to your bank and you try to take out $10, they'll barely ask for your pin number. But if you're going to try and withdraw your whole account, they're going to hold you up for like a rectal exam. So in the same way, that's generally like a sensical process, different rules for different sides of transactions. With hyperlane, any developer that uses this could define different rules for different transactions. So if someone is trying to withdraw the entirety of a pool, well, you might want to force a long delay on that. You might want to have a lot of eyeballs on if someone's transacting for $100.
00:11:50.910 - 00:12:09.890, Speaker C: Maybe we just opt for the fastest way. Because even if it was malicious, the harm there is not very big. And so that hope gives you a good enough, but not too boring overview of our approach relative to everybody else's.
00:12:16.540 - 00:12:30.000, Speaker B: Nicole, if you have a question, you can go ahead, but I was going to ask you one more thing. There is hyperlane. So are you guys also building a bridge or is it mainly going to be a message passing and then you expect other people to sort of design the bridge?
00:12:32.020 - 00:13:44.644, Speaker C: So right now, actually, we have a couple of teams that are trying to create their own more innovative bridge design. And so for the moment, we're going to see that through, see how it works, and kind of listen to what the market tells us. The other alternative we're considering is instead of a bridge, a more like native value transfer mechanism, and people on top of that can build bridges that are more user facing. We are very focused on being a developer product and we're very cautious of signaling to some of our developers that we're going to try and compete with them for their users. Like, our focus is we want to make it easy for developers to create an amazing experience for their users. And once you start competing for user attention, I think we get into a dangerous place. I know it's a bit unorthodox because certainly a lot of the other protocols have built their own bridges, but we'll see.
00:13:44.644 - 00:13:48.250, Speaker C: We think a different approach might be beneficial here.
00:13:51.180 - 00:14:32.170, Speaker A: I want to take this in a different direction, if that's okay. John, I read your blog post titled the Accountless Internet. Can you, in your own words, walk us through that? Because the role of identity on the Internet and the amount of accounts that we have truly is a lot. And the way that you broke it down in this blog post really made me think, so I'd love to walk for you to walk us through that.
00:14:32.700 - 00:14:55.256, Speaker C: Yeah, that's great. I'm glad that got some audience. I still think about a lot. So for the audience, I don't assume you have the time to read my rambling. So now you get to listen to them. So if you're like me, you probably have lots of accounts, low end. You probably have more than 300, 400 accounts.
00:14:55.256 - 00:15:38.216, Speaker C: If you've been on the Internet for more than a few years, it kind of feels like we're walking around with these massive keychains in our business pockets. Except you have to remember a lot about these keys. There's so many accounts that now there's like this multibillion dollar industry of password managers. You know, one account to manage all your accounts and you lose that account, and now you fuck. Excuse my language, I don't know with the rules here, but I tend to talk like that and that just seems untenable. And with crypto, we always moan about how bad the experience is. And it's true on many respects the experience is terrible.
00:15:38.216 - 00:16:28.350, Speaker C: But in one aspect the experience is absolutely amazing, at least for me and several others. I know the fact that your keys are basically your account, and they are your access mechanism to everything. You don't have to remember much, except for your seed phrase that you want to store securely, but it's your uniloggin to everything. It's your sign on with Google, except that it's not held by some amorphous corporation. So that's kind of where the thinking started around this idea of the accountless Internet. And then I started realizing that actually this thing becomes a lot more than just an account. It becomes like a really powerful representation of your online know the account.
00:16:28.350 - 00:17:30.050, Speaker C: Like, know user credentials for most traditional Internet. Like, it's meant to signify your identity. It's like, okay, this is how I know that Nicole is this user, that varun is this user, that John is this user. But so even though we have basically, like, we have a much fewer number of actual identities than we do, account crypto kind of lets us flip it, because we can basically create an identity around each one of our accounts. The account kind of becomes a great source of digital identity because it contains a lot of the value that you create and that you care about, whether it's the assets you hold, the transactions you engage in, the collectibles that you collect. I envision a world eventually, where most of the information that we put out into the world, a lot of it's digital. A lot of that could be tied to your account as well.
00:17:30.050 - 00:18:32.468, Speaker C: A tweet, an article, those could basically be items that are held in an account, and then apps like Twitter could just read them from your account instead of storing them internally. So if you combine value and information, I think that all stacks up to create pretty strong digital identity. And the identities we have through our accounts, they don't just have to be like, it's not just John. One of them could be zero X John, one of it could be like, my anon account. One of it could be right, like, so you get this really unique opportunity, kind of create any identity you want and build around that, and at the same time, not have to manage an increasingly large and unwieldy set of accounts. Again, I could ramble on this for an hour, so I'm trying to stop myself.
00:18:32.634 - 00:18:51.096, Speaker A: That's what we want, for you to ramble about this so we can learn. Well, can you elaborate a little bit on how Ethereum and Ethereum based apps sort of solve this for sure?
00:18:51.198 - 00:19:29.796, Speaker C: Yes. I think to me, this is one of the most magical things about crypto. So to explain what something. Account like what an accountless Internet and accountless app is, let me make up a term account full. And let's think of pretty much almost every app that you use outside of crypto is an account full app. And this term that we just invented, accounts full, we're going to use it to describe anything where the account is part of the app that you're using. So if you think about Twitter, you sign it.
00:19:29.796 - 00:20:04.384, Speaker C: Like, Twitter has your account information. It lives inside of their servers. Whenever you want to sign in, you give them those credentials and they're like, cool, you can come in now. So an accountful service, it owns your account. Crypto don't work like that at all. The account lives outside of the application, a lot lives outside of the application. And the application just kind of performs a know to continue on kind of the Twitter example.
00:20:04.384 - 00:20:55.040, Speaker C: In Twitter, we post tweets. They're all stored inside of Twitter. We visit Twitter, we give it our credentials, and then it displays us a feed. An accountless version of Twitter would look something like, when you post a tweet, it gets written into your account. You can imagine, like, some text based asset being added to your account. And the app, instead of wanting to own this thing, it just says, hey, can I read the stuff that's inside your account? It does that, and now you're off to the races. Or another tangible example you could think of, like an accountful financial service being something like Robinhood.
00:20:55.040 - 00:21:21.688, Speaker C: They have your account, they own the account, they own also all of the assets. When you buy something with Robinhood, they hold it for you and you just give them orders. You say, buy this for me, sell that for me. But everything happens inside of Robinhood. Whereas something like Uniswap or hashflow, those are accountless financial services. They don't hold the assets. You come to them.
00:21:21.688 - 00:22:09.432, Speaker C: All the assets are held in your account, your account is held externally, and you're like, hey, I'm going to buy this thing and I'm going to sell that thing, and the app just performs the service for you. And that's it, right? It's more of like putting a dvd into a dvd player. Sorry, probably aging myself by talking about dvds. Not everyone's using them, but to me, there's something really magical about this. And we're just kind of scratching the surface now of what this world looks like, what this type of Internet looks like. And I think it's going to bring us to a world where, like, not too far from now, 1020 years from now I have a daughter. She's pretty young, like three and a half.
00:22:09.432 - 00:22:45.092, Speaker C: She's going to look at me and be like, dad, I can't believe you guys roamed the Internet and all those companies owned everything, and you guys were just like these little serfs walking around everything. You didn't hold anything, none of it was your own. They could take it, they could use it, they could do whatever the hell they want with it. No one had to ask you for anything. And you basically had no digital rights, so to speak. No digital property rights. That's kind of the gist of it, yeah.
00:22:45.146 - 00:23:15.420, Speaker A: And isn't it funny? It's funny. I didn't actually know this, and most other people didn't really realize this until we were told. I remember distinctly two years ago, people started to tell me, you don't even own your own data. And I'm like, what? What do you mean? They're like, yeah, the picture you uploaded isn't yours or things like that. But it's good to talk about this stuff because there are still people who don't know. Varun, I saw you unmute.
00:23:18.400 - 00:23:19.150, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:22.720 - 00:24:36.330, Speaker B: John, especially in here in this know, we talked about identity, obviously, accounting and how DeFi is permissionless, and it's actually likely going to be the future where it's going to be more privacy driven. But I think one of the things that's interesting, I think this is from, I'm speaking from a financial markets perspective, is I think one of the big applications in CFI tends to be, or just not even CFI in general. The world mostly works on the concept of credit and lending. So if you think about the fundamentals of money itself, it's essentially a debt instrument. If you're thinking about sort of the mass adoption of crypto, and if lending becomes a core concept in that world, how do you see the role of identity and accounting play into making this a more, more and, and more seamless transition? How do you enable lending if you don't have insights into who the counterparty is? And at which point I feel like knowing some kind of on chain credentials is kind of essential. Or maybe you're missing something.
00:24:37.100 - 00:25:46.264, Speaker C: Not at all. Not missing anything. Actually, this is another thing I've been super interested in and wrote about is I think identity is imperative to extending credit to someone. In fact, you're just never going to extend credit to another being or entity or really whatever, without some concept of their identity. And I think credit worthiness kind of a requirement to properly underwrite and extend credit to someone is usually assessed on the combination of two things, sometimes just one of the two. And I like to think of those as it's basically a combination of your reputation, who you are, what we think of you, and the actions you've taken. And so how can we get that in the pseudonymous context blockchain? Well, I think it's going to be very difficult to do in totally privacy preserving context.
00:25:46.264 - 00:26:36.332, Speaker C: The ones where there is absolutely no record that a potential credit extender could inspect. That's a bit undoable. So sorry, I don't know if there's going to be credit extended on Monero anytime soon, but you're talking about pseudonymous kind of like transparent contexts, like eth. I think. Absolutely it will be. So what do you do with your address? If nothing else, your address collects and demonstrates very detailed and immutable as long as the blockchain is secure, accurate history of your actions. And now we just said that's a key component of credit.
00:26:36.332 - 00:27:35.840, Speaker C: Like do you pay things on time? Like did you borrow before? How much did you borrow? Did you pay it on time? Did you pay it off early? Were you delinquent? All of those are things that we can start to establish from your address. Well, what's really interesting is that in the last two years, more and more people kind of like, without being asked to, without being forced to, started treating their addresses as more part, as a bigger part of their identity. And people will change their Twitter handle to their Ens name. People will build a whole anon Persona around an address. Think of, let's say, famous one for a while. Perhaps infamous now is zero XB one. Pretty much anyone who was paying attention to d five was aware of zero XB One.
00:27:35.840 - 00:28:33.300, Speaker C: So now it's not just that the address starts that has the history of your actions prerequisites, extending credits. You also start to build a reputation, and reputation is just as material in lending as your actions. But we're really seeing both of these things kind of materialize in a cryptoconic. So actually, I think on chain credit is really not that far away what we haven't seen really happening yet. DGen score was probably like the closest thing to it, where it was creating some type of information about you or some type of badge based on the previous action you've taken. If you squint, you look at that and it's not that hard to see how you go from that to credit score. It just hasn't happened yet.
00:28:33.300 - 00:29:22.020, Speaker C: Why, I can't tell you. I'm aware of several startups working on this, so I have to assume it's not that far away. But I definitely think identity is imperative. We're going to need it to extend credit, and I'm pretty optimistic about that happening. Even without strict KYC, I think people tend to really overestimate how much, at least of consumer lending actually gets enforced at the individual level. The main penalty for defaulting on a loan is losing access to future credit because your credit score goes to shit. We don't really have debtors prisons anymore.
00:29:24.040 - 00:29:29.520, Speaker A: Sorry, wait, we don't really have what? I didn't hear the last sentence.
00:29:29.600 - 00:29:34.228, Speaker C: Oh, sorry. We don't have debtors prisons anymore. They don't come throw you in jail when you default.
00:29:34.404 - 00:29:35.450, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:29:35.820 - 00:29:40.170, Speaker C: They're just like, hey, your credit is going to shit. You can never borrow ever again. Fuck you.
00:29:41.020 - 00:29:44.628, Speaker A: Yeah. That is the repercussion if you think.
00:29:44.654 - 00:30:02.332, Speaker C: About that in a crypto setting. Right. So imagine I spent three years building up the history on this address. I borrowed from makers from Ave compound. I paid on time stuff. Great. At that point, I have something to lose.
00:30:02.332 - 00:30:32.650, Speaker C: The thing I have to lose is not a parent. Because at least the most crypto people I talk to, they seem to think like, oh, yeah, you might still default on a loan. Well, if you do, you got to start over. That's going to be just as hard as starting over in the real world or the physical world, let's say. I'm very optimistic on, on chain credits using the identities that we build through our addresses, through our actions, through our.
00:30:41.680 - 00:31:33.740, Speaker B: I suppose I had, like, other follow up question on that front. I think this may be taking the topic slightly towards a different direction again. So I feel like, again, in terms of institutional, I think there's been a bit of a talk. I think we had a space a couple of weeks ago where we talked a lot about institutional adoption of crypto and so on. And I feel like one of the big reasons why that adoption hasn't taken place is being able to know who the counterparty is. And I think even when I speak to many people, they say KyC is one of the big reasons, or AML laws are one of the big reasons why they haven't been able to participate, because not knowing who they are dealing with is a big red flag. And on the other hand, I also keep hearing that for crypto or defi to become really mainstream, you need that sort of institutional adoption.
00:31:33.740 - 00:31:58.260, Speaker B: Where do you sit in this one? Because I think you also worked with Galaxy in the past. I would imagine we'll have a better insight into how do you guys at that time, viewed participating in crypto and defi in general? And what is it that's stopping you guys from partaking more freely, or what needs to change for them to feel comfortable? And what's that? Sweet spot.
00:31:59.640 - 00:32:55.492, Speaker C: Totally. Now, not only did I work together, I guess kind of spearheading our attempts and eventual success to get involved in Defi and other on chain capacities. And I guess Galaxy still is a publicly listed firm, a firm that is very interested in maintaining compliance. It does everything it can. Keeping up with compliance is probably rule number one at a firm like that that values its institutional relationships above all else. And so that was kind of like, this is the sandbox. You want to do this? Here are the rules.
00:32:55.492 - 00:33:39.220, Speaker C: We need to figure out how to do this while maintaining compliance. So we had to talk to pretty much every regulator, every law firm, every general counsel at every d five project, at every venture firm, starting in 2019. And really, that effort never ceased. I'm sure it's still ongoing. I've left a little bit ago. The first barrier for us is, you're absolutely right. It is tied to knowing your counterparty KYC, and specifically, like, things you're really afraid of are AML issues.
00:33:39.220 - 00:34:31.380, Speaker C: And most particularly, you're very afraid of running afoul of know. Three years ago, when I talked about OFAC, no one in crypto knew, except for the lawyer. There's no scary or four letter combination for an american lawyer at a finance firm than OFAC. But now everybody in crypto knows it because of some recent events. And so knowing who the other side is, to make sure that you're not violating the bank Secrecy act, that you're not running afoul of OPAC, is imperative. That's very difficult to do in a tsunamis context. So undoubtedly, we're going to need better tools.
00:34:31.380 - 00:35:40.060, Speaker C: But on chain surveillance has gotten really sophisticated. The folks at chain analysis, at CRM, and their many competitors have become very good at what they do. And with that, we now have a good sense of what are the addresses of the bad actors, what are the patterns that the bad actors exhibit. And so one solution, instead of requiring everybody to do very strict KYC by kind of like, putting a steel wall around all DeFi applications and saying, the only way to get past the wall is by providing your Social Security, your identification, and all of it, another way is to just scan all of the pools and look at those and say, reference those scans against the information that's held by PRM, by chain analysis, with respect to who are the bad actors?
00:35:40.480 - 00:35:42.910, Speaker B: John, there's a lot of noise on your end.
00:35:43.840 - 00:35:51.280, Speaker C: I'm sorry. It's storming real bad. Let me try if I can get indoors.
00:35:55.250 - 00:36:04.020, Speaker B: Sorry guys, for the context. I think John is in New York and there's a massive storm at the moment. Over. So you can literally hear everything?
00:36:05.030 - 00:36:06.900, Speaker A: Yeah, you can literally hear.
00:36:09.590 - 00:36:15.320, Speaker B: The storm has joined the space as well. I reckon it wanted to learn about the DeFi state.
00:36:15.930 - 00:36:20.200, Speaker A: Oh my. Rude of me to not introduce the storm at the beginning of the space.
00:36:21.290 - 00:36:29.754, Speaker B: I'm sorry, I should have sent you the guest list beforehand. Next time keep that in mind.
00:36:29.952 - 00:36:34.060, Speaker A: Yeah, next time we will. This is very good. We're learning as we're going.
00:36:37.150 - 00:36:46.362, Speaker C: Hey guys, I'm sorry, it's going to take me a few minutes. If you wanted to chat about something, maybe has flow related while I find filters.
00:36:46.506 - 00:36:47.210, Speaker B: No worries.
00:36:47.290 - 00:36:54.900, Speaker A: That's okay. Yeah, Varun, let's talk about hasflow for a little bit. When token. Just kidding. Let's talk about something else.
00:36:55.430 - 00:37:03.266, Speaker B: Wait, did you ask me when. Token, I told you not to ask that question.
00:37:03.448 - 00:37:05.060, Speaker A: I know, I'm just.
00:37:05.830 - 00:37:22.700, Speaker B: No, no, it's fine. I think. Didn't I say like there's a big news coming out next week earlier? That's something, right? Yeah, that's all I'm going to say.
00:37:23.390 - 00:37:25.820, Speaker A: Okay, so it's something. That's all we get.
00:37:26.530 - 00:37:27.280, Speaker C: Well.
00:37:31.250 - 00:37:52.820, Speaker B: I wouldn't be that cryptic about it, but definitely I think if people have seen the roadmap, I think it's in the right direction. Right. I think this is something to do with the hash verse. Since there's only 20 people here, I think this is enough alpha. I think this they can take to go about this.
00:37:53.670 - 00:37:58.200, Speaker A: Oh wow. So you're dropping alpha because of the small size of the room?
00:37:59.050 - 00:38:09.930, Speaker B: I think the small and the more and more committed size of the room. I've seen the people and I've seen these guys on every single space. So these are the true og hash gang. So they get to get the alpha.
00:38:10.670 - 00:38:13.660, Speaker A: Oh wow. What's up, hash gang? What an.
00:38:20.130 - 00:38:23.070, Speaker B: Are any of you guys in New York this week for Mainnet?
00:38:24.770 - 00:38:39.490, Speaker A: They can't respond, but if you are in New York for Mainnet, go ahead and give us a heart emoji and we'll scroll down. If you're in New York for me, give us a heart emoji.
00:38:42.710 - 00:38:43.762, Speaker B: I guess not.
00:38:43.896 - 00:38:44.580, Speaker A: Wow.
00:38:45.430 - 00:38:49.560, Speaker B: I had like a hashtag for you guys if you guys want to come collect it in person.
00:38:52.650 - 00:38:54.870, Speaker A: For some reason I have a hard time believing.
00:38:57.310 - 00:38:59.020, Speaker B: That no one is in New York.
00:38:59.630 - 00:39:00.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:03.150 - 00:39:07.358, Speaker B: Maybe it's like an overload of conferences because there's been too many conferences happening in the past.
00:39:07.444 - 00:39:09.280, Speaker A: True, there have been way too many.
00:39:09.970 - 00:39:16.750, Speaker B: It's like the bear market hasn't affected the conference. In fact, people are still bullish on conferences.
00:39:18.450 - 00:39:20.670, Speaker A: Yeah, there are way too many conferences.
00:39:23.750 - 00:39:35.480, Speaker B: By the way, let's check in with John. Let me quickly check to see if he's still available, or if not, we can likely end the space sooner today if in case there is still issues on his end.
00:39:36.490 - 00:39:37.960, Speaker A: John, how are we doing?
00:39:39.370 - 00:39:42.358, Speaker C: Let me know. Is it any better where I'm at now?
00:39:42.524 - 00:40:00.720, Speaker A: I love how the second you turn on your mic, I hear the storm. It's fine. I mean, I'm enjoying this conversation. And we don't have that much longer to go, so we can maybe address a few more questions and then call it a day. How does that sound?
00:40:01.570 - 00:40:02.560, Speaker D: Good deal.
00:40:04.370 - 00:40:19.314, Speaker A: All right, let's do it. Let's talk about the know. John, you were previously at Galaxy Digital, so I'd imagine you have insight into market conditions. Have we reached the bottom? What's going on?
00:40:19.512 - 00:40:57.850, Speaker D: That's a tough one. No, I don't think so. I think it's hard to know. I used to work with Morgan Stanley, also before crypto, and the guy that ran the trading floor, my old boss used to have the saying, like, the only thing you get from picking bottoms is a snake finger, which is an inappropriate but still funny thing. So it's hard to say. I don't think we'll have bottomed out until several months after it's pretty clear. Like the macro environment has cooled down and there's two main drivers.
00:40:57.850 - 00:40:59.358, Speaker D: On one hand, you have central banks.
00:40:59.374 - 00:41:01.954, Speaker C: Kind of around the world, which are.
00:41:01.992 - 00:41:08.050, Speaker D: Very much coordinated in their effort to stop price inflation.
00:41:08.550 - 00:41:15.814, Speaker C: I do think they think they're using the right tool. I don't think they're using the right.
00:41:15.852 - 00:42:04.050, Speaker D: Tool because they are kind of failing to pay attention to the actual drivers of it. Right. I don't think interest rates are driving the price of gasoline or the price of food, but that's a whole different topic. They are certainly crushing asset markets, which does seem to be a part of their goal. So that's one thing that's going to have to change. The second is actually not the macro environment, it's the micro environment with respect to crypto. So before we can start thinking about has our market bottom of, you probably looking for signs that crypto is participating in broader risk rallies.
00:42:04.050 - 00:42:56.870, Speaker D: So in the last few weeks and months, really, you would have broad relief. Know, these are common in a bear market, but crypto didn't always participate in them. So the Nasdaq sP EM markets would be up and those you could think of as very clearly like risk assets. But crypto wasn't rallying to the same extent and in some cases wasn't rallying at all with those risk assets. Now, that's really important. How do you get out of a down market? Well, a down market just tells you that on a consistent basis there are more sellers than there are buyers. And it's not referring specifically to amount of people, it's referring to amount of buying power, amount of assets being bought or sold.
00:42:56.870 - 00:43:18.702, Speaker D: So we need large pockets of money to turn their attention to our asset class and buy it alongside other things they're buying. And until that happens, things are not going to change because unfortunately, fortunately and unfortunately, the market now is quite large.
00:43:18.756 - 00:43:18.926, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:18.948 - 00:44:27.150, Speaker D: Like the market caps that we're talking about are much larger than they were three years ago. So a much larger inflow is required to offset these large outflows. And I think as long as we're seeing that crypto is not participating in these other risk rallies, it's hard to say that we found the bottom. So that's like, I think trying to time the market to a moment is not good, but otherwise, timing in markets is very critical. And so you do want to pay attention. Like, are things starting to turn right? Are we already at the target rate that the Fed is set yesterday? They're looking at about four and a half on the federal funds rate within the next twelve to 18 months. Well, are we there? Okay, once we're there, you could start feeling a lot better then is crypto rallying with other risk assets?
00:44:27.230 - 00:44:28.018, Speaker C: Is it great.
00:44:28.104 - 00:44:35.682, Speaker D: Okay, now we can get back to normal, we can get back to us, but until those things happen, I'd remain pretty cautious.
00:44:35.746 - 00:44:37.190, Speaker C: And I said I'm.
00:44:38.890 - 00:44:40.950, Speaker D: Extremely overexposed.
00:44:45.850 - 00:44:46.710, Speaker C: That's.
00:44:47.450 - 00:44:49.494, Speaker D: Yeah, so that's kind of my view.
00:44:49.532 - 00:44:54.054, Speaker C: Hopefully it's helpful. I know there's not. I wish I could give you a more accurate prediction.
00:44:54.102 - 00:44:58.090, Speaker D: If I had one, I would, but I don't.
00:45:00.530 - 00:45:26.054, Speaker B: It's hard to predict macro what's going to happen. It was more like along the lines of what our other OG players thinking about these things. I think just usually helpful insight to see different perspectives. But again, by no means, it's not a prediction on Oracle, although it would be nice to be an oracle. I think in that scenario they can tell me, like, this is exactly what.
00:45:26.092 - 00:45:27.080, Speaker C: I should do things.
00:45:33.770 - 00:45:43.302, Speaker B: Nicole I think those are all the questions I had and I think John you also had to go to the conference to speak in ten minutes. I reckon you're going on the stage indeed.
00:45:43.366 - 00:45:43.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:44.080 - 00:45:45.306, Speaker D: Thank you so much.
00:45:45.488 - 00:46:18.194, Speaker A: I was debating whether I continue not even the questions that I had but just questions that came to mind based on what you said but we will continue this conversation later. I know you have to go. Thank you so much for being here John it was thank you both. Sorry about the it. Don't worry about it. Thank you so much for your time. I hope this was helpful for everyone here and we will definitely continue this conversation and any subjects that were brought up.
00:46:18.194 - 00:46:32.090, Speaker A: We do this weekly show so be sure to follow hashlow, myself and Varun so you will get notifications every time we do this so thank you so much guys. Thanks for being here.
00:46:32.160 - 00:46:32.520, Speaker C: Thank you.
