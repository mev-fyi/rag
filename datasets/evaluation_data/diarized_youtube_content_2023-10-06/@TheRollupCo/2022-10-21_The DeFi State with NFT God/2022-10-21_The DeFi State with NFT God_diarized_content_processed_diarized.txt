00:00:02.010 - 00:00:44.474, Speaker A: GM. GM. And by GM, I mean good afternoon if you're on the east coast, and good night if you're in Europe. Welcome to the Defi State, a weekly show brought to you by hashflow. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Benham, the host of this show and head of community for Hashflow. On this show, we bring in notable speakers, founders, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and generally the brightest minds in the industry to discuss what the future of decentralization will look like. What I love about this show is that every guest is so different and has such different insights on DFI, web three, and the world.
00:00:44.474 - 00:01:10.738, Speaker A: If you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you are in the right place. Also, if you'd like to share this space with your friends, you can click on the arrow at the top right of the space and copy the link. Tweet it out to your feed, text it to your friends. Whatever works. It appears that our CEO Varun has been rugged. He'll be back in a second. This happens a lot today, though.
00:01:10.738 - 00:01:26.200, Speaker A: Our special guest is NFT God, aka Alex. He runs a Twitter and a popular newsletter on web three, self improvement and audience building. One of my favorite follows. I learned so much. Alex, what's good? How are you?
00:01:27.770 - 00:01:34.314, Speaker B: I'm doing great, Nicole. Thanks for having me on. It's a beautiful day over here in New York and I'm really excited to be talking to you.
00:01:34.352 - 00:02:05.140, Speaker A: Oh my God, I'm so excited to be talking to you. I feel like I have subscribed to your tweets and I feel like everyone just makes me think and inspires me and I learned so much. I feel like my Twitter feed is better because I learned from you. The first question I have for you because you are tweeting a lot about web three and nfTs. What was so special about web three that you said to yourself, hey, I'm going to enter this space.
00:02:07.450 - 00:02:44.074, Speaker B: Yeah. So I discovered web three and NFTs about a year and a half ago. I stumbled across an article on the sandbox, which is a metaverse project. I don't know how I came across it, but I was reading it and I was totally blown away. The articles about how in this metaverse, you'd be able to create things sort of like in Minecraft, and own it and sell it, and you really own the assets. And I was totally blown away by that concept. I never read about NFTs or I knew about the blockchain, but just kind of digital ownership before, and I was so inspired.
00:02:44.074 - 00:03:15.980, Speaker B: At that moment in time, I feel inspired to create content about this. I want to talk about it. I want to get involved in the community. And so I created a Twitter and I created a WordPress blog because I was so inspired. I was like, okay, what name can I come up with that'll really get heads to turn? And NFT God was the first thing that came up to my mind. So I took that, I created the Twitter, I bought the domain, and I started writing content from that point because I was so inspired by what I found.
00:03:16.670 - 00:03:25.440, Speaker A: I love it, and I certainly saw NFT God and I'm like, who's that? And followed you. So it worked. What were you doing before all this?
00:03:26.690 - 00:03:52.134, Speaker B: Yeah, so I am still doing what I was doing before. So I have a full time career that I am involved in outside of web three. I manage a team of technical consultants. I still do that to this day because I love it and it pays the bills. But before this, I did have side hustles up to this point, too. I loved creating content. So actually, before this, I was creating content in the traditional finance space.
00:03:52.134 - 00:04:44.134, Speaker B: I was running a Twitter and a blog with a friend. I was super into stocks and investing, and I never really quite caught on. And before that, I actually ran a blog around sports. So I was creating content and tweeting about sports because I'm super into that and none of that ever caught on. But then when I was looking at the NFT space, after I created my account and was looking at who the voices were and the thought leaders, I made the discovery that it seemed like 95% of the, quote unquote, influencers in the space were meme creators and shit posters, things like that, which I have no problem with that whatsoever. I actually think it's critical to web three culture that that exists. But I saw a gap in the market around kind of sharing value and helping others thought leadership around that.
00:04:44.134 - 00:05:00.560, Speaker B: And so I said, okay, I'm going to try to fill this market gap and share helpful content and try to share value and build a platform and share what I learned along the way. So I transitioned from the traditional finance space and started trying to fill that market gap in web three, and it helped me build this platform.
00:05:01.330 - 00:05:23.380, Speaker A: I love it. Value is an interesting word because everyone claims that they're creating it. They claim that they're sharing it. Not everyone is. But how do you sort of define that? How do you know when you're actually creating value, sharing value, and how do you sort of measure that?
00:05:23.910 - 00:05:48.454, Speaker B: Value is obviously different to everyone, but for me, my strategy has always been learn out loud. And what I mean by that is I'm a big reader. I read a ton of books. I take a lot of online courses. I'm always trying to grow. I believe I have a kind of like a growth mindset. And so my content strategy up to this point, it's been the same way since I had zero followers.
00:05:48.454 - 00:06:17.762, Speaker B: It's the same way today when I have 55,000 followers, is just share what I learn. And so as I read books, you see, I share a lot of content on just, like, general wellness, whether it's meditation or journaling. You see, I share content around growing an audience, because that's something I'm doing right now. Just everything I learn as I go, I share it out to my audience. I hold nothing back. I believe in the democratization of knowledge. And so when you ask me, what do I believe is value? It's different to every person.
00:06:17.762 - 00:06:22.680, Speaker B: But to me, I learn something, and then I share it with those around me. And to me, that's sharing value.
00:06:23.130 - 00:07:02.980, Speaker A: I love that. It kind of reminds me of how I entered the space. I didn't know much about nfts or web three. I was never really very technical, and I was sort of intimidated by the space. But I had to ask myself, how can I actually enter this space authentically? And my background was journalism, so I was like, why don't I just be the person that asks questions? And I learn as I go along publicly? That's literally all I do. And I've done it for the past year. And so that was my strategy, too, and it worked.
00:07:04.150 - 00:07:43.866, Speaker B: The thing is, people have that same kind of conversation in their own head, okay, what can I share? What unique perspective do I have? And a lot of the times, a vast majority of the times, they get impostor syndrome. They think, oh, I'm not good enough at this to share value with people, or, I'm not good enough at this to share my unique perspective. I don't really know too much about any specific thing, so I can't really talk about it. But the thing is, even if you know 20% about something, you're ahead of a vast majority of people. You're ahead of all the people that know 0% about something. So you don't need to be an expert to share knowledge on something. So for you, you're a journalism expert.
00:07:43.866 - 00:08:01.560, Speaker B: I can tell you asked fantastic questions. I've listened to your spaces before, but even if you are new to it and you only knew 20% about interviewing or journalism you could still share because you're ahead of the vast majority of people that know nothing. And people are willing to listen to other people who even know just 20% about something.
00:08:02.330 - 00:08:33.690, Speaker A: Oh, 100%. And also, just to add to that curiosity is value. I remember I used to study other journalists who were on 2020. We had Barbara Walters, a ton of people, and I was so intimidated watching them. And then I saw Howard Stern, completely different style. And even Joe Rogan, who sits there sometimes and is like, very. You can see the confusion and perplexed facial expression.
00:08:33.690 - 00:08:53.160, Speaker A: And he just owns it. He's like, well, I don't understand that. What do you mean? And I'm just like, wow, that's inspiring to even say, I don't know, something. I don't understand something. It's not as intimidating as it used to be. And we're seeing that more and more. So I love that.
00:08:53.160 - 00:08:59.160, Speaker A: Let's get into nfts. By the way, Varun, are you able to speak now?
00:09:00.010 - 00:09:00.810, Speaker B: Let's try.
00:09:00.880 - 00:09:06.330, Speaker A: This is a test. Yeah, we can hear you. By the way, Varun is the CEO of hashflow.
00:09:06.830 - 00:09:08.054, Speaker B: Nice to meet you, Varun.
00:09:08.182 - 00:09:08.570, Speaker A: Hello.
00:09:08.640 - 00:09:15.760, Speaker B: Nice to meet you. Sorry I was low rutpole at the beginning, so I told Nicole to know and I'll join halfway through.
00:09:17.490 - 00:09:35.970, Speaker A: Yeah, no worries. So glad you could be here with us, though. I want to get into nfts because you tweet about that stuff a lot. I liked your tweet, how to successfully market an NFT. I pinned it. It's the second one. If you just swipe.
00:09:35.970 - 00:09:55.420, Speaker A: You wrote old way rt and tag three friends bought your followers. Pay influencers to shill new way. Create compelling content. Extreme transparency. Founders in the trenches with the community. Can you give us some examples of that? Or, like, who you think is doing a good job?
00:09:55.950 - 00:10:37.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's a big reason why I entered this space and tried to create content is because when I joined in, I really started tweeting in December of last year, every project strategy, marketing strategy was the same. I'd go on and half my feed would be tag three friends, retweet, comment, your wallet address. That was the entire marketing campaign it took to make a project sell out. And it drove me nuts. And that's the reason why I wanted to create compelling content, is because I felt like I was surrounded by really low quality, low intelligence content. And when the bull market ran out, that strategy really stopped working.
00:10:37.270 - 00:11:20.662, Speaker B: And you saw some founders who did really well in the bull market still try it, and it would just keep failing. And then you saw some newer founders. One example that comes to mind is Frank, for instance, the founder of Dgods, and know he, in the middle of a bear market, created one of the most hyped projects of all time and sold out and generated millions and millions of dollars. And he did that solely off of the way he understood the culture and got involved with the community. He was on every Twitter space every day and night for, like a month straight. He had his blog where he was talking about the creative process. He was in his discord, talking to his community and doing amas every day.
00:11:20.662 - 00:11:56.494, Speaker B: And he just had a general pulse on the culture and what people want. And you know what? The Utes doesn't have any utility. He hasn't announced anything. It does, but it still has this incredible demand behind it just because he ran this incredible marketing campaign where he just clearly demonstrated he understands web three and the kind of contrast that you look at. What happened with doodles. Doodles was a top three or four project amongst all projects last year. It's built out like a corporation.
00:11:56.494 - 00:12:26.490, Speaker B: They have an executive board. They have a lot of people involved. They have Pharrell. And it's being run really well. But what's taken it down over the last few months? It went a month without tweeting. And in web three, that's just, like, not acceptable by the culture or the community. More important than the product itself, more important than what your product does, is if you understand the people you're selling to, especially in web three, that's just a demonstration of it right there.
00:12:26.490 - 00:12:43.042, Speaker B: That Doodles has taken such a hit just because they didn't tweet. So that's really what inspired the tweet, is the old way of doing things is really hurting projects now, and the new way is rewarding founders and holders just because they understand how web three, culture and community works.
00:12:43.096 - 00:12:56.390, Speaker A: Now, I love that. Can we get into culture and community for a second? What does it take to build a culture that's thriving and a community that's engaged?
00:12:58.170 - 00:13:16.022, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I think compelling content. Consistent, compelling content is everything. Being able, whether it's memes. Right. There's a lot of people, I think a wobb. For instance, he's the founder of the Seals.
00:13:16.022 - 00:13:52.722, Speaker B: He just creates very entertaining memes every day, and the project's doing well just because he is creating that compelling content and building a culture around memes and his community. And it's just culture building in front of people. Right. And because I don't want to dunk on them too much. But doodles, they didn't tweet. And so they weren't cultivating that community or culture anymore, and they kind of left it to the holders. So really, how you build a culture in a community is your founders and your leadership, as I said in that tweet, need to be in the trenches.
00:13:52.722 - 00:14:13.022, Speaker B: They need to be interacting with their community. They need to be holding spaces daily. They need to be in the trenches. And they got to be able to delegate to other people in the project to do the other work, the artistic work, the product work, the development work, and the leaders need to be the ones in the trenches leading from the front 100%.
00:14:13.076 - 00:14:34.180, Speaker A: I remember that's why I got into goblins, because of those nightly spaces they would have with the guys making the weird goblin noises. I thought it was so funny that I bought into it, and I wanted to be a part of it just because of that. However, I did buy at the top, and I did lose some money.
00:14:36.410 - 00:15:26.120, Speaker B: I tweeted about them a ton because I think they created basically the playbook that's working right. Like, they were, like, the first project in the bear market to succeed. It was like, a few weeks into the bear market, everything was tanking. And then Goblin town came out, and they had this really unique, interesting strategy where they basically did performance art every night in Twitter spaces, and their leaders were in there, and they got the community involved, and they built this wild, unique, interesting culture. Unfortunately, I don't know if the evolution was there, and I think when they exposed who they were, it kind of took away some of that mystique. I believe mystique and hyper are fortunately, or unfortunately, a big part of NFT marketing. But they built a lot of the playbook that works right now.
00:15:28.650 - 00:16:08.580, Speaker A: What do you think contributes to a project having longevity and evolving to the point that they still maintain the hype, the excitement, the mystique? Because I feel like a lot of the projects that you've named here in the space, including doodles, and by the way, I love them. I love their events. I love the art, even that they sort of dropped the ball on their twitter a little bit. Which projects do you look at? And you're like, wow, I'm really impressed with the way they're running this, and I think this is a long term play.
00:16:09.990 - 00:16:46.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like the way artifact runs their ecosystem. And again, what I'm about to say, I don't know if it's the most positive thing in the world. I don't know if it's the most negative thing. But the way NFT marketing works, and it just is what it is, is that you need to constantly have some sort of level of hype and mystery. Like, that's just the way NFT marketing works. This is not a product focused space. And what I mean by that is a project can release the greatest NFT product of all time, but if they're not marketing it well, it's not going to sell and no one's going to care.
00:16:46.878 - 00:17:13.366, Speaker B: But the NFT product could be the worst product of all time. But if they're marketing it well, people will buy it no matter what you look at. Like Luke, for instance. So I like artifact because they have this way of constantly making their holders anticipate what's coming next. There's always a next thing. There's never like downtime where you got everything there is and you just kind of wait around. There's always a next thing.
00:17:13.366 - 00:17:42.250, Speaker B: They're always teasing and hyping something new. They're always announcing something new. And you look at what they've released. They've released thousands of nfts, right? They have like ten different collections, but they've never experienced dilution. And what I mean by that is you see a lot of projects where they release their secondary project, like World of women, for instance. They released world of women galaxies, and it hurt their ecosystem. There was a level of dilution there that took place that hurt the prices.
00:17:42.250 - 00:18:18.074, Speaker B: And I'm not saying the product is good or bad. I'm just saying the way they handled their marketing and their product is it felt dilutive and the price went down because of it. But you look at artifact and they do a really good job of creating mystery and hype. They have these four or five different ecosystems with the sneakers, with the Clonex, with the monolith boxes. And you're never quite sure how they tie all together, and you're never quite sure what's coming next. And they do a really good job of cultivating that mystery and hype and making you wonder. I got to hold on to my assets because something new is about to come.
00:18:18.074 - 00:18:30.670, Speaker B: I'm about to miss out on something new if I sell. So I can't sell. It's that element of hype, mystery, excitement, that is the most valuable asset in all of nfts.
00:18:32.710 - 00:19:16.458, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that makes complete sense. I guess the pattern that I've seen is projects are good at creating hype. They're good at creating mystery in the beginning, once they sell out, and sometimes they get called a rug pull, rightfully so. Because of this, the floor price drops. The founders are nowhere to be found, and a lot of them are anonymous, too, even me as an influencer. And this happened to a lot of my friends as well. There have been projects that have reached out, asked us to do giveaways.
00:19:16.458 - 00:19:52.874, Speaker A: And at the time, this is like eight months ago, we're thinking, wow, this is like a great offer to our communities and these whitelist spots that we're giving out. And I remember doing one and it was like, for sure bought. It, had like 40,000 likes, retweets. And then I gained 40,000 fake followers. And literally within two weeks, all those followers were gone. I was like so embarrassed that I did it. I hated it.
00:19:52.874 - 00:20:24.340, Speaker A: And the project, of course, sold out. But within two days, completely, the floor price completely dropped. And all I kept thinking was, God, I hope these five or anybody who bought that project, I mean, someone's ending up holding the bags. But it just was like the worst feeling. And I keep thinking to myself after that, I haven't done a giveaway unless I'm sure about the project founders. But I couldn't stop thinking about it after that happened.
00:20:24.870 - 00:20:56.926, Speaker B: It's a maturation process for the entire space. It's a maturation process for the consumers, right? The people buying the nfts. But it's also one for kind of the thought leaders and the content creators of the space, like you and I, where this is a brand new space. We don't really know what the product is. Is it an investment class? Is it just a collectible? No one really knows. And so it was a brand new space where now we're being offered money. And do I do giveaways? Are they going to rug? We don't know.
00:20:56.926 - 00:21:31.642, Speaker B: And what's happened is over the last ten months or so, a whole lot of people have experienced a whole lot of pain for the first time. And that pain is going to teach a lot of lessons. It's going to teach a lot of lessons to the people who might have done giveaways, who had experienced bots. And it's going to teach a whole lot of lessons to maybe people who bought rug pools. And they know, okay, now if I see someone doing a giveaway or I see an advertisement for lazy llamas or I don't even know if that's a real project, but made up project, I'm not going to buy it. So it's a maturation. It happened with crypto, like four or five years ago.
00:21:31.642 - 00:21:47.360, Speaker B: It was the ico craze. Everyone was buying every single ICO there was, and a lot of people lost a ton of money and they felt that pain. And now the ICO thing really doesn't happen. And we as content creators and people in the community had to go through that pain as well.
00:21:47.730 - 00:22:08.310, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. Also, something I've been hearing and I don't know if it's true, and without mentioning names, I've heard that people are able to bought their spaces too. Meaning like, you'll see 1000 people listening to a space, but like, I don't know, 400 of them are fake people. Is that actually happening? Do we know about this?
00:22:08.460 - 00:22:29.078, Speaker B: Yeah, that's absolutely happening. I've seen the tools that do that. People post screenshots of it. I know some spaces that are leveraging that. It's unfortunate. There is ways to fake anything in this space. And unfortunately, you got to assume you can't trust everyone automatically.
00:22:29.078 - 00:22:31.580, Speaker B: There's a lot of ways to fake everything you see.
00:22:31.890 - 00:22:48.020, Speaker A: Yeah, that was a new one for me. I hadn't heard of that until recently. So that was interesting. I want to talk about building a brand. You've tweeted about this. You've tweeted your brand has the power to make you rich. How does that work?
00:22:49.030 - 00:23:44.530, Speaker B: Yeah, content is king in 2022 and moving forward. It's an attention economy, right? And the way you get attention is by creating content and building a platform and building your brand. And the people that are really going to have the most leverage moving forward, especially when the bull market comes back around, is going to be the people with a platform. And hopefully those people with the platform and built a strong brand can use it in the right way. You saw in the last bull run, there was a lot of people who use their platform and brand the wrong way and they've disappeared. But by building a platform and a brand, you create leverage. You create the ability to get your voice out there and you get the ability to use that voice however you want, whether it's selling products, whether it's building communities, whatever it is, your message is able to get out there because you have a brand and a platform.
00:23:44.530 - 00:24:16.240, Speaker B: And if you build your brand the right way, you'll get a lot more leverage. If you build your brand the wrong way and do shady things in the space, you'll lose that platform pretty quickly and you'll sell out. So I'm building my brand. I hope I'm building it the right way. I want to build trust with my audience. I want to build quality content. I want to educate people and I believe that that's going to be one of the most valuable assets you can have in 2023 is just a platform where you can spread your message.
00:24:16.850 - 00:24:39.880, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that's undeniable. I was listening to the all in podcast and they were talking about the same thing and they mentioned how any influencer, once they have the audience who trusts them, they can sell out anything. I mean, you saw it with Mr. Beast and what that burger joint did you hear about?
00:24:41.290 - 00:24:55.782, Speaker B: Don't want to. Mr. Beast is one of the probably the smartest content creator we've ever seen. I would reckon that his burger is probably nothing special, but his brand is so powerful that he's making hundreds of millions off it. It's incredible.
00:24:55.926 - 00:25:15.700, Speaker A: Oh yeah. People trust people way more than they seem to trust brands. And we just see that time and time again. Who else is building a brand that you look at and you're like this know soon will be able to sell anything? Or maybe they already can.
00:25:16.710 - 00:25:50.640, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of interesting brands out know. As you said, I think MrBeast is the greatest content creator and brand architect I've ever seen in my life. He's built this such positive, powerful brand of giving to others everything he makes, he reinvests in himself. His vision is completely long term. He's not selling out really. He's not hurting his brand in any way. He's been doing this for years and his vision has always been long term and building the biggest platform possible.
00:25:50.640 - 00:26:27.320, Speaker B: And so I really admire what he's doing in the NFT space. You look at some content creators like Zenica, who's really focusing on bringing value and being positive. And I like what the guys at the Nifty are doing. They have this really entertaining platform where they're just trying to share value and entertainment as much as they can. Unfortunately, there's other voices in the space who are just here to try to extract as much value as possible, and that's unfortunate. But as long as you're building a brand where you're giving more value than you're taking, you'll be building a powerful brand and platform.
00:26:29.130 - 00:26:48.160, Speaker A: I totally agree. Who are your favorite people to follow? Who do you learn from? And it doesn't have to be in the NFT space, just anyone that you look at and you're like, this is the type of content I'm trying to provide, or this is who I learn from, or wow, I've never seen something like this.
00:26:49.970 - 00:27:19.266, Speaker B: That's a good question. Let me think about that for a second. When I created this. I created it because I didn't see anyone else really doing what I'm doing. But I do like brands that create content to help other people, and there's no secondary motivation to sell something. I'm looking at someone in the crowd right now, for instance, Chris Cantino. He's in the crowd.
00:27:19.266 - 00:27:48.500, Speaker B: He tweets a lot about just his view of the market and trends and what he think the future is going to be based on his unique perspective of being in the industry for so long. And I wish there was more people who created content like that, who provided that kind of unique perspective based on their history. I unfortunately believe there's too many content creators who just say things to rile people up just to get attention. Kind of the Kanye west approach. I think we need less Kanye's and more thought leaders in the space.
00:27:49.510 - 00:28:17.878, Speaker A: Amen. I feel the same way about Chris Cantino when I see his tweets. They always have value. They're always insightful, always make me think. But also, we can't forget, track records matter, too. And he has a good one, and that's something that he has built over time. And people trust him because of that, him and his wife.
00:28:17.878 - 00:28:58.140, Speaker A: So that's something that people need to take into account, that track records actually do matter. And sometimes it's hard because there are a lot of anon accounts and a lot of anon accounts who have rubbed people. Not that they all do that, but just the fact that that has happened so much. It's like, who are these people coming into the space, not sharing who they are? We don't know what they've built. We don't know their past, and we're just sitting here and buying into everything they say and then spending money on the projects that they put out. And some of them are definitely rugs. That's a thing.
00:28:59.790 - 00:29:56.006, Speaker B: You're right. And I was thinking about this yesterday. You never see tech companies who create products, who are trying to go public, that have anonymous founders in the tech industry. If there was ever a company that their board was all anonymous, for some reason, everyone would call that out question and be like, wait, what are you trying to do? What are your motivations? And I understand that web three is a very different culture overall, but it still feels weird that such a large swath of the thought leadership in the space is anonymous. And I was watching an interview the other day with someone who has a lot of power and influence in the space, and they were just like, blurring out their face in the interview. It felt so weird. I don't think if you're trying to build a brand that's going to expand outside of web three and outside of NFTs, which I think is the goal, is to make NFTs go mainstream.
00:29:56.006 - 00:30:12.590, Speaker B: I don't know how you can build that brand if you're going to be completely anonymous. No one outside of web three finds that behavior acceptable. So I think if you're really trying to build a global brand, something that extends past this, I don't know how you can do that anonymously.
00:30:12.930 - 00:30:58.000, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely harder. G Money talks about this because he wears his punk over his face in interviews, but we've all seen him on stage without it. We've all talked to him, gone to an event with him or that he threw. So it's very hard to be completely anonymous. And you definitely question motives when someone is. When did you start your newsletter and what is the most impactful part of your social presence? Because you're not just on Twitter, you have a substack and an email that goes out to tons and tons of people.
00:30:59.330 - 00:31:29.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I started my newsletter when I had zero followers. So I've had the same content strategy from zero followers to 55,000 followers. And that strategy is this. Every day since I started tweeting, I send out two tweets a day. Every week I send out two to three threads, and every week I send out one newsletter. And that's been my strategy since I started, when I had zero platform at all. And I did it for many different reasons.
00:31:29.854 - 00:31:57.454, Speaker B: I did it because I wanted to flex that muscle. I wanted to build that creative muscle. I believe thinking is a muscle and getting ideas out of your brain is a skill set. And so I didn't want to wait until I had a platform to start exercising that skill set. I wanted to do it while no one was noticing, so I could suck while no one was noticing. And then once I got the platform, I was an expert and good at it. So I've been sending out, there's actually, when I started, I was sending out a newsletter a day.
00:31:57.454 - 00:32:50.066, Speaker B: I'd spend like an hour and a half every night, and I'm already working 12 hours a day on my other things, but I would spend an hour and a half, 2 hours a night sending out my newsletter to a list of under ten people. And it really helped me synthesize my thoughts, be able to communicate them, and be able to form interesting opinions, because I also believe just forming opinions is a skill set. And so I liked the newsletter because it's long form writing. I've always had a hobby for long form writing. When I was a kid, my parents bought me a typewriter and I'm not some old Geezer or something, I'm 32, but my parents are really cheap so they bought me a typewriter and I would write stories and stuff on there. And writing has never been my job, but it's always been kind of just a passion and a hobby. And so I started the newsletter and I also think it was just a great decision because it grew with me.
00:32:50.066 - 00:33:24.430, Speaker B: I believe if I never did that and I started a newsletter now where I am, I wouldn't come anywhere close to the growth I've had so far. I have close to 9000 subscribers right now, which I believe makes it one of the biggest newsletters in the space. I don't think I'd be anywhere close to that if I started that recently. So I'm really grateful to myself that I made that decision. I think that it's benefited me in so many ways, both from having a platform to just having the skills to be able to communicate my thoughts because of the long form writing.
00:33:25.330 - 00:33:38.770, Speaker A: Is there anything that you're passionate about outside of the web three NFT space that you think you'll start tweeting about down the line or sending, including in your newsletter?
00:33:39.830 - 00:34:09.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a few different areas I tweet on and I mentioned self improvement, platform growth and web three. I think my content is the intersection of those three areas. There's a lot of other things I'm interested in in this world. I'm super into sports, I'm super into fitness. I'm really big in the tech space. I manage a team of tech consultants. I've been a developer most of my life.
00:34:09.514 - 00:34:54.886, Speaker B: I do tweet about development sometimes, but I don't believe there's a compelling intersection of those other areas with kind of the other areas I have. And what I mean by that is I think there's a really compelling intersection between web three self improvement and platform growth because I think everyone in web three wants to build a platform in one way or another. And I believe everyone in web three, because of the state of the space, needs to stay balanced in one way or another. This is a space filled with dopamine hits. It's arguable. But I do believe a lot of this is just gambling disguised as investing. A lot of people are just buying jpegs and trading them and just wanting to make a quick buck.
00:34:54.886 - 00:35:35.000, Speaker B: And that's not investing, that's gambling. And so gambling in these constant dopamine hits are incredibly unhealthy mentally. And so I believe there's a lot of people, whether they realize it or not, they need to think more about balance and more about self improvement. And so that's why I think a lot of my content around that has been so compelling. So I think I found my niches kind of web three self improvement platform building, and I think the intersection between those are really compelling. There's other things I'm interested in. I kind of experimented with those things when I had a smaller platform and they didn't take off as much.
00:35:35.000 - 00:35:51.870, Speaker B: So those are my niches. I'm going to lean super hard into them if things change. I'm always ready to pivot if other things work. But that is kind of where I think I most can authentically relate to and provide value to my audience.
00:35:52.530 - 00:36:14.100, Speaker A: I want to get into the self improvement stuff, but before that, I want to quickly talk about programming, because I saw you tweeted about it. What advantage does it give people to learn how to program, to learn how to code? Like someone like me, for example, or anybody. What advantage does that give us?
00:36:14.790 - 00:36:48.174, Speaker B: It's a high leverage skill. So I actually wrote this about this in my newsletter I sent out about half an hour ago. It's a very high leverage skill where you learn it and it does many different things. The time you spend in it, it improves your professional value. People who know programming make, on average, about $50,000 more in their career per year. It helps you build side hustles. So by learning programming, you could build software that you can sell to people.
00:36:48.174 - 00:37:42.238, Speaker B: You can build software that optimizes your workflow, makes things you do quicker, and it also relates to a lot of different fields. So I only have this NFT God platform because a couple years ago, I started learning Python on the side. And so I was learning Python on the side, and I was building stock screeners with the python. And then I took those stock screeners. I started doing crypto screeners because I was into bitcoin, and then from crypto screeners, I started getting into, I started hearing more about nfts, which led to me discovering nfts, which led to me building this platform. And so it's just a very high leverage skill where you learn it on the side and you learn the skill set, and it branches off and improves so many other areas of your life. And so that's why I tweet about a lot, because I really believe everyone should be trying to pick it up.
00:37:42.238 - 00:37:54.020, Speaker B: And I also believe a lot of people are intimidated and scared by it when it's really not as difficult as it looks. I think people need to kind of work through that fear because there's so many benefits to picking it up.
00:37:54.890 - 00:38:32.462, Speaker A: Okay, first of all, sold. I'm in. Second of all, that's how I feel about shit posting. As weird as that sounds, I think learning how to ship post and be funny on Twitter just sets you ahead of the curve. And I learned when I first got on here, for years, I had like 4000 followers. And once I learned how to do that and I haven't shit posted in a while, which is why I don't feel like anything has gone as viral as my ship posts. But once I started doing that, it opened me up to a whole new world.
00:38:32.462 - 00:38:43.954, Speaker A: I started connecting with other ship posters who were big on the app, and they would start replying like, it's a vibe. Honestly. Honestly, it really is.
00:38:44.152 - 00:39:15.278, Speaker B: It's web three culture. And that's why I said before I created this account, because I saw 95% of people were shit posting. But I still believe shit posting is absolutely critical to web three. It's the culture. If it didn't exist, the culture wouldn't exist. I believe every NFT and cryptocurrency in the entire world can go to zero. But everyone you talk to on a daily basis on web three, Twitter would still be around because that culture, that shit posting created, keeps us together.
00:39:15.278 - 00:39:28.340, Speaker B: So, yeah, it absolutely is. I mean, at the end of the day, shit posting is entertaining, it's funny, and the number one rule in life is don't be boring. So if you can be funny and entertaining, then you can naturally get people to gravitate to you.
00:39:29.350 - 00:39:54.620, Speaker A: I love it. Okay, last question before we go. In the self improvement category, not activity, but what habit do you think will help people the most? What has helped you the most that you would recommend to anyone and everyone? Is it a morning routine? Is it journaling? What is the thing?
00:39:55.710 - 00:40:29.958, Speaker B: Yeah, it's two things. And they tie together. The first and most important thing is almost all of my good days. The days that I felt like was successful and I felt good about it. I didn't look at my phone the first half hour that day. And I believe there's a lot of scientific reasons behind that. I believe if you wake up and instantly grab your phone, which is something I did for a long time, and I think it's probably something a lot of people do across the world, you're instantly getting dopamine hits the moment you wake up.
00:40:29.958 - 00:41:01.342, Speaker B: And now your brain is going to be in the mode where it's searching for dopamine hits the rest of the day. Okay? So I go out of my way to make sure I do not look at my phone the first half hour of the day. And what I do with that first half hour is I journal. So I pull out my notebook and I just free write. I write what I want to accomplish that day. I write what I'm proud of from the day before, and I write a few things I'm grateful for. And now that puts my brain in a mindset where I'm looking for things to be grateful for.
00:41:01.342 - 00:41:18.600, Speaker B: I'm thinking about my accomplishments. I put myself in a growth mindset instead of being in a mindset where I'm just looking for the next dopamine hit. And so those two habits combined, I think, has the biggest impact on how I view my day. At the end of the day, when I'm getting into bed.
00:41:19.370 - 00:42:02.530, Speaker A: Wow, that is so powerful. The other thing I noticed, once I started having like, a gratitude practice, it sort of got rid of any entitlement that I had. And then I started noticing most people, you're either grateful or you're entitled. You know what I mean? Either you see what you have as a blessing or you see all the things that you have as ordinary, and then you start feeling entitled to stuff. I notice it all over on social media in just, it's become so apparent to me. But Alex or NfT God, whichever one. Whichever one.
00:42:02.530 - 00:42:25.480, Speaker A: Thank you so much for doing this. We'd love to have you back on. For those of you who are here, make sure to follow NFT God. And if you like this show, follow hashlow for updates. We do this every week. Hopefully we can get Chris Cantino on this show. But anyway, thank you so much for doing this, and we'll see you next week.
00:42:26.170 - 00:42:27.490, Speaker B: Take care, everyone. It was a pleasure.
