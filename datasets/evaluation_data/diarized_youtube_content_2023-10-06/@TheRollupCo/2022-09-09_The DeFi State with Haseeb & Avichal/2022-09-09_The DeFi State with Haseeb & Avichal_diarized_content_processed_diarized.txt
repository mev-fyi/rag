00:00:01.450 - 00:00:05.040, Speaker A: Hey, Haseeb, what is happening right now?
00:00:06.050 - 00:00:13.150, Speaker B: So I'll tell you. We always start our Twitter spaces with music so there are no awkward silences.
00:00:13.650 - 00:00:25.014, Speaker A: That is amazing. Well, now there's awkward music instead. That's great. Kidding. Great to meet you. I don't think we've ever chatted. Nicole, how you doing?
00:00:25.092 - 00:00:32.550, Speaker B: To meet you too. I'm very excited for this. Just waiting. Going to add our other speakers.
00:00:33.290 - 00:00:38.680, Speaker A: Looks like Avito just joined. Avita, are you vibing to this music?
00:00:43.450 - 00:00:45.430, Speaker C: I think Avijal is a listener.
00:00:45.590 - 00:00:46.774, Speaker B: Oh, no, he's a speaker.
00:00:46.822 - 00:00:53.100, Speaker A: No, came up on stage. This is crazy.
00:00:54.510 - 00:00:56.880, Speaker B: Avi, shal, how are you liking the music?
00:00:57.410 - 00:00:58.560, Speaker D: I love it.
00:01:00.370 - 00:01:02.622, Speaker A: Can we just keep the music on the whole time?
00:01:02.756 - 00:01:06.240, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Imagine how distracting that would be.
00:01:06.630 - 00:01:08.980, Speaker A: Like background music over us talking.
00:01:09.670 - 00:01:31.930, Speaker B: Oh, my God. All right, well, let me get started and give you guys a formal introduction. Good morning. And by that, I obviously mean GM. Welcome to the Defi state. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Benham. I'm the host of this show and head of community for hashflow.
00:01:31.930 - 00:02:20.182, Speaker B: On this show, we bring in notable speakers, founders, investors, and generally the brightest minds in the industry to discuss what the future of decentralization will look like. What I love about this show is that every guest is so multidimensional and has so much to contribute beyond insights on DFI and web three. So if you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you're in the right place. Today we have with us my co host, Varun, also known as Gandalf the Brown, our CEO. We also have two special guests for this episode of the DFi State. The first is Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital. Our second guest, Avi Chal Garg, is an entrepreneur and the founder of Electric Capital.
00:02:20.182 - 00:02:38.830, Speaker B: They have both invested in some of the most established teams in DFi and web three. Today, we'll be discussing the future of DFI compliance and much more. My first question, and Varun, I'll let you go first. For those who aren't familiar, what is compliant Defi?
00:02:41.330 - 00:03:30.206, Speaker C: Thanks, Nicole, for the intro. And Haseeb Abishal. Super excited to have you guys here. We've been planning this for a while, so we can also talk about the music as well. I think I wanted to quickly define when we announced the space, we said compliant Defi Battleground. So I just want to give a quick context on what we meant by. So I think over the last few months or several months, there's been this new narrative being spun where it's like DeFi is going to be regulated or it's going to be compliant, or more like DeFi wouldn't be taken off unless you have tradfi actually coming into the DeFi space.
00:03:30.206 - 00:04:05.526, Speaker C: Otherwise, it will just be this cyberpunk small movement, which will not go anywhere unless the big players get involved, and the big players will not get involved unless you regulate Defi and bring a compliant defi in. Think I've spoken in the past both to Haseeb, and I think you guys had, what was interesting is you guys had some interesting but different ideas around how that space is going to evolve. So just wanted to open the stage for both of you guys to kind of share your thoughts. I think, haseeb, you had interesting thoughts there, and I think, Abhishev, we can speak to AsiB.
00:04:05.558 - 00:04:07.020, Speaker A: I definitely have the more interesting.
00:04:10.590 - 00:04:15.918, Speaker D: Haseeb, which side are you going to take? Because I need to take the other side. So I need to know what you believe so that I could take the other side of it.
00:04:16.004 - 00:04:29.378, Speaker A: I'm definitely going to be the anti compliant deFi. So you're the pro compliant deFi. Avitrol generally plays the role of demand in these kinds of discussions. Me, I'm the more crypto native one. So just remember that, everyone. Okay. All right.
00:04:29.378 - 00:05:52.458, Speaker A: Why am I against comply DeFi? So compliant DeFi, the TLDR for complying DeFi is basically the idea that DeFi, originally the genesis of DeFi was this idea that we're going to take financial primitives that normally are largely untouched by the Internet. Most traditional fintech companies, they're basically like kind of thin uis on top of the exact same companies that you've already been dealing with in the normal kind of brick and mortar finance world. And DeFi is this idea that, what if we take all these financial primitives, we just turn them into permissionless, decentralized code, and we just run on the blockchain, and it's kind of a pure marketplace state of nature where the best protocol wins. That's Defi in a nutshell. And compliant Defi is the idea, like, well, some people are mad that we're doing that, and because some people are mad that we're doing that, why don't we create these little segregated pools within DeFi where everybody is kyc, so we make sure that nobody is potentially a sanctioned actor, nobody is potentially some kind of illegal criminal that's interacting with compliant DeFi. We have restrictions on what kind of tokens you can list, because maybe some of those tokens could be securities. And so we're going to create this little walled off garden that is separate from everything else, that is compliance, so that everybody's compliance departments at their hedge fund or whatever is totally happy with the state of who's in there.
00:05:52.458 - 00:06:28.642, Speaker A: And that's how DeFi is going to scale, how it's going to grow, how it's going to whatever. And the reason why I'm against this, not against this in the sense that I don't mind if people try this, I think it's totally fine. It's worth trying, but I don't think it's going to succeed. You can see that it's not succeeding so far. If you look at the most notable example of compliant DeFi, which is Aave pro, so ave pro is a version of AAve. It's like a segregated Aave pool, basically, that only allows certain Kyc actors, and it's basically a ghost town. There's nobody in Aave pro, nobody borrowing, nobody lending.
00:06:28.642 - 00:07:24.460, Speaker A: The APIs in there are effectively non existent. And the story of why people wanted Aave Pro to succeed, why they thought it would succeed, is because everyone's heard the story that there are lots of these big hedge funds, these big pools of capital that see these yields in Defi, or the yields that used to be in Defi. Rather, they're not so much there today, but they saw the juicy defi yields, and they were like, I really want that. I want to get these amazing DeFi yields, especially at a time when nominal yields in the normal world were basically rock bottom, near zero. So they thought, okay, well, I can't get access to normal DeFi, but I can get access to this regulated deFi. So they show up, all these hedge funds converge onto Ave pro to go play around with regulated DeFi, and they do the KYC, they write smart contracts, they do all the stuff, they get ready, they all show up. And all of a sudden, what they find is that the people there are the same old hedge funds they were already trading against.
00:07:24.460 - 00:08:14.902, Speaker A: And so they're not getting Defi yields. They're getting the yields that other people in Aave Pro are willing to pay, who are other hedge funds who also have access to traditional markets, and nobody who's a regular hedge fund is going to be paying crazy DeFi rates to borrow this stuff. Where are those yields coming from? Which is really the question around why regulated DeFi, or compliant DeFi is attractive, is so much of what attracts people to DeFi is rates liquidity. The different aspects of things they can get in defi they can't get elsewhere. And when you restrict it to only being regulated actors, then what you get is a much crappier version of the markets that already exist off chain. That's what Ave pro is. Ave pro is a bunch of people who are expecting DeFi rates and they got regular rates and they're like, wait, never mind, I don't care about like, there's nothing about borrowing on chain that makes it more attractive.
00:08:14.902 - 00:09:00.410, Speaker A: What I really wanted was the juicy apys. They're not getting that. And that seems to be a replay of almost every case I've seen of quote unquote regulated or compliant DeFi. That it is largely a misunderstanding of what makes DeFi attractive. What makes DeFi attractive is that it's open, is that anybody can use it, and that it's this global marketplace where the people who really need to borrow, who can't borrow in regular ways and are willing to pay higher interest rates, can make the overall borrowing market look really attractive. But that doesn't work in compliant DeFi, because the people who are in compliant DeFi, almost by definition, have other ways to borrow and have access to other markets, which causes these markets to become much less competitive. So that's my story for why I'm bearish on regulated compliant DeFi.
00:09:01.550 - 00:09:02.406, Speaker D: That was compelling.
00:09:02.438 - 00:09:05.180, Speaker A: Haseeb, thank you.
00:09:07.310 - 00:09:48.566, Speaker D: Okay, so I'm taking the other side of this. In reality, I don't know how this is going to play out. So it's kind of an interesting intellectual exercise to sort of think through how this might play out. I think on the other side of it, just listening to this, there are a couple of components to the argument for why it might not play out, and I think we can kind of look at those. So one is that it hasn't really taken off yet, and I would argue it's because the current implementations of it are kind of clunky, which know, sort of tried and true crypto dodge. Right? It's like, oh, it's just not here yet. It will be one day when it's easier to use.
00:09:48.566 - 00:10:58.270, Speaker D: But I do think we're starting to get to a place where you can start to do some things. Like if Coinbase had some sort of protocol to attest that you are an accredited investor and you tie that, I don't know, to maybe a soul bound NFT. Or there are people playing right now with zero knowledge based systems that can attest to you being a certain kind of accredited investor or non accredited or being an institution or having certain kinds of assets off chain. So I think some of that infrastructure needs to exist to make it really easy for people to just come into the system. The reason I think it's not such like a, hey, people have tried it and it's never going to work kind of a thing, as I think there is just by dollar volume. The reality is, you know, a very large portion, if not majority of capital in the world is actually routed through institutions that are pretty risk averse about these kinds of things. And I think the Tornado cash example is a good example where a lot of institutions are scared that if they participate in the unregulated stuff, that even if they're good actors, they don't really know who their counterparties are.
00:10:58.270 - 00:11:35.690, Speaker D: And then did you end up accidentally doing a transaction with the north korean government and now you're on an SDN list somewhere or your assets get frozen. So the risk is real. And these institutions being risk averse, I think, means that they're actually sitting on the sidelines. I think the arguments around the rates are going to fall, and so why would anybody do it, I think is sort of a red herring because that's going to happen regardless. That's not really a property of regulated versus unregulated. I think that's just a property of how many market participants there are. And as you kind of move down that curve of liquidity, greater liquidity is going to drop the yields regardless.
00:11:35.690 - 00:12:17.046, Speaker D: That's sort of a red herring. I don't think that really matters either way. That just feels inevitable. The rates on Defi are going to have to collapse as more liquidity comes in and also as we sort of get our handle around the risks, and the risks go down because everything ends up being formally verified and battle tested and so on. And then I think to the argument that nobody really wants this or even if this existed, who would come in and use it? I think in a lot of markets, when you look at kind of how the evolution of the market plays out, you sort of have the head, you have the torso, and you have the tail in these really long tail markets. And a lot of the early adopters are sort of in the tail right now. It's all individuals that are doing this kind of stuff.
00:12:17.046 - 00:13:08.086, Speaker D: And so the yields can be really high and they're willing to seek risk. And I think when people say institutions, too often they think of the head, so they're thinking of the blackrocks or the blackstones of the world, like these trillion dollar asset managers that have tons and tons of capital, and I actually think those people will be laggards. I think the people that are going to come in that are sort of quote unquote institutional are people who have in the single digit billions of dollars. So they're small enough to be nimble, and often they're probably still run by the people who started the thing. And so they're willing to take risk, but they're not willing to take so much risk that they want to be a counterparty to a north korean transaction. And so in aggregate, that is actually a pretty significant amount of capital. And I see a lot of that capital sitting on the sidelines, where if they had the right sort of way to enter the space and know that their counterparties are trustworthy, people don't really care who they are.
00:13:08.086 - 00:13:52.982, Speaker D: They just want to know that it's not some bad state actor, that they would bring a lot of liquidity into the space and that torso of people who have, let's say, one to $20 billion and can move pretty quickly. I think in aggregate, actually, a lot of capital. And so I think when I think institutional coming in, that's who I think of is going to come in first. There's a bunch of that capital that's sitting on the sidelines that can come in, but today would not come in. So I don't know if you kind of look at the arguments around why this won't work, I think there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines. I think the ease of use is a real issue right now. And if it were like, you do one attestation and then you can just use any DeFi protocol that subscribes to that protocol, there would be a lot of capital that comes in, and I think it would come primarily from people who are willing to take a little bit more risk than the blackstones of the world.
00:13:52.982 - 00:13:59.080, Speaker D: And then over time, I would expect the yields to collapse anyway. I think that's just going to happen regardless whether it's regulated or not.
00:14:00.010 - 00:14:11.500, Speaker A: Okay, you're saying that the yields are going to go down. There's a lot of capital on the sidelines, but what actually is the value proposition for compliant DFI to the billion dollar plus family office?
00:14:11.870 - 00:14:49.906, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a good question. If we were in the 2016 era of the world, I think it would be far less compelling if yields come down. But I think we're starting to enter a world now where you have two big challenges. One, if you have stagflation in a lot of the world, like the equities, markets are kind of going sideways. It's unclear what happens to a bunch of asset classes. I think some net positive yield may actually be desirable. Like, the yield won't be as good as they have been relative to old DFI in the early days, but they'll still, in many cases, I think, be better than other alternative asset classes.
00:14:49.906 - 00:15:32.802, Speaker D: So I think, just like people rebalancing their portfolios will say, okay, well, this isn't better than the baseline that they're comparing against isn't old DFI. We can make 30, 40, 50%. They're comparing it to bonds that are net negative interest rate. And they're like, okay, should I rotate out of that stuff and be here instead? That's kind of one thought and then two. I think when you think about all of these other asset classes, one of the challenges is that they're just so correlated with each other, because all of the institutions are investing in all of the same stuff. So I think there's desire for essentially new asset classes where, in effect, most of the institutions are not here yet. And therefore, you start getting assets that are uncorrelated or decorrelated, at least in the short term, from all the other asset classes.
00:15:32.802 - 00:16:03.790, Speaker D: And then, of course, as all the institutions come in, that ends up being correlated too. I think that is enough of a driver that it brings in people who are looking at this and saying, okay, well, in the early days, at least for the next two, three, four, or five years, this is a thing that most of the other institutions are not going to do. So I'll put some small percentage of the thing in, and then the fly will case off, which know essentially what happened with bitcoin and ETH, too, right? It's just like that desire for slightly uncorrelated new asset class that has in real rates, like slightly positive returns, is compelling in a stackflationary environment, which is, I think, probably we're rounding.
00:16:04.290 - 00:16:23.000, Speaker A: So that's a great and compelling case for institutions to own. But, like, why defi. Why can't you get that through Coinbase? Why can't you get that through binance? Why do you need this thing to be on? Yield? You can get yield through Coinbase, too. Coinbase will lend down your assets. They'll stake your assets for you. Why do I need to be on.
00:16:23.450 - 00:16:27.190, Speaker D: That's a really. It's a good question. It sounds like I'm winning. Haseeb.
00:16:29.690 - 00:16:32.540, Speaker A: I've called you out to your demise, actually. What's happening?
00:16:33.550 - 00:17:37.994, Speaker D: I think you can see that. I think the debate is over, but I think it's a good question of, like, there's sort of two parts to. There's the. In what form does this play like, is it people just putting money into Coinbase and then Coinbase goes on the back end and does a bunch of stuff? Or are these institutions participating directly? I could certainly see a world where you kind of have these gatekeepers that people deposit their money into, because your typical endowment or something is just not going to have the capabilities in house to go move these assets around in smart contracts and generate that yield. And so they'll essentially delegate that responsibility using tradfi tools contracts, old school contracts, not smart contracts, to some third party. And then that third party goes off and does that. And so then the question is, to what extent will those third parties feel comfortable participating in these markets if you don't know who your counterparty is? I think the tornado cash stuff is really illustrative, right? There was a question of how Coinbase is going to behave if the layer one can stay neutral, if eth can stay neutral.
00:17:37.994 - 00:18:08.230, Speaker D: And they basically said if push came to shroud, they would just opt out. They would just not do it. And to me, that's a signal that actually, if it turns out to be in a world where the coinbases of the world, or the anchorages or the Krakens of the world, those end up being the funnels through which institutions get access, they'll actually be pretty risk averse. They may just pull out if this stuff, there's too much risk there. And one of the ways you could actually make this derisked is to make it compliant by being able to do, like, KYC attestations to say, hey, I'm not a state actor.
00:18:09.450 - 00:19:02.810, Speaker C: Actually, I have an interesting data point there that I wanted to give you guys. Maybe it could help us see what I wish, or both of you, I don't know. So it's probably a neutral point, but maybe interesting. One of the things we had at Hashler was we had this thing called public pools design. And then initially, when we did build that last year, I think the motivation was anyone can contribute or lend capital to the market makers, and the market makers can manage that capital to market make to improve on the capital efficiency. Initially it didn't take off or blow up at the beginning, but lately, though, we've been seeing interest from a bunch of folks asking, can we just give capital to, say, winter mute or Jane street or someone like that? And can they just manage the capital, that's one side. And these are the larger people with lots of capital.
00:19:02.810 - 00:20:01.046, Speaker C: They're looking for passive yields. And then on the market maker side, I think one of the things they've been asking is is it possible for them to get credit that they can use to market make, as opposed to allocating capital to a specific pool, or even maintaining inventory at all times to make the liquidity available? So that what they do is they do something called delayed settlement, where they would take the credit market make and then periodically, every few hours, rebalance the process needed. But then that way they are allocating the capital more efficiently. Obviously, the issue here is who they take capital from. And if you're a taker, then who do you trade with, at least in case of hashlow, because most market makers are kind of KYC. From our side, we know who the counterparty is that removes the risk on the taker side. But on the taker side, to give quotes, I think that's where the compliance usually becomes a little tricky.
00:20:01.046 - 00:20:57.280, Speaker C: In a sense that who do you give quotes? So right now, it seems like people are okay with giving quotes to public keys so long as they have some kind of a TRM labs tool available that they can use to figure out if the key hasn't been sanctioned or hasn't done anything sketchy. On the other hand, if you go on chain KYC, then the question becomes, how is this different from Coinbase? What's incentivizing people to still go to Defi? If you have full on KYC, on Defi, or we think on chain, just looking at chain data to analyze public is going to be sufficient in the future. So that's something I want to share. Maybe you guys have extra thoughts on that. But also I think Ajit from Aave is raising hands. Perhaps he had some thoughts raising Haseeb's comments earlier around. Come by.
00:20:58.370 - 00:21:41.446, Speaker E: Thank you, Varun. So I didn't mean to gate crash the party. I'm a big fan of Haseeb and Avijal, both really legendary investors in our space. But Haseeb, I do need to defend Ave Ark a little bit as kind of the guy who's product managing it. So quick one on that. First of all, when we launched Ave Arc, I think it took a lot of education effort to really onboard like 30 of the biggest crypto native institutions, right? And I think the second part is when we launched it somewhere around November or December, there was a lot of demand for anchor protocol and the 20% yield. So the CEO of fireblocks Michael Shalov at that point said that 500 million worth of assets just flowed into the luna ecosystem.
00:21:41.446 - 00:22:15.382, Speaker E: And I tweeted at the time that here we're trying to build something sustainable and all of the institutions are going into something that's an obvious. Well, I think in hindsight, a Ponzi scheme. So I think there is a lot of demand for yield in institutions. And that was the main attraction. That is still the main attraction. But I think in terms of the timing, right, the yield kind of suddenly dropped off the market. And then one of the things that I noticed is that institutions were looking for liquidity mining, and that's at some point that will probably happen similar to.
00:22:15.382 - 00:23:11.802, Speaker E: I haven't seen a lot of difference between the behavior of individuals and the behavior of institutions in terms of my first hand interactions with all of the institutions that have been onboarded onto aviat, and then some of the cfas who lost about 500 million od per fund in the anchor protocol. So point being that, first of all, when the yield comes back, I think we'll see a lot more activity. And I think amms and products like hashflow, which enable trading activity in a compliant way, are kind of in a much better position also. Yield aggregators like, sorry, trading aggregators, like one inch, are in a much better position. But I think it's too early to write off lending protocols. When I think we see a lot of defi yields are generally zero right now. The other argument I would like to make is very quickly, is that we have seen that opaques and CFI structures have not worked.
00:23:11.802 - 00:23:43.678, Speaker E: We saw Luna fail. We saw Celsius fail. We saw like seven or eight of these entities blockfi nearly go. So what's the real argument for DeFi? It's really the transparency and some of the risk management and systemic risk reduction that comes with having on chain systems. Now that will take some time to educate and sell to institutions around. But I think a lot of people have learned their lesson from the Celsius fiasco and what the markets have gone through. And I think this will really help institutions.
00:23:43.678 - 00:24:03.050, Speaker E: And we have had that conversation with central banks at Aave and so on and so forth. So there's quite a bit of, I think, appreciation that's starting to build up that on chain transparent systems provide better systemic risk management. And that's where really the long term use case for on chain market infrastructure will come from. That's it. And sort of get crashed the party.
00:24:04.190 - 00:25:04.178, Speaker A: Well, okay, first of all, I want to make clear that the work that you guys did into Ave pro is super sorry, Ave arc super valuable. I didn't mean to bash Ave arc. I have nothing against Ave Arc. And earlier, what I said that, look, I have no problem with people trying these things. I think they should try these things because I think we need to figure out what exactly is the landscape, what is it that institutions really want? Because to concede a tiny little iota of grounds to AVTOL, I do think it's likely that DeFi is going to start enshrining some degree of compliance just to make itself palatable to a larger swath of users. I would bet that at some point there's going to be a major protocol that enshrines ofap restrictions into the protocol itself through some kind of governance vote. Because if they don't, there's going to be delistings or there's going to be some situation where they just feel like, look, the overall risk to the protocol is not high if we basically use chainlink to enforce OFAC restrictions.
00:25:04.178 - 00:25:42.038, Speaker A: Like maybe they say, look, I don't like the tornado cash stuff, but he sanctioned north korean entities. Like, yeah, I also don't want them providing liquidity in my protocol. I can imagine something like that happening at the protocol layer, and I think it probably eventually will, just because there's so much capital that is sourced from the US, and it may not be that, it may be some other permutation, something like this, but I think it's quite plausible that eventually happens. And it's in the strategic interest of the protocol, not just the founders of the protocol who don't want to go to jail, but the protocol itself. That's like, hey, I want more users. I want more institutions. And the way to do that is to kind of signal this degree of compliance.
00:25:42.038 - 00:26:30.518, Speaker A: Now, I think the issue that I have is over compliance. Maybe it's a better way to put it right, over compliance. So, Varun, you were laying out this picture that you could imagine that in hashflow, not only do I know who the market makers are, Jane street or flow traders or whoever is market making on top of hashflow, there's also the users, the traders, the takers have to be KYC as well. Because, of course, if you are a regulated market maker, you don't want to be trading against North Korea. You want to make sure that, look, this person better not be North Korea. The problem with this, of course, is that it's a much stronger compliance stance than, for example, what Uniswap is taking. So if you're an LP in uniswap, that means that you are market making.
00:26:30.518 - 00:27:00.958, Speaker A: You are market making on Uniswap, and somebody is trading against you. Somebody's trading against your liquidity. One way you could think about it is that in unity three, they have these ticks, right? Each tick is like a mini little amm. You are basically entering into a joint venture with a bunch of other people who also deposited their liquidity to market make algorithmically, at this tick. That's what it means to deposit liquidity into uni d three. And this joint venture is trading against anybody who's willing to take that liquidity, who could be. I mean, Uniswap is permissionless.
00:27:00.958 - 00:27:25.994, Speaker A: Our whole concept of Defi starts to replace that. It is worthwhile to make that trade off because of the benefits that you get from making this stuff totally open and permissionless. Right? The same way it is for transferring ether, the same way it is for transferring bitcoin. Is that the default? Is that the default is, yes. The default is not, no. That is a very important difference between defi and traditional financial system. And I think it's where a lot of the power of Defi comes from.
00:27:25.994 - 00:28:07.526, Speaker A: If you make the answer default no, which is essentially what you do when you create it. So that users must be KyC'd. That, I think, erases a lot of the benefits of Defi. And of course, it massively increases the difficulty of even bootstrapping such an economy, because almost nobody is KYC. And of course, how would you KYC people from many different countries around the world where people are participating in Defi. We're investors in a protocol called Quadrata, which is an on chain KYC product. And they were telling know they recently went through kind of this first open beta, bringing on a lot of people around the world, and they realized that they had made some really bad assumptions about how the world works.
00:28:07.526 - 00:28:38.980, Speaker A: For example, people in Indonesia very often don't even have last names. They have one name that's kind know people think about it. Sometimes you divide it in a form into first and last name, but they don't have last names. And so if you have a, like, okay, in order to KYC somebody, I need a first name and last name, and I put it into his database. That doesn't work around the world. KYC, people around the world is really frigging hard, but that's what you might demand if you're going to say, hey, I need to know exactly who this person is before I can transact with them.
00:28:40.950 - 00:29:00.560, Speaker B: Haseeb, when it comes to KYC, you said something really interesting that I heard in another interview. You said KYC is going to grow on chain, but that it's not going to be KYC for compliance, it's going to be KYC for marketing. Can you walk us through that? I think you're.
00:29:01.000 - 00:29:17.588, Speaker A: Yes. Sorry about worry. Yes. So here's one version of why KYC matters. So you might remember very recently, DyDx ran this promotion that kind of blew up in their faces. I don't know, mutual. I know you know this because you're an investor.
00:29:17.588 - 00:30:00.452, Speaker A: So Dydx, they have this issue that there are a lot of bots on DYDX. There's a lot of institutional traders who create a bunch of addresses in order to try to mine rewards and farm for airdrops. You guys all know the story. Their idea was that, okay, we want to find some way to make a civil, resistant promotion where we can give individuals, because really, almost everything in Defi cares about retail. And here's also an important difference that I think maybe I didn't go into enough detail on, which I think is worth elaborating. Retail is way more valuable than institutions. It's a little bit counterintuitive for a lot of people.
00:30:00.452 - 00:30:28.200, Speaker A: Why that is, institutions are obviously huge, right? They have billions of dollars. We've been talking about how these vague, fancy, impressive institutions might come into defi and start using it for a lot of money. But institutions suck because they will not pay you. They really only want, they're extremely sophisticated. They are willing to use multiple products, and they're constantly shopping around for the best discount. So they're very savvy buyers. Whereas retail.
00:30:28.200 - 00:31:02.676, Speaker A: Retail mostly, they're the punters, right? They're the people who just kind of want to go take a big risk. They're willing to pay whatever fees. They don't even shop around for fees. If you look at Coinbase, for example, almost all of Coinbase's margin, meaning the actual revenue they make, comes from retail, even though the majority of their volume comes from institutions. The volume from institutions doesn't pay almost anything, whereas the volume from retail retail is willing to pay an arm and a leg because they're not even checking what the prices are. And so institutions basically follow retail. Institutions are like the sharks and retail are like the fish.
00:31:02.676 - 00:31:40.470, Speaker A: And so every protocol, every exchange, everything is really incentivized to attract retail. That's why Uniswap is so successful. Uniswap is not successful because Uniswap has a bunch of institutions trading on them. The reason why Uniswap is successful is because a bunch of retail users buy things on Uniswap. That's what incentivizes all the liquidity, because retail can make bad trading decisions. If the only people buying on Uniswap were trading funds and hedge funds, then you would not make any money providing liquidity on Uniswap because those headfunts would be picking you off and only trading with you when you're mispricing the asset. Okay, so retail is really important.
00:31:40.470 - 00:32:08.044, Speaker A: Doidx is like, okay, we want more retail in the door. We're going to offer this promotion, $25 to anybody who signs up and can prove their real person. And the way that we're going to do that is we're going to ask them for biometrics data, which we are going to store on our own servers. Understandably, that was super creepy. And then crypto Twitter disrated them, and they watched it back. They claimed that, oh, the thing was so successful, we decided to turn it off. I don't know if that's true.
00:32:08.044 - 00:32:49.188, Speaker A: Maybe mutual knows, but it didn't end up going well. But I think the kernel of what Duadx is trying to do there, I think, is absolutely the direction that DeFi is going in. Although I think the mechanism was probably it'll fall through with respect to the optics. So the idea is that, look, if you think about Kyc as being for compliance, then really what you're thinking is that in order for people to use this protocol, they must be KyC. And that kind of sends you back to like, okay, well, how is this better than just a normal exchange? It's kind of a slower, more expensive, normal exchange. But if you use Kyc as a way to say, if you want to KYC, then I will give you rewards, because now I know you're a real person. Kyc.
00:32:49.188 - 00:33:26.200, Speaker A: In normal Internet businesses, KyC is the gold standard for how you tell if somebody is real. I used to work at Airbnb. I used to be an anti fraud engineer before I got into crypto and Airbnb, there are all these little things that we would do to try to figure out if somebody was a real person or if they were a bot and they were some kind of fraudster. So there are little frictions that you'll throw at them that are kind of annoying, that try to get them to prove they're a real person. Right? If you're slightly worried, you might give them a captcha, if you're a little bit more worried you might do something a little bit bigger. But if you're like, look, I need you to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're a real person. The biggest, fattest, most difficult friction that you can throw at somebody is to ask them to KYC.
00:33:26.200 - 00:34:12.630, Speaker A: And that's why almost every major exchange asks you to KYC. I mean, it's not just because obviously there are laws about this, but also because they want to know that you're a real person. This will eventually come to DeFi as a form of civil resistance for marketing, because if you don't know who you're talking to is retail or not, if you don't know whether they're a real person or not, then you can't market because you'll be wasting your money on bots. And I think that's where so much of the inefficiency of DeFi relative to centralized exchanges comes from, is that inability to effectively direct their marketing. Oh, looks like Antonio just came on stage. I don't know how much you've heard of me talking about the biometric thing.
00:34:13.980 - 00:35:01.360, Speaker F: A few minutes ago and heard you were talking about that, so figured I'd jump on board. Yeah, I mean, I basically just want to echo what Haseeb was saying as well. That was kind of the goal of the program that we came out with sort of in TLDR, what we launched. And I assume Haseeb mentioned this before, is an optional way to do a liveness check, which is basically like record a webcam of your face to do a growth program. And the reason we did it was pretty much exactly what Haseeb is speaking to. I think DeFi is starting to figure things out on the product side, but still has a long way to go on the growth side. And traditionally, the way you think about growth as a normal company is finding different sustainable channels for growth.
00:35:01.360 - 00:35:52.500, Speaker F: I think DeFi kind of found its first one in terms of liquidity mining. But it's really hard for DeFi to do a lot of the standard things that you do to grow like a normal tech company, like give away money for people to use your product or offer incentives or referral programs or things like that, just because there isn't this concept. As Haseeb was mentioning of civil resistance, sort of our goal with DyDX was to kind of take a step, an experimental step, at seeing whether this kind of thing of civil resistance could offer a new growth channel for us. And we did. Never intended. Yeah, I think there were some privacy implications of running this experiment. One of the things that we've done since kind of shutting the experiment down is remove all the PIi from our servers, and we'll be announcing that pretty soon.
00:35:52.500 - 00:36:09.244, Speaker F: But we had always thought of this as an experiment, and clearly we can't, and I think DeFi, more broadly, can't run a lot of these programs in exactly the same way as CFI can, because in a fully decentralized world, you're not even operating the platform.
00:36:09.362 - 00:36:09.692, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:09.746 - 00:36:43.530, Speaker F: With DyDx right now, we're kind of in this hybrid, centralized, decentralized model where we still have the capacity to do some of that. But I think civil resistance is really important. We never really intended to run that indefinitely. But if it had worked, and I think there were some early signs that it did work, like it did actually generate a huge amount of signups for DYDX, then we would kind of find a more privacy protecting and decentralized way to do it long term, but generally echoing what Haseeb was saying and kind of providing some more color on the DyDX situation.
00:36:47.440 - 00:37:58.290, Speaker A: So the TLDR, I think the point that I was making at the kernel of that was that this is a story about how KYC will be used, not for compliance per se, right? Because the idea, if you're using KYC only for quote unquote, marketing or basically civil resistance, it's okay, actually for civil to use the product, right? Even if I don't know who you are and you're not willing to KYC, which is that's okay, you can still use the product, you might not get the marketing rewards, you might not be eligible for liquidity mining, you might not be eligible for airdrops, but you can still use the product and the liquidity that's on DyDX or the rates that are on Ave arc, they'll still be available to you even if you don't KYC. But the person who does KYC might get better rates, or maybe might get worse rates. It really depends on exactly how the thing is structured. But like on Coinbase, if you are not an institution, you get worse rates than the institutions do. But you also get more kind of little goodies, right? There's a lot of things that you'll do for retail that you won't do for institutions, but in the long run, it allows you to monetize retail better than institutions monetize. If Defi can't do that, if they can't effectively price discriminate, then they're going to struggle relative to what CFI is able to do.
00:37:58.900 - 00:39:13.144, Speaker F: Yeah, and I think probably the best way to build this long term is actually kind of similar to one of the things binance just launched today. Actually, they basically launched a way that they'll give like a soul bound NFT to an address on the BNB chain. Hopefully this comes to Ethereum at some point, but basically just attesting to the fact that this is like one unique binance user. Obviously that's not perfect because then you still need to have a binance account to be able to say you're a real user. But suppose like Coinbase, like some other reputable people launch this in the future, basically everybody in crypto, you just have to have an account on a centralized exchange, right? Maybe there are a few extreme cases of people that have done mining or gotten crypto through ways that they haven't gotten KYC already. But I think in this way where if the entities that are already storing KYC, and it just has to be that way in crypto can basically attest to the fact, can effectively share their KYC with all of Defi. Like if you just signed a message or gave an NFT to some address saying that they are a real human, that's really not like DeFi is not infringing on privacy anymore than crypto users privacy is already being infringed on by centralized exchanges at that point.
00:39:13.144 - 00:39:32.940, Speaker F: So I do think there are probably good ways to build some of these programs with stuff like that, or know potentially more advanced, like cryptography. Like could you do a zero knowledge proof about a liveness check or something like that in the future? So I think this is just the really early stages. But I agree with Haseeb and I think we'll see better solutions here in the long term.
00:39:33.100 - 00:40:15.592, Speaker D: So I want to jump in for a couple of thoughts. Mean, it's clear that I think this is going to happen for civil resistance reasons and for customer acquisition reasons. But I think from like a compliance perspective, it is basically potato, potato. Like now that you have a bunch of people, KYC'd ideally with some sort of a system actually that's way better than tradfi because you're not disclosing your information to the protocol itself or to any third party. It's all zero knowledge proofed up. And only in the case where there's something that goes terribly wrong do you need to produce some sort of a view like that's actually just a better architecture for the system. But then I think what you've ended up with by virtue of having to try to acquire users and therefore, having to KyC them is effectively a system that allows you to do compliance.
00:40:15.656 - 00:40:15.836, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:15.858 - 00:41:11.200, Speaker D: Because then it's like you're one click away from, oh, this person is actually an accredited investor. And so for the things that one day, in a far distant future, when you can get us equities on chain and write code around them to access these things programmatically, I think at some point that happens, and people actually want that because a lot of the world can't access these kinds of instruments. Then knowing that people are in certain regulatory regimes and so on seems like a very natural extension to me. So it kind of feels like the Sibyl customer acquisition thing, which is valuable to DeFi protocols today, just opens the gateway for, well, now you can basically build that next layer of, is it an institution, is it an individual? If you want to do lending, how many assets do they actually have? There are all these other things that all of a sudden you start saying are actually really useful to the protocols and to the users, and that very quickly get you into, I think it's like a potato, potato thing. At that point, you basically have compliant DeFi.
00:41:11.860 - 00:41:38.388, Speaker A: I'm going to push back on this because I think the difference is that, yes, okay, there's going to be Kyc. Some people will do it. Obviously, a lot of people won't do it. The question is, do you think DeFi is going to become default? Yes or default? No, right now it's default? Yes, right now default. Whoever you are, whether you're a smart contract, whether you're a multi sig, whether you're whatever, you're fine. Anybody can interact with these protocols. Even other smart contracts can interact with DeFi protocols.
00:41:38.388 - 00:41:57.420, Speaker A: Right. Do you find protocols, borrow from each other in a world where your default, no, DeFi protocols don't pass KYC. Multi sigs don't pass KYC. Anonymous accounts that set up for the first time obviously don't pass KYC. Do you think that's where DFI is going, that if you don't pass KYC, the answer is no, you can't use the protocol?
00:41:57.840 - 00:42:52.524, Speaker D: I think it's very possible. It's a good question. I don't know how it will play out, but I would not be surprised if you end up with an 80 20 situation, which is that a huge chunk of DFI, if you cannot produce the attestation at the start with a KYC to prevent Sibyl attacks for airdrops or whatever else, that most of the liquidity moves there, because that's what the protocols want because they want to know who these people are, or that at the very least, that they're real people and not a bunch of bots that are farming for airdrops. That there's a natural push in that direction and therefore the liquidity ends up there, and therefore you get this flywheel that sort of makes it that you have to be default KYC in some form. I don't think that's a crazy outcome, but in practice, I think what you'll have is you'll have both things coexist, and then people can opt into whichever system they think is better. And then I think the market will kind of shake that out. But I wouldn't be surprised.
00:42:52.652 - 00:43:43.104, Speaker E: I think KyC is just one part of building compliant DeFi protocols. And it's not so much whether DeFi protocols should comply or not comply. But I think there is a certain amount of reality that in the long run, so far, we've existed in a pretty favorable and a little bit benign regulatory environment. And Tornado cash is probably the first time when we have seen the US government kind of act in a very aggressive way. So far, it's only Gary Gensler and the SEC that have been sending out letters. But it's not to say that DeFI will not be subject to some of the same rules and prohibitions or restrictions that the rest of financial markets are now, is that the right answer? Is that how it should be? Absolutely not. I think KYC doesn't work.
00:43:43.104 - 00:44:08.408, Speaker E: AML is a bit of a scam, if you will. But unfortunately, there was other rules. I think moving beyond KYC as well. Right. There is like 200 years of evolution of financial markets. There is. The last 50, 60 years, there have been lots of banking accidents and they have resulted in a whole stack of rules, most recently with Doddfranc and Consumer Protection Bureau and so on.
00:44:08.408 - 00:44:41.940, Speaker E: And so know KYC is just one aspect of it. Sure, it's very restrictive and it locks out a lot of people of the financial system. But at the end of the day, I think if we were to believe for a second that on chain transparent market infrastructure is going to be more resilient than the OPEC Celsius type firms that we've seen, then the question is, what else does compliance defi mean? And is it beyond KYC and AML monitoring? What else is there to compliance defi?
00:44:43.480 - 00:44:45.990, Speaker B: I think you're covering your little bit.
00:44:46.360 - 00:44:47.110, Speaker D: Okay.
00:44:47.800 - 00:44:48.500, Speaker B: Much better.
00:44:48.570 - 00:44:48.804, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:48.842 - 00:45:10.830, Speaker E: Yeah. So I think what else is there, and what else do builders need to think about? Especially now that a bunch of hedge funds have started building things like principal protection notes, structured products and so on, other sort of more sustainable yield products on chain, and I'm involved in some of those efforts, then the question is, what else needs to happen for Defi to really bring institutions on board?
00:45:16.240 - 00:45:16.892, Speaker D: Okay, sure.
00:45:16.946 - 00:45:47.640, Speaker F: I mean, I was basically just going to again echo what you were saying. I think that's a really good framing. Like is Defi default yes or default no? And I think that's a really important question. I think that arguably is like the question. I'm pretty personally against a lot of these permission pool type ideas that are thrown out. Obviously DyDX is compliance and will always be compliance with regulations that we have to be compliant with. But at the same time, I think we as an industry really need to push back on this from kind of a narrative and policy perspective.
00:45:47.640 - 00:46:23.040, Speaker F: And I think if you go to default, no, and Sashiba, I think this is basically what you were saying, but I think you lose a lot of the advantages of DeFi. It's like way harder now to integrate with Uniswap. And a lot of the aggregators or kind of integrations into different swap protocols don't get as much volume now. And I think this just percolates throughout the entire ecosystem. And I think it's really important to kind of draw a line in the sand, hopefully as much as possible, and make it so that DeFi is default yes. And I think that's something totally distinct from are we using civil resistance for growth?
00:46:24.660 - 00:46:49.820, Speaker D: It why do you lose the benefits if you have to have just like some KYC attestation? I mean you don't lose the composability like the protocols can still interoperate and you can move liquidity around and lp tokens still flow like the interoperability and composability and auditability on chain. All of these properties, which I think make the decentralized ecosystem so much better than c five, persist, whether or not you have to be KYc then or not.
00:46:49.970 - 00:47:22.488, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean I agree with you. I think just the billion dollar question is what is the ten x advantage of DFI? I think there are multiple ones, but I think the access piece is really important in the sense that just like anybody can build on top of any protocol with no permissions or anybody can use Uniswap from anywhere in the world. So I think moving in that direction is important and kind of retaining that if we had for the sake of argument a permission system that was more interoperable. Yes, I think that's better. Is that ten x better? I'm not sure.
00:47:22.654 - 00:47:24.664, Speaker E: I think just a quick one on that.
00:47:24.702 - 00:47:24.904, Speaker A: Right.
00:47:24.942 - 00:48:13.560, Speaker E: So Ave is default permissionless, so it's default open, but there are certain entities and users that require, cannot use it in the default open state because they don't know whose money it is on the other side. So for them, I think it's a matter of providing choice. Right. And more recently also, we have seen that protocols like DyDX had to restrict a lot of users on the front end as a result of the regulatory activity. And the third part is that it's also possible to build entirely permissioned supernets, for example, on the Polygon network, where all the DeFi protocols share the same KYC and compliance infrastructure, and therefore none of the composability is lost for the users that are simply not in a position to use permissionless protocols. And that's typically regulated firms and hedge funds and so on and so forth.
00:48:14.380 - 00:49:09.690, Speaker F: So the way we're thinking about attacking this in DyDX before, and this isn't confirmed yet, is everybody will use the same pool, if you will. On DYDX, they're ordered books, so it's slightly different than like a uniswap pool, but users will potentially have the opportunity to opt into a list of addresses that they would prefer to not trade with. And not everybody has to do this, but if you're like an institution, then that's based in the US or cares about us sanctions for whatever reason, you could opt into the US sanctions blacklist, and I think that's fine because by the nature of these institutions, they're not going to trade with those people anyway. So nothing's really lost from a composability or liquidity perspective, from the protocols perspective. But I think kind of going down more of that path relative to the like, okay, let's just have two totally separate pools is a much better way to do it.
00:49:11.420 - 00:50:25.628, Speaker A: One thing I want to kind of frame a little bit, because I think with Antonio and of course with the folks at AAvE and of course with folks at Hashel as well, you guys are very sensitive to the feeling of regulators breathing down your neck and the reality that, look, they're watching what you guys are doing, and you guys are very attentive to the fact that it feels like there's a one way march of all these regulations toward closing DeFi further and further down until it becomes the highly compliant wasteland that a vitro really wants to bring into existence. Basically, I think if you zoom out a lot away from any of the individuals who are building in DeFi today. Right. The question of default yes or default no really reminds me a lot of what early Internet streaming was asking. It used to be that before the advent of Internet streaming and Internet video, basically, if you wanted to get on television, almost any country in the world, television was default no. Meaning that you need to get the approval of the FCC or different bodies in different countries in order to get something on tv. And you can curse.
00:50:25.628 - 00:50:58.060, Speaker A: There are certain messages you can send that were not for social. There were all these rules that the government enforced about how and what you can say if you want to get airtime. And there was, of course, as there always is a fight when the advent of Internet video came up of like, okay, should this be regulated the same way as tv is? And we got to the answer. The answer we got to was no, because it looks so small. It looks so, you know, whatever some idiots are watching, people jump off, know their rooftops and hurt themselves on YouTube. Who cares, right? This is not a serious thing. Well, now more people watch YouTube than watch tv.
00:50:58.060 - 00:51:25.620, Speaker A: And what happened was that the world moved to default. Yes, because of all of the. Not so much because of the. There's obviously a lot of value that we've garnered from the fact that now media creation is totally permissionless. You can create a twitch stream or create a YouTube stream or put some videos on YouTube, even if it's stupid and nobody cares. The cost to do it is basically zero. But more importantly, the technology pushed us in a different direction.
00:51:25.620 - 00:52:18.964, Speaker A: And I think that's what is going to eventually happen with Defi, is that technology can have a force upon the way that regulation evolves. And I think that's what crypto ultimately does, is that, look, there's a certain charisma to the fact that Uniswap is totally open and free and permissionless, and there's no way to change it. We've thrown away the keys for uniswap. And people look at Uniswap and they think it's even regulators look at Uniswap and they think, wow, that's really cool. I never realized that you could build a totally functioning global marketplace that way. And the charisma of Uniswap, I think, is doing a lot for the space because it's such a simple and vibrant story about what the value is that anybody in the world, and not even anybody, any system, any AI, any machine, can trade anything for anything from anywhere in the world with just a mobile phone. That is such a powerful and compelling story.
00:52:18.964 - 00:52:34.700, Speaker A: I think that's a lot of the reason why Defi has. There's this force behind it that is sometimes hard to tell when you're interacting a lot with regulators. That is going to keep this thing alive, I hope, longer than any particular project or any particular person can keep it alive.
00:52:35.520 - 00:53:23.050, Speaker E: Haseeb, it's also possible that we haven't seen the regulatory activity in this space enough. And in the future, especially uniswap, being a us based firm, might see significant regulatory activity along with the rest of DFI. But for now, I agree that protocols like Ave Uniswap maker, they have done a phenomenal job. And maker recently had a proposal from Coinbase to essentially take some of the money from the treasury, 1.6 billion, invest it in treasury bills. So there is quite a bit of activity on the other side where institutions are starting to sort of work with Dao governance for DAos to invest in Tradfi. So there is another dimension to this whole thing.
00:53:23.980 - 00:53:42.770, Speaker D: So two thoughts on this. So on the default, open versus closed, I also think it'd be great if we could end up in an open world. And I think actually the video argument is a very compelling one, hopefully potentially for regulators as well, because it unlocks a bunch of innovation. And I think the place where this it hits rubber meets road is.
00:53:44.580 - 00:53:44.896, Speaker A: We.
00:53:44.918 - 00:54:56.328, Speaker D: Talk about this all the time internally and with our investors, and sometimes we write about it. It's just like the idea that you now have smart contracts that can custody assets and be a counterparty to a transaction breaks a lot of the existing regulatory model, in my opinion, because that thing doesn't exist inside a jurisdiction. It just lives in the cloud somewhere and it doesn't have a Social Security number and it doesn't have a tin. So what is that thing? And how do you regulate that thing? And I hope we end up in a world where by being default open, that whole sector of innovation can happen, because that's like a new thing. And new things in the world don't happen that often, like the ability for a piece of code to custody assets. Now, that being said, I think the challenge here is going to be that from a regulator's perspective, they may look at the examples of the Internet and actually learn the opposite lesson, which is we really should have clamped down on this stuff much earlier, and therefore, actually we're going to push for this much sooner to be default closed, right? Like, actually you have to be Kyc in order to use this thing, which might sort of prune an entire branch of the innovation exploration tree. But I would hope it can actually be open.
00:54:56.328 - 00:55:40.070, Speaker D: And then the way that we sort of handle compliance is downstream of that, which is if you're ever requested by the FBI and you have a subpoena, then you can prove the chain of history of everything you did. And there was privacy along the way and all that kind of stuff. But I worry a little bit that governments around the world may have learned the wrong lesson from the Internet. And I think it's worth repeating. Like, a lot of this Internet precedent code is free speech, which is like Bernstein versus Department of justice. Some of the DMCA stuff, section 230, which allowed platforms to not have to, after the fact, remove content from their platforms. A lot of these things were set, like, in the early 90s, before 911 happened in the United States.
00:55:40.070 - 00:55:52.950, Speaker D: And so a lot of the sort of norms around this, I think, on the political side may have shifted quite a bit. And so I worry, actually, that we don't end up with an open system, we end up with a much more closed system, just because the environment that we live in is so different today.
00:55:55.280 - 00:56:26.550, Speaker B: Okay, I know we don't have that much time left, and there's so much more to talk about. I want to take this in a different direction. Ultimately, with Defi, we want long term users. Avi, chal, Haseeb, Antonio Varun, I'm sure you've all looked at a lot of data when it comes to Defi, and I'm wondering, how good are airdrops at incentivizing? Know, we see that tokens are distributed, but how many are claimed held sold immediately? How does that work?
00:56:28.840 - 00:56:48.396, Speaker A: The last time I saw data on this was quite a while ago. So I think some of this might be stale. But if I recall, it's something like a third of airdrops are sold immediately, and then, like another ten to 15% are held, and then 50% are just never claimed. I believe that's roughly what it looks.
00:56:48.418 - 00:57:27.370, Speaker F: Like, but it depends what you're trying to incentivize, right? There's different things that a protocol might want to incentivize. And usage is different than maybe call it like, long term alignment or like value generation for token holders, right? Even if the tokens for an airdrop or ongoing liquidity mining program are sold immediately, they're still sort of worth some dollar value to the users of the platform. I, as much as anybody, sort of hope and believe that the users of the platform should ultimately be the owners of the platform too, in the form of tokens. But as much as users don't want to do that. I think that's fine as well, if they can just get the dollar incentives, basically.
00:57:29.020 - 00:58:21.050, Speaker A: That's kind of true, but I think we've gotten to this point, and I have to run in a couple of minutes, but we've gotten to this point where the word user has become so vague that somebody who is playing around with your protocol to try to farm an airdrop, technically they are a user, but they're not providing any value to the network. Right. And so I think what I'd like to see is a world where DeFi is more discriminating about which users deserve to own the protocol and which users don't. And right now, it's just very hard to do because we have these very blood tools, which are airdrops, which I think have really gone down a lot in efficacy over the last couple of years. I think when Airdrops first started becoming a thing, they were tremendously effective. Like Uniswap, Airdrop was a legendary airdrop with respect to its efficacy, its marketing, its buy in, getting the community really excited about Uniswap. And every month I see airdrops becoming less and less effective at the margin just because they get gained more and more.
00:58:22.060 - 00:58:31.404, Speaker B: All right, thank you. And last question. Haseeb, I'll let you go first because I know you have to drop, but what's missing in Defi currently? What do you think?
00:58:31.602 - 00:58:42.368, Speaker A: I think what's missing in defi currently? Love. I mean, there's not enough love in Defi. And music. The music sucks. Can you turn the music back on?
00:58:42.454 - 00:58:44.400, Speaker B: That is why I put the music on for you.
00:58:44.470 - 00:58:47.536, Speaker A: Okay. Awesome. Awesome. You're bringing the love back. This is awesome.
00:58:47.558 - 00:59:02.410, Speaker B: I love the love back. I'm bringing the love back. Haseeb, thank you so much for your time. Avi, chal, ajit, varun and Antonio would love to hear your thoughts on that question. What's missing in defi currently?
00:59:07.020 - 00:59:17.772, Speaker D: Privacy. I think we just need base layer privacy, and we need to push for that. I think there's a lot of goodness that comes from that, and there's a lot of bad stuff that comes from not having privacy. Yeah.
00:59:17.826 - 00:59:38.130, Speaker E: I think there are still too many accidents. Right. So hopefully we can get to a point where especially retail users, money is relatively safe. Of course, we are in a phase of rapid innovation, so some things will happen, but I think every year, if we can have fewer accidents, then we are doing well.
00:59:39.060 - 00:59:58.650, Speaker F: I've been on this train for, like, five years at this point, but I'm going to stay on it for at least the next five years. I feel like D five products just need to continue to improve like ten to 100 x from here, and we just have to realize that that takes time and we're not that close to centralized products for most of them. The stuff at least.
01:00:01.100 - 01:00:41.350, Speaker C: I agree with Antonio here is that I think while it's been ten years, it's still too early. And I think product and user experience is something that's still massively missing, which is also one of the big reasons why it's stopping the mass adoption in many ways. I think the two things I would say that need to be improved is a also one is user experience around how people interact with DeFi and also efficient capital management because there's lots of capital interest, but then the way you allocate capital, move it freely and efficiently is still kind of lacking. So I think those are the two things I would like to see improve in the next few years, and obviously we are working towards that.
01:00:42.840 - 01:01:15.610, Speaker B: Thank you varun. Thank you Antonio, Abichal, Ajit, and of course Husseib, who left us a minute ago. This has been the DeFi state, a weekly show brought to you by hashflow. I've been getting a lot of DMS. Wait, what is hashflow? It's the new RFQ based decentralized exchange protocol. It allows you to trade on any chain and cross chain with no front running and no slippage, which I personally think is super exciting. I'm Nicole Benham, your host, and we will see you next week.
