00:00:00.410 - 00:00:23.946, Speaker A: GM. GM. And by GM, I obviously mean good night if you're in America and if you're in Europe. I don't even know what time it is. Welcome to the DeFi state, a weekly show brought to you by hashflow. Today we're competing with SBF in a Twitter space, so the fact that we even have this many listeners is a huge win to me. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Ben.
00:00:23.946 - 00:01:05.810, Speaker A: I'm the host of this show and head of community for Hashflow. And on this show, we lead discussions with notable speakers, founders, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and generally the brightest minds in the industry to discuss what the future of decentralization will look like. I know I say this every time, but my favorite thing about this show is that every guest is so different and has such different insights on DFI, web three, and the world. If you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you're in the right place. And if you'd like to share this space with your friends, you can click on the arrow at the top right of the space. Copy the link, tweet it out to your feed, text it to your friends. Whatever works.
00:01:05.810 - 00:01:25.000, Speaker A: We have our CEO Varun here with us, and today our special guest is Luigi from Avax. We're going to be discussing the latest and greatest developments with Avax, what it means for hashflow to be part of their defi ecosystem, and much more. Varun and Luigi, how are you?
00:01:26.650 - 00:01:30.300, Speaker B: I am doing fantastic. But, Luigi, you go ahead.
00:01:30.830 - 00:01:36.170, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I'm doing well. This is my third Twitter space ever.
00:01:36.240 - 00:01:38.940, Speaker A: Oh, no, your third space today.
00:01:42.610 - 00:01:44.126, Speaker B: That's a lot of spaces. Today.
00:01:44.228 - 00:01:46.350, Speaker A: That is a lot of spaces.
00:01:47.090 - 00:01:57.630, Speaker C: It's good. It's good to communicate, especially in these type of markets. So excited to be with you all, and big fan of hashflow.
00:01:57.790 - 00:02:13.894, Speaker B: No, I think we've been planning for this for quite some time. Since last year when we did the integrations. I figured the last few months have been like, the growth trajectory on Avax has been phenomenal. So you're like, okay, this is about time you finally do this.
00:02:14.092 - 00:02:29.258, Speaker C: Yeah, looking forward to it. And I've seen recently you guys have really started to do pretty well on avalanche in terms of volume. So congratulations to that. And I'm happy to see that you guys are finding success there.
00:02:29.424 - 00:02:36.320, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I want to start with what's new with Avax. What can you tell us?
00:02:37.330 - 00:03:21.542, Speaker C: Oh, there's a lot, to be honest with you. I'll start with the defi side. We have a lot of native avalanche builders that are innovating in big ways. We have a lot of dapps deploying over the next, I'd say four to five months. A few of the things that in particular I'll just point out real quick, is like Trader Joe launched their liquidity book, which is a concentrated liquidity decks. So that's like a competitor to univ three, but with some different bells and whistles. We have platypus, which is a stable swap, launched a stable coin while they announced their stablecoin.
00:03:21.542 - 00:04:08.342, Speaker C: We have a lot of different of these native avalanche builders that maybe some people who have been mainly in the ethereum ecosystem haven't really had a chance to kind of try out and test. And they've been doing really well. That's on the defi side. But in terms of the network as a whole and things that are going have. Avalanche is a network of networks, right? So architecturally, you could think of it as something in between Polkadot and Cosmos. And one of the very important components of the architecture is what we call subnets and avalanche. We recently announced that we deployed elastic subnets and what that allows for is like permissionless validation of a subnet.
00:04:08.342 - 00:04:41.800, Speaker C: And that's really cool, really cool. And we're really looking forward to see this proliferate. We had a few announced today and we kind of believe that the app chain thesis will really hold. And with that said, there's going to be a need for things like hashflow that can plug in and play with all the different use cases that are going to need their own chain. Some of those are enterprise, some of those are gaming, some of those are defi. And it's going to be really interesting to see it play.
00:04:46.810 - 00:05:15.520, Speaker B: I was going to ask you there. I think many people here may not have enough context on what subnets are and how it works, but I think that would be great to do, like maybe a little bit of a deep dive into how subnets work. And how are they different than say setting up a cosmos chain or setting a polka dot chain? Because I think that'd be a good place to start just to give a quick Tldr primer of what subnets are and what sort of benefits.
00:05:15.890 - 00:05:59.050, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, we'd be happy to. So what is a subdem? Okay, well, we should back up like avalanche has what's referred to as the primary subnet, which is it consists of the c chain, which is the chain that if anybody has ever interacted with avalanche, that is likely the chain you have interacted with. That's where hashflow is deployed, that's where AAve is deployed. All these other apps that you might know of. So that is the primary network. And the validators of avalanche, like all 1300 or 1400 of them all, must validate the primary network. That is a requirement.
00:05:59.050 - 00:06:59.678, Speaker C: Now, in addition to that, avalanche has this notion of subnets. So what is a subnet? If you really just take a step back, all a subnet is, is any combination of the 1400 validators that agree that they want to go validate something. So let's say that 100 of the 1400 validators in the primary network want to go validate, I don't know, some gaming subnet or like, let's call it Warcraft subnet. At that point in time, what they have is effectively they've agreed to validate a chain or a combination of chains, right? A subnet can include many different chains if you wanted to. Now, what else can a subnet be? Well, avalanche is a low level protocol, so it can be a lot of things. It can be its own virtual machine. It does not have to be EVM.
00:06:59.678 - 00:08:16.006, Speaker C: It can be rust based, right? Could be like WaSM, or can be like Solana VM or move VM. Or you could write your own virtual machine if you like. So it's very customizable from that standpoint. So that's one way you can customize it. The other way you can customize it is you can customize how permissioned or permissionless it is. So if you want it to be permissioned for regulatory purposes or you're doing something for your own company, and you need to ensure that only certain people can submit transactions, and there's all different stuff you need to play with there, then you can do that. So effectively, if you really zoom out, a subnet is a way for you to have your own blockchain, but it allows for a lot more than just that, right? Because you have the requirement that any validator of a subnet must also validate the primary network, you're also ensuring that those validators are doing extra work in terms of validating the primary network, which actually has activity, right? And that's the p chain and x chain.
00:08:16.006 - 00:09:56.650, Speaker C: So in the future, all these subnets will have the potential to actually communicate with each other as well. That's something that is under development by Ava labs. It's a way to pass arbitrary messages between subnets, and that will effectively be something like an IBC, but much different because of the architecture differences, but will allow for sort of this trustless communication amongst subnets. So the differences between Cosmos zones and avalanche subnets, if you really take a step back, is, I think that really cosmos provides an SDK rather than this much more of an umbrella network where things are interconnected and there are requirements within their network to actually do things. If you want to set up a cosmo zone, like ten people or ten validators can just do that, but there is no requirement that they also have to validate something else, so you don't really get any shared validation security. And the other component that's a little different is the consensus. So Cosmos leverages something called tendermint, which is a classical consensus, so super fast, been around since like the 1960s or 70s, but can't really scale past like 100 and 5200 nodes.
00:09:56.650 - 00:10:45.690, Speaker C: Avalanche consensus is really what was invented out of Cornell University with Emmingcier, the founder and fuse PhD students. And that is third ever novel consensus protocol. It allows for subsecond finality and scaling past tens and thousands of nodes. And so the reason for the difference in architecture choice was really because the consensus actually enables it. Right. We wouldn't be able to have this primary network requirement that you have to validate the primary network in order to validate subnets if our primary network wasn't able to hold and accommodate so many validators. So I'll take a pause there because it's pretty nuanced.
00:10:46.670 - 00:11:16.710, Speaker B: Know, I think this is actually really good information. I had some follow up questions there, actually around the validators. Let's say Hashro were to deploy on Avax subnet. How do we decide to pick the validators? Do we contact the avax? What's the process like? Or do we have to identify the validators? Or do they just volunteer and be like, hey, I like hashed us, I'll validate here. So what's that process like?
00:11:16.860 - 00:11:58.210, Speaker C: Great question. So there's two ways to do it. There are permission chains. Like I said before, if Hashl, for some reason wanted something permissioned, it could effectively create its own subnet and then determine the weights of the validators that came. So let's say you wanted to do some consortium blockchain where, I don't know, like hashflow, avalanche, ethereum, polygon, all validate the chain. You would determine the weight of every single one of those different chains. So I'm guessing you're not really super excited about that version of it.
00:11:58.210 - 00:12:57.700, Speaker C: The other version is elastic subnets, which is a subnet whereby you have your own, like cash flow has its own staking token for the blockchain and its own gas token. And effectively the way it works is the validators would stake the token, let's call it, I don't know, hashflow, token, stake, hashflow, token, whatever the requirement is. Just like if you want to validate avalanche or ethereum or polygon or something like that, and they can come and go as they please. So effectively what you need in order to attract validators are actual economic activity. No dissimilar than an l one today. Right? People aren't going to validate avalanche if there's no rewards to do so. So you can incentivize this by token inflation, which is the way most l ones incentivize staking right now.
00:12:57.700 - 00:13:21.786, Speaker C: Like Maddox has staking rewards, avalanche has stake rewards. Ethereum two has inflation, even though it's combated with fees. So you can have inflation. You could also pay transaction fees to the validators. So yeah, effectively that's how you would get validators. There's economic incentive.
00:13:21.978 - 00:13:49.122, Speaker B: Got it. Essentially, you're basically creating it. You've provided a framework for anyone to start their own blockchain. And then you also provide existing validator set that can actually just combust. You don't have to search for it and you have to build the entire thing. Because these participants are already securing avalanche, they are more likely to be incentivized to secure a useful application on the network. They can volunteer for economic.
00:13:49.186 - 00:13:50.054, Speaker C: That's right.
00:13:50.252 - 00:14:26.290, Speaker B: Got it. And a question there then. I think there was another chain, I think last week, a couple of weeks ago, I was talking to Eric Wall. He was mentioning Celestia and I think I was curious if you had a chance to look into that. And then how do you compare? Because I think they had a model where they said their main celestial chain is primarily used for data storage. But then all the execution happens on roll ups, basically in a subnet case. Does everything happen on the subnets or do you still interface with the main C chain in some capacity?
00:14:27.430 - 00:15:00.300, Speaker C: It really depends on the use case. I think it's a lot more flexible of an architecture. You can, if you want to, like let's say you want to have a ten validator subnet because you don't really care about security that much. You could leave all the liquidity that you need on the C chain and through the arbitrary messaging protocol it's going to be deployed, be able to trustlessly access liquidity on the C chain. That's entirely possible if you want to do that. Celestia, as I understand it.
00:15:04.290 - 00:15:19.266, Speaker B: I was going to add one more thing there. I was going to say more broadly speaking, maybe if you can compare and contrast how roll ups work, or the security model of roll ups versus subnets, I think that could be interesting too. Or side chains rather.
00:15:19.448 - 00:16:07.170, Speaker C: Sure. So roll ups are kind of. I mean, there's a lot of different types of roll ups in particular, but in general roll up, what it does is it shares some security, some portions of the security with whatever chain it's rolling up to, meaning that you should be able to access your assets if there's ever an issue with the roll ups. And it basically takes execution off chain and batches it together and submits it back on chain in batches, that's effectively what it does. Whether it uses a ZK proof to do that or an more optimistic version. Those are two different paths to do that. Subnets are different in the sense that subnet is its own blockchain.
00:16:07.170 - 00:16:44.286, Speaker C: It has its own validation, it has its own state. Right. And so what are the trade offs here? Well, there's a few. So trade offs for something. If you do not have an application or a use case that generates real economic value, it's going to be hard to have a true subnet that validators want to validate. I think that's perfectly reasonable statement. And so you could have an l two in that state.
00:16:44.286 - 00:17:37.614, Speaker C: Now the difference where there's some trade offs here is l two s have other types of issues that maybe subnets don't like. For example, on an optimistic roll up you have these things that are like sequencers that are the ones that submit the batches to the main chain. And those are at least today they are completely centralized in the sense that usually whoever deployed the roll up is the one deploying the proof. So that's not really ideal because you basically have one entity ordering the transactions. And that's not, I think, why anybody came into this space. So in the future, I think the idea and the goal is for them to have some more decentralized sequencers. And that sort of opens up other types of issues, right.
00:17:37.614 - 00:18:21.900, Speaker C: Because now there's more economic rent extraction, right. Somebody's got to pay for the decentralized sequencing. Not really different than a blockchain in a lot of ways. So there is another layer of economic rent that has to be paid. So it does share some of the issues that I mentioned before with subnets. I think that also in the centralized sequencer realm, from a regulatory perspective, I think that could be an issue because there is a central actor deciding which transaction goes first and doesn't. So that's something that's pretty bad for DFI, I would guess.
00:18:21.900 - 00:19:46.134, Speaker C: If you had asked me which use cases l two s are good for, I'd say, like things that, generally speaking, ordering of transactions isn't super important. So maybe like a game or something like that, but something like DeFi. If we were to create something like hashflow or an exchange where you were trading stocks, for example, and the ability to order transactions was something that could make you a lot of money, you wouldn't really want to do that on an l two is my guess. The other issue, at least for optimistic roll ups, is the finality is super long, the true finality. So I think it's for some of them, seven days. So if you submit a transaction and you feel like it's confirmed, it's not ever truly confirmed until the optimistic window passes, when somebody could submit a fraud proof or validity proof, I think it is. So in that sense, I liken l two s to like writing a check, whereas on a subnet, especially with avalanche consensus, when that transaction is submitted and confirmed in a second or less, that transaction is done, there's no changing it.
00:19:46.134 - 00:20:10.320, Speaker C: And so this is more like cash versus like paying with a check, right? Because one can bounce and one can't effectively. So for finance in particular, I think it's a concerning architecture, and because this is a Defi podcast, I figured that was something worth mentioning. Those are some of the differences, I guess.
00:20:10.930 - 00:21:26.498, Speaker B: Thank you so much. I think many people had those questions in the past, which is also why I was just keeping asking the simple questions, just to see if we can get to the crux of it. But this has been really helpful. I had a follow up question on those again, since we've been discussing the Defi trading activity, and obviously one of the ideas, this has been something we've been discussing internally at hashlow as well. And I think it came about it's the on chain order books, especially given the events of the past four weeks, that has become even more relevant on can we build order books that are more transparent, decentralized? Because in one way to think about it is order books are the best place for price discovery. But at the same time, building on chain order books is really difficult, primarily because of the scalability issues that it presents at the l one layer. But I was curious, actually, that if you were to go back, let's say, building an order book on subnets, what does the scalability look like and what kind of granularity does a subnet offer in terms of if you were to say customize and say some transactions cost gas fees and others don't.
00:21:26.498 - 00:22:21.110, Speaker B: Can we do something like that? And more specifically, what I'm talking about is if you're running a central limit order book, usually you want the users to pay for transactions that result in the exchange of value, right. When you do the swap, it makes sense to pay for fees on that transaction. But if you're simply just posting an order but then canceling it, but not actually executing that, maybe not charging any fees for that makes more sense. Which kind of incentivizes more people to actually place more bids and asks without worrying about paying fees for every transaction. Right. And I'm wondering if that's sort of thing that can that be done on a subnet where we customize where some transactions are charged with fees and others are not. But also just curious about what does the scalability look like in the subnets? Because I think in many order books they look for like a millisecond finality when you're running cent plus limit order books.
00:22:21.110 - 00:22:25.770, Speaker B: And I'm curious if that's something you think can get sheepnets.
00:22:26.670 - 00:23:00.214, Speaker C: Yeah, good question. I'll take the first one up front. So that is possible. And I think one of the most underexplored areas of blockchains in particular in subnets, is like these custom virtual machines. The ability for you to achieve true scale and true speed and customizability is within your ability to write your own virtual machine tailored for just your use.
00:23:00.252 - 00:23:00.840, Speaker B: Case.
00:23:03.130 - 00:23:54.870, Speaker C: I think a few guys on our team released some spec virtual machines. Patrick O'Grady is our VP of engineering, releases what he called like the spaces VM. This is like a very simple key value store custom virtual machine that made storing various pictures or things like that super fast, super seamless, and without any issues that the EVM would have here. Right? So this is entirely possible. There's other things you could do too with, like you could use pre compiles directly in the virtual machine for the EVM, right, in your subnet. And there's some tinkering you could do there that could give you some added flexibility and also things of where some addresses could send certain transactions and others could. That's all stuff you can customize.
00:23:54.870 - 00:24:43.058, Speaker C: But I think if you're talking about the scale that you're talking about, you're never going to do that with the EVM. It's not built for that effectively, right? Yeah, I think it's possible. I know some teams that are researching this and working on these custom virtual machines. None for a collab directly, so the space is yours. I know others that are looking at it for like Oracle directly in the virtual machine and special types of perps and stuff like that. So that's exciting in terms of the millisecond thing. The reality is that no blockchain will ever be faster than a centralized server.
00:24:43.058 - 00:25:17.762, Speaker C: That's just impossible. It's important to take note of that. You have to achieve consensus. So by default, there's no way it will ever be faster than one server reading and writing. Right. But I do think we can, and I do think it's okay not to have a millisecond. A lot of the millisecond games are because many people are trying to front run and do interesting things and game theoretics of that kind of stuff.
00:25:17.762 - 00:25:32.230, Speaker C: So subsecond finality and really boosting your virtual machine, I think, is enough to get you what you need in a decentralized exchange that is fit for adoption. Fit for mainstream.
00:25:34.090 - 00:25:57.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's quite helpful because that's kind of what's looking at is essentially if we have this ability to customize or define our own VM parameters. So basically, I guess what I'm hearing is, if you want to build a clob right now, there is opportunities out there to be claimed in terms of we'll just have to build a VM that is designed to support a clob. And I think that could be interesting.
00:25:57.924 - 00:26:22.470, Speaker C: We do have a clob subnet deploying in the next month or so. It will be EVM based to start. It's called dexalot. It's going to be super cheap, super fast. It's going to be good. But I'm just saying, if you want to achieve the type of scale you're talking about and competing with something like Nasdaq and stuff like that, you need your own custom virtual machine.
00:26:22.890 - 00:27:10.230, Speaker B: Got it. No, I think that makes sense. Again, I'm not sure if in the short term that's like a big necessity, but perhaps in the long term, as we bring in on what more users into just deFi, broadly, that could be something that could be interesting. I think the baby steps at a time till you get to that. So I think, switching gears a little bit, I think, Nicole, maybe you want to ask this about, but I think regarding NFT marketplace, I think there's been a bunch of talk. I mean, I think we've been talking about Hashworce for quite some time. There was an interesting proposal on the hashwarsk or hashlow governance around running hashwarse as its own subnet.
00:27:10.230 - 00:27:52.718, Speaker B: And I think one of the obviously the benefits of doing that is that again, you have your own chain and you get to do more interesting things with it. And you can scale NFts far more than running it on a l one. Right. Which could get congested and so on. But on the other hand, I think one of the big criticisms was there hasn't been any big marketplace on Avax for NFTs at the moment or the biggest ones like Opensea and Magic Eden do not have Avax support. I was curious if you guys actually have any interesting platforms that you think are upcoming or if you're going to be integrating with Magic Eden or OpenSeA.
00:27:52.894 - 00:27:57.000, Speaker C: Opensea just deployed, so you're solved there.
00:27:57.690 - 00:27:58.390, Speaker B: That's good.
00:27:58.460 - 00:28:29.280, Speaker C: We also have Joe pegs, which is a recent deployment from the Trader Joe team. It's a pretty cool marketplace. There's also campfire, which is like community type one and been. There's actually a little bit of an NFt scene starting to pop off on Avalanche. There's a pretty organic community here in general. So I think that it's actually a pretty good opportunity for NFT projects to come here.
00:28:30.130 - 00:29:11.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I was going to ask you, is that the plan you guys had in terms of subnets and targeting the NFT crowd or were you more focused on Defi applications? I think the narrative I've been hearing is Solana has won the NFT game and then Ethan Avax likely will be competing for Defi Mindshare and so on. I was curious exactly. And then I think Mr. Labs is about to release three and they've been focused on gaming and such. So I was curious exactly who is Avalanche right now appealing to? Or what's the crowd you guys think is being drawn towards avalanche the most? Or what are the most interesting applications that you're seeing?
00:29:16.530 - 00:30:04.190, Speaker C: We've actually had a lot of gaming traction because of subnets. Like games want to customize their environment. They need a lot of throughput. So I think that the ability for applications to deploy their own environment have their own token as staking and gas token being able to customize is really attractive them. We announced a few games already, like Shrapnel is aa game. Like, check out the trailer video. They're deploying their own subnet and that thing is very legit, very exciting game, AAA rated.
00:30:04.190 - 00:30:09.470, Speaker C: There's that one. Yeah, definitely. Check it out. It's really cool.
00:30:09.620 - 00:30:10.720, Speaker B: What's the name?
00:30:11.170 - 00:30:12.190, Speaker C: Shrapnel.
00:30:13.010 - 00:30:13.998, Speaker B: How do you spell it?
00:30:14.084 - 00:30:37.270, Speaker C: S-H-R-A-P-N-E-L when a grenade goes shrapnel. And then there's also Gunzilla, which is another one that was just announced today. There's a trailer there. That one I would check out as well. There's a bunch of web two games coming to avalanche subnets as well. I think all that's pretty exciting.
00:30:38.730 - 00:30:45.180, Speaker B: Yeah, that's quite exciting, actually. I didn't realize that there's AA game coming out. Okay. This is actually pretty cool.
00:30:45.870 - 00:31:13.490, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really cool. I would definitely check out the trailer there. We're also pretty excited about a lot of our enterprise and institutional endeavors. We have intane, which is launching their own subnet. That's a asset backed securities, completely regulated subnet. They're going to be issuing true abs on chain, moving from Hyperledger. So that's exciting.
00:31:13.490 - 00:32:06.520, Speaker C: And we've been working on what we refer to as our institutional defi subnet, which is a subnet where KYC is done at the chain level and Dapps can deploy, but there's assurance that all the users have been KYC'd on the chain. So this will allow for new institutions to bring liquidity into defi that previously couldn't get over the regulatory hurdle. So it'll be a new environment there. We think that's going to be pretty unique and the first step towards getting true institutional adoption and true financial rails developed with blockchains. So that's exciting. We have a lot of enterprises that are deploying like loyalty points type subnets, which should be announced shortly. So those are really exciting as well.
00:32:06.520 - 00:32:08.840, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:10.810 - 00:32:52.100, Speaker B: This is amazing. I was going to ask you actually wanted to double click on the KYC or regulate institutional subnets? And when you mentioned they do on chain KYC, could you add a bit more color to how that works? The sense that does a user, who do they KYC with? Is it with the validators? Where is the information stored? Or how does that work? And then what does the application need to do? Like for example, if hashflow wants to run a institutional KYC subnet, let's say, I'm assuming that we don't need to actually KYC the users because they are being KYC'd on chain by some other entity. So just curious what that mechanism of flow looks like.
00:32:54.550 - 00:33:40.420, Speaker C: Yeah, there's numerous ways you could do it, really. You could integrate just a regular third party centralized KYC layer that massive institutions are interested in and just put in a pre compile that effectively has an allow list so the address can't execute a transaction on the chain. Unless it's past that KYC. So that's something you can do in a subnet, or there's verifiable credentials you could deploy directly into the virtual machine. That's an option as well. You can really customize how you want to do it. But I do imagine that this is something that I know we all don't want it, but this is something that will be needed and will happen.
00:33:41.910 - 00:34:23.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'm on the same boat as you are in the sense that generally I'm a fan of whatever simplifies the UX the most. At the same time, I'm also don't want to do double the work. I think one interesting idea was if many of the venues and other people are already running some kind of a KYC service and they can issue these NFT style passports that could be used to just get the proof of KYC as opposed to every application tonic KYc that uses that could be interesting. But at the same mean there's also this ideological debate around why KYC is bad. I don't want to take a stance on that just yet.
00:34:23.240 - 00:35:01.290, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't either. But I also have a rule not going to jail. Generally speaking, I'm trying to grow the space. I think there's people who are trying to change the regulatory regimes, and I really much applaud that. But that's not where I'm focused right now. I'm focused on how do I get more people to use this stuff? And it's just pretty hard for centralized entities like asset managers and stuff like that to use this without any KYC.
00:35:01.870 - 00:35:51.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the good thing is having some kind of on chain identity verification is actually a good thing because from a market maker perspective, they're able to give you better quotes knowing that they don't need to worry about toxic flows from the other side. So it's actually got some positives too, due to knowing who the counterparty is. And if you're doing more interesting things like lending and so on, and if you want to do things like not requiring 200% collateral to lend your assets, it's probably interesting to have some kind of a verification to eliminate that risk or default risk. So in which case I feel like almost some kind of on chain identity verification is paramount for things like that. But again, I think it's still a little too early to predict, but at the same time kind of optimistic about how this shapes up.
00:35:52.144 - 00:35:58.960, Speaker A: I have another question to take it in a different direction, if that's okay. Unless Veron did you have a follow up question?
00:35:59.490 - 00:36:10.946, Speaker B: I don't have follow up questions. I think, in fact, I've asked most of my questions, so feel free to take it over or give some time back of it either way.
00:36:11.128 - 00:36:42.800, Speaker A: Okay, so my question is, what's like your plan to reach users that don't really know anything about DeFi or blockchains and stuff like that? Because even with DeFi, it's like I didn't even learn about Defi until I got into nfts, you know what I mean? That was the thing that onboarded me and made me curious about DeFi. So what's the plan to target the user that knows nothing about any of this?
00:36:43.410 - 00:37:26.266, Speaker C: That's a great question. I would say that as the infrastructure layer and as the chain, I think our audience is more developers. AWS doesn't really reach out to users and say, hey, come use applications that use AWS as their infra. It's more like Uber is deployed on AWS and Uber gets customers. So here we kind of think of it. We obviously have a community, and we obviously focused on growing that community. But in a lot of ways, for DeFi to grow, we need to see more innovation and we need to see more retail user products.
00:37:26.266 - 00:38:33.262, Speaker C: Frankly, lending protocols are cool. Swapping is really cool, but we haven't seen any DeFi. I think innovation that my dad would use, there's just no reason for that yet. It's still pretty niche and still pretty much for the advanced user. So the question in my mind has always been, and I don't know the answer to this, frankly, but the question in my mind has always been, will retail use Defi only as a means to interact with more retail type applications like gaming and NFTs and stuff like that. So will it be the top of the funnel for all of crypto? In which case that's still very bullish, because effectively that's fees and transactions and all that fun stuff. Or will defi be more institutional in nature? Meaning like how finance is right now, certain people have ameritrade accounts and they trade stocks and stuff like that, but the majority of the volume going through exchanges during the day is from market makers and professional traders and OTC stuff.
00:38:33.262 - 00:39:23.220, Speaker C: So I do think there will be this reality where DeFi, most of the volume runs through from more institutional and larger players, and then the rest of DFI will facilitate the web three ecosystems and economies. So that's kind of how I think about it. I don't think there's a killer app that brings a billion people into Defi. I think it's more like a slow burn. And the coolest thing, I think that was born was a stablecoin. I think that was probably the best use case created so far for and especially outside the United States.
00:39:24.870 - 00:39:29.460, Speaker A: Yeah, no, the stable coins were great for us. Thank you. That's a great answer.
00:39:30.950 - 00:39:34.260, Speaker C: I don't know if it is or it isn't, but that's all I got.
00:39:35.050 - 00:40:14.980, Speaker A: I do think other applications and other innovations need to. It's really worked know for retail and stuff like that. I definitely think that's where it's headed and that's what I'm seeing in the NFT space as well. So that's what a lot of people are working on and a lot of people are talking about that. And a ton of companies that I've advised are also thinking of ways to integrate with the space. So I think you're on the right track with that.
00:40:16.630 - 00:40:32.760, Speaker C: Yeah, we have a long way to go, but I think we've also made incredible progress over the last few years. The last bear market was so brutal, there was nothing to do on chain. So I think this is so much more exciting. At least there's things to do.
00:40:33.370 - 00:40:58.318, Speaker B: That's a good thing. Despite all these setbacks, I think that the excitement around building new stuff and the innovation hasn't stopped. And I think that's what makes me really excited about what's to come in the next few years. Crypto is here to stay, basically. Again, it's like success comes to those who are patient. I think in crypto it applies even more. But I think it's going to be fun next few years.
00:40:58.318 - 00:41:00.160, Speaker B: I'm quite looking forward to it.
00:41:01.170 - 00:41:01.920, Speaker C: Same.
00:41:03.810 - 00:41:16.274, Speaker B: But dude, thank you so much for joining us on this space. I think that's all from my side. Nicole, if you have anything go on. Otherwise I'm ready for the mean.
00:41:16.312 - 00:41:32.150, Speaker A: Yeah, that was a great conversation and I don't have any further questions, but if there's anything that you want to mention, Luigi, or anything you want to draw attention to, this stage is yours.
00:41:32.310 - 00:42:18.086, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I'll just bring up two quick. We have Alva Labs developed, I guess two products effectively that I think are interesting for people to check out, especially in these markets. So one of them is BTC B. This is a bridge that avalanche deployed from the bitcoin blockchain directly to avalanche. And then layer zero now enables that BTCB to go from avalanche to all other chains. What's cool about this asset is I know last weekend everybody saw what happened with rapbitcoin, WBTC, which sort of has like a different model, right? It de pegs certain times when markets get nervous because there's no on demand redemption mechanism. That can happen whenever you want.
00:42:18.086 - 00:42:52.450, Speaker C: And BDC B is decidedly different because you can bridge your bitcoin to avalanche whenever you want, whatever size, in a more permissionless type manner. So check that out. There's some pretty cool yields on it. And it's just a different form of bitcoin. And the other product which I kind of mentioned briefly was core, which is a wallet that avalabs built. It's available on all EVM chains, but really is being built and tailored for subnets as well. So really cool UI and Ux experience.
00:42:52.450 - 00:43:02.040, Speaker C: And you could bridge directly in the wallet side. Check that out. Then, you know, if anybody has any questions for me, they could always shoot me a DM. I have my dms always open.
00:43:03.130 - 00:43:31.166, Speaker A: Luigi, if you look at the top of the space, or actually everyone who's listening, I pinned a tweet about core and a tweet about BTC B. Thank you. Oh, yeah, of course. That's why. Yeah. You know, I just know people to have a little more context and if they want to read about it, they can read about it. And so I pinned it.
00:43:31.166 - 00:43:41.502, Speaker A: Luigi, thank you for coming to the space Varun, as always, my favorite co host. This was great, and we will see you next week.
00:43:41.556 - 00:43:51.650, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you guys so much. Really enjoyed it. That's.
