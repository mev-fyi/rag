00:00:01.530 - 00:00:40.482, Speaker A: Good morning. And by that, I obviously mean GM. Welcome to the state of Defi, a weekly show brought to you by hashflow. I'm your host, Nicole Benham. For those of you who don't know me, I am the head of community for hashflow and the host of this show and also the leader of the Hash gang cult, which we'll get into later today. We have with us Varun, also known as Gandalf the Brown, our CEO. We also have with us Ajit, who is a strategic advisor at Polygon, who is assisting the institutional and Defi teams.
00:00:40.482 - 00:01:16.274, Speaker A: Ajit has devoted the last seven years to building bridges between Tradfi and crypto. This includes building banking and payment rails for binance ants and Paxful, advising crypto startups, driving the build out of the fintech practice for consensus, and building the UK blockchain business for PwC. He's also the crypto co host of Breaking Banks fintech podcast and a columnist for Coindesk. Welcome, Varun. And welcome, Ajit. What's up? How are you guys?
00:01:16.472 - 00:01:18.520, Speaker B: Thanks, Nicole. It's great to be here.
00:01:19.610 - 00:01:30.694, Speaker C: Thank you, Nicole. It's always a pleasure to be here to talk to you guys in the hash gang. I think I'll have Ajit steal the limelight today. All the spotlight is on you, mate.
00:01:30.822 - 00:01:32.460, Speaker A: You'll have what?
00:01:35.390 - 00:01:38.074, Speaker C: I'll have Ajit steal the moment this time.
00:01:38.272 - 00:02:12.550, Speaker B: Well, I'm an investor in hashflow, and it's in my best interest to steal hashflow as much as possible. I've been avoiding the spotlight for a bit, but it's really great to be here and sync up with you guys on what's going on in Defi, especially in the polygon ecosystem. I think you guys just crossed a billion dollars in volume on hashflow, on trading volume on hash flow on the Polygon network. So that's pretty awesome. Congratulations.
00:02:13.610 - 00:02:14.470, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you.
00:02:14.540 - 00:02:16.278, Speaker A: Really exciting. Thank you.
00:02:16.444 - 00:02:44.400, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty cool. It's bear market and you guys are growing. I've seen that in the past, things that I was at Aave and consensus and been in the Ethereum community for the last eight years, seven years now. So I've seen that things that tend to grow in the bear market tend to do exceptionally well in bull market. So congratulations and Nicole, welcome to the hashflow team. How long have you been with hashflow now?
00:02:45.110 - 00:02:52.100, Speaker A: Thank you. I would say a little over a month. How long has it been?
00:02:53.670 - 00:02:57.960, Speaker C: If you're counting the time we went to cheesecake factory, then I think it's been like over six.
00:03:01.290 - 00:03:14.300, Speaker A: Thing. That's the thing. I was friends with them first and then I came on. But yeah, if you count that, if you count our friendship, then it's been quite some.
00:03:16.750 - 00:03:54.360, Speaker B: So I've been talking to Varun for a while. I've been following you on Twitter and I've seen your social media profile. I think it's great to have you on the team. And I'll buy a lot of hashflow tokens in the secondary whenever they come out, because now you guys are a full team and it's really going to be pretty amazing. So without much ado, I think let's do this as a back and forth. I'll ask a bunch of questions about hashflow and then you can ask me whatever you want to ask me. And then I think maybe some of our community can also come in and ask any questions.
00:03:54.360 - 00:04:05.980, Speaker B: So let's get started. First of all, Varun, what is hashflow and how is it different from the other products that are out there in the market? What gap are you trying to fill?
00:04:06.350 - 00:05:01.338, Speaker C: All right, I'll start with the most boring way to define hashflow. I think the most simplest way to put it is VRA decentralized exchange protocol. The way it works is by connecting market makers or professional market makers to take us via defi native RFQ system. RFQ meaning request for quotes. What this means for the end user is anybody can trade without slippage and they will have full protection against mev and front running, and they can trade any kind of asset class that is not just limited to spot, which is something that is not quite possible if you go the amm route, primarily because pricing is handled on chain. So by moving pricing off chain, you're able to build a much better price execution engine, which will be far more superior than anything you can do on chain, basically.
00:05:01.424 - 00:05:35.560, Speaker B: I see. I'm assuming that most of a lot of our community here today or otherwise, are not very active traders or don't come from tradfi like me. An Amm is an automated market maker, right. Which is where you like Uniswap or sushi, where you post two sided liquidity. For example, I can post eth us some ETH and equivalent amount of USDC, and then people can buy or sell from this pool where I posted these assets. Is that correct?
00:05:36.410 - 00:06:24.358, Speaker C: Yeah. I think we can take a step back here just to understand what market making means. Right? Or how does price discovery happen in traditional finance or just finance in general? What market makers are responsible for is creating or bringing liquidity to the platforms and for price discovery, a good example is let's take Airbnb as an example. So when you go on Airbnb and you're looking to rent a house or something, you essentially need somebody list these houses. You need somebody at any given time, be able to create these listings so people can rent from those people. If you don't have that inventory, then people can't really use Airbnb. Or even simple example is if you go to a departmental store, then you need someone to bring the inventory there so people can buy things from it.
00:06:24.358 - 00:07:26.614, Speaker C: So that's kind of what market makers do at the order book level, but they essentially create these bids and asks. So anytime anyone wants to go buy or sell assets, your market maker typically acts as a counterparty and makes sure that there's always a buy or a sell offer available so people can trade seamlessly. Now, what uniswap, or generally amms did is they said, let's not have market makers. Let's instead use a smart contract that does the market making. So what your smart contract does is it takes capital from all the lps and then it uses that to use bonding curve, which is the math formula they use to basically determine the price of the asset. Right? The good thing about this design is anyone can throw in assets in the pool and you'll instantly have a market for that. Now, the not so good thing about this is these may not necessarily be good markets, right? In fact, you need lots of, lots of capital for you to have really good markets for these asset classes.
00:07:26.614 - 00:08:03.670, Speaker C: As you can see, most popular assets on these wallets is basically stablecoins or ethwbTc. The moment you go beyond that, you generally have those markets concentrate on binance or some other venue where there's more liquidity. And the price discovery on these platforms happens through professional market makers. So what we did, essentially, is essentially we bought price discovery to defi by basically bringing these market makers to directly quote on hashlow. So we went the other route that instead of using smart contracts for market making, we decided to plug into your gsrs, the jumps.
00:08:04.570 - 00:08:28.910, Speaker B: Right? So before we go there, right? So I've seen a lot of Twitter jokes and complaints about impermanent loss, and I think this is proving to be quite a useful education session for me and hopefully for the audience as well. So what is impermanent loss and why does it happen on uniswap? And is that something you can solve on hashflow.
00:08:32.610 - 00:08:36.610, Speaker C: By the way, just to make sure? Is there any noise from my end at the moment?
00:08:36.680 - 00:08:43.540, Speaker B: Yeah, there is someone shouting in your background, but the good news is that they were agreeing with you.
00:08:45.370 - 00:08:50.520, Speaker C: Okay. If there's any disturbance, let me know. I'll try to find a different place.
00:08:51.610 - 00:08:52.360, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:54.250 - 00:09:24.846, Speaker C: But going back to impermanent loss, I think generally, il I was telling other people, is basically when you deposit assets in a pool at a certain price, and then the price of that asset moves in a secondary market. But then when you decide to take the funds out of the pool, you may not quite get the same rate that you initially put in the money before. So essentially, this delta over what you deposit may be different from what you get later because of the price. Movement in the market is basically what impermanent loss is. Right.
00:09:25.028 - 00:09:34.514, Speaker B: You might have deposited a million dollars and you might get back $800,000, and that $200,000 is your impermanent loss. But it's not quite impermanent, is it?
00:09:34.712 - 00:10:18.114, Speaker C: It's not, because the assumption is the price will again move back to the original price, and at some point you can take the funds out. But also, if you are more of a long term LP and not someone who is short term, just putting capital to move quickly, then general assumption is you should be okay. But at the same time, I think even more simple way to define impermanent loss is it's a bad trade that you would do as an LP. Basically what you're doing is you're giving your capital to a contract and allowing the contract to trade on your behalf with the taker. Right. And what your smart contract does is it basically creates arbitrage, opportunity for people to trade against its pool at the expense of the LP. And that is basically how amms work.
00:10:18.232 - 00:10:22.050, Speaker A: Varun, can you define arbitrage?
00:10:23.910 - 00:11:01.440, Speaker C: Yeah. Arbitrage is basically when you are, let's say there's two venues that are trading assets, right. And if you see the price of an asset on one venue is different from the price at other venue, that basically creates this delta, which allows people to take advantage of that price differential to buy at a lower price on a venue and then sell it at a higher price on a different venue. This is essentially your arbitrage, where you're looking for opportunities, where there is a price differential on the same asset. So you can buy low and then sell high. That's the simplest way to define it.
00:11:03.490 - 00:11:10.930, Speaker B: Right. So how does hashflow address this problem of impermanent loss?
00:11:13.350 - 00:11:14.802, Speaker C: At the moment, we are.
00:11:14.856 - 00:11:15.970, Speaker B: And to what extent?
00:11:16.550 - 00:11:53.280, Speaker C: Yeah. So most market makers at the moment are using their own capital to manage their books. There is not much of the people putting in assets in the pool. But we do have a public pool model, which we haven't gone full all in on that. We'll probably scale that later down the line, as market makers are more sophisticated to run something like that. But with TLDR is instead of requiring multiple assets, you can think of Uniswap or other Amms as an equity based model, whereby basically you are putting assets in a pool, and then you're buying equity in that pool. Right.
00:11:53.280 - 00:12:50.126, Speaker C: If you bought like 5% of the pool today by depositing 100 ethan thousand USDC, then basically at some point in the future, you're able to take out 5% of that pool. But the assets may not be the same ones. You might get a different asset, or essentially, you might get a different ratio, but up to the value you put in at the beginning. Right. So in our case, what we're doing instead is we get the debt based model, where you essentially lend your capital to the market makers, and then they are using your capital to market make, and then they're also rebalancing the pool as required. So essentially, what you're doing is your market makers are getting credit that they can use to market make, quote, and then every few hours. Or they can basically rebalance the pools, which makes their books far more capital efficient in the sense that they don't need to park lots of capital to begin with to take the risk, and they can manage it much more efficiently.
00:12:50.126 - 00:13:01.640, Speaker C: Right. But the downside, obviously, is that you are basically lending capital to a party. That could actually be risky. That's the risk that comes with it, which is also the reason why we've been more.
00:13:06.970 - 00:13:25.150, Speaker B: Right. And the other thing that people complain about with Amms is the slippage. So what is slippage? And how does hashflow address slippage? Well, did you get the question, or do I have bad.
00:13:25.620 - 00:13:58.264, Speaker C: Sorry, I was muted. I realized that I muted my mic. I think slippage is. Again, I'll just use an example to explain slippage. Anytime the price of the asset changes, as you continue to buy more and more. Essentially, the slippage is the delta between the price you saw at the beginning versus when the code gets executed, the final price you get. So the amount by which the price moved is basically the slippage that you.
00:13:58.462 - 00:14:16.670, Speaker B: Thought you were getting. Ether at $1,700. But by the time you were done, if there was not enough liquidity, then you would get probably $1,750. And that $50 is the slippage. Right. And this is probably a bigger problem for the long tail or low liquidity tokens. Right.
00:14:16.670 - 00:14:32.070, Speaker B: EtH WBTC USDC pairs are probably okay because there's quite a bit of liquidity on uniswap. But what happens to the long tail tokens? Some of the dog coins that I like so much?
00:14:32.440 - 00:14:41.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the dog coins have to kind of be slipping a little too much, so you need a more rough surface for them to not slip.
00:14:42.360 - 00:15:07.410, Speaker B: I mean, there was a joke about the dog coins, right? But I think there are quite a few tokens where there is not too much liquidity on amm. So hashflow, right? How many pairs? So how has the journey been so far? And what's the state of, where are you guys at in terms of partnerships? Liquidity, the number of tokens, the number of chains? Razzle us with the statistics, please.
00:15:07.940 - 00:15:47.980, Speaker C: No, for sure. I think before I do that, let me just close the loop on slippage on why we don't have slippage. So generally, if you look at order books, basically the way the order books work is you have different price levels and each level has inventory associated with it. And if you place any market order, then you buy the first level. Then if you're trying to buy more, then your order gets executed at the second level, then third level, and so on until the entire book is empty. On uniswap. What's happening is when you trade against the curve, the more you buy, the more the price keeps going up until infinity because of the nature of that math formula.
00:15:47.980 - 00:16:42.156, Speaker C: As a result, you see more slippage the more you buy. But then you essentially solve this problem by having lots and lots of capital or inventory in the pools, so that you see less variation in the price as people try to buy more, and the price remains relatively constant. But for long tail assets or anything that does not have as much inventory, you see massive price variations, because, like you pointed, lack of liquidity or lack of. So what Hashla is doing differently is basically we follow the RFQ path, where we basically have custom tailored quotes for every taker. And then once you cryptographically sign that quote, then no matter what happens, this user gets the entire quote at the price agreed upon. It's almost like an OTC trade. So the reason people do OTC trades is to avoid this exact same problem.
00:16:42.156 - 00:16:53.650, Speaker C: And you can think of hashlow as an OTC on steroids so that people can just go request a bespoke quote and then execute that without having to worry about slippage or even front planning and things like that.
00:16:54.580 - 00:17:14.170, Speaker B: Got it. Time to shell. So razzle dazzle. With the statistics, how has the growth been? How has your journey been so far? How many users? How many trades volumes? How many pairs, how many tokens? Just tell us everything.
00:17:16.540 - 00:17:46.792, Speaker C: Absolutely. So far we've launched as a beta last year, or alpha rather, in September of last year, and have traded about nearly 9 billion now. Daily volume is somewhere in the 25 to 30 million range. It's decent. There's obviously a massive room for improvement. There we are on six different EVM chains at the moment. Ethereum, Polygon, Binance and then arbitrary optimism and Avax.
00:17:46.792 - 00:17:57.270, Speaker C: And we just finished trading 1 billion volume on polygon. I think that was a big moment. Why we decided to have this space with you guys, because.
00:17:59.160 - 00:18:02.788, Speaker B: I told you in the beginning that Polygon is where the action is going to be.
00:18:02.954 - 00:18:10.884, Speaker C: I know, yeah. We're going to ask you just to tell us about Polygon as well. What's happening in the Polygon world? Nicole has some questions too, I reckon.
00:18:11.012 - 00:18:16.990, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a ton of questions, but, yeah, start with what's happening in the Polygon world?
00:18:18.080 - 00:18:55.204, Speaker B: What's not happening in the. You know, after Ethereum, Polygon is by far the biggest ecosystem across Defi, NFT gaming and the buzzword metaverse applications, I think. Let's start with gaming. Gaming has been with Ryan Wyatt's theme in Polygon studios. Gaming has been an exceptional success story. I don't have all the metrics on my hands, on my fingertips, but recently we got, like, pretty much 48 of the Terra apps. I didn't know there were 48 apps on Terra, but they all came to build on Polygon.
00:18:55.204 - 00:19:40.170, Speaker B: The team were in Korea recently and the reception was just exceptional. I didn't know that Polygon was such a big brand in Korea, but it turns out that the brand is now pretty global. And the reception of the polygon team, Asif and some of the other guys were there was pretty exceptional. So the growth of the ecosystem globally has been phenomenal. The maximum number of games, there is a huge amount of traffic that's coming from web3 gaming. It's been quite a growth area, sort of, kind of, I think proving Sandeep and Ryan's conviction that gaming will be a massive growth area for web3 applications. Then on DFI, I think our philosophy is quite simple.
00:19:40.170 - 00:20:14.172, Speaker B: We are building the most composable ecosystem. And Hamza, sif and some of the guys in the Hamza leads the Defi team. So they've been essentially trying to get every single app right. So if any innovation happens on Ethereum, it should happen on polygon. And sometimes innovations should happen on polygon when they are easier to do on polygon as opposed to on layer one. That's going really well. I think we've seen some structured products being built on polygon.
00:20:14.172 - 00:20:54.272, Speaker B: There is a very large hedge fund, I can't just name them yet, but they're building a principal protected note on polygon. So this idea of bringing more institutions and bringing more tradfi expertise with the DeFi ethos to create defi applications that make more strategic sense. Just like hashflow, historically, Defi has been a place where people go to earn, farm and dump free tokens. Like liquidity mining was a huge success story. I think compound and Ave did a phenomenal job. So did uniswap. But I think that story kind of lived out a bit.
00:20:54.272 - 00:21:51.212, Speaker B: And then d five 20 came around and Olympus folks and all of these Faye protocol, protocol, controlled value type of narrative didn't really take off. So what we are seeing now is sort of more, I think tradfi expertise come into Defi and start to solve some teething problems around. For example, how to create sustainable yield. We saw time swap. Time swap is a very interesting protocol for borrowing and lending. I think that's something that the audience should look into very closely. But I think more on the tradfi side, structured products, I think there's a fork of ribbon that someone is building and trying to improve on the option strategies.
00:21:51.212 - 00:22:37.244, Speaker B: That's pretty cool. We have seen a team from a hedge fund start to create something quite sophisticated in terms of quantitative strategies. Now, quantitative strategies have leakage or decay in terms of once the market figures out quantitative strategies, then you kind of have to switch to a new strategy. So they're trying to solve a couple of those problems in DeFi on Polygon. So that's the DeFi bit. And then you've obviously seen the NFT launches. There's a whole bunch of DJN nfts, web3, native nfds, corporate nfds.
00:22:37.244 - 00:23:25.710, Speaker B: You saw the Disney announcement, you saw the Macy's announcement, the Coca Cola announcement. There is quite a bit of web two and corporate interest. So in the web two space, Polygon has been winning quite a few inbound and outbound deals, especially in major geographies like the United States. But I think the big story this year is on the ecosystem side. Polygon team have always been known for doing an exceptional job. But this year the story kind of pivoted from just building a great ecosystem to building great technology also. So Polygon acquired Hermes sometime last year, and I think since then, they also acquired Mir protocol and zero.
00:23:25.710 - 00:24:07.944, Speaker B: So all of those are now branded as Polygon Zke EVM. And the goal is to with sort of. The Hermes has come a long way, and they have built the fastest open source proving system for zero knowledge proofs. And what they're trying to do is build fully EVM compatible ZK roll up. Now, that's a huge achievement. That's very hard to do. As Vitalik mentioned in his blog, I think it's quite remarkable that Hermes team, with sort of Polygon's focus and investment, has come such a long way to build a testnet.
00:24:07.944 - 00:24:56.780, Speaker B: To launch a testnet for fully EVM compatible ZK roll ups. It's a huge achievement. And I think what that means is applications like hashflow, Aave, Uniswap maker, whoever, I think all of these apps can essentially be ported onto a ZK roll up sometime next year without too much additional testing or debugging. So there's quite a bit of work to be done on the testing and security of the ZK roll up itself, ZKevM itself. But I think once that's done, then the migration path for defi and other dapps onto the Zkevm becomes painless. That's a huge achievement as compared to competitors like Starquare. You had to kind of learn Cairo, which is an entirely new language.
00:24:56.780 - 00:25:40.372, Speaker B: Then there are other roll ups that have a bit more limited coverage. So you kind of have to, let's say you deploy aave on something, on one of those roll ups, then you have to do a lot of testing, you have to change your code, and then you have to do a full audit from the beginning. And that kind of is a pain for developers and is a major barrier to entry for protocols. But I think with the fully EVM compatible ZK roll up in Polygon ZkVM, it's a massive technical achievement. I mean, I've been looking into the details of how it works, and it's a huge technical achievement. So I think that's the biggest news of the year. Apart from then, there are other projects like Polygon supernets.
00:25:40.372 - 00:26:40.124, Speaker B: I think there will be things like, which are similar to Cosmos zones, if you will. And at some point, what will happen is that Polygon will be a general purpose set of scaling solutions for Ethereum, which means that people who want to deploy app chains don't have to go to Cosmos or something else. They can essentially simply deploy application specific roll ups on Ethereum using a combination of the supernet technology and the ZkevM technology, which is a pretty big deal, right? Because if you can create synchronous and asynchronous composability across these applications, then you've kind of solved the big problem, or a whole set of problems which require multiple trade offs for developers to scale and compose applications across the Ethereum ecosystem. Now that's much harder said than done. I think that's a two year exercise. But the ZkVM is already in Testnet and it should be the big first step. And Supernet should also come out this year.
00:26:40.124 - 00:26:44.072, Speaker B: So huge shifts going on in the polygon core tech.
00:26:44.226 - 00:26:57.588, Speaker A: Ajit, you just answered like ten questions in one breath. Ten questions. Because of how comprehensively you answered the first question.
00:26:57.754 - 00:27:00.070, Speaker B: Thank you, goodbye then. I'm sorry.
00:27:02.120 - 00:27:10.020, Speaker A: Okay, my other question is, how is this different from ZK sync?
00:27:10.840 - 00:27:52.532, Speaker B: Yeah, so first of all, ZK sync's prover technology is not open source, right? So no one really knows what's there or what's not there. I think then Zksync historically haven't been targeting a fully EVM compatible ZK roll up. They started early and I think the technology has come a long way since. And some of the research that the Polygon team have done around plunky two and prover systems has really surprised the market a bit. So Zksync isn't fully EVM compatible, the prover isn't open source. Right. And I think they're very strong team.
00:27:52.532 - 00:27:58.390, Speaker B: So we'll see how ZK sync evolves. But that's kind of the state of the market right now.
00:27:59.560 - 00:28:15.070, Speaker C: By the way, I was going to add, it might make sense to maybe give a quick snapshot of what's optimistic roll up versus a ZK roll up. And why is this even a big deal? Like why having EVM compatible ZK is good? Because wasn't quite possible.
00:28:17.360 - 00:29:02.456, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's start with Ethereum. Ethereum is the winning ecosystem so far. Ethereum is transitioning to proof of stake in two weeks or maximum three weeks. So what that does is essentially it reduces the energy footprint of Ethereum, but it doesn't actually solve the scalability issues. And historically, Ethereum's roadmap has evolved as the technology has evolved, and now the entire focus from a scalability perspective, Ethereum is going to scale through roll ups. Now what are roll ups? So what that means, know at some point Ethereum might offer sharding, which means there are multiple partitioned, which means.
00:29:02.456 - 00:29:55.080, Speaker B: Well, I think there's a lot of. I want to be careful with how many buzwords I throw in here. But Ethereum will scale in two ways. Ethereum in the long term will have sharding, which means there will be multiple partitions of the Ethereum network, which kind of have their own local consensus, so to speak. But in the near term, Ethereum will scale through roll ups, right? So there have been other technologies in the past, like polygon, side chain or plasma or other things, but now the entire focus is on roll ups. Now, what do roll ups do? So when you execute a number of transactions on ethereum, then Ethereum is a shared resource. There is only so much block space or space in the blocks in the blockchain that's available for transaction data and other data to be written.
00:29:55.080 - 00:30:41.736, Speaker B: And there's a lot of compute involved in smart contracts processing all of those transactions. So what roll ups do is they take the workload of entire transaction processing. So all of the compute and some of the data, so a lot of the compute happens on roll ups, which are their own blockchains, right? So roll up is like its own blockchain. It does all of the transaction processing on its own. It handles most of the data, not all of the data, and it processes all of these transactions in batches. So you essentially take a bunch of transactions, create batches, you process all those transactions away from Ethereum. So you take a lot of this workload, right, whether it's compute or data off Ethereum.
00:30:41.736 - 00:31:41.416, Speaker B: And then at the end of all of this, you write a proof to the layer one or ethereum, where you say, look, you can have two types of proofs with ZK roll ups. The proof you provide to Ethereum is that all the transactions were processed correctly and the state of Ethereum, of layer one is being changed correctly. Right? So that's what you call a validity proof. So validity proofs are instant, meaning once the transactions, the batch of transactions is confirmed on Ethereum, then it's confirmed your money is ready to move. You don't have to wait for a few days to move your money, which means it's more capital efficient and so on, so forth, right? So ZK roll ups are kind of the bleeding edge and kind of the final state of scaling Ethereum on L2s. Now, optimistic roll ups are easier to build. It's much easier to achieve EVM compatibility by writing optimistic.
00:31:41.416 - 00:32:31.164, Speaker B: But the reason they are called optimistic is because you kind of say, look, we will assume that the transactions were processed correctly, but if something went wrong, then we'll give people a few days to provide what's known as a fraud proof. So, which means that there was either an invalid transaction or the transactions weren't processed correctly. So optimistic roll ups are easier to write. But the problem is you have to give people a lot of time to provide fraud proofs, which means you can't actually withdraw your money for a few days. There are workarounds for that. So ZK roll ups are much harder to build because they involve a lot of math, zero knowledge, cryptography, scaling technology, whole bunch of computer science. But once they're done, once polygon ZKVM kind of goes live, that's almost the final state of.
00:32:31.164 - 00:32:49.430, Speaker B: Then we can optimize a bunch of things around sequencers. We can optimize a bunch of things around prover technology. There's a lot of cryptography that can be improved, but that's kind of the final state of scaling Ethereum on L2s. Right. So this is a huge step, and that's why it's such a big deal.
00:32:53.240 - 00:33:01.160, Speaker A: Wow. I actually just got a DM from someone who said, can you describe cryptography?
00:33:02.620 - 00:33:41.536, Speaker B: Yeah. Before there was cryptocurrency, there was cryptography. Cryptography has been around since people have tried to pass secrets to each other. So, for example, suppose you want to send one of your colleagues an email without your boss, and the email is about where you're complaining about your boss, but even if your boss sees it, you don't want your boss to realize that they're complaining. Right. You are complaining about. So anyways, Alice and Bob are the two people who are mentioned in every cryptography lecture.
00:33:41.536 - 00:34:29.156, Speaker B: And what they're doing is they're trying to communicate with each other without someone who is kind of overhearing this message and trying to understand what they're saying, being able to understand what Alice is saying to Bob. Right. So Alice is talking to Bob, but she doesn't want Charlie or C to figure out what Alice is saying to Bob. So all of these techniques are considered cryptography. And blockchains are built entirely on what's known as public key cryptography, which means that you have a private key and a public key. Your private key is used for signing transactions, and your public key is used for verifying your transactions. And if someone wants to send you an encrypted message, they can use your public key to encrypt the message, and you can use your private key to decrypt the message.
00:34:29.156 - 00:35:00.060, Speaker B: So encryption and digital signature schemes are kind of in asymmetric key cryptography are essentially mirrors of each other and blockchains are built on it. So now when we say crypto, we generally mean cryptocurrency, but for centuries before there were cryptocurrencies, there was cryptography, and cryptocurrencies are a very small part of the discipline of cryptography in computer science and mathematics.
00:35:01.520 - 00:35:08.556, Speaker A: Thank you, Ajit. I hadn't heard it described in that way. And I didn't know about Alex and Bob either.
00:35:08.738 - 00:35:12.400, Speaker B: Alex and Bob? Yes. Alice and Bob are the most fun people in math.
00:35:14.500 - 00:35:30.420, Speaker A: That's great. I'm never going to forget that one. I wanted to talk about polygon story and what contributed to such a massive success compared to some of the other l two s and side chains in terms of adoption.
00:35:31.240 - 00:36:11.700, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, I've been formally associated with Polygon for the last three or four months, but I've known Sandeep for the better part of since 2020. Jan and I met Sandeep at a binance event where he was talking about Polygon. In that conversation, I said, all right, this is a special founder, so I need to put in a bunch of money in this. And I think I've been very happy for. So Polygon should get a lot of credit. I think a lot of credit for Polygon's remarkable success goes to the founding team, and it's quite a balanced founding team.
00:36:11.700 - 00:37:06.384, Speaker B: Right. So often you see founding teams where you have good engineers but no marketing skills, and then sometimes you see our business dev skills, and sometimes you see teams where there's a lot of shilling capability, but not the ability to build and keep your head down. And sometimes you see all of both of those. As an angel investor, you see both of those, but you don't see the drive for just doing great things and a huge vision for going where things can go. So I think what's really worked for Polygon is really the combination of the technical chops, but also Sandeep's exceptional ecosystem building skills. Also, I think more recently it's been just some remarkable hires. I think Polygon has been very fortunate to have some exceptional individuals from web two join Ryan Wyatt.
00:37:06.384 - 00:37:47.872, Speaker B: I think in Polygon studios, often you see web two people come into web3 and they don't get it. But Ryan was hanging around NFT discord, and he was essentially degenning out, and he was hands on before Polygon found him, he found Polygon. So Ryan has built a great team in studios that's got sort of the right ethos. They understand the web two space and the web3 space, and Ryan in particular. Right, and then joined to work on security. So it's really the people, but I think it's on the founding team. It's just a remarkable drive.
00:37:47.872 - 00:38:31.612, Speaker B: There was a time when Polygon and Xdai were neck to neck. And then I think Sandeep, in his unique, very aggressive, driven, an ecosystem building approach, sort of did this partnership with Aave, and I was at Aave at the time, so that sort of kicked off the entire ecosystem incentive season, which everyone has copied since. So Ave coming to Polygon was a major step in the history of polygon. So I'm quite glad to have been part of that story. And I think we did a lot of testing. We realized that the tech was robust and it was ready to go. Since then, I think the Defi ecosystem exploded.
00:38:31.612 - 00:39:15.372, Speaker B: But the biggest reason for the success of Polygon is really the community, right? And the community is the Ethereum community. So when Polygon, when binance, smart chain and some of the others, Elvins, were essentially stealing a lot of Ethereum's market share because Ethereum was getting too many transactions on uniswap, OpenCnlswear, I think Polygon came in at the right time. And while everyone was essentially shilling this eth killer narrative, right, so avalanche everyone else. Solo nevax narrative and ETH Killer narrative, we're going to kill Ethereum and we're going to do something better than Ethereum. Sandeep and team took a very different approach, and they said, look, we are part of Ethereum. We are Ethereum's bizdev team. We are here to scale Ethereum.
00:39:15.372 - 00:39:49.736, Speaker B: We are committed to Ethereum. So I think what that did is that's given polygon a huge amount of support from the biggest innovation ecosystem in crypto. And that's. And I think that's not just been words. I think polygon. I know Sandeep very well, and Sandeep and the rest of the team have been extremely committed to Ethereum, even sometimes at the cost of polygon. Right? So that's sort of, I think, integrity and just the clarity in terms of knowing where you belong and what your a team is.
00:39:49.736 - 00:39:58.030, Speaker B: And that's really the Ethereum team. I think Ethereum community has backed polygon, leading to exceptional success.
00:39:59.520 - 00:40:18.100, Speaker A: Ajit, thank you so much for that. I wanted to take this in a different direction. You have a background in traditional finance. How do you see the institutional flow of Defi? And also, what's the traditional finance view on DeFi and its developments?
00:40:18.920 - 00:41:20.660, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there is a general, I've been in crypto since. Crypto was purely revolutionary, mostly anarchistic, and 100% djen in every bull market. Last bull market, we saw a lot of tradfi come into crypto. And there was this whole buz about enterprise blockchain and building these consortium systems and building all these private blockchain systems with banks and exchanges and so on and so forth. And this time we are seeing web two, Google, Facebook, Instagram, all these guys come in. And so there is a bit of a mixing of the ethos, right? So part of the challenge when you think about Defi and when I started with Ave and was also looking at Ethland for potential investments at consensus, that was a bunch of young folks djenning out and really trying to start a revolution. Oh, no, KYC, it's going to be completely permissionless.
00:41:20.660 - 00:41:49.504, Speaker B: We don't worry about regulators. So that was the ethos. Whereas in tradfi, the ethos after the financial crisis is we need to ask for permission. Before we do anything, we'll make an announcement that we are launching the digital assets team at this megabank and then we'll see if we actually do anything. Right. So the ethos in Tradfi, the ethos in web two, and the ethos in crypto are actually quite different, but all of these are now merging. So what I think we're getting from.
00:41:49.504 - 00:42:51.472, Speaker B: But a lot of tradfi people are very frustrated, right? I still have PTSD from building blockchains in bank and some very large projects because you kind of crack your head and nothing actually moves. And then even when it moves, then there are lots of people whose jobs are being threatened by the innovation and they try to kill it. I think a lot of tradfi people, people who actually want to make a difference and invent things and create new things, essentially are frustrated and they want to come to. So, because when I was doing SECDB at Goldman, we could make code changes in production just like Defi, and we could innovate, we could create new financial instruments, but after the financial cris, not been the case. So the best people in Tradfi want to work in Defi. And that's bringing a lot of talent and mean. Obviously, there are some challenges in the sense that people tend to worry about some of the risks in Defi.
00:42:51.472 - 00:43:37.644, Speaker B: And I think there are two sides to the freedom in Defi. I think some people, like Ave, have done an exceptional job of using it to innovate and hashflow and other people have kind of done other things with it which don't give the space a great name. But at the same time, what's coming in from Tradfi is a lot of expertise that didn't exist. When you're 24 years old, 25 years old, you probably don't have the deep product knowledge that somebody from a hedge fund after ten years of extensive trading and derivatives trading has. I think we're getting all of that expertise into DFI. And a lot of those people are now working with, partnering with Polygon from inside their firms. Firms like Brevin Howard, firms like SiG, firms like jump Crypto.
00:43:37.644 - 00:44:05.612, Speaker B: There's lots and lots of different firms that are bringing all of these expertise to build lots of very interesting ideas and explore a lot of different ideas. And DeFi is also changing the culture inside those firms because people are essentially willing to experiment. They see the risk, but they also see the opportunity. So I think we're living in very exciting times. But then we also have to prepare for more interest from regulators. I think we saw what happened to Tornado cash. We know what Mr.
00:44:05.612 - 00:44:54.410, Speaker B: Gensler essentially taking a lot of interest in the space. But at the same time, I think what the message from Polygon just hired one of the best lawyers in DeFi, Mark Boyron, as the chief legal counsel. And he and Rebecca Etiquette have worked together for a long time. Rebecca is the general counsel for Aave and these guys, I think, are doing a remarkable job of essentially telling the regulators and the policymakers that, look, Celsius went down, three arrows went down. We've seen all these unstable CFI firms fail, but we've defi blue chip still humming along. So something is very right about this transparent, open system that we're building in Defi. And I think this dialogue is where I spend a fair amount of time as well.
00:44:54.410 - 00:45:02.620, Speaker B: So the future is great, but it's going to go through a bit of a, we have a lot of work to do and it's going to be a very interesting journey.
00:45:03.040 - 00:45:38.600, Speaker A: Well said, Ajit. My last question and I do see a ton of people, I come from the NFT space and I moved over to Defi and my curiosity sort of led me, you know, there are a lot of people who still ask the question, why Defi? What's the incentive for them to move over? And how do you answer that question? If you're talking to someone who knows nothing, doesn't even come from traditional finance world, what do you say to them?
00:45:38.750 - 00:45:55.208, Speaker B: Yeah, because tradfi doesn't work. Right. I come from Tradfi and take my word for it, if you don't take my word for it. Then let's explain why tradfi doesn't work. First of all, tradfi fails regularly. We've seen routine financial crises. Even last year we saw articles fail.
00:45:55.208 - 00:46:18.164, Speaker B: This year we saw Celsius. I mean, these firms are tradfi, right? So if anyone thinks Celsius is not tried fi, I don't know. You just give someone, a banker of your money and then they do whatever they want to do with it. Maybe they were there buying bull runes nfts, as we found out. So that's tradfi, right? There is no transparency in tradfi. You don't know what's happening. You don't know what people are doing with your money.
00:46:18.164 - 00:46:53.184, Speaker B: There is a South park kit that you should watch that came out yesterday. And you give me your money and the money is gone. I think tradfi doesn't work. Most of our tradfi doesn't work for the average individual, right? You could challenge and say, look, so many things go wrong in Defi. But at the end of the day, I think we're building jet engines, we're building an entirely new infrastructure for the global financial system. And it's in its very early days. So when you're innovating at that level, some things can go wrong and we have to build a better system, for sure.
00:46:53.184 - 00:47:25.256, Speaker B: But I think what Defi promises is a few things. One is transparency, right? So everything that happens, happens. So I don't consider Luna, for example, or anchor protocol defi, because Mr. Kwan was making whatever decisions he was making. There was no governance. A lot of things were happening behind the scenes. So transparency and on chain decision making, decentralized governance, community participation in knowing what's being built and how it's being built and why it's being built, that's core to defi.
00:47:25.256 - 00:47:54.980, Speaker B: The other thing is automation. So in tradfi, you have massive costs because tons and tons of things are done manually by people. And then who is paying for it? The customer is paying for it, right? So all of the compliance risk, all of these costs are being paid by you. So I think D five promises automation and a lot of efficiency. The third thing is innovation. I think tradfi, innovation really died after 2010. So now we are starting to see people start to create new things all over again.
00:47:54.980 - 00:48:45.620, Speaker B: And by combining a bunch of technologies, especially blockchain and crypto, with a lot of expertise from tradfi. So there are lots and lots of reasons, but I think if we can create a more efficient and transparent financial system that works for where the costs of both systemic failures, like systemic failures, like three arrows and Celsius, are not just Goldman and Barclays back in the day, have to be paid by the average individual, then I think that's what we are really here for. Now, in the meantime, obviously balancing the realities of all these, some of the attacks and hacks and rug pulls, and making sure we differentiate between responsible innovators and all the others opportunistic folks is really important. But at the end of the day, trackfire doesn't work. That's why we need Defi.
00:48:48.300 - 00:48:56.250, Speaker A: Wow, what a mic drop moment. Varun, is there anything that you want to add to what Ajit has said?
00:48:57.180 - 00:49:10.632, Speaker C: No, I think Ajit gave a pretty thorough summary of everything. I like the line tradfi doesn't work. That's why you have closing remarks.
00:49:10.696 - 00:49:20.050, Speaker B: I have some questions. Sorry. Yes, I have some questions. And Nicole, these are for you. Sorry. Yeah. So, Nicole, what brought you to.
00:49:22.340 - 00:49:53.980, Speaker A: I met. I met Varun a while ago at Chris Dixon's house, and we became friends there. And I didn't know anything about Defi at all or why it was important. I wasn't really trading too much. And I started to use the product and asking questions. And then, it's funny, I showed it to my mom and my mom started using it. She was super impressed.
00:49:53.980 - 00:50:58.896, Speaker A: And I grew closer and closer to Varun and Vinod, and they explained so much to me, not just about hashflow, but about the space and how we're going to move forward and the new developments and things like that. I would say it was my curiosity that led me to this role. And the other thing was, I was a little intimidated by this space at first because I felt like I couldn't really understand it. And so as I started doing Twitter spaces and interviews and talking to people, I would get a lot of messages that were like, hey, this really helped me. Or, hey, thank you for asking that question. I was too shy to ask that. And I noticed that what initially I felt like might have hindered me, or it might have been a setback that I wasn't from the tech world or I have not been in crypto for too long.
00:50:58.896 - 00:51:50.240, Speaker A: That actually gave me an advantage, because that way I was a bridge for people who knew nothing about it. And that's why you can see in the questions that I ask, I'm not just talking to people that have a comprehensive understanding of defi, crypto, blockchain, nfts, any of that stuff. I'm asking questions for people that essentially know nothing or very little, because eventually, as we inch towards mass adoption, those are the people that we want to attract. And so I'm implementing. Yeah, and I'm implementing educational efforts with hashflow and all sorts of stuff, but that's basically my role.
00:51:51.140 - 00:52:20.410, Speaker B: All right. I've never been to Christigson's house, so I hope you guys can take me there one day, moving on from there. You're absolutely right. I think we do need to translate this technology and our products for the average person, and I think it needs to be safe and easy for them to understand. So how do you see the community today, and how do you want to see the community in the next few months? The hashflow community?
00:52:21.120 - 00:52:27.500, Speaker A: I think the community is strong. They obviously ask when token very regularly.
00:52:29.600 - 00:52:34.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm an investor and I was planning to ask.
00:52:34.262 - 00:52:36.530, Speaker A: Were you going to ask? Hilarious. Yeah.
00:52:36.980 - 00:52:38.530, Speaker B: Can the devs do something?
00:52:39.300 - 00:52:46.832, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll pass that message along. I think the community is strong. It can be stronger.
00:52:46.896 - 00:52:47.510, Speaker B: But.
00:52:49.640 - 00:53:10.552, Speaker A: I really just want to bring people together and address concerns and create the sort of culture I see or that I saw months ago in nfts. Like really excited. Kind of a revolution has a culture to it. That type of stuff excites me.
00:53:10.606 - 00:53:37.270, Speaker B: Yeah, we had that in DFI summer in 2020 where everyone was really getting excited about what's going on, what's going on, what's going on with Ave, what's going on with uniswap. So I think we need to bring some of that back into DFI. And if you can do that, that'd be pretty amazing. The first step on that is awareness. Right. So how many people already know about hashflow and what you plan to make everyone aware that there is such a great product out there that they should be using?
00:53:38.360 - 00:54:32.884, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's where the education comes in, because I feel like the easier you make it and the more accessible you make education and the simpler you can make it, that's where you win, because there's no better way to attract people into the space than to make it simple for them. The second you start getting technical, and that's why I ask so many clarifying questions. The second you start getting technical, or I don't hear people talk about this a lot, but also getting condescending, you know what I mean? You know so much more than I do, very frankly. Varun also, when I was getting to know him, I really felt like he was educating me and continues to educate me on all things Defi zero. And there are some other people when they talk to me or they talk to other users. They're almost like, oh.
00:54:32.884 - 00:55:25.764, Speaker A: They have that tone of like, why don't you know this already? It's like no one knew about. I didn't even know about this a year and a half ago, so calm down. I think understanding people on a human level and realizing that this takes time and also identifying the problems that we have in our systems and then positioning DeFi and it's not positioning it quite literally is a solution to many of the problems that we face in traditional finance and other arenas. So once people realize that, it incentivizes them to learn about it, because, hey, guess what? You benefit from all of this. So that's really the mindset I have with everything here. And also, I talk to a lot of people in the community. People dm me all the time.
00:55:25.764 - 00:55:27.284, Speaker A: I'm sure you saw in this room.
00:55:27.322 - 00:55:31.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw. You have like 107K Twitter followers. I'm very jealous.
00:55:32.700 - 00:55:52.488, Speaker A: But not just that. I mean, people will message me questions. Someone messaged me during this Twitter space, a question I asked you immediately, like, I care what people want to learn. I care what people are concerned about. I care what people want to know. I'm here. That's my role as a community leader.
00:55:52.488 - 00:55:55.970, Speaker A: So that's what I do.
00:55:56.420 - 00:56:34.590, Speaker B: I think that's phenomenal, the way you said it, it's really authentic. And that makes me even more bullish than I've always been on hashflow. I think it's really important for us to, because the reason we are doing it, if we're not doing it to make a better system for the average person, then we should just go home. But I think that's why we're doing it. And I think translating it and kind of making it easy for people to understand what's in it for them, I think that's phenomenal. That's really well said. And I think we are close to an hour now.
00:56:34.590 - 00:56:38.990, Speaker B: If there's anyone in the audience have any questions in our community.
00:56:44.700 - 00:57:06.992, Speaker A: I don't even know if there's time for community questions, but we'll have to do this again. I would love to speak with you separately and maybe set up another space, for sure. Yeah, I'd love to at least listen in on your podcast, because everything that you're doing just blown away.
00:57:07.046 - 00:57:45.630, Speaker B: Yeah. We're going to be doing a gamefi episode with Ryan Wyatt on the breaking banks global podcast to talk about games and Gamefi. He's exe of YouTube gamings. Ryan runs Polygon studios, and he's kind of one of the people who has really built one of the biggest web, two gaming businesses in the entertainment and media industry. So phenomenal person. Once we record it, I'll circulate it. And we'd love to have you guys, your feedback on that as well.
00:57:47.540 - 00:57:54.930, Speaker A: Varun, any closing words? Oh, no.
00:57:56.420 - 00:58:03.030, Speaker B: I think Varun is in the United States, and they sometimes have bad Wi Fi, even though they kind of invented the Internet over there.
00:58:03.400 - 00:58:08.532, Speaker A: Well, on behalf of Varun, thank you for being here. This has been.
00:58:08.586 - 00:58:09.396, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:58:09.498 - 00:58:16.870, Speaker A: The premiere episode of the Defi state with Ajit Tripathi. Thank you so much for being here.
00:58:17.400 - 00:58:18.496, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Nicole.
00:58:18.528 - 00:58:21.844, Speaker A: And we will see you next week. Thanks, guys.
00:58:22.042 - 00:58:42.360, Speaker B: Have a wonderful evening. Cheers. Bye. It's.
