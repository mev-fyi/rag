00:00:00.490 - 00:00:01.760, Speaker A: Hello, can you hear me?
00:00:03.090 - 00:00:08.160, Speaker B: Balaji, we can hear you even over the intro music. How are you?
00:00:10.370 - 00:00:19.440, Speaker A: This is the new. The new. Hello, is. Can you hear me? And hello, can you hear me? And where are you?
00:00:24.450 - 00:00:28.150, Speaker B: It's sounds like a commercial when you say it. Like a Verizon commercial.
00:00:30.330 - 00:00:32.470, Speaker A: Who would have known that would become the greeting?
00:00:33.770 - 00:00:37.430, Speaker C: GM. I think GM is the modern greeting.
00:00:37.930 - 00:00:40.010, Speaker B: GM is the modern greeting.
00:00:40.670 - 00:00:46.250, Speaker C: I think we need a first commandment or one commandment. But everyone only says GM.
00:00:48.990 - 00:00:56.080, Speaker A: It's really more friendly their possible. Right.
00:00:57.570 - 00:01:35.002, Speaker B: All right, Balaji, I need to give you a formal intro. I need to give this show a formal intro and good morning. And by that, I obviously mean GM. Welcome to the state of DeFi, a weekly show brought to you by hashflow, the new RFQ based decentralized exchange protocol. Hashflow allows you to trade on any chain and cross chain with no front running and no slippage. I'm your host, Nicole Benham. For those of you who don't know me, I'm head of community for hashflow, the host of this show and leader of the hash gang cult.
00:01:35.002 - 00:01:47.790, Speaker B: Today, we have with us Varun, also known as Gandalf the Brown, our CEO, who can get into a little more detail on what exactly hashflow is before we introduce our special guest, Varun.
00:01:50.290 - 00:02:48.814, Speaker C: Hey, guys, thank you for internal and quality. Thank you so much for joining us on the. So, I think I'll keep this fairly brief because I like to talk about network state as so TLDR. As Nicole described, hashflow is a RFQ protocol, or more specifically, it's a decentralized exchange protocol that uses rfqs to connect market makers to takers. So the advantage here, what it means for people trading, is they can trade without front running, and they can trade without slippage. It's a massive improvement in the previous paradigm of Amms for saver. Uniswap solved the zero to one problem for Amms, or Dexes in general, but allowed anybody to create markets on the fly and then basically be able to trade assets without needing a market maker.
00:02:48.814 - 00:03:12.780, Speaker C: What Hashlow did is essentially, it improved on that design by adding RFQ to make price discovery far more seamless. And so we can go a bit more into this, or I think, I suppose we should probably have Balaji take over and give us a bit more into his views on Defi currently, and then we can dive deeper into other things.
00:03:13.710 - 00:03:59.714, Speaker B: All right, well, I got to give Balaji a formal intro. Our special guest today is Balaji S. Srinivasan angel investor and entrepreneur. He was formerly the CTO of Coinbase and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He was also the co founder of Earn, acquired by Coinbase Council, acquired by Myriad Teleport, acquired by Topia and Coin Center. Bology was recognized by MIT Technology Reviews innovators under â‚©35, a Wall Street Journal Innovation award, and holds a BSMS PhD in electrical engineering and an MS in chemical engineering, all from Stanford University. His new book is out the network state, how to start a new country and is receiving a ton of positive reviews.
00:03:59.714 - 00:04:15.520, Speaker B: Recently, Mark Andreessen made a comment and said, and I quote, biology has the highest rate of output per minute of good new ideas of anybody I've ever met. And the network state may be his best. So, I mean, I'm excited to get into this. Balaji, welcome.
00:04:17.650 - 00:04:19.760, Speaker A: Hello. Yeah, welcome. Thank you.
00:04:21.570 - 00:05:05.870, Speaker B: Wow, what an intro. It's crazy what you've accomplished. My iq is definitely going to increase after this space, which I'm excited about. I've taken an iq test right before this and I'm going to take one right after this, and I'm excited to see the result. I want to get right into this. The network state, you said in one sentence, a network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states. What does a highly aligned online community look like? And can you give us some examples?
00:05:07.090 - 00:05:47.034, Speaker A: Sure. So one important concept is there's lots of things people have sort of talked about as being country like Vala Afshar has this tweet that he posts every once in a while that shows know Facebook has more people than India and China combined. And people have talked about bitcoin as a country and so on and so forth. Right. But they're not really countries, or at least they aren't what I consider the successor to the nation state, just as the nation state was arguably the successor to the city state. And one of the reasons they aren't is they aren't tightly aligned enough internally. The 3.6
00:05:47.034 - 00:06:33.834, Speaker A: billion members of Facebook do not really take direction from Zuck. They don't really even necessarily look at Zuck as their sort of lawful president. And it's very distinct from the employees of Facebook, the company that do fold into Zuck in that way and are there because they've consented to be there and can leave if they aren't there. And so that means that Zuck has sort of the ability to steer Facebook, the company, with more legitimacy than he has the ability to steer Facebook. The community, which is just a much different thing. Those people are there for a utility, there for a community. And so when I say a highly aligned online community, that is just a level that's far beyond essentially a typical social network or even a discord group.
00:06:33.834 - 00:07:07.954, Speaker A: One way of measuring alignment, if you take somebody who has, let's say, a million Twitter followers, okay, on balance, typically if they put out a tweet, a lot of traffic or engagement would be like 1000 to 2000 likes. So on the order of 0.1 to 0.2% of the people who follow them engage with that tweet. And that's actually not a very highly aligned community. That's people who are basically there for the popcorn. They're thinking about this as a way of almost like a tv channel.
00:07:07.954 - 00:07:50.340, Speaker A: You flip a channel, oh, yeah, tennis is on whatever, or whatever you like to watch that. And it's not like a true community, like a Game of Thrones group is not a highly aligned community. A company newsletter is typically not a highly aligned community. If you have an engagement rate that is significantly less than 100%, it's non aligned community. Now compare that, for example, to a 30 person company. If you call in all hands, everybody is there, right? So that's highly aligned. But it's not a community, it's a company, okay? And those folks are present because it's their job and it's a high priority for them to be there.
00:07:50.340 - 00:08:49.970, Speaker A: And if you think about something that combines that degree of alignment of a company, maybe not exactly at 100%, but definitely very high, and has maybe the scale of some of these Internet communities, that's kind of what I'm talking about when I talk about a highly aligned community. And something as simple and as big as you have, discord might not be actually the forum for it. But imagine you had a discord and you have 1000 people and somebody is launching a product and you paste it in there and you're like, hey, can people signal boost this? Or they've got a new app and they're like, hey, can people test this app? And they get 1000 testers. Now, of course, whenever you paste in something like that, you're effectively debiting from the community. You're asking for resources from it. And so to do so, you need to credit the community. And that may mean putting in labor like your time, or in the event that you can't put in time for a reason, you might be able to substitute capital.
00:08:49.970 - 00:09:27.294, Speaker A: And so that leads to the concept of a tokenized community where there's, like, a scoreboard or a karma. It doesn't have to be, like, a crypto token, which is incredibly liquid and tradable. This does not have to be something that you're trying to build into a giant moneymaker, okay, but just something to sort of keep score. Something in between, I don't know, stack overflow karma and something more serious or a board game and something more serious. Union dues, whatever you want to call it, something to keep score within this community helps sort of quantify the alignment. Maybe you have a leaderboard as well. For those who have contributed the most and done the most for the community, and those who have given the most to the community can ask from the community.
00:09:27.294 - 00:09:56.380, Speaker A: It's karma. It's peer to peer. If you give, then you can take, and you don't take unless you give that kind of thing. And so what I'm describing is totally feasible online, but it hasn't really been built online, because it means taking these online communities really seriously as, like, the primary modes of human organization, not simply places that people go to hang out and look at whatever, discuss Game of Thrones or whatever shows on tv today, blah, blah, blah, but to actually do things together. All right, let me pause there.
00:09:57.950 - 00:10:09.630, Speaker B: Okay. Wow. Okay. So are there examples that you can give or what does this look like the way that you imagine?
00:10:12.450 - 00:10:48.166, Speaker A: You know, one of my friends, Jan Tolin, he's an early Skype engineer, very early Skype, but he's also, like, a really good investor. First investor in DeepMind. He said there were three things that he was early to AI crypto and dance. Okay, so what does this look like? Dance. Let me talk about that. What he means by dance, and I'm just paraphrasing here, so Jan may phrase it differently, is the coordination of people. Okay, so let's say, for example, you have two people, and they're on a dance floor, and they start dancing, and they're really elegant movies.
00:10:48.166 - 00:11:06.846, Speaker A: And sometimes in real life, the crowd clears back. They're all admiring this couple and how elegant their twirls and all this stuff is. Okay. And that's, like two people who've sort of become, like, one organism for the purpose of that dance. You can scale that up. It's like cheerleaders at a football game. They'll form this pyramid.
00:11:06.846 - 00:12:14.120, Speaker A: It's, like, quite complicated to do that. You have to choreograph it, or you have a military march where a bunch of people are. The reason military marches are done is it shows that that group of people can move in this very unnatural, highly coordinated way with this marching kind of thing and stepping this way with their full battled regalia, because it means that they have martial discipline. They can move as one unit, right? Then you scale it up one more level, and you get to a cryptocurrency, and that's a bunch of people who are all aligned with each other, even if the outside world doesn't like it or doesn't want to participate in cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, the interactions of these millions of people are setting prices. They are creating value amongst themselves, even if the rest of the world doesn't believe in it yet. Okay, so the point is that each of those examples, as you go from the couple on the dance floor to the cheerleader pyramid, to the military march, the cryptocurrency, regardless of the outside world, if a group of people really align with each other very much, then that gives birth to something.
00:12:14.120 - 00:12:37.466, Speaker A: That's basically what I would consider the quantitative definition of a nation. People in the past, the term nation and state are actually different terms. Nation comes from the same root word as natality. It means like common birth, common descent. The state is the administrative layer, like the government. Lots of people have essayed meaning. They've tried different definitions of a nation, sort of like the wise men and the elephant.
00:12:37.466 - 00:12:56.002, Speaker A: They're pulling on the trunk, they're pulling on the tail. They're giving different things. Some people say a nation is those of common language, others of common genetics, common descent. So others say it's a proposition nation, and so on. And I kind of have a quantity of definition, which is a nation is a bunch of people who are very densely connected in a social network that say they're all friends with each other.
00:12:56.056 - 00:12:56.370, Speaker C: Okay?
00:12:56.440 - 00:13:36.686, Speaker A: And do they have to exactly all be friends with each other. 1000 people may not all be friends with each other, but they're much closer to that than they are to a thousand other random people. They're like a complete subgraph, if you know the mathematical term. And so the closer you are to a complete subgraph where all the people care for each other, pay attention to each other, work with each other. And that's something, by the way, that can be literally quantified, right? You can parse Twitter, parse some other social graph, see mutual relationships, et cetera. You can pull those subgraphs out, distill the true communities out of these giant warrens, these huge social networks that aren't really communities. You distill the communities out there, and those communities don't look necessarily like offline communities.
00:13:36.686 - 00:14:15.146, Speaker A: They're communities of the mind, not communities of the land. And then putting structure around those communities, that's kind of what I think is the next step. Okay, so you asked what those look like. It kind of looks like taking the existing organic communities of the mind that exist online and starting to actually identify them and group them. And if you just parse the Twitter graph, for example, and you just looked for connected subgraphs, densely connected subgraphs, you'd probably find quite a few of these. And I know, like, a couple of folks have done things like this. And depending on how high a bar you set, you get more, but fewer, or rather more communities that are denser.
00:14:15.146 - 00:14:28.726, Speaker A: And if you require less connections, you get fewer communities but less dense. Okay, so that's kind of what it looks like from like a graph theory perspective I can talk about in other ways as well. Okay, I know that was a lot. Ask me questions. Jump.
00:14:28.778 - 00:14:39.350, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, that was a lot. So when you say, like, communities of the mind, does it mean that we're connected by similar values? And also, is this anything like a kibutz?
00:14:40.010 - 00:15:18.402, Speaker A: It is like a kibutz. It is also like the intentional communities concept that people have heard about that. It's like the so called communistic societies of the United States in the mid 18 hundreds. It's like digital nomad groups. It's like diasporic groups which may be distributed around the world, but in the old times, they used to write letters to each other, keep in touch all of the various sort of ethnic chinatowns or what have you. These were spots that people from the diaspora could kind of find a meal and find people who spoke their language and so on. A home away from home.
00:15:18.402 - 00:15:34.710, Speaker A: Right? And so there's precedents. The network state is not just like some kind of crazy thing I came up with or whatever. Maybe it is also that. But one way of thinking about it is how much astronomy do you know? Have you messed around, looked at astronomy?
00:15:36.010 - 00:15:37.160, Speaker B: Not too much.
00:15:37.930 - 00:16:40.830, Speaker A: Okay, well, so one way of thinking about it is we know our own solar system, and we've got nine planets, and they're going around the sun in a certain orbit. And with our telescopes, people can look far away in space, and they can see all kinds of other weird things out there which satisfy the laws of physics, like multistar systems and so on. So searching through space, we can see way more than is just within the ken of our immediate experience. And by analogy to that, if you think about the fact that we have one life, but there's 100 billion people, roughly, that people estimate have ever lived going back in time rather than space. Just like you can see configurations of other stars, like weird configurations that worked, you can see configurations of humans that worked in the past that are very nonobvious, like very non obvious solutions to the laws of human physics that you can pull out of the past and say, maybe that solution can work again today, even if people don't realize it.
00:16:40.900 - 00:16:42.526, Speaker B: What's in an example of that?
00:16:42.708 - 00:17:22.060, Speaker A: So I'll give some examples. So one is there's this great book called against elections, the case for democracy. Okay? So it's provocatively titled, and essentially his book is on what the ancients thought of as democracy. They meant sortition, not election. Okay, so what's sortition? That is actually the practice that William Buckley joked about but actually brought to life, which is random selection of leaders from the community. So you don't have any lengthy campaigning or anything like that. It's actually like the whole game theory thing about you cut the cake and I choose the piece.
00:17:22.060 - 00:17:50.546, Speaker A: You have to live in a community where everybody's virtuous enough that anybody could become the next leader of the community. Okay? So all of the campaigning, all the gamesmanship, instead, you just need to essentially have high enough trust and have high enough virtue that anybody there could become the leader. Okay? And then you draw lots again the next year. Right? And SO that worked. That's amazing. You would not think of that as a configuration that could work. Now, of course, you can read on the pros and cons of this.
00:17:50.546 - 00:18:47.750, Speaker A: It goes into this in the book. That's like one example of something kind of crazy, right? Other examples like the millet system or various religious communities prior to emancipation would have their own private law within the community. And the king or the state would say, okay, you guys handle your own affairs within your community, and only really serious issues will the outside world get involved. Okay? And that's something where it's not actually the normal nation, where everybody's a citizen and equal under the law. Instead, you have subcultures and subgovernments within a country. Okay? David FriEdman has a book, this is PatrIck FriEdman's father, Milton FriEdmAn's son, called legal systems, very different from ours, which is worth reading if you're interested in this topic. I can go on more, but those are just a few examples.
00:18:49.850 - 00:19:04.540, Speaker B: Okay? Those are great examples. And in terms of nation states, clearly there are some problems with them. What are SOme of the main problems that you've identified that don't work? I mean, there's so many.
00:19:04.910 - 00:19:45.446, Speaker A: There's many. But one problem is the things we call nation states often are not actually nation states. And why is that? Well, going back to that thing, we use the term nation state. But if we ask, what is the nation and what is the state? As I mentioned, nation comes from the same root word as natality, like nazis. And it's like common birth, common descent, common ancestry, common culture. So, like the canonical nation, like the Japanese nation, okay? These are people who for many years have spoken the same language, lived in the same place, have the same culture. All These things, like, line up, okay? And that's distinct from the JAPaNese state.
00:19:45.446 - 00:20:21.774, Speaker A: For example, in 1946, the Japanese nation, the people, was governed by the American state. After the occupation of Japan, after Hiroshima, Nagasaki, when the US won, it occupied Japan, and the state was really the american state. That was the supreme government, okay? And so once you think of the relationship between the nation and the state, one analogy is it's like the relationship between labor and management in a factory, okay? Like, the nation is the people, and the state is government, just like the labor is like the masses within the factory, and the management is the executive layer.
00:20:21.822 - 00:20:22.082, Speaker B: Right?
00:20:22.136 - 00:21:01.274, Speaker A: Now, that doesn't mean that relationship has to be adversarial, but it indicates that it can be adversarial at times, right? Because interests are not always aligned, and you want them to be aligned. Okay? So this brings us to the definition of a nation state. So, historically, the point of a nation state was you have this group of people that has some historical association, and it need not be, by the way, genetic. This is the thing. When I talked about the guys all talking about the elephant, the tail of the elephant, the leg of the elephant, et cetera, it could be religious, it could be cultural, it could be linguistic. I mentioned Japan and speaking Japanese. That seems like a pretty good kind of definition, japanese nation.
00:21:01.274 - 00:21:54.220, Speaker A: But if you went to, let's say, like, being able to speak Spanish, it seems like there's too many people spread across too many different places with too many different cultures to think of there being a spanish nation, or rather a spanish speaking nation, in the same way that there's a japanese speaking nation, right? So that one axis alone of language isn't perfect, right? But it's not simply scale, because China has sort of forged a nation. It's 95% Han speaks basically the same dialect of Chinese. So you can argue this point, and certainly they've got many ethnicities within China, but basically, it's multivariate, right? So for any given community, if you've got a distance metric between two people, nodes in the social graph, you can say. And I talk about this in the book a little bit. And the v two. I'm going to go into a bunch.
00:21:55.970 - 00:21:58.290, Speaker B: I actually pinned the image.
00:21:59.030 - 00:21:59.682, Speaker A: Oh, great.
00:21:59.736 - 00:22:06.610, Speaker B: Yeah. So that people can look at it. So it's pinned to the top of the space. So if we go to that image, what can you tell us?
00:22:06.760 - 00:22:28.602, Speaker A: Okay, great. So graph theory. I'll do the graph theory later. Short version is basically that the distances between nodes in a graph, you can take a bunch of different ones, linguistic distance, genetic distance, cultural distance, et cetera. And you can cluster on that basis, and you can define nations on that basis. And the reason that nation states are broken today is that many of them are not nation states. They've got multiple nations underneath the state.
00:22:28.602 - 00:22:55.106, Speaker A: For example, there's the Democrat nation and the republican nation. That's like Sunni and Shiite, Hudo and Tutsi, Protestant and Catholic. Those are really two different nations under one state. You can see this even in marriage. 96% of Democrats are not married to Republicans. Only 4% would marry a Republican. And so that's like, ideology becomes biology in one generation, right? That's like an ethnic thing.
00:22:55.106 - 00:23:10.818, Speaker A: It's no longer an ideological thing. It's a tribal thing. And so that's like, really a multinational state. It's at least a binational state, arguably multinational, if you go and dig in further. So when people talk about, oh, we're not aligned, we're polarized. It's way deeper than that. Right.
00:23:10.818 - 00:23:47.206, Speaker A: And so, in a sense, the answer is actually to return to the original concept of a nation state and realize that these are not nation states, they're really multinational empires. Okay? And that's why there's conflict, because it's like an empire that's got a lot of different squabbling groups that do not share values underneath the same ostensible banner. And if they were each able to form their own states, they'd be very different. That's not just the US. That's all over the world, all kinds of places, many different folks from the like, all kinds of different groups have been actually writing about the. I can, you know, give you some of those links later. Okay.
00:23:47.206 - 00:23:51.350, Speaker A: Why don't I talk about your image now? Or the image. Okay, good. Nicole?
00:23:52.090 - 00:23:53.138, Speaker B: Yes, I'm listening.
00:23:53.154 - 00:24:20.042, Speaker A: Okay, great. Sure. So this image, I want to do a lot more visuals in the v two and so on, but this image, I think, summarizes the concept. Okay. Just like bitcoin, decentralized, the currency. Can we decentralize the state itself. And really the key concept, or one of the key concepts is that the Internet increases the value of enclaves.
00:24:20.042 - 00:25:22.430, Speaker A: Okay? What's an enclave? It's like a piece of territory that's surrounded by another sovereign enclaves kind of used to be how the world worked before maps, or like what we consider sophisticated modern maps before modern serving, before the ideology of nationalism, which is itself a social construct before all of that stuff. If you look at an old map of Europe before Bismarck, or even you look at a map of India pre 1947 with the 562 princely states, right? It looks fractal. There's just all of these different groups or whatever, because people were not like staring at a map that had been rectified with rectilinear boundaries. They were sort of snapped a grid, right? The nations of the world right now are like a snap to grid of something that was much more organic and fractal and so on before that point, okay? And there were lots of enclaves and people would just walk. There weren't passports, there wasn't border control, not in the same way you did have forts and stuff. It wasn't like people didn't think about defense. They had moats.
00:25:22.430 - 00:26:20.642, Speaker A: I'm not saying there weren't defended passes or canals or things like that, but knowledge to even think about borders in the way we do today and to have the sophisticated maps we do today that wasn't there, right? You could just kind of walk around the world, all right? And what changed that is once you got kind of modern surveying, once people kind of had borders to fight over, people really started fixing on them. Now, I'm not like a reflexively anti border person, but I do recognize that a lot of the borders on the planet were just sort of ridden by the British. For example, all the straight lines in Africa or the Middle east, there's just like some guy just went and made some lines on a map. It didn't reflect underlying ethnic groups or linguistic groups and so on. It was not an organic fit. Okay? All right. Why does that matter? Well, now, today, so one of the reasons that enclaves went away is all those little pockets, all those little things with a little king here, prince there, et cetera.
00:26:20.642 - 00:27:02.386, Speaker A: They all got rolled up by these nation states. Nation states are like scale creatures, okay? What we now think of as France or Germany or Italy is actually relatively recent, just a few hundred years old, okay? And in fact, at the time of the french revolution, Hobbesbaum talks about how most people in what we now think of as France did not speak what we now think of as French. They spoke like other languages or dialects and it got all just steamrolled out and smoothed out by the french government. Similarly for Italy, Garabaldi unified Italy. Bismarck unified Germany. And they homogenized the law, the language, all this stuff in this gigantic terrain. Okay? One way of seeing this, what the old world used to be.
00:27:02.386 - 00:27:31.962, Speaker A: And then I'll come back to the image. If you think about the UN country, quote unquote, of San Marino, that's like this duct bill Platypus, like a piece of the past that made its way into the future or the present. And it's just like this 30,000 person little thing that's within Italy on a map. And that's like what the world used to be. They sovereignty because they sheltered Garibaldi during independence. But the world used to be lots of enclaves like that. Okay? Now fast forward to the present day.
00:27:31.962 - 00:28:40.402, Speaker A: In the present day, because the Internet, because of remote work, because of cryptocurrency, because of augmented reality and virtual reality, which are going to become bigger and bigger when we have ar glasses, because of starlink, right? Because basically anything we want to do can be done on the Internet. Now, you can imagine a country with pockets of territory all throughout the world that's connected by the Internet. Just as the islands of Indonesia are all separated and fractal, they're separated by ocean, but they think of themselves one country, just as Hawai is 2000 miles away from the continental United States. But the mental software installed in the people who live in Hawaii and those in the US, they think of themselves as part of the same country, okay? Just like that. Just like people can be thousands of miles away but think of themselves conceptually as being part of the same country. That's a mental leap where you say, what if those things were not separated just by ocean but by Internet? And they think of themselves as part of the same country, okay? And that's what this visual is about. It says if you had a million person something network shape, what would it look like? You'd have these nodes all around the world.
00:28:40.402 - 00:29:29.902, Speaker A: Some of them are apartment buildings and some of them are houses and some of them are frankly just literally individual apartments where someone just has a flag on the wall and they consider themselves to be a citizen of that network state. Just like they consider themselves today to be an ethereum or a bitcoiner or whatever, just based on their holdings, right? They can talk about with people online, they can be effectively dual citizens. This is very important. Just like you don't have to hold everything in bitcoin or everything in ethereum, 1% is actually a lot, right? You can hold, like, a fraction of your holdings in there, but you still think about this a lot more than your fiat holdings. In the same way, just like people can have multiple currencies, soon everyone will have multiple passports. Digital passports, I believe, are what comes after digital currency. And this is actually another way of thinking about nfts, is nfTs.
00:29:29.902 - 00:29:54.966, Speaker A: People talk about them as art, and that's an application. I'm not saying they aren't, but another way of thinking about them is as a passport to a community. And then the art on it can be broken up into a specific and a generic component. For example, the generic component for something like board, ape yacht club is like the ape concept. And the specific is that which is unique to the person. In the same way on, let's say, a us passport. Passport.
00:29:54.966 - 00:30:48.614, Speaker A: The generic is sort of the artwork or whatever around a know all the stuff that's like anti fraud, blah, blah, blah. And the specific is like your specific passport photo, okay? And then that passport gives you access to things, just as the digital passport gives you access to that community, and then over time, access to other kinds of things that the community builds. Okay? So you can log in with metamask or whatever. If you have that nft in your wallet, then you can get access. Okay? So this visual over here of the network state in one image shows a community that is at the scale of a traditional nation state in population, but also actually in real estate. Right? That collective footprint around the world, all those ranches and apartment buildings and cul de sac and even small towns, all of those together add up to something that's legitimately country scale. It's just like an Internet.
00:30:48.614 - 00:30:56.880, Speaker A: Indonesia. If you've seen the map of Indonesia, it's lots and lots and lots of small islands separated by ocean. This is lots and lots and lots of small islands separated by.
00:31:02.370 - 00:31:03.502, Speaker C: A question here.
00:31:03.636 - 00:31:04.480, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:31:05.410 - 00:31:51.040, Speaker C: I think one of the observations we could make based on what you described is you almost think of blockchains as their own nation states. Because what I'm taking away here is basically anywhere people with common set of values come together and interact with something. So when they align common set of values and principles, they essentially end up forming a state or a nation. Could you almost think of blockchains as different nation states? In the sense that if you look at bitcoin community, it's kind of like they have a common set of principles that align them and they decide to form the bitcoin community. And then if you see ethereum, it's very different from the way bitcoin people interact with each other or the things they fundamentally believe in. So do you think that's a good analogy here or just broadly interesting to see? What do you think?
00:31:52.390 - 00:32:39.280, Speaker A: Well, yeah, so basically, just like you've got. Absolutely. The cultures of different coins are going to be already are like precedents for the cultures of different countries in the same way that the Japanese yen and the Korean won today. Functionally they're really not that different, but they give you access to a different enough set of goods and services. The turkish lira, that's not the best performing currency. But point being, that functionality is not always the distinction between two different currencies. It could be community.
00:32:39.280 - 00:33:18.490, Speaker A: As technologists, we're used to thinking of it as always being, okay, this has privacy, this has programmability, et cetera. But if something could be successful, probably as like the Ethereum of know or the Solana of Spain, okay, and you could just win on the basis of just extreme community adoption, even if your technology was otherwise generic, you win on the distribution and that would actually mean that you're culturally different. The suite of applications that we built would reflect maybe the same underlying technology, but have different distribution.
00:33:20.750 - 00:33:49.300, Speaker C: Yeah, previously I thought I used to think about these applications as companies or incorporations being set up on top of a nation network, in which sense you can think of us as a network. And then you have Facebook's, the Google's and so on are like the Dapps that are being built on top of a us network. Right. If you think of us as a more centralized network per se. But you're saying that you can also think about these Dapps as their own independent, small.
00:33:54.230 - 00:34:23.970, Speaker A: You know, actually on that topic, there's an interesting thing you can google, which is 50 states of the US population over time. Visual capitalist has one link and so does YouTube has another. I might post this after this. And what you'll find also is like, within the US, competition between states was actually a huge thing, is still a huge thing over its time period. For example, Joe, states were really big in the mid, late 18 hundreds.
00:34:26.470 - 00:34:27.220, Speaker C: No.
00:34:28.070 - 00:34:30.478, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead, Nick.
00:34:30.574 - 00:34:33.874, Speaker B: No, same. No.
00:34:34.072 - 00:35:25.470, Speaker A: So Ohio was actually pretty big. Ohio? What the heck? Yeah, but that's why it's like father of presidents, okay. Like I think, you know, half a dozen presidents, seven presidents, something like that came from Ohio. Why? Because it was, know what we now call the Rust Belt. But it's like this big deal in manufacturing or the antecedent of what we call manufacturing, like commodities and stuff at that time. And what you find, which is interesting, is if you look at this graph over time, of which states have gained and lost population, people talk about us as a nation of immigrants, and I've also talked about it as a nation of immigrants, like those who left their home countries to come. But there's yet a third perspective, which is it's a nation of internal immigrants to a much greater extent than I think people realize.
00:35:25.470 - 00:36:22.802, Speaker A: That is like a page rankish thing where these states are competing with each other for citizens within the union. Okay? And that migration tells a story. And it's actually kind of amazing how the top one to four ish states do kind of define the era. And one thing that's kind of interesting is over the last 20, 30, 40 years, you've seen New York losing ground and California, Texas, Florida gaining. And more recently you've seen California losing ground and Texas. And, and, you know, Florida's sort of know on the national landscape. Know in a know with Miami and all the tech people going there, it's an overnight success, but it's decades in the making because if you look at the ascent of Florida in population, just been gaining ground since like the, according to visual capitalists, it's just like ascending the ranks because it's out of weather.
00:36:22.802 - 00:37:12.146, Speaker A: But Miami is like the Singapore of Latin America. Many people don't know that. If you're from two countries in south or Latin America and you want to ink a deal, often you'll use Miami because it's like a neutral location, sort of like what Singapore is in Southeast Asia and what know was in Europe and so on. Right? And maybe the UAE isn't in the Middle east. And so the point being that basically this internal competition was a big so, but that's kind of coming back, right? States are differentiating to a much greater extent. You're seeing governors like California trash talk to each other. There's actually some good to that because competition between states, if friendly for migrants is like the ultimate kind of vote.
00:37:12.146 - 00:37:13.910, Speaker A: All right, let me pause here, get your thoughts.
00:37:14.810 - 00:37:50.850, Speaker B: All right, Balaji, I just want to quickly say, not to interrupt you, but you are listening to the Defi state brought to you by hashflow, the new RFQ based decentralized exchange protocol. Hashflow allows you to trade on any chain and cross chain with no front running and no slippage. Follow hashflow up on here on stage with me to learn more. I'm so excited that we're having this conversation. And not to make this like a podcast, but to make this like a podcast, I want to take this in a different direction. So what are your views on Defi?
00:37:51.590 - 00:38:45.070, Speaker A: What are my views on DeFi? Well, I kind of think that the entire crypto space is sort of building out in reverse. It's sort of like, first, have you ever seen those tornadoes in the midwest? And the tornado comes through town and just picks up all these homes and rolls them into the air. So think about crypto is first the Federal Reserve bitcoin, then Wall street, which is Ethereum, and then more recently, every single financial instrument under the sun, which is DFI and all the new l ones and whatnot. And then just like that tornado thing, but in reverse. I think in the very last frame, you just see the tornadoes go like this with its wrist, and all of these homes just get built out on the ground.
00:38:45.150 - 00:38:45.634, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:45.752 - 00:39:11.066, Speaker A: Why? Because I kind of think we're building the economy. Wall street first, Main street second. It's like cloud first, land last. Just absolutely enormous amount of money is just flowing around in the cloud. Right. And it just needs to be connected to something, to a productive thing offline. And what is that productive thing? I think it's probably going to be startup societies and network states.
00:39:11.066 - 00:39:41.330, Speaker A: That's not the only thing, let me put it like that. But I think it is one thing. And why is because people have talked about, oh, put real estate on the blockchain and so on and so forth. Then there's a good aspect to that. There's also a bad aspect to it. One of them is that just the practicalities of it, real estate investors are seeking kind of stable return and so on and so forth. And crypto people want fast upside, but willing to take extremely high risk.
00:39:41.330 - 00:40:11.838, Speaker A: That's a mismatch in terms of profile. The second is that you need a sovereign to be able to actually enforce that real estate title. And how are you going to get that if it's off chain? That's not just off chain, right? That's not like an atomic swap or something like that. That's like a physical thing. So you need a cooperative local legal system. So all those things, real estate on the blockchain makes sense in some ways. Certainly if you take a look at the 2008 financial crisis, a big part of it was people couldn't even track mortgages across companies.
00:40:11.838 - 00:40:39.490, Speaker A: People had lost track of title. They didn't know who had signed what mortgage. People didn't have the note. Everything got infractionalized and securitized. In theory, if that was all on chain, you could track that and you would have better auditing and less fraud, et cetera. But in practice, it's nontrivial. So why did I bring that up? Well, I do think that the kind of thing you could do if you were doing crypto real estate would not be some existing apartment building that you just securitize, but on the blockchain.
00:40:39.490 - 00:41:04.442, Speaker A: It has to be something that's exciting and new and that's high risk, high reward. Like, okay, we're going to crowdfund the startup society, basically. Like burning man went and built out. It does it every year. 70,000 units in the desert by just going horizontal in a week. That shows what's possible when you can do horizontal sprawl. By the way, neither NIMBY nor YiMBY, but HiMby.
00:41:04.442 - 00:41:18.386, Speaker A: Right? NIMBY is like, not in my backyard, can't build. These are obvious acronyms for many people. Let's explain them. YIMBY is, yes, in my backyard, they want to build skyscrapers and stuff. And look, YIMBY is way better than NIMBY. But HiMBY is interesting because it's horizontal. Sprawl is good.
00:41:18.386 - 00:41:55.950, Speaker A: Why? Because you can build fast if you can build a one story building, or not even a building, if it's a trailer, if it's a shed, if it's a lean to, if it's burning man level, you can build tens of thousands of units in days. And the failure of them, if your little lean to or whatever it is, falls down, it doesn't really affect your neighbor. And if you don't like ESPN, you can move. And in fact, burning man is more similar to how towns were initially settled. They didn't just go there and start building skyscrapers really tall and inflexible and expensive. They built things that were built for mobility. And this is what we're seeing with van life and so on and so forth.
00:41:55.950 - 00:42:45.646, Speaker A: So my point is, defi is good. I'm not like a huge trader or anything like that, but it would be better if it had something to connect to, which could make use of these insane financial instruments. And I think what it could be connected to is funding the buildout of starved societies like Burning man, but building man. And so now, with a flick of the wrist, all this money from the cloud comes down and boom, boom, you've got 70,000 units in a week. Something along those lines, the technology actually exists. If you go and look at some of the videos I've posted, like prefab building in China, they can snap together like a subway station in 9 hours. The technology exists even if you just don't even go to that level, but you just go to the stuff they use for so called man camps, the oil fields.
00:42:45.646 - 00:43:17.914, Speaker A: You can snap together direct quality housing in the middle of nowhere with generators and water. This is one of the few dividends of all the wars America's fought. And actually all the oil fields you can snap together decent housing in the middle of nowhere, at least enough for people to live. And so that technology exists, right? That stack exists. There's a whole group of people that just do that. So you could tap into that with all this defi money and kaboom. You've got a startup society, an intentional community, a place that has a one commandment, and I think that's something I'd like to see defi use for.
00:43:17.914 - 00:43:25.550, Speaker A: As I said, look, I'm fine if people want to trade. I'm not like a huge trader, but I'd like to see Defi use for something useful and maybe it can be used for this kind of thing in the next cycle.
00:43:25.970 - 00:43:37.540, Speaker B: This definitely seems more meaningful. I wanted to ask you about your involvement in hashflow. How did you get involved and what other applications are you?
00:43:39.030 - 00:44:08.060, Speaker A: So, you know, I've known Varun as an engineer for several years, and I think I'm an admirer of what Uniswap did with Amm. I do think like an RFQ model is interesting and worth trying to do on chain, and it's a little more similar to how pricing works offline. And I think it's a worthy experiment and happy to be an investor and see how it works out.
00:44:09.710 - 00:44:33.060, Speaker B: Love it. I have so many questions from everything that you've said. It's funny, every time you talk, it's so fascinating and I'm getting so many messages and I can see in the subtweet so many questions. You can go in any direction, but you're also so self aware that you pause and you're like, all right, that's a lot to unpack. Got any questions? Which I love?
00:44:34.630 - 00:44:53.130, Speaker A: I did a little DM with a gif that I posted. If you want to post that because you pinned the image, there's a gif. Maybe take a look at that. That might be helpful for people to see how a network state could build out from one to ten to 100 to 1000, 10,000, 10,0000, a million people.
00:44:53.200 - 00:44:54.460, Speaker B: Did you tweet this?
00:44:55.390 - 00:45:01.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I did tweet it. If you go to my pinned tweet. It's the first reply to my pin tweet.
00:45:01.162 - 00:45:14.740, Speaker B: Okay, so pin tweet, first reply. Okay, I'm going to pin that. There we go. And hopefully it's the right one. So I do have more questions.
00:45:21.740 - 00:45:23.450, Speaker C: Nicole, can't hear you.
00:45:27.340 - 00:45:28.890, Speaker A: Hello, Nicole? Yeah.
00:45:34.160 - 00:45:36.190, Speaker C: For some reason I can't hear you, but.
00:45:38.320 - 00:45:39.230, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:45:39.680 - 00:46:02.068, Speaker C: Anyway, there we, yeah, I was going to generally ask you around the applications you're generally interested in DeFi or based on the examples you just gave around things where it can be used in a more meaningful way. Have you seen any interesting things come up recently that you think could be something that could steer the direction towards building out these nation states?
00:46:02.234 - 00:47:04.520, Speaker A: Well, so again, I'm interested in Defi in a neutral, positive way, as a tool. There are people who are great traders, they just love the game of speculation per se. I'm not smart enough for that. I just buy and hold. I'm basically a seed investor, early investor. So the things I'm interested in are like, as I mentioned, defi for startup societies, or another thing I'm interested in is d five for DSi, right? Decentralized science, okay? And what I mean by this is there's science, real science, and then there's quote unquote science, which is masks don't work before they do, because science, okay, and this is like official science, establishment science. And it essentially has gotten away from what true science is because the core of science is not insistent repetition, it's not prestigious citation, it's independent replication.
00:47:04.520 - 00:47:34.192, Speaker A: If you cannot replicate the results of somebody else, it's not science. And if you can, then it is. And that one test alone is something that smashes to pieces a huge amount of the academia prestige culture. And anyway, I've talked about this at length in various talks. There's actually something I did with molecule Dow on this topic of decentralized science. But just to connect you to Defi, if you can get academics, or frankly it don't have to be credentialed academics, this is important. It could be.
00:47:34.192 - 00:48:19.228, Speaker A: We go back to the era of gentleman science, gentle person science, okay, anybody, any anon, whatever, can just set up on the Internet, start doing research. And it doesn't have to be presented in a typical academic fashion. All it has to be, ideally is reproducible, right? And journal papers, those were invented at the time as the best way to communicate to other scientists. And you might not invent the same format, there's good aspects of it, but there's things you can do much better in particular, you'd make the data and the code on chain. You'd allow people to connect together. There's a prototype of this that somebody did at use scholar.org that you can see where you actually have a citation graph on chain.
00:48:19.228 - 00:49:26.612, Speaker A: So the point being that if you use DeFI for DSI, labs or individual labs wouldn't just be able to put their papers and stuff on chain, they might be able to monetize independently of NIH and NSF and the giant us government bureaucracy with nfts and tokens and stuff like that. There's a million different Huberman lab. Andrew Hugman, he's experimented with this, I think like David Sinclair has experimented with this. And all the real innovative know, especially like life extension, brain machine interface, limb regeneration, some of the stem cell stuff, the awesome stuff. That's the speculative stuff. I mean, if DeFi is going to speculate on something, it should speculate on awesome stuff and a relatively small quantity of money, like a million bucks for some of these smart people, letting them work for a year outside of the stupid constraints. I shouldn't say you have no, many people have no concept of how stultifying academia is nowadays and the extent to which there's just a cohort of people.
00:49:26.612 - 00:50:03.376, Speaker A: Patrick Collison has posted this graph. NIH has posted this graph. It's just like literally a cohort of people that got phds like a few decades ago. And every year the group that gets grants just steps up. One year. It's just a bunch of people awarding grants to their friends and they become more and more of a gerontocracy and people have to be like 40 something before they can start their own lab and blah, blah, blah, all these terrible things. So instead, if you're going to speculate on something, don't be like when airdrop, speculate on something which would have massive real payoff for the community in the world if it works and the property rights and stuff needs to get worked out.
00:50:03.376 - 00:50:48.944, Speaker A: But one model might be all the people in the lab, they have personal tokens and they're underneath their eth. So it's like Jim Eth and Joe Eth, they're using those within the lab, they're using those online, and they sell some amount of personal tokens to fund lab work, and then you can redeem them later for hours of that person's time. So for example, let's say it's like human lab, or just like any lab, I won't name a specific person, but some lab they've got five grad students or the equivalent. They're all working on this thing. And people will sell, let's say, 50 hours of time for x, sell an NFT of their publication for y. They use that to fund things. And then later, if you've got those personal tokens, you can redeem them.
00:50:48.944 - 00:51:20.024, Speaker A: For example, if you bought 10 hours of Jeff Bezos's time at age 18 for, I don't know, $10,000 or whatever, he would have sold it for maybe $1,000. I don't know, those would be extremely valuable hours. Like 1 hour of Buffett's time today is worth like a million bucks. Right. So you'd sell essentially consulting hours at some price, and then people could redeem them in the future. And of course, how would you enforce the redemption? Well, there's various ways of doing that. One is you do it where that person is burning their reputation.
00:51:20.024 - 00:51:51.750, Speaker A: So in the event that those tokens are issued through uranium ETH, and the person on the other side who's bought those personal tokens from you is not actually seeing you perform your consulting duties or whatever, then they can post an NFT to you saying, hey, so and so didn't do this. There's various ways of doing online reputation. Another is, of course, to have some partial reliance on offline courts. A third is some kind of escrow system. People can think about this. I'm not saying I have all the answers on that.
00:51:52.920 - 00:52:18.828, Speaker C: I was going to ask you there. I think there's two questions, actually, at least. I was thinking perhaps journalism or flow of information could be one of the interesting applications that is yet to be disrupted. But I think one of the interesting points you made in the book is essentially, if you look at the world war era, when you said the war of the nations was about the land, then essentially your network war is about the control of minds and information.
00:52:18.914 - 00:52:19.404, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:19.522 - 00:52:25.520, Speaker C: Right. I wonder if that could be an interesting application that Defi could disrupt.
00:52:26.980 - 00:53:26.660, Speaker A: Well, yeah, the thing is the progress from before trade, if you saw somebody who had a fruit like apples that you wanted, you'd have to beat them over the head to get those apples. And there may be some animals that trade, but for the most part, animals don't trade. And so it's like a huge human innovation where you can scale beyond yourself. Rather than beat the guy over the head for apples and he might beat you over the head back. You get some oranges, they get some apples, you trade, you come back, do it again the next day, your community can scale and you've replaced violence with nonviolent capitalistic cooperation and not just competition in the same way, it'd be an enormous breakthrough. I mean, it is possible, by the way, something like that is possible, that reduced violence is a huge cultural breakthrough, et cetera. If we could replace a lot of competition for lands with competition for mines, and you might say, oh, well, but land really matters, and so on, so forth.
00:53:26.660 - 00:54:29.396, Speaker A: Some land matters, but a lot of land. Know, there's like this thing between, I think, Canada and Denmark, some contentious thing over some stupid island in the middle of nowhere. There's a so called condominium between, like, I think it's France, and a not a condominium in the normal term of a house, but like a co dominium, like an island thing. There's all kinds of stupid things that countries have fought battles over, which are like dumb, memetic pieces of land to fight battles over. And if we can pull people to a greater extent into caring about nfts, or not just nfts as of what they mean in 2021 or 2022, but if we can pull them more into thinking about digital things, and that's where more of the attention is going, then maybe less of the attention is going on physical things, and that means that conflict becomes virtualized and there's some progress there, at least. I'm not saying it's not nasty. It can be nasty at times, capitalism, there could be hostile takeovers.
00:54:29.396 - 00:55:07.140, Speaker A: Bad things can happen. But it's way better than war, right? And similarly, fighting over mines, I think Netnet is probably way better than fighting over lands. And look, I'm not saying that it's a panacea. I'm not saying that everything is going to go well. I mean, one part that I do talk about in the book a bit is that it's not just about human minds, because the chinese drone armada or something like that is coming where you don't have to convince humans anymore. They just can hit a button and they've got n drone soldiers ready to go. And so that also changes the calculus in a different way, where violence becomes easier to employ.
00:55:07.140 - 00:55:36.030, Speaker A: It's the opposite of the sovereign individual thesis, right? It's the autonomous robot thesis, whereas sovereign individual thesis says it's harder to have violence against humans if you can't steal the money. The autonomous robot thesis says, unfortunately, it's easier if you can manufacture the robots. So anyway, point being, I hold out hope that on some axes, we can reduce the level of violence by having the competition be over virtual rather than physical things, not a pollyanna about it.
00:55:40.240 - 00:56:19.150, Speaker C: I think that makes sense. I think I had a follow up question there. I think one of the key things I always think about generally at the protocol layer is the incentive design. And I feel like that's one of the key things. Even if you're building a network state or anything like that, or for joint networks of people to bring people together, you kind of need some kind of a common incentive design. So I think my follow up question here was a generally how do you think about that in the context of just generally like a network state, but also how do you think about incentive design in the context of defi protocols, for example, or you liked, you didn't like, or how would you think about future?
00:56:22.320 - 00:56:51.236, Speaker A: I'm a huge fan of capitalism, economics, incentives, all that type of stuff. However, I do think all that stuff comes second. And if you're talking about a community, the moral aspect, the moral innovation comes first. Let me talk about this for a sec. So I talk about this in the book. I call it the one commandment. And just to motivate this, if you've got a new startup company, then you have one focused innovation where you're improving on the market at large.
00:56:51.236 - 00:57:28.544, Speaker A: And if you don't focus, if you try to do a bunch of things, you're doing nothing, right. One thing is hard, to end things is impossible, right? With a startup community it's different. Your repeated action is not a unit economic sale of a good. You're not selling like Dropbox style space online, you're not selling a shrink wrap CD, you're not selling a Tesla. Instead, what you're selling effectively is community membership. Okay? Someone needs to join your community for them to join your community. You're going to find yourself describing how the community is different from the world.
00:57:28.544 - 00:58:13.080, Speaker A: And if it's not that different, then it's not really that attractive. The more different it is, the more of an innovation it is on the outside world, the more attractive it is. Now immediately our minds go to technological innovation. Oh, do you have self driving cars there? Stem cell treatment? Is it actually, you know, is something where, wow, can we actually build a house? Oh my God, that'd be the most amazing innovation ever in America. So there's a bunch of things you can immediately go to in terms of technological innovation, and those are all good and those are certainly part of the motivation for network states. But you can do quite a lot with just moral innovation. And I gave some examples in the book, I'll do two and haven't been in the book.
00:58:13.080 - 00:58:57.868, Speaker A: They'll go into b two, got a bunch more. So one example is, like, keto kosher. What that is, is it's a district where you have a bunch of people in their crowdfunding territory. Like, it could be towns, ranches, just like, enough space that it's like multiple families, maybe, I don't know, 2030, 5100 thousand, whatever number of families are just living there. What they do is they actually take sugar as a poison seriously, and they enforce a cordon sanitaire. They basically stop it at the border. And every restaurant, every grocery store, every meal within the borders of a keto kosher town or city or what have you, is sugar free.
00:58:57.868 - 01:00:14.272, Speaker A: So no high fructose corn syrup, no snickers bars to tempt you at the countertop, no sugar put into every meal of chinese food. But, like, american chinese food is totally different than chinese chinese food. All of that just cut out because the community helps you defend yourself and doesn't have to be an individual willpower thing of each person against some giant multinational, right? And meaning some giant multinational has figured out all these ways to erode, support individuals willpower when they're just standing at the checkout and they want to be on a diet, and they're faced with, for five minutes, like, step away from the peppermint patties, whatever it is, right? And so keto kosher is a way of actually trying to have the community come in and help people not consume sugar. Now, this thing alone is a moral innovation in and of itself. Someone who lived in a keto kosher district, once the crime of opportunity of sugar was taken away, they might drop 20 or 30 pounds. Inflammation would go down, diabetes would go down, obesity would go down, Covid would go down as a consequence, or any other disease, which obesity is like a contributing factor. All kinds of things would improve, but then, beyond that point, that moral innovation would lead to follow on moral innovations.
01:00:14.272 - 01:00:49.264, Speaker A: If sugar is bad, then continuous glucose monitors are probably good. So maybe everybody in town has a CGM and they're actually getting that readout of their glucose, and then they're seeing that, oh, this thing is actually triggering my spike in glucose levels, and this is bad. And maybe they go from there to more and more quantified self. And this is something where you go from one moral premise to a technological innovation of cgms to another moral premise, and so on. And this is what it actually like. Moral progress and technological progress. It didn't used to be.
01:00:49.264 - 01:01:35.948, Speaker A: You had these crazy preachers lecturing us in the pages of newspapers all the time on what is good and then separate from them in tech class instead. Those were like, actually the same. And the moral innovation was constrained by the tech innovation. For example, public health is a great example where the sanitation and the tech innovation went hand in hand with the moral principle of, like, cleanliness is next to godliness, okay? And so it used to be that those things went together and they can go together again. And so the thing is that the incentives that one is thinking about, yes, economic and are important. But if that's the only thing one is focusing on, and in fact, if that's the first thing one is focusing on, you will get a community of people who are like, when airdrop, have you ever seen idiocracy? You seen the movie idiocracy?
01:01:36.124 - 01:01:38.288, Speaker B: I haven't, but now I'm going to.
01:01:38.454 - 01:01:56.736, Speaker A: Okay, well, there's a scene there, you can google it. And the guy's like, wow, you like money, too? Me too. Oh, my God. Right? And the point of it, of course, is that money is universal barter. Everybody likes money. Everybody drinks water. It's not a distinguishing characteristic.
01:01:56.736 - 01:02:27.852, Speaker A: It's not a genuine basis for a community affiliation. All these dows that start with a token and have a bunch of people like, oh, I've got 15,000 people in my da. Yeah, well, they're there for an airdrop, and then they're going to leave and they're going to sell and whatever. It's not a real thing. The way to actually give permanent value to your community. Think about a spring in the middle of a village that doesn't run out, okay? That spring is like everlasting. That's your moral innovation.
01:02:27.852 - 01:02:53.816, Speaker A: It doesn't run out when there's money. The sugar free zone doesn't suddenly get sugar in there if times are tough, okay, like, economy can be down, economy can be up, but people are healthy. They're there for that. To give you some more examples, okay, another one I mentioned was like digital Sabbath. Okay? So look, I'm super online. I do a lot of things online, but I also like being offline. I actually print stuff out.
01:02:53.816 - 01:03:11.660, Speaker A: I have my math and my little pen notepads and stuff like that. And I'll just go totally offline. No one can reach me and just work offline. Right? Mark it all up. Sometimes I'll write longhand, many pages. Just go back and type it all in. Why distraction free? You can see the beautiful outdoors.
01:03:11.660 - 01:03:29.616, Speaker A: Laptops also don't really work in glare. And so what you can imagine is digital Sabbath. So now you've got a network archipelago, just like I mentioned before, like all of these towns and ranches and so on. And they have the convention that Internet goes off every day. 09:00 p.m. To 09:00 a.m.. Tada.
01:03:29.616 - 01:03:50.116, Speaker A: Now, you don't have any glowing screens at night. Everybody gets kind of the signal. Okay, time to go to sleep now. Jingua did this actually, in China, they just turned off the Internet at, like, I think it was like twelve midnight to 08:00 a.m. So people, all the kids couldn't play video games all night, right? They took away the temptation. Tada. No more infinite video games.
01:03:50.116 - 01:04:31.556, Speaker A: Kids went to sleep. Grades improved, at least, so it goes, right? Or at least that's the story. I'm not sure if it's true, worth diligencing, but that's a concept like digital Sabbath would allow people to. If they didn't want to surf all the time, the community would help them with their self control. Right? And the thing is, if you don't have self control, one thing I can talk about here is Mike Moritz has this concept, which is like, every startup should have one of the seven deadly sins. And he's saying this tongue in cheek, by the way, and I respect Mike and I respect sequoia and what they've built. And what he's basically saying, though, is that there's some visceral drive, right? Gluttony.
01:04:31.556 - 01:04:48.024, Speaker A: Okay? Does this get me food faster? I want food, right? Uber eats lust. Okay? That's tinder pride. Well, Instagram wrath. Well, that's Twitter, right? Sloth. Okay? That's delivery. Amazon prime, et cetera, et cetera. Now, of course, it's tongue in cheek.
01:04:48.024 - 01:05:27.048, Speaker A: Okay, what he means by that is a startup is so hard to get going that you need some visceral drive to get people to use it, and you need to satisfy that. And the problem is that the excess of that visceral drive are like these seven deadly sins. It's loss of self control. And the other problem is that when these companies go from small to really large, then now they're incentivized to actually exacerbate that thing beyond the level of, hey, I'm serving a visceral drive to. I'm actually incentivizing you to overeat, for example. Now, I want to be absolutely clear. This is not, like, really a tech thing or even solely a tech thing.
01:05:27.048 - 01:06:41.808, Speaker A: There's all these companies that other folks own, like Coca Cola, PEPC seas, candies, all these things chocolate, all this stuff predates tech okay. Tech is just really one of the versions of it where it's clear from beginning to the end. The thing is that an enormous part of american society, it's looked at through this lens, is like many, many companies can be slotted into one of the seven. It's like it's gambling or it's porn or it's food, like high calorie food or it's sugar, or it's trying to basically break down people's willpower in one way or another. Okay, so how can you actually combat something like that when the economic incentives are there, when there actually is a visceral drive, et cetera? And the opposite of it is like the seven cardinal virtues, right? So against sloth, I forget the exact one, but there's basically the self control versions of these verses of pride, there's humility and so on. And how would that react here? So I think a useful way of thinking about these one commandment communities is their way of doing a profitable vehicle where now you're saying, hey, let me have one of the seven cardinal virtues as one of the things I'm doing a moral innovation on. So now you reverse the polarities, right? You pull it back the other way.
01:06:41.808 - 01:07:24.748, Speaker A: Okay, so for example, keto Kosher is like the opposite of gluttony. And why do people join? Because they want the self control. And what is the business model? Well, for all of these startup societies that I'm describing, it's a new SaaS, it's society as a service. Now you can plug it into all of our existing models with churn and CaC and all this stuff, right? You've got all the matrices, everything that we know how to do with SAS, except your members are duping members of your community and now they're there for something that helps them with the seven cardinal virtues, for example. And by the way, that's like the catholic frame. You don't have to go with that. You can take religious things from other cultures.
01:07:24.748 - 01:07:48.100, Speaker A: Okay, I'm just using that because it's familiar to western society. I'll give you just two more. So I mentioned keto kosher. I mentioned digital Sabbath. Another one I put on Twitter is like keeping down with the Joneses. So now rather than keeping up with the Joneses, you're keeping prices down with the Joneses. How? Because you and the Joneses who are next door now start group buying essentials.
01:07:48.100 - 01:08:26.020, Speaker A: Not Groupon or. Not exactly Groupon. Groupon is like, oh, we're all going to go parachuting or skydiving. It's all not unnecessary, but mostly unnecessary consumer stuff. Okay? Instead, what you do is you and the Joneses and other people in town would figure out what are our essentials, whether it's gas or diapers, whatever it is, right? You bulk buy all those together. You buy them in bulk, and then the individualized stuff you buy separately. And the culture is now set to something that's more like lean fire, which is lean fire is like, I think it's retire early.
01:08:26.020 - 01:08:42.904, Speaker A: Financial independence. Retire early. Okay. And the concept here is frugality is the virtue. Again, the incentives here, even though that one is money related, the incentive there is to be part of a community that's helping you save money. All right, last example. This is a crazy one.
01:08:42.904 - 01:08:57.612, Speaker A: This is definitely not the kind of one I would be able to start, but I'd love to see it. This one I haven't talked about, but I think it's kind of funny. Just as an interesting thing, Idon Levin had a great tweet, which is like, what's the craziest one commandment that could start a community? I think there's crazier ones than this, but you want to hear an interesting one?
01:08:57.666 - 01:08:58.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:58.720 - 01:09:21.830, Speaker A: Okay. The formal wear society. Okay. Why? Because if you look at old movies or just old photos, people dressed really well. Really well, just out in public. And part of the reason is we didn't have all the comfortable cotton clothes and other stuff that we have today. Right.
01:09:21.830 - 01:10:07.968, Speaker A: But people, the thing is that to dress well, like suit and tie or skirt or whatever it is, there's kind of a whole supply chain with that. You can't just pull a t shirt and shorts and put it on. You have to. Okay, I got to iron my shirt and do this with the shoes, and how am I supposed to button to this and blah, blah, blah, all this stuff right now, as people who know me, I'm not the big formal wear person. On the other hand, the fact of getting that dressed up for somebody else sort of shows respect to them. Okay? And if you had a society of people who essentially said formal wear, okay, and had that expectation, again, it's all opt in. You're not imposing this on somebody.
01:10:07.968 - 01:10:45.740, Speaker A: And many people will be like, oh, my God, Balgi, you want to bring people back to suits? I'm like, no, I'd like to see this experiment because my hypothesis is people say, oh, an armed society would be a polite society. I actually kind of don't want people. I mean, look, teach their own, but I actually kind of don't want to walk around a neighborhood where everyone's holding ar 15s. However, one where, at least not pointed at me, however, one where everybody's wearing formal wear is a polite society, probably, right. They're probably having gone to that extent to dress up and look nice and so on. They're probably not going to all be as rude to each other. At least it's a thesis.
01:10:45.740 - 01:11:13.432, Speaker A: Okay. And I think as a function of that, they probably might also pay more attention to fitness and so on and so forth. Now, that doesn't mean, by the way, that you need to wear the same scratchy fabrics as the early 20th century. There's stuff, this is not an ad. I'm not an investor or anything like Mizzen and Maine, for example, is stuff that sort of feels like stretchy workout clothes stuff, but it looks like suit and tie. Right. And so there's stuff out there that's kind of the v three.
01:11:13.432 - 01:11:36.704, Speaker A: It has some of the aesthetics of the v one of, like, formal wear and the comfort of the v two, casual wear. But everybody doesn't look like a slob all the time or athleisure all the time. I love athleisure. As I said, this is not my community. It's just the kind of thing I'd like to see. Okay. And I have a feeling could be kind of, at a minimum, it would photograph really well and the people would look great and that would help with recruiting for the community.
01:11:36.704 - 01:11:42.770, Speaker A: And it's like the kind of aspirational thing people will want to be. Let me pause there.
01:11:43.220 - 01:12:06.104, Speaker B: Okay. First of all, I thought that I wanted to live in a society where we all wore sweats all the time. And now you have me questioning everything that I believed before based on this alone. Yeah, this is fascinating to me. And I'm going to have to get the name of that company with the comfortable clothing that's formal, again, from you.
01:12:06.142 - 01:12:18.844, Speaker A: But again, I'm not an investor in them or anything like that. Maybe they'll love it. It's just cool. It's just like stretchy pants. I think it's like Mizzn and Maine. M-A-N. I'm not sure if they're still in business.
01:12:18.844 - 01:12:21.260, Speaker A: I think they're still in business, last I checked. Go ahead.
01:12:21.410 - 01:12:44.550, Speaker B: All right. Well, yeah, I'll have to look them up. That is super cool. So we were talking earlier about how technology can be used to create new cities and new countries. And as a concept, you outlined seven steps that start with an online community and then materialize that community into the physical world. Can you outline those steps for us?
01:12:45.000 - 01:13:01.390, Speaker A: Sure. So they're written down at. If you go to thentworkstate.com and maybe you can paste this link, it's the network state and 1000 words. Okay, here, I will dm you. Or you can just find it. Let me just dm it to you.
01:13:05.430 - 01:13:06.546, Speaker B: All right, perfect.
01:13:06.728 - 01:13:30.502, Speaker A: Great. Let's just post that. So the seven steps are, number one, found a startup society. And the crucial thing is that you begin with the concept, with the idea that is powerful enough to start a country. You're not starting with the lands, you're starting with the minds. Okay. So a, you have the concept, the motivating thing, the one commandment that moral principle.
01:13:30.502 - 01:13:53.058, Speaker A: B, you use this to recruit people online and organize into a group that's actually capable of collective action. And again, this is not a Game of Thrones fan club. This is not somebody's Twitter followers which has 0.1% or whatever engagement. This is something which has close to 100% levels of engagement. When the community is asked to do something, it actually does it. And that's a very, very high bar.
01:13:53.058 - 01:14:41.338, Speaker A: If you can get people to do that, if you can get a thousand people to rt a tweet by one of their members when it's like a new product launch, or to go and test out their app and give them beta test feedback, and you actually have a thousand people actually do it, that's an extraordinarily high bar and may require new kinds of software. Maybe it's like Slack or discord, or maybe it's as different from Slack and discord as they were from Facebook. Just to digress on that, people thought that Facebook for enterprise would look like Facebook. It actually looked like Slack. And so it may turn out that the thing to build these highly aligned communities does not look like Slack or discord, but something qualitatively different. I think urban is cool, and that is like a decentralized slack. And you might be able to build on top of that, but the UX might not look like Slack or discord.
01:14:41.338 - 01:15:06.280, Speaker A: So number two is organized into a group capable of collective action. I call this a network union. And it's like a union, except it's not solely organized within a company for the purpose of sort of adversarial bargaining with the management. A network union can bargain not just with corporations, but with governments. It can group buy for people. It can also crowd invest. It's just more broad than simply a group of aggrieved employees under one company.
01:15:06.280 - 01:15:22.478, Speaker A: I'm not saying that sometimes companies don't do bad things. I think they do. Sometimes they will fire people for no cause. They'll cancel. I think one cheer for that kind of unionization. But this is a unionization that is across companies. So it's not simply adversarial within something.
01:15:22.478 - 01:15:51.542, Speaker A: It's a group of people working together. Okay. Online. All right, an example could be, for example, a guild of graphic designers or a guild of electrical engineers. 1000 people who are part of this guild, they pay dues, they show up again. We talked about the 100 billion years of history, of all the years, 100 billion lifetimes, right? And all those configurations of human beings that work, just like configurations of star systems in space. These are configurations of human beings in time.
01:15:51.542 - 01:16:02.874, Speaker A: One thing we know that works are guilds. Guilds worked in the past. They will probably work again. Okay, so you organize into a group capable of collective action. Number three. Now you go offline, you start holding meetups offline. You don't have to go to the step, by the way.
01:16:02.874 - 01:16:15.726, Speaker A: Some things will be fine as network unions. You could just have a digital guild. It could stop at digital only, just like as a small business. Not every small business has to grow into Google to be successful. Many things can stop at network unions. They'd be very great as network unions. That's fine.
01:16:15.726 - 01:16:53.034, Speaker A: If you want to go the next step, then step three is meet offline, build trust, start building a crypto economy. Now is when the incentives start to come in. Why? Because. So to your question, the reason that we're going to need, actually, I wasn't sure if it was Varun or Nick who asked the question, but let's say it's Brune, okay? The reason that now is when the incentives come in is because once you start getting lots of people doing collective action, invariably there'll be some who do more than others and some who do less. There's always variance. Not everybody's going to hit the button. Exactly.
01:16:53.034 - 01:17:26.914, Speaker A: So what do you do with that variance? That's where tokenization comes in, in my view. There's this internal labor economy of the group, of the community, and this token becomes the currency of that economy. Stack overflow has a version of this with karma where people answer questions and they get karma for it, and they spend karma on getting other people to answer questions. And there's also a leaderboard where if you hold a lot of karma, you're at the top of that leaderboard. This was a big thing in the early think, sure, community now, or whatever. But it was useful to kind of populate all kinds of answers for different things. And they just didn't really have any tokenomics.
01:17:26.914 - 01:17:45.834, Speaker A: They had status tokenomics, not money tokenomics. They were giving out leaderboard and recognition. But that's also a thing, right? Status and incentives are like money incentives. It's like the y axis alongside x axis. When you think about economics, you don't need to go to money right away. Status might do it, or some combination of status and money or something else. Okay? But that's something to think about.
01:17:45.834 - 01:18:09.762, Speaker A: All right, so step three, you're meeting offline. You're building the crypto economy online. Step four, this is a huge step. Now you've got a community. They're meeting online constantly and offline, they're capable of collective action. They've got a crypto economy. Now you can actually a collective action that's way bigger than all of you liking a tweet or testing an app for somebody.
01:18:09.762 - 01:18:48.558, Speaker A: That collective action is not 1000 people liking a tweet or rting something. It's 1000 people who are actually buying territory around the world. Maybe in one place, maybe in 50 different places, maybe in 20, but starting to cluster together. This already, again, is happening with group houses and something in the Bay area. This is happening with people moving in with roommates and stuff, but this would be systematized. And when they made that move, once you've got just two people clustering together, they're flying the flag of your community in their room or outside their house or on their ranch or in their cul de sac or even in their small town that they group bought together. Okay? This moves it out of the digital world into the physical world.
01:18:48.558 - 01:19:13.730, Speaker A: This is what I called a network archipelago. Just like the concept of an archipelago, which is a bunch of islands that are, like, separated by ocean. This is a bunch of islands of territory separated by Internet. But they all log on to the dashboard every day, and they see the population numbers of their growing community increase. It grows by immigration and also by birth and reproduction, but more slowly, obviously. That's like an 18 year timescale. It's slower than migration.
01:19:13.730 - 01:19:56.174, Speaker A: Right. Okay, two more steps. Once you've gotten digital, I'm just kind of combining some things, but once you've got a digital community that is distributed in this way. I mentioned this, there's a conference recently, there'll be a talk online about this soon, but I talked about this concept of the on chain census. This will be an important application, I think, of crypto oracles, to prove that your decentralized, state like thing, your network archipelago, is as big as you say it is? Because in theory, you could just fake the numbers. Why don't you say you have 1500 people and tons of land? Who is to know? So I outline and just simply putting it on chain doesn't true. It makes the metadata hard to fake.
01:19:56.174 - 01:20:10.506, Speaker A: The who, what and when of who posted it. The who being the digital signature, the what being the hash, the when being the Timestamp. Those are hard to falsify. But all the other things, that's just metadata. The data could be false. The photo itself could be fake. It's just that we know you posted it at this time.
01:20:10.506 - 01:20:48.278, Speaker A: So how do we know that when you're reporting on chain that you have this many people or this much land? That's actually true. So I described in a recent talk on the on chain census, an auditing process. And there's different ways of doing this. But, for example, if you're reporting that you have 10,000 citizens, netizens of your network, state or sarge society online, somebody could go and sample, let's say it's 10,000 ETH names. Someone could go and sample, let's say 100 of them, random sample. And then you go and independently verify, and you're looking for your mismatched statistics. Okay, so meaning all four possibilities are there.
01:20:48.278 - 01:20:57.170, Speaker A: They're reported to be human. You think they're human. They're reported to be human. You think they're not. They're reported to be non human. You think they are. They're reported to be non human and you think they're not.
01:20:57.170 - 01:21:44.470, Speaker A: You can form the two by two contingency table, calculate chi squared, whatever you want to do. Look at the mismatches. And if you're seeing, for example, three fake accounts among 100 that you test, you can start extrapolating as to what is the sampling distribution of the. What is the probability that there's many more fake accounts than the whole thing? You might just do the simple, naive estimator, which is okay, if three out of 100 that I sampled were fake, then of your 10,000 citizens reported, maybe only 9700 are real, but 3% are off. That's still not so bad, right? Maybe you've got 9700 real people. So that's step five. Six, conduct an on chain census, prove that your site is big.
01:21:44.470 - 01:22:19.550, Speaker A: Why am I focusing on the census so much? Because that leads to the last step, which is gaining diplomatic recognition. Now, this seems like a weird thing, right? Hey, don't libertarians just want their. So, first of all, I wouldn't identify as libertarian just to preempt that line. But this is actually crucial. Why is it crucial? Because if progressives don't get the reason for starting new countries, libertarians don't get the concept of why you need diplomatic recognition. So I'll explain this. Basically, diplomatic recognition is like a non binding commitment to not invade.
01:22:19.550 - 01:23:08.926, Speaker A: I mean, it's more than that, but it's that at a minimum. Okay, why do I say non binding? Well, the US will invade whatever country it wants and other countries may decide to do that. Like France is constantly operating in its former colonies or know. But with that know, obviously Russia is invading its know countries, whatever. So with that said, it's an international incident when this happens, it's a big deal, right? If you have a diplomatically recognized country, then another nation going over its borders is a big deal, at least according to the country that diplomatically recognized it. And to contrast this with, say, something like Sealand or liberland, which I think are interesting, these micronations. But fundamentally, if a bunch of UK special forces or whatever, land on sea land, nobody cares.
01:23:08.926 - 01:23:39.398, Speaker A: It's not actually a violation of sovereignty. They're not diplomatically recognized by anybody. It's just like some random guys. Whereas if they did that in, I don't know, Kirabadi even a small country, that would actually be a big deal. Right? So diplomatic recognition, why is that important? Means that at least one other entity has recognized that your people don't just collectively own this land, but that they are sovereign over it. There isn't a higher authority above them. Now of course, sovereignty is on a continuum.
01:23:39.398 - 01:24:06.706, Speaker A: You're not going to be able to do anything. You're not going to be able to build. Like if you're building nuclear plants, there'd probably be people who get mad at that at the beginning. But there's probably things you can do now, like self driving car cities or stem cell treatments or things like that. Okay? Now, diplomatic recognition won't come all at once. It will take time, but we know it's possible. Why? Because Wyoming, for example, is diplomatically recognized.
01:24:06.706 - 01:24:33.690, Speaker A: Ethereum, that's its Dow law. You can form companies on chain and have them recognized, right? At least there's v one out there. El Salvador famously has recognized bitcoin as a national currency. So as a central african republic there's some like pushback or whatever. But this ratchet is happening and that's more general than that. Tubaloo has done deals for the tv domain, Godaddy, Columbia with the dot co domain. Nevada did deal with Tesla for the Geiger factory.
01:24:33.690 - 01:25:03.480, Speaker A: Amazon did deal with Virginia for hq. Two, Google was doing a deal with sidewalk labs or with Toronto for sidewalk labs that failed. But the concept was there. Right? And Boeing moved to South Carolina. Point being that there are entities that have been able to successfully negotiate with countries and states and cities, and that would be what the process of diplomatic recognition looks like now. It's a continuum. Again, I'm not saying you just get it and then you get it from everybody.
01:25:03.480 - 01:25:46.418, Speaker A: If you look, diplomatic recognition, there's some countries that are recognized by everybody. There's some countries know Israel is still working on it. They just got some major breakthrough with the Abraham Accords. Right. And so it won't be like total walk in the park, but it is possible, I think, just like there is a cryptocurrency fiat currency exchange that turned out to be way more important than people thought. People thought cryptocurrency could just bootstrap itself. And people forget in 2011, 2012 how controversial, in a sense, crypto exchanges were, because something like Coinbase, well, you've got bank accounts there, and you've got fiat currency and it's custodial and you've got password, everything about bitcoin.
01:25:46.418 - 01:26:19.200, Speaker A: But it did provide that crucial bridge to the offline world. In a sense, the offline financial system was like diplomatically recognizing the on chain system and building a bridge there where interchange back and forth could happen. And that back and forth of fiat crypto is a huge part of what bootstrap crypto. And in the same way, that interface between fiat currency and cryptocurrency, we could have an interface between a fiat country and cryptocountry. And that's what diplomatic recognition of a network state looks like. That's the last step.
01:26:19.650 - 01:26:27.922, Speaker B: Okay, my next question, which you answered on your own, my last question, because I don't know how much time you have.
01:26:27.976 - 01:26:31.154, Speaker A: Yeah, we should wrap up last. Why don't we make this last one? Last one.
01:26:31.272 - 01:26:43.080, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So my last question, and I'd love to have a longer conversation later, but my last question is, what is the role of social media in all of this?
01:26:44.250 - 01:27:30.134, Speaker A: What is the role of social media? Well, I think what happens is your social media, your cryptocurrency, your city, your country, these are different layers of the stack that are starting to get integrated. For example, like El Salvador recognizing bitcoin. Right. Or Google is powering a lot of stuff for various governments, at a minimum, their email, their communications. But obviously, Twitter is the public broadcast system for all the politicians of the world, huge percentage of people's population. Many countries populations were thrown on Facebook. Like when Zuck met with David Cameron several years ago, he was like the CEO of this gigantic 3.3
01:27:30.134 - 01:28:15.506, Speaker A: something billion person network and the CEO of a tiny 60 person social network, 60 million person social network called the United Kingdom. I mean, I'm joking, of course, because it's more than that, but at least in sheer scale. So I think social networks are still under. I mean, they're an important thing, but they've become like a subroutine, right? In the sense of social network functionality plus cryptocurrency functionality equals a digital economy. And then if you add like the offline real estate, all these things that have kind of worked in individual company form, because it's really hard to get them to work in the first place. Once they've worked as an individual company, they become an open source product, and then you can stand that up, and once that works, then you can take one open source product and another another and package them together into a social operating system. And that's, I think, where the future is.
01:28:15.506 - 01:28:25.720, Speaker A: It's not just the social network with the liking and the poking. You have the cryptocurrency built into it. So you've got the paying and the contracting, you get the land, and so you have the building of the living.
01:28:26.730 - 01:28:42.480, Speaker B: Right. But I also feel like when we talk about communities, I feel like they're all being built on social networks. What is the role in that sense? What kind of leaders do we.
01:28:44.690 - 01:28:50.418, Speaker A: So, meaning basically communities are being built off of Twitter or Facebook or something like that. Is that what you mean?
01:28:50.504 - 01:29:11.590, Speaker B: Yeah, or like Facebook groups where there's a common thread there, I see a lot of, in terms of what you're saying, even with the example that you gave no sugar society. Or like, there's literally Facebook groups that are dedicated to concepts like.
01:29:11.660 - 01:29:53.954, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, right, exactly. So I think there's a lot of ripe fruit that could be plucked and turned into. Not all of them will convert in this way, but it's a little bit like academia, right? You have a bunch of people who were researching various machine learning things over the last decade. A bunch of them got pulled into Google and Facebook and other places, and we saw those theories became practice. And that was like a lot of the breakthroughs in AR from that, and a lot of the cryptography professors, networking professors, distributed computing professors have now gone and started cryptocurrencies. And not all the necessarily work, but that's really great. So called lead gen, right? Those are ripe fruit.
01:29:53.954 - 01:30:41.182, Speaker A: You should pluck those, see what happens. And I think quite a few of these communities, lots of subreddits, lots of Facebook groups, maybe bulletin boards and forums, things like that. A lot of those. And crucially, by the way, I think the distinguishing thing of a Facebook group or a subreddit is they have a moderator, right? They have admins, they have things that are on topic and off topic. They have the rudiments of digital borders. And what that means is that when you nftify them, those rudiments become a little less arbitrary and also enforced in a somewhat different manner because it's on chain, you've got now, like a digital passport, you can program against it. It's not simply the discretion of the admin alone.
01:30:41.182 - 01:31:17.440, Speaker A: It is something where the admin grants that NFT, maybe they have revoke access on it. You can have different groups with different standards on that, but it just kind of up levels the concept of that digital boundary around the community being key, as opposed to the general scrum of global Facebook or the general scrum of global Reddit. Right? And so those like ripe fruit, those leads, I don't know, if you take ten of them, maybe one of them produces, like, a good Starbuck society, and then you take 100, maybe one of those produces a network archipelago. I don't know the exact conversion ratio. I'm just making up those numbers. But I do think that those are a good place to start.
01:31:18.930 - 01:31:44.340, Speaker B: All right, well, Balaji, thank you so much. This has been fascinating. I'm going to test my iq and get back to you on how much it has gone up. I'm sure everyone, this has been the Defi state brought to you by hashflow to listen in on the next episode. Follow myself and follow hashflow. Varun, any last words?
01:31:46.350 - 01:31:57.820, Speaker C: This was phenomenal. Again, Balaji, thank you so much for making this happen. I know we've been planning this for a while, so I'm super glad this worked out finally. So looking forward to more of these.
01:31:58.350 - 01:32:00.220, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you, guys.
01:32:02.030 - 01:32:03.080, Speaker C: All right, thank you.
