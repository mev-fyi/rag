00:00:00.890 - 00:00:07.694, Speaker A: Jason, welcome. We're so happy that you're okay and with us. How are you?
00:00:07.732 - 00:00:08.302, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:00:08.356 - 00:00:08.526, Speaker C: Hey.
00:00:08.548 - 00:00:09.680, Speaker B: Can you hear me okay?
00:00:10.930 - 00:00:12.222, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you hear me okay?
00:00:12.276 - 00:00:13.200, Speaker B: Yes, I can.
00:00:15.490 - 00:00:51.440, Speaker A: All right, perfect. Well, I'm going to do a formal intro for you. Our special guest, Jason Choi is here. Th Jason is founder of Tangent Capital and formerly was at Spartan Capital, where he helped grow their $10 million fund into a 300 million plus fund. He's also host of the Block Crunch podcast, which is and has been the number one crypto native research podcast since 2018. Jason, welcome and so happy to have you.
00:00:52.530 - 00:00:55.200, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks so much, Nicole. Happy to be on.
00:00:56.130 - 00:00:58.720, Speaker A: Oh, my God. What happened?
00:00:59.570 - 00:01:12.660, Speaker D: I think there was a mix up in the time. I think Jason's Hong Kong time was 10:00 a.m. And I think that east coast was like 10:00 p.m. But instead I think we kind of set it to 09:00 p.m., yeah, that makes sense.
00:01:13.910 - 00:01:37.850, Speaker A: There are a lot of mix ups like that. There are a lot of mix ups like that. But so excited to have you. Let's get right into it. I wanted to talk a little bit about dows with you and what makes them interesting and what you've seen that you think is really different and stands.
00:01:41.710 - 00:01:44.160, Speaker C: Like just for daos in general.
00:01:44.610 - 00:02:22.860, Speaker D: Yeah. Jason, I think to give a bit more context, I think I was telling Nicole about last week's conversation in terms of when we were chatting about hashwest itself and the positioning of how we were sort of tapping into dows and gamefly and so on. You just want to pick your brains to see what are the interesting things you've seen in Dow and other interesting ideas or what has worked, what hasn't worked or what generally makes them interesting in your opinion, especially given that you've been, I feel like you're a Dow connoisseur and you've been really in the space in the weeds. So I feel like you'll have interesting insights here.
00:02:23.630 - 00:03:12.486, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think, to me, I think dows are most useful if they're treated as almost like digital spvs. So if they have a very specific purpose in a very specific time, then they're useful if they're very generic, like a general investment type of dow. I tend to see a lot of kind of free writing, and I don't think they actually work that well. So to give some examples, for instance, obviously, if it's a Dow around a specific project, then it makes a lot of sense, but also kind of dows around specific themes where you group people with a certain type of specific skill set around a specific interest. I think those make a lot of sense as well. So for tangent, for instance, we are involved with a Dao called goblin Sachs.
00:03:12.486 - 00:04:00.970, Speaker C: So they are one of the first, I think, two dows in the world that only focuses on NFT finance. So they're a bunch of people who are really deep in the weeds and really passionate about it. And they're basically kind of providing liquidity, starting with protocols like NFT Phi, which is a lending protocol for NFT finance. And their whole thesis is, hey, we're going to find some of the smartest people in the world who are involved with NFTs and Defi, and we're going to figure out how do we create products or how do we create strategies around finance. So it's a pretty kind of general mandate around a very specific topic with a very specific group of people. So I think those type of ideas make a lot of sense. Another example is the constitution, Dow right? So it was created for a very specific purpose to basically buy the constitution.
00:04:00.970 - 00:04:24.370, Speaker C: And then another example is like people pleaser, which was also created for a very specific purpose, which was to purchase these kind of digital art with a group of collectors with common interests. So I think the more specific it is with the more similar people, the better it is. And usually the more general the DAO is, the worse the engagement.
00:04:26.630 - 00:04:56.540, Speaker D: Think. I feel like a while back, I thought like a special form of VC fund in many ways, or I can work a decentralized VC firm of sorts where you had people with a certain thesis around what to invest in, and then they basically collaborated and voted on what kind of things to fund and whatnot. But I feel like obviously that definition has evolved. I wonder if that's the right way to think about that or if you had a different opinion there.
00:04:57.150 - 00:05:55.182, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's probably a pretty good way to describe what we're seeing right now. It's basically a bunch of people who have a specific mandate for a pool of capital. So it's more similar to a special purpose vehicle constructed for a specific investment. I'm of two minds about kind of generic investment vc dows, basically, where you have a bunch of people pull together money and invest in whatever in crypto. I think it kind of made sense in the early days of crypto because it was so small and so specific. But now that there are so many different investment vehicles for crypto with many dedicated full time teams, it's a little bit harder for, I think dows to compete, especially because you still need, I think, a pretty corporate structure for funds to remain relevant. And with Daos, it's too easy for there to be a free rider problem.
00:05:55.182 - 00:06:34.650, Speaker C: And that's something that we thought a lot about when we were starting tangent. We were discussing whether we wanted to turn this into a dow where everybody has kind of just tokenized votes and we really just kind of vote on all the investments together, or do we want to create a more traditional fund structure and what we ended up is somewhere in the middle where we all pool our own capital together and invest in investing our time and capital in companies, but we're also not really a dow. There's like internal processes that resemble a fund. So myself and my partner really drive a lot of the initiatives internally to make sure that there's no free riders, that we're all kind of pulling our own weight.
00:06:36.510 - 00:06:48.110, Speaker D: Question to you there, actually, Nicole. Sorry, I'm just going to have one more question before I let you ask. So how do you guys see the Dow voting emerge? Because I think one of the interesting.
00:06:48.180 - 00:06:48.800, Speaker C: Things.
00:06:52.770 - 00:07:49.970, Speaker D: Obviously not in your case, but voting is like one of the critical aspects of running a Dow, obviously. And then what you don't want is sometimes like hostile voting takeover or pass bad proposals. At the same time, you also don't want to have ultra centralization where only few people make all the decisions. But then that kind of kills the purpose of the DAO. So have you seen any interesting ways to structure these voting mechanisms within the Dow or Dow governance that allow for multiple people to partake in a democratic way? And yet you're able to kind of have these guardrails that allow for the functioning to be a lot smoother. Because I had some interesting ideas with hashwares. But before I talk about those things, I wanted to hear your guys'thoughts on any interesting experiments you've seen or structures that go beyond just everyone gets to vote kind of structure?
00:07:50.870 - 00:08:57.318, Speaker C: Yeah. So I don't know if I've seen this in practice yet, but like, two ways that I could think of is one, maybe you have a nonlinear way of scaling votes. So instead of one token, one vote. Maybe if you have ten tokens instead of ten votes, you have eight votes. And if you have 100 tokens, you maybe have like 70 votes so that you kind of skew towards the smaller guys, or at least don't give too much voting power to, say, large vc funds or like the founding team in the beginning. I think another pretty neat idea is obviously this concept of soul bound tokens where you can grant non transferable nfts that are tied to maybe how active an address has been in terms of previous votes or engagement on discord or community forums, and then they can maybe be granted maybe two extra weight of votes if they're deemed by the community to be high value contributors. But that's a little bit harder to create just because it requires a history of active governance and also it requires a pretty new standard.
00:08:57.318 - 00:09:08.170, Speaker C: But I've seen a lot of discussions around that. I personally haven't seen actual implementation of that, but maybe I just didn't come across it. Maybe it's already done out there somewhere, actually.
00:09:08.240 - 00:09:23.890, Speaker D: Might be a good question for users, actually, or everyone in the chat, rather. What is the soul bound? How does that concept work? Perhaps refreshing on that. And I was also curious to hear, because you know Project Galaxy, right?
00:09:24.040 - 00:09:24.738, Speaker C: Yes.
00:09:24.904 - 00:09:46.600, Speaker D: So I think they have something called Galaxy ids that they use to kind of track people's social aspects and so on. So they're basically building a way to map actual data to user activities and tie them to public keys. And I was curious if the soulbound concept is similar or is it different or how do they differ?
00:09:47.610 - 00:10:21.214, Speaker C: Yes, it's quite similar. I think the big differentiator for soulbound tokens is that they're non transferable. So you can Sibyl. So for like, if you have an NFT badge for participating in governance on a certain protocol, you could technically send that NFT badge or sell that NFT badge to someone else for soulbound tokens. The reason why it's called soulbound is because it's bound to your address, basically. So you cannot transfer it. It's almost like a credential that follows you around, like your college degree, for instance.
00:10:21.214 - 00:11:14.130, Speaker C: You can't really sell your college degree to someone else. So that's basically what it means. And I'm familiar with Project Galaxy. We did an interview with them on my podcast pretty recently, and we wrote a pretty extensive report on them for our blockchains newsletter. And we did talk about the Haskell case study, which I thought was really interesting because I think that there was very material increase in adoption and usage because of that engagement, which I thought was really interesting. So people really care about these type of statuses and engagement on chain, and I think that is almost like creating a very web3 native type of user acquisition channel that it doesn't really exist in web two to this extent. So yeah, pretty excited about the project and really excited to see how well they did with hashflow.
00:11:14.870 - 00:12:14.646, Speaker D: I was going to say, I think NFT is that it's a great way to have user acquisition and also just brand building more broadly. Which is also why last year we decided to experiment with Project Galaxy and see what happens. So we were like, we don't have tokens, but we also do not want to prematurely launch tokens. But on the other hand, we could technically experiment with nfts and see if that allows us to sort of build a character and give a bit more personality to the brand itself. So that was kind of the initial motivation to experiment and see what happens at Project Galaxy. And that turned out to be really the outcome of that was really positive. So that kind of evolved into, now what we see is the broader hash verse where you're really applying the combination of a game design with nfts and then turning that into story driven Dow governance model that we kind of talked about earlier before you joined the think.
00:12:14.646 - 00:12:21.990, Speaker D: I think I'll stop there. Nicole, if you had any questions there, please chime in. Or Jason, you can throw any comments.
00:12:23.310 - 00:12:35.440, Speaker A: Mean my questions are always in a completely different direction. Jason, you mentioned free writing earlier when talking about dows. How do you prevent that?
00:12:36.850 - 00:13:27.006, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think it's pretty, maybe two major ways to prevent that, but one is self selection, self curation of the community. So instead of, it's a little bit against the dow ethos, obviously, but if you create some sort of high barrier to entry, for instance, maybe a pretty high entry price. So like flamingo Dow, I forgot how expensive it is to be a part of that right now. But it's definitely not cheap or just involve a very small group of people in the beginning. So for instance, like Goblin Sachs, everybody involved has a pretty active, assigned role. So actually in the beginning they had a similar problem where there wasn't a very clear hierarchy and structure. So it wasn't very clear, at least externally what everyone was working on.
00:13:27.006 - 00:14:14.942, Speaker C: And then they had a community proposal afterwards to assign very specific roles and work streams and create more of a corporate structure. So yeah, I think that's solution number one is having a more curated group of people. And solution number two kind of ties into that as well, is to create actually more corporate structure in the early days. So I'm a strong believer in progressive decentralization. I honestly think if you create a project before you hit product market fit and you aggressively decentralize because of maybe your regulation fears, then you basically kill your project because you're going to end up having to manage a pre product market fit private company. The way that you would manage a public company with a stock that's trading on an exchange. So I think that's a horrible idea.
00:14:14.942 - 00:14:51.514, Speaker C: But at the same time, I understand the sentiment that founders might have for being worried about regulations and wanting to decentralize as quickly as possible. But I do think the optimal path is to be a more conventional startup kind of corporate structure where you have a dedicated team full time working on it before you decentralize. So I think a good example of that is probably maker, which didn't really fully decentralize or dissolve the foundation until they already became the market leader for stablecoins. For decentralized stablecoins by far. So I think that's a playbook that people can really look to.
00:14:51.712 - 00:15:04.560, Speaker D: Does maker even have an organization right now? I feel like they dissolved everything, right? Like they basically have people, they're operating as small spvs, but I don't know if there's a maker necessarily, or maybe I'm wrong there.
00:15:04.930 - 00:15:50.060, Speaker C: Yeah, they dissolved the foundation, I think, maybe a year and a half ago. Time's kind of blurring together, but yeah, they dissolved it a while back. And it's interesting, right, because now they have all these core units that are funded by a central treasury working on different ideas, and there's so much bureaucracy right now, and a lot of people are kind of voting against proposals. It's so hard to push things forward, which might actually be a feature and not a bug, because for a mature and reasonably sized project like maker, you probably don't want to be innovating super quickly, especially with so much money at stake, whereas in the early stage, you probably want to be moving faster. So imagine if they did this kind of core unit thing at the very beginning with no kind of central command, then they wouldn't have gotten anything done.
00:15:50.990 - 00:16:51.278, Speaker D: No, absolutely. In that rain. That's been our strategy as well, where maybe until now we've been doing most of the work with hash versus the first step towards decentralization. And over time, let's see how it proceeds. So some interesting ideas I was having around governance is what you could do is it's sort of like the US governance structure in many ways, where you have people, they vote on certain things, or anyone can propose a bill and then people vote on that. And then once it has passed through the voting, then it has to go to one final layer where the senate has to approve the bill for it to be really applied. I wonder if that kind of structure could work in crypto as well, where there are certain proposals that anyone can propose, and then everyone with voting power can vote on them.
00:16:51.278 - 00:17:23.500, Speaker D: And then you have a third layer of protection just to protect against any hostile votes. And then if things seem reasonable, then you can call them the guardians or something like that. They can just approve the vote. I wonder if that kind of structure could be applied here. I don't know if it's necessarily be seen as centralized or decentralized. Perhaps you can also centralize that further by adding, let's say, more people at the guardian level. But curious to hear your thoughts on such a design.
00:17:24.670 - 00:18:07.506, Speaker C: Yeah. So when it comes to social consensus like this, I think it really comes down to, ironically, trust. Right. How much faith and trust the community has in the team that is assigned as guardians, because you could have situations like with phalaps, which is the tribe token. A while ago when they decided to kind of when they got hacked and they were deciding whether to pay back victims, I remember they ran a vote with the community about whether they should use the treasury funds to refund victims. And I believe the vote went majority positive. So basically community wanted them to refund hack victims.
00:18:07.506 - 00:18:54.866, Speaker C: But then at the end, the team basically decided to unilaterally scrap that vote and not do that. And then that caused a lot of backlash. And then obviously later on, they decided to evaluate the risk and reward and decided, okay, actually we should pay back the heck victim. So I believe they moved forward with that. But the risk still exists where if the team has the power to overturn the will of the community, then it could cede a lot of, I guess, discontent within a community. So I think for a model like that to work, the team needs to be very much in touch with the community and really not veto anything unless it is very outright malicious. Like, if someone is trying to take over the entire protocol and they clearly have malicious intent, then it makes sense to veto.
00:18:54.866 - 00:19:03.290, Speaker C: But I think things like the Guardians vetoing it should probably be an really extremely rare exception, actually.
00:19:03.360 - 00:19:28.020, Speaker D: On that note, did the Faye team initially tell people that they will have the power to veto, or. It seemed like they passed a proposal, then the team didn't like it, and then they were like, oh, let's just do this one more time. Or was it more like people were already aware that Faye team had the power to veto if they didn't like something and they could redo things? I wasn't sure if that was the case.
00:19:28.390 - 00:20:17.250, Speaker C: Yeah. At least to me, it wasn't very explicitly clear that they had the power to do that. But then, I guess de facto, you kind of assume that, okay, the team holds, you can see how many tokens the team holds, you know, how many tokens a 16 z or other venture funds hold. So you kind of know that, okay, at least in the early days, it probably is a pretty centralized process, which goes back to my initial point, which I think that's probably the right thing to do. But that's why it's hard if you're trying to convince your community that hey, there's value in your votes and you should be voting on these proposals, but that at the same time you're still running the company in a more centralized phase, pre decentralization, then you have to really communicate that upfront and be clear about that. Otherwise you could lead to some confusion, like the situation we saw with Faye.
00:20:17.990 - 00:21:03.380, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. On that note, is it even such a bad, the other question it possesses, right. If it's even such a bad thing to actually not have, at least during the early days, have the team and the investors have slightly more power to guide the direction the decisions, particularly because they are likely to be the ones who have the most vested interest and know the product inside out. Perhaps it makes sense to have them guide the initial direction, or set the direction, at least before handing it over to the greater community, as opposed to starting in a full anarchist mode, which could also work. I don't know. I think there are a few projects which may have actually worked that way, but just food for thought.
00:21:04.630 - 00:21:37.814, Speaker C: Yeah. I think anarchist mode is always not a good idea to launch a project. It feels good to have this quote unquote community engagement in day one, but it's very hard to curate the community because you have people who just want the token to pump. You have people who are actually caring about the product or the team direction. But then it's very hard to filter through all of that noise in the early days when you're still trying to find product market fit. So I think anarchist mode definitely is not recommended. And I'm sure there are massive exceptions.
00:21:37.814 - 00:22:36.442, Speaker C: But just think of how many community quote unquote community forks there were of uniswap, of curve, of compound, of ave out there. Virtually none of them have their full team still intact, and none of them have really rifled the existing incumbent that's run by say like venture backed teams or kind of straight up startups running these protocols. So I think it sounds like a good narrative in a bull market and the tokens pump and it seems like everything is going great. But at the end of the day, I don't think community oriented forks make sense as a business model in the early days, and a lot of people take a very binary view of decentralization. It's either decentralized from day one or it's not. But I don't think that is realistic at all. At the end of the day, most of the people who use a protocol will use it because it's useful.
00:22:36.442 - 00:23:09.020, Speaker C: They won't use it because, wow, the team holds x percent of the tokens, or VC holds x percent of the tokens. Like 99% of the users will not care about that. The only people who care about that are maybe some traders who want to show a certain community narrative and watch prices go up, or some diehard anarchists who are incredibly purist who don't want any involvement from any capitalistic agents, which to me makes no sense if the goal is to build products that people use and scale products.
00:23:10.590 - 00:24:30.226, Speaker D: I think I kind of resonate with your thoughts a lot there, right? I think generally the way I think about this is practicality is everything. You can always have a purist approach, but usually I think at the end of the day, you're building products for people to use, and if you cannot deliver on that, then everything else is futile, right? So essentially you're building something that people can use or it's useful, and then if that's what it's doing, then everything else is going to fall into place. But if your core PMF is non existent, then everything else you do is kind of immaterial, right? It's not going to really change anything. I think that absolutely makes sense. So, speaking of pmfs and apart market fits and interesting designs, again, I think in this space we want to talk more about the dows and interesting Dow concepts and so on. And we've talked about hashwars and such. I was curious to hear, where do you think or see this narrative play out? Because I think there's been a bunch of tweets about 2021 was the dows, and then now there's a multichain, or at least now this is the gamefly, and then the next narrative is going to be app chains and so on.
00:24:30.226 - 00:24:42.200, Speaker D: I was curious to hear, what do you think is happening right now and where do you think the overall crypto narrative is going and how do you think it's going to shape up in the next bull market?
00:24:43.690 - 00:25:24.078, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's something that is always interesting to me. Right. Crypto is so narrative driven that you have waves of just speculation in very specific verticals, sometimes for no reason at all, sometimes for reasons completely unrelated to fundamentals. So obviously I have to pay attention to what the narratives are, but I try to kind of ignore the waves that are happening when I'm making long term bets and invest in the undercurrent. So things that are having secular growth. So I think one of the things that is still having secular growth is NFT finance.
00:25:24.078 - 00:25:58.814, Speaker C: So even in this bear market, we're seeing a lot more zero to one type of thinking. I'm not saying there are products that have achieved product market fit, but at least it reminds me a lot of d five back in 2020, and a lot of teams are really trying novel ideas. So, like pseudoswap is a pretty interesting idea. NFT Phi, where I'm an angel investor, is the market leader for NFT lending right now. We looked at projects like putty finance, which is a pretty interesting options protocol for NFTs. So a lot of experimentation in that area. So the volumes have obviously come down 99% from the speculative top.
00:25:58.814 - 00:27:18.902, Speaker C: But I think in terms of development, that's something that is still happening. I think in general, DFI itself is having almost like an existential moment. So DFI has actually entered a bear market before the general crypto bear market already, because it had this massive speculative narrative wave back in 2020, and since then it's been kind of on a downtrend, both TvL wise, volume wise, and price wise for a lot of projects. So I think it's trying to find out. I think DFI is trying to figure out one thing, which is now that we've built all these blocks, these building blocks for people to trade, to lend, we've built all these oracles and stuff, what should people actually be trading and lending on then? Is it just defi tokens or is it other stuff? And I think now there is some inkling that there should be a union between the new people who have brought into crypto by nfts who just didn't care about DeFi before. And also, so I think, for instance, what you guys are doing with this kind of narrative kind of approach, and previously with the hashful nfts as well, I think that's a really great kind of sign of things to come. I do think that a lot of the things in Defi will be gamified, and a lot of the ways that that will be done is probably through nfts.
00:27:18.902 - 00:27:36.910, Speaker C: So I'm not sure what shape exactly that will take yet for things like compound and aave and uniswap. But I do think that we'll see more gamification and more union of these two worlds that historically, in the past two years have been pretty separate.
00:27:38.690 - 00:28:12.614, Speaker D: I think I was going to say that I feel like DeFi in some way. I feel like it's becoming more mature, right. And perhaps more boring. Not as exciting, but that may actually be a good sign, because usually finance was never exciting or interesting. Right. It was always boring. But turns out that that was also one of the major catalysts that dictate how you live your life, dictates how you live, because literally everything that happens on Wall street in some or the other way pretty much sets the tone for how the capital flows.
00:28:12.614 - 00:29:01.462, Speaker D: On the other hand, it's not really exciting unless you are in the action. I feel like DeFi might be heading in that direction where you have more mature players enter the space and they are the ones who are seeing value. Because if you really think about DeFi, it does offer a zero to one upgrade over the traditional financial systems. Previously you had the regulators, you had all these ways for people to interact with things in order to basically move the capital and have transparency or protect the consumer interest and so on. And crypto and Defi just does that at really low cost. It removes all of the barriers that you typically would see or operational inefficiencies that you would see in tradfi. And Defi just solves that.
00:29:01.462 - 00:30:17.030, Speaker D: So that's definitely a zero to one update. I think it's just a matter of time before they realize that, how powerful that is before they can start applying it to other things they've been doing in the past. But the question then becomes, obviously, once the professional players start taking the positions in terms of bringing the capital and liquidity, who is going to interact with it? I think that comes down to your retail, right? And I think at the moment, your retail is still kind of like 99% of the people do not know about crypto and DFI still, they're still in the process of onboarding. And I think what I've realized is many people who are getting into crypto, at least these days, the first thing they ask is, how do I get into. I want to get into nfts. So it seems like NFT is a shiny object that is attracting many, many newcomers into the space, those who haven't heard about crypto, as either they want to get into crypto, but I think NFT is this little entry point that they are seeing that is being used to get into the space. And I feel like the whole idea of gamefly and what we're thinking about is this is a great way to get people into the space and then eventually onboard them into broader defi by using your gamefly as the narrative.
00:30:17.030 - 00:30:48.250, Speaker D: Because everyone wants to feel like a protagonist and they like fun things, right? But at the same time, at some point they will also need to find things that are useful that they can use to do more useful things. So I feel like there's a nice interface here. That was our thought process behind why we chose to kind of add this gamefight positioning to onboard new set of users who are getting into just crypto generally, and then also guide them through the different building blocks that have been already built historically.
00:30:48.750 - 00:31:39.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And just to echo what you said, I think d five has by and large gone through the zero to one moment already. I think a lot of low hanging fruits have already been built. Most of the projects that we're seeing raising are trying to get d five from one to ten. All right, so how do we make these existing products better or ten x better, or how do we onboard the next billion people? So, for instance, one of the big investments we made recently was in a project called say so their entire thesis is that now that, okay, DFI has already kind of reached its zero to one moment. Now we have to think about how do we scale these products from one to ten? And what they've noticed is a lot of the derivatives exchanges, the perp exchanges, are simply not scalable on existing infrastructure. Because even on chains like Salana, for instance, I think a few of them have run into chain congestion issues.
00:31:39.162 - 00:32:37.870, Speaker B: Market makers couldn't really fill their orders when there are like massive NFT mints happening on the chain. And then obviously on layer one, ethereum, it's incredibly expensive in times of high transactions. And even on layer two, transaction costs are still magnitudes higher than what you would get on, like a binance or FTX. And they realized that it's not really an app layer issue, it's really an infrastructure layer issue. So say network basically created a specialized layer one for order books. So when it comes kind of specialized infrastructure, I do think that is the trend going forward, especially for more mature verticals that are trying to get to the next kind of one to ten phase. Because I think layer ones, or like general purpose infrastructure is very good for bootstrapping projects, especially in kind of immature verticals, because you don't have to worry about securing your own validator set.
00:32:37.870 - 00:33:05.430, Speaker B: You don't have to worry about teaching users a new heuristic with interacting with your wallets and so on. But then once you scale to like a billion daily active users, a lot of these chains start to not be able to support you. So you have to start thinking about maybe specialized infrastructure. And I think that's why there is this excitement around the idea of app chains, which I have some thoughts about. But I think that's really driven by necessity versus just a random narrative.
00:33:08.030 - 00:33:38.302, Speaker D: I was just about to ask you, when you said specialized infrastructure, I was like, what are your thoughts on app? So I see, like Dimitri makes some posts, and I saw Dan's posts on Uniswap and why it should be an app chain. I think yuga labs at some point decided to become their own apecoin chain. Whatever. I was curious to hear, where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? Yeah, please. Floor is yours.
00:33:38.446 - 00:34:31.234, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So I am very skeptical of the idea that every app should be its own chain or its own roll up, which a lot of people, when they discuss app chains, seem to be talking about. Now, it might make sense for standalone apps that do not require composability. So maybe like a DyDX that really doesn't need to plug into anything else and they're just like there to process orders, maybe then it makes sense, especially because they already have a pretty high market cap, so it might not be that hard for them to secure their own validator set. But then I don't think it makes sense for an application to give up one of the most important parts of being a web3 app, which is being able to compose with others just to not compete for block space with like an NFT mint. And not to mention that if you do have all the apps living across different roll ups, then your cross domain muv is going to be incredibly high as well. So there's a lot of value leak as well.
00:34:31.234 - 00:34:53.274, Speaker B: What I do think makes sense is a middle ground between one app, one chain, and general purpose layer one, which is, I think some people call them like sector app chains or I call them thematic chains. So to give an example, I think Genie and Gem should probably live on the same chain as looks rare, or one inch should probably live on the same chain as like Uniswap, right?
00:34:53.312 - 00:34:54.746, Speaker C: Hashflow should probably live on the same.
00:34:54.768 - 00:36:03.646, Speaker B: Chain as sushiswap and Uniswap and whatnot. But you don't have to be on the same chain as looks rare. So we group these chains by what apps they probably need to compose with, and we can control for that by governance, right? So like for avalanche, for instance, I think their subnets basically run this way where you have people vote in or approve what contracts or what type of projects can be deployed, and that's what, say wanted to do as well. And then the additional benefit to that is you also self select the people building on your chain in the early days, instead of having in a bull market, instead of having like 50 teams fork cream finance, you really only self select for people who want to go through that governance proposal, who go through the entire process that deploy near chain. So you end up probably having pretty high signal teams. So initially, I was still off two minds about this thesis because I think securing your own validator set, even for a thematic chain, not just for one application, is a pretty large undertaking. And it's really serious, right.
00:36:03.646 - 00:37:01.246, Speaker B: If you end up having a chain that's worth like $30 million, then you can probably have like one whale just take over the entire chain and screw you over. But now there's been a lot more innovations around how to prevent that. So for Cosmos, I think they're probably at the forefront of thinking about this, right? So they've always talked about interchange security and shared security, but I think the more interesting thing is actually mesh security, where you have different app chains run validators for other app chains. So you create a mesh network instead of needing to rely on a central kind of, I guess they call it a cosmos hub, or in Polkadot's case, the main kind of beacon chain. So that's just to say that I think there's a lot of work being done to enable an easier way to launch these app chains in a secure manner. And I do think that we're going to see more of those. Yeah, that was a bit of a ramble.
00:37:01.438 - 00:38:01.014, Speaker D: No, I think that's a bunch to unpack. I was going to ask you, actually, tendermints, is it a good example of a mesh network sort? I'm not too familiar with the underlying architecture, especially of Cosmos two or the Atom two, that they recently released. And I wonder if that was one of the reasons why the whole app chain thesis has become fresh again. Right, because people have thought about this in the past, which is kind of why polka dot and cosmos kind of came about, right? Because they wanted to build the parachains, multiple chains, with each chain supporting its own application. Now, for DyDX, it sort of made sense, because from a dex point of view, I feel like DYDX, if they're doing perps, then really they're settling everything in one stable coin like USDC and you can basically create a perp on anything for any asset class on any chain. Right. So it doesn't matter.
00:38:01.014 - 00:38:42.014, Speaker D: So even if they built everything on Cosmos, I don't know if there was a need for them to be composable. They're essentially building a decentralized version of FTX. And I think Cosmos, in that case, actually made them quicker, and I think it achieved the purpose they were trying to achieve. But I think for something like a spot Dex, I feel like we'll have to run, like, cross chain transactions for every single chain, which is actually. It could be a little tricky, right. Because having interoperability between two different chains, there's a latency issue, and I think it's not really fun. Even though we try our best to get it as close, as seamless as possible, it's kind of challenging.
00:38:42.014 - 00:39:05.610, Speaker D: And I think the moment you have hundreds of chains for different things, it becomes really tricky. But anyway, I think, going back, the question here was, do you know much about the new Cosmos or tendon protocol that they released recently? And is that a good example of something that can support the app chain thesis?
00:39:06.430 - 00:39:52.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is a pretty good framework to enable this app chain thesis. And just to clarify, I don't think there will be hundreds of chains or thousands of chains for each app. I think there's probably going to be maybe a dozen very specific app chains. Maybe like a defi zone, or maybe, like a trading zone, and then maybe, like a gaming zone, or maybe, like an NFT zone. So I think very thematic and strategic ways of organizing block space to certain specialized chains, I think that would probably make sense. What wouldn't make sense is just like, each app is its own chain, and I think the cosmos, I think a few things happened to make this app chain future more likely. So, number one is so tendermint, and Cosmos SDK has always been around.
00:39:52.266 - 00:40:56.990, Speaker B: It's been easy to kind of create relatively easy to create blockchains around that, and Terra was built on that. But I think once IBC was enabled and once bridges started taking off, it became easy for people to port assets from, say, ethereum over to Cosmos, and it became easy for people to transfer assets between different cosmos zones. So that was development number one. And I think development number two right now is what we saw in the atom two proposal, and also in the Cosmos verse event where they talked about interchange security. So it became very easy for people to launch their own chains without needing to secure their own validator set by just relying on the staked atom. So by relying on the cosmos hub as a delegated kind of source of security. Or they could pursue mesh security, which I don't know how far along development that is, but this is something that sunny from Cosmos and osmosis discussed during the Cosmos for Us event, which, as I mentioned before, it's this idea of allowing validators in different Cosmos zones to also validate for other chains.
00:40:56.990 - 00:41:38.140, Speaker B: So I think the really ingenious thing there is, so obviously, if every validator on every app is validating for each other, then you could end up just having a proof of, like, five validators and being incredibly centralized. So the really ingenious way to think of this is like, okay, if you are a validator on osmosis and you're validating for say, then your voting power should be sub one to one on say so the best way to gain exposure to, say, validating power is still to stake directly on say so. That way they kind of counteract this problem a little bit. So I'm really excited about that idea and I'm excited to see kind of where they take this.
00:41:40.270 - 00:42:11.240, Speaker D: I feel like we need to bring them on the defi state next. I should probably hit Pink Sunny to come and talk about it and as well as the safe founders, I think that could be interesting topic, actually. So I'm actually pretty curious, and I'm pretty sure many people here would be interested in that as well. By the way, I think we might be running a little over. So I think. Nicole, did you have any questions? I suppose we can actually.
00:42:12.490 - 00:42:47.598, Speaker A: I do have so many questions, but I was also enjoying listening to you and Jason go back and forth, so I didn't want to interrupt. We should probably schedule another time when Jason is free for another half an hour or something. If you have time. I also just subscribed to your Jason Choi. You can find him on Twitter here. And also he has a great podcast, the block crunch. Highly suggest.
00:42:47.598 - 00:42:52.606, Speaker A: Listen, I saw you had John Patton on from Treasured Owl. He's a friend of mine.
00:42:52.798 - 00:42:56.166, Speaker B: Oh, nice. Yeah, he's a really great team.
00:42:56.348 - 00:43:14.710, Speaker A: Yeah, he's really good. They're great. I still have a small brain. Hopefully we recover from that, but, yeah, they're great. All right, well, Jason, thanks for coming on, and we will see you next time on the DeFi state.
00:43:14.780 - 00:43:17.382, Speaker B: Guys, thank you so much.
00:43:17.516 - 00:43:18.450, Speaker D: All right, thanks, Jason.
