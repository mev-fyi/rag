00:00:00.250 - 00:00:01.600, Speaker A: It's a vibe in here.
00:00:02.210 - 00:00:14.160, Speaker B: It's a vibe. Greg, by the way, that is the fastest. Any guest that I've had has requested to come on stage and actually knew to do that.
00:00:15.170 - 00:00:17.806, Speaker A: I'm quick on my fingers. Don't sleep on.
00:00:17.988 - 00:00:22.640, Speaker B: No, no. I mean, I expected nothing less, but I love it.
00:00:24.370 - 00:00:30.360, Speaker C: I was going to say, this is like the who wants to be a millionaire? Kind of thing. Rebecca, the fastest fingers first.
00:00:31.210 - 00:00:32.360, Speaker A: What did I win?
00:00:34.170 - 00:00:44.540, Speaker B: We'll let you know at the end. We'll have a group meeting on Discord, on our personal discord, and decide together. How's that?
00:00:45.070 - 00:00:50.410, Speaker A: That sounds good. Although the last thing I need is another discord right now.
00:00:50.480 - 00:01:03.780, Speaker B: But don't worry, Greg, I meant we would decide as the hashflow team about your I wouldn't involve you in this, knowing full well that you have your hands full.
00:01:05.030 - 00:01:06.500, Speaker A: You're far too kind.
00:01:07.590 - 00:01:51.918, Speaker B: Well, let's get this show started. GM. GM. And by GM, I really mean good afternoon to those on the east coast, but who really says that? Welcome to the Defi state, a weekly show brought to you by Hashflow. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Nicole Benham, the host of this show and head of community for Hashflow. On this show, we bring in notable speakers, founders, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and generally the brightest minds in the industry to discuss what the future of decentralization will look like. What I love about this show is that every guest is so multidimensional and has so much to contribute beyond insights on DFI and web3.
00:01:51.918 - 00:02:41.040, Speaker B: If you're eager to learn and expand your mind, you're in the right place. Also, if you'd like to share this space with your friends, I get this question all the time. You can click on the arrow at the top right of the space and copy the link. Tweet it out to your feed, text it to your friends, whatever works. We have our CEO Varun here with us, and today our special guest is Greg Eisenberg, founder of Late Checkout, a product design agency, fund and studio that designs, creates and acquires community based products in web3 communities. Greg is also a bit of a content machine. He has a popular Substac, a Twitter feed that is always popping and full of relevant insights, and a very popular podcast called where it happens.
00:02:41.040 - 00:02:59.640, Speaker B: Greg is one of my favorite follows right after Greg. 166-726-7165 but second favorite, Greg on Twitter for me. And that says a lot. So Greg, welcome. How are.
00:03:04.810 - 00:03:13.020, Speaker A: That? First, Greg is just. He's full of surprises. He's full of delight. So I'm okay being number two. I'm well, thanks for asking.
00:03:14.110 - 00:03:17.020, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like he's your favorite, Greg, also.
00:03:17.790 - 00:03:30.320, Speaker A: Yeah. We have this sort of friendship, like, deep bond and friendship, and I'm glad we have it. Some people think that I'm him, actually, but really?
00:03:31.730 - 00:03:37.520, Speaker B: I've never heard that, but now. Wow, that's interesting. And so you're not him.
00:03:38.850 - 00:03:40.720, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm not him.
00:03:41.890 - 00:03:45.040, Speaker B: He does interact with your tweets a lot, I would say.
00:03:46.490 - 00:03:48.680, Speaker A: Yeah, he does. Right.
00:03:49.290 - 00:04:02.220, Speaker B: Maybe that's why people think it, but he's just a fan, so that's great. Would you say that Greg is a community leader, or does that description not fit him?
00:04:02.830 - 00:04:08.330, Speaker A: I would say he's an incredible audience builder.
00:04:21.040 - 00:04:22.620, Speaker B: Did I just get rugged?
00:04:23.440 - 00:04:28.850, Speaker C: I was just going to ask you, did we all get rugged? Because I can't hear Greg. I can hear you, though.
00:04:29.220 - 00:04:58.810, Speaker B: You can hear me, Greg? Did you get rugged, man, Twitter spaces. All right, let's see. I think the best case. Yeah, sometimes you just close the app and come back in, but I see he's on mute right now. Okay, we'll get him back in a second. Should I play the music? I mean, what's the.
00:05:00.220 - 00:05:02.620, Speaker C: Should. We should invite the real Greg in the meantime.
00:05:03.280 - 00:05:07.980, Speaker B: I know, right? I mean, I'd say that Greg Eisenberg is a real Greg.
00:05:10.320 - 00:05:20.210, Speaker C: That could be. It's like, secretly, that's a big, grand reveal today for anyone who waits till the end, they find out.
00:05:22.660 - 00:05:24.848, Speaker A: Yeah. Sorry about that. What's up?
00:05:25.014 - 00:05:27.430, Speaker B: No worries. We can hear you now.
00:05:28.360 - 00:05:29.380, Speaker A: Wonderful.
00:05:31.400 - 00:05:37.168, Speaker B: All right, talk to us. Pick up where you left. Yeah, he's an audience builder.
00:05:37.184 - 00:06:18.340, Speaker A: Yeah, he's an audience builder. He's an incredible audience builder. And I think what makes a great audience builder is someone who understands how to speak to their audience in a language they understand. And that means memes, and that means just, like, jokes and words and stuff like that. He's gone from zero to almost 400,000 followers relatively quickly. And what I love about him as an audience builder is he's always making me laugh and I feel like, oh, my God. Now more than ever, we need more audience builders who are putting smiles on people's faces.
00:06:19.560 - 00:06:31.224, Speaker B: 100%. I know you've made the distinction between audience and community many times, but can you do it one more time for people here who probably don't know the difference?
00:06:31.342 - 00:06:59.312, Speaker A: Totally. An audience is you're on a stage and you're blasting out content similar to this. Right now, it's an audience, and no one could really say anything right now, except maybe do an emoji reaction. Shout out, do some emoji reactions so we feel like you're a part of. Please, please. There we go. And it just basically means.
00:06:59.312 - 00:07:34.940, Speaker A: An audience means, like, if Greg stops, the other Greg stops tweeting or me, greg stops tweeting. There's no engagement anymore. And a community is different than know the framework for what we have around it is. We call it the tribe framework and it's how to test if something's a community. So is there togetherness? Are there rituals, is there member identity, is there belonging? And is there engagement? Are there people interacting with one another? And if you have the tribe, you have the tribe.
00:07:36.800 - 00:07:45.090, Speaker B: What's an example of a community driven business that you feel like is killing it and hitting all those points.
00:07:47.300 - 00:08:21.448, Speaker A: In web two land, and then I'll do a web3 example. But in web two land, I would say Rafa, which is apparel for cyclists. They started off as apparel for cyclists and then they created something called RCC Rafa Cycling Club. And basically what it is, it's a yearly fee. I think it's like $100 or something. And you get access to these cycling meetups in your city. And I think there's 25 or 30 cities which are live in.
00:08:21.448 - 00:08:59.510, Speaker A: And it's really cool because you get to meet other cyclists and cycle with other cyclists. And obviously, if you're going to one of these cycling meetups, you're not going to wear a Nike shirt, you're going to wear your rafa gear. So it's just a beautiful harmony of audience. They've got some big cyclists who use it and who blast it out. Community with RCC and products you have, the actual product itself is, of course, the. Oh, sorry, go.
00:09:01.340 - 00:09:12.910, Speaker B: Just going to. I wasn't even going to interrupt. I was going to say, is aloe yoga a good example? Because what you're describing, I feel like girls have with aloe yoga in.
00:09:15.440 - 00:09:28.770, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know if you partake in, you know, maybe you can tell folks who don't live in LA what it is and why you think it's interesting as a community based product.
00:09:29.220 - 00:10:10.040, Speaker B: So aloe yoga is apparel for people who. I mean, it's not just yoga. You can wear it for any workout, but I think they built some kind of studio house. I haven't been yet, but I see everybody going there and working out there and taking yoga classes there. And as I walk the streets of LA, more and more people are wearing aloe yoga. And so the example that you gave made me think of that, because it feels like you have a sense of belonging. I mean, as a girl, I feel that way when I'm wearing aloe and another girl is wearing aloe.
00:10:10.040 - 00:10:30.020, Speaker B: So that's what that made me think of. And everybody's been saying, oh, my God, I want to go to the aloe house and work out. I want to go have. You mean that's also, I don't know, audience, too. But, yeah, I feel like there's a sense of community and a sense of belonging among people who wear their apparel.
00:10:30.760 - 00:11:25.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I think from what I understand about, like, I know they have a place also not an aloe house, but in Miami, I know they do sell right around the corner where I am right now. And I also know they throw events there, and they're constantly thinking about, from what I've seen, like, the wellness community. And how do you bring together the wellness community? People who are interested, like wellness curious, or people who want to get into that lifestyle? And I think when you think about community based businesses, the way to think about it is, what is the lifestyle that you're trying to attract? And then how do you build a business around it? Versus I want to go build a business and then figure out how to build a lifestyle around it. And it's this subtle mindset shift. But, yeah, aloe is completely in tune with their community, and, yeah, I think people love their products.
00:11:26.200 - 00:11:29.850, Speaker B: Yeah. And what about the web3 example that you were going to give?
00:11:31.260 - 00:12:36.670, Speaker A: Yeah, this is an obvious and big one, but I'm obsessed, I should say, with nouns and just the whole system built around nouns. So I just think that that project, how they've structured it, is particularly interesting. Obviously, what sucks about nouns is that it's cost prohibitive, and I think they're figuring out ways to make it less cost prohibitive. But do really love that business. I love that project. And love how the other day I was walking in Miami, and I saw someone wearing a nouns hat. And I think that the amount of merch that you sell is generally a good indicator if you have a community based business and if you have a lot of people, just like something.
00:12:41.610 - 00:12:45.350, Speaker B: Wait, Greg, can you speak? I want to make sure you weren't.
00:12:47.470 - 00:12:48.330, Speaker A: Can't.
00:12:48.670 - 00:13:06.400, Speaker B: Boom. Okay. I thought you faded out there for a second. All right, very cool. I think my next question is, what was so special about web3 that you said to yourself, hey, I'm going to enter this space and start a company.
00:13:10.050 - 00:13:55.310, Speaker A: It's fun, is the short answer. I had been following I had some crypto for a while, but got really into it in 2019. I had sold a company in 2019, so I had a lot of free time on my hands and just saw a lot of opportunity with respect to supercharging communities via NFTs and web3 experiences. And it's just fun. It's fun to create stories, fun to create worlds. And web3 allows me to stretch my imagination in ways that I sometimes can't.
00:13:59.650 - 00:14:03.406, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%, I'd say the same. I think this is the most fun.
00:14:03.428 - 00:15:27.660, Speaker C: I've had by the Nicole. Greg, I had a follow up question, if you don't mind me. I wanted to go back to the previous question around building communities and audience wise. I think when you asked Greg about what are the good community based oriented projects in web two and web3 and the examples you guys gave us, Ali, yoga and Rafa, and I was curious, do you think it's a lot easier to build communities around products that are more lifestyle based, or do you think that can apply to any sort of product? And one of the reasons why I'm asking this is because obviously, I'm speaking from a hashtag perspective, like, we are a Dex, so we're not necessarily a lifestyle project. But I'm curious, how do you like to think about products that are not necessarily appealing to a certain lifestyle? Like step in, for example. They encourage this idea of walking, and that actually brought many people together. On the other hand, if you're building something that is not necessarily about lifestyle, but also, at the end of the day, web3 is all about community, what kind of framework do you tend to use to think about products that may not necessarily encourage a certain lifestyle, or do you think that's sort of a key component of building a community?
00:15:28.770 - 00:16:20.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that if you're building a community based product around a lifestyle, or product around a lifestyle, that's like fishing with dynamite, with the assumptions that you know how to build product and you know how to build community and you know how to build audience, there are big assumptions. But it's like fishing with dynamite. Now, if you have a milestone, which is people are coming, it's not a lifestyle. It's not a full on lifestyle, but there's some milestone, like people want to get from point a to point b, you still have an opportunity to build a community based product. Is that fishing with dynamite? No. Is it like fishing where a lot of fish are? Absolutely. That's the distinction I would make.
00:16:20.094 - 00:17:21.342, Speaker A: And then I think there's some products that they're just widgets. And in the sense of, do they need an audience, do they need a community? Probably not. But I do believe that overwhelmingly people want to be connected to the brands and creators that they interact with. And I think that's why you're seeing this surge of people like the aloes and the Rafas. And just like, I don't know that much about your product, but the fact that you're even doing this shows that you're trying to stimulate connection between your brand and all these people in here. And what I've learned is when you're the host of the party, it increases your luckiness. And I don't know if there's like 100 people in here or whatever.
00:17:21.342 - 00:17:37.270, Speaker A: It looks like 100 plus people. There might not be a sale today, but the fact that you're hosting the party is cool and it's fun for people and it's valuable. It's not only good for the community.
00:17:37.340 - 00:18:23.220, Speaker C: But it's also good business, because I think that's something we've been thinking about. Also have these conversations with Nicole frequently, just to recurse as a short sell. Our product is essentially an exchange, right? It's a decentralized exchange protocol that allows people to essentially trade on any chain in a single place. But at the same time, I was like, that's one dimension. But at the end of the day, with Web three, which is so community driven, I feel like building that brand that people fall in love with is super critical. And that goes beyond building a simple calculator that people talk to. Right.
00:18:23.220 - 00:18:50.598, Speaker C: And if you want to think about along those lines, what are good engagement tactics and how do you bring more people together that is more brand centric as opposed to purely. That feels more robotic, where you just simply go and swap and that's it. Right. Because that is not really building that community. And I wonder sometimes how critical that would be. And in my opinion, I think that's super critical. Although some people think you just need to build APIs in court a day.
00:18:50.598 - 00:19:06.500, Speaker C: And I'm like, maybe there's more than that. There is a lot more going on here that was just building APIs. And I think that could have much richer dividends over time. At least that's what our thinking is. But I was curious to hear your thoughts around that.
00:19:07.590 - 00:20:15.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we have an agency, and our agency does one thing. We work with only like a dozen clients at a time. We only focus on transforming transactional companies to community companies. So agreed that if you have a Dex and it's just transactional people come to transact and it's a tool that other people implement and that's it. Could you create a great business? Yeah, I'm sure you could. But does it make you more vulnerable to competition? And could you see increased retention and engagement if you created it a more community oriented brand? That's what I fundamentally, the way I think about it is you can also go on Facebook and spend x amount of dollars every month or day, thousands of dollars. I would much rather take that money, 95% of it, 99% of it, and actually just invest it into the community.
00:20:15.880 - 00:20:56.310, Speaker A: And my hunch is that if you look at it at a twelve month basis and you're like, hey, I invested x dollars into this community oriented stuff. I would have invested y dollars into direct response Facebook ads or whatever. I bet you that the value that goes to the business, both from transactional, literally, people using your product more, and then also just like the warm and fuzzy feeling stuff, which is hard to measure. If you combine those two things, I think that is going to outperform Facebook.
00:21:00.170 - 00:21:15.820, Speaker C: I 100% agree with that. I think that's something I can thank you for stating that again. I think that's something that's been top of my mind. I'm pretty sure Nicole has been thinking about the same thing too. Nicole, I'll let you ask the next.
00:21:17.390 - 00:21:59.420, Speaker B: I have. I have so many questions to go in a different direction. How do you ensure that a community is healthy? Because as an example, a lot of us when we were younger, we belonged to communities, schools, religious organizations, et cetera, and also the Internet. We got a lot of trolls, a lot of bullying, keyboard warriors, all of that stuff. So how do you ensure that a community is healthy and thriving and that it really gives people a sense of belonging and positivity when they are interacting with people. Is there a way to manage that?
00:22:00.830 - 00:22:37.270, Speaker A: Yeah. I first want to say that without the health of the community, you have nothing. So a drop of negative and bulliness is going to poison the well, basically. So you got to make it number one. And it's also going back to Nicole, going back to the whole, why are you doing this? It's fun answer. Well, it's not fun to run a community where people are getting bullied. It's just like sad.
00:22:37.270 - 00:23:10.510, Speaker A: I remember being in elementary school and seeing a few kids get bullied constantly and it was like the worst. It was the worst for them. In my mind. I was like, thank God this isn't me. But it was the worst. I was always trying to help them in some capacity. None of us want to be either bullied or want to be innocent bystanders or bystanders.
00:23:10.510 - 00:23:44.650, Speaker A: What are tactical things that you can do? Well, of course, there's a million things you can do around creating rules and banning people and a zero tolerance policy, and there's a lot of things you can do. But overarching, I think the important thing throughout your product, throughout your community experience, it needs to be messaged that this is a positive environment. And, yeah, none of this works unless it's.
00:23:47.790 - 00:24:04.370, Speaker B: Just wanted to. Just wanted to make sure. Greg, what technologies have been disruptive when it comes to community building? I mean, there are so many new apps and new technologies. Every day I'm getting pointed in another direction, what has actually been disruptive?
00:24:05.990 - 00:25:10.040, Speaker A: So I think the state of social media is a spectrum. So on one side, you have one on one messaging and things like iMessage, and on the other things, you have broadcasting platforms like TikTok and Twitter, in a lot of ways. And we had recently done. I was just talking about this in my community college class today, which is a course I teach, and we had done some research around what is the average number of likes and retweets that people get on a tweet? And turns out that average number is literally zero. So you have millions of people tweeting and getting no sense of feedback or reward, and that is not fun. And I think the reason why you started seeing new products exist, to a certain extent, this has community elements to it. Discord, obviously, they added forums recently, and they're doing a lot of cool stuff.
00:25:10.040 - 00:26:14.780, Speaker A: Circle, mighty networks, tribe, and then lens as a web3 platform, they're doing some interesting things. I think the reason why you're seeing a shift to the middle of the spectrum, many to many communication, is just because the current state of social media is broken. And it's broken because it doesn't provide the feedback necessary for people to grow as people and express themselves as people. So, yeah, I'm excited to see where lens is going. I'm excited to see more funding for companies like Circle. I don't think there's enough community technology being built, frankly. It's nice to see the big platform starting to introduce some of this stuff, but I would love to see just more.
00:26:15.950 - 00:26:53.720, Speaker B: I would, too. There's like a deep human aspect in everything that you say and do, Greg, and I wanted to ask you what would help us grow as people or what kind of thing does? And it doesn't have to be a business. It can even be like, I don't know, hanging out with your friends. I feel like one time I asked you over a DM, when you hear the word community, what do you think? And you said something like laughing, crying and something else. But what does help us grow as people?
00:26:55.130 - 00:27:39.720, Speaker A: I think we have this epidemic right now around, especially on crypto Twitter and tech Twitter, which is we need to optimize ourselves as much as possible. So it's like the meme of I wake up at four in the morning and I don't drink coffee and I bench lift and I drink this and this supplement, and I take all these vitamins, and then I do a cold plunge, and then I write 6 hours of content, and then I sell my business in the afternoon and I do all these things. I'm just not convinced that's a way to live the happiest and most fulfilling life.
00:27:40.650 - 00:27:53.690, Speaker B: So what is the way? Because there has been so much research, and also, I'm sure you're a very keen observer. So I'm sure you notice when you and other people are happiest.
00:27:56.350 - 00:28:41.274, Speaker A: I'm happiest when I'm with my closest friends and family, doing things that I love to do, which is generally like eating and drinking and being merry. I'm happiest when I'm doing things in moderation, not to the extreme. So I think, while I agree, for example, waking up early and taking supplements is actually a good thing. I do a steam and sauna every single day. I do these things. I think that it needs to be in moderation. I had dessert last night.
00:28:41.274 - 00:28:56.640, Speaker A: It was dope. It was tiramisu. It was like sweet. Tiramisu is awesome. Other dessert is sweet, too. I had a glass of wine the other night, a few glasses of wine. It was great.
00:28:56.640 - 00:29:21.480, Speaker A: So I think it's prioritizing what? Okay, what is it? I think it's prioritizing what you fundamentally know is right for you and whatever that means, because I think it means different thing, and I think it means acting in moderation. And I think it means spending tons of time with family and friends.
00:29:23.370 - 00:29:32.102, Speaker B: I love that answer. And I too love the steam and sauna and all that, but I cannot do the cold plunge.
00:29:32.246 - 00:29:35.142, Speaker C: It does not bring one day, Nicole.
00:29:35.286 - 00:29:36.106, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:29:36.208 - 00:29:37.622, Speaker C: I'll take you to the ice bath.
00:29:37.686 - 00:30:07.400, Speaker B: I don't think anyone's going to be able to convince me to do Greg. I love that answer. So wholesome and so true. And it's just something that I think we all need to constantly be thinking about. Back to web3. You've tweeted about dows a lot in the past. What's your take on dows now? Where do you think they're making progress? Where do you think they could use some help?
00:30:08.890 - 00:31:08.822, Speaker A: Yeah. So what do I think of dows? I think it's a web3 enabled company, basically, or project. So I think I'm a believer in that concept. I think it's going to take 1234 years for us to create well oiled machine dows, though, in the sense of that has a high participation rate of people voting on stuff. People feel really connected to it, from the most leadership level to people who just want to connect with it. So I think, where are we? My belief on the state, the lay of the land in terms of the Dow landscape is we're in experimentation mode. We're experimenting what works, what doesn't work, hopefully.
00:31:08.822 - 00:31:43.540, Speaker A: And I think we are writing best practices around how to build the most productive dow, the healthiest dows, the most fun dows, the most interesting dows. And I just hope that the bear market doesn't dissuade people from starting and participating in dows. But assuming there is still interest, and I think there is, I think we're in for a few year ride of experimentation. And that's always fun.
00:31:45.370 - 00:32:40.880, Speaker B: Yeah. And I have noticed the market has weeded out some people, but not most people. I feel like there's a lot of people that are still here. I saw today one of my friends had like 900 people in his NFT space. And I was just like, this is still very much alive and people are still very much interested in this landscape, ecosystem, whatever you want to call it. Do you think, Greg, that when people in crypto use certain terms, we alienate the masses? And if so, how do we combat this? And how do you think we can move closer to mass adoption? Is Greg rugged Varun? Can you hear?
00:32:41.410 - 00:32:42.718, Speaker C: I can hear you guys.
00:32:42.804 - 00:32:44.798, Speaker B: Yeah, you can hear Greg, too.
00:32:44.964 - 00:32:46.960, Speaker C: I can't hear Greg, though. No.
00:32:48.770 - 00:32:49.518, Speaker B: Okay.
00:32:49.684 - 00:32:52.254, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. Give me a minute.
00:32:52.382 - 00:32:54.130, Speaker B: There we go. Okay.
00:32:54.200 - 00:33:04.360, Speaker A: I was just going to say, sorry, I'm just walking in my car. I was just going to say by definition, if you're using technical terms, you're alienating the.
00:33:09.290 - 00:34:19.440, Speaker B: So I actually, I heard someone was saying the other day that instead of using the term NFT, they just say digital collectible, because when you even use the term NFT, you're still alienating the masses, which is crazy to think because when you're in this bubble, that's just the term we use and we understand it and we buy them and trade them and collect them and all of that. But it made me think, what are some other terms that we're using that maybe we can sort of swap out to get other people more interested and also less scared to get into this space? Because I myself, when I heard all these technical terms, at First, I was very hesitant to enter this space. At wasn't. I didn't get into it until Farok brought me into a rug radio space, and I was sucked in by the fun of. Yeah, that's just something I've been thinking about.
00:34:20.930 - 00:34:30.580, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even the term web3, the question is, would we be better off not even describing it as web3?
00:34:31.830 - 00:34:38.100, Speaker B: Would we? And what's a better alternative? Has anyone thought of something that is better?
00:34:39.670 - 00:34:44.470, Speaker A: I mean, do we even need a term? You know what I mean? The Internet.
00:34:45.290 - 00:35:02.874, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point. Maybe we can just say the Internet is changing, the Internet is making a shift. Here's what you need to know. And that just sounds like the beginning of a great twitter thread to me. So hillbloom is going to tweet it out soon. Just watch.
00:35:02.992 - 00:35:04.620, Speaker A: It's already tweeted out.
00:35:08.270 - 00:35:23.220, Speaker B: It probably is. Let's talk about your podcast. Greg, I saw your tweet about how you are going to host it solo. What made you decide this?
00:35:25.270 - 00:36:21.350, Speaker A: I feel like I've been using this word so much today right now, but fun. I wasn't having fun. And that was a mix of the guests that we were choosing the content, that we were the guests, the questions, the content, and I wasn't able to follow my curiosity, and that makes it not that fun. And on the surface, we were doing awesome. We were bringing in six figures of revenue. We were often in the top ten tech podcasts, which is really cool. But I had been thinking about it for about five or six months, and sahil came to me, my awesome co host, and he was just, hey, man, like, I'm going to write this book and I have no time to do a podcast.
00:36:21.350 - 00:36:49.920, Speaker A: Let's just like, should we scrap the podcast? And I was like, no, I want to continue doing it, but I want to do it in this format. Yeah, I'm excited about the next chapter. And the lesson there, I think, for me, is just that a book can have many chapters, and as long as you are honest with yourself, I think that's key.
00:36:50.370 - 00:37:12.870, Speaker B: I think it's key too. I love that you're just like, hey, I'm not having fun. What's not fun about this? It's the format. I'm going to change it and that's it. It can be that simple. And I feel like people don't realize that. By the way, Greg, I loved that post about questions that billionaires and successful people ask themselves.
00:37:12.870 - 00:37:17.174, Speaker B: I took a screenshot of it and it's rocking my world right now.
00:37:17.372 - 00:37:41.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's funny how complicated we as quote unquote adults make the world when in reality it is so simple. Not to get super introspective here, but life is pretty simple if you really think about it.
00:37:41.810 - 00:37:54.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why I think it's good to sit down and reflect and ask yourself these questions and meditate and do all that stuff. Because if not, there's so much noise and you're never going to figure it out.
00:37:56.230 - 00:37:57.170, Speaker A: Amen.
00:37:57.830 - 00:37:58.850, Speaker B: Amen.
00:37:59.510 - 00:38:00.958, Speaker A: Can I get an amen?
00:38:01.134 - 00:38:04.354, Speaker B: Amen. Varun, can we get an amen from you?
00:38:04.472 - 00:38:17.580, Speaker C: Amen. Yes. No, I said amen. Then I realized I was muted. Then I said two more times. Then I realized, wait, I'm still muted. You got four amens, but you only heard one.
00:38:18.190 - 00:38:47.540, Speaker B: Amazing. Greg, I also pinned this tweet you tweeted yesterday, launching a Freedom mint project. It's pretty cool reply to this tweet if you want access. And it has over 11,000 likes. Over 5500 retweets, which is nuts. It's called the pencil case project. I'll pin that, too.
00:38:47.540 - 00:38:57.654, Speaker B: Man, this is just super engaging, isn't it? Tell me what motivated this and what this is all about.
00:38:57.852 - 00:39:23.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know how much I can talk about this, but keep your eyes posted. It's just what motivated this? Said it five times. I'll say it six times. What would a fun web3 project look like that's accessible? And we came up with this crazy idea and people seem to be into it.
00:39:25.490 - 00:39:36.242, Speaker B: Yeah. Personally, I wasn't even aware that the world is full of fake pencils, but now I'm intrigued. I obviously want a real one, so I followed the project.
00:39:36.376 - 00:39:55.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I just think I'm more of a pencil guy than a pen guy. Pens are permanent and I like the freedom of pencils. And I love the colors of colored pencils. That's where I'm at.
00:39:55.630 - 00:39:57.878, Speaker B: I assume you don't have tattoos.
00:39:58.054 - 00:40:00.140, Speaker A: I don't have a tattoo, no.
00:40:01.950 - 00:40:04.010, Speaker B: Yeah, because those are pretty permanent.
00:40:04.670 - 00:40:09.870, Speaker A: Yes, they are permanent. Although you can get them removed.
00:40:11.250 - 00:40:22.980, Speaker B: Yes. But I heard that it's very painful, the laser that you do and that you have to do it multiple times. And even then maybe you'll still have like a scar from it.
00:40:23.990 - 00:40:28.820, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm a pencil eraser type guy.
00:40:29.850 - 00:40:45.210, Speaker B: I don't like same. I'm sold on the pencil case project. What do you think it is that got that particular tweet? So much engagement. Other than you are extremely beloved by.
00:40:45.280 - 00:41:21.140, Speaker A: Your own community, I would say the world is ready for more accessible web3 projects, and the world is thirsty for more fun right now. These are dire times, and I think there's opportunities to build leading brands and web3 brands if they're truly fun. They say timing isn't everything, but timing is a lot.
00:41:21.990 - 00:41:23.400, Speaker B: Timing is a lot.
00:41:25.130 - 00:41:28.198, Speaker C: I do want to say. I think I love how Greg used the word fun.
00:41:28.364 - 00:41:29.430, Speaker B: Yes, me too.
00:41:29.580 - 00:41:58.400, Speaker C: Because when we announced a Dow last a couple of weeks ago, or hash we've been talking about, when people ask, what is this about? Why are you guys doing all these things? I think even in that tweet, the first thing we said is because most things are not fun, and we want to make this fun and engaging. I think that was a simple one. It's fascinating how powerful that one single word is. I think that might be the answer to most things that you do things when they're fun, and if they're not fun, then it's, like, just not worth it.
00:41:59.090 - 00:42:21.000, Speaker A: Yes. Do things that are fun. Here's the list of things that are important. Do things that are fun. If you can, leave lead with courage. Don't lead with fear, because that'll make you do dumb decisions. Do lead with fear and go with the heart.
00:42:22.670 - 00:42:27.082, Speaker B: That's my next Twitter thread. Thank you for those. Thank you for those bullet points.
00:42:27.216 - 00:42:31.450, Speaker A: My pleasure. My brain works in threads.
00:42:31.870 - 00:42:54.770, Speaker B: Yeah, we know that. If you're not following Greg Eisenberg by now, big mistake. Number one. Number one thread guy on the SAP. Yeah. I followed you immediately when I found your page. I was just, like, blown away by the amount of insight and perspective that you just deliver for free on a daily basis.
00:42:54.770 - 00:43:21.020, Speaker B: And given that you do that, and you're also on so many different platforms, like, you have a LinkedIn, you have a substac, you have a podcast, you run late checkout. What role does social media play in all this? And also your newsletter. How effective is each of these vehicles in pushing things forward for you?
00:43:22.430 - 00:44:24.702, Speaker A: Like, super effective. It goes back to, how do you attract the most interesting opportunities? And going back to Greg, the original meme guy we were talking about, I can never remember his full username. Greg, whatever. He all of a sudden has this 400,000 people that he has a connection with and he can do something with. And I think building an audience is really important. Content's a big part of that because it allows you to swim downstream versus swimming upstream. And you wake up in the mornings and you open your Twitter dms, and Nicole is sending you a message being like, hey, you want to jump on this cool Twitter space? And it's like, you would have only done that if you had been following my content and that sort of thing.
00:44:24.702 - 00:44:46.998, Speaker A: So I think it's something that everyone should be doing. And I know it's difficult because as we talked about, the average tweet has zero retweets and zero likes. But I think it's an important piece of my puzzle, I would say, yeah, very important.
00:44:47.084 - 00:44:59.900, Speaker B: And then how crucial are in person events to building community? Have you ever seen a community built very effectively without them?
00:45:03.150 - 00:45:55.450, Speaker A: I mean, the most productive way to build a community, the most efficient way to build a community is having some sort of hybrid between IRL and Internet based. So in person events are absolutely a catalyst for building bonds between people. And it's just in a way that you can't do on the Internet. There's a difference between staring at someone's avatar on a Twitter space than staring at someone in the eyes over a drink or something or bread. Breaking bread. Yeah, I think IRL is crucial. Like, I don't know, almost 100% of our products that we work on have some IRL component.
00:45:56.370 - 00:46:08.594, Speaker B: Man, I'm taking so many notes on this. IRL is my favorite, by the way. I love throwing events. I don't know if that's obvious to people. I've done so many over the years.
00:46:08.792 - 00:46:25.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. You really. We're just Internet friends. And based on what I've seen, it seems like you're a natural at it. And, yeah, if you ever want to throw an event, hit me up. Let's do a web3 type of thing.
00:46:26.140 - 00:46:34.570, Speaker B: I'm down. Let's do it. I would love that. I would love that so much. Varun, you have an announcement.
00:46:35.550 - 00:46:56.880, Speaker C: We have a new announcement coming up right after this space. I think for everyone who's been waiting for this week's alpha, I think the hint is something to do with enter the hash verse. And we will be announcing a free mint and the whitelist. Something about the whitelist. You'll find out in 20 minutes.
00:46:58.150 - 00:47:39.886, Speaker B: Okay, great. I love it. So we'll be doing that, too. We're going to follow the Greg formula, man. Greg is actually, for me, it just comes down to pattern recognition. When you see someone like Greg or Sahil or any of these guys who are really moving the needle, you sort of have to see what's the common denominator, what's the thing that they're constantly doing, because that's what works. When I first started following you, Greg, it was very obvious what it was, and I learned a lot from you.
00:47:39.886 - 00:48:23.740, Speaker B: And then I think I discovered David Spinks through you too. And then I got his book, the business of belonging. And yeah, it's great because it's not just the insight and the perspective, but the discovery of other people, especially now through your podcast, that makes you interesting. You're definitely like a curious person. You're actively learning, actively interacting with other people who are also brilliant and insightful and builders and investors and stuff like that. So just makes you super cool and yeah, thank you so much for doing this with us.
00:48:25.150 - 00:48:38.480, Speaker A: Yeah, this is you. Like, thanks for having me and thanks everyone for listening. And Verun, great to meet you and I love what you're up to, so have a good one.
00:48:42.120 - 00:48:49.936, Speaker C: Thank you, Greg, thank you so much for coming by the space and I'm sure the course pass, I think this was phenomenal.
00:48:50.128 - 00:48:51.820, Speaker A: All right, take care it.
00:48:51.890 - 00:48:59.080, Speaker B: All right, tune in next weekend.
