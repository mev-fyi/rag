00:00:14.410 - 00:00:34.120, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. This is Amrit Kumar, chief operating officer, all Slayer, and this is all for you. A show where we discuss layer ones, L2s, app chains and roll ups, among other topics. Today we have John the interop feature at Hyperlain, one of the most popular projects in the modeler space. Building a modeler interop layer. Hi, John. How are you?
00:00:34.810 - 00:00:43.590, Speaker B: I'm doing great, Amrit. It's great to be here. Thanks for having me. Excited for what we got in store today. I've wanted to come on this for a little while, so it's nice to come.
00:00:43.740 - 00:00:54.590, Speaker A: Thank you very much for coming. Yeah, so nice to be chatting with you again. So for those who may not know you, could you tell us a little bit about yourself, your background, and what brought you to the crypto space, for sure.
00:00:54.660 - 00:01:32.886, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm now going on my 6th year, give or take, in crypto, so it's funny to think about, like, time flies. Yeah. I have more white hairs than I thought I would have now. Yeah. We picked our own grave with this industry, and that's where I'm going to stay, I guess. My story is I studied at UC Berkeley here in the United States, and there were some people getting a little bit into crypto.
00:01:32.886 - 00:02:11.522, Speaker B: And so a little bit after graduating in 2016, the time I'm working at Morgan Stanley as, like, call it a bond trader. Just like, moving bonds around, moving zeros on a screen for some purpose. Really, the purpose was to make a good salary because I needed to help my family. But incidentally, I'm at a birthday party with a friend that I knew from school, and he's like, john, you're working finance, right? And I'm like, yeah, what do you think about I'm going to put all my money into Ethereum. And I'm like, well, I've heard of this. It's like, I know it's a crypto. I know it's not bitcoin.
00:02:11.522 - 00:02:36.426, Speaker B: Like, I've used bitcoin before, but I've never really dug into this Ethereum thing. And people at school have talked about it because there was, like, a new club that started talking about crypto. And I'm like, I don't know if it's a good idea. I don't know it's a bad idea. Let's really look into it. And this was a Saturday afternoon, and we just started looking into it. And I basically went on, like, a 48 hours rabbit hole.
00:02:36.426 - 00:02:59.540, Speaker B: I go to work that Monday and I'm like, oh, my God. I get to the trading desk and you guys don't even know what's coming. You have no idea. I just heard about this thing. It's like. It's called Ethereum. It's going to let anyone build financial services and let anyone just provide them, extend them.
00:02:59.540 - 00:03:18.314, Speaker B: That was kind of my main takeaway from that. And that was it, like, just Ethereum pilled or just pilled with this concept of blockchains that can render permissionless applications. They spent the next year, like, getting more and more and more and deeper into crypto. By early 20s.
00:03:18.432 - 00:03:19.606, Speaker A: Did you mine anything mining?
00:03:19.638 - 00:03:57.554, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Well, that's exactly what I did, because mining felt a little bit like a crypto bond, and there was some element of some friends of mine who were big gamers. We wanted to afford certain graphics cards. We're like, well, we could kind of finance it by mining ethereum. It's like, you buy this thing. Coming from the bond world, mining felt very much like a form of a crypto bond, because you'd buy the equipment that would be kind of like your principal payment, but then you would collect these cash flows in the form of the token rewards. That felt very much like coupons.
00:03:57.554 - 00:04:39.620, Speaker B: And so coming from a bond background, I was like, okay, I can wrap my head around this. It's easier to justify. And I have something physical that even if crypto was worth it, at least I have some salvage value in this equipment. And so that was my foray into it personally. Before even investing my own money into bitcoin or ETH directly. I was buying this equipment, starting to mine actually mostly zcash, but ETH was, like about 30% of the capacity because I got started mining probably like February 2017, basically, like the next bonus cycle from the bank. After getting really into it, that's like, what I spent, basically.
00:04:40.790 - 00:04:43.720, Speaker A: Did you run a pool or you were trying to do on your own?
00:04:44.250 - 00:05:28.870, Speaker B: I did. No, I was mining through two pools. I basically set up six rigs where each rig had six GPUs, and I built them all myself. It was kind of fun. I used to build computers when I was younger, and so this was a lot of fun, trying to get it to work and also understood, even though you use the pool, there were still a lot of issues with just, like, how to use, I think, substrate was, like, what the binding software was called, getting it to work, and understanding why things are failing. And so it got me even deeper into how blockchains work. That entire year of 2017, I'm looking for my first opportunity, and how can I get into this field? I don't know anybody.
00:05:28.870 - 00:05:59.802, Speaker B: I work in regular finance. Everyone I know thinks it's a massive scam. Everyone else at Morgan Stanley thought it was totally crazy. They would make fun of me every opportunity they got. But luckily, by the end of the year, there was an opportunity that I found that came through Morgan Stanley. Because I was a client of some people that I worked with, and I joined this firm called Passport Capital, which was a big San Francisco macro hedge fund that was getting into crypto. I joined them as the first hire.
00:05:59.802 - 00:06:38.780, Speaker B: And amazing timing, I think. I want to say. I joined just about maybe like the day of or right after the market topped in 2018. So it was amazing January, great timing. And that started my crypto journey. From there I went to Galaxy, where cold the investment business, and was there for a few years before starting hyperlane about a year and a half ago. And throughout this whole time, being not an engineer by trade, coming into crypto, it really reminded me of like, oh, I remember when I first got an Internet connection in the mid ninety s.
00:06:38.780 - 00:07:26.138, Speaker B: I grew up in Israel, 1996, get our first Internet connection. But some of my cousins, some of my friends who were on the different ISP, we couldn't all see the same websites because at that age, we were still limited to, they called them portals, or like, you were accessing your ISP's portal, and within like a year or two, all of us were just on the web, www. And everything just worked. So I thought crypto would be like exactly the same. And so I remember 2017, okay, this thing is super cool, but once there will be a bunch of them, they can't talk. That's weird. And then things like Cosmos and Polka dot talking about their own interoperability constructions, and we started seeing that happening, but it still wasn't very seamless to that point where I was like, well, it's the end of 2021, and this is still, like an open question.
00:07:26.138 - 00:07:37.406, Speaker B: Like, why can't an app on Salana just be seamless with an app on Ethereum? How do we make this work? And one thing lent to another, and we started hyperlain about a year and a half ago.
00:07:37.508 - 00:08:09.842, Speaker A: So before we go into hyperlain, and you mentioned that you had Galaxy for a while and you led several investments there from Galaxy, I always wondered, when you're sitting on the other side of the table, the founders table and the investor table, is there a push from founders themselves? Look, this guy is amazing. I should build something similar, or I should build something so that I get the same excitement. Do you feel? And I've heard some people who do have always be on the investment side. They feel like I should join the action. Did you feel that urge as well and that pushed you over?
00:08:09.916 - 00:08:56.454, Speaker B: I definitely did. I felt it like the entire time. For me, there was like a family circumstance where part of the reason why I got into finance the first place was like, my parents, my dad got sick, I passed away a few years ago, wasn't doing, he couldn't work anymore. And so I know they have a mortgage, and I know the dollar amount I need to make every month if I'm going to live myself and pay their mortgage. Where else could I make that sum, which worked out to about 120 something thousand a year? It was either the consulting firms or the bank. I ended up with offers from a consulting firm that I liked and from Morgan Stanley, and I was like, well, those guys have slightly better hours. And I kind of like my future colleagues there a little bit more.
00:08:56.454 - 00:09:20.746, Speaker B: Like, we had a much more fun interview process that was know more my speed. And it was also a few years after the wolf of Wall street. And being on the trading desk seemed like really cool. I won't lie, that definitely had an influence. And I was right, by the way. Being on the trading desk, even though I didn't like a lot of aspects of the job, was still cool, still awesome environment. But I had that urge.
00:09:20.746 - 00:10:27.874, Speaker B: But basically, until 2020, I was always in a situation where. I was always in a situation where I kind of was living like paycheck to paycheck. And the uncertainty that comes with a singular startup was something that I felt like I couldn't risk because at that point, I'm basically paying my mom's mortgage, and if I am out of the game, is she going to lose her house? That doesn't feel like something I can afford to do. But that entire time felt that urgent. When I was leaving passport just late 2019, there were a few good situations that maybe, in retrospect, maybe I should have just taken the leap because it would have worked out really well, but I didn't. Mostly for those reasons of like, oh, man, it's not just my own risk, and now I'm putting some of my family members, my risky behavior, might risk their well being. But if you feel that urge that whole time, because you're know, now chamath kind of ruined the term and people make fun of it, but, like, the notion of the man in the, like, he didn't invent that.
00:10:27.874 - 00:10:58.574, Speaker B: That's an old, like, Roosevelt book, but there's something to that, right? Like, as an investor you are somewhat involved, but ultimately, the way I liken it to my friends who have since asked about it, you're walking around through life and you got a basket of eggs. And some eggs are big, some eggs are small, but they're eggs. There's many eggs. They say, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Sure. So the fund is your one basket, but you still have lots of eggs. And so if some of them, as long as you don't, even if you did drop the basket, some of the eggs are going to be fine.
00:10:58.574 - 00:11:44.990, Speaker B: But you start your own company, there's no basket. There's just one massive egg, and you're just walking around it with it like this. And if that egg falls, that's your egg. That's what you got. And if you're an introspective investor, which I think to be a good venture investor, you certainly have to be quite introspective and digest. Like, where did you make a mistake? Where did you convince yourself of something that wasn't there? When did you attach a belief or an action or behavior to a founder or a company when it was never there, which is a mistake that I've made and certainly many investors have made in the past. And you just realize, like, yeah, I am much more insulated.
00:11:44.990 - 00:12:03.220, Speaker B: My risk profile looks materially different than that of those people that I'm backing. And for some people, that is the appeal. And for other people, while it is appealing, there's also here this call of, like, I want to go to the other side.
00:12:06.470 - 00:12:43.806, Speaker A: Sometimes people do the other way as well. Right? You found successful and then you fell. Okay, no, I don't have to work anymore. I would just do angel investments or whatever. You sometimes go and join VC firms as well. From your perspective, coming the other way around, do you feel that as with someone who has made investments in the past or has that experience, does it give you any advantage compared to, let's say, a first time founder, which doesn't have that experience? Investment experience, given that once you make investment, you have seen how founders behave and you learn what to do and what not to do? So any thoughts on that?
00:12:43.828 - 00:14:23.390, Speaker B: I think both situations kind of give you some advantage and some you get things that you benefit from and you get things that are drawbacks. And so I think there's a really good reason why lots of successful, and even like semi successful founders later on become really great investors. Their hands on experience can be very useful to them as they later on back, certain founders, and there's a certain appeal for a founder to take advantage from someone who's been in their shoes. So that's an awesome advantage for founders or startup folks turning investors, on the other hand, for investors turning into startup folks and founders themselves, the advantages that you have is if you were that introspective, if you were paying attention, you had many data points and many observations into the type of things you might be working on. There are some problems that are really predictable, that seem to happen to every company, and you get many more at bats on those. So things that are more related to the more abstract part of a business are ones you get a lot of insight into from the investor side. Things that are related to the concrete, like day to day operations are ones that as an investor, especially if you're not sitting on boards, especially if you're not really involved very early on, which is very difficult to do if you're investing, say, at series A and beyond, because the companies are mostly operating machines by themselves.
00:14:23.390 - 00:15:24.126, Speaker B: So you don't get that insight. So then you come in and you have all this abstract knowledge. How do you turn that abstract insight into concrete, actionable things that impact your day to day? I think that's quite hard. And the converse of that is that a lot of times when you move from the founder, the investor, you might be overly focused on the concrete day to day stuff, like how do you actually run the team, how do you do your stand ups or whatever process you do to just get ahead. How do you advance your company on a day by day, week by week basis? This is something that not too long ago, you and I, over a beverage, talked about, and you might get overly stuck on that. Whereas like an investor, you also do have to be concerned with those abstract things. I think there's a reason why you see a lot of osmosis between these two seats.
00:15:24.126 - 00:16:40.750, Speaker B: But one thing I'll tell you, I feel like I have gotten as high on the mountain or like I've gotten as far as you could on the investor side without crossing over. Because what I'd noticed know my partner and I, Michael Jordan, who's now started a new firm called dBA with John Charboneau, we found another John, which he's found a better John. It's good. We took galaxy and we turned it into a brand that was routinely winning very competitive deals, was boasting really strong returns, but I felt we got as high and our glass ceiling was basically neither of us having founder experience ourselves. And where we were consistently losing was to firms like Paradigm and Andreessen, Horowitz. Where amongst their top, like, whether it's Fred Ursum at Paradigm, Ben Horowitz of know, absolute legend at Andreessen. Right? Like, those are people who can credibly say, I've built one of the most enduring things in the world.
00:16:40.750 - 00:17:25.350, Speaker B: Right? And how can you compete, really, with someone who has the experience of creating the most valuable, most influential, most impactful company our entire industry has ever seen in Coinbase at the time. And even in retrospect, I was like, of course, everyone should have taken a check from them over from us, because they know what it's like to be in your shoes, because they've probably been in a similar situation. And so I think that's something where even if you did want to become the best venture investor that you can be, someone who has crossed over will always have that advantage on you. I think there's really only one way to get it, and it's by going into the arena.
00:17:25.510 - 00:17:49.220, Speaker A: Sure. Okay. I think we could discuss this all day. So let's move over to hyperlane stuff. And I think the interesting bit as well there. And you mentioned about that you're observing cosmona other things as well. If you were to say, okay, what was one thing that you felt, okay, that triggered you to start hyperlain, that triggered you to think about interoperability, what was one thing that you would mention?
00:17:52.070 - 00:17:54.706, Speaker B: Well, I guess the, where you tried.
00:17:54.728 - 00:17:58.854, Speaker A: To move things around and you felt like, oh, my God, what am I doing now?
00:17:58.892 - 00:18:59.302, Speaker B: Yes, I won't name the chain because it was very silly, but this is like, I don't know, February or March of 2021, and me and a bunch of friends are very excited about this. We all basically want to speculate on some coin. And to get to that coin, we had to bridge over to some chain, and we used their default bridge. And it was a mind denomingly unpleasant experience, because what happened was that the folks who built it, they built what looked like a very sleek, very nice bridging experience. But at the end of it, you were left without gas on that chain that you arrived at. So you go from Ethereum to this other chain, and you get there, and yeah, you bridged over your ETH. But you know what you don't have? You don't have that chain's native asset.
00:18:59.302 - 00:19:26.238, Speaker B: So you're stuck. And at the time, that asset was not obtainable on any US based exchange because of you're stuck. And me and like, 15 of my friends are all like, stand. It was very funny. It was like the crypto equivalent of being stuck on an island because you can't go back. If you don't have gas to pay, you can't go in. There's no discernible way for you to obtain that gas.
00:19:26.238 - 00:20:15.858, Speaker B: And I was like, this is just bananas. I can't believe that this is still happening. And I don't know, had to have been several thousand people who were similarly stranded, such that eventually they changed it, such that once you did that bridging, you paid a little bit of a fee and they took care of you got some gas dust, basically, so that it wouldn't happen to you again. But that was the one where I was like, mother, I can't believe this is like, that was when I started going out of my way to. I was always very interested in the category. I'd say I made several investments, but that was what the hell is going on? Type of thing. And it was basically on my mind, like, every day since then.
00:20:15.858 - 00:20:24.900, Speaker B: And six months after that was when we really started sitting down and having those initial conversations that led to this company now being a thing.
00:20:26.810 - 00:20:46.138, Speaker A: For those who have heard of, who may not have heard of hyperlink now, do you think that this recent push towards modularity has something to do with or has shaped your product offering as well? How has that.
00:20:46.224 - 00:20:46.860, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:20:47.390 - 00:20:49.062, Speaker A: And what has that done for hyperlink?
00:20:49.126 - 00:21:28.230, Speaker B: Absolutely, man. That's an excellent question. Excellent phrasing. I would say that hyperlink, really, to extent that you're not familiar with it, for folks in the audience, we think of it as the permissionless interoperability layer, and it's an interoperability layer that we purposely built for this world of many chains. Now thankful to folks like Celestia for giving us this, what I think is very effective use of, you know, for us. We've all been in crypto for a very long time. Some of my team, I'm not even the longest tenured in crypto.
00:21:28.230 - 00:22:45.060, Speaker B: And we've kind of noticed that every time blockchains, kind of by design, restrict block space, they make a digital resource scarce. And now we kind of compete over the usage of it. And right now, when there's not a ton of demand, that's totally fine. We're not plagued by these super high gas fees, but ultimately, with a constrained amount of block space in a single chain, either everyone's going to pay obscenely high gas fees when demand increases, or we increase the supply of this constrained block space through other chains. So once you do that, well, we're going to need a way to traverse between them. And I think the modular blockchain thesis, or the app chain thesis, they call it. In the cosmos, space is one of the more clear and cogent articulations of what does a world of many chains look like? But at the same time, there was one piece that was always missing from it, which was this notion of, it's not just that there's going to be all these chains, like, how are they going to communicate with each other? And so, on one hand, we have incredible tools like allplayer that make it basic, a four clicks in two minutes kind of thing, to create your own chain, customizable with tons of options.
00:22:45.060 - 00:23:21.206, Speaker B: But once you've done that, well, how do I connect it to anywhere else? And so that how do I connect it? Piece wasn't solved yet. And at the same time, how do I do it? That was getting solved. It was getting solved by folks like you guys, and then by folks like Celestia and optimism, building the op stack and building those frameworks that we can all use. And so it very much influenced our product direction because we wanted to give something that, well, if it's going to be that easy to create a chain, well, it should be that easy to connect to other chains.
00:23:21.398 - 00:24:04.726, Speaker A: And to give some context to listeners, could you also say or talk about you had bridges previously? We have seen all sorts of bridges out there. Many of them were hacked for all sorts of reasons. And you also mentioned about this permissioned or permissionless interoperability as well. So could you put that in context? What are the other bridges that existed before and how they operated and how hyperlink kind of differentiates by having a permissionless, because as we know, we know, maybe not listeners know, but you have to go through this governance process and whatnot is nightmare. So could you give a sense of what are the other types of, at least, let's say, version one of bridges, how they differentiate, how you differentiate, brother.
00:24:04.758 - 00:25:20.338, Speaker B: So let's start with you talked about those bridges getting hacked. So when it comes to this notion of connecting between chains, and everyone who's been in crypto long enough knows, like, you connect two different chains, now you are adding a whole new surface of risk to how things are doing. At minimum, you are exposed to the risk of the weaker security of those two chains that you're connecting. And now beyond that, many bridge systems, hyperlane being one of them, you also add a third element, which is like the mechanism that you use to connect between those two. And so being that security is always so top of mind, what pretty much every team that has been working on this interoperability, on this bridging problem. What they've always done is that because security, again, is such a massive preoccupation, they have put on one hand we have the product of connecting those chains, right? An interface that allows you to move assets between them to do function calls. Let's refer to all that as connecting two chains on one hand.
00:25:20.338 - 00:26:12.914, Speaker B: And then like, well, securing those communications, everyone treated those as the same thing. And so what that meant is if I want to use this one here, I got to figure out how to get past the security thing here. And security being so top of mind, folks kept competing on who can offer better and more unique forms of security, but only limiting it to one. And so really when you mentioned, right, like, well, we're all familiar with this form of interruptible, we're like, if we want it, we need to go through a governance process and get added and this and that. Really what you're doing is you want to use this thing, and so you got to ask for permission to be part of the whole security apparatus that's happening here. And so that's where most interoperability options until today have this permission design. There is only one option for security.
00:26:12.914 - 00:26:57.054, Speaker B: They tightly coupled the interface and product of connecting chains with the thing for securing that communication hybrid. We're like, wait, actually does not have to be that way. Right. I guess that was one of our insights is from first principle. There's no real reason why those two things have to be exactly the same. And so you can have an interface on one hand, and then you can have a whole host of different options that you can connect to, and some of them you might even be able to control yourself. And so with Hyperlane, we have what we call permissionless interoperability because anyone can deploy hyperlane anywhere, and then anyone can initiate a new security setting of their choosing.
00:26:57.054 - 00:27:54.500, Speaker B: And so if it's a roll up, they could use their sequencer, they could use their own fraud proof system. We have now teams that have built all sorts of really cool things using like, let's say zero knowledge proofs. And so we have a team that's built security module through hyperlane that utilizes their own ZK based light client. Like, that's not something that our team would know how to do because we're not expert zk folks, but that is something that they know how to do. And this more open and modular approach to security means that anyone can bring their security expertise, wrap it into a hyperlane module. And now I, as a developer, can use that without having to develop that myself and without having to basically sit and ask the hyperlane team to let me do that, I can just kind of take my fate into my own hands. And so that's the primary way.
00:27:54.500 - 00:28:15.530, Speaker B: This permissionless aspect and this modular security is the primary way that makes hyperlane different from other players in the field of interoperability. Now, there's advantages to the permissioned approach, and so we don't want to tell you that it's wrong. It's not for us talking about that.
00:28:15.600 - 00:28:44.318, Speaker A: The last one that you mentioned, which is historically and in many situations, we have seen that giving flexibility to developers is good, or end users, whatever is the context here, but sometimes that flexibility can be abused. Right. Do you feel like if we give people, or in some cases, that's why people give default options, right. Something that you don't usually change. Do you feel like there is a downside of giving people a lot of flexibility in this interoperab context?
00:28:44.414 - 00:29:37.426, Speaker B: For sure. One of the downsides of it, before you even get to the security aspect or the abuse aspect, I think right off the bat, the biggest drawback is, like, everyone knows this experience by now where you're like, yeah, I got 20 minutes. I should watch something. And so you turn on your TV or you log into Netflix and there's like 100 million things to watch, and you end up spending more time watching or, sorry, more time deciding what to watch than you do watching. I always hypothesize that that's be the case, that there's more time spent. And I think recently Netflix released a stat like, oh, that this one quarter was the first quarter that people spend more time choosing than they did watching. So that's the first drawback.
00:29:37.426 - 00:29:43.320, Speaker B: It's like, what do we do? Right, sorry, go ahead.
00:29:44.010 - 00:30:00.940, Speaker A: I was just saying, yes, I agree with you that this is a point where you have to do your research to understand which one is the best one. Right. Or which one is the one that fits the kind of model that you're looking for, the kind of straight offs that you're willing to make. Right? What's the second one?
00:30:02.030 - 00:30:41.042, Speaker B: So the second one is what you were talking about. So the first one, obviously is like, hey, there might be so many things. I don't know what to pick. I don't know where to get started. Just do this for me. And the second one is, if you are going to have this truly permissionless, where anyone can take your thing and put it anywhere they want, very much as we see with Uniswap, where you and I, or it's not you and I, we're nice people. But some not nice versions of us, like some unpleasant twins of ours, could just go create a uniswap pool that is malicious, that pretends to, obviously, we don't know.
00:30:41.042 - 00:31:32.822, Speaker B: Or someone could just create a pool and try to pretend to be a different token, right? They could say this is a pool, say, for what's something popular that people are anticipating. Oh, this is the front tech token, right? Someone can make a unisop pool for a token. First, anyone can make a token in college friendtech, because Ethereum is permissionless. Second, anyone can then make a market for it because uniswap is permissionless, and that could lead to people getting screwed over. And so those two are permissionless technologies that can obviously have a lot of benefit, but can certainly be abused. Similarly, once that pool has been made, someone can give interoperability access to, someone can let you access that fraudulent pool or that bad token from a different chain using hyperlane, and there's unfortunately nothing we could do to stop them. And that does suck.
00:31:32.822 - 00:32:11.830, Speaker B: And so that's the other side of the coin, no pun intended. But that's like the other side of when you go really permissionless is anything. You could use it for good. Someone can now use it for bad stuff, and there's really no easy way to stop them from doing that. Someone could create a roll up, have connectivity to it through hyperlane, and make it seem, at least on the surface, like it really is as secure as anything else that's built with hyperlane. But in reality, they could totally do something malicious. Like, they could basically steal all the collateral if they have the contracts upgradable.
00:32:11.830 - 00:32:18.782, Speaker B: So that's definitely the danger of letting people have this freedom.
00:32:18.946 - 00:32:25.900, Speaker A: Talking about people and developers, what do you think is the coolest thing that you have seen being built using hyperlink so far?
00:32:27.550 - 00:33:28.938, Speaker B: All right, there's a couple of things, but the one that so far I felt was the coolest was actually one is much nerdier and might like nerd Snipe a few people, and then the other, I think, is just like, cool. So the nerd snipey thing is not every chain has all the same capabilities as another, right? Certain chains have these pre compiles that let you do very bespoke and specific things, and it's kind of difficult to get access to those on another chain. Right. Like, you're not going to convince the chain team to add the pre compiles that you need, certainly not on a whim. And so in one case, we saw someone bring verifiable random. Actually, more than one case, we've seen it a bunch of times by now. Verifiable randomness functions to places where they don't exist using hyperlinks.
00:33:28.938 - 00:33:45.858, Speaker B: So, like, they take the item that they needed, then they run that calculation with randomness on that other chain, and then they bring the result back. And so that, I think, is just really cool. I get it's kind of dorky, and nerds might be not the most exciting thing for a lot of people.
00:33:46.024 - 00:33:53.720, Speaker A: An extension with this would be like oracle service, where you kind of have something that kind of bring the data back in.
00:33:54.730 - 00:34:41.158, Speaker B: Yes. Which, by the way, something we could talk about a little bit later. But that's probably one of the coolest things you could do with hyperlink, is actually you can give access to Oracle feeds, like some really big, well known, well trusted Oracle feeds through hyperlink. And because of the modular construction of hyperlink, you could secure that transfer using the same trust mechanism that the Oracle uses itself, like just uses by default. So pick your favorite big brand, Oracle, let's say, on Ethereum. You could bring that fee to any chain using hyperlain, and you're not trusting hyperlink security in any way. You're just leveraging the security of that system.
00:34:41.158 - 00:35:55.920, Speaker B: And that is just super cool. We definitely do see people do that second one, this one I haven't seen brought into production yet, but I would really be kind of stoked to see it. So I mentioned I had a trading background, and one thing the big banks do is they provide prime. What that basically is you keep money with Morgan Stanley, and then we give you access and we give you margin, and you can express that in lots of venues that Morgan Stanley has access to, because Morgan Stanley will make sure that that collateral is posted where you don't have to duplicate your inventory on most places, or you get to be more capital efficient because Morgan Stanley or Goldman or someone does your prime brokerage. Well, what's the equivalent in crypto? Well, if I want to trade on chain, but I have an inventory, say, of like $100,000, and I want to be active on Ethereum and I want to be active on arbitrum, and I want to be active on, say, finance chain. Well, I now need to split my inventory some way. I can't have like 100 in one place and then get access to it.
00:35:55.920 - 00:36:39.660, Speaker B: And so someone was building like a derivatives protocol where you could take the deposits of collateral from any chain without having to move it, it only gets moved when the time for it is to get liquidated, because what the protocol does is it keeps querying the value of the collateral, and only when that valor goes below the liquidation threshold, it releases, like a liquidation order. So that's pretty cool. But it's not in production yet. That's something that I think is a very cool app, and I would urge other people who are interested in the derivative space to experiment with things like that. I think it is really cool.
00:36:40.190 - 00:36:58.910, Speaker A: Nice. I have two more questions, and we have three minutes, and so I'll try to do it quickly. All right, one thing is, so what's exciting that you're building next? It could be intents, it could be solvers. Anything in particular that excites you to add as a feature?
00:36:58.990 - 00:37:47.052, Speaker B: Well, funny you mentioned it. We are actually working on something intent related, because I feel like a system like hyperlane can express intent fairly easily because the relayer in hyperlane basically just takes an intent from a user and solves it. So some for it, like solvers. So that's one that's very pragmatic. The second one, this is more so if there's any roll ups in the audience. One thing we're doing is we've always taken the approach of Everlane, of like, hey, it's very permissionless. We let people do whatever they want with it, and it's like, hey, here's how you can build with it.
00:37:47.052 - 00:38:31.850, Speaker B: Well, we've been asked more and more and more like, hey, can you actually do this for us? And so now we're creating what we call Hyperlane, like a service for hyperlain where there's a company now that will actually get hyperlain set up on your chain, take care of all the services you need. We'll get you those oracle feeds, we'll get you bridging, general messaging, whatever you need, and make it much more simple than the world where you had to do a lot of it yourself. You still can do it yourself. We welcome anyone who wants to do it themselves, but those who are interested can now come to us, and we can help them learn it.
00:38:33.260 - 00:38:44.650, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so last question. This is for the sound bites. So tell me something that you feel strongly about, but everyone disagrees with you, or people feel like, you know what? John is crazy.
00:38:45.420 - 00:39:09.604, Speaker B: So I don't know if they think I'm crazy or disagree with strongly, because I think it is. They don't know yet, but they're kind of, like, willing to believe that a certain thing is real. When I don't think it's real. I think that I don't if know, you've seen the meme of the lady on the plane where he's like, that guy is not real. I think that the idea of both decentralized and shared sequencer, that idea is not real. That's not real. That's not a thing.
00:39:09.604 - 00:39:36.488, Speaker B: No one can convince me that's a thing. Because ultimately what that is is just, it's a blockchain that takes orders from other blockchains and it's going to have the same problems that every blockchain has. And I could go on for like 20 minutes. And we love lots of the people who work on shared sequencers. I just think that those two things combined, decentralized and shared, not real. Unless you make some massive breakthrough that all of us have somehow missed.
00:39:36.664 - 00:39:37.052, Speaker A: Cool.
00:39:37.106 - 00:39:39.852, Speaker B: I hope it's real, but I don't think it is cool.
00:39:39.906 - 00:39:59.170, Speaker A: Thank you very much, John. So this would be the last question. So thank you very much for listening to us today. And thank you very much John, for coming in.
