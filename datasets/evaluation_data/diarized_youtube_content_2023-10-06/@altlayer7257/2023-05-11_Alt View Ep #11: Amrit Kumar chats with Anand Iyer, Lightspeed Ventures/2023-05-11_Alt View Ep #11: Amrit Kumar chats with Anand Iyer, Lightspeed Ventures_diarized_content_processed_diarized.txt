00:00:12.170 - 00:00:32.440, Speaker A: Hello everyone. This is Amrit Kumar, chief operating officer of Altlayer. Welcome to a new episode of Altview, where we discuss layer ones, roll ups, app chains and other blockchain infrastructures. Today I'm delighted to have Anand Ayer. Anand is the managing partner of an early stage blockchain infrastructure fund called Canonical Crypto and is also a venture partner at Lightspeed. Hello Anand, how are you?
00:00:32.810 - 00:00:34.840, Speaker B: Hey, I'm right, I'm well. How are you?
00:00:35.210 - 00:00:48.940, Speaker A: Not too bad, not too bad. Well, welcome to all of you and thank you. Thank you very much for joining me. Let's start with a quick introduction. For those who may not know you. Please tell us a bit about your background, how you came to be at Lightspeed and what brought you to the crypto land.
00:00:50.110 - 00:01:30.662, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'll try to condense it because the background is kind of long, but yeah, I was just reflecting the other day that I'm kind of hitting year 23 in sort of like my professional domain as an operator, as ex founder. But yeah, briefly, I'll kind of run through it. Back in 2001, I graduated degree in company from Purdue, started my career as a developer, building very low level sort of embedded systems protocols into this operating system known as iOS. Not the iOS that we're familiar with today, but the one that goes into Cisco routers and switches. So that's kind of how I started my. Then, you know, started to move up stack. I ended up leading developer platforms with Microsoft for a while.
00:01:30.662 - 00:01:56.394, Speaker B: So very close to sort of the world of developers. This is my comfort zone. It's where I grew up. The second chapter of my career, the second decade was mostly focused on starting companies and being a CEO. But somewhere along the way, in 2013, I got introduced to bitcoin through a very close friend of mine. We started mining bitcoin. It was sort of the first exposure, but it felt sort of like there was a lot of novelty on starting to mine bitcoin out of the gate.
00:01:56.394 - 00:02:30.662, Speaker B: But then the novelty sort of wore off because it was kind of an autopilot plateau. The rate of learning wasn't really there per se. It was sort of like mini optimizations here or there. So I think I kind of fell off the crypto bandwagon for a while. Heard about Cosmos coming up, and then Ethereum, and then finally with smart contracts, programmability. That made a lot more sense to me because just having grown up in that world, I was like, okay, this computes now. And so my wife and I made an investment early on in this company called stacks, which was sort of like bringing programmability to bitcoin, because again, I was like, okay, I know bitcoin.
00:02:30.662 - 00:03:07.974, Speaker B: I get programmability. This makes perfect sense. So that was sort of like, I'd say, where the robbers started to meet the road as far as like crypto exposure, investing in companies, et cetera. Our company, we exited in 2018, and then at that point I decided to go deeper into crypto because I always had this thread, never really explored it as much. Started building a few things here and there, and then started teaching a class on DeFi, and eventually decided that I think I want to support a lot of early stage founders, having been one myself, having been through the journey, having been a developer, product person, et cetera. So that's how canonical was born. And along the way I met lightspeed, who've been an incredible partner to me.
00:03:07.974 - 00:03:21.562, Speaker B: And, yeah, so I have this role where I do really early stage investments, are economical and can participate and invest in later stage companies at a light speed. And yeah, that's the makeup. And that's kind of what brings me here.
00:03:21.696 - 00:03:33.540, Speaker A: In terms of stack, you mentioned you moved from down to top as well. So in terms of stack today, of course in aven crypto you have infrastructure. But then you mentioned about DeFi applications. What part of the stack interests you the most?
00:03:34.390 - 00:04:35.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say, like, the lowest layers are still very interesting to me, and everything from layer ones on up to middleware or even sort of orthogonal or tangential services to the stack itself. So they may not live in the blockchain sandwich, so to speak, but they live in the periphery. Companies like invest in a company called Sentier, for example, which is like a monitoring and observability service, which isn't really running on chain, but is harnessing on chain data to provide insights into what's happening on chain. So I'd say that where I've been honing in my thesis is to really support companies that are basically selling to developers. I feel like that's where the developer is the end user or the customer. I feel like that's where I'd like to get involved. The second is also I feel like the further down the stack you go, I think maybe in the crypto world this is sort of defying this thesis that I think the further down the stack you go, the more defensible your offering can get.
00:04:35.494 - 00:04:52.486, Speaker B: Although I think we're seeing a lot of very interesting good teams build products that even though they may be very technically complex in nature, which in the non web3 world that's typically been challenging to do.
00:04:52.508 - 00:04:52.646, Speaker A: Right?
00:04:52.668 - 00:05:12.990, Speaker B: Or you have one incumbent sort of platform, like the implementation of TCP IP, for example, is like a foregone conclusion, but that's different in the world of crypto. But that's short answer. Your question is that that's typically where I tend to focus is lower down the stack infrastructure or where the end user is a developer. That's where I get most excited.
00:05:13.330 - 00:05:47.210, Speaker A: Got it. Let's talk a little bit about the investment space. And of course, there have been very, I would say Lightspeed, for example, is one of the new entrants, I suppose, in the crypto investment space. I'm not sure when exactly lightspeed started investing in the crypto, but could you tell us how and when VC firm decides to invest in a new space like crypto? It could be now. Of course, AI is a big thing. Of course, it was big for quite a while, but now it's becoming even hotter at what point a VC firm decides, okay, now this is something that we can't ignore.
00:05:47.870 - 00:06:50.320, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. The one quick point is that Lightspeed has actually been investing in crypto for about a decade now, and it's been sort of under the radar. It's, like, surprising. But they've got some investments that date way back, and the earliest days, they've been sort of active in the space. So I think it's been an ongoing theme. And even if you talk to Ravi Matre, who's one of the founding partners of the firm, he's just a fascinating person who's always had just been able to read the tea leaves and see what's coming up ahead and ensure that the firm is looking at opportunities that, again, the question really is what does it look like to live in the future and what becomes steady state in the future, and how do we help accelerate companies who are helping us get to that point? So kind of using that vantage point, I think the firm has always had a leg up and thinking about, like, hey, let's support these initiatives. And in all honesty, some of these may not be the right thing for now, but we should start thinking about.
00:06:50.320 - 00:08:02.838, Speaker B: And to answer your other question about how does a firm start thinking about some of these? You know, we look at these in forms, know, I think as beige, who's also one of the leading partners of the firm, has mentioned, which, know, we think about them as sort of s curves, right? So you kind of want to time these and think about, like, okay, for example, something may be looking interesting right now, or the technology is fascinating. But what are some of the things that we need to see to make sure that this becomes mainstream or becomes interesting, right? So great example is like AI you brought up, right? So I'm sure with you or me, I remember AI is not new. I took an AI class in school in 1999, right? Like it was a long time ago. And I used Lisp to pretend like I knew what I was doing with AI. That was my only exposure to AI. But I think it took this amount of time for us to get to this point that we needed the proliferation of data on the Internet to then train models and then get to an end user product like chat, GPT to be like, whoa, this is now happening, right? Like everything we talked about. And similarly, I think we need to have certain catalysts or tailwinds for technology to become interesting.
00:08:02.838 - 00:08:53.494, Speaker B: And so I'd say a few things kind of need to come together. And I think for a firm like lightspeed to get excited, it really is about the novelty of the technology and how it sort of accelerates or how that technology component helps us become more efficient or just proliferates and helps us in our day to day life. And just kind of reading that number one. But also, second, looking at what the right timing for this needs to be is another thing that's interesting. Looking at catalysts and those could be anything, right? It could be just technology, innovation, timing, regulation, any one of these things could be catalysts for that. And, yeah, just also, I think we just need to have depth and understanding in this space, right? So it's not like, hey, by the way, this is fascinating, let's go invest in that area. I don't think that's quite good enough.
00:08:53.494 - 00:09:33.794, Speaker B: Right. We need to have people who can be good thought partners and supporters for the CEOs and founders are going to be building things in the space. So building up our internal acumen and know how and also the vernacular to make sure that we can support these companies really well. So those are some of the things that need to come together. So, yeah, we start to build know, we talk about this. I'm very fortunate to know sort of in the mix when they talk about these things at light speed and get a feel for how someone like Ravi, who's been doing this for over two decades, thinks about this and how brass tax, when it comes together to framework. Let's be like, hey, it's not about building conviction here.
00:09:33.794 - 00:09:52.946, Speaker B: This is going to happen. Let's go out and make sure that we're ready to support founders when they're building this space. So, yeah, you're right. There's a big concerted effort and focus on AI, which I think is incredible. And it's going to be such an amazing accelerant for so many things. Also scary. But yeah, I think we're generally excited.
00:09:53.058 - 00:10:19.700, Speaker A: It's a good scary thing. It's something that you're excited about. Indeed. I agree. Talking about Web three itself, of course, you started a long time back, but could you tell me a little bit more about your web3 thesis and has it evolved over time? Do you feel like, okay, what you believed in, I don't know, five, six years ago is very different today, and your thesis moving forward is probably different from what you had in mind, let's say, five, six years ago.
00:10:20.710 - 00:11:03.322, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, and I shared this with you earlier. Right. Which is the focus on infrastructure, the focus on developers, and getting more tooling for developers in the ecosystem continues to be sort of an area of focus. And I think when you look at the report electric capital publishes, which talks about the number of active developers in this space, I think we're still several orders of magnitude behind. If you look at sort of the non web3 space, I think it's like somewhere between 25 and 30 million developers or something like that. And if you look at our space, it's like in the tens of thousands of developers, right. That know how to code or build things in the world of crypto.
00:11:03.322 - 00:11:57.490, Speaker B: And that's across the stack. Right. So I think we have a long ways to catch up. So I continue to think about what do we need, and not just from an educational standpoint, because that is necessary as well, but also from a tooling standpoint to help accelerate just the growth and proliferation of developers in our ecosystem. So that's like the high level thesis. I really love that world and I continue to believe that getting more developers into this space is what's going to help us move forward, help move crypto in general move forward, because I think the fundamentals of what the blockchain has to offer are pretty sound. And I think sometimes the outside narrative, I think it's a little bit confusing because sometimes there's this confusion around crypto prices, crypto assets and pricing versus underlying technology.
00:11:57.490 - 00:12:40.238, Speaker B: Right. There's a big disconnect there when it comes to people who are not in the know, like you and me are. But I think getting more developers here to support other developers coming on board, building foundational use cases for the blockchain, I think going to be really interesting as we look forward, because I think we've got. We do go through cycles and phases, right. Of infrastructure. So let me zoom out for a second. And I think there's maybe Union Square ventures that have done a really good job of documenting this, which is there was bitcoin itself as a white paper, and then there was BTC, which was the token, right? So there's like the infrastructure piece and the actual consumer piece, right.
00:12:40.238 - 00:13:16.826, Speaker B: And then we've gone through sort of waves of this over time. We've got infrastructure applications. Infrastructure applications. And I think we've got a lot of infrastructure that's been built. And so, yeah, I think that's, long story short, I focus on sort of like the bottom layers that continues to be the thesis. The only outlier, and you touched upon this earlier, tends to be defi for me because although I don't have a finance background by any stretch, my sort of concerted view when I came into this, it was very top down and it happened to be through Defi. And I was just fascinated by this because it started to challenge a lot of assumptions we have around traditional finance today, right.
00:13:16.826 - 00:14:04.758, Speaker B: Like how you and I operate. If I wanted to send you money, the things that we have all taken for granted yet we still do in the traditional finance world just got completely disarmed and turned on its head thanks to decentralized finance. And I think it is, of all the product suites we've seen today, deFi, NFTs, gaming, social and maybe NFT is pretty far ahead. I think DeFi to me has shown product market fit, although albeit has been with a group of people, a group of degents, like you and me. Like us. But I think it's shown that it works, right? So for us to then cross the chasm and make it more mainstream, there needs to be some tailwinds that need to come into play. So yeah, I'd say defi infrastructure are the thesis.
00:14:04.758 - 00:14:57.574, Speaker B: It hasn't changed too much. And this is my last point and I promise I'll stop rambling about this specific question, which is with the sort of incidents that have happened over the last year, whether it's FTX or other things, the question always comes up or like, are you changing anything? What's going to change? Right. And for me personally, nothing has changed dramatically because the technology is still sound. There were bad actors in this space who misused the way the platform should be run and obviously used custom deposit in malicious ways, like one specific instance. But aside from that, yeah, it's not a situation where dramatically, suddenly the focus for what the blockchain is, is changing. Right? Or suddenly like, hey, there's a new movement here, let's kind of latch onto that. That's not the goal.
00:14:57.574 - 00:15:15.890, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'd say largely it's been the same and it's going to stay central, looking forward. And if anything, I'm personally quite excited about some of the use cases that I'm seeing now that I hadn't seen before that are actually being catalyzed by things like AI. So, yeah, that's what keeps me jazzed and excited.
00:15:16.630 - 00:15:55.790, Speaker A: You mentioned electric capital, and for those who don't know, they publish annual reports on developer activity across different chains by the entire blockchain space in general. And one interesting, I think, point that they found in the last report that they published was that new wallets, I mean, depends on how you define it. But the wallet that did first transaction, basically, if you had a fresh wallet, and if you look at the history of that wallet, the first transaction that that wallet did was in most cases was actually NFT transaction as opposed to DeFi transaction. Were you surprised by this result or you felt like that's actually normal?
00:15:57.010 - 00:16:09.586, Speaker B: What's the sort of surprise? Yeah, I'm not surprised at all. I think if you look at the, I mean, there's so many ways to unpack this.
00:16:09.608 - 00:16:09.746, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:09.768 - 00:16:53.794, Speaker B: So I was riffing with another investor the other day that I think if you look at the trend lines and what has been a big catalyst for crypto over the last few years. Right. Let's say, like, between the 2019 to 2022 era, that vintage, the catalyst were really, like, it started with DFI in a lot of ways, but there was also the NFT movement really picked up in a huge way, and it became a form of, again, just like as humans. Right. And for those, especially who are looking at assets or looking at artwork in a speculative way and people who appreciate that, this is like a natural entry point for them, right. So I'm not surprised at all. Like, that's the case.
00:16:53.794 - 00:17:30.854, Speaker B: It's actually a little bit more, perhaps less nuanced and easier to grok than something like, let's, let's be honest, right. I think for the average user, an interface like OpenSea is a little bit more acceptable than something like, I don't know, curve. Right. So I'd say that it's just more reasonable. And that doesn't mean that the buck stops there. You may start there. And if you're sophisticated and you feel like you want to take some more risk or want to learn a little bit more then you enter the world of deFi.
00:17:30.854 - 00:18:07.990, Speaker B: But yeah, it just depends on appetite. Right. And sort of where, again, you feel most comfortable. So not surprised at all. And I hope that trend actually kind of continues because nfts, again, to us, we think of NFTs, we think of artwork, but that doesn't have to be where the buck stops, right? There could be other form of non fungibles that get introduced on chain, and I think there's a ways to go before we get there. But that could be an interesting way in which people still get on board into the world of crypto, but may not even know that they're doing so, which I hope is where we end up in sort of steady state format.
00:18:09.050 - 00:18:59.900, Speaker A: I have one more question on sort of VCs and that landscape and how VCs kind of, kind of see projects in the crypto space. And I've spoken to some of them, and it feels like there's probably a different way in which crypto native VCs operate. And there's a different way in which, let's say traditional VCs operate. And what I mean is traditional situation, traditional VCs who are actually investing in crypto as well. So not like those who want to stay away from crypto. From your perspective, do you feel like they actually do operate differently? And the other question would be that around valuations, do you feel like the valuations that a valuation that, let's say a traditional VC fund would give a crypto project would be very different from valuation that, let's say crypto native project VC would give. Do you feel that difference from where you stand?
00:19:00.430 - 00:19:53.786, Speaker B: Yeah, on the first one, in terms of how we think about deals, I think it really comes down to one thing, which is focus, right? So when you enter a space like this, which is so nuanced and there's so much depth, right? Like in tip of the iceberg from outside in, as we talked about, looking at crypto assets and pricing as one, or people look at NFTs, maybe some subsection have heard of those. I'd say defi may be a distant third in terms of just general awareness of what crypto has to offer. But underneath this is like this giant iceberg underneath of beautiful tech, right. So it makes a ton of sense for there to be focus. And I think a lot of the crypto native funds bring by just being able to focus and eliminating all the other noise. Noise is not the right word, but like everything else is happening in this world, they're just able to go deep. Right.
00:19:53.786 - 00:20:37.586, Speaker B: So I think that's what a crypto native fund can bring. So I think when a movement like this begins, I think the investment in going into starting a fund that's heavily focused makes a ton of sense. I think that's the difference. I think larger platforms, like a lightspeed, we can have multiple focus areas because of the size and the Aum. And so we can have crypto focus, we have a healthcare focus, we can have an enterprise AI focus, it's consumer focus, et cetera. But if you're a smaller fund, just getting started with whatever the fund size might be, and you want to be hyper focused here, that makes a ton of sense. And as time goes on and as you show signs of success and you raise more capital and you continue to double down, because the depth of what you want to see here starts to grow and your conviction starts to grow as well.
00:20:37.586 - 00:21:19.986, Speaker B: So that's the primary sort of difference I hear. I'd say, in terms of valuation, that's a tough one for me. I don't see a discrepancy here, per se. I'd say that we all sort of collectively work together on understanding. Like, hey, where do things need to be at this point in time in the market? I'd say maybe the one nuance is that when it comes to a multi stage, multidisciplinary fund, you're sort of weighing an opportunity to invest in this specific company at a specific valuation compared to some other companies and other valuations.
00:21:20.018 - 00:21:20.166, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:20.188 - 00:22:14.374, Speaker B: So you may be looking at this versus maybe an investment AI, and how do you gauge, or how do you compare the two? And every fund operates differently. Some funds have specific focus areas, but that sort of thought process doesn't need to come in to compare one opportunity in crypto versus another one in another subsector. But when you're a crypto native fund, that's all you're looking at, right? Like, you're not comparing it to anything else that's happening in the market. But across the board, there is a general calibration that tends to happen. So I don't think this is necessarily something that needs to happen in a crypto native versus a more broader fund, so to speak. But that's been my experience in the time that I've been investing, is that, yeah, I think we tend to sort of calibrate in lockstep. There doesn't tend to be any nuance when it comes to sort of a broader fund versus a native fund.
00:22:14.374 - 00:22:16.040, Speaker B: So to it.
00:22:16.490 - 00:23:02.120, Speaker A: Okay, let's move a little bit away from now investments and sort of focus more on the infra side of things. And let's start with a controversial or edgy question. And so basically, I think Vitalik put out a blog post talking about the end game for Ethereum, which is around scalability and how Ethereum would actually scale. And he kind of positioned the whole thing as ZK roll ups are basically the end game. So you'd have zk roll ups that could be as an L two form, or it could be l three s and whatnot. And you would scale the underlying Ethereum using by pushing execution off the chain. And so the first question would be, do you believe ZK roll ups are the end game of chain infra? Because some of the l ones out there, I won't name them, but basically they would say, look, we have a very competing platform.
00:23:02.120 - 00:23:11.180, Speaker A: So what's your perspective on this? First of all, do you feel like ZKs are indeed the end game, or even alternate layer ones actually have a place of their own?
00:23:13.230 - 00:23:39.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say that. I'd say roll ups in general have shown promise. Right. I think we've gotten to that point now. If you look at sort of where we are today compared to where we were about a year ago, I'd say the progress has been sort of immense. Right. Like we wanted to get to this point with arbitrum, with optimism out there, a few ZK EvMs now also coming to life.
00:23:39.620 - 00:24:12.826, Speaker B: So it feels like a very good spot in terms of just roll up technology. I think obviously one roll up technology optimistic versus ZK. And I think we made that progress, obviously. Super impressed with how the arbitrum team has been just executing in full transparency. They're lightspeed portfolio companies. We've been a little bit more close to them and very impressed with sort of like how they've hit all the milestones that they promised to hit over time, and just general understanding of what the community needs. So it's been interesting to watch that.
00:24:12.826 - 00:25:03.254, Speaker B: So I think specifically, to answer your question, are zk roll ups of the end state? I'd say there's a few more things that we need to see to get there, and I think today we're starting to see these come to life. I think everything from the hardware stack to the software layer, I think we're starting to see a lot more things that need to come together for that to happen. But I think it is happening. And whether it's scroll, whether it's Polygon, ZK EVM, I think we're kind of trending in that direction. So I think the short answer is I think roll ups are end state. I don't know if it's ZK or not, because I think we're starting to see that arbitrum is just like doing an incredible job and would love to see progress happen there. And so much of Ethereum or even L2s like arbitrum, there's like network effects really dictate where the pendulum sort of swings and settles.
00:25:03.254 - 00:25:47.370, Speaker B: Right? So you talked about like alternate l ones. And you also asked earlier, what are the trends? Or what are some things you've seen? And we have seen this over the years, which is, I think it is definitely exciting when you have an l one that's like, hey, we're going to solve for the trilemma in an elegant way by doing these things. There may be some other compromises along the way, but here's how we'll get there. But I think we've just seen that. Let me put it this way. I think in ten years, if you and I were to be having this chat, we'll still be talking about Ethereum and we'll be talking about settlement maybe happening down at L1 at that point. But will we be.
00:25:47.370 - 00:26:59.838, Speaker B: I struggle to think about what that means in the context of another L1 at that point in time. That's a tough one for me to answer, because I think just having learned lessons over the last five, six years, I think you'd start to see that just because of network effects, the comfort zone kind of brings us back into Ethereum, and we're happy with what that offers to developers. Now, that being said, there are some novel things being built in other L1s, right? So I think it'd be great to learn from them and try to figure out how, for example, specifically the programmability model, right? Bringing the move like framework. I think that's really novel. And the way I think about it is that it sort of reduces the surface area for things to go wrong. Whereas I think maybe the analog, like I use in my head as a sort of old school programmer, is that I remember the only way you could have built an iOS app back in the day was using Swift, right? And then, I'm sorry, using objective C. And then you had, I almost said objective suite, objective C, and then you had something like Swift coming along, which was a lot more tenable and acceptable by developers.
00:26:59.838 - 00:27:19.960, Speaker B: And so I think we're going to see progressions like that which could draw developer mind share and could have an interesting. And then you have to marry that with go to market. But I'd say the comfort zone is very strong today when it comes to Ethereum and roll up technology at large. It's a wait and watch kind of situation.
00:27:20.570 - 00:27:37.978, Speaker A: At least the good thing about this roll up is not just about the roll up itself, but also that you're moving execution out of the chain. Right. Of the main chain. And now, since you mentioned move, now you can have an execution layer that actually runs move as its VM. Move VM. And then that's true. You can have a sovereign chain attached to Ethereum.
00:27:37.978 - 00:27:48.180, Speaker A: So you post data back on Ethereum, but you still have a VM that is moved. So you could still process transactions and could still be attached to Ethereum in many ways.
00:27:49.030 - 00:28:06.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree with you. I think that's a great point. I think we've seen some examples of this with other frameworks as well. I think move is definitely an interesting one that's definitely catered to what we want to see on a blockchain. Right. So, yeah, that'll be fascinating.
00:28:06.850 - 00:28:29.070, Speaker A: And by the way, last time we spoke, I think it was a couple of months ago, probably more than that. We spoke and we discussed about app chains. And I think around the same time, you also tweeted, if I remember correctly, that app chains will be inevitable for most apps. What is your thesis on app chains in general? And the follow up question would be, how does that thesis differ from app roll ups?
00:28:30.050 - 00:29:27.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the progression that we will likely see is, and again, I'll use sort of an old school analog and sort of like, this is how I at least think about things in my head, because we've seen this progression over the years. Right? So creating a smart contract and deploying it on a layer one or a L2 today feels like what you might do with a proof of concept on Heroku. Right? If you kind of get up and running and the variable entry is actually very low. And, yeah, you could test such a hypothesis very quickly and see, all right, am I trending in the right direction? As your product starts to get bigger, your protocol starts to get bigger. And we've seen some of these start to kind of push the limits. Right? Like, some of these protocols are like, yeah, every basis point matters. This was a story or narrative, like last year, like, gas fees are too expensive, so we need better scaling solutions.
00:29:27.118 - 00:29:35.954, Speaker B: If not, we'll plateau where we are. This is untenable for us to perform certain transactions on chain, so we need to think about what comes next.
00:29:35.992 - 00:29:36.098, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:36.104 - 00:29:58.682, Speaker B: So is there another l one? There's no L two s. Around today. That was the narrative about a year ago. But again, going back to the progression, you have something like, I want to deploy something and test on Heroku. Heroku becomes unsustainable, untenable. At some point you migrate off and you use something like Ec two, and at some point you get so big, right? And there's some outliers here. It's not for everyone.
00:29:58.682 - 00:30:32.566, Speaker B: But then you're like, hey, I need to manage my own data center, right? That's kind of the progression that tends to happen. So I think we're kind of seeing similar things. You start off on an l one and you're like, wait a second, I need to go to an l two for various reasons, for scalability reasons. And then the end game might be that, like, hey, I'm just so big right now that everything here matters to me, right? Like every single basis point matters to me. And I need to think about an app chain here. Obviously. I think DyDx is probably the leading example of this and maybe there may be more to come.
00:30:32.566 - 00:31:34.650, Speaker B: And again, there's trade offs here, right? I think when you get as big as the Dydx off using something like tendermint cosmos, you need to think about how you spin up your own marketplace of validators, et cetera. It's a lot of work. It's not for the faint of heart. So in that sense, I think roll up technology makes a little bit more sense because you get sort of like that bootstrap network out of the gate, which is a little bit harder to do when you're starting to use an app chain that is sort of customized or it needs to be customized for your purposes. So, yeah, I'd say that it seems inevitable that protocols are going to get bigger because they will get bigger because there's going to be more traction. And as they start to get bigger, they're going to need, every single one of these things are going to start to matter to them, like optimizing for what their sort of take rate is. And when that starts to happen, you still want the novelty of the blockchain without compromising decentralization, other sort of native things that the blockchain has to offer.
00:31:34.650 - 00:32:18.106, Speaker B: And you just can't do that with, at some point you'll hit a limit and you want to be able to spin up your own chain. I guess maybe a more crass analog is that you want to start off by learning to swim in the same pool that everyone else is swimming in, but at some point you're like, I don't want to be swimming here. I think you want to sort of migrate off and you're a high performance swimmer, right? You want your own lane and you want to swim really fast. And how do you do that without everyone's crowding up the pool? So, yeah, I think that feels like where we will head and we start to see some breakouts here. Maybe we'll see some more in the coming years, and I think that's where we'll roll up, no pun intended, about.
00:32:18.208 - 00:32:41.120, Speaker A: Roll ups and app chains as two different, I guess, infrastructure or technology. Do you feel like there could be applications that are better off on a roll up or better off an app chain but not on roll ups? Do you feel like there are certain types of applications that are well suited for one type of infrastructure and not for the other?
00:32:44.770 - 00:33:30.670, Speaker B: That's a good question. I'd say that depends on sort of, like, how much work the app sort of wants to underwrite and take on and how much you want to leverage the technology of the underlying chain itself. Right. So again, you look at something like cosmos tendermint or substrate on one end of the spectrum, and then you look at what you can get with l three s on another ecosystem altogether. There's definitely trade offs there, right. And honestly, we've seen some success there with osmosis or others, and I think it's a matter of time when we start to see some folks sort of leveraging what l three s have to offer. So I think, yeah, it is truly a trade up situation.
00:33:30.670 - 00:33:49.640, Speaker B: Right. Like, what are you trying to optimize it for? How much bandwidth do you have? How much do you want to compromise or how much do you want to forego? When you look at one offering versus another, and I don't think folks are going to take that lightly. Like, you'll have to do a lot of research and diligence to make sure that you're getting truly what you're expecting there.
00:33:50.330 - 00:34:38.260, Speaker A: Got it. One thing again, I don't have a firm answer to this, but I felt always like this. The good thing about roll ups is that at least you have an l one to fall back to. There could be interesting application scenarios where, I don't know, you want to tap into l two, l one in some way, and it gives you that way to fold back in some way, while in case of app change, you simply cannot do that unless, let's say, for example, the cosmos hub in some way allows some of these things in the center. Again, I don't have a concrete example of what actually makes sense in an app chain world. In a roll up world, which doesn't make sense in an app chain world. Anyway, you mentioned.
00:34:40.070 - 00:35:16.400, Speaker B: I was just going to say sorry, that I think it's an important distinction. Right. Like you're right. I mean, when you look at sort of like what you want to get codified on Ethereum as an L1, right. At the end of the day, because that's what you get with some of these l three s that we're starting to see proliferate now. Whereas not to say that any one of these other blockchains, because they are going to live forever and not dissipate, but yeah, I think you can really take advantage of an l one like Ethereum if that's where things get settled. And again, when we talk about where do you see this in ten years? Right.
00:35:16.400 - 00:35:38.214, Speaker B: I think you have this, a great degree of confidence that we'll still be talking about Ethereum in that point in time. And not to say that your own standalone chain will not survive the test of time, but you have that comfort, like you said, which I think is an interesting point to consider. And it's something that folks should take into a rubric. Into that rubric when you think about which direction you want to go in.
00:35:38.332 - 00:36:11.410, Speaker A: Indeed, you mentioned and you believe that most dapps that will become big enough, they would want to go their own route. And so in that world where some of the biggest Dapps are actually sitting on their own chain or sitting on their own roll ups, in that world, do you disagree with the fat protocol thesis that Union Square Ventures talked about many years ago? And what is your take on that? In that world where some of these big dapps, like DydX, uniswap and let's say, Aave, for example, move to the own chain.
00:36:13.590 - 00:36:36.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a great question for them. Right. Because I think when you think about where we were at that point in time when that was written, I think these concepts were somewhat novel. Right. The notion of an app specific chain might have been a little premature to consider at that point in time.
00:36:38.270 - 00:36:38.586, Speaker A: But.
00:36:38.608 - 00:36:58.686, Speaker B: The analog is not drastically dissimilar. Right. The bottom most layer is going to accrue value. In this case, the app and the chain are exactly the same. Right. So I think the stack and the way it's envisioned makes perfect sense. It's just that the chain in this case may not necessarily be ethereum.
00:36:58.686 - 00:37:44.206, Speaker B: Right. Like it might be your own chain, which I think is, again, there's novelty associated with that also. I think that's one way to think about, I think, the framework. But if I were to zoom on for a second, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well, but my vision of this end state, end state is wrong. We're like the steady state is that we are as, let's say, consumers or retail investors or gamers or NFT traders. We're interacting with a product, a protocol, an app, yet we are oblivious, maybe, or like, this notion of what's happening underneath is largely obfuscated from us. So I think the question really is, I think, bottoms up.
00:37:44.206 - 00:38:19.274, Speaker B: We care about where these things lie, right? Is it ethereum is its own app chain? How does security work? How does interop work? All these things matter to us at that point. But I think where I'm hoping things will settle is that to the end user, this is largely obfuscated, right? Because today the user has to go through this mental model of like, wait a second, what is this protocol? It's on this other l one. I need to get a wallet for that l one. I don't even know how to get the native token for that specific l one, so I need to go get it from somewhere, transfer to this wallet. It's such a mess, right? So anyhow, I'm curious if you share that notion that at some point, my.
00:38:19.312 - 00:39:05.546, Speaker A: Feeling is that if we do go in that world where some of the biggest dapps, or the biggest dapps out there in the market, they have their own app chain or app roll up in that model, I still feel like the infrastructure itself is actually a part of the app, even though you're not exposed to it directly. But at least it's part of the same stack in my perspective. Because in most cases, let's say the app has a token, that token will be used for gas fees and things like that on the app chain itself as well. So the value will still keep going on the, you can call it, because the same token is being used both at the application layer and as well as the infrastructure layer. It kind of captures the same thing. It's kind of like one mashed up fusion rather than separate from my view.
00:39:05.728 - 00:39:08.140, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good way to look at it.
00:39:09.070 - 00:39:45.862, Speaker A: Let's talk about a similar thesis that it's doing rounds in the last couple of months, which is around the fat wallet thesis, because people believe that now wallets have become. And people are not thinking about wallets that much five, six years ago, right? People. Wallets are just something that you simply cannot capture value at. It's something that which is completely free, open source, and it's very difficult. And that has changed because now wallets have become entry points. And you can put in Dexes and whatnot, you can integrate Dexes and exchanges and whatnot. You can integrate fiat on ramps and you can actually capture a lot of value there.
00:39:45.862 - 00:39:54.890, Speaker A: So what is your thoughts on that? Do you feel like wallets are going to be the big place to capture values, value for investors as well as users?
00:39:57.070 - 00:40:28.280, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I think there's a place for wallets where. For retail activity. Right. If I were to ask, I don't want to put you on the spot because I think it might be sharing something that's personal. But to me, I think within our community or like our group of builders or folks who are sort of in the know, we don't use the Dex functionality that comes within a wallet because that's just for many different reasons. Right.
00:40:28.280 - 00:40:37.766, Speaker B: Level of customization, or parameterization or slippage or the fees that we may have to pay the wallet, we don't know exactly what's happening there.
00:40:37.788 - 00:40:37.926, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:37.948 - 00:40:49.274, Speaker B: So we'll go to our Dex and we'll use the wallet to do that. Now, if you look at that exact same product, but in the hands of a retail investor or consumer, Coinbase is a quintessential example.
00:40:49.312 - 00:40:49.418, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:49.424 - 00:40:52.826, Speaker B: I don't know. It's a centralized exchange, but that's what it is.
00:40:52.848 - 00:40:52.986, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:53.008 - 00:41:11.886, Speaker B: It's a wallet at the end of the day where you're trading assets. Right? So I think there's definitely use case for that. I think the demographic is one that we need to kind of clearly discern. Right? So I think that's the fat wallet that we see today. It's like overloaded with features and the ability to trade assets, stake, et cetera.
00:41:11.918 - 00:41:12.018, Speaker A: Right?
00:41:12.024 - 00:41:27.286, Speaker B: So all these functionality, all these functionality being provided when it comes to. Yeah, the super app, that's exactly what it is. Right. And I think there's a place for that, whether it's rainbow. And I've seen a few other entrants in the space where they're geographically focused as well.
00:41:27.308 - 00:41:27.446, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:27.468 - 00:42:02.274, Speaker B: So they're trying to create the equivalent. Again, I think the angle is not that this is a centralized exchange, but this is a wallet where you can custody your assets. Right. By the way, again, the other layer of nuance here is that where the custodying is happening. Is it self custodial or is it custody somewhere? Now, when it comes to being sort of the gateway for Dapps, that's where I think as like a browser extension primarily. Right. I think that's a barrier for entry and I feel like the direction will start to go in.
00:42:02.274 - 00:42:47.060, Speaker B: I think thanks to account abstraction and other enhancements happening in the space, is that I think we'll start to see these embedded wallets start to appear and start to become a little bit more popular. And the idea that because again, there's just barriers for entry here for the average user, let's say again, steady state, we have games that are leveraging the blockchain for various different things. I just don't see a world in which we're expecting a user to download a browser extension first and then go through all the steps that we do today just to be able to play the game. Right. So I think at steady state we have these games that have wallets embedded in them. And where I see technology really playing a part is that I think the idea of a wallet doesn't really change, but they're really embedded in nature. Coinbase has released our wallet as a service.
00:42:47.060 - 00:43:25.694, Speaker B: We have such providers out there today. I have a canonical sort of portfolio company called Portal, where it's like NPC wallets as a service. And so I think these are going to start to become more mainstream over the course of time. I think it almost seems inevitable because I think it's beautiful to see that we tested this hypothesis out and it really works as a browser extension that gives you an unlock into this application today and that became like the most interesting application is at that browser extension. Right. But I think slowly we're going to start to see these become more embedded because the applications themselves are more interesting. Right.
00:43:25.694 - 00:43:39.506, Speaker B: So to your point, I think we'll start to move away from browser extensions because honestly, those are kind of scary in many ways for the average user to think about. And hopefully that will also dissipate some of the security exploits and hacks and things like that we've seen over time.
00:43:39.528 - 00:44:13.660, Speaker A: As well, by the way, since we last spoke about roll ups and app specific rollups. In particular several companies, by the way, including optimism, which launched optimism, SDK, arbitrary recently announced orbit, for example. And now you also have some of these higher level abstractions on top of that that people often call them now roll up as a service, products eclipse and bunch of other, by the way, also is also building one of those. What are your thoughts on these, these RAs offerings in particular? So roll up as a service offerings in particular, which are kind of like.
