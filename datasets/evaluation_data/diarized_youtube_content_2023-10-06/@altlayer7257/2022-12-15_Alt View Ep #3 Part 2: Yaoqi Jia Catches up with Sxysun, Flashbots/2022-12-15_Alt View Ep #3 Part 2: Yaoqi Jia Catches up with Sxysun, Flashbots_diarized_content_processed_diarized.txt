00:00:11.690 - 00:00:48.726, Speaker A: With you, I feel like once we have multiple sort of app roll up or dedicated roll ups. Right. The good thing, definitely we can scale the throughput, like sort of at least a linear or proportional to the number of roll ups. Right. Like for example, each row up you can have 1000 sort of tps. But in that case, once you have 100, then you can have 100,000 tps at the same time. But the issue is, when we talk about liquidity, we divide the liquidity into multiple rollouts at the same time, probably within a rollout.
00:00:48.726 - 00:01:14.690, Speaker A: As you mentioned, we can have various mitigation ways against Meb by the same time. I believe it can also create a bunch of these arbitrage or different ways across different roll apps to extract values. Sort of create more difficulty for these bots, or the people want to extract values across different rollabs.
00:01:16.550 - 00:01:35.020, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. On the tvs point, I think it's increasing the number of block space you sell is not a direct mitigation to MEV. It's more like solving the time preference of MEV, I think.
00:01:35.630 - 00:02:24.250, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sort of like just create a little bit more difficulty for you to run the MEV. Because the thing if everything within a single chain, like Ethereum, probably, as you mentioned, all the algorithms on the MEV side, they can be directly applied on these sort of smart contracts. But right now, once you have multiple roll ups, it just create more difficulties for you to cross different roll ups. Yeah. And then the next question would be something like, as you know, in Devconfield announced that there's a plan to build this single unifying auction for value expression. Right? Yeah. At that time, we only know the name and also know some of the descriptions.
00:02:24.250 - 00:02:36.080, Speaker A: And right now, I think it's already some time after the announcement. Right. Can you share a little bit more about it and sort of how it will be helpful to address the MEV issues?
00:02:37.330 - 00:03:19.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I will be mostly talking about the technical side, how we think the problem with current heavy industry lies, and about several ways that you can approach this. So, for example, okay, the thing you mentioned is like shorten m two v suave single unifying auction for value expression, not extraction, but expression expression. Yeah. Okay. So if you think about the problem with current mu solution. So one of the major thing is that it's not expressive enough. Right.
00:03:19.050 - 00:03:45.990, Speaker B: So we know that there is common value, and then moving to an app chain world, we're going to see more common value in existence. Right. However, crypto as a whole, what we really want is to encourage more diverse preferences. What a dull world we will live in. If everybody wants the same thing. Everybody actually wants different things. And we need to encourage diversity not to eliminate it.
00:03:45.990 - 00:05:14.066, Speaker B: Okay, so then there's a funny deadlock scenario here, if you notice enough. So we have common value. And the common value encourages people to not have diverse encourage people to not have expressive mechanisms. Right? So you have a simple mechanism, but then once you have a simple mechanism, then people who want diverse preferences cannot build applications that encourage or express those diverse preferences on top, right? Because even if they express those things cannot be aggregated efficiently because you have a simple mechanism. So then they can only be aggregated or efficiently allocated. If you have an expressive mechanism, and only by having an expressive mechanism, you can encourage more people to actually move from common values to diverse preferences and thus recover what we initially wanted to achieve using crypto, or what we initially wanted to increase our social welfare, which can directly be, and welfare can directly be reflected by everybody gets a better execution, or like, everybody gains less slippage from their trade, right? So this is a net win for everybody. Okay, so one of the paths forward is to build this more expressive mechanism than how to build it.
00:05:14.066 - 00:06:20.130, Speaker B: We know that having more things to say actually creates a significant mental burden to users. It's tiresome enough for me to say, oh, I want to execute this trade. Now, maybe if I can encode more things, maybe I need to say, I want to execute this trade. And this trade has to be executed by some kind of discounter property that satisfy this property x, and the execution satisfies another property x too. So this creates significant band of burden and also favors sophisticated users more. Right? So then we want to eliminate this how we can still do this, by increasing expressiveness. So, for example, we know that if we give them a quantifier, say my execution is the best execution that I can ever get out of all of the possible executions in this block, then I commit to having my transaction being executed.
00:06:20.130 - 00:07:54.050, Speaker B: Okay, so this is kind of a template that is universal, that is generic, right? Everybody can use this. And then once everybody uses this, you can basically eliminate the asymmetry between the unsophisticated users and sophisticated users. So you both prove the fairness point and also increase the efficiency, right? Because you guarantee that whatever fixed point solution or whatever equilibrium you find in this game, it is always going to be providing the best social welfare. Okay, so this is this part. And then concretely, what kind of diverse preferences are there? What kind of molok extreme value are there? So moving to astring world, we know that cross domain, as I argue before, cross domains where all of the monocratic value lives, right? So then for sure one of the major things to solve is cross domain execution. Or cross domain maybe where the solution will be everybody can publish, the users can publish a credible commitment saying that if this prepigate gets satisfied, then I commit to my transaction getting executed. So notice this is similar to the more expressive language we talked about before, right? And then this commitment lives in a cross domain execution world.
00:07:54.050 - 00:08:45.574, Speaker B: So on chain a, I could say that my transaction, well maybe not on chain, maybe both on chain a and chain b. So then I can publish a commitment saying that if both on chain a and chain b, my, I don't know, like arbitrage gets executed, both legs of my arbitrage get executed. Then I will pay this much to whatever searcher on each domain. Then this is an expression. And then I further constrained that both executions that I get on each domain is the best execution that is possible. Right? So you can do something like this. Okay, so these are the expressiveness part and also the cross domain part.
00:08:45.574 - 00:09:52.054, Speaker B: So those things are aimed at eliminating the monarchy, straddle value and improved fairness. So what about mafia? Shadow value? Mafia is basically like agent has informational symmetry. So typically people have been talking about other flow auctions a lot. Even in trader five we see payments for order flow, right? So I buy some retail orders from you, and since I know it's retail, then I know I can give them a tighter slippage. However, I know that it's more noisy trades, so I can trade against those people and generate profit. So this is how Robin Hood or payment for order flow in tradfi works. And then people have been talking about order flow auctions, open order flow auctions, which is I explicitly auction off my order flow to 100 bidders and then I take the highest bid and then that person gets to execute or trade against this piece of order flow.
00:09:52.054 - 00:11:25.890, Speaker B: Okay, so this is how people usually think about those. So we have also thought about this a lot. I think the current conclusion, or like. Yeah, so the current conclusion I have is that the most ideal way to solve this is to calculate each agent's transactions contribution to the satisfaction of another agent's transactions preference, and then have this value be added together, which we call the agent's contribution. And then have this contribution to be an implicit option. So there was this notion in corporate game theory called Shapley value, which basically quantifies how much contribution that your transaction or your supply has to the satisfaction of this whole coalition or like coalitions of agents, preferences, satisfaction, right? So if you think about this, what the user's order is doing is that having my order supply satisfies the demand of another searcher, right? That searcher wants to trade against me and then I satisfied, but then I need to get compensated. So previously I didn't get compensated, now if I get compensated, then it's fine, right? Because I make sure I get strictly more money from any kind of random execution or any other execution.
00:11:25.890 - 00:12:29.930, Speaker B: Okay, so then the way we approach this is to calculate each agent's contribution. We sum all of them together. Then they're saying if we assume there is only automated market makers, for example in app rollab, then this approach is equivalent to doing an explicit order flow auction, but without all of the externalities, right? So you can see like this is a more generic solution, and also we can reuse the same auction for any kind of, well at this point it's less like an auction, but more like a generic mechanism, right, allocation mechanism. So then we can reuse the same mechanism for any kind of roll ups, whatever application it is, and also for the cross domain thing, right? We don't need to devise a specific mechanism for every roll up, which we know that having generality is good, right? Ethereum won because of generality.
00:12:30.290 - 00:12:44.980, Speaker A: Yeah. But at the same time, do you think we need some sort of hardware to help to enforce sort of the encrypted mempool and to help sort of achieve some of the goals, as you mentioned?
00:12:46.550 - 00:13:37.082, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Great question. So encrypting Memphis for sure, something needed at the current stage, at least theoretically, I believe it is possible to not have fall or take privacy and still eliminate me or achieve social welfare. But at the current stage, due to limitations of we can't implement elaborate mechanism, we need some kind of privacy. For example, the simplest thing is that you want faithful execution of the mechanism by the coordinator, right? You don't want the block builder to be able to still sandwich you and not pay you the right amount. You actually want that guy to execute the allocation mechanism that I mentioned before. So then this comes down to verifiability of computation.
00:13:37.082 - 00:14:24.654, Speaker B: So it is not exactly privacy. So we can call this something like programmable privacy, which means fair execution. Yeah, verifiable execution. Right. So we can implement this through things like, I don't know, MPC or SGX. They both work, right? They verify that your execution is faithful or like fully homomorphic encryption, if you are talking about future. So we can see web privacy is needed and the private part is not only for verifiability, but also for there is no exogenous or out of system way that the person can act privilegedly based on it.
00:14:24.654 - 00:14:28.130, Speaker B: Right. Because that is pretty much why I want privacy.
00:14:29.030 - 00:14:51.554, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds great. And at the same time, as you know, I know flashball has been done a lot of this kind of mev sort of mitigation stuff since day one. Right. As a researcher or developer. So what kind of stuff we can help you guys or collaborate on in your opinion?
00:14:51.602 - 00:16:00.240, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. Because we were previously talking about app specific roll ups. So that is something that sits between the infrastructure layer and the application layer. So moving forward, my take is that it is vital for not only for solving mev, not only for creating a sound future of no mafia and no molok, but also for the survival of this whole industry in light of recent developments. We really need good applications that justify the survival of crypto to, say, governments or regulators, because otherwise all the applications people are going to say are going to see is that it's been like, I don't know, ten years of crypto and the only thing you guys have got is artists like Ponzi casinos. And that doesn't look good.
00:16:02.930 - 00:16:05.890, Speaker A: Some follow out of the exchanges.
00:16:06.390 - 00:17:28.890, Speaker B: Yeah, some fallout of the exchanges that doesn't look good. So we need like real applications. So I think that is something we should work on together as a community. So basically think about what kind of application that is specific to the unlock of this more expressive mechanism, right? Because previously, as I argue, if you assume you can only operate in common value settings, then you don't have much mechanism to explore, right? You don't have much application to explore because you are restricted to only being able to aggregate common values. And this is made sure by us previously not having an express mechanism, us only having a very primitive version of the mechanism, aka like block space auction, or even before that, like random ordering or fair ordering, right? So then after the unlock of those mechanisms, people are really able to express those diverse preferences. And I would really love to see applications that utilize those diverse preferences. You can imagine the set of mechanisms you can explore is vastly more, and there's probably arbitrary amount of welfare that you can, or economic efficiency you can gain from those new mechanisms.
00:17:28.890 - 00:17:37.134, Speaker B: Right? That is pretty much why we initially wanted crypto. So it's time to get back to it.
00:17:37.252 - 00:17:55.880, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. And then back to our last question, and I also think that's the most fine question. As you know, we are doing these alternative views. Do you have any new non mainstream advice you want to leave our listeners with? Yeah.
00:17:57.130 - 00:18:16.774, Speaker B: So this one, I don't know if it's certainly not mainstream, but I don't know if it's controversial. My personal take is that scaling is like, we know that the community of crypto has focused extensively on scaling in the past, right?
00:18:16.812 - 00:18:22.670, Speaker A: We justified by five or more years.
00:18:22.740 - 00:19:21.614, Speaker B: Right. So scaling, if you think about it, it's saying that people can operate within this common value scenario, but then I make the division, the allocation of those common value scenarios faster. Right. So if you imagine the set of mechanisms is like 100%, this is the applications that you can build. So the mechanisms that you can do in common value scenario is like 1% and then scaling is saying we solve those 1% better. Okay, so then the contrarian view, or like the non mainstream view is that unlocking the 99% of the pie and researching on how to cut the pie fairly is better than only focusing on 1% of the pie and throwing the 99% of the pie out and cut this 1% of the pie faster. Right.
00:19:21.614 - 00:19:39.510, Speaker B: Because that is like scaling solutions do, right. You cut the pie faster, not even necessarily fairly. Okay. What we should do is first, not through the 99% of the pie out. And then secondly, you research on how to cut the pie fairly.
00:19:40.170 - 00:19:48.860, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great opinion regarding the 99% of the pie. Right. What do you think we can do with 99% of the pie? What's that?
00:19:49.950 - 00:20:35.670, Speaker B: Yeah, that is like the survival bit of our industry in the next few years. That is what we all need to work on. So I've asked a lot of people on this, so I've heard some promising directions. Although for example, why didn't supply chain take off? Why didn't all those international contracts, they are all applications. It's because previously we didn't solve this molok extracted value problem, we didn't solve the extraction aggregation problem. We didn't justify how much value we could provide. And so in future we probably need to see more diverse preferences enabled applications.
00:20:37.370 - 00:21:07.074, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing opinion. For the past few years I sort of first time heard about this kind of painting. It's amazing. Thanks a lot. So basically it's sort of a great time to basically we discuss about the MEV and the various ideas around the MEV. And also great thanks to all our listeners to listen and as you know.
00:21:07.112 - 00:21:07.314, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:07.352 - 00:21:40.640, Speaker A: We really appreciate your time. At the same time, if you really want to know more about the industry, especially the technical part around these sort of layer two scalability and also the crypto industry and just keep posted and we will just have more content for you. And, yeah, we will just sign off until the next time. Yeah. Thanks, everyone. Yeah, thanks a lot for Xinyuan. You.
