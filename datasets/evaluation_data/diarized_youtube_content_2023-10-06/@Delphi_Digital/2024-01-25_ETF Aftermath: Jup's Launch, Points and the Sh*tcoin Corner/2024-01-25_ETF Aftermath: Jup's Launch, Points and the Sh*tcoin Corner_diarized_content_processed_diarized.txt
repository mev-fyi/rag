00:00:00.400 - 00:01:10.214, Speaker A: Nothing said on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hey everyone, my name is Jose Macedou, and welcome to the Hive Mind podcast. The goal of the podcast is to provide an inside look into what we like to call the Delphi Hive mind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights, alpha and shitposts. Today with us we have ceteris from our institutional research arm, who focuses on infra and Defi Jan Lieberman, managing partner of Delphi Ventures and ventures associate Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, prodigious shitcoin scavenger and investor. I lead Delphi Labs, our protocol R and D arm focused on incubating and accelerating new web3 primitives. It's been a hectic two weeks since our last episode where Duncan called the top on air.
00:01:10.214 - 00:01:23.124, Speaker A: Everyone has become ETF experts, so maybe we could start there talking about the flows or whatever. Who wants to kick us off explaining why? Why bad price?
00:01:23.784 - 00:01:32.464, Speaker B: Well, I think, like, I guess people just underestimated like this GBTC selling, because there were.
00:01:32.544 - 00:01:37.016, Speaker C: I didn't know, like, what's the net flows from if you net out GBDC.
00:01:37.080 - 00:01:41.528, Speaker D: And I mean, even 80 million, 800.
00:01:41.576 - 00:01:47.904, Speaker B: Million, it's 824 net, which includes a 4.4 outflow of GBTC.
00:01:48.484 - 00:01:55.704, Speaker C: Yeah. So I don't even know if the underperformance, obviously, GBTC played a big role in it, but like.
00:01:59.404 - 00:02:40.530, Speaker D: Yeah, like 800 million outflows in. In nine days is like negligible, right? So I think it's more. So traders, right. Doug had that posts and just like breaking out, you know, the. Basically the types of people that have exposure GBTC and assessing, you know, who's neutral on a trade and who's naked on a trade. And basically it's the naked guys that would be the net sellers, whereas the neutral guys, when they unwind are selling here and buying somewhere else to close the other leg. And so, yeah, it's basically, you know, the underestimation of the amount of, of unwind of that naked position.
00:02:40.530 - 00:03:20.640, Speaker D: But then it's also which, you know, part of that's driven by FTX, right. They had a decent amount. I think that was probably one of the bigger underestimations in terms of flows. And then the other thing is like, how much of that is just flows back into the ETF's themselves. So it's hard to assess if they're naked or neutral and like, you know, you have a bunch of volume, but it's just like, a lot of it could be people moving in from one product or add one product into the other. And so it's not necessarily an insane amount of net interest, which is probably like, the one interesting kind of element here is like, how much of this is net interest in the ETF's versus how much of it is unwinding of GBTC just going straight back into ETF?
00:03:20.792 - 00:03:25.884, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it's at a minimum, it's at 820 inflow, right?
00:03:26.544 - 00:04:08.612, Speaker C: Yeah. Or just like how all of the funds are, like, looking for people to see them. Like, could just be bitcoin spot selling, moving into these ETF products because they're searching for kind of like, more liquidity to see the funds. Also, I think, like, a big reason for the underperformance. Like, obviously the flows are going to make a big impact over time, but just in the short term, like, everyone was just kind of like, trading and getting long up into the ETF. And then, like, once that event has passed, it's like, anyone who was in, like, a trade is probably going to, like, start unwinding that because there's no, like, kind of clear catalyst to, like, hold to. It's much less, you know, clear cut of a trade.
00:04:08.668 - 00:04:19.740, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, if you have. If you have the GBTC thing, which might even be net mechanically, it's like, that's a good reason to sell if you're like a trader in this instance anyways.
00:04:19.852 - 00:04:40.066, Speaker D: So, yeah, I wonder how much. Cause I know there's the premium really compressed in. I think it was over the summer. I don't remember. But, like, I wonder if there's some element of, you know, optimization for, like, long term gains versus short term, and like, unwinding that position, like, the wait.
00:04:40.090 - 00:04:41.674, Speaker C: Until then, like, came back.
00:04:41.714 - 00:04:49.066, Speaker D: Right? Yeah, I'm, like, tracked when. Just as a proxy for when a lot of people kind of moved in and when volume picked up.
00:04:49.170 - 00:05:04.656, Speaker C: Well, like, the ETF was first announced in June, if I recall correctly, and then the premium in August and. Yeah, so the premium in June was 44%, and I think that's right around where the ETF was launched. And then it jumped quickly up to.
00:05:04.680 - 00:05:07.560, Speaker B: Like, you mean like when grayscale won?
00:05:07.592 - 00:05:38.084, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, the discount was 44% in June, and then it jumped up to, like, 20% by the end of August. So I think that that, like, a lot of people, as soon as that ETF was filed, we're just kind of piling into that trade. It was also really bad on Ethi. But if you think about it, at a 44% discount, it's basically like two x leverage bitcoin with no liquidation. You're just paying like, essentially a 5%, like, funding fee. It's like 2.5% of the nav is the grayscale fee.
00:05:38.084 - 00:05:41.984, Speaker C: So that was a pretty attractive trade at the time.
00:05:43.084 - 00:05:46.984, Speaker B: I think it's interesting that, like, Ethi discount is getting wider again.
00:05:47.404 - 00:06:05.144, Speaker D: I think it's around the sentiment of an ETF going through, where initially everyone kind of assumed it was a shoe in, and then you had big guy come out saying people on the inside were saying less likely, and then sentiments went back and forth. I think it's probably just like the market pricing, the probability.
00:06:05.684 - 00:06:09.412, Speaker A: Who said that? Someone on the inside said it was going to be. It was less likely.
00:06:09.468 - 00:06:19.054, Speaker D: AP that Andrew account tweeted like a source that he was referencing who had a seat at the table. I think it was described that way.
00:06:19.394 - 00:06:25.954, Speaker A: But Blackrock's like 350 to one, right? In terms of their ETF applications or something like that?
00:06:26.074 - 00:06:36.014, Speaker D: Yeah, it's more a matter of when, not if, I think, and I think it's basically the assumption was it would. It was like a shoe in for 2024. And now people are saying maybe it'll take a little longer.
00:06:37.034 - 00:06:41.066, Speaker A: Is that it on ETF's? Is there more stuff to say? I don't know anything about?
00:06:41.210 - 00:06:50.820, Speaker D: So I know we're talking about kind of, you know, this, and then comparing it to what happened with the Coinbase top. I think it's a little bit different.
00:06:50.932 - 00:06:51.180, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:51.212 - 00:07:11.286, Speaker D: In that I think the market was also a lot hotter then. And you also. This is still a very long term benefit. Right. Part of the reason why stocks over time go up is because there's a constant bid via 401 ks into these index funds. And so now you have a similar kind of dynamic with bitcoin. Definitely to a smaller degree at first, but this, there's.
00:07:11.286 - 00:07:25.766, Speaker D: There's certainly potential there. And I think that that's why it's certainly like a short term sell the news, or in hindsight, it was just based on kind of how much people piled in, but I think it's not a one off event, but. But has longer term implications that are definitely bullish.
00:07:25.950 - 00:08:02.386, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I guess, like on, like why I was saying, like, it's just interesting. It's like Coinbase kind of marked the top in 2021 and then 2022. Like the bitcoin futures launch results near the top. It's just like a lot of these events that are just, like, clearly telegraphed and there's a reflexivity to it where people are just piling into the trade all up until the event. And then it's like, there's almost like, when it happens, obviously, the bitcoin spot ETF over time is going to attract a lot of flows, but there's not enough people to continue the momentum. And it's kind of like most of the people in the trade, there's only one thing for them to do.
00:08:02.386 - 00:08:39.474, Speaker C: It's probably like, sell. So, like, yeah, and I think, like, Eric, the guy who covers the ETF's pretty closely, was just saying that, yes, they'll have some, like, spot flows lined up in the beginning and, like, contacting, like, you know, bigger bitcoin holders to help see the ETF's. But, like, the real flows are going to take, like, the real organic flows that are, like, net new money are going to take time to come in as, like, people get as these, like, financial advisors or funds or whatever, just get more comfortable with, with bitcoin or which product to choose and then kind of slowly, slowly come in over time is like a bigger tail.
00:08:39.594 - 00:08:46.746, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, advisors weren't sitting there with, like, their finger on the button waiting for, like eight DTF for all their clients day.
00:08:46.810 - 00:08:47.338, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:47.466 - 00:09:11.648, Speaker B: Like, I was listening to Matt Hogan on a Triffy podcast use the Bitwise ETF, and he was just, you know, it's like a long process. Like, first the advisor might, like, buy a little for themselves, then some clients might ask about it, and then maybe they'll start buying for clients and stuff like that. So it's definitely. Yeah, it's definitely not like a negative.
00:09:11.776 - 00:09:58.404, Speaker C: Long term thing, I guess, like, moving to the ETH ETF since we kind of saw the reaction of the bitcoin one, and it seemed like a bit of a sell. The news, I think we're down around like 16%, maybe 17% from that Thursday when it launched. Do we think that? Because I think a lot of the prevailing narrative before the ETF was approved was like, okay, like, ETH BTC is not performing very well, and then as soon as the bitcoin ETF gets approved, like, people are just going to start piling into ETH. Like, looking forward to the ETH ETF. But given the reaction of bitcoin after the ETF, do you think that, like, changes, you know, like, the market's, like, perception of ETH going into its ETF?
00:09:58.564 - 00:09:59.956, Speaker D: How specifically?
00:10:00.100 - 00:10:05.260, Speaker C: Like, since bitcoin was selling? Yeah, well, maybe, just maybe it just.
00:10:05.292 - 00:10:08.508, Speaker B: Doesn'T run up as hard as like, etc did. Right.
00:10:08.596 - 00:10:29.454, Speaker D: I think once you have some kind of. I think there's just like no realistic timeline. This one was telegraphed both in terms of certainty and timeline. Right. So it just became a very no brainer, pile in, pile out scenario. Whereas at the moment, you know, there is no kind of time element where you need to be acting quickly on the ETH side for the ETF specifically.
00:10:29.534 - 00:10:59.970, Speaker B: Well, I mean, ETH will be may or it won't be this year. So there still is like a time. And so, yeah, I mean, it'd be nice. Not nice, but like if all the ETF's passed but there's no ethy conversion, it'd probably be more bullish because I think ETH's got like, what, 8 billion? So it's not as big as GBTC was. GBTC was like 25 and now it's a 20 or so. But still, like that exact same playbook, if they keep the fee at 1.5%, is going to run back again with Ethi.
00:10:59.970 - 00:11:10.184, Speaker B: Right. So. And that is a way that a lot of institutional investors, instead of buying like ETH spot to get exposure, they're probably just buying like Ethi.
00:11:11.924 - 00:11:35.628, Speaker C: But also the dynamics on Ethi were worse. Like the premium was way higher than GBTC and the discount was also way lower. So it might almost be like an exaggerated effect. Like if GBDC, let's say, unwinds like a third or something. Like Ethi might be even more. Just because those dynamics that cause people to get stuck in the trade were actually like more severe.
00:11:35.716 - 00:11:42.988, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember when Ethy launched and he was trading at like eleven to twelve x, the price of ETH. Yeah, it was so bad.
00:11:43.036 - 00:11:49.972, Speaker C: What's the Solana one trading at? Because I remember when Sol went on some silly, like 800% premium that was.
00:11:49.988 - 00:11:52.428, Speaker D: On like negligible TVL right?
00:11:52.556 - 00:11:54.516, Speaker C: Yeah, but it was still.
00:11:54.700 - 00:11:58.288, Speaker B: It was trading at like over 100 when Seoul was in like the twenties.
00:11:58.436 - 00:11:59.564, Speaker C: G soul.
00:12:00.584 - 00:12:17.404, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's the ironic thing about like these ETF's and like having these products is that again, this whole GBT unwind is just another thing that's happening because of like no ETF and just bad products getting forced onto the market.
00:12:17.824 - 00:12:39.934, Speaker C: Yeah, the g sole is literally holdings per share is $30 worth of soul and the market price per share is $130. Yeah, it's treating like a forex for you. That's insane. That honestly was. Could have been an interesting trade. Like, if you're a bullish soul. And like, you just see how these things react when.
00:12:39.934 - 00:12:46.614, Speaker C: When stuff rips. Like just instead of buying the underlying soul, just buying the g sole for the premium.
00:12:47.554 - 00:12:49.534, Speaker D: What's the, like, the nav on it?
00:12:50.834 - 00:12:52.754, Speaker C: Yeah, 21 million. It's not that much.
00:12:52.794 - 00:12:55.854, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, like, yeah, it doesn't matter. It's nothing.
00:12:56.234 - 00:12:57.266, Speaker C: It's still crazy.
00:12:57.290 - 00:13:00.226, Speaker D: The premium though, someone who doesn't know better.
00:13:00.370 - 00:13:06.570, Speaker B: I think people aren't going to do those grayscale trades anymore. So I don't know if that premium is going to come down.
00:13:06.602 - 00:13:08.074, Speaker C: Any lesson.
00:13:08.194 - 00:13:12.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think funds are looking to do that one again. Run that back.
00:13:12.834 - 00:13:52.956, Speaker C: The other long term bullish part about the ETF other than the flows is now it becomes just more useful. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to margin it if it's a liquid ETF versus before. I think there's a lot of stuff you couldn't do with grayscale since it was traded like GBTC since it was traded. So that could open up just making bitcoin as a more attractive asset to hold because before you literally can do anything with it or you went to those lending desks that all got crunched in June of last year, having it be marginal and like your brokerage account is actually, I think, a pretty big.
00:13:53.100 - 00:14:05.744, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, there's already. They're going to get options in like April or something, I think. So it'll also be the most liquid way to buy options over any like option exchange. Right?
00:14:06.084 - 00:14:06.460, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:06.492 - 00:14:12.276, Speaker B: So. And like, there's already a. Someone already applied for like covered call ETF too.
00:14:12.340 - 00:14:12.540, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:12.572 - 00:14:14.220, Speaker C: It's going to be a bunch of products like that.
00:14:14.292 - 00:14:22.524, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to have, we're going to have 100 flavors of BTC ETF's before the ETH one comes. Like 100 bitcoin strategy ETF's.
00:14:23.104 - 00:14:33.256, Speaker C: And because that's what happens, get some cheap calls. You just need a scenario where like bitcoin is just going down or sideways balls compressed a lot. These ETF's are just selling calls.
00:14:33.320 - 00:14:33.600, Speaker D: Well, yeah.
00:14:33.632 - 00:14:47.136, Speaker B: Do you think that this is actually like. It's a good point. Like with, with options coming live, like, do you think where like institutions can, can trade volatility in size? Like, do you think this actually changes, like the volume regime for bitcoin moving forward?
00:14:47.200 - 00:14:51.312, Speaker D: For sure, if those things pile in, Nav. Yeah, I think it compresses.
00:14:51.488 - 00:15:22.568, Speaker C: Yeah. It's all dampening over time. But like, I. There's some interesting dynamics, like in 2018 when bitcoin is at like 3000. And like all these miners are going bust like on Darabit. Like all these bitcoin miners are just like selling calls to stay afloat at like 5000, 6000 type thing. When bitcoin was at 3000 and they were making calls like so insanely cheap because they were just like trying to harvest extra yield and then bitcoin rocketed from like 3000 to 14,000 in like, you know, four or five months.
00:15:22.568 - 00:15:36.740, Speaker C: So there's like some interesting dynamics that since this asset can, can move so quickly that you could probably get some scenarios where, like some more interesting scenarios like that.
00:15:36.812 - 00:16:43.108, Speaker B: Do you think that like the whole institutionalization of this asset class is something we're not like totally, like Larry Fink went on CNBC and said that crypto solves money laundering, right? And because he's highlighting, you know, how it's like all publicly traceable and all this stuff. But at the same time, this makes like the privacy fight and moving away from purely public kind of like dystopian type blockchains, it makes it harder to fight this because now the institutions with big money are like pushing this fully public, fully transparent, fully open narrative. Right. So it's like good and bad. It's good because you have someone like Larry Fink saying the exact opposite of the Elizabeth Warren type rhetoric that a lot of people hear and think, you know, the money laundering and, you know, terrorist groups, all this stuff. But I think it will make the privacy side like a bit more challenging.
00:16:43.236 - 00:16:46.932, Speaker D: I think a meaningful amount of privacy was probably a pipe dream.
00:16:47.068 - 00:16:51.924, Speaker B: Yeah, but you still need, you have, you can't, you can't have businesses on chain without privacy.
00:16:52.084 - 00:16:59.082, Speaker D: Like it doesn't, I mean, like you can have some elements, but it's still like control privacy. Right. For a business to some extent. I mean, like, you know, to the.
00:16:59.098 - 00:17:21.774, Speaker B: Extent that regulators will always, if regulator, everyone wants to see like a businesses, but like obviously they have to show all that. So I mean, privacy pools are an interesting concept that in theory, like they should be, they should work. But like the problem is there's never been any guidance on like what is acceptable for privacy and what's not.
00:17:22.074 - 00:17:41.914, Speaker D: If you see a bit of a red wave in the US, I think there's a better chance of it happening right there. They're anti CBDC, which is good for privacy. And so a lot of that stuff, I think we'll see the extent to the, to how far the privacy component can go. But yeah, I don't know if it's going to go that far.
00:17:42.494 - 00:17:49.354, Speaker A: So bullish BTC. Bullish ETH. Bullish ETH BTC. What are you guys. What are you guys thinking?
00:17:49.794 - 00:18:10.490, Speaker B: I'm, like, pretty indifferent on ETH BTC. And to be honest, it's like a ratio that I don't really care about too much. I feel like it's over analyzed. I feel like it's just going to oscillate, like, between good for trading. Yeah, yeah. I don't think ETH will flip BTC. So it's like, there's a limit to, like, what? I think the ratio will go.
00:18:10.490 - 00:18:12.574, Speaker B: So I don't really, like, think about it too much.
00:18:12.954 - 00:18:13.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:13.258 - 00:18:22.644, Speaker D: It's funny to see the opinion on flipping BTC kind of go back and forth. There were periods where it was shoe in then. Now it's. It's less of a thing.
00:18:23.024 - 00:18:23.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:24.304 - 00:18:27.604, Speaker C: What about Solana? Very closely.
00:18:28.184 - 00:18:30.284, Speaker B: Solana will never flip BTC.
00:18:30.984 - 00:18:52.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I'm. Yeah, sorry. If you want to go. Yeah, I think, like, q one, I'm still a little bit, like, cautious just because of some macro stuff. I don't know if we want to get into that. But, yeah, I'd say still kind of cautious in Q one ETH BTC, I don't have a strong take on. I do think Seoul will probably outperform.
00:18:52.866 - 00:19:09.134, Speaker C: So it'd be really nice. Maybe I want to buy Seoul. If it comes down to, like 60 or 70. I think it's at like 85 right now. That would be nice to get in. But other than that, yeah, I'm kind of cautious in Q one, for sure.
00:19:09.494 - 00:19:11.558, Speaker A: You want to go into the macro stuff or like.
00:19:11.646 - 00:20:01.046, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. But there's probably better people to listen to this on. But basically, like, the one event that's actually, like, coming up soon that could be interesting to look into. So they just stopped the BTFP, which was that, like, emergency facility that was announced after SVB went under to kind of help the banks. So that is expiring, I think on March 11, they're not making any new loans. That's neck going to put some more pressure on the banking system that came out last night. And then there's the US is going to choose, like, how they're going to finance themselves for the next quarter coming up, I think on January 30 and November 1, which is when everything started ripping the stock market.
00:20:01.046 - 00:21:02.316, Speaker C: Bitcoin, like tech stocks, bonds, was largely caused because Yellen shifted the US debt issuance to the short end of the curve, which was helpful for liquidity. So there's a new decision on that coming up. On January 30. So if she shifts issuance back out to the longer end of the curve, it could make longer term yields rise, which more pressure on banks could go into. Some pressure in Q one. And I think people are thinking that that's a possibility because you kind of create some disruption in Q one where maybe the Fed stops QT or gives them cover to kind of cut rates, and then Yellen can kind of build up a bit more of a piggy bank going into the election and then just kind of, like, rip everything into the election to try and help the Democrats out. So there's, like, better people to listen to on, but just some, like, high level points, if you're interested.
00:21:02.380 - 00:21:05.464, Speaker B: Were they still giving out a ton of new loans under that program?
00:21:06.364 - 00:21:08.924, Speaker C: I think they're going to stop giving loans on March 11.
00:21:08.964 - 00:21:11.852, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But, like, have they even been giving out a ton still?
00:21:11.948 - 00:21:52.294, Speaker C: Yeah, there's. There's still been some pretty significant growth, I think, in the past, like, few months because all the banks in the US are, like, backwards in terms of. They're like, they made all these loans, these long term loans, when, like, rates were near zero, and then, like, short term rates come up, and it's like, why would I hold my money in a checking account that's earning, like, ten bits versus going and buying a t bill that earns 5%? So, like, you have, like, you know, depositors wanting to leave, and they can't really make money off of the spread because everything's inverse of what it was a few years ago when they made out this whole loan book.
00:21:52.794 - 00:21:58.734, Speaker A: Anyone want to comment on that? Or we go back to crypto, maybe touch on the Jupiter launch.
00:21:59.674 - 00:22:00.034, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:00.074 - 00:22:01.674, Speaker A: Ceteris, maybe you can take it.
00:22:01.794 - 00:22:42.034, Speaker B: Well, I know Duncan, as the. Duncan talked about this on the last episode of anytime you get one of these new token launches and ecosystem, you're just increasing the paper wealth but creating this new token. But you're not necessarily, like, increasing the actual amount of capital in the ecosystem. So I think, yeah, it'll be pretty important. Like, this Jupiter one is definitely the most hyped airdrop as far back as I can remember. There's also, like, a lot of, you know, a lot of funds have, like, even still. A lot of funds have, like, zero soul exposure, I think.
00:22:42.034 - 00:23:21.284, Speaker B: And so you got to think about, like, I think Jupiter is going to have, like, 20% of their supply day one with 10% of the airdrop. And so, yeah, like, what does it do? Obviously, the meme coins have run, like, a ton. So, like, what does this launch due to the meme coins? What does it do to, like, Sol? Yeah, I think it'll be kind of interesting to, like, watch how this plays out, because right now with salon, it's basically their soul. There's Jitto, which is like the beta thing. People are trading, and then there's just a ton of meme coins. Right. I also think Jupiter is.
00:23:21.284 - 00:23:45.856, Speaker B: I've been reading the last couple of days, they're going to try and do, like, you know, if you hold Jup and you're in the dow, all these launchpad things they're doing, like, you get allocations and everything, so there's not going to be any, like, revenue for this token for at least two years, is what they've said. But I think they're going to try and, like, gamify it somewhat, soils down.
00:23:45.880 - 00:24:30.050, Speaker D: To the flow stuff. Right. If you have, I assume Jupe is probably more palatable for, quote, unquote, institutional investor side. So if, you know, they come in at that value, basically passing liquidity on to the meme coin guys that are getting airdrops, which are then going to pump it back into meme coins. Whereas I don't think the appetite is there to that extent for those guys to be buying meme coins, those guys being the institutions. And so if you have that flow committed, it can definitely be bullish, I think. Yeah, part of the reason why the meme coins are pumping so much is because there aren't a lot of other tokens.
00:24:30.050 - 00:24:51.632, Speaker D: Same reason Jitto has been doing well. And, and when you kind of price it on a judo market cap to sole market cap is much higher than kind of lido market cap to ETH market cap. And I think it's part of that is just because there's not too many other alts for people to pile into in that ecosystem, which is also like, yeah, the reason why meme coins definitely do well along with, like, the fees in the Ux.
00:24:51.688 - 00:25:08.244, Speaker B: But, yeah, it'll be interesting if, like, you know, like, Coinbase and Binance and. Yeah, I say it like that. Um, have the, uh, liquidity on, have, like, the listings on, like, day one, because that's kind of like the main way how you actually get net new liquidity.
00:25:08.544 - 00:25:37.542, Speaker C: I definitely think that that would be really helpful. Like, if they have the listings, then there's a scenario where people are sending, like, their dupe to binance and then selling to people on binance, which, like, injects kind of like, new cash into the Solana ecosystem. But if you just look at Sol, like, outside of the l one s, I think it has, like $2 billion with the stables on it. Jupiter is trading at $0.50 on Avia, which isn't a super liquid market. But, like, it was trading at $0.70 when it first came out.
00:25:37.542 - 00:25:46.470, Speaker C: Like, people are really anchoring to that price. $0.70 would be a $7 billion FTV. Like, $0.50 is a $5 billion.
00:25:46.542 - 00:25:52.070, Speaker D: What kind of volume is it doing right now? Like, it's actually ridiculous. Oh, okay.
00:25:52.102 - 00:25:58.274, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, I think it's number two. I think it's been number two a lot of days. I think it's done more than uniswap some days, too.
00:25:59.054 - 00:26:06.614, Speaker D: Not Jupiter. Sorry. No, more. So the derivative that's trading Jupiter price, like, is this price actually, it's like.
00:26:06.654 - 00:26:08.350, Speaker B: Six figures of volume a day.
00:26:08.462 - 00:26:08.790, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:08.822 - 00:26:10.310, Speaker D: So that means absolutely nothing.
00:26:10.422 - 00:26:31.260, Speaker C: I know, but no, it does because people are anchoring their perception to it. Like, it's very. Well, I think that obviously it's going to bring up, like, if it's trading at a dollar on the pre market, that's going to. Even if that's a ridiculous valuation, it, like, like, anchors people's price, like, much higher. Like, if it launches.
00:26:31.372 - 00:26:38.012, Speaker D: I'm not doubting that for sure. I just think it's basically, like, the differences, the degree to which people anchor it versus.
00:26:38.188 - 00:26:44.508, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, I think on those markets, cheetah was trading. I think it started trading at like $0.20 or something, and then it went.
00:26:44.596 - 00:26:48.564, Speaker A: Market will end up being like, just like marketing spend for projects.
00:26:48.684 - 00:27:02.764, Speaker B: Yeah. Because then it went to, Kiji was trading at like $0.20, then it went to, like, a dollar. And a lot of people like, okay, this is an illiquid market. A dollar that's so high. And the first went to like 450 or something when real money came in. Right.
00:27:02.764 - 00:27:17.990, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's. They have, I think those pre markets are kind of cool. They're doing this for a lot of these. They also have one, like, for dimension and stuff. Right. But, yeah, the volume is just so low. It's hard to take too much besides just like the mental price anchoring type thing.
00:27:18.182 - 00:27:32.214, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I definitely agree that there's, there's an element of that. Yeah, it's just kind of, there's, you know, with each launch, I think it's less likely for it to drive to an outsized valve unless, like, there's more money coming in than.
00:27:32.294 - 00:28:29.254, Speaker C: Yeah, unless, like, maybe those markets have become more liquid over time, but I got $0.50 just for kind of, like, sake of talking it through its $5 billion fdv going to launch with like a billion dollars worth of circulating supply, which if people are, like, selling that, that's a lot of stable flows that are required on the margin to support that valuation. I feel like it probably just kind of sucks to marrow out of the Solana ecosystem. If it launches lower, then it's less relevant or if it launches in parity with, like an l one. But I think a lot of people are looking at it and be like, okay, Jupiter is launching at 5 billion. This is going to reprice every single Dex in Solana, like every single coin on Solana, because this is such a big valve. But I think in reality, if the market conditions are kind of, as they are now, where it's kind of like chop or down, probably going to be like, net a liquidity stock.
00:28:29.254 - 00:28:41.644, Speaker C: Like, even if you look at, like, Solana is like 40 billion to Jupiter at 5 billion versus, like, you know, uniswap. I don't know, maybe it's like 5 billion. Yeah, 5 billion versus.
00:28:42.184 - 00:28:42.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:43.464 - 00:28:50.884, Speaker D: But it's 4 billion market cap. Right. So you do have a lot more of. It's a lot harder to support that and move that price.
00:28:51.264 - 00:29:51.268, Speaker C: Yeah, no, for sure. Anyway, it'll be interesting to see what happens. I'm leaning that it'll probably be bearish, the eco plays. And also, like we saw with arbitrum, like, Jan and I like going into the harbichrome launch, like, excited for, like, this GMX bid to come because they're like, oh, my God, like, this can be like a billion dollars of new money in the ecosystem. But really what ended up happening was, like, GMX, like, sold off 20% as soon as arbitrum launched because people were selling GMX to buy ARb, which was like, kind of just demonstrated that it was just money within arbitrum flowing around in a circle rather than like, this new wealth coming in. Obviously, like ceteris was saying, if it gets launched on an l one and then you have, like, new money outside of the eco coming in, buying it from, you know, Solana ecosystem people, and then they re inject that in, it could be good. But given there's only $2 billion worth of soul or, sorry, $2 billion worth of stable coins on Solana, I think it could be more of a drain.
00:29:51.316 - 00:30:15.954, Speaker B: Than you probably need, like, you probably need, like, what, 2250 of, like, new capital come in just to keep everything flat? If Jupiter launches at like five bill fleet diluted. Because circulating would be like one something. And then you have like the multiplier. Right. To keep like paper wealth flat. Not like, yeah, yeah, decent amount of capital. But I mean, it's possible.
00:30:16.454 - 00:30:25.564, Speaker D: Yeah, it really boils down to. And I'm assuming they will get it like the centralized listing. Like, it's very easy to get that much liquidity on the. Across a couple of sexes.
00:30:25.984 - 00:30:35.400, Speaker C: Has there been any good research on like that multiplier effect of like new money into ecosystems, like how much that affects, you know, all prices or kind of paper prices?
00:30:35.512 - 00:30:53.968, Speaker D: They've tried to do it on bitcoin way back when, like. Yeah, money into bitcoin. And what the impact is on market cap. I forget, like, it's. It's really hard to do, but I forget what it was. It was like there's a big range on it where. To the point where it was hard to really get too much signal from it.
00:30:54.056 - 00:31:06.528, Speaker B: I think there's like even more depth studies just done on stuff like spy because it still has similar dynamic. Those would probably be like the most accurate. But that's like the most liquid product in the world.
00:31:06.696 - 00:31:12.704, Speaker C: Yeah. I'd be interested just to understand, like ballpark how much. And I also think it depends on the market condition.
00:31:12.744 - 00:31:12.872, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:12.888 - 00:31:37.280, Speaker C: Because it's all about like marginal buyers and sellers. If like the market's ripping, there's a very few marginal sellers, then, like, you kind of get a reflexive dynamic of like, just even like, more money coming in makes a bigger impact than it would if there's more sellers. So it probably depends on like, the regime of market you're in as well. But it would be interesting to kind of have a ballpark figure on that.
00:31:37.392 - 00:31:45.576, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, with like an ammo, you can actually do the exact math. Right. And so then it just depends, like how concentrated or.
00:31:45.720 - 00:31:58.888, Speaker D: No, yeah, but, like, the second there's. That's only in a vacuum, but, yeah, yeah, but what was. What was sell price when Jito launched? Just in terms of, you know, I.
00:31:58.896 - 00:32:00.952, Speaker B: Think it was in the market situations.
00:32:01.128 - 00:32:06.680, Speaker C: I think it was moving from 60, like it was during the move from like 60 to 120. Like during that.
00:32:06.832 - 00:32:10.644, Speaker B: Yeah, but it was like. I'm pretty sure it was like 60 or 70. It wasn't.
00:32:11.244 - 00:32:14.868, Speaker D: Yeah, I think probably the trend is more important than the price in that scenario.
00:32:14.996 - 00:32:41.376, Speaker C: Yeah, it was like during that next massive leg up, which I feel like is what let Jito get, like, when I was looking at Cheeto at like four and a half, what's it trading at now under two. Yeah. Like when I was looking at it at four and a half, I was like, oh my God, like 4.5 billion fpv is pretty heavy. It's like 10% of souls market cap. It was like, yeah, this is gonna come down. But yeah, I think a lot of it is to do with the trend, John as well.
00:32:41.376 - 00:32:58.112, Speaker C: Like if this, if Solana started going on another run and then Jupiter even launched at like $0.50 or higher, I think it would be completely different because that's just like the mindset of like, okay, people get an airdrop, it's like more paper wealth. It's like, okay, I'm just richer. Like I'm buying more opposed to when things are going down, they get an airdrop, they like sell, sell.
00:32:58.208 - 00:33:01.440, Speaker B: Like there's a lot of airdrops coming these days.
00:33:01.552 - 00:33:09.112, Speaker A: So, yeah, points, there's a lot of people going, uh, losing their minds on uh, on Twitter about points.
00:33:09.288 - 00:33:11.284, Speaker C: I don't really get the big deal.
00:33:11.744 - 00:33:13.264, Speaker D: The hate doesn't make any sense.
00:33:13.344 - 00:33:25.616, Speaker B: Saw a good tweet today. It was just points or, lt's for tokens. It's like pretty much what it is. You always just, what do you mean you don't get it? Points are like token, l two ish.
00:33:25.680 - 00:33:27.152, Speaker A: I still don't, I still don't get it.
00:33:27.208 - 00:33:36.620, Speaker B: They're basically, okay. It's a more scalable way to give people incentives because you just keep it on centralized server before actually putting it on chain.
00:33:36.792 - 00:33:38.644, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:38.684 - 00:34:23.806, Speaker D: I mean, I think the, if you're anti points, you're anti tokens, basically it's the same, you know, like that. It's just a more accurate and calculated way to distribute tokens. I think particularly what's good is, you know, with tokens you have kind of a consistent drip. And so, you know, you have, there's the idea of as you get them, you want to sell them. And so I think at that you potentially take away the effectiveness of the token because it dampens the price because, you know, there's going to be this kind of consistent drip and you often can't be as accurate. Whereas with tokens, I mean with points, you usually do them in waves, right? So you have like tokens, first wave happens, token gets priced. Now you're doing wave of second points.
00:34:23.806 - 00:34:53.926, Speaker D: But there's no, not necessarily new issuance coming out for a while. And so the points are used as a carrot to incentivize behavior. But their value is one. It's somewhat real because you have a liquid proxy for what you might get and that the price holds up pretty well because you're not having this kind of constant drip of tokens. I think it's, yeah, it's like better for price. And I think you can be much more kind of calculated and effective with your, with your behavior incentivization.
00:34:54.070 - 00:35:53.488, Speaker C: Yeah, it's probably better for protocols because I think like one of the biggest reason, like just the transparency aspect of it is huge to incentivize behavior versus with airdrops. Like, I feel like a reason airdrops like farming is still, can be still so profitable is because like people really don't give anything weight until like they hear it's coming and then it just gets like kind of, and like even then you don't know what the criteria is. So it's like, the point is very clear. It's like, okay, like you are earning progress towards an airdrop which probably incentivize more users to capital, like, come on and use your platform versus people doing like all this work and not knowing what the criteria is to like, you know, potentially farm the airdrop. So I think airdrop farming, as the points becomes bigger, it's going to become like less lucrative just because there's going to be more eyes on the airdrop. And then the protocol can also incentivize like very specific behavior. But yeah, it's like nothing crazy.
00:35:53.488 - 00:35:56.440, Speaker C: Yeah, it's nothing mechanism for the airdrop.
00:35:56.512 - 00:36:06.034, Speaker B: It's not dangerous or anything. I agree that getting rid of the drip is probably a net benefit to protocols. So.
00:36:07.454 - 00:36:30.734, Speaker D: Yeah, and you can like delay points. Like drip is very permanent and there's so much sentiment around it anytime you change it, whereas points, you can, you can, you know, if you, especially if you do it in stages, you can delay these further stages out and you have a lot more flexibility. Whereas with the token stuff, once it's out, it's really hard to adjust without some level of like unreasonable backlash.
00:36:31.154 - 00:36:32.130, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:36:32.322 - 00:36:47.734, Speaker A: Well, we've been gone for a while. Do you guys want to talk about individual, individual tokens? Have a bit of a shit coin corner or what do you think? Give people some alpha in these, these dark times? Well, that would call the top.
00:36:50.854 - 00:37:22.434, Speaker B: One thing. It's not like token related, but just a trend recently is like both lira and Evo or these like options, perks. L two s both switched their DA from Ethereum to Celestia over the past week. So I think this is like there's something pretty important to keep tracking to see, like how many protocols start to do this thing where they, they stop, like paying Ethereum and go pay like a 20th or less of, you know.
00:37:22.474 - 00:37:24.254, Speaker A: Unwinding of the ETH alignment.
00:37:24.954 - 00:37:29.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's like this whole thing where you got the bridge and then you just post EA somewhere else.
00:37:29.930 - 00:37:36.426, Speaker C: And does that make Celestia's $15 billion valuation make sense now, Cedric?
00:37:36.610 - 00:37:41.454, Speaker B: No, but I think people. I think. Yeah, I don't know.
00:37:42.774 - 00:37:45.718, Speaker A: I think the DA being a commodity thing is pretty mid, though.
00:37:45.846 - 00:37:46.714, Speaker C: Honestly.
00:37:50.454 - 00:38:21.282, Speaker A: If you believe in the roll up centric world, DA is the only. It's the only thing that rollups really all have to use. You don't need a settlement layer and settlements not really real anyway. You just need DA. And there are network effects to Da and data availability sampling and stuff. And there's brand effects. Like, it's also the nowadays, announcing that you're using celestial four DA is like a branding opportunity, right? Announce it on Twitter and people get excited.
00:38:21.378 - 00:38:22.066, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:38:22.170 - 00:38:27.234, Speaker A: I think it's basically. You're not defending. Yeah, go ahead.
00:38:27.354 - 00:39:06.484, Speaker B: No, it's like, you need to believe that the benefits you get from, like, that availability sampling and, like, the bridging outweighs the cost reduction that you could maybe get somewhere else. But I mean, Celestia is going to, like, every time Celestia kind of, like, hits its capacity, it's going to increase full node and, like, validated requirements. Right. And so, yeah, I don't know. Right now there's only Celestia da, right? Like, Eigenva isn't live yet and there's a bunch more coming, too. So it really depends. They're all going to be, like, super cheap for a while because they're way oversupplied.
00:39:06.484 - 00:39:29.984, Speaker B: But nobody, unless you're using Ethel one, like, nobody should be paying high fees for, like, anything now moving forward because there are just so many da layers out there, obviously. Like, there's going to be some of these Ethereum roll ups that just stay on Ethereum and, like, 4844 will help a bit.
00:39:30.104 - 00:40:05.920, Speaker C: But, yeah, broader question, when do we think, like, fundamentals will, like, how many years from now will, like, fundamentals start to, like, matter more? They still, like, even when you say this, it's real. Oh, like, we're going to launch with Tia. It's like, is Tia's price is ripping? Like, you know, that's like, good pr and, like, maybe our price will go up. Like, so much of the market is still almost completely dominated by narratives. I just, like, wonder how, like, when does that start to shift like, slightly more fundamental base, because it's honestly, like, crazy. Yeah, I think it's narrative.
00:40:05.992 - 00:40:28.264, Speaker D: You have, like, two things. One is, like, generally in bear markets, it matters more, and then in its narrative. So I think you have that element that causes to kind of oscillate, but I think it'll gradually matter more when it's not like this tam you're building for, but some of it's already here.
00:40:29.004 - 00:40:33.244, Speaker C: And, yeah, there's more users than fundamentals will matter more.
00:40:33.284 - 00:40:42.716, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, think about it this way, Kate. Let's say in two, three years, Celestia has, like, hundred roll ups. And I mean, I really agree with this thesis of, like, millions of roll ups, but let's say you can have.
00:40:42.740 - 00:40:44.660, Speaker A: Way more than 100 in two, three years.
00:40:44.692 - 00:41:07.574, Speaker B: But, okay, but let's say there's, like, more than 100. Okay, a lot of users, and annualized, it's doing, like, 510 mil of fee revenue. And that's it. Right. That's why. That's when people are going to start to be like, okay, this thing has a lot of users. It's very saturated, and this is the kind of revenue.
00:41:07.614 - 00:41:07.790, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:07.822 - 00:41:33.494, Speaker B: So I think what recently is explaining a lot of this is, first of all, modular money meme is like, a good meme. People like, people like getting all these airdrops. And there's also, you know, just because Celestia is only focused on DA right now, I don't really personally believe that that's what it'll be like forever. I do think that they will launch some, like, Celestia aligned. I guess you want to call, like, roll up that uses TF for everything.
00:41:34.674 - 00:41:37.746, Speaker A: They kind of have that. Yeah, it was aspiring.
00:41:37.770 - 00:41:49.016, Speaker D: I think there's also part of. It's also, like, it, you know, it is antithetical to my bags, but I think it's a different world. Pre and post VC unlocks for some of this stuff too.
00:41:49.200 - 00:42:13.844, Speaker C: 100%. Like, there's going to have to be air that comes out of, like, I think the big ones are, like, arbitram optimism. Celestia, like, the three biggest ones with just, like, you know, 10 billion plus in, like, unlocks to come, which is, like, a lot of money that's going to need to come in to support the valuations if they're going to continue to do well or even go up. Or continue to go up.
00:42:14.574 - 00:42:18.714, Speaker A: So Yan saying the quiet part out loud. Luckily, no one watches this yet.
00:42:19.254 - 00:42:20.194, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:42:20.694 - 00:42:39.314, Speaker C: Well, literally, just like, if you go to Coingecko and then sort in the top 100 by, like, largest FTV and then just like, look at some of these projects. Like, they're circulating versus FTV. It's insane. Arbitrage, 2 billion. FTV is 17 billion. T is two and a half billion. FTV is 15 billion.
00:42:39.314 - 00:42:45.818, Speaker C: Like, optimum optimism is two and a half billion. FTV is 12 billion. Yeah.
00:42:45.866 - 00:42:55.694, Speaker D: Distribution of, like, the top 150 where, you know, you can have a market cap number, but mostly just as a percentage of circulating supply versus FDV is, I think, going to be pretty telling.
00:42:56.114 - 00:42:57.306, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:57.330 - 00:43:02.922, Speaker A: But the ftbs are also very different. Like, some of these ftbs matter way more than others.
00:43:02.978 - 00:43:03.330, Speaker C: That's.
00:43:03.402 - 00:43:10.248, Speaker A: Yeah, like, some people treasury, some of. Some are super heavy, so some of them, it's like everything is investors.
00:43:10.296 - 00:43:10.456, Speaker D: Right?
00:43:10.480 - 00:43:17.480, Speaker A: They did, like, a bunch of rounds, like, really early. Others, it's like, there's a bunch of it sitting. Sitting in the treasury, and it's like a totally different thing, I think. It's hard to.
00:43:17.632 - 00:43:34.354, Speaker B: There's a lot of nuance to FTV, and you kind of need to make, like, an npv of FTV. And, you know, they all have different, like, unlock schedules, to your point, sometimes, like 50% is this community treasury thing.
00:43:34.434 - 00:43:34.986, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:35.130 - 00:44:36.890, Speaker B: And, yeah, that is like, the majority of that will probably sit there forever. Okay. Like, the Solana I know the Solana foundation has a massive treasury, and mostly what they're doing is just delegating it to validators. And there's going to come a point when, like, they just have this massive treasury, it's like, do we do anything with it? Like, do we burn it? Which I don't think they would ever do that, but there's a lot of projects that kind of have this sort of thing. I remember when, like, mango markets did their ido a few years ago and they sold 5% of supply and then team had 5%, and then they just had 90% of it was just un issued tokens that would be, like, owned by the DAO. And so they had this massive FTV, but those tokens never got, like, used for anything because, like, the DaO would never just choose to, like, dilute themselves and issue a ton of tokens, right. And they even burned half of them at one point, and nothing changed.
00:44:36.890 - 00:44:42.506, Speaker B: Like, the price didn't change at all when they burned, like, on paper, like a billion dollars or something. Right.
00:44:42.650 - 00:45:14.610, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's definitely levels. Like, the treasury is just basically there if you need it. Because, like, with stocks and stuff, like, you can issue new shares, but, like, once you have. If it's hard coded and you can't have more tokens, then you kind of just cut off your arm. If there is an opportunity that needed a large charger in the future. But the market perception of it right now is just, people look at that and they kind of get scared. It just requires a higher level of diligence to get comfortable with a massive fDv.
00:45:14.610 - 00:45:20.534, Speaker C: And obviously, like Jose was saying, from project to project, it's a very different split. So you need to go into it more.
00:45:20.884 - 00:45:37.492, Speaker A: There's probably some kind of metric you could use. Just like, you know, how much. Yeah, how much sitting in treasury and then like some kind of cost basis basically, of your, of the rest of it, you know, like how many rounds you did. What, like how much, how much everyone's up would be super useful to do.
00:45:37.508 - 00:45:40.504, Speaker D: And like, a lot of this stuff's so unrealized gains.
00:45:41.124 - 00:46:08.094, Speaker A: Yeah, some of them, yeah, some of them actually fundraise pretty, pretty well. Like the time that in the bull. Others have been, have been going for way longer and have like, way, way higher, like unrealized gains. But, um, like, let's do a shitcoin corner because I'm also going on the, on the banter thing and I need some shit coins to talk about. So let's, let's do a shit going corner. Who wants to start?
00:46:08.254 - 00:46:29.202, Speaker D: Meme coin that's just good for the, uh, for the next year is Trump. It's just a good way to play Trump beta. They got a good launch. Yeah, he seems like a pretty good, pretty good shoe in at this point. Obviously, a lot can change, but it's.
00:46:29.218 - 00:46:34.978, Speaker A: A shoe in you, not financial advice, but this one is a shoe in.
00:46:35.106 - 00:46:35.814, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:37.754 - 00:47:06.078, Speaker D: It'S a couple of things. It's a combination, right? So like, he's most likely going to be the republican candidate and then somehow Biden wins. But that just means you don't know that part for a while. So I think you're going to get a lot of just bullish momentum on him for the coming months as he kind of goes to the republican primary. And it just makes sense for there to be a meme coin here. And this is the one that's in the lead. They had a good, the founders run this massive podcast.
00:47:06.078 - 00:47:21.362, Speaker D: They have a bunch of followers. They airdropped him what's now worth like seven figures worth of this token. So that you can absolutely see a world where this is pumping. He's going to. There's a chance he randomly mentions it when or dump on us. Yeah. Fuller selling.
00:47:21.362 - 00:47:30.014, Speaker D: No, but they. A bunch of his nfts and then, like, they're doing, there's a 1%, uh, what do you call it?
00:47:30.954 - 00:47:33.894, Speaker B: Trump is a hired. I think he's a higher likelihood.
00:47:34.234 - 00:47:56.214, Speaker D: They donate a portion to veterans and then a portion to, like, child trafficking prevention, and they've already donated a meaningful amount there. So it's pretty, pretty good narrative. But, yeah, there's always a chance that, that Trump's. And then you have, like, the 47 memes that. That I'm sure will be anchors for price in the future. Or not anchors, but magnets.
00:47:56.914 - 00:48:00.294, Speaker A: Magnets, magnets.
00:48:01.304 - 00:48:22.336, Speaker C: One of my long time holdings is doing well. Sin is doing well. Is it doing decently well from the bottom? Not like overall, but they just launched this new RFQ bridging. It's kind of cool to use. It's like, basically, like instant bridging between chains for, like, less than $10,000. And they're gonna expand that later. But it's honestly a pretty good ux going from chain to chain.
00:48:22.400 - 00:48:41.416, Speaker B: Yeah, everybody. That's like, how all bridging is going now. Yeah, the crosses move to that model. Deep bridges move to that model. It's like this intent based kind of thing, and then you're not having, like, money locked in bridges, you're just dealing with native assets. This is something we actually wrote about in the m four year report, so go ahead and check that out.
00:48:41.440 - 00:49:38.224, Speaker C: But they didn't mention synapse, because another interesting one to look into on Solana's lithinity that I bought some of that. It's an interesting Dex, like, debtors can probably talk about it more, but basically they're just like an Oracle Dex on Solana that concentrates, like, their liquidity, which is all protocol owned around, like, the oracle pricing. And most of their pools have been profitable in terms of their market making profits, and then also just their general fees. Still, I think they do between ten to 15% of all of salon and Dex volume. And they're just kind of, like, optimizing for kind of the most revenue. It's an interesting play. It's like, pretty, like unknown, but something cool to check out.
00:49:39.204 - 00:49:41.676, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so, yeah, just go.
00:49:41.700 - 00:49:44.564, Speaker C: Straight to, yeah, I own affinity as well.
00:49:44.604 - 00:49:48.116, Speaker B: I've, like, been following this project for a long time, like two years now, maybe.
00:49:48.140 - 00:49:51.264, Speaker A: I believe Yann owns Trump too. Just to disclose this for.
00:49:51.704 - 00:50:31.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the thing with affinity. So they're very good on, like, capital efficiency because they have this oracle that, like, these, the pith oracle rate updates prices in real time, and then they also kind of employ these market making type strategies where they try and actually trade momentum, but they are kind of just like fundamentally like capped at some point. Right. Because the Oracle, an oracle based model like this, you always have to wait for centralized exchange liquidity to start, like market making for it because you're, you need the oracle, right. And you need like, so it'll never be the place of price discovery, but.
00:50:31.270 - 00:50:47.726, Speaker C: It could be like more dominant than it is right now, I think. Because basically like, like Solana trading, 90% of that probably happens on SEC, on centralized exchanges. So like they could grow to like even bigger part of the sold. Yeah, I mean, what is like new tokens?
00:50:47.750 - 00:50:51.194, Speaker A: What's the trading at? What's, what's the value that you did?
00:50:51.774 - 00:50:59.622, Speaker C: Um, so 55% of the tokens are in the treasury, I believe. Um, but answering it, like, it's like.
00:50:59.638 - 00:51:06.806, Speaker B: A hard token to like understand. It's like pretty electric. There's like all these different curve locking type things.
00:51:06.950 - 00:51:12.126, Speaker C: Yeah, they have like the lock and stuff, but I can send you something afterwards on it.
00:51:12.190 - 00:51:13.634, Speaker A: What, what's it trading at?
00:51:14.514 - 00:51:28.010, Speaker C: Well, yes, the FDV with like 60% treasury I think is 250 million. But then like there's a lot of nuance and like the circulating because a bunch of. It's locked up.
00:51:28.162 - 00:51:46.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like the, I mean, like they had this, this bonk pool that they started. Bonk sold like 20k liquidity and they started that, like the bottom of bonk. And that pool that was market making bonk Sol actually up for four. Like the straight price increase in block, which is pretty insane when you think about that.
00:51:47.504 - 00:51:48.944, Speaker D: That's nuts.
00:51:49.064 - 00:51:50.272, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:51:50.328 - 00:51:52.724, Speaker D: What, what kind of pool? What's the pool design?
00:51:53.144 - 00:51:56.096, Speaker B: It uses oracle on it and they do like dodo.
00:51:56.120 - 00:51:58.640, Speaker A: Isn't this what Dodo tried to do, like back in the day?
00:51:58.712 - 00:52:01.604, Speaker C: But it's just like faster.
00:52:01.984 - 00:52:10.178, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, this model only works. Yeah, I know. The bonk boat was crazy. Like, it was actually insane.
00:52:10.266 - 00:52:16.018, Speaker D: Like the only way you expected like Alfred was if it does this for a while. But like bonk just went up because.
00:52:16.066 - 00:52:16.930, Speaker B: They also do like.
00:52:16.962 - 00:52:22.562, Speaker A: No, but it turns over a lot, though. Like, I remember the, there's some of the pools on the finity there. They're turning over like 20 times.
00:52:22.658 - 00:52:26.002, Speaker C: Like. Yeah, no, the turnovers and the fees.
00:52:26.058 - 00:52:29.002, Speaker A: Probably were, were pretty ridiculous.
00:52:29.058 - 00:52:51.062, Speaker B: It was the fees and then they. So they're like a very. Yeah, they're very transparent. They like break down and give you like, what's fees? What's market making profit? Right. And like market make a profit is kind of how they do, like, trend following and stuff, and momentum trading. And so I think they had a lot of. And, like, market making profit stays in the pools, whereas the fees get, like, distributed.
00:52:51.198 - 00:53:00.314, Speaker C: Yeah. So the bonk USDC pool has $72,000 worth of liquidity in it. In the past 24 hours, it's done 1.3 million in volume.
00:53:00.864 - 00:53:32.276, Speaker B: And they also have, like, they'll make multiple pools. Right? Like, so they'll have Sol USDC, which has, like, 300k liquidity and does a lot of volume, and then they'll have one with, like, a mil liquidity, which actually does a lot less volume, but it's just able to handle, like, bigger trades. Right? Yeah, but, yeah, like, there's been a couple. I mean, it's oracle model, so there's been, like, a couple, like, oracle issues and where they, like, mispriced assets and stuff. Um, so that there's definitely, like. Yeah, there's kind of, like, two ways to do this. Like, mev.
00:53:32.276 - 00:53:52.576, Speaker B: To have, like, an amm. Not get just, like, arp to death. And we've talked about this before, right? You either have an oracle type model like this, or you have some sort of, like, top of block auction that, you know, you see in cosmos and, like, some other protocols they're trying to work on ethereum and stuff. A or a.
00:53:52.600 - 00:53:53.786, Speaker A: Right, that.
00:53:53.786 - 00:54:08.112, Speaker B: No, like. Like, more like Sorella, where you have. Yeah, just like, if you want to interact with the contract, which is, like, the pools, you need to have this auction at the start. Very similar to, like, what skip does with their protocol builder.
00:54:08.288 - 00:54:19.280, Speaker A: All right, I think with that, we'll. We'll call it. Cheers, guys. This was a good one. Yeah, great episode. Enjoyed it. See you again in two weeks, right?
00:54:19.472 - 00:54:19.952, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:20.008 - 00:54:20.304, Speaker D: See ya.
