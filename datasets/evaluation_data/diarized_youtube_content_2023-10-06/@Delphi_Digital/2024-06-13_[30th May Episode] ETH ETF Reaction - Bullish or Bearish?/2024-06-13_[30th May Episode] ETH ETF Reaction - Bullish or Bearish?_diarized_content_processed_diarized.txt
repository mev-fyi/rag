00:00:11.280 - 00:00:32.626, Speaker A: Everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. This week we have ceteris on holiday. So to replace him, we brought in Jason, head of markets at Delphi Research. And as always, we have Jan, managing partner at Delphi Ventures. And Duncan, what is it again?
00:00:32.810 - 00:00:36.334, Speaker B: Shitcoin scavenger, Gem Hunter.
00:00:37.314 - 00:01:00.582, Speaker A: Ok. Gem Hunter. That's it. Yeah. We have a lot to chat about this week. We had the ETH, we had Trump changing tune on politics and kind of single handedly changing the crypto, like, crypto regulatory landscape in the US and a bunch of other stuff, too. So I guess we'll start with the ETF.
00:01:00.582 - 00:01:22.746, Speaker A: Who wants to context set here on what happened. Like, obviously there was this consensus that the ETF wasn't going to get approved. And then sometime on Monday, Eric Balkanist, the ETF guy, like, tweeted and updated his, his odds from, from, like, what was it, 5% to, like 75%?
00:01:22.930 - 00:01:25.306, Speaker C: It was like 25 to 75, I think.
00:01:25.490 - 00:01:43.134, Speaker A: Was it? Okay, I remember him saying at some point that he thought it was like less than 10%, but, yeah, I guess the official was 25%. Market was slow to react, but then seems like it happened. What's the. Yeah. Who wants to start with, like, adding context or just your take on it?
00:01:43.734 - 00:01:44.594, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:01:45.014 - 00:02:25.244, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I guess obviously people, I think basically nobody thought it was going to happen. So obviously that caught the market offside. Like, the ETH was up like 20% that day, which is a pretty insane move. And just to contextualize that, I think that one day it added, like, the entire market cap of Solana, which is pretty crazy to think about. But I think overall, the ECTF is going to be, like, really bullish for alts and kind of the broader crypto ecosystem. I wrote a little bit about this on Twitter that just like, I don't know if you want to go into that now or we can kind of save that.
00:02:25.244 - 00:03:24.164, Speaker B: But the bitcoin ETF was kind of isolated to affecting bitcoin because there's no real ecosystem around it. So, like, the flows come into bitcoin, bitcoin goes up, and, you know, people are, like, chasing other things because, like, bitcoin is just the market beta, but there's no direct, like, flow through of that money actually going into the broader ecosystem, especially after 2021, where a lot of the bitcoin lending products, even on the c five side or the leverage side, don't really exist anymore. So it was pretty isolated just to bitcoin. But Ethereum's a lot more intertwined with the broader defi and crypto ecosystems. So it's price moving affects Defi and alts a lot more. Like, we can go into that now or we can kind of save that conversation for later. But I think it's pretty bullish for Ethereum and especially like, kind of Ethereum, Defi and Ethereum based alts, where bitcoin was more just the market leader.
00:03:24.164 - 00:03:46.138, Speaker B: I actually saw a tweet this morning that said only like seven coins have gotten past, like, BTC all time highs since 2021, which is crazy, right? If you think about it, only seven altcoins have, like, reached new highs against bitcoin from, from last cycle, even though we're already, I think you do it.
00:03:46.146 - 00:04:47.160, Speaker C: On a market cap basis. It's probably quite a few more though, right, with all the issuance and it kind of goes back to what's happened over the past two years. But yeah, I think that the biggest thing was written. No one was expecting it. Market moves and now you're in this kind of lull in terms of figuring out when it actually goes live and when you see the flows kick in. We pumped from basically three k to 38 and are now in this kind of limbo status where what were previous headwinds on the regulatory side and ETF rejection are now hopeful tailwinds just because the crypto user base in the US has kind of hit critical mass where it goes from something you could push away to now there's enough of a single issue voter contingent that you need to appeal to them to some extent.
00:04:47.272 - 00:04:51.444, Speaker A: Now, Jason, do you want to say something? Before? I was going to ask another question about the ETF.
00:04:52.364 - 00:04:52.748, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:52.796 - 00:05:41.536, Speaker D: I mean, so I guess, like, the way I was looking at it, right. I guess a lot of people who have, like, read the stuff that I've written or listened to it or whatever, like, I was certainly not in the camp of may approval by any stretch of the imagination. I was, I was kind of leaning towards probably like an early 2025, you know, approval similar to like bitcoin. Right. How you got kind of get those delays, those delays, everything gets figured out and then, you know, push through on like one of the last deadlines, so to speak. And so obviously, like, this has definitely changed things, right? Like, if you were like two weeks ago, I was very confident in my allocation into like, the ecosystems and coins I was in. And then fast forward today, I mean, I'm not like super unconfident, but like, I obviously need to take into account new information, right.
00:05:41.536 - 00:06:01.166, Speaker D: And I think the vast majority of the market probably is in that position, right? Even, even some of the eth guys, right? Because they're like, okay, well, like, now Eth is approved, where do I want to, like, allocate to within Eth, right? And I guess this is like what I, what I want to ask you guys, like, now that, like, it's kind of like ball is in the court for ETh. It's like, where's the best place?
00:06:01.190 - 00:06:04.166, Speaker B: Are you telling me you're rotating out of your memes?
00:06:04.270 - 00:06:05.854, Speaker D: No, I'm just buying more.
00:06:05.934 - 00:06:12.754, Speaker B: Live on the hive mind, just buying more shit. We're out of whiffs, out of bonk, or into real projects.
00:06:13.454 - 00:06:20.630, Speaker D: The first project I bought was Pepe when the ETH ETF started breaking. To be honest.
00:06:20.702 - 00:07:23.354, Speaker A: I'll answer your moving strongest, but maybe before, just before we move on to, like, what alts to buy is beta. Beta. What do you guys think about, like, the ETH price performance generally and like upside from here? Because obviously, I think a lot of people thought that the ETF rejection was kind of bullish because it gave the bull market more time, gave bitcoin more time to get ingrained, like the bitcoin ETF, rather than having this other thing competing for flows. And you also just have more time to speculate, whereas now it's getting approved earlier. And then at the same time, the performance, obviously that candle was ridiculous, but since then, performance has kind of been underwhelming. Is this a case of, like, people were so offsides, like, ETH sentiment was just at an all time low and so it's just going to take time for it to sort of reprice and for people to come in and adjust to this? Or is this showing some like, eth weakness and some like, projection that the ETF isn't going to be that bullish?
00:07:23.974 - 00:07:26.542, Speaker B: I think. I think the move is pretty strong.
00:07:26.638 - 00:08:08.320, Speaker C: Yeah, well, yeah, I think it was mostly internal money that moved around. Right. And so now there needs to be time for the narrative to get crafted, for tradfi to move in. Is it oil to BTC's gold type stuff and just a way that they can get on board to invest. Because if you look at the flows in Q one, you had accommodation retail, but there was a decent amount of institutional investors. I forget the amount of funds that came out and filed 13 fs, but it was like a record breaking amount. You know, many, many multiples of what gold did when it launched their ETF's.
00:08:08.320 - 00:08:59.448, Speaker C: Granted, you know, that was in the early, mid two thousands. So very different story in terms of the landscape, but you still saw quite a bit of kind of institutional demand. And so, you know, that that did help drive those flows. It wasn't retail and it also wasn't a scenario where we thought, you know, institutions would take a while to onboard for a handful of reasons. I think the larger amount of them are still in the process of doing so just based on a whole host of factors we've talked about. But they did move the needle in Q one for BTC price. So I think you don't necessarily have this sell the news type scenario, but you need time to craft the narrative and that flow can only really happen once the ETF launches.
00:08:59.448 - 00:09:31.076, Speaker C: I think what you saw now was basically immediate crypto repositioning. Leverage ticked up but not an insane amount. CMeo I ticked up but not like an insane amount. This isn't a massively leverage driven rally. There's a combination of both spot and leverage, but showing that you do have this first leg. But I think the second leg to come is still going to be there and is more of a flow system that happens once it launches rather than something that needs to get completely front run.
00:09:31.180 - 00:09:39.684, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I probably agree with a lot of that. I'm trying to remember back to when Blackrock filed their whatever.
00:09:39.844 - 00:09:41.064, Speaker B: It took a while.
00:09:41.484 - 00:10:16.512, Speaker D: Yeah. But it was very much clear that the bitcoin ETF would be approved when Blackrock started its process. Everybody, the Bloomberg boys, everybody who actually follows these processes, like the lawyer Scott Johnson, all those guys, like, once Blackrock started entering that ETF process for bitcoin, was it like March or April of last year? Right. It was very clear that like, the end game was approval. So, like, you had that like six month, seven month period of like Goldilocks speculating. You had the fiscal situation in the US getting like, you know, worse and worse. People started talking about it.
00:10:16.512 - 00:10:55.696, Speaker D: So you had like, that perfect narrative that nobody really had to go. Looking forward to Yan's point for bitcoin, my thing with ETH is like, yeah, that first day performance was awesome, but like, I'm kind of, I don't know if Jose was alluding to that. I did find the follow through price action over the last several days to be pretty weak. You had several more positive news headlines come out and price couldn't really do anything with it. And since then, it's just bleeding out slowly. It's not really bleeding out, but it's just more so going sideways and selling off a little bit. So I'm not sure the market really knows exactly how it wants to play this run up.
00:10:55.696 - 00:11:33.024, Speaker D: And I'm also not sure the market knows exactly how to play. It's like, okay, do the s one s and stuff go live? And does it start trading in a month? Does it start trading three months from now? I think that kind of ambiguity is kind of, at least in the short term, making positive price action and momentum moves above prior all time highs because you don't really have anywhere else to go. You're at 4k. Next stop is new highs. Right. So, like, I just think there's probably a lot of sellers up here that are just using this as an opportunity to kind of like, get out. And then, like, over the next couple weeks and months, you probably start to see the, the actual run up into approval.
00:11:33.764 - 00:11:51.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think also the other thing, like, there's ambiguity around, like, when it'll actually be launched. And also, like, you have probably a little bit of like, the market reacting to how, like, how well the flows absorb, like, the Ethiop flows.
00:11:51.472 - 00:11:51.616, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:51.640 - 00:11:57.044, Speaker B: Because after the bitcoin ETF, we sold off pretty hard.
00:11:57.664 - 00:11:58.848, Speaker D: Yeah, it was a couple of weeks.
00:11:58.936 - 00:12:26.224, Speaker B: For like, yeah, two or three weeks before we had our insane rip. So obviously those same dynamics are at play with Ethi and I think to a similar magnitude, if not more. Like there's 10 billion and the aum and ethy. So that's like, you know, I think we've had like half or more of GBDC unwind. So, you know, maybe they're not going to drop the fees as or maybe they're going to drop the fee more aggressively.
00:12:27.124 - 00:12:31.348, Speaker D: So you don't have that separate product set up, though, with the, with less fees.
00:12:31.476 - 00:12:34.652, Speaker B: They have the. Yeah, the bitcoin mini trust. I don't know if that's live.
00:12:34.708 - 00:12:36.068, Speaker D: They don't have that for ETh.
00:12:36.236 - 00:13:35.766, Speaker B: I'm sure they're going to do the same thing, but I don't even think the bitcoin mini, mini one is live. But obviously, like, yeah, then the CEO of Grayscale got fired or stepped down or something. So, you know, obviously they weren't super happy with, with the outflows, but, like, I don't know what they were going to expect when they had, you know, one and a half percent fee versus ibid at like 30 bps and then also all that kind of stuck capital that was trading in there under Nav for so long. But I think, like, the reaction was pretty good so far. And then it'll get better as there's more clarity around the actual launch and then also as the market kind of comes to digest the ETH stuff because if there's going to be a few billion in selling, that's obviously that it knows is going to happen just because of these bankrupt estates or whatever. There's probably an element where it doesn't want to get ahead of that. But as you saw with the BTC ETF that happened and then we ripped after.
00:13:35.766 - 00:13:39.774, Speaker B: So there's conflicting, conflicting there.
00:13:40.274 - 00:14:09.714, Speaker A: I kind of agree with Jason that price action was weaker than I expected. I would have expected like, given where sentiment was as well, where the odds of this were priced at. And, like, you know, there was, there was Peter Zulagi arguing with the other, with darn Kratt on Twitter. There was, like, eth maxi capitulation. I just would have expected, like a pop to, I don't know, near, near all time highs or all time highs and then sell off from there rather than. Rather than this. But I don't know.
00:14:09.714 - 00:14:31.150, Speaker A: I also think it's possible that the sentiment kind of misrepresents what's actually happening because I do think a lot of people just denominate an ETH and a lot of whales, especially, like, just denominate an Ethan, haven't really sold it. Yeah. So maybe it. But then I would have expected that there wouldn't be that many sellers either up here.
00:14:31.222 - 00:14:31.934, Speaker C: Like, if you.
00:14:32.014 - 00:14:33.598, Speaker A: But I don't know, sir.
00:14:33.726 - 00:14:44.022, Speaker C: Rotating and bitcoin didn't rip to all time highs, though. All right. Immediately, like, bitcoin didn't kind of use its price action relative to its previous eyes of proxy.
00:14:44.118 - 00:15:00.638, Speaker D: Yeah, like, the news of bitcoins, ETF came out. Like, that was like, right when, like, Gary was getting really, really, really terrible with regulations. It was literally, like, at the pico bottom of every. It was. Bitcoin was like 20k. So, like, expect 25k or something. Yeah.
00:15:00.638 - 00:15:25.294, Speaker D: Expecting it to rip to 70k before ETF's were live and flows. Like, I don't know. I wasn't really expecting that. But, like, it's hard for me to, like, judge this e thing, right. Because, like, I've been severely underweight Eth for the majority of this cycle. So, like, I'm clearly biased here. So, like, I'm very curious to see, like, Zay's, like, you know, take on this going forward because he's obviously way more in the weeds with that stuff.
00:15:25.294 - 00:15:38.204, Speaker D: And, like, what's, what's, like, the way to think about it? You know, think about the Eth ecosystem now that you actually don't have all of this. You know, like, regulatory headwinds in the way. Like, what's the proper way to think about it?
00:15:38.864 - 00:16:03.550, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that, that's a great question. I think that should be what we, what we talk about next. Like Eth, beta. I get a beta. Or like, who's. Yeah, what are you guys, what do you guys think benefits from this? Personally, I don't have a great, a great like answer or, or pick for, but I don't, I wouldn't have one on any ecosystem. Like, I don't think there's great, so beta either.
00:16:03.550 - 00:16:30.810, Speaker A: Like, I just think a lot of this stuff that's publicly trading is, is pretty expensive. I do think, like, I have a few. Yeah, definitely maker. We've talked about on this podcast before. I'm pretty excited about what they're doing and the comeback there. There's a bunch of other like kind of defi protocols on ETH that are pretty underpriced relative to traction, I'd say. But yeah.
00:16:30.810 - 00:16:32.610, Speaker A: Curious what you guys are thinking on that.
00:16:32.802 - 00:17:17.446, Speaker D: What do you think about. The first thing that came to mind for me was like, okay, well, if ETH is now going to be something that potentially outperforms or does outperform, obviously everything, and this probably goes to Duncan's Twitter thread on his e three flexivity thing, obviously eth ecosystem alts should probably outperform the native token. And in some ways, so, like, my initial thought was like, okay, like, if every, if everybody on soul bought memes, probably people are gonna buy Pepe or whatever shit there. But then I was like, in that same post in our, you know, internal Delphi chats, I was like, I don't know, Athena makes a lot of sense, right? Cause if everybody starts gambling on ETH and funding rates and stuff start going high, like, it just makes a ton of sense just from like a very, like, explain. Like, I'm five, keep it simple. Stupid methodology.
00:17:17.470 - 00:17:21.594, Speaker B: Yeah, you're just fighting like issuance on Athena, I feel like is the big thing.
00:17:22.004 - 00:18:11.392, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm obviously like very bullish on Athena and like farmed a lot of it. So I have like, stuff that hasn't unlocked yet, which definitely affects my, my judgment on it. I'm super bullish. I also think, like, the Bybit integration hasn't properly gone live yet, you know, in terms of bybit actually integrating the yield side. And I think that'll be like really huge because, yeah, we haven't talked about this on the podcast, but I just think, no, like, stablecoin outside of Tether, USDC and BUSD has been integrated into CFI and is collateral for perps. And with the Athena integration, you can basically get 45 to 50 depending where Athena is trading and where you think it's going to be trading at the end of season two in four months. Like 45% to 50% yield on your collateral that you're trading perps against.
00:18:11.392 - 00:18:45.784, Speaker A: And all you're giving up is basically it's a 90% LTV instead of the 100% that you normally get with stable coins. And it just feels like a lot of people will move over to Bybit and USD as collateral. I think that could drive a lot of issuance. And then from there, it's like, to me, a short step to just having USD denominated perp markets. If you're using USD as collateral, why do you want to trade with tether pairs and risk, like taking the exchange rate risk on USD and tether. Right. And then I also think it's a small step.
00:18:45.784 - 00:18:46.984, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:18:47.924 - 00:19:58.570, Speaker C: No, I was gonna say, I think the step from USD not being able to be used as collateral to being used as collateral is a lighter lift operationally, and a much, much, much bigger impact than the next step of moving to USDe based trading pairs, which I think is a much, much larger lift in terms of operationally integrating that and everyone having to switch over. And it takes a while, it's always going to be a less liquid market, and then eventually it's a more liquid market. So you have a pretty annoying cold start problem there. So the difficulty of integrating that versus the upside is there's certainly upside in having all these USD based pairs on these exchanges. But, you know, I think, again, like lift versus reward on underlying collateral, massive lift versus, or like, you know, very favorable lift versus reward on USDE integrating as a cross asset trading pair. Not great, I guess, this, but I agree it's a good next step.
00:19:58.762 - 00:20:25.980, Speaker A: Well, to me that it's like buybit integrates and then I think if the response is good, and I don't see why it wouldn't be like a lot of people moving to bybit. USD is collateral. I think other centralized exchanges will move to do this too. Right? And like, that's why this point season is so bullish. Cause it's basically like subsidized business development, right? Everyone wants to integrate USD because they can provide yield to their users and you actually don't even have to pay for these integrations. Like, people are pushing to integrate with you. And then I think other exchanges integrate it.
00:20:25.980 - 00:21:07.304, Speaker A: And then, yeah, maybe the trading pair sort of takes longer and then there's also, like, Athena chain think is a pretty interesting vision. And some of the other stuff they laid out in that white paper post. Like Duncan said, I think the challenge with InA is just the supply demand dynamics. Like figuring out, because you basically have, let's assume that season two hands out the same amount of tokens as season one for simplicity. Then you have 2% of. In a supply that's unlocking over the next, like, four months, and then another 5% hitting the market in or, like, probably two and a half percent, assuming they do the same vest. Right.
00:21:07.304 - 00:21:33.346, Speaker A: Two and a half percent hitting the market in the four months, and then another 2.5% unlocking for the next six months after that, assuming there's a season three, and then unlocks from team and investors after that. So it's like the supply demand dynamics, I think, are the challenge there, but it's just figuring out. I think a lot of that is hedged. Like, and you kind of saw that with the last unlock where the. The impact was pretty small. Like, the.
00:21:33.450 - 00:21:38.814, Speaker B: I was looking at it this morning, like, the funding rate has flipped, like, positive on, you know.
00:21:39.314 - 00:21:40.026, Speaker A: Yeah, it's usually.
00:21:40.050 - 00:21:53.604, Speaker C: It's pretty volatile, though, so, like, it'll kind of go back and forth. So I definitely think a decent amount is hedged, particularly when you. When it ran up to, like a buck 50. I think you saw it. Oh, I pick up. Yeah.
00:21:53.724 - 00:22:00.628, Speaker B: Okay. Never mind. It's back to today. It's negative. Yeah. So you can also find some points over time.
00:22:00.796 - 00:22:15.464, Speaker A: Like, at some point, they have this. This, like, because recently they shifted over yield to SUSD. Right. Like, from. From the insurance fund. And that just boosted, like, the SUSD yield to, like, 36.5% or something.
00:22:15.464 - 00:22:40.780, Speaker A: And it seems like, like the sweet spot is around 20, like, 2020 5% for people actually foreseeing positive, like, minting activity. And you're also seeing, like, more, like, markets for that and stuff. And I think eventually they can shift over a bunch of that yield to Ina as well. Right. And, like, counter a lot of the. Of the unlocks with that because they have, like, real. I don't know what the latest numbers are, actually.
00:22:40.780 - 00:23:07.152, Speaker A: I should probably look that up. But it's one of the most profitable protocols in crypto and also, to me, just one of the best narratives. Like, still the stable coin is like the killer app. And I think these guys have, like, are going to have the highest risk adjusted. Well, risk adjusted is, like, a matter of perspective. But I have 90% of my stables or something in Athena, so I'm pretty confident with the. On that, and I think it is a good risk adjusted yield.
00:23:07.152 - 00:23:35.636, Speaker A: It's just like the supply demand dynamics. It's just really hard to know because some stuff unlocks and it's like a Solana event. Right, where it's like just a non event and other stuff unlocks, or lido, even like lido. People talked a lot about the unlocks and then it was in the non event and then other stuff unlocks and it's brutal. Right. It's really hard to know how much is head, how many secondary transactions happen so that the cost basis, what the actual cost basis is. So, yeah, I'm very bullish on Athena, but, yeah, that's the.
00:23:35.636 - 00:23:36.892, Speaker A: That's kind of the main concern.
00:23:36.948 - 00:23:59.924, Speaker C: I'd say it's also the investor base. Are they no protocol reconcentrating successful? Or are they. Yeah. Or are they historically sellers of immediate liquidity, which I think is also partially driven by whether it's primarily kind of lp capital versus internal capital.
00:24:00.704 - 00:24:13.250, Speaker B: Yeah, also it's just like, if you can make a reasonable argument for its valuation versus, like, some of this shit is just like, you know, at least it's like a product in revenue. Some of this stuff is literally like vapor.
00:24:13.402 - 00:24:38.814, Speaker A: Yeah, that's also my. There's a lot of vapor out there commanding huge valuations. And I think as unlocks happen, like, ina could just absorb a lot of that, like, shift to Ena as like the. Because when I look around at ETH beta, it's just tough to find something as attractive. I don't know what else. You guys. What about Lido? I know yon you were bullish.
00:24:38.814 - 00:24:39.874, Speaker A: You know?
00:24:41.494 - 00:24:44.870, Speaker C: I was bullish, like beginning of 2023.
00:24:45.062 - 00:24:46.194, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:24:47.414 - 00:24:49.054, Speaker B: So I think on the Enid stuff is.
00:24:49.094 - 00:24:55.518, Speaker C: Yeah, it rips. What are you talking about? Okay, and the 22 and beginning 23, it absolutely ripped.
00:24:55.646 - 00:24:58.014, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:24:58.094 - 00:25:17.604, Speaker B: I think the Enos, if you just have to be careful about the unlocks and like. Yeah, it's kind of hard to tell, but it's definitely better than most low float, high FTV coins. Lido, I feel like, is one where. Well, here, can I maybe lay out the kind of thought process and, like, why the ETH is going to be more bullish so we can go into specific coins?
00:25:19.704 - 00:25:20.016, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:20.040 - 00:26:48.630, Speaker B: So I wrote a thread on this earlier this week where basically, you know, as I was saying earlier, the bitcoin ETF's like, very isolated, but let's say, like, ETH were to kind of, like, double upon this because there's a lot of positive flows and, you know, excitement around it. ETH doubles. That has like a massive ripple effect through the defi ecosystem where like, you know, TVL and all these protocols like Lido, like Maker, like Eigen layer or something is all, you know, when it's mostly ETH is going to like double itself and then that like boosts yields, that boosts fees, which then, you know, translates into like higher, like stronger fundamentals for these altcoins which like catches a bid for them. Then there's more activity on chain chain and as these bitcoins for these all coins and like new projects launch or projects like, you know, ramp up their liquidity mining. And so it kind of is this loop where ETH goes up kind of makes Defi's fundamentals look better just from the ETH price going up, causing more activity, new launches, liquidity mining, which like sucks in more capital of ETH. And then you get metrics like the burn and users going up, which I feel like the tradfi analysts will get all excited about, which could push more flows. So I think you could see a very 2021 esque move where kind of like ETH is really carrying the whole Defi ecosystem and all these ETH alts.
00:26:48.630 - 00:27:19.816, Speaker B: Whereas with the BTC ETF, there's no direct flow into alts. Like people are holding BTC. We saw like a decent run in like ordinals and runes and stuff. But, you know, there's no direct implications to, like bitcoin Defi of bitcoin going up. And it's much harder to spend bitcoin, right? Like there's a lot more friction involved in, like, and also just like the culture of bitcoin. People want to hold bitcoin. The people, the type of people who are holding bitcoin are probably like, you know, more aligned with bitcoin versus ETH is like more open minded community.
00:27:19.816 - 00:27:54.506, Speaker B: The price goes up, they're more willing to spend it and deploy into these protocols. So you just have like a way more kind of like reflective dynamic, an effect among the whole ecosystem which you just didn't have on the bitcoin ETF. So I feel like laying that out. You could kind of get a revitalization of like a theorem alts and ethereum defi. You also have some of the smaller coins like the on chain coins that are like paired with like their liquidity in ETH that just by ETH going up, like, they will go up alongside them. So I'm like pretty bullish alts here.
00:27:54.610 - 00:28:13.454, Speaker A: I agree with that. And like Jason always says, right, that no one in, no one on crypto Twitter owns enough bitcoin. Right. We're all underexposed to bitcoin. I definitely am. But it doesn't that mean also the ETF itself would be less bullish ETH if people are more likely to sell and distribute to altcoins?
00:28:13.874 - 00:28:35.218, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I think it drives like the whole, it drives this whole flywheel of like, okay, they sell buy more altcoins. You know, new liquidity mining programs come out which like make Ethio more attractive. And like, you know, you have the burn going and then like more trad by flows. It's like a big loop where bitcoin is just like, okay, you buy bitcoin, the price goes up. There's no kind of like secondary effects of that happening.
00:28:35.346 - 00:28:52.646, Speaker C: Yeah. Yes. And I mean, the, the ETh beta trade has failed so many times. Right. He's been going down into specifically. Well, even when it's gone up, it's like you've, you know, unless you've managed to time it really, really well, you've likely underperformed ETH. Right.
00:28:52.646 - 00:29:18.490, Speaker C: If you look at any kind of arbitrary optimism, all of the charts against ETH. Okay, well, those typically underperformed. Well, that's if you're thinking about. Right. But if you're thinking about things that can actually absorb enough liquidity to detract from flows into ETH, you have to be thinking of very large FDV tokens that otherwise, you know, there's, there are going to be individual alts. But that's, they're not big enough to cannibalize ETH demand. Right.
00:29:18.490 - 00:29:19.894, Speaker C: So, like, what else can.
00:29:22.034 - 00:29:25.042, Speaker B: You need to like cannibal? Like, why do you need, well, if.
00:29:25.058 - 00:29:32.162, Speaker C: We'Re talking about why it could be not as bullish for ETH, because you're going to pile into, into ETH alts. Right.
00:29:32.258 - 00:29:36.082, Speaker B: I'm not saying it's going to be not as bullish for you. I think it's going to be bullish for everything.
00:29:36.138 - 00:29:36.282, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:36.298 - 00:29:38.210, Speaker B: But that was, everything goes up.
00:29:38.322 - 00:30:05.484, Speaker C: Yeah, but, but like if, if you're the risk return on some of these larger ETH alts that can actually cannibalize demand isn't really there. So it's basically the counterargument to ETH, it not being as bullish ETH because there are other liquidity sinks for it. So I guess, yeah. Otherwise it's kind of ETH memes. Pepe has kind of been the winner. I think the polyfy memes are going to continue to do well with.
00:30:07.364 - 00:30:07.700, Speaker A: The.
00:30:07.732 - 00:31:09.258, Speaker C: Kind of adjustment in sentiment from us government. I think it'll actually probably open the door for centralized exchange listings where if you look at kind of memes that were limited to Dexs, they had a ceiling that was high nine figs and it was usually only until they got centralized listings that they were able to kind of go beyond that. So I think that was previously, you know, not possible. But now it seems like these guys are kind of changing their tune on that front, which is going to be bullish there. ETH nfts were usually a pretty good way to get some ETH beta, but this cycle, it looks like memes have cannibalized that approach where it's a more liquid, fungible, easy to deploy size way of kind of getting beta on, on various chains. But I do think like the NFT rotation will probably come back. I don't know.
00:31:09.258 - 00:31:32.474, Speaker C: I don't think it'll be to the same degree just because you've seen memes. But, you know, if you have a scenario where memes run up a lot and nfts haven't really moved, that's probably a pretty ideal time to rotate into those. And once like. Yeah, the FDB of some of these memes just gets kind of silly where the upside is fairly limited, it just makes sense to kind of look for beta elsewhere.
00:31:33.014 - 00:31:33.350, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:33.382 - 00:31:39.510, Speaker B: So you're just kind of going through the different like, play. Is that like you're just going through the different plays?
00:31:39.582 - 00:32:05.866, Speaker C: Yeah, just trying to like what sectors basically, you kind of have, you know, you have like Defi 1.0 or like Dyno defi rights. Those have typically as of late underperformed eth. I think, you know, like maker has actually gone down. I have Maker bags. Yeah, I'll probably be adding more if they kind of keep going lower here. But yeah, that thing's underperform.
00:32:05.866 - 00:32:13.414, Speaker C: Like most ETH beta has. Has been, you know, higher downside, lower upside beta.
00:32:13.714 - 00:32:30.846, Speaker D: What do you guys think about, I mean, obviously, you know, a lot of this is driven by the ethtf or most of it. And if Blackrock is talking about tokenization, you think that narrative probably picks up more. I mean, ondo and stuff like that, I think is trading at near all time highs or above previous all time highs.
00:32:30.870 - 00:32:33.478, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one where it's like a super low float.
00:32:33.646 - 00:32:41.590, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I'm not saying ondo specifically, but like that narrative. Anything in there interesting or. Not really, probably.
00:32:41.702 - 00:32:47.770, Speaker C: It's hard to get excited on a fundamental basis though, there. Yeah, it's definitely a swing trade, but it's.
00:32:47.802 - 00:32:55.098, Speaker A: It's. Yeah, I mean, on those, I would never have expected, like, a 12 billion food that we would valuate.
00:32:55.146 - 00:33:03.690, Speaker B: Yeah, but it. Huh. It's just a low float thing, I think something that.
00:33:03.842 - 00:33:05.802, Speaker A: It's like. It's like a 15% float.
00:33:05.898 - 00:33:10.610, Speaker B: No, it's like. It's, like, obscure. It's, like, obscated where it's really much lower than that.
00:33:10.682 - 00:33:12.394, Speaker A: Oh, really? Oh, interesting.
00:33:12.434 - 00:33:13.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:17.754 - 00:33:21.498, Speaker A: I'm excited about tokenization. I just don't know that there's a.
00:33:21.586 - 00:33:24.434, Speaker D: Good way for it. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:24.474 - 00:34:22.246, Speaker B: So I'll talk about some stuff that's actionable for our audience here instead of just pontificating about random shit. Okay, guys, so if ETh goes up all these, I think there's gonna be a massive opportunity in on chain stuff that's been, like, did you know really well and kind of, you know, pre bitcoin ETF, then, like, bitcoin ETF came out and just, like, memes on Seoul and stuff took over. But there's, like, a lot of, like, pretty strong projects on Ethereum, like, some good people to follow, like, see crypto Sivo, I think, and then Camino. Like, my account, like, those types of accounts that talk about these, like, on chain all have, like, you know, some good businesses. I've talked about banana a lot before, but it's like, these coins that are in, like, the perfect scenario where they have, like, strong fundamentals. All their lp is in ETh. So, like, if ETh goes up, you just automatically get that beta to them.
00:34:22.246 - 00:34:59.092, Speaker B: And they have, like, businesses surrounding ETh or the eth ecosystem that actually, like, have strong fundamentals. And the whole, like, kind of reflective flywheel that I talked about before, like, will benefit them a lot. So you have a lot of tailwinds where it's, like, maybe a return back to Eth season Eth L two s versus a lot of the actions been happening before in Solana. And I'm sure there's some good projects on Solana, too. But this, you have the Eth LP, which will go up if Eth goes up. So you can instabid from that. You have the whole defi ecosystem kind of getting revamped, more attention there.
00:34:59.092 - 00:35:35.680, Speaker B: And then you have these exchanges, like, binance kind of put out. This note the other week with all this low float, high FTV controversy on Twitter that they want to start listing projects that people aren't just going to get wrecked on. Basically, the exchanges have been making a shit ton of money doing these launches where whatever fucking wormhole launches at a $20 billion valuation and no one's right mind can they justify that. Then the exchanges clean up, but all the users just kind of get screwed. So there's kind of been a shift away from that. The market's getting slightly more educated on that. Hopefully that education will continue.
00:35:35.680 - 00:36:08.652, Speaker B: And then a shift to maybe some of these more products that are interesting, have some fundamentals are paired with ETH can take advantage of the e season. I personally like banana a lot. I've talked about that a lot. I own some, obviously, so not financial advice, but those type of on chain coins where it's like, you know, if you're an investor, you're not like a fund trading massive size. Like, you can get into these, take advantage of these trends. I think that there's going to kind of be a return to on chain, which has gotten really hammered over the past. Like, what does that look like other than bitcoin ETF.
00:36:08.788 - 00:36:22.896, Speaker A: So I feel like so far we have maker. Maybe some people are bullish on ENA, we're somewhat bullish on banana. You're bullish on Dunkin. Is there any others? Any others? By the way, none of this, obviously is investment advice. See a disclaimer.
00:36:22.920 - 00:36:24.744, Speaker B: Well, like, I don't want to listen.
00:36:24.784 - 00:36:30.520, Speaker C: Poly polyfy memes still do. Well, yeah, a bunch of them are on you.
00:36:30.712 - 00:37:05.056, Speaker B: No, I think that there's a lot of good projects on I need that are just like smaller, that have just like been unlucky. Look for products with like, stronger fundamentals. And it's just, I don't know any enough, like any that I want to say. I also like synapse here because obviously the bridge, it's gotten hammered pretty hard. And they're widowmaker launching this sin chain, which obviously benefits from more activity, more EtH l two s. More chains launching their l two s. But those are kind of the ones I mentioned previously.
00:37:05.056 - 00:37:31.844, Speaker B: But there are some good fundamental projects that if you look, I think there's going to be a return to kind of ETH. And especially like, the eth Lp pairs. Like, you don't even understand how much you can just get carried from ETh going up. Like, ETH doubles and your coins just basically doubles alongside it, just from EtH going up. And then if you get some extra bids in there, like, it's pretty easy to get some nice beta. Like, I had the example of banana on the ETF day. It's like, main liquidity is ETh.
00:37:31.844 - 00:37:57.148, Speaker B: Banana. ETH was up 20%. Banana was up instantly 20% from that, and then caught another 30% bid from, just, like, people buying alongside of it versus, like, there's some other coins that just, like, you know, maybe get benefited as much. Like, maker, for example. Great example. Like, didn't move at all on the ETF because its liquidity is impaired. So, like, there's a lot of opportunity in the world, and these on chain.
00:37:57.148 - 00:38:00.744, Speaker B: On chain plays. So just go look out there.
00:38:02.044 - 00:38:02.824, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:03.444 - 00:38:11.804, Speaker D: I mean, how confident are you that you get that revival of on chain versus everybody just looks at what happened on soul and just bids the most memes.
00:38:12.464 - 00:38:13.736, Speaker B: Info. Memes.
00:38:13.840 - 00:38:15.600, Speaker C: Eth calls names.
00:38:15.752 - 00:38:41.650, Speaker B: No, ETh going up literally drives this stuff. That's what I'm trying to. That's what I'm trying to fucking say, jason. It's like, eth going up makes all the TvL go up, makes all the fees go up, makes all the yield go up, and it literally drives the cycle, which just isn't the case in any other ecosystem, because every other ecosystem is just, like, doesn't have defi built out to the extent. Like, even, like, eth going up 20%. Oh, like, that. Just, like, increased TVL and probably fee generation of, like, every single defi protocol.
00:38:41.802 - 00:38:45.066, Speaker C: Yes and no. So TVL is all depends on the business model.
00:38:45.130 - 00:38:46.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:38:46.170 - 00:38:59.626, Speaker C: Because, like, tv, like, it's turnover, right? Like, most. Most of them are volume based, not TVL based protocols. Like, yes, you can. You can point at it, but, you know, from a fee generation perspective, it's not an aum fee. It's based on turnover.
00:38:59.770 - 00:39:11.414, Speaker B: I feel like there's some pretty good ones that are, like, Lido. There's an aum one. Like, whatever fucking Eigen layer or something. Like, I don't know, like, one.
00:39:12.434 - 00:39:21.618, Speaker C: It's almost like, not Eigen layer, then pendle. Right? If it's. If it's like, who. Who can. Where are you getting baited? Eigen layer, almost. Which has done well, to be fair.
00:39:21.666 - 00:39:57.796, Speaker B: But, yeah, I just think that this. Well, it's kind of hard to explain, because the factors are so intertwined with each other. But once you get, like, enough eth momentum and, like, activity on the chain, this wheel starts to spin, and it's kind of difficult. It's like, okay, which one comes first? Which exactly triggers it? I think just, like, a general return to, like, eth being, you know, hotter, just general flows into Eth. You know, the eth wealth effect of, like, you know, people bidding alts. Like, there's so many good examples of this last cycle. I feel like a great example of this.
00:39:57.796 - 00:40:00.966, Speaker B: Last cycle is like curve and convex, right?
00:40:01.030 - 00:40:04.982, Speaker D: But everything went up last cycle. Regardless of what Shane. It was on, everything went.
00:40:05.038 - 00:40:09.750, Speaker B: I know, and that's what I'm saying is gonna happen again on e because.
00:40:09.822 - 00:40:15.638, Speaker D: Like I said, didn't have any of that shit last cycle. And they went up infinite too. That's my point.
00:40:15.806 - 00:40:32.938, Speaker B: What, like, soul and. No. And then the next thing is gonna happen after EtH does this, it's gonna get so fucking congested and the gas fees are gonna be so high that everyone's gonna go to Solana, which is, you know, the next point of this thesis that we've been talking about a lot internally. I'm like, I can just see this happening. Just like.
00:40:32.986 - 00:40:57.884, Speaker D: I mean, I get a big move from your thesis, Duncan. I'm just looking at what the market has showed me up until now, and it still seems like the bid for memes Pepe is up 100% in the last two weeks. Banana's not up 100% in the last two weeks. No other coin that I see on ETH is up 100% in the last, last two weeks. Right? So, like, the market is telling me, they're telling. Anybody wants to pay bananas.
00:40:58.824 - 00:41:02.120, Speaker B: I mean, sorry. Pepe's at 5 billion right now.
00:41:02.272 - 00:41:08.032, Speaker D: Yeah. Went up two and a half billion in the last two weeks. More than banana. The ten x bananas market cap.
00:41:08.168 - 00:41:13.592, Speaker B: That's a big move. So now rotate, Mark. Now rotate your pepe bags.
00:41:13.768 - 00:41:16.724, Speaker D: So, like, the question is like, please. Like.
00:41:18.874 - 00:41:19.774, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:41:21.834 - 00:41:26.106, Speaker D: The market is just. I don't know. It seems like it's telling me that. It's like, yo, the bid is still on.
00:41:26.170 - 00:41:30.074, Speaker B: Yeah, because the EVTF hasn't happened yet, sir. Once it happened, don't you?
00:41:30.194 - 00:41:33.414, Speaker D: You could be right, you know? I do hope you're right to an extent.
00:41:34.074 - 00:41:47.166, Speaker A: All right, do we want to. Do we want to keep going? Do we want to talk about that second part of the thesis of ETh getting congested and then moving to Solana? Or do you want to move? Yeah, you guys want to touch on that a little bit?
00:41:47.190 - 00:41:51.470, Speaker B: Or. Well, why is there even, like. I think it's just a given that it's gonna happen.
00:41:51.662 - 00:41:52.718, Speaker A: I don't see why.
00:41:52.846 - 00:41:53.994, Speaker C: I don't know if there's them.
00:41:54.494 - 00:41:59.990, Speaker A: Well, I think it would move to l two s more like. Then, like, it's more likely to move to l two.
00:42:00.022 - 00:42:21.202, Speaker C: It doesn't even have to move. It's just like once you see congestion, the other stuff starts getting bit up in anticipation. You don't even need the activity to move over, like, purely from a price action perspective. Just, it's played out this way before. It doesn't necessarily mean it'll keep happening. But I think that's kind of the, the mindset of that. Like, basically it'll happen.
00:42:21.202 - 00:42:24.814, Speaker C: The question is to what degree. Right. Because it's so expected.
00:42:25.354 - 00:42:45.484, Speaker A: I think the. Yeah, so is definitely. Carl Samani had an interesting point on the. We recorded a podcast with him and Arthur Hayes the other week. Just saying that souls unlock was apparently, and I didn't know this, it was apparently fully unlocked at once. Like, there was no vesting. And so, yeah, you kind of just like, ripped off the band aid there.
00:42:45.484 - 00:43:10.660, Speaker A: It's interesting, like, there is like something to that. Right. Because soul has been capable, like, in size liquid for so long, whereas a lot of these l two tokens, it's just hard to, it's just hard to go in confidently with the supply dynamics. Right. And so because the token isn't investable, it doesn't catch, like a great bid. And, like, the whole ecosystem kind of gets hurt by that.
00:43:10.852 - 00:43:44.176, Speaker B: Yeah, I really, but then, like, you had the friend, like, obviously friend is like completely different, but, like, friend launch. I'm like, this looks pretty cheap at 200 mil. And then, like, you know, I think it's training down 50% instead of like 100 mil. And that could be a problem with, like, just friend not getting a ton of traction outside of the airdrop stuff. But I would really like to see, like, an actual project launch at like, a decent valuation and see what happens. Because it's super depressing to see even these, like, good projects just launch at like, a crazy valuation where, like, they just can't build. The communities can't get it.
00:43:44.176 - 00:43:48.144, Speaker B: Like, the price just can't go up, but the incentives are all fucked up.
00:43:48.264 - 00:44:15.884, Speaker C: Well, it's, it's hard because it's also. You have to, you really have to and you can't do this. Isolate the broader market sentiment when this happens. Right. Like, Seoul happened end of 2020, you could have done any, like, there was nothing you could do to a token and not have it go up in 2021. Right. So it's hard to isolate the market sentiment from the mechanism and say this is purely mechanism based.
00:44:15.884 - 00:45:00.942, Speaker C: This is or not. So that's kind of the tricky part. But I definitely agree with ripping off the overhang. Even thinking about unlocks that happen on a daily basis versus weekly versus monthly versus quarterly, I think it's a lot better to, to kind of have it lumpy. And then have clarity for, you know, a decent amount of time to actually let organic price action take place without there being fear of kind of the unlock happening so soon versus this drip that you just know, yes, it might not be everyone, but there's definitely someone constantly selling this thing every single day. And so, yeah, I'm in the camp of ripping the band aid off. Not necessarily saying it all needs to happen upfront because, you know, you need incentives, you need people to keep building.
00:45:00.942 - 00:45:08.092, Speaker C: You don't want people kind of getting rich immediately and then just not caring. But there's benefit to it being lumpy.
00:45:08.268 - 00:45:08.836, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:08.940 - 00:45:40.080, Speaker A: And that also explains a lot of them. Like, you know, the pepe action. Right? Like, there's something you can ape where you know that, like, it's Eth. It's pure eth beta without any supply overhang issues. And that's, I guess, like, yeah, memes and some of the others we spoke about are the only ones that really make sense for that. Do you want to chat about the political stuff? Maybe a lead in from the politics memes? Just obviously, like, a lot of people have talked about this. I don't know that we have any special insight.
00:45:40.080 - 00:46:22.084, Speaker A: I think the main thing for me is just how bullish, like, I can't understate, I guess, or overstate, rather, how bullish I think this is for the industry. There's been so much innovation that's been held. Innovation and just value capture to tokens. Founders not wanting to found companies in the US doing, spending millions of dollars on lawyers with complicated Panama structures, moving out of the country. Like, it's just been such an overhang. Like the whole Gensler bullshit that the fact that Trump came out so bullish pro crypto and, like, in a really, you know, like, it wasn't just some, like, the original one where he responded to Frank Degas or whatever, was pretty much just like a soundbite.
00:46:22.164 - 00:46:22.356, Speaker D: But.
00:46:22.380 - 00:46:56.098, Speaker A: But then he came out for self, talking about self custody, talking about not letting Elizabeth Warren and her goons take your bitcoin away. Like, very specific things that really resonate. I mean, the Ross Ross over it thing, like, some very specific things that really resonate with a crypto audience that just make it so bullish. And Biden's obviously, like, switched strategies to. There's been a. He's, you know, probably given Gensler a call about the eth, and then there's, like, rumors. There was an article today about how the Biden administration is reaching out to crypto companies and sort of changing their tune, trying to get some ideas on what policy makes sense.
00:46:56.098 - 00:47:39.284, Speaker A: This has become, like, an important issue somehow, suddenly. And that is, like, incredibly bullish. Like, the most bullish thing to me that happened in the last sort of year or so is this. Is this pivot because the US is still, in spite of itself, the hub for crypto? Like, there's a lot of top projects come from the US, and there's. This has been, like, a huge issue. So I think if we can get some clarity on regulation, we're going to see tokens start to do, like, have a lot more flexibility in their token models, distributions, and stuff like this. We're going to see people just be able to ship, spend more time shipping, and less time worrying about getting sued.
00:47:39.704 - 00:48:26.214, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of my biggest. It's kind of one of the things I'm most excited about going forward. You know, bringing the ETH catalyst up was great for the short term, but I'm still in the camp. That would have been bullish to have it later on, but now I think this is a much bigger one. It kind of started with Trump talking at that dinner, doing like a 1 hour, basically q and a at his NFT dinner at Mar a Lago. And from what I heard, like a quarter of that hour was basically spent on crypto. And then kind of, I think the response to that and the realization that he can generate an insane amount in donations really helped him shift his tune on that front.
00:48:26.214 - 00:49:07.448, Speaker C: But it's one of the things that can revitalize buildings. I think in terms of what I was excited about, in terms of what was being built in 20 18, 20, 19, 20 20, even 2021, it seemed like there was a lot more to be excited about, a lot more experimentation happening. And now it's just not to the same degree. I think it's a combination of things. Right. One is the regulatory front. One, I think for all the fun that meme coins create, I do think they're a bit toxic in terms of incentives for builders, where it's, what's the real effort in putting together something, where it's going to take me years to realize this.
00:49:07.448 - 00:50:14.878, Speaker C: There's an insane amount of regulatory risk, and it's not even something where I can follow the rules and be confident in the fact that I will get through unscathed. I have, like, a relatively dishonest and irrational regulatory body coming after me. And so that when you take that and combine it with the fact that there's so many get rich quick kind of meme coin situations, whether you're starting them, whether you're spending time and just trying to figure out what the best option is or whether you're just kind of comfortable sitting in it for the majority of the cycle, I think it does disincentivize. It adds to the list of disincentives on the builder side. So I do think you'll get to some level of meme coin kind of saturation where you kind of go, there's a few big winners, then you have this long tail of random stuff, but then the long tail gets too long and there's too much crap and you get kind of a reconcentration towards the majors. But then as those majors get really big, you kind of need to look for new opportunities. You'll have some kind of accordion effect with the meme coins where like, you know, the big ones will get too big, then you'll go long tail again.
00:50:14.878 - 00:51:28.144, Speaker C: But I think it'll kind of play out to a smaller degree each time. And so that will be a tailwind for the builder component alongside the regulatory front where you can experiment and all the other kind of elements you mentioned without going into them. So, yeah, that's one of the bigger personal tailwinds in terms of building out use cases and, and tapping into real world kind of utility, not like RWAS, but actually consumer based apps that can make sense and allow people to build them in a way that they know they can confidently go to market with the soaking because we chat about this before, but the token is a massive tool that doesn't exist outside of crypto in terms of having liquidity and using as incentive. That's one of the reasons we're all super bullish on the space. But it was handcuffed by this unreasonable regulatory landscape. So getting that out of the way and actually providing a way for them to do so is incredibly bullish and can create very long term tailwinds and not these one off large liquidity events that are these ETF's.
00:51:28.604 - 00:52:04.534, Speaker D: I definitely agree with, with all of that. Kind of like the way I was looking at it when we wrote our year ahead reports back in December of 2023. One of the things we talked about was this upcoming year would either be very bullish for crypto from a regulatory standpoint, or probably very bearish. On one hand you have the actively hostile administration with Biden. On the other hand you have the Republicans, which at the time they weren't super pro crypto. They just weren't like actively hostile against it. I don't think anybody really saw this 180 coming.
00:52:04.534 - 00:52:57.556, Speaker D: And I think this ETF shake up and approval news kind of overshadowed just how important this regulatory shift is. And when you go back to 2016 and you just look at markets, specifically all of the industries that Trump was friendly to during the campaign, or at least promising to try to help or not kill coal, right. All these things, all of these industries ripped entirely for the year after he was elected, right? And so, like, when you think about it, it's like, okay, like, ancillary industries will probably benefit in a better, you know, regulatory environment. That makes a ton of sense. And the fact that both presidents are pretty much fiscally the exact same, they're just going to spend infinite money. It just like, it essentially made, like, the 50 50 outcome of, like, okay, Trump wins, crypto will do good, Biden wins, crypto will have problems. Right.
00:52:57.556 - 00:53:28.512, Speaker D: It kind of removed that decision making and entirely to some degree. Right. It's like, okay, like, they're both kind of promising to make crypto, you know, more palatable from a regulatory standpoint, which then should, you know, address all of the issues you guys brought up with, you know, devs, value accrual, all that good stuff. Right? So then if the question is both are going to be, you know, generally good and they're both going to spend infinite money, like, it kind of seems very, you know, it's kind of like clearing the path for crypto and ancillary. Ancillary industries, in my opinion.
00:53:28.608 - 00:53:51.330, Speaker C: Yeah, just on that front, I do think so. You know, it's hard to trust what politicians are saying before and after elections. I do think the Trump campaign would be more likely to actually be bullish on it, whereas I think the puppets that are controlling the carcass, that is Biden, will very quickly turn on that if he wins.
00:53:51.442 - 00:54:15.830, Speaker A: I mean, the only other thing that's been talked about last two weeks, but we've covered it to death and none of us want to cover it anymore, is the low float, high ftv stuff. Like, everyone suddenly had a take on it. There's like a million vc blogs on it and stuff. But I think we talked about it to death. I don't think it's worth worth chatting about too much more. So, yeah, that was a great episode. Any, any parting.
00:54:15.830 - 00:54:19.114, Speaker A: Parting words or we get to wrap up?
00:54:19.934 - 00:54:22.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I think big dips are for buying.
00:54:22.614 - 00:54:27.794, Speaker B: The denominator is worthless. The bid is infinite.
00:54:29.374 - 00:54:34.878, Speaker A: Oh, did you see sailor change his tune on the ETF? That was wild.
00:54:35.006 - 00:54:38.354, Speaker B: What the, what? Bitcoin did podcast?
00:54:38.774 - 00:54:55.032, Speaker A: No. Yeah. Well, initially he was like, obviously, you know, there is no second best, etc. And like ETF, bitcoin will be the only token to have an ETF. ETH is a security. They're going to go after it and stuff and then take, sorry, that was.
00:54:55.048 - 00:54:56.408, Speaker D: A dumb take to begin with.
00:54:56.496 - 00:55:09.666, Speaker A: It was a dumb take. Absolutely. But, yeah, but, but he hard pivoted right to, like, he was like, actually the ETF's really good for crypto and for bitcoin, we're going to have like a crypto industry. It was like very strange to hear.
00:55:09.690 - 00:55:36.002, Speaker B: Him, hear him well, I think he realized that on the political side, like how strong the broader industry was because like there's not that many, like businesses built around bitcoin versus like the rest of crypto. Like there's a lot of political power in businesses and like mouths like network effect built around the other. So I think maybe he realized, like it's probably better if we're all aligned here, like in terms of, like that for bitcoin and for everyone. Maybe he's going to bid a little long term.
00:55:36.058 - 00:55:36.894, Speaker C: Definitely.
00:55:37.264 - 00:55:43.344, Speaker A: What happens, what happens to Gensler? I hope, I hope, I think consensus.
00:55:43.384 - 00:55:49.936, Speaker C: Is that he's kind of out either way. Right? Regardless of what administration wins. What a weird question is more.
00:55:49.960 - 00:55:55.152, Speaker A: So you went after ripple and lost. You tried to kill the industry and lost to ripple.
00:55:55.288 - 00:56:03.804, Speaker B: But like, do you think actually hammer, like, I feel like he was getting orders, like all the MIT, like, professor videos of him. Like, he seems like kind of.
00:56:04.254 - 00:56:05.774, Speaker D: Oh, regardless if it's here. Yeah.
00:56:05.814 - 00:56:08.514, Speaker B: Clearly has Algorand bags.
00:56:09.934 - 00:56:12.790, Speaker D: Just another weak person in the suits making policy.
00:56:12.982 - 00:56:23.462, Speaker A: Alright, guys, thanks very much. This was an awesome one. And see you in, see you again in two weeks for another hive mind. We might have some exciting news in the meanwhile, so stay tuned.
00:56:23.598 - 00:56:24.198, Speaker D: See ya.
00:56:24.286 - 00:56:25.086, Speaker C: Thanks everyone.
