00:00:01.720 - 00:00:31.334, Speaker A: You want to talk about your role beta or anything else as well. Still the fundamentally cheapest protocol in the space if the revenues are real. Yeah the market seems to be pricing in that the revenues are definitely not real. I think it's more about the market values. Buy and burn versus a rev share model. Buy and burn is just you kind of hold until it's supply and demand but you have some assistance on the demand side. It's basically over a longer time horizon buy and burn leads to a higher value but over shorter time horizons yield does.
00:00:31.334 - 00:00:49.414, Speaker A: And then I think you discount buy and burn more based on kind of going concern right? Because if the if the value doesn't accrue until far out and you have going concern around the project then you discount the present value even more. And so I think that's kind of what's happening at the moment. But yeah the business itself is still burning 2% of supply a month.
