00:00:02.920 - 00:00:07.062, Speaker A: Cl Four 3592, this is Joe. Hello Joe.
00:00:07.158 - 00:00:12.070, Speaker B: Remember what life was like before the iPhone? We used phones for making calls and sending SMS messages.
00:00:12.102 - 00:00:12.918, Speaker A: It's got everything.
00:00:13.006 - 00:00:28.196, Speaker B: The cameras were pixelated and the phone was bulky. Today, we live our lives through our smartphones, using them for payment, social media and more. The iPhone revolutionized the way we use technology and now we're on the verge.
00:00:28.220 - 00:00:31.584, Speaker C: Of a similar transformation in the world of crypto wallets.
00:00:34.044 - 00:00:36.276, Speaker B: At the moment, crypto wallets are like.
00:00:36.300 - 00:00:39.652, Speaker C: The old BlackBerry, built for rudimentary functionality.
00:00:39.748 - 00:00:47.704, Speaker B: And not user experience. They've been designed for a very niche crowd and are a turn off for anyone not already interested in the space.
00:00:48.164 - 00:00:50.020, Speaker C: So let's be honest, we use them.
00:00:50.052 - 00:01:04.872, Speaker B: Because we have to, not because we want to. In this video, well explore how four different crypto wallets are moving us closer to our iPhone moment. Plus well reveal a surprising benefit of hardware wallets you might not know. As the ecosystem evolved, new types of.
00:01:04.888 - 00:01:08.168, Speaker C: Wallets emerged that supported multiple cryptocurrencies connected.
00:01:08.216 - 00:01:13.616, Speaker B: With decentralized applications and hardware wallets. The most popular of these live as.
00:01:13.640 - 00:01:39.770, Speaker C: Chrome extensions, Metamask is the most used crypto wallet with 21 million monthly users. Although it helped enable the explosion of defi and nfts, the user experience remains clunky, particularly for non crypto native users. Changing between wallets and chains is difficult, and it's often unclear what you're signing. Phishing websites can easily mimic metamask pop ups, stealing users seed phrases breaking outside of the extension bar entirely.
00:01:39.882 - 00:01:44.242, Speaker B: Frame is a desktop based, open source, privacy focused wallet that looks like an.
00:01:44.258 - 00:01:46.482, Speaker C: Extension of your computer's operating system.
00:01:46.618 - 00:01:48.554, Speaker B: It offers a simple and intuitive user.
00:01:48.594 - 00:01:50.122, Speaker C: Interface, which can be used via a.
00:01:50.138 - 00:02:04.642, Speaker B: Hot wallet or hardware wallet frame can connect to dapps just like metamask, display nfts and enable users to connect to multiple chains at the same time. On the other hand, Rabi is still a chrome extension. It's built by the dbank team who.
00:02:04.658 - 00:02:08.642, Speaker C: Prioritize users needs and experiences with a user centric approach.
00:02:08.738 - 00:02:11.146, Speaker B: Rabi provides auto switching networks for a.
00:02:11.170 - 00:02:25.222, Speaker C: Seamless multi chain experience, pre signed security checks that protect users from risky transactions, transaction simulation that displays balance changes before signing and address whitelisting at the wallet level to help prevent phishing attacks.
00:02:25.318 - 00:02:27.750, Speaker B: These features make managing assets across multiple.
00:02:27.782 - 00:02:31.134, Speaker C: Blockchains more convenient, secure and efficient.
00:02:31.254 - 00:02:41.038, Speaker B: So what about hardware wallets? They're devices that allow users to safely generate and store private keys offline whilst enabling secure signing of blockchain transactions.
00:02:41.166 - 00:02:43.366, Speaker C: But this is the cool part.
00:02:43.550 - 00:02:44.774, Speaker B: With a hardware wallet.
00:02:44.854 - 00:02:46.214, Speaker C: You can use the same seed phrase.
00:02:46.254 - 00:03:22.136, Speaker B: Across multiple wallet extensions and applications like metamask, Rabi, and frame without having to type in your seed phrase each time. This added mobility makes it easier and safer to switch between wallets.

00:03:22.160 - 00:03:23.672, Speaker C: To access any Dapp straight from their.
00:03:23.688 - 00:03:37.524, Speaker B: Wallet, creating a seamless user experience and reducing the risk of phishing attacks. This creates an Apple App Store like experience as XnFts empower third party developers to build applications that can be used directly in your wallet.
00:03:38.384 - 00:03:48.804, Speaker D: To showcase the functionality of XNFts, Backpack is launching their first XNFt madlads on April 20, a profile picture collection that demonstrates the potential of this new technology.
00:03:49.424 - 00:03:55.808, Speaker B: Backpack is also building infrastructure for custom usernames, push notifications, messaging and social features.
00:03:55.936 - 00:03:59.204, Speaker C: Positioning itself as a potential operating system for crypto.
00:03:59.584 - 00:04:09.384, Speaker D: In response to the changing landscape, Metamask is launching snaps, a new feature that opens up their platform for third party developers to create apps. Though it's still in its early stages.
00:04:09.544 - 00:04:12.072, Speaker C: Snaps demonstrate that Metamask recognizes the need.
00:04:12.088 - 00:04:14.066, Speaker D: To adapt as the crypto wallet landscape.
00:04:14.130 - 00:04:17.054, Speaker C: Becomes more competitive, innovative and user friendly.
00:04:17.994 - 00:05:02.786, Speaker B: Finally, Solana Saga is an upcoming Android based smartphone with a built in seed vault. The seed vault securely stores private keys, seed phrases and other sensitive information, while also enabling interaction with apps running on the device. Combined with Solana Pay and the Solana Dapp store, Saga might mean we've come full circle. And crypto's iPhone moment is another mobile phone. The way in which we interact with blockchain technology is changing. It's becoming easier and more imaginative, and the day when crypto becomes as seamless to use as an iPhone isn't far away.
