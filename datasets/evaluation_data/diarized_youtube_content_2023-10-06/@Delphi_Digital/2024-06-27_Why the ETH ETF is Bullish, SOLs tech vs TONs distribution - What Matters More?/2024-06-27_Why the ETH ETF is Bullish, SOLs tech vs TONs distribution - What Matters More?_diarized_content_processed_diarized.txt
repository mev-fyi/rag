00:00:05.080 - 00:00:28.126, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of the Hive Mind. This week we've got some special guests on. Jose and Jan are away on vacation or work. I'm not. And we have Jason. You know, he's been on a few times, macro trader, professional line, drawer, ta ta extraordinaire, Bear kingdom, dog king.
00:00:28.126 - 00:00:53.110, Speaker A: Lots of titles for him. And then we have Jordan, who's never been on, who's the head of DeFi research at Delphi, and then obviously, Cedris, the head of research in general. So this is really exciting episode. We just had Vanek about an hour ago file for the Solana ETF. We're up 10%. Solana is around 150 right now. And we have the ETH ETF launching next week.
00:00:53.110 - 00:00:55.060, Speaker A: So let's get into it.
00:00:55.180 - 00:01:09.236, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. Maybe you should start, right? You've been pretty active on Twitter over the last, like, week or so. Bull posted threads on the ETH ETF and why everybody's offsides on it. So maybe you want to kind of share a little bit.
00:01:09.428 - 00:01:15.972, Speaker C: And I also think you were like, you were bullish. Ethan Tan here. And so what is this, like, soul?
00:01:16.156 - 00:02:10.360, Speaker A: And so I sold as well, but more so where she's excited about tons. I felt like it hadn't really run and it still doesn't have a bind. But, yeah, anyways, zooming out, I guess, like, just reviewing what I've been posting a bunch on Twitter in the past few days. And why I got really excited is because just for some context, the last couple weeks, we've traded down from, like, 70k, maybe a little higher, all the way down to, I think, 58 five yesterday, you know, 15% pullback on BTC, pretty major. Well, equities were, like, ripping to new all time high. So I was like, pretty, like, depresso and being like, okay, what's going on? This makes no sense. But what kind of turned me around was two days ago, we had basically the mail to the box.
00:02:10.360 - 00:02:43.522, Speaker A: Creditors are finally, you know, going to get their coins distributed over the course of this year. And that was kind of like, I believe, or a lot of people are pointing to, like, insiders were selling down from seventy k to, like, 60 or maybe 61, 62 based on, like, inside information. And then we had the headline come out. We puked another, like, 4%, kind of ran the lows of the range, and now we're kind of bouncing back. But the fact that it was due to Malcolm selling versus some, like, structural issue with, like, decorating from equities was what got me bullish.
00:02:43.626 - 00:02:51.886, Speaker C: Yeah, that was. That was bullish because it's, the last month has been. Yeah, it's like just a steady, like, DCA.
00:02:51.958 - 00:03:34.200, Speaker A: Yeah, because for the per, for the first, like, you know, week and six days there when we were trading down, I was like, damn. Like, our correlation with equities is broken. What's going on? The market's like kind of screwed. And then like, the Mount Gox headline provided like a really nice explanation for why we were trading down. And now that that is kind of like all out there and it's been front run and we had an impulse down and we have the ETHF literally coming, according to Polymarket, 77% chance next week to start trading, which is pretty crazy. ETH had retraced from the 30% pump it had off the announcement. It had retraced 27% of it.
00:03:34.200 - 00:03:56.076, Speaker A: So like 90% of it. So basically the entire ETH ETF announcement was retraced. And so that's why I was like, and obviously that's because, like, people, you know, are scared of the ethy stuff, like general markets just getting killed. People are like super bearish. It's going to be like, there's no flows. But I'm taking the other side of that. Anyways, I've been talking for a long time.
00:03:56.108 - 00:04:30.906, Speaker C: Let's get, I mean, it retraced in here. It retraced like the whole thing. But ETH pairs versus other crypto assets are still up a ton since then. I, and so it's like a combination of a lot of people selling stuff for ETH. Like, you could literally see in the charts, people selling Sol for ETH. Like Sol was down more than riskier l one s and like da coins and stuff for like a few days there after the ETH. And you can see how people kind of like bucketize that and then, and then, yeah, the mount Gox just brought like overall market down.
00:04:30.906 - 00:05:15.088, Speaker C: And so Eth is like flat USD terms, but it, it's up a lot. Again, like EBTC is like close to 06056 now, which is pretty big. So it's kind of like there's been a suck of overall, like liquidity out and then ETH has suck liquidity out from a bunch of other stuff. Right. So it's been like a double, kind of like a double whammy there, but yeah, like the sole ETF, it definitely, I definitely always thought that, like, Sol, and like, we had this a week ago, we were talking about this, like, what's the next ETF? And I always thought it would be Sol and I mean, this isn't guaranteed to get approved or anything. There's a lot of reasons why it might not be approved.
00:05:15.264 - 00:05:37.634, Speaker A: But so some of the big, just on that exact point. And also, Jason and Jordan, if you have anything to say, just jump in. That exact point that I just posted this, there's a clip of like, Vanex, head of digital research. So everyone, as soon as the headlight comes out, like, all the kind of dot eth people and like, eth Max is being like, doesn't have CmE futures. Like, this is just hopium. And then literally yesterday.
00:05:37.682 - 00:05:41.378, Speaker C: Yeah, first of all, if that's like your first reaction instead of being bullish.
00:05:41.434 - 00:06:02.226, Speaker A: Like, yeah, yeah, it's just kind of cope. Anyways, literally yesterday, Matthew, I think Siegel, I don't know how to say his last name. Head of research on advantage digital assets. Like, really good interview. It's with Scott Malkner. I also butchered that. I posted it on Twitter.
00:06:02.226 - 00:06:37.164, Speaker A: Go watch it. It's really good. He basically said, like, Scott was like, okay, you know, Sol ETF probably not because they don't have CME futures. And then Matthew hit him with one of the all time, actually. And it was, it was a pretty good response. He basically said to satisfy the requirement of, like, the market sufficient size, you need the CME futures. Or there is like this surveillance sharing agreement where Coinbase can share all their data about their sole trades and everything to make sure this market is healthy enough or big enough to handle an ETF.
00:06:37.164 - 00:06:54.810, Speaker A: And they could use that instead of the CME futures. So he had clearly, and then Vanek filed today. So they obviously think that there's a path to approval here. What will be really interesting to see is if Blackrock and the other issuers, like, follow through on this to give it some more, like, this is happening.
00:06:55.150 - 00:07:15.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, a blackrock one would be. Yeah, that would, because people, people don't think Larry can lose. People don't think Larry can lose. So now this is like forcing Larry to, you know, pack, like, get, get it started, right? Yeah, so, yeah, I think, like, Jason.
00:07:15.520 - 00:07:18.464, Speaker A: Or Jordan need to say something. Come on, guys.
00:07:18.592 - 00:07:37.032, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so I was kind of, like, waiting to kind of hear what you were going to say. So, like, yeah, I had very similar thoughts. I mean, obviously, we were talking in DM's over the last, like, couple weeks, Duncan, about like, yo, bitcoin. Just like the most casual walk down of price I've seen in quite some time. Right.
00:07:37.056 - 00:07:40.780, Speaker A: Just like every while sailors like tea whopping 700.
00:07:42.200 - 00:08:24.160, Speaker B: I'm just, like, looking at this awful, right? And, like, what I look for for bottoms, like, local bottoms, long term bottoms, they're almost always marked with, like, some kind of liquidations within the majors, right? And, like, that was one thing that you hadn't seen for, like, two, three weeks on bitcoin, right? Bitcoin just, like, walked down with no real liquidations. You saw everything, like, outside of bitcoin, get absolutely decimated, right? Like, most of my memes are. Downs are, like, 60% or whatever. Duncan's laughing, who's getting. So, like, I was just, like, I was not convinced that we were, like, at a low. I was. I was.
00:08:24.160 - 00:09:10.240, Speaker B: I started buying bitcoin a little bit at 64, but seeing no liquidations, I was like, you know, this low isn't in. But fortunately, or unfortunately for those who got caught a couple days ago, right, when that headline dropped, we got a fat liquidation in bitcoin, one of the largest we've seen all year. And on top of that, on the day, I was like. I think I was tweeting this. I was writing this in the group chats. Like, bitcoin was down 3456, 7%, 8% at the lows, and most of the more desirable altcoins were green on the day. So, I mean, depending on what you consider desired, things like, wif was, like, plus five, 6% on the day, right? I mean, when you compare it to price action over the.
00:09:10.280 - 00:09:13.624, Speaker A: Oh, after going down 80%, 70%.
00:09:13.712 - 00:09:15.728, Speaker B: But, like, it's not. It's not only with.
00:09:15.784 - 00:09:17.336, Speaker A: I think that mean, that's like.
00:09:17.528 - 00:09:26.992, Speaker B: I mean, I literally posted that. But, like, almost every other coin was down plus or -50 plus percent as well. So the point I'm trying to make here is, like, banana.
00:09:27.056 - 00:09:28.536, Speaker A: It was banana down 50%.
00:09:28.608 - 00:09:54.484, Speaker B: Jason, bananas down 15 yet, bro. We were all pumped anyway to stay on topic. To stay on topic, right? The more desirable all coins you can not even look at memes, right? Some of the. Some of the better altcoins were pumping off the lows. Lido was up 15%, I think, right? So, like, you look for divergences in behavior. At least that's what I look for when I'm looking for lows. And, like, a confluence of things.
00:09:54.484 - 00:10:07.198, Speaker B: Like, you get, like, a big liquidation in. In bitcoin, alts aren't doing what they have been doing for the last three weeks. That is, like, if you got that move two weeks ago in bitcoin, alts would have been down, like, 30% on the day, right?
00:10:07.254 - 00:10:10.630, Speaker A: So, like, there's a lack of four sellers, I think. Is that what it tells you?
00:10:10.710 - 00:10:17.734, Speaker B: The sellers might have run out of coins on a lot of these other, you know, charts, right? I mean, they. They won, right a while.
00:10:17.822 - 00:10:41.646, Speaker A: It's completely, like, contrasting what we saw. I don't know. This is maybe March or April. I can't remember everything. This last three months is a blur. But bitcoin was down, like, 4%, and all three dipped, like, literally 30% candles on the day because there's, like, the market was so levered up that bitcoin went down, like, 5% and then just, like, cascade on all results. So I think the market, in terms of leverage is in a much healthier place.
00:10:41.646 - 00:10:47.998, Speaker A: Like, funding is basically reset down to normal levels. All coin open interest is, like, way more healthy.
00:10:48.054 - 00:11:23.646, Speaker B: All these memes have gotten backwardation at the highest points with. With perps and spot markets and a lot of areas. So, like, there's a lot of reasons to believe, like, that was likely to be that local low. And then you have a couple of these other really good things come in, like, you know, spot or Sol ETF, right. ETH ETF narrative is picking up, and you're starting to see price do well with good news, whereas over the last couple of weeks, it's just been getting decimated regardless of what's been happening. So, like, those are the things I look for to see, like, kind of like a shift in markethouse appetite and risk appetite. So, like, I don't know.
00:11:23.646 - 00:11:47.926, Speaker B: And I'm also still heavily in soul. Like, I never really made the switch over to ETH at this point because everything, like, happened so fast with, like, the ETH ETF. It was like, you know, at one point, everybody. My. I can't speak for everybody, but I was thinking the ETH ETF wouldn't have happened until, you know, maybe January of 2025. And then all of a sudden, in the course of, like, 24, 48 hours, that's no longer the case. And it's going to be live within, like, a month or two, most likely.
00:11:47.926 - 00:12:15.202, Speaker B: And, like, that's just, like, such a quick turnaround that, like, I didn't really, like, make the switch, like, position wise. Like, I don't think many other people did. So I guess, like, my question to you is, like, I mean, you did see it a little bit in the charts. Like, ceteris was saying, like. Like, soul eth. Right? But, like, I guess my action to you is, now that you have this narrative, right, and perhaps more time to speculate on it, like, how do you. How do you view this with, like, Eth and soul.
00:12:15.202 - 00:12:26.084, Speaker B: Like, is that the, was that the bottom for soul ethnic? Do you think solit goes on to outperform like it did for the first half of the year? Like, what do you guys kind of, kind of think about that and then. Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:26.212 - 00:13:16.266, Speaker A: Okay, so let's just, let's just talk about the Eth for a minute before we start infighting amongst ourselves on east soul. Let's just talk about our general bullish catalyst. So everyone, like, literally at like two, the past three days, like, people are dancing on each grave in terms of, like, saying how bearish it is. The ETTF is getting a no flow, is this is like, EtH is expensive. It has all these competitors. It's no narrative, just straight up silly. And the big reasons for that is that, like, why I thought it was kind of like a bad take and literally just like, marked the sentiment bottom because, like, not only had ETH retraced 90% of the announcement pump, but, like, you had all these, like, threads coming out on, like, you know why ETH can get no flows, but you have to think about the incentives of, like, the people selling these products.
00:13:16.266 - 00:13:29.110, Speaker A: Like, Blackrock is already making almost $50 million a year annualized off their ibid product in revenue. And that's after the first six months of trading. It was literally their most successful product launch ever.
00:13:29.770 - 00:13:32.450, Speaker C: Yeah, but they're not making, they're not like profiting off that one.
00:13:32.490 - 00:13:51.298, Speaker A: Okay. 50 million in revenue. They're probably splitting some of the coinbase, but it's basically a big, a big business line for them. You know that like, bitcoin, ETF in itself, if it keeps growing, how it has even in this, like, smaller period, and bitcoin, like, does decently will be literally like multi billion dollars of fees over the next, like, couple.
00:13:51.354 - 00:14:11.330, Speaker C: Yeah, but I don't even think, and I think this goes into the bullishness of having other ETF's. I think Blackrock is not going to make money off the bitcoin one, but the fact that they're going to be the biggest, most liquid bitcoin one, they'll have all these other ones and those are the ones that they'll be able to take fees off of, especially when you add staking in because that's the easiest way.
00:14:11.750 - 00:15:07.280, Speaker A: So if you just look at the headline numbers, it's literally billions in revenue, whatever their split is with coinbase, all this stuff, I don't know, but it's billions in revenue just like, on these headline numbers. And they made like a big push on it, then you have, like, to think that they're not going to do the exact same thing with the ETH is just silly because it's a massive revenue opportunity for them to, as ceteris just said, just also mix in staking. So they charge the 25 basis points base fee and then staking yield on ETH. Right now, like three, 4%, you clip another ten or 20% there, you're up to 50 70 bps, which is three times more profitable than the or three times higher fee than the Blackrock one. And ETH is like a third of the size of bitcoin. So it's literally going to be just as big of a fee generation product as the bitcoin ETF. And these people they're selling them to, like, nobody knows what bitcoin is, barely.
00:15:07.280 - 00:15:38.072, Speaker A: And to think they know what ETH is and be like, hmm, you know, I'm not going to buy any ETH because you have, like, all these competitors coming out. It's like they're going to be shoving this down their throats, and Larry's going to start launching rwas on chain. Just be like, this is the decentralized financial ledger of the world. You know, stable coins are taking off on Ethan. Vanek is talking like they're doing. Vanek's like, the head of an ex son is doing Agora, which is, like, going to be a USDC competitor. They're talking about ETH as, like, the open app store.
00:15:38.072 - 00:16:07.004, Speaker A: It's like there is so many narratives that they could push. And the beauty about ETH is that, like, when Kang tweets all this things trading at a 200 x price to sales over the past few years is the reflexivity here. So, like, if you get this narrative build up, they're selling this product, oh, you should be allocated, like, diversified to crypto. 70% bitcoin, 30% ETH, whatever it is. You get some flows east, a much smaller asset, easier to move. You get some flows in east starts going up. All of a sudden, defi protocols are launching.
00:16:07.004 - 00:16:41.264, Speaker A: They're putting yield on the TVL in the space is growing. You know, fees are growing. And the Matt Siegel guy, I need to figure out how to pronounce his name from Vanek, literally said that they're waving the first 1.5 their fees on their ETTF for the first 1.5 billion in assets, and they're going to put their own money in, and they're like, we're planning on making it up on ETH price appreciation from this reflexive cycle of ETH going up, TvL going up, fees going up, new tokens, launching more yield. What we saw in 2021, that really kicks it off. So massive rant.
00:16:41.264 - 00:17:03.944, Speaker A: But to think that the flows are going to be zero is just like. You're literally betting against Blackrock and Bannock. You think that I is going to like, oh, actually 200 x price to sell. They got an army. No one knows what this shit is. They're just going to be selling it. And they can start up the narrative, like, literally price, like, narrative follows price.
00:17:03.944 - 00:17:17.784, Speaker A: We get some good flows. All of a sudden we start talking about RWAs, open app store, all this stuff. You have this reflexive thing happening. The fundamentals literally improve as the price is going up because, like, gas fees jump the berm gums, more me, more staking yield.
00:17:17.832 - 00:17:19.300, Speaker C: Okay, you've been ranting enough.
00:17:20.360 - 00:17:41.602, Speaker D: People did this. People did the same thing with bitcoin ETF, though. Like, people were, you had a lot of these tinfoil hat threads. Like, all the bitcoin ETF is bearish because flows are going to be underwhelming. It's a way to centralize the network, and it's not going to be censorship resistant store value anymore. All of that was B's. All of that was ridiculous.
00:17:41.602 - 00:18:09.418, Speaker D: And the bitcoin ETF was super bullish, and it's going to be the same thing with the ETF. And I feel like a lot of the sentiment over the past couple weeks has been kind of a psyop. Like, when you look at, like, the ability to buy ETH and these other majors at the price from a few months ago when we thought, like, Israel and Iran were going to start, like, world War three and we were nowhere near another ETH ETF. And now, like, you could, you could buy all of these tokens at the same price.
00:18:09.514 - 00:18:11.178, Speaker A: When we had an ETF, even lower.
00:18:11.234 - 00:18:15.714, Speaker D: No longer have world War three, like, it doesn't get much easier than that.
00:18:15.882 - 00:18:16.306, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:16.378 - 00:18:42.650, Speaker A: And so the big thing. Great point. So the BTC ETF on approval, like, traded down 20% after because there's this massive, like, JBDC overhang. And I think that's what the market. But now that's like, so known that that's going to happen. And, like, the CEO of Bracedale got fired because that was a fucking disaster. And so there's a bunch of threads on, like, okay, why the ethiopian overhang is, like, less severe on ETH than the BTC one, I don't really know.
00:18:42.650 - 00:18:55.050, Speaker A: I would have to assume that the reason that guy got fired was because it was such a frickin disaster. And maybe they're not going to keep their fees seven times higher than everyone else on this.
00:18:56.590 - 00:18:57.926, Speaker D: Almost zero at first.
00:18:58.038 - 00:19:33.796, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. If they do that for the ETH, then I think that'll help stem the outflows. You also just have, you know, you know, this could be complete cope. But like, I've read that like, a lot more people are putting on the GBDC trade than the Ethi trade. Like, all these bankruptcy states have a lot more GBDC than they did Ethi relative to market captain, who really knows? But the whole point is like, bitcoin ran from 25,000 when Blackrock first announced it to 57,000, right. The ETF on this approval has like retraced its entire pump. I think it's like very much priced in that, you know, there's going to be terrible.
00:19:33.828 - 00:20:03.628, Speaker C: People aren't. I mean, people aren't. I mean, if guinea from Wintermute had that tweet today about how he thinks that the, first of all, he thinks the sole ETF is not getting approved in the next six months, and he also thinks that the ETF flows are going to be pretty disappointing. And then he thinks by that, like, then the sole ETF flows would be disappointing too. So I agree with all the reflexivity stuff, but there's, I, when people say.
00:20:03.684 - 00:20:15.598, Speaker B: Disappointing for flows, do they ever really, did he put a number? Do people put numbers? Or do they just say disappointing? Okay, so like, they just have memes of point.
00:20:15.654 - 00:20:33.406, Speaker A: The market is so, is to make the market go up or down. It's like, what is the, what do currently people think is gonna happen versus what actually happens? And I think that things are like, people think it's gonna be such a fucking flop that even if it's like mildly successful, we would go up.
00:20:33.518 - 00:21:17.086, Speaker B: So according to the Bloomberg boys like Eric Balchunis and James Seifert, I think they had their estimates at the ETH. ETF would get about ten to 15% of the bitcoin ETF in terms of flows, net flows. So bitcoin, ETF, net flows, I think they're about like 15 billion, right? Um, and I would say there's probably a couple billion of that, which is not really like net flows. It's probably offset by like a basis trade. So like, just say, just say conservatively, there's like 12 billion of net flows year to date. So, like that would be okay. ETH would get 1.2
00:21:17.086 - 00:21:37.642, Speaker B: to 1.5 billion of flows through six months. So like, is that a good number? Like, I see this is, like. That's the way I'm looking at it. Is that better than what people are expecting? Like, I'm not sure. That's the only number that I've seen anybody float around like that. Ten to 15% of bitcoin flows from any, like, reputable.
00:21:37.746 - 00:21:44.146, Speaker A: Yeah. Vaneck said 15 billion over the first year for ETH and net flows.
00:21:44.258 - 00:21:50.674, Speaker B: So that'd be, what? If bitcoin does the same rate it's done from now, that'd be about 50% of bitcoins flows.
00:21:50.842 - 00:22:36.476, Speaker A: I think, like, how the math works out is I need to pull up the wisdom tree thing, but basically, like, a corridor. It's basically just market cap, the same as bitcoin if it's on its continued pace, but just, like, at a third of the market cap is what Vanek said. I think that another thing that people could be underpricing. I don't know if they've had the time to kind of, like, make these agreements, but it's just, like, the. I think it's much easier to kind of convince ETh whales to put this in the ETH ETF versus convincing, like, bitcoin whales to put it in the bitcoin ETF. So I think there could be, like, definitely, you know, some. Some deals in the back room where it's like, hey, like, put, like, you know, a billion dollars worth of ETh in our ETF to, like, help us get it off the ground.
00:22:36.668 - 00:22:38.524, Speaker B: Oh, you're going to people that.
00:22:38.572 - 00:22:39.060, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:39.180 - 00:22:39.700, Speaker B: Okay.
00:22:39.780 - 00:23:18.496, Speaker A: So it's not actually necessarily net, like, new money in, but just, like, the back to this reflexivity. Like, you see these massive flows in and, like, that almost a self fulfilling prophecy. I think that that's way more likely than it, like, I know there is those dealings when the bitcoin ETF first came out, like, trying to, like, you know, wine and dime bitcoin whales, like, put in. Put in some flows originally into the bitcoin ETF. But I just think the whole. The whole cohort of, like, eth eth people is, like, much more open to doing something like that, where it's like, hey, like, vanak, we're gonna, you know, go get, like, a billion dollars worth of eth whales to, like, put in into our ETF. Like, we're waiving the fee for the first billion dollars.
00:23:18.496 - 00:23:32.120, Speaker A: It costs you nothing. It's just, like, good for Ethan and our marketing Martin, like, maybe give them some dealer, build that relationship. I think that's pretty likely as well, which could just get the market more fired up and start this reflexive cycle.
00:23:32.280 - 00:24:05.824, Speaker C: Maybe you'll, so like, these whales won't, like, they can't stake it, right? So I, maybe it's like a bit harder sell for some people. It depends. If, I don't know, a lot of people with like old eth bags might not stake it because they don't want to homestake and then they don't want to use LST because then that's probably taxable. So it's possible that they can kind of seed it a bit like this. I think though, the BTC TF is still not being sold by like rias, like pitched by like Ras and a lot of these other institutional investors. Right.
00:24:05.872 - 00:24:31.754, Speaker A: It's a slow, it's a slow churn like that. I think the biggest risk here is us being like, quote unquote early to this in terms of like, it just takes a long time for the wheels to get moving in these big corporations, especially with this surprise approval by eat. But I just think that like the expectations are so bad that, you know, anything that's not really bad, like anything that's like mildly positive will make.
00:24:31.882 - 00:24:38.280, Speaker C: I don't think the expectations are as bad as you, as you. I don't think CT is a great representation of.
00:24:38.370 - 00:24:42.652, Speaker A: I know what the price action is. Like, we literally had the announcement pump and retrace 90%.
00:24:42.676 - 00:24:46.356, Speaker C: We already went over why we already went over the price action is mount Gox.
00:24:46.548 - 00:24:49.276, Speaker A: No, no, for the ETH specifically like.
00:24:49.308 - 00:24:52.228, Speaker C: Yeah, but ETh goes down when bitcoin goes down. That's how it works.
00:24:52.404 - 00:24:54.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I know that's how it works, but I think that.
00:24:55.220 - 00:24:57.760, Speaker D: Do you still think sole EtH has bottom?
00:24:58.060 - 00:24:58.564, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:58.652 - 00:24:59.780, Speaker C: Oh, no, it went to what?
00:24:59.820 - 00:25:01.520, Speaker A: Likerock follow through?
00:25:01.820 - 00:25:34.814, Speaker C: It went to. Well, I go, I don't know. I mean, on the last pod I said I thought ETH would probably, I own more soul, but I thought he would probably outperform for the like midterm. I don't actually know anymore. I feel about that. I just like own both. And I think a lot of people just get kind of like wrecked trying to constantly chase like, if you like the ETF thing, a lot of that happened like very quick.
00:25:34.814 - 00:26:03.262, Speaker C: Right. And so there's definitely, I just, you just know there's people out there who like did not believe the soul rally for a long time and then bought it at like that live sole ETH and then like, ETF goes approved and then, so now they're dumping all their soul bags back and now this happens and it's. And it's like, what do I do now? Right? So, yeah, I don't know. Like, medium term stuff. Hard to predict, but I still. I still think sole leaf goes higher, like, over the next few years. Right.
00:26:03.262 - 00:26:24.716, Speaker C: So that's, like, why I didn't reposition a ton into ETh, even though I thought it would, like, outperform. Just because you never know. There's so many unknowns, and it's like, not even the ETF. This stuff Solana's released recently, this week has also been pretty cool. Like, these blanks thing. Yeah. These blinks things are, if they work, they could really reshape the fabric of society.
00:26:24.828 - 00:26:26.920, Speaker A: Great. Great way to get fished.
00:26:27.460 - 00:26:56.264, Speaker C: Sure. Why does everybody, like, always do all these people who come up with the worst case of stuff all. There's just insane. It's insane how many people are just hoping all the time about everything. Like, everything that improves UX is probably going to be a bit of a security risk. Like, that's kind of the trade off you're making a lot of the time, for sure. So, I mean, what's your point? I guess that's like, what's your point? You're just.
00:26:56.392 - 00:26:57.688, Speaker A: I was just repeating.
00:26:57.744 - 00:27:05.664, Speaker C: No, not you. Like, people who are, like, who bring that up, like, right away. Right. It's like, what point you trying to make? Like, yes. Risk.
00:27:05.752 - 00:27:06.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:06.960 - 00:27:10.688, Speaker C: Apes have already lost their entire collection five times over.
00:27:10.824 - 00:27:13.968, Speaker A: People like to be negative on that stuff.
00:27:14.144 - 00:27:14.616, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:14.688 - 00:27:16.940, Speaker A: Especially if they have a theory in bags.
00:27:17.330 - 00:27:29.510, Speaker B: Jordan, what do you think about Sol eth? Do you think sole ETH has bottomed? Do you think Eth goes on to outperform? I mean, next six months, or I'll give you, like, okay, three year end, and then, like, I guess longer.
00:27:29.890 - 00:28:15.750, Speaker D: I'd like to see some more filings, but I do think there's this potential, like, set up here where, like, okay, you have blast airdrop just happened. So there's, like, $2 billion tpl there. There's, like, people are really getting tired of getting layer shenanigans. So there's just, like, billions of dollars in ethico that could totally, like, go over to solve for another, like, sort of mania meme season or whatever. If we get a lot of more filings here with, like, quick succession, and then that momentum, it could get pretty crazy again over there. So I don't know. But then again, you have, like, the eth coming, like, next week, and then that's, like, a very consistent tailwind over the next several months.
00:28:15.750 - 00:28:28.054, Speaker D: So I don't I don't have, like, a strong opinion. I've never traded. I've never traded trades on these inner crypto pairs. I just think that's it. Like, I'm. I'm not a ta guru. I'm here because I believe in the tech and our mission.
00:28:28.054 - 00:28:40.640, Speaker D: And it's like, imagine being on the right side of history and coming into crypto and having, like, 90% of your network in these assets and then, like, losing money because. Because you've shorted one in favor of the other.
00:28:40.680 - 00:29:34.458, Speaker C: Like, it's not going to be me. Yeah. I think, like, a main takeaway here is that we're talking about these assets because there are very few, like, investable assets in this space. And so people, like, debating sold versus ETH because they're actually two things people want to buy. And so I do think that this distrusion thing that we talk about all the time, like, I don't know when that's going to, like, go the other way. Like, I can definitely see, like, BTC ESOL just continuing, and people will, like, argue on Twitter about the ratios between these three, but you can kind of just see a scenario where this is a lot of, it's, like, brain dead simple, right? Like, the. You can just take someone off the street who will just buy, like, BTC soul and go about their life and be, like, an electrician, and they'll probably outperform, like, a ton of people on CT.
00:29:34.458 - 00:29:49.550, Speaker C: Right. That's kind of my, that's, like, the index of the industry, I think. Like, if you were to create an index, why would you include any other assets besides those three right now and just, like, market cap weight them, right, Anton? No.
00:29:52.690 - 00:30:21.444, Speaker B: No, I kind of agree. I do like to trade, but, like, I. I think it's kind of foolish to try to just, like, pick a winner even between, like, ethan. So, like, they'll probably both win. Like, the market is big enough for both of these things to coexist and win in. In any meaningful timeframe. So, like, like, it just, like, yeah, just own, like, just own everything and be happy.
00:30:21.444 - 00:30:26.710, Speaker B: I mean, own both. Like, you can own multiple things and not be, like, you could, you know.
00:30:26.750 - 00:30:33.290, Speaker D: Like, may not be big enough for tan to two x, though. I don't know about that.
00:30:33.990 - 00:30:34.518, Speaker A: All right.
00:30:34.574 - 00:30:36.534, Speaker C: I don't know. You want to talk about.
00:30:36.582 - 00:30:41.050, Speaker A: Do you want to talk about ton or. I want to say an interesting thing that I came across today.
00:30:41.550 - 00:30:43.810, Speaker C: Okay, sounds interesting. Go for it.
00:30:44.630 - 00:31:15.790, Speaker A: So. And this is also. Scott and Matthew talked about this on that post, on that podcast. So bitcoin I guess last month is down 9% and like an ETF, a basket of these bitcoin miners was up 21% during that same time. And so usually when bitcoin goes down 10% these miners get slaughtered. They're basically like alts. But why the miners were up is because of this whole data center AI stuff which is kind of cool.
00:31:15.790 - 00:32:02.636, Speaker A: So apparently like Microsoft and like, you know, all these big tech companies that come and train AI are going to these miners that have like gig of power. So I think Microsoft has like 5000 mw operational and like some of these miners have like, you know, that or more. For instance, the one that I know about is galaxy. Like they acquired like helios during the bear market. Some miner in Texas that has between 200 megawatt facility, up to an 800 megawatt facility. So that one mining facility which I don't even think is that big versus some of the other ones has 20% of the pattern that Microsoft has to train their AI models. And that's just an interesting thing.
00:32:02.636 - 00:32:11.212, Speaker A: I thought these bitcoin miners pivoting to AI are renting out some of their data or some their power to AI.
00:32:11.356 - 00:33:05.016, Speaker C: Yeah, that's pretty big. I mean everyone who complained about like bitcoin's energy usage, I mean start getting, your, start getting ready, sharpen your pencils because the AI thing is going to be an order of magnitude bigger, right? Yeah, I mean, I mean even Nvidia had like a lot of their revenue was from like crypto miners a few years ago, right? And they actually got, they actually got sued recently for securities fraud for under Nvidia did by a class action, which is hilarious because their stock is up a kajillion percent because they underplayed the amount that their revenue was dependent on like Ethereum miners. So yeah, I mean, yeah, we don't have to talk about AI though. I don't think where we can AI.
00:33:05.088 - 00:33:30.162, Speaker A: I just thought it was cool. Yeah, I know our AI people aren't on here but. Okay, so marathon Digital claims to have 760 mining capacity at its disposal. That's like, that's like some serious wattage. But I just thought that was cool. It's kind of like a subsector to crypto. Oh, another interesting point on the ETTF that I think I saw it from Quinn Thompson.
00:33:30.162 - 00:33:55.560, Speaker A: He is like a fund manager in the space. Really smart guy. He said that leading up to the BTC ETF, there's a ton of proxies for bitcoin price appreciation in terms of traditional equities. So you had like microstrategy, which is kind of like a quasi ETF. You had the miners, which are kind of beta to bitcoin. And ETh doesn't really have that other than I think he said like maybe Coinbase, which I guess I. So that was a big worry.
00:33:55.560 - 00:34:31.660, Speaker A: I think like part of the bear fud going into bitcoin ETF is like, you know, anyone who wanted to be allocator already has just bought MSTR or these bitcoin miners and like nail, like the bitcoin ETF. And it's just kind of dividing the flows between everything. I thought that was a really good point. There's no real proxy for ETh other than Ethi, but, you know, there's the problems with it being on the OTC desk and stuff for ETH. So, you know, another kind of point in the bull camp that I haven't heard anyone except for him say. That just came to mind just on the crypto equities talk.
00:34:32.120 - 00:34:35.568, Speaker C: Yeah. So do you want to, I mean, I don't know.
00:34:35.584 - 00:34:58.230, Speaker B: You've been asking, do you want to talk about ton? Because I know you were quite bullish on Twitter about Tan as well. A few weeks, was it maybe a week or two ago you wrote that thread. And given the new changes with the market and souls ETF filing, have you changed?
00:34:58.270 - 00:35:03.090, Speaker A: Are you still bullish internally? I made a bet with someone yesterday.
00:35:03.830 - 00:35:04.646, Speaker B: Great timing.
00:35:04.718 - 00:35:07.170, Speaker C: Bad, terrible timing. There's no way you're winning that.
00:35:07.670 - 00:35:31.420, Speaker A: The day before the Sol ETF gets filed for, I was like, I bet you over the next twelve months, outperformed soul, which I wasn't feeling like super confident in, but this is like, he was being really annoying. So I said, let's bet on it instead of arguing about this. And then this idea gets filed for today. So instantly underwater on that, but a lot of time to go.
00:35:31.760 - 00:35:47.850, Speaker C: I mean, so I can see being like, I can see being bullish on like trying stuff out on time. Maybe there's like very small market cap stuff that launches, but like tan itself is close to 40 bill fully diluted. It's like half a soul. So maybe like make the case.
00:35:48.350 - 00:35:48.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:48.918 - 00:35:49.982, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah.
00:35:50.126 - 00:36:00.566, Speaker A: Let's talk about, you know, be throwing ftds in here over the next twelve months. That's not coming to the market. So we can just kind of take that out. What's the, what's the market cap?
00:36:00.598 - 00:36:04.622, Speaker C: Aren't you the king of like high ftvs?
00:36:04.806 - 00:36:08.514, Speaker A: Yeah. You're saying visa meme when they're unlocking.
00:36:08.642 - 00:36:15.110, Speaker C: Not unlocking doesn't matter. A lot of these tokens haven't had any unlocks yet, and they're all down, like 80%.
00:36:15.490 - 00:36:27.386, Speaker A: It does, it does matter. They've already churned through a lot of the supply on secondaries. Okay, so it's 19 billion right now sold, 70 in terms of market circulating cap. Yeah, circulating. So it's one fourth of Seoul. Why?
00:36:27.578 - 00:36:30.578, Speaker C: And really, you're really rounding these percentages.
00:36:30.714 - 00:37:13.038, Speaker A: And, like, one 20th of Ethereum. So why I think Tan is interesting is because, so telegram itself has 800 million users. Big number. That's like order of magnitude, you know, with, like, WeChat and imessenger, or maybe not imessenger, but, like, WeChat and Facebook messenger, that WhatsApp, that sort of thing. And they have basically, like, have some exclusive partnership. I don't know the exact terms of the deal, but with the tan foundation to essentially integrate ton like into telegram. So anyone who doesn't have a us phone number can go on Telegram.
00:37:13.038 - 00:37:45.372, Speaker A: And even if you do have a us phone number, you can. But, like, they might block it. You can just search up wallet at wallet on Telegram, and it'll bring up a crypto wallet to you that's, like, connected to your account. So that's essentially you've just given, you know, let's say 800 million people a crypto wallet already installed on their phone that, you know, a lot of them don't even know about. That is literally, like, two orders of magnitude more users than ETH and Solana. I think Solana has, like, a million users. ETH might have 4 million, talking about 800 million.
00:37:45.372 - 00:37:48.756, Speaker A: So do you want to refute that, Ceteris, is that correct?
00:37:48.788 - 00:37:58.980, Speaker C: I'm pretty sure. I mean, I don't know. Off the top of my head, I agree that, yes, Telegram has a lot of people that use their messaging app. The idea that they're going to play clicking games of hamsters.
00:37:59.060 - 00:38:06.720, Speaker A: Okay, see, this is, this is the cope where it's like, oh, Solana, it's like, this is just, like, the start.
00:38:06.840 - 00:38:21.060, Speaker C: You can't just, like, point I the hamster. I don't care about that. It's the fact that it's actually very hard to develop on. They have their own virtual machine, and so it's actually quite hard to get developers. If so, if they were like, EVM.
00:38:22.800 - 00:38:30.130, Speaker A: Doesn'T that sound like what we were talking about, like, three years ago about Solana? Like, oh, like, it's not EVM. All the crypto projects are on EVM.
00:38:30.240 - 00:38:37.478, Speaker C: No, no, no. Because it's like, SVM was good. It just didn't have devs, like, telegram. VM is actually just bad.
00:38:37.654 - 00:38:39.398, Speaker A: Yeah, but they can make that better.
00:38:39.494 - 00:38:41.678, Speaker C: I feel like, sure they have a lot of money.
00:38:41.854 - 00:39:02.720, Speaker D: Jet on Jetton's. Like, it's just, it. No, like, I don't. And first of all, I think that the whole hamster thing, the hamster like, shade, I think that's, like, kind of valid, right? Like, have you seen, have you seen the tweet of, like, the sewing machine where the little thing is, like, tapping on the hamster? Like, that's, like the best app on Telegram right now.
00:39:03.940 - 00:39:08.116, Speaker A: What's the best app on soul three years ago or two years ago?
00:39:08.228 - 00:39:13.732, Speaker D: But the thing on sauna is, like, at least you have, like, Dexs and, like, like, uni V two forks and stuff.
00:39:13.756 - 00:39:13.892, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:13.916 - 00:39:22.680, Speaker A: It's not like they're gonna build, like, they have Dexes too. Like, this is all just, like, co, this isn't like, the only real thing that, like, you guys have said.
00:39:24.620 - 00:39:46.360, Speaker C: No, Dunkin. This is what you don't get is that I don't think you realize how, like, smart a lot of the Solana engineers are that have, like, kind of made Solana happen. And you think that telegram can just improve the tech. Like, it can just get better just because they, because it's early, right? Like, maybe if they're not, like, they.
00:39:46.440 - 00:39:49.984, Speaker A: Built one of the most successful messaging apps in the world with 30 people.
00:39:50.072 - 00:39:51.456, Speaker C: I thought these are separate entities.
00:39:51.528 - 00:40:13.102, Speaker A: Telegram and taunt are different. I. But they're, like, there's obviously partnership. They're working together. The telegram people who are just like, Giga, Chad Devs, who've built this app, aren't just going to partner with complete idiots. Like, obviously, I've heard from, like, reputable people and, like, tan is like, a sharding chain. Like, people who cover sharding that right now, telegram's a bit of a mess.
00:40:13.102 - 00:40:27.184, Speaker A: That doesn't mean that, you know, over the next few years, they can't fix it. And, like, the. Since they have an 800 x head start on potential users over Solana gives them, you know, some time to figure things out.
00:40:27.232 - 00:40:45.200, Speaker C: Yeah. So listen, I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying, but it's like, personally, at the end of the day, the price matters. And it's, like, hard to wrap my head around, like, 40 billion for time. It's like, what kind of, like, I do agree with you that they could be. They have a lot of users, and it's like, we.
00:40:45.240 - 00:40:48.980, Speaker A: But Jason can wrap his head around 20 billion for dogecoin.
00:40:51.010 - 00:40:59.962, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've, like, some of your guys on market caps or, or things like that, or dunkin. You can't get caps.
00:40:59.986 - 00:41:07.490, Speaker A: And some of your arguments are just so contradictory to each other. You're clowning for the. Explain what the hamster is, Duncan.
00:41:07.530 - 00:41:17.270, Speaker C: No, Duncan. But wait, you don't. You don't compare an l one to a meme coin. You compare meme coins to me. To me to compare l ones to l ones. Right? This is how it works.
00:41:17.350 - 00:41:30.134, Speaker A: Talking about how much these assets can be worth. And you're talking about a meme that's worth that. Whatever. What's doge right now? 10 billion? And then you're saying, oh, this thing with 800 million potential users is expensive.
00:41:30.302 - 00:41:33.170, Speaker C: I mean, why did I say doge was, like, cheap?
00:41:33.590 - 00:41:35.182, Speaker A: I know. I'm just saying, like, that.
00:41:35.206 - 00:41:44.408, Speaker C: Is that doge for everything card? Like, that's. But there's so many assets in crypto that are effectively worthless, that are worth a lot.
00:41:44.584 - 00:41:52.008, Speaker A: I know, but I just think that it's not really worth. It's not like, tan isn't really that expensive when you look at the market. Okay.
00:41:52.024 - 00:42:09.400, Speaker D: But I also think. I think. I think the distribution argument is, like, it's intriguing. Okay. But I also think, like, active users, there's, like, levels. There's, like, levels to the active users thing, right? So say telegram has, like, 800 million active users. How many does Coinbase have? Coinbase has, like, what, like 100.
00:42:09.400 - 00:42:14.332, Speaker D: Like 20 million or something. So it's like, all right, like, Coinbase is 120 million.
00:42:14.476 - 00:42:15.484, Speaker A: I'm looking at it.
00:42:15.612 - 00:42:40.332, Speaker D: Desire to use crypto, but, like, can't really. Versus, like, Tesla users that are just, like, like, whatever, doing, like, they're not gonna, like, make that leap no matter how easy it is. And, like, there's not even anything to do, like, coin, like, base chain is, like, so much more. Yeah, sure. Like, there's an order of magnitude, like, less than telegram, but there's still an order of magnitude more than status quo. And it's have way bigger of an impact on, like, crypto.
00:42:40.436 - 00:42:43.832, Speaker A: Coinbase is 8 million monthly. I could. Users, buddy.
00:42:43.976 - 00:42:45.912, Speaker D: Okay, it's 120 million.
00:42:46.056 - 00:42:46.496, Speaker A: Don't.
00:42:46.568 - 00:42:48.352, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they have, like, 110 million.
00:42:48.416 - 00:42:58.192, Speaker A: Don't hit me with that. We got a hundred x. Okay, so to your gut points, the tech is not great. Apparently. I've used the chain. It's kind of slow. I'll agree with that.
00:42:58.192 - 00:43:27.896, Speaker A: That's the one point I'll concede everything else you guys have said, I disagree with. They're just like a few years behind everyone else on building out the ecosystem. They have a partnership with Tether where you can literally go in and send tether. Like, you don't even have to deal with gas or any of that shit. You just deposit tether and you can send it for free. This gave 800 million people a us dollar bank account, saving tether pay and tether, all this stuff. And, like, we're all from North America, you know, our country's currency and inflation and government on a relative basis is pretty good versus a lot of where telegram users are.
00:43:27.896 - 00:43:53.140, Speaker A: But think about all these, like, you know, bad currencies where the majority of telegram users are in, and now they just have like, a us dollar bank account on their phone that take a mass. That's more than anything any other crypto project, maybe, other than bitcoin, has done for anyone by, like, another order of magnitude. That's more than eats done for anyone. That's more than Solana's done for anyone. And actually helping people provide a real use case, that is just a fact.
00:43:54.320 - 00:44:47.110, Speaker B: I mean, for what it's worth, I'm not as bearish as I think as maybe the other guys. It's hard to deny that tan has had. I mean, all right, so, like, when I look to trade or invest in, like, a bull cycle, right? Like, I don't really care about the fundamentals, right. I kind of look, I kind of. If that hasn't been clear so far over the last eight months or whatever, I kind of look at what the market tells me it likes, right? And that's, like, pretty easy to do. You just look at relative performance over different timeframes across multiple assets and sectors, and it's kind of hard to ignore that tawn has been extremely strong while everything else has been extremely not strong. So, like, from.
00:44:47.110 - 00:45:20.234, Speaker B: From a perspective that. From the perspectives that I care about on the timeframes, I care about, right? If I'm looking, if I think, okay, that was a local low, that was a local low on bitcoin, and I think we might go back to range highs over the next couple of weeks, and then maybe, who knows? We eventually get a breakout, right? Like, what? Coins will outperform if that happens, right? Okay. The only way I know how to answer that question is to look at relative performance, right. Coins that did best while everything else, while the market was kind of shitty, is probably a good place.
00:45:20.282 - 00:45:20.706, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:20.818 - 00:46:14.078, Speaker B: Literally didn't draw from coins that have bounced hardest off of the lows most recently, in the last couple days is probably another good place to look. Right? So, like, from the perspectives that, like, I and I know a fair amount of other people in the markets, right. Because the market is made up of a bunch of people like ceteris, myself, Jordan, and Duncan, people that care about the actual tech, the fundamentals underlying it, how actually easy it would be to replicate some kind of Solana tech with telegram, all of that stuff. I don't really have that strong of an opinion there. So it's multiple opinions and multiple approaches is what makes the market. It's hard to ignore the strength. So if I'm looking at over the next six months, I don't know if tan outperforms soul or outperforms eth, right? Given they have some actual narrative and ETF and, you know, decent fundamentals backing them from.
00:46:14.078 - 00:46:22.370, Speaker B: From different views. But I do know that Tom will probably outperform a lot of the other coins that it's comparable to.
00:46:22.710 - 00:46:29.806, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, himself in the mirror, the market is wrong. The market. You're not wrong.
00:46:29.838 - 00:46:34.244, Speaker B: The market's wrong. Right. So, like, I. I can see ton.
00:46:34.292 - 00:46:36.796, Speaker C: I agree with everything Jason saying. It's just. I don't.
00:46:36.828 - 00:46:37.796, Speaker A: You're dod eating.
00:46:37.908 - 00:46:38.812, Speaker C: I don't buy.
00:46:38.956 - 00:46:39.308, Speaker D: No.
00:46:39.364 - 00:46:44.060, Speaker B: Butters doesn't buy and invest the same way I do. Right. Yeah, like, that's exactly it.
00:46:44.220 - 00:46:45.220, Speaker C: I'm not gonna.
00:46:45.380 - 00:46:59.750, Speaker D: I just think that the narrative feels a little manufactured right now. It's a little. It's a little forced. It's like, think about it. If you look, if you bought tan. If I bought tan today and it went down 50%, like, I would hate that. If I.
00:46:59.750 - 00:47:11.574, Speaker D: If I had buy soul and it went down 50%, I'd buy more. I'd take out a loan against my kidney and I'd buy more. I like it. But I would feel so stupid. I would hate myself.
00:47:11.702 - 00:47:21.710, Speaker A: Okay. That is that. I actually generally like that rule. And that's what I tell Jason about all his stupid memes he talks about. But why do I think that there's.
00:47:21.750 - 00:47:25.048, Speaker B: Even on the episode, bro, I think that they're the.
00:47:25.134 - 00:47:28.372, Speaker A: Is like, a fundamental argument for time.
00:47:28.436 - 00:47:31.492, Speaker C: We're like, I do agree with you. There is a fundamental.
00:47:31.596 - 00:47:36.480, Speaker A: You wouldn't feel stupid if, like, that's just like, I don't think.
00:47:37.060 - 00:47:47.372, Speaker C: Listen, what is. What are the best, like, what is the best way to get actual normal people using crypto applications? I think telegram is.
00:47:47.436 - 00:48:27.380, Speaker A: Is exporting freedom to the world through the us dollar. No, but seriously, seriously, like, USDT to all these people with these shitty, like, currencies is. Is actually probably the single most helpful thing that crypto can do for people right now. Right? You give these people us dollars to save and pay and send to their friends with and allow them to escape their currencies that are inflating at a way higher. And then you slowly red pill them into bitcoin. Like, it's literally done so much more like, what is salon for anyone? Fucking nothing. Nothing.
00:48:27.380 - 00:48:32.680, Speaker A: What is ethereum done for anyone? Nothing. It's starting a. Starting a revolution.
00:48:33.460 - 00:48:39.812, Speaker D: But, like, that's how etherium started. That's how ethereum defi started, was all these argentinian, like, that's maker Dao is.
00:48:39.836 - 00:48:53.970, Speaker A: Okay, I know, but it's like a few million people. We're talking about nearly a billion people. We're talking about 10% of the world's population here. I'm saying on a relative basis, they've done nothing relative to what time could do in, I would say, the next year or two.
00:48:54.050 - 00:49:00.082, Speaker C: Okay. Do we believe they actually have, like, a billion users? I don't know anybody that uses telegram.
00:49:00.106 - 00:49:07.950, Speaker A: Yeah, because it's not in North America. Everyone talk. Talk to people who aren't north american. They're like, of course I have telegram.
00:49:08.250 - 00:49:11.178, Speaker B: It's very. That is, that is, yeah, listen, I.
00:49:11.194 - 00:49:15.928, Speaker A: Think that that's why everyone's fading it and that's why it such a good opportunity, because all of the burgers are.
00:49:15.944 - 00:49:42.680, Speaker C: Like, I agree with. I understand why you're saying, I agree with a lot of it. I think, like, yeah, they have a good shot at onboarding a lot of people. What about, like, near made this wallet recently that is like you can use in telegram. Right? And you talked about had them having this exclusive partnership thing. I don't know how true that. It's like the sniping bots all use telegram too.
00:49:42.680 - 00:49:57.340, Speaker C: It's not like I think that has anything to do with. I don't know why other ecos can't easily just use telegram, the app, and they can just use access. All those same.
00:49:57.460 - 00:49:59.320, Speaker A: I'm gonna give you a simple answers.
00:50:00.740 - 00:50:04.986, Speaker C: Good. Because most your answers are way too complicated and you're just running in circles.
00:50:05.108 - 00:50:07.730, Speaker A: Telegram owns the lot of time.
00:50:09.990 - 00:50:10.638, Speaker C: Sure.
00:50:10.774 - 00:50:12.450, Speaker A: There's your plans there.
00:50:13.350 - 00:50:24.134, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, maybe I think the thesis. I think. I think the thesis makes sense. Maybe, but that's a fact. I don't know.
00:50:24.182 - 00:50:34.444, Speaker B: I mean, I also. I also kind of, like, generally agree with, uh, Duncan's plunk and like, yeah, they don't have a lot of stuff now, but, like, I, in a year or two, they might have some more stuff, which makes it.
00:50:34.492 - 00:50:39.092, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you guys think they don't have a lot of stuff. Now is the biggest cope I've ever heard in my life.
00:50:39.156 - 00:50:41.040, Speaker B: I do agree with that point from.
00:50:41.900 - 00:50:44.920, Speaker C: Why is everything cope? I'm like someone who's trying to.
00:50:45.660 - 00:50:58.080, Speaker A: The Ethereum people like this, the exact same thing the Ethereum people said was on a couple years ago. The exact same thing. And like, to not recognize the parallels here, although I do agree with you that Solana's engineering team's probably better.
00:50:58.160 - 00:51:06.480, Speaker C: That's way different. I don't have like, a religious belief in, like any of the. So, like, when I'm looking at telegram, it's not that I don't want.
00:51:06.520 - 00:51:13.464, Speaker A: You have a bias about Solana for sure. A little bit. Mister unbiased definitely has a bit of a Solana bias.
00:51:13.552 - 00:51:26.364, Speaker C: Okay. But that's been correct. I didn't, I, I didn't, uh, like, I didn't. All I had was solo nfts when FTX went down. So it's not like I was, you know, holding.
00:51:26.412 - 00:51:31.356, Speaker A: I'm not saying that you won't change your mind or aren't pragmatic about this stuff. I just think that you have a.
00:51:31.428 - 00:51:32.804, Speaker B: But, all right, but you also have to.
00:51:32.852 - 00:51:33.012, Speaker A: Sure.
00:51:33.036 - 00:51:40.680, Speaker C: I have a bias because I've been. When you get, like, proven right, you, it kind of like reinforces.
00:51:41.220 - 00:51:41.692, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:41.756 - 00:51:47.708, Speaker C: That in your head. And it's, and so my whole thing is like, but the time, the sole.
00:51:47.724 - 00:51:51.640, Speaker A: Price going up is me getting proven right. The ton price going up.
00:51:52.600 - 00:52:23.956, Speaker C: Expensive bullshit. Here's, here's the thing though, duncan. Here's the thing is that, like, if I want to buy ton, then I'm probably going to have to sell some soul. And so if I can't develop a thesis that I really believe in, I'm probably not going to do that. And I'm okay if, todd, like, two x's versus soul. Like, I've seen a lot of stuff like unibot last cycle or in the summer of a year ago. Okay, I'm comparing the price action, not.
00:52:24.028 - 00:52:32.276, Speaker A: The, it's like, it's like multiple orders of magnitude smaller price action. We're talking about like, a hundred million dollar asset versus like a $20 billion asset.
00:52:32.388 - 00:53:00.524, Speaker C: I'm talking about, like, not chasing narratives because, like, I never believed in the unibody thesis. And eventually it was, like, proven right. You know, and so things can run. Things can run and then retrace, like, and the narrative can totally die and so if you, most people, I think in the industry, the reason why they lose money is because they never developed their own thesis. And so they never really are able to hold stuff. Like, these are volatile assets. Right.
00:53:00.524 - 00:53:04.084, Speaker C: So you have to, like, you got to believe in.
00:53:04.132 - 00:53:09.240, Speaker A: No, but the difference that the amount of capital it took to take unibot from $10.
00:53:09.700 - 00:53:13.840, Speaker C: Okay, bad example, I guess. I'm talking about, like, the terrible example.
00:53:16.340 - 00:53:17.716, Speaker A: Sorry, sorry for me.
00:53:17.748 - 00:53:34.972, Speaker B: I mean, I also do, like, I get it from, like, ceteris perspective, also from a relative valuation. Right. Tan to soul doesn't really make much sense here, but I don't invest on that stuff, you know, so, like, it's.
00:53:35.036 - 00:53:41.156, Speaker A: Yeah, ethereum just whole doesn't make sense. I agree with that. Like, why is sold 20% of ethereum? I think it's probably too low.
00:53:41.348 - 00:54:29.304, Speaker B: I was kind of going the other way. I think taunts probably too high given every. Given the things that are available to do right now, which is what people look at, and then it's like, okay, can you extrapolate? 612 months from now, ceteris probably doesn't think they are going to be able to develop enough over that timeframe to make him bullish enough to sell his soul bag on, like, you know, a comp valuation basis, which makes sense, right? Like, I don't, I don't think that's, like, an incorrect argument. I think it's very fair from that perspective. So, like, I don't know, the fact that there is quite a bit of, like, different. Maybe that is a reason why. Why ton is probably under owned, right? Like, I mean, I don't know.
00:54:29.304 - 00:54:32.264, Speaker B: The market cap's really high, so maybe it isn't under. I don't know.
00:54:32.352 - 00:54:34.768, Speaker A: North America is offside on time.
00:54:34.864 - 00:54:46.274, Speaker C: I'll just say, I mean, listen, if, like, a lot of the time might just be, like, effectively not circulate. Like, I don't know how much the telegram foundation owns and stuff too. Right?
00:54:46.402 - 00:54:49.470, Speaker A: So they also don't have a binance spotlisting you.
00:54:50.530 - 00:54:52.150, Speaker C: Yeah. Where do you even buy it?
00:54:52.570 - 00:54:56.510, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm long it or I bought it on chain and then long it.
00:54:57.210 - 00:55:05.396, Speaker C: True. I think it's, like, worth paying attention to. And I think that there's going to be. There'll probably be, like, some good opportunities. Opportunities on and, like, in the eco.
00:55:05.588 - 00:55:07.116, Speaker A: That's an answer I'm happy with.
00:55:07.228 - 00:55:12.748, Speaker C: I'm just, like, not sure if Taun is itself is, like, the right versus whatever Michael is.
00:55:12.804 - 00:55:24.388, Speaker B: So I guess my pushback there is, like, I get what you're saying from, like, I get it, but, like, has that ever actually turned out to be the case where, like, just longing the native.
00:55:24.524 - 00:55:26.360, Speaker C: Yeah, like, but, like, taunt is.
00:55:27.100 - 00:55:28.020, Speaker A: It was always.
00:55:28.140 - 00:55:32.634, Speaker C: Except for taunt is, like, so much higher valuation than all the chain.
00:55:32.682 - 00:55:33.658, Speaker B: For sure. For sure.
00:55:33.714 - 00:55:36.002, Speaker C: Whereas it's normally not that big of a difference.
00:55:36.066 - 00:55:42.626, Speaker A: No. It's like, the main decks on tan is insanely expensive. Like, I don't. I haven't seen that many good deals on ton.
00:55:42.778 - 00:55:43.682, Speaker C: Okay.
00:55:43.866 - 00:55:54.826, Speaker A: Except for Jason's meme coin extraordinaire. There's a dog coin there. That's 100 million. If any point enjoyers think that that's cheap, hunters.
00:55:54.858 - 00:56:01.966, Speaker B: Pretty cheap, dude. For a, you know, for a solid meme, I haven't looked at it, but solid meme, hundred mil, it's definitely cheap.
00:56:02.118 - 00:56:02.798, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:02.894 - 00:56:05.846, Speaker C: All right. Um, well, this is, like, coming up on an hour.
00:56:05.878 - 00:56:06.910, Speaker A: We're going to wrap it up.
00:56:06.990 - 00:56:10.502, Speaker C: I think we talked enough about ton. We talked enough about the ETF's.
00:56:10.686 - 00:56:12.110, Speaker A: I've yelled enough, etcetera.
00:56:12.190 - 00:56:19.530, Speaker B: I'm excited to see you guys next week when you cover the launch, the hopeful launch of the Sol ETF or ETh. ETF.
00:56:20.790 - 00:56:21.942, Speaker A: He's got to pray.
00:56:22.126 - 00:56:23.422, Speaker B: We got to see who's right.
00:56:23.486 - 00:56:26.010, Speaker A: We got to pray to Larry fink that he's going to apply.
00:56:26.340 - 00:56:27.060, Speaker C: Well, I mean, there.
00:56:27.100 - 00:56:29.788, Speaker A: There's no trading save us Larry thing.
00:56:29.924 - 00:56:35.320, Speaker C: There's no trading on the fourth. Right. So is, are the markets open on the Friday? Is it, like a half day?
00:56:35.700 - 00:56:36.548, Speaker B: That's a good question.
00:56:36.604 - 00:56:39.240, Speaker C: That'd be weird to, like, launch it on a half day.
00:56:39.620 - 00:56:43.300, Speaker B: Gary's last stand, watching it on a half day.
00:56:43.340 - 00:56:43.924, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:44.092 - 00:56:46.960, Speaker A: A couple more liquidations than up only, right, Jason?
00:56:48.460 - 00:56:51.188, Speaker C: All right, Duncan, you did the intro. You want to do the outro?
00:56:51.364 - 00:57:00.332, Speaker A: Thank you guys for watching. Sorry for my yelling. I'm a little bit excited this morning. Everyone, have a great day. Bye bye.
00:57:00.436 - 00:57:01.228, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
00:57:01.364 - 00:57:03.124, Speaker B: Thank you. Nothing said on the hive mind is.
