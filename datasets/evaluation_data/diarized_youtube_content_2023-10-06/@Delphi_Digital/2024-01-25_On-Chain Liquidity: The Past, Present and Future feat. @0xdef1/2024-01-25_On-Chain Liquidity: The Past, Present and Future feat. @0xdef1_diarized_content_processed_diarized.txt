00:00:11.960 - 00:00:54.694, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, my name is Jose Maseru, and welcome to episode three of the Hive Mind podcast. We all should have much better mics today. We got a lot of complaints about sound quality, so that should be, that should be fixed. And as always, the goal of the podcast is to provide an inside look into what we like to call the Delphi Hivemind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights, alpha and ship posts. Today with us, we have ceteris, from our institutional research arm, who focuses on blockchain, infra, and defi. We have Jan Lieberman, who's the managing partner at Delphi Ventures. And we have ventures associate, Duncan, also known as flood Capital, prodigious shitcoin scavenger, and investor.
00:00:54.694 - 00:01:35.036, Speaker A: I lead Delphi Labs, our protocol R and D arm focused on incubating and accelerating new web3 primitives. And we also have Matt, also known as Oxdefi, who heads up research at Labs and is a general gigabrain on Amms, which is gonna be a lot of the topic of today's chat. It's a bit of a stale. It's been a bit of a stale newsweek in crypto maybe news month. So we're gonna be talking about the future of on chain liquidity, which is of our research, recently published a report on it. Check it out if you're a subscriber. But basically, this conversation is going to be around whether there is a future for on chain liquidity, or whether everything is just going to move to off chain.
00:01:35.036 - 00:01:45.012, Speaker A: And so, to start with, we just want to go over like a brief history of on chain liquidity, starting back in the ether delta days. Ceteris, take it away.
00:01:45.148 - 00:02:16.752, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, the first on chain liquidity was like, using this ether delta. And this is a fully. This is a fully on chain order book. And so you would actually have to. This was like 20 transaction, like, yeah, 2017, right? I would guess, like 99% of stuff that was traded on there is like, effectively zero now, but you'd have to do like a transaction to deposit into the exchange. And then you do, you know, another on chain transaction to, like, place and cancel orders.
00:02:16.752 - 00:02:50.860, Speaker B: And this was on Ethereum with like twelve second block times. And so it was very expensive and very inefficient system. And before Defi summer kind of came around, it was kind of workable still because gas fees were so cheap, because no one was really using, like, ethereum l one or anything. But as soon as people started using it, it became clear that like, okay, this fully on chain order book is way too expensive. Like, it's not practical. Okay. And that's when amms started coming out with stuff like curve and uniswap.
00:02:50.860 - 00:02:52.220, Speaker B: Well, it was unique.
00:02:52.412 - 00:02:59.460, Speaker A: Vitalik, like, put. Put up this. This xY equals k. Then Hayden built it as, like, a grant, I'm pretty sure, from the eF.
00:02:59.612 - 00:03:00.276, Speaker C: And then.
00:03:00.380 - 00:03:01.436, Speaker A: Yeah, it started kind of.
00:03:01.500 - 00:03:58.696, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm not sure which one was first, but, like, what the big. The big thing that amm solved is that they were workable in a gas constraint environment, right, because you don't need to, as a liquidity provider, you don't need to keep doing, placing and, like, canceling orders. When someone takes, like, one side of the pool, you automatically kind of, like, flip to now offering the other side, right? So this is like, why amms took off is that you're in such a gas constrained environment and this kind of got around those gas hurdles. And then, second of all, was kind of just like all the rewards and all the farming that people were doing, right. I think synthetix was probably one of the bigger reasons why people started lp'ing, right? Because they started doing all this s USD stuff, and then they were big on curve. Like some of those early.
00:03:58.696 - 00:04:05.814, Speaker B: Some of those early LP's. Lp and sust on curve, like massive, massive air drops, right? Like millions of dollars.
00:04:05.854 - 00:04:09.314, Speaker C: Airdrop and synthetic ethan. Regular ETH.
00:04:10.054 - 00:04:10.366, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:10.390 - 00:04:42.154, Speaker B: And it's like a very simple pool, right? Like you're. It's just ETH against Ethan. This synthetix doesn't go insolvent. Like you have no impermanent loss or anything and. Yeah. So, so that's kind of like how these amms took off. And then, of course, came the whole defi summer curve, did their airdrop, then sushi forked Uniswap, and they started pumping out the token rewards, right? And so the once, like a bull market, and no one knows how to value these.
00:04:42.154 - 00:05:01.518, Speaker B: These farm tokens that you're getting, right? Like, how defensible is this income that LP's are getting? And all this, that kind of led to the mayhem of, like, on chain amm farming. That whole craze uniswap did the airdrop. So that's kind of like how the whole on chain liquidity started.
00:05:01.606 - 00:05:16.354, Speaker A: And it looked for a while as if that's where it would stay, right? Like most projects would launch with, like, LP incentives. Like yield. Farming was all the rage, I guess, kicked off by synthetix. Yeah. And then things took a dark turn.
00:05:16.654 - 00:06:16.164, Speaker D: The other thing that I'll add to this is it was in a gas constrained environment. So yes, like the amms got around those constraints, but also being fully on chain made it decentralized. And people started to realize that if there was a significant mass of liquidity in these pools, they could really launch tokens in a decentralized way without having to negotiate with exchanges or hire market makers or trust third parties. And so as people were creating these new ecosystems, they wanted to create a token to incentivize certain behaviors, having on chain liquidity and being able to bootstrap that on chain liquidity by giving rewards, Wi Fi. Their launch was one of the first people that did this, really started this defi summer revolution of if we take some of our token, some of our token supply and pay people to LP, it's a valuable service to us and it's going to get us more distribution, more users in a fully decentralized way. I think that was pretty novel.
00:06:18.464 - 00:06:25.148, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, maybe center do you want to go through like when, when things started to change, I guess like one inch and.
00:06:25.236 - 00:08:00.304, Speaker B: Yeah, tense I get, I guess, I mean, well, so that's kind of how it started. And then, yeah, then he had all these aggregators pop up and those were good for traders because now instead of, you know, if you go through uniswap, it wrote through uniswap pools, but maybe not all these other amms that popped up. And so that was good for traders. But over the past, I guess, year or two, people have started to realize how much money LP's lose to basically just toxic flow and arbitrage. Because since an LP is passive and doesn't update its prices every time, the price, I mean, so like price discovery happens for all the liquid assets on centralized exchanges, right? So anytime the price changes on a centralized exchange, you now have these stale pools on chain. And so a big part of on chain volume has just been people arbitrating the pools from like centralized exchanges, right? And so this whole like loss versus rebalancing thing that people have been talking about a lot over the past year is kind of this phenomenon, right, where if ETH is trading out like $1,000 and it spikes to 1100 on an exchange, the LP on chain will effectively sell from 1000 to 1100 in like incremental ticks. And so 99% of that trade is at a stale price, right.
00:08:02.364 - 00:09:00.654, Speaker C: I think it's helpful to kind of put that just to understand the, how it works relative to kind of IL as well, just to kind of rewind. So IL impermanent loss was kind of the main initial concern with LP and the whole idea was Il just says, if I'm holding two assets in equal quantities, and you compare that to putting those two assets in a uni v two pool. When price moves from x to y, how much did my amm underperform the buy and hold strategy? And so, and then the, the idea is why it's called impermanent is if price goes back from y back to x, the two are equal. Right. Both the value in the amm and the value of your buy and hold strategy. What LVR basically means is saying is when it goes from x to y back to x, you actually shouldn't be sitting with your starting value of assets. You actually lost money and you should actually have more.
00:09:00.654 - 00:09:19.022, Speaker C: And the reason being what center has kind of described where, you know, price is because loss versus rebalancing is basically you comparing the performance of the position in the amm versus someone replicating the Amm strategy, but doing it on binance. Right. So the idea is if, like, it's.
00:09:19.038 - 00:09:24.126, Speaker B: Kind of like, if I can just jump in, it's kind of like how much money you left on the table? Yeah, like, what do you leave on the table?
00:09:24.190 - 00:09:42.304, Speaker C: Right. And so, like, yeah, price pumps. Uh, it's, yeah, like 1%. Right. So you started at 1000 thousand dollars ETH price moves to ten. The decision tree is, okay, I need to sell some ETH to go back to 50 50. I am selling at $1,010 on the amm.
00:09:42.304 - 00:10:10.248, Speaker C: That's more of a price taker. And so those rebalance late. So basically what happens is the price pumps to ten. The AMm is effectively still selling it at 1000. Like you can go into the amm and buy it at 1000 and move it to ten. So the amm, the liquidity provided in the AMM is instead of selling it at 1010 like you did on binance, sells it at basically the midpoint between 1010. And so that kind of over time is the issue.
00:10:10.248 - 00:10:27.044, Speaker C: And so, yeah, part of the reason why it's useful to do in that context is kind of with those difficulties in mind, who is kind of the ideal. Like, where does it make sense to be an LP? Right. So it's.
00:10:27.504 - 00:10:37.844, Speaker A: I don't want to get into that too much now, though, because we're going to get into like the LP ing and amm stuff. Stuff later. Maybe just continuing to like, that was useful context, but continuing to set the context.
00:10:38.384 - 00:10:38.736, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:38.760 - 00:11:14.564, Speaker A: Like one inch came about then I guess like cow swap eventually uniswap x. The difficulties with and inefficiencies of LP ing meant more and more of volume has flowed to those which are effectively being served by, like, off chain market makers and centralized exchanges. Right. And then I guess that plus, like, off chain order books with the likes of Dydx and Vertex and stuff means that a lot of, I mean, price discovery sort of always happened on chain, off chain, at least for the, for the majors. But you're starting to see that, like, also trading volumes and stuff move more and more to these off chain solutions, right?
00:11:15.704 - 00:12:28.988, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, the off chain stuff like cow swap, all these intent based protocols, Uniswap X, the whole noma thing, that is better for traders, right? Because you're not getting sandwiched. Like when you, when you sign, when you want to trade against an amm on chain, you're just, you're signing like this execution path that says, yeah, I want to go through this pool and I can afford this amount of slippage and just get it done. And so, you know, people get, everyone who's used on chains probably had a bad sandwich or two in their lifetime, which is just, you know, someone in an advantageous position, essentially reordering transactions to make you lose money. And so with these intent based designs, they're, they're kind of like limit orders. They happen off chain, and then they're based around solvers. And so something like cowswap, you know, someone goes in, does I want to buy one ETH for ex USDC. And then a solver goes to, like, look, to fill that, and they can use their own inventory, they can use pools on chain, but basically they're trying to, like, fill that order directly.
00:12:28.988 - 00:14:00.614, Speaker B: And so the, the shift in moving to this kind of, like, intent based architecture is that for liquidity providers on chain in these amms, they start to get less of the organic flow because they start to get less of the organic flow because now when this, like, retail trader with no alpha, no like knowledge, whatever comes in, instead of going directly through the pool against the amm, they go to this solver, and the solver has their own inventory and they have money on centralized exchanges, and they're the ones that, like, are able to fill this retail trader. And then the solver just goes and arbs the amm pools themselves. So the amms are now starting to get, like, more and more of just this toxic flow, which is, you know, they were always arbitraged against CFI exchanges. But now that they're also losing some of the organic flow, the, the ratio of their toxic flow goes up and then also their volume goes down a bit because you don't have the organic volume anymore. And so now we're kind of, you know, we did everything was amm. We've had some of these, all these intent things are coming along now, and now we're kind of moving. You're going to start to see amms kind of like defend us now, right, and kind of like fix some of these problems and we can, I don't know if we want to get into that now.
00:14:01.414 - 00:14:28.498, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess before. So that's basically like the, I guess the bear case for on chain liquidity, right? It's a future where we move to this fully intent centric model. It is a feature where you don't really like amms would just be purely exposed to like toxic flow or mostly toxic flow, and then eventually no one wants to lp. And like all price discovery moves to these, to these like intense based off chain models. Is that writers or anything you'd add to that like before?
00:14:28.546 - 00:15:17.614, Speaker B: Cuz no, that's, that's right. Like also the intent architecture, it's also not just like amms, its bridges too, right? Like you don't need these, these passive liquidity bridges either. Yeah, it's a lot of things. If you go to like the extreme of the intent architecture, then applications are merely front ends with their own solving algorithms, and blockchains are basically just used for settlement of assets. But a lot of the complexity happens, you know, in this off chain and like in this peer peer gossip layer. And so like, I don't know if that's the exact end state we're going to go towards, but that would be like the full on bear case for on chain liquidity.
00:15:18.814 - 00:15:22.798, Speaker E: So what are like the negatives of this, if that happens?
00:15:22.846 - 00:16:27.776, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's more centralized, like regulatory pressure. Basically everything that is, in my opinion, everything that's easier is also a bigger regulatory target. And so think about like the l two s right now, okay? The l two s are all taking extremely easy paths. They are multisigs with a single sequencer, okay? And so they can offer like a clean ux. There's not a lot of like complications, the architecture, but it is most likely like an easier regulatory surface to attack. Right? And then if you think about like solvers and intent architectures, if you have, if you have like two, three solvers that are filling like all the orders on blockchains, then that again is an easy regulatory target versus if you have all this passive retail liquidity that's all over the place. It's less efficient, but it's also just, it's just this massive can't go after like hundreds of thousands of people, right?
00:16:27.840 - 00:16:55.892, Speaker E: Yeah, because like the solver is essentially just bridging binance or wherever the deepest liquidity is to the user directly on the blockchain and like using it as settlement. Right. So I think that's where I definitely agree with the bearish Amm takes. I feel like I've thought that for a while because they simply just don't have as much information or complexity as the solver. But I think this is where some more complex oracle models hold off on.
00:16:55.908 - 00:17:28.050, Speaker A: That for a second. We will get into that. I guess we went through over the bear case for on chain liquidity and now we're going to move on to like what the bull case is. And I guess it starts with the fact that even though everyone knows LP ing is incredibly unprofitable, there have been like 3000 studies on how everyone is losing money on unity three and unity two and stuff. There's still like billions of dollars of demand for LP ing on chain. And that's kind of hard to argue against.
00:17:28.162 - 00:17:28.650, Speaker E: Right.
00:17:28.762 - 00:17:59.606, Speaker A: And then I think the argument that people like Matt would put forward, and I think Jan, to some extent, is that if these like highly, and myself actually is that if these highly inefficient models can attract billions of dollars of capital, there's something here. And as the models improve, which they are, and we're seeing like really cool stuff happen, then they'll capture even more of this, of this flow. And so, I don't know, Matt, do you want to give like kind of your thoughts on, I guess like the bull case for on chain liquidity?
00:17:59.750 - 00:18:33.654, Speaker D: Sure. I mean, I think having on chain liquidity at all is really valuable to lots of different people in the ecosystem. So like it's really valuable for traders to have on chain liquidity so that they can trade against a decentralized source. It's really valuable for issues to have on chain liquidity so that they can bootstrap it really easily. And when it is that valuable for them, they offer incentives. So like in defi summer we saw a lot of incentives and a lot of people thought amms were like these magic money machines with triple digit yields. We're not seeing that so much anymore.
00:18:33.654 - 00:18:52.174, Speaker D: But people offering incentives, they're offering incentives for a reason. It's because that liquidity is valuable. And I think we're seeing a lot of LP's lose money right now. Because a on uniswap, there's not a lot of incentives that are external.
00:18:53.434 - 00:18:57.386, Speaker B: I mean, the volumes are down too, right? So like you're getting less trading fees.
00:18:57.530 - 00:19:02.294, Speaker C: Yeah, you had all the money flowing into the space and then like a bunch flowing out.
00:19:02.634 - 00:19:07.338, Speaker E: But the liquidity mining stuff isn't really like sustainable.
00:19:07.466 - 00:19:46.964, Speaker D: Well, people are underpricing the service. So like the LP's that are putting their money into these pools, the fees that they're collecting are not commensurate with the risk they're bearing or the value that they're providing to those other people. And even with off chain liquidity, so like a market maker that is hired by an issuer, they're giving that market maker either money or some kind of sweetheart option deal to hedge away the risk, or the exchange is giving them rebates. So a lot of the profit for an off chain market maker comes from these external incentives. So if we're looking at on chain liquidity, to compare apples to apples, you kind of have to include those incentives as well.
00:19:48.824 - 00:19:51.088, Speaker B: Nobody actually wants to trade these assets.
00:19:51.176 - 00:20:08.304, Speaker D: Well, what I'm saying is like, if you look at a market maker purely on a like inventory p and l basis, a lot of them are losing money too, because market making is hard. Right. You're not really taking an opinion on which way the price is going to move. You're just saying, give me money for providing you liquidity for providing Amm.
00:20:08.344 - 00:20:23.008, Speaker C: So this is just like more on the bull case for amms just before we kind of veer off this. So, you know, it's. I think so. A lot of people are losing money on uni v three. I wouldn't really put uni v three in the amm bucket. Right. It's not automated.
00:20:23.008 - 00:21:17.378, Speaker C: It's basically an order book. But like, without the benefits of being able to do that type of market making on a centralized exchange. So it kind of boils down to where can it make sense for someone to do this completely passively? So the intense stuff is beneficial for the trader side, but there isn't a lot, there's still issues with the LP side, one of it being the fact that LP's are constantly taking stale prices. And so LVR is really hard to completely undo. But there are things you can implement, whether that's, and this isn't exhausted by any means, but a dynamic fee. So LVR is worse the more price moves. And so if you have a dynamic fee which increases as the size of the trade increases, that's something that can help mitigate it using an oracle for the ammo.
00:21:17.378 - 00:22:18.784, Speaker C: So the pool isn't, is it trading on a purely stale price, but it can use an external oracle price which introduces some kind of centralization risks, or you can do the decentralized equivalent, which is what curve v two does. So I think a lot of those types of implementations can help reduce LVR, and then you're rationalizing it. So then you think about, ok, so who is the user that wants to LP? I think part of it is, is based on your opinion on price direction. If you're bullish on an asset, then more often than not it's really hard to rationalize LP. But if you are pretty neutral on it, you think we're range bound for an extended period of time, or if it trends higher but doesn't necessarily go up too much, or if you don't necessarily trust yourself to be able to sell when it goes up and you want to gradually sell as it goes up. I think there's arguments in that scenario where it makes sense to lp it. So it's not necessarily.
00:22:18.784 - 00:22:47.294, Speaker C: I think it boils down to what you're comparing it against. If you're just bullish on the asset and want long exposure, then there is no scenario, or almost no scenario where it makes sense to LP. But if you're pretty neutral and want to generate passive yield, then I think there are some of these solutions that help avoid LP's constantly transacting at stale prices and improves kind of their experience by reducing the LVR. And I think in that scenario you can really begin to kind of rationalize LP ing.
00:22:49.714 - 00:23:00.642, Speaker A: And. Yeah, Matt, sorry Matt, I know you have a metaphor I really like with index funds. It's like, maybe like it's the hopium meme a little bit, but yeah, this.
00:23:00.658 - 00:23:38.254, Speaker D: Definitely might be hopium. But if you compare like investing to, to market making. So the conventional wisdom for a really long time was that investing was this very specialized skillset that only the best people in the world could do. It was kind of this black box of people who could make a lot of money investing. And then index investing came along and said, you can just kind of do this passively. Most of the people who pretend to do this aren't very good at it and don't really beat the index. And then passive investing became this huge boom of an industry and there was a huge market for it.
00:23:38.254 - 00:24:23.642, Speaker D: Market making is very similar in that there's a small number of people who do it with a very specialized skillset and it's sort of this black magic voodoo that people don't really understand how it works under the covers. Maybe there's a place for passive market making in the same way that there was for passive investing. And I think the fact that a lot of LP's are losing money right now means that they're not pricing their service appropriately, they're not pricing selling volatility appropriately. And there's been very little experimentation with how fees work. You know, a lot of the fees on Amms is like flat, 0.3%. No market maker in the history of the planet has said we're always going to have a 0.6% spread no matter what the price is, no matter what the volatility is.
00:24:23.642 - 00:24:37.574, Speaker D: It's kind of a brain dead market making strategy. So I would love to see more innovation in how, how fees work and how LP is charged for the service that they're offering, both to traders and to issuers and to exchanges and things like that.
00:24:38.554 - 00:25:25.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I think like to add on that, like the psychology is a big, is a big reason and humans are like not necessarily rational, especially in markets. And this is like why people, you know, people always want to try and outperform the market and out trade, even though all the, like, data on it shows that most traders like lose money, right, but it's kind of like that arrested development meme. It's like it didn't work for them, but it might work for us. Right. And so you're always going to have people that will like, no matter how much of the data shows them that they're probably losing money, will try it and some will be successful. Right. There's also just the fact that people want to do stuff with their assets.
00:25:25.870 - 00:27:23.204, Speaker B: And if you have like ETH in your wallet and you have some other asset that is like kind of correlated to it, it's much easier to like rationalize and justify, you know, doing something with those and kind of like trying to lp with them because like, you people will have these assets and they want to do stuff with them. And so I think that the market will come up with better solutions that we're kind of seeing now where you kind of, I don't think LP'ing needs to be perfect, but you need to be able to capture a lot of that c five defi arb because that's like the main place where LP's lose. And so if you can, you get some of these Amm designs where you have like these top of block auctions, right? So when the price changes on a centralized exchange, that first trade into the amm, instead of like a searcher coming in and bidding up to the proposer, and then all the value going to the proposer and the searcher instead, the amm itself becomes like aware of this auction. And so that bid to be the first one to ARB, that pool actually ends up getting distributed back to LP's, right? And so mechanisms like that, we're going to see way more, because if amms don't become more aware of what's happening off chain, then they will go away. And if you can recapture a lot of that C 5D Virp, then I do think that will be good enough that you will see a lot of passive liquidity still, because passive liquidity, it's very useful. Like, especially people like die with their keys too. And like, you just have this liquidity sitting there forever.
00:27:23.204 - 00:27:31.424, Speaker B: Like, yeah, it is kind of useful. Like, it is useful to have that for like liquidations, for defi, like for everything.
00:27:33.484 - 00:27:36.550, Speaker E: It'd be useful to the traders, admittedly.
00:27:36.582 - 00:27:39.834, Speaker A: Not useful to the dead person if LP.
00:27:40.614 - 00:27:41.758, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess it doesn't really matter.
00:27:41.806 - 00:28:07.464, Speaker D: To the dead person. If LP ing passively can be made into a profitable endeavor, then you have this new avenue to take idle assets and make them productive, which is like a huge product, right? There's a lot of people with idle capital that want to make productive, that, you know, they put it in products like bonds, they try to lend it, they try to do lots of things to make that capital productive. And if LP ing is a way to do that, it's a huge product.
00:28:08.124 - 00:28:53.084, Speaker A: Duncan, I'm going to let you loose in a second. I guess what we're hearing is amms, there's interesting improvements that can be made, like the top of block auction, like playing with variable fees, curvy to style, doing more experimentation around that. And if those improvements are made, given the demand there is already, we think this could go up even more and it could become a way of passively generating yield on idle assets. And this also has a bunch of benefits, like you said. And I think importantly also the other model has a bunch of costs. Integrating onboarding with a centralized market maker requires negotiation. Often they're pretty extortionate.
00:28:53.084 - 00:29:23.330, Speaker A: You have to onboard into centralized exchange. The market maker has to have the regulatory sort of like risk appetite to trade these assets, which is getting less and less the case. So like, there's a bunch of, I mean, there's a bunch of benefits to having this, this on chain, always on liquidity, also for protocols, for liquidations, for stuff like that. And all that, I guess, has to, has to be priced into the. To this. But Duncan, I know you, you've been raring to go. Give us your.
00:29:23.330 - 00:29:24.494, Speaker A: Yeah, go on.
00:29:25.854 - 00:29:27.262, Speaker C: Yeah, but, yeah.
00:29:27.278 - 00:30:11.466, Speaker E: So I definitely think there's cases where it makes sense, like in the current state, like passive liquidity or on chain liquidity in its current state makes sense. Like, for instance, we're talking about a protocol wants liquidity on their token. You know, I'm not a massive fan of like liquidity mining, but something where like the protocol were to deploy a bunch of, it's like governance token in like a uni V three lp range. And then like, you know, as if the protocol is successful, people buy that and they like have like protocol and liquidity as the price goes up and they can kind of like provide their own liquidity. That's a lot of what GMX has done. Something like that, I think makes a lot of sense. And like, from the protocol's point of view.
00:30:11.530 - 00:30:11.730, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:11.762 - 00:30:57.984, Speaker E: Like they don't really care that much if they're losing, you know, versus what they could be doing on like binance market making. Because like you guys said, like for that, for them, it's worth it to provide liquidity for the token. Also for like smaller cap tokens. Like, it doesn't really make sense to use an order book or off chain or Oracle. So, like being able to deploy like a new project with like a little bit of liquidity in an amm, I think makes sense. I think the big point, and I agree with everyone, that these amms are going to get better over time. Like Matt said, the Uniswap pool doing three bps fee is just insane, regardless of the market conditions.
00:30:57.984 - 00:31:50.844, Speaker E: We've seen stuff like curvy too, where as volatility increases, it'll increase the fee and the spread, kind of like a market maker would. Market maker would pull the spread out during more volatility. So I definitely think it's gonna be like smarter models. What Cetris is talking about, like the auctions to capture the C five defi arb. I think what it comes down to probably at the end of the day though, is that these on chain systems, if they're truly automated, are never going to have as much information as kind of like a market maker or someone running these solvers. So it's going to be very difficult for them to be as performant in all scenarios. But I definitely think there's things where you could help bridge that gap where it's, instead of just defi being a front end into binance.
00:31:50.844 - 00:33:12.662, Speaker E: Through all these solvers you can have passive pools of liquidity on chain and then some slightly more complicated oracle model which will try and get you pretty close to what your execution would be on a centralized exchange, but also having that liquidity on chain. And it can't just kind of like disappear versus like these like front ends and solvers. So like some sort of middle ground or even like, I don't know how you would like solve the kind of like alignment problem here, but like, you know, if there's, if there's capital on chain, like you have a solver like quote for the pool, you know, they probably have to take some sort of fear or some sort of alignment problem there. But like passing information from like centralized exchanges and like the place of price discovery and liquidity to on chain I think is possible. I just think it's like really inefficient right now because the models for amms we have are really inefficient. And then you run into also the gas issue where as we've seen with curvy two, I think it's twice as expensive as a uni v three swap, which when gas gets pricey on Ethereum can make a really big difference. So if you're going to continually make these amms more and more complicated, then you also have to factor in gas in that execution side.
00:33:12.662 - 00:33:21.874, Speaker E: But I think there's definitely a path forward. I just think how they are in their current state is pretty bad and they're never going to be as good.
00:33:22.894 - 00:33:38.094, Speaker A: To be clear here, we're talking about for the majors because for long tail tokens where price discovery happens on amms like the robots and on chain things of this world, it doesn't matter. I think amms will continue to be the best for that for foreseeable future.
00:33:38.754 - 00:34:00.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it makes sense though, right? You aren't able to, you don't have the skillset to do what a centralized market maker does and so in exchange, and you don't actually have to do any work. Right. It's, the idea is set and forget it. I. Similar returns, but worse on all fronts.
00:34:00.586 - 00:34:17.538, Speaker A: Can we maybe spend like a segment like each person, like name dropping some projects that they're excited about in this space, like that in the unchained liquidity space or approaches that you think are interesting? I was surprised, Duncan, that you didn't put like a GMX V two shield in there. So I'm now giving you the opportunity to.
00:34:17.706 - 00:34:35.783, Speaker E: Yeah, well, yeah, I think like GMX so they came out in maybe September of 2021. And, like, right away, I think they started getting, like, a lot of traction because, like, they're the first, I think the first people to, like, really make the Oracle model successful. And for BTC and ETH, and they've.
00:34:35.863 - 00:34:37.735, Speaker A: A lot of people think it's just leveraged trading.
00:34:37.759 - 00:34:37.895, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:37.919 - 00:34:42.023, Speaker A: So maybe you could clarify the spot side because I think most people don't know about that.
00:34:42.143 - 00:34:42.375, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:42.399 - 00:35:35.162, Speaker E: So, like, V one launch is basically like a pool of, like, bitcoin, ETH and some stable coins. And they allowed, like, two different types of trading. So margin trading, right. Or leverage trading where you could essentially just like, go long on BTC or ETH by, like, kind of renting out the assets in the pool. It had price feeds in oracles to binance and the top exchanges to give you a fair price plus a set fee to reduce the ability for people to arbitrage because there's obviously a little bit of latency in the oracle. But then they also allowed spot swaps between BTC, ETH and USDC up to a really large size. And especially in the early days on arbitrum, that was probably the best way to swap between those three assets because the uni V two or V three pools didn't really have much liquidity and GMX would give you the binance level pricing.
00:35:35.162 - 00:36:41.466, Speaker E: And then they kind of iterated beyond that where it's just like, okay, we're just going to take the flat Oracle plus ten bps to their v two model where they're kind of factoring in order book depth. They can kind of go down the longer tail of assets because, like, before, how they were, like, limiting manipulation is like, okay, you need to buy a lot of BTC in order to move the price more than ten basis points, but that's not really true with every asset. So they've kind of gone down the list of long tail assets they're offering. It's still primarily majors, but in the future they're going to try and open it up as much as possible and they're going to factor in kind of like order book depth, like on chain depth to try and simulate the best sort of price. And then from the LP's point of view, they're not taking still prices, as et cetera said. So I think a really good example that just happened this week was the BTC ETF News, where BTC is up like 5% in like a minute. And it's like if you're in an amm or like anything that doesn't have like real time data getting fed into it.
00:36:41.466 - 00:37:10.294, Speaker E: Like you took still prices like all the way up on that move and it happened to be fake so it retraced it. But you still have like the LVR issue and if it were to be real, you got kind of screwed in any sort of passive product. So at least with like an oracle, even though liquidity is still sitting on chain, you have some of the decentralization benefits. It is updating in kind of real time so you're not getting just like really bad execution when the price gaps up like that.
00:37:10.834 - 00:37:16.728, Speaker A: That's interesting. I know. Does anyone want to respond to that or otherwise? I'll give the ceteris to discuss. Yeah, go ahead, Matt.
00:37:16.906 - 00:38:05.706, Speaker D: I think Oracle models especially for perps are super interesting. And we're seeing so much of the volume that used to be in spot trading on chain move to perps, because if you are just trying to get exposure to assets, perps is just a much better model. And the Oracle perps pioneered by GMX and GNS, I've seen so much usage. I think they do have a scalability issue because they require oracle prices from some source of price discovery that happens off chain. And so if you have more volume running through your exchange than is happening on those external exchanges, you have manipulation attacks and trouble kind of scaling past the amount of activity that's happening on the decentralized exchanges. And you're also dependent on those centralized exchanges for a source of price. So it's not truly decentralized in the end.
00:38:05.706 - 00:38:23.224, Speaker D: So I think they're super interesting models and I think there's product market fit there. In terms of endgame of decentralized on chain trading, I think a, it's not spot, so like, you know, you can't really hold the assets and b.
00:38:25.284 - 00:38:25.572, Speaker B: It'S.
00:38:25.588 - 00:38:27.756, Speaker D: Got a scalability issue and decentralization issue.
00:38:27.900 - 00:39:40.334, Speaker C: I was gonna say I think that the scalability is, yeah, I agree it's a concern, but I mean most of these markets, right, it's, you kind of have power law where it's the BTC pair, the ETH pair, and sol and a handful of others are just making up most of the volume. And so because it's like these guys actually benefit from the fact that you have this one exchange that dominates all the volume, right. Because typically you end up having to do it on a combination of exchanges with a lot smaller volume. But because you have this one massive whale that's taking up so much market share, you can, it simplifies the oracle process where you basically kind of just use them and then you can add in some, you know, kind of slippage based on the order book depth on those centralized exchanges. So I agree there's definitely a limitation issue, but I think there's still so much kind of capacity for that limit to grow and like part of. So the Oracle element is really useful here because it allows for, you know, every dollar of underlying LP liquidity in your GMX gns to support a lot more activity. And so it makes the LP is a lot more capital efficient and I think they don't have to deal with LBR.
00:39:40.334 - 00:40:00.154, Speaker C: And you also get the benefits of being the counterparty to traders which generally lose over time as well. And so I think that's also part of what might kind of cannibalize long term the demand for on chain liquidity for some of these majors because, yeah, it's just, it's hard to argue for.
00:40:00.534 - 00:40:18.710, Speaker D: Yeah, for, for the majors for sure. I think like long tail assets are like, if you're launching a new token, the presence of these kinds of oracle based exchanges don't really help you. So like it's, there's a different product than, you know, somebody trying to launch a token and boost trap liquidity.
00:40:18.902 - 00:40:41.154, Speaker B: I think the oracle model is, it's interesting. My, I guess my critique against it is just that you're like relying on an oracle and like I have seen some of these amms that use oracles before, kind of like misprice at times. I think the cleanest, I just think that the, the top block auction is the cleanest because you're not really relying on.
00:40:43.134 - 00:40:45.942, Speaker A: Can you talk about the tires that are, that are doing that or.
00:40:46.078 - 00:41:34.668, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, skip is like the first one that's done it, right? Yeah, it's on cosmos and I mean, there's not a lot of mev there. So, so you don't see it too much. But basically at the beginning of every block on osmosis, if someone wants to be first in like first transaction in that block, there's a bid for it. It's like a separate part of the block that is done with this like auction. And then, you know, all the value, let's say the price moved by like $10 and so the value of that bid will be up to like $10 and then that all gets redistributed to, I mean, in osmosis case, it's like stakers of the token. They can choose where it goes. On Ethereum, there's like different ways to do this.
00:41:34.668 - 00:42:11.110, Speaker B: Cirilla Labs is doing it where they actually have a contract. So they have their amm pools and then they have another contract, which is the only contract that's actually allowed to trade against those Amm pools. And then that contract runs the auction, right? And so it's the cleanest way, it's the cleanest way to like recapture that value because you're just solely relying on like this auction mechanism working and you don't have like an oracle that you're dependent on or something like that.
00:42:11.222 - 00:42:20.924, Speaker E: And since they're the only like entity that can trade against it, do they like solve like they don't leak much value to like the builders or.
00:42:21.304 - 00:42:34.992, Speaker B: Right, right. That's the point. Like, that's the thing, right? So like all the value recaptures it being. And that's where like amms are going. Like all the value is being captured by searchers and proposers, right? And proposers actually don't.
00:42:35.048 - 00:42:36.024, Speaker A: Right now you're saying.
00:42:36.144 - 00:43:18.870, Speaker B: Yeah, right now. And proposers, they capture a lot of mev from just like standard Arb, like rebalancing pools and everything. But the percentage that they actually capture from the C five DeFi Arbs is small, right. They have like less bargaining power in the sense. And so the searchers doing this because like they take on this big inventory risk and everything, they actually make like a good chunk of money from this. And so if you can just shift a lot of that value from, like, if, if you can't arb the amm without doing like the auction, it just solves a lot of, no, it does.
00:43:18.902 - 00:43:40.454, Speaker E: Seem like it solves a lot of the problems in like a scenario, like the, like the BTC scenario, like gapping up or like something where like in a traditional sense, market makers would like widen their spreads or like pull liquidity does. Is it as effect, like can it react to those scenarios? Or like how, what would happen?
00:43:40.494 - 00:44:01.014, Speaker B: Well, it's just like, it's, it's like natural competition. If you only had one person, for whatever reason, put a bid in, then they would win. But if you, if there's a competitive marketplace of searchers that are going to bid in this auction, you want to be first in the block. Right. And like the ego that goes to the highest bidder. Right, right.
00:44:01.094 - 00:44:09.554, Speaker E: And what is like the underlying pool? Or is it all through this auction mechanism? Like is there like a curve or something or.
00:44:10.214 - 00:44:31.904, Speaker B: Well, yeah, you can still have like an XyK type pool that it's like a side, it's like the, the auction value. The pool still gets arbed because it's still xyk. Right. But there's like this side, like a tip. Right? Like tip your LP and then that goes to them too, as kind of like a side piece.
00:44:31.984 - 00:44:32.440, Speaker E: Right.
00:44:32.552 - 00:44:50.648, Speaker B: So if the arbitrage is going to make a searcher $10, you know, all these searchers that are all trying to arb this pool are going to bid close to $10 to be the first in. And that's just like a very clean way to make LP's a little bit better off.
00:44:50.736 - 00:44:51.152, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:44:51.248 - 00:45:22.716, Speaker B: Without relying on, like, outside as much outside. Shit, that makes sense. And, like, just not just on, like, they're not charging fees enough to though, like this week, Uniswap added 15 bits to their front end. Right. And Uniswap LP, they charge like one, one to five basis points. So that right there, you know, and I think they're on pace for, like, if people actually keep using Uniswap front end, like 30 million or something. Over the course of a year, traders.
00:45:22.740 - 00:45:38.184, Speaker D: Have shown to be not very price sensitive in terms of, like, retail flow. I mean, it's the reason metamask swaps continue to be used quite a bit. Metamask is charging 85 bits. Yeah, it's all airdrop farming. It's not real activity.
00:45:40.524 - 00:46:14.744, Speaker B: That's like, as a side note though, this is the hardest thing about being an analyst, is that whenever you're looking at data, it's like, all right, is there a token yet? And how do I, like, adjust for this? Because I remember when I was doing the wallet wars report, you know, Metamask has great numbers for their in wallet apps and everything. But, you know, I think people, I don't know if people are still expecting that, though. I think people spent a lot of money trying to get an airdrop there, and I think, I'm not sure that's going to happen anymore.
00:46:16.124 - 00:47:07.416, Speaker A: I think the other cool thing about. Yeah, so we kind of landed on improved Amm models and, like, Oracle models being like, some of the most interesting, I guess, forms of on chain liquidity in the future. I think the other thing that's interesting about the Oracle model is you can really trade any asset, at least with like a GDAI, like, gain style model, or these, like, synthetic models. You can trade any asset without actually having to onboard a market maker to trade it, or bootstrap liquidity and LP pool, or have the asset on chain, which I think is really powerful. And, yeah, you mentioned the Uniswap labs taking 15 bps. Some people were melting down on Twitter about it. Does anyone have any interesting takes on that? Is anyone super, super like outraged by it?
00:47:07.520 - 00:47:45.554, Speaker B: I'm not outraged like they, it. So they never, they obviously never want to do a token like that. Should kind of, that's something to kind of point out is that the only reason I think they launched the token to begin with was because of sushi swaps. Vampire attack. And this is, I, this is, I guess one of the problems is that you have like equity and tokens in a lot of these protocols. And it's just like this will just encourage people to use other front ends, I guess. Yeah, you know, just stop using Uniswap front end.
00:47:45.554 - 00:48:11.334, Speaker B: You know, I think that. I think uniswap. So my thing with Uniswap is that I'm not even sure that in three years from now people think of them as Amm protocols. What they're trying to be is just this consumer finance application. And so that means the front end, it means their wallet, like their app. Right. Like go to Uniswap to do literally anything you want on chain.
00:48:11.334 - 00:48:41.998, Speaker B: And especially, you know, moving towards Uniswap X, which is small right now, but I imagine it's going to be used for a lot. And I think Uniswap X is going to be, is going to kill a lot of these bridge protocols too. Okay. Because you can do like bridging, you can do cross chain swaps with it and stuff like that. And so Uniswap is, they're, every good application is its front end. Like that is what I kind of think the end state is. So I'm not surprised they did this.
00:48:41.998 - 00:49:09.314, Speaker B: I'm not outraged they did it. What ends up happening is that the people who pay this are like new entrants, right? So like the bad, like the, the bad side of it is that the people who get screwed here are like the noobs because they don't like understand it's all this stuff like retail. Uni holds aggregators because everyone else was.
00:49:09.354 - 00:49:29.128, Speaker C: Like uni holder from the beginning. They're up massively even if it kind of keeps trending down. Right. Like relative to what they bought in. So it, it's irrelevant for them. It's kind of everyone else who bought in expecting the potential for a fee solution. And I think this just makes it less likely a reflection of their regulatory risk aversion and kind of like, I.
00:49:29.136 - 00:50:10.694, Speaker A: Mean, I think it's like perfectly reasonable if you run a front end, operate like servers, like take the regulatory risk of doing that, that you charge a fee for it. And I think if anything, that should be like the business model for crypto apps. You have contracts at the base layer and then a bunch of front ends competing to capture user flow and charging fees on top of it. And I'm a big fan of the liquidy and third chain model where protocol actually incentivizes people to run front ends. And I think until we have distributed front end solutions, that's the right model. So if anything, I feel like it just creates a bounty to decentralize and to make less people use the uniswap front end.
00:50:11.744 - 00:50:22.576, Speaker B: Yeah. So to yawn's point though, like, the uni holders up massively. It's trading at like the same airdrop price. So I guess you mean like people who got a big airdrop and they're just like committed or just people who.
00:50:22.600 - 00:50:38.676, Speaker C: Bought, you know, like investors are fine airdrop holders. I mean, if they held it, I'm assuming very few people have held their airdrop and traded it, but it's more so just everyone else who bought with some future expectation of a v switch, which is like, a lot of people.
00:50:38.860 - 00:50:52.396, Speaker B: Yeah, I was early. I was early. I just want to say I was early on calling no feast, whichever, like four months after they launched everyone. I was early on that, so I'm taking the w on that one.
00:50:52.460 - 00:52:08.834, Speaker E: I think why I would be more, why I said I was outrageous. More on the, like, just the whole miss incentive or like misaligned incentives between, like, these companies having equity in token and it's like kind of, and obviously this is like a take from just like a person who likes to invest in like, shitcoins and is like looking for good investments and like, not a legal one at all because I have no legal knowledge. But it's like more and more teams seem to be launching this way where they have, like, the equity and the token, and because of regulatory uncertainty or because they can just like have the ability to like, kind of like double dip into both, just end up just kind of screwing over the token. And I think, one, it's kind of bad for if you truly want some of these protocols to be decentralized, if all the value capture and all the real decisions are being made at the equity level, or even with the uniswap fee switch, that fee switch vote has been up, I feel, like, a few times, and the retail community overwhelmingly wants it, but just kind of like the team and the VC's behind it, you know, like won't allow it to happen. So from that kind of perspective, it's, you know, a bit disheartening.
00:52:09.174 - 00:52:22.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it makes sense though, if you think, all right, like, the regulatory risk is pretty binary to the downside, and then, like, the slow rug is basically the upside risk where it's like, yeah, yeah, sure, we'll add value to the token, but, like, you never really do.
00:52:22.182 - 00:52:25.394, Speaker E: I'm not saying it's like not expected. It just kind of sucks.
00:52:26.044 - 00:52:51.956, Speaker A: I just think though, like, if this were a, even if this were like a startup, like, it wouldn't really make sense to monetize this early. Right. Uniswap is what, like four, maybe, maybe five years old now. Like, it's still a market share game. Like, why would, why would they turn on the fee switch now and they're like crushing it on every, on every metric? Like, unique.
00:52:51.980 - 00:52:58.876, Speaker C: Well, part of it is the whole role, the token and its ability to help you gain market share. Right. If you use it.
00:52:58.940 - 00:53:18.546, Speaker A: But they don't do that, right. And have never done that. They don't, they don't need to add a fee switch to the token. They're getting it. All their volume and stuff is organic. All their liquidity is organic. So I just don't see the need to, like, it would basically shoot themselves in the foot to appease, like token holders short term, assuming we don't think it's the right long term, like, move.
00:53:18.610 - 00:53:59.444, Speaker E: I'm not even saying that they necessarily need, just like, I guess the problem with that is like, someone could come in and displace Uniswap, like really quickly. And so, like, even if they're like dominant market share now, it's like you could just get rugged in the future. Like, like Uniswap could not exist in a, in like a couple years from now. If like, someone comes out with a better model, obviously they have like a pretty, really strong brand and a pretty strong moat right now. But I think I definitely agree with you. A lot of these tokens shouldn't necessarily be distributing revenues from day one, but I think that the ownership between, okay, what is the token entitled to and what is the equity corp entitled to? Needs to be more clarified.
00:54:02.504 - 00:54:03.832, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
00:54:03.888 - 00:54:33.164, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't need to distribute anything. But Duncan's point, if there was no Uniswap equity, then, yeah, Uniswap token would probably be trading like four or five times higher. Right. Because if there ever, if there ever is like distribution in the future, you know it's going to the token, but you, you really, like, nobody really has any idea if uni will be ever be used for anything. Yeah, and like, that's a problem.
00:54:33.544 - 00:54:47.640, Speaker A: I think this, this is a situation where like, yeah, securities laws actually make sense. Like, this was Gabe's tweet last week, right. And I do think when there's equity and tokens, token holders normally are always going to get the short end of the stick.
00:54:47.712 - 00:54:47.944, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:47.984 - 00:55:20.384, Speaker A: Because, like, equity holders have established fiduciary duties. Like, it's actually a crime if you screw over, you know, equity holders in certain ways, whereas it won't be for token holders anytime soon. And also, founders and investors generally have a lot more ownership of the equity than they do of the token, just naturally because of, like, the distributions. So I, in general, like, definitely not a fan of the, of that model. But worth noting that they started, they were like a pioneer. Like one of the early projects where there was really no roadmap as to how to do this stuff.
00:55:20.464 - 00:55:20.728, Speaker E: Right.
00:55:20.776 - 00:55:32.240, Speaker A: And like, they've done. Yeah, I mean, they're. There's hard to. Hard to argue. They're one of the most successful dapps on chain. So, like, I don't know, don't, don't want to over hate on them, for sure.
00:55:32.272 - 00:55:35.792, Speaker B: Yeah, they get, they get shit on a lot because they're the most successful.
00:55:35.888 - 00:55:42.324, Speaker C: Like, yeah, unfortunately, the nature of crypto is just a lot of a nons on Twitter, it's easy to spew.
00:55:42.624 - 00:56:00.134, Speaker E: And it's also just like a perspective thing. Like, obviously, like, you know, if you want to try and make money on the uni token, you're gonna be pissed with these decisions. But like, you know, if you're looking from a different perspective, then, yeah, you could argue that they, you know, like, made a lot of really good decisions. That's just more.
00:56:00.954 - 00:56:10.226, Speaker D: Their moves are indicating that most of the value of Uniswap is in its brand and in capturing order flow. Unfortunately, the unitoken doesn't own the brand.
00:56:10.370 - 00:56:12.610, Speaker E: Yeah, you just got screwed as a unit token.
00:56:12.642 - 00:56:17.094, Speaker A: I'm not sure that's true, that most of the value is there.
00:56:17.874 - 00:56:26.326, Speaker C: Well, you could also argue that most of the value of the unity token is in the brand. There's no actual monetary value of the token.
00:56:26.450 - 00:56:58.130, Speaker A: But especially with uni V four, they could really become, I think, even more dominant if people start. We're kind of seeing it on the venture side. Some of the deals we see coming in that would normally be new imms are actually just hooks on uni V four. And I think at that point, with a sufficient network effect of hooks building in and all the integrations and stuff like that. I think at some point it will make sense to turn on the V switch. Even just. I guess I don't know if it's even possible to buy enough tokens to outweigh the investors and early holders.
00:56:58.130 - 00:56:59.214, Speaker A: I don't think it is.
00:56:59.674 - 00:57:01.814, Speaker E: You could unpumping their bags.
00:57:03.874 - 00:57:32.194, Speaker B: You could maybe use uni as anti Sybil for solvers that want to solve on Uniswap X. Like cow swap makes cow swap. Solvers have cow tokens. There's different things you could maybe do with, with it besides just pure free switch. So, I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why it still trades at whatever 5 billion or something high.
00:57:34.094 - 00:57:40.394, Speaker E: We should talk about tokens that are good at some point. So just these equity corporations.
00:57:41.294 - 00:58:29.876, Speaker C: Pretty, pretty bullish reaction. I think it was pretty obvious that it was a fake headline within, I don't know, ten minutes when it was basically just cointelegraph and no one else. And I think it was, yeah, it's clear to see how many people were kind of caught off sides. And so it kind of depends on, I mean, and now with, with Blackrock's date being Jan. 10th, that's why you see the really high probability for an ETF by then. I think at the very least you probably see some, some front running. Seems like BTC is going to kind of suck up the liquidity in the space as well, to some extent, aside from like a handful of coins with strong narratives.
00:58:29.876 - 00:58:33.028, Speaker C: So. But yeah, seems like.
00:58:33.076 - 00:58:50.256, Speaker B: Okay, this is, so the reaction was kind of crazy because it's not just that it was off a fake rumor, it's that it was off a fake rumor where the only organization that reported was cointelegraph, which like 99%. You're probably sure it's like not fake if nobody else is reporting this, right.
00:58:50.320 - 00:58:52.528, Speaker E: Sir, they have 2 million followers on.
00:58:52.576 - 00:58:56.884, Speaker C: X. Yeah, I think Algos. Well, I'm sure a lot of it was algo driven too.
00:58:57.384 - 00:59:00.520, Speaker A: It quickly was, was on the Bloomberg terminal though and stuff.
00:59:00.632 - 00:59:04.632, Speaker B: But it was, it was a good reaction like, because we needed that after.
00:59:04.688 - 00:59:30.196, Speaker C: Like the, the ETF, uh, the futures kind of um, how weak that was. Obviously, it's not apples to apples. It's, it's a futures and um, it's not spot and it's ETH. But I think, you know, it was a narrative that was certainly going around. It's like, all right, there's genuinely very little demand for it. And then I think it was that plus Larry Fink coming out and, and that probably was more bullish than the reaction to the headline. Yeah.
00:59:30.196 - 00:59:33.784, Speaker C: So you got to imagine they're going ham on sales team.
00:59:34.364 - 01:00:02.640, Speaker B: That's. That's what I'm. Yeah, that's the thing that people are not really paying attention to is how crazy the marketing is gonna be when these things get approved, because I've seen Jeff Dorman make this point a lot because they're all. There's gonna be, like, ten approved at once, and they're all competing for the Aum. You're just gonna be bombarded on every, you know, Sunday night football, Thursday Night Football, morning talk shows. They're gonna be going after soccer moms. Like, they're.
01:00:02.732 - 01:00:30.588, Speaker C: Yeah, and if you look, historically, a lot of these ETF's are winner take all for the most part. Like, if you look, you know, like Spy Gld, a lot of these big ones are winner take most. And so, like, you're going to see an insane amount of marketing because, you know, getting that market share early on means you're the most liquid, and there's just reflexivity there. Yeah. So the marketing. Marketing dollars will be spent, plus you can charge a higher fee. Right.
01:00:30.588 - 01:00:46.664, Speaker C: You assume it's going to be a gradual race to the bottom on fees, but early on, every dollar of Aum in these ETF's is going to be a lot more valuable than a dollar of value in other ETF's because these are going to be able to charge a much higher kind of management fee on top.
01:00:47.324 - 01:00:57.304, Speaker E: No, I definitely think it showed how out of position a lot of people work. I feel like right before this happened, like, the narrative was, like, pretty peak bearish, especially with, like, the e future stuff.
01:00:57.344 - 01:01:00.920, Speaker A: How are you positioned, Duncan? Weren't you? I thought you were bearish.
01:01:01.032 - 01:01:21.738, Speaker E: I closed my short after the. After we, like, nuked 10% that one day, like, a month ago. But I still have, like, a decent amount of cash and, you know, holding all the good money making coins. But it was fun to see. I'm always here for a green candle on bitcoin. Even if I'm short, I'm happy.
01:01:21.906 - 01:01:33.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it. I think, like, it's. It's clear that BTC obviously still runs the market, and people trying to make it seem like ETH or something can.
01:01:33.770 - 01:01:36.866, Speaker E: Yeah, the ETH futures thing is so. Such bad takes.
01:01:37.010 - 01:01:44.134, Speaker B: People want. People want BTC. Right. Like, and then that just has massive follow on effects for everything else, like.
01:01:44.474 - 01:01:55.954, Speaker A: All right, guys, I think that's a wrap. That's a good, good episode. Thanks, Matt, for coming. On and defending the honor of amms. Thought you handled yourself very well.
01:01:56.034 - 01:01:56.386, Speaker B: Cheers.
