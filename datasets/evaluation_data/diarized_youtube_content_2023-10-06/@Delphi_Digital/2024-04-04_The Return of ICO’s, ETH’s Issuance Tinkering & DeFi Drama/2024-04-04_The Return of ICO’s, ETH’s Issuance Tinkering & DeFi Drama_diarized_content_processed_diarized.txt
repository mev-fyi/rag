00:00:00.320 - 00:00:45.882, Speaker A: Set on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hi, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. I'm your host, Jose, and with me today, as always, I have Ceteris, Jan, and Duncan. But yeah, Echo is Kobe's new sort of like, investment club, like, crypto angel list platform, where. Yeah, for full disclosure, we at labs were incubating something like a competitor called Legion. And yeah, we spoke to Kobe about it, so we're aware.
00:00:45.882 - 00:01:27.686, Speaker A: But, yeah, I've used Echo. I think it's really cool. I think he's executing really well in it, and just given his, his brand and stuff, it's gonna be, it's going to do well. I guess my main sort of, like, interesting point about the model, and we'll be keen to hear your thoughts, is just, and this is the issue with icos too, with all this stuff, is the adverse selection problem. Right. Which is with investment clubs. You have this thing, okay, who are the users of investment clubs? Like, ideally, ideally, it's someone who's, like, super smart, has a lot of alpha, but hasn't yet made it, and also has access to deals, but hasn't yet made it somehow.
00:01:27.686 - 00:02:24.300, Speaker A: And so they need extra capital to be able to maximize their allocations in these deals. And I guess the problem is there aren't that many of those people. Just by virtue of, if you're super smart and have alpha, you generally tend to make good money in this space, and then you don't really need external allocations. Um, and then at the same time, like, on the project side, I think, like, how are projects thinking about their rounds? They're thinking about them in terms of how do I maximize the, the sort of value add per dollar of capital invested in my round. Right. Um, so you want to get the highest value, like, VC's the highest value angels, and really try and get people that are going to work for their allocation, assuming your project's, like, popular and oversubscribed, and in that case, you don't really want to give allocation to. Well, this is my thesis.
00:02:24.300 - 00:02:49.604, Speaker A: I think it could be definitely proven wrong. But you don't really want to give allocation to an investment club, right? If I'm giving allocation to an angel, I want them to be fully incentivized themselves. I want to give the minimum I need to fully incentivize them. And if it's being diluted amongst a bunch of people. I don't know, then it kind of like defeats the, defeats the point. And yeah, obviously icos have, have similar issues but yeah. Curious to hear you guys like thoughts on this.
00:02:50.184 - 00:03:50.648, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully agree with everything you just said. I think there's some scenarios where it makes sense is through like distribution to like a wider audience and getting them in at a good price. It's kind of the whole idea of like, you know, tokens that almost do no VC raises or launch organically, like grassroots ones that launch at a really low price and do well over time. They build a super strong community because they've made a bunch of people wealthy. And then every one of those people is essentially just an agent of promoting that project, giving feedback. It's a massive distribution channel and you really see it when it's like, okay, a few vc's have made a lot on this or like, you know, thousands of people have made a lot on this and, or like even tens of thousands of people. So I think that where it could be cool is for distribution where obviously like you need a KYC and stuff.
00:03:50.648 - 00:03:53.480, Speaker B: Do you need to be an accredited investor to.
00:03:53.632 - 00:04:34.426, Speaker A: Yeah, you do. I guess the, I guess the main thing like another point where making I should have probably made it clear is like, I think this is desperately needed. I don't think the status quo, I mean the status quo definitely benefits us is his Delphi ventures, but I don't think it's like optimal for this space. And basically the status quo is either projects do these private rounds that are by necessity cheaper because there's less people that can buy into them. And then eventually when they go public they're at multiples of, of that round, right. And realistically some VC's add a lot of value. You know, we think we're definitely one of them.
00:04:34.426 - 00:05:18.674, Speaker A: Others don't add that much value. And there's definitely angels that, that add a shitload of value and also random people that add a bunch of value. Like we've seen it in every community. The chainlink gods, the Thor maximalists, like the, there's these community members that come in and are MVP's and almost team members. And so I think the premise of one of these ICO platforms is that you can like basically maximize the utility per dollar of capital raised, right. You can try and get the people that are going to be most value add to come in and also like build a community, right? Like one thing that our Legion team says is like, yeah, your first ten employees make your project, your team culture and your first sort of like 100 community members make your community culture, right. So if it's a bunch of moon boys, you're probably screwed.
00:05:18.674 - 00:05:20.228, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:20.406 - 00:05:32.520, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's where like, obviously being in credit, investor prices out a lot of people from, from this platform, which I think that's just a regulatory thing. Like, you can't really get around that. It sounds like maybe Legion is.
00:05:32.632 - 00:05:38.824, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought that you actually thought that you didn't have to be for this. I thought that was echo.
00:05:38.984 - 00:05:39.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:39.832 - 00:05:54.462, Speaker A: I don't know for sure. I know I had to, I signed up. I had to answer a bunch of questions about like net worth and risk tolerance and stuff like this. I don't know what would have happened if. Yeah, I don't know. I assume you have to be after your credit. Maybe I'm wrong.
00:05:54.638 - 00:06:00.510, Speaker B: Is Legion. Do you have to be accredited to do like the ICos or how is that being.
00:06:00.622 - 00:06:14.358, Speaker A: No. Based on the license that Legion's. Legion's going for, you won't have to be credited, but you do have to exclude the US or do like Reg s, which has its own. Has its own things.
00:06:14.526 - 00:07:09.218, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think let's just pretend that everyone can invest in these discussions. Simple. I think obviously the biggest challenge, and you guys would be well aware of this and Kobe is also obviously well aware of this, is just the adverse selection point in that like all the most prestigious projects are still, regardless of regulations, going to want to raise from the most prominent VC's when they do angel rounds, they're going to want to hand pick the angels that they invite. They're not going to want to use some third party platform. And there's like this whole meme, right, where it's the guy who doesn't think and buys six figs of your token and leaves you alone. And then the guy who buys dollar ten is in your discord 24/7 like asking questions.
00:07:09.218 - 00:07:12.466, Speaker C: Right. And so, but those people can be.
00:07:12.490 - 00:08:04.044, Speaker B: Valuable, I guess, where I think it's interesting is like, yes, that's true. But there's also, I think a scenario where, and like the adverse selection is real. But I also think there's a scenario where it's like, okay, you do, you open up the seed round at like a very, you know, cheap price and you have some sort of reputation system on echo or something and you let like, you know, 1000 people invest like, you know, a few hundred bucks or something or however much you're trying to raise and then you essentially get in, you know, 1000 people at a really low price that, like, if it does, like, I think. I don't know. I think Monad raised at, like, low, like, tens of millions in their seed round, and, you know, they'll probably launch a multi billion dollar valuation. So it's like, that could be, you know, potentially 100 x. So, like, if you let.
00:08:04.344 - 00:08:18.490, Speaker C: No, let some of the launch pads have done this, like. But answers. Launchpad did this thing where it's like, you can buy $1,000 worth, max, and then as soon as it was traded, it was trading like 50 x. That.
00:08:18.682 - 00:08:19.082, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:19.138 - 00:08:23.354, Speaker C: And so it's just like a way to give a lot of people an easy win.
00:08:23.474 - 00:08:40.590, Speaker D: And launchpads are similar, but don't really get the benefits of targeting your user base. Right. That's like, launchpad is just a bunch of jeeps for the most part, whereas here you have a scenario where you can kind of hand pick. So that I agree with the adverse selection thing. It's kind of a question of. So there's a few moving parts.
00:08:40.622 - 00:08:41.126, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:41.270 - 00:09:09.470, Speaker D: Let's use, I guess, Ansem as an example. Do you. Do you give him a 50k aloe? So, yeah, let's say you have 250k that you'd go around to angels. Would you give five people 50 or would you do 250 to him? Right. And let's say it's a standard 20% of profit model. So, like, he gets 20% on the. On the other 200, he takes the 50 he takes, he gets 20% of profit on the other 200.
00:09:09.470 - 00:09:27.544, Speaker D: So depending on how high it goes, like, his exposure kind of changes above 50. But the trade off is you probably have a bunch of randos that. That are going to do, not going to do that much. Versus. Is it better to have, like, a targeted group of five people with much larger followings than the sum of the randos of the people?
00:09:28.404 - 00:09:47.016, Speaker B: But I think let's. Let's take that example. Okay, so Ansem has 50k. He gets two hundred k to, like, due to his echo group. You know, so you could get 400 people at $500 each. And, like, if Echo had some sort of, like, ranking, obviously, if it's just, like, random 400 people, you have no idea who they are, then I don't know.
00:09:47.040 - 00:10:09.704, Speaker A: But, like, well, you're outsourcing the whole thing of echo, I think. So, like, the. What you're describing is more. So the approach of Legion, like, what we're building is basically you want to have a reputation layer at the base layer that allows you to differentiate between different people, their value add, like, what they contributed to different projects, like D gen scores, like on chain metrics, like Twitter. The Twitter score, like GitHub commits.
00:10:09.744 - 00:10:10.696, Speaker D: Like, get a, get a feel for.
00:10:10.720 - 00:10:33.244, Speaker A: Who these people are, and then you can, like, hand select who you want to participate in your, in your sale. Right. And with, I feel like with, with Echo, what you're doing is basically outsourcing that to ansem. Right. In this case, like, rather than you handpicking each member, each. Per each participant, you say this influencer has a, has a really cool community. I want to just, like, tap into that.
00:10:33.244 - 00:10:39.556, Speaker A: And I think to the extent that these people do a good job, like, nurturing their communities and stuff, it could work.
00:10:39.740 - 00:10:47.492, Speaker D: There's like, just this hundreds of people in their thing. There's no way they're, they're, they're selecting. You know, they're being very kind of. Yeah.
00:10:47.668 - 00:11:00.756, Speaker C: With the entry, it is like, wait, do you want. I actually think it's. If you get Ansem's following because he has a massive following now, then you're gonna get a lot of, like, free marketing.
00:11:00.900 - 00:11:06.444, Speaker D: Yeah, but it's like, who's, like a bunch of people that are following with ten followers. Like, I know.
00:11:06.484 - 00:11:07.064, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:07.404 - 00:11:13.020, Speaker D: Or you get like five ansems each with a bunch of following and massive following and them being the megaphone.
00:11:13.092 - 00:11:59.022, Speaker B: So imagine having like 400 people, $500 each, but they all have, like, between 100 to 1000 followers on Twitter. It's like, that's some really good distribution. And, like, those people, you know, if you were to figure out the reputation around that and those people are, like, trying to grow their following and, like, that's a really strong community. And, like, some of them are really thoughtful, some of them are not. But, like, if you were able to hand pick or, like, have some reputation layer, like Josie's talking about where you put people who are just, like, on the come up, you know, maybe this is their first cycle, their first time in crypto, they don't want to invest too much money, but you give them a good deal and, like, they're active on Twitter trying to, like, you know, learn and build their following. You give them a good deal for like $500 to $1,000. That hundred x is, it's like, all of a sudden it's fifty k to one hundred k.
00:11:59.022 - 00:12:31.140, Speaker B: And you have 400 people that just got in on that. Like, you're going to get a ferocious community just like, literally constantly talking about this. I think if they are able to do that, and that's a hard thing to do, can they do that? Does Legion have a better chance of doing that with their model? I think that that's incredibly valuable because, yes, Ansem and five other guys might have, like, a big following on Twitter, but there's some problems with them. It's like, you know, they might already have a lot of money. Their communities could be, like, very similar. They're not going to, like, they have other investments, so they're not going to be focusing all their time on this. Like, these, like, 400 random people.
00:12:31.140 - 00:12:38.028, Speaker B: Like, you're going to get probably 100 of them who this is, like, really life changing money for them. And they're literally going to become, like.
00:12:38.076 - 00:12:45.580, Speaker D: Your project as your number gets large, like, they can't write. Like, their exposure also gets, you know?
00:12:45.612 - 00:12:49.660, Speaker B: I know. So that's what we were saying. Between $500 to $1,000. Yeah.
00:12:49.692 - 00:12:52.436, Speaker D: So it's not hundreds of people. Right? That's like tens of people.
00:12:52.540 - 00:13:17.560, Speaker B: Well, at two on the example you gave, you have a 2200k allocation to give to people. $500 for 400 people or 200 people at $1,000. I think that could, if it was successfully done and it would take a lot of time. But it's like, not only just the Twitter following, it's telling your friends about it. It's, you know, it's all these other things that, like.
00:13:17.632 - 00:13:18.284, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:19.064 - 00:13:31.704, Speaker B: Has, like, a big follower number on Twitter. Like, I don't know if he's worth, like, more than 100 people who you've just 50 or 100 x that are now, like, literally, like, dedicated the most.
00:13:31.784 - 00:13:43.064, Speaker A: The most, like, sort of fertile market segment for. This is basically like the big private rounds that projects do before they launch their token.
00:13:43.224 - 00:13:43.784, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:43.904 - 00:14:08.090, Speaker A: Like, that's really because I think the early stage stuff, you benefit you. You kind of just want a VC that'll give you money, stamp their brand on it. Ideally, if it's a brand name VC and then, like, leave you alone or at least, like, maybe introduce you to some people. You don't want a bunch of random people spamming all the time at the early stage. But once you, once you're getting closer to launch, like, projects are basically because there's no icos. They're doing these, like, discounted private rounds.
00:14:08.162 - 00:14:08.774, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:09.074 - 00:14:33.814, Speaker A: The exception maybe being Jupiter, they're doing these discounted private rounds and then going live with their token. And I think, like, rather than a discounted private round where you're giving it to, like, four or five vc's, that's where, like, the EV is definitely, for me, way higher in, like, distributing to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people in smaller size who can now all participate and basically capture that. That alpha instead is how I'm thinking about it.
00:14:33.894 - 00:15:14.038, Speaker B: And this is almost like a better way of doing an airdrop, where it's like, people have to put up capital so they feel more invested, more tied to it, you know, less likely to dump. You can put them on investing schedule. And also you get to make sure there's no, like, civils, like, because they have to attach to their identity in some way. And you get the, you know, a similar distribution if you were to do it at a private round or something. So I think that, like, this is just a much better way of doing an airdrop. Right. Because, you know, you could get 100 real people with, like, a few hundred followers and, like, you know, actual people, or you could get 100 of Sisyphus wallets, and it's just one guy who's not going to tweet about your project.
00:15:14.038 - 00:15:21.550, Speaker B: He might be like, oh, drew, go up and just dump his entire stack. But it's like, what would you rather have in terms of, like, this?
00:15:21.582 - 00:15:25.514, Speaker A: Also much harder to Sybil. Like, much harder to Sybil and Ico.
00:15:26.654 - 00:15:28.022, Speaker B: Yeah. Than this.
00:15:28.078 - 00:15:53.694, Speaker A: So I think it's. I think it's, like, very promising, I think. And I think, like, there is clearly market demand for this. To me, like, the pendle yt craze and, like, meme coins and the pre sales and stuff, to me, that's all. Like, people want to get into stuff earlier and feel like they have a fair, fair shake. I don't know if you become an ICO platform right now. Like, that's their main.
00:15:53.694 - 00:16:02.166, Speaker A: I feel like business is just people who want to buy eigen layer or who want to buy, like, yeah, Athena, free market.
00:16:02.350 - 00:16:07.290, Speaker C: Yeah. No, I agree with your point that this makes most sense for, like, the late stage private.
00:16:07.442 - 00:16:12.514, Speaker D: It can actually scale, because otherwise, it doesn't really scale. There's just not enough capital.
00:16:12.674 - 00:16:14.490, Speaker B: Yeah. This, I think, is for distribution.
00:16:14.602 - 00:16:15.294, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:19.354 - 00:16:34.946, Speaker A: All right. There's also, like, we, we touched in some of the pre show and, like, how this affects, like, funds as well. There's this adverse selection also kind of applies to funds. Right. At a certain size. I know paradigm announced, like, their $750 million fund. Obviously, the.
00:16:34.946 - 00:17:09.034, Speaker A: Those guys are one of the best in the space. But there is this, I think, adverse selection that also happens with larger funds, where you're basically, you're more incentivized on the management fee side than the performance side. Bigger funds drastically compress your performance, especially in this industry when there are that many opportunities to pin to and to some extent the really smart people, if they really have alpha or incentivized to just manage their own money or squad up with their friends like we did, and manage our own money together.
00:17:09.114 - 00:17:09.762, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:09.938 - 00:17:11.354, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you guys think of that?
00:17:11.474 - 00:17:57.512, Speaker D: No, definitely. I mean, I think if you look at the numbers, you know, in terms of the amount of vc dollars getting invested, if you look at, you know, the previous cycle. So how much money was going in 2021 22 and compare that to what it is now, it's night and day. Right. Part of it is the previous setup was a late zero interest rate phenomenon type of dynamic where there was always exit liquidity. Money was free, and so it was just growth at all costs and VC's, the softbanks and sequoias that were going to be writing these gargantuan checks. And so everyone before them was also comfortable investing because you knew that that money was coming in behind you.
00:17:57.512 - 00:18:42.206, Speaker D: And so once you had the big washout in liquid markets, the appeal of doing these nine figure rounds, not even like, or like high eight figure, low nine figure rounds, still happens, but to a much, much smaller degree if you kind of look at what the trends have been. And so, which makes sense. Right. And it bodes well for us as well, where we kind of focus on the early stage and it's part of an edge there. And it's great because now teams are also really focused on doing that earlier stage and then trying to go liquid afterwards. So I think it's a much harder market to invest as a larger fund now. The returns aren't there.
00:18:42.206 - 00:18:47.230, Speaker D: And we've also yet to see what the reckoning is of these unlocked.
00:18:47.262 - 00:18:47.406, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:47.430 - 00:19:30.718, Speaker D: We've harped on this a bunch, but it's especially relevant now because what a lot of the funds and this happened before was reinvesting on paper gains. Right. You're not actually realizing anything. There's no, there's no actual realization. It's just markups and raising on markups. And so I think with crypto, we've seen a lot less of the nine figure raises, and so we'll kind of see what happens. I think there's probably going to be some level of reckoning where narrative can't really offset the increase in new supply and the venture stage, crypto ventures, really the edge is kind of always been in the early stage, but even more so now.
00:19:30.718 - 00:19:48.070, Speaker D: And so it's tough. Like we've, we've thought about trying to go with a larger fund, but ultimately decided against it for, you know, a whole host of reasons, but. But one of them is certainly just the. The massive alpha decay, and you're just playing kind of a different game.
00:19:48.222 - 00:19:50.718, Speaker B: Yeah, because, like, I guess with crypto.
00:19:50.766 - 00:19:50.926, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:50.950 - 00:20:05.224, Speaker B: Like, the really good deals that we've seen are, like, these pre seed and seed rounds where there's only a certain amount of allocation. And if someone has, like, you know, a multi billion dollar fund, it's almost always better to, like, do that.
00:20:05.304 - 00:20:10.456, Speaker A: They can't spend the time. They can't spend the time to dd it and stuff for that because it's.
00:20:10.480 - 00:20:11.752, Speaker B: Like a nothing burger to them.
00:20:11.848 - 00:20:19.496, Speaker D: It's too, like, they just. In order to deploy that much money, if they were to do it early stage, they'd have hundreds of. Hundreds of porcos.
00:20:19.520 - 00:20:19.632, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:19.648 - 00:20:22.620, Speaker D: And so you kind of assume it's just money and nothing else.
00:20:22.752 - 00:20:50.080, Speaker B: Yeah. And then also, I guess on this point, a question from my end is. So I think, like, a 16 z raised, like, a 3 billion or three and a half billion dollar fund kind of last cycle in, like, 2021 or 2022. When do they start collecting management fees on that? Is it, like. Cause obviously there's gonna be capital calls and stuff, but is it, like, the second they raise the fund or, like, as they call the capital and deploy it? What is. How does that work? No, it's.
00:20:50.112 - 00:20:52.736, Speaker D: You collect management fees on committed capital.
00:20:52.920 - 00:20:59.608, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So. And then the committed capital is probably based on, you know, how quickly you can deploy it is. How quick?
00:20:59.656 - 00:21:12.364, Speaker D: Well, no, it's like, what's been all down is what I. So you say I'm in. I'm into this fund for a million bucks. I'm starting to charge a management fee on that, but I'll. For, you know, for 200.
00:21:13.344 - 00:21:19.598, Speaker B: Yeah. But then the carried interest is only now, you understand, upon selling.
00:21:19.766 - 00:21:20.758, Speaker D: Yes, exactly.
00:21:20.846 - 00:21:35.726, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's not when they actually deploy the deals, it's just. But do they have, like, I think that I've heard that there's. There's some guidelines or restrictions around, like, you need to deploy x amount by this date.
00:21:35.910 - 00:21:43.266, Speaker C: Well, yeah, if you're charging on the entire amount, then you think about it. You could, like, sit on the first capital call for, like, two years.
00:21:43.430 - 00:21:44.214, Speaker B: I know.
00:21:45.034 - 00:21:46.614, Speaker A: Deployment period. Yeah.
00:21:47.274 - 00:22:21.314, Speaker B: So if there's deployment periods. Right. Like, it creates this weird incentive structure where it's like, okay, there may not be enough good deals to actually take this amount of money. So what we're doing is just bidding up rounds so we can fit in more money to, like, reach our deployment schedule doing rounds that, like, you know, we think are good, but, like, not the best just to deploy those money. So that's where they kind of, the adverse selection comes. Like, I think a three and a half billion dollar fund is a lot to even in.
00:22:21.934 - 00:22:41.464, Speaker D: Part of the other reason why they won't draw it down immediately is, you know, the main calcs are a function of when the money was called down. Right. So if you basically call the money down and don't deploy it, it really reflects poorly on your return calculations because the drag on performance.
00:22:42.524 - 00:22:46.420, Speaker B: I'm wondering, like, they might still be deploying that if they raise that in 2022.
00:22:46.492 - 00:23:16.924, Speaker D: Yeah, there's. If you look like. Yeah, if you look at the numbers, crypto rank has a site that has pretty good, like, monthly distribution, and you'll see, like, that the vals, or rather the amount, um, raised per month is basically, uh, it's kind of hovered between, like, 501 and a half, rather the amount, like, deployed into deals. But the. The deal count has kind of gone up. So you're seeing, you know, deals. Deal count's gone up, but deployable capital hasn't.
00:23:16.924 - 00:23:27.242, Speaker D: So just more early stage stuff. And it's something we've seen as well. There's. There's only been a handful of these larger rounds that have really kind of happened.
00:23:27.348 - 00:23:56.714, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess that's, like, for some of our listeners, it's like, kind of be careful about, like, if you want to get. Because there's all these crazy returns in crypto VC, and it's just like, you know, be careful about giving money to these, like, crypto VC funds and, like, really do your diligence, because this problem definitely exists on these kind of mega funds because there's, like, really not enough good deals to deploy that level of capital, especially if there's time pressure around the deployment period or, like, for them.
00:23:57.094 - 00:24:02.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Andreessen's pretty smart. They have, like, a very long time horizon for this stuff.
00:24:02.102 - 00:24:02.430, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:02.502 - 00:24:06.366, Speaker A: And they've made. They have some good stuff in there in their portfolio.
00:24:06.510 - 00:24:24.346, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm not meaning to, I'm just more, like, calling, like, I'm just kind of pointing to them because, you know, picking on them because they have, you know, they're obviously having an incredible track record and stuff, but still, nonetheless, like, three and a half billion or so to deploying crypto is difficult, for sure.
00:24:24.450 - 00:24:35.614, Speaker A: All right, we had one last thing on the docket, which was ETH issuance. I, like, read through a little bit beforehand, but I honestly don't have a great take, I assume, ceteris. You do?
00:24:36.394 - 00:24:51.574, Speaker C: I can like give the, I can give you like the TLDR. Basically, there's discussion in changing the ETH issuance curve reasoning. Is that so? They don't want the stake rate to get too high because there's a lot of like negative extra externalities with that.
00:24:52.154 - 00:25:00.202, Speaker B: Um, is there a quick example you could give up that, like, why is it bad when there's too much?
00:25:00.338 - 00:25:01.674, Speaker C: What I was about to do, Duncan.
00:25:01.714 - 00:25:04.234, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. I thought you were going to move on to the next thing.
00:25:04.314 - 00:25:06.762, Speaker C: Oh, okay. There's this.
00:25:06.898 - 00:25:07.330, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:07.402 - 00:25:37.162, Speaker C: Okay, so basically, first of all, ETH has made this big push on like making ETH money. Right? And so the high, the more people at stake, the more ETH is issued. And so you have like a bigger tax on non stakers. Okay. And that is seen as like a bad, making ETH more expensive to hold just as like native ETH and not as a staking representation. It seems like detrimental to the, to the moneyness of it. Okay.
00:25:37.162 - 00:25:43.854, Speaker C: To like the money thesis. And so that's kind of one of the side effects. Another side effect is.
00:25:44.704 - 00:25:49.448, Speaker D: So if you think about, I guess, should we? Because it's going to be hard to, like, remember.
00:25:49.576 - 00:25:50.720, Speaker C: True. We can talk about that.
00:25:50.752 - 00:26:23.712, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's like massively overblown. So part of, part of it is the idea is like you're taxing those that don't participate at an increased rate because with ETH, issuance goes up as more stake. But it's not that much like we're talking about relatively negligible amounts of issuance. And so I think, like directionally, that's correct. But the magnitude of it is so muted that it really doesn't make sense for me as an argument that it's like taxing the non stakers if the group gets the stake.
00:26:23.768 - 00:26:55.586, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think that one's the strongest one. The strongest argument, which I guess I can go to now, is so ETH doesn't have like in protocol delegation. Right. And so if you're a retail staker, you're either going to be a solo staker, which is not really retail. It's like sophisticated individual, I would say. Otherwise you're just going to buy like a liquid staking token or something. Right.
00:26:55.586 - 00:27:14.772, Speaker C: And so if you don't stop the incentivization of stake, what you're going to have happen is more and more ETH is going to be staked and then more and more ETH is going to be staked in like liquid staking protocols or LRT protocols. Right. And then these protocols end up becoming like too big to fail. And Ethereum now is now dependent.
00:27:14.828 - 00:27:19.052, Speaker B: They're already too big to fail. Lido is too big to fail.
00:27:19.108 - 00:27:25.916, Speaker C: Well, Lido's declining now because the LRT's are taking its market share. Right? Like Lido's under 30% now.
00:27:26.060 - 00:27:33.100, Speaker B: I think that if Lido were to have a bad issue, they would definitely do something.
00:27:33.132 - 00:27:39.900, Speaker C: Well, this is the point. This is like, so if you think it's already too big, then sure. But like this is the rationale for why they don't want it getting too.
00:27:39.932 - 00:27:48.060, Speaker A: Big is because governance of Lido and governance of Lido and Eigen layer would effectively be. The governance of Ethereum is like the other issue that they point out.
00:27:48.092 - 00:27:48.716, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:27:48.780 - 00:28:36.130, Speaker C: And then if you think about it too, like if everybody stakes, then the real yield to everyone is zero, but there's still risk in staking because you still get slashed and everything. And so what that also incentivizes is people just to chase other external yields, which is why you get all the LRT stuff and people will start chasing like more yields with those. And so that's like, in my opinion, that's the biggest side effect that I think has merit to it. Another one was around like solo stakers. If you think about like solo stakers, they're probably not too swayed by the yield they're getting because a lot of them are just kind of like die hard. They're passionate about this, they do it as a hobby. But if you think about the institutional staker, they only really care about yield.
00:28:36.130 - 00:29:31.624, Speaker C: And so if you reduce yields, you are not going to really reduce the solo staking amount, but you will reduce the institutional demand for it, in a sense. Um, so yeah, there's been these proposals to like change the curve. Uh, there's like this hard fork coming up, and so that's kind of the time to do it. There's been a ton of pushback in the ETH community. I think that the ETH community is kind of insecure about the way bitcoiners have always framed them, changing the issue and schedule all the time. And since they have been making this massive moneyness push, there's a lot that don't want to touch it anymore for the rest of the protocol and just leave it as it is. And there's also, I don't know if the argument is necessarily overwhelming enough to change it, because you can always kind of tinker with something and you can always change the monetary policy all the time.
00:29:32.324 - 00:29:34.788, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it makes sense, like.
00:29:34.956 - 00:30:21.398, Speaker D: Yeah, just to go back. So in terms of, like, the. It's all trade offs, right. So you can make arguments both ways, and there's nothing that's absolute. But, yeah, I'm pretty heavily in the camp that it doesn't really make sense to lower it because way back when we pushed that it would make sense to raise it, this was, like, in 2019, but that was more so an issue of kind of financial sustainability relative to the costs that were needed to operate to be a validator. And so that there. It makes sense when there's, like, an existential issue with having the economics actually be profitable.
00:30:21.398 - 00:31:01.362, Speaker D: But here, the LRT stuff is going to happen either way, adjusting this yield won't change that dynamic because the yield itself is so small that the amount of boost you get with the LRT tokens, everything else makes a material difference. And so I think those would exist either way. And I agree, it's kind of bad for narrative. And, yeah, I think the institutional point is a very good one, too, where part of the sound money ness is this. I think that narrative takes a big hit and you certainly lose a lot of demand in exchange for, you know what.
00:31:01.418 - 00:31:07.594, Speaker B: Really interesting, bro. No, I agree. Yeah, I think that makes sense.
00:31:07.714 - 00:31:19.716, Speaker A: I don't know when I initially, I hadn't really looked into it, and I was firmly on the side of don't fuck the with it. After reading the arguments from the researchers, I felt like they were actually, like, pretty convincing.
00:31:19.820 - 00:31:20.748, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're.
00:31:20.836 - 00:31:48.744, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. My main, like, counter argument to it is I think all that shit happens anyway. Even if you lower the yield, like, that's the thing. People will still, if anything, they'll chase more. You know, if you lower the yield, they'll go chasing LRT's and. And all sorts of stuff more. And you're really just trying to deal with the fact that, like, ETH was designed to optimize for this, like, solo stake or utopia.
00:31:48.744 - 00:32:01.000, Speaker A: And you literally now have Lido, and, like, if you look at staking protocols, and so it's just like, yeah, so much engineering effort went into, like, solo staking. Right.
00:32:01.032 - 00:32:19.962, Speaker C: And, yeah, so my. I've always had this take on the solo staking thing. And from, like, a philosophical standpoint, I totally. I get it. I respect people who, like, feel strongly about this, but you are designing for a world that doesn't exist. Right. And you are just.
00:32:19.962 - 00:32:48.234, Speaker C: You're making, like, a conscious trade off decision to design for something that will never exist. And you do kind of see a lot of the downsides of that. Personally, I think that val do. Being a validator is something that should be left to professionals. It's like a hard service that requires a lot of attention. And I don't think individuals should solo stake. I mean, they can if they want, if they're like a crazy hobbyist.
00:32:48.234 - 00:32:59.804, Speaker C: You still have people on Solana, even with the hardware requirements, that are like super diehards that still do it. Right. And so those people are going to do it regardless of how much it kind of costs.
00:33:00.344 - 00:33:00.704, Speaker B: So.
00:33:00.744 - 00:33:01.324, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:04.064 - 00:33:11.004, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm curious to see where this goes, who wins this political battle.
00:33:11.744 - 00:33:27.764, Speaker C: Yeah, well, they already slowed down. They already slowed down the churn rate, so that stake can't. And a lot of people were pissed about this when they did it too. That state can't grow as fast over the next couple of years.
00:33:28.624 - 00:33:31.336, Speaker A: I don't quite know what that means, but it sounds.
00:33:31.400 - 00:34:05.580, Speaker C: Well, to enter and exit being a validator, there's like a queue that you have to work through. And they just made longer. Okay, because. Because, like, the amount staked went up super fast after Shanghai, like, way faster than a lot of people expected. And so there's kind of like this panic of, oh, shit. If we don't change this soon, Lido is gonna have, like, 80% of stake in a year, which was a bit overblown. But one thing too, on the lido thing, seeing them go in lido, the lido thing, whatever the liquid staking thing is.
00:34:05.580 - 00:34:50.196, Speaker C: So they're kind of like fixing, quote, unquote fixing the lido problem, but they're replacing it with these lrTs. And so it's like, objectively a more risky product to have because you have these. Because an LST versus an LRT is a completely different product. Like, an LRT is an underwriter of AV's risk. Like, you're selling, you're creating, and they're all different. Like, you're creating your own, like, products of risk and yield, and you're making conscious decisions of. So what happens when one LRT is just, like, max Djen yield and just goes for the highest yielding stuff, and then another LRT takes a more, like, diversified approach to get a lower yield, maybe less risky.
00:34:50.196 - 00:35:19.288, Speaker C: And like, you know, where does capital go? This is, these are like, the new incentives now versus an LST is not making any conscious decisions. It's just staking. Right? They're not, they're not actually doing any, like, an LRT is a much more active participant in that sense. And so you're replacing the vanilla LST with. With now these, like, lrts. And so you're fixing the lido problem, but you're making a worse problem, potentially.
00:35:19.336 - 00:36:03.168, Speaker A: And it's just like one letter different, but it's actually entirely different set of risks that aren't even, like, fungible with each other. But, all right, we had a good episode where I think we're going to skip Altcoin corner, right, because it already went on kind of long. But just imagine duncan shilling banana and synapse, uh, or listen to one of the previous episodes. I have been, uh, prohibited from shilling Athena on this podcast, but we'll start with a derivative topic of the maker ave drama caused by, uh, Athena. So who wants to start there? Maybe we can. Maybe someone can, like, set the stage and give some context on what happened, I think.
00:36:03.216 - 00:36:51.184, Speaker C: Um, so, yeah, if you take a step back, the launch of Athena caused yields to rise all throughout DeFi. Right, because Athena started putting on this delta neutral trade, and the yield on the stable coin was, like, 40 plus percent organic. And then also all these incentives. And so it caused stable coin yields just everywhere to go up. Because if you could borrow Dai at like, 5%, people just borrow Dai, you know, take it, put it into athenas. And, you know, by nature, this just kind of, like, raises all yields, like, across everywhere. And so more recently, so that's kind of, like, the backdrop of the impact Athena has had on yields.
00:36:51.184 - 00:37:07.994, Speaker C: And now recently, Maker has done this whole endgame thing, right, where Maker has always been this very conservative, like, boring protocol for a while. Like, it was only backed by USDC. Then they started doing this RWA stuff, like t bills and everything.
00:37:08.154 - 00:37:28.824, Speaker A: Yeah, when they started off, they were pretty. They were. They were pretty avant garde. Like, yeah, maker was my first altcoin back in 2018. And, like, yeah, it was. It just they got, I think rune leaving, like, solidified them more and more over time. But, yeah, okay, keep going.
00:37:29.524 - 00:37:57.974, Speaker C: But, yeah. So anyways, they're doing this whole end game thing, and they're trying to make, like, toss a bunch of, like, incentives on the protocol and everything. They're really trying to get die. Like, they. They scaled die relatively conservatively, I would say, over the last few years, and now they're kind of going full force on it. And they're also trying to, like, product, like, own different parts of the stack. Right.
00:37:57.974 - 00:38:38.306, Speaker C: So they have this spark lending thing that's like this money market that competes directly with, like, Aave and others. And so the recent drama is that maker has decided to allow Athena stablecoin to be used as collateral to take out Dylons. Right. And so now Dai has some of its backing with this delta neutral synthetic dollar. I'll call it. I'm not going to call it stable coins like synthetic dollar. And so this caused a lot of uproar because it does fundamentally change Dai's model a bit, from being backed from.
00:38:38.306 - 00:39:10.714, Speaker C: By like, t bills, USDC, and like, ETH, predominantly, to now relying on this other new dollar. And so Ave responded by a pretty aggressive tactic where they. I don't know if it's gone through yet, but it seems that it has full support of the, of the team, that they're gonna turn, like, they're gonna change LTV to like, 0% and not allow Dai to be used as collateral on their platform anymore.
00:39:10.894 - 00:39:13.298, Speaker B: I didn't even know that happened because.
00:39:13.346 - 00:39:15.370, Speaker C: Of no prep for this.
00:39:15.482 - 00:39:16.894, Speaker B: It was on the ducket.
00:39:19.154 - 00:39:20.738, Speaker D: I don't think it's gone through yet, though.
00:39:20.866 - 00:39:39.596, Speaker A: It hasn't. Well, I think there's two. Yeah, the. Yeah, I think, uh, relations between Aave and Maker have definitely been worsening. Right. They were like very close partners, but then I think maker launching Spark was a big, was a big hit.
00:39:39.740 - 00:39:40.380, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:40.532 - 00:40:09.338, Speaker A: Stani posted. After they launched, like, they said they developed this new primitive, and Stani said it was a four kava and also went against some deal they had made previously. So that caused a lot of hate. And then I think their issue with this was not so much the deployment, because they've only deployed like 100 mil of DAi, but the forum posts basically authorized up to a billion right. Of Dai to be. To be allocated to this. And so far they've only deployed 100.
00:40:09.338 - 00:40:40.164, Speaker A: And they're going to be pretty conservative. Like, I think Maker in general has like, one of the best risk teams in Defi. So that's, that's, I think, part of the FUD. And then there's also this, like, related bud that mark posted today. Right. About how Maker is basically just like, pocketing this Athena yield and not really passing it on to DSR holders, and at some point die, like, the DSR holders will just go direct to Athena.
00:40:40.504 - 00:41:23.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, so another thing too is. Yeah, so Maker and Aave did have this partnership for a while, but this is a trend you're seeing in Defi, something that you could kind of see from like two years ago, that all these DeFi protocols are trying to own all these different products. And so Ave launched their own stable coin that competes with Dai. Dai launched their own money market curve has launched their own stable coin. Right. And they're all like going after the same market now and then. Also, Maker chose Morpho to do this USDC, this Athena pool, which is again, using like a different competitor that's like a newer protocol.
00:41:23.590 - 00:41:33.474, Speaker C: And so I think that kind of, there's a lot of like, politics involved in this. It's not just like pure.
00:41:33.814 - 00:42:03.066, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't think you could do what, what maker is doing on Aave, though, because of the cross collateral model, right. It's just a much harder process to get things approved to through governance. Whereas Morpho Blue has this cool, like, isolated model. And you can also choose your parameters, right? Like, for instance, on Morpho, the Oracle price right now is. Is like hard coded to one, right? Which means that as you're levering up on these like 90 pools, hard coded.
00:42:03.090 - 00:42:04.178, Speaker B: To one for what?
00:42:04.346 - 00:42:16.770, Speaker A: For USD. So the Morpho thing is basically, Dai has put. Sorry, it doesn't. It does make sense given the risk analysis.
00:42:16.802 - 00:42:21.934, Speaker B: I think I remember when people hard coded ust to one.
00:42:24.714 - 00:43:05.452, Speaker D: I think the main reason it's. It's. It's beneficial is because when it's not, the second order effects of it not being hard coded make it actually so much more risky. Right. Because anytime there's even a mild risk of there being a DpEg here and DPEg being, you know, somebody selling into the curve pool and the price being off, what that kicks off in terms of reflexive sell off because, you know, you're borrowing stable against stable is far more catastrophic than kind of. Well, basically because it can get mildly. Peg can cause a big unwind.
00:43:05.452 - 00:43:15.324, Speaker D: It just makes the whole system unnecessarily risky. Whereas I think hard coding, it makes a lot of sense and then parameterizing elsewhere in terms of the amount of capital in there and other stuff.
00:43:15.624 - 00:43:16.364, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:16.824 - 00:43:41.516, Speaker A: Makers willing to hold. Makers just willing to hold it until a repeat. They've done their risk analysis. In that case, it makes it a much more attractive product. I think gearbox is offering the same thing, but it's just much tougher to. To sleep well, speaking as someone who's, who's done both. Like, it's just harder to sleep well on gearbox when, you know, it's like an oracle price.
00:43:41.516 - 00:43:55.164, Speaker A: Right, and you got licked on a. On a 5% move, basically, on. On USD. And, you know, the pools aren't that deep. And I think that was the other problem that that sort of mark had with what makeup is doing.
00:43:55.244 - 00:43:55.812, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:55.948 - 00:44:21.364, Speaker C: It's. You know, this was a big topic on Solana like four months ago, maybe the Msoul D peg and it's a bit different because it's a liquid staking token, but Sol lend just pegged the msoul price to the ratio of Sol that it could be redeemed for and margin fi used the free floating, free floating price.
00:44:21.484 - 00:44:22.144, Speaker B: And.
00:44:24.324 - 00:44:39.526, Speaker C: I mean, the problem with using the fixed price at least like in the MSL situation, is that there's always risk that a liquid staking token can get like a pretty bad exploit. And then if you don't liquidate, then like the whole entire protocol is kind of just screwed.
00:44:39.590 - 00:45:20.494, Speaker B: But yeah, I feel like that's kind of the tale where if there's an exploit, that's not necessarily like we've talked about Athena before on the podcast. But, you know, I think we kind of are all aligned. Even in a really bad scenario. You know, you're probably looking at like, plus the insurance fund, like maybe like a few percent, like, like that you don't get back on. Maybe get like, you know, high, not like 90% of your money back, like $0.90 on the dollar plus maybe like high $0.90 on the dollar in a really shitty scenario in terms of mechanics, but in terms of like, you know, a black swan hack or something, then that could obviously be a lot, a lot greater.
00:45:21.264 - 00:45:26.360, Speaker C: Yeah, but I guess for me, yeah, this is on makers like balance sheet, right? Using like.
00:45:26.552 - 00:46:23.190, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it would be useful because I know like a lot of people know what maker and now they are, but just like as a quick refresher, like the gave, you can deposit assets like Ethereum and then like borrow, you know, I don't know what the LTVs are, but something about like, you know, 70% of your Ethereum and like us dollars or, or like USDC or USDT. And then there's kind of all these different pools for a bunch of different assets. And kind of different assets have to get approved through governance to be borrowed against. And then there's kind of like an interest rate based on utilization and how much is borrowed. And then for maker they have their own kind of native stablecoin where it's backed by kind of a basket of different assets. And you know, as Jose was saying, they just added Usde into this, which you know, is super highly yielding to kind of make Dai more attractive.
00:46:23.190 - 00:46:30.062, Speaker B: But yeah, and they have there and all these different yield opportunities, but just as a bit of context, if people need it also.
00:46:30.198 - 00:46:36.438, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw today that synthetix is allowing it now to make to mint synthetix stable.
00:46:36.606 - 00:46:57.836, Speaker B: Yeah, so all the Defi apps are going to be competing with each other, but it's kind of interesting because it's like they all took different routes to get to ultimately, what would be the same thing. And I think, you know, someone who's done this really well is honestly Frax. Like, they, I think he's like very methodical. Like, from the beginning, Frax was just like the.
00:46:58.020 - 00:47:01.464, Speaker C: Yeah, but Frax doesn't seem like it has market share in like any.
00:47:01.804 - 00:47:24.948, Speaker B: I know, because they were focusing on, on the stable coin in the beginning and that is kind of how they thought. Like once you have like a distributed stable coin, then you can kind of build these other products on it easy, like more easily versus like, you know, the other way around where like Ave built the lending market first and then is adding on the stablecoin or curve, you know, both. The Dex first and then is adding on the stable coin. So it's cool to see them all kind of converge.
00:47:25.076 - 00:47:42.878, Speaker A: I personally hedge fund, like, that's the thing that this, a lot of people have been saying, oh, maker, maker is now a hedge fund or whatever. And to me it's the, like always has been meme, you know, like the, these things have always been hedge funds. Like maker reallocated to treasury bills in the bear.
00:47:42.966 - 00:47:43.526, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:43.670 - 00:47:57.078, Speaker A: It's just, I think Athena is a better hedge fund, or at least a higher risk adjusted yield. It's definitely less decentralized the maker, but. Yeah, and then the other thing, I'm curious. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:47:57.206 - 00:48:01.966, Speaker D: It's more just the economics of it.
00:48:01.990 - 00:48:02.554, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:04.214 - 00:48:10.766, Speaker D: You can classify them as hedge funds, you can also classify them as banks. They're just borrowing at one rate for.
00:48:10.790 - 00:48:12.594, Speaker B: The sake of our industry, please.
00:48:12.894 - 00:48:39.356, Speaker D: No, they're same business model. They're borrowing at one cost and yielding a different one. And so it's just like a net interest margin business. And that's kind of what you're starting to see. Issues come up on the maker side. Right? It's like, why should I deposit Dai into DSR and then be the recipient of the shit yield and allow the.
00:48:39.460 - 00:48:43.092, Speaker B: Protocol to explain what the DSR is quickly for.
00:48:43.228 - 00:49:29.956, Speaker D: Yeah, so Dai savings rate, basically it's a yield that depositors of Dai can receive. And you can think of it same way, you deposit cash into a bank and then they take that cash and do something else that earns a higher yield and pass through very little to you. Right. So it's directionally similar. And so in the same way that people are waking up and saying, why should I collect ten basis points in my checking account when I can put it in a money market? Similar dynamic here, where why should I kind of deposit into DSR? You can argue that, um, like, the risks are slightly different, but I think, you know, the magnitude of the yield probably doesn't offset.
00:49:30.060 - 00:49:37.304, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, roughly how much their collateral is earning and then how much they're paying on the DSR. Not quite.
00:49:38.164 - 00:49:40.764, Speaker C: They're paying 50 now. They raised it a little while ago.
00:49:40.804 - 00:49:42.676, Speaker B: It was five, earning like this.
00:49:42.700 - 00:49:44.820, Speaker C: The thing is that is that it's only on a.
00:49:44.852 - 00:49:46.928, Speaker B: It's only on a small percentage of the die, right.
00:49:47.036 - 00:49:51.164, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. That they're earning other places.
00:49:51.464 - 00:50:22.452, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I think what is interesting is, like, makers started off as, like, oh, like, ETH was collateral, and so it's like, people can go deposit ETH and then, you know, create this stable coin out of it. And then that was like, you know, attractive to a lot of people to kind of have this, like, ETH based stable coin. Like, people are saying, oh, this is, like, decentralized stable coin. Like, seems be massive. Like, for crypto, this is what's needed. And then it's just kind of, like, morphed into, as Yana saying, the same business model as a bank just kind of chasing this.
00:50:22.452 - 00:50:27.676, Speaker B: This net interest margin and these higher yields. So it's now, like, not decentralized at all.
00:50:27.860 - 00:50:34.916, Speaker D: It's like a USDC wrapper. Right? So it started shifting away from that original ethos pretty early on.
00:50:35.060 - 00:50:35.364, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:35.404 - 00:50:49.682, Speaker C: It still has a lot of centralization vectors, but it is a lot more distributed. And what those are versus when it was purely USDC for a while. Right. So now they have, like, t bills, rwas, they're doing this Athena thing.
00:50:49.778 - 00:50:50.818, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:50.866 - 00:50:55.746, Speaker C: I don't know. There's, like, much more to say on this little feud or spat.
00:50:55.890 - 00:51:30.120, Speaker A: No, I think it'll be interesting to hear it. Get you guys thoughts on maker, because I personally, again, like, it was my first all coin. I haven't held maker since 2018. And, like, it's. It's a decent sized position now, and I just feel like, yeah, the end game plan. I don't know if anyone has taken the time to read through the sort of testaments that Rune writes up for the forums periodically, but those are really good. And the podcast he did on blockworks was actually really good, like the Empire pod that he did with Jason and Santi.
00:51:30.120 - 00:52:22.424, Speaker A: And I just feel like it makes a lot of sense splitting up maker into these highly incentivized subdaos with tokens, rebranding the whole maker system. Like, they're working with top branding agencies and marketing companies to like literally rebrand the entire maker system. Give it one brand rather than like these two. Like Makerdao and Dai thinking about that, redenominating the token so it's gonna have a new ticker, a new chart, you know, like get rid of this like old token sort of bias that people have these days. And then just like launching a bunch of tokens around this from the subdivisions that are all. Yeah, I mean, that are all like going to be able to be pretty synergistic, I think, and also just make the governance less heavy on the maker side. Yeah, I don't know.
00:52:22.424 - 00:52:34.110, Speaker A: I think the plans make a lot of sense. And I'm also like, since Rune came back more active, I just feel like they move so much quicker and it just shows like the power of having a founder still active in the, in the protocol.
00:52:34.142 - 00:52:34.286, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:34.310 - 00:53:11.526, Speaker A: Like, founders just founder energy just like gets shit done. And since he's come back, like, even the speed at which they did the risk analysis and stuff on Athena, like, to be first to market on this, like, maker would never, would never have been first to something like this, like before. Right. And now they are and it's like, I don't know, it's still like, you know, I think there's like, what, 5 billion die circulating. It has a big brand already. Like, I don't know, I think it's in a pretty good, pretty good spot as like an actual. It's the only, like, yeah, I mean, there's others, but at scale, it's the biggest.
00:53:11.526 - 00:53:13.914, Speaker A: Decentralized, like truly decentralized, stable coin.
00:53:14.694 - 00:53:15.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:15.222 - 00:53:59.986, Speaker D: As I also have a decent maker position, I mean, it's one of those probably where you just don't even need to mid curve it. You can kind of look under the hood and try and figure out how high you think it can run was one way in the same way stock splits favorably impact stock prices. Like unibiases is even more of a thing in crypto. And so that is certainly going to be a catalyst. Even though it's already telegraphed. I think there's that element, um, from like a fundamental perspective, it's, it's, it's, it's not like super cheap, right. But it's still pretty good.
00:53:59.986 - 00:54:38.584, Speaker D: Uh, it's trading I think like 20 ish times earnings. The tricky thing is, you know, yes, their revenues crank up, but, um, eventually you kind of expect the, the cost to also ramp up. Right. As people decide, I don't really want to lend to you at 15, I'd rather either go elsewhere. All, which means they need to raise rates to attract the same amount of capital, which kind of squeezes their profitability. So you'll have that on the subdao stuff. I think that makes sense for sure in terms of governance and being able to move swiftly and having a deeper focus on certain areas.
00:54:38.584 - 00:55:01.544, Speaker D: The counter, I guess, is that it cannibalizes some value from maker because now you have new tokens. But you know, it's kind of like a. It's the. The value of those tokens is still embedded in maker until those are out. Right. Because you assume some of them will be distributed to maker. So they're the way to kind of capture that upside right now.
00:55:01.544 - 00:55:05.908, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, I was looking through. I haven't really seen anything specific in.
00:55:05.916 - 00:55:07.444, Speaker A: Terms of how the thing maker chain.
00:55:07.564 - 00:55:07.868, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:07.916 - 00:55:10.410, Speaker A: Like, they've been doing a lot of research into that too.
00:55:10.532 - 00:55:32.870, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, I think in the grand scheme, you'll have a scenario where some of the parts is likely bigger than the whole with all of these new tokens. But you imagine maker post split will certainly take a dip as value accrues to the other tokens. But up until that point, all of the value in those tokens can only really be reflected in maker. So part of the thesis.
00:55:33.062 - 00:56:30.456, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and I think splitting into the subdivision, I don't know exactly what the plans are, but I think the thing we've seen really clearly in defi last cycle, and now again, this cycle is like, capital will go wherever yield is. And that's what really kind of gets things silly and juices return. And so last cycle it was like in the basis trade as well. Like in start of 2021, 50% to 60% for a few months on the basis trade. And like, a lot of capital went into that to kind of bring it down in the second half of the run up. And then like, obviously Luna, like, offering the 20% yield brought a lot of capital in like $18 billion. And then, like, now we're seeing it obviously an evolution and like a safer version with like, Athena tokenizing the basis trade, which was a big one last cycle.
00:56:30.456 - 00:56:35.222, Speaker B: And, you know, they've, what's Athena's tv all now? Like a couple billion?
00:56:35.318 - 00:56:36.310, Speaker D: I think it's over 2 billion.
00:56:36.342 - 00:56:36.974, Speaker A: I think.
00:56:37.134 - 00:57:12.938, Speaker B: Yeah, 2 billion. And then I. So I think that, you know, maker doing these subdaos, new tokens, they can incentivize more yield attract more capital. It's just kind of this constant fight between protocols on, you know, who has the most natural yield. And obviously, the basis trade is a great way to generate that, like, natural, real yield. But then it kind of evolves as the market, like, goes later and later stages into who can throw the most incentives at the yield to try and attack attract the capital. And that's when we just see, like, really silly rates and a lot of capital come in and, you know, some pretty crazy things happening.
00:57:12.938 - 00:57:50.006, Speaker B: Even an example of this, right, is Ruhn doing the basically on Roon or Thor chain. You can borrow against your bitcoin or ETH at a 50% LTV. So if you put in one bitcoin, it's worth 70,000 right now. You can borrow 35,000 USDC against it, and they give you a 0% interest rate and no liquidation. And so obviously that's just like a form of yield. And then what they do is they take your bitcoin, they sell it, and they buy root. That's like a very reflexive system to, like, attract capital and, like, really competitive rate, because you don't have to pay any funding to get leverage on your BTC.
00:57:50.006 - 00:58:13.842, Speaker B: And, you know, there's reflective dynamics there that's capped at 4% of ruins. Fdv. If that were to expand beyond 4%, I could see it being a problem. At 4%. I think it's probably all right, but it's just like these different protocols all trying to fight for this capital and giving more and more attractive deals, because that's what we've kind of seen in crypto, like, capital flows to where the highest yields are.
00:58:13.938 - 00:58:41.562, Speaker C: Yes. So basically it's like, where. How do you get exposure to the best, like, risk adjusted yield as all these, you know, other things are juicing it up. And so I think that's part of, like, mark from Ave's thing with die is he doesn't like now how die has exposure to. And I mean, Athena is a lot different scenario than, like, Thor chain, for instance. Thor chains is not. It's like an insolvent by design design.
00:58:41.698 - 00:58:47.514, Speaker B: But it's fine right now. But I could see it getting bad. I think it's potential to get really.
00:58:47.554 - 00:58:50.686, Speaker D: Bad, but it's only if you really raise them 4%.
00:58:50.870 - 00:59:01.086, Speaker C: Sure, but it's like. It's. My point on that is design is not sound. It doesn't work. It doesn't work at size, so it's not a sound design. Right. But, yeah, like.
00:59:01.086 - 00:59:09.914, Speaker C: But us, like, just like, playing USDC and, like a money market or something will rise because of this. Right. Because of all this stuff. And so.
00:59:10.214 - 00:59:34.374, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I just think, like, you know, for opportunities for people, like, looking at crypto, it's like, you know, there's a you. There's a lot of opportunities in these reflexive systems. Like, if you can kind of time them well, but also, like, have to be aware of their, their reflexivity because it works. It cuts both ways. Right. Like, things can get really crazy when market's going up and then things can get crazy when, when the market's going down.
00:59:34.374 - 00:59:42.230, Speaker B: So anyways, I just think that's going to be the driver that reinvigorates defi is just higher yield. It's like, literally as simple as that.
00:59:42.302 - 00:59:43.472, Speaker C: That's what it always is.
00:59:43.598 - 01:00:20.594, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's what it always is. And just the later you get into the cycle, the more crazy things people are doing, like throwing more tokens at it or, you know, taking on more risky designs. And so it's just something to, you know, be, be aware of and kind of watch it play out. And it's also a really good indicator for, like, where are we in this cycle? Like, when people start doing some really, like, designs that are not sound and, like they, you could see them going wrong or just like, throw, throwing silly amounts of tokens at it or just that get crazy. Those yields get crazy is kind of a pretty good indicator of fraud and also leverage buildup in the cycle.
01:00:20.594 - 01:00:36.950, Speaker B: Right. Like, the amount of leverage buildup that kind of, like, ust caused and then that had to unwind was a lot. And if you were kind of paying attention to that, you could see, like, a lot of things happen. Like, yeah, yeah.
01:00:37.062 - 01:00:57.774, Speaker A: Should we move on or people have more to say about this. Okay, cool. We've been told we're awkward with the goodbyes, so maybe we can all say goodbye this time. Thanks, everyone, for, thanks, everyone, for tuning in, and we'll see you again in two weeks.
01:00:57.934 - 01:01:04.574, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Follow me on Twitter like the real Alpha.
