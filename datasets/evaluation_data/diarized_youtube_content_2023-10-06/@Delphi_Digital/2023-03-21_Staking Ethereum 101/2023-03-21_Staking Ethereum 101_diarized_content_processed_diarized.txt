00:00:00.240 - 00:00:46.886, Speaker A: Hey guys, guys, did you know that the total amount of staked Ethereum is worth over $25 billion? That's more than the GDP of Iceland, but there's no way of unstaking it yet. It's completely illiquid. So why stake Ethereum in the first place? Staking provides network security, and the yield is an incentive to secure the ethereum network. As more ETH is staked, the yield goes down. As the price of ETH goes up, the dollar value of the yield also goes up. And if the level of activity on the blockchain goes up, yields are also likely to increase. From MEV and transaction priority tips while LSD providers have taken different approaches to solving the illiquidity problem, they all give the staker a new liquid token representing their staked ETH, handle the operational work of running a node, and allow small amounts of ETH to be staked at a time.
00:00:46.886 - 00:00:49.574, Speaker A: But they differ in how they distribute staking rewards.
