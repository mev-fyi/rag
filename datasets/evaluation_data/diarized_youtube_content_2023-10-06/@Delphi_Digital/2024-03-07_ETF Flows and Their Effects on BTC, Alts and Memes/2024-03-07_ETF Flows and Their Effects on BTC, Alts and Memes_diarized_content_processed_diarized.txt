This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. Today we have ceteris with us, who's head of Delphi Research, Duncan, who's our ventures associate. And stepping in for Jose is Jason, who's head of markets. Pretty exciting time to be in the space, to say the least, as we continue to approach all time highs, I think. Yeah.
00:00:45.988 - 00:01:05.994, Speaker A: Worth chatting about kind of markets now. And also how similar this looks to the late 2020 breach of VTC all time high, with the kind of initial rejection, a little bit of flush reaccumulation, and then a pretty strong push through.
00:01:08.414 - 00:01:25.446, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's literally doing the exact same. Right. I think we, like, hit twenty k and then same thing, instant sell. I don't know who these people are that are just, like, waiting, like, to hit all time high and just, like.
00:01:25.470 - 00:01:26.958, Speaker A: Waiting to sell confirm.
00:01:27.126 - 00:01:27.878, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:28.046 - 00:01:29.430, Speaker A: You mean that? Yeah.
00:01:29.542 - 00:01:31.854, Speaker B: Oh, no, I think that, like, goes.
00:01:31.974 - 00:01:41.154, Speaker A: A lot of it is. Especially with, like, funding rates where they were. I think they also had the coincidence of equities nuking. Right. As that happened.
00:01:42.494 - 00:01:57.600, Speaker C: Yeah, but triple tops don't exist, so there we go. I actually think triple top is like the, like, highest hit rate ta pattern ever. Like in crypto at least. Jason, if you want.
00:01:57.632 - 00:02:02.200, Speaker D: What do you mean? Like, sell off after the triple or, like, breakout break out?
00:02:02.352 - 00:02:08.600, Speaker C: Like, triple tops don't exist. Like, whenever I see a triple top, I always say there's no such thing as a triple top.
00:02:08.792 - 00:02:22.594, Speaker D: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, it look. Yeah, ceteris kind of said it. It looks exactly like 2020. Like, almost exactly. You think? I think even funding rates were kind of absurd in 2020 at the time as well.
00:02:24.094 - 00:02:26.278, Speaker C: They were never this high, though. This is the highest.
00:02:26.326 - 00:02:53.128, Speaker D: No, no, yeah, of course. But, like, relatively, like, back then, they were. They were elevated. I think one. I mean, the one thing I'm just looking at, and I kind of put a tweet out on this or whatever a while ago. The one thing that I just look out to confirm, like, if I want to be long, is, like, the Coinbase premium at this point, right? Like, Coinbase has always been important, but, like, it's going to be significantly more important now because it's like, honestly, the only domestic spot exchange that does any meaningful volumes.
00:02:53.176 - 00:02:53.360, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:53.392 - 00:03:20.784, Speaker D: It's super important for the ETF custody and ETF activity. So pretty much whenever Coinbase is trading at like an aggressive premium to like, binance is like pretty much been my hit rate to just like be long and just hold until that isn't the case anymore. I don't know if you guys are looking at the markets in a similar way, but it just seems like Coinbase and CME are only going to continue to get more important over time.
00:03:21.524 - 00:03:30.148, Speaker A: Its a good gauge of whos bidding, whether its retail or institutional. Its nuts to see the combination of Coinbase premium and funding this high.
00:03:30.276 - 00:03:43.984, Speaker D: Yeah, its hard for me to wrap my head around it, but the one thing that I always remembered from last market was funding rates were pretty elevated for like weeks and weeks at a time. Right?
00:03:45.124 - 00:04:29.016, Speaker A: I saw a good tweet on it, actually. There was. So they like, this guy broke out in this pc principle, basically broke out the days in 2021 where funding was above five bps. So every 8 hours, five bips, seven and a half and ten bps. And it was, you know, for bitcoin it was about like 25% of the time, 25% of the days, it was above ten bps every 8 hours. And so if you compare that to kind of what we've seen so far this year, it's actually been a lot more muted relative to like all of 2021, even just the distribution in the first three months or three months. So it's nuts like looking at that.
00:04:29.016 - 00:05:05.788, Speaker A: You know, the whole idea that funding can stay very high, and 2021 was a good example of that. I think part of it is just people over index to the annual rate and it's like all paying 100% in funding or whatever it might be. Obviously, 100% on majors is insane. But even mid double digits, it's not a prolonged thing. You get your periodic flushes. And so it's just comparing the cost of leverage versus the volatility, or what the expectation of volatility is locked in.
00:05:05.836 - 00:05:47.876, Speaker C: On, like derivative in some like dated futures. Like, there are ways to lock in. Obviously not for the full year. I think you can get like pretty good liquidity on like three months out to lock in that rate. I also think, like a big difference with, with the funding like, situation this year versus 2021 is like, I don't think there's really infrastructure set up in 2021 to do the basis trade well. And so, like, funding for that entire run, like that entire first part of the run was like 50% to 60%, just like consistently for months because there was an infrastructure to set up and do the basis trade. But I think a lot of that has come to the market now.
00:05:47.876 - 00:06:16.844, Speaker C: And so seeing funding at, I know this is again, the annualized thing, but yesterday or two days ago, it was like 100% and had been there for like three or four days on BTC, and like got up to some silly numbers on some of the meme coins, like 200, 300. So I think that that was just like we'd never seen. It was literally blackrock or the ETF just walked up the price like 5% every day for the past like two weeks and just. It was free money to long.
00:06:17.224 - 00:06:28.384, Speaker B: Yeah, this has been like pretty wild period. Like every day, 930 starts and you just get the twelve and it's like. And then it's on the other side. It's all these meme coins.
00:06:28.464 - 00:06:29.028, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:29.176 - 00:06:30.988, Speaker B: And even before going into.
00:06:31.116 - 00:06:32.436, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, so good, good.
00:06:32.580 - 00:06:40.996, Speaker B: No, I was just gonna say, like, even after that big flush, we. When we went from 69 to 60, like, the memes were bought back first, you know?
00:06:41.100 - 00:06:43.076, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what's happened, I was.
00:06:43.100 - 00:07:26.290, Speaker A: Gonna say like, what's, what's, what's, what's been nuts to see is I think the volatility has definitely been muted on a lot of the majors and especially kind of like bitcoin. I wonder how much of that is a function of not having these massive, massive discretionary crypto native funds just throwing disgusting amounts of money around. Like your three acs and your alamedas that were just putting on trades, trying to push pain when it was there in certain directions to exacerbate moves. It's noticeable that that's not really there. It's been a pretty steady, just with your expected volatility, but steady grind up from, from the lows.
00:07:26.402 - 00:08:06.874, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, because I think what's kind of happened, and I know you and I were talking about this the other day, but basically you have more like, of these institutional players just like a steady drip of capital into like BTC and you know, maybe ETH to some extent or the correlation there, but then you have all the people who have, like, survived from last cycle, just like their muscle memory just instantly goes into like dog coins and like the stuff that ripped the most last cycle. So it's kind of weird. Like, you skip a whole stage where it's like BTC is going up and then people go to the, like immediately the highest, like beta, highest torque thing that they remember from last cycle, which was like these memes and dog coins.
00:08:07.174 - 00:08:15.694, Speaker A: We had the, the l one and infra season in between, though, like TSA. A lot of these really ran, sold kind of in that bucket, but not.
00:08:15.734 - 00:08:42.676, Speaker C: But that was more the low, low flow, high FTP game. I feel like, less. That wasn't like, I feel like avalanche, Luna Solana were more, like, when they were having last market, like, those were, like, bigger, you know, like, a lot more float, a lot more money going into those. Whereas kind of, like, the tia stay sui. Like, you know, those sort of ones were more kind of the low flow game.
00:08:42.820 - 00:08:47.716, Speaker A: Yeah, that felt more like internal money moving around rather than a lot of new money coming into space and, like.
00:08:47.740 - 00:09:30.536, Speaker C: All the launches, like, yeah. So I just think it's kind of interesting that we, like, we kind of skipped a whole in this cycle where it's, like, from bitcoin straight into. Into dog money because that's what people remember doing the best last time. But I honestly think, like, a lot of this is, like, crypto native people like Jason Ceteris and, like, I don't know, ceteris message of the muse, but Jason, just, like, you know, having the muscle memory of last cycle, just, like, seeing bitcoin go up and, like, what is retail going to buy? And just, like, you know, buying, like, the Dogwood Pat, like, bonk Pepe doge Shib. Like, I don't think it's really retail money moving those yet. It's like a lot of. Just, like, internal crypto money moving.
00:09:30.640 - 00:09:59.474, Speaker B: Yeah. And this was kind of like, I had a tweet about this the other day that you were shitting on me. And this is kind of my point about how. How the cycle is looking different is you do have this new, this is really new money for a lot of these new, like, BTC buyers. And this, like, wealth effect goes directly to crypto natives. And to your point, it's like they're going right for the dog money and everything. And I think it's.
00:09:59.474 - 00:10:37.278, Speaker B: I think it's a bit different from, like, cycles in the past where even, like, the bitcoin and ETH rallies were done by. Sure, they're, like, institutions with big money, but these are, like, or native institutions. These aren't like, tradfi institutions. And so this is also how a lot of, like, normies now are getting access into the industry is from, like, the ETF's in their account and not necessarily downloading Coinbase, although Coinbase has been, like, skyrocketing up a lot over the last couple of weeks. Like, more so than I would have expected by now. Yeah, the dynamics are a bit different. Like, they're not the same as prior cycles.
00:10:37.326 - 00:11:04.356, Speaker A: I also think on the. On the Coinbase side, how much of that sino you mentioned, it's rocketing up, that's measuring downloads. And so I think it loses its. Or like that understates the involvement of retail because you have all the retail that already downloaded it from the last cycle just using it. Right. So that doesn't get reflected in the downloads. This is purely a reflection of new retail downloading.
00:11:04.356 - 00:11:22.512, Speaker A: So I think, you know, it we probably underestimated. Yeah, I doubt it. Like, and so it's just like, I think it probably understates the level of retail involvement because you have all the ones that already owned it before getting easily involved in that doesn't get reflected and it's skyrocketing up the rankings.
00:11:22.648 - 00:11:34.190, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I guess we'll see when like Robin Hood and Coinbase like publish the numbers. Like I think Robin Hood listing whiff was just like, oh God, like they're definitely seeing some appetite or else they wouldn't do that.
00:11:34.222 - 00:11:37.174, Speaker B: I mean that was, I mean it was Robin Hoodie. You just to be clear.
00:11:37.294 - 00:11:38.614, Speaker C: Oh, it wasn't us.
00:11:38.694 - 00:11:42.598, Speaker D: No, not even the big one yet. Just wait for that.
00:11:42.646 - 00:12:23.634, Speaker C: Licking his lips to these catalysts. Another thing I think is different is I think retail just has less money. Like COVID, it was like you're locked inside in a lot of parts of the world, you're getting a stimulus check. Like that was kind of the perfect storm for gambling on Internet coins. I don't know if retail has as much disposable income right now, even though we're seeing the stock market and stuff do really well and different assets do really well. I think that's more of a distribution to people who already have money. And one thing that we're talking a lot during the bear market is more macro bull cases.
00:12:23.634 - 00:12:59.906, Speaker C: And it's this idea of the US is like 30 trillion in outstanding debt and a 5% interest rate on that is 1.5 trillion a year. Thats being paid in interest to debt holders, which is 7% of GDP. Thats a massive stimulus. But all of that money is going to people who hold bonds, wealthier people. Whereas the stimulus before in 2021 was giving people $1,000, $2,000 versus like, you know, 1.5 trillion to like already wealthy people.
00:12:59.906 - 00:13:27.850, Speaker C: So that's why, you know, I think that there's a bid in these more scarce assets and also like BTC and less. So I think, I don't know if retail will be as, you know, important this cycle. And I really hope that all the. Okay, I don't hope, but it would be amusing if all of the people jumping right into the dog money coins are all crypto natives and then kind of look at each other in retail doesn't come. We're dumping on each other now, isn't it?
00:13:27.962 - 00:13:41.934, Speaker B: I mean, no, this cycle is way different because if the last one, everybody in the world, like, no matter what asset you were going into, you're kind of, everyone was like, the good times. We're rolling for everyone. And it's definitely not that exact same vibe right now.
00:13:43.994 - 00:14:13.912, Speaker C: Yeah. And you saw with, like, GME and these other meme coin stocks, like, if we were to start seeing that happen, you know, other pockets of, like, speculation, I think that would be a really good sign for, like, okay, retail still has money, but, you know, I think a lot of savings rates and, like, the amount of disposable income that retail has is, you know, not where. Where it was in 2021. That's a guess.
00:14:14.048 - 00:15:06.324, Speaker A: But I don't. I don't even think you necessarily need that much retail to come to, in for these memes to keep going, though, because it's basically, I mean, well, just think, like, you know, it's been a. Everyone's kind of taking a barbell approach to a lot of this, right? You're either, like, it's kind of been proven, you know, the best ETH beta has been ETH and NFTs, and that's the same for kind of BTC and probably the case for a lot of these. And then after that, you know, a lot of the stuff in the middle is tricky because it's infra that's built for stuff that's not really there yet. So how high of a ceiling can that have? It's apps that don't have an insane amount of users, but are building for the future. And so how fundamentally valuable can they be right now? And then you have these things that are incredibly simple. Everyone who participates.
00:15:06.324 - 00:15:28.608, Speaker A: It's very digestible, very palatable. No one thinks they have an edge. It's just a simple idea. And so a lot of money flocks towards that. There's no unlocks. It's. Yeah, I think you're just going to kind of have this, this barbell situation because the, the alternative is you're, you know, piling into stuff in the middle, which there's definitely interest.
00:15:28.608 - 00:15:33.616, Speaker A: There are definitely interesting investments in the middle, but there's a lot of kind of noise that's hard to get excited about.
00:15:33.720 - 00:15:38.200, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it's definitely an interesting scenario, and it's kind of a self fulfilling prophecy.
00:15:38.232 - 00:15:38.376, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:38.400 - 00:15:57.316, Speaker C: It's like, all the internal people think, like, this is what, like, ethan Sol beta is, because this is what it was last cycle. They bid it. And, you know, that creates kind of a reflexive dynamic as people buy more and it gets exchange listing. Like we saw with. With Wif and bonk. But I also think. I know.
00:15:57.316 - 00:16:27.064, Speaker C: And again, we were talking about this, like, the meme dilution. Like, you have doge, Shib, bonk with, and Pepe, I think, are all over a billion dollar market cap, whereas, like, in 2021, it was really doge and then. And then Shib. But now you have kind of five of them, so, yeah, I don't know how that plays out. I think unit bias. Like, definitely. Who's Shib? Like, the biggest unit bias? Or is Wif up there bonk or who.
00:16:28.044 - 00:16:32.564, Speaker D: I don't know which one has the most leading zeros. It's Shib or bonk.
00:16:32.604 - 00:16:46.772, Speaker C: But I did watch, like, a tick tock video the other day, and they're like, I am 5 million Shib. And I'm like, that's, like, $30. But it makes you feel good to own a.
00:16:46.868 - 00:16:56.948, Speaker A: To be honest, the idea is, like, Shib's gonna go. Everything is gonna go to a dollar, right? Like, you can just anchor this random coin going to a dollar, and you just have insane p and l expectations.
00:16:57.036 - 00:16:57.308, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:57.356 - 00:17:08.824, Speaker D: So I think. I don't know, Duncan. Like, everything you said makes a lot of sense to me. Like, I don't really have anything to, like, come back at the. Like, I do think retail is poorer than they were in 2020.
00:17:08.904 - 00:17:09.120, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:09.152 - 00:17:35.674, Speaker D: Like, I do think they have more things to spend their money on now than they did in 2020. Like, I think all of those things are true. And then, like, all of a sudden, right, like, this is a text message I got yesterday from a friend, a 30 year old friend who has never invested in anything. He doesn't own any stocks. He doesn't own anything. Out of the blue for meme coins like doge and Sheba, you supposed to hold those for a short or long amount of time.
00:17:36.054 - 00:17:41.334, Speaker C: And how much? All out of money. They don't have money. The guy who doesn't invest in anything ever has, like, $50.
00:17:41.414 - 00:17:43.190, Speaker A: That's exactly what I'm talking about.
00:17:43.302 - 00:17:46.774, Speaker D: But, like, he's got. He's got a couple thousand dollars that he's looking at.
00:17:46.854 - 00:17:47.478, Speaker A: Yeah, but I.
00:17:47.526 - 00:18:08.146, Speaker C: Like, when are these people gonna run out of money? Like, never. Never. That's the thing. It's like, they all got Max extracted from in 2021. And then, like, they're out of. I feel like a lot of their savings are down. And then all these people bidding up the low float, high fpv stuff are also going to get wrecked.
00:18:08.146 - 00:18:18.002, Speaker C: It's like at some point the, this market, I feel like, will extract all, all the money willing because there's so many predatory strategies.
00:18:18.018 - 00:18:28.556, Speaker A: Well, that's why the only thing that matters really is just as long as those ETF flows keep coming, that wealth effect will keep trickling down. And like, as long as that big number goes up, the others will too.
00:18:28.660 - 00:18:36.244, Speaker C: I know. I want to believe that. But also, like, also I'm fighting. I'm fighting the high FDG coins I've enjoyed.
00:18:36.284 - 00:18:41.024, Speaker D: Just look at regular ETF's, dude. Just go look at an, like, the qqq ETf.
00:18:41.644 - 00:18:43.396, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not saying embarrassed.
00:18:43.460 - 00:18:44.868, Speaker D: Why would it be any different though?
00:18:44.916 - 00:18:58.612, Speaker C: I'm just saying when. Yeah, we'll look at gold stocks versus, you know, the gold ETF. Like, gold stocks have since 2013 are down only, like, look at, like, are.
00:18:58.628 - 00:19:12.028, Speaker A: You saying these the low fdv stick? Because I agree the low fdv stuff will have a reckoning, but I think it'll just create a repricing among that segment. Not necessarily, you know, make the entire house come crashing down.
00:19:12.116 - 00:20:19.132, Speaker C: Yeah, no, for sure. It's just I'm kind of wondering when, like, the liquidity draw that these low float high FTV coins have. And then also the kind of meme coins, like, who continues to buy these things and who continues to support the valuations? Because like I've said before, with the low float high fdv, it's like, there's literally weekly wormhole just launched $20 billion at a thin air. It's like there's weekly new coins with a 10 billion plus fdv, right? And like, a company on the stock market that's worth $10 billion, like, you know, like, has thousands of employees, like hundreds of, or hundreds of millions in revenue, like, all this sort of stuff. So when you can continually, just like every week, obviously, wormhole has been around for a while. It's like, backed by some really smart engineers. But my point is, every week there is a new multibillion dollar launch, and now there's five meme coins opposed to, like one or two last cycle that also have multi billion dollar valuations.
00:20:19.132 - 00:20:39.500, Speaker C: The market is going to keep supplying more of this stuff and eventually, like, the edge goes away. Because if it's so profitable to get a meme coin to reach escape velocity in billions of dollars, the market will keep making more of them until more stick. Right. So.
00:20:39.612 - 00:20:46.932, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, a couple thoughts on that. So, on the meme coin side, I mean, the hit rate on those is very low.
00:20:46.988 - 00:20:50.260, Speaker C: I know, but it matters. Like, on Solana, cost nothing to launch a coin. I can.
00:20:50.292 - 00:20:57.876, Speaker A: I know, but, like, none of those are reaching any kind of real market size, right. It's. It's been kind of a handful of winners.
00:20:58.020 - 00:20:58.388, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:58.436 - 00:21:22.300, Speaker A: And then on the. On the. I feel like the, uh, spin up a protocol and launch a high f. High fdv, low market cap combination is being kind of oversimplified. You know, these are protocols I've been building for a while. So it's more so, like, things that I've been building that are deciding to launch a token, rather than somewhere saying a month ago, saying, hey, I can do this.
00:21:22.372 - 00:22:01.604, Speaker C: But even new stuff, like, when the reward is hundreds of millions, if not billions, of. Of paper wealth, it's like, people will keep on doing it. Even if it's. I'm not saying it's like, yeah, I could go and spin up a wormhole tomorrow and launch at a $10 billion fpv, but, like, when the payout is hundreds of millions to billions, it's like, that's probably the highest ev thing you could do in the world right now if you are, like, technically skilled and have, like, fundraising connections. Is launching one of these infra plays and is launching one of these infra plays and launching it at, you know, a multi billion dollar fpv and extracting the value like, these.
00:22:02.024 - 00:22:06.264, Speaker A: It's not as if these are just spinning up out of the blue every week. Right? I think.
00:22:06.384 - 00:22:09.576, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, I know that. Like, a lot of them that have. Lot of.
00:22:09.720 - 00:22:15.752, Speaker A: Well, just about all of them. Like, there haven't really been any that haven't been building. First some.
00:22:15.928 - 00:22:18.720, Speaker C: This has been going on since 2017 with EO.
00:22:18.872 - 00:22:26.564, Speaker B: Okay, so. But the problem is that projects don't release tokens in bear markets, and so now they're just all releasing their tokens at this.
00:22:26.604 - 00:22:31.116, Speaker C: Yeah, because why would you. Why would you. Because they're trying to extract value. No shit. They don't launch it in the bear market.
00:22:31.180 - 00:22:35.940, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's like, it's. But to yawn's point, it's not like they're just creating this.
00:22:36.092 - 00:22:36.676, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:22:36.700 - 00:22:39.332, Speaker B: It's just the timing makes sense for everyone to do it. So.
00:22:39.468 - 00:22:59.262, Speaker C: For sure. It's not like I'm saying, like, they're creating last week and launching a nail, but, like, this has been a profitable trade to do since eos first did it in 2017. Right. So we're now getting to, you know, seven years into this trade that, like, at a certain point, it's going to become oversaturated because you can't keep doing it.
00:22:59.318 - 00:23:05.486, Speaker A: Like you mentioned, though, it is paper, so it's TBD if it's actually realizably profitable. Right.
00:23:05.510 - 00:23:06.718, Speaker C: It's definitely.
00:23:06.806 - 00:23:13.634, Speaker A: Some people are doing, like, there's definitely OTC stuff happening in the background. Right. But not, not to an insane degree.
00:23:13.974 - 00:23:24.278, Speaker C: Yeah. And if they launch it, like, Starquare launched at like, $7. And I know the Star War guys have been building for, like, six years, but still, it's. It's actually insane.
00:23:24.446 - 00:23:30.994, Speaker A: And those guys aren't going to be farming. Right. It's just like, it doesn't make sense for them to try and farm this.
00:23:31.334 - 00:23:49.834, Speaker C: I'm not, like, I don't know, I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but it's definitely, I think the vesting schedules and, you know, the value extraction is continually becoming more predatory given, like, all these tokens coming to market. And there's probably only a certain, like, a finite amount of capital that's going to end up bidding these things.
00:23:51.334 - 00:24:04.142, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think there's definitely a reckoning for that sector, but. And that's the other reason why the barbell element makes it more sense. You don't have this future supply overhang.
00:24:04.238 - 00:24:15.356, Speaker C: Yeah, I know, but that's just a general draw of liquidity out of the market. Right. It's like, stablecoin market cap is 180 billion or something like that. If you add up ust, right, but.
00:24:15.380 - 00:24:25.420, Speaker A: Like, these market caps are priced on the margin, right? So, like, if there is no bid and this thing collapses, it can collapse 80% without actually sucking up that much liquidity if no one bids 100%.
00:24:25.532 - 00:24:44.326, Speaker C: But I don't think it's like, everything's priced on the margin. I think it's drawing out some liquidity. Like, look at all the people bidding tia literally all over my timeline. And it's been a profitable trade for a lot of people, but a lot of people are gonna get Iraq. Like, there's. There's VC funds that bought in at $0.01 that are holding billion dollar unrealized p and L.
00:24:44.326 - 00:25:36.796, Speaker C: Like, you don't that, like, just return their fund 510 15, 2030 times? Like, you don't think those people are selling? Like, I'm not. Like, I just think that this, there's eventually gonna be a reckoning with this stuff, and I hope it's a scenario where just garbage just goes down, BTC and ETH continue to go up. And then also, like, you know, projects that are actually building a lot and legitimate and don't have these predatory dynamics continue to go up. But I definitely think, you know, something's got to give at some point. Even arbitrage, which is like, done, is like, you know, probably the number one l two has really great tech, done so much for crypto. They have, you know, a two or two plus billion dollar unlock coming in two weeks. It's like, is there a bid for two and a half billion dollars worth of harbinger?
00:25:36.940 - 00:25:43.468, Speaker A: No, but, like, I think we're. Your tone sounds like we're disagreeing, but we're on the same page here. So.
00:25:43.636 - 00:25:48.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I just. I just get kind of frustrated when I think about this. Like, it's.
00:25:48.132 - 00:25:48.732, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean.
00:25:48.828 - 00:26:38.858, Speaker B: I mean, listen, there was, there was a good tweet thread the other day to kind of maybe change this topic, but stay on it a bit about, like, public, public versus private valuations and this, like, barbell approach of the most liquid good public assets. And then on the private side, I forget what the private target was, but basically talked about this whole dynamic, how the private market now has been being bit up like crazy with the public going kind of insane. And a lot of these, like, get your token out as quick as possible. Deals that are being repriced the most. And I actually think that, like, you know, people like to, like, personally, I think that the liquid legit stuff is, like, the best area of the market right now.
00:26:38.986 - 00:26:39.698, Speaker C: I agree.
00:26:39.826 - 00:26:59.930, Speaker B: And I think that a lot of people doing private deals now are not going to be happy in, like, you know, a couple years. And obviously, some of the liquid stuff that we talked about, the high ftvs, like, they don't go into that category of, like, legit stuff that's purely liquid, but there's, like, good assets that are pretty much fully unlocked now.
00:27:00.002 - 00:27:00.450, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:00.562 - 00:27:20.398, Speaker B: You know, and, like, this is the case for, like, stuff like BTC and ETH just. And you have the ETH, like, especially if ETH gets this ETF, which I thought was like a lock. The ETF guys are kind of saying it's not a lock now, which I found kind of interesting. I know there's a lot of ETH. Max, he's getting offended by them calling it sister Hazel.
00:27:20.526 - 00:27:23.134, Speaker C: I don't understand that reference, but neither do I.
00:27:23.174 - 00:27:45.388, Speaker B: But if. I mean, I think ETH has a lot of. It has, like, a lot of good narratives, too. Right. If it gets these ETF lows, it's obviously pretty massive there. And then it's like if you are big fund manager and you think that ETH can like two, three, x from here still, you know, how far down on the risk curve are you going? Like outside of that?
00:27:45.476 - 00:27:56.716, Speaker C: But it's like, who the hell. Okay, I need to stop talking about this because. Too annoyed. But like, who is bidding some of these like high, like low float, high fdv things? Like, I just think that, well, the.
00:27:56.740 - 00:28:27.812, Speaker A: Reason is because, like a lot of the unlock stuff, it just takes a lot more money to move it, right. So if you're talking about low flow, high fdv, but high fdv doesn't unlock for another seven, eight months, then you have a trade there that's not really exposed to it. Right. And so, like, you know, this thing that's massively unlocked just takes a lot more money to move it. So you'll have these, these low market cap, high FTV coins that got initially faded because of that dynamic, but actually don't take as much capital to move and so they end up ripping the hardest.
00:28:27.868 - 00:28:28.132, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:28.188 - 00:28:40.616, Speaker C: And obviously the incentives are there. If it doesn't take that much capital from the move for, you know, interested parties to bid it to insane valuations to give them more liquidity on their exit.
00:28:40.680 - 00:28:52.128, Speaker B: I mean, listen, man, let's just go back to like the sole FDX estate in September and dumped to like $17 because everyone was worried about this 5 billion, like, yeah, but that's so different. That's like 100 billion now.
00:28:52.296 - 00:28:56.944, Speaker C: And yeah, I think it's quite a bit different. Right.
00:28:57.104 - 00:29:38.538, Speaker A: Might be worth talking about. Yeah, sol and kind of because we were chatting, jumping like, were close to all time highs in terms of market cap with the kind of increase in supply. But now you have. Yeah, I'm bullish on it, but yeah, you have the unlocks coming from the estate every month now starting end of March and then just kind of normal issuance. I think it can get absorbed in the bull market for sure. And I don't think that many people who are buying the FTX estate, I mean, I'm sure some work, but it unlocks pretty quickly. So the need to hedge isn't really there yet.
00:29:38.538 - 00:29:57.534, Speaker A: I'm sure there will be more of it later on, but right now it seems like an easier just naked long. I think you more so have the element of people selling with longer time horizon, selling spot and reallocating into that and just getting basically kind of built in leverage that way.
00:29:58.134 - 00:30:08.790, Speaker C: Ceteris, question on the sole supply side, just. I don't fully understand it. And for everyone. So the inflation rates. 7% a year or what?
00:30:08.862 - 00:30:16.462, Speaker B: No, it's like five something now. I think it goes down 15% a year. I don't know what the exact number is right now.
00:30:16.558 - 00:30:24.558, Speaker C: Got it. And do you know how much is in, like, left to be sold from like unlocked? From like Solana foundation, galaxy, all this stuff? Like how much more?
00:30:24.646 - 00:30:36.118, Speaker B: Well, foundation has a bunch that they just like, delegate to, like, validators and they give out some grants, but a lot of that foundation money is never going to be realized because it's like. It's just so much.
00:30:36.206 - 00:30:36.622, Speaker A: Right?
00:30:36.718 - 00:30:39.874, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a paper. It's like a paper treasury.
00:30:40.214 - 00:30:43.902, Speaker C: Is that technically unlocked, like in the circulating cap or is that.
00:30:44.078 - 00:30:46.086, Speaker B: I don't think it's all unlocked, but.
00:30:46.110 - 00:30:48.954, Speaker C: It'S like staked state.
00:30:49.494 - 00:31:03.516, Speaker B: And then the estate. The estate stuff, there's like that big unlock in March of next year. But then other than that, it's like linear. It adds like one or 2% to inflation a year. It just has that one big unlock.
00:31:03.580 - 00:31:45.210, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think I generally agree with Jan, and not to sound like, overly bearish when I'm talking, it's like, I don't think these things matter too much. When bitcoins going up 5% a day because of the ETF blows, it's like, that's an overwhelming positive force, but it's like, it's really important to hold these things in the back of your head and not get too crazy because there's going to become a day of reckoning where there is so much paper gains that are going to be heading for the door. I think, you know, a lot of these, these coins are going to be down like 95 plus percent at some point over the next two years, but they still could, you know, double, triple from here. Who knows?
00:31:45.282 - 00:32:00.638, Speaker A: Well, and that's. That's the thing is like, you, you know, it's. It would almost be less painful if they unlock now, but, you know, everything is going to be higher or you don't know, but like, you know, assuming ETF flows continue, everything will probably be higher. So now the pain will be larger when you have.
00:32:00.766 - 00:32:01.238, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:01.326 - 00:32:02.874, Speaker A: That much more to sell.
00:32:04.174 - 00:32:20.500, Speaker C: Yeah, that is probably a good trade. It's like fine coins that literally all unlock at the bottom and people are just out. Yeah, I don't know if there's any like, kind of like infra plays like that that can capture a really big narrative and demand a really big, kind of like, imagination trade. But I guess actually it hasn't really.
00:32:20.532 - 00:32:34.556, Speaker A: Played out well, though, for those tokens. Right. Because you have so much more market cap to move that it was almost the low float, high ftvs moved higher because there was just less market caps to move around, for sure.
00:32:34.660 - 00:32:41.236, Speaker C: Yeah. But just like, eventually those are, like, inevitably going to underperform unless they somehow do something, you know, incredible.
00:32:41.340 - 00:32:53.226, Speaker A: So back to the ETF. If there is no if it gets rejected in May, does that start the entire clock completely all over again, or does anyone know?
00:32:53.370 - 00:32:55.010, Speaker D: What do you mean, the entire clock?
00:32:55.162 - 00:33:13.154, Speaker A: Because they basically delay until the final deadline and then they have to make a decision, and then after that, they have to refile, which allows the SEC to basically continue to delay until the final deadline, which is kind of what's been their mo for a lot of this stuff.
00:33:13.614 - 00:33:30.358, Speaker D: Gotcha. I think based on what I was reading last week, they don't have to refile. I think they can. I think they're just like, delay and then they could delay again until whenever, the final deadline. But I'm not positive I can double check with. In the group chats I was reading before. I just don't think it's going to be may.
00:33:30.358 - 00:33:34.638, Speaker D: I mean, like, end of the year, maybe first part of next year makes the most sense.
00:33:34.686 - 00:33:38.260, Speaker B: Oh, you don't think that there's going to be Mayfa interesting?
00:33:38.332 - 00:34:07.582, Speaker D: No, I just think it's like, it's like a political thing. Like, I think that, like, there's still, like, all of that going on. It's like an election year there. Like, I'm not ruling out any kind of, you know, like, for lack of a better word, fuckery in the ETF approval process this year. And maybe they're gonna make a big deal of, like, staking or saying it's, like, not the same as bitcoins ETF, because proof of work. Their arguments don't have to be rational, obviously.
00:34:07.638 - 00:34:07.854, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:07.894 - 00:34:13.794, Speaker D: Like, they can just make some shit up and then it's, like, on somebody to either sue them or appeal or whatever. So.
00:34:14.494 - 00:34:28.846, Speaker A: Barely made it. He barely made it. Right. It has. Like, it needed Gensler as the tie breaking vote, so it's just hard to believe he's going to change. Get behind this. Yeah, I think you probably need a Trump presidency.
00:34:28.846 - 00:34:38.854, Speaker A: Well, Gensler's probably out either way, but you probably need a Trump presidency where you get a bigger overhaul of some of the three letter agencies and, and that'll open the door, I think, for it.
00:34:39.274 - 00:34:50.082, Speaker D: Yeah, I. I mean, I'm like 70% not happening this year is like, my base case for thinking about it would.
00:34:50.098 - 00:34:53.490, Speaker A: Be the pretty ideal catalyst for selling May and go away.
00:34:53.682 - 00:34:57.410, Speaker C: ETF denied XRP isn't a security, but.
00:34:57.442 - 00:35:14.368, Speaker D: Generally I think denying it is probably, like, better for the longevity of the market. You have the consistent catalyst and hope that this is coming. If you want to last longer. Having it happen in January of next year is better than May of this year, for sure.
00:35:14.416 - 00:35:20.064, Speaker B: We just get a January ETF every year. 26.
00:35:20.224 - 00:35:24.328, Speaker C: What are the dog coin catalysts other than exchange listings? What do you mean?
00:35:24.416 - 00:35:29.786, Speaker A: Yeah, l one's going up, but it's just like the l one goes up wealth effect. It goes somewhere else.
00:35:29.960 - 00:35:34.334, Speaker C: I know. I'm just curious if there's, like, specific, because that's the other thing. That's like the meme coin. They're hard.
00:35:34.374 - 00:35:46.462, Speaker D: It's like there's no exactly why they're easy. It's like, for me, it's like they're the highest possible, like, leverage bet you can get on an ecosystem without actually having to take leverage.
00:35:46.558 - 00:35:50.286, Speaker C: I hope that and nfTs, it's the.
00:35:50.310 - 00:35:53.158, Speaker A: Most liquid leverage bet. I love the liquidity of them.
00:35:53.206 - 00:35:57.780, Speaker B: Yeah. I also think that that whole sector can blow up and it won't have any effect on anything else.
00:35:57.932 - 00:36:13.196, Speaker D: I also think other sectors can blow up and those will just kind of, you know, like, if it's in the middle of a bull market, like, I don't think the same cohort of people are massively bidding with and are the same people massively buying, like Tia for staking purpose. Like, I don't think it's the same.
00:36:13.260 - 00:36:14.980, Speaker C: I think they're the exact same people.
00:36:15.172 - 00:36:18.012, Speaker A: I think it's a lot of just crypto whales trading.
00:36:18.068 - 00:36:19.492, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's the same.
00:36:19.668 - 00:36:22.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's. It's not the staking part. Just punting perps.
00:36:23.644 - 00:36:32.108, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, maybe. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't know. I feel like it's not the same cohort of buyers for the most part, but maybe I'm wrong.
00:36:32.156 - 00:36:33.508, Speaker A: Say this is a buyer of both.
00:36:33.636 - 00:36:35.384, Speaker D: Oh, you're a buyer of everything.
00:36:39.244 - 00:36:40.132, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:36:40.228 - 00:36:43.468, Speaker C: I'm just. I'm just be careful. That's all I'm saying.
00:36:43.636 - 00:36:47.780, Speaker D: But do you guys think the ETF is coming this year? Are you more bullish?
00:36:47.852 - 00:37:00.346, Speaker B: Well, I was. I thought it was like a lockdown a week or two ago until I started hearing what these ETF guys are saying. Like, they obviously know more than me. I'm not going to put my own bias on that.
00:37:00.490 - 00:37:10.066, Speaker C: And, like, you know, I think Mister Fink can get it through. Yeah, like I'm not discounting that because.
00:37:10.090 - 00:37:19.552, Speaker B: That'S, everyone's quoting his record, but they can also just withdraw and then that doesn't hurt their record. So there could just be like a political thing where it's like, hey, just do this next year.
00:37:19.568 - 00:37:31.368, Speaker C: But it's like how big a deal the bitcoin ETF's have been. I don't think that they're probably going to want to push it through. Just elevating success of BBC ETF's.
00:37:31.536 - 00:38:00.592, Speaker A: And the counter to that is. Right, like what you're hearing is there isn't going to be as much institutional demand for an ETTF as there would be for a bitcoin one. And I can, I can definitely get around that point. I mean we've mentioned this before, but ETH market cap now is basically where BTC was pre ETF. So that point works against that argument. But at the same time, I think bitcoin is just a lot more straightforward of an investment and the thesis behind it.
00:38:00.688 - 00:38:14.856, Speaker C: But I also think that ETH is much more similar to stuff they're used to investing in. It's like bitcoin is. You have to convince them on the golden narrative, which is like a complex, like monetary history.
00:38:15.040 - 00:38:31.104, Speaker A: But if you do, if you, if you use the framework that they use for what they're investing in on ETH, it's massively overvalued. Right? Like if you try and do it on a funnel basis, it's valued on being money and which then starts to trend towards like why BTC is valuable.
00:38:31.184 - 00:38:36.080, Speaker C: But like, I think during the bull market, like the burn gets up to pretty wild numbers and like the staking.
00:38:36.152 - 00:38:38.844, Speaker A: Rate and like low single digits at best.
00:38:38.984 - 00:38:42.092, Speaker C: Like it's valuing on the burn.
00:38:42.228 - 00:38:43.196, Speaker A: Two, 3%.
00:38:43.300 - 00:38:51.268, Speaker C: Yeah, that's like a 50 or 30 times earnings, like, and then you forward earnings and then you add on the staking rate and like I think there's.
00:38:51.316 - 00:38:56.620, Speaker A: But like that, that's, that's not, that's extrapolating. Insane on chain activity.
00:38:56.772 - 00:39:06.204, Speaker C: Yeah, but they don't know. They have no idea. It feels like much more like, oh, this is like, I think that people.
00:39:06.944 - 00:39:29.640, Speaker B: I don't know though, man, because people don't really believe that anything useful happens on chain. And so at least for BTC, they get behind the gold. It's like relatively simple and it also is better than gold in a lot of ways. Whereas with ETH it's like, well, this is just like a casino so, yeah, it's making some money now, but it's just a casino that, like, goes away.
00:39:29.752 - 00:39:48.894, Speaker C: From treasuries on chain. They, you know, put some real world assets on chain. All of a sudden, it's the future of finance. Like, I think the narrative, like, follows the price. And I think that the ETH narrative is honestly better than the BTC one, even though, like, right now it's not.
00:39:49.194 - 00:40:03.424, Speaker A: I think with. With some solid regulatory clarity where people are comfortable building, and then, you know, the ideas and. And what this could be becomes a lot more tangible. I could see that for sure.
00:40:03.764 - 00:40:04.544, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:05.404 - 00:40:14.460, Speaker D: So, I mean, with ETF's in general, like, I mean, just, like, fast forward a couple years as we get, you know, ETH, ETF, Sol ETF.
00:40:14.532 - 00:40:14.764, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:14.804 - 00:40:27.726, Speaker D: The industry gets more and more integrated with tradfi. Think there's a meme ETF because there's, like, meme traditional stuff. No, like, listen, there's, like, actual ETF's that trade on the stock market that.
00:40:27.750 - 00:40:29.814, Speaker C: Are meme stock, man.
00:40:29.854 - 00:40:33.678, Speaker B: There's. There is a legitimate. I can't believe I'm saying this. I was thinking about this the other day.
00:40:33.766 - 00:40:34.326, Speaker C: Oh, no.
00:40:34.390 - 00:40:40.190, Speaker B: There is a legitimate chance that people will be storing a trillion dollars in, like, dog themed money.
00:40:40.262 - 00:40:41.222, Speaker C: No, they're long.
00:40:41.358 - 00:40:42.214, Speaker A: I think so.
00:40:42.334 - 00:40:42.886, Speaker B: Yeah, man.
00:40:42.950 - 00:40:44.838, Speaker A: You see at 200. Absolutely.
00:40:44.926 - 00:40:48.286, Speaker B: Like, I think it's gonna eventually hit a point where there's, like, a trillion dollars.
00:40:48.350 - 00:41:04.544, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. A trillion inflated dollars. I. I guess dog money is better than the US market cap, but it's like, let's. Okay, let's get. What's the ratio of, like, doge BTC? Let's do that.
00:41:04.544 - 00:41:06.976, Speaker C: Let's do a bet on that. I'll do a bet on that.
00:41:07.000 - 00:41:20.244, Speaker A: Well, this goes back to the idea of additional meme, diluting the upside of each of them, like, individually, and probably needs to do, like, an aggregate. A trillion meme to BTC, please.
00:41:21.144 - 00:41:22.728, Speaker B: I mean, what's total dog money now?
00:41:22.776 - 00:41:28.728, Speaker D: Like, 50 billion total dog. But, yeah, it's like 50 billion. No, no, no, it's like 100. It's almost at 100 now.
00:41:28.816 - 00:41:30.816, Speaker B: That's only ten x. Yeah.
00:41:30.880 - 00:41:31.712, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:41:31.808 - 00:41:32.724, Speaker A: Wait, it's already.
00:41:34.624 - 00:41:37.600, Speaker C: Closer to 100, but maybe 20 billion.
00:41:37.792 - 00:41:41.624, Speaker A: No, Doja is 20. It's got to be 50. Yeah, I think it's 50. It's probably under 50.
00:41:41.704 - 00:41:43.176, Speaker D: Okay, so only a 20 exits.
00:41:43.240 - 00:41:46.734, Speaker A: Well, no show, but Sheba and Doge together are 42.
00:41:46.864 - 00:41:47.178, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:47.226 - 00:41:49.226, Speaker D: Weapon bonk are another, like, four.
00:41:49.410 - 00:41:54.130, Speaker B: Okay, so it's, like, 510 years. And that's a possibility.
00:41:54.242 - 00:42:00.530, Speaker C: Like, yeah, okay. Adjusted. No, inflation adjusted dollars.
00:42:00.642 - 00:42:03.706, Speaker A: No, I mean, it's like two years. Inflation doesn't matter.
00:42:03.770 - 00:42:07.210, Speaker C: Like, it's in the next ten years, five years.
00:42:07.322 - 00:42:08.614, Speaker B: I'm just saying, at some.
00:42:11.034 - 00:42:23.896, Speaker C: Point matters. And. And COVID M two. Money supply expanded by like 25% in like three years. It's like 25% of the dollars ever in existence. Just popped out of nowhere in three years. That's why everything moved.
00:42:23.896 - 00:42:28.448, Speaker C: So it's like, yeah, if that continues to happen, then maybe freaking dog money.
00:42:28.576 - 00:42:34.144, Speaker A: You're not quoting anything on inflation adjusted. Like, I feel like we're bringing this up now for. I know.
00:42:34.184 - 00:42:43.606, Speaker C: Well, I'm hedging myself in case we go, like, Zimbabwe and. Yeah, then, like, sure, my nfts are going to be worth a trillion dollars.
00:42:43.790 - 00:42:46.158, Speaker A: I could see it happening end of this cycle.
00:42:46.286 - 00:42:53.510, Speaker C: Oh, my gosh. Which I would be such a top signal. I would be completely out of the market and coping extremely hard.
00:42:53.582 - 00:43:04.382, Speaker D: I mean, they're. Dude, there's just regular ETF's out in the traditional finance world that hold shit like Roku, Gamestock, GameStop, marathon, Coinbase riot. Dude, come on.
00:43:04.438 - 00:43:06.250, Speaker C: Our society is lapsed. Very good.
00:43:06.342 - 00:43:10.458, Speaker D: They're going to basket as soon as they have access to them.
00:43:10.546 - 00:43:12.922, Speaker C: That's actually sad.
00:43:13.058 - 00:43:15.274, Speaker D: They're going to basket these memes as soon as they have.
00:43:15.314 - 00:43:21.562, Speaker C: I honestly think this speculation stuff is a sign of just stuff going to shit. Depressing to think about.
00:43:21.658 - 00:43:27.426, Speaker D: The GCR thing, right? It's essentially the GCR gamble your way out of the Matrix.
00:43:27.570 - 00:43:30.906, Speaker B: I mean, we haven't even talked about the fact that boomers are all going to be dying soon and all that.
00:43:30.930 - 00:43:37.714, Speaker D: Money is getting passed down into dog money. Duncan infinite bid.
00:43:40.734 - 00:43:46.886, Speaker A: Yeah, it's such a slow transition, though. Like, we've been talking about boomers dying for ten years now, and we need.
00:43:46.910 - 00:43:47.910, Speaker B: To stop all medically.
00:43:47.982 - 00:43:51.514, Speaker A: He keeps posting for my bags.
00:43:51.854 - 00:43:53.806, Speaker D: Oh, God, that's brutal.
00:43:53.990 - 00:43:58.764, Speaker C: Jason, will you invite me on your dog money yard if I faded and. And end up broke?
00:43:58.894 - 00:44:04.600, Speaker D: I mean, seeing as. Seeing as how you pick your memes. Yeah, I'll invite you.
00:44:04.752 - 00:44:06.004, Speaker C: Oh, God.
00:44:06.544 - 00:44:08.920, Speaker D: You're always welcome on the dog money boat.
00:44:09.032 - 00:44:18.416, Speaker C: Yeah, well, this is. This is a good combo. I feel like. But kind of crazy, man. Makes you think about where we are. I mean.
00:44:18.560 - 00:44:46.398, Speaker B: I mean, think about our first few episodes of this podcast. We were talking about, like, LVR, you know, future of amms. We talk about intents and it's hard to. This just like, meme stuff is just everywhere right now. It's just kind of like taking over everything. It's kind of hard to, as someone who writes infra research, it's like, what is my value at this point?
00:44:46.566 - 00:44:47.670, Speaker C: Yeah, this is how it all.
00:44:47.702 - 00:44:49.534, Speaker A: We haven't even cut interest rates yet.
00:44:49.694 - 00:45:04.624, Speaker C: Yeah, they cut interest rates. One is interesting because, like, you know, it's this whole, like, this whole thing I was talking about, like, the interest payments on the debt. I just think I feel like interest rates going up hurts certain sectors and then helps others. Right.
00:45:04.964 - 00:45:10.904, Speaker A: Every 50 basis points of interest rate cuts are going to be 20% additions to funding rates.
00:45:12.044 - 00:45:14.900, Speaker D: You think things elevated now, Duncan, just wait.
00:45:15.012 - 00:45:35.238, Speaker C: Yeah, like, my head's going to explode. But at the same time, like, I have to stay rational and, like, this market is still really small. Like, Nvidia, which could be agi, is still, like, you know, most of this market, like, just their market cap, right. So at the same time, you have to balance that. It's like things.
00:45:35.286 - 00:45:49.382, Speaker A: Yeah, but I agree, but, like, you know, people comping that to, you know, bubbles in, like, in 2000, there was no revenue. Like, this thing is just an insane cash machine that keeps surprising.
00:45:49.438 - 00:46:15.314, Speaker C: Well, no, I'm not saying Nvidia is a bubble. Just saying, like, just as, in terms of relative scale of, like, how big crypto is, it's like, it's the same size as one stock. So it's like stuff could get way more crazy. Especially if crypto becomes, you know, more relevant and we actually find some use cases other than dog money, then it could definitely get really crazy. But it is kind of. Yeah, it's weird, for sure.
00:46:15.614 - 00:46:52.070, Speaker D: I mean, I can tell this is tough, right? Because, like, knowing you for the last couple of years that I've known you, you always look at things like GMX, right? Things that, like, generate economic value to an extent. And then, like, I don't know, like, I think it's like when the markets. When. When, yeah, essentially, like, when the markets are going up, like, they don't care about that stuff. And when markets are going down, unfortunately, that's all people care about. So it's just like, yeah, no, you just have to kind of rotate into what, what other people care about. Like that, that was, like, always the hardest part about, like, for me, learning markets.
00:46:52.070 - 00:47:33.492, Speaker D: Like, it's not what I care about, it's what everybody else cares about. And it's why I missed memes and, and nfts last cycle. Because, like, I was like, yo, these jpegs are stupid as hell. Like, why would anybody spend a million dollars on this shit? And then I realized I'm not actually indicative of the vast majority of buyers out there. Like, my preferences aren't so, like, market conditions dictate preferences, right. So like, that's generally like how I, like, try to allocate and try to keep, like anything, like other, like, and at the end of the day, it's just like flows that dictate what goes up in bull markets, right? Like, it's. Nothing is really based in fundamentals.
00:47:33.492 - 00:48:04.522, Speaker D: It's just like, as long as money's coming in, things are going up. And like, to your point with Nvidia, right, like, it trades like a shit coin. It trade like percent daily basis moves. It trades like a, like a stock that has 100 x less market cap. You know, like it's, I think looking at like market caps and being like, oh, things can't go up a lot is not really the proper. It just, yeah, just if somebody market buys, right, like that pushes stock up, that's, that's just simply it.
00:48:04.578 - 00:48:07.426, Speaker A: And like, your zero day expiry options.
00:48:07.570 - 00:48:16.442, Speaker C: And when they're inevitably going to be printing trillions of more dollars and like, yeah, all this stuff's going to go up. You just have to kind of be on the fastest horse to like, outpace that.
00:48:16.578 - 00:48:23.018, Speaker D: But I think your actual framework of like, thinking about like, the market is probably like the right way of like.
00:48:23.106 - 00:48:35.282, Speaker C: Oh, sir, once we go into a bitcoin standard and reset the currency system, wipe out all the debt, I'm gonna be, I mean, my framework's gonna, my framework's gonna pay off in about 20.
00:48:35.338 - 00:48:45.514, Speaker D: No, I think, I think the way you think about it is like, very. Right. It's just like, it doesn't matter. Like, that doesn't matter until it matters. And like, I, I don't know when that.
00:48:46.094 - 00:48:48.638, Speaker C: You have to play the game. Like, I still play the game when.
00:48:48.726 - 00:48:51.590, Speaker D: Oh, you're a very good shit coiner when happening.
00:48:51.622 - 00:49:08.926, Speaker C: It's just like, I also don't delude myself into thinking that this makes any sense in the long term, assuming, like, the currency wasn't just going to zero over time. That's the only reason this makes, like, you know, these trades are profitable. Anyways, I think this is a good spot to end it, probably. I think we lost ceteris.
00:49:08.990 - 00:49:11.206, Speaker D: Yeah, I see ceteris.
00:49:11.390 - 00:49:12.686, Speaker A: Yeah, he popped in and out.
00:49:12.750 - 00:49:14.566, Speaker B: I've been going in and out. So my connection.
00:49:14.630 - 00:49:16.718, Speaker C: Yeah, we should hear him if he's talking.
00:49:16.886 - 00:49:19.094, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks everyone for joining.
00:49:19.254 - 00:49:19.894, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
00:49:19.974 - 00:49:20.878, Speaker A: Fun episode.
00:49:21.006 - 00:49:21.862, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:49:21.918 - 00:49:22.494, Speaker C: That was fun.
00:49:22.574 - 00:49:22.894, Speaker A: See it.
