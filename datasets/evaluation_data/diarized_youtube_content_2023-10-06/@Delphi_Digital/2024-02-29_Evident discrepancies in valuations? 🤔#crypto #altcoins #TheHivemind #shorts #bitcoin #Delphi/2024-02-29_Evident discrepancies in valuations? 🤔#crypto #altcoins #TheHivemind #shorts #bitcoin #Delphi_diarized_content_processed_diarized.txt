00:00:01.080 - 00:00:36.610, Speaker A: The people have spoken and they demand alpha. Duncan, you dressed up for this one synapse sweater on and the mug and then also I'm wearing the sweatpants. But I'm not going to show you guys that wormhole is like on hyper, hyper liquid I think is trading pre market at like 5.7 billion, which is like insane. Synapse. In the past seven days, wormhole's done 71 million in volume and Snap's done 460 million in volume and yet Snap's trading like 130 million market. So it's like, you know, 35 x difference and it's, it's doing five times the amount of volume in the past seven days as a bridge.
00:00:36.610 - 00:00:50.674, Speaker A: And they also have the vision of like the sinter chain and like connecting these, these different roll ups and EVM stuff. The team at Synapse is obviously really smart, but it's just like, it goes to show kind of a product with like a lot of users and a lot of usage at like 130 mil.
