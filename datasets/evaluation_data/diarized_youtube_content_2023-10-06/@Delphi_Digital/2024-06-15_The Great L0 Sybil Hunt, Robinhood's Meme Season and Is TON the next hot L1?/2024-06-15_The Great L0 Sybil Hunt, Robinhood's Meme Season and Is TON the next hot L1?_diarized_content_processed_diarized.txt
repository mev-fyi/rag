00:00:11.320 - 00:00:45.718, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. If you're a careful listener, you'll have noticed that we haven't posted one for like, what, a month now. There was a bit of a screw up with our last one where we recorded it but didn't post it. So we're going to be posting that one today at some point, today being the 13 June, and this one will probably go out the next day, but that one was recorded on the 30 July. And we covered a lot of our reaction to the EPTF and stuff like that. And we had special guest Jason, our macro king, on today.
00:00:45.718 - 00:01:20.904, Speaker A: We're back to our regular schedule. So myself, Jan, Duncan, and Ceteris, there's been, it's been a slower two weeks, I'd say, compared to the last few. But I think we want to start by discussing the Zksync Airdrop, or the ZK Airdrop, which happened this week. As always, a lot of strong reactions to airdrops. Yeah, who wants to? And maybe we can discuss that also in the context of, like, the layer zero, which did a lot of anti civil measures, versus Zksync, which seemingly did pretty little. Yeah. What do you guys think of the.
00:01:20.904 - 00:01:22.084, Speaker A: The airdrop?
00:01:22.504 - 00:02:15.218, Speaker B: Um, so, yeah, first off, there it is. Interesting how, like, more and more people are doing this, dropping to NFT collection things. Like, I mean, like, I never use Zksync, but I have, you know, maladies and penguins. And so I actually got, like, a decent size airdrop. And then I've seen people that actually use Zksync a lot and got less and that, I don't know if that is, like, the best way to do these things. I don't really know why I, for doing absolutely nothing with Zksync, should get, like, more tokens than someone that used it. And then, yeah, comparing it to, like, layer zero, there's a lot of addresses on the Zksync airdrop that were flagged in the layer zero one that are, like, pure symbols and getting all the tokens.
00:02:15.218 - 00:02:49.784, Speaker B: So I don't know, you can kind of see why both would do it. You know, this, this layer zero witch hunt thing that they're going through, it will be beneficial in the sense that, yeah, you'll probably be giving less to just pure siblings, pure, like, sellers of the token, but it is taking, like, a ton of resources from the team. Right. Like, it's taking them a long time. And I know they're, they're there. They're, like, offering people to come in and do their own analysis and everything, but it's a pretty big time sink. And so, yeah, I don't know.
00:02:49.784 - 00:02:51.024, Speaker B: I don't know what you guys think.
00:02:51.064 - 00:03:54.066, Speaker C: Like I was gonna say, you know, on the time spent to actually, you know, value preserved in terms of, you know, wasting tokens on people that aren't really creating something productive. There's some merit in almost taking the approach of what you used to see with cars and that red bar in the steering wheel where it's not necessarily that it prevents you, but it just makes it annoying enough that you just choose to do it somewhere else. And I guess that can manifest itself in a couple of ways, but one of which is just being proactive about the fact that there will be these measures before you, the farming even takes place. So I think, you know, we will be diligent about it, and then you don't actually have to be. But I think just even signaling that you will be will kind of deter enough of the purely extractive behavior that people might go through knowing that there's a decent chance that, you know, it'll all be for nothing.
00:03:54.210 - 00:04:43.174, Speaker A: I mean, I think, I think the anti civil stuff makes a lot of sense to do that. I think Larry Zero is doing like God's work to some extent, tagging all these, all these addresses. And like, from, from their perspective, it's just reallocating resources from purely extractive sybils who are likely going to dump to real users, right. And for them, they had a bunch of clusters of people sending like no value nfts or like super low value transactions, which like, were very obvious sybils. I think there was the same thing on Zksync. Syspas had some funny tweets, just like how his account where he was buying tokens and actually aping stuff on Zksync got no airdrop. And then all his Sibyl accounts got fat airdrops, which is kind of like exactly what you don't want if you're distributing your tokens, your token to airdropping, your token to your users.
00:04:43.174 - 00:05:00.068, Speaker A: And it will be interesting to see whether the layer zero airdrop, like whether the reaction, the price action is different because they've done this work and presumably a larger percentage of the recipients are going to be real users. Yeah.
00:05:00.236 - 00:05:05.868, Speaker D: What's the idea with the NFT, like, airdropping to NFT communities? I never really fully got it.
00:05:05.956 - 00:05:13.744, Speaker B: It's, it's, it's they, there's this idea that they will hold the tokens more.
00:05:14.804 - 00:05:15.868, Speaker A: It's vibes, right.
00:05:15.916 - 00:05:22.240, Speaker B: And you know, it's like, you know, it's. For the most part, there's some sort of, like, all of our friends.
00:05:22.352 - 00:05:27.816, Speaker C: Then there's also the more nefarious idea that all of these guys just own these nfTs.
00:05:27.920 - 00:05:50.328, Speaker B: Sure. That's like, there's been a lot of things like that. I mean, the. There's been, you know, airdrops to, like, mad lads got a massive wormhole airdrop. Right. I don't know. I don't know if this is a good move because as I said, I've never used eksync and I got a bigger airdrop than people that actually have used it doesn't really feel right.
00:05:50.328 - 00:05:57.632, Speaker B: Like, I don't know why I've done nothing to, like, deserve those tokens. Um, if you do it, it should.
00:05:57.648 - 00:06:08.216, Speaker C: Just be to a much smaller degree because I get the whole vibes element. But when you have scenarios that you're describing, that. That. That just means they're, I think, over rewarding the community.
00:06:08.320 - 00:06:20.984, Speaker B: Yeah. Some of them are crazy. Some of them were crazy big. Like the mad lads. One for joining the wormhole discord. It was like 1520K or something, of wormhole. Like, that's way.
00:06:20.984 - 00:06:49.510, Speaker B: That's. That's so much like, that's so many tokens. It's insane. One thing in the layer zero Sybil hunting down, there's been some pretty wild analysis. Like, it hasn't just been linking addresses. People have been doing these time series timestamp analysis too, right? And like getting clusters of things that were done around, you know, like the same time. So there's a lot of work going into this.
00:06:49.510 - 00:07:35.104, Speaker B: There's also this whole kind of economy creeping up now of people that are just grinding identifying symbols, right? It's kind of been like this open sourced. It's this new business line, almost like it's this new thing you can become like a professional in. And I've seen people. Yeah, yeah. And I've seen people. There's been some of these DM's recently, I've seen where people will scan GitHub accounts, right? And then DM the person on Twitter, like, hey, do you know you have an airdrop for $5,000? Can I have a third of it? Because I let you know about it. And so there's this whole kind of like, yeah, other side to the whole airdrop thing.
00:07:35.104 - 00:07:41.244, Speaker B: It just seems when you. When you say it out loud, though, it all just seems like such a complete waste of, like, time.
00:07:42.264 - 00:08:17.596, Speaker D: I know. The only airdrop I ever felt like I kind of deserved was, like, the arbitrum one, because, like, I used arbitram a lot, and it's like, you know, interacted, like, early, defy there a lot. But that was, like, the only one I actually felt like, okay, maybe I had somewhat of, like, a positive impact on the chain. And then I also, like, wrote about on Twitter, but that doesn't get accounted for and. Yeah, but it's like, I think a lot of this stuff, like, just moving money through something and inflating their stats, like, literally gives zero value.
00:08:17.780 - 00:08:19.724, Speaker B: Yeah, there has.
00:08:19.764 - 00:08:29.734, Speaker D: I feel like there should be some sort of, like, risk measure, but I guess, like, you do take on some sort of contract risk or, like, protocol risk if you're transferring large sums.
00:08:30.314 - 00:08:43.994, Speaker B: I mean, so this is very little with the bridge. Very little. Well, for the bridges, the LP's. Right. So I've seen a lot of people, they keep harping on linear airdrops, which I agree are probably better for a lot of things, especially if it's just.
00:08:44.034 - 00:08:51.698, Speaker A: In your airdrops aware it's just proportional to the amount of value you either have locked in the system or the volume that you did through it. Right.
00:08:51.826 - 00:09:16.924, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that linear airdrops for TVL make sense. Like, LP's in Stargate bridge, because they're letting it sit there, and you're the one taking a lot of the risk. Like, if you're someone bridging through Stargate, you're not taking a ton of risk. So because, like, you get settled, you'd have. Something would have to happen in, like, the exact time that you're kind of, like, bridging through.
00:09:17.044 - 00:09:17.364, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:17.404 - 00:09:26.272, Speaker B: And all that. And so as an LP, though, you're taking a ton of risk because you're touching a bunch of different chains, a lot of different smart contracts, and you're.
00:09:26.288 - 00:09:31.192, Speaker C: Actually doing something valuable. Right. You're providing liquidity that people can use to use the service.
00:09:31.328 - 00:09:35.080, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, their service only works with those people. Right. They're the most important.
00:09:35.232 - 00:09:35.496, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:35.520 - 00:09:50.716, Speaker D: And I feel like that should be weighted to. Yeah, linearly in terms of how much capital you're providing, but then also a time weight. Like, the first LP's in to actually, like, fuck. Like, we're the first capital deployed. Like, those are the people who actually. I feel like you can make an argument for.
00:09:50.780 - 00:09:56.876, Speaker A: That's what happened with this uniswap airdrop. Right. Like, the early LP's really got, like, ridiculous, like, seven figure airdrops at the.
00:09:56.900 - 00:10:02.396, Speaker D: Time, curve to curve two, because those are the people taking the risk.
00:10:02.500 - 00:10:28.880, Speaker A: And with bridges, there's no, like, for instance with, with layer zero, obviously, like Stargate has its own token. There's not really an obvious way to do it linearly, right? Like, like the people actually transferring value through the bridge don't have money at risk for, for that long. And then also there's like a lot of transactions that go through bridges that like the financial value of the transaction itself might not be high, but it could be like a governance message or something for.
00:10:29.072 - 00:10:31.632, Speaker B: But I mean, should, so like the.
00:10:31.648 - 00:11:28.082, Speaker C: Idea that, you know, the guy, people transferring value through the bridge aren't really providing a lot of value. I think the way you can argue that they should get something is from the, or not argue, but the way that you can rationalize it is, you know, these tokens are valued by, on chain or by the amount of volume the bridge will do roughly. You know, it's not, these aren't super efficient markets, but, so if you assume that, then, you know, their activity will support a higher valuation for the token, which will allow them to incentivize more people to provide liquidity to the bridge for less, for the same amount of tokens, you can incentivize more liquidity onto the bridge. So it does provide like second order value because it gives value potentially inflated to the protocol, which then makes. Allows them to incentivize more liquidity and makes the product better. But yeah, it all boils down to just getting more LP's.
00:11:28.218 - 00:11:38.618, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you, if you give, yeah, like, I don't even know if, if people using the bridge to transfer tokens should even get an airdrop. They're get, like, they got the, I.
00:11:38.626 - 00:11:49.894, Speaker D: Think she gets things small, but like the real values in the LP's and the early LP's and then also people who just like talk about your protocol and like attract more users.
00:11:50.874 - 00:12:07.414, Speaker A: That's really difficult to, that's really difficult. The thing is, whenever you start trying to incentivize those people, you create massive incentives for sibils. Like we've seen literally hundreds of like bounty hunter or like quest campaigns, right? And those things are just so easy to game ever since 2017.
00:12:07.534 - 00:12:20.662, Speaker D: You know, those are much more difficult to reward correctly. But it's like, I don't know, like picking, you pick some like, community members at the end who you thought like, and then obviously you run into a bunch of issues.
00:12:20.718 - 00:12:29.588, Speaker C: But like, if you could do like top ten most engaged with posts on Twitter every month kind of thing.
00:12:29.756 - 00:12:31.508, Speaker D: Yeah, but then those get botted.
00:12:31.636 - 00:12:36.984, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, but it's still, like something tangible and it's not open ended. Right. Where.
00:12:38.724 - 00:12:43.700, Speaker D: You, you know, don't, like you were saying before, like, you don't announce that you're gonna do that and then go back.
00:12:43.772 - 00:12:48.188, Speaker C: You kind of want to announce for that one though, right? Because you do want people chatting about it.
00:12:48.316 - 00:12:48.668, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:48.716 - 00:12:49.732, Speaker D: Then they're good. Yeah.
00:12:49.788 - 00:13:26.594, Speaker A: Anyways, I mean, for everything with this stuff, like what you were saying before Jan, like with everything with this stuff, it's better if you don't announce, right? Like even the Sybil stuff, it's better if you don't announce and you have a bunch of Sybil activity going through it. Your stats look like, I mean, in this respect, intentionally or not, layer zero sort of played it perfectly. You know, you get all the, all the volume and then you can kind of correct later. Hopefully that becomes, if that become, if more people start doing that, then you'll just naturally get less symbols or more sophisticated ones. I think stopping it all together will be pretty much impossible.
00:13:26.754 - 00:13:28.634, Speaker C: Should we do next topic?
00:13:28.754 - 00:13:42.854, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Next topic. Do you want to do. There's a bunch of topics. Do you want to do the totally Justin Drake debate? I suspect Duncan and Jan won't want to and me and Ceteris will. Or we can do symbiotic.
00:13:44.224 - 00:13:51.724, Speaker D: Well, tell me the big takeaways from the, any big major takeaways from that debate. I saw like.
00:13:54.184 - 00:13:57.444, Speaker A: I don't know, I thought, what was your general, did you guys all listen to it?
00:13:59.384 - 00:14:15.184, Speaker B: I listened to it, but it's not like I came away with a different change of like, frame of mind or different understanding where each of them lie on. Like, I'm not sure I really learned anything.
00:14:15.764 - 00:15:28.584, Speaker A: No, I mean, I thought that basically Justin Drake was pretty academic and often spoke about things in abstract and like theoretical terms rather than practical ones, and that he was using a lot of future Ethereum roadmap items, including ones that are sort of like not even really spec, like pre conformations and dank sharding and shared sequencing and like this world of atomic composability between all the roll ups and comparing it to the current version of Solana, which wasn't really fair. And he kind of said, oh yeah, it'll be trivial to build all this stuff. But knowing the Ethereum development speed, when I entered crypto in 2017, the merge was going to happen that year. That was the big narrative when I entered to buy ETH and chart next year. So I don't know about it being trivial and then totally on the other side he's like, so in the weeds and like, engineers engineer that I find him pretty hard to follow sometimes. I don't think he's a great communicator to a non technical audience, honestly. There's a lot of, like, assumed computer science engineering background that I feel like you need to understand what he's saying.
00:15:28.584 - 00:15:59.044, Speaker A: Like, I actually found Justin Drakes. So what he's saying is like summaries that was like, really useful to actually figure out what is what Tolly's point was a lot of the time. It kind of like, it's kind of a really good, I think, sort of summary of the Ethan Solana camps. Right. ETH is like more academic research heavy, and Solana is just like engineers, builders, and you kind of see it in the culture and everything else too.
00:15:59.394 - 00:16:29.952, Speaker B: Um, yeah, I mean, I do, yeah. I agree with your point about. I think some claims are just seen does like something super simple to do. Like, yeah, we're just gonna have atomic based sequencing across 100 roll ups. That's something that's very difficult to achieve. And the path that, like, these pre comps are going down also is just starting to look more and more like salon, this continuous block production too. So I think the main takeaways, I mean, we said this a lot, and there's.
00:16:29.952 - 00:16:41.024, Speaker B: There's like a good topic from research day, Josh Bowen and Ashrae on this, about how we're all, like, building the same thing. And obviously it's not exactly the same thing, but what's a brief information?
00:16:41.184 - 00:16:43.208, Speaker D: Because I've heard that term a bunch.
00:16:43.376 - 00:17:07.458, Speaker B: It's like a sequencer validator, giving like a confirmation that your transaction will be included. And so it's like a fast. It's like a fast ux, right. And so it kind of looks like in Solana, you have continuous block production taking apart, like, judo's mempool because they've added discrete block production. But basically, when transactions come in, they just get added to the block. Right?
00:17:07.506 - 00:17:08.018, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:08.146 - 00:17:29.888, Speaker B: And that would kind of be like, if you play this pre comp thing out far enough, that's kind of what it would end up looking like too. So, yeah, it's very, like, it doesn't change. It's very engineering versus academic. There are things with Solana like, they still don't have formal verification of, like, their consensus or anything. Those are good critiques. Like, that's good.
00:17:29.936 - 00:17:30.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:30.248 - 00:17:35.684, Speaker B: Fud. I think, like, Solana is still too close source. I think that's good. Fud as well.
00:17:36.384 - 00:17:52.280, Speaker A: Why don't we do a quick a quick test, like for go around the horn, do you own more eth or Solana right now? And who do you think won the debate? So starting with you, ceteris, do you own more eth or Solana? And who do you think won't?
00:17:52.462 - 00:17:59.984, Speaker B: Um, I own more soul, but I mean, I do own both. Um, who do I think won?
00:18:00.284 - 00:18:03.668, Speaker A: If you had to gun to your head, say who won, honestly?
00:18:03.716 - 00:18:33.190, Speaker B: Maybe. Maybe Drake, like, which is just because I think he, he, even though I don't agree with everything he said and I think some of the claims are a bit too, like, confident, I think he did a good job of explaining everything. He definitely came prepared with a lot of knowledge. And Toli is just this kind of like, laid back surfer dude vibe where sometimes he laughs off when Justin makes a point.
00:18:33.342 - 00:18:34.518, Speaker A: She was laughing the whole time.
00:18:34.566 - 00:18:49.694, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of hard to, like, I don't know if always laughing is like a great response to critique. Right. It's, it's like I kind of want to know more. So.
00:18:50.914 - 00:18:54.694, Speaker A: Yeah. What about you guys? Duncan? Yan.
00:18:55.234 - 00:19:07.698, Speaker D: I didn't watch it, so I don't know. I have more exposure to eat, but, like, still have exposure to soul, but definitely, like, more weighted towards either soul.
00:19:07.746 - 00:19:10.214, Speaker A: You kept posting fucking soul charts and stuff in it.
00:19:10.274 - 00:19:17.270, Speaker D: No, like, I have, like, soul longs on, but it's just like all of, like a lot of, like, all projects I invest in or on eat.
00:19:17.302 - 00:19:22.794, Speaker A: So it's like, not if you're talking about. That doesn't count. I'm talking about, like, ethical.
00:19:23.174 - 00:19:29.994, Speaker D: Yeah, I have more exposure to soul going out then because I have a long on.
00:19:31.374 - 00:19:32.474, Speaker A: What about you, John?
00:19:34.054 - 00:19:38.098, Speaker C: Right now I have more eth, but.
00:19:38.146 - 00:19:40.746, Speaker B: Having more eth is probably the right move, to be honest.
00:19:40.930 - 00:19:43.794, Speaker C: Yeah, not by a massive margin, but the right move.
00:19:43.874 - 00:19:49.498, Speaker D: Why? What the fuck you say? Like the resident soul.
00:19:49.666 - 00:20:01.374, Speaker B: Well, it's like, I think, I think now, I think there's been a big repricing over the last year and I think, honestly, they're probably fairly valued against one another. So I don't really have a strong take.
00:20:01.674 - 00:20:05.724, Speaker C: Forest against them all. Telegram.
00:20:06.024 - 00:20:08.176, Speaker D: Wait, I'm looking this up top is.
00:20:08.200 - 00:20:09.384, Speaker C: The, is the best.
00:20:09.464 - 00:20:17.624, Speaker B: RR's like five or six x sol right now.
00:20:17.704 - 00:20:25.504, Speaker D: Okay. Soul market cap is 85 billion. FDV E is 420.
00:20:25.584 - 00:20:25.752, Speaker B: So.
00:20:25.768 - 00:20:27.568, Speaker D: Yeah, like five x. Yeah.
00:20:27.616 - 00:20:45.064, Speaker B: So I don't know that's fair. I don't, I mean, I, it's like, I don't think soul is flipping eth this cycle. So it was kind of like when ETH was at zero eight BTC. And you're looking at it and you're like, is eth going to flip bitcoin if you think. No, and that's pretty high.
00:20:45.104 - 00:20:47.312, Speaker D: Do you think five x is fair? Five xl?
00:20:47.408 - 00:21:02.034, Speaker B: I think it could. I think it could get. I think long term, it could get to, like, a third. Right? And so I still think there's upside in the pair, but we could get to it. But, like, medium term, bearish. But, like, I mean, things can always change. Like, things.
00:21:02.034 - 00:21:17.158, Speaker B: I. I mean, I'm not gonna do this industry change so fast. I'm not gonna make some prediction about, like, what I think five years will look like. I think, though, in the medium term, like, the ETTF should be. Unless, like, flows just completely.
00:21:17.206 - 00:21:18.394, Speaker C: It's all flows.
00:21:18.694 - 00:21:23.598, Speaker B: Like, it's gonna be hard to form all those flows coming in every day.
00:21:23.646 - 00:21:24.326, Speaker D: That's fair.
00:21:24.430 - 00:21:28.554, Speaker C: That's a fair. Yeah. What are the unlocks, like, for. For soul?
00:21:29.334 - 00:21:33.110, Speaker B: They're, like, month. The big one is, like, March 25.
00:21:33.222 - 00:21:37.190, Speaker D: Yeah, but what about fire dancer? You're a bull hosting fire dancer in the chat.
00:21:37.222 - 00:22:06.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, fire dancer is bullish. Like, I think. I think people you're talking about. I think Solana will continue to get most of, like, the new users. And I think that especially when fire dancer starts going live, even, like, franken dancer first and then, like, the full client, hopefully next year, I think it'll continue to get. I think Solana has a good chance of flipping ethereum on most metrics. Like, I think that is definitely an outcome that can happen.
00:22:06.014 - 00:22:12.734, Speaker B: But we're talking about kind of, like, two different things. Flows. Like, you've got an ETF. That's.
00:22:13.834 - 00:22:21.224, Speaker D: Yeah, okay, fair enough. So you're just more of a passive flows bowl rather than, like, actually shit happening.
00:22:21.394 - 00:22:23.788, Speaker B: Solana, I love flows.
00:22:23.956 - 00:22:37.484, Speaker D: Okay. Tan is a good one to talk about. I feel like it started to get a little bit of buzz on Twitter recently. Yeah. And I've been talking about it a bunch, but the. The high level bull case for them is. So I think they're like, I'm just gonna check.
00:22:37.484 - 00:22:42.344, Speaker D: 15 billion market cap. Like, 30 billion. Okay.
00:22:43.244 - 00:22:43.748, Speaker B: What?
00:22:43.836 - 00:23:05.154, Speaker D: Okay. 18 billion market cap. 40 billion FTB. Sorry. 38 billion FDB. So, you know, it's about a third the size of Solana on a market cap basis. But obviously, telegram has, like, 800 million monthly active users, and every single one of those people have gotten a crypto wallet if you don't have a us number.
00:23:05.154 - 00:23:32.640, Speaker D: So that's, like, some pretty wild distribution. Like, it's just like, right in the app. So, like, you know, this is as well distributed as like a Wechat or like, you know, imessenger Facebook messenger. Like, on that order of magnitude. I think there's something like 30 million active addresses or. And that's kind of like hockey sticking up recently with, with these new games. Two big ones are not coin, which is like a clicker game that's launched.
00:23:32.640 - 00:23:46.684, Speaker D: And then also hamster combat, which is like another clicker game. But it's kind of these mini games in the Telegram. Apparently there's like millions of minigames in these telegram apps. And people are starting to layer on, like, crypto tokens there for distribution.
00:23:47.464 - 00:23:49.032, Speaker B: Have you played any of them?
00:23:49.208 - 00:23:51.232, Speaker D: Yeah. I see hands.
00:23:51.368 - 00:23:52.364, Speaker B: Are they fun?
00:23:52.944 - 00:24:11.964, Speaker D: Well, no, they're getting more complicated, but it's actually like, okay, listen, I'm expecting to get like $5 air drop from this, but they incentivize me to follow their Twitter, subscribe to their YouTube. I log in every day to get my bonus. It works.
00:24:12.004 - 00:24:13.660, Speaker C: You can get blocked by the civil.
00:24:13.852 - 00:24:25.864, Speaker D: So it's like, this is, this is what it looks like. And you tap and then you can buy, you know, my legal team, I can upgrade my Kyc and get more coins.
00:24:27.244 - 00:24:29.144, Speaker B: They're paying you for KYC?
00:24:29.524 - 00:24:33.036, Speaker D: No, no, like they have, like, they pretend that you run an exchange.
00:24:33.140 - 00:24:33.812, Speaker B: Okay?
00:24:33.948 - 00:25:16.052, Speaker D: Upgrade your leverage trading, upgrade your pairs, upgrade your liquid. Would hire a PR person anyways, but then they incentivize, like, doing all these different things on, God, the glare is really bad. But basically they incentivize to, like, join the Telegram channel, follow the Twitter account, follow the YouTube account. Like, their telegram channel has 35 million people in it. This was like 28 million people last week. Even if like 10% of these are real people and the rest are bought, it's like kind of staggering numbers. So just as, like a distribution, and then they're going to launch their token on ton, but just as, like, a distribution mechanism to get to that many people.
00:25:16.052 - 00:25:28.836, Speaker D: Like Ethereum has like 4 million people on it. So you're talking about, like, multiple orders of magnitude more potential users that already have this, like in their, in their wallet?
00:25:28.940 - 00:25:30.052, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
00:25:30.068 - 00:26:19.914, Speaker C: Like, the big apps problem, right, is a user problem. Um, and so in crypto, and what apps have been trying to do is, is obfuscate the crypto element and make it as kind of web two as possible, but then layer in the incentives on top so you use them as a care rather than a barrier. Uh, and, and, you know, if you're thinking about what has the best opportunity to do that is, is telegram right now. Right. You have people there for an app that's not crypto related. So you have a really widespread demographic of users geographically and just the user themselves being varied. You have the ability to have them tap into, or the ability to tap into all these users where all these other platforms are starving for it.
00:26:19.914 - 00:26:35.722, Speaker C: It's one of the more unique setups for just throwing an app on a massive user base, having it take off like wildfire without really needing to go through the hoops of trying to onboard them in unique and simple ways.
00:26:35.898 - 00:27:24.474, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just like these mini apps are really cool. The defi ecosystem on Tawna is still like pretty early pretty. And like the user experience is like, you know, their wallets and like doing swaps. It works, it's fine. But it's definitely not at the level of like Ethereum or Solana in terms of just like smoothness and definitely less things you can do. But I feel like, you know, Ethereum, the kind of the argument for Ethereum is like it has all these like, apps, it has like all this value locked on it, but it doesn't have a ton of users. And maybe the users that Ethereum have are like much higher value probably than the users that like Tan has, but Tan has like literally like multiple orders of magnitude more potential users.
00:27:24.474 - 00:27:32.994, Speaker D: So it seems like it could be pretty interesting because that's the one thing that crypto has really lacked is this distribution angle.
00:27:33.894 - 00:27:56.986, Speaker A: I think the Barrick. Okay. And I hold ton as well, so. But I think the bear case is just the quality of the apps at least. And we've done a few checks from ventures, some quality teams, but definitely the quality of teams in general compared to ether salon is pretty low and like a lot of the stuff is pretty low effort. I would say it's like starting to change, maybe more recently.
00:27:57.090 - 00:27:59.014, Speaker C: That's a very solvable problem, though.
00:27:59.834 - 00:28:02.290, Speaker B: They arguably have the hardest thing to acquire.
00:28:02.362 - 00:28:03.650, Speaker C: Right, exactly.
00:28:03.802 - 00:28:23.654, Speaker B: And like, we have enough, we have enough block space now. Yeah, so, but I have, yeah, they have their own virtual machine. Right. I don't know much about it. We looked into it a little while ago and yeah, there wasn't anything there. But again, they have this massive distribution. So.
00:28:24.474 - 00:29:00.750, Speaker C: Yeah, well, the funny thing is, and thinking about like Tan, the token, I guess, relative, it's one of the few that you've seen have relative strength when everything else has been selling off a bit. And it is, I guess kind of you wonder how much repositioning there is from like do you think it's other l ones to ton or just broader sell off and stronger bid to ton? Yeah. Is it something that's like cannibalizing demand elsewhere? Probably not, but I mean, to some degree, I think it's definitely doing that because it is big enough now at like a quarter of sol market cap.
00:29:00.902 - 00:29:11.824, Speaker B: Well, there's also a lot of people use. A lot of people, which I find weird is a lot of people actually use telegram just as like a messenger that aren't crypto people.
00:29:12.844 - 00:29:13.452, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:13.548 - 00:29:16.116, Speaker B: Which I never really understood. Which I never understood.
00:29:16.300 - 00:29:21.424, Speaker C: At first I thought it was drugs because you'd always see like your friend joined Telegram and I'm like, oh, you're buying some drugs?
00:29:22.964 - 00:29:36.052, Speaker D: Yeah, probably like, it's like similar to signal. Like signal has done like a way better marketing and job at marketing. But I think in terms of like, security and stuff, encryption, it's probably at that level. And also like, cross platform telegram.
00:29:36.108 - 00:29:37.916, Speaker B: Telegram has terrible security. What are you talking about?
00:29:37.940 - 00:29:39.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it is.
00:29:39.252 - 00:29:40.242, Speaker D: Are you sure?
00:29:40.378 - 00:29:48.442, Speaker B: It's all unencrypted. Read all your messages. It's terrible that we as an industry use this. It's, yeah, awful. Like, it is actually terrible.
00:29:48.578 - 00:29:51.362, Speaker A: I listen to the duncan has a.
00:29:51.378 - 00:29:59.014, Speaker D: Bag now conversation and I thought it was pretty good. He made it sound like they had some good security.
00:30:00.434 - 00:30:02.854, Speaker B: That's your, that's your d. I don't know about.
00:30:05.644 - 00:30:11.980, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Bull market, sir. And nobody got time for DD.
00:30:12.172 - 00:30:18.304, Speaker D: Well, I would just kind of assume it's decent given it isn't like the whole story of.
00:30:18.964 - 00:30:20.064, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not.
00:30:22.044 - 00:30:25.636, Speaker D: Where your sources on that. I listen to the guy who made it.
00:30:25.700 - 00:30:29.804, Speaker B: It's the source is them. It's literally unencrypted. That's all you need to know.
00:30:29.964 - 00:30:31.018, Speaker D: What does that mean?
00:30:31.156 - 00:30:34.726, Speaker B: It means that employees at telegram can read all your messages.
00:30:34.910 - 00:30:35.518, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:35.646 - 00:30:37.526, Speaker B: Any government can read all your messages.
00:30:37.630 - 00:30:48.110, Speaker D: I don't think. Okay, so they were like saying that they were getting letters from governments and stuff to like ask for messages. But if they could just go in and do that, then why would they, why would they need to?
00:30:48.262 - 00:30:50.754, Speaker B: I think this is another discussion. You need to.
00:30:51.134 - 00:30:53.094, Speaker D: You could educate me on this stuff later.
00:30:53.174 - 00:30:53.870, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:54.062 - 00:30:58.288, Speaker D: Like the government's request for stuff. If they could just go in and read it, why would they request.
00:30:58.446 - 00:31:09.132, Speaker B: No, no, they can read it with the request. Like, the point is that it's there where something like signal. It's the signal can't get your messages. So even if they get requests, they can't.
00:31:09.308 - 00:31:11.116, Speaker D: I think signal can get your messages?
00:31:11.220 - 00:31:36.942, Speaker B: No, they can't. If you believe there's a backdoor, like, listen, this is the thing, sig. The flood against signal is pretty bad, and it's coming from, like, telegrams. So, I mean, I wish actually, it's not going to make any money. Um, but signals security is so good that people try to find, like, a little tiny flaw that could potentially be there. Like a. Potentially a backdoor.
00:31:36.942 - 00:31:41.702, Speaker B: Meanwhile, telegram is literally unencrypted. Like, it's just bad over.
00:31:41.758 - 00:31:45.394, Speaker D: How did they know that Tucker Carlson was playing an interview with Putin? That.
00:31:46.694 - 00:31:50.354, Speaker B: All right, we should. Let's change the back door, buddy.
00:31:51.694 - 00:31:56.464, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you want to go on to the symbiotic launch?
00:31:58.004 - 00:32:04.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's not much. I don't know if there's much to say. It's just like, there's their competitor backed by paradigm. Right.
00:32:04.732 - 00:32:06.740, Speaker A: Eigen layer competitor backed by paradigm.
00:32:06.772 - 00:32:15.092, Speaker B: And cyberpunk also saw Eigen bought, like, an LRT. Is that right? Or they merged with, like, an LRT.
00:32:15.148 - 00:32:18.464, Speaker A: Protocol or something does today. I haven't had a chance to look at that yet.
00:32:18.904 - 00:32:20.296, Speaker B: I think it was yesterday.
00:32:20.440 - 00:32:26.424, Speaker A: What do you guys think of the economic. The whole economic security debate that whether it matters or not, that was a big one in the Toli.
00:32:26.464 - 00:32:48.010, Speaker B: Yeah. I think basically the point of the Toli is trying to make is, like, you can just bribe validators or, like, employees. I like Coinbase and these exchanges to do stuff. And so the actual amount of stake they have doesn't really matter. I don't know.
00:32:48.162 - 00:32:58.826, Speaker A: You're saying there are cheaper ways to attack these things than to acquire 51%. Basically, therefore, economic security doesn't matter, but.
00:32:58.970 - 00:33:39.452, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think they're both right in a sense. I don't really think it's pretty hard to actually acquire 51% and attack something of any relatively decent size, because when most stuff is staked anyways, that's. You can't buy that liquid. So it's. Yeah, I think economic security is probably overrated. I don't think it's, like, purely a meme. But, I mean, if sold goes up, if Seoul gets to, like, a, like a third or a fourth of ethereum's market cap, it'll have technically more economic security, uh, because it's like a highway higher staking ratio.
00:33:39.452 - 00:33:53.740, Speaker B: Right. Um, but does that mean that I think soul is more secure than eth? No. Um, so let me. I guess it depends. Like, it. Yeah, it depends, like, secure in one way, right?
00:33:53.812 - 00:33:56.892, Speaker C: Yeah, it doesn't matter until it does. And people.
00:33:56.948 - 00:34:13.834, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But it does matter at some point. That's, that's the thing. I agree that it's like a meme right now, and you don't even have to look at l one s. You can just look at, like, chain link. Right. And all these things and all the multisig l two s and stuff like this to know that economic security doesn't actually matter.
00:34:13.834 - 00:34:34.434, Speaker A: But I think it definitely, like, if crypto matters, economic security will matter because, like, the whole value proposition of this stuff is to be unstoppable. And I think over a long enough timeframe, anything that can be attacked or exploited will be. And only really, the most robust systems survive. The only one that don't have economic security.
00:34:34.764 - 00:34:44.524, Speaker C: The only. But, like, at a lower scale. Right. It's not going to, like, the first incident isn't going to be to the strongest thing, but it's. It's obviously, but it's. It's going to. Or the most valuable.
00:34:44.524 - 00:34:54.836, Speaker C: It'll be something further down the line, but it'll start triggering the conversation and. And deeper thoughts into, like, what is the realistic attack approach?
00:34:54.900 - 00:35:08.080, Speaker A: I think Toby's example. Yeah. Because there he was saying, oh, Chihuahua chain. And if classic intestine haven't been attacked, it's like, well, there's not enough economic value at stake to make it worthwhile to attack. And they're definitely.
00:35:08.192 - 00:35:10.604, Speaker B: He loves that. He loves that dog chain.
00:35:11.744 - 00:35:25.536, Speaker D: I feel like bitcoin is the only one that actually, like, has problem because you could just freeze, like, if the us government wanted to come in, just, like, fucking freeze all the US, like, dollars in USDC or tether, and it's like, it's over.
00:35:25.680 - 00:35:30.242, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Bitcoin definitely fulfills that purpose of being censorship resistant.
00:35:30.298 - 00:36:03.474, Speaker D: Like, it's literally, if they do that, if they wanted to, like, obviously that would be, like, a massive decision for them to make. And, like, probably stupid, but, like, in theory, they could do that and then, you know, it's over. Like, bitcoin's the only one. It's like, feels like, you know, maybe not if, like, a big nation state tried to attack it, but, like, I feel like if it could get to the. It could get to the point where, like, nation states could try and, like, attack it somewhat and it could be okay. I don't really see eth or Solana or any of these other ones getting to that point.
00:36:03.774 - 00:36:04.406, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:36:04.470 - 00:37:01.704, Speaker C: Yeah, it's probably in the world where you have, um, you know, for. In the nation state, on the nation state. Topic, it's where, you know, they're running these not for profit, you know, in the world where the economic security and the fees never really end up offsetting the decline in issuance. And you have to run these, like, somewhat altruistically, but because, you know, the value of what you're actually securing is valuable enough that you can subsidize the security out of pocket. That's probably a world where you can have some kind of attack because then, you know, like, the current setup helps reduce the concentration because it's just economically rational actors, whereas in a world where it's a bit more subsidized by, like, a nation state, then there's an opportunity for them to control enough to actually do something.
00:37:02.724 - 00:37:20.392, Speaker D: Yeah. Just reminds me on Twitter yesterday, I was, like, listening to this clip. Do you know that Peter is Ian guy or Zean? I don't know how to say his last name. He's just saying, like, this is back when FTX. He's like, bitcoin's going fucking zero. It's literally going negative. Joe Rogan's there, like, oh, damn.
00:37:20.392 - 00:37:21.044, Speaker D: Really?
00:37:23.384 - 00:37:23.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:23.720 - 00:37:32.960, Speaker D: But, yeah, that reminds me of the nation state attack. He's, like, a pretty big proponent for the US. And, like, everything non us just sucks.
00:37:33.032 - 00:37:38.408, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of people read his. I don't know if he really been right about a lot of stuff recently.
00:37:38.576 - 00:37:40.392, Speaker D: But he says it was such confidence.
00:37:40.448 - 00:37:40.696, Speaker B: I know.
00:37:40.720 - 00:37:43.972, Speaker A: That's the thing. That's the thing that makes me so.
00:37:44.028 - 00:37:46.756, Speaker D: Convincing on every topic he talks about.
00:37:46.860 - 00:37:50.300, Speaker A: Yeah, just the beginning. It's.
00:37:50.492 - 00:37:54.020, Speaker D: It's. It has another $17,000 to fall.
00:37:54.212 - 00:38:00.252, Speaker B: You know, I saw that clip, too. It wasn't. It wasn't like he was dead serious that it was going to actual zero.
00:38:00.388 - 00:38:03.340, Speaker D: Yeah, he said it was going negative. I'm like, what?
00:38:03.532 - 00:38:54.116, Speaker A: Yeah, his view of the world is like that the US will retreat. He has this book, like, the end of the world is just beginning. And his view of the world is basically that the US is king has, like, the best location. Best, like, natural resources, like food independent, energy independent. And it's going to retreat into itself because it doesn't need China or any of the rest of the world anymore and just use Mexico as its low cost labor and then leave the rest of the world to their own devices. And basically the oceans will become, like, unsafe again because they won't have the US Navy securing it. And so, like, commodities and, like, supply chains are all going to get fucked because all the stuff that we rely on, like, the safe oceans and transport costs are, like, commodity prices are going to spike and the world's going to get, like, really insecure and all this stuff, which seems like it would lead you to bitcoin, but then he, like, really mid curves bitcoin.
00:38:54.116 - 00:39:05.864, Speaker A: I don't know the amount of certainty he speaks. And, like, his book just cites so much stuff, and there's, like, not a single source. You know, there's not a single thing you can look up to. See. He's like, the US Navy is literally.
00:39:06.564 - 00:39:07.156, Speaker C: What do you say?
00:39:07.180 - 00:39:16.976, Speaker A: He's like, it's. It's, like, ten times better than all the other navies combined. I'm like, that doesn't sound. That sounds like a lot better. You know, like.
00:39:17.120 - 00:39:19.000, Speaker C: Like all the other navies.
00:39:19.112 - 00:39:19.848, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:20.016 - 00:39:31.088, Speaker A: Like shit like this. So it's tough. And, like, when someone speaks with that much certainty, I feel like, about. About stuff that's in the future and very hard to figure out. That's like a big red flag, I.
00:39:31.096 - 00:39:34.524, Speaker C: Think, because it's all got to be, like, probabilistic. Right.
00:39:35.144 - 00:39:38.824, Speaker A: He's also. Biden's gonna win. He was 100% sure Biden was gonna win.
00:39:38.904 - 00:39:39.384, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:39.504 - 00:39:43.880, Speaker A: That was his. His big call for the election, he thought. Yeah, Biden was gonna win the election.
00:39:43.992 - 00:39:45.112, Speaker C: This coming one.
00:39:45.248 - 00:39:51.160, Speaker A: Yeah, he called it, like, a year and a half ago. Like, Biden's 100% gonna win the election. Like, everyone's stupid.
00:39:51.192 - 00:39:51.336, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:51.360 - 00:40:01.488, Speaker D: He says stuff with too much, like, throws you off. Like, when you first listen, you're like, fuck, this guy knows it's up. And then you, like, listen to him more. Like, okay. Like, you're being really certain about these. Like, very, like.
00:40:01.616 - 00:40:07.992, Speaker C: Well, yeah. The second he starts talking about a topic that you're decently well versed in, you kind of see through the bullshit.
00:40:08.048 - 00:40:11.728, Speaker A: Yeah. He is very convincing, though. Yeah, yeah.
00:40:11.896 - 00:40:15.072, Speaker B: We want to talk about Robin Hood. Is that, like.
00:40:15.128 - 00:40:17.136, Speaker A: Yes, I guess.
00:40:17.160 - 00:40:19.976, Speaker D: So. They acquired what's it, bit stamp.
00:40:20.120 - 00:40:21.164, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:22.344 - 00:40:28.468, Speaker D: So that's. That means they're doing a lot of crypto volume. You would have.
00:40:28.516 - 00:40:35.644, Speaker C: And they probably have some. Some insight, maybe into, like, the. The future regulatory climate.
00:40:35.804 - 00:40:36.116, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:36.140 - 00:40:50.916, Speaker D: Well, did you guys see that? Jeremy. Jeremy, the head of circle, Jeremy. Yeah. That guy yesterday was, like, tweeted out, crypto is in the best state it's ever been in in the US. And, like, those are the people where it's like, okay, like, him saying that, like.
00:40:51.060 - 00:40:54.548, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's part of this because there's very different to him.
00:40:54.596 - 00:40:55.984, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:40:56.844 - 00:40:57.628, Speaker B: This fit 20.
00:40:57.676 - 00:41:00.060, Speaker C: What's good for circle isn't necessarily good for crypto.
00:41:00.172 - 00:41:00.708, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:41:00.756 - 00:41:01.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:01.844 - 00:41:05.624, Speaker D: Wait, so explain that to me. I looked at that and, like, this is bullish.
00:41:06.204 - 00:41:09.148, Speaker B: Um, I don't. It would be good to get, like, Gabe.
00:41:09.196 - 00:41:10.916, Speaker A: Gabe had a good take on it. Yeah, there's.
00:41:11.020 - 00:41:32.042, Speaker B: There's been a lot of people talking, but basically it's very beneficial to entities like Coinbase and circle. Um, you know, it's basically regulate apps, not protocols. But then you need to get these licenses if you're, like, an app. So you can go to coinbase and, like, get your license to be in Coinbase's front end things, like. So.
00:41:32.218 - 00:41:35.034, Speaker A: And also the only legal stable coin would basically be circle.
00:41:35.074 - 00:41:35.826, Speaker B: Like that.
00:41:35.890 - 00:41:38.010, Speaker A: That. I think that that was the idea.
00:41:38.042 - 00:41:38.186, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:38.210 - 00:41:42.234, Speaker B: Like, I don't even know if decentralized. Like, if you could actually do CDP stables or anything.
00:41:42.394 - 00:41:43.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:45.154 - 00:41:46.002, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:41:46.098 - 00:41:50.134, Speaker B: Oh, I thought Jason posted, like, the volume for.
00:41:51.154 - 00:41:52.034, Speaker A: So it was four b.
00:41:52.074 - 00:41:52.514, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:52.634 - 00:41:53.558, Speaker A: 4 billion.
00:41:53.706 - 00:41:55.634, Speaker B: He said that was mean coin 40.
00:41:56.054 - 00:42:04.158, Speaker D: That was meant for on meme coins and then. But, yeah, 40 billion in Q one, which is pretty good. And I think that, like, if they're buying 40.
00:42:04.206 - 00:42:06.674, Speaker A: 40 billion in crypto volume. Yeah.
00:42:07.214 - 00:42:12.374, Speaker D: Like, winter mute was, like, 10% of that, which is probably, like, the on chain stuff.
00:42:12.414 - 00:42:19.282, Speaker B: Or, like, winter mute, I think, is one of their highest revenue sources now.
00:42:19.478 - 00:42:23.106, Speaker D: Yeah, it was like, 10% of their volume. I'm pretty sure, like, was sourced through wintermute.
00:42:23.130 - 00:42:24.974, Speaker A: So that's like a natural citadel.
00:42:25.954 - 00:42:46.990, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's ahead of jump now. Jump used to. Remember, jump used to always, like, I swear, once every other week, there'd be, like, some big movement of the jump wallet, and everyone have to be like, no, no, this is a custody wallet for Robinhood. Like. But they kind of backed away from a lot of that. Robin Hood still doesn't.
00:42:46.990 - 00:42:50.990, Speaker B: Hasn't relisted soul or anything, but maybe.
00:42:51.022 - 00:42:54.454, Speaker D: That'S what they're doing. Bit stamp, it's like, okay, now they can provide, like, a longer tail of.
00:42:54.494 - 00:43:03.234, Speaker B: Stuff, but bit stamp is a. That's a weird one. It's been around forever. Has never really raised. I don't really know who uses it.
00:43:03.774 - 00:43:06.638, Speaker D: I get some more. These have the infrastructure for, like.
00:43:06.686 - 00:43:08.518, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe some licenses, too.
00:43:08.686 - 00:43:17.214, Speaker D: Yeah, probably that because they're one of the people on the whatever, like, spot reference price thing for the CME futures.
00:43:17.874 - 00:43:21.614, Speaker B: Do you think more exchanges will launch l two s like Coinbase did.
00:43:23.434 - 00:43:29.682, Speaker D: But, like, maybe. Well, finances its own chain, so no BSc. What are the big ones?
00:43:29.778 - 00:43:48.762, Speaker B: OKX bracket has been talking about doing something. I can see Robin Hood, you know, what I could see Robin, like, Robin Hood. The, the, the perfect chain for Robin Hood. Seems like. Blast. Like that. Seems like nothing that Robin Hood would, would make.
00:43:48.762 - 00:44:02.294, Speaker B: So, yeah, so, yeah. Kraken and then I guess OKX has one and all that. I think. I think it's likely, though, that a lot of exchanges will try and build an l two. I don't think we need, like, we don't need them.
00:44:03.634 - 00:44:06.174, Speaker D: I didn't know. Okay. I said a chain.
00:44:06.744 - 00:44:52.636, Speaker B: Yeah. I think they just see it as a pretty easy way to grow their business. It kind of makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective. And developers like it, I guess, because their app is going to be supported from, you know, Coinbase is. They released their smart wallet. You can actually see both your on chain and Coinbase balances from your self custody wallet, which is kind of cool. But I think, yeah, maybe the bigger thing with Robin Hood, though, recently is kind of like this whole, you know, I think there is a risk that the meme stock thing maybe is like, dying and, and because crypto offers such a better way to trade, like, meme coins.
00:44:52.636 - 00:44:53.380, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:53.572 - 00:45:08.014, Speaker C: Yeah. And they can't issue more of them. Like the, the fact that GameStop, the company issued $75 million worth of. It was a. 75 million. No, 5 million shares. Yeah.
00:45:08.014 - 00:45:22.234, Speaker C: At highs is such a headwind for, for future meme stock speculation. Knowing that, capitalize on that in the most painful way for you as a, as a meme stock enjoyer.
00:45:22.854 - 00:45:26.642, Speaker D: How are the meme stuff going to go up if they just, they, you.
00:45:26.658 - 00:45:30.602, Speaker C: Just know it's going to happen right here.
00:45:30.738 - 00:45:30.986, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:31.010 - 00:45:42.754, Speaker C: The dilution here is more horizontal. Right. With just more names. But at least your names, you know, will issue more tokens. So I guess it's, it's very, it's dilution in two ways. Right. With.
00:45:42.754 - 00:45:56.324, Speaker C: You're not really going to have more meme stocks, but those meme stocks will issue more shares where here, you know, the attention and capital get divided across more memes. But your specific meme can't screw you.
00:45:59.584 - 00:46:11.120, Speaker D: Chinson meme stocks that people love. See, these meme coins are super volatile, but it's like, and there's options on them. Like the fact that, like, what are 500 million in options?
00:46:11.312 - 00:46:30.784, Speaker A: That stream was so bearish. That was really funny to watch. This is why the dev needs to sell early and just get out of the way. Speaking of meme coins, should we talk about the celeb coins? Feel like in this dearth of topics, we might as well touch on mother, mother and daddy.
00:46:32.484 - 00:46:52.632, Speaker B: Well, what I thought was the biggest fumble. The biggest fumbles. Hulk Hogan came, and he didn't even name his coin brother. I was like, that was the easiest. Like, dude, hire me and I'll give, like, that was the. He named it Hulk, and then it just dumped. But if he named it brother, you know, it goes well with.
00:46:52.632 - 00:46:56.672, Speaker B: It goes, yeah, you rugged. It goes well with mother. It's like the word he always says.
00:46:56.808 - 00:46:58.512, Speaker C: Brother would have been so good.
00:46:58.688 - 00:47:01.204, Speaker D: Is it just like, what the hell?
00:47:02.864 - 00:47:06.096, Speaker C: But I think he's pretty cash strapped.
00:47:06.280 - 00:47:12.516, Speaker A: He pulled the lP, right, and, and just drugged, I think. I didn't follow it closely.
00:47:12.620 - 00:47:13.544, Speaker D: How much?
00:47:15.004 - 00:47:34.144, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I don't think, for some reason, I think a lot of celebrities think there's, like, no risk in launching token. They just really don't because they don't know anything about finance a lot of times, too, right? It's like a whole nother world. They just think, oh, you just launch a token and you make a lot of money. That sounds like a fun thing to do.
00:47:34.644 - 00:47:53.000, Speaker C: I guess it's just short term memory, because, I mean, you know, I get it the first time around, but then you saw Floyd get in trouble. Like, Kim K got in trouble. They obviously went after the most high profile name. So maybe if you think you're kind of further down the. The pecking order, you get away with it. But, yeah, they didn't even launch coins, though.
00:47:53.032 - 00:48:09.924, Speaker A: They just. They just did undisclosed promotions. Right, these guys? Yeah, I mean, I think. I think celeb coins will, like, do well. One of them will end up doing well. The celeb does it right. Like, it makes as much sense as.
00:48:09.924 - 00:48:19.988, Speaker A: As meme coins, but at least there's something cultural people care about, like, behind it. Um, literally, I mean, you can.
00:48:20.036 - 00:48:33.400, Speaker B: You can, you can, like, it's. I don't know, you can, like, reward your fans easier and stuff. There's. There's better ways to do it than just, like, a token. Although it seems like. It seems like Iggy's actually doing something with that. She actually, I don't know, slept coin.
00:48:33.432 - 00:48:42.800, Speaker C: With utility access and some, like, unique engagement. Totally makes sense. But just a pure meme coin with your name on it is short term.
00:48:42.872 - 00:49:11.582, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's, like, the social token idea from, like, the past cycle, right? It's, like, would be cool. Some sled joined the court, like, launched a coin, and then, you know, they organize a dinner, and it's like a lottery of coin holders, and it's weighted by your holdings or, like, your lottery tickets waited by, like, I think there's a lot of design space for. Because, like, some celebs, I don't know about. About Iggy, but, like, some celebs, definitely people would pay like, six, seven figures to have. To have dinner with them, right? Some. Some people would.
00:49:11.582 - 00:49:18.154, Speaker A: And to play video games with them to, like, get some signed memorabilia, like rug.
00:49:18.654 - 00:49:21.954, Speaker D: Huh. This person for seven.
00:49:24.314 - 00:49:25.626, Speaker C: Nobody do seven figs.
00:49:25.650 - 00:49:26.058, Speaker B: It was.
00:49:26.146 - 00:49:37.454, Speaker C: There's that one Justin sun, Warren Buffett example. But then the meme is always. Because there's a question of, like, would you take 500 buffet lunch with Jay Z? And Jay Z was like, take the money.
00:49:38.954 - 00:49:49.434, Speaker D: Yeah, like, that's ridiculous. I mean, Warren Buffet, it's like, Warren Buffett is like. I mean, then Justin Sanders, like, giga rich. Like, get a much partnership.
00:49:50.494 - 00:49:52.674, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an example.
00:49:53.694 - 00:49:55.558, Speaker D: Yeah, example.
00:49:55.606 - 00:49:56.914, Speaker C: Like, that's edge case.
00:49:57.334 - 00:50:00.422, Speaker A: I think there's other edge cases where people would pay. Pay a lot of money.
00:50:00.518 - 00:50:00.894, Speaker B: Like.
00:50:00.974 - 00:50:03.062, Speaker C: Yeah, but that's not, like, broad adoption, right? That's.
00:50:03.158 - 00:50:07.046, Speaker D: I mean, how much it is.
00:50:07.070 - 00:50:15.036, Speaker A: Utility. And there's endless examples of this. I think some fighters as well, people would pay a lot of money to. Or like, athletes. I think people would pay a lot of money to hang out with.
00:50:15.070 - 00:50:33.604, Speaker C: But, yeah, you could also do it to varying degrees. Right. You can have one very exclusive, personal, intimate dinner with a handful of people, and then you can do broader stuff with, like, 100 people where it's still pretty intimate, but it's not prohibitive for the masses in terms of the cost.
00:50:34.384 - 00:50:45.334, Speaker D: Yeah. I think what's cool is this instruction of behavior. And I feel like the biggest example right now are, like, world coin with the eyeballs. And then also is like, telegram games, which are like.
00:50:45.634 - 00:50:56.314, Speaker A: Or like. But a celebrity could just choose to put all their value through a token. Right? Like, say you want me to appear on your advert? You need to buy, like, x amount of mother and burn and send it to the burn address.
00:50:56.474 - 00:51:05.330, Speaker D: Yeah, but how much is iggy? I don't know how to say. The last name is own of mother.
00:51:05.522 - 00:51:08.106, Speaker A: No idea. I don't think anyone knows this.
00:51:08.210 - 00:51:11.856, Speaker D: In order for sense, they would have to own, like, a lot.
00:51:11.960 - 00:51:16.840, Speaker C: There's probably also what she would say she has and then what she actually has through a bunch of other random.
00:51:16.872 - 00:51:21.360, Speaker D: Yeah, or there'd have to be, like, a bucket that then. And then, like, half.
00:51:21.512 - 00:51:23.200, Speaker A: I know. I think that would be the best.
00:51:23.232 - 00:51:27.400, Speaker D: Way to do it. And then the tax just, like, goes to the LP and goes to you.
00:51:27.552 - 00:51:29.244, Speaker C: Have you heard of Trump?
00:51:30.464 - 00:51:36.684, Speaker D: I'm saying as like, a celeb point, but that's not scalable beyond the exchanges.
00:51:39.614 - 00:51:47.030, Speaker C: Well, there's a tax on sending it as well, so sending it to the exchange, well, it's just an access token, I think is what you.
00:51:47.222 - 00:52:01.798, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that would be if it's someone like, super elite, I think you just want to make it, like, if I'm long this person, I want to have access to them, hang out with them. Like, get all the merch, get all the. I'm like a super fan. I want to own this, this thing.
00:52:01.846 - 00:52:20.198, Speaker C: And ideally, you can reward, you can airdrop based on, you know, length of fan. Fandom, which is hard to do, but, you know, they've been acting. It would be a pretty manual process. You'd have to, like, they talked about Twitter and stuff like that. But if there's a way to kind of historically reward your most dedicated fans in some way.
00:52:20.366 - 00:52:24.154, Speaker A: Yeah. It's just barriers that have never seen a good example of it done. And, like.
00:52:26.414 - 00:52:37.942, Speaker D: And these tell, I think, world coins, the best of what of you. Incentive for all these different things. It's gonna be different behavior to incentivize or incentivize behaviors.
00:52:37.958 - 00:52:39.998, Speaker A: Definitely works. I'm talking about, like, celeb coins.
00:52:40.166 - 00:53:19.168, Speaker C: Like, yeah, I guess the path to it is. I guess there's. There are multiple paths there, but one of them is this kind of iterative one where, you know, it starts with a meme and they're like, all right, we need to figure out how to do something with it. And you keep. Each one has some deeper level of involvement, and then from there, you know, it basically be like a celeb works with a crypto native team to actually try and build something like, take it a step further, a meaningful step further, rather than these kind of gradual improvements where it actually looks like something that we're describing, or it just gets dumber and dumber and more cash grabby mother holding.
00:53:19.216 - 00:53:22.914, Speaker D: Strong market cap this thing.
00:53:23.214 - 00:53:31.754, Speaker A: What about daddy? The Tate and some beef was funny and some kind of buried him. That was unexpected thing to wake up to.
00:53:32.214 - 00:53:34.150, Speaker D: Um, yeah.
00:53:34.182 - 00:53:35.594, Speaker C: Got aggressive quickly.
00:53:36.214 - 00:53:37.022, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:37.198 - 00:53:39.914, Speaker D: Honestly feel like this just like kind of engagement.
00:53:40.654 - 00:53:41.150, Speaker A: No way.
00:53:41.182 - 00:53:57.634, Speaker C: Then he got. Because he was saying I had tape, was like, I have no exposure. And then, you know, the Zach XBTs of the world were doing a bunch of kind of wallet analysis and suggested that he did, in fact, have a bunch of exposure to it, which is much more likely banana all time high.
00:53:57.714 - 00:53:59.494, Speaker A: I'm surprised you haven't mentioned it yet.
00:54:00.034 - 00:54:02.694, Speaker C: I don't think we've had a podcast without a mention of it.
00:54:03.874 - 00:54:05.650, Speaker B: Almost had it. Almost made it.
00:54:05.722 - 00:54:07.694, Speaker C: Almost made it. Fucked it.
00:54:10.274 - 00:54:20.932, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's it. Kind of light. Is there anything else people saw this week that was. Do we want to talk about. Oh, yeah. Macro stuff. Anyone have a hot macro steak before we wrap up?
00:54:21.068 - 00:54:35.060, Speaker C: Dollars pooping on all the fun right now? You had the, the soft inflation. You had Saylor coming out saying they're going to more to buy more BTC. And then dollar is just kind of ruining the fund right now, man.
00:54:35.092 - 00:54:38.784, Speaker D: The whole market. I just opened up training you. God.
00:54:39.804 - 00:54:40.188, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:40.236 - 00:54:45.098, Speaker A: I mean, it's kind of what we've been saying for a while, though, right? Like, the majors look good and everything else just looks kind of.
00:54:45.146 - 00:54:47.734, Speaker C: Well, I mean, majors don't necessarily look good right now.
00:54:49.954 - 00:54:56.774, Speaker A: Majors look better than. I mean, a lot of stuff's down, like, like 50%. A lot of these ultra down.
00:54:57.114 - 00:55:07.814, Speaker C: The setup into the end of years is very constructive and keeps getting better. But I think short term, you know, it still seems like there's a lot of people who still want to sell.
00:55:08.274 - 00:55:13.268, Speaker B: Yeah, this is where you get. This is the shakeout, right?
00:55:13.316 - 00:55:16.500, Speaker C: Yeah, this is, this is a accumulation, not distribution.
00:55:16.572 - 00:55:16.828, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:16.876 - 00:55:19.904, Speaker B: Yeah, this is, this is some bullish reaccumulation.
00:55:22.444 - 00:55:34.380, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the, um, it's interesting, the OTC markets, we've been speaking to some of, some of the people doing that. Some of the liquid stuff is not getting bids at like 80% below market price.
00:55:34.492 - 00:55:37.636, Speaker D: 80% name dropping stuff.
00:55:37.780 - 00:55:38.844, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, it's.
00:55:38.884 - 00:55:39.388, Speaker A: I'll tell you.
00:55:39.436 - 00:55:49.098, Speaker C: Yeah, we're not going to. We won't. Yeah. But it's also, it. I would take that with a grain of salt because you're also buying locked tokens. Right. So it's, it's a slightly different exposure, but still very.
00:55:49.098 - 00:55:51.882, Speaker C: I mean, it's, it's, it's still very telling.
00:55:52.018 - 00:55:53.374, Speaker D: God damn.
00:55:53.874 - 00:55:54.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:55.274 - 00:55:56.202, Speaker D: Right to zero.
00:55:56.298 - 00:55:58.854, Speaker B: That just shows how dumb.
00:55:59.474 - 00:56:05.662, Speaker D: At $20 had, like, unlocks coming up in October and the OTC might like on the way up.
00:56:05.778 - 00:56:14.822, Speaker C: Nah. So that's just technically, which one is that? Which one is the correct market, though, right? Like, one is much more liquid than the other. So do you know I assign more weight to the.
00:56:14.918 - 00:56:16.774, Speaker B: How dumb crypto market structure is?
00:56:16.814 - 00:56:22.366, Speaker C: Yeah, it also just shows the appetite for, uh, selling.
00:56:22.550 - 00:56:28.502, Speaker D: It's pretty forward looking stuff. Uh, secondaries is pretty forward looking on the local high fpv stuff.
00:56:28.638 - 00:56:29.794, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
00:56:30.654 - 00:56:32.126, Speaker D: Early on, more liquid.
00:56:32.150 - 00:56:42.190, Speaker C: Like Solana, he has got good secondary demand. I have an example, like. Yeah, I know. I was more so just, just qualifying.
00:56:42.382 - 00:57:02.504, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a name by name basis, honestly, because some of these things trade pretty significant secondary volume. So where you're. It's hard to even say what the cost basis is, but the unlocks are going to be, there's definitely going to be like way less sell pressure than some people think and others, there's literally no bid at 80% below market price. And those unlocks are going to be brutal.
00:57:03.004 - 00:57:03.316, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:03.340 - 00:57:06.332, Speaker A: OCC brokers have alpha for sure.
00:57:06.428 - 00:57:16.244, Speaker D: Don't. Here's a rule of thumb. Don't touch any low flow at a high secrecy unless you're very confident in what you're doing. That's just like a good rule of thumb.
00:57:16.284 - 00:57:19.868, Speaker A: Like if you're casual, unless it's square bracket my bags.
00:57:20.036 - 00:57:32.004, Speaker D: No, I don't invest in any of those things because those are all the VC, like, VC orchestrated list on sex and stuff. But yeah, just a real general rule of thumb, it's be very careful.
00:57:32.084 - 00:57:35.060, Speaker A: VC orchestrated. Who are these VC's orchestrating this stuff?
00:57:35.092 - 00:57:35.236, Speaker B: Did.
00:57:35.260 - 00:57:38.084, Speaker A: You're at a VC for many years.
00:57:38.124 - 00:57:47.276, Speaker D: You are a VC. VC team, market maker, orchestra. There's actually a good podcast with me and we're orchestrating.
00:57:47.380 - 00:57:50.292, Speaker A: Yon and I are orchestrating.
00:57:50.428 - 00:57:57.144, Speaker D: And. And Omar, second lane. There's a good podcast that talks about this stuff. Let me.
00:57:57.184 - 00:58:01.432, Speaker A: The one with the empire one. Yeah. Why is that a good podcast?
00:58:01.528 - 00:58:22.682, Speaker D: Just if you want to understand like how this stuff is like launched like this. Just if you don't know much about the secondaries market or just like how these tokens actually come to be a good one to listen to. If you're interested in learning more, it's by Empire. It's with the head of it. Winter mute in the head of second lane. You can go look for it. It's talking about, I think, something like the underbelly of crypto markets.
00:58:22.818 - 00:58:38.330, Speaker A: All right, let's wrap. Thanks. Thanks very much, guys. This was, this was good. And see you again in two weeks. Nothing said on the hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only.
