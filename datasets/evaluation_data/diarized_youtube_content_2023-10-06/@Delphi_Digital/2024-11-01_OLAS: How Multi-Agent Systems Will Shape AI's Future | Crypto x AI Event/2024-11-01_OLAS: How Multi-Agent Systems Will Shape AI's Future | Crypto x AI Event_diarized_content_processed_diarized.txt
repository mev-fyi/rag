00:00:00.400 - 00:00:35.877, Speaker A: Before we get started, we'd like to thank our sponsors for making this event possible. Special thanks to our platinum sponsor, olas. OLAS enables everyone to own a share of AI, specifically autonomous agent economies. We're also excited to highlight our silver sponsors NIA Empowering Decentralized Applications and Blockchain ecosystems. Venice AI, a private and uncensored alternative to popular AI apps. Mira Unified AI infrastructure secured by crypto and the first on chain multi agent system. To learn more about all of our sponsors, check the description below and dive in.
00:00:35.877 - 00:00:37.145, Speaker A: Enjoy the show.
00:00:48.965 - 00:01:11.425, Speaker B: Hey everyone. Welcome to the Delphi Podcast. We're continuing with our Crypto AI Month series and today I'm joined by a very special guest, David Menarsh, co founder of Valerie ag, the entity behind OLAS and one of the leading protocols powering networks of autonomous agents on chain. David, very excited to have you join the podcast. How are you?
00:01:12.205 - 00:01:15.645, Speaker A: I'm good. Thanks for having me. Yeah, yeah.
00:01:15.765 - 00:01:17.585, Speaker B: Is it your first time, I assume.
00:01:18.485 - 00:01:20.505, Speaker A: On the Delphi podcast? Yeah.
00:01:21.125 - 00:01:52.787, Speaker B: All right, awesome. First timer. So. So I'm going to dive right in and hit you with some hard questions out of the gate, but I think there's been a lot of talk about the shape of intelligence in terms of AI and so I was curious to pick your brain. Do you think we are heading for a world of 1 million models versus a handful of large hyperscale God models or a million fine tunes of those same five models? Those are kind of the three scenarios that I've seen know people advocating for. Curious to get your thoughts?
00:01:52.971 - 00:02:34.283, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I can see arguments for all of them. Right. But I'm tempted to say the first category. So a million models, I do think they'll have like a shared route to some degree, but I don't think it will be maybe as prevalent as it is right now. Reason being that I think right now these models aren't really active like learners. They snapshots of like certain points in time when the training data was assembled and these models were trained. I think we're moving to more like continuous learners and more agentic kind of setups.
00:02:34.283 - 00:02:45.695, Speaker A: And so I think that will cause them to diverge as well because ultimately they'll take on more of the local context and whatever they're deployed. And that would be in the first camp.
00:02:46.135 - 00:03:03.223, Speaker B: Got it. Well, I think us at Delphi are also betting on that vision quite heavily, so hope you are correct. So next, maybe we just touch on kind of, you know, your background a little bit and why you and your team are the right People to, you know, kind of attack the problem that you're going after at olas.
00:03:03.399 - 00:04:38.595, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I'll first start with the team and then sort of take it from there. So at Valery we have three co founders. There's my co founder, David, who has a CTO at Valery and he has a background in cryptography, published cryptographer and a lot of insights and privacy, tech, privacy preserving, machine learning, these kind of topics are also something he has some experience in. My other co founder, Oak, that's a pseudonym, he has a product, a strong product background initially in sort of web2, then came into the crypto space around 10 years ago and he's leading all our product efforts. And on my side, I originally did a PhD in economics, game theory and in particular then went more in sort of data science, AI in fintech, and then ultimately joined the sort of crypto AI intersection actually five years ago when most people didn't much think about it and have been building autonomous agents since. So this idea of like agents has been with me for quite some time and I think this kind of combination of talent, we're quite unique in that sense.
00:04:38.595 - 00:05:55.571, Speaker A: What does Valery do? We're ultimately a core contributor to olas. And with olas, what we ultimately aim to achieve is that we want to give people general purpose autonomous AI agents that do valuable things for them as they define. So the problem is today no one actually has such technology. Obviously everyone would like very general purpose autonomous AI agents. What we have today are like specialized autonomous AI agents that can do things in more narrow domains. And so a lot of our thinking goes into, okay, how can we get there? And then importantly, how can we do that in a way where users can own these systems outright, where they can have full transparency over those systems and can even potentially run them on their own devices, but certainly don't have to rent them from a centralized labs or closed AI labs and pay continuous tax to them. So long story short, we want to create these general purpose autonomous AI agents and with olas we have a sort of route where we bootstrap our way towards that goal.
00:05:55.723 - 00:06:26.971, Speaker B: Awesome. And then the next thing I want to dive into is just multi agent systems in general. And so maybe for our audience and for myself, kind of just give us the explain it like I'm five about this particular area of research and why we've seen recent advances that have enabled, you know, what you're building at olas. Just curious, kind of what that path has been like, because it does seem like, you know, I'M hearing more and more people talk about this specific domain, which you seem well equipped to address. Yeah.
00:06:27.043 - 00:07:17.855, Speaker A: So I think the first thing we should clarify is like agents versus models. So one way to kind of break that down on the explain it like in 5 model is like a model is like a talker and an agent as a doer. So in the sense that when we're faced with models, right, we can prompt them and then they'll respond. And then we can put those models into more complex architectures where we would then define the whole thing as an agent. Because now it starts having access to a set of tools to do things outside the context of the model itself. So for instance, it can query like the web or it can even write somewhere on the web, it can maybe use a blockchain by a wallet, these sort of things. So model is the talker, agent is the doer.
00:07:17.855 - 00:08:34.175, Speaker A: And then the second part is like, why would you have multiple agents? Right. So when we kind of look into the future, I think what we're seeing is that AI as a whole is becoming like everyone's focused on building more and more agentic applications. And that makes a lot of sense. Because if you think about what are the sort of valuable things you could be doing with AI? Well, having some sort of autonomous AI system that does useful things for you as its owner, well, that is probably one of the most valuable things because you remove yourself of the equation and you can have some sort of system do valuable things for you. Right. But the question then is, will these kind of systems, these autonomous agents, be sort of monolithic or will they take another shape? And I think there's quite a number of indications that they more likely to be multi agent systems, certainly in the short term and probably also in the long term. So in the short term it's very clear why, especially when you build open systems like this, why it makes sense to build them as multi agent systems rather than as like a monolithic system.
00:08:34.175 - 00:09:30.849, Speaker A: So an example is we have this meme coin which came to the forefront of everyone's attention with Goat and Truth Terminal. And basically there is a person somewhere running effectively one model and giving it access to a cloud API and then giving this combination of models and the infrastructure they've built around it also access to tools like being able to read and write from Twitter, owning a wallet and so on. Now that setup already is quite beefy. So if you think about it, that person has to post that local model. They're actually even fine tuning it, which is something quite advanced. I mean your end consumer wouldn't necessarily do that at all. And they don't have to host that model somewhere.
00:09:30.849 - 00:10:16.807, Speaker A: They then have to get these API keys from Claude, they get the APIs keys from Twitter, and then they have to kind of compose that all and update it and run it. That is not something like an end user will sort of use in that sense. Right. If you wanted to make that accessible to an end user, you have sort of roughly two paths. Like one is you create a web two style solution, like you create a SaaS platform, you give them a Gmail login, they sign up and then they somehow get access to a copy of the system. Right. And then we're sort of back in this world where yes, the user can have access to such an autonomous AI system, but maybe they have zero control over it and in fact don't even know whether the thing they're interacting with is actually the thing which is being advertised to them.
00:10:16.807 - 00:11:29.267, Speaker A: On the other end of the spectrum we can build this in a very decentralized way where the user has much more control over the system. So for instance, we could use a decentralized inference network or some other kind of verified inference technology like TES to basically outsource the running of the model and the accessing of the underlying API. We can maybe use crypto payments to access those models rather than having to provision an API key via some centralized platform. Similarly, we can do that with the Twitter API, which we can proxy in some form. And so what the end user can ultimately run is a much smaller agent that has access to other agents that collectively compose into this kind of truth terminal application in this case. So what we've done in the process is we've decentralized the system, we've made it more transparent, and we made it actually possible for the user to run the part they care about in it in a local way. And I think that's one example why multi agent systems is already relevant.
00:11:29.267 - 00:11:50.015, Speaker A: Like all the olaf's use cases when we go through them, have a similar nature. They have sort of two ways that push them towards that form of multi agent system. One is the end user requirement around having something they're actually willing to run by themselves. And the other, that sort of element of specialization which comes in at the agent level.
00:11:50.175 - 00:12:43.051, Speaker B: Got it. And do you think that the architecture of the web today kind of needs to shift in order to enable the fullest version of this? Yes, I guess. One, one example is that you mentioned in the white paper is around data silos and crypto you know, potentially being a tool to unlock data in a wide variety of places. But the one I'm thinking of is specifically the enterprise. But I've heard of solutions like data daos and web proofs kind of trying to attack this problem, but I haven't really seen that much traction to date. So do you think that, you know, with the arrival of multi agent systems, you know, there will just be more and more reason for some of these data pools to basically come out in the open or how should I think about, you know, the evolution of the web with the arrival of agents?
00:12:43.203 - 00:13:31.263, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a couple of topics here, right. Like generally around, like the web and then more specifically about data. I'll start to go through them in sequence. So I think one trend, I see three big trends with the team. We have written a blog about this as well on our site. One is on the web, we all on this podcast, I'm sure aware of it, which is read write on web 1, web 2, web 3. In a sense that three phases of the web, although there's now a kind of parallel fourth phase which is also that the web sort of is going in our way in a sense.
00:13:31.263 - 00:14:25.015, Speaker A: Like things are getting closed off again because of the arrival of AI and people caring about kind of ring fencing their data modes and so on. But that's important to see. We had initially in the web this opportunity. Everyone hosts a server, put up their site so people can read. Then this write element came with the social media applications and then ownership came with like web3 where you can like sort of own your assets, own your data and so on as, as, as a concept and a reality. Then if you, if you want to have free phases and AI, they're not exactly like aligned with those web phases, but there's also in a way free phase. You have like raw space time when basically people were building AI systems that were purely rules based and they could even create some sort of chatbots, although not obviously as powerful as today.
00:14:25.015 - 00:15:21.469, Speaker A: Then we had the arrival of learning based systems where effectively rather than writing the hard coded rules for the ultimate application, you write a set of rules to have a machine learning system learn the actual rules for the application, like large language model on example. And then now everyone's pushing towards the third phase which is agentic because that's clearly another leveling up. And so I think the third interesting trend there which goes alongside that is around ux. So if you think about UX viewing has this sort of phase when we have read, right. I View it, then the mobile and sort of read, sorry, right, Time came in the web where we have the mobile and social apps. That's a very interactive phase. And a lot of people today are still very conditioned that an application has to be an app, interactive application.
00:15:21.469 - 00:16:52.191, Speaker A: Like if you ask your median developer to say, okay, build an app, they'll start building something with a UI where you click around. But actually now with agents we come more in particular autonomous agent. We come into a third wave again where it's sort of fully autonomous experiences where the agent does something for long periods of time and then delivers you full outcomes. So an example is like a self driving car where I no longer interact with the steering wheel and with the gas pedal, I just get in and out, right? And then like similar autonomous AI agents that trade on my behalf or you know, the truth terminal that posts independently. So that's, I think one very interesting set of observation is that we have this sort of ownership enablement now with the Web3 we have these agenda capabilities coming and these kind of new products around outcomes. And so I think we do have this kind of shift in generally like the application space which people will build and care about now coming to the web structure itself. I think actually interestingly, if we do end up having more and more multi agent systems proliferate in an open way, then we start having again a kind of form of the web, like in the early days, right, There'll be many agents representing businesses and individuals and they can then sort of interface with each other.
00:16:52.191 - 00:18:09.855, Speaker A: And for that vision, Web3 is particularly important because it's very hard to imagine that if you have like every user on this planet have, let's say 10 to 100 agents, some in health, some involve, some in social, whatever, that they were all interfaced via the Stripe hub or the AWS hub. This doesn't seem to make much sense. So instead what I think would happen is that they'll interface via one of the 100 or so open blockchain ecosystems because they're a natural point of composition for these kind of interactions. So I think that is a real possibility. But we do have to be aware that there's this problem around data. So I want to come to this last point which you also raised, which is that it affects everyone. So if you think about how do you build better AI today, it's to a large degree compute and data and increasingly it's actually just compute because some of the data you can synthetically generate, but you still benefit from having sort of unique data because ultimately what these models learn is some sort of generalized distribution of world states.
00:18:09.855 - 00:19:19.299, Speaker A: Right. And so what the closed AI labs do very well is that they kind of have all the open publicly available data, plus on top of that they have a ton of sort of proprietary data which in some cases they purchased, in some cases maybe they didn't purchase interesting law suits there on the way. Right. And then finally also their synthetic data. And so the question, when we're thinking of building sort of these decentralized alternatives, be it like decentralized model training, be it like agent economies, like an olas, it's always like, how do we create a flywheel so that the valuable data we create in this ecosystem doesn't immediately end up also in the training set for OpenAI or some of the other labs. And I think that's one of the challenges and I think actually I agree with you implicitly that a lot of the, there's been a lot of talk around data in Web3 and sort of data dials and so on. Nothing has really taken off.
00:19:19.299 - 00:20:09.025, Speaker A: I think we're now in a maybe second wave of this technology where I see some interesting early experiments and what I hope is that we can find architectures where we are permissioning some of this data access, but at the level of daos, let's say, right. Where for instance, olas, DAO and a bunch of other daos who generate valuable data through their agents can feed that and let's say abstractly define some sort of data lake that is permissioned, which then can be passed to training runs of new model architectures which are open and which as a result have an edge because they have unique inputs. So that's a long answer to your question, but I think it covers some key parts of it.
00:20:09.885 - 00:20:38.685, Speaker B: No, that's a, that's a great answer. Very, very thoughtful. I hadn't considered several of those, those components especially around like the data generated in multi agent systems then being used to train novel intelligences. That's, that's super interesting. All right, shifting gears a little bit. I am curious to get your take in terms of what, you know, agent frameworks and an agentic economy might mean for underlying blockchains themselves and kind of a potential shift in market structure. Right.
00:20:38.685 - 00:20:59.865, Speaker B: And so I know you guys have your agents do a decent amount of activity and then ultimately settle to, you know, some of the leading layer ones. But do you think, you know, just thinking about the bag holders in the audience, like what does this mean for layer ones in general? Are they ultimately just going to be used for settlement, kind of. How do you see that playing out?
00:21:00.025 - 00:21:47.899, Speaker A: Yeah, great, great question. I think firstly, like, agents are great for chains. You know, there will be winners and losers, obviously, but generally speaking, like, I think, you know, we'll have a billion autonomous AI agents using chains before there will be a billion humans using chains. That, that's my assumption. And agents, I think, like we covered earlier, like what have been too big, like what have been unlocked for agents. I didn't fully answer that, so I'll quickly answer that and come back to the question at hand. Like one big unlock was actually, in my opinion, smart contract chain.
00:21:47.899 - 00:22:31.053, Speaker A: So when I was building five years ago at Fetch to begin with, we were like, that's that, that's enough. Then we started buying and realized we don't have enough intelligence. And large language models was the second unlock. So you kind of have this like intelligence unlock and the permissionless settlement and contracting unlock. I think it's not just like sending assets from A to B, like from one wallet to another and kind of settling that, but it's also about being able to express complex like contracts on chain the same VMs do. And they can be, you know, defi contracts, but they can also be other forms of coordination around, like committing ourselves to certain goals and all that stuff. We can dive into it.
00:22:31.053 - 00:23:49.965, Speaker A: So with that in mind, I think generally chains have a similar challenge with respect to agents as they have with humans. They have to find differentiators, which sort of makes it such that agents will operate on those chains. And today, for the foreseeable, even something like Truth Terminal is not fully autonomously choosing these things. There's some human somewhere, even if it's just enabling access to that chain or feeding some sort of preferences into some prompts or somewhere. So chains need to be mindful of speaking to teams and builders who are building these kind of use cases and understand what attracts them. Now, from our perspective with olas, we found that generally chains are very excited about us arriving because it brings traction. Like, our agents basically feed into some of their core KPIs, like transaction numbers, like gas consumption and so on.
00:23:49.965 - 00:24:42.119, Speaker A: And what we also find is that different chains obviously have different foci in terms of their user base. And often the autonomous agent products you bring, because they're still specialized, tend to be specialized for these audiences. So to give you some examples on gnosis, we have started with OLAS Predict. And there's like a clear relationship there to gnosis interest and prediction markets. And like being one of the first who did that on Optimism and super chain more generally. We currently working on like a defi use case which also just yesterday mode was added to that group of chains with Celo. It's also defi related but on a different set of protocols.
00:24:42.119 - 00:24:59.355, Speaker A: So I think from my vantage point, a lot of the chains are starting to understand the power of autonomous agents and what they can do for the users who own or control them ultimately or enable them through giving them funds.
00:24:59.815 - 00:25:09.055, Speaker B: All right, we're at the halfway point, so I'm going to hit you with a round of rapid fire. Overrated versus unra. Underrated. Are you, Are you game?
00:25:10.475 - 00:25:11.535, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:25:12.115 - 00:25:24.175, Speaker B: All right. Yeah. And if any of them you're uncomfortable, feel free to pass. We won't hold it against you. But first one, Google's current market cap $2 trillion. Overrated versus underrated.
00:25:26.155 - 00:25:27.295, Speaker A: Underrated.
00:25:27.995 - 00:25:35.015, Speaker B: Underrated. All right, well I currently have it in my PA, so I like that answer. All right, number two, Bittensor.
00:25:37.105 - 00:25:38.645, Speaker A: Also underrated.
00:25:39.385 - 00:25:49.685, Speaker B: Underrated. Okay, underrated. Number three, the scaling laws. Seems like OpenAI is going to drop a new model this December. What do you think about the scaling laws?
00:25:50.625 - 00:25:54.445, Speaker A: Somewhat overrated. Not wrong, but somewhat overrated.
00:25:55.105 - 00:26:01.605, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, so you're not completely scale pilled like Leopold Ashenbrenner and the San Francisco crew.
00:26:01.915 - 00:26:06.755, Speaker A: No, I think there's some limits there. Yeah, got it.
00:26:06.795 - 00:26:14.135, Speaker B: All right, number four, Automating AI researchers themselves. Thought you might have a interesting perspective here.
00:26:16.915 - 00:26:27.495, Speaker A: Well, underrated in the sense that it's not happening enough there. I think it's a real possibility and underexplored.
00:26:28.475 - 00:26:37.615, Speaker B: Got it. Underrated. Wow. Okay. And then lastly, my seven month old son, will he ever have a job in the traditional sense?
00:26:39.515 - 00:26:46.375, Speaker A: Yes. I think what a job is will shift as it always has, but I don't think it will go away.
00:26:48.075 - 00:26:56.595, Speaker B: What do you think will be the leading job candidates outside of like healthcare workers and nurses in 20 years time and social media influencers?
00:27:00.815 - 00:27:47.101, Speaker A: I think like anything with a human component where there's a demand side which wants that human element like premium services and restaurants and things like that, purely driven by efficiency and these kind of concerns. There's preferences people express around picking one thing over the other. And I think like, you know, it could be like you say like certain restaurant experience, but also like, I mean, a massage for instance. Like there's something hugely like human about having a human do that. I mean it would be not comparable to have like a machine do it. Right. Like they exist since decades and no one cares.
00:27:47.101 - 00:28:13.435, Speaker A: We use the massage chairs at an airport and so that's just a dumb example, but I think there's a lot of like, experiences which are uniquely human, which will find more attention. I mean what, what's key is that people have purchasing power. And if they have purchasing power, new kind of services will be created because people will have shifts in demand and then there's a market.
00:28:14.775 - 00:28:56.265, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I actually love the Tolstoy, the Tolstoy line of thought in what Is Art? Where he basically kind of makes the point that over the last 200 years we became experts at transferring human knowledge, but over the next 200 years we'll become experts at the transfer of human like unique human feelings and emotions. Which I thought was like kind of a beautiful way to articulate it, but that was good. Thanks for playing overrated versus underrated. We are, we're going to move on. So I do want to touch on OLAS versus the competition. It does seem like, you know, the agents and agent interoperability is super hot right now and there's a decent number of projects doing it.
00:28:56.265 - 00:29:05.945, Speaker B: So I do want to understand kind of some of the unique design choices that you guys have made and some of the differentiators of OLAs versus your competitors.
00:29:06.105 - 00:30:16.067, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I think one dimension is around like autonomous products versus user prompted products. So AI agents is a bit of a broad term and like sometimes it gets used for AI workflows where a human prompts something and a few seconds or milliseconds later you have like some sort of maybe like suggested transaction for your wallet or like some sort of refined prompt with online data or whatever. These are very useful kind of tools and they've like fundamentally different from like an autonomous AI agent where you sort of maybe fund the system and give it like a high level goal and then it goes away and executes this over long periods of time. So OLA sits in this sort of autonomous space and then also the other differentiating axis, which is very important, is sort of closed versus user owned. So I think what we're seeing even in crypto now is that there's a lot of interesting experiments which are actually extremely centralized. So there's a, a tradable token, but everything else is on a proprietary platform.
00:30:16.067 - 00:30:59.681, Speaker A: You can't download the model, you can't download the agent. You literally can just go to a website where you can see maybe some traces and then you can buy the token. And I think that's like, you know, fine. Like it's, it's, it's it's one approach to take, but it's fun like qualitatively very different to what we have at olas, where everything you can see on the OLAS site in terms of statistics, in terms of like the products, you can download this open source code, you can run it yourself, you can participate in these agent economies. So that's one way I think about it. The other that was sort of under experience and user experience level separation. The other way to think about it is at the tokenomics.
00:30:59.681 - 00:31:56.257, Speaker A: So like I've seen very few actually interesting like I think experiments around tokenomics with agents at all and there's maybe two or three and one of them is olas. I would say we have like a very unique staking mechanism which is called proof of active agent, which coordinates agent activity. The way to think about it is the staking mechanism sets KPIs which the agent then have to fulfill. And that sort of is like leveraging one of these key aspects of crypto platforms which are around coordination. Like smart contracts can coordinate these off chain entities, bit humans or software agents in magical ways in a sense. And we're kind of exploiting that there. More generally I think OLAS has really this long term vision to bring about better and better autonomous AI agent systems.
00:31:56.257 - 00:32:46.935, Speaker A: Whereas I would say some of the other products I'm seeing are maybe a bit more opportunistic. Not all of them, but certainly some of them are maybe looking around. What's hype now? Like okay, memes, okay, I'm going to build some sort of meme thing and then I don't know how long that will last. Now having said that, we're actually also having some community members launch these kind of applications on ola. So they're possible. But I do think it's important to encrypt and AI really have the sort of long term view because I think one thing which crypto and AI separates from crypto and that gets a lot of people coming from crypto into crypto and AI confused is that what tends to happen in crypto is you have these short cycles, you have like a well defined protocol, you deploy it. The tokenomics around it either work or they don't.
00:32:46.935 - 00:33:39.105, Speaker A: The primitives either like are spot on or they don't and then it's sort of about like capturing that market and placing it there. In crypto, AI by definition like your products, when you're launching it is already outdated, right? Like the AI space moves so fast that it's all about do you have a flywheel around, iteration from where you're now to the next step, to the next step, to the next step. And does that flywheel make sense? And I think OLAs are also very focused on that. So. Yeah, you asked me earlier, overrated, underrated. With respect to Bittensor, like, the reason why I said underrated is still because I think what they have achieved in terms of like, community engagement and growth around, like, with the idea is fantastic. You know, I'm not such a big fan of the tokenomics at all, but, like, I think they're doing very well on that tangent.
00:33:40.765 - 00:34:12.153, Speaker B: Got it. And I think that is a good segue to like, the flywheels that you guys are trying to build. Like, do you think this category is kind of a winner take most or a winner take all category? Just given the flywheel effect around onboarding developers, more code, potentially more services, and then hopefully more money pouring into the ecosystem, or do you think it ends up being more fragmented? And if so, how do you think about building those flywheels at Olaf?
00:34:12.309 - 00:35:02.581, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think agents is such a massive market that I would be very surprised if there's a winner takes all. And because the outcome, like, let's think about like, where ultimately agents should be seen. I mean, they should be a significant part of the service economy globally. Like autonomous AI. Like, there's a entire, like, segment of services which you can just outright replace with autonomous AI agents. There's new kinds of services they can offer. So if you're thinking about like global economy and like ultimately that being sort of one day at a time for this entire space across closed and open and decentralized and centralized deployment modes, then it's enormous.
00:35:02.581 - 00:35:38.555, Speaker A: And the question is, if, let's say we end up in a world where it's a winner takes all, we have an OpenAI agent, and everyone, literally every business, every human will have their 10 or 20 or 50 copies running on that sort of mega cluster. It sounds extremely unlikely that that will happen, right? There would be no relation to the kind of economy we have today. Everything would change. And so I think so.
00:35:38.595 - 00:35:58.739, Speaker B: Sorry, just. Just to. I guess I did want to make sure I got my question. So maybe I don't understand, like, agent interoperability that well, but there is. Is there a reason, like, one protocol would be used because of the compounding nature of like, individual bytes of code or, you know, does your same answer.
00:35:58.787 - 00:37:28.935, Speaker A: Still apply to that? But, like, if you think about like the intelligence part of the equation, right, and like, we subscribe to this idea that there will be this sort of best agent and then we sort of all rent that from somewhere. Similarly, I find that hard to believe even in an open source setting where it's very easy to make this analogy to something like Linux, that there will be this sort of Linux of whatever the kind of steady state autonomous AI agent architecture will be at some point. I find that hard to believe as well because autonomous agents are, as I say, when they're really good, they need to be acting in response to their local context, they need to be tuned to their local context, they need to be actively learning from it, which increase like immediately introduces divergence at the quote unquote weights level if you think about it in a sort of moral sense, but also in terms of their deployment and how they're interacting with businesses and users. So let's come back to the core of your question. I think we have this so fast expanding space. We have in AI space like maps of agent frameworks which are never ending. Like there's 10,000 agent frameworks or something and then probably like 20 of them are sort of something people would have heard of and lots of others which are sort of cool.
00:37:28.935 - 00:38:52.675, Speaker A: So I find it hard to believe that on the stack level they'll be that sort of winner again. Also coming back to the reasons of local context mattering, the second thing is at the coordination level. Well, I do think protocols like OLAS have way room to grow because you effectively coordinate different use cases which you could think of some sort of form of vertical integration and then by doing so, because they're multi agent system, you enable them to be composed with other use cases. But I think of it more like defi legos in the sense where some of these composition will be even maybe with competing agent protocols or with other sort of agent use cases where the value capture isn't entirely by any given agent protocol. So I struggle to see that in any sort of meaningful short term to medium term timeframe we'll have any form of consolidation around a single thing. But that doesn't mean that those protocols who do it well don't have massive room to grow. So that's my tech maybe somewhat unsatisfactory, but yeah, that's how I would put it.
00:38:53.015 - 00:39:25.911, Speaker B: No, that makes sense. So I appreciate you clarifying that for me. And then next I do want to make sure we touch on use cases that you guys are excited about. Both in the near term. Reading the white paper it seemed like targeting a decent number of Web3 related use cases, but also in the long term, obviously it Seems like there is potential just much more broadly. So just curious to get your takes around kind of the initial use case that you guys are targeting as well as, you know, medium to long term, you know where you'd be excited about seeing adoption.
00:39:26.063 - 00:39:51.953, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now as we discussed earlier, like there's the protocol, which is a permissionless protocol. Anyone can launch a use case on it and use the existing deployed agents and plug into them to leverage them in their multi agent systems. That's happening. There's all sorts of builders who are building there without Valerie's involvement. Like the example is Peak Network. They have an energy use case.
00:39:51.953 - 00:40:19.195, Speaker A: There's example of creator bids who are building on the stack. There's other examples like people hacking at various hackathons like eight baller and so on. People in the community will know. Then there's the ones where Valerie is very involved. Those tend to be these really large scale agent economies. So Predict is the largest by now. It was initially launched on Gnosis and it's expanding there.
00:40:19.195 - 00:41:30.517, Speaker A: It's consumed over 28% of all safe transactions ever on that chain, which is a kind of example and supports that argument I made earlier that agents are really useful users of protocols and chains and that's why we have now lots of chains coming to us and talking to us to work on use cases with them or enable them to build use cases. I mentioned the examples of the super chain earlier with Mort being one which was announced the other day. I mentioned Zillow. So these are all examples where VARI is a bit more involved hands on. And then we have recently this kind of craze around True Terminal. So now there's some people building sort of open versions of that on the OLA stack which I imagine will be live relatively soon when I look ahead. I think what we really ultimately want is these kind of general purpose agents that start becoming competitive with more like closed source or closed AI alternatives.
00:41:30.517 - 00:42:15.813, Speaker A: And they're, you know, I'm still somewhat on the fence as to whether these kind of use cases around like browser agents which we see in Web2 a lot, or the kind of tight integration with chat interfaces is something where all of us could like differentiate and I'm not. I'm also not so sure whether the kind of browser agents are really that big of a thing. So like an agent which for instance books your holiday. I've heard this at Fetch as well and it still doesn't really exist. No one uses it. I don't know. I think some of these more complex experiences which Humans want are quite hard to define.
00:42:15.813 - 00:43:01.333, Speaker A: And there's also this craze and web3around intents slowed down a bit now no one talks about it anymore. You couldn't go to anywhere, a party a couple of months ago without talking about intents. I think the problem with a lot of these things is that humans struggle to express themselves clearly about these things. And so the kind of applications I think that make a lot of sense are the ones we're currently focused on which are sort of scoped and like prediction markets. You as a human don't have to have any take on what your agent does in the prediction markets. You just fund it in terms of the defi agent Optimus, you as a human can express some high level goals. And that I think is an interesting sort of approach to opening up a new form of user groups.
00:43:01.333 - 00:44:02.745, Speaker A: Like if I go to my mom for instance, or my dad and say use defi. Well, there's so many like concepts even for them to struggle formulating what even their intent would be that it's like basically impossible for them to like, let's say use something like a user prompted crypto AI wallet, right? Where they get some prompt and then it says oh, now go in aave. They're like, well, what's aave? Right? Like why would I, why would I use like that's just not the mode they will, they will use. Whereas, like a mode where they can have like an autonomous software wallet on their device. Yeah, that's more likely like where they can say, okay, I'm happy under these risk parameters to get a yield within that and that range expected, that's something where I don't have to even care where it comes from. That's a bit more like my traditional bank offering. Right, Okay, I can imagine there's a user class for this and this is exactly what we're trying with Optimus.
00:44:02.745 - 00:44:50.057, Speaker A: So I haven't fully therefore answered your question. What exactly are those use cases that are next? But what I think is very important is again to think about the flywheel. As I said earlier, it's not good enough to just come up with a funny meme thing right now and then think, okay, now crypt AI has won. That's sort of interesting. And I'm happy it happened because it brings a lot of attention. But now it's like, so what? So how do we leverage that sort of product, that sort of attention into creating flywheels that actually let us build like user owned, like open, decentralized AI products that remain at the forefront Right. And aren't like effectively just a derivative of some closed AI.
00:44:50.057 - 00:44:52.885, Speaker A: And I think that's where everyone should focus on.
00:44:54.195 - 00:45:10.735, Speaker B: And what do you think are like the key gaps today of that becoming a reality? Are there any places in the stack that you think are particularly lacking that you recommend folks spend time or you'd be really quite keen to see solutions emerge.
00:45:11.475 - 00:46:13.083, Speaker A: So I think it starts with the demand side applications, like the kind of application we're building, Predict Optimus, the others, because they create that app Flywheel, which drives an underlying infra Flywheel, which sucks in the availability of the solutions ultimately. Right. Because people will have reason to deploy capital to bring them into place. Now what is missing in terms of the infrastructure side? I think there's a lot of focus on inference networks and stuff. What obviously not as well built out is the data and the training part. There are solutions for both and you had some on the podcast and we're talking to some which are really making good progress there. So for instance, we're currently part of this Training Run of Intellect 1, which prime intellect is doing, which is an example of sort of early days decentralized training still like centrally coordinated, but at least like the nodes run in different places.
00:46:13.083 - 00:47:01.985, Speaker A: The model will still be small, but these are the sort of right steps in the right direction, I think. But the other question is like with the data, Right. So what I would like to see is that like Asian use cases and OLAs create this sort of differentiated data as part of doing their job that can flow back into this sort of permission data lake which is owned by the Olas Da and other DAOs collectively. Ultimately that data flows back into training runs, those models flow back into the OLAS agents and other agents. If we can close that loop and make it spin as fast as possible. I think that's as an industry like something where because of all the coordination power Crypto has, I can actually see us like overtake closed AI labs. But yeah, that loop isn't spinning yet continuously.
00:47:03.125 - 00:47:26.651, Speaker B: Honestly, I think that is a great place to end. That was very well articulated. So, David, I just want to thank you for coming on the podcast. This has been pondering Durian and our DAI month with Delphi and then with our lead sponsor olas. So I think it's been a great conversation. David, do you have anything else to leave our audience with?
00:47:26.723 - 00:47:34.795, Speaker A: Give it a shot. Try out Olas. Go to olas.network/operate. You can run an agent and feedback to us your experience.
00:47:34.955 - 00:47:56.499, Speaker B: All right, awesome. You heard it here first. We will also be shooting out a Twitter thread if there's anything that you didn't catch. But yeah, would recommend folks trying it out. It does seem like, you know, this space is very likely to inflect quite soon. So, yeah, thanks for listening and we will be posting this shortly. All right, bye.
00:47:56.547 - 00:47:56.835, Speaker A: Love it.
