00:00:00.520 - 00:00:45.354, Speaker A: Nothing said on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. All right, hey, everyone. My name is Jose Macedou, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. The goal of the podcast is to provide a. An inside look into what we like to call the Delphi Hive mind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights, alpha and shitposts. Today with us, we have Ceteris Paribus, newly promoted to head of research.
00:00:45.354 - 00:01:08.482, Speaker A: Congrats, ceteris, on that. I think I'll have some words to say about it later. We have Jan Lieberman, managing partner at Delphi Ventures. And we have ventures associate Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, on Twitter. Prodigious shitcoin, scavenger, and investor. I lead Delphi Labs, our protocol R and D arm, focused on incubating and accelerating new web, three primitives. So it's been a hectic weekend in crypto.
00:01:08.482 - 00:01:16.074, Speaker A: I think we wanted to start by talking about the Jupiter launch, but maybe before that. Ceteris, you want to say some words? I know research is hiring.
00:01:16.234 - 00:01:49.114, Speaker B: Yeah. So research is hiring right now, looking for infra and defi analysts, at least. At least one of each. So. So I have a tweet on my profile pinned to my profile that you can find on Twitter. We have a job link in there, and really what I want is, if you are interested in one of these roles, just write something and, like, have an opinion about something. The one thing we really want when we're hiring is people who have opinions and can take a lot of information, distill it down, and kind of tell readers why it matters.
00:01:49.114 - 00:02:07.224, Speaker B: And so that's what I'm looking for. I don't care about, like, your background or anything. If you write something really good and you put it through and I read it and I like it, that puts you in a good spot. So that's all I'll say. Yeah, if you're interested, check it out. We have got a lot of applicants so far, so that's good.
00:02:07.304 - 00:02:21.664, Speaker A: Nice. Excited for your reign at the head of research. And if anyone wants to join the best research team in crypto, this is a good, good shot at doing it. So who wants to kick us off? You didn't mute for that, by the way.
00:02:26.324 - 00:02:27.244, Speaker B: Oh, good.
00:02:27.404 - 00:02:30.864, Speaker C: I turned off my. I can't hear you guys anymore.
00:02:32.244 - 00:02:40.740, Speaker A: I thought you purposely just, like, unmuted and sneezed and then muted again, just like starry guys, just let me just.
00:02:40.852 - 00:02:46.000, Speaker B: Yeah, what are we talking? We want to talk the outage first. Solenoids outage or Jupe or what?
00:02:46.152 - 00:02:53.944, Speaker A: I think, let's go chronologically so we could start with Jupe maybe. Who wants to start us off on your thoughts on the Jup lunch?
00:02:54.064 - 00:02:54.464, Speaker D: I mean.
00:02:54.504 - 00:03:07.616, Speaker B: Okay, I'll start. It was. I don't know, it's kind of weird. The launch pool, I guess they explained it a lot in the docs and everything. I think people maybe did not look hard enough.
00:03:07.680 - 00:03:15.520, Speaker D: I thought it was like a market making agreement when they had that. I thought that reserve for the LP meant like they were going to loan that out or something.
00:03:15.672 - 00:03:42.684, Speaker B: Yeah, well, they did do some. Let me explain is like they set up this pool that it was single side Jupe that sold it from forty cents to seventy cents. And then, you know, going back down once the pool got used to see it would like go the other way too. Right. But the pre market price we're talking about, it was trading like between 60 and $0.70 for a while. So this was already, this was already setting it pretty below that.
00:03:42.684 - 00:04:16.566, Speaker B: So this pool was getting bought up on chain in the forties and fifties and it was trading on centralized exchanges in the 60 cent range at the same time, which I just showed you is weird. But listen, it's an interesting launch. I'm not going to give any legal takes or anything. They managed to raise what, like 1200 mil at like a four to 7 billion fully diluted. Like you're not going to get that. You're not going to raise that money in the private markets from anyone where.
00:04:16.670 - 00:04:18.566, Speaker D: Like when are they going to pull the liquidity?
00:04:18.670 - 00:04:25.086, Speaker B: They did, they pulled, well, they pulled the Jup side and now they have the USDC side acting as like a bid for people to sell into.
00:04:25.270 - 00:04:26.654, Speaker D: But doesn't that get pulled soon?
00:04:26.734 - 00:04:31.014, Speaker B: It's, they're doing like ten mil a week or something, they said. I think that they keep changing it up.
00:04:31.054 - 00:04:33.548, Speaker A: Yeah, a few months.
00:04:33.596 - 00:04:34.020, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:34.132 - 00:04:36.268, Speaker A: They didn't really specify the time period either.
00:04:36.436 - 00:04:53.504, Speaker C: I think the issue is most of these, whenever you do these types of setups, right, in whatever flavor LBP, LBA, the end result is. Well, the source is usually from treasury and the end result is usually some form of kind of permanent liquidity.
00:04:54.604 - 00:04:56.944, Speaker D: Yeah, they just pulled it. They just gonna pull.
00:04:57.364 - 00:05:01.556, Speaker B: No, no, they moved it to a normal pool. I think they moved up on the.
00:05:01.580 - 00:05:09.660, Speaker C: Ladder is like less the less of the concern. I mean, I think it's just like the source of the funds that was really antagonistic.
00:05:09.812 - 00:05:38.128, Speaker D: Yeah, like, honestly, I feel like this is what the incentives were for the Jup team. And just to go over it one more time, if you like, it's like a uni v three range, basically, where they deployed Jup between like $40 to $0.70. So as people are buying into the pool, they're swapping USDC into the pool, they're getting jup out. But that USDC, like, stays in the pool at the price. They bought it, so they sold. I think at the peak it was like 200 million worth of Jupiter, but.
00:05:38.216 - 00:05:40.056, Speaker B: It also had a 10% fee.
00:05:40.200 - 00:06:12.266, Speaker D: Oh, okay. Well, there you go. But now they said that they're going to keep that USDC in the pool. So, like, people who want to like sell back into it can and they're going to like withdraw it slowly. Some of that, I guess, is going to the team or some of it is going to go into a new pool. But yeah, definitely from the Jupiter team standpoint, this is probably like maximizing like the amount of money raised by taking advantage of kind of like the public markets. So if they can do it, like, who knows what's going to happen, like on the legal side.
00:06:12.266 - 00:06:24.660, Speaker D: But from a strictly monetary standpoint, this seems like it was probably worth it. Like you're raising 200 million, selling the token at a four to 7 billion valuation, which is, you know, quite high.
00:06:24.842 - 00:06:44.016, Speaker B: It definitely sucked up though. We were talking before, like, where does the money come from? And if you look, everything, everything was down like ten to 30% down on the data line. Because even if you got the Jup airdrop you like, we're probably flat unless you got like a massive one.
00:06:44.120 - 00:07:02.966, Speaker C: It, like, on paper, Solana ran up heavily into it, right. So you. There's just going to be. This is a pretty natural profit taking event with it both running up into the event and this being like a pretty climactic new source of new draw of liquidity probably for a while, like.
00:07:02.990 - 00:07:35.114, Speaker D: 200 million USDC would have been like probably 10% at least. Last time I checked, of the stable coins on Solana ended up in this pool, which is like pretty significant because all these things are priced at the margin, especially the all coins. They can have like hundred million market cap, maybe multi hundred million or even billion fdv. But it's really kind of priced at the margin because they're relatively like low liquidity to, to their fdv. So like sucking out like the marginal 10% of stable coins, you know, that first day made a pretty big difference.
00:07:35.154 - 00:07:35.306, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:35.330 - 00:07:48.526, Speaker D: Like, everything was down. Seemed like 10% across the board. But you did get a nice Solana run. Like, it got down. Like, Solana got down to like $80 or 85 or something like that, and then ran up pretty nicely into the launch, which I think helped.
00:07:48.630 - 00:07:51.318, Speaker B: Ran up into the outage too often.
00:07:51.366 - 00:07:53.854, Speaker D: The impact and running past the outage, too.
00:07:53.894 - 00:08:14.922, Speaker A: So, like, before we. Before we get into the outage, it just. Does it not seem like a weird kind of launch type? Like, if you wanted to maximize money raised and, like, enable price discovery rather than picking a range, it seems like you would choose something like an auction, like a dutch auction or something like this. And then I don't even know if.
00:08:14.938 - 00:08:19.778, Speaker B: You need to do any of that. There were enough tokens that it could have just.
00:08:19.826 - 00:08:41.693, Speaker C: Naturally, I think money raised and price discovery are two different, or, like, two opposing wants here to some extent. Like, I think if you. I mean, we mentioned this earlier, even the pre launch pricing, even though that's, like, insignificant volume, it does create some anchoring and then them kind of forcing that price. I don't know what.
00:08:41.733 - 00:08:42.693, Speaker A: I don't know if a dutch auction.
00:08:42.733 - 00:08:57.653, Speaker C: Would have caused this to go higher than 7 billion FTV. So I do think, like, they. This is like, they put the ceiling at where it was and then created a pretty comfortable floor, almost. So I think this is probably, like, close to maximizing capital raise for them.
00:08:57.813 - 00:09:09.584, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. That's true. Like, if they knew it was going to trade, like 60 to 70, they don't totally care to all sell it at that point price, they know if they started it at like $0.40. Yeah, they would raise a bunch.
00:09:09.744 - 00:09:16.272, Speaker D: Didn't you say that it was trading at like $0.60 on the sixes and $0.40 on chain that for a while, like.
00:09:16.328 - 00:09:17.680, Speaker C: Or is that just like a blip?
00:09:17.792 - 00:09:28.424, Speaker B: No, it was like, I don't know how long it took the. I mean, if you look at the chart on chain, it's. It looks stupid. It's. It's like a step up for the first hour. Right. As people are just.
00:09:28.464 - 00:10:13.876, Speaker D: Yeah, because you're kind of creating that illusion of the arbitrage to raise the money, which they probably, like, launched it with these market makers. This is a complete speculation, but they launch it with the market makers on the centralized exchange, like at 50, $0.60 or whatever, then start their pool at. Then it's trading at that on the sex, and then people are just, like, arming it by buying it on Jupiter itself. So a lot of these things, it's, honestly, this market is so inefficient that I think a lot of these things are optics. Like, if you create the illusion of you're getting a good deal or a good arb, like, capital just kind of flies in without, like, really thinking about it or even, I guess, you know, understanding the docs like this. This was in the docs.
00:10:13.876 - 00:10:21.524, Speaker D: I just don't think people really understood fully what it meant until it launched, and then there's, like, a lot of outrage. So, yeah, yeah, this market, we're gonna.
00:10:21.564 - 00:10:33.134, Speaker B: They were, this was gonna be like 20% at the beginning of the supply, and then they ended up making it like two and a half percent. So I think once they realize what price they were going to launch at.
00:10:33.294 - 00:10:51.542, Speaker C: I feel like a lot of the stuff is 80, 80, 2090, ten. In terms of investing at these times, where you just look at one piece of information and that drives your whole valid. I think one thing people are anchoring to is just comparing the Uniswap volume to Jupiter volume and then just doing the FTV comp and saying, all right, this is reasonable.
00:10:51.718 - 00:10:54.716, Speaker D: Jupiter's an aggregator. It's not even the same thing.
00:10:54.870 - 00:10:58.000, Speaker B: No, no, no, but, but okay, I have, like, no opinion on it.
00:10:58.032 - 00:10:58.856, Speaker A: Uniswap is here.
00:10:58.880 - 00:11:23.500, Speaker B: It's pretty right, it's pretty rich. But you. That's not even the right frame to think about both these things. Both Uniswap and Jupiter are the front ends of their ecosystem. Like, that's all that matters at the end of the day. In the long run, that is probably where most, like, a lot of value will accrue to these front ends that get all the users. So you can't just, like, uniswap, Uniswap in, like, three years, will the AMM even be Uniswap's main product? Like, I'm not sure.
00:11:23.632 - 00:11:26.516, Speaker D: Yeah, stuff, which I think.
00:11:26.620 - 00:11:41.460, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's not even that. Like, they're going after full, full financial service stack. Like, they want every, every part of it and they have the brand and that's where they're going. And Jupiter is going to be the same thing. Like, it is. Jupiter really is the front end of Solana. I mean, it is.
00:11:41.460 - 00:11:55.880, Speaker B: And even you go to something like squads with the multisig wallet, they have the Jupiter swap right there. Lafinity, like, uses Jupiter as we've talked about, too, right? Everybody uses Jupiter for everything, like trend.
00:11:55.912 - 00:12:03.392, Speaker C: Wise and fee capture wise. More of that, like, liquidity the source of liquidity has the ability to capture more fees in the front end.
00:12:03.528 - 00:12:32.192, Speaker D: No, I don't know. I think the front end to that liquidity, I think people are going to compete on because you basically like Uniswap, right? Like they can put on their 30 bps fees and they didn't really lose much market share because they own the consumer. Like you're kind of owning the front and owning the consumer. I think that's where you can play with the fees. Whereas like the consumers are less price sensitive versus the business kind of switching providers are more cutthroat.
00:12:32.288 - 00:12:33.288, Speaker A: Well it's also because they had a.
00:12:33.296 - 00:12:34.520, Speaker C: Majority of the liquidity.
00:12:34.672 - 00:12:37.296, Speaker D: Yeah, but I think you swap before.
00:12:37.360 - 00:13:18.084, Speaker A: Is going to be pretty sticky and dominant. Univ three is already super dominant on chain. And then once you have hooks and those projects raising significant amounts of money to build strategies that are basically hooks onto unity before, you know, like Sorella and people like this, I think it's getting pretty dominant. It's just a different thing. Right. I feel like Uniswap, the sort of liquidity side is like a headless marketplace, you know, to use like the Jesse's point, like it doesn't need a front end. People just tap into it naturally and then they're going for also being the front end with like Uniswap X and all the stuff they're doing on the financial services side.
00:13:18.084 - 00:13:26.628, Speaker A: Whereas Jupiter just has that front end side to being the front page of Solana. And that's definitely valuable. But I don't know, it's like, but.
00:13:26.676 - 00:13:37.524, Speaker D: Jupyter is launching other tools, like they're launching their perps. I think front end is going to be the most important thing and where the value is going to accrue in Defi. I think I agree.
00:13:37.604 - 00:13:57.100, Speaker A: I've always thought that the front ends are values. But the thing is you can think of wallets, dashboards, all these people could go after this use case just metamask launched there swap aggregator. Like if Phantom launched a swap aggregator, that would effectively because that's the front end kind of before Jupiter, right.
00:13:57.292 - 00:14:00.076, Speaker B: For whatever reason, the wallets haven't been able to do that.
00:14:00.220 - 00:14:20.410, Speaker C: All the front ends are tapping into like the same liquidity though. So in the end there's obviously other market dynamics at play. But I think just thinking about it in a vacuum, if the front end is charging too much in fees, someone else can come in and tap into that liquidity. And so I do think the liquidity owner is the one who has more control of fees.
00:14:20.522 - 00:14:27.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the thing. I mean, one data point is Uniswap added their front end fee. I don't think they've seen any drop.
00:14:27.450 - 00:14:31.194, Speaker D: That's what I. Yeah, that's what I said. Do you know what month I have a good dashboard for this?
00:14:31.354 - 00:14:34.194, Speaker B: I don't know, but wasn't it something around 15 bps?
00:14:34.234 - 00:14:47.516, Speaker D: It was a. Yeah, it was 30 bps, I think. But what. Do you know what month that happening? Because I'm looking at the front end dashboard and Uniswap. And Uniswap X just keep going up. I don't see any drop off.
00:14:47.660 - 00:14:50.180, Speaker A: It was 15 bits, I think, the fee.
00:14:50.372 - 00:14:53.108, Speaker D: Do you know when that happened? Do you know what month that was in?
00:14:53.196 - 00:14:57.584, Speaker A: I think it was October, and it was only for select pairs, as far as I know.
00:14:58.004 - 00:14:59.772, Speaker D: Like, October 2023.
00:14:59.908 - 00:15:01.644, Speaker B: We talked about it on one of these episodes.
00:15:01.684 - 00:15:26.204, Speaker D: Okay, so October 2023, Uniswap Front end. This is from a flashbots dashboard that we can share in the show notes, but Uniswap Front end had 34.4%, and Uniswap X had 2.6%. So you're looking at 37% in total right now. Uniswap Front end has 41%, and Uniswap X front end has 6.6%. So it's, like, even since they added that fee in October, that's of what?
00:15:26.244 - 00:15:28.868, Speaker A: Sorry, of the. Of the trade going through uniswap.
00:15:29.036 - 00:15:54.198, Speaker D: Yes. This is by flashbots. It's basically, like, the volume through front ends, and you have, like, uniswap one inch, matcha defy lama, you know, curve. The telegram bots. Yeah. So, just, like, it's basically probably most organic order flow, and, like, even with adding the 15 bits fee, they have, like, you know, grown, grown. Continue to grow their market share.
00:15:54.198 - 00:16:26.630, Speaker D: Like, yeah, I think the front ends are definitely. Because also, crypto is something where it's, like, super about, like, trust right now where, like, people don't want to switch. Like, they hear of, like, you know, rugs and hacks and stuff. Like, if they know something works. Oh, yeah, 100% if they know something works. And, like, okay, they're going to charge me an extra 20 bips when I'm trying to buy something that might go up five times or go down 50% the next day. Like, I'm going to eat the extra 20 basis points to have something I'm comfortable with and, like, not have to switch to, you know, pay five basis points now on something I'm not.
00:16:26.630 - 00:16:43.654, Speaker D: I don't know. And, like, you know, get comfortable with a whole new interface versus, like, you know, they're very accustomed to using what they know. I think where the front ends are going to compete is, like, on features, right. There's still pretty limited features on, like, uniswap. Yeah.
00:16:44.034 - 00:16:49.610, Speaker A: I think front ends capture a lot of value. It is also, like, somewhat fragile though.
00:16:49.642 - 00:16:49.978, Speaker D: Right?
00:16:50.066 - 00:17:06.638, Speaker A: Opensea was the NFT front end. You would never would have thought, like, what, in sort of 2021, 20, you know, 2020, you never would have thought there would be someone like blur coming in and just taking over. And they really did that by targeting, like, the supply side.
00:17:06.766 - 00:17:07.198, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:07.286 - 00:17:12.914, Speaker A: The kind of liquidity side. I think we've seen a few of these shifts, like, over time.
00:17:15.734 - 00:17:21.820, Speaker C: It's like no innovation combined with no token is because blur, just like the.
00:17:21.892 - 00:17:26.804, Speaker D: Real thing that they had was the token. Right. Like, obviously I'm not like, it is the better.
00:17:26.884 - 00:17:28.308, Speaker B: It is a better ux for, like.
00:17:28.356 - 00:17:29.864, Speaker D: Trading, but like.
00:17:31.884 - 00:17:41.204, Speaker C: To almost no market share. Right. There's obviously most situations are going to be much less drastic, but I think those are the two really that cause it.
00:17:41.364 - 00:17:52.172, Speaker D: Yeah, no, definitely blurry is a good point, but I do think probably. I don't know, but, you know, Blair is a great product, but I think a lot was probably to do with the token and bringing over, like, tensor.
00:17:52.268 - 00:17:55.024, Speaker C: Completely dominated out of nowhere too.
00:17:55.764 - 00:17:56.396, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:17:56.460 - 00:18:03.484, Speaker A: Like, magic Eden had had complete dominance on Solana as well. Right? Like, that was the end crushed by tensor.
00:18:03.604 - 00:18:26.340, Speaker B: When I was using tensor a year ago, you had to list at like 10% below Magic Eden for anyone to notice that it was being listed there. That's how little market share they had. Okay. And now it's. It's something crazy, right. Because it's also, it just is the. They have, they just have, like, the perfect ux, the perfect interface for any.
00:18:26.372 - 00:18:28.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Jupiter just built, like a great product.
00:18:28.412 - 00:18:28.636, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:28.660 - 00:18:38.864, Speaker A: They have, like, the DCA feature. Like, it works really well. Like, it's not easy to build a product that good. And that's why they kind of dominate right now. But we got sidetracked.
00:18:40.534 - 00:18:55.894, Speaker C: Yeah. Because there's always, like, early on when there wasn't much Defi on Solana, everyone was, you know, talking about how good it still. How well it still worked, but it was more so just Solana working fast rather than like, the product itself being that different than its ETH comparable.
00:18:56.054 - 00:19:09.696, Speaker D: And a point on Opensea. I think also there's an opportunity for blur not just with the token, but, like, Opensea probably, like 95% of opensees users just got completely wiped on nfts when everything crashed.
00:19:09.800 - 00:19:10.016, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:10.040 - 00:19:13.744, Speaker D: Like a lot of these nfts just went to zero. So it's like you reset the blur.
00:19:13.784 - 00:19:13.984, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:14.024 - 00:19:24.912, Speaker A: Like people were actually blaming blur for the NFT bear market, right. Because they make it, made it like more efficient to sell and stuff like this. Like, I think people got wrecked across the board. It is like a much better product.
00:19:24.968 - 00:19:45.466, Speaker B: I think everyone blamed, everyone blamed blur for, I mean, the takes made no sense because you just had a false sense of reality with high floor prices and no liquidity. And then when you add liquidity to the market, it's like, okay, the true price is not 150k for a bored ape. Like, it's probably a bit cheaper than that.
00:19:45.610 - 00:20:23.524, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And I also quickly on the front end point, we, maybe we can save this later for like the all coin stuff. But like, I think the telegram bots are actually pretty interesting on the front end because like they're giving like a lot of tooling to users and we've seen them gain a lot of market share while charging pretty high fees. Banana bot, I think, is pretty cool for sniping and limit orders and market orders. And they're building out a web app which is going to act like a trading terminal for on chain. So I think that area of the market, if we think front ends are going to accrue a lot of value, could be an interesting one to look at.
00:20:24.044 - 00:20:26.556, Speaker C: I've gone back and forth on telegram bots.
00:20:26.700 - 00:20:29.580, Speaker D: What, what's the, well, initially, like, the.
00:20:29.612 - 00:20:33.012, Speaker C: Main and main use case still remains the sniping side.
00:20:33.188 - 00:20:33.904, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:34.244 - 00:20:56.788, Speaker C: And because most people aren't trading from their, like, when you're on your desktop, you're not sending messages to a telegram bot to buy and sell assets typically, yeah, it's, there's like a weird gap of kind of user demographic where if you're at your kind of targeting mobile users that want defi.
00:20:56.916 - 00:21:06.476, Speaker D: Yeah, but I think they're building up these web apps which I think are going to be pretty cool and like better than like uniswap or one inch or matcha in their current form, like, in terms of functionality.
00:21:06.540 - 00:21:23.806, Speaker B: How do these actually. Okay, here. I don't, I don't use these because they're not really secure enough for my own, like, anxiety or whatever. But how do, I've never understood how if a lot of people are using these, there's actually any alpha. And, like, the sniping, it's a gas war.
00:21:23.870 - 00:21:24.566, Speaker C: The sniping.
00:21:24.630 - 00:21:25.134, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:25.254 - 00:21:35.966, Speaker C: Like, it worked well at first, but now it's just basically blind submissions for gas to try and get ahead of someone else. And it can be expensive if you're wrong.
00:21:36.150 - 00:22:00.718, Speaker D: But like, banana bot is really dominant in the sniping. They're winning like 90, something like 85 or 90% of the first like top of block bundles because they have like the best tooling for it. So like everyone on bananas like putting in their kind of minor tip to kind of get priority and then it bundles everything together and they've been winning like 90% or something like crazy high like that of the first bundles.
00:22:00.806 - 00:22:05.478, Speaker C: How big of a market? Like, sniping just isn't like that massive market by design.
00:22:05.606 - 00:22:19.164, Speaker D: Well, banana has been doing like, you know, ten to 20 million in volume over the past like few weeks, but they're charging like 50 bps on regular swaps and then a 1% on sniping. So it's like, it's not nothing for sure.
00:22:19.324 - 00:22:25.384, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. It's not nothing. I just, I'm more so, you know, thinking about how much bigger it can get without.
00:22:25.684 - 00:22:27.556, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's, that's where the.
00:22:27.580 - 00:22:55.300, Speaker D: Web apps come in, like right now. I agree. Like the Telegram use case is like very niche, like for the sniping. And also maybe some people who want to be trading on their phone or kind of like have access all the time. But I think the web apps are really cool where you would have basically like a sex like interface, but like on the deck. So it shows all your coins there in your wallet. Like you can do limit orders, you can do DCA, you can do market orders.
00:22:55.300 - 00:23:05.184, Speaker D: You also have the sniping functionality. You know, they can integrate like the coingecko type information in there. So like it's also your, it just becomes like the on chain trading terminal.
00:23:05.514 - 00:23:13.210, Speaker C: Yeah, front end things, you know, they're competing with. It's gone full circle on that front.
00:23:13.402 - 00:23:29.290, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think that how they actually compete with them is like more features. Right. Because like you're only gonna move front ends. Like, I don't think people are gonna be sensitive enough to move front ends for like a few basis points, but I think they will move for like a whole new product suite. But obviously that's gonna cause a war within itself.
00:23:29.442 - 00:24:09.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think there's like two interesting things about it other than the sniping. The first one is just this idea of being closer to where the alpha is that you make like investment decisions based on if you're in a group and you hear about a coin, you can kind of like on telegram which is probably where a lot of the, a lot of the alpha is happening, or discord. You can kind of move to buy it, like straight away with very little friction. You don't have to open an app if you're on your phone especially. It's way less annoying and that's part of it. But I think when you start developing web apps and stuff, like Jan said, you end up going full circle and that advantage isn't really there anymore. And the second thing I think that's interesting is the chat ux.
00:24:09.624 - 00:24:39.364, Speaker A: I do think there's something nice about that, especially as crypto gets more complex and bridging and stuff like this. I do think someone will nail a chat interaction ux where it's like bridge my coins to neutron and like buy this coin or whatever, rather than you having to actually, like, go interact with a bunch of different front ends to do this. It just like sources the root for you and then you like, prove a transaction to do it. And yeah, I'm excited to see, like, more people kind of like, experiment with that.
00:24:39.784 - 00:24:47.384, Speaker C: There's definitely some AI chat functionality is pretty zero to one, right. But it doesn't, like, no one's really anywhere close to that yet.
00:24:47.504 - 00:25:02.918, Speaker D: Well, there's a lot of people working on it with like, this stuff because, like, it can be human readable. Like, hey, do this. And then if they have their custom GPT, then they can try. And it's still early stages, but yeah, that will definitely exist. Yeah.
00:25:02.966 - 00:25:32.424, Speaker A: And that sort of goes against the front ends being dominant point, because in a world with AI where a lot of, and I think in a world with AI, a lot more stuff moves to a chat like UI, obviously you'll still need, front ends are still very useful for a lot of types of interactions, but if we do move to a more chat based world, then you'd imagine wherever users are, they'll just have that UI available rather than there being a specific front end that you go to to do everything.
00:25:35.524 - 00:25:59.968, Speaker D: Okay, yeah, we'll move on, but I think that'll definitely be dominant for the casual user. But people who want the trading terminal feel and lots of information at once, you can't really do that through a chatbot. But for casual users, for sure, yeah, we can move on. I just thought the front endpoint was really interesting and there's a lot of kind of projects, you know, competing in the space. So as we're talking about for sure.
00:26:00.056 - 00:26:08.976, Speaker A: I mean, I think this is where like, wallets and dashboards are pretty undervalued in that they have like a lot of users and they are the like frontest of the front ends.
00:26:09.000 - 00:26:09.136, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:09.160 - 00:26:18.800, Speaker A: Like the first interaction of most people with crypto they just haven't like been able to really build out like a compelling product suite around that yet. But I think it'll happen.
00:26:18.912 - 00:26:40.364, Speaker C: But anyway, no, no one last to a front end. It's like the wallet is no longer relevant. Right. Like you know, I mean the moat it's generated I think isn't really anywhere near strong because, and it's part of their design is they want to be as easily integratable as possible. So I think it's, it's a tricky spot at the same time.
00:26:40.904 - 00:26:57.748, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's, there's like good odds that front ends and solvers is basically what captures most value eventually. Market makers for the most part. Yeah. Maybe not great solvers.
00:26:57.836 - 00:27:04.196, Speaker D: Yeah. Like right. And then instead of having our liquidity pools we're just going to get whatever market maker to quote you.
00:27:04.300 - 00:27:05.748, Speaker B: But you can also have an app.
00:27:05.796 - 00:27:07.356, Speaker D: That has, I don't see how that's.
00:27:07.380 - 00:27:23.302, Speaker A: Like it's, it's the status quo. Is that plus, but worse. Right. Like market makers, the big market makers have like special relationships with centralized exchanges. They have like zero fee accounts and stuff. So they can trade this stuff back and forth. Like the solver meta is at least like a level playing field.
00:27:23.478 - 00:27:23.838, Speaker D: Right?
00:27:23.886 - 00:27:43.058, Speaker B: Yeah. Also just the solver to, can be like an app, can have its own app specific like solving algorithm that it owns in like a proprietary way. So doesn't have to be necessarily like market maker. But let's move on to. Are we talking about the salon outage?
00:27:43.146 - 00:27:51.834, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Do you want to give some, some context on what happened the client? Yeah, so, and maybe like compared to the last ones. Right, which were, which were.
00:27:51.874 - 00:28:47.758, Speaker B: Yeah, well the last one. The last one I think was kind of a bug too. So historically most of the salon outages had to do with like NFT mints and spamming the chain and there were so many inbound spam transactions at once that kind of overloaded validators. The last couple ones have been client bugs. And so this latest one was a bug that got introduced in a new upgrade a couple weeks ago and apparently it was actually found on Testnet, but the mainnet fix had not been deployed yet. And so speculation is someone just decided to manually halt the chain because they knew about this bug that was on testnet. But, but yeah, so that was around like five eastern or something and then 2 hours after that they decided to do a full restart, and then 3 hours after that, it was back up.
00:28:47.758 - 00:29:13.224, Speaker B: So it was like 5 hours from down to up, 3 hours from when they decided restart to up. So, I mean, what's that meme where it's like, we're getting exceedingly efficient at this. Like, they're getting pretty good at the, at the, at the chain restarts. Um, like, the validator coordination, but. So, so it's in. So let's think. Okay, let's see how the market, the market, like, didn't really care.
00:29:13.224 - 00:29:14.084, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:14.864 - 00:29:26.624, Speaker D: If this was a malicious, like, try and halt the chain and short it. It's like, picking 05:00 a.m.. Est is, like, probably the worst time you could have done. Yeah, they were, like, actually trying to do something malicious.
00:29:26.704 - 00:30:16.390, Speaker B: So here's what I'll say about these, like, outages. I think the fact that, um, like, Solana did not lose any users after this tells you a lot about retail liking to use the chain. And, you know, Solana has something that no other ecosystem has right now. People like to use it. At the same time. Uh, you know, you're never going to have, you can't have a super vibrant defi ecosystem handling, like, billions of dollars if you have liveness failures. Right? They're kind of like a, you know, I understand the decision to prioritize, like, safety over liveness, but for Defi, liveness is kind of safety at the same time.
00:30:16.390 - 00:30:59.160, Speaker B: It's not like, purely a computer science problem you're dealing with anymore, because you have all these other repercussions. And let's face it, all the outages, for the most part, have come in kind of like, low, volatile periods. This last one was the most dead you could possibly think of. The Americans woke up and it was back on. Okay, so there's, there's, listen, you. One of these days, it's probably going to lead to a pretty bad defi day because it's going to go down and then, you know, Putin's going to launch some nuke or something at the same time. And, like, there's other factors that come into play of the timing of it that, yeah, it's not a good, like, situation.
00:30:59.160 - 00:31:02.936, Speaker B: Right. And so, I mean, it's less, there's.
00:31:02.960 - 00:31:05.256, Speaker A: A little bit of, like, level setting, right?
00:31:05.280 - 00:31:16.912, Speaker C: Because before, there wasn't really any defi, so that, like, the, the notional, the VAR was pretty low, whereas as this, as defi picks up, you don't really need much of a move for there to be a lot of value lost yeah.
00:31:17.048 - 00:31:19.820, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it is worth, like.
00:31:19.852 - 00:31:27.356, Speaker A: Contextualizing, though, a little bit, where, like, every, every chain has liveness issues other than, like, ethel one.
00:31:27.460 - 00:31:28.060, Speaker D: Right?
00:31:28.212 - 00:31:40.996, Speaker A: Like, cosmos chains have liveness issues. Like, definitely. There's been, there's been a couple of outages since the last Solana one across. Like, a lot of the major Cosmos chains, l two s have outages.
00:31:41.060 - 00:31:41.284, Speaker C: Right?
00:31:41.324 - 00:32:00.370, Speaker A: Arbitrum went down in December because they got. The sequencer got, got overloaded. Like, every chain other than Ethel one has had, has had outages. It's just that Solana has the most users and the most eyes on it, and obviously, like, has a history of this stuff, so, so it gets targeted the most. But I do think it's worth putting.
00:32:00.402 - 00:32:32.856, Speaker B: That, like, this is. Yeah, this is something I was saying a year ago. Like, people need, are going to have to start getting more comfortable with liveness failures, because they are going to happen more and more. And, you know, since l two s are so centralized, it actually makes them having liveness failures not as bad, because it's a lot easier for them to get restarted up quickly. You don't have to coordinate, like, in Solana, you don't have to coordinate with all these validators and get 80% stake. Agreed on something. When you have the L two with one sequencer, as soon as you fix the bug, it's like, okay, let's get back at it.
00:32:32.856 - 00:33:06.904, Speaker B: Right? But this is something with, with Solana that they have the single client, right? Just like Tenderman chains have a single client. These bugs are going to happen. Like, they have to be in your, like, risk framework or whatever. And so I know Solana has a lot of clients. Obviously, they've got fire dancer. They've also got this other one called zig or zug, there's another client coming. And so the theory is that, I mean, in a perfect world, you would have four clients and everyone running 25%.
00:33:06.904 - 00:33:42.702, Speaker B: And so if one of them has a bug like this, the network can still continue. That's, like, the ideal world. In reality, we know that's not going to happen. Like, even on Ethereum today, 80 over 80% run geth as the execution client. So if there's, like, a bad geth bug, like, that's pretty bad. And so what, like, the theory on Solana is, is, okay, everybody's gonna run firedancer because it's more performant, but we'll also run, like, another client in the background that kind of lags behind. And so if there's, like, some big bug in fire dancer, everyone can kind of, like, pick up with the behind client.
00:33:42.702 - 00:34:19.744, Speaker B: And so I'm, uh. This is, like, a theory. Okay. Uh, I don't know what that handoff would be, especially if one client is a lot less performant as well. Like, do fees just spike on the chain, like, pretty quickly because now you have a lot less throughput. Um, are you actually able to do that handoff cleanly without, you know, something happening? I don't know, but that's kind of the, like, thinking right now on how to fix these liveness issues in the future.
00:34:19.904 - 00:34:21.808, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the market didn't really care.
00:34:21.936 - 00:34:22.392, Speaker D: Right?
00:34:22.488 - 00:34:39.467, Speaker B: Like, I had a poll. I had a poll during the outage. Okay, this was during the outage. And I said, sol ETH is 0.04 right now. Will it be higher or lower in three months? And higher was the majority vote. Can you imagine if this happened in July and Sol leaketh was 0.01.
00:34:39.467 - 00:35:03.442, Speaker B: Okay, so, like, 75% lower. And I did that same poll on zero on 0.01. Majority would say lower, 100%. Right. And so the timing of the outage is good that it happened after, like, Solana kind of came back from the dead. Right. Like, path dependency matters so much that if this happened before, like, the FTX estate, all that stuff.
00:35:03.442 - 00:35:07.802, Speaker B: Right. When everyone was scared about that. And so, yeah, yeah.
00:35:07.818 - 00:35:17.690, Speaker C: I think a lot of people waiting for a dip. And if this didn't. If this didn't cause it, then it's. You kind of need a broader market pull back in order to get it.
00:35:17.882 - 00:35:18.442, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:18.538 - 00:35:24.548, Speaker D: Centers is always away. 05:00 a.m.. EST. He hears Solan is down. He instantly wakes up.
00:35:24.636 - 00:35:26.188, Speaker B: And it totally slept through the whole thing.
00:35:26.236 - 00:35:26.812, Speaker D: He didn't even.
00:35:26.868 - 00:35:28.504, Speaker B: He woke up and it was already back.
00:35:29.964 - 00:35:31.548, Speaker D: There you go. It's decentralized.
00:35:31.636 - 00:35:32.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:32.612 - 00:35:41.436, Speaker A: So not much. Not too much more to say about that. Do we want to go into ETH narratives and especially, like, the Eigen lair and restaking points meta?
00:35:41.540 - 00:36:16.314, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know if we've talked about points, but, like, what are the things people are looking at right now? I think the two main ones are Eigen layer with restaking. And then today we got an official launch date for 4844, which is the new fee market where rollups can post blobs instead of call data. And so this is, like, a separate fee market for rollups. It's supposed to be a lot cheaper for them to post their data. There's a lot of hand wavy. People will say, like, ten to 100 x cheaper.
00:36:16.314 - 00:36:50.130, Speaker B: There's no real. There's too many variables at play to know, like how much cheaper this is actually going to end up being for roll ups. And also, like, if a lot just start deploying here, it'll get saturated pretty quick, which is like, not a bad thing. Obviously you're facilitating more demand, but it doesn't necessarily mean that fees are going to be a lot cheaper. But this is important because we've seen a lot of roll ups start to move from Ethereum Da to things like Celestia Eigen Da is coming soon. Avail is coming soon. Know arbitrage has their antitrust data availability committees.
00:36:50.130 - 00:37:11.266, Speaker B: And so it is important timing in this whole narrative of like Da and the optimal kind of like, roll up construction. So I imagine you'll see a lot of people talking the next month about ETH beta. Just with like, restaking is a big narrative. The EA 4844 is a big narrative blast unlock when, whenever that happens, it's.
00:37:11.290 - 00:37:35.956, Speaker C: Like a big blast right now. So it's kind of the precursor. Right. You have and all those people that put in blast are decently maxi. So, yeah, like, it's not a scenario where they leave the ecosystem. It's probably one where they just continue restaking into like these kind of these, or dial into ETH beta with all the kind of additional catalysts behind it.
00:37:36.140 - 00:38:11.244, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's gonna be a good month for some, like on chain stuff. Like, I feel like a lot of like the on chain, like kind of like small or mid cap stuff has kind of moved over to Solana recently. It's like died down a lot. I think, like the like, eigen lair and blast of definitely taking like liquidity out of, out of the market for ETH. So, like, you know, blast getting unlocked, coming back. Also, I'm doing like an airdrop. Like, hopefully it just kind of gets the velocity of money up more on EVM a bit, which I think we should see some action, which is nice.
00:38:11.244 - 00:38:12.812, Speaker D: And then you kind of.
00:38:12.988 - 00:38:31.420, Speaker C: Yeah, so like, you know, we talked about how the FDB stuff is a bit of a money suck. I think this has the potential to do that later on. But in the beginning, it'll be more of a, like a vacuum, but in a bullish way.
00:38:31.452 - 00:38:31.572, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:31.588 - 00:39:03.390, Speaker C: It'll, I think, attract a lot of existing kind of Ethan and other liquidity, and then you're going to create, like, blast is going to try and basically recreate all of their own ecosystem projects. And so you have a fresh set of incentives for all of that. And it's all going to be looped and gamified. So I think you're going to have, you know, a very reflexive kind of period. But, you know, it always. The more reflective it is, the harder the unwind. And so it can prove to be like pretty bad in the end.
00:39:03.390 - 00:39:05.558, Speaker C: But I think as much.
00:39:05.646 - 00:39:22.006, Speaker B: As much as I think blast is like a total abomination it is going to have. I can just imagine the craziest stuff on that chain. And so I totally expect a lot of people to not even care about any security properties or anything now and stuffs launching.
00:39:22.030 - 00:39:24.182, Speaker C: They're like not super audited.
00:39:24.358 - 00:39:48.586, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. So that I think will be good for EVM in the short term. And if like the broader market holds up throughout these next couple of months and like tech stocks are ripping and bitcoin's bouncing really nicely. So, like, if that holds up, I think you could get some. Some good activity. But yeah, I think like, right. Or the past few months, the activity has mostly been on like kind of these Solana, like on chain stuff.
00:39:48.586 - 00:40:13.480, Speaker D: And then, you know, on their. On your celestias or saves or serious where it's like, you know, you have like potential for like multi x's on kind of these like massive chains rather than, you know, in the kind of ethereum, like small to mid cap, like more on chain centric stuff. So I think they'll probably be like kind of a rotation back to like on ETH.
00:40:13.592 - 00:40:19.088, Speaker B: Celestia is just staking. Right? That's a cosmos chain. That's what cosmos chains are always. That's always the narrative.
00:40:19.216 - 00:41:00.586, Speaker D: Yeah, I think like when you have like the Solana, like casino running and then kind of these like large caps, like, you know, during like 2345 axis that you can like trade on leverage. Then it makes the like ETH kind of like that. That area of like, you know, like 100 mil to like a billion, like sub. A billion cap on ETH that's like defy or kind of different on chain plays like less attractive. Especially as like liquidity is leaving to, you know, Solana or getting locked in blast or Eigen lair. So if that kind of starts coming back, I think there, there could be a decent rotation there. All else equal, like the market equal and stuff.
00:41:00.586 - 00:41:01.258, Speaker D: But yeah.
00:41:01.346 - 00:41:21.006, Speaker A: Do we think Eigen layer is going to be like. Yeah. What do you think the Eigen layer launch is going to be like? And how's everyone playing? I guess their ETH right now? I guess you bullish Eigen layer points or you locking in like fixed yields right now? Like what? Yeah, what does everyone think on that.
00:41:21.030 - 00:41:27.134, Speaker B: Side, I don't really know, like, what are they launched? Like, Eigen Da is what's coming first.
00:41:27.214 - 00:41:27.834, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:28.214 - 00:42:08.046, Speaker B: I mean, the, the liquid restaking stuff, it kind of reminds me of when people were making all these index tokens of lsts a year ago, and it's just new tokens on top of other tokens to get to, like, print more incentives. And so I do think that, like, liquid restaking tokens will be pretty popular. They're also quite dangerous overall, but I do think they'll be pretty popular. But at this point, it's like nobody, everyone is just getting points because it's like, what else is there to do with ETH? There's nothing to do with eat these days besides restaking. Right. And so because there's no, there's no me, there's no trading activity or anything. Right.
00:42:08.046 - 00:42:20.334, Speaker B: It's all moved. So what are you going to do? You're going to restake it? Right? And everyone is kind of just going into the liquid restaking protocols to get, you know, new tokens from those protocols and everything.
00:42:21.074 - 00:42:22.050, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know.
00:42:22.162 - 00:42:23.690, Speaker B: I don't have, like, strong takes on it.
00:42:23.722 - 00:42:38.226, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, yeah. Like, I think that there's definitely a window of opportunity where, like, this stuff goes crazy, but, like, as Yana saying, it's, like, very reflexive. So, like, it goes crazy to the upside and then, you know, it crashes.
00:42:38.410 - 00:42:39.854, Speaker A: To the downside.
00:42:41.554 - 00:42:48.682, Speaker C: And prices ripped a lot. It's like, it's not really going to. You kind of want to be one of the earlier ones running for the door to some extent.
00:42:48.818 - 00:43:22.310, Speaker D: Yeah. And then you have this. And I know I've, like, brought this point a bunch of times, but I think it's an important one to just be aware of. Like, obviously, you know, this isn't happening right now, but as more and more of these infra plays come out with, like, massive ftvs and, like, small circulating caps, there's going to be a time where, like, the tide shifts on this stuff. Like, dimension just launched again. Like $1 billion circ, $7 billion ftv. You know, Jupiter launched, you know, 700k or 700 million circ, 5 billion ftv.
00:43:22.310 - 00:43:46.950, Speaker D: Wormhole dis announced their token. They're trading at like, a five or 6 billion FTV on the premarket. I think that's just in the past two weeks. Like, you have blast coming out, you have Eigen layer. Like, this is some that we've been talking about and already, like, you know, Celestia, which is like, tens of billions of tokens to be unlocked. Same with optimism. Arbitrum like, so like, say sue, like, so many of these.
00:43:46.950 - 00:44:17.380, Speaker D: Yeah, it's locks. Like, it's literally like 50, maybe $100 billion of unlocks coming, you know, over the next few years. And that is like going to be a massive liquidity suck on the ecosystem at some point as like everyone's up so much on their investments and like, you know, VC's and teams are selling. So it's just something to be aware of in the background. It's not happening like tomorrow, but that eventually, like there's going to be a time where a lot of this stuff is probably going to be down 80, 90.
00:44:17.572 - 00:44:53.768, Speaker C: I think the setup is also, you know, you have a lot of bullish catalysts in the next few months with blast, Eigen 4844, the halving I think in ETF flows have kind of reversed to being somewhat decently positive. So you're going to have this massive run up. And I think the. And this isn't completely finalized, but I think one initial soft deadline is going to be the first unlock of the first massive, like ten figure FDV.
00:44:53.896 - 00:44:55.884, Speaker D: Well, yeah, arbitrum is in March.
00:44:56.464 - 00:44:56.896, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:56.960 - 00:44:57.880, Speaker C: Arbitrum.
00:44:58.032 - 00:44:58.296, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:58.320 - 00:45:05.408, Speaker C: Arbitrary is a big one, but like, it doesn't really, there's not too many on the ETH side. I think it's more of the new ones that are coming out that have.
00:45:05.536 - 00:45:10.192, Speaker B: Sweet has a pretty big one in May. So a couple billion unlock.
00:45:10.288 - 00:46:12.330, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just like who is going to like when they create, when they launch this thing, let's say the $1 billion circulating and like a $10 billion FTV. It's like they're launching with the market maker to like they maybe hype up the pre market. Like we've seen with like Jup and Dimension. Not saying like the teams have done that, but like people are kind of like hyping up the price and people anchor their perceptions. It launches at around that price with not that much float and there's like enough hype and like anchoring that. Like people will come in and buy it and kind of support, you know, the $1 billion FDB or, sorry, the $1 billion circulating cap and like, it's not even that much volume a lot of times, like on, on that circulating cap and then like, the amount of liquidity it takes to support that versus when like the real unlocks of like one way flow of selling start coming out from like, you know, team or VC's is just like literally hundreds of millions, billions of dollars of like it depends, right? Offsetting flows. Yeah, it depends how the token set up.
00:46:12.362 - 00:46:25.254, Speaker A: But yeah, like Shui is not too bad because they raised at the peak of the, of the bull and I'm pretty sure they raised it like a b or multi b valuation. And there's a few others like that. There's.
00:46:26.554 - 00:46:29.090, Speaker B: And they had a killer trade with the FTX estate.
00:46:29.162 - 00:47:05.014, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Alameda allocation. Yeah, these are all like, these are a lot of, these are very different from each other. I think there's like a few factors that kind of way into it. If you wanted to do a better analysis, it would be like how many preview. I mean, obviously the team, like the team allocation is important, investor allocation, but then how many rounds have been done previously and what's sort of like the unrealized gain that these people are sitting on in like dollar terms and then also just like secondary volume, right? Because I mean, Solana was a famous one, right, with spfs. Sell me all you can, then go fuck off thing.
00:47:05.014 - 00:47:08.372, Speaker A: Everyone thought it was going to be bearish, huh?
00:47:08.548 - 00:47:26.428, Speaker C: It doesn't really happen as much anymore. I mean people are selling, but like with Solana, they were doing a lot of re staggering of unlocks, which helped, right. And that I think was one of the big things the market didn't price in which you're not really seeing adjustments to unlocks anymore, but you are seeing.
00:47:26.516 - 00:47:41.904, Speaker A: Some of these things trade meaningful, meaningfully on secondaries, right, where the cost basis resets. And that, that matters a lot. But it's hard to get good data on this. It's just when you look at some of the seed rounds, right, like you can kind of get a feel for how heavy, how happy this stuff is.
00:47:42.484 - 00:48:31.014, Speaker C: There's definitely supporting the, like sometimes I think, you know, when the whole market is running, I think it gets also really difficult as a holder to justify. So like Jup, for example, right? I mean, when, if the whole market is, is gradually trending higher, how much, you know, upside do you really think there is in, and not to pick on Jupiter just because we're talking about it now and it has pretty high FTV, it's like sometimes it's hard to see. I think that's why meme coins do well, because you have these insane ceilings, whereas am I really going to hold something at a pretty rich valve or not that much upside? That's the other tricky element for me is who is really comfortable holding these when everything else is doing a lot better.
00:48:31.174 - 00:49:17.992, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just like I feel like we're accelerating into the point where it's like, okay, you know, there was some of these in 2021, but, like, we're accelerating and even like going back to 2017, like eos and stuff where they raise, like, insane amount of money and, like, these absurd valuations. But, like, now you're getting to the point where it's accelerating and it's like we've had two launches and three launches basically in the past two weeks of like, Jup. 6 billion dimension, 7 billion wormhole hasn't launched yet. But the premarket string at 6 billion, it's like, that's like three in the last two weeks. It's like, it's starting to accelerate because people have, like, caught on, like the highest ev thing in the world right now is to get a group of developers, get some good marketing people, raise from some good vc's and launch a multi billion.
00:49:18.048 - 00:49:20.592, Speaker A: But none of that's happening now, though. Like all the stuff.
00:49:20.728 - 00:49:21.024, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:21.064 - 00:49:23.952, Speaker A: People who are launching now are people who build through a brutal bear market.
00:49:24.048 - 00:49:29.152, Speaker D: This has been true for like seven years. So it's like, accelerate.
00:49:29.208 - 00:49:45.312, Speaker A: Well, I mean, if you're in crypto, pivot to AI, like, this was like a brutal bear market where most people, like, a lot of people threw in the towel. Like, no one was raising money then. Like a lot of. Yeah, like, I don't know. The people that are capitalizing on this now, definitely.
00:49:45.328 - 00:49:52.610, Speaker D: Yeah, they started in 2021, like, when they first saw it get crazy. Like a three year cycle, three year lag, two to three year lag.
00:49:52.762 - 00:50:03.254, Speaker A: I mean, if you timed it perfectly, you could come in, do a project raise and then. Yeah, but you still have to have to, like, live through, you know, Luna FTX, like the.
00:50:03.634 - 00:50:27.494, Speaker D: For sure, but I'm just saying, like, it's like, over the past, like, few years, this trade, I feel like, has been in, like, rewarded insanely. Like, you're literally minting like hundred millionaires on paper. It's like from, from this, like in, in team tokens from, like a project that takes, like, you know, a few years to do.
00:50:27.654 - 00:50:42.806, Speaker B: I do think that this also could be why, like, ETH could be a late cycle asset. Uh, because as all the unlocks come through, people start to sell a lot of those into, like, ETH if they want to just maintain, like, market exposure.
00:50:42.870 - 00:50:59.344, Speaker D: Yeah, it's. It's kind of tough, right. Because it's like, where is this money coming from and then where does it go? Like, I think a lot of it's coming from the ecosystem and a lot of it's going to VC's and, like, founders who, like, I don't think they're going to, like, necessarily redeploy all of it. Like, I think.
00:51:01.964 - 00:51:05.012, Speaker C: You know, it's not really real gains yet for a lot.
00:51:05.028 - 00:51:24.632, Speaker D: Of this stuff, for sure. No, of course not. Because, like, there's no way that the market could handle if everyone just started selling these right now. There's just not enough liquidity in the market to handle this. But, like, that's why I'm saying, like, at some point, it's going to turn and it's like, these things are going to be down, like, 50, the 170, 80%.
00:51:24.768 - 00:51:44.580, Speaker B: The one thing I'll say with this is that airdrops at least give retail the first chance at locking in gains. Right. So if you. If, like, you. You don't, like, kind of the mechanics of how this works and everything, and you think they're going to be down only with all the unlocks, the first people that can sell are people who got free tokens.
00:51:44.612 - 00:51:44.756, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:44.780 - 00:51:47.140, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's also, like, a lot of simplers, too.
00:51:47.212 - 00:52:10.662, Speaker D: Simpler. Insane infrastructure. Like, the guy on Twitter, I think Evan has had some good tweets about this. Like, he's been tweeting about, like, Celestia and Jada past, like, 48 hours, just like, saying, like, okay, if this was, like, the top wallet, this is how many tokens they got. And then if they spread it across, like, a hundred wallets or a thousand wallets, they would have got, like, 50,000 times more.
00:52:10.838 - 00:52:17.294, Speaker C: You're optimizing with full information. Right? Like, you. When you're doing it ahead of time, you have no idea what the thresholds are and.
00:52:17.414 - 00:52:22.438, Speaker D: Yeah, well, yeah, like, who knows how much of this leaked?
00:52:22.526 - 00:53:15.634, Speaker A: Just maybe throw something in. Like, did you guys read that Travis Kling post about, like, none of this, like, the sort of more. How the cycle is a bit more brazen in that there's more of an admission that, like, some of this stuff doesn't do anything and is never going to do anything. It was obviously a pretty negative post, and I guess he's been kind of jaded for a little while. But I resonate with the sentiment of it, at least from my experience in previous cycles. It seems like now there's just more, like, infrastructure where it's extremely clear that it's, like, capitalizing on a narrative and it doesn't really make sense fundamentally. And obviously, meme coins and all this stuff, it's a bit of a financial dystopia, a result of people, a bit of a financial dystopia.
00:53:15.634 - 00:53:34.724, Speaker A: Whereas in previous cycles, I feel like the things that succeeded, they had fundamental narratives that made sense. Thor chain had a use case that made sense. The file coins of this world, there was, like, a narrative behind them that kind of made sense where some of this stuff now just. Just makes less sense.
00:53:34.844 - 00:53:38.740, Speaker D: Yeah, because that's what the market's rewarding for.
00:53:38.772 - 00:53:38.980, Speaker A: Warning.
00:53:39.012 - 00:53:52.360, Speaker D: Like, eventually the market or whoever's bidding up these things will run out of money because it's ridiculous and they're just getting constantly dumped on. And eventually those people will run out of money and the market will become more efficient, and then the market won't reward this stuff anymore.
00:53:52.452 - 00:54:18.564, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's all still on the way up. So you have price discovery, so people keep bidding, whereas kind of the stuff that was previously built reached some level of ceiling because there's, you know, either a fundamental way to kind of value it or some other reason. And so, yeah, that's. It's been. It's like speculation ends up being the primary kind of driver of all this stuff. And. And because a lot of this stuff is just still going up.
00:54:18.564 - 00:54:20.114, Speaker C: Money keeps falling there.
00:54:20.194 - 00:54:36.458, Speaker B: Yeah, there are. There are some, like, new apps that, I mean, drip house is cool or caster has been getting buzz. I do think deep in, we will see some. I know it's like a mimi word. I do think there'll be, like, some real stuff that comes out of that. But. But to your point, like, yeah, it.
00:54:36.458 - 00:54:56.022, Speaker B: We have, you know, at the end of 2020, we were in a year ahead, and we said it's going to be a big year for infra because we don't have the right infra to scale. And. And so now it's like, we don't need much more infra. And so. But these things go in cycles between infra app. Like, the big app was Defi. Right.
00:54:56.022 - 00:55:09.914, Speaker B: But Defi is really just back end. It's not front facing, like, tech. It needs to be back end. And so now we need to get. We had the backend figured out. Now we need to get these, like, front end applications. So.
00:55:10.254 - 00:55:36.044, Speaker D: Yeah, no, and I definitely, like, don't want it to be all, like, we're bearish. It's just like, where we are in the market right now. It's where the incentives are. I definitely think we could do an episode on, like, you know, positive use cases and interesting applications I've been listening to recently. Like, Balaji just posted, like, maybe ten days ago, his, like, network state podcast. He's posted ten episodes. A bunch of them are on crypto it's actually like, you know, if you want some good hopium about the future and how crypto really bullish on network.
00:55:36.084 - 00:56:08.490, Speaker A: States, I mean, there's still a lot of narratives that I'm really bullish on. I just mean, sort of like the stuff that's being rewarded, like you said. Yeah, a lot of it is. And then there's like the people that see it being rewarded and go to build the same things and there's like a lot of people front running the meta, like, oh, I'm on this all l one. And like, there's literally nothing here, but this thing's trading at multi billion dollars. So I'm going to build, like, I'm going to do an NFT collection or an NFT marketplace because it's the only beta on l one. And, you know, like these games being played, which is just.
00:56:08.490 - 00:56:29.802, Speaker A: And then people fund it and like, it kind of becomes reflexive and that's a bit of a shame. But yeah, I think we should. We could definitely do an episode on. I think we will actually, like on a week where we don't have as much to talk about. Do the one on narratives where we just cover like, the main crypto narratives. Which ones were we're excited about, but network states there's a lot of really cool stuff happening. Like, yeah, let's talk about on a future episode.
00:56:29.802 - 00:56:53.794, Speaker A: But we've been on this for a while. I want to move to Altcoin Corner if people have stuff to cover. I know ceteris is. Doesn't like it. He can give you a little highbrow, snooty rat about how you don't approve of this as the head of our institutional research arm. But the people have spoken and they demand alpha. So we're going to go quick alcohol corner and then call it.
00:56:53.794 - 00:56:59.994, Speaker A: Who wants to start? I mean, Duncan, you dressed up for this one, so maybe you want to.
00:57:00.454 - 00:57:45.304, Speaker D: Synapse sweater on and the mug. And then also I'm wearing the sweatpants. But I'm not going to show you guys that because this is kind of like what just shows this, like, kind of these new coins being rewarded with these, like, high ftbs. But wormhole is like on hyper hyper liquid, I think is trading pre market at like 5.7 billion, which is like insane. And synapse, one of my long time holdings, is doing so. In the past seven days, wormhole has done set or portal by wormhole has done 71 million in volume and snaps done 460 million in volume and yet snaps trading like 130 million market cap.
00:57:45.304 - 00:58:21.826, Speaker D: So it's like, you know, 35 x difference and it's. It's doing five times the amount of volume in the past seven days as a bridge. And they also have the vision of like the, the sinter chain and like, connecting these, like, these different roll ups and EVM stuff, etcetera. I don't want you to grow me on it because I couldn't explain how it works, but I think it's a very similar vision. And, you know, the team at Synapse is obviously really smart, but it's just like, goes to show kind of a product with like a lot of users and a lot of usage at like 130 mil bridges is an interesting one.
00:58:21.850 - 00:58:57.756, Speaker A: Right, because you had layer zero, I think, raised, and by the way, we're investors in layer zero, but they raised the last round at three bill in 2021. Obviously, since then, I think it's 2021 or 2022. Since then, have had a lot of progress. And then I think wormhole also raised the last round of like two and a half or something like this. And the actual bridges that are trading on public markets are trading well below this. Axelar, which is doing really well in fundamentals, is trading at like one bill or so. And then Synapse has obviously been crushed, trading like 100 mill, something like this.
00:58:57.756 - 00:59:18.432, Speaker A: So it'll be interesting if there is like a repricing once the, once these other bridges launch, which are obviously going to be like huge launches. I think wormhole and layer zero are both like awesome teams been executing for a while. Will be big launches, but. Yeah, yeah, I know you have some altcoins too. You wanted to. To cover or do you now?
00:59:18.448 - 00:59:24.112, Speaker C: I was basically going to. I think, like, ETH beta is a good setup. Going into a lot of these unlocks.
00:59:24.248 - 00:59:29.760, Speaker D: Synapse can move the money around from all these chains. They just launched their RFQ bridging, which.
00:59:29.792 - 00:59:32.688, Speaker B: Is basically like, listen, man, this is what I'll say about ETH beta.
00:59:32.736 - 00:59:34.164, Speaker D: Like 100k.
00:59:36.664 - 00:59:47.482, Speaker B: Ethan, ETH beta, you have all these narratives. You had a fucking Solana outage. This is the time when to like kind of make a move.
00:59:47.538 - 00:59:50.322, Speaker D: Right center is. No one cares about this line outage, though.
00:59:50.418 - 00:59:56.254, Speaker B: Currently not. It's already above the. Solely. The sole leader ratio is already above where it was when I went out. So.
00:59:58.914 - 01:00:05.186, Speaker A: Yeah, you want to go more specific? You want to talk about your role, beta or anything else as well.
01:00:05.330 - 01:00:08.734, Speaker C: Still the fundamentally cheapest protocol in the space.
01:00:08.894 - 01:00:16.326, Speaker A: If the revenues. If the revenues are real. Yeah, the market seems to be pricing in that the revenues are definitely not real, which is weird.
01:00:16.430 - 01:01:15.854, Speaker C: I think it's more about the market. Sorry, how the market values buy and burn versus a rev share model, where buy and burn just takes is a much longer time horizon value accruals system versus yield repricing much more near term because you know, there's an actual yield and so somebody will bid it up to some market equivalent yield. Whereas buy and burn is just, you kind of hold until it's supply and demand, but you have some assistance on the demand side. But I think, you know, it's basically over a longer time horizon, buy and burn leads to a higher value, but over shorter time horizons, yield does. And then I think you discount buy and burn more based on kind of going concern, right? Because if the, if the value doesn't accrue until far out and you have going concern around the project, then you discount the present value even more. And so I think that's kind of what's happening at the moment. But yeah, the business itself is still burning 2% of supply a month.
01:01:15.854 - 01:01:18.154, Speaker C: So pretty nuts.
01:01:21.014 - 01:02:16.110, Speaker B: Yeah. One thing, you've been seeing this on Twitter, a lot of like the dimension airdrop, right? They gave a bunch to like pudgy penguins, uh, mad lads, bad kids. And I own all these disclosure, but I think you, you, it seems like this is a new narrative that is starting to pick up, that people think that NFT communities are going to be targeted in airdrops more. Um, because it's somewhat less, it's somewhat harder to Sybil, I guess, because you actually have to like, put up meaningful capital to get these things. And I think like, you know, you've seen bad kid, bad kids, like double in the last week and pudgies go up again and everyone's talking about, you know, are pudgies gonna get like layer zero airdrop and all this. So I think this is a bit of a narrative shift or like nfts. I think like, yeah, the targeting them sort of deal.
01:02:16.110 - 01:02:28.862, Speaker B: Now, maybe this is just made up by the NFT communities because all these people own free tokens. So, like, whenever I see the, whenever I see the pudgy guys and they're like, airdrop to us. Cause like we're gonna diamond hand. I mean, I don't know.
01:02:28.998 - 01:02:40.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're also like, I guess in the cycle of large projects doing airdrops, we're a decent chunk of the way through. There's not that many left.
01:02:41.014 - 01:02:43.814, Speaker D: We'll blast probably Eigen layer too.
01:02:43.974 - 01:02:48.882, Speaker C: It's gonna stay within blast anoma wormhole.
01:02:49.018 - 01:02:54.682, Speaker D: Layer, zero yeah, there's five that will launch in multibillion dollar FD.
01:02:54.858 - 01:03:02.394, Speaker A: Yeah, let's wrap it. It was a long one. All right, guys, thanks very much for tuning in for one more episode of the Hive Mind, and see you again in two weeks. Bye.
