00:00:00.160 - 00:00:05.174, Speaker A: So I watched the interview that Elizabeth Warren did recently where she said that platinum has intrinsic value but bitcoin doesn't.
00:00:05.214 - 00:00:10.510, Speaker B: If I buy bitcoin, am I buying a share of stock or am I buying a pork belly?
00:00:10.542 - 00:00:10.942, Speaker A: What am I buying?
00:00:10.958 - 00:00:12.694, Speaker C: Are you buying air?
00:00:12.854 - 00:00:13.382, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:00:13.438 - 00:00:26.230, Speaker C: You're buying something that other people believe either is going to go up in value. Presumably that's why you're buying it or think it's going to go down in value, which is presumably why someone else is selling it.
00:00:26.262 - 00:00:43.374, Speaker A: Platinum only has value because we have ascribed it value. It's just a metal at the end of the day it doesn't buy you food or take you out for dinner. The same with bitcoin. We've decided that bitcoin have a certain amount of value and even more people in the world have decided that the US dollar has value. As soon as people stop believing in these ideas, these narratives, then all of it loses their value.
