This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hi, everyone. My name is Jose Macedou. I'm back, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. The goal of the podcast is to provide an inside look into the Delphi hive mind, combining some of our brightest minds from research ventures and labs. So with us today, as always, there's Jan Lieberman, who's our managing partners at ventures.
00:00:46.454 - 00:00:59.824, Speaker A: There's Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, and ceteris from, from research. Guys, I've been, I've been out of the loop for like a month for various reasons. What are we, what are we covering today? Where are we starting?
00:01:03.644 - 00:01:12.424, Speaker B: Like, the big thing everyone is tracking nowadays just because of the impact it has on a day to day basis. ETF flows.
00:01:14.524 - 00:01:31.064, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, do we, do we, do we care that GBTC has like, such large outflows every day, or is it kind of just like, rip the band aid off? Maybe it's just a bankruptcy getting through it? Yeah, like, I don't know, did, like, do people care about this anymore?
00:01:31.444 - 00:01:39.716, Speaker B: I think so. It's, it's more, I think it's more not on a, on a day to day basis, but is this a precursor for a prolonged trend?
00:01:39.860 - 00:01:40.164, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:40.204 - 00:02:20.774, Speaker B: And so if you think about the size of the outflows on a daily basis, not that big of a deal, but if you think they're going to persist for weeks, then that's where it gets worrisome. And yes, you're looking at stale data every time it comes out, but a few hours stale, but it's more about what is the trend. So I do think people care about it, but it's still a bullish element where you can rip off the band aid to some extent, get beyond it, and then it's just pure inflows. And you're worried less about the permanent outflow from GBTC?
00:02:21.154 - 00:02:57.184, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it would be a lot different if we saw Ibid or Fidelity's ETF seeing outflows now. But GBDC is this finite. All these bankrupt estates are in there. They still have super high fees. A lot of people are super underwater on that trade. And so it's like kind of a one time, not a one time, but like a finite amount of selling that keeps on coming out. I think it'd be a lot more kind of concerning for like, the medium to long term if we saw, you know, bitcoin is at 73k last week and now it's at, you know, 64.
00:02:57.184 - 00:03:52.314, Speaker D: If we saw like I bid and fidelity flows turn negative because, you know, it wasn't kind of the long term like capital allocators we kind of thought were coming into the ETS, but maybe it was like these momentum traders who kind of like aped in at the top and now they're selling. That would be a little bit more discouraging. But since it's GBTC and we kind of know there's still this like overhang for bankruptcies, you know, maybe it's relevant in the short to midterm, but they can only sell one time and yeah, I saw it yesterday. It's like, okay, like 100 more days of, of these outflows and it's over. But obviously, you know, probably bought or like stops a decent amount before that. But it's not like a, I think it's not that bearish like, it's bearish like short term short to midterm. But like any, any sort of long longer term view, it's, it's really not that big of a deal.
00:03:52.934 - 00:04:07.158, Speaker C: Yeah, this had the most, I saw something yesterday since 2009 is CTF with the most outflows and it's been trading for like a month or two. I mean, it just goes to show how dumb the whole, this whole like situation is.
00:04:07.206 - 00:04:55.596, Speaker B: I think part of it is also. So, you know, when you redeem, yes, you know, you're dealing with the 2% fee, which on a, you know, one year time horizon doesn't really move the needle on something that was just a 2% like management fee. So you're eating 2% one and a half. But so if you look like the discount started closing over the summer. Right. So you have, I think part of the calculus is people are sitting on massive gains. And so, you know, I wonder if the flows slow down now and then pick back up over the summer when people are captured kind of long term capital gains on these since a lot of its americans.
00:04:55.596 - 00:05:22.774, Speaker B: And so I think theres some argument where maybe flows slow down and then pick back up once people have passed the one year holding period. Because if youre just going to sell and recycle into bitcoin, then at this point youre better off eating another couple of months of 1.5% on an annualized basis fee and waiting to reduce your tax burden by like 20% or something.
00:05:22.894 - 00:05:43.022, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you think that the GBTC selling is way more likely not to like flow back in to their products at this point because, yeah, you just do the math on like how long the fee would have to eat into like making it worth it to convert today. When those people sell, they're probably just buying something else with it.
00:05:43.158 - 00:06:14.602, Speaker D: Yeah, and there's also still like the, some like bankrupt entities and some people who just kind of got blown out on that trade that they're still unwinding. But yeah, it's a medium to short term thing. So I don't think it's something to be worried about too much. Like the ibit infidelity flows have still been positive. They slowed down a little. But it is definitely interesting to see. We had in the first two weeks of march, really strong flows every single day, like 500 million net flows every day.
00:06:14.602 - 00:06:46.110, Speaker D: And people got really excited. There's a lot of leverage build up behind that. So this, I think is like a good test to see. Well, ibit infidelity flows continue even with this 15% pullback. And if they do, I think that's a pretty positive sign for who's allocating. I guess the risk was some people kind of speculated that some of these flows were from more like speculative entities. They're kind of momentum traders.
00:06:46.110 - 00:07:04.550, Speaker D: And so like if we see, you know, bitcoin pull back 20% or something, are they going to start to exit? And then that's where we could maybe get in the shorter term, like a deeper drawdown. But so far we haven't had any outflows from, from the big ETF's like ibit infidelity. So yeah, it's more of a. Just a short term thing.
00:07:04.662 - 00:07:59.994, Speaker B: Yeah. One point that I heard Alex Krueger make was that just based on people he was talking to in the tradfi world and like working with Ras and all of that is it takes a while to get the marketing machine going at full capacity. And he said something based on the people hes talked to, its at 25% now and realistically it doesnt really crank up until closer to max capacity until end of year. You have that as definitely a bullish tailwind. The other interesting tidbit would be to understand how much of the GBTC flows goes right back into. Right. And like if you look anecdotally, there doesn't really seem to be a big relationship between outflows and inflows.
00:07:59.994 - 00:08:19.018, Speaker B: Right. Like on big days of outflows you have an offsetting inflow and vice versa. So yeah, it's hard to kind of tell. And maybe it would operate on the lag. Right. It takes a day to redeem and then however long it takes to settle and then you recycle. So it wouldn't necessarily even be seen on a daily netting basis.
00:08:19.106 - 00:08:51.224, Speaker A: And curious, who do we think is buying these bitcoins? And I guess how diamond handed are they compared to existing participants? Because I've seen a few people speculate that all the bitcoins are going to get locked into CTF. It's going to be different because of that. Like let you need less capital to pump the price. To me, that seems like the opposite of what I would think. Intuitively. I would think these people coming in would be kind of more paper handed, if anything.
00:08:51.264 - 00:08:55.312, Speaker C: But they're not. But they're not locked in the ETF.
00:08:55.488 - 00:08:56.864, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Yeah.
00:08:56.944 - 00:09:19.000, Speaker C: You can just tell. So I think people who put it in retirement accounts, especially when you start working it into those target date funds and everything that is not getting sold. Okay. That's just. I mean, it gets rebalanced as someone gets older, but that stuff is not really going to, going to move too much.
00:09:19.152 - 00:09:47.214, Speaker B: I think it's definitely more dime in hand than your average crypto investor. I think the longer people, there's this, like, probably Ebbs and flows where people get into crypto at first, and then, you know, they're just buying and holding. Then they spend a little more time in there, they get confident, think they can start trading, they blow up, and then they go back to holding. And so I think your average crypto holder is turning over their portfolio or their bitcoin more than the average ETF buyer.
00:09:47.634 - 00:10:24.322, Speaker A: But you think that the people who are here now are like before the ETF are the most high conviction, right? Like, if you wait until the ETF to get any exposure to bitcoin, that's just like. Yeah, it's a pretty specific demographic. I don't know how. You know what I mean? It feels like the highest conviction would be the people who are here already and the people who are buying in later are like the people who wouldn't even touch this stuff until it had an ETF, until it was wrapped in an ETF. So it just seems like intuitively those people would be also, like, more paper handed when bad headlines come out or the price just dumps a bunch or whatever it might be.
00:10:24.458 - 00:10:33.582, Speaker D: But I think it's just like an access thing, right? It's like a lot of the people don't care enough to have bought it before, but now it's easy to do. They're buying it now.
00:10:33.778 - 00:11:07.500, Speaker C: Yeah. The other thing too just to add on that, people always talk about how like bomb and pop investors panic and are the one like selling in bear markets and everything. But if you actually look at the last bear market, retail was actually not panicking and selling. They were actually just continuing to buy news. The institutions that were selling everything down and actually for the most part were the ones late to like realize the bull market was back. And so if you look at the BTC ETF's, you look at the average trade size, it's pretty clearly that most of this is retail activity. What?
00:11:07.612 - 00:11:40.992, Speaker D: I don't know. I think that, I think Jim Blanco, I think that's his name, put out a post on that, like thinking that it might be speculative flows, but I don't know how the relationship would work between like the ETF's all arbing against each other and then also the ETF's like arbitrary against like finance. I feel like that data point might be misleading. Basically. Like he put in an article. Yeah. The average trade size for like ibit was like 17,000 and then like QQQ was like 150,000 and GLD was like 60,000.
00:11:40.992 - 00:11:41.728, Speaker D: So it's like.
00:11:41.816 - 00:11:45.784, Speaker C: So you're saying because there's like way more venues to our bit. Yeah, that makes sense.
00:11:45.824 - 00:12:34.004, Speaker D: That's what I would initially think. Like, I think his, like, the data points he pointed to were like, number of trades and average trade size. And I'm like, I feel like that could be pretty easily explained by it being armed through all these different venues, which. And then he said, like, the gut feeling about like the, like investment advisors he spoke and do, haven't begun to allocate yet, but I think those are pretty, like, one that's anecdotal and then the other two, I think could probably be explained by ARv. So I think that's probably, you know, we won't know until like next week if bitcoin keeps going down. And then we start to see like Ibit and BTC outflows, then like, yeah, maybe that argument has some more merit, but I think it's a pretty big leap or pretty big stretch to kind of assume, assume that just given how many places and globally traded it is.
00:12:34.864 - 00:12:44.376, Speaker C: Yeah. Want to talk about the ETF and how the ETH max is all hate the Bloomberg guys now because they don't like what they're saying.
00:12:44.480 - 00:12:59.504, Speaker D: Wait, and one more thing on, because I feel like that ETF conversation we had to kind of had a negative tone. But I'm, I think we're all just super bullish on this longer term. And it's just working through these bankruptcies. And we're a bit more sensitive because we're watching it every day.
00:13:03.044 - 00:13:25.324, Speaker B: Yeah, these guys aren't panicking, right? Yeah, exactly. Very few of these ETF buyers are as glued in on day to day moves and as sensitive to them. I mean, there's certainly some are, but I just. Because it's a passive flow that happens every two weeks or someone's actively rebalancing out of their 401k. Yeah, no, I'm right there with you.
00:13:25.484 - 00:13:28.140, Speaker D: Yeah, excited.
00:13:28.252 - 00:14:05.630, Speaker A: None of the people I spoke to in trap by including some people that have RA software and stuff, expected this kind of price action this quickly after the ETF launch. Honestly, like, most people who spoke to them, like, they speak to a lot of advisors. Like, they didn't, a lot of them didn't even know what bitcoin was yet. You know, like, they would, they wouldn't put their customers in bitcoin or whatever. Like, and they said it would probably take, like, it was more of a year's thing in terms of the education and getting, you know, getting the Larry Fink marketing machine going and all that. So I think we're pretty bullish how ahead of schedule we are.
00:14:05.782 - 00:14:09.430, Speaker D: So you're telling me the investors are sidelined in fiat.
00:14:09.542 - 00:14:15.880, Speaker A: We will pump violently from the bottom. So next thing. Yeah. You want to talk about the ETF and like.
00:14:15.912 - 00:14:38.508, Speaker C: Well, I mean, I don't know how much. Well, yes, a couple. So I don't know how much we need really to spend on it. Just interesting data points is like Ethi. The Grayscale trust discount is back to like 20% discount that got bit up to single digits, like 7% discount or so. And now people are just dumping that, which kind of just shows a lot of pessimist. Pessimism.
00:14:38.508 - 00:15:01.700, Speaker C: Pessimist. I can't say this word. Pessimism around the ETF getting approved. The Bloomberg guys say this is like, way different than, uh, way different than, uh, last. Like, what would happen with bitcoin? And then. Yeah, this headline, we were recording our office hours. Um, check it out if you're a Delphi member on the portal.
00:15:01.700 - 00:15:17.340, Speaker C: Uh, but we were recording that yesterday, and that headline came out as we were recording that. And, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to make of this. Like, is this. It kind of feels like this is just a tactic to not have the ETF approved and kind of like Gensler's last baker.
00:15:17.372 - 00:15:17.732, Speaker D: Ah.
00:15:17.828 - 00:15:30.384, Speaker C: It's never actually going to like go to court or anything, but like, I don't get it. If ripple, if XRP isn't a security house, that's what I don't get. XRP. Listen, if you can't make XRP a security, I don't know what is a security like?
00:15:31.104 - 00:15:49.392, Speaker B: Yeah, losing a court seems inevitable for them. So I just, yeah, it's, it would be an odd fight, battle to take just to take another l because an l seems inevitable. Right. Like Coinbase is going to get involved and now they, they've always had a big war chest, but it's obviously even bigger now and.
00:15:49.448 - 00:15:52.804, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I mean, we should hear about that Coinbase case soon too.
00:15:54.984 - 00:16:32.916, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just so bizarre. This guy like comes in, in the bull market and like just goes after legit projects, loses most important cases and like misses all the actual fraud that was going on with like three arrows and FTX and like all the stuff that was actually fraudulent that he could have. He was like buddying up with, with SPF and then just keeps like keeps the bitcoin from getting, from getting fucking done for years and then it does get done. Bitcoin pumps to new all time high and he's like on, on tv trying to say this is, yeah, it's just like, it's just crazy.
00:16:33.060 - 00:16:39.212, Speaker B: It's sad because launched this $100 million eat fund that got tomato cash immediately.
00:16:39.388 - 00:17:02.180, Speaker C: If you, if you watch his old videos, like Gary Gensler's a g. Like he actually understands, like, like he gets it. He under, he's talking about when you would launch a token to Bootstrap. He talks about how he literally says he, heath is not a security. Right. Like doing a lecture. He, and like he talks about how you, you want to get a token to bootstrap.
00:17:02.180 - 00:17:10.804, Speaker C: And so he, he got this all and he was in. And I just think, yeah, it's just kind of sad to see how people change when like politics.
00:17:10.964 - 00:17:14.108, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just political wrecked on Algo.
00:17:14.196 - 00:17:16.116, Speaker A: And just, and just decided to nuke it all.
00:17:16.140 - 00:17:28.679, Speaker B: I mean, it pumped at some point, but he was, he was saying that that was from like 2018 when, when bootstrapping stuff like that's pretty early to start using that term. Right, for the role of a token.
00:17:28.791 - 00:17:30.643, Speaker C: Yeah, he was probably in sushi.
00:17:32.023 - 00:17:59.896, Speaker D: I think it would be really what would be interesting to come out of all this stuff. So have you guys seen the tweets about like the Ethereum foundation that like they took down their canary or something and maybe they got subpoenaed, but it would be interesting to see like how much of the eats, supplies owned by like these early people if they just like bought it in a bunch of different wallets and like actually, like how centralized it could end up being. That would be kind of interesting to see.
00:18:00.080 - 00:18:00.992, Speaker B: Worse than ripple.
00:18:01.088 - 00:18:17.532, Speaker D: Yeah, no, no, for sure not. But it would just be really cool to see like from, yeah, just like an out of curiosity standpoint, like how, how much of the early ETH people like, participating the ICO, how much do they own that sort of thing just like across different wallets because I know.
00:18:17.548 - 00:18:19.148, Speaker B: That'S always supposed to be released.
00:18:19.276 - 00:18:30.436, Speaker D: I don't know if that'll be released, but I could see it some of that coming out in the, in the securities, like if they're actually going to go after it as a security, which would be interesting, but we'll see.
00:18:30.620 - 00:18:36.864, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think he just wants jurisdiction to assert jurisdiction over, over everything.
00:18:37.164 - 00:18:37.636, Speaker D: Honestly.
00:18:37.660 - 00:19:23.596, Speaker A: Like even his latest videos, you know, he does, he does these like cute office hours videos with his, with his fireplace in the back. I don't know who definitely, I'm more of a face for radio, but he does these videos and he's talking about like corporate governance and this thing's a matter of state law. But like, let me tell you why, actually the SEC should be, should be in charge of this, right? And it's like pretty much with everything, like AI, like he just wants the SEC to have to have mandate over everything. And then he's just always also giving his opinion on bitcoin, right? Like in a really inappropriate way. Like even at the end of the ETF approval, he has that paragraph there. Like, by the way, this is used for crime and like highly risky and stuff. Like, bro, no one is coming to you for investment advice.
00:19:23.596 - 00:19:32.454, Speaker A: Like, and anyone who did has just gotten wrecked. Like, you know, this thing pumps every time. You're not like, yeah, I don't know. Just a really annoying character.
00:19:34.394 - 00:19:36.534, Speaker B: He wants to be a main character for sure.
00:19:37.114 - 00:19:45.242, Speaker D: It's probably pretty political. Like, I don't know, like senator saying, you go back, watch his old videos. He understands it. I feel like it's probably like very.
00:19:45.298 - 00:20:03.916, Speaker B: Political at this point. But I think for him it's, it's just like, you know, he's, he's been thinking about his next step for a while and so it's kind of cozying up to those in power now with the goal of leveraging that to move higher up the government totem pole he's.
00:20:03.940 - 00:20:11.864, Speaker A: Put committed for sure at this point. I wonder at what point Larry Fink just calls him though, like, yo, cool it now. Settle down, sir.
00:20:12.324 - 00:21:02.104, Speaker B: It would be probably, I mean, yeah. So then we brought this up on last week's convo, but would it be, it'd almost be more long term bullish to get the ETF rejected now just because it is an inevitability. And so push that catalyst out, let BTC continue to capture mind share and flows and then launch the ETTF. You get to point at how much has already gone into BTC and all of that. I do think comparing the two situations, if you launch one in May versus end of year or early next year, if you're thinking about where we are a year from now, I think, you know, everything is higher if we launch it later.
00:21:02.224 - 00:21:36.186, Speaker C: Yeah. So I agree with this 100%. Like, I don't even think it's a question that later is better. Like, to your point, there's still a lot of like, Raas and like, institutional investors that, to Jose's point earlier are like, not in yet. Right. And they haven't gone through the whole marketing thing and everything. You got to give that, like, you got to give the BTCETF like a year to just have these people focus on one asset and not kind of make it confusing, not add too much to the mix and just let that build up.
00:21:36.186 - 00:21:59.550, Speaker C: And then, you know, you get Trump elected at the end of the year and then you get the ETTF a few months after that just feels like the best possible scenario. There's a risk. I feel like there's a risk that if it goes through in May, it actually ends up being kind of bearish because it's too much too soon and the market just kind of gets ahead of itself.
00:21:59.702 - 00:22:15.544, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I'd agree with that. We have a couple of other topics on the ducat of all of those, the one I find most interesting is Athena and maker endgame and stuff like that. What do you guys think? Do you want to talk about 4.84 base or any of the other stuff first?
00:22:15.664 - 00:22:44.824, Speaker C: I mean, we can do, there's not a ton talk about 444 basically kind of went as expected. DA got cheaper. But you're not solving any execution scaling issues. So, you know, it changes the dynamic of like, ETH revenue. Right. If you look at the other day for base, Coinbase made 1.4 million, optimism made like three hundred k, and Ethereum made like two k.
00:22:44.824 - 00:23:47.042, Speaker C: So basically all this value, now all this value is going to Coinbase. Right now the DA is basically free. And I think this is just something that the industry, I mean, DA has gone through, like, innovative destruction or whatever. Nobody's paying, nobody's paying for DA anymore, not in like a meaningful manner. And so if you're just thinking about like, pure fundamentals of actual revenue, it's just, it's just execution, right? It's just hotspots, like, economic activity that people are willing to pay a premium for. And so if all of that is shifted to, like, l two s and other layer ones, and that's all captured by, like, those l two s and those layer ones, right? And this is why there has been a pretty big renewed focus on base roll ups recently, which is essentially using ethereum validators to do the sequencing for l two s. So now all this, like, mev, all this execution revenue can kind of flow back to the l one.
00:23:47.042 - 00:24:29.578, Speaker C: And so I think that this new, everyone talks about, like, ETH alignment and everything. I think base roll ups are going to be like the new alignment. And there's a couple, there's like Tyco and there's another one that are launching based roll ups. And this is also like the bull case for Tia, like, because, because Tia to me is like the most overvalued token based on what it is today. And same with, like, dim dimension, like, just to speak honestly. But, like, if you can envision that Celestia now starts to offer other products, right? They start. And they start doing like, this base sequencing where you're using celestia validators for the sequencing that changes the dynamic, right.
00:24:29.578 - 00:25:09.560, Speaker C: Because now all, like, the mev on these roll ups can flow back to Celestia. Right. So I think that if you're like, it's hard to tell who is buying Celestia for what. Like, if, if you, if, if people are buying it because they think that all these roll ups are going to post da to Celestia and that's the only thesis that then, yeah, that's super overvalued to me, even with all like, the bridging and security benefits and everything. But if you do think that they're going to start offering all these other services and that's kind of part of the bull case, then I can, then I can buy it some more because just like, da on its own is not. Yeah, it's like, not enough to move the needle.
00:25:09.712 - 00:25:17.776, Speaker D: How much did Celestia make? Like, if they had, you know, all the current roll ups on the posting, isn't it something like Silicon street?
00:25:17.880 - 00:25:23.494, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, but we got, like, they can, they can increase, you know, like there's things.
00:25:23.834 - 00:25:37.618, Speaker C: You know, Solana made a third of ETH, like, revenue the other day, right? Obviously, it was a extremely, highly, like, big demand period. But I wouldn't be surprised if Solana's fees are above ethereum for some days in the next couple of months. Like, straight up.
00:25:37.746 - 00:25:47.986, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely possible. Sisyphus, like, tweeted something like, if you had, like, 50,000 roll ups posting da da celestia, it'd be making like $10 million.
00:25:48.090 - 00:26:25.786, Speaker C: So. So here's, here's the nuance. Kay? If you use the full capacity as it's at today, yeah, it's like 510 million a year. But the point of Celestia is that you keep making the blocks bigger, right? You keep increasing, like, validated, required, validated requirements, because you have this economies of scale with, like, the data availability sampling with all the different rollups built on it that you're able to, like, increase hardware requirements and you're able to increase it, like, intelligently. Okay. So it's not totally fair to look at it, like, just in what they're at now, right? Because this capacity will increase more and more over time. But I.
00:26:25.786 - 00:26:44.044, Speaker C: But still, like, yeah, I don't think you can, like, why do you think this whole, like, tia is money? Me? Everybody wants their thing to be money, and that's just such a fragile narrative to me. Like, everything can't be money. Like, I understand everything is money to an extent. But if you're like, just look at Adam. I don't know, man. Just look at Adam like nothing else.
00:26:44.124 - 00:26:47.444, Speaker D: Is it goodbye with it at 15 or 13 or something?
00:26:47.604 - 00:26:55.692, Speaker C: I mean, listen, I think when I say overvalued t two, I'm also talking about legit projects that I'm kind of, like, talking about. Right? I think Celestia is, like, one of them.
00:26:55.708 - 00:27:29.868, Speaker A: I think there are a bunch of projects like that, if you apply the same logic to, like, a cash flows lens, are going to look really overvalued. Solano was probably not the best example. Say, I guess would be a good example. A bunch of the all l one s, honestly, would be a good example, if you like. You're always projecting out a lot of future growth, and I think in Celestia's case, I'm not commenting on the current valuation, but projecting future growth is warranted. I think there's going to be definitely thousands of roll ups at endgame. Definitely even more than that.
00:27:29.868 - 00:27:59.994, Speaker A: And we're seeing that already with the amount of people launching all three s, including the founder of Drip l three's are not real. Including the founder of Drip on Solana saying that we're going to need l two s on Solana, some kind of dedicated block space and stuff like that, which was big narrative violation. Got a lot of hate from, from the Solana community. But that's, like, one of the builder of one of the most. Well, definitely one of the, one of the most used apps, I'd say, on Solana saying that. So I don't know.
00:28:00.034 - 00:28:10.158, Speaker C: Yeah. But so a couple things. First of all, absolutely, Solana will have roll ups. And so, I mean, you can say it's a narrative violation. Sure. It doesn't matter. Like, they will have them.
00:28:10.158 - 00:28:38.760, Speaker C: And then, second of all, to. Yeah, the drip founders a lot of his issues today. Actually, Solana has a lot of issues going on with, like, networking components and everything. Quick is. My understanding is quick is just a disaster. So it's not even, like, fee markets even totally conceded on this the other day that it has nothing to do with the chain economics right now. It's like, all the networking components are kind of just not optimal.
00:28:38.760 - 00:29:05.224, Speaker C: And so, yeah, just going back to less you, though. So I said, I said to you was, like, most overvalued. Okay. I'm saying that if you're just talking about it on DA, because I do actually believe kind of, this narrative that they are will, like, offer a ton more services. Like, they'll verticalize, they'll do all this stuff, and, and it is the most, like, elegant Da layer that we have. So.
00:29:07.004 - 00:29:18.164, Speaker D: Okay, let's talk about some memes or something. That was a long monologue for those who don't. Okay, so we talked about this last.
00:29:18.204 - 00:29:20.876, Speaker A: Week just before the memes.
00:29:20.980 - 00:29:21.500, Speaker B: It is.
00:29:21.572 - 00:30:03.208, Speaker A: I do think the drip thing is more meaningful is because if you can see that Solana will have l two s, then a lot of its design choices start to make less sense. You actually, each design choices don't fully make sense either, because it wasn't built for an l two world. But in an l two world, you do want the most decentralized and censorship resistant base layer, because you're offloading all execution to the L2s. And so if the line ends up looking the same as ETH, where, you know, l one has obviously, like, orders of magnitude more capacity, but it's still congested, and activity eventually has to move cell two s, then why not eat?
00:30:03.336 - 00:30:05.560, Speaker C: Well, I mean, so, like, you should. We should remember.
00:30:05.592 - 00:30:06.760, Speaker A: I'm playing devil's advocate here.
00:30:06.832 - 00:30:11.064, Speaker C: Yeah. So we should remember what drip is. Drip.
00:30:11.104 - 00:30:14.104, Speaker D: I don't even know what drip is? I think guys are talking about drip for a second.
00:30:14.184 - 00:30:36.334, Speaker C: Okay, so drip, drip, drip actually makes sense as. So I don't. I don't believe. Okay, so I. Drip is, like, someplace for artists to issue nfts, and they use compressed nfts on Solana, and they do a ton. Like, they're, they're pumping out a ton. They have the most, you know, as best as you can measure, actual users, they have a lot of activity.
00:30:36.334 - 00:31:16.598, Speaker C: Okay, but so when you talk about, like, the future, people talk about this, know, millions of roll ups thing. Some people talk about a single, you know, world computer, whatever. I do think for, like, the financial value, 80% of it is going to be on, like, three to five chains. And, like, drip doesn't really fit in that category of, like, financial value in that aspect. So it does make sense for drip to probably be. I mean, you know, it'll be tough for drip if they do actually move to another chain because, like, right now works seamlessly with, like, the saga phone. A lot of people use it on that.
00:31:16.598 - 00:31:38.490, Speaker C: People have it with, like, you know, like, all the salon and native guys just have it open all the time. So it will. If they do move to an l two, like, I mean, I don't know, we'll see if they lose users or something. I think it'll be a more challenging, like, migration to make. But. But, yeah, like, that's. That's like the kind of app.
00:31:38.490 - 00:31:39.482, Speaker C: So if you talk about.
00:31:39.578 - 00:31:39.810, Speaker B: Sure.
00:31:39.842 - 00:32:07.500, Speaker C: I can see a world. World where there's, like a million roll ups and you have a lot of these niche apps that make sense to be a roll up. I mean, drip is doing, like, like, I don't know, they're just doing a lot of. They're just putting a lot of on chain. And so, I mean, there's other l two s for Solana coming, too, right? Grass is doing an l two. They announced last week. I mean, code is already an l two in a sense.
00:32:07.500 - 00:32:19.184, Speaker C: And there, I think there was something. There's like a. There's a perp Dex that. I think it was Zeta that mentioned it. And so, yeah, like, you are going to see Solana. L two s.
00:32:21.004 - 00:32:24.068, Speaker A: Yeah. I assume you want to move on. Duncan.
00:32:24.196 - 00:32:26.516, Speaker C: Duncan just does not care about this at all.
00:32:26.540 - 00:32:44.582, Speaker D: Thinking about this so deeply and, like, very methodical with the words he uses. This is why there's a good contrast on the show center. This is very, very deep into the research side. But it's interesting. It's interesting to listen to, but sometimes I get slightly bored. I want centrist to make more of a point.
00:32:44.718 - 00:32:47.554, Speaker A: Yeah, tell me what to buy, sir.
00:32:47.894 - 00:33:05.980, Speaker C: The point. The point is that, like, sure, roll ups on salon is a narrative violation, but that doesn't, that's not, like, a bad thing for Seoul is, like, my take. It's like, it's just, that's the new reality. And so you can. You can talk about how they were wrong about this, but it doesn't matter now.
00:33:06.092 - 00:33:06.644, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:33:06.764 - 00:33:07.452, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:07.628 - 00:33:10.644, Speaker D: Like, it's still going to be net beneficial for Seoul.
00:33:10.764 - 00:33:13.060, Speaker C: Sure. If they're launched on Solana. Yeah, why wouldn't.
00:33:13.092 - 00:33:21.292, Speaker D: Yeah, there you go. So by. Solana has been saying that since $8. Genius. But, yeah.
00:33:21.348 - 00:33:49.860, Speaker A: I don't know. I guess my, I don't want to belabor this is whoever belabored it, and Duncan might fall asleep. But I guess the point is, like, if everything converges to a roll up architecture, maybe lends credence to some of the l one designs we've seen recently that are literally just optimized for roll ups. Right. Or some of the things Vitalik said about how he would have designed Ethereum had he known about zero knowledge proofs at the time. Cause then there is no, there is really no monolith.
00:33:50.002 - 00:33:50.472, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:50.568 - 00:33:57.864, Speaker A: In the. In that sense, there's. There's, like, maybe chains that are more monolithic than others, that have more capacity than others, but there really isn't, like. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:57.904 - 00:34:00.352, Speaker C: So I don't even know if, like.
00:34:00.528 - 00:34:01.764, Speaker A: Let'S keep it brief.
00:34:02.224 - 00:34:04.884, Speaker D: Have you guys heard of the center chain?
00:34:06.104 - 00:34:10.640, Speaker A: All right, let's get main net in.
00:34:10.672 - 00:34:14.936, Speaker D: Like, I think based on the last announcement, like, in, like, three weeks behind three or four weeks.
00:34:14.960 - 00:34:35.881, Speaker C: Okay, I just want to say one thing. On roll ups, there is no need, you, roll ups don't need to, like, um, concede this, like, liquidity fragmentation thing. Like, you can actually build scalable roll ups. And you'll see these designs way more. And those are the roll ups I'm, like, most interested in moving forward because I just, I just think for sir.
00:34:36.057 - 00:34:38.573, Speaker A: Or project names of these.
00:34:38.953 - 00:34:41.625, Speaker C: None of these things are, like, none of these things are, like, launched yet.
00:34:41.689 - 00:34:43.533, Speaker A: So, like, fuel and stuff.
00:34:44.174 - 00:34:58.638, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, fuel could be one. I know eclipse is doing stuff. I think mega ETH is another one. Yeah, Mega. Ethan, you could also take, like, some of these paralyzed evms. Like, maybe you can take those clients and do some.
00:34:58.638 - 00:35:06.874, Speaker C: Some stuff. So. Yeah, that's what I'm kind of, like, interested in. Somebody will build, like, a scalable, a very scalable.
00:35:10.434 - 00:35:15.546, Speaker A: Nice. We want to. You want to talk about memes or Athena. Duncan wants to talk about memes.
00:35:15.570 - 00:35:18.534, Speaker D: It seems like Josie wants to show his bag.
00:35:19.034 - 00:35:22.202, Speaker A: I want to show my bags. Yeah, it's my turn for once.
00:35:22.378 - 00:35:30.202, Speaker D: Well, I just wanted to touch on the meme stuff. We were talking about it last week, and I think there's been some interesting develops, but I don't care if we go Athena first in the memes phase.
00:35:30.258 - 00:35:32.058, Speaker A: Go on. Do the memes then.
00:35:32.226 - 00:35:32.618, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:32.666 - 00:35:43.160, Speaker D: So, like, last week, we had Jason on the, the king of dog coins, adelphi. He honestly nailed that trade, like, really early on, was. Was really early to bonking with, but.
00:35:43.272 - 00:36:10.734, Speaker C: Well, can I just cut you off for, like, one quick second? One thing about Jason that I find I, like, very much respect him for is that he was bear king, okay, for, like, two years and was super correct. And as soon as he changed, he, like, knew right away he bought dog coins. And, like, did be able to, like, switch, because most people get into, like, a perma bear kind of mindset, right? And they can't get out of it. So I found that, like, kind of crazy how he was able to switch from that to that so quickly.
00:36:10.854 - 00:36:35.680, Speaker D: Yeah, he did it well, for sure. And. But so him and I have been talking a lot, like, every day. I'm just telling him to get ready to sell his dog coins. I feel like we're kind of reaching a, kind of, like, a pivot point on the meme side of things. Especially, like, over the past two weeks, we saw two new memes launch in Solana. Boom and slurp.
00:36:35.680 - 00:37:55.364, Speaker D: Both hit, like, 24, like, within 24 hours, hit a billion dollar market cap and had exchange listings on binance and bybit. And I touched on this a little bit last cycle, or, sorry, last podcast with Jason, where I was, like, in 2021, you had doge and Shib, which were kind of the only memes that were really, like, turned massive, and they were available on, like, all the exchanges to buy, and they had pretty incredible runs. And now everyone who survived that cycle and is into this cycle, like, Jason, right, like you said, as soon as he stopped being bearish, he just jumped directly into memes because that's what did the best last cycle. But you're starting to get this kind of, like, meme dilution, is what I'm calling it of, like, all these new memes, especially on Spawn, where it's so cheap to create something, like, all these new memes are popping up and where it was doge and shib last cycle, now you have, like, doge, shib, pepe bonk with like slur foam. All of these multi billion dollar memes and they just keep on coming and being popped up. Like there's like probably hundreds of coins a day, maybe thousands of coins a day are launching on Solana, just like. Cause it's very low cost to do so just in the hope of kind of reaching escape velocity and getting a sex listing.
00:37:55.364 - 00:37:58.412, Speaker D: So I feel like we're kind of reaching a.
00:37:58.588 - 00:37:59.484, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead, Jan.
00:37:59.564 - 00:38:48.354, Speaker B: The slurp thing is pretty hilarious though. Like the, the setup there is pretty unique relative to the rest in that. So basically, the backstory is 50% of supply is supposed to go to the LP, 50% to pre sellers. He raised ten mil. That ten mil was supposed to be, you know, paired with half the supply and put into LP and burned. And in the process of burning that LP token, he also burned the 50% that was supposed to go to presellers. So now you have this weird scenario where you have an insane ratio in terms of the liquidity pool size to market cap size, where if you look at any of the other meme coins, obviously as the price goes higher, the ratio goes higher.
00:38:48.354 - 00:39:36.376, Speaker B: But at a valuation of like 370, whatever, 350, it's like three to one in terms of market cap. So there's 375 million in market cap and 125 million in the LP pool. And so it's a pretty interesting setup relative to bowdoin, which is one to 100 almost. And so, yeah, I think you can argue that that element goes both ways, but I think that the bearish argument is much weaker. Bearish argument being that theres so much liquidity that its going to take a lot more to pump the token. But as price goes up, that ratio becomes less and less. And so I dont really see the bearish argument as much for it.
00:39:36.376 - 00:40:16.324, Speaker B: Id obviously the meme dilution component, but it's pretty hilarious to see that. And then plus what that market cap, what that liquidity pool allows you to do is trade crazy volumes on chain, and then all those fees are basically accruing to the pool. So you've had like 5% of supply get added to the pool just via the fees of everyone trading on chain. And so then another counter, the bearish argument would be that once these things get listed on centralized exchanges, they're incredibly liquid anyway. So you're thinking, you're talking about a similar amount of capital to move the price. And so here you just have that on chain.
00:40:18.424 - 00:40:19.760, Speaker A: This is unrelated to the.
00:40:19.832 - 00:40:26.484, Speaker B: You haven't seen before. Yeah, it's more just like specifically it's a setup you haven't seen before because it really literally requires burning of $10 million.
00:40:27.104 - 00:40:40.170, Speaker A: But, yeah, unrelated to the. To the meat of this discussion, but I'm kind of shook. Why have you decided to die on this anti meme hill? Duncan, I wouldn't have expected you of all people to be dying on this.
00:40:40.282 - 00:41:12.464, Speaker D: Okay, I watched him. This is such. Okay, first of all, yeah, I don't like the fact that it can just be spun up and then, like, randomly won. It just, like, makes it as, like, I think it's not a good look. Cause a bunch of people are gonna be left holding a bag, and I think people are getting delusional on them. But more particularly to try and, like, because I watched this or a slow down version of this happen in 2023. So GMX was, like, the number one performing coin in 2023.
00:41:12.464 - 00:41:41.394, Speaker D: GMX and GNs, which is, like, the two big, like, dydX, is just kind of, like, screwed with its unlocks and stuff. But GMX was like, you know, perp Dex that pays, like, fees back to holders. We had FTX happen, so there's, like, a massive narrative around perp dexs. And when FTX happened, GMX is at, like, $25. And then it traded all the way up to, like, $90 in April. Well, bitcoin maybe went up, like, 30, 50%, something like that. And the rest of the alts were just kind of dead.
00:41:41.394 - 00:42:15.444, Speaker D: And what we saw on the VC side and then also just, like, in general, was everyone was just, like, looking at GMX, like, okay, the markets, like, latched onto this because it's actually making money. And, like, everyone went to go build a perp Dex, like, literally everyone. And now we have, like, doidX, GMX, hyper liquid, like Apex from Bybit, Rabbit X. I'm probably missing a bunch. Vertex, I'm missing a bunch. But there's a ton of actually really good perk. Texas, now that I've launched out of that bear market, and I think it's going to be really difficult to outperform on a perfdex token.
00:42:15.444 - 00:43:04.024, Speaker D: And that's, like a perfectex, which actually requires a lot of work and a lot of, like, capital and liquidity behind them to build a product. But you've essentially had this massive dilution among the perp dexs, where I think it's going to be very difficult to outperform the market buying one of these tokens, because it's this weird game theory where whoever hasn't launched a token yet, right now, it's hyper liquid is the main one who hasn't launched a token. You're incentivized to trade there because you're going to get an airdrop and you get points. They take most of the volume and the fees, but then they launch a token. So when new comes out. So that kind of happened at a very accelerated version. And even though Bitcoin's up double, maybe two and a half times from April, GMX is only at $40.
00:43:04.024 - 00:43:57.084, Speaker D: So it's actually down, like 50, 60% from the highs because you had this dilution of all these new perp DAX is coming to market. And what I think we're seeing in memes is, like, a hyper sped up version of that, where instead of actually there being, like, a lot to build with the perp Dex and, like, requiring a lot of capital and liquidity and users and all these, like, you know, difficult engineering problems, you have just these memes where there's, like, hundreds being launched every day, and, you know, you have boem and Slurp reaching a billion. Obviously, Slurp is an interesting case. I'll agree with you on there. And so I just think this, like, cycle is just gonna be, like, hyper accelerated, and eventually, it's gonna be very difficult to outperform on memes. Maybe some will outperform, like, if they're on, you know, Robin Hood and Coinbase, and it's really the one that retail latches onto. But, like, I think Boem and Slurp really messed up everything because they got tier one listings within 24 hours.
00:43:57.124 - 00:44:08.092, Speaker B: Slurp doesn't have listings. Boem was like, a different beast that had financed immediately. Yeah. Has, like, some purpose on bybit, but, like, boem had finance, like, right off the bat, which was.
00:44:08.268 - 00:44:14.584, Speaker C: Yeah. And Boem started this whole pre sale thing, which is definitely the worst part of this whole bull market so far.
00:44:15.184 - 00:44:23.256, Speaker D: Yeah. My whole thing is, like, we're. I feel like we're reaching a tipping point in memes where it's going to be more difficult to outperform because there's all these new ones coming. But I could be wrong.
00:44:23.320 - 00:44:24.472, Speaker C: No, no, I think you're right, and.
00:44:24.488 - 00:44:41.494, Speaker B: I think difficult, but, like, doesn't mean they won't. I think it's just the difference with. With those dexes is you anchor to fundamental value, and so it's a lot. I think the game runs out a lot faster because the ceiling is much more tangible.
00:44:41.664 - 00:44:44.810, Speaker D: Yeah. And this is why, like, yeah. Turn this into.
00:44:44.882 - 00:44:45.562, Speaker B: I think that.
00:44:45.658 - 00:45:03.014, Speaker A: I think that one, like, you see a lot of arguments around meme coins. And, like, both sides, right? People hating on them and saying they're, like, the scourge of the industry, and then other people, like, really over intellectualizing them and making reasons why, like, the next why.
00:45:06.474 - 00:45:09.324, Speaker D: Are so ridiculous.
00:45:09.864 - 00:45:11.272, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of ridiculous.
00:45:11.328 - 00:45:11.964, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:12.264 - 00:45:44.638, Speaker A: And it feels like it really come. It, like, highlights this rift that there is, I think, in crypto between. I feel like some people now, even people who used to be on the other side, there's, like, a fundamental side, which is people who are in this, who believe in that, in the tech, who think this is gonna do something important in the world. Like, we need Defi. We need centralized identity, all these things. And then there's people who are, like, on the financial nihilism part of the thesis, where it's like, this is all just. This is just, like, the best way to express this bet on the debasement of currency.
00:45:44.638 - 00:45:48.374, Speaker A: And so, like, meme coins are just as stupid as anything else.
00:45:48.414 - 00:45:48.566, Speaker D: Right.
00:45:48.590 - 00:46:00.954, Speaker A: It's all memes. It's all just a meme. Anyway. I might as well go to the thing that will. That will perform the best. And then there's obviously people that believe in the tech, but also think memes will make money and do that. But, yeah, for me, I'm.
00:46:00.954 - 00:46:13.274, Speaker A: I guess, very much in the. In the first camp, haven't really done too much in. In meme coins. I can see how they're, like, how they're attractive, but I don't find them super interesting.
00:46:13.314 - 00:46:15.490, Speaker B: Just a high review casino.
00:46:15.682 - 00:46:31.766, Speaker C: Okay. The. The only. The only take you need to have on meme coins is to understand why they exist and people trade them, and that's it. Like, you don't. Yeah, you don't need to, you know, write a story about them or, like, they make sense.
00:46:31.950 - 00:47:03.032, Speaker D: This is a perfect segue into banana. So how to express the meme coin stuff I bought? I, like, talk about banana a bunch. This is also just, like, generally on chain trading, but, like, for example, on the day that flirt came out, banana did, like, 80, like, 70 million in volume or something on Solana and made, like, a million bucks in fees that day. And it's like, you know, you could own something like banana, which is, like, the infrastructure for trading these. These meme coins and all these, like, new on chain projects. And, like, Sanders was saying about how base, like, ethereum only, I guess, and.
00:47:03.048 - 00:47:17.752, Speaker A: Like, not to interrupt your show, but for the people who are in the financial analyst side, it's like, you make less money in the bull and in the bear, there are no cash flows anyway. You know, like, that. That would be the, you know, like, people who want to be on the people who are betting on memes. It's just like, what do you mean?
00:47:17.768 - 00:47:19.280, Speaker B: You make less money in the bull.
00:47:19.392 - 00:47:29.826, Speaker A: Like, banana pumps less than the memes. Right. Even if you're making cash flows, like, no one's valuing stuff on fundamentals, so banana pumps less than the actual memes. And then in the bear, no one's trading anyway. So there's like.
00:47:29.850 - 00:47:35.938, Speaker C: No, yeah, like, if. If bananas fundamentals are driven by memes, then it's all driven by memes.
00:47:36.106 - 00:48:07.850, Speaker D: Yeah, but you also have to take into account, okay, you. You cherry pick your one meme that is going to outperform by a lot. But it's like, do you have, like, the conviction to go and put a lot into this meme? Because, like, what, you know, ends up, you know, driving memes, I feel like, is a lot different than what would end up driving banana. Like, that's why I like it more. It's like, I have a lot more conviction to put a bigger position on banana than I would on these memes, because the memes could disappear. Like, for example, I bought this Biden coin on e that was like, Trump was really pumping. There's a Biden coin on ETH.
00:48:07.850 - 00:48:29.734, Speaker D: It was the highest liquidity. I bought it. Okay, Trump does well, this might do well. And then Joe Bowden on Solana launches and just completely wrecks me and takes all the market share where it's like, okay, that can happen. My thesis was right. There's going to be a buying point that does well, but this isn't right. But I just think they're wrong.
00:48:34.914 - 00:48:38.774, Speaker B: Everyone is talking to me.
00:48:42.034 - 00:48:55.194, Speaker D: But basically, my whole point is, moving forward, I can be way more confident just holding banana and getting exposure to all these new launches and all this dilution and whatever the hell happens, versus having to pick the specific meme, which pumps completely randomly.
00:48:56.734 - 00:48:57.566, Speaker B: Good cope.
00:48:57.670 - 00:49:14.054, Speaker D: Yeah, it is good cope. But also, like, Jan, what would you rather size into? Something like a project like, you know, banana or Dream X, where you can kind of, like, roll bit or something like something with revenues, where you can build some conviction around it, or just, like, a random meme? What would you rather size into? I think that's the real question.
00:49:14.214 - 00:49:26.808, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I hear you on that. The memes are also much more liquid than a lot of these other ones, too, which is it definitely contributes to and, like, the momentum element of them.
00:49:26.936 - 00:49:53.218, Speaker D: But you also are, like, on the computer all the time. Where it's like, okay, if you had to buy one and hold it for six months, what would you rather buy? I'm going to say 99% of people with, like, conviction, if they only had to pick one, would rather buy something that has, like, a little bit more of a moat versus these memes. It's like, okay, this meme could be the flavor of the month or the flavor of the day. Then it could literally be a zero in two weeks. Obviously, if you're managing that actively, like, I know you are young, then it's, you know, much more doable on the meme side.
00:49:53.266 - 00:49:54.682, Speaker A: But that's, I mean, you can, you.
00:49:54.698 - 00:50:04.194, Speaker C: Can take this thesis, and this is like, always been kind of like the thesis for just buying ETH, too. Like, if you think it's all just an on chain casino, you just buy ETH, which is the house.
00:50:04.314 - 00:50:04.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:05.274 - 00:50:09.818, Speaker D: And then you can try and get some beta on it through these different names. The banana.
00:50:09.946 - 00:50:25.112, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think revenues is necessary. Definitely fundamentals. Definitely. There's like, I don't know, I feel like there's the actual future of finance and different industries being built, and, like, a lot of people are going to get stuck holding memes and feel pretty stupid at the end of it, but a lot of people will make a lot of money with them, too.
00:50:25.168 - 00:50:25.944, Speaker D: So it's.
00:50:25.984 - 00:50:33.244, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a casino. It's all you need to know about it. Like Jan said, moving on to my bags. Should we talk about Athena?
00:50:35.544 - 00:50:36.640, Speaker B: All our bags?
00:50:36.752 - 00:50:40.608, Speaker A: All our bags, I guess, yeah, we hyped it with the fund. Yeah.
00:50:40.656 - 00:50:40.936, Speaker C: Do we.
00:50:40.960 - 00:50:53.690, Speaker A: Do we want to? And by the way, yeah, the funding. Delphi Ventures owns Athena. I own a bunch of yt, and I'm. And I'm farming it as well, so. Yeah, definitely some bag bias here. Yeah, I want to bear.
00:50:53.842 - 00:50:54.842, Speaker D: If you guys want to be the.
00:50:54.858 - 00:50:58.314, Speaker A: Bull, I think ceteris can do the bear as well. I think you guys could both do that.
00:50:58.354 - 00:50:59.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think it's hard to.
00:51:00.002 - 00:51:27.446, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think the bear is simple. There's just too many. There's just too many moving parts that dawes, that something goes wrong, just seem pretty high, and that this basis trade has always failed, no matter how smart the people are that have been doing it. I think the, like, what makes it riskier is just the fact that you're tokenizing at this time. And then people are going to, like, deposit this. Um, I'll throw it, like, defi. Use it as collateral.
00:51:27.446 - 00:52:10.600, Speaker C: Every, um, I mean, there's there's a lot of ways that it can go wrong, right? Like you just have a staked ethanol exploit or something, right? Like that side of the trade all goes belly up. You have, like, some NPC, like, problem. There's, like, smart contract risk in a bunch of places. There's just a lot of risk. And so I think fundamentally from, like, a pure natural engineering, pure, like math looking at in a vacuum, it makes sense and it's sustainable. But, yeah, it's hard to just not see something, especially when it gets too big. And Duncan made this point, too, that when it gets really big, when it gets big, it actually pushes yield lower.
00:52:10.600 - 00:52:13.472, Speaker C: So, like, as yield goes lower, it actually becomes riskier, too.
00:52:13.608 - 00:52:15.696, Speaker B: Well, then it naturally unwinds, right?
00:52:15.840 - 00:52:17.896, Speaker A: It naturally unwinds as yields go lower, though.
00:52:17.960 - 00:52:46.828, Speaker D: But I don't know about that because it's, like, perceived as more safe. This is. This is the thing. You have more money in it and yields go well. We should just explain it really quickly for people who don't know what Athena is. So basically, Athena is taking, I think right now it's ETH, but maybe in the future, more collaterals, but basically taking ETH, staking it. So you write right off the bat, get a 4% yield there, and then it's going and it's shorting the ETH perp, which, you know, historically, for most of its life, is positive funding.
00:52:46.828 - 00:53:10.032, Speaker D: So I think right now it's maybe 20% funding. So you're getting 4% on Steve and then 20% on the ETH per. So you're earning like 25% on a. On, like, supposed to be. And for most times, it is just like a delta neutral position. You know, you're long e collateral and short ETH perp. So you should be delta neutral, earning the funding and the staking rate.
00:53:10.032 - 00:53:48.778, Speaker D: I guess where ceteris and I get a bit worried is like, as you scale this product, right, and more money comes in, then you just have kind of this massive short position on ETH. And, you know, obviously there's, like, nuances here, but I feel like, as a. Like, they're just like, more. More risk in this, like, massive short position on ETH, which has collateral to back it up, but kind of like, as yields come down, I think people might perceive it as safer. And just like, more and more money comes in. Like we saw last cycle with Luna, got $18 billion into it at 20% yield. So it can be this, like, massive.
00:53:48.778 - 00:54:03.394, Speaker D: And this is obviously much different than Luna. Like, this is actually collateralized by the ETH in the short position, but it just opens up the avenue for like small things to go wrong. And when it's like magnified so big, like at such a big scale, then like, yeah, you can have some issues.
00:54:03.554 - 00:54:46.940, Speaker B: I don't, I don't think there the economic risks are that significant in the sense that I don't like, you know, each dollar is fully collateralized and you might have scenarios where people want to run for the door and, you know, you can only unwind so much of the supply so quickly. So you might have a scenario where it can, you know, deep to like ninety eight cents. Ninety nine cents. And that's just because someone wants to sell and not wait for a slightly more orderly unwind process. But that's someone else's edge to buy if they're comfortable waiting to unwind in a month. Right. And so I think you have a pretty natural barrier there where it's not backed by something that needs to be minted and burned.
00:54:46.940 - 00:55:36.960, Speaker B: It's backed by an actual fully collateralized position. I do think the bigger risk is the technical acute one, right. Where it's just like all of a sudden somehow a certain chunk of the collateral is lost. That I think, and I'm very bullish on it, I think that's a bigger risk because there is no kind of immediate remedy for something like that if it happens. Whereas the more economic one, I think is okay, even on the funding side, what you notice if you think about what happens before it goes into a negative funding rate environment, you have, all right, so markets, top stuffs blowing up, there's a lot of on chain activity. So you still have the steep side that's providing pretty decent amount of, uh, yield. And, and the funding is starting to kind of gradually make its way down.
00:55:36.960 - 00:56:21.388, Speaker B: And if you look over historic cycles, that's kind of how it's played out. So you have months of, of kind of time to unwind before you get to kind of the depths of the bear where there's no on chain activity. So Steve is paying nothing and funding is flat to negative. So the entire basis trade is kind of way less attractive. But there's historically been months of that transition which should allow for an economic unwind. And plus, if you think about it's generating a surplus and building the treasury on a much larger supply, and then when it's not earning as much, supply is contracting. So on a relative basis, you're actually, we've seen with a lot of these tokens where there's an issue, you're usually buying high and selling low.
00:56:21.388 - 00:56:43.184, Speaker B: Here you actually have a scenario where you're generating and bootstrapping the insurance fund when things are good and then the penalty or the funding shortfall that needs to be potentially addressed is when supply is much lower and times are bad. So the economic stuff is pretty durable. It's more the technical stuff that I agree is concerned.
00:56:43.224 - 00:57:26.418, Speaker A: It's unknown on the economic stuff as well. Funding has to be negative and outstrip the ETH yield. And I think if you look historically that happened on something like 18% of 18% of days, obviously as the thing, it gets bigger, that changes. But even then they have the insurance fund, right? So if it's like an intraday move or like a short term thing, like funding gets wiped because there's a bunch of liquidations, the insurance fund is just going to cover any negative funding for that period of time. So really where you're talking about the unwind is when funding is negative enough for long enough that it completely drains the insurance fund. And then basically you start getting negative funding on principle, which erodes principle. But even then it's like very different.
00:57:26.418 - 00:57:51.074, Speaker A: It's like a very slow unwind, right. At the max funding rate on binance, it's like 100%, right? So it's like something like 0.2 something percent a day that you're losing. And it's like the whole way down. As yields come down, there's like an incentive for, you know, different people will see the risks of this at a different place. And like at 60% you have this much Tvl 30% you'll have less. 10% you'll, you'll, you'll have less.
00:57:51.074 - 00:58:31.132, Speaker A: And so I think it's very likely. And then that's like negative reflexivity, right? Because as the funding rates go negative, then people unwind the position, they close some shorts and then funding like will flip back like positive, hopefully. And I think there's some. Yeah, so I'm not too worried about that. I guess the biggest worry, as you said, is technical, obviously. Like something in NPC that's like sort of an, like a black swan, something on the collateral side, whether it's like a steeth, a steed hack, which I mean, that would hurt a lot of projects, not just them. And they're pretty diversified in their liquid.
00:58:31.132 - 00:58:48.354, Speaker A: Staking derivatives now would be bad. And then also like an exchange hack would be bad, right. You lose the, like the short leg, basically, of however much exposure you have on the short leg is basically how much this thing ends up deep is by that's just to jump in on a risk basis.
00:58:48.514 - 00:59:00.546, Speaker C: I just want to say, because you make like. So the. The first two things you talked about, like staked ETH, NPC. Yeah. Those are like industry wide things that would hit, I mean, tons of projects, tons of people. I mean, fire blocks. I like empty.
00:59:00.546 - 00:59:24.554, Speaker C: I would have kind of like screwed the industry regardless of if you use fire blocks or not. Right. But the. The centralized exchange one, that's like the more idiosyncratic one to an extent. Unless you have something like FTx that's just massive. But I don't think we will. That's probably the one that is the most, like, would hurt Athena, like relatively more than everything else in that sense.
00:59:24.594 - 00:59:30.234, Speaker B: Yeah. But it's also not that big of a problem because they settle either hourly. I think it's like hourly or every 2 hours.
00:59:30.274 - 00:59:30.426, Speaker D: Right.
00:59:30.450 - 01:00:00.090, Speaker B: So it's only an issue if, you know, you have your steethy and markets have nuked and you have a bunch of unrealized gain in your short position that is effectively what's collateralizing the dollar or the USD. And you can't realize that, right. That's like, that's kind of the concern. But if you're realizing it every hour, then, oh shit, they got hacked. We lose our short. We have to unwind the steep ASAP. And yes, you will lose some, I'm sure, unless Steve pumps.
01:00:00.090 - 01:00:09.676, Speaker B: But like, obviously there's a hack Steve's going to nuke. So you lose your hedge while prices go down. So you have that. But. But you don't have this like unrealized gain that you're about to get rugged on.
01:00:09.780 - 01:00:10.332, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
01:00:10.348 - 01:00:22.308, Speaker C: I mean, that's the biggest concern that it gets so big. You have a big market nuke. Um, like crazy. 50% drop day. And does it survive that? Like, I don't know. Mathematically it should.
01:00:22.436 - 01:00:30.590, Speaker A: It's a seven day unstaking though, right? Like, even. Even then it's like, uh. Like to actually unstake your s. USD. For USD, it's seven days, so.
01:00:30.662 - 01:00:37.398, Speaker C: No, but I mean, exchange goes. Goes under. You can't. I'm talking about this realized. Unrealized. Yeah, but it's.
01:00:37.446 - 01:00:38.702, Speaker B: They realize it every hour.
01:00:38.798 - 01:00:43.886, Speaker C: Yeah, but we have like a market crash. It happens in like couple seconds.
01:00:43.950 - 01:01:03.178, Speaker D: Like, I think that there is potential to maybe lose, like, you know, something. 1020 percent of principle. But yeah, it's definitely not like these other stable coins have been attempted where it's like you could lose everything. Like, I think kind of the Max drawdown on this in a really bad case is maybe like 20% on mechanic side.
01:01:03.266 - 01:01:11.258, Speaker B: Yes. But then attack vector is almost like, if you have negative funding, you would need all of the USD holders to collude and not redeem.
01:01:11.346 - 01:01:11.594, Speaker D: Right.
01:01:11.634 - 01:01:17.714, Speaker B: And you force the protocol to absorb, like to take on negative funding and basically pay to keep the shorts open.
01:01:17.754 - 01:01:21.226, Speaker A: So like, yeah, everyone basically.
01:01:21.330 - 01:01:25.346, Speaker B: Yeah. Right. You're holding USD with negative funding, the.
01:01:25.370 - 01:01:51.090, Speaker D: Funding just balancing mechanic. But I think what. Where it could get risky is like if the project gets greedy in a, in a market where their tv all is like, you know, ballooned up a bunch, they've kind of muted funding across the board because it becomes so big. Right. It's only launched for the past like couple months and already has like a billion dollars a TVL or something. Like ETH open interest is only 9 billion. So they're a billion.
01:01:51.090 - 01:02:17.334, Speaker D: They're like 10% of ETH open interest already. So like you could see in like six months from now they get to like a really big part of the market. Funding is like pretty muted and they want to keep growing or they want to like, you know, they just get greedy and they do some like, like restaking thing where like they, you know, add additional yield on. On top of Steve. Like Steve has some decent Lindy already and. But like you could see like a situation where that happened.
01:02:17.414 - 01:02:27.120, Speaker A: They can do that without the exchanges. The exchanges would have to, would have to be okay with that, right? They would have to like honor the short on whatever they're doing with the, with the collateral.
01:02:27.152 - 01:02:28.484, Speaker D: Yeah, they would have to like.
01:02:30.624 - 01:02:41.120, Speaker A: Counterparty risk before. Before. I want to answer center's point on that because I agree to have counterparty risk with the centralized exchanges. But like every stable coin has varying levels of counterparty risk, right?
01:02:41.232 - 01:02:41.456, Speaker B: Sure.
01:02:41.480 - 01:02:44.328, Speaker C: The Fed bailed out the entire industry, so like, I'm not forgetting that.
01:02:44.376 - 01:03:17.244, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, depending. Exactly. So depending how you assess the relative counterparty risks, right? Like, I mean, us banks, you know, us regional banks, whoever the fuck tether is banking with, you know, no one knows, like if they get censored or whatever. Like this is, this is a crypto native stable. I'd say it's between decentralized and centralized, right? It doesn't rely on tradfi banking rails. It's purely relies on centralized exchanges. I think for a lot of people, tether has shown, you know, there's, there's demand for this, for this trade off space.
01:03:17.244 - 01:03:55.326, Speaker A: And like, what I think is when you actually look at the risks and the yield, it is like very compelling for a lot of people on a risk reward basis. You're kind of seeing that with, with the market. And, like, I personally have a lot of my, my stables in it, and so I think it'll, like, continue to grow and have product market fit and then add, like, bitcoin as collateral taps into, like, 25 billion in open interest. And then, you know, Sol after that, which, you know, is definitely lower amounts. But, yeah, I just think, and I think given, like, the degeneracy that we've seen with blast with these e staking, I just think it's going to get integrated, like, everywhere. Like, every perp, Dex, every l two is going to use this in the. In the back.
01:03:55.430 - 01:04:28.994, Speaker C: Yes. So that's, like, part of my hesitation with it, though. Okay. Because if we go back to Duncan's point about how even in a worst case, it's, like, ten to 20% of value to lose, that's fine if. If people are just, like, depositing in this trade and it's isolated and those people take a haircut, but a 1020 percent deep peg on a stable when it is integrated in so many places can be quite catastrophic to, like, the entire defi economy. So that's my kind of biggest concern with it. Like, I agree.
01:04:28.994 - 01:04:33.118, Speaker C: I don't think there's this scenario where it has, like, zero backing.
01:04:33.166 - 01:04:33.374, Speaker D: Right.
01:04:33.414 - 01:04:45.634, Speaker C: Like, I'm not. That's stupid. Uh, it's more. So just, like, the knock on effects of a ten one part of it kind of, like, blowing up and causing, like, ten to 20% and then, like, the ripple effects across everywhere.
01:04:45.974 - 01:05:24.674, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think it's a really great idea. Like, and it's going to be successful. And I think all of the risks we're talking about, you'll see coming. And, like, I think it just gets risky when it becomes too big, almost like, that's when it poses the risk to other things, like, when it becomes too big and, like, regarded as, like, you know, as good as, like, USDC, which is, like, backed by treasuries and, like, a special account and, like, bank of New York Mellon type of thing. So, yeah, like, I think it's a really interesting project, and it's, it's very cool, and I like where it's going for the space, but definitely something to keep our eyes on as it grows.
01:05:26.494 - 01:05:28.022, Speaker A: Yeah. Moving on.
01:05:28.118 - 01:05:28.742, Speaker D: All right.
01:05:28.878 - 01:05:54.446, Speaker A: I mean, we should probably rep. All right. I wanted to. I was curious to touch base just quickly because it's a lead on from Athena on just, like, the impact of these higher rates on Defi as a whole that we kind of saw, especially, like, Thor chain. I mean, maker obviously up their rates like kind of three x their revenue Ave's revenues up a lot. Third chain is. Is the most direct one because they have these, like, zero interest revenue but.
01:05:54.470 - 01:06:08.634, Speaker B: Not profit because now borrowing cost for all those guys goes up too. So it's not like, you know, I mean, borrowed costs across the space go up, so the cost of capital goes up. All these businesses are net interest margin businesses. So it's not like, yeah, revenue goes up, but so the costs.
01:06:09.134 - 01:06:48.406, Speaker C: Yeah. So two, two impacts of Athena, it has been one, obviously rates are up everywhere. And then two, it showcased these Oracle as platforms like Ajna, which we just had a report on yesterday, which you should definitely read. And it kind of shows, like, how these Oracle less defi primitives, you're able to bootstrap these new markets a lot quicker because there's no protocol solvency under these, like, architectures. So those are like, the two most interesting things to me is how it caused, like, maker has put the Dai savings rates like 15% now. Right. And Ajna has been seeing, like, they're the number one borrow lend for Athena stable.
01:06:48.406 - 01:06:51.714, Speaker C: So those are, like, been the two biggest takeaways for me.
01:06:52.014 - 01:06:53.078, Speaker B: Yeah, it's tricky for a lot of.
01:06:53.086 - 01:07:02.430, Speaker A: These business models on Ajna because I don't, I don't see why anyone would be lending USD on Ajuna. It just makes no sense. Like, you, you would. You could stake it and earn yield.
01:07:02.462 - 01:07:04.894, Speaker B: You could. Or even DSR, you could just hold.
01:07:04.934 - 01:07:10.382, Speaker A: It in your wallet and earn higher yield. Like, yeah, savings rate.
01:07:10.398 - 01:07:15.368, Speaker B: Like, why would you even do that if you can do Athena, if you're.
01:07:15.416 - 01:07:20.600, Speaker A: Just locking it in Athena, depending where you think shards are, is like 300% APY or something.
01:07:20.752 - 01:07:27.744, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying. Like, why even do, like, like, I agree with your logic on option. I can apply it. You can apply that to maker also, right?
01:07:27.864 - 01:07:30.056, Speaker C: I know, man. Why buy bogan instead of Biden?
01:07:30.120 - 01:07:36.164, Speaker B: Like, well, you're holding a stable coin and getting catching strays.
01:07:36.624 - 01:07:43.992, Speaker C: That's a good point. Like, I don't know. I mean, I think dies, like, less risky. So I know it doesn't make up for me.
01:07:44.008 - 01:07:59.096, Speaker A: I think this is my hot prediction. I think die ends up becoming, like, SUSD rapper rather than a treasury rapper. Like, I think they'll move. They're already moving. Some of their exposure actually didn't catch up on the latest governance proposal.
01:07:59.240 - 01:08:04.112, Speaker D: But how great, how big is die? How big is five?
01:08:04.168 - 01:08:06.098, Speaker C: Like, dies like, five bills, I think.
01:08:06.186 - 01:08:32.609, Speaker D: Yeah, like, I don't think you're gonna be able to fit that much. Like, as Athena grows, like, the yield's gonna come down because there's depressing funding. Like, it's less attractive as the yield grows. And there's also just, like, so much more infrastructure. Like, in 2021, we saw the funding rate at, like 50% to 60% for, like, months. And that was because there was, like, no infrastructure to put on this basis trade. I think there's a lot of infrastructure to put it on now.
01:08:32.609 - 01:08:44.937, Speaker D: And obviously, Athena on its launch week had, like, 80% yield because funding got super hot. But realistically, I think, yeah, you're probably going to settle around, like, long term, like something like ten to 20%.
01:08:45.065 - 01:09:20.286, Speaker B: So part, like, two things on that. Like, the ETH would be super bearish. I mean, super bullish for Athena, right? Because now you just have all this massive demand. I think what actually helps Athena quite a bit is if you can get that stable coin as something that people use, it generates revenue on the existence of all of the stablecoins, but it only has to pay fees to the ones that stake. So if you can get a large amount of them to not stake, then you're actually generating quite a bit more in terms of profit and are able.
01:09:20.310 - 01:09:22.694, Speaker D: To pay as much if you're not staking it.
01:09:22.774 - 01:09:29.134, Speaker B: Well, that's the whole point. If you can get this thing to be widely used to some extent, then it helps with the margin.
01:09:29.254 - 01:09:39.798, Speaker D: With UST, it didn't like, that wasn't possible because everyone who's holding us t is putting an anchor. They're not. Luna made a massive push to get us to integrated places, and it was kind of a flop.
01:09:39.926 - 01:09:48.806, Speaker B: Well, part of the longer term vision is to try and get USD pairs on sexes, right? And then the idea, I just don't.
01:09:48.830 - 01:10:05.935, Speaker D: Like, I even thought about it, but, like, that's where things like that, they just can't get greedy with this. Like, I feel like that's just getting greedy with it. Just keep it as your nice basis trade. It's going to print a lot of money. People are going to do well, but if they try and get greedy with it and make it too big, something's going to go wrong.
01:10:06.039 - 01:10:09.123, Speaker B: You need a beefcake insurance fund right where you can.
01:10:10.783 - 01:10:14.243, Speaker D: Luna had the $2 billion bitcoin hodl.
01:10:14.623 - 01:10:16.887, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's, that's apples to oranges.
01:10:16.975 - 01:10:33.332, Speaker D: I know it's not the same, but it's like, it's, it's the same point. It's just at a different extreme. Like Luna was at one extreme. This is like way be safer for sure. Not at all comparing them as the same but it's like as you try, like you're trying to push it into something it's not. It's like a structured product and you're trying to push it to be like the base pair.
01:10:33.468 - 01:10:37.404, Speaker B: There's going to be a scare for sure. Like it's just inevitable to some degree.
01:10:37.484 - 01:10:39.724, Speaker D: Yeah. All right.
01:10:39.844 - 01:10:42.932, Speaker A: That was a good one. Enjoyed that. Should we wrap it up?
01:10:42.988 - 01:10:43.692, Speaker D: Anyone want to say?
01:10:43.748 - 01:10:51.538, Speaker A: Anyone have any last words? Duncan, you've been, you only showed center chain once. Maybe you want to get another one in before, before the end.
01:10:51.626 - 01:11:00.770, Speaker D: Well, all I want to say is Dedorus bought banana. So finally soon he's going to advice in and then this podcast is going to be a lot better.
01:11:00.922 - 01:11:05.082, Speaker B: It's just there. It's going to be a two person hive mind episode.
01:11:05.218 - 01:11:10.074, Speaker A: All right, guys, good to be back and see you all in two weeks for the next episode of the Hive mind.
