00:00:00.200 - 00:00:35.294, Speaker A: The fallout from the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange. FTX could impact crypto for years to come. From mega mansions to a superworld commercial exchange, hacks and live tweets from the man sitting at the top of the pyramid, a constant stream of revelations brings confusion, speculation and the potential for another bankruptcy. With so much going on, it can be hard to know where to start. So here's 20 key things about the fall of FTX so you can know exactly what happened. Number one, the fraud. FTX owes $9 billion in liabilities, which it cannot meet.
00:00:35.294 - 00:01:03.838, Speaker A: But where did the money go? Let's break it down. 2.3 billion was given as a loan to Paperbird Inc. An entity majority owned by the CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman Fried, otherwise known as SBF. A further 1 billion loan was also given to SBF. Theres also a 300 million cash out from a recent FTX fundraising round and finally 121 million on Bahamas real estate. This leaves $5.3
00:01:03.838 - 00:01:59.124, Speaker A: billion unaccounted for. Two, the spend FTX spent huge amounts on marketing and political donations to promote their brand and spfs long term vision, with 375 million going on sports marketing, including to the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat and games company Riot Games. A further $190 million was sent to the FTX Foundation, a charity arm that promised more than it could deliver. And finally, $62 million was spent on political donations in 2022 alone. Three, the leak the House of Cards was first tested on November 2 when Coindesk released an article stating it had received a copy of Alamedas balance sheet. The leak revealed that nearly 40% of the asset side of FTXs balance sheet was was an FTT or FTT collateral. FTT was FTXs own native exchange token and as it would prove, it was extremely volatile.
00:01:59.124 - 00:02:55.084, Speaker A: Four, the tweet in response, CEO of Binance CZ announces theyll be liquidating all of the FTT they had received from an FTX investment exit over the course of a few months. CZ then, quote, tweeted an alert of $584 million worth of FTT moving to binance and claimed, yes, this is part of it. Five, the response Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda, offered to buy all of the FTT from Binance in an over the counter offer at $22. This made investors wonder why keeping the price above $22 was so important to FTX. After all, there was no risk of insolvency, so they said. Six, the sell off Solana dumped 17% in 12 hours, losing approximately $1.47 billion in market cap as FTT floats above $22.
00:02:55.084 - 00:03:18.822, Speaker A: Presumably this was FTX as one of the largest holders of Solana. Selling their sole holdings would generate liquidity in an attempt to hold the dollar 22 price. Floor. Number seven the collapse. The floor can only hold for so long as FTT loses its dollar 22 floor price. It plummets, dropping approximately 85% in just 17 hours. This wiped $6 billion from its market cap.
00:03:18.822 - 00:04:13.854, Speaker A: Remember when we said it was volatile? Number eight the bank run to compound their issues, FTX experiences $6 billion of net customer withdrawals rushing for the exit in just 72 hours. They try to slow this by first raising withdrawal fees, but eventually they have no choice and decide to pause withdrawals entirely. Nine the hack whilst withdrawals were still closed, an individual manages to withdraw $450 million to Ethereum address zero x 590 x 50 nines on chain activity meets the criteria for a black hat hacker. Despite wild speculation, their identity remains unknown. 200 million is then withdrawn from the exchange by a white hat FTX employee in an attempt to rescue the remaining funds. Ten the dust settles on the 11 November FTX filed the chapter eleven bankruptcy. FTX Group reports a total cash balance of $1.24
00:04:13.854 - 00:05:02.972, Speaker A: billion as of Sunday the 20 November, while SPF and members of the FTX foundation resign, John Ray III, who previously led Enron through bankruptcy proceedings, takes the helm at FTX. Number eleven the contagion, the amount FTX owes Genesis cryptos largest lender, is revealed to be $200 million. With 200 million lost in FTX, Genesis seeks an emergency $1 billion loan for Monday the 14 November, which is not met. The loan is likely to help meet impending withdrawals stemming from the contagion fears. Genesis then also closes withdrawals on Wednesday the 16 November. 12 the repeat offender in June of 2022, Genesis lost $1.2 billion when the hedge fund three arrows capital collapsed.
00:05:02.972 - 00:05:59.618, Speaker A: At that time, digital currency group, Genesis parent company was able to plug the hole, though, as liquidity has steadily receded in the crypto and legacy markets since then, they wouldnt be able to at this time. With Genesis facing another hold from bad debt, digital currency group seeks to raise a $500 million external fundraising loan, which they reduced from $1 billion due to lack of demand. 13 the repercussions Genesis is the largest institutional crypto lender, providing over $130 billion in loans in 2021 alone. Their insolvency would further constrain liquidity and leverage in crypto markets. 14 the fear digital currency group is also the parent company to Greyscale and the Greyscale Trust, who created GBTC, an investment trust backed by bitcoin. The Grayscale Trust currently holds 635,000 bitcoin, which is 3.1% of the circulating supply.
00:05:59.618 - 00:06:28.230, Speaker A: They also hold 3.1 million ethereum, which is 2.6% of the circulating supply. On Friday, the 18 November greyscale announces they wouldnt be providing proof of reserves for security concerns. 15. Reg M DCG has the option to enact Reg M for the Greyscale Trust, which enables trust holders to redeem shares a power they dont currently have. A significant portion of trust shares are owned by DZG.
00:06:28.230 - 00:07:04.704, Speaker A: This would enable them to meet Genesis liabilities by liquidating holdings. 16. The market the implosion contagion fears and potential grayscale trust liquidations were reflected in the markets. In the two weeks that started with the leaked balance sheet, bitcoin dropped 21%, Ethereum 25%, Solana 63% and FTT plummeted a staggering 95%. 17. Centralized exchange flows centralized exchanges have experienced a net $5.5 billion outflow from exchanges over a seven day period on Ethereum, with binance alone having 2.3
00:07:04.704 - 00:07:32.322, Speaker A: billion of net outflow. This clearly reflects the change in sentiment towards centralized exchanges. 18. Decentralized exchange resilience as capital and traders previously using FTX searched for a new home that they could trust and verify. Over the ten days following FTXs collapse, our benchmark decentralized exchange basket went up 33.8% against bitcoin. At the same time, our centralised exchange basket went down 4.59%
00:07:32.322 - 00:08:19.378, Speaker A: versus bitcoin. Defi won Cefi 00:19 the bill in October, just before the collapse of FTX SPF hit the news cycle. When the draft DCCPA bill was leaked, SBF was a supporter and advisor to the bill, which if passed would pose a huge threat to DeFi whilst strengthening CeFi and FTXs position. Despite the collapse of FTX and the disappearance of $10 billion of users funds, lawmakers now want to continue forward with the bill. And finally, at number 20, we have the media. Mainstream media channels have begun to cover the FTX and SPF story, and yet they omit exposing the fraud. Instead, they focus on charitable endeavours and political campaigns.
00:08:19.378 - 00:09:03.534, Speaker A: SPF will no longer be able to finance SBF makes appearances on Good Morning America and New York Times Steelbook summit alongside President Zelenskyy, Mark Zuckerberg, Ben Affleck and the president of the New York Times, Meredith Kopet Levien. So there you have it. These are the 20 things you need to know about the FTX saga, but this is just the beginning of the story.
