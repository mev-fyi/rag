00:00:00.400 - 00:00:01.518, Speaker A: Nothing said on the Hive mind is.
00:00:01.526 - 00:00:08.990, Speaker B: A recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone.
00:00:09.022 - 00:00:10.630, Speaker C: On the show are solely our own.
00:00:10.662 - 00:00:12.794, Speaker B: Opinions, not financial advice.
00:00:24.374 - 00:00:30.862, Speaker D: Welcome, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of the Hive mind. This week, Jose is out again.
00:00:30.958 - 00:00:31.184, Speaker C: So.
00:00:31.214 - 00:00:58.790, Speaker D: So we brought back on Jason. Uh, good timing to have them back on, too, because the market has been a bit wobbly recently. Uh, and so, yeah, as always, I am ceteris. I've got Jan and Duncan here, uh, from ventures, and Jason is on the markets team with me. So, yeah, we're. We've actually had a bit of, like, a rebound recently. We're back to, like, 64k.
00:00:58.790 - 00:01:44.200, Speaker D: But the market sold off a lot last week or so. I think a lot of alts really got hammered, too. Like, a lot more like, bitcoin went down, like, what, 10% or something? And some of these alts went down, like, 50%. There's this tweet yesterday showing how some of these things. There are a couple tweets from, like, Luke Martin and this Ryan. You know, a lot of these alts are, like 30%, 50% move from, like, bear market lows, which is kind of crazy, given, like, the year and the run up we've had. So it's a very different market.
00:01:44.200 - 00:01:59.290, Speaker D: It's not like everything is just going up in unison. There is some pretty significant dispersion going on. So, yeah, I think we want to kind of start with, I guess, like, overall market thoughts there and this, this dispersion effect, I guess.
00:01:59.322 - 00:02:04.474, Speaker C: I have a question for Jason. Is, is dog money still money at this point?
00:02:04.634 - 00:02:34.922, Speaker A: I mean, so, yeah, I mean, that's a. I want your thoughts on the dispersion question, because it's kind of like your meme dilution thesis, but just, like, more broadly with alts and stuff. But just for memes, like, in general, I kind of agreed with you when you were saying most of these memes are like, crap. Yeah, they are. They're like 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th derivatives of bonk and whiff and the first couple early movers. Right. So, yeah, I think most of those are probably torched for the most part.
00:02:34.922 - 00:02:57.234, Speaker A: But I do think if the cycle picks back up in a couple weeks or whatever, depending on how long things take, I do think, like, the structure will probably just do well again. Like, a lot of them have held up a lot better than coins that are, like, fundamentally driven. Right? There's some, like, I was looking at Arbor something the other day.
00:02:57.654 - 00:03:07.166, Speaker C: Yeah, the unlock we definitely need to talk about that on this podcast. Ample times, March 24. $2 billion worth of Arb is unlocking it's double circulating supply.
00:03:07.230 - 00:03:36.772, Speaker A: So, like, Arb is down like six or was down like 65% from its highs. And, like, at, I think, 2024 lows pretty much. So, like, you have coins that are, like, you know, generally, like, seen as, like, fundamentally decent coins or for one reason or another. And then, like, there are more examples. That was just the one off the top of my head where these projects have just gotten slaughtered. And some memes are, you know, they're down 40%, but soul's down like 35%. So it's like, all right, like, I'm down the same as the native token, but I'm up like ten x more.
00:03:36.772 - 00:03:38.704, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like it's worth it.
00:03:39.234 - 00:04:05.762, Speaker D: It's. It's not even just. It's not just unlocks, though. Like, I had this tweet yesterday. If you just look at, like, the one year performance, right? Like, over the last year, Seoul is up like 500, BTC, 100 ETH 50. And then you have stuff like Maddok and Adam. And Maddok and Adam didn't have nears up, like, yeah, close to 200, but it's like, adam 50 and.
00:04:05.762 - 00:04:22.894, Speaker D: And matic both down over 30%. I don't think those coins had any crazy unlocks or anything. It's just people don't want to, like, own those. Right. Because the fundamentals. Like, the fundamentals do, actually. I think what you're seeing, the cycles, the fundamentals are actually starting to matter more.
00:04:22.894 - 00:04:31.386, Speaker D: Yes, but if it's starting to matter for, like, the main. So, like, it's starting to matter for the quote.
00:04:31.570 - 00:04:37.600, Speaker B: Finally, narrative and fundamental, though. Like, I think. I think there needs to be.
00:04:37.632 - 00:04:37.848, Speaker D: Each.
00:04:37.896 - 00:04:53.816, Speaker B: Each project kind of needs its own narrative to do well, and that's why you see the dispersion. And I guess if you want to bucket narrative as a fundamental value, then. Yeah, but some of these ran up not on, like, fundamentals in terms of how you'd normally define them.
00:04:54.000 - 00:05:29.538, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think there's. Let's. We can bucket these into different groups. Like, I guess let's say we can go like, BTC, Ethan Sol, which are, like, you know, also have some unlocks, but let's call those pretty consensus majors. And then you have kind of this long or like this. A lot of infra plays, like l ones, l two s, and within those, there's kind of, like, the older coins, like you're saying adam and stuff, and Polygon which were big in maybe 2021, 2017 cycle and then have kind of lost like the narrative now.
00:05:29.538 - 00:06:27.074, Speaker C: But then there's all these like low float high FTV coins which we've seen like Arb is kind of the first major one to see like really big unlocks. And there, in fact, was not a bid for $2 billion with the arbitrum at a $20 billion valuation. So I think that we're going to start to see a lot more of that stuff where it's like, as these low float high FTV coins, they start to unlock. I feel like the market's kind of showed its hand a bit where it's like, I think there's not like maybe like the bid ask like plus two 3% is like really tight and like market makers trying to like pin them to a high price to, you know, anchor perception and stuff there. But like, there's not a bid when that actually comes, comes to market. So, yeah, I think you kind of have to separate out the projects a bit. Those ones I definitely don't feel great about over the next like few years unless they can like really do something crazy.
00:06:27.074 - 00:06:56.204, Speaker C: I think, like, where you want to probably focus is the majors or projects that are like hot right now in the narrative. So it could be like the meme coins and stuff, or like more fundamentally like sound products that actually makes sense, like their valuation is like more reasonable or like there's a world where they can grow into it versus, like, some of these coins. It's like they'd have to do something pretty miraculous to go into the valuation.
00:06:56.544 - 00:08:03.314, Speaker B: And we've talked about how a lot of these are priced at the margin, especially the alts, and we've really seen what happens when the bid pulls back and you get 30 wipe and no why as well, if not more on a lot of these. Part of that, it's a bit of, you know, a PTSD from a lot of crypto natives from being in previous cycles. And to some extent it is a game of survivor. And so you have a selection bias or survivorship bias, basically, where those that have been kind of first to run for the door are usually the ones that have survived and are the ones that are kind of the larger majority of holders in a lot of these. And so one of the things people really indexed on has been the ETF flows. And so if you look at most ETF's, a lot of them have on most days don't have new inflows. And so I think that's something that's worth keeping in mind when considering the BTC ETF.
00:08:03.314 - 00:09:15.516, Speaker B: And naturally there's going to be a lot of flows at first, and then as that begins to slow down and you kind of get macro fears and so the bid really disappears. But yeah, I think it's just like worth noting that it's not, you're going to have these kind of interest cycle scenarios where the bid pulls back. And so looking at it as a function of ETF flows is tough because there's going to be ebbs and flows and also kind of considering volumes as well. I think ETF volumes have come down considerably, and I think that's more a function of price volatility than anything else. If you look kind of when you've seen the big volume spikes. So I think once you see those flows come back, you'll see the bid on a lot of these alts come back, but then you'll kind of get back to the whole dispersion of not all alts are made equal like they were in previous cycles where there was just a broad bid on everything and, and you'd have these consistent catch up plays where it's like, okay, this has been the one that's the laggard in this sector. We should bid it because there's a catch of play now.
00:09:15.516 - 00:09:19.796, Speaker B: It's kind of winners have stayed winners and laggers have stayed laggers.
00:09:19.900 - 00:09:43.958, Speaker A: So what do you, what are you guys kind of looking forward to assuming? Well, I guess, what do you guys think about the market? Do you think this is the low? Do you think we go lower? What are you guys kind of thinking? And then I guess the next obvious follow up would be like, depending on that. Like, how are you looking to figure out what to buy right now? Like, what are the things you're looking at? Like, what's kind of interesting in that.
00:09:44.086 - 00:09:55.030, Speaker D: I'm not good at, like, calling. I'm like a bad bag holder, so I'm not good at calling, like, where we are in the macro type cycle. But I do think I meant more.
00:09:55.062 - 00:10:01.342, Speaker A: So on this, on this move. Do you think that that was like the low, that like little sweep of 60k into like 59?
00:10:01.398 - 00:10:03.544, Speaker D: No, but I mean, I'm telling you, like, I have no idea.
00:10:03.654 - 00:10:41.640, Speaker C: Okay, well, Jason, we were talking about this yesterday, like, where all of this leverage has been. So I think, like, Oi dropped, like, total Oi dropped from like 75 billion to like 50. It's like pretty, pretty big wipeout. Like a lot of positions closed and, or liquidated. And then, like, and we saw, like, all coins like drop like as a percentage, like 40, 50% and like on their open interest and also some prices at like 30% to 40%. And that's reset funding across the board. So like in terms of leverage, a lot of leverage kind of got cleared out over the weekend on that.
00:10:41.640 - 00:11:20.836, Speaker C: Like on the Middle east, like geopolitics stuff where bitcoin sold off pretty violently and then the alts just like there is no bid and they just fell off a cliff and like liquidated a lot of the leverage. So I think unless stocks like keep going down, like if stocks keep going down, I think we'll probably keep going down. But if they don't, I think it's probably pretty good chance that around 59k was the bottom. Maybe we like take out the lows at 59k because we didn't touch those yet, but around there's probably the bottom just because all the crypto specific leverage really got wiped this weekend.
00:11:20.940 - 00:11:55.060, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of agree with that for the most part. I mean, stocks are off, off their highs like 5%, which for stocks is a decent little pullback. And the index, a lot of stocks are off more than that. Crypto related stocks have been torched. Coinbase is down like $50 in the last couple of days. So yeah, I dont know. Im kind of in the same camp of unless traditional markets roll over and I think there are still kind of some worrying signs every day I look at yields, theyre just higher and higher.
00:11:55.060 - 00:12:59.084, Speaker A: Gold keeps ripping. Um, and like those are like just generally like pretty like, you know, not good signs to have at the same time. But if that happens and you kind of get like a spike in yields and like, you know, the fed kind of gets like scared again. Kind of like what happened in October with like the, the british guild thing, right? Yeah, like the new pm come in and have that budget and then the market just like flipped the shit kind of and nuked bonds and then pretty much all those markets just like went, hey, why are you so out with like us treasuries? You saw it pretty much across the board and then you had all of those programs, you had the fed come in and be like, all right, we're going to fix this. We're going to make sure that these treasury markets are very good and very strong and very liquid. If yields spike up, regardless of what causes them, you'll probably get a similar response which would then lead to risk assets going up again. Because if you look at October, like October 2023 when this happened and just like kind of look at where the spy was at the time.
00:12:59.084 - 00:13:15.016, Speaker A: The spy was at like 4100 when that happened. And then since then, it had like 20 straight weeks of green, which is kind of wild. So, like, yeah, it's kind of like something I'm looking for as like, yeah, potentially.
00:13:15.160 - 00:13:38.350, Speaker C: I think that that's like a really good framework to have just in the macro. Like, the Fed is kind of showed their hand that every single time there's been an issue in the treasury market, they've turned the printers back on. So, like, it started in 2019 with, like, the reverse repo spike. They did, like, not QE. Then in 2020, like, when the treasury market broke during COVID they did QE. They stepped in during the banking crisis and then again during the gilt stuff. So.
00:13:38.350 - 00:14:02.946, Speaker C: And there might be, it might have been one more scenario there. But that's like four clear things. Like, the treasury market stopped working. That's usually a function of, like, you know, liquidity and higher yields and more volatility in bond yields. Then, like, the Fed doesn't mess around and they provide support. So I think that's a good, like, macro backdrop where it's not like, okay, we pulled back 10%. We're worried it's going to go down to, like, forty k.
00:14:02.946 - 00:14:49.394, Speaker C: I think it's more so, like, this is probably it, I think, dependent on stocks. Right? If stocks go down another 510 percent, then yeah, maybe we see like 50k. But if stocks kind of bottom out here, I think we'll probably bounce pretty quickly. But it is crazy how quickly sentiment turned. Like, I think so many people got liquidated on, like, that alt drop or just got wrecked or we're in, like, meme coins that pulled back 70% sentiment because, like, bitcoin was literally at the same level. Like, albeit this is maybe a couple percent lower, like, two or three weeks ago and all, it didn't really get hit that hard. But this was, and, like, people are like, oh, like, kind of worried, but this was, like, really bad in terms of sentiment.
00:14:49.394 - 00:14:53.770, Speaker C: So I think there's probably been a lot of flesh out within crypto.
00:14:53.882 - 00:14:56.498, Speaker B: Yeah, kind of. I'm in the same camp.
00:14:56.546 - 00:14:56.682, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:56.698 - 00:15:06.362, Speaker B: If equities don't roll over, it's reasonable to assume we're bothering it around here. There's not a lot of appetite for buying, but also not a lot of appetite for selling here.
00:15:06.418 - 00:15:06.610, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:06.642 - 00:15:46.800, Speaker B: Like, volumes dropping off means they're not necessarily interested without some other reason to be interested in selling here. And so you kind of need that catalyst. So on that note, what are some positive and negative surprises. Escalation is going to geopolitics is bad. It spikes oil. And that's typically been pretty bearish for all markets. And Jay Powell was surprisingly hawkish, I think, not surprisingly, but he was pretty hawkish in the recent chat where he was basically discussing that he's comfortable keeping rates here basically into end of year.
00:15:46.800 - 00:16:11.100, Speaker B: So, yeah, it'll kind of. I think the market kind of shrugged that off. I was pretty surprised to see bitcoin dominance fall from the weekend, though, considering alts have not really performed as well. One of the factors is probably just a gradual increase in the stable coin supply. So that obviously reduces dominance.
00:16:11.252 - 00:16:23.076, Speaker C: Yeah, stable coins have been up. Only that's one bullish chart that I've been looking at is, if you like, chart USDC and USDT, like, market cap growth. Like, they have been extremely strong.
00:16:23.260 - 00:16:56.280, Speaker D: I think a lot of alts, people were just liquidated so hard on that move. And so even though bitcoin still kind of was going down over the last couple of days, a lot of the stronger alts got bit up. And like, those are, that's like, when you see what people actually want to own. Right. But like, moving it from the macro side and then moving it more to like, micro crypto side. I really think that there is something to all this bitcoin ecosystem stuff. Like, I really think that is a strong narrative that people are moving towards.
00:16:56.280 - 00:17:26.490, Speaker D: I also think that Solana is kind of becoming this l two for bitcoin. And like, the. The social layer of this matters a lot. Right? Like, why are like the biggest meme BRC token on bitcoin is doing like 80% of its volume on Solana. Right. Why is this not like on an ethereum l two or on ether something? And there's like this social. There's always been this social tension between Ethereum and bitcoin for years.
00:17:26.490 - 00:17:58.506, Speaker D: Right, right. And so Solana is now, nobody in Solana dislikes bitcoin. Really. Like, they appreciate it for what it is because Solana takes, like an extreme other side of the spectrum view on, like, the world and what they're building. And so the synergy here makes, like, a lot of sense to me. I think that I ironically said the other day that, like, Solana is an app chain to trade, to trade runes. And I think you are going to see a lot of bridging between bitcoin and solana.
00:17:58.506 - 00:18:22.134, Speaker D: I think it. I think it makes a lot of sense. But, yeah, I just feel like the overall, if you think about what people like doing on, like, blockchains. There's like, a bunch of weird crypto native stuff and you pay high fees for it. Right. And so, like, people are doing art blocks. Last cycle, bored apes, all this stuff, you know, trading meme coins.
00:18:22.134 - 00:18:54.038, Speaker D: There's a lot of things that you can pay high fees for and it doesn't really matter. And then there's, like, a lot of stuff that you need, like, super cheap, super high throughput. And so I think that bitcoin is taking a lot of this, like, high fee, weird crypto native type things from a lot of other places. And it's kind of sucking up a lot of that liquidity from, like, the non price sensitive participants. Right. And so I think that this is going to have, like, a pretty big impact on. Yeah, I don't know.
00:18:54.166 - 00:18:55.870, Speaker C: Wait, so how did the breathing actually.
00:18:55.942 - 00:19:15.354, Speaker B: Work on that alignment point, though, like, with the sole BTC side? I think that, you know, it's. It's a. An interesting way to, you know, overline the ideologies, but. Or overlap the ideologies, but I think it's just low fees. The same reason meme coins are blowing up on Solana. It's just like, low fees.
00:19:15.514 - 00:19:21.706, Speaker D: Yeah, but why? Why are. I don't know if it's just low fees. Like, there's a lot of l two.
00:19:21.730 - 00:19:24.414, Speaker B: S that have low fees but not as low.
00:19:24.994 - 00:19:25.410, Speaker C: I mean.
00:19:25.442 - 00:19:26.258, Speaker D: Yeah, for the same reason.
00:19:26.306 - 00:19:29.658, Speaker B: Like, memes in general are just bigger on Solana.
00:19:29.826 - 00:19:46.954, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe. I mean, listen, man, someone is just a meme coin in runes chain. Like, that's. That's like what people mostly use it for. Yeah, but in it. But like, it is becoming. It's not like a real l two, obviously, you're just bridging tokens and trading them.
00:19:46.954 - 00:19:55.606, Speaker D: It's like a side chain to bitcoin in a sense, but there's definitely something there with it. I think it's pretty notable.
00:19:55.710 - 00:19:55.950, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:55.982 - 00:20:12.814, Speaker B: Funny enough, I did my buying on unisex and that experience was awful. I ended up buying like twice higher than what I initially purchased because my purchases said they went through, but then they didn't actually go through because I got front run on the mempool and it only showed like hours later.
00:20:13.154 - 00:20:23.738, Speaker D: Yeah, I thought. I remember one of, like, my first ordinals. It took like, there was like a 40 minutes gap in blocks. So you're just waiting like almost.
00:20:23.786 - 00:20:26.094, Speaker C: So how does the bridging work from.
00:20:26.834 - 00:20:50.540, Speaker D: So I haven't, like, done. I haven't looked hard into this bridge or anything. So if this bridge gets exploited, like, don't play. It's like, it's called multi bit, I think is the bridge that they're using right now. But it's just like a, it's like a, it's like any proof of authority type. Type bridge, right? Similar to like a wormhole that will, like, lock in mint tokens. So, yeah, like, you're the whole.
00:20:50.540 - 00:21:06.846, Speaker D: All the security properties there come down to whatever that bridge is, whatever it is. And I don't know, this multi. I haven't looked into this bridge, so I don't know, off the top of my head, like, bridges always get exploited, so I'm not like, endorsing this bridge.
00:21:06.990 - 00:21:11.046, Speaker A: What are you, like, what? Like, what within this ecosystem are you most excited about?
00:21:11.190 - 00:21:11.518, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:11.566 - 00:21:37.956, Speaker A: As somebody like me who has, like, looked into it, like, very cursory, almost. Like when I started seeing, you know, all the show fluencers talk about it over the last week, I was like, oh, God, I should probably look at this before it goes up a million percent. Right? I was looking at magic Eden at all those collections. Like, like, for somebody who is, I'm assuming a bunch of people who listen to this are equally as new with, with the bitcoin ecosystem at this point. Like, where would you suggest people start looking for some of these things?
00:21:38.060 - 00:22:22.190, Speaker D: Um, I mean, I think it's just like, if you think for a friend. No, I mean, I think it's. And I was late. It's funny because I was bullish on ordinals when they started and I never got in because, like, the original buying experience was like one dude with a Google sheet and I was like, the marketplace and it was very cumbersome. But I think, like, if you look at, there's a lot of momentum right now to make, like, bitcoin l two s and create this whole ecosystem around bitcoin. If you just look at, like, the value of this is literally Franklin Templeton, I think the other day released this. You look at like, the value of the native token ETH versus like the ERC 20s or like sol versus that, right? I mean, you have this ecosystem, bitcoin.
00:22:22.190 - 00:22:50.450, Speaker D: It's over a trillion dollar asset that has never had, like, anything really built within the ecosystem. Now has all this, like, venture capital money and all this speculation, which has mostly come from the east. It hasn't been like a western thing, but you now have all this money come in. And so it's like, I don't know what is. Is it purely just going to be like ordinals and meme coins and that's it. And, like, there's nothing useful that comes. I'm not sure.
00:22:50.450 - 00:23:38.758, Speaker D: Um, I just think people are seeing that there's, like, a lot going on for the first time. And, like, overall, I just think it's good for bitcoin as a whole because people always bring up, like, the security budget and everything. And, like, all this activity is definitely just bullish for bitcoin overall. Um, I also think the halving is going to be interesting to see what happens with the having block, because now people care about these rare sats, right? And so getting, like, specific sats in, like, the having block is going to sell for a lot on a secondary marketplace after. So this is going to be like, probably like a 5 million plus dollar block of mev. And so there's going to be, like, tons of reorgs and everything. I think it's going to be kind of cool because this is the first halving that there's been, like, Mev on bitcoin.
00:23:38.758 - 00:23:39.302, Speaker D: Right?
00:23:39.438 - 00:23:39.710, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:39.742 - 00:24:34.862, Speaker B: I think the potential buying power, you know, thinking about in terms of ratio of, you know, speculative meme coin relative to market cap of the base chain is a good way to frame it. But on the bitcoin side, you definitely need to discount it by a lot because naturally people hold bitcoin for that reason. Whereas when you're going into the other ecosystems, there's a propensity to explore and there's interest in what's being built on top. Whereas with BTC, a lot of these guys are purists and the same reason you see kind of irrational hate towards a lot of this stuff, despite, even if you are a purist, this is actually, like you mentioned, you're making your project sustainable. And so the hate never really made sense. But I do think there's not. The ratio should be kind of discounted when looking at it versus Ethan Sol.
00:24:34.998 - 00:24:39.988, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know how many hardcore bitcoiners are going to be swapped into the meme coins.
00:24:40.156 - 00:24:50.428, Speaker D: No, that doesn't matter. It's never mattered. And this is. I've always. I've never agreed with the people were like, you can't build. You can't build, like, rolls on bitcoin. You can't build defined bitcoin because the bitcoiners don't like it.
00:24:50.428 - 00:24:53.524, Speaker D: I'm like, dude, bitcoiners are like a loud group on Twitter.
00:24:53.564 - 00:24:58.516, Speaker C: Like, no, no, I'm just saying, like, price wise. Like, I don't know if, like, a lot of people who bitcoin are the.
00:24:58.540 - 00:25:26.200, Speaker D: Same, like, well, that's the other question too, is like, are people selling BTC to speculate on this stuff, or are they selling like, their board apes and punchy penguins and like other meme coins, you know? And I think that's more likely. Like, I think it's. I think it's. I look at the people on Twitter who are talking about it, right? It's like moon, that moon overlord guy and like Deez and these guys are just like NFT DJ's and stuff. Right? So.
00:25:26.312 - 00:25:37.288, Speaker B: Which puts a lower ceiling on the potential for all of this stuff to run, right. Because it's not this massive unlock of liquidity that's piling in, but rather just the same hot ball of money moving around somewhere else.
00:25:37.456 - 00:25:39.264, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:25:39.384 - 00:26:09.432, Speaker C: I feel like a cool use case would be like, whoever figures out bitcoin borrowing, lending, like properly, that's going to be big liquidity or Dai original Dai model on BTC would be pretty cool because I think you could do something where you lock up your bitcoin and then you borrow against it, like an ordinal that's a stable coin. Maybe that's possible. I've heard some designs, something like that. That would be really cool. But whoever like, actually figures that out, it could.
00:26:09.488 - 00:26:25.504, Speaker B: So do you think that because you have the wrap BTC equivalent on Aave and stuff, so do you think that people are just really that apprehensive towards bitgo custodying their bitcoin and don't want to do that since the product kind of exists?
00:26:25.624 - 00:26:41.754, Speaker C: I think so. I think, like long term, like, I think long term, like having it like built, like, as you kind of talk about like the nation state stuff where it's like, you know, these really big players, like buying in over a long period of time, it'd be very cool to have it in a more decentralized way?
00:26:41.834 - 00:27:07.202, Speaker D: Yeah, I think whether or not it's. Yeah, I think it's something that absolutely needs to be built, like whether or not people like wrap bitcoin or not, because it's just like a fundamental primitive that has been, like missing. The only way to borrow is are like protocols that take a lot of risk with your BTC in one way or another. And so there's not like a clean way.
00:27:07.338 - 00:27:22.578, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's funny, we've skipped it and just gone straight to Djen looping on BTC. Like that exists in like juice and omega and those. We're basically. Yeah, farming.
00:27:22.746 - 00:27:26.774, Speaker C: I think a lot of bitcoiners did like block buy and stuff.
00:27:27.354 - 00:27:29.186, Speaker D: Well, yeah, right, exactly.
00:27:29.290 - 00:27:32.194, Speaker C: So they need the decentralized version.
00:27:32.354 - 00:27:47.994, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that does show the appetite was there, which an odd, I guess. Yeah, the mist trust in, or rather the misplaced trust in the centralized entity versus, or I guess one centralized entity versus the other, blockfi versus picco.
00:27:48.074 - 00:28:03.848, Speaker A: Like I have like a. Do you think these people would be more prone to use a decentralized version or just like say like JPMorgan offered something like block by did. So you're like kind of sure that it's not going to get scam rugged out from underneath you. Like what do you think the app, I mean split.
00:28:03.896 - 00:28:08.800, Speaker D: I mean, I mean, we know the answer is most people are going to use JP.
00:28:08.912 - 00:28:29.436, Speaker A: I mean, I was american at least. I mean I, I would cause like if I have like an asset, like my, just my reasoning is like if I just like, I'm super bullish bitcoin long term. Right. I don't ever want to lose it at all. Like I don't want it to be liquidated ever. So like just using kind of like that centralized entity where like you're not just going to get liquidated. You can always post collateral if you have.
00:28:29.436 - 00:28:33.548, Speaker A: Right. So like you're not going to, you know, while you're sleeping and shit like that.
00:28:33.556 - 00:28:35.184, Speaker B: You're going to centralize entity.
00:28:35.724 - 00:28:47.300, Speaker A: Well, like if you, if you borrow from like Morgan, like, like it's just a lot less, like when you borrow. They're not going to scam wick, liquidate you. Right.
00:28:47.332 - 00:28:50.084, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's like index stuff. That's like pricing.
00:28:50.124 - 00:28:51.564, Speaker A: Source it just like lend.
00:28:51.604 - 00:28:52.744, Speaker C: No, but they all.
00:28:55.924 - 00:29:01.836, Speaker A: You can call somebody on the phone and be like, yeah, yes, I'm posting collateral, just give me an hour. Right.
00:29:02.020 - 00:29:04.908, Speaker C: And they don't let you lever up too much, you know.
00:29:04.996 - 00:29:26.090, Speaker A: Right. So like if I'm a big whale and I need to get liquidity on my bitcoin, that's probably the solution I would prefer. Even though it's really like anti everything that you probably stand for. But anyway, like it's, I don't know, that's like, that's why I ask. Like I would prefer the centralized solution just like out of the tail risk.
00:29:26.202 - 00:29:29.454, Speaker B: It's funny, there is something nice about not having to manage keys.
00:29:29.874 - 00:29:34.114, Speaker D: Yeah. 100% simply the worst part.
00:29:34.234 - 00:29:34.514, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:34.554 - 00:29:40.454, Speaker B: Which is like laughably kind of counter to a lot of, a lot of this.
00:29:40.834 - 00:29:41.146, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:41.170 - 00:29:47.010, Speaker A: I don't know, it's just like a really interesting point because I want to borrow against my bitcoin, but I don't trust anything.
00:29:47.122 - 00:29:47.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:47.370 - 00:29:50.912, Speaker A: Now. So I'm just going to leave it and it's just going to sit there and do nothing.
00:29:51.058 - 00:29:51.316, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:51.340 - 00:29:54.332, Speaker D: Like I do agree that sailor Microfield.
00:29:54.428 - 00:29:57.540, Speaker C: Is going to turn into a defi bitcoin platform.
00:29:57.652 - 00:30:38.122, Speaker D: Well I do. Just on that point though, like I do agree that the yield that you can pick up with BTC, historically it's like never been worth the smart contract or counterparty risk that you're taking. I think there's a chance that like Babylon might be like the lowest risk way to get a bit extra yield. It's basically eigen layer, but you use BTC and then you just sell the like shit coins that you're restaking to into more BTC. There's like a couple. There's obviously there's still. But you're still taking some extra level of, you know, risk there.
00:30:38.218 - 00:30:39.394, Speaker C: Yeah, you can slash.
00:30:39.474 - 00:30:40.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you're doing a.
00:30:40.330 - 00:30:42.378, Speaker D: None of these things have slashing liquidity.
00:30:42.506 - 00:30:45.566, Speaker B: I do it in the battle that they had slash.
00:30:45.630 - 00:30:46.142, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:46.278 - 00:31:08.554, Speaker B: Like the yield yields are relevant at best. It's just going to cover your borrow costs. It's more so just getting that liquidity and yeah, I agree. Even like a lot of, even the major projects, right, they've had smart contract issue years and years after they've been put out. And so I agree with, you know, being able to kind of sleep a bit more comfortably knowing it's stored in a more trustworthy centralized solution.
00:31:09.014 - 00:31:11.710, Speaker D: Heard by Jamie Diamond Jamie Dimon.
00:31:11.742 - 00:31:17.160, Speaker A: I could at least go to his office and be like give me my bitcoin back. Like I can go somewhere.
00:31:17.312 - 00:31:51.036, Speaker D: Yeah. Anything else? I mean one thing I'll say with the, with the having there's a lot of stuff going on, right. So like runes obviously the having is supposed to happen in like two days now less than two days. So obviously bitcoin is launching this runes protocol which is new fungible token standard by guy who did like ordinals. Frontech v two has delayed their launch for the meme. Um, so they're also launching then? I think. I think there's a couple other things but yeah, it seems to be like a pretty big week.
00:31:51.036 - 00:32:08.404, Speaker D: Are you looking at like anything else bitcoin related? Like we didn't even talk about the impact of the having because I think we all are in agreement that it doesn't really matter. But it's funny like that that's what most people talk about is the actual underlying.
00:32:08.824 - 00:32:24.840, Speaker C: I don't think it's going to be that relevant versus ETF flows. I think it's much more hyped and like, I think it's way more likely. You know, I don't want it to be a sell the news, but, like that type of thing where it's, like, really hyped up, people think it's like, super bullish and it's.
00:32:24.872 - 00:32:25.832, Speaker B: I don't think that many people are.
00:32:25.848 - 00:32:29.384, Speaker C: Hyped up about it, though. I've seen a lot of stuff on it.
00:32:29.504 - 00:32:31.896, Speaker D: Well, what's good, though, is that if you think about last time, but the.
00:32:31.920 - 00:32:33.800, Speaker B: Price is really what, like, reflects the hype.
00:32:33.832 - 00:32:34.072, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:34.128 - 00:32:42.466, Speaker B: Like, Twitter is not an appropriate reflection of the hype around. It's more just like, it's not really good unless you think this bid is for the having.
00:32:42.610 - 00:32:44.614, Speaker C: But no, but it is.
00:32:45.154 - 00:33:06.688, Speaker D: It is. Okay. It is healthy, though. If you think about previous having, the only thing people talked about was literally the supply issuance reduction. That's all you saw on Twitter all the time. And now nobody is actually really talking about that. People are just talking about the ETF flows, runes, launching ordinals, like, roll ups coming.
00:33:06.688 - 00:33:19.128, Speaker D: And so it's a much healthier, like, way healthier dynamic now that the having narrative is not really about the having, it's about the protocols that are launching, which isn't it?
00:33:19.176 - 00:33:53.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I like the framing of it and, I mean, I don't know. Like, I feel like. I feel like a lot of the run up we got, like, after the ETF was approved, right. And then we kind of got that run from, like, march into April, where we went from, like, I don't know, 50 to 70k or so. Kind of feels like we just kind of like, front run or front ran, you know, like that having hype that you usually get every cycle. Like, I don't know, like, the flows. Like, like when you look at, like, the ETF flows chart, like, I'm pretty sure those peaked in like, march, right? Like mid March, early March.
00:33:53.464 - 00:33:59.422, Speaker A: And then flows have just been kind of like, meh, for the most part, while price has kind of gone up. So I don't know, like, I feel.
00:33:59.438 - 00:34:06.158, Speaker B: Like equities have been up only too, though, right? Like, equities have been strongly. That's. That's what's driving. It's been having hype.
00:34:06.286 - 00:34:10.454, Speaker A: I just. Yeah, I mean, I don't really think anybody really cares about the having.
00:34:10.534 - 00:34:24.000, Speaker B: Yeah. On that note, of all the stuff launching, though, you know, if we assume that there's not going to be this new pile of money that's moving into crypto, it's got. It's got to come from somewhere. So, I mean, there you do have new money coming in via increased stablecoin supply.
00:34:24.032 - 00:34:24.176, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:24.200 - 00:34:26.968, Speaker B: Like, that's one thing.
00:34:27.136 - 00:34:48.336, Speaker C: Yeah, we kind of got off topic, but, like, okay, last time bitcoin was at this price, or yesterday's price was like March 4. Right. Early March. So bitcoin's like flat from then. And stable coins are up like 12 billion, which is like, you know. Yeah, coins up 12 billion. Like 10% of all stable coins.
00:34:48.336 - 00:35:32.894, Speaker C: Like stable coin. Like something like up that chart if you want some hope. Another interesting thing, I talked just on the stable coin side. I was listening to a podcast with some macro people, and they were just talking about how the US might look for more buyers of treasuries, and stable coins could be a good lever they could pull because it's getting really adopted in all these countries where their currencies aren't very good. But I think, like, talk about a bullish case is like, oh, we could source another, like, couple hundred billion a year in demand from stable coins if we're, like, really favorable to them regulatorily. And then that would probably be good.
00:35:32.934 - 00:35:35.550, Speaker B: For, like, all 100 billion.
00:35:35.742 - 00:35:55.642, Speaker C: Like, I think over the, like, over the course of a couple years. Yeah. Right now it's at 140 billion, let's say, like, yellen comes out and like, oh, like, we love stable coins. No regulatory risk. Like, just do what you can with them. Blackrock, tokenize those t bells. Get those everywhere.
00:35:55.642 - 00:36:07.986, Speaker C: Like, I think that if they really kind of, you know, took away the red tape and just, like, gave everyone the green light, they could get, like, quite a bit of demand there.
00:36:08.130 - 00:36:25.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, they would only give the full green light, though, for the most, like, the most centralized cash backed stables. Like this new stable coin bill that went in the other day. I haven't totally. I mean, it's not. It's just like this proposal, and it basically makes everything besides the circle type model illegal.
00:36:25.444 - 00:36:29.588, Speaker C: So what, the circle is just buying us tease, right.
00:36:29.676 - 00:36:33.628, Speaker D: But, like, every other model is basically illegal under that bill proposal.
00:36:33.716 - 00:36:36.886, Speaker C: That's what they want, though. They want you to buy treasuries.
00:36:36.980 - 00:36:50.338, Speaker D: Right. I'm saying it's not good for. I don't think it's good for the industry. The only model is the centralized cash in bank type model. I do agree that that's, like, the one I feel most of.
00:36:50.346 - 00:36:52.282, Speaker C: What, CDP or what?
00:36:52.378 - 00:36:55.242, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, even, like, CDP's wouldn't be, like, legal.
00:36:55.338 - 00:36:58.994, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, well, that kind of sucks, but those don't really get any use anyways.
00:36:59.114 - 00:37:00.538, Speaker D: I mean, they're useful though.
00:37:00.666 - 00:37:01.210, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:01.322 - 00:37:03.134, Speaker D: Even if you don't use it as a.
00:37:03.454 - 00:37:11.198, Speaker C: They are, but if you look at, like, USDC is that. And then tether is that. But just like, sketch your bonds.
00:37:11.286 - 00:37:14.574, Speaker D: So tether changed its logo today. So that's. That's big news.
00:37:14.694 - 00:37:24.434, Speaker C: They're talking to a telegram tomorrow on a panel. I wonder if they need some sort of partnership. Heather in telegram, probably cool.
00:37:25.014 - 00:37:28.470, Speaker A: Payments in tether. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, telegram.
00:37:28.542 - 00:37:30.710, Speaker D: Telegram is. There's a lot of people talking about.
00:37:30.742 - 00:37:32.514, Speaker B: The protected from it.
00:37:34.764 - 00:37:38.904, Speaker C: It's had a sneaky run. Telegram is like, tripled since the start of March.
00:37:39.244 - 00:37:41.204, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not sneaky, it's top ten.
00:37:41.364 - 00:37:45.012, Speaker C: I know, but, like, no one was talking about it before. A month ago.
00:37:45.108 - 00:37:49.036, Speaker D: We looked. I mean, I looked at it a while ago, there was nothing interesting.
00:37:49.100 - 00:37:58.290, Speaker C: You looked at it? Yeah. Like, research saying most people had not heard about Todd until, like, this month.
00:37:58.412 - 00:37:59.246, Speaker A: I mean, it's held up.
00:37:59.270 - 00:38:07.622, Speaker C: Well, a two, which is like, puts in the top ten, like 30 billion. Like, ten to $30 billion.
00:38:07.758 - 00:38:32.182, Speaker D: They just have the distribution. Right. I don't think there's anything interesting there, because a few of us looked into it before, but maybe it's changed now. Like, it's been a bit. But the distribution is, like, not. That's actually the hardest thing. That's why base, by far, even though bases is not, like, interesting from a tech perspective of it all, they have this big distribution and they can just funnel people in and it's.
00:38:32.182 - 00:38:52.668, Speaker D: I mean, if you look at, like, think about, like, base did this deal with optimism. Base essentially just took all of optimism's volume and activity. Like, the only thing left on optimism really is, like, world coin who just made their own, is actually just making their own app chain. If you look at. I had this tweet the other day.
00:38:52.756 - 00:38:55.708, Speaker C: Like, there was this optimism benefit from it.
00:38:55.836 - 00:39:26.742, Speaker D: Not as much as if it was just on optimism. They get like, 5% of the revenue or something, and they gave a bunch of op tokens up. But it does, like, if they want to do the super chain vision, then, yeah, it helps to have everybody building on the op stack. But, like, there's this proto. There's this Dex on optimism called Velodrome, who made a new version of their protocol on base called Aerodrome. And the base version is trading at, like, seven or eight x. The valuation now of the optimism one.
00:39:26.742 - 00:39:35.398, Speaker D: And so that kind of just tells you, like, how big of an impact, like, base had there.
00:39:35.526 - 00:39:47.820, Speaker C: I think the distribution stuff's going to be really, really interesting because. Yeah, like something like 900 million users on Telegram. Like, that's some good reach. Yeah.
00:39:47.932 - 00:39:48.700, Speaker D: Um.
00:39:48.852 - 00:39:53.908, Speaker C: That's, like, insane. That's like. What is it? It's like more than 10% of the world's population.
00:39:54.036 - 00:39:58.548, Speaker D: That's a lot. Everyone tried. I think they said they had, like, 10 billion WeChat.
00:39:58.596 - 00:40:01.344, Speaker C: Have I 500 million.
00:40:01.924 - 00:40:03.436, Speaker A: No, it's got to have more.
00:40:03.580 - 00:40:04.460, Speaker C: That's what I said.
00:40:04.492 - 00:40:08.864, Speaker B: 1.3 bees was Q 323 data wrong?
00:40:09.804 - 00:40:11.726, Speaker C: Still telegram. Wow.
00:40:11.830 - 00:40:13.194, Speaker A: $900.
00:40:14.054 - 00:40:24.262, Speaker C: And also, did you hear the, like, the Tucker Carlson interview at the Telegram guy? I just watched a clip where he's like, I own cash and bitcoin. I don't own anything else.
00:40:24.398 - 00:40:29.014, Speaker B: Yeah, one dude, 30 person team. No, HR found like, 30 bill.
00:40:29.054 - 00:40:29.870, Speaker D: It's crazy.
00:40:29.982 - 00:40:33.514, Speaker C: Well, how connected is telegram and the ton thing?
00:40:33.814 - 00:41:11.452, Speaker D: I don't remember the exact whole story, but, yeah. Anyways, we got, like, a few minutes left here. I wanted to just mention this thing quickly, this new project that I'm pretty excited about because it's actually, like, there haven't been a lot of new, like, projects or applications that I really have gotten excited about. That is actually fundamentally something that we need. And so there's this project, cycles money. It's been in, like, the works for a while. I read, like, a paper on it a while ago, but it's by the informal systems team, which is, like, cosmos based.
00:41:11.452 - 00:41:55.056, Speaker D: And essentially, it's like this open clearing protocol. And so if you think about, you know, the banking system, you have all these banks that have different, like, liabilities or, like, payables or receivables between all of each other, and every once in a while, they just, like, clear them with no liquidity. Right. They just, like, clear them in their network of banks, like, across each other. And so this protocol is trying to do this essentially for, like, all private citizens. And so, you know, if you think about, like, you. You have something with your group of friends, and you go to, like, a bachelor party or something, and you all use this, like, app that everybody puts in what they kind of, like, bought, and then at the end, it kind of, like, nets it out, and you only send, like, the cash that you need.
00:41:55.056 - 00:42:29.204, Speaker D: Right. This is, like, just this massive open protocol that's going to do stuff like this. And the impact on, like, the amount of liquidity it'll actually save with, like, everybody sending money back and forth. You know, if, like, Jason and I have some debts, maybe I owe Jason $10, but J. But, like, Duncan also, or Jason owes, like, Duncan $10 and uh, Duncan knows me or whatever, and, like, we can just clear that amongst ourselves, but we don't have to know each other beforehand. And, like, that's kind of what the unlock is. Right.
00:42:29.204 - 00:42:46.128, Speaker D: So I think this is. I think this is really. I think this is a really cool project. Uh, I just. These are the kind of things that keep me more optimistic, even when it's, like, all just been meme, coin trading and stuff over the past couple months. So. I know Duncan.
00:42:46.128 - 00:42:51.504, Speaker D: I don't. I'm not. I. I'm not an investor in this, by the way. I just think it's cool.
00:42:51.664 - 00:42:52.448, Speaker C: Skeptical.
00:42:52.576 - 00:43:00.888, Speaker D: I don't know if. I don't know, like, how much. I don't know if this is something that can, like, make a lot of money from an, like, maybe, I guess, if you take a fee on, like, all the clear.
00:43:00.936 - 00:43:04.944, Speaker C: So this is just, like, making people not have to do math to settle payments.
00:43:04.984 - 00:43:13.954, Speaker D: It saves liquidity. It saves liquidity, actually, like, settling. You settle without moving cash around. It's pretty big on luck. I think it's pretty cool.
00:43:14.104 - 00:43:17.022, Speaker C: We need more apps, man. If this. This does it.
00:43:17.118 - 00:43:26.514, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's cool. And I'm kind of excited that someone is making this.
00:43:28.654 - 00:43:29.174, Speaker C: All right.
00:43:29.254 - 00:43:45.876, Speaker D: And then there's also. And then, I guess, for other new projects. I mean, Mackie has this thing coming out. I don't know if you guys have looked into this. I don't exactly. There's a lot of redacted stuff in the white paper, but it's launching on Friday, April 19, which is tomorrow. It seems like it's some sort of.
00:43:45.876 - 00:44:07.672, Speaker D: Looks like it's using gnosis chain, some sort of merge mining or, like, merge staking thing. It's all about, like, incentivizing solo stakers to get, like, less LSts and LRT's. And it's got, like, this whole meme coin angle. So I don't know. That's probably something that people are going to be talking about. Has opened his.
00:44:07.728 - 00:44:11.600, Speaker C: His DM's and said, payment for shell and next five.
00:44:11.752 - 00:44:15.832, Speaker D: I'm not. I don't have. I am not an investor in either of these projects.
00:44:15.888 - 00:44:23.600, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. Like, if it brings some attention back to Ethan, that would be cool. Like, I think ETH has really gotten just.
00:44:23.712 - 00:44:27.160, Speaker A: I was gonna ask you guys before we left, like, what do you guys think about ETH?
00:44:27.272 - 00:44:27.520, Speaker C: I.
00:44:27.552 - 00:44:30.524, Speaker D: Same. Same as always. I think it's fine. Like.
00:44:31.024 - 00:44:53.088, Speaker C: Like, between baseball and so good restate bitcoin is, like. It really feels like it's kind of got left in the dust here, but I think it'll have, like, I think the ETF will be really good. Sure, ETH, like really, really good. And then that also, I think, would kick off like a pretty serious all season.
00:44:53.176 - 00:44:56.928, Speaker D: Yeah, okay, but like, what if the ETF is not good for ETH?
00:44:57.016 - 00:44:59.124, Speaker A: Yeah, but like, yeah, what if the flow is actually.
00:44:59.744 - 00:45:04.966, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it would be good in the lead up for sure. And then, and then afterwards, TBD, if.
00:45:04.990 - 00:45:08.614, Speaker A: There'S a lot of the flows are just bad and there's just like not.
00:45:08.654 - 00:45:15.470, Speaker C: Much demand, I think that there will be demand. There'll be demand. Larry will get demand.
00:45:15.622 - 00:45:39.286, Speaker B: I think it helps that it's, I mean, assuming it doesn't get passed in a month. Yeah, like kind of, kind of got over this before, but just having the BTC flows to point at and then trying to extrapolate that for ETH will be bullish. But I mean, what if, you know, you kind of see continued attention going elsewhere, you kind of have a cold start problem with ETH flows.
00:45:39.310 - 00:45:39.446, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:39.470 - 00:45:50.846, Speaker B: Like, do you need will flows only happen if there's a lot of interesting stuff happening on ETH? Or can flows just happen idiosyncratically and that spurs a lot of attention on ETH.
00:45:50.910 - 00:46:27.014, Speaker C: Yeah. And then one point, like, difference between the BDC and ETF is like, I feel like I can really see the EThf leading to more direct flows into alt and other projects because it's like the whole holder base of ETH, I feel like, is way more likely to own altcoins versus the holder base of BTC. And so it's like, as ETH goes up and money comes into the system, I think they're much more likely to kind of recycle that into other alts. And so, like, that bid, that like institutional bid will flow down much more than BTC.
00:46:27.094 - 00:46:30.190, Speaker B: It also kicks off a lot of kind of apps on ETH.
00:46:30.262 - 00:46:30.470, Speaker C: Right?
00:46:30.502 - 00:46:54.854, Speaker B: Like Defi picks up as ETH activity picks up because there'll be more demand to borrow and more volume. And then as ETH price picks up, people will look for ETH beta via nfts and you'll see those marketplaces pick up. So, yeah, price, price can, price is a fundamental and can trigger other fundamentals as well. Yeah.
00:46:54.934 - 00:47:09.434, Speaker C: Just like velocity on the ecosystems and just the reflectiveness of like all that making like the defi activity go higher and yield go higher, revenues look higher. So yes, bullish on alts when the ETF comes, that should be good.
00:47:09.774 - 00:47:13.258, Speaker A: I'm not as sold. I'm open to it. I'm just not as sold with it.
00:47:13.406 - 00:47:21.906, Speaker C: All right, so the question if you assume, Ethan, no point, no counterpoints, given I'm not really sold.
00:47:22.010 - 00:47:27.066, Speaker A: I'm not sold. I was expecting a follow up question, you know, like, you know, okay, why.
00:47:27.170 - 00:47:29.014, Speaker C: Why aren't you sold, Jason?
00:47:29.434 - 00:47:41.592, Speaker A: I just don't think ETH. ETF flows will. Will. I think they will disappoint. I don't think. I don't think the tradfi demand is there for. For ETH in anywhere near the same capacity as it was for bitcoin.
00:47:41.778 - 00:47:43.076, Speaker C: And why do you say that?
00:47:43.100 - 00:47:44.420, Speaker D: Just because I agree with that.
00:47:44.532 - 00:47:45.188, Speaker C: I think.
00:47:45.316 - 00:48:02.092, Speaker A: I think as a macro asset, bitcoin fits into the whole picture very easily and nicely. With a nice bow. You got people like drunken Miller, you got all these guys who are like, oh, yeah, it's exponential gold. You know, for every five or 10% gold goes up, bitcoin goes up, like five x more, or whatever it is, you know, there's, like, some math.
00:48:02.188 - 00:48:03.740, Speaker C: So really good impression.
00:48:03.932 - 00:48:14.942, Speaker A: Yeah. So I just don't think that exists in any way, shape or form for ETH. I don't think would be buying, like, you'd be buying ETH for beta on, like, crypto.
00:48:15.038 - 00:48:30.630, Speaker C: The counterpoint to this is, I think most investors. I think most investors don't really like gold. They're just like gold. They can't do anything to. It just sits there. Whereas, like, ETH, I could see them getting, like, really fancy on these really long reports.
00:48:30.742 - 00:48:34.046, Speaker A: Bro, these people are not going to change.
00:48:34.150 - 00:48:38.582, Speaker C: No, no, they're going to. They're definitely going to be a lot of research about, like, this.
00:48:38.638 - 00:48:40.302, Speaker D: Yeah, but gold, trying to value it.
00:48:40.318 - 00:48:42.182, Speaker C: Like, more like a tech company. Huge.
00:48:42.278 - 00:48:44.334, Speaker D: But gold doesn't have ordinals.
00:48:44.494 - 00:48:46.014, Speaker C: What? I'm not talking about.
00:48:46.174 - 00:48:47.958, Speaker D: No, but I'm saying bitcoin is a.
00:48:47.966 - 00:48:59.414, Speaker C: Lot more similar to gold in the sense that it's like, there's no really earnings or anything. It's just, like, there. And it's. I guess it fits really nicely into that narrative. But, like, ETH, I think, is much more like a technology stock that they can, like.
00:48:59.494 - 00:49:00.634, Speaker A: I agree. I think.
00:49:01.014 - 00:49:03.514, Speaker C: Yes, but there's only the narrative around.
00:49:04.034 - 00:49:06.050, Speaker A: Like, they could just buy Nvidia, dude.
00:49:06.162 - 00:49:07.050, Speaker D: But it's also. If you don't.
00:49:07.082 - 00:49:11.658, Speaker B: If you don't have enough on chain activity, then, you know, but it's gonna be bearish.
00:49:11.746 - 00:49:11.970, Speaker C: It's.
00:49:12.002 - 00:49:12.194, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:12.234 - 00:49:17.322, Speaker C: Feed into each other. Right. Like, people can get hyped about the ETF. They're not chain activities gonna pick up. They're gonna like, oh, my God, the burns.
00:49:17.378 - 00:49:19.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the run.
00:49:20.154 - 00:49:20.906, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:49:20.930 - 00:49:21.266, Speaker C: I think.
00:49:21.330 - 00:49:25.274, Speaker B: But so on the flow stuff, I think after comp it.
00:49:25.394 - 00:49:25.690, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:25.722 - 00:49:28.546, Speaker B: Copying it to bitcoin flows doesn't really make sense. It's just gonna be like.
00:49:28.570 - 00:49:30.160, Speaker A: But what else do you call it to?
00:49:30.322 - 00:49:38.356, Speaker B: I think you have some expectation of EDTF flows and then you kind of come up with that separately, and then it's whether it meets that metric.
00:49:38.420 - 00:49:38.764, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:38.844 - 00:49:51.332, Speaker B: I think it's always going to underperform BTC flows. It's just like there's going to be some expectation and then it's basically whether it underperforms or forms that specific expectation rather than bigger. Because I agree. I think there's just no way it's going to compare.
00:49:51.388 - 00:49:52.424, Speaker A: And like, my question.
00:49:54.604 - 00:50:00.484, Speaker C: Like three or four to one. So I could see ETF's flows being like four to one. Like bitcoin, Eric.
00:50:00.524 - 00:50:02.828, Speaker A: So, like, but if you think it.
00:50:02.836 - 00:50:10.556, Speaker B: Was a lot smaller, there's a lot smaller difference when BTC ETF launched, right? Like, you're comparing it now versus at launch fell.
00:50:10.740 - 00:50:25.396, Speaker A: So, like, as like an institutional investor, and you go to buy the ETH, like, buy e through the ETF. Like, what's the thesis there? Like what? Like, what's the rationale to buy ETH over gold or to buy, like, ETH over, like a high growth tech stock, like Nvidia or something?
00:50:25.540 - 00:50:41.820, Speaker D: The other thing too is like, like, what's the deal? Yeah, people love index plays. And BTC is like, it's not just like this digital gold thing, whatever. It's also just an index plan, everything. And you can't say that with e. Like, it's clearly not. It's up 50%. It's underperforming.
00:50:41.820 - 00:51:12.512, Speaker D: BTC by, like, by half over the last year, you know, swells up a bunch. You have all this Cosmo stuff. You have to think way more about ETH versus these other assets versus BTC. You don't. And it is a different analysis. So, yes, while you can do this whole tech angle and say that that's more bullish because they love these tech stocks and all this stuff, there's also way more competition. And so it's not as simple as just saying I want the leader, like in Solana on the decision to allocate.
00:51:12.512 - 00:51:20.344, Speaker D: People just want exposure to the asset class. And how do you get that as BTC? It's a easy, ETH is more of an active decision than BTS.
00:51:20.384 - 00:51:23.444, Speaker C: I think you guys are going to be surprised.
00:51:25.464 - 00:51:26.784, Speaker A: I hope I am, dude.
00:51:26.824 - 00:51:53.748, Speaker B: Like, yeah, it all depends on what ETHC is trading at as well, right. If you have the scenario where the ratio is just gone in the absolute gutter and then, you know, you think about incremental upside on one versus the other, that on its own can spur a decent amount of flow. So on that note, how low do we think BTC goes? And I guess part of that is based on your expectation of ETF timing.
00:51:53.876 - 00:52:07.468, Speaker C: I. It's probably fairly close to bottoming. Maybe it's at 0.048 right now. It got as low as four. Four, six ish, 462 ish. Yeah.
00:52:07.468 - 00:52:19.346, Speaker C: Like, this is the lowest it's been in like three years, though. I think it's probably pretty close. Maybe get down to like 0.4, but I think it's probably not .4 is.
00:52:19.370 - 00:52:24.634, Speaker B: Like another 20% move from here. So it's not that close to low. So you can't say it's at the lows and then.
00:52:24.794 - 00:52:28.050, Speaker C: But it's like, I don't think it's going to like 0.2. I don't think it's getting kind.
00:52:28.122 - 00:52:30.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm in the 0.04 camp.
00:52:31.066 - 00:52:38.242, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that would be like, if. If the ETF is in like January or something, you could probably just see.
00:52:38.298 - 00:52:40.418, Speaker B: It'S a lot of time for bleeding.
00:52:40.426 - 00:52:51.810, Speaker A: Could just. So like point. Yeah, point. Oh, I think I had like 0.045 a long time ago, but now looking at it again, it probably goes lower than that. So, yeah, probably like 0.04 or something.
00:52:51.962 - 00:53:02.374, Speaker B: Aside from like sentiment being in the absolute gutter on, on ETH, what else is going to cause flows into it right now?
00:53:03.274 - 00:53:05.618, Speaker C: Like in the ETF or, or.
00:53:05.666 - 00:53:06.746, Speaker B: No, into ETH.
00:53:06.890 - 00:53:17.226, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the eigen that when that goes live, it's going to be just the yield, just the reflective nature of all this stuff is just going to really take hold, I think.
00:53:17.370 - 00:53:25.690, Speaker B: When is that hard to support it yield, though, because you need someone buying Eigen to offset the yield, to offset the selling. Right.
00:53:25.802 - 00:53:26.730, Speaker C: Don't worry. I think.
00:53:26.802 - 00:53:45.598, Speaker D: I think this is like the fun. This is the fundamental thing with restaking, though, is that like every protocol that uses e three stakers, they just have them dumping their token. Like, the incentive structure is not clear that it actually works. Like, of course everybody wants points and of course everybody wants to get extra yield on their ETH.
00:53:45.686 - 00:54:02.886, Speaker C: Yeah. That's what's going to make it go up. I don't think it makes any sense, or I should say, I think that the use case is way overhyped right now. Like, the actual utility is way overhyped. But I still think that it'll cause a run up. Like, what drives these markets is yield. It's like money will go where the yield is.
00:54:02.886 - 00:54:10.656, Speaker C: We've seen that over and over and over again. Even if it's a fake yield menu will go there. So I think that that'll probably lead to Iran.
00:54:10.800 - 00:54:21.244, Speaker D: Yeah. Anyways, we're. We're pretty past the hour now. I don't know if you guys, like, have anything else you want to talk about or maybe we want to wrap her up.
00:54:21.864 - 00:54:22.644, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:23.264 - 00:54:25.304, Speaker A: No, that was good fireworks at the end.
00:54:25.424 - 00:54:26.128, Speaker D: Yeah, it was good.
00:54:26.176 - 00:54:33.122, Speaker B: It's worth saying that we record on Thursday mornings just for reference because we're talking about prices and stuff.
00:54:33.218 - 00:54:34.410, Speaker C: True. Yeah.
00:54:34.482 - 00:54:37.454, Speaker D: Oh, could be at 40k tomorrow. Who knows?
00:54:38.074 - 00:54:38.434, Speaker B: 40.
00:54:38.474 - 00:54:38.874, Speaker D: Keith.
00:54:38.914 - 00:54:39.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:39.154 - 00:54:39.814, Speaker B: Bullish.
00:54:40.994 - 00:54:52.454, Speaker D: All right, so, yeah, thanks for listening, everybody. And we will be back in a couple weeks. We'll probably have Jose back and. Yeah. Happy having.
00:54:52.994 - 00:54:53.474, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
