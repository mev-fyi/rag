00:00:00.240 - 00:00:06.238, Speaker A: Ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on the blockchain.
00:00:06.326 - 00:00:10.674, Speaker B: Alexei Pertsov was arrested August 10 for his involvement with tornado cash.
00:00:12.654 - 00:00:19.142, Speaker C: If the technology can be destroyed by the government, then actually it doesn't function as advertised.
00:00:19.238 - 00:00:24.518, Speaker B: The functionality of Ethereum and the things that you could do on it scares people, scares regulators in particular.
00:00:24.646 - 00:00:28.034, Speaker A: Now the question is, what will you build on top of Ethereum?
00:00:34.644 - 00:01:17.834, Speaker D: Ethereum is arguably the most important and resilient innovation in blockchain and cryptocurrency. It's a public ledger that facilitates computer programs or smart contracts running on top of it. These are decentralized applications that provide financial services or privacy to users. Or they could be nfts, like one of one art or communities, like Bald Ape Yacht Club, or world of women. Its decentralized nature also allows for global scale cooperation, and its core principle is censorship resistance. Despite these lofty ideals, ethereum is just a tool and a young one. What matters is what the tool is used for.
00:01:17.834 - 00:01:23.264, Speaker D: Vitalik Buterin was just 21 when he created Ethereum.
00:01:24.204 - 00:01:28.076, Speaker E: Explain to me why this technology is so transformational that people think it'll change.
00:01:28.100 - 00:01:35.876, Speaker A: The world because they represent kind of epochal changes in the options that we have for interacting with each other.
00:01:35.980 - 00:02:22.604, Speaker B: I would say this is one of the core guarantees of why this technology is so special in the first place is that we are trying to create a financial system that is not just tightly controlled by some entity, some area that it's domiciled in, because then otherwise you just have a marginal improvement on traditional finance. There's no actual meaningful, probably societal gain. You don't actually help all these people who need access to financial systems around the world and who actually want those guarantees and value that privacy. Those are the things that are no longer a marginal improvement over the traditional financial system. They're actually just a fundamentally different way of having this borderless open financial system that anyone can access. And that's fundamentally a really, really exciting thing that changes whole industries, doesn't it?
00:02:23.184 - 00:02:24.800, Speaker A: It hasn't yet, but we'll see.
00:02:24.912 - 00:02:31.160, Speaker E: Do you feel like the destroyer of worlds here? I mean, you can essentially eliminate how many jobs by doing that?
00:02:31.272 - 00:02:33.576, Speaker A: Destroyer of jobs, creator of better ones.
00:02:33.720 - 00:02:34.964, Speaker E: Because that's pretty good.
00:02:36.544 - 00:02:59.314, Speaker D: During the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of cryptocurrencies exploded, with Ethereum growing by an order of magnitude. Nfts, decentralized finance and stablecoins all played a part in Ethereum's market cap growing ten times the amount this drew scrutiny from us regulators.
00:02:59.474 - 00:03:14.242, Speaker F: President Biden is reportedly gearing up to take the first steps toward regulating cryptocurrency. This has sparked some concern over the state and future of the digital assets. The deadline for agencies to respond to President Biden's crypto executive order is here.
00:03:14.298 - 00:03:26.534, Speaker G: We don't want to stand in the way of appropriate innovation, particularly including digital innovation. But we think that something like that, which is purporting to be money, would need to be appropriately regulated.
00:03:27.914 - 00:03:40.214, Speaker D: One of Ethereum's guarantees is censorship resistance for all, regardless of jurisdiction. But with mounting pressure, it was unclear how the network would fare against the regulatory headwind.
00:03:41.074 - 00:04:08.884, Speaker B: This has been obviously a known threat to just blockchains in general for a very long time. This idea of how do we protect it from censorship resistance when regulators around the world start to kind of push on things as they get uncomfortable? The functionality of Ethereum and the things that you could do on it scares people. It scares regulators in particular who don't really know how to get their grips on and control this thing anymore in the way that they have a very tight control over the traditional finance system.
00:04:09.904 - 00:04:34.462, Speaker D: With the US government's eye fixed on Ethereum, an opportunity presented itself to rein in the wayward cryptocurrency. Tornado cash is one of the decentralized applications built on top of Ethereum. It's a general purpose privacy tool which mixes users funds that enables them to withdraw the funds untraceably from the pool. It provides privacy on an otherwise public ledger.
00:04:34.558 - 00:04:44.962, Speaker H: These types of mixing services, tornado cash in particular, has been a go to tool to obfuscate transactions by cyber criminals, particularly North Korea.
00:04:45.058 - 00:04:58.094, Speaker D: Because of its effectiveness at providing privacy, tornado cash had been used for high profile cryptocurrency hacks Axie Infinity and Harmony Bridge. But this was only a small percentage of its total use.
00:05:03.874 - 00:05:16.120, Speaker B: It is used in some cases for, you know, putting hacking funds through it, but it is also open source software that people use for very legitimate use cases. So it was very concerning when that started to draw attention from censorship.
00:05:16.192 - 00:05:31.244, Speaker H: I mean, my view is that as we sort of do more and more transacting on an entirely open financial system, there are going to be legitimate reasons why people want to anonymize transactions, right? You don't want someone looking at every credit card transaction you've ever done.
00:05:31.784 - 00:05:46.644, Speaker D: Armed with the evidence of tornado cash's use by north korean hackers, the US regulators made their move. On the 8 August 2022, the US Office of Foreign Asset Control OFAC sanctioned tornado cash.
00:05:47.464 - 00:06:12.726, Speaker C: What? Actually, this sanctioned was OFAC has a list called the specially designated nationals list that the US has decided to sanction. That is, it's ordered people and businesses under its jurisdiction, not basically not to do business with those people. What OFAc did was they added tornado cash to that list of specially designated nationals.
00:06:12.910 - 00:06:26.942, Speaker F: There's been an arrest in the tornado cash saga, the block reported. The developer is Alexei Hertzev, as confirmed by his wife, the fiod statement said on Wednesday, August 10.
00:06:27.038 - 00:06:30.914, Speaker B: This is really pissed off crypto, Twitter and just coders everywhere.
00:06:33.294 - 00:07:12.290, Speaker D: Alexei Herzev in Amsterdam and they arrested him for what? Writing cold it is a joke as the crypto community reeled from the tornado cash sanction and Alexei Pertsevs arrest flashbots, the largest build of ethereums blocks, confirmed they would be censoring OFAC transactions. Several decentralized finance applications also banned people from using their website who had previously used tornado cash. And USDC, the largest, stablecoin, was frozen in all sanctioned addresses. But as the tornado cash sanction was unprecedented, these responses were based on hurried interpretations of the sanction.
00:07:12.482 - 00:07:54.364, Speaker C: One interpretation you could have is to say, well, the list is a list of persons who are sanctioned. Therefore, OFAC must believe that there is a person called tornado Cash and that these addresses belong to that person, are somehow facilitating money laundering for that person. And it seems like implicitly a lot of projects leapt to that interpretation. So next day you go to your, you know, you go to your favorite defi site and it's blocking you because the address that you're trying to do a transaction with is did some transaction with tornado cash at some point. That is very disappointing to me.
00:07:55.224 - 00:08:48.764, Speaker D: As decentralized applications applied a conservative interpretation of the sanction, members of the Ethereum community took action by highlighting the unclear nature of the sanctions in the most crypto way possible. With memes, small amounts of Ethereum from tornado cashs pool started appearing in the wallets of celebrities like Jimmy Fallon, Steve Aoki and youtuber Logan Paul. Prominent members of the crypto community were also dusted with Binance, FTX and Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong. All been sent small amounts of sanctioned Ethereum. This crypto activism made it impossible to distinguish between real users of tornado cash and those who had been dusted. The activists had made their point. Sanctioning a smart contract was infeasible, while applications quickly censoring tornadicash users was a scary scenario on Ethereum.
00:08:48.764 - 00:09:00.444, Speaker D: It was at the protocol level where Ethereum needed to remain uncensored to uphold its guarantees, and it was the Ethereum validator set that held the power to truly censor the chain.
00:09:00.744 - 00:09:33.900, Speaker B: The validator set is the key area where I think that the strongest red line is of what the Ethereum community considers an attack on Ethereum. If you have the majority of validators who decide to censor, then that's where you start to get the really, really hairy scenarios of, you can actually completely exclude all OFAC transactions from the chain. Let's say that you have a 50 50 split of censoring and non censoring validators. It depends on how far they take their censorship.
00:09:34.012 - 00:09:45.244, Speaker D: Due to Ethereum's design, there are two levels of censorship that validators can impose. The first is scenario one. The first scenario doesn't cause full censorship.
00:09:45.784 - 00:10:18.638, Speaker B: So the simplest thing you would do is, whenever I'm a proposer, I just won't include OFAC transactions, but I will allow other people to include OFAC transactions in their blocks. And like, I don't care, I'll vote for those blocks. So if you had, say, 50 50, we're censoring and non censoring, but they are willing to vote on blocks that come in and like, that's not a problem. The only effect for censored transactions is on average, you just wait two blocks because, you know, 50 50 shot of, you know, I'll get a censoring validator who won't let me in, and then I'll just get in the next block when they let me in.
00:10:18.806 - 00:10:22.766, Speaker D: The other attack scenario is where the real red line lies.
00:10:22.950 - 00:11:03.670, Speaker B: So that red line would be, is if validators take the stance that I won will not propose a block that includes OFAC transactions. Two, I will not attest to a block that includes oFAc transactions. And then third, if there is a block that includes oFAC transactions that is proposed, and say I'm the next proposer, I will actively build a competing block to that. One, I will not even build on top of it. I will essentially reorg it out of the chain and continue my own chain. Simple scenario is if you have 51% of validators who are saying, I will not even build on top of a chain that includes OFAC transactions. That is when transactions are truly censored and they will never even be included in the chain.
00:11:03.670 - 00:11:27.194, Speaker B: If you are an OFAC transaction, that is when you get completely blocked from being in Ethereum at all. And that is the real red line in the sand of. It's not just, okay, you have to wait a little bit. It's, we have completely lost censorship, resistance guarantees, and then what's the point of this chain at this point? That is the point of validators take that stance that you would probably decide as a community, hey, we are going to fork away from this. We are going to punish that actor and continue without them.
00:11:27.654 - 00:11:47.348, Speaker D: Forking the chain to prevent us censorship would be the nuclear option as it would split the chain into a US censored chain and a non us uncensored chain. With the Ethereum community clear, it would fork if necessary. It opened the possibility of the US being cut off from the new decentralized industries Ethereum was creating.
00:11:47.436 - 00:12:10.790, Speaker C: It's like gambling, right? I mean, the US cracked down on online gambling, you know, in sort of the mid to late two thousands. And as a result, it's not like online gambling went away. It's just not in the United States anymore, right? It went to other jurisdictions and certain ones, designed a whole positive regulatory regime around it and welcomed it with open arms, and it still exists.
00:12:10.982 - 00:12:27.284, Speaker D: Pushing the crypto industry and the businesses and jobs it creates outside of the US might be only one of the unintended consequences of the regulations. The tornado cash sanction and the arrest of developer Alexi Perteville could push privacy technology development underground.
00:12:29.544 - 00:12:46.124, Speaker C: What it will do is drive people to have better and better Opsec, be more anonymous, live in weird foreign non us jurisdictions, and just be as outside the system as possible.
00:12:47.064 - 00:12:58.234, Speaker D: The US stifling crypto and pushing the businesses and jobs it creates offshore could be beyond the pale for crypto positive us citizens, which would have a knock on effect on future policy.
00:12:58.974 - 00:13:41.790, Speaker B: If you have a lot of your citizens who are using this thing and saying, we really, really want this thing and are going to continue building it, despite what any government around the world tells us, that does start to wake some people up. And you started to see that increasingly in the last year, which is really cool to see that. You are seeing senators and house members who are issuing letters saying that the government overreached on what they did in Tornado cash, that is not something that would have ever happened a couple of years ago. The reason they're doing that is because they realize that people are pushing back on this. And if all of the people are pushing back on this, you ultimately do have a system. If you do have a system where politicians are accountable to those people, they are ultimately going to get the message eventually, even if it is a tough.
00:13:41.822 - 00:14:07.694, Speaker C: Fight, there are going to be more and more crypto positive politicians. And I think ultimately that's going to result in us getting to, I wouldn't say a perfect place. I think there will always be a tension there, right? Because this is designed to be kind of government opt out technology in a certain sense. Let's just be real. But I think it will get to more of a sane place over time.
00:14:08.114 - 00:14:19.556, Speaker D: Despite a strong pushback to the OFAC sanctions, the Ethereum community could support well thought through regulation that targets profit making entities rather than smart contract developers or Ethereum itself.
00:14:19.700 - 00:14:28.436, Speaker B: Getting more regulatory clarity is going to be very important, and the Ethereum community just proving as a whole that this is truly decentralized software.
00:14:28.620 - 00:14:48.120, Speaker C: It probably would just make sense to kind of let the Internet be the Internet, let tools be tools, let information be information, and look at the things that are really businesses that people are placing a lot of trust in and paying a lot of money to and regulate those rather than trying to regulate software.
00:14:48.272 - 00:14:56.484, Speaker D: Though Ethereum has evolved a lot in the short years since its creation and has already faced down major challenges, there are far more to come.
00:14:59.704 - 00:15:29.904, Speaker B: This is the beginning. So in Vitalik's own ethcc speech that he gave the keynote speech in Paris, his speech, he clearly explained the point of ethereum. Forget about the s curve for adoption. Ethereum is actually at the bottom of the s curve for its technical development, to the point where the next call it five years or so are probably going to be the most rapid development period in Ethereum's history, and hopefully for its future too.
00:15:30.244 - 00:15:41.574, Speaker D: As Ethereum approaches its second decade and has faced off its largest battle test, the question remains, how important will Ethereum be for the world, and can it survive?
