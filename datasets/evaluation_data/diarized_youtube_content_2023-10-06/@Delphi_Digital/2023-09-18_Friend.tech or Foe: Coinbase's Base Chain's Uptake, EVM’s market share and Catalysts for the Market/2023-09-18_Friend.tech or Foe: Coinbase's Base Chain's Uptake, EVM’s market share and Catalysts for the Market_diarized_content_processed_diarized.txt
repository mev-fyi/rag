00:00:00.360 - 00:01:01.480, Speaker A: Disclosure, nothing said on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hi, everyone. My name is Jose Macedou, and welcome to the second episode of the Hive Mind podcast. The goal of the podcast is to provide an inside look into what we like to call the Delphi Hivemind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights alpha and ship posts. Today with us, we have ceteris Paribus Ceteris from our institutional research arm, who focuses in blockchain infrastructure. In DeFi, we have Jan Lieberman, managing partner at Delphi Ventures, and ventures associate Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, prodigious shitcoin scavenger and investor.
00:01:01.480 - 00:01:15.924, Speaker A: I lead Delphi Labs, our protocol R and D arm focused on incubating and accelerating new web, three primitives. It's been a hectic week in crypto with friendtech launching base and some macro stuff, so we're going to dive into all that.
00:01:16.944 - 00:01:38.524, Speaker B: Okay, so I have a pretty extensive sleep setup. I got like a fan, an air conditioner, blackout blinds, a Faraday cage, and like, a mat that goes under my bed to, like, block out all the EMF stuff. Then I have earplugs and eye mask, and I've just ordered the eight sleep mattress, so I'll let you guys know.
00:01:39.064 - 00:01:40.272, Speaker C: Oh, so you haven't done it yet?
00:01:40.328 - 00:01:43.912, Speaker A: Girls over. What do they say when they see your cage?
00:01:43.968 - 00:01:48.360, Speaker B: Yeah, the cage is new.
00:01:48.552 - 00:01:51.624, Speaker D: You don't get any cell signal in here, so don't worry.
00:01:51.784 - 00:02:02.644, Speaker B: You know, what Matt Bridges said is, like, I sent in the cage one day, like, the full chat, and Matt, I was like, this keeps out EMF. He, like, forwards me the message. He's like, and girls.
00:02:04.864 - 00:02:06.224, Speaker C: Well, keeps in.
00:02:06.264 - 00:02:08.124, Speaker A: Girls as well, I guess. In your case.
00:02:09.944 - 00:02:24.474, Speaker D: I was looking at the eight sleeps, but I opted for a mattress pad that has the same cooling stuff where it cools into the night and warms up in the morning, just because I don't like the eight sleep mattresses much. And so it was like the best of both your mattress.
00:02:24.514 - 00:02:27.778, Speaker A: And then I'm doing all right?
00:02:27.826 - 00:02:28.618, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:28.786 - 00:02:31.114, Speaker D: It's a chili pad is what I got.
00:02:31.274 - 00:02:38.178, Speaker A: Okay. You're definitely gonna be like, drinking young kids blood and stuff when you're older and doing, doing that.
00:02:38.346 - 00:02:40.586, Speaker B: Go Brian Johnson mode.
00:02:40.770 - 00:02:43.674, Speaker C: Yeah, Duncan's definitely doing all that stuff.
00:02:43.754 - 00:02:44.730, Speaker A: 100%.
00:02:44.922 - 00:02:48.386, Speaker B: Lots of vitamins and stuff. I tried. Yeah.
00:02:48.450 - 00:02:48.786, Speaker D: Okay.
00:02:48.810 - 00:02:52.534, Speaker B: We don't need this. But I've tried a bunch of different things, you know, like the all meat diet.
00:02:54.374 - 00:02:55.394, Speaker A: How was that?
00:02:55.974 - 00:03:06.246, Speaker B: That was good, but it's. My girlfriend definitely, like, was, like, broke up with me over that because we couldn't go. Like, that was the only thing I would use, steak, and she's like, we fucking eat something else.
00:03:06.390 - 00:03:09.954, Speaker C: I'm like, come on, man. I did, like, a pretty please.
00:03:10.414 - 00:03:12.514, Speaker D: I did, like, a draw the line.
00:03:13.454 - 00:03:30.014, Speaker C: I did, like, a pretty hard cut. Like, basically no carbs. Years ago, maybe like seven, eight years ago. Intermittent fasting all the time. All the time. I got so lean that actually kind of started, like, fucking me up. Like, I was freezing cold all the time.
00:03:30.014 - 00:03:39.674, Speaker C: I was tired all the time. I had to put back on. I had to put back on, like, 20 pounds to start feeling, like, good again. It, like, messed up my hormones and everything.
00:03:40.134 - 00:03:46.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I used to do that for fights, and it's horrible. That's never again. I just eat whatever the I want now.
00:03:46.230 - 00:03:52.374, Speaker B: Yeah, like cutting. So how does that work? You have to get down to a certain weight, like the. The day of the fight or the day before?
00:03:53.114 - 00:04:10.722, Speaker A: Both, depending what you compete in, like, an MMA, it'll be like the day before. So then you can do, like, some really wild cuts where you, like, waterload and then basically cut water. And you can literally have, like, 2025 pound weight gains in, like the 36 hours till you fight or whatever.
00:04:10.778 - 00:04:12.826, Speaker B: Like, it's wild.
00:04:13.010 - 00:04:27.382, Speaker A: Yeah, and like a. Like a day, if you do that properly, the same days, you can't do that shit. Cause obviously, if you step onto this, when you step onto the scale, you're literally, like, about to faint kind of thing. So, yeah, it's pretty terrible.
00:04:27.558 - 00:04:31.074, Speaker D: And also, my dad just did a very unhealthy, inadvertent.
00:04:32.174 - 00:04:49.906, Speaker C: When my dad was a kid, he had to make to join certain ball, like, weight heights. They had the weighing every year. So he run around in the heat with a garbage bag on and lose, like, ten pounds of water, get on the scale, like, almost dying, and then good to go.
00:04:49.930 - 00:04:50.854, Speaker A: This for wrestling?
00:04:51.514 - 00:04:53.090, Speaker C: No, football. Like.
00:04:53.162 - 00:04:53.986, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:04:54.170 - 00:04:58.934, Speaker C: Yeah, there's, like, weight weight. Why would they. Well, because it's tags.
00:04:59.914 - 00:05:02.082, Speaker A: This. In Canada, they play. They play football.
00:05:02.178 - 00:05:07.214, Speaker D: Usually they're not. They're optimizing for more weight, though. Especially in linemen.
00:05:07.674 - 00:05:16.574, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. But you need to. They do the leagues by weight, so they don't have some massive kid just rocking, like, smaller kids.
00:05:16.734 - 00:05:18.074, Speaker D: Yeah, kidding.
00:05:18.814 - 00:05:21.434, Speaker C: Like a tall Danny almonte. Anyway. Yeah.
00:05:21.774 - 00:05:28.354, Speaker A: What about. What about you, Yan? How's the how's the belly coming along? I know you. You had a baby belly.
00:05:28.734 - 00:05:39.844, Speaker D: Yeah, I had a kid eleven days ago, so it was shedding weight now due to the lack of sleep, but that's awesome.
00:05:41.144 - 00:05:45.040, Speaker C: Found out you weren't traded. You weren't trading friend tech on the weekend.
00:05:45.072 - 00:05:56.284, Speaker D: Then I bought a couple shares, but I know I've been not trading anything. I've actually bought shares with people whose group I want to join, but let me go through.
00:05:57.504 - 00:05:59.164, Speaker A: I bought some Osaka.
00:05:59.984 - 00:06:13.338, Speaker D: I bought soccer. Yeah. Do I have will price avi ju money rob disclosure, Sisyphus? And that's all I have so far.
00:06:13.426 - 00:06:15.602, Speaker B: Is there, like, actually any alpha in the chats or.
00:06:15.618 - 00:06:16.450, Speaker A: No, no, not really.
00:06:16.562 - 00:06:19.094, Speaker D: So far, nice general conversations.
00:06:19.994 - 00:06:27.410, Speaker B: I don't really know how it works that well. Do you want to explain? Yeah, I mean, basically, just buy a share, and then you get a paid group.
00:06:27.522 - 00:06:43.136, Speaker C: People come in. Yeah. When they join, they, like, trigger this, like, issuance of their shares. It's all on a bonding curve. And so there's, like, there's a real, real incentive to kind of buy up someone's or keys. We should call them keys. They're not shares.
00:06:43.136 - 00:07:03.664, Speaker C: They're keys to buy up someone's, like, keys early. Right. And then. Yeah, you get access to this, basically group chat with them. It's, for the most part right now, it's a popularity contest. Like, you know, Kobe sits near the top. You've got ansem up there who's been pretty active with it.
00:07:03.664 - 00:07:42.414, Speaker C: And recently, you've seen. You've seen it cross out a bit like you got Grayson Allen, right? NBA stars come in. You have faze banks, who I think. I don't actually know who he is, but he's popular, and there's, like, a bunch of only fangirls girls joining that, too. So the thing is, the way creators monetize here is through volume of their shares being traded. Like, every buyer sell takes a 10% fee. Five goes to the protocol, five goes to the creator.
00:07:42.414 - 00:08:04.204, Speaker C: And so that's actually how they make the money. It's not off people holding your shares. It's actually just on a lot of trading volume. So being someone who is actually pretty, like, volatile personality, tries to, like, you know, get a lot of activity in their shares is.
00:08:04.284 - 00:08:06.148, Speaker A: That's not you, I guess.
00:08:06.236 - 00:08:08.904, Speaker B: Man, imagine Sue Zoo last year.
00:08:12.084 - 00:08:12.372, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:12.388 - 00:08:48.858, Speaker D: It's like, you have weird alignment. Right on. You almost want to incentivize a sell off and then a buyback because you're better off chairs dumping and then returning back to where they were versus just staying constant. Like Sarah said, I think it's cool. I have issues. So one of the concerns, I think the bonding curve is far too steep and that hinders adoption. So bonding curve just basically means with each new share outstanding, the price goes up, so you buy off the curve, and so there's more shared outstanding, and then to sell, you sell into the curve, so there's less shared outstanding and price goes down.
00:08:48.858 - 00:09:36.814, Speaker D: But the issue is, I think the numbers were, I should pull those up. But basically, if you have around 200, 250 shares, the entrance is like three ETH. So what that does is it really limits the amount of people that can participate in the group. And so I think it limits the audience and kind of what are potential solutions. It's tough to change the curve once it's already live because the modification here would be to flatten it. But then you're really rugging existing users and also you have everyone on different points of the curve, just based on how many shares are outstanding. Where do you start to flatten it? Somebody's getting screwed.
00:09:36.814 - 00:09:58.634, Speaker D: You either have to flatten it at the most expensive part, which then it hurts to let the least amount of people. By the most expensive part, I just mean, like racers, basically, he's his shares of the highest. So you flatten it there. You could do a share split. The concern is there, you know, so basically each person owns one share. As long as you have one share, you get access to the. To the.
00:09:58.634 - 00:10:02.014, Speaker D: The conversation. If you have any more. It's basically for split.
00:10:02.054 - 00:10:10.036, Speaker A: What are you trying to solve? You're trying to solve the problem that this thing is going to get too expensive if, like, you can only.
00:10:10.180 - 00:10:12.452, Speaker D: I think it's already too expensive and.
00:10:12.468 - 00:10:13.284, Speaker A: Maybe not even that.
00:10:13.364 - 00:10:48.568, Speaker D: Yeah, at most, I think realistically you should probably, you know, so there's a couple of kind of paths. One, if you do a share split, you're going to have a massive sell off, because, you know, I'm only going to hold now. Instead of one, I have ten shares. I only need one, so I'll sell the other nine. So you get a massive sell up there. The way you kind of counter that is potentially adding additional forms of utility to holding more shares, whether it's access to a smaller group or IRL stuff, potentially for kind of like media or like celebrities. I think the thing that should have happened in the beginning was customization of the bonding curve itself.
00:10:48.568 - 00:11:23.774, Speaker D: And obviously you don't want the creators coming in and saying, I want this formula, but you can do that through a UI where they say, I am looking to create an intimate group or I'm looking to create a larger group. And so you kind of adjust the curves parameters based on that, and you do it all in the back end. So the problem is once it's all live, it's really hard to adjust without somebody getting screwed. Yeah. And so the other solution is potentially, like, creating multiple curves for people for different types of access. Right. So it's accomplishing a similar goal, but, yeah, I think it's just so hard to adjust these once they're live.
00:11:23.774 - 00:11:27.234, Speaker D: And I think it's really hard to kind of put the genie back in the bottle on that front.
00:11:27.814 - 00:11:52.570, Speaker C: The hardest part to me is that there's just no clean exit. If you're. If you're a creator and you're on this now, you have the share price, you don't, and you don't want to do it anymore. There's no clean way to stop. Like, there's really not you. The only way to stop is to just stop posting, and then everyone who's holding your shares lose money, basically. You could kind of, like.
00:11:52.570 - 00:12:18.298, Speaker C: Yeah, so you could kind of. There's no, like, real fair way to do this. You're going to screw someone no matter what. What you could do, though, is all the Ethan. The bonding curve, I guess you could just, like, adjust it a fixed price and let everyone redeem at that price. Obviously, the late buyers would still lose, like, 75% or so of the value they paid, but that way you also don't create, like, a rush for the exit or whatever. But that's.
00:12:18.298 - 00:12:44.896, Speaker C: Yeah, like, that's the biggest thing for me. Like, when I thought about doing this, I haven't joined it yet. I haven't not joined it because of, like, legal reasons or anything. Like, so many people are on this now that. I don't know about that, but the biggest thing for me is, like, I'm gonna get bored of this at some point, and what do I do now? I have all these people holding, like, these keys of me or whatever. And how do I. Yeah, it feels like an obligation.
00:12:44.896 - 00:13:04.782, Speaker C: Right. And obviously, for people who join you, like, narcissists, like, it doesn't really matter. They'll just leave and it's. Everything's fine. But for a lot of people, I think that they actually care about, like, the ability to exit gracefully, in a sense. And you can't. You can't, like, really do that at this stage.
00:13:04.782 - 00:13:27.932, Speaker C: Right. So that's what I think is kind of the big. So those are the two biggest flaws. Two biggest flaws, I think, is that the income is all on trading fees, which you can definitely kind of change that. Like, a few people have brought up the ability. You could like stake the ETH in the bonding curve and then, like, the yield goes to the crater. That's like more that in.
00:13:27.932 - 00:13:33.964, Speaker C: Like, if you do that, then you're not sensitive ice for trading volume as much. But it would be that.
00:13:34.004 - 00:13:37.140, Speaker D: Think about the math on that. It's like, it's pennies, right?
00:13:37.252 - 00:13:41.732, Speaker C: You still would make way more in trading fees. Yeah. So that's. Yeah, that's the thing. Right?
00:13:41.908 - 00:14:00.490, Speaker B: So, but zooming out a little center, like, what is the like? What's the like? Is there a real breakthrough here? Because to me, from like an outside of view who hasn't tried it yet is just like, feels very much like NFTs where a lot of these collections are really expensive relative to, like, the utility or value you're getting.
00:14:00.562 - 00:14:02.370, Speaker D: I think it's an access thing, too.
00:14:02.442 - 00:14:02.762, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:02.818 - 00:14:03.138, Speaker B: You know?
00:14:03.186 - 00:14:30.510, Speaker C: Yeah. Think about someone who is like a really profound writer and they have like a paid substack or something. They charge like monthly yearly fees. Instead, what they could do is they can maybe like fix the price of their shares and people would deposit and they would do this yield thing. Right. And like, maybe your membership. For expensive memberships, this doesn't really work.
00:14:30.510 - 00:14:50.804, Speaker C: But if your. If your cost is like $250 to $500 a year, then it would just cause people to lock up like five to ten k ETH and they could get that back at any time. Okay. Like, the key is that they can get that back at any time. So for the subscriber, instead of actually paying, like, the $500 a year or whatever, you just put like, ethan to.
00:14:50.884 - 00:14:52.504, Speaker B: The hell are they going to do that?
00:14:53.604 - 00:14:56.628, Speaker C: Well, trying to think about, like, what the angle is to this.
00:14:56.756 - 00:15:00.316, Speaker B: And, like, three other people are going to go lock up ten grand to read.
00:15:00.380 - 00:15:08.332, Speaker C: Well, you don't lock it up. You get it back at any time. So you want to read someone's content, you don't actually have to pay. It's like the opportunity cost. You're paying with, you're not paying with.
00:15:08.388 - 00:15:13.764, Speaker B: I know, but, like, you have to generate the yield on the e. So get to leave it there for six months or whatever.
00:15:14.264 - 00:15:20.576, Speaker C: Well, no, I mean, you just like the possibility you'd have rules around. You'd have rules around, like, how often you can enter an excellent stuff.
00:15:20.680 - 00:15:23.964, Speaker B: But, yeah, that seemed like a bit of a stretch of use case.
00:15:24.304 - 00:15:53.420, Speaker D: I think the access one is a big one where it's like you can directly pay for access and the creator themselves can, you know, assuming they had the ability to modify the bonding curve, they can. I want this to be accessible, realistically by 100 to 200 people. So right now, right, the 200th share costs 2.75 each. Right. So, you know, that's a lot. And so, I mean, if you want to keep it exclusive, then it makes sense to keep it at this curve.
00:15:53.420 - 00:16:26.676, Speaker D: And then you can actually, you know, respond to people's questions because it's a limited amount. I think what helps is that there's a permanence to the conversations that are in there. So you message the person, they, they're the only ones that see your message. And usually what they'll do is like a quote of your question and then a response. But the entire history of everything the creator is posted in there stays. So if you're buying, you at least get access to the historical information. But I could see like the OnlyFans element once they add photos being a big one.
00:16:26.676 - 00:16:31.584, Speaker D: But at the same time, it's just like so expensive relative to traditional onlyfans.
00:16:31.884 - 00:17:02.714, Speaker A: I think the idea is cool though. It's also like kind of captures something that nfts did where it's like, it's hard to set a fixed price for certain things. Right. Like, and that includes like your time and like access to you. Like, and there's been a lot of models like this. Like, I think this is like one of, one of those startup ideas that a lot of people have tried. Just like being able to book an hour with someone's time, right? Some famous person's time and they set a fixed price, then you can book through this platform and it kind of just happens, but it's like never taken off.
00:17:02.714 - 00:17:40.823, Speaker A: And I think pricing is like kind of an issue. Like, you know, actually pricing an hour of your time. And I feel like with stuff like this, it actually just captures in some way like the value both of the time and speculative value of like future of this person's time. Especially if you can end up putting like more cash flows through it, like ad subscription revenue or something like that. But I don't know how all that like plays out. I mean, my experience with this thing was I logged on, uh, like, uh, some random people bought my shares, then I, then I, the buts, and then I bought like some of my shares and then they dumped on me and I lost like, I mean, thousand bucks.
00:17:41.323 - 00:18:04.332, Speaker C: So to your point though, like you can keep that speculative. Like, obviously the reason why this took off because people want to speculate on it. Right. And you can kind of keep that with your idea of like, selling your time and things like that. But I think the difference is when you're explicitly, like, selling your time and then those are consumed, that there's not this need to like, maintain a price or something.
00:18:04.388 - 00:18:05.196, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:18:05.300 - 00:18:29.820, Speaker C: Because you're selling stuff that is going to be consumed at some point. And so people can still, if someone famous comes in, people can still like speculate on like buying those, whatever, whatever. Like the person decides, it's like an hour of time. It's like one question. Whatever. People can still speculate on that, but at the end of the day, like, those are still going to be consumed and like burned. And so there's no need to, like, maintain it in perpetuity.
00:18:29.820 - 00:19:11.264, Speaker C: And that's the thing with this thing, is that you have to, it's like implied that you have to maintain this price in like, perpetuity, basically, unless everybody just leaves, right? So if one person with a high share price, now this is where it gets, this is where it's going to get kind of like contentious, I guess. One person with a high share price doesn't want to do this anymore. They can, like, leave, I guess, but they're also gonna get like shit on a lot versus if everybody, if the whole thing kind of just like tails off and nobody threads. There's like, no, there's no blame, right. Because now everybody's just kind of like tailed off in it and it's all good.
00:19:11.304 - 00:19:26.884, Speaker B: But, but I still feel like we're not really getting to, like, why is this better than like a paid group or onlyfans? Or is this just making it easier to do? Like, why is this better than launching an NFT collection or having an onlyfans or having a paid group? Like, I really don't get why.
00:19:26.964 - 00:20:01.324, Speaker C: I think the onboarding was cool. The onboarding's cool. Cause you flake social wallet, which I think is gonna be a way bigger thing moving forward. So it's a big thing for, like normal people who don't wanna deal with like private key c phrases, all that stuff. You just sign up with like a phone number or a Google account or an Apple account and then it creates this like, NPC wallet for you. So that aspect is very cool. They also, like, bypass the Apple store so you actually just install it like through your browser so that like bypass the apple tax and everything.
00:20:01.404 - 00:20:30.484, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that ux pattern is going to be like a bunch of people are going to start using that now. Yeah, it was pretty smooth. But I don't think onlyfans and like, our Patreon or whatever are like the right comparables, though. You're not just paying for their time, you're like speculating on the future value of their time. And that's like both a bug, right? In the sense that setters says, like, it's not clean. You're not just paying for like a service which is like, well defined. Well, as well defined as onlyfans can be.
00:20:30.484 - 00:20:50.834, Speaker A: And then you get, like your value out of it. You're actually, it's actually like this amorphous thing where you can't really ever exit. It's unclear what the expectations are and stuff, but that is also the beauty of it. Right. Some people you'll buy and they'll, and they'll end up doing a lot of stuff, putting a lot of revenue through it, I imagine, whereas others won't. I think that's part of the, part of the bet here.
00:20:51.134 - 00:21:26.734, Speaker D: Yeah. The unfortunate thing is it's like the individual who actually, like, there's a built in incentive to eventually, like, send a message to your group saying, I'm done with this. Because you're better off having everyone sell it down to zero than actually keep your price high from like, purely selfish creator perspective because you're getting fees on volume. It's just unfortunate that you can't really tweak this once it's live because of the financial implications. Like, there could have been a play version of this done first with, and then like a real one.
00:21:26.774 - 00:21:36.580, Speaker B: But yeah, if it costs to over like three ETH or something to join at 250 people, then this is going nowhere.
00:21:36.692 - 00:21:40.964, Speaker D: No, but it would make sense if, like, if you were like, that curve.
00:21:41.004 - 00:21:43.740, Speaker A: Makes sense for like Sokka and Kobe or something.
00:21:43.932 - 00:22:30.974, Speaker D: Or like you're just like some, you know, some big celebrity and you wanted to do a few IRL events and you say, you know, the shares, the price of the share should have started high and then, and then continue to get higher and you can do like IRL events from some of the biggest fans and, you know, you have to prove that you, that you own this to go and stuff like that. I think there's elements there. But again, it boils down to having like customization around the curve rather than kind of having a one size fits all. I saw one idea on Twitter, somebody basically combining pendle with this and separating YT and PT kind of shares. It's like one get the access to the channel and the other allow for speculative. A speculation on the price.
00:22:32.074 - 00:22:32.426, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:32.450 - 00:22:35.738, Speaker B: Like, how long has it been happening for? Like a week?
00:22:35.906 - 00:22:56.734, Speaker C: Just over a week. I think it was like the eleven, but no, like, I think the right model has a stable part and a speculative part to, like on that. And I'm not saying the pendle models like the right one, but I do think that you have to have the main. The main model needs to be somewhat stable and then you can allow this side event of speculation that maybe has to do with things you consume. Right?
00:22:57.484 - 00:23:41.024, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm trying to think how this would work with something like, you know, the ad model. Like, something like Instagram. Like, let's say you thought this person was getting really famous and you, like, bought their Instagram shares or whatever and then got, like, a percentage of, like, the ad revenue they generate from, like, people, like, scrolling through their posts. Like, that could be interesting on the speculative side, but you need to, like, onboard a lot of users in order to do that and feel like, you know, that we're probably still pretty far away. Like, it'd be cool if you did this, like, on Twitter, right? Like, if you could buy shares in someone and then see, like, people are starting to earn ad revenue now. Like, that seems like it has a bit more of a path to, like, making sense.
00:23:41.924 - 00:24:13.644, Speaker D: I think, like, gating purchases, there should have been some form of gating purchases based on, like, owning a Twitter account because, you know, this thing just got bought endlessly. So either that and. Or adding in, like, the ability to only maybe buy one share to reduce just, like, blatant speculation at the expense of adoption. But, like, you know, if you have bots just buying up so many shares, it becomes prohibitive and a bit frustrating for people who are just like, I showed up, you know, a week late and now I have to pay way more.
00:24:14.264 - 00:24:18.740, Speaker C: People don't want to buy that either because they see that bots are ready to dump it, too.
00:24:18.912 - 00:24:19.308, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:19.356 - 00:24:48.448, Speaker C: So it's like, people you might join and, you know, if any of us, like, join, bots would buy up some amount, right? Because we have, like, decent followings. And then so other people see that it's like, oh, you're. You're all held by bots. And it's like, if you're gonna buy, then you're like, the bot sex liquidity. These bots are made a lot on, like, everything. Everything's mev. Everything always becomes some, like, mev.
00:24:48.448 - 00:24:51.724, Speaker C: Bot searcher extraction.
00:24:52.104 - 00:25:03.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't have a great take. I mean, do we think this is gonna be, like, a flash in the pan or it's actually gonna iterate into something, into something real maybe like does anyone think it is?
00:25:03.584 - 00:25:05.008, Speaker B: I'm leaning towards flash.
00:25:05.056 - 00:25:05.856, Speaker A: You haven't even used it.
00:25:05.880 - 00:25:09.584, Speaker B: But I don't. I know why you hate it.
00:25:09.624 - 00:25:21.284, Speaker D: That's my, actually I do feel a guilt to respond to questions though in there because you have shareholders, which is, which is a feature. Like people ask them like, oh, I got an answer. Like I bought some shares.
00:25:23.224 - 00:25:26.084, Speaker A: You're answering questions. I'm now going to buy some yard shares.
00:25:26.824 - 00:25:48.784, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they, they are going to, I think they're definitely going to try and change stuff. I just don't know what that is. And if you can actually like change it to something sustainable at this point, to Yan's point without you're going to have to like kind of screw someone I guess, the golden house. Like how can you screw the least amount of people and keep it going?
00:25:48.904 - 00:25:56.896, Speaker B: I think you could keep going. If they like do the token right. Like if they time things right like they build up around the token they launch. Like that could extend it for a while.
00:25:56.920 - 00:26:10.448, Speaker C: I mean one thing I'll say is like people going, people using this because they think they're getting like an airdrop or something. Like they're probably paying way more in fees buying these shares than they're ever going to get like an airdrop and it's kind of just a direct stimulus to influencers.
00:26:10.496 - 00:26:12.724, Speaker B: Paradigm might be generous to us.
00:26:13.174 - 00:26:15.414, Speaker C: Yeah, paradigm does back some big token.
00:26:15.454 - 00:26:19.550, Speaker A: Airdrops so I think the next thing we're going to talk about and yeah.
00:26:19.582 - 00:26:35.474, Speaker D: Before that, sorry because like the treasury is amounted a pretty decent amount of ETH already. Right so like the protocol itself obviously there's inflated volumes right now in the beginning but yeah it does generate a pretty material amount of fees so I think like as a result the token would be valuable.
00:26:36.414 - 00:26:37.246, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:37.350 - 00:26:43.406, Speaker C: They can also do something with the treasury to try and like fix it. Maybe they had like some center is.
00:26:43.430 - 00:26:45.838, Speaker B: Obsessed with his 3% yield.
00:26:46.006 - 00:26:57.486, Speaker C: Maybe they have, maybe they like start creating like some floor price or something. I don't know they can but they have like a pretty big treasury they can maybe try and do something with that instead of keeping it.
00:26:57.630 - 00:27:04.074, Speaker A: There's also a lot of innovation can be built around the primitive, right. There's already someone that's built that dope front end. What's that called?
00:27:04.734 - 00:27:05.558, Speaker D: Friend Max.
00:27:05.646 - 00:27:08.920, Speaker A: Yeah, and like people of people have.
00:27:08.992 - 00:27:15.456, Speaker B: Wait, what is it? Is it like a bit max front end or. Yeah, like in the Bitmax UI and.
00:27:15.480 - 00:27:33.440, Speaker A: Someone did a index perp as well for like the top ten or top 20, whatever. There's some drama that they changed it overnight. But yeah, there's going to be some cool stuff built on top of this. Just given how much attention it's grabbed. It's also kind of a testament to how. How dead stuff is that kind of. This is like.
00:27:33.592 - 00:27:39.688, Speaker B: Yes, I was just about to say that. I was like, fucking everyone's talking about this for the past eight days because we have nothing to do.
00:27:39.736 - 00:27:58.708, Speaker D: I don't know. At the same time, though, like, when bitcloud came out, which, you know, that was during bull and high volatility, and there was still a lot of attention that went to that. Despite knowing that, like, the investors had massive pre mines and it was so ruggy. I think it's just like, different.
00:27:58.836 - 00:28:23.134, Speaker C: Yeah. One thing I want to say on this is, like, the things I do like, that they did is that they didn't do that massive pre mine thing. They also made people opt in instead of just automatically training people, which is something that bitclo did, which is also kind of, like, scummy. So I do think they've made, like, some decent improvements in that aspect. Yeah.
00:28:23.324 - 00:28:25.842, Speaker B: So what about the fact that it was launched on base?
00:28:25.898 - 00:28:26.706, Speaker A: Yeah, that's where I was.
00:28:26.730 - 00:28:27.834, Speaker C: What do you think about base?
00:28:27.914 - 00:28:34.134, Speaker A: That's where I was headed to. What do you think, ceteris? I guess you have your take on this.
00:28:35.514 - 00:29:06.424, Speaker C: No, I mean, right now it kind of just feels like there's this big, like, evm roll up farm, farming season. People kind of just hopping around trying to, like, find, like, the new. The new primitives. I mean, base. Base had kind of a very shocking amount of rugs that I was not really expecting when it was announced. So that's kind of the what I see. Right, but, but good.
00:29:06.424 - 00:29:46.792, Speaker C: But what's good with this? What's good with this app is that every single, like, evml two has the same. Basically the same stuff, like, I guess, arbitrary me a GMX, which is different optimism. You kind of have like, some synthetic stuff. Right? But for the most part, you're creating this roll up, you're making a borrow, you're making an amm, you're making like a stable coin or something, and you're always just recreating the same copy pasta like, farm primitives over and over again. And so this app has been truly differentiated. It's brought in people from outside, just people using, like, roll ups and everything. And so that is what I think is like.
00:29:46.928 - 00:30:00.774, Speaker A: And there's no airdrop, right? There's no, like, well, friend tech might have one, but, like, base itself has no airdrop, and I think it's already flippant, like, arbitrum and pretty much every other l two on, like, transaction count and stuff like that, which is pretty impressive.
00:30:01.474 - 00:30:05.574, Speaker D: Yeah, but how much? That's, like, just. Yeah, friend tech bots.
00:30:06.394 - 00:30:10.506, Speaker A: I mean, bald did some damage, too, before SBF went to jail.
00:30:10.650 - 00:30:12.802, Speaker D: It bolts back to seven and a half mil.
00:30:12.978 - 00:30:17.764, Speaker A: Seven and a half mil. Oh, damn. Why did he get 100?
00:30:19.534 - 00:30:23.182, Speaker D: No, yeah, yeah. I think it got, like, you got it over under.
00:30:23.238 - 00:30:24.994, Speaker C: I'm pretty sure you got really close.
00:30:25.974 - 00:30:27.934, Speaker D: I don't know why Dex tools are showing.
00:30:27.974 - 00:30:42.526, Speaker C: One thing is that there's been a trend of, like, these devs with are not even devs, just people who are deploying stuff who have gone traction, and then they're rugging pretty quickly, even though they've gone traction with it, which is.
00:30:42.630 - 00:30:43.454, Speaker D: Bullet was.
00:30:43.494 - 00:30:44.950, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, that thing was.
00:30:45.022 - 00:30:46.118, Speaker D: That was surprising.
00:30:46.286 - 00:30:48.998, Speaker C: So the bald one, I was.
00:30:49.086 - 00:30:51.118, Speaker B: I was very surprised by.
00:30:51.286 - 00:30:56.590, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like, I also just don't. I mean, if your eventual goal is to rug, why do it so early?
00:30:56.742 - 00:30:59.366, Speaker B: I want. They probably made a lot on that.
00:30:59.470 - 00:31:03.774, Speaker C: But it's like, it was a successful thing. It's. It's like, just let it. Let it live. Like.
00:31:03.934 - 00:31:06.182, Speaker B: But it's a meme coin. It's like how, like.
00:31:06.278 - 00:31:21.538, Speaker D: No, no, bullet was the. Was, like, the. You played russian roulette and those burned based on the gameplay, and it was, like, growing users, growing volume. It just, like, didn't make sense. Like, even if your ultimate goal was to rug, this isn't when you do it. When you do. And, like, it's slowing down or something.
00:31:21.538 - 00:31:22.354, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:31:22.474 - 00:31:44.662, Speaker C: Yeah, I think people were putting in, like, ten K clips to play this game, so. Yeah, like, outside of the meme coins or rugs, I think with base, too, there were, like, a few exit scams and then a few exploits too. Like, I think every early Dex is, like, already gone. Yeah.
00:31:44.798 - 00:31:48.594, Speaker A: I thought sushi was going to launch there. Surely sushi won't get exploited.
00:31:49.094 - 00:31:54.998, Speaker D: Why do you think there were so many scams that launched on base that didn't do this on artism?
00:31:55.166 - 00:31:57.974, Speaker C: I think they just, I guess, took advantage of the hype.
00:31:58.054 - 00:32:08.564, Speaker D: I think one thing was. Was, like, the one way bridge was, like, initial reason, because everyone just tossed the money over there, thinking, you know, maybe I'll get this back eventually.
00:32:08.724 - 00:32:52.414, Speaker C: Also, everybody wants to be early. Right. That's, like, one of the main investment thesis, using any chain or any ecosystem is you want to be early, and you can't do that on optimism or arbitrum anymore. So you have the prime opportunity to kind of, like, take advantage of people. Right? Because all this money is going to come in, like, right at the start. And this is like, if you want a rug, as these people did, like, that is when you're, I guess, gonna do it, like, ball that ball coin. People really thought it was, like, a serious meme coin that was gonna go to, like, unironically, like, a billion.
00:32:54.954 - 00:33:06.306, Speaker D: I think they had, like, decent ev as a bet because, like, you know, meme coin native to a chain. And you always had, like, you know, DJ and Spartan and others drifting around, like, you know, the investor.
00:33:06.330 - 00:33:08.586, Speaker A: Tell me you got rugged. Without telling me you got rugged.
00:33:08.650 - 00:33:14.414, Speaker D: Oh, dude, I bought everything on. On base. And got rugged.
00:33:15.074 - 00:33:30.334, Speaker B: No, because it was funny. Because, like, it all happened over the weekend, right? Yeah, it all happened over the weekend. So I like to look at my phone Sunday night, I'm like, I missed this. And then, like, the next day, it was rugged. I'm like, okay, didn't miss anything. Back to usual.
00:33:31.074 - 00:34:07.364, Speaker C: But I mean, to their credit, like, I think a lot of. A lot of liquidity has stayed there. Friendk, obviously has done lots of. It will. I mean, it'll be interesting to see what kind of the activity on the other l two s does and, like, how much cannibalizing is this versus new users. And I know we've seen, like, arbitrament optimism transactions tick down a bit over the last week. Not to the point that it's like everyone is just moving over to base, but there is some of that effect.
00:34:07.364 - 00:34:29.468, Speaker C: And I think base is planning on. I think when they launched base, it was like, 10% of the revenue from the sequencer is going to go to op token holders. Then they quickly. They quickly, like, Ninja edited that to just say some. Some fee share amount. Yeah, so, bibs, I don't know what. Yeah, so, like, I don't know what the exact is, but if they.
00:34:29.468 - 00:34:38.972, Speaker C: If they're only giving 10% back to op, and then they take a bunch of optimism users, it's still, like, a good showcase for the. For the op stack.
00:34:39.108 - 00:34:43.626, Speaker B: Yawn. What a bridge do you use to get on base? Like, back and forth for it?
00:34:43.730 - 00:34:49.054, Speaker D: I use that, like, one way address that you just blindly send and then over there.
00:34:50.194 - 00:34:51.818, Speaker B: You haven't withdrawn yet?
00:34:51.986 - 00:34:55.374, Speaker D: No, I've written off what I sent over.
00:34:55.674 - 00:35:05.522, Speaker C: At least you didn't deposit to the Shiba. Shiba ran. Yeah, whatever. The shiba. L two. Is that like 2 million ETH gone right away, I guess.
00:35:05.578 - 00:35:40.420, Speaker A: What do you think? Like, what do you think the success of l two is generally, but, like, based specifically where people are kind of willing to ape in, you know, mid eight figures, nearly nine figures on a. On a, like, no Ui bridge. And like, meanwhile, all l one s and Cosmos chains are like, grinding their hardest to try and get people to deposit, like, even a couple million in TVL on, on launch day. Like, is it that people. Is it this, like, ETH, like, ETH align thing? People want to be ETH aligned? I'm kind of skeptical of that. Or is it. Is it metamask? Is it like the dress format?
00:35:40.602 - 00:36:02.064, Speaker C: I think it's metamask and it's being early to the copy pastas. You know, the playbook. Every time anyone else who launches, you're gonna have the lending, they're gonna have this, they're gonna have that. Like, being early is like a big part of it. And you know the play. People know the playbook and you get that, like, a lot of liquidity is gonna, like the declining roller coaster, though.
00:36:02.104 - 00:36:08.460, Speaker D: It's like, everyone knows the playbook, so it's like last shorter and shorter. And at a certain point it's like very short lived.
00:36:08.492 - 00:36:33.012, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think, like, one very, like, obviously the super differentiating thing about base is, like, you're gonna hope that if there's a bull market or just they make it really easy to, like, onboard people who just like, they can only figure out how to like, download Coinbase as an app and then, like, all of a sudden the UI is like, in their app and it's like super easy to do things and like, that is honestly like a massive distribution channel that, like.
00:36:33.148 - 00:36:53.420, Speaker C: I mean, yes, I don't see why you can't like, actually just allow people to like, just be in their Coinbase account. Like, for it is considered, like GMX was anime. Coinbase wouldn't allow people probably to use GMX. Yeah, through Coinbase. But, like, you could literally use the Coinbase centralized exchange UI and just use the apps in the back.
00:36:53.572 - 00:36:55.388, Speaker B: Yeah, you wouldn't even have to.
00:36:55.436 - 00:37:10.624, Speaker D: Or the user numbers for like, Coinbase retail versus metamask at like, at peak hype because, you know, base, it's Coinbase, but you know, Coinbase skews us. So whereas metamask on its own, it's everyone so curious to.
00:37:10.704 - 00:37:14.688, Speaker B: Yeah, I have like, a user, like.
00:37:14.736 - 00:37:22.644, Speaker C: Something I know metamask claimed like 30 million users at the peak. I don't know.
00:37:22.984 - 00:37:23.800, Speaker B: This could be wrong.
00:37:23.832 - 00:37:24.160, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:37:24.192 - 00:37:32.684, Speaker B: Coinbase at 108 million users in 2020 to. That's a third of the US. That's like pretty insane.
00:37:34.904 - 00:37:51.608, Speaker D: Yeah. Question is, today, like a lot. I mean, why. Why would they move to. Okay, to base if they, if they, if there's an app that's compelling or to get coins that aren't on me? So I gotta imagine a majority of those Coinbase users are just staying on Coinbase because what are they, what are.
00:37:51.616 - 00:38:01.898, Speaker A: They even doing on Coinbase? Like, what are these 108 million people suspicious of? How many of these are active? Like, cuz Cardano, what are you doing there? Just, just like buying Cardano and. Or whatever, like using.
00:38:01.946 - 00:38:24.870, Speaker C: There's like totally another world of people that honestly they make Coinbase accounts, they buy like, XRP Cardano and like, that's all they use Coinbase for. It's like completely different world of people. I know this because I know people that are like this. Yeah, it's just, it's like totally just. It's just such a different world from everything we do and we deal with.
00:38:24.902 - 00:38:41.470, Speaker B: And we look at nobody think the average spend is probably like, like less than $50 sort of thing. It's like, just like when this bitcoin is like blowing up and it's on the news and like everyone's talking about it. Less than 50 probably for like a lot of these people, like think about.
00:38:41.502 - 00:38:42.726, Speaker C: How many people just like hear about.
00:38:42.750 - 00:38:48.832, Speaker B: Bitcoin and then they go in and put in like $20. Like, you know, everyone, like they must have these stats.
00:38:48.888 - 00:38:51.168, Speaker D: You're spending like $10 to wire the money.
00:38:51.256 - 00:39:07.784, Speaker B: So then, you know, you don't need it. You can play with debit card. They charge you a cheap 4% fee to pay with debit card. Yeah, we can do average or median. Like what's the best? Yeah, how many? Median. Median. Coinbase.
00:39:07.824 - 00:39:39.560, Speaker C: But I mean, so one thing, just back to the original point, like, I think one of the reasons people are comfortable to put a lot of money into this I'll do is just because Coinbase is not like going away. Well, probably not. We'll see. But they're like comfortable that they're going to. Their whole marketing team, their whole BD team is going to do their best to create like useful applications there. And being early on the chain is like going to be rewarding. And somehow I don't think they're ever going to drop like a token or anything.
00:39:39.560 - 00:39:44.486, Speaker C: That doesn't make any sense. Like, it doesn't work with that.
00:39:44.630 - 00:39:55.702, Speaker B: The average Coinbase user more. Slightly more than $5,000. But that's like kind of super high. Where's median?
00:39:55.838 - 00:40:00.314, Speaker C: I'd be surprised if the medians over a $1,000. Yeah, especially now.
00:40:02.694 - 00:40:12.514, Speaker A: Okay, and so you think that you guys think the main reason is metamask. Like, if another chain supported metamask and gave you the feeling of being early, they'd also be able to attract users.
00:40:12.634 - 00:40:14.174, Speaker C: I don't even know. I mean.
00:40:14.554 - 00:40:15.354, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:15.514 - 00:40:38.676, Speaker C: Yeah. It's just easy. Yeah. Like, even if you think about to like 2022, near the tail end of the bull, like Aurora got a ton of like interest and a ton of farming going on there. And it wasn't built on Ethereum, it was just a bridge from ethereum to near. Right. And Aurora was actually wasn't an l two or anything.
00:40:38.676 - 00:41:10.560, Speaker C: It was a smart contract on near, but it was EVM. And they had like 300, 400 mil Tvl, like, pretty quickly. And then it was super incentivized and now it's. But that's what I'm saying. Like, people kind of like go and they farm and like, they pillage these lands, right. And then what's it's like, important to see like, arbitrum and optimism have both done a pretty good job of keeping users, right. Whereas, like, no other l two has really done that yet.
00:41:10.672 - 00:41:21.724, Speaker B: Jose. The only thing good enough is metamask, or 20% yield on unstable ones. The only thing that's going to dry.
00:41:22.944 - 00:41:39.082, Speaker C: I think people also, people also like to use, like, ETH. People like to use ETH has money. So good. A good debate is like, is the bull case for ETH that you have all these roll ups and people want to use ETH as the main monetary unit on all these chains? Or is it that all these roll.
00:41:39.098 - 00:41:50.338, Speaker B: Ups, the chain you log on to synapse calm and you fucking bridge it over. It's there, it's. You're good to go. They give you a little bit gas.
00:41:50.386 - 00:41:57.462, Speaker C: I mean, but it's not, but it bridging everywhere is like, bridging to a lot of places is not really that difficult. It's just the fact of going and down.
00:41:57.518 - 00:42:01.634, Speaker B: Yeah, it's also I don't want to get anyone scammed. It's synapse protocol. Calm.
00:42:04.254 - 00:42:04.854, Speaker C: Just go.
00:42:04.894 - 00:42:05.974, Speaker B: Gonna add your.
00:42:06.094 - 00:42:08.638, Speaker A: Do you not have a ref link you want to show?
00:42:08.806 - 00:42:13.494, Speaker B: No ref link. But I don't want, like someone to type in snaps.com and get fished. So just go.
00:42:13.574 - 00:42:24.848, Speaker A: Yeah, but you just also think experiences is bad. Right? Like, often you'll bridge and then you don't have, like, the gas token or whatever, or you bridge the thing that doesn't have liquidity and you can't get out of it on the other end.
00:42:24.936 - 00:42:25.360, Speaker D: It's.
00:42:25.432 - 00:42:25.880, Speaker A: It's.
00:42:25.952 - 00:42:29.884, Speaker B: It's just like talking about bridges that aren't synapse or, like.
00:42:30.304 - 00:42:33.568, Speaker D: No, just going to new chains where you're using a different guest.
00:42:33.656 - 00:42:35.272, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:35.408 - 00:43:08.500, Speaker C: Think about. Think about Kanto, too, right? Kanto got last year and I was tracking this pretty closely to kind of see if, like, where these users were coming from. And it was literally all from Ethereum. Right. There was no IBC volume between Kanto and the other cosmos chains. It was all done through, like, EVM bridges. And then as Kanto kind of, like, died down, none of those users stuck around and, like, actually used different cosmos chains.
00:43:08.500 - 00:43:10.560, Speaker C: They all just came back to what.
00:43:10.592 - 00:43:16.096, Speaker B: Percent stable market cap? Like, is USDC? Like, what percentage of USDC?
00:43:16.280 - 00:43:17.524, Speaker D: It's all on Tron.
00:43:19.024 - 00:43:19.568, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:19.656 - 00:43:21.164, Speaker A: Tether's all in Tron. Yeah.
00:43:21.664 - 00:43:29.136, Speaker B: But it's not an EVM. Is there even, like, a little bit that's not EVM? I think it's like, either, like, the people who still have money left.
00:43:29.240 - 00:43:43.782, Speaker C: So Solana is the biggest at 1.1.5 billion Solana, that's the biggest non EVM. But Solana is also really the only, like, non EVM chain for the most part, besides the cosmos.
00:43:43.878 - 00:43:45.774, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like this is the user point of view.
00:43:45.814 - 00:43:46.006, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:46.030 - 00:44:07.082, Speaker B: Like, just Metamask is just really the gatekeeper and then. But, like, Jose, like, what about. Because you guys obviously really big fans of Cosmos, like, do you think that he'll attract more developers in, like, five years from now or, like, just because the language is better like this? I don't know what I'm talking about. About, but just curious on why.
00:44:07.138 - 00:44:38.054, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think app chains in general will be attractive to developers. I think there's a bunch of use cases that require, like, customization at the chain level or where you want to, like, own your own block space and specialty customization app chains are, like, the best solution for that. I think Cosmos SDK specifically is kind of, like, there is no second best in terms of deploying your own chain and customizing stuff. Owning your own block space. There is a second best.
00:44:39.114 - 00:44:42.654, Speaker B: Yeah. Relative to playing around l two or l three or something.
00:44:43.634 - 00:45:17.494, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. It's pretty hard to. Yeah, it's actually, like, not super easy to customize an l two with up stack or whatever. It's it's like, that's a better option if all you want is to just, like, control your own block space and have your own kind of, like, environment. But I think for customization, Cosmos SDK is still best. But obviously there's, I think, a lot of intellectual and financial capital. I think the biggest risk is that ETH kind of takes the modular thesis and, like, or in the app chain thesis and, like, out executes cosmos at this point.
00:45:17.494 - 00:46:03.574, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think that, and I think another kind of thing is, like, you want to see a bunch of app chains that customize, that make customizations that are super valuable to users. I think once DyDX launches and they have this, validators can extract mev or some of the other stuff they're doing, like the in memory order book. These things kind of show the power of customization, which you haven't really seen so far. All the cosmos chains, osmosis does some cool stuff for sure, and some of the others do. But, like, it hasn't been, like, a feature that's important enough that's worth giving up. Like, the UX and liquidity benefits of Ethereum. Yeah, yeah.
00:46:03.914 - 00:46:29.460, Speaker B: Here just on DyDX is they have, like, probably the best Ux in, like, for a crypto app that I've personally used, like, definitely up there. So do you know what their plans are for bridging? Because, like, they seem to be very product for, like, focused in terms of, like, easy to use. So do you know how they're gonna, because right now it's just like, you deposit from Etherium into their smart contract.
00:46:29.492 - 00:46:30.268, Speaker C: It's gonna be similar.
00:46:30.356 - 00:46:35.460, Speaker B: You just click around. But can you. How is it gonna work on their cosmos chain?
00:46:35.612 - 00:46:38.188, Speaker A: Yeah, it's gonna be very similar. Go ahead.
00:46:38.276 - 00:46:38.904, Speaker B: From.
00:46:40.004 - 00:46:42.484, Speaker C: I mean, they're using, they're using metamask and everything still.
00:46:42.524 - 00:46:44.228, Speaker B: Yeah, you can go, how do they do that?
00:46:44.276 - 00:46:45.484, Speaker C: How can I do that?
00:46:45.524 - 00:46:47.314, Speaker B: Versus the other cosmos chains.
00:46:47.734 - 00:46:48.790, Speaker A: Injective does that too.
00:46:48.822 - 00:47:04.994, Speaker C: You can, you can, you can have any, uh, I mean, you can build cosmos chains in like, any language too. That's why you get, like, different vms for cosmos chains. Right? You have EVM chains, like utmost canto. You have cosmos and stuff. You have a gore just like JavaScript.
00:47:06.414 - 00:47:11.322, Speaker B: So they're gonna be technically EvM.
00:47:11.518 - 00:47:14.734, Speaker C: I don't actually know off the top of my head.
00:47:15.754 - 00:47:35.974, Speaker A: Do IdX? Yeah, I don't think so. Well, I think they're building it in Cosmos SDK mostly. And they're not going to have smart contracts enabled. Right. It's not like a permissionless l one. You're not going to be able to deploy contracts there. So they're mostly building it in Cosmos SDK.
00:47:35.974 - 00:48:01.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I think some of those launches, like, also kind of nemada and stuff like that, are going to kind of show the power of this a little bit more. And also, I think native USDC is going to be huge. I think metamask snap could be big, too, making that metamask integration easier. But, yeah, I'm curious. I know, ceteris, you have this take on l two s being a sovereignty play rather than scalability play. I don't know if you want to.
00:48:01.682 - 00:48:54.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's more of a sovereignty that. It's really, if you've paid attention to the narratives over the last year, it's really changed from the scalability narrative to this, like, own your own. Your own stack, create your own custom app chain, app roll up, whatever you want to call it. And that's kind of how they're getting people to come over, because right now you just have a million different general purpose EVM chains, which has a, like, pretty big critic on, like, the actual point of that doesn't make much sense to always create these general purpose chains and, like, just recreate everything. But, yeah, like, that's the whole Celestia thing, too, is, like, you want all these different gaming roll ups with their own modifications to, like, specifically allow this game to run. You don't have to worry about, like, security, anything like that. So that's the.
00:48:54.714 - 00:49:29.074, Speaker C: That's, like, the big direction I see it going in, and then I also see, like, a fragmentation of kind of, like, social consensus. If you look at the l two s now, they're all fragment. They're all getting into their own. Not just, like, liquidity is getting fragmented, but the actual show social backing, it's getting fragmented. So, like, everyone who's building rolex for ethereum, they all love, like, ETH, they love Ethereum. They're all ethereum aligned, all this. But now they're all going to their own silos of, like, the arbitrum stack, the optimism stack, the polygon stack, like, starkware.
00:49:29.074 - 00:50:18.410, Speaker C: And so now you're just, like, kind of moving down these. You're just fragmenting the social consensus more, and you're creating, like, new kind of, like, independent ecosystems. And so that's what I think will be, like, the money. The l two wars have kind of been, like, Kumbaya, and everyone's at, like, these layers, these stage zero roll ups where they're all, like, super protected training wheels. And all this, as soon as the first roll up actually launches, like, permissionless rod proofs and takes off a lot of the training wheels. Now, there's, like, a lot of pressure on the other roll ups, right? Because you got to think about it, too. Roll ups are seen as, like, an asset to Ethereum, right? Because they're, like, extending ETH asset and everything.
00:50:18.410 - 00:50:34.576, Speaker C: But roll ups can also be a liability where if you get some roll up that gets, like, let's say, in the future, some roll up has, like, 10% of ETH, and then the bridge gets exploited. Like, that's a massive decision now for the l one to make. Like, what are you going to do? What are you going to do?
00:50:34.600 - 00:50:34.736, Speaker A: Right?
00:50:34.760 - 00:51:33.162, Speaker C: You're going to fork the l one, and then you're going to have this one l two ecosystem where they're all like, no, like, we're not forking the l one for those guys. They were reckless. They didn't have proper security, all this. And then you have some people who, like, have assets on ETH in this one roll up. So there's definitely a level where, like, the amount of ETH that's in one of these roll ups kind of switches to now becoming this liability where, like, if anything happens, like, you can look at the Shiba chain, okay, obviously, you're not going to fork l one because the Shiba guys lost, like, 2 million of Ethan there. But it's a different story if it happens to one of these big roles. Right? And so, like, what's the level at where this starts to come into play and politics is going to be a massive thing? So I think, yeah, the l two wars are going to get, like, probably nastier over the next couple of years.
00:51:33.218 - 00:51:38.454, Speaker B: How many years away are we from, like, base ETH scaling? Like, base l one scaling?
00:51:38.834 - 00:51:41.134, Speaker A: I don't even think that's happening anymore, is it?
00:51:41.174 - 00:51:54.822, Speaker C: They're not really focused on it. They're going to do some dank sharding. Like, that is some data dank sharding. Like, five, probably five years out or something. They're really not focusing on the. They're really not focusing too much on the l one. They're doing.
00:51:54.822 - 00:52:24.254, Speaker C: I mean, they're doing some cool things, but, yeah, it's mostly focused on l two. And I know Vitalik is like a big, big Zk Zk ball. He thinks if you're, like, making anything today, you should build with the assumption that, like, you can prove this in a circuit, which is how they would have built the evm if they knew when they did it that, like, this would be possible in the future. So.
00:52:27.514 - 00:52:30.050, Speaker A: How does that bode for, like, all l two s or all l.
00:52:30.082 - 00:52:34.232, Speaker D: One s, rather, in your eyes, alt evml ones?
00:52:34.328 - 00:52:54.720, Speaker C: Like, I don't know. I mean, alt evml ones will actually probably be cheaper than some of the roll ups because ethereum block space is just expensive. So you could. You could actually kind of do that. I think the Ultl ones. I mean, when we talk about Alt L1s, who are we talking about?
00:52:54.752 - 00:52:56.204, Speaker A: Like, Solana.
00:52:57.964 - 00:53:26.100, Speaker C: Aptosui, which are, like, way too new to really say anything about. I think Solana is just, like, actually creating a unique, differentiated product of having the most scalable single, single layer, single single chain fastest. It's, like, makes a lot of sense. And so it's not just a copy pasta l one that, like, they're actually doing something different that has a use case.
00:53:26.172 - 00:53:28.744, Speaker D: So, yeah, I agree.
00:53:29.244 - 00:53:32.104, Speaker C: I see them as, like, a very noble.
00:53:33.404 - 00:53:54.604, Speaker A: What about Cosmos then? What are your thoughts on app chains in the world of sort of, like, Celestia and a lot of these roll up as a service things which are eventually going to become more and more customizable themselves. Is there a reason to trust these smaller validator sets, or should everything just be a roll up, like a.
00:53:55.224 - 00:54:20.868, Speaker C: Well, it depends what you want to do. It depends what you want to do. I think that. I think we could see a lot of cosmos chains instead of launching as Cosmos half chains launch as, like, celestial roll ups. And if they all share. If they all share this da layer, then they get a lot of, like, safer bridging between them, and then you can still. You can still kind of do some of your skip, like, customize block building stuff like that, um, with the.
00:54:20.868 - 00:54:50.036, Speaker C: Your own sequencer set and all that. So you can actually have a similar construction, I guess, to a Cosmos app chain today. It's just instead of having da yourself, you just outsource it to, like, Celestia. Um, and I could see that being a model. I agree with you that for appchains, it's the same thing as Solana. Like, they need to create something that is truly, like, unique and a good experience for someone to want to use it. And right now, it's mostly been create.
00:54:50.036 - 00:55:13.960, Speaker C: Creating a bunch of, like, defi primitives. And I don't know if just, like, creating a Defi defi primitive as an app chain is enough. Right. You actually need to, like, do unique things on top. So I think. I think we're seeing that more. I think there was just way too many app chains that launched too.
00:55:13.960 - 00:55:44.524, Speaker C: And with like, high staking yields and everyone like, you know, they like those high nominal staking yield and just token inflation. There's a lot of early vesting. So there's been some pretty bad, some pretty bad app chains overall in like, cosmos eco, but there's definitely some, some cool stuff. And I think Cosmos has some of the smartest people, too. Like, they're ahead of a lot of lot of trends. It's just, it seems like theorem eco seems to benefit from a lot of the ideas.
00:55:44.644 - 00:55:44.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:45.012 - 00:55:50.668, Speaker C: And like, skip, like, skip, for example, super early on, this localized Mev capture block building.
00:55:50.716 - 00:55:51.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:52.084 - 00:55:53.380, Speaker C: And you see it works.
00:55:53.452 - 00:55:54.404, Speaker A: They shipped really quickly.
00:55:54.444 - 00:55:55.084, Speaker C: It works.
00:55:55.164 - 00:56:05.562, Speaker A: But there's just no, there's just not much Mev when there's no activity is kind of the issue. Yeah, they're doing some really cool stuff. Go on, Duncan, you were smiling. What do you want to say?
00:56:05.618 - 00:56:29.130, Speaker B: Okay, well, I might be losing my mind, but I just, like, relaunched my trading view and I'm pretty sure there's like a little pop up of Elon Musk smoking the joint when I clicked on the Tesla chart, but then it disappeared really quickly. Did anyone, has anyone else seen this? I could be losing my mind, but I swear to God, it's like a little cartoon that came out in the corner and I could just be like, completely losing it.
00:56:29.202 - 00:56:31.686, Speaker C: But do I have to go to the Tesla charts for.
00:56:31.810 - 00:56:36.422, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I was just flipping through and I saw, like, I don't know, that's just like.
00:56:36.558 - 00:56:48.350, Speaker A: It was very vivid before we, we wrap up. I know. Did you. We discussed like some macro stuff. Jan Duncan, I was trading view just.
00:56:48.382 - 00:56:50.246, Speaker B: Just to get the prices ready for everyone.
00:56:50.390 - 00:57:00.806, Speaker A: All right, nice. Gone then. You've been, you were, you've had some remarkably good timing this year. You got bearish, like a day before market drop. Go on.
00:57:00.950 - 00:57:01.446, Speaker B: Okay.
00:57:01.510 - 00:57:02.634, Speaker A: Take a victory lap.
00:57:03.214 - 00:57:36.544, Speaker B: Well, I think the initial message I sent into, like, we have a hundred person group chat. And basically it was the day where. So during June and July, like, s and P was just making new highs every day and bitcoin was just like, had that big run from the ETF news, but it just like, couldn't really seem to, like, keep up or like, not keep up. Like, obviously it has some beta there, but, like, it wasn't continuing to make new highs. And then on the day that ripple won the case. Let me try and find that day on the chart. This just takes me a second, but basically, like, ripple won the case against the SEC.
00:57:36.544 - 00:57:57.034, Speaker B: They're not a security. Woohoo. That was like August 8 or, sorry, not August 8. That was. That was July or Thursday the 13 July. And we, like, wicked up to like 32k almost. And it was just like peaky for the ETF was coming.
00:57:57.034 - 00:58:45.536, Speaker B: You know, our altcoins aren't securities like S and P is making new highs every day. And then we just, like, rolled over pretty quickly. And on July 12, like, the government had sent, like, 10,000 BTC from one of the seizures to be sold on Coinbase. But kind of since then, we've just been really weak and just kind of, like, chopping sideways, and volume has been falling off pretty aggressively, kind of lowest level since 2020. And with that kind of happening, I kind of felt like the only thing that was going to save the market is this ETF actually going through. And then as people kind of start extending their timelines on the ETF, okay, maybe it's not coming before the end of the year, maybe it's January type thing. Then I think the market's just kind of slowly bleeding.
00:58:45.536 - 00:59:41.394, Speaker B: And until there's first news on the ETF or, like, you know, grayscale makes some advances in their case to convert GBTC to BTC, then I think I'm, like, pretty kind of negative about because, like, crypto specifically, like, you just have, like, really low volumes, you know, just kind of really shitty price action. And then just more broadly on, like, the macro stuff. Like, this is where it's like, I feel way less confident because, like, you know, we're all guessing here, but I think a big risk for the second half of the year is, like, you know, higher yields on the long end of the curve, which, you know, brings down, like, tech valuations and equity valuations and, like, you know, and why I think that. Or I'm kind of rambling if people want to jump in on the crypto specific stuff, and then we can go back to, like, more macro. But I've just been feeling, like, ill when I look at the channel chart. And then we had, like, a big 10% puke.
00:59:42.494 - 01:00:29.426, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it definitely looks like. I mean, it's clear a lot of market makers and liquidity has stepped back just based on there's more liquidations. Whenever that day was a couple days ago, then we saw when FTX went down. Right. Like, this is so it's clear, like, there's a lot less liquidity. I think there's a lot of just general apathy where, you know, people are kind of holding and just, just waiting and then others are, are kind of waiting for the news. And so, like, part of what was so bullish when we were running into like the higher twenties a couple months ago was, you know, everyone, everyone knew a bunch of people that was, that were sidelined.
01:00:29.426 - 01:00:31.458, Speaker D: And so that was always like, oh, there's still a lot of people that.
01:00:31.466 - 01:00:32.106, Speaker C: I have to chase.
01:00:32.170 - 01:01:11.134, Speaker D: And so I think that was kind of what drove it quite a bit. And, yeah, like Duncan mentioned, we couldn't break through low thirties on just a mountain of good news. And like coupled that with declining volumes, you kind of just see a bleed lower. Yeah, it probably kind of gradually bleeds down. I mean, so like s and P wise or I guess like taking a step back. You know, the economy itself is still really healthy. You kind of have a disconnect where the strongest companies are still really well positioned.
01:01:11.134 - 01:01:53.988, Speaker D: Like, you know, you're looking at data in terms of how they're set up. Like 80% of long term debt in the S and P is long term fixed. Sorry, 80% of debt in the s and P is long term fixed. Half of it matures after 2030. And then in terms of like, interest costs relative to profits, like these are the lowest on a percentage basis in basically in history since, you know, going back 40, 50 years. So a lot of companies, at least the larger ones, refinanced and aren't really feeling the squeeze on. But at the same time, you do have like a step up in bankruptcies on the smaller side.
01:01:53.988 - 01:02:43.228, Speaker D: So you have less well funded companies starting to struggle. Then there's the big chart going around showing how much savings have been depleted over the past year or so. And that in particular, just based on the current trend, is going to end at the end of Q three, you start to see the general consumer tap into likely what is the most expensive form of debt, which is credit card debt. And that also gets hit the most by interest rates. And then at the same time the unpausing of student debt. That's also going to put a cash crunch on the consumer. And then at the same time you have the Atlanta fed projecting gdp in Q three.
01:02:43.228 - 01:02:45.196, Speaker D: I think it was like 5.3%, which.
01:02:45.220 - 01:03:17.042, Speaker B: Is 5%, which is nuts, silly. But yeah, back to, I guess, like the crypto specific stuff because like, we can talk about macro, but I feel like there's probably like, you know, better people to listen to on macro. But I think, like if you look at the chart on, like, if you, if you look in the chart, the bitcoin chart, I think, like I was pointing this out to yawn, like right before we had that 10% day. But you know, if you look on like March, March 9, right before the.
01:03:17.058 - 01:03:19.482, Speaker A: Bank, it was all in the charts. Duncan.
01:03:19.658 - 01:04:24.648, Speaker B: No, no, listen to this. So in March, like right before, like as the SVB and everything was going under, like bitcoin looked like it was going to zero yet again. And then we had like the BTFP facility, which obviously like massive rally, like completely news based rally, massive rally. And then same thing, like Bitcoin is rolling over pretty hard at the end of June and like, again looked like it was going back to the Shadowlands. And then we had the ETF news, which was like a massive rally. So like both of these like massive impulses up since just kind of like the recovery from FTX have been like news driven events. One of like the fed kind of like kind of pivoting, like restarting QE with the BTFP facility and then the other one was the, the ETF news, right? So I think if, you know, we're not feeling like super hot on macro and like just volumes are really like weaning out on crypto, then I think we're probably just kind of chopped to bleed until like as soon as the ETF comes, I think we're going to get like a mega candle and it's all going to be great again.
01:04:24.648 - 01:05:20.878, Speaker B: But up until that point, I don't really see what's going to take us higher. And then also like, you have just like a really low liquidity environment where there's still these like massive fdvs with seed investors and like VC's are just sitting on still like insane gains, like stuff like, you know, apdos and you know, I don't know much about the product, but what's interesting, like a $5 billion FTV with like a pretty low float and then those like big unlocks coming this year. So it's like coins like that that are just going to continue to suck a lot of liquidity out of like the already thinning liquidity in the system with volumes at lows. And then right before we had that negative 10% day, the other thing that was really concerning is bitcoin puked like 1% and then we saw a lot of majors down between five and 15% just on a very small bitcoin move. And probably not the best version, I.
01:05:20.886 - 01:05:35.808, Speaker C: Think on that point with the unlocks and stuff, it's no surprise why on chain has been coming back pretty well recently because the people that are like still around don't want to like, hold those big unlocked.
01:05:35.856 - 01:05:37.712, Speaker B: Yeah, and like, what does something, like.
01:05:37.888 - 01:05:42.564, Speaker D: It'S also not like super compelling in terms of value prop.
01:05:43.424 - 01:06:20.164, Speaker B: Yeah, and like, what does something like world coin do to liquidity when it launches at a $30 billion market cap? And like, it just, obviously it's bleeding. How much does that suck out of the system as people are just selling into that? Like, that's like a massive drain on liquidity that a lot of these alts, I feel like are going to have. And people just kind of get suckered into buying them. Just like the market, like small amount of marginal dollars or like capital is flowing into these alts that just have massive FTPs and just have a ton of sellers because their investors are up, you know, silly amounts on the seed round.
01:06:21.144 - 01:06:51.884, Speaker D: I think there's like buckets though, right? You know, you have a small bucket of people that are going to participate in those games and so by some extent, you know, the market makers that are going to be down in those positions have to hedge elsewhere. So, like, I think that's how it can impact some of the majors. I don't see that many people really shifting exposures to participate in those. So I think ideally it'll be less of an impact possible. I mean, the biggest issue right now is just there's no new money flowing in. Right. And then that's, yeah, that's the thing.
01:06:51.924 - 01:06:54.464, Speaker B: Stable coins are just down and to the right.
01:06:55.164 - 01:07:05.772, Speaker D: I think the stable coin point though is somewhat overblown if you kind of consider it relative to where the stable coin market was. Relative to market cap in like 2020.
01:07:05.828 - 01:07:06.020, Speaker A: Right.
01:07:06.052 - 01:07:21.708, Speaker D: So, like, on a relative basis, you still have a lot of room to go. So I think, you know, if you look at it in a silo, yes, the trend is bad, but on a relative basis, there's still an exorbitant amount of firepower relative to market cap compared to kind of the 2020 levels.
01:07:21.756 - 01:07:21.892, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:07:21.908 - 01:07:29.484, Speaker C: I mean, even though stable coins have been redeemed en masse, like compare stablecoin, percent of overall market cap has been like up only.
01:07:29.644 - 01:07:30.244, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:07:30.364 - 01:07:36.304, Speaker C: For last year and a half years. Yeah. I mean, Dunkin coins went down like 80%.
01:07:36.954 - 01:07:38.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess so.
01:07:38.954 - 01:07:43.986, Speaker D: Yeah. Then the other fears is us selling into no liquidity. Right.
01:07:44.010 - 01:07:47.034, Speaker B: If government is dumping into government tokens.
01:07:47.074 - 01:07:54.574, Speaker D: Yeah. Until low liquidity environment isn't great. Ideally don't wait until ETF launches.
01:07:54.954 - 01:07:58.094, Speaker B: I don't think they really care too much about their execution.
01:08:00.074 - 01:08:01.666, Speaker C: I mean, it's a lot of money.
01:08:01.690 - 01:08:03.058, Speaker D: It's a lot of money. Yeah.
01:08:03.226 - 01:08:12.332, Speaker C: There's there's a. There's a. There's some big stuff going on this week, though, right? Because we got Nvidia tomorrow and then we got Jackson hole on, like, Thursday. Those are both, like, two pretty massive market events.
01:08:12.468 - 01:08:24.984, Speaker B: So here setters, I'm sending into our chat. Yeah, your stable contract, it's been up only until, like, the start of 2023. Then it's been down a decent amount since the start of 2023.
01:08:25.684 - 01:08:29.052, Speaker C: I mean, it kind of makes sense because everything's up, like, two x. Yeah.
01:08:29.108 - 01:08:33.024, Speaker D: But the important thing is, like, relative to where it was before.
01:08:33.574 - 01:08:35.262, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
01:08:35.318 - 01:08:36.514, Speaker D: It's still elevated.
01:08:36.934 - 01:08:47.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just, like, probably bearish until ETF happens. That's probably where I'm gonna sit. Except for a select few amazing coins.
01:08:50.254 - 01:08:51.686, Speaker D: Which we'll have to buy your shares.
01:08:51.710 - 01:08:53.078, Speaker A: To find out which ones they are.
01:08:53.126 - 01:08:53.754, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:08:56.614 - 01:09:30.044, Speaker B: But I honestly think, like, just in general, if you want to talk about, like, obviously, like, not financial advice, but, you know, if you're still around, like, sticking around and, like, doing research right now, I think, like, the best thing you can be doing, it's, like, looking for, like, projects, like, on chain, like. No, I don't think you're really gonna do that. Well, just buying ETH or BTC, especially if, like, you're listening to this podcast and you're, like, this deep into the space. Like, I would go, like, a mix of, like, stables and, you know, looking for good alt. That's at least what I do, rather than, like, BTC and ETH. I just think it's pretty difficult to get any sort of edge there.
01:09:30.504 - 01:09:36.504, Speaker D: Um, yeah, yeah, it depends on your. On your. Your size, too.
01:09:36.664 - 01:09:41.064, Speaker B: Yeah, depending on your size. Uh, for sure, we can.
01:09:41.104 - 01:09:51.324, Speaker A: Oh, do you want to. Do you want to give some more? Some more? Do you want to finish up, Duncan? I mean, we'll do last. We'll do closing thoughts from everyone, and then I think wrap up because. Yeah, I think we're.
01:09:51.744 - 01:09:59.270, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't have to, like, closing thoughts on what we kind of, like. I don't have to rehash, like, whatever you want.
01:09:59.342 - 01:10:07.114, Speaker A: Macro. What. What else? Duncan can show synapse and GMX again. You know, whatever.
01:10:07.854 - 01:10:14.894, Speaker B: No, you're gonna have to buy my friends tech shares to figure it out after the box once they launch.
01:10:15.054 - 01:10:24.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't have any closing thoughts. I think that, like, friend tech is. It's nice that people at least are, like, excited about stuff. And I think even though that it's been, like, pretty.
01:10:24.894 - 01:10:39.170, Speaker B: No, but, like, this is honestly, like, a bear market dead. Everything is. It's like a friend text is like all anyone can talk about on crypto Twitter for the past week. And there's like 500 holders of, like, whatever, like the top, like share.
01:10:39.242 - 01:10:40.066, Speaker C: That's not all.
01:10:40.130 - 01:10:42.458, Speaker B: That's not all it is.
01:10:42.546 - 01:10:45.722, Speaker D: I think that's an exaggeration. Nah.
01:10:45.898 - 01:10:49.054, Speaker C: Yeah. You're just not like 50% of my timeline.
01:10:49.354 - 01:10:51.094, Speaker A: You need to upgrade your timeline.
01:10:51.594 - 01:11:04.854, Speaker C: I mean, hey, people are still doing. Some people are still doing the last, like few months. People are still doing stuff. Like, they still use the chain. They're still doing stuff on chains. Like, there's still some floor amount of, like, you know, activity that will never leave.
01:11:04.974 - 01:11:13.686, Speaker B: But, you know, the jokes were like, it's the last, like twelve. Like, people just trading against each other. I don't think it kind of feels like that's now.
01:11:13.790 - 01:11:18.794, Speaker C: And now not only they train against each other, but they're trading each other shares against each other.
01:11:19.094 - 01:11:45.564, Speaker D: But it's all like. I guess friend tech is just an example of why it's not hard to be bullish ETH in the long run. As any form of mild innovation is successful or not is more so solidifies ETH is money and everyone's denominating an e that adding to burn, adding to activity. Not nearly the same extent as some activity on Mel one.
01:11:47.414 - 01:12:17.184, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like the analogy. I forget who uses, but it's basically just like eats a massive casino and gas is the rake. And I just think, like, until there is that truly, like, transformative, like, thing that's gonna, like, change your get hunt like hundreds of million people on boarded that that's kind of like the truth of it right now. It's just like, these are really cool and accretive things for Ethan. They're gonna keep on popping up. But, like, until that happens, it does feel like that's a pretty good analogy.
01:12:18.244 - 01:12:25.948, Speaker A: All right, with that, we're gonna gonna wrap up on that bullish ETH note yourself, casino.
01:12:25.996 - 01:12:34.184, Speaker B: Like, I'm very bullish long term. It's just like, right now, it's kind of sad, which is when you should be looking for good coins and buying.
01:12:35.244 - 01:12:55.586, Speaker A: I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff being built. Like, you know, if you subscribe to the research, read any of the reports, if you see any of the stuff being built crossdale ones, there's really cool stuff being built. Like, probably more than. More than ever. Yeah. I actually think it's more depressing at peak bull when it's just like, well, depressing in a certain sense where it's just like. And this.
01:12:55.586 - 01:12:58.434, Speaker A: This might be just cope. Like the smiling mask thing.
01:12:58.474 - 01:12:59.054, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:59.514 - 01:13:00.614, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
01:13:04.514 - 01:13:26.354, Speaker A: It was depressing seeing all the, like, the amount of just, like, bullshit, though. Whereas now the people that stick around are actually doing mostly things that make sense or that could make sense. Yeah. Probably just cope. Anyway, on that note, we'll call it. Thank you very much for tuning in to the second episode of the Hive mind and see you in two weeks.
