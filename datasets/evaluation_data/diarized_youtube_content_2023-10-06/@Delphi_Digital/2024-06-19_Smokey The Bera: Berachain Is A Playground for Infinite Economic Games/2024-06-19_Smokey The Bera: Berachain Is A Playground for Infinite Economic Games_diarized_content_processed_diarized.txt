00:00:01.280 - 00:00:03.634, Speaker A: You're now plugged into the Delphi podcast.
00:00:06.094 - 00:00:15.238, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Welcome back to the Delphi podcast. I'm your host, Tommy, and today I'm joined by Smokey, the co founder of Barachain. Smokey, what's going on?
00:00:15.326 - 00:00:20.274, Speaker A: Hey, man, good to have myself here, and thanks for having me. What's going on on your end?
00:00:20.614 - 00:00:27.234, Speaker B: I've just been listening to all the barachain content, and the vibes are really good. You guys have created something really interesting here.
00:00:27.374 - 00:00:36.626, Speaker A: Thank you, man. You're too kind. I wish that all podcast hosts had the same, you know, prep scheme as you. I guess I'll make these questions even more interesting.
00:00:36.730 - 00:00:54.638, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. It's crazy, too. Cause, like, I heard the story on you guys starting with nfts and then, you know, then doing the chain, but for some reason, you've kept this level of, like, fun and excitement and, like, memes and not taking stuff too seriously. And it seems like that's actually, like a pretty solid plan. It's worked well.
00:00:54.746 - 00:01:40.428, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, man. I think that for us, as super quick context, like myself, my co founder, Papa, spent the vast majority of our first careers, or our past lives, I suppose, and much more suited up contexts like building traditional companies and working in vc and whatnot. And I think we realized that if we're going to, like, if we're going to play in a field like crypto, you know, why would you do that without having a bit of fun? I also think that we just realized very much from the beginning and from, like, the early bear chain community that the way that we won or the way that we find edge is not going to be by coming off as, like, soup chain or, like, trying to be the most buttoned up guys in the room. I don't think it leans into our personalities on one hand, nor does it lean into the strengths of our community. So I think that's always been about, you know, curating a good and authentic vibe. Right.
00:01:40.428 - 00:01:51.370, Speaker A: It's not forcing people to do x or y action. It's not playing into whatever the demands of the mob are. It's just, let's try to do right by people and also have a good time with it.
00:01:51.532 - 00:02:14.118, Speaker B: Yeah. It's such a gray, slim line, right? On one hand, you could have a community just go crazy with memes, not explain anything, and things sort of become a joke. And then on the other hand, you could foster this community that everyone's welcome in, and you got some Chad devs in the background cooking. So it's a fine line right?
00:02:14.206 - 00:02:42.308, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And I think we've seen the good and bad of that spectrum. Actually, when bear chain started or when we first started talking about it, there's a. That was like, bear chain is not real. Right? And I think that was, like, sort of like the psyop marketing meta of, like, you know, 21, 22 timeframe, perhaps. And actually, I think we went a little bit too far with it because a lot of people, like, genuinely thought that we weren't real, which is, like, pretty funny when it comes up in conversation later, but has led to a number of occasions where I'm like, no, no, no. I guess we're like, this is legitimate.
00:02:42.308 - 00:02:49.876, Speaker A: This is not just like a straight up meme. So, you know, I think that we've started air like, bro, trust me, bro.
00:02:49.900 - 00:02:50.464, Speaker B: Please.
00:02:52.164 - 00:03:04.774, Speaker A: Just one more meme, bro. Gotten more to the latter side of that spectrum, thankfully. And I think that now people are like, oh, shit. Like, you know, there's a functioning product. There's a whole bunch of teams building here. There's a lot of social proof. There's, like, a pretty welcoming community.
00:03:04.774 - 00:03:40.366, Speaker A: And I think that the other thing is, like, you know, it's really easy for a community to cross the line between welcoming and cringe. And while there's certainly times where I've been like, what the fuck, man? That's pretty cringy, I think nine out of ten times, I can say the guys keep it pretty real in that. Like, they are a unique sort of, like, crunchy feels at the right word here. It's not all, like, wag me, wag me. I love crypto. Like, you know, sure, there's certainly undertones there, but I think, like, people who've been around for a little while and who think that they. That the bear chain ecosystem strikes a pretty nice, happy medium between, like, the left and right curves.
00:03:40.366 - 00:04:09.392, Speaker A: It's like, cool. I can, you know, be sniffing glue and talking about jpegs of bears, or I can go deep on, like, you know, proof of liquidity and what that might mean for, you know, the interplay between liquidity and security at the chain level and implications for applications and stakeholder analysis and yada, yada, yada, right? So I think having a community that, like, isn't corny is something that we care about a lot as well, because I think it's so easy to, like, cross into, like, eight land, right. Or even other ecosystems I see forming right now that can, you know, that can sometimes push that a little bit further than I probably would.
00:04:09.568 - 00:04:33.192, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm totally with you. I mean, I'm excited to get into all these different points, but, you know, while we're riffing on this, it. I feel like it gets really hard to maintain that community and that vision and that vibe as you grow and decentralize. Right? Like, as you go to testnet, as you go to mainnet, like, I don't know, do you think that'll be a problem or do you think you could maintain. Yeah, totally.
00:04:33.208 - 00:05:04.354, Speaker A: No, it's tough, man. I think that, like, you know, if you look at even like, massive social apps, when I think about crypto, I really do think of it as like a social game in many senses. Like, it is a lot about, like, the connections that are formed. It's a lot about like, these mini micro spheres and microcosmic communities that are built and it's tough to scale those. I think that the only way it works is if you actually are able to have, like, you know, social nodes in a network scale as that. As that network of community scales as well. Which is to say that, like, you know, one person can only evangelize or really form meaningful relationships with so many people.
00:05:04.354 - 00:05:50.010, Speaker A: I think you need enough folks who are willing to take on that role and who are able to take on that role. And to some extent that can just be your regulars in the discord. That can be the mod team, that can be core team members. But I actually think that one of the best examples of this having happened before that I've seen was probably the chain link ecosystem, which I'm a big fan of in a group that I've got a lot of respect for in one of the OG crews to actually pull off that left curve, right curve playbook and that you started having these figures pop up and become their own minifigure heads within part of a larger ecosystem. And I think that that's really what we would ideally see and what we've actually seen in many cases so far, but just an effect that we'd hope continues to multiply. You want those names that people recognize. They're not the core team that are, you know, someone who's just in the eco but fucks with it really heavy.
00:05:50.010 - 00:05:57.346, Speaker A: And I think that is, you know, one of the most beautiful things possible. When it actually works, it also doesn't work a ton, but, like, when it does work, it's nice.
00:05:57.530 - 00:06:21.286, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. It's so hard to give, like, throw my vc hat on. Like, it's so hard to give advice to replicate what you're doing because from like a foundational level. What you have to do is create something just brutally unique. Right? Like, you're not creating a copy pasta chain. Like, you know what I mean? Like, you're giving people space to become those leaders in their respective areas. Like, there's no marketing team here.
00:06:21.286 - 00:06:32.030, Speaker B: There's no paid ads. Like, I think whenever I get those, like, web two fintech kind of vibes, where we're just going to scale this up with plat or, you know, services, I just, it just kind of checks me out a bit.
00:06:32.102 - 00:07:05.666, Speaker A: No, honestly. And, like, when you, when you look at, like, I don't know, power laws or evidence across the entire world, you've seen this as a vc as well, I'm sure, right? Like, I think in crypto that the vast majority of the, let's say, profits volumes, TvL, whatever you want to call it, from a given platform, come, at least right now from a relatively small cohort of users. Right. And if you lose connection with those users, then you've kind of shot yourself in the foot. And I do find that most of those, especially natives, tend to be pretty turned off by the classic, like, you know, pay to play and or, like, paid acquisition type work. And also, it just doesn't work very well in crypto from all the research that we've done. Right.
00:07:05.666 - 00:07:51.642, Speaker A: So I think that, like, keeping it real does have a lot of, you know, positive ev. And then I think the other side of that equation is exactly what you, what you noted at first, which is like the entire part, but there is no playbook, because every time you sort of have to reinvent the playbook when you're doing growth stuff. Right. I think that crypto is a space that is, you know, rife with forks and also one that moves incredibly quickly and with that, like, you know, novelty wears off really fast, I think. So. I've had so many people ask us about, like, oh, like, how do we do this? Or, you know, how do you pull this off? And in many cases, like, my answer has been, I'm not quite sure because I think in many cases, it's a little bit of lightning in the bottle and then just like, you know, planting the right seeds, that might lead to good outcomes along the way. But in many other cases, it's simply, you have to try something new and audacious and it could crash and burn or could work really well.
00:07:51.642 - 00:07:54.514, Speaker A: Right. And, you know, every now and then, the coin flip works in your favor.
00:07:54.594 - 00:08:09.002, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm totally with you. I, one of our portfolio companies is grass, the crypto AI project. And they sort of have a very similar vibe, right? Like killer memes, great vibes. But Chad devs on the other side, so it's just a winning, winning situation when you could find it.
00:08:09.098 - 00:08:13.378, Speaker A: Also, some Toronto boys, they've been in our office a couple of times and they're all friends.
00:08:13.506 - 00:08:22.066, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, well, so Barachain is real. Tell me about what barachain is like. Urine L1 EVM compatible. Let's just walk through the high level.
00:08:22.090 - 00:09:16.752, Speaker A: There for sure, man. So yeah, bear chain is an EVM identical l one that is built and powered by proof of liquidity, which allows users and participants in the network to turn their liquidity into security and use that to power the applications building on the chain. What that functionally means is that their flow of rewards, or the flow of incentives, if you will, on bear chain are sort of upside down from what you would typically see in a proof of stake network. In order to gain the governance and emissions rewards token of the network, which is called BGT or the bear governance token, users actually have to do the work of providing liquidity to different protocols. On Vera chain, this starts with a couple of DeFi primitives that are effectively baked into the chain. So when the chain goes live, they'll sort of be a Dex like ambient liquidity Dex, a purpose vault and a stablecoin lending platform. And over time, you know, with a full EVM environment, people will be able to deploy whatever application they want on top of it.
00:09:16.752 - 00:10:35.230, Speaker A: And validators actually function as the effectively distributors of these block rewards across contracts on the chain. So each validator has their own gauge. You can think of this like curve style where they choose to say, every time I propose or produce a block, x percent of my block word will go to this application, x percent will go to this application, x percent will go to this application, or this pool within it for that matter. And this becomes pretty exciting over time, because what it means is that for the first time, as new applications are building on the network and choosing to, you know, to deploy on bear chain, they can actually pass a governance vote to become part of that eligible set of gauges that validators can distribute emissions towards. So it really means that, you know, we're building an ecosystem that I think puts power in the hands of the applications and the users, as determined by the validators and those who provided the most liquidity or value, as we see it in tangible form, to the network. So you could be building, you know, an NFT file platform, you could be building a social platform, you could be building, you know, a delta neutral vault. And in any of those situations, you could have emissions from the chain itself being funneled towards your protocol, which I think just becomes really exciting because, you know, when we think about crypto scaling for the next ten years, let's say I think that the black pill that I've certainly taken, and I think that a lot of my friends in the builder space have taken, is that infrastructure has largely become a meme.
00:10:35.230 - 00:11:11.894, Speaker A: And it's perhaps taboo to say that as someone building an l one. But I very much think of bear chain and proof of liquidity as a whole as an accelerant for the application layer, and something that's actually meant more than anything else to drive value to applications building on the chain, such that if we think about what a world looks like in a few years, there's a chance of that moonshot, that like multibillion user protocol that actually breaks out of the crypto sphere, if you will, to have reached activation energy by having its liquidity bootstrap, its user base incentivized, et cetera, through barachain. So, yeah, man, hopefully that's helpful in some context. I just threw a bunch of words at you. There's a whole bunch of other nuance in there, but hopefully that gives us something to start with.
00:11:12.014 - 00:11:48.024, Speaker B: No, this is helpful. So I was a little confused when I first heard the thesis. Right, so let me feed it back to you, just for the listeners who might be hearing it for the first time. So basically, the way I understand it is that the only way to earn your native token is to provide liquidity to applications within barachain, right? This could be in dex, this could be a perp's vault, whatever you want. And if you're a user and you're providing liquidity, you earn some Barachain native tokens, BGT. But the percentage of tokens and the quantity is ultimately decided by the validator. So the validator set a gauge.
00:11:48.024 - 00:11:54.404, Speaker B: Tokens flow to applications, then tokens flow to users. Is that like the right mental model?
00:11:54.744 - 00:13:12.614, Speaker A: You've totally got it, man. It's like, you know, we played with the term top down liquidity, and that, you know, validators are effectively streaming those, those rewards to applications. Applications are then, you know, giving those rewards to users who actually utilize those applications. And then the metagame or the layer that becomes evident on top of that, that actually, you know, basically becomes the first time that we really see a strong degree of validator and protocol overlap or interaction beyond LST type stuff, is when applications can actually work directly with a validator on the network to incentivize liquidity for their own token or their own app. If one has seen these incentives and or bribe systems and the curve and convex ecosystems, you could think of it in a relatively similar way, or velodrome, or aerodrome for that matter, where users an application can actually say hey, instead of doing a highly dilutive liquidity mining program where I pair my token against x and then give away more of my token, I can choose to incentivize a validator with x amount of my token. And that validator can choose a direct y amount of BGT emissions towards my application or my pool, whatever I've chosen to incentivize such that users can actually be rewarded for that interaction. And what that does is it means that the application is actually subsidizing their own cost effectively and receiving BGT emissions instead of having to print more of their own token.
00:13:12.614 - 00:13:41.860, Speaker A: And on the other hand, it actually means that they're being able to distribute these tokens to validators in their delegates, et cetera. So that opens up a revenue stream for validators, and it opens up, I'd say, a new degree of game theory, a new degree of choice for users so that they can choose to work with and delegate to a validator that is helping bootstrap liquidity or bootstrap utilization for application a versus application b, which we think is also pretty cool when it comes to just solving general problems around stake centralization that we've seen rampant on both Ethereum and Cosmos chains over the last few years.
00:13:41.972 - 00:14:13.432, Speaker B: No, it is pretty cool. Like it's very fundamentally different from other l one s that I've seen or spoken with. It also sounds like you have a lot of different specific parties here, right? Like when I gave my flowchart before, like validators to applications to users for the native token. The users holding the native token then have the power in making the active decision on where they want to, I guess delegate to a validator who's making the best decisions to get them the most rewards.
00:14:13.568 - 00:15:10.810, Speaker A: You've got it, right. And that actually opens up some pretty interesting, like flag compounding purposes, right? You could have a user that's actually just like a major whale and let's say a stablecoin pool, and they could say, hey, I've got these random tokens, or I've got like, you know, these volatiles and I'd like to bribe a validator with these so I can juice more yields for my stablecoin pool because I believe that will ultimately be an easy positive trade, and I'll get more yield, you know, on my stables per amount of incentives that I gave to this validator. The more common situation that we would expect is a protocol saying, hey, I want to bootstrap my own liquidity. I'm going to give some tokens to this validator instead of doing a liquidity mining bonding program and use that to get a whole bunch of BGT emissions that people want for LP my pools. I think that there's a number of different degrees of freedom that people can operate with. And I think that goes back to the whole thesis, the tagline that actually one of our friends from Hashkee capital first threw at us, which I really loved, which is Bear chain is really a playground for infinite economic games.
00:15:10.932 - 00:15:11.430, Speaker B: I love that.
00:15:11.462 - 00:15:15.126, Speaker A: And I think the degree I do. I heard that, damn, that, banks.
00:15:15.190 - 00:15:17.834, Speaker B: It's so good. That might be the podcast title.
00:15:19.734 - 00:15:40.154, Speaker A: And it's true though, right? Like the degree of interplay between different parties here is, you know, I don't want to say unlimited, but I think there's a greater degree of freedom and interaction that we've seen in many other, if any, systems to date. And I think that's what makes it really cool, because you can, you know, choose your own adventure on bear chain. And I think that's what, you know, leads to interesting new experiments that can ultimately catch fire.
00:15:40.254 - 00:16:11.982, Speaker B: I love it. So, I mean, I'd love to talk through what this drives and what the app ecosystem on the chain looks like. Right? Like you've recreated or not recreated, you've fundamentally redesigned how applications attract incentives, how users like, earn from that, and sort of the whole lifecycle here. So, I mean, just kind of like, walk me through this. Does this lead to more applications on bear chain? Does this lead to different applications? Does this lead to a higher velocity of applications coming and going? Like, how does this.
00:16:12.038 - 00:17:06.905, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think that what it does lead to is ultimately more shots on net, in that I think that a lot of applications see the potential to actually go from, you know, zero to one on bear chain by using proof of liquidity and tapping into that is like really their nitro, right, or their turbo, whatever you want to call it. That makes it easier to take an application that's like, you know, maybe getting off the ground has a couple million TVL, a few hundred users, whatever it is, and find a way to actually like, amplify that potential. And I think that on one hand, it leads to a wider crowd of applications, but I think a lot of it comes down to almost like the cultural differentiation, if that makes sense. The ecosystem team and the foundation team is quite active in the bear chain ecosystem, and we are talking to teams on a daily, if not hourly basis, I should say. In fact, my teammates are doing real work right now while I'm yapping over here. But what that means is we actively encourage those groups that we like.
00:17:06.905 - 00:17:30.369, Speaker A: We don't try to talk to the guys who are building things we've seen ten times before. We don't care for the next aave fork. We don't care for the next uni v three fork. No offense, those boys. Of course, it's more just. It's more just like, you know, we don't want to be the place where you go and see a bunch of stuff that you've seen before, and that's that. Cool, right? I think we want Barachain to be the place where you actually go and say, holy crap, there's a whole bunch of stuff here that I've never thought of or never seen before.
00:17:30.369 - 00:18:20.022, Speaker A: And how do I start playing with this right away? So I think that what proof liquidity is meant to do is give any given application a boost. I think that it perhaps particularly favors those that have a high velocity of capital and that rely quite a lot, or have a greater dependence on some degree of massive inflows and outflows at any given point in time. So when you think about, like, sort of like, your power purpose protocol is your zero day to expiry options. Even stuff that can be in the social space that relies on, like, I'd say speedy, you know, liquidity dynamics, there's 100% ways to plug in there. There's even been designs on how you could use that to power, like a blur esque NFT marketplace powered by pol. So there's a lot of room in that design space, but I don't think it pigeonholes to a given type of apps. And then in terms of how it affects them the most, I think it just means that you actually have applications more incentivized to have skin in the game in the first place.
00:18:20.022 - 00:18:44.674, Speaker A: In terms of initially finding some way to get their users and or applications themselves contributing to the liquidity on the chain, such that they can then basically vote harder and lobby harder for their own applications to be included in those gauges over time, and be part of the groups that can receive emissions from the validator set in the chain. So I hope that makes sense at a high level in terms of, like, I don't think it reinvents the way that applications have to play, but I think it gives them an extra like lever to pull.
00:18:44.754 - 00:19:00.492, Speaker B: No, I think it's, I mean, I think it's interesting. I'm just trying to figure out live like how this changes how applications raise money and build. Right? Like it sounds like there might be less raises in the bear chain eco because they could just attract opex money from validators.
00:19:00.618 - 00:20:02.672, Speaker A: But I guess I think, sorry to interrupt that. I think what we'll see is not necessarily less raises, but more less. Like I think a lot of the rewards programs and inflation slash liquidity mining programs will be a lot more like validator incentive layer dependent, more than just hey, I'm going to spit out a whole bunch of my own tokens. I think that's probably one of the biggest things that I expect to see universally, in that in many cases it's like, okay, if I could choose between diluting my token supply and effectively receiving emissions in the form of a chain state of token, why wouldn't I err towards the latter in terms of cost of capital effectively to a protocol? So I think that we'll see a lot over there. I think that we'll still see teams raised to get off the ground per se and launch an mvp decent product. But I also do imagine that we'll see a pretty healthy LBP Ivo or ICR, whatever you want to call it type ecosystem because there will totally be a bunch of these groups that say cool, I'm going to do that. I'm going to launch my native token and then I'm going to bribe incentivize validators aggressively with my native token to get as much liquidity into my pools as possible.
00:20:02.672 - 00:20:06.752, Speaker A: I think we'll also see a fun little PvP ecosystem start to build out over there.
00:20:06.888 - 00:20:39.758, Speaker B: That's awesome. Going back to the validator side, they get tokens from the users delegating to them. They earn a clip. You also mentioned that applications can give them tokens or bribe them to direct emissions to them. I'm curious, like a couple of things here, is there any concern with the validators having to do this heavy, highly secure validation of the chain, but also making economic decisions on where to delegate to? Do you think that's hard or.
00:20:39.806 - 00:21:19.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely don't think it's easy. And I commend our validators quite a bit. And I think that we've had a pretty grueling process for them in many cases, whether that just be technical upkeep on the test nets or whether that be figuring out the whole proof of liquidity system, which is by no means means a walk in the park as of yet, and we're actively working to simplify. I think that what it does though, is it selects for active participants that are actually going to grow the ecosystem. I think that we've seen two classes of validators emerge over time. There's some that just want to set and forget, and I think that might be oversimplifying the work that they do. But in many cases there's groups that don't want to do anything beyond validating.
00:21:19.636 - 00:22:20.706, Speaker A: That's fine. And I believe that the security of a chain is absolutely important. But I also think that I've seen a lot of ghost chains where those groups are getting the vast majority of the value generated by that network and are not contributing to it in any meaningful manner. I think what bear chains validator protocol interactions allow for is actually a system where those that work the hardest and or put in the effort can really reap the rewards. Which is to say that if those validators are actively meeting the top protocols and most exciting ones in the ecosystem are finding ways to align, whether it be on these incentive deals through the marketplace, et cetera, or even finding ways that they can support them, whether that be with content or whether that be with, with more intangible type stuff, then I think that you can really have a value to win beyond what they would have in a more traditional proof of stake system, if you will. And I think that that's where it gets really exciting, because it's not just press button, get reward, it's press button, do the work and you have an opportunity to compete your way to the top. And I am very much a believer in free markets and highly competitive marketplaces, which I think this, moreover, enforces.
00:22:20.706 - 00:22:56.952, Speaker A: I do think that it means that it's a little bit tougher in some cases for the solo stakers, the solo node operators. And we're of course doing our best to figure out what else we can do there when it comes to ecosystem services or groups that want to run like effectively prime brokerages slash advisory services of this sort in the space such that perhaps some of that work could be taken off their plate. But I think to start our approaches, yep, you're going to validate the chain and you're going to have unprecedented control over what the economic landscape looks like. So we're going to hope you do your damn best. And of course, we'll be keeping a close eye on that to make sure that people aren't, you know, engaging in, in problematic behavior.
00:22:57.128 - 00:23:07.856, Speaker B: No, it's a good explanation. Right. It's definitely not easy, but it's active. Right? Like you're putting the curation of the l one in smart hands. I think you've got it right.
00:23:07.880 - 00:23:58.826, Speaker A: And I think that's like. I just think that when I've looked at a lot of the chains that I guess I would consider ghost chains nowadays, I just think it's really confusing in many cases how you can have billions, if not, you know, hundreds of millions or billions of tv all sitting in a validator set, accruing value to a party that in many cases has not actually grown the ecosystem. And of course, not all validators are made equal. But going back to that same thesis that I mentioned earlier of, like, if we want crypto to scale, we need to have applications that people want to use and actual users, I would, you know, perhaps say something that, you know, shouldn't always be said out loud, and that you need applications and users to be incentivized. And I don't think that a lot of chains do a great job of that at a mechanistic level at the moment. I think, sure, you can have your grant program and you can like throw a bunch of money at a wall and see how much of it sticks, but I don't think that that's what causes a virtuous flywheel of wins to be generated.
00:23:59.010 - 00:24:15.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we kind of, I mean, I kind of brushed over this and I didn't really ask you and I should have, but like one of the main changes with bear chain is just you're combining. Like, you don't want to make a decision on security or liquidity. Right. And I think that's a core thesis of yours.
00:24:15.402 - 00:24:17.122, Speaker A: You've got it. I think that's very much.
00:24:17.218 - 00:24:17.730, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:24:17.762 - 00:25:21.840, Speaker A: Like, I just think like one of the things that prompted our whole thought process on bear chain back when it was just an NFT project, was actually just talking to a whole bunch of users and developers that had found their way into our left curve, right curve ecosystem. I think that one of the things that we found, and this is prior to, I wouldn't say the advent of, but prior to liquid staking becoming really, really commonplace and definitely prior to eigen layer type stuff, was that users were simply finding themselves with the odd trade off of, ok, do I run a node and earn a few percent, or do I lp in a Dex or lending market or some of the sort, right. When given a given amount of capital. And I think that's like kind of illogical right? Because for a network to scale, you really do need both security and liquidity. I think, like, security has to some extent become a meme nowadays. Like, unfortunately, even though I do think it's by far incredibly important. But we've also seen so many scenarios, like I mentioned, where you have these chains with like billions secure in the network and no activity on the channel at all, that I think I understand why it's become a little bit more famine.
00:25:21.840 - 00:26:05.574, Speaker A: So I don't think you can go too far in either direction. I actually think that security and liquidity need to be fairly equally weighted, the same side, opposite sides of the same coin. So for us, the way that we think about it is why is it that those factors have to be at odds, I suppose, as opposed to why can you not generate a form of security by providing liquidity? That is really the concept of baritone as a whole. Because what is stake but economic value? I don't think that beyond perhaps the resilience of given assets, there is inherently greater stake value emanating from Ethereum than Solana or Nier or something of the sort. Right? It's ultimately the value underpinning that asset that matters. So I guess that's part of the thesis that we are indirectly getting behind.
00:26:05.874 - 00:26:21.868, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'd be kind of curious. Your take on Ethereum and how it's played out with lido and Coinbase, staked EtH and Rockapool and others is the idea that just, hey, you have all this money locked up and you can't use it for other use cases, or is that like the main contention?
00:26:21.996 - 00:27:13.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's like, I think it's right now, effectively, this form of liquid staking, per se, is opt in, right? Which is not bad in a manner, it is too unbear chain. I think it's just that the reward systems on the chain much more inherently encourage people to provide liquidity in order to really reap the benefits of the system. So I guess in a world where liquid staking was enabled by default in Ethereum or anywhere else for that matter, I think that might be a little bit different and maybe there wouldn't be as much of a need or a fit for what we're doing right now. But I guess beyond that, I'd say what we think is interesting is the ability to generalize almost any form of liquidity into security, which I don't think is even accomplishable quite in that context of liquid staking. I think that the fact that one can say, hey, I'm going to have this LP token and then that can serve as a form of security. It's pretty cool to me because it's the same thing. It's economic stake.
00:27:13.330 - 00:27:17.458, Speaker A: At the end of the day, it's just an economic stake in a slightly different form.
00:27:17.546 - 00:27:44.116, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I'm trying to think through if I was a user, not a validator, and I'm not a protocol developer, what's the best way to earn and what's the best way to optimize the Bera Eco? And it sounds like basically two flows I could delegate to a validator who has somehow convinced me that they're the best. Or I could like obviously provide, I guess, stables to like defi protocols that I'm big on or that are novel.
00:27:44.220 - 00:28:28.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's like, there's a few different game theory paths, right. I think what ultimately is intended is for users to be able to like engage in whatever behavior they would have already, but with the added benefit of being able to like, you know, stake their BGT to secure the network to, you know, generate fees from the different applications being built on the network, and to also earn incentives depending on what pools validator is incentivizing. Right. Or receiving incentives from, I should say. So, like on one hand you could totally be like, yep, I'm going to stable farm and then I'm going to like, so one strategy I could totally see people doing is like stable farm to earn some BGT and then delegate that BGT to a validator that is being incentivized by like some super wild long tail assets, right. And that way it's like cool. I kind of have my cake and eat it too.
00:28:28.186 - 00:29:17.872, Speaker A: I've got my relatively stable BGT yield for my stable pool that I'm not too worried about il on et cetera, and I'm effectively getting a call option on a whole bunch of these different assets. Or you could go the opposite route and you could say, hey, I'm going to lp in this vault, I'll pool or try out this new protocol that's spicy power crypts or something sort of exponents. And then I'm going to actually delegate to a validator that has a more stable source of effectively stable incentives. I think it means you can actually position yourself as you'd wish. That's also what I think about when it comes to the two tokens of bear chain. There's BGT, which is like the governance rewards token, which is only obtainable by providing liquidity. And there's Bera and you can only obtain Bera, the gas token of the network and the liquid token that will be listed, etcetera, by burning Bera into BGT one way.
00:29:17.872 - 00:29:32.040, Speaker A: So it actually means that you also are given basically a choice right at the start, right. It's do I hold this asset that allows me to influence rewards across network, earn fees, earn incentives, or do I speculate on the liquid token? It's really up to you.
00:29:32.232 - 00:29:37.544, Speaker B: And the burn between BGT and Vera, does that change over time like that?
00:29:37.624 - 00:30:02.574, Speaker A: It does not. It's always one to one. Okay, cool. And that's basically meant, like, actually enforce proof of liquidity, right, in that, you know, basically, if BGT, and if BGT was transferable, and I should explicitly state BGT is soul bound, non transferable, et cetera, then it would kind of defeat the purpose, because people could just, like, earn BGT without providing liquidity, and they could just buy it off each other in a marketplace, which would not be ideal, which is why that. Hence the necessity of the model.
00:30:02.654 - 00:30:18.022, Speaker B: No, no, that makes sense. So it sounds like, as a user, you could do this on hard mode or easy mode. Like, easy mode is use the apps you like and love and you'll earn BGT, or like, hard mode. Like, here's all the things I want to provide liquidity to, because x, y, and z, yeah.
00:30:18.078 - 00:30:36.246, Speaker A: You can basically just choose, like, how deep you want to go, right. You can go super deep in the rabbit hole and try out some crazy experimental apps that might have their own early stage incentives and rewards programs. You know, five layers of point lasagna or whatever you want to call it. Right. And then also a pol boost, hopefully. Right. And, you know, take a shot that way.
00:30:36.246 - 00:31:00.812, Speaker A: Or you could just say like, hey, no, I'm going to. I'm going to play this pretty safe. And of course, I think that the ones that I think will be more entertaining are the users that play super risk on and are trying all the newest applications and also getting all the wildest incentives. Because I really do think that is probably where you see the most exciting long tail outcomes. But I'm also sure we'll see a few, you know, a few different opportunities for people to get REkt. But I think that's all in the name of the game.
00:31:00.948 - 00:31:15.824, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's interesting. And I mean, the foundational asset flow of the token. I'd love to just talk through how long your token issuances is. Is this a decade? Is this longer? Because that sort of underpins a lot of the system here.
00:31:16.204 - 00:31:43.218, Speaker A: Of course, yes. The token issuance is meant to be effectively infinite because the fact is you do need block rewards for Pol to work. However, the rate of that emission is supposed to decline over time. We're discussing exact periods, but we're looking at a series of. What we're thinking of is, like, the bear happenings, such that that rewards rate would basically fall from 10% to 5% to 2.5 and so on and so forth over time. And hopefully over time, that value, that's actually being in a perfect world.
00:31:43.218 - 00:31:51.374, Speaker A: The bribe incentive flywheel is starting to generate a lot of the value on the network by itself. From that massive applications building around each other.
00:31:51.794 - 00:31:55.934, Speaker B: We have an opportunity to call this forest fires. But it's a weird.
00:31:58.154 - 00:32:00.254, Speaker A: Could go both ways. Could go both ways.
00:32:01.084 - 00:32:02.108, Speaker B: Totally could.
00:32:02.236 - 00:32:09.132, Speaker A: So I might get some. Might get some environmental concerns on that one. Yeah, we'll not be able to have the green blockchain narrative, the smokey the.
00:32:09.148 - 00:32:10.708, Speaker B: Bear memes, though, like when the having.
00:32:10.756 - 00:32:12.692, Speaker A: Come might sell themselves.
00:32:12.828 - 00:32:44.872, Speaker B: Yeah, it's so good. One concern I want to talk to you about was, like, not a one for one comparison by any means, but Bittensor has a sort of interesting model, right, where validators sort of pick the subnets that they want and those subnets earn tokens. And what I found is it's a pretty political game. It's obviously very competitive and it's expensive. But how do you ensure that this doesn't devolve into these applications? Playing straight politics with the validators? Or is that the goal?
00:32:45.048 - 00:33:20.152, Speaker A: I don't think it's the goal, but I think in many cases, it's a state that the system could tend towards. And I think that the only clear answer to that is actually, on one hand, letting a free market play out, and on the other hand, like, actually doing a good job of staying diligent on top of those different metrics and effectively, like, you know, when something seems rational, when there's. And versus when there's a clear, you know, cabal sketchy situation going on. Right. And I don't think that it's our job to be the police. I don't think it's our job to overly, you know, involve ourselves in matters of the state per se. But I also do think that if we see.
00:33:20.152 - 00:33:53.714, Speaker A: If we see threats towards decentralization, if we see groups acting in a manner that we could ultimately see threatening the network, that is ultimately our job to look at that in terms of delegations, in terms of, you know, effectively bootstrapping programs and anything that we can do to work against that effort. Right. So it's a great comparison, actually. I haven't heard many people talk about any similarities in the Tao ecosystem before. I've heard different people think about it in the context of, like, avss and groups choosing which avss they actually want to work with and so on, so forth. Like, from a node operator perspective, I think that, like, you know, there's probably some, some reasonable comps there as well. But I think that.
00:33:53.714 - 00:34:16.570, Speaker A: I think that for better or for worse, politics will always find their way in the system. But I do think that the amount of different counterparties here, in terms of a set of 256 validators at least, and hundreds of applications that we really see building on the network, should make it relatively difficult for a group like that to form too. Concretely, I think there'll be a lot of different options for people who want to take shots.
00:34:16.722 - 00:34:33.242, Speaker B: Yeah, it's always been my thesis, and it's just such an obvious thesis. The app layer or the l one that has the most shots on goal wins, and, like, you have ethereum, then you have Eigen layer, and now it seems like you're sort of influencing a similar design here, which is great to hear.
00:34:33.338 - 00:34:55.780, Speaker A: Yeah, you've got it. And I think that's exactly it. Right. Shots on that is what ultimately leads to breakout protocols. And I think that our goal in building an ecosystem is to ensure that we have as many of those landmarks, if you will, that people think of, and they're like, oh, yes, I. I associate this application with this chain, or I want to go to this chain specifically to use that application. And there's been many examples of these in the past.
00:34:55.780 - 00:35:29.494, Speaker A: Some have ended really well, some have ended not so well, like anchor and Luna. That did not necessarily end the best, but it also brought a whole bunch of people into that ecosystem while it was kicking. GMX and Arbitrum has done a great job for the ecosystem out, even maybe put pendle in that group. Despite starting on Mainnet, DFK and Harmony before the lock duo fiasco, I think we've seen so many of these landmarks, and the real key to bear a chain winning is being able to help as many of these landmarks to reach that point where they actually do become that, and they become these centerpieces or these attractions that people travel across chain to come and see.
00:35:29.874 - 00:35:46.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely super interesting. I'd like to ask you just the basic chain level questions, too. Is there any just TPS fees? We probably won't be able to figure out until you're live. But I'd love to. Maybe, maybe TPS would be helpful. So people can get chains.
00:35:46.782 - 00:36:08.182, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Look like, you know, bear chains. By no means. We're not, we're not in the parallelization race. We love the boys who are doing so and have lots of respect for what they're doing. But I think we know our arena and we stick to it. You know, like when you look at like basic transfers and stuff like 700 DP's, when you look at like more practical stuff like swaps and whatnot, it's, it's not, not super fast, it's like 50 or something like that.
00:36:08.182 - 00:36:21.484, Speaker A: So it'll definitely be an experience that like feels, we want it to feel a lot better than Mainnet. Of course, like, you know, we're looking at like sub two second block times right now, but I don't think it'll be as snappy as like, you know, the Solana like experience that we love to get to over time.
00:36:21.784 - 00:36:30.640, Speaker B: No, it's helpful because you could kind of influence like what applications should be built on the l one versus, I'm guessing, potential l two s on your chain too.
00:36:30.752 - 00:37:12.216, Speaker A: You've got it. And you know, I guess on a similar note, right, like bare chain is the first one at least that we know of and that we've seen, that's actually EvM identical. Which is to say that while we use comet BFT consensus under the hood for single slot finality, the execution environment itself is actually fully identical to the Eth two spec in that you can run any of the different execution clients, you can run nethermind, you can run ret, you can run geth, what have you, ergon, so on and so forth. And you don't have to make any modifications. We don't have to maintain a fork. So really, if there's anything, whether that be the eips, etcetera, that one has on mainnet, you'll also have that on bear chain. So, which also means that from an l two scaling ecosystem point of view, it's super easy to work with.
00:37:12.216 - 00:37:37.668, Speaker A: And we've actually already seen probably three or four different groups trying to build l two's to bear chain. Whether they be gaming focused with tons of users and transactions, consumer focused, or sort of deep, deep, low latency clean mempool trading focused as well. Then I think that opens up a whole different world of possibilities for what cross chain looks like and having entire l two s or applications on l two s incentivized by the bear chain core consensus.
00:37:37.716 - 00:37:49.604, Speaker B: Effectively that's pretty cool. Yeah, it's cool to see where this could go. I was going to ask if you foresee validators delegating to a bear chain l two anytime soon, but maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves.
00:37:49.764 - 00:38:15.136, Speaker A: No, no, but I don't think you're wrong, though. I think that's entirely a world that could exist, and I think especially for appchains, I could see that making a lot of sense. You could have some exchange where validators are effectively forwarding some portion of their sequencer fees or something of the sort towards the BGT stakers in exchange for receiving some portion of BGT emissions that could be used for incentives across the chain. So I think there's just a whole bunch of those different systems, DyDXs type stuff that could exist.
00:38:15.320 - 00:38:55.164, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that is pretty cool. Switching gears a little bit, it seems like there's maybe an undercurrent of exhaustion with the community and VC's around infra investments. I don't want to speak for ourselves or anyone in particular, but paradigm just launched a billion dollar fund and I think it's focused. There are a couple high profile chains launching like yourselves. There's blast, there's Monad, there's several others. But I'm curious, do you think that the market is ready for a new l one? Do you think they're exhausted? Or how are you feeling about that? Because you guys also raise a bunch of money. Sorry, for sure.
00:38:55.204 - 00:39:28.886, Speaker A: No, no, you're good, man. It's a great question. And honestly, look, if we came out the box as a naked l one right now, in terms of there wasn't any ecosystem, there wasn't a sort of attraction, there was just like the classic, hey, we came up with some funky new consensus and we spun out of like insert x research institution or fang here, then I think that. I think we'd be fucked. I think that'd be a horrible situation to be in. But what I can very thankfully say is that, like, I think we've done the exact opposite of that. I think we've spent the last couple of years, you know, deeply curating an application ecosystem that's quite thoughtful and has a whole bunch of interplay.
00:39:28.886 - 00:40:20.172, Speaker A: I think we've got one of the most rabid and, you know, autistic in some manner savants and others communities that one could ask for. And I think that we've got a lot of the right tailwinds to actually see innovation at the application layer, which is really what I think bear chain encourages more than anything else. Like turning liquidity into security fundamentally enables these applications to dial in more on their capital efficiency and enables that value of your set to help them get off the ground. And I think that with that, like, what's actually been most exciting recently is seeing that pigeonhole expand. Like, I think there was a point at which people sort of just thought of us as a defi chain, but now we're seeing a ton of different experiments. You know, building the bare chain ecosystem, whether that be social fi, whether that be deep in. We've got groups building effectively like deep in Nintendo switches vape to earn, which is perhaps one of the funniest things I've heard of as a non vaper prediction markets on twitch streams.
00:40:20.172 - 00:40:45.834, Speaker A: I think that the sky really is the limit, and I think that the market should be exhausted of infrastructure, but I don't think the market should be exhausted for new applications building on exciting enabling infrastructure, which is what I'd hope that we can see ourselves as. And thankfully, we're done our time on the fundraising trail now. It's just our job to do our best to help the teams that are building on the ecosystem to reach their potential and to have as great of an experience as we did.
00:40:45.914 - 00:41:02.722, Speaker B: So I have to ask, you guys announced your 100 mil fundraise, I think like a month or two months ago. And obviously congrats. You have framework Revin Howard, like incredible funds in there, really smart people. I'm curious though, like, how do you spend $100 million, the number just so high.
00:41:02.818 - 00:41:03.434, Speaker A: Not easily.
00:41:03.514 - 00:41:05.226, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:05.290 - 00:41:46.426, Speaker A: And like, look, we really try to err away from the pay to play partnerships. I think we've seen plague or perhaps work with other chains in the past. And we actually have a pretty strict no grants policy internally at Vericain as well. So the answer is, I think very sparingly, in that we try to be incredibly resilient about our team size. We try to be incredibly efficient when it comes to our spending and not just flaunting random stuff. People give a shit every now and then for having a boat in Dubai that had all four ecosystem builders, that costs a 10th of most of the things that people threw on, on like, you know, top floors of hotels and stuff. So I guess every step of the way, we think a lot about bang for a buck.
00:41:46.426 - 00:42:38.264, Speaker A: I think a lot of it comes down to payroll, of course. We want to be able to make sure the foundation and, you know, the entities that are in the bear chain ecosystem can sustain for years to come, because otherwise, the alternative, in most cases, at least from what we've seen in our proxies is just like, selling tokens, which I don't think is something that we want to do, especially post launch. And then I think that beyond that, there are definitely certain applications, certain, you know, like, strategic opportunities where it's like, hey, this can unlock something massive for the chain, whether it be geopolitical relationships, whether it be massive new applications coming on board that actually have crypto applications, or whether it's simply be means of actually injecting more capital into the ecosystem. So that's a long winded way of saying that we don't have a particular roadmap for exactly where those funds go. Of course, beyond infrastructure costs, payroll, etcetera would certainly add up, but our goal is to make them last as long as possible and to make sure the foundation and the labs entities are endowed for, you know, the next 510 plus years.
00:42:38.684 - 00:42:57.396, Speaker B: No, it's. It's awesome. It's just. It's super cool to see, like, to be that well funded for that long because you're not really in a rush. But the. The flip side I'd offer is, like, I saw a lot of l one's, you know, I'll throw tezos in there as a really good example. Like, really smart team, like, respect them.
00:42:57.396 - 00:43:15.214, Speaker B: Um, like, it was a really cool idea. It still is. But they raised so much money. I think they have hundreds of millions in eth. I'm dating myself. Maybe they sold it. But it seems like the flip side is, if you don't spend the money aggressively and really make a foothold while the hype is there, it's sort of just.
00:43:15.214 - 00:43:20.686, Speaker B: It becomes a slush fund. Right. So I guess there is some impetus to spend that, as you can pretty.
00:43:20.710 - 00:43:42.516, Speaker A: Aggressively, and I think that all the way that. So to give it a little bit more nuance. Right. I think that the way that we think about it is if we can spend the capital in an asymmetric manner, we should do so. But if we can spend. If we spend the capital for the sake of it, I don't think we will. The next one that we think about as really asymmetric for ourselves and the ecosystem as a whole is really just going absolutely ham on international expansion.
00:43:42.516 - 00:44:32.174, Speaker A: We're glad to already have teams on the ground in Korea, Shenzhen, India, Dubai, and actually one person now, but we know that that can expand. We know there's a massive market, especially across Southeast Asia, and more places in Asia, honestly, that we haven't tapped yet. We know there's a ton of work to be done in Africa. We know there's a ton of work to be done in Latin America, and I want to make sure that we have outposts and we have people actually helping to grow those communities and bring more and more people on chain as well. So without getting too corny, I really do think that part of the bear chain vision is actually helping to bring people who could have real uses for crypto beyond the magic online casino into the fray. And I want to make sure that we don't miss out on that opportunity either. So I think it's fair to say that a non trivial percent of the funds raised will go towards greater establishing our presences and sort of growth efforts over there.
00:44:32.174 - 00:44:45.614, Speaker A: And a lot of other ones will just go towards deals that we think can take the ecosystem to the next level. But I don't think there's ever a point at which we'll look to ourselves and be like, oh man, we didn't spend like $5 this year. We gotta go blow that real quick on some sponsorships.
00:44:47.284 - 00:44:48.344, Speaker B: Yeah, we're behind.
00:44:49.204 - 00:44:56.108, Speaker A: You know what I mean? I do think that we will 100% be like, yeah, like, you know, that one looks like it's gonna return ten x. Let's, let's make that happen.
00:44:56.276 - 00:45:27.844, Speaker B: Another thing I want to ask you on is just competitive dynamics. Like, you open up the podcast and you, you stated like an EVM, identical l one, right. And that's, that was a key point you mentioned, and I agree that it is important. Right. So that kind of begs the question, like, is there like, how do you view the effort of attracting vampire attacking, convincing existing ETH apps to move over? I preface this with, you want to attract the good apps too, not the ones that are dead and can't fund. So it gets interesting.
00:45:28.504 - 00:45:58.134, Speaker A: Of course, I think you attract two types of apps as a new ecosystem, maybe three. One for us is we care the most about our native applications. Our native builders, they're the ones who've been bear chain ride or die from the start. They've always been bear alliance per se. They plan to launch tokens on the chain, which something that we care about a whole bunch as well. And one of the biggest misses we've seen in recent chain launches has been a lack of other assets to speculate on in an ecosystem when the gas token is already very highly valued, et cetera. So that's something that we think is super important.
00:45:58.134 - 00:46:47.554, Speaker A: And also, just like, it gives it that opportunity to have that snowballing wealth creation effect. Right? So a, you know, native builders come number one, I think number two in that equation come, you know, like sort of the giants per se are the groups that we've known for quite some time and that have seen a massive track record of success. In other chains. I think that they play two purposes. On one hand, they play value in terms of signaling and saying, hey, trust me, guys, these guys legit, like, you know, real chain, etcetera. But on the other hand, depending on when they come, they can actually be quite value extractive if it means that, you know, a new application or, you know, a known blue chip is coming to that chain, but it's not giving any emissions out, it's not launching a token or anything over there. It's just sort of, you know, attracting more TVL and providing a service which is great for the constituents of that network, but may not effectively have the same upside that some of those native apps might have.
00:46:47.554 - 00:47:36.988, Speaker A: And then I think a third bucket is those groups that were struggling to sort of break out or make it out the hood on main net or arbitrum or optimism or wherever else they might be, and are sort of looking at a fresh coat of paint or a second. A second shot at things. And I think that there's also a pretty meaningful space for those too, as long as the core ideas have enough potential as well. So, you know, I guess the way we think about it is you have to be PvP in these environments, and it's sort of like it's built around your chain until it isn't. I guess in that, I think there's certainly a point where there's a degree of critical mass built in ecosystem where one can afford to be more wag me and afford to be like, yeah, we want this application on every chain. But I think I would probably devil's advocate that statement with a couple different thoughts. Right.
00:47:36.988 - 00:47:48.344, Speaker A: One, I don't think we've really seen any successful, truly cross chain apps with the exception of, like, you know, sort of uni aave, like, I guess, store chain.
00:47:49.244 - 00:47:52.548, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
00:47:52.716 - 00:48:45.334, Speaker A: I actually think that, like, I think that a lot of the cross chain stuff is like the ultimate mid curve move because people think that they will, you know, expand their market, you know, they'll expand their tan and they'll have a whole bunch of new customers flowing into them and new users, but actually they just end up diluting their user base on one chain in favor of another that doesn't really care about them either. So I think you need to take super concentrated bets to win. So going back to your question and recap my whole thoughts. We want to be able to bring some of the ogs that we have a lot of love and respect for over to bear chain. We care the most about the native ecosystem. We also want to be able to give some of these applications that had a good shake of things on mainnet or other chains, you know, didn't quite make it to that level of breakout potential that they could have and give them an opportunity to ride again, if you will. And we mostly just care about building and seeing cool new things that we couldn't have seen anywhere else before, you know, no matter what category that might fall into.
00:48:45.334 - 00:48:56.010, Speaker A: And we have no issue, you know, basically working to bring them over from other groups if we do really believe that they can have a better home here. And that doesn't apply to everyone, but it definitely applies to a lot of people.
00:48:56.202 - 00:49:13.744, Speaker B: No, that's a great answer. Um, so just switching gears a little bit, we have like around ten minutes left before we usually call quits. We'll see where we go. Um, I just want to make sure I get these in. So you, you raise a lot of money. Um, you have, you built a great community. Um, and, you know, the story's down.
00:49:13.744 - 00:49:37.064, Speaker B: You guys are building. Right. One question I have for you is, like, during that fundraise process, maybe for the VC's listening or for the other founders, I'm curious, like, what were the, maybe the hardest question or two that you had to answer from a fund. Right. Like somebody that really, maybe, maybe not stumped you, but, you know, really got you thinking or maybe influenced the project in such a way. And you don't have to name names, but I'm just curious, like, the best questions you got?
00:49:37.764 - 00:49:42.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to think about this one for a second because I'm not going to lie. Our last fundraiser is like, pretty easy.
00:49:44.244 - 00:49:46.864, Speaker B: Maybe you handled it the first time.
00:49:47.924 - 00:50:32.074, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I just think that, like, there was a lot of, I think that the biggest question that VC's often have due diligence on, on a new chain is like, do people actually want to build stuff here? Right. And I don't think that was a very hard question for them to answer with bear chain between the levels of social and, you know, I guess, and I guess just like evidence proof here. Right. So I think that that was definitely a lot easier. I think that there were certainly, you know, concerns at different points about, like, okay, are validators going to want to participate in the system where they aren't earning the majority of their block awards? And I think that, you know, the same answer that I gave you a little bit earlier was one that made a lot of sense for people where it's like, actually, I think it's just a matter of screening for the valuers that will truly be drivers of value more than anything else. So I think that was certainly part of it.
00:50:36.574 - 00:50:42.914, Speaker B: It's crazy how easy the last round was, too. That's a good sign, because that means you pretty much nailed it the first time around.
00:50:43.934 - 00:51:03.128, Speaker A: And look, I'll contrast the series. A was definitely not quite as easy. It was happening as FTX blew up. I think Kanto was live at the same time, and people were like, oh, isn't this just Kanto? But not. And we're just like, no, it's very different. We have a lot of respect for those guys. But I think two fundamentally different approaches.
00:51:03.128 - 00:51:28.948, Speaker A: One is tying liquidity to security. The other is having a bunch of these applications built on top of the chain, which is cool. And I think they've done a great job of building over the last little while. But I remember, I think that was the arc in which people were asking us a whole bunch about. About Kanto and evmos. And I think this year we had a lot more people asking us about, like, okay, like, what is the massive, audacious vision for this look? Like, you know what? I guess one question we got was people like, hey, bear chains. Like, got a very crypto native brand.
00:51:28.948 - 00:51:50.954, Speaker A: How do you think about actually scaling beyond that? Right. And how do you think about, like, you know, going to the corporates, the institutions, et cetera? And I also do think that when we were able to say that the Brevin Howard digital was co leading the round, that helped assuage a lot of concerns over there. Oh, yeah. Because when you think about feds, I think those folks are about as fed as it gets, relatively speaking, in the crypto space.
00:51:53.054 - 00:51:56.158, Speaker B: I can't go through permission chains again. And public chains.
00:51:56.246 - 00:52:31.980, Speaker A: No, no, no. That's not it at all. I think it's more just understanding that there's actually a lot of ways to focus on corporates that can be, well, abstracted from the core bear chain brand per se. Stuff in our scaling roadmap, the L two s, et cetera, are very much up that alley as well. Well, there's a group that's being built right now that will probably announce a fundraise in the next few weeks. That is, you know, some of the most seasoned gaming slash gambling entrepreneurs that we know of in the space who are building a chain for consumer social, that's, you know, already basically got 100 million users lined up from different applications that are building on there that will all be rolling up to Vera. Right? So like there's a hundred, there's a, there's a number of different ways to spin vera.
00:52:31.980 - 00:52:56.096, Speaker A: And I think that, like, that's part of the beauty of it when, when I reflect on it, right, like, it is very much a many sided die. There's people who look at it as, you know, some sort of a wonky bridge between the worlds of cosmos and ethereum. Though I honestly try to stay pretty far away from cosmos. My apologies. His groups who view it as like, you know, the ultimate like, lst capital efficiency chain. There's groups who you viewed as Eigen layer for shit coins. Those groups who view it as a defi chain.
00:52:56.096 - 00:53:32.668, Speaker A: Like, there's just so many different ways of looking at it. Yeah, exactly. And I actually think that like a little bit beyond that is like the anonymous nature means that we could really be just about anyone. I think that over time it's hopefully become evident that we're not complete goofballs, that we're definitely fairly goofy. But there's a team that's built some of the first protocols in DeFi that's shipped meaningful products to millions of people in the trad tech world, managing deployed billions of capital collectively. And I think that having that breadth of experiences really does allow us to draw on a number of different angles for where bear chain goes over time. So, yeah, I think that we're pretty excited for that.
00:53:32.796 - 00:53:50.604, Speaker B: No, I definitely think it's exciting. I guess what are you most excited about? Most concerned with over the next? Let's use crypto time. So maybe the next 30 to 60 days. Anything beyond that doesn't matter. But maybe we could talk Mainet launch next steps and go from there.
00:53:50.764 - 00:54:51.114, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. I think right now we're just in the middle of all the very fun stuff in terms of incentive design and what just like launch plan looks like in terms of times at which we want to effectively enable different applications to start tapping into proof of liquidity beyond the three ones that are built into the chain that I mentioned. It's like, okay, cool, when is it safe to flip that switch? Thinking about effectively means that we can actually help attract liquidity into the different applications in the ecosystem. Thinking about some of our airdrop mechanics, I think all those things are top of mind. And then also thinking about a ton of the applications that are now at their MVP stage and are ready to raise new rounds. There's already been, I think, close to $50 million worth of investment in the Vera chain app layer ecosystem prior to the chain going live. And while that's by no means a measure of success, it's more just, I think, showing that people are willing to take bets on apps in Vera chain, and I think that we want to be able to see that continuing to snowball and, of course, seeing that going to good applications.
00:54:51.114 - 00:55:32.904, Speaker A: So you'll probably also see a couple announcements in the next couple days that will continue enforce in that point. So, yeah, man, I think it's mechanism design stuff. It's the Cody acquisition program type stuff. It is funky airdrop type stuff. It's wrangling custodians and all that kind of fun stuff that I'm sure you guys have had to deal with in some manner as well and probably do not have much love for either. And then doing our best to support teams. And I guess the last bit of that is, like, I think that we've seen a lot of other groups sort of take a binary approach in which, like, they either focus really hard on the western ecosystem or they focus really hard on the eastern ecosystem, like the Hong Kong and Korea bid, and just forget about everything else.
00:55:32.904 - 00:55:48.504, Speaker A: And I think that ultimately leads to, like, some community feeling alienated. Right. Our goal is to do our best to, like, you know, cover as many bases as we can, and that's also focused over the next, you know, 30, 60 days, especially in the asian ecosystem, without spreading ourselves too thin to the point of, you know, trying to boil the ocean.
00:55:49.034 - 00:55:58.818, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm totally with you. I mean, shameless plug here. But if any cool teams are building on bear, are looking for funding, my DM's are always open. Sorry to. Sorry there, Smokey, but would love to support.
00:55:58.866 - 00:56:02.010, Speaker A: No, no, I got you. Yeah, I'm happy to send cool guys your way.
00:56:02.082 - 00:56:19.822, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Well, Smokey, this is awesome. I mean, I really. I think it's really cool meeting teams that can really crush both sides of the curve. Like, the middle of the curve does not exist. Right. It's just, you know, memes and fun and good vibes and really smart devs on the other, and you're building something novel.
00:56:19.822 - 00:56:25.634, Speaker B: So, you know, I think it's really cool, and I really appreciate your time coming on the podcast to explain it to me.
00:56:26.254 - 00:56:43.182, Speaker A: No, cheers, man. Really appreciate it. You asked some really thoughtful questions and, you know, I think, poked at some of the right parts of this and, you know, made me think about some stuff that I haven't had to consider for a little while, so really appreciate the process. And if there's anything that I can ever be helpful with, you know, just let me know, and I'd love to do so. Beyond spending cool teams your way.
00:56:43.278 - 00:56:44.878, Speaker B: Hell, yeah. Well, Smokey, I'll talk soon.
00:56:44.966 - 00:56:45.374, Speaker A: Cheers, man.
