00:00:00.080 - 00:00:22.462, Speaker A: Balaji bet $1 million that within the next 90 days, bitcoin was going to be worth $1 million per bitcoin. He was expecting the US dollar to hyperinflate, meaning that bitcoin would go up in value in comparison. And Balaji's argument is that hyperinflation happens very quickly. It's not a linear thing, it happens slowly and then all at once. So that was what he was betting on. So let's look at.
00:00:22.478 - 00:00:26.102, Speaker B: The dollar, the global reserve currency. It's been the global reserve since the.
00:00:26.118 - 00:00:27.726, Speaker A: End of world War two, and it's.
00:00:27.750 - 00:00:28.590, Speaker B: Been fiat, not.
00:00:28.622 - 00:00:30.054, Speaker A: Backed by anything tangible.
00:00:30.174 - 00:00:51.086, Speaker B: For over 50 years. What's really important is not only is most of the world's trade done in dollars, but also global reserves are often held in us dollar debt treasuries. So, basically, there are two dominant ideas about what's going to happen to the US dollar. On the one hand, you have people like Balaji who believe that the dollar is about to hyperinflate, and then on the other hand, you have people that.
00:00:51.110 - 00:00:52.006, Speaker A: Constantly says.
00:00:52.110 - 00:00:59.038, Speaker B: That another reserve currency is coming, or no reserve currency at all, and that the US dollar is about to fall. So what makes.
00:00:59.086 - 00:00:59.734, Speaker A: This time different?
