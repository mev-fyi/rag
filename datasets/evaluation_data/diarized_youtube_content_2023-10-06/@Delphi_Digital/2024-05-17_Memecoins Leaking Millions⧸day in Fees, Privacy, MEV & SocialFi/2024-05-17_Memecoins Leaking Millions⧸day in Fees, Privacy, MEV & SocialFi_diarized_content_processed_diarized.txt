00:00:11.800 - 00:00:45.218, Speaker A: All right. Hi, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. Today with me, as always, we have Jan Lieberman, managing director at Delphi Ventures, ceteris Paribus, head of research. I gave you a full name today. And flood capital, also known as Duncan, who is our altcoin gem hunter, coming at us from his Michael Saylor inspired office. So we have a bunch to get through today. Maybe to start with, just markets.
00:00:45.218 - 00:00:51.214, Speaker A: I believe it appears as of today that we're back, but maybe you guys have some more in depth takes on this.
00:00:51.804 - 00:00:54.224, Speaker B: I mean, we're in the banana zone, right?
00:00:56.524 - 00:01:06.664, Speaker C: Think how. How hard banana gun is going to pump when we enter into banana zone. It's like a perfect lineup. We need to. We need to get Raul into banana gun.
00:01:08.684 - 00:01:33.244, Speaker B: But no, I mean, over at 66 now, what softer inflation print. There's that. There's that sab 121 vote that's, like, going on right now, which I think is pretty critical. Um, it's basically like, who. It's the things that. Who can custody, uh, the assets. Um, and it was something put through by, like, the SEC.
00:01:33.244 - 00:02:01.252, Speaker B: And, like, this is the thing that Biden said that if it got to him, he would veto it. Uh, so it's pretty important because it, like, changes market structure a, like, allowing banks to actually custody these assets for their clients. So that's, like, something big that will impact the market, like, today. And then I know the east decision is next week. Right.
00:02:01.428 - 00:02:06.516, Speaker D: And there's a 13 epcs. And before leaving bitcoin side.
00:02:06.700 - 00:02:07.624, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:08.644 - 00:02:12.274, Speaker D: All the announcements of millennium.
00:02:12.654 - 00:02:14.294, Speaker C: Yeah. Pretty big position.
00:02:14.374 - 00:02:42.458, Speaker D: Yeah. You just find out where did all these flows come from in Q one. And so now you kind of get exposure to random pensions and funds that put positions in. And it offers signal to the market that there's appetite across these funds and a lot more demand that can still come from those buckets, which is kind of really what's needed to put in a floor and move us higher.
00:02:42.626 - 00:03:01.274, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess, like, the flows, like, first they come from the hedge funds, kind of more nimble capital, and then hopefully, you start to get, you know, the next level of flows for, like, you know, different personal investment accounts, maybe like pensions. Take a small position. Slowly. Yeah, I think things are.
00:03:01.394 - 00:03:05.614, Speaker B: Wisconsin. Wisconsin bought. It was a decent chunk, wasn't it? Like 100 mil.
00:03:05.734 - 00:03:07.234, Speaker D: Like 100 mil, yeah.
00:03:07.614 - 00:03:08.434, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:08.974 - 00:03:10.766, Speaker D: Millennium was two b's.
00:03:10.950 - 00:03:13.718, Speaker B: Millennium is, like, trading it. Right?
00:03:13.886 - 00:03:15.038, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure.
00:03:15.126 - 00:03:15.494, Speaker B: Good.
00:03:15.574 - 00:03:38.936, Speaker D: But it is signal, though, right? Um, in the sense, because, like, the counter would be, oh, they've already bought that's. That's not as bullish. But this is the, you know, we're still in the very early innings of play, players like them buying. And so I still see it as more signal rather than for upside rather than, you know, being quote unquote late.
00:03:39.080 - 00:03:45.056, Speaker A: Yeah, and crypto Twitter seems pretty bearish. Maybe it's just. Maybe it's just my feed.
00:03:45.200 - 00:04:10.610, Speaker C: No, no, it's because bitcoin is down 15% and then. But all your altcoins are down 60. So it's like, literally, if you're going based on, like, crypto Twitter sentiment, you'd think we're at, like, 50k right now. Just because everyone is all in alts, especially, like, a lot of people were in on memes and, like, you know, some, like, whip has held up pretty well. I think it's at, like, 280 or something. At the top was like 450.
00:04:10.722 - 00:04:11.210, Speaker D: It's like.
00:04:11.282 - 00:04:32.190, Speaker C: But, like, some stuff, like, whatever the one bowdoin was down, like, 80%. I think it's had a decent bounce. But, like, a lot of these alts, especially, like, the low float, high FTV ones, got crushed. Like, a lot of them are down, like, 60 plus percent from the highs. So it's like a pretty big dispersion versus bitcoin being down.
00:04:32.262 - 00:04:48.030, Speaker D: That's the big one. Yeah, the dispersion. Exactly. Yeah, like, that. That makes it so different where people are so many. Like, yes, prices are up, but so many people are still in a decent amount of pain and below their high water mark from a month or two ago.
00:04:48.182 - 00:05:24.806, Speaker B: Yeah, I put that. I put that little, like, chart out the other day that, like, five people took and tweeted it themselves. Like, I broke it by sectors and I mean, yeah, we've been talking about this dispersion the whole time, but when you really kind of just bucket eyes stuff, it's just really, like, anything cosmos related. Modular related. Like, very. They're all down this year. And then you have a couple l ones that have done well, you know, like, eth.
00:05:24.806 - 00:05:45.234, Speaker B: Everybody kind of, like, shits on Eth. It's not like Eth has been terrible. Especially when you account for, like, all the LRT stuff, you know, all the, like, the yield, like, pendle and things like that. It hasn't been terrible. What's been terrible is too. Is, like, eth beta. Um, and, like.
00:05:45.234 - 00:06:00.934, Speaker B: Like, Lido, for instance, is, like, down versus USD over the past year, which is pretty impressive considering where we were, like, a year ago. Right. So I think that's, like. Yeah, there's, like, definitely a lot of pockets.
00:06:02.114 - 00:06:12.714, Speaker D: Yeah. It isn't terrible against USD, but it just, it's, it's bucketed against BTC and Seoul. Right. They're kind of the three on that standalone and it's just massively underperformed.
00:06:13.054 - 00:06:24.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, definitely hasn't done well, but it, I think like the worst, the worst areas were basically just cosmos and like eth beta stuff.
00:06:24.622 - 00:06:53.890, Speaker A: Yeah. The other thing I see a lot on the CT is this consensus that there are no catalysts coming and like no new flows. Just like take some are off. That's my, in my view, like, yeah, exactly. Whenever there's like a broad consensus like that, it's just, it's just so dangerous. Like, Kang has that really good post, like how to avoid getting bear hulled. And the basic summary is just like, you can't see all the flows.
00:06:53.890 - 00:07:19.084, Speaker A: Right. And like, people in crypto, especially on crypto Twitter, just have this idea that they can see all the flows and all the catalysts and like time them perfectly. But in reality, you just have no idea what's happening with like 99.9% of this stuff. And that's why I think most people who do the short term trading stuff end up getting wrecked. Yeah. And whenever there's been so many times I feel like there's been that consensus and crypto just like rips.
00:07:19.084 - 00:07:20.724, Speaker A: Rips up off it.
00:07:20.764 - 00:07:58.270, Speaker B: I mean, also, like, think about these. ETF's cave, BlackRock has been pitching this to like all their institutional clients and everything. They have a reputation to maintain. Like, there's a lot of energy behind, like you think they want to launch this and then have their clients take like an 80% haircut, like in the first six months or something. And this is before a lot of like the, the banks have even been approved to like pitch it to their clients and stuff. So I know, I feel like there's just a, there's a lot that you can't see because this is a totally new market structure that none of us are ever used to. Right.
00:07:58.270 - 00:08:18.414, Speaker B: It's like totally new participants and like, I just, you know, it's not, it's like, that doesn't mean that BTC can't drop a lot, but there is, there are these like new big participants that have like a vested interest now to like.
00:08:18.574 - 00:08:56.808, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the constant trip also changes that. You know, before it felt like if BTC wasn't going up, it had, it had to go down. Right. Because it felt like you'd have these periodic inflows of demand and then once those people allocated it would you either have internal movement or would kind of go down. Whereas now with the passive flows, I still think people are kind of convinced that if it's not going up, it kind of has to go down, but it's not necessarily the case. It can chill, especially with, with funding being this low, people can sit in longs for pretty long. And so, and then you have these surprise throws.
00:08:56.808 - 00:09:08.928, Speaker D: Like ibit yesterday was. It wasn't ibit, it was RB out of nowhere with, like, a big inflow. And so that was something that was never present in previous market structures.
00:09:09.056 - 00:09:09.392, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:09.448 - 00:09:51.380, Speaker C: I think that the ETF as a whole, like, that whole machine behind it and the flows behind it is just kind of getting started. And that's what this 13 naps are showing us. It's like these more nimble hedge funds you can move really quickly are getting in. Like, we haven't seen, you know, the longer term allocators, like, start to dip their toe in, which, like, takes, the marketing engine takes, like, the churn to actually happen. So, like, saying that there's no catalysts, I think that, like, the ETF is still just, like, ramping. And the other thing is, like, we talked about this a lot in the previous podcast, so, like, I'm happy that we talked about just this low float that, like, just because bitcoin's, like, goes up doesn't mean that, like, some of these altcoins are going to go up. Like, the low flow, high ftv.
00:09:51.380 - 00:10:30.874, Speaker C: Like, we've seen a lot of those names get absolutely crushed this month. And, like, you know, I don't know if those coins are going to make new highs, but I think, you know, we're pretty constructive on bitcoin. And then, like, selective alts that, like, don't have these big supply overhang dynamics and maybe have some sort of product, hopefully. I think memes will probably do well, but I think crypto Twitter is definitely misleading because you could just see, like, everyone was allocated into memes and alts that just, you know, bitcoin was, like, down 20% after rallying 100. And people are, like, saying that they're down on the year.
00:10:31.454 - 00:10:31.878, Speaker D: There's.
00:10:31.926 - 00:10:57.182, Speaker B: There's also crazy. Yeah. Like, there's also a lot of survivorship bias in memes. Right? Like, you don't really know what memes are, like, worth tracking until they go up a lot. Yeah. And so people don't talk about their thousand snipes of memes that all went to zero. And that's why, like, a lot of people are probably down.
00:10:57.182 - 00:11:05.406, Speaker B: Right. Because you're just, like, trying to snipe all these, like, new launch memes. Right. There's. There's like 10,000 new tokens coming out a day or something like that.
00:11:05.430 - 00:11:06.014, Speaker D: Yes.
00:11:06.174 - 00:11:07.798, Speaker C: And that was a big thing that we talked about.
00:11:07.886 - 00:11:09.812, Speaker D: Revenues are a good proxy for that.
00:11:09.998 - 00:11:10.648, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:10.776 - 00:11:37.528, Speaker C: It's just like, how do you size into some of those things, like, with conviction and actually hold them where, you know, maybe the established ones, you can now because they have some sort of mind share, but it's really difficult to, you know, buy new. Like, you're literally just rolling a dice. And the higher those, like, you know, big ones go, like, the more people want to get on the next one and the more gonna be created and the more difficult it's gonna get. So it's really difficult to, like, find, like, a new meme and get in early.
00:11:37.576 - 00:11:37.926, Speaker D: It's.
00:11:38.000 - 00:11:43.730, Speaker C: It's pretty random. Or you're just God hear me and bicker.
00:11:43.842 - 00:12:14.294, Speaker B: I mean, the way to look at. So I brought up pumped off fund revenues, and I've seen a lot of people talking about this because of how successful it is. But the other way to look about that is that's just all lost money from traders trying to snipe these launches. Right. That is just money. Like, you can just look at it if that's how much lost, like, the minimum amount that people have just, like, lost trying to also get it on memes early.
00:12:14.634 - 00:12:42.504, Speaker D: It's also, like, it's a proxy for. Because there's, like, the meme investing kind of breaks down in different demographics. Right. You have smaller pa sizes that are basically trying to snipe and sell within hours kind of thing, and do it in much, much smaller size because it makes sense for them. And, and there's definitely an edge there. Right. But it can only really be captured by smaller pas because it just doesn't, you can't really do it in size.
00:12:42.504 - 00:13:13.944, Speaker D: And so that's still continuously happening, which reflected by pump revenues. Right. Because that's solely focused on kind of launches. And then you have the larger demographic, I think the much larger position sizing, where people are trying to catch the move from like 50 to 500 or something like that. And so, yeah, it's a tricky one. Where's the highest ev? What's the highest ev? Way to allocate on the meme side. I think, like you mentioned, it's hard to size into a lot of these because so many tend to go to zero.
00:13:13.944 - 00:13:35.280, Speaker D: And so it's almost, rather than trying to be counter trend and identify ones that you think can return. It's almost. You can sleep better at night just picking winners with lower risk, lower return and versus kind of. Yeah. In the trenches, trying to do a lot of sniping and. Sorry, what do you mean?
00:13:35.392 - 00:14:06.732, Speaker C: What else could you buy? If you wanted to get me exposure but didn't want to pick a certain meme? I'm trying to get him to say banana, but yeah. So anyways, so I just pulled up the dashboard. In the past seven days, Trojan bonkbot and banana gun combined have done around. Let's round up a little. 600 million in volume at a 1% fee. That's 6 million in fees they're taking out of the market and then pumped up fund. This article's from a week ago, but it said they did 3 million in fees last week.
00:14:06.732 - 00:14:46.150, Speaker C: So we're talking about nearly $10 million just extracted from fees on those, like, three tools or, like, bunk bot, trojan banana gun, and pumped up fun on those four. So that's actually, like, a decent amount of money. Money. And you just, like, see the, like, people that's chasing because, you know, you see whiff go up a gazillion percent. You see bowdoin go up, you know, a gazillion percent, you makes you think that you can get in on the next one, which maybe you will if you get lucky. But really, it, since, like, setter said, 10,000 new coins a day, it's going to be pretty difficult.
00:14:46.222 - 00:14:51.284, Speaker B: I mean, pump made over a million in one day. The other day.
00:14:52.144 - 00:15:05.968, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's pretty crazy. And these are relatively low volumes. Right. Like, you go back to March, instead of it being 10 million a week that these four are making, it's probably more like 30 or 40 million a week, which is pretty crazy.
00:15:06.136 - 00:15:12.216, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's obviously not sustainable, I guess, is what we're saying. But for now, it. For now, it lives on.
00:15:12.400 - 00:15:40.524, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's just like, when do people get burned enough where they stop chasing the new memes, right. Because it seems pretty consensus that, like, memes are like these meme coins. And even with, like, the roaring kitty stuff, like, it seems pretty consensus that that's what's going to perform. You know, it's performed the best year to date, and that's going to continue to be one of the best performers. So it'll be interesting to see, like.
00:15:40.564 - 00:16:01.916, Speaker A: How long I think it's consensus in and, like, what people say, but my suspicion and seeing different polls on. On Twitter and stuff is that people still aren't really allocated accordingly. Like, I think most people have probably sub five or sub 10% of their portfolio in memes. Right. So I don't know. I think even if it is consensus.
00:16:02.100 - 00:16:03.824, Speaker D: It'S probably reasonable though.
00:16:04.124 - 00:16:04.988, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:16:05.036 - 00:16:26.056, Speaker D: I mean, I'm there. Like, you have, you have. I think what is going to keep them alive and is just the fact that every time we bounce, they bounce the hardest. Right. And so it's hard to fight that. Right. Or, you know, if that trend continues, then you're going to see consistent allocation.
00:16:26.056 - 00:16:46.214, Speaker D: The reason people really got burned in the drawdown is, yes, they had gains, but they just recycled those gains into the next thing. And it's. Unless you actually take that cash out when there's a drawdown, even if you made gains in the previous thing and put them into the next thing, like, you're going to experience that massive drawdown. And so, um, it's. Yeah, and like, especially some of these.
00:16:46.244 - 00:16:52.650, Speaker C: On chain ones, like, the liquidity is so thin that, you know, it happens really fast.
00:16:52.722 - 00:16:55.174, Speaker A: It's like people start and it thins out quick too.
00:16:57.274 - 00:16:58.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:58.394 - 00:17:21.288, Speaker B: Especially on Solana, because there's way more. There's less liquidity. It's like Solana always boasts their volume to TVL metrics, and there's a lot of concentrated liquidity, but that's because the ranges are tight and there's also more professional market makers kind of doing stuff there. And so, yeah, it can really drop out pretty quickly on some of those.
00:17:21.416 - 00:17:43.254, Speaker D: Yeah. The ratio of market cap to idle liquidity to volume is nuts. Right. You have very little idle liquidity, a lot of volume and a lot of market cap. And it's just like very high churn on that idle liquidity. But that doesn't mean you have a lot of exit liquidity at the same time. It's just like, there's a lot of buying and selling happening.
00:17:43.254 - 00:17:49.198, Speaker D: But the second a lot of the buying slows down, there's not that much exit liquidity for pure selling.
00:17:49.366 - 00:18:18.496, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no, exactly. Because you lose that side, there's no idle liquidity there to, to support it. I think another thing, like a meme coin, I actually think it's. And it's not exactly a meme coin, but like, one of the big things about meme coins, I feel like that gives them their value is like the distribution they have. Right. The holder base, like the network effect. One of the analysts on the research team just put out a really good piece on like, the attention economy or attention is all you need, I think.
00:18:18.496 - 00:19:02.390, Speaker C: But basically it's all about just, like, eyeballs on the meme. And that's really how they kind of blow up and so on telegram. There's so Telegram has 800 million users, and they have, like, an exclusive deal with this, like, you know, the ton blockchain to have it implemented in the telegram wallet. And basically they give you a free wallet as long as you don't have a us phone number. So they have, like, pretty crazy distribution, like, probably, like 700 million wallets created all in the telegram blockchain. And, like, the biggest altcoin over there right now is, like, called not coin, which is kind of a meme, kind of like. But, like, they're leaning more into the distribution angle where they have only, like, 2 million followers on Twitter.
00:19:02.390 - 00:19:08.150, Speaker C: They have 6 million subscribers. It's like the third largest telegram group ever. It just launched on, like, binance. Okay.
00:19:08.182 - 00:19:08.326, Speaker A: X.
00:19:08.350 - 00:19:45.558, Speaker C: Like, all the big exchanges today, and they're kind of like, I guess, getting new projects. You want distribution to, like, pay them money, and then they'll, or buy not coin, and then they'll distribute it through their channels to people. So that's just one idea. I thought that that's the first meme coin that I thought is kind of interesting this cycle because of just the sheer distribution it has, being the third largest telegram group, having the most 2 million Twitter followers, and being really integrated into telegram natively. And it's not very big in North America. It's more of a rest of the world thing. I own some not coins.
00:19:45.558 - 00:19:51.554, Speaker C: I thought it was cool, but it just launched today, and I think it's an interesting idea.
00:19:52.134 - 00:20:01.366, Speaker A: All right. I feel like we've reduced the meme coin and markets to the max. Does anyone else have some more stuff to say on that?
00:20:01.510 - 00:20:07.694, Speaker B: No, I mean, the only thing on meme coin angle, I guess, is, like, do we want to talk about how Degen chain was out for two days?
00:20:07.854 - 00:20:09.074, Speaker A: I didn't even know that.
00:20:09.514 - 00:20:10.538, Speaker B: You didn't know that?
00:20:10.666 - 00:20:11.334, Speaker A: No.
00:20:12.474 - 00:20:41.944, Speaker B: Yeah. I still don't, like, totally understand everything what happened, but because, like, when you have a centralized sequencer, the benefit is that when you have an outage, like, you can just start it yourself. There's no coordination needed. Right. Like, when Solana has their outages, they have to get 80% of the network to agree on, like, this fork and to run the new labs, like, release or whatever. And so it takes time. Right.
00:20:41.944 - 00:21:18.772, Speaker B: Um, but DJ and chain was out for two days, and there's, like, a 500k block reorg, so, which is, like, really bad. Um, and this is like one of the risks of using, I guess, like a, there was two chains that were by one roll up as a service provider and like, both of them went out. This is like just another, like centralized centralization risk. I guess. If like a lot of people start using one provider, whether it's like a roll up provider, like RPC. I know Mert was talking about this. Like, if a lot of people are just using one RPC provider, like that RPC provider goes up.
00:21:18.772 - 00:21:40.656, Speaker B: There's a lot of hidden centralization pockets in a lot of this stuff. And so, yeah, I don't know, it was pretty bad. Like, I still haven't read like a full post, post mortem that I'm sure we'll get some point. I think a lot of people are just kind of confused as to how, like single sequencer roll up was out for two days.
00:21:40.840 - 00:22:55.390, Speaker D: One last point on the meme front that we could maybe use to transition to another topic we want to chat through was Trump related activity and basically how he came out as massively bullish. And so, uh, well, he's such a wild card, right? Like he, he'll, he's always gonna have an opinion on, on something. And so people were trying to get takes on him about, uh, just crypto and bowdoin, as you know, he obviously spoke bullishly on, on crypto. And so the polyfy meme started doing well, like, you know, Trump in particular. But then he, when someone asked him directly about Bode and he just started fighting it and, and it actually started nuking, which is pretty funny. But I got to imagine that's going to be a continuing trend, just getting his one off takes because of how much he can move markets and how just blunt he'll be about certain things. But yeah, it seems like he is really going to both raise a decent amount of money and win over some, some voters because I can't imagine a lot of people are going to be voting for him for his anti, or voting for Biden for his anti crypto policy.
00:22:55.390 - 00:23:04.262, Speaker D: But I think you'll definitely get some Trump voters for his pro crypto policy. So it seems like a pretty positive bet to go that way.
00:23:04.438 - 00:23:20.848, Speaker A: And then you have the drama, the sort of blockworks drama on the piece that whoever that kind of journalist was that wrote know about not voting just because of crypto. Uh, that caused a lot of, I don't really know why.
00:23:21.016 - 00:23:49.522, Speaker B: I understand her point. I understand her point. Like, especially if you're, what was the point? I mean, especially if you're a woman, like there's a lot of, like, abortion topics that are important in this election. Right. So. But the, but the thing is, even if you're not, even if you don't identify as like, single issue voter, I think when people vote, they normally have one thing in their mind regardless about why they vote a certain way. And the only.
00:23:49.522 - 00:24:09.090, Speaker B: Yeah. The thing that I guess would turn people off is that it was kind of trying to, like, morally shame people for, like, voting Trump because he's pro crypto, whereas, like, I agree with the point that you should, I don't know, look at everything. But for a lot of people in this industry, this is their livelihood. Right. And so.
00:24:09.282 - 00:24:09.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:09.842 - 00:24:10.122, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:10.178 - 00:24:11.820, Speaker A: I also think because it's not even.
00:24:11.852 - 00:24:28.304, Speaker D: Like, you know, the other side is trying to do it with good faith is the problem. Right. It's one thing if one's pro and the other's kind of neutral, but here you have a scenario where one side is just irrationally trying to kill it. And so I think, you know, downplaying that was a bit disingenuous on her part.
00:24:28.724 - 00:24:52.688, Speaker A: Yeah. I also think, like, crypto for a lot of people, especially the people that got in early, maybe less of the sort of people from, from this cycle, is about freedom. Right. And it is like a very, like they got in because. Because they care about freedom and so they care about freedom. So they're going to prioritize that in their, in their voting. And this kind of leads us a little bit towards this, these issues.
00:24:52.688 - 00:25:44.726, Speaker A: Like, we had two big kind of crypto legal rulings this week. One against the Tornado cash dev, Alex Pertsev, and then one against the mev boost exploiters. Right? And I think obviously the exploiters was just like an action, whereas the tornado cache dev was an actual ruling. And I don't know how many of you guys followed this, but it was pretty terrible. I'd say, like, the worst ruling I've personally read for, for crypto because the judges sort of, like, it's not, it's not a case where the judges don't understand how all the stuff works and said some stupid stuff, made some stupid interpretations. They understand exactly how crypto works. They, like, acknowledge that this is a quote.
00:25:44.726 - 00:26:22.786, Speaker A: Due to the nature of how the system works, it is virtually impossible to make the user interface inaccessible. This fact, combined with the use of smart contracts makes it virtually impossible to take tornado cash offline. So they acknowledge that this stuff is unstoppable. But they basically argue that the fact that the tornado cash devs built it and knew that it could potentially be used for criminal activity. When they built it is enough to make them liable, which is pretty wild. So they say, yeah. In other words, the tornado cash founders are the inventors, creators and implementers of tornado cash.
00:26:22.786 - 00:26:47.482, Speaker A: As such, they're also responsible for the consequences of the operation of this tool. The autonomous, immutable, and unstoppable nature of the smart contracts does not work in this context as a desultory factor. After all, this is not a for truth to circumstance. These properties are the result of conscious choices made by the designers. Tornado cash works as was conceived in the court's opinion. The defendant can therefore be classified as a perpetrator of the money laundering acts carried out by tornado cash. So.
00:26:47.482 - 00:27:45.370, Speaker A: And interestingly, they also acknowledge, like in the court case, that they came up with a figure of 84% of. Of tornado cash transactions are like normal people who just want privacy. The DOJ came up with a 93% figure and they acknowledge that. They acknowledge the fact that the tornado cash devs built in a bunch of compliance tools, like being able to provide a proof of history if you needed to, and having kyoc on the front end and none of that matters to them. Basically, the precedent this creates in my mind, especially for a Dev in Europe, is that if you deploy a smart contract on chain, you are basically liable for all potential future criminal activity that might happen on that smart contract for the rest of time. Right. And the only thing they really need to prove based on this case is that you could have reasonably foreseen that there would be criminal activity.
00:27:45.370 - 00:27:59.014, Speaker A: And so I don't know who the hell wants to deploy smart contracts in Europe knowing this, right? Because this isn't. This isn't even a case where you can, like, do something. It's like, if you've deployed it and people are using it criminally, you can't, like, undeploy it, right? So you're just. You're just kind of fucked.
00:27:59.354 - 00:28:03.282, Speaker C: But, like, this is like, let's say someone sells a gun.
00:28:03.418 - 00:28:04.122, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:04.298 - 00:28:06.746, Speaker C: Use the gun to commit a crime. It's like.
00:28:06.890 - 00:28:09.026, Speaker A: Or a smartphone, right? Like that. Yeah.
00:28:09.050 - 00:28:24.006, Speaker C: Like, yeah, there's so many examples where this doesn't. Like, obviously I can understand where they're coming. Coming from. Like, I understand the argument that they're making, but, like, there's so many. Like, you could apply this to so many. Like any tool, like anything, it just.
00:28:24.150 - 00:28:49.510, Speaker D: It undermines the. The whole criminal justice system and just shows how much bias can impact rulings and how things are viewed and what's reasonable despite having you know, like, one set of norms applying in one area and then applying that same set of norms, and another one ends up falling through, which it's. Yeah, yeah.
00:28:49.542 - 00:29:28.936, Speaker B: That was the. By far the worst part of the. Because let's face it, criminal activity is taking place on literally, like, every smart contract in some sense. Like, you just talk about the money flowing through and, like, what it's touched and everything, and the whole, the whole, like, you. You. You needed basically, you need to be able to foresee everybody who will ever use what you deploy for the rest of time, which is, like, what you were saying, which is just impossible to kind of comply with that. So it was a pretty sad.
00:29:28.936 - 00:29:33.004, Speaker B: It was pretty sad ruling because of, like, the logic that they used.
00:29:34.024 - 00:30:13.318, Speaker A: Yeah, the precedent is pretty terrible. It's crazy. This is happening in Europe. I think privacy tech and privacy has always had these, because you can always, for any marginal increase in surveillance technology, you can always argue that it'll make you safer. If you have cameras in everyone's houses, if you track everyone's computers, people will be safer. But, like, democracies have always protected the right to privacy. Like, people have the ability to, like, protect certain information and things that they do from the government.
00:30:13.318 - 00:30:31.192, Speaker A: And I feel like recently, with the AML laws, the KYC, like, in Europe, you can transfer, I think it's over five k, supposedly without. Without, like, doing KYC on your counterparty. Like, we're just eroding all of that. Like, eroding financial privacy completely.
00:30:31.328 - 00:31:04.944, Speaker B: Yeah. It's arguable, though, that it makes it safer. Like, what is kind of sad about this is that the Netherlands are the ones that had the worst massacre of, like, Jews in the Holocaust, because they required a fully public database that had, like, where everyone lived and, like, who was, like, jewish or not, basically. And this turned. This is why they had the most deaths out of any country in Europe. So, like, the framing of privacy as a bad thing is just. It's just, like, what needs to be fixed.
00:31:06.804 - 00:31:07.204, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:07.244 - 00:31:22.824, Speaker B: Because it's really. It's really not. And there's tons of times, like, you think the gay rights movement would have ever gained steam without people being able to, like, talk in private. Right. There's a lot of things that people need to discuss in private to kind of, like, progress society, in a sense, so.
00:31:24.584 - 00:31:56.412, Speaker C: And definitely, like, with the COVID stuff, like, there's a lot of this, like, trade off of, you know, protection for, like, lack of freedom, at least in Canada. Like, it was really bad in terms of, like, lockdowns and vaccine mandates and for, like, a very long time, like, and even with, like, the truckers, which is like, peaceful protests, you know, take, like, banning error, closing people's bank accounts, like, definitely a growing trend in the world.
00:31:56.588 - 00:32:03.624, Speaker D: It's rare that governments don't take advantage of a crisis to increase their reach and power.
00:32:04.204 - 00:32:37.962, Speaker C: Yeah, but that's, like, a reason why a lot of people in crypto are, you know, it's a balancing act because, like, a huge way they actually enforce this is through the monetary system. Right. Because that's how you really, like, when the rubber meets the road, if you can, you know, destroy someone's livelihood or, like, close their bank account. Like, people aren't fucking around when that's on the line. So an alternative money system where that can't happen is. Is, you know, obviously threatening to their ultimate power.
00:32:38.138 - 00:33:11.694, Speaker B: Good. So this is a really good tweet the other day from Jake Szynovsky. That lawyer said 21st century democracy is claiming to be a bulwark against authoritarian authoritarianism. Fuck, I can't say that word. Authoritarianism are ravenous for powers that would make 20th century dictators salivate. And it's true. Like, it is just crazy how much in the last, basically since 911, I guess the amount of authoritarian powers governments have just continued to seek.
00:33:12.434 - 00:33:54.758, Speaker A: And in Europe, it's kind of the worst. I mean, the US has much stronger First Amendment protections and I think constitutional institutional rights to privacy. And hopefully the case against the other tornado cash developer, which is in the US, will yield different results. But in Europe, it's just these sort of bureaucrats in Brussels that really believe, like, the regulation is the answer to everything. And it's getting pretty intense. Do we want to talk about the Mav boost exploit? I mean, I'm curious how we can actually help, like, with this appeal or something like that. I don't know if there's ping, the mean to see if there's a.
00:33:54.758 - 00:33:56.318, Speaker A: There's some way that people can get involved.
00:33:56.366 - 00:33:57.270, Speaker D: If so, we'll.
00:33:57.422 - 00:34:24.110, Speaker A: We'll post it maybe alongside the episode, but seems pretty important for crypto and for freedom generally. But, yeah, if we want to talk about the mev boost exploit, that was, like, really impressive. Yeah, I think someone tweeted that the SDNY understands crypto better than most vc's from this enforcement action. And, yeah, I kind of agree. It was. It was really impressive. Ceteris, you want to give the.
00:34:24.110 - 00:34:28.194, Speaker A: Maybe the lowdown on the exploit and. Yeah, why it matters.
00:34:28.614 - 00:35:18.736, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically two, I think it was two brothers. One of them was a polychain intern before, um, low carb crusader. And what they did was the way mev mev boost works, the sidecar piece that, like, searchers, uh, like builders and validators will run. And, um, basically how it works is like, a builder builds a block with a bunch of transactions and then sends it to a validator. And, like, the highest bidder is the one that they kind of take, and then they propose that block. But when you send this block, the validator could unbundle this block that you've sent them as the builder and then insert their own transactions.
00:35:18.736 - 00:35:58.408, Speaker B: Okay. And so the way they kind of get around this is that you have to, like, sign. You have to get, like a signature or something committing to that block before you see the contents of it. So you can't, like, unbundle it. And these guys figured out a way to, like, forge that signature. And so what they did was when they got this block, they, like, did this fake signature that basically guaranteed they wouldn't unbundle it. And then they got it, and then they inserted their own transactions into it, which, like, sandwiched.
00:35:58.408 - 00:36:44.604, Speaker B: So the, the builder put, like, their own sandwich tribes transaction in it, and then they put their own to, like, sandwich the builder because the builder would have put, like, the way sandwich transactions work is you'll, like, buy like 20 mil of something and then sell like 20 mil and something. Okay. To make like 100k profit. And so it's big numbers, uh, but it's to make, like, kind of a small profit. But when you're the builder, it's kind of riskless in a sense, because pretty easy to just extract that sandwich profit. Um, so essentially, these guys, by forging the signature, were able to take, like, 25 mil with this sandwich attack. So it is different from, like, normal sandwich attacks that happen.
00:36:44.604 - 00:37:32.724, Speaker B: So, like, when this happened, a lot of people felt no sympathy for the MeV bots that got exploited because they're just sandwiching users all the time. Right? And there's a really good tweet from Doug from ambient, and he said, the closest analogy I could come up with this is, like, the Baltimore police decide to go after Omar and only Omar in from, like, the wire. So if you remember the wire, Omar was this, like, criminal, but he only went after other criminals. He didn't go after, like, ordinary people. He only stole from, like, the drug dealers and the other crime ring. And so this is. So basically it'd be like, them arresting Omar, but then leaving everyone else kind of, like, free.
00:37:32.724 - 00:38:09.134, Speaker B: And that was his analogy, which is like, kind of it's like, pretty. It's like the closest one you can kind of get, I guess. But, yeah, like, the DOJ understands this. It also seems likely that the DOJ didn't just alert authorities of this. I mean, the DOJ didn't just come onto this their own. Someone who got stolen from here or someone a part of the MeV, like, supply chain went to, went to them. And so there's a lot of people just, like, in this industry that are constantly going to law enforcement now to, like, fix their problems.
00:38:09.534 - 00:38:10.198, Speaker C: Mm hmm.
00:38:10.286 - 00:38:14.054, Speaker B: Which is not ideal, in my opinion.
00:38:14.214 - 00:38:19.662, Speaker C: But do we think that this will end up making, like, sandwiching illegal or.
00:38:19.798 - 00:38:22.734, Speaker B: I mean, sandwiching is like, they just.
00:38:22.774 - 00:38:26.766, Speaker C: Do it from, like, a non extradition country or something. And just like, you know, I think.
00:38:26.790 - 00:38:30.606, Speaker A: This was a specific case, though, where there was, like, pretty clear, like, fraud.
00:38:30.670 - 00:38:35.474, Speaker B: So the signature. The signature is console signature signatures.
00:38:37.084 - 00:38:37.924, Speaker C: That makes sense.
00:38:38.004 - 00:39:07.654, Speaker B: But also the DOJ is, like, enshrining mev boost. Here in the indictment, they talk about how it's relied upon to make the Ethereum network function like Ethereum. Mev Boost is this third party software developed by a private company. Right. That people in the Ethereum protocol use. But it's not, like, enshrined in the protocol or anything. And the DOJ is essentially enshrining it with this statement.
00:39:07.654 - 00:39:31.272, Speaker B: So, yeah, I don't know. But to your point about sandwiching and front running. Yeah, I have a tweet about this from a year and a half ago, which is kind of tongue in cheek, but it was like, the most likely way that this is solved is out of protocol. And by out of protocol, I mean jail. And, like, I don't, I don't. I don't know how, like, North Korea.
00:39:31.288 - 00:39:33.912, Speaker C: Is just going to spin up an mev mod and do it.
00:39:34.048 - 00:39:35.344, Speaker B: I know, that's the thing, right?
00:39:35.384 - 00:39:39.992, Speaker A: It's like, I don't think that's the. You can make that conclusion from this, though.
00:39:40.168 - 00:40:04.314, Speaker B: No, not from this, because this is specifically. This is different than just a normal sandwich. This is. You're. You're intentionally baiting someone, right, to steal, but you're trying to get an MEV bot to do this big sandwich attack with a lot of money. Um, but I don't know. They obviously understand how this work.
00:40:04.314 - 00:40:26.274, Speaker B: Like, when it came out, I didn't know, like, the number right away, 25 mil. I remember that number from when this happened. And I was like, no way. Is this, like the mev boost exploit? And then, like, I started reading it and, yeah, sure. Enough. It was so. I remember when it happened, people were like, cheering, like normal users.
00:40:26.274 - 00:40:40.454, Speaker B: We're like, good. Like, fuck the mev bots. Why should we have sympathy for them? Right? Because they get sandwiched all the time by these mev bots. But obviously the powers that be decided that.
00:40:43.234 - 00:41:01.232, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree that this is different than your standard sandwiching, but I think it would be optimistic to assume that the current regime would stop their persecution at this and not continue reaching. But it's like, how is it lighter.
00:41:01.368 - 00:41:23.144, Speaker C: Payments, order flow, or any of that other stuff? Right. Well, I guess, like, the difference is because you're consenting to a certain amount of slippage when the user makes the swap. Same thing with the payment for order flow. Like, you're consenting, like, that you're giving them, or, like, some sort of fee you're consenting to, whereas the fraud of the signature is like, you know.
00:41:23.924 - 00:41:34.544, Speaker B: No, but even in, like, pain for flow, there's. There's still. There's still laws around, like, best price execution and everything, which doesn't hold up in the slippage setting.
00:41:36.484 - 00:41:48.048, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. But I'm just trying to think, like, you know, it's harder to go after a sandwich or when it's like, okay, like, the user accepted, they're willing to take up this amount of slippage, and we just gave that to them, kind of.
00:41:48.096 - 00:41:48.664, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:48.824 - 00:41:56.484, Speaker C: Like, if you set your slippage tolerant to nothing, or you use, like, a. Like, a private RPC, like, you won't get sandwiched.
00:41:57.744 - 00:42:09.512, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, use a private RPC, though. You're just now adding another, like, party that you're trusting. You're trusting one party. Right. But you're still trusting someone. So I don't know.
00:42:09.512 - 00:42:11.234, Speaker B: Like, um.
00:42:11.394 - 00:42:17.154, Speaker C: I just think it's. It's a bit of a leap to go from, you know, them faking the signature to.
00:42:17.234 - 00:42:19.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think we all agree on that.
00:42:19.970 - 00:42:51.494, Speaker B: Yeah, we can talk social file. Like, I don't use any of these things because I don't really want people trading my likeness, but. But I do understand why people use them. Right. Uh, like, I think it's good to see experimentation in this kind of, like, weird social stuff other than just, you know, defi. I'm like, I just. I think it's good that we're kind of progressing into a bit of a different domain here.
00:42:53.274 - 00:43:06.524, Speaker D: Yeah. So I like that. I think the social fi stuff is pretty cool. I mean, I guess, you know, it was worth distinguishing what specifically. So fantasy tops. Um, is. Is.
00:43:06.524 - 00:43:56.576, Speaker D: Yeah, I like the fact that we're branching out of DeFi, right, where I think it's just important for the growth of the space as a whole and in terms of onboarding new users and interesting ways to participate in the ecosystem. But so, and you have, like, the financialization of everything. Right. That's what kind of what crypto enables via tokenization, which makes. It makes previously potentially uninteresting games much more interesting. But it also creates reasons for people to start trying to game everything when there are financial benefits. And so I think what you're seeing now on fantasy tops is people trying to bot account to inflate engagement and users.
00:43:56.576 - 00:44:13.904, Speaker D: And it's tough when you know this game when, like, the. When this game is based on an ecosystem that it doesn't really have any control over being twitter to keep this game kind of honest because there's no way to really control for that element.
00:44:14.284 - 00:44:38.924, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm kind of surprised that, like, friends team is at 135 mil. I guess, like, it obviously had that explosion. I think that was near one of our first episodes, like, we ever recorded in the summer, which is crazy. It's almost been a year since we started. This does not feel like that. But it was like, last summer we did an episode when friend tech was exploding. I remember talking to you guys about that.
00:44:38.924 - 00:45:22.574, Speaker C: But now, like, the airdrop is over, it'll be really interesting to see if people still use it or, like, more groups get created. I think a lot of people, you know, created groups back then and then kind of, like, slowly fell off, like, but they also felt like a weird obligation that, like, people bought their keys that were, like, expensive. So, like, a weird obligation to, like, keep posting. But then, like, a lot of people fell off. It seems like in the new update, Jose, you probably know more than me, but, like, there's different pricing models. There's, like, bigger groups, like, which I think address a lot of the issues initially because it just got so expensive for, like, the common person to join a group, and now it seems like they've made, like, custom price curves. So it can be more of, like, a bigger group.
00:45:22.574 - 00:45:33.178, Speaker C: But it'll be interesting to see if activity, like, continues on that. Now that the airdrop's over, obviously the kind of attention is shifted to fantasy top because there's a potential airdrop there.
00:45:33.226 - 00:46:04.108, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah, I guess I'd split them into, like, crypto socials. There's maybe lens, Farcaster, friendtech, and now fantasy top. Right? And I'd say, like, Lenz and Farcaster are a little bit more. Maybe this is unfair, but a little bit more skeuomorphic. And they look more like the traditional social media. But, like, you know, you have this. I mean, I think Farcaster is really cool, decentralized social graph, and you have the frames you can build on top of and stuff.
00:46:04.108 - 00:46:22.102, Speaker A: But I do think there's something interesting about both frontech and fantasy top in that they tap into this speculative crypto element, which I think is, for better or for worse, gonna be, like, a necessity to have a crypto app really succeed. The friendtech, like, I'm long friends, so, you know, take everything with it.
00:46:22.118 - 00:46:25.634, Speaker B: With disclosure. Yeah, I've never used that, though.
00:46:26.774 - 00:47:00.964, Speaker A: I used it. I think it's pretty underwhelming. Like, they had over six months, they generated, like, 50 million in fees and had all of, you know, crypto Twitter's attention to build the v two. And they basically shipped, like, these groups a token and a forked, like, in app amm, like, to some extent, you know, like, the backend went down on launch. There's, like, all sorts of kind of issues. I think they haven't grown the team very fast. So I think they have, like, something really special with, like, I bought, like, a lot of the blue chip keys on.
00:47:00.964 - 00:47:25.214, Speaker A: On launch, and most of those people are still active, like, respawning. They feel, like, some obligation to respond, and they also leak Alpha in a way that they don't on Twitter. Like, I think Kusaka first announced his Ina position to his friend tech followers. Right. And some of the other people that I. Whose keys I bought are also, like, they get asked pretty pointed, specific investment questions, and they're answering them. So there's clearly, like, something happening there.
00:47:25.214 - 00:47:38.088, Speaker A: I don't know if this is the team to capitalize on that, but I think they have enough of a movement behind them where. And, like, just, I feel like the friend tech Twitter is just, like, goated in terms of.
00:47:38.216 - 00:47:39.804, Speaker B: Yeah, they have a good twitter.
00:47:40.104 - 00:47:41.888, Speaker A: Yeah. Just like, so keeping.
00:47:41.936 - 00:47:51.736, Speaker B: Keeping those, like, main. I don't you want to call them kols. Keeping those main people engaged is obviously very important.
00:47:51.800 - 00:48:02.662, Speaker A: Most of them dumped, though. Right. Like, it was bizarre seeing all these people, four figures, like, on some of them, like, four or five figures on chain. Like, rushing to dump. Like, it's been a hard.
00:48:02.718 - 00:48:03.794, Speaker D: A lot of larps.
00:48:04.134 - 00:48:16.074, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of it'll be like, I really want to see with especially the bigger groups and the cheaper pricing, like, some non crypto people make a group.
00:48:16.654 - 00:48:20.998, Speaker B: I think Grayson Allen is, like, made one. I think I saw that he's pretty crypto he's.
00:48:21.046 - 00:48:22.754, Speaker D: He's been in crypto for a while, though.
00:48:23.144 - 00:48:24.968, Speaker C: Yeah, like, that.
00:48:25.136 - 00:48:37.576, Speaker D: It's hard to rationalize non crypto users participating, though, whereas. Right, because, like, what's the. What's the benefit versus just making a group chat if you're non crypto kind of thing.
00:48:37.760 - 00:48:39.888, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point, but.
00:48:40.056 - 00:48:45.464, Speaker D: But, like, yeah, so that's why I struggle, like, with the Frentex stuff where it looks too much.
00:48:45.544 - 00:49:01.926, Speaker C: Like the infrastructure could be cool, like, versus a group chat. You know what I mean? Like, a group that you gotta, like, manually add, remove. They're paying, like, subscriptions over time. It could be like a one time fee. It'll kick you out if you sell your thing. Like, you're automatically in there. But.
00:49:01.926 - 00:49:16.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sure there's solutions for that and web, too, but it's just like, that would make me excited. It'll be. It'll be interesting to see what happens after the fantasy top, like, air drops over, if, like, attention shifts back or if it goes to something new.
00:49:16.884 - 00:49:57.616, Speaker D: It's dependent on where there's money to be made. Right. Like, the reason friend tech, you had both the first order way, which was buying and selling keys, and then the longer term airdrop that people were engaging for. Whereas with fancy top, I think there's less people playing right now for the airdrop, but more, because there's, I think, more alpha to be had and more edge to be made if you. You're really into weeds and trying to figure out, you know, who's. Who's cheap and you're playing with these packs. And I think there's a lot more to do on fantasy top and.
00:49:57.616 - 00:50:12.930, Speaker D: And which is, which kind of adds to the argument that I think it's going to be hard for crypto socials that look too similar to web. They're like web two counterpart.
00:50:13.122 - 00:50:15.930, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's it.
00:50:15.962 - 00:50:16.338, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:16.426 - 00:50:37.538, Speaker B: Points for engagement, though, right? Which is maybe not the best. I've also had, like, five people steal something that I made because I think they're trying to get engagement. That fantasy points and stuff. No, I don't know. It's. It's weird incentives, because also, whenever you. You pay for engagement, which I guess Twitter does too.
00:50:37.538 - 00:50:47.974, Speaker B: Right. Um, it's just you don't get. You don't get the best truth, like, most truthful, honest content when you're paying for engagement.
00:50:48.554 - 00:50:49.362, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:49.538 - 00:51:14.214, Speaker B: Because, like, it's. I mean, like, if I wanted to, it's pretty easy to, like, know the formula of how to get, like, a lot of impressions and a lot of people liking and like, retweeting your stuff. Right. But it's just dumb. It's just like dumb fluff and bullshit most of the time. Right. So that's the problem with, like the model.
00:51:14.514 - 00:51:22.826, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, want to do FTX quickly before we wrap up or altcoin corner? We kind of sprinkled in an altcoin corner in the middle. What do you guys think?
00:51:22.970 - 00:51:30.954, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the sprinkling is. Unless there's a lot of stuff we haven't covered on the altcoin side, a better way to kind of go about it.
00:51:31.114 - 00:51:32.654, Speaker A: What do you think, gem Hunter?
00:51:35.034 - 00:51:36.654, Speaker C: I think.
00:51:40.634 - 00:51:41.454, Speaker A: All right.
00:51:45.074 - 00:51:46.134, Speaker D: Trump's good.
00:51:47.914 - 00:51:51.642, Speaker C: And Jose showed friend and what else? You showed something else?
00:51:51.818 - 00:51:54.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Ceteris, when are you going to show something?
00:51:54.624 - 00:51:56.456, Speaker B: Said I own showing is I own the front.
00:51:56.520 - 00:51:57.808, Speaker A: Oh, you own friend too? That's two.
00:51:57.856 - 00:52:00.792, Speaker C: That's what you own. Anything else that was mentioned?
00:52:00.928 - 00:52:02.904, Speaker B: Yeah, Vanguard.
00:52:02.984 - 00:52:04.684, Speaker D: He's 100% friend.
00:52:09.264 - 00:52:44.510, Speaker A: All right, so FTX announced their creditor plan. The TLDR of that is basically that if you had less than 50k, you're going to get 118% back within 60 days of the plan being confirmed, which I've seen some estimates. It's like Q 120 25 and this is about 96% of customers. And then if you have more than that, it's. I had it written somewhere. I can't find it now, but it's slightly more basically. And the TLDR is the government claims.
00:52:44.510 - 00:53:16.434, Speaker A: Like if you guys remember, the DOJ and the SEC all piled in once FTX went bankrupt with like ridiculous claims of what they wanted and like tax that was unpaid and stuff, those got subordinated to everyone else, which is exactly as it should be. And preferred equity and FTT both got zero. Darn hilariously, FTT pumped super hard off the news. It was like on the 8 May, it's like a bunch of people got, I don't know, it was really funny.
00:53:16.474 - 00:53:20.934, Speaker C: Clarity pump and it's still on binance.
00:53:21.274 - 00:53:33.386, Speaker A: It's still like, I think it's 400 million or something. Market cap. Let me check. No, it's 540 million market cap when FTT is out.
00:53:33.410 - 00:53:36.614, Speaker D: Before most of crypto traders.
00:53:38.874 - 00:53:46.936, Speaker A: And yeah, it was on the 8 May it was announced and then it like pumped like 40% or something or 30% that day.
00:53:46.960 - 00:54:18.252, Speaker B: But I mean, let's talk about like, is this going to be a big stimulus when it. Yeah, these. Because I think it's so far away. There's a lot of people that sold their claims at like 1020 non crypto. But you know these people that just buy claims as like a trade and then if for a lot of them, like if you, if you sold your claim at like 1020 cents and then you just like bought soul, then how.
00:54:18.268 - 00:54:19.504, Speaker C: Many people did that?
00:54:20.604 - 00:54:39.874, Speaker B: I mean, FTX, like had a lot of soul people on it. Right? So, no, but my point is, like, it's probably not as big of a stimulus as people are expecting because a lot of that is going to go to these people who are just buying claims. Right. And they're not going to like deploy into the market.
00:54:40.414 - 00:55:09.816, Speaker D: Yeah, I think you had a decent, yeah, you had some selling, like, you had some real panic selling in the like sub $0.30 price range, like 10, 20, 30. That was basically immediately. That's probably funds where lP's needed. Like, yeah, we're just like, get us anything back and had to do that. Um, because it's really hard to rationalize selling at that value. Right.
00:55:09.816 - 00:55:41.996, Speaker D: Like at that point you might as well. I feel like it just makes sense to, to hold out for some clarity. Um, because what is $0.10 on the dollar really going to offer you? Um, and then I think you had a decent amount of selling in the forties and fifties for sure, where, you know, this was actually like a meaningful amount. And you can, if you think the markets are going to heat up, the opportunity cost is massive. And so I do think you had a decent amount of selling because of opportunity cost. That whole 96% thing, that's of customers but not of money.
00:55:41.996 - 00:56:26.204, Speaker D: Right. And that's what really matters. Like 96% times a bunch of small accounts is a meaningless amount of money, whereas it's like, it really boils down to the larger peeps and kind of what they're doing. That being said, I do think there was a decent amount of selling and it'll kind of continue dripping around. Right. It's just funds that are basically, because now it's selling at like $0.90. What if I need to hold for seven months? Because it's basically like arbing, not arbing because there's different levels of risk, but it's just like distressed funds that are where their mandate is to return, you know, low teens percent or something like that on an annualized basis.
00:56:26.204 - 00:56:46.468, Speaker D: And this is part of what they do. So I think you'll still continue seeing that there's definitely going to be some distros whenever some kind of stimulus whenever that happens. But I think it's been kind of sprinkled throughout rather than being this one lumpy stim. Yeah, middle of next year.
00:56:46.556 - 00:57:04.864, Speaker C: Because if, you know, like, if you are eventually gonna put this money back into crypto and, you know, you're not going to get it for seven months, like, and there's pretty clear clarity that it's going to be what's going to be returned. It's like, why wouldn't you sell it now? It's like if you're bullish on crypto, you're going to put it in. You probably think stuff's going to go up more than 10%.
00:57:04.904 - 00:57:31.936, Speaker A: I mean, as a claim holder, it's just like annoying to go through the process, honestly. Like, it's just. Yeah, I haven't really. I looked into it a while ago and it was, seemed really annoying to go through. Maybe now it's easier, but I think it's like, my claim is decent, like size, and still I'm not really incentivized to go look into it because, yes, I assume there's a lot of lazy people in the same boat. I don't know.
00:57:32.000 - 00:58:27.976, Speaker D: There's lazy. And then, yeah, I have an unfortunately large claim, but there's also not all claims are treated equally. And it's a very PvP environment because there's a finite amount of money. And so, you know, every dollar that they can hold for you, for various reasons, they will attempt to. And so I think you had one interesting, one useful, I think, point would be to see, you know, what percentage of claims are in a clean standing, and it's all public, so you can kind of do the math on the claim size and what standing it's in. And if it's in good standing, you can probably assume with some high level of confidence that it was sold. And then it's the ones that have weird quirks and other things that are going to be pretty big hurdles on the selling process.
00:58:27.976 - 00:58:44.094, Speaker D: And speaking personally to that, I think those are where most of the stimmy can potentially be. So if somebody wants to go and do some of that math, or you just scrape all of these PDF's, you probably get a good estimate of how much has been sold.
00:58:44.594 - 00:59:15.486, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be interesting for sure. And also worth noting, the lawyers got paid $1.5 billion, which is, to me, just insane. Yeah, I mean, I've tried to think about it a bit like what they could be doing. Yeah, I know. I've had, unfortunately, through the years in crypto dealt with, and we have at Delphi, like, spent a good amount of money on lawyers. And to me, I have to say, it's the most broken industry I've ever interacted with.
00:59:15.486 - 00:59:43.424, Speaker A: Like, you literally have. You just get sent, like, how many hours they spent on things. You're paying for the top law firms, like thousands of dollars an hour. You have zero transparency. You're often, like, paying them to basically learn to teach them about crypto, like to tell, explain, like, very basic concepts to them. They're billing you for all of that. They're billing you for time spent reading emails, like by the minute.
00:59:43.424 - 01:00:09.940, Speaker A: And they just have no incentive, really. Like, this model of getting paid per hour creates the reverse incentive for efficiency. Right. You just end up paying out absurd amounts for things that aren't clear upfront. And I've also been just like really unimpressed with their work, honestly. Like, the quality of their work. Like, even in some of these defenses, like, I don't know, the, we never talked about it, but I thought the TFL case, maybe we should speak about at some point like that.
01:00:09.940 - 01:00:34.706, Speaker A: I thought the defense was pretty terrible there. I thought the SPF defense wasn't super great either. And yeah, these people are making, like, in this case, in the case of the FTX bankruptcy, like one and a half billion dollars for what seems like basically an administrative job. Right. You're just finding all the assets and selling them. Like, how is this.
01:00:34.730 - 01:00:36.866, Speaker D: And they did a horrible job at that too, by the way.
01:00:36.970 - 01:00:37.682, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:37.858 - 01:01:17.882, Speaker D: Like, there's some of the, like, the amount of money that was lost on some of these sales to, you know, timing is one thing. Right? Like, everyone has poor timing sometimes and it's so much easier to judge that in hindsight. But others that were, you know, there's a rush sale at a discount just to get it out the door when there was no other sense of urgency for anything else. Made no sense. Right. Like, why are we urgent on something that needs that? Like you can actually extract more if you're patient with. And then very, you know, slow on, on kind of the, the other sides.
01:01:17.882 - 01:01:28.514, Speaker D: Yeah. Like if you do the math on, on how much was spent per hour through the. The life of this thing is, is just egregious. Like there's this. There's no way to rationalize even the ten.
01:01:28.554 - 01:01:35.298, Speaker C: Yeah. Don't let you calculate like, how long it's been and do it per hour. The 1.5 billion or what it's been like a year.
01:01:35.426 - 01:02:16.656, Speaker A: And this is where, this is where I'm way more bullish, decentralized governance than, than most people. Because you realize that, like, governance in general is just hard. And the thing with decentralized governance is you see it and so you see all the chaos. But like with this stuff, it's like these guys were getting liquidated on Aave, right? Like, that's the part we could see like the tip of the iceberg that we could see. I imagine the hours and hours of waste that were spent in the background with this. And I honestly think a decentralized governance process would have done a better job like picking like handling this. Even when you see, like, especially the mature communities like Maker and Ave, I don't know, like the governance is really hard.
01:02:16.656 - 01:02:47.868, Speaker A: And when you see this kind of stuff, when you see Congress discuss things and like all the lemmings there, it just. Yeah, I do think there's, there's room for, for a better system here. It would be interesting to see like what would happen in a. Because we haven't really had a DeFi protocol with significant bad debt where, like, where you really have to decide because at that point, like, it's the governance token holders have control. Right. Have governance control. Like in the case of AAVE or something, they'd be like pretty significantly diluted to make depositors whole.
01:02:47.868 - 01:02:53.364, Speaker A: And it'll be interesting to see whether they would act in the benefit of the protocol or in their own benefit.
01:02:53.484 - 01:02:55.784, Speaker C: But probably their own benefit.
01:02:56.124 - 01:02:59.528, Speaker B: Well, I mean, what's the token going to be worth if they don't do it?
01:02:59.676 - 01:03:02.324, Speaker A: It depends on the size of the ho, I guess.
01:03:02.904 - 01:03:08.296, Speaker B: I don't know. Why would you ever use Aave again? If they voted against your interest as a depositor?
01:03:08.440 - 01:03:10.112, Speaker A: It could theoretically be done programmatically.
01:03:10.168 - 01:03:10.336, Speaker D: Right.
01:03:10.360 - 01:03:33.616, Speaker A: Like there's some oracle that identifies whether there's been bad debt and then governance control just shifts to, like the a token holders, you know, like, and now all the depositors are locked and they have governance power proportional to their, to their holdings and they vote for, you know, who they want to distribute these. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like there's, there's a lot of inefficiency in this, in these bankruptcy processes and with legal industry generally.
01:03:33.680 - 01:03:47.592, Speaker C: Yes, I just did the math. It's 550 days since the FTX bankruptcy, so that's 2.7 million a day in lawyer, lawyer fees. If it's 1.5 billion over 100k an hour.
01:03:47.768 - 01:03:50.616, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a lot of.
01:03:50.760 - 01:03:51.844, Speaker C: Way cheaper.
01:03:52.764 - 01:03:53.784, Speaker A: All right, let's.
01:03:54.364 - 01:03:55.544, Speaker D: Thanks, Duncan.
01:03:56.364 - 01:03:59.744, Speaker B: Well, they had to learn how to use their masks. That's like a couple.
01:04:01.604 - 01:04:05.104, Speaker D: They also just got like hacked and stuff too, is ridiculous.
01:04:06.724 - 01:04:15.292, Speaker A: Hacked, liquidated, everything there's definitely seven figures paid for. People spending hours learning to use metamask more.
01:04:15.348 - 01:04:17.772, Speaker D: What else is there to do? What else is there to do?
01:04:17.868 - 01:04:18.332, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:18.428 - 01:04:20.064, Speaker C: 2.7 million a day.
01:04:20.204 - 01:04:22.344, Speaker D: Yeah, it definitely took them a couple of weeks.
01:04:22.424 - 01:04:29.484, Speaker A: It's fucking wild. Looking for liquidation, bankruptcy services. Altcoin gem Hunter is branching out.
01:04:30.784 - 01:04:32.364, Speaker D: He's studying for his bar.
01:04:34.464 - 01:04:43.424, Speaker A: All right, guys, I think we. Yeah, I think let's. Let's wrap it there. Thanks very much. I think it was a good episode. See you again in two weeks.
01:04:43.504 - 01:04:44.164, Speaker B: Bye.
