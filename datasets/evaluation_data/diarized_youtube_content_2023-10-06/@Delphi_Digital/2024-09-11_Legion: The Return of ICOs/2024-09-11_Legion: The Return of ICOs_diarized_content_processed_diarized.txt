00:00:01.400 - 00:00:03.725, Speaker A: You're now plugged into the Delphi Podcast.
00:00:05.105 - 00:00:31.865, Speaker B: Hi guys. Jose Maria Mercedu here. Today I'm hosting an episode of the Delphi Podcast where I'm joined by Matty and Fab from Legion. Legion is a really exciting project. It's one we've been incubating with labs for nearly two years and recently came out of stealth. So it's been a long time, long time coming. Their goal is super ambitious and also somewhat controversial to bring back ICOS or make ICOS great again.
00:00:31.865 - 00:01:02.567, Speaker B: In this conversation we're going to discuss the current market structure and what's wrong with it, go through the history of how we got here, including ICOs, like the original 2017 ICOs, and then how Legion looks to improve on both the current market structure and the OG ICO issues. So should be a good one, guys. Very happy to have you here. Maybe to start with, you can introduce yourselves for people and give people a little bit of your background, what Legion is and kind of why you decided to work on it.
00:01:02.631 - 00:01:23.315, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Thanks for having us. Looking forward to this podcast today for sure. I'll kick it off with a quick personal background. So Fabrizio is my name. Originally comp Sci background, worked in consulting for a while, worked in freelance for a while, worked at startups for a while, then went full time crypto founder in defi space. I think maybe to touch on why I'm sort of interested in this domain.
00:01:23.315 - 00:02:06.725, Speaker C: Growing up, I guess to cut a long story short, I grew up broke, living off food stamps, moving between different countries, different households, not having access at the place I was in, at least considered normal access. I think to some degree, I sort of, from very young age, for better or worse, grew sort of a hatred for systems that locked people out before they even had a chance. I always sort of associated myself with the underdog. And I thought to myself, like, okay, even though I can have the same axis, I need to work harder. When I was like 10, I stopped eating desserts, cake, sugar. I stopped watching TV when I was 11 and I'd allocate all my time to work harder, work harder, work harder just to get on that same equal padding. And I think this is where I fell in love with crypto is the idea of literally you have Internet connection and you have desire.
00:02:06.725 - 00:02:41.765, Speaker C: You can make anything happen. It doesn't matter where you live, doesn't matter your race, your gender, your location. This idea of decentralization, this idea of democratization. I think it's like I drew a lot of that and that super motivated me. What I touched on before, obviously I've been a founder, I've been an investor, I've been a network participant. I've sort of seen capital formation from a lot of different angles. I think this speaks to me in the sense that right now I believe it's a very broken system and I'm super motivated by bringing in that democratization of access back and doing it in a way that's beneficial for projects, beneficial for investors and more beneficial for long term outcomes.
00:02:41.905 - 00:02:45.305, Speaker B: That's awesome. I didn't even know all that. That's super cool.
00:02:45.605 - 00:03:10.715, Speaker A: Yeah. Pretty intense. Pretty intense background. I'm not going to try to match it obviously. But for myself before crypto, professional background in traditional finance, like many people was at Radiality Hedge Fund, Bridgewater Associates. And I think they're also an element of noticed how just hyper specialized and inaccessible the traditional finance market is. Right.
00:03:10.715 - 00:03:45.179, Speaker A: Especially coming from seeing my friends who have gone from public high school, the level of financial literacy they had versus the people I was interacting on a daily basis. There's just this wide gap. And so after about three years of Bridgewater, burned out on finance, spent some time as a data scientist, Web2 Machine Learning founder, raised VC myself. But throughout that time I've been investing in crypto since 2015. And some of my favorite memories, all time thinking back to it, are those 2017, 2018 ICOs. Right. Even the ones I lost money on, to be honest.
00:03:45.179 - 00:04:20.027, Speaker A: Right. Just a fun time to be in crypto. Just a great way to get involved. And it grew the industry so much. Obviously there were excesses, we'll get into that. But I loved that time and I've worked now for multiple projects in the space that have done ICOs, including some of the largest ICOs at the time, including some of the first and only SEC qualified ICOs for stacks, which is the top 50 project these days. So I've seen the power that comes from die hard communities that are born from ICOs and I think that's the piece that's missing from modern token distributions.
00:04:20.027 - 00:04:38.591, Speaker A: And I've done a lot of work, written a whole open source guide around token distributions and designing tokens that's gotten a lot of good reviews. And so I was really excited to join Fabrizio in fixing this problem because I think if teams can can build an organic community and leverage them, then they can really achieve anything.
00:04:38.743 - 00:04:52.715, Speaker C: Yeah. Underrated co founder. I think all the time, always at conferences everyone's like oh you're meditokenomics. I read your book I love it. So, yeah, and I think, yeah, to state the obvious, we are both the two co founders, obviously we've got a broader team, but.
00:04:53.775 - 00:05:17.165, Speaker B: Very cool. Yeah. This leads us nicely onto the, onto the next question, which I think to understand ICOs, you kind of need to really understand the current meta, how it works and really what's wrong with it. So could you kind of walk us through what's the standard way that the best projects right now are like raising money and then launching their token? And why is that broken?
00:05:17.985 - 00:06:08.435, Speaker C: Yeah, I could take that one. So, yeah, I mean there's sort of this unspoken playbook for the best projects and there's also probably a spoken playbook for the, for the average projects. We can maybe touch on both. But I think on the good project side of things, it's like it almost always starts off with, you know, venture capital, typically significant amounts of venture capital at a low valuation, early days and then most essentially of the price discovery happening in the private markets for, you know, the pre seed round, the seed round and so on. Like this complete opposite of what I mentioned before. You know, I fell in love with crypto for the idea of like democratization. At any stage in getting involved, typically raising lots of financial capital, then teams will mostly run some sort of points program or some sort of incentive essentially that enables them to show that they've got a lot of adoption for whatever it might be, the right reasons or the wrong reasons, and then they can use that adoption.
00:06:08.435 - 00:06:49.931, Speaker C: And plus the capital that I've already raised to negotiate with centralized exchanges, ideally on a day one listing, also engage with a market maker. They give the market maker typically a lot of the float so they can control the price and manipulate it. And then on top of that, market makers typically have no fees trading on the centralized exchange. Now what we briefly mentioned on before is a lot of the private market price discovery happens, which leads to these sort of inflated FTVs. So obviously continuing the valuations up and up and up and up. By the time they actually go public, retail gets to buy in at typically at the highest valuations that these market makers are typically sustaining for a short period of time. That leads to after that ongoing vesting foundries.
00:06:49.931 - 00:07:38.943, Speaker C: Venture capitals essentially continues to push the token market cap down over time. This leads again to capital rich, especially good for the early, but also typically community poor, essentially the evangelist, the typical end user of the product. They are getting absolutely burned. And I think you see today a lot of, maybe hate is not the right word, but dismay with the current meta and setup Being on the retail investor side because at the end of the day that kills adoption and projects ability to scale from the earliest stages. I guess why is this even important in the first place? I'm a firm believer that working in disruptive innovation, it's not just about the tech. You also need some sort of community or early supporters to push that forward. I think there's that adoption curve where you talk about super early innovators and then leading to the early adopters.
00:07:38.943 - 00:08:25.645, Speaker C: I think it's like if you can galvanize those community supporters behind you, you can essentially create an unforkable moat, which again is atypical of crypto. But communities are super powerful in that track. I guess on the other side, the projects that probably can't raise from high quality venture capitalists, they have two different options. One is don't raise any capital and then try to purely bootstrap an idea or give up on it. And the other one is try to find capital from anywhere which might be much lower class venture capitalists that add no value or looking just to flip, treat it purely as a financial exchange or they'll basically take an idea to these public launchpads. They're decentralized, they're not gatekeeped by anyone. You can launch a token but the issue with that is they're unregulated, they have worse exposure.
00:08:25.645 - 00:09:06.934, Speaker C: Projects that do that almost never make it to the same tier as a binance launched token. Then that essentially leads them to raising less. It hinders growth because of regulation issues. They can't get list on centralized exchanges and it creates this negative feedback loop where price performs. And on top of these decentralized launchpads, essentially because you have a lot of projects that are lower quarterly raising on them that leads to attracting lower quality community members where they either in it for two reasons. One, they're just going to invest in every single sale, hope one makes enough money so they can exit. Or two, there's some sort of information asymmetry or misunderstanding of the current setup that people come and invest in and they don't understand why token price is going down.
00:09:06.934 - 00:09:30.345, Speaker C: That's like super high level. Touching on the current meta again, I think Maddie touched on this before. It's like there's a complete lack of community building through that process only to the end stage. And to be honest, it's probably pretty good for the insiders, it's pretty good for the early investors, but not so good for the retail investors or people are getting access at that later stages. Especially not good for the long term success of a project.
00:09:30.845 - 00:10:28.919, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great description. So to summarize, if you're a high quality project, you're going to raise VC from some brand name VCs, you're going to raise like progressively higher priced rounds and then you're going to basically raise one right before you're planning to go public with your token at some valuation that leaves enough upside for those VCs that they feel like they can squeeze out of public markets then. Day one centralized exchange listing. We've seen this over and over, over the last year. Huge volume, like huge valuation and sort of it's kind of down only from there for most of them, right? Where there's just unlocks, whether it's like airdrop unlocks. And obviously the airdrop is another big part of this, right. That you sort of touched on, which is when you go live, you don't have an ICO or a way to distribute tokens, so you have to give them away for free with a zero cost basis to these participants that may or may not have added value to the network.
00:10:28.919 - 00:11:11.205, Speaker B: Like normally for some projects there's a way to do it where you do it to people who did add some value. But for a lot of them it's just like I need to give away tokens to get some float. So I'm going to do this airdrop. Then it goes live, goes sort of down only as unlocks happen. And then for the projects that can't do that, that can't get centralized exchange listings or legally conscious or whatever they're doing Dex listings or if they're even worse, I guess going through some of these launchpads and that as the performance has been terrible on those two and even the good projects you do, Dex listings I think have underperformed quite a lot. And yeah, the nature of Dex listings also makes it super hard to get to centralized exchanges. Right.
00:11:11.205 - 00:11:26.855, Speaker B: Because it's hard to fake volume on a Dex. And so you always look like you're trading not fake volume. I don't want to say like market makers are faking volume. It's just the way the incentives are set up on a Dex versus a centralized exchange just makes it way less attractive to have high volumes on.
00:11:28.675 - 00:11:53.363, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say previously, I think that's spot on previously. As mentioned before, founding projects speaking to market makers and people that help with listings, they essentially like, yeah, whatever you do, don't launch Nadex because you can't control the price as well. You can't show enough Volume, the centralized exchanges, they want two things. They want new users to come and onboard. And then we're gonna see significant amounts of volume because that's what drives their incentive. Right. More volume, more revenue for them.
00:11:53.363 - 00:11:59.815, Speaker C: And yeah, I mean, you don't typically get that on the decentralized exchange. So as you said, very difficult to go from dex to sex.
00:12:00.195 - 00:12:14.605, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting. Okay, and so how do ICOs, how does legion fix this? Like, at a very high level. We're gonna dive into it more later on, but yeah, why does ICOS kind of fix this? Meta.
00:12:14.755 - 00:12:49.199, Speaker A: Yeah. Speak to that. I mean, I think at a high level, what is missing, as we've mentioned, is community involvement. And we touched on multiple aspects of this, including an airdrop being kind of like this almost afterthought way of trying to involve community. And I think the way to solve this is to not make community an afterthought, to make it more central. And so if you speak to anyone who's probably spoken to hundreds of teams about their token distribution strategy, how they view a public sale, an ico, the number one blocker is regulatory compliance risks. Right.
00:12:49.199 - 00:13:23.159, Speaker A: Shouldn't be a shocker to anyone. Teams, if you can raise from VCs, the risk of alternatively going and raising from retail people and taking on regulatory risk is just super high. The risk reward doesn't make sense for higher quality teams. And so the number one thing Legion does to fix this is regulatory compliance. We get into the specifics. We'll be operating under Mika new regulation in the EU markets and crypto assets, and Legion handles all this compliance for you. So it's not like we're just saying, oh, projects, you know, here's a million steps you need to complete in order to work with us.
00:13:23.159 - 00:14:03.681, Speaker A: No, we've got the kyc, you know, of our users handled for you. We've got a license ourselves. That aspect is then handled for projects so that they can launch tokens with relatively less risk. But the other piece of this is if you want to distribute tokens to community in an authentic, meaningful way and do so alongside VCs, not just as this afterthought. After VCs, then projects need to know that they're actually getting value from those retail investors. Right. They can't just be getting with that like a bunch of bots, a bunch of sybils, a bunch of people who just plan to dump the token as soon as they buy it.
00:14:03.681 - 00:14:51.863, Speaker A: And so we also have built out this layer for investor reputation and accountability so that the projects can filter down and say These are the types of people, these are the types of things I want in my community. Filter to investors that have those aspects, maybe give extra allocation to them, maybe customize a discount for them. Right? They have the power to do whatever they want to assemble their specific legion of investors and then bring that community in and hold them accountable. Delivering value long term. And we're going to get into it. But if they don't add value, right, if they're just there for the wrong reason for short term, then they will lose out on future opportunities. So that accountability and that compliance really shifts the incentives and allows higher quality projects to give larger portions of their tokens to community.
00:14:51.863 - 00:15:04.799, Speaker A: Build out a community at early days and that's going to be product advocates, you know, evangelists, people pushing the project forward from day one. I think that's the biggest, the biggest change. I don't know. Fab, if you have anything to add to that.
00:15:04.967 - 00:15:43.835, Speaker C: No, I think it's spot on to be honest. I think like, yeah, just to be super clear, we're definitely not anti VC or anti retail. I think the way I think about it, my mental model is more like, rather than being like venture capital or retail or dumb money or whatever it might be, I look at it on a scale. It's like there's certain people and certain entities that add value, like value creators and then there's certain entities that extract value. I think it's like for us, we kind of look at it like, okay, how can we flip the script to understand how can we maximize the value per dollar invested for these projects to essentially ensure that they get set up with success with high quality network participants, high quality venture capitalists, whatever it might be. So I think like again, both add value. There's both good.
00:15:43.835 - 00:15:51.655, Speaker C: There's some really bad, there's some bad retail, there's some good. We kind of again, flip the switch, focus on optimizing for value add network participants.
00:15:52.915 - 00:16:32.125, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like that thing you guys say how you know, your first 10 hires or whatever make the culture at your, at your company and your first hundred community members set the culture of your community. Made a lot of sense to me when you first said that. And it's like it sort of like bears the point home of why would you give away your token to random people? Or even like with the traditional ICOs, why would you just let anyone buy and make price the only, the only sort of like what the price you're willing to pay. The only condition to being able to participate in your project. Right. It really doesn't make sense, especially early on. Um, yeah.
00:16:32.125 - 00:17:19.851, Speaker B: And then the regulatory point, we're definitely going to dive into it more, especially as we go through the history of kind of ICOs. But that was really important, right. I remember when Gabe first told me like two years ago about MKA and how this thing creates a framework for ICOs and it's sort of regulation is what originally, because I think if you have to summarize like the kind of problems with ICOs, I just say like adverse selection, right? Like all the, all the kind of problems on the demand side and supply side come from that. And regulation sort of killed ICOs, made the adverse selection really bad. Like only the scam projects really could take the risk. And now I think regulation is going to bring ICOs back and you guys are going to hopefully fix the issues with traditional ICOs. So speaking of that, how did we get here? Like we had ICOs in 2017, right? We raised hundreds of millions.
00:17:19.851 - 00:17:31.225, Speaker B: All of us were here for that. Can you tell us a bit? Can you walk us through the history of ICOs? What was good about them, what was bad about them? Why did they go away?
00:17:32.085 - 00:18:05.745, Speaker C: Yeah, I can touch on that, I guess. Super high level. First ICO, actually Mastercoin back in 2013 by Willett. There's actually this killer old school video you can find on YouTube now, back at an old bitcoin conference where he's talking about this idea to a crowd where he's saying, I've been trying to tell people you don't need to just go to Silicon Valley and raise from venture capital. If you have an idea and you have a group of respectable developers, you can say, okay, everyone that buys this token will own a piece of what we're building. And anyone can do that. I think it's such a powerful change of momentum there.
00:18:05.745 - 00:18:47.109, Speaker C: Obviously Vitalik 2014, the ETH, ICO and then I think macro conditions as well as BTC I guess maybe probably caused BTC and ETH started pumping. People started reinvesting the gains, seeing like the eth, ICO worked. And plus a lot more interesting use cases being built on top of Ethereum. ICO sort of like rose to provenance in 2017, 18, et cetera, and started making mainstream media. I guess you can definitely argue that it was crypto's first killer app. Maybe the app that enabled the people that involved crypto to scale by a magnitude or more. And I think that's kind of like really high level, brief periods running up to that before touching.
00:18:47.109 - 00:19:19.529, Speaker C: Beyond that, I want to say ICOs again they were paradigm shifting financial instruments. It's like anyone. Again like I touched before you have Internet access, you have at least some capital. It could be 0.1 of an ETH to 10 ETH. You can participate the earliest stages and obviously tokenization according real world behavior at scale is one of its superpowers. The ICO essentially was a super effective way to distribute that alignment among again a lot of different individuals that aren't just receiving the token for free, but they're actually fronting up capital, which again there's like a lot of different psychological biases you can get into.
00:19:19.529 - 00:20:00.371, Speaker C: They feel a lot more sense of ownership. You've got a lot of people with the primary incentive alignment of tokenization. They're coming together again, individuals sharing common goal or identity that forms strong social bonds and that leads to more cooperation, more collective action, more positive reinforcement. And you have this like wild hyper accelerated loop of people coming together, bonding together, just on the Internet, different countries, et cetera for a common purpose. Token price go up, very easy primary incentive driver. So that kind of like continued to kick off at the same time you had democratizing access, which I touched on before. It's like there's no Silicon Valley boys club or there's no like, you know, you need to be based in a certain jurisdiction, like anywhere anyone could participate.
00:20:00.371 - 00:20:34.689, Speaker C: All the red tape was removed. There wasn't lengthy things you had to go through to get approval. You can literally just spin up an ico, see address, et cetera. And on top of that for the project especially is no longer were you restricted to a local capital market, but you had access to this global pool of capital which again was typically immense. I mean for United States for example, was world capitalized still for them it's impactful. But you can imagine coming from a third world country like the opportunity there was absolutely crazy. And I think it's like we kind of talk about like ICOs were so good that they became like crazy easy to abuse.
00:20:34.689 - 00:21:00.673, Speaker C: So I think, you know, thanks bitconnect Centra Pay a lot of scams. A lot of people recognize like wow, this is like a mental market. You don't even need to do anything. You can kind of come sell a dream and raise heaps of capital. Which kind of brings us to like the first two problems was around like absolute fraud. Like people weren't even trying, they were coming, trying to take as much money as possible next day, exit, keep things anonymous. And the second one was absolutely no accountability.
00:21:00.673 - 00:21:45.105, Speaker C: Even projects that were trying to do the right thing, they fell over, didn't do anything. Maybe the funds were captured by the foundation and then they could live off that foundation fund essentially for life and not be held accountable. I think it was 2017 after the DAO hack that the SEC had 21 a report on the DAO published and essentially a new chair, Jay Clayton came in. He essentially used that to say like okay, the DAO actually passed the Howey test. This is actually considered a financial instrument. Obviously there was a lot of public opinion because of the hack and that's kind of like what took it initially mainstream for the SEC to investigate. And this kind of introduced like a wave of regulation both on the fraud side and the non fraud.
00:21:45.105 - 00:22:39.295, Speaker C: This essentially led to again bands of different countries, the shutting down ICOs and if you look at a chart where it's basically vertical up and then vertical down the amount of ICOs that transition from the 18 to the 19 period and this had again a lot of second order effects. But this led to projects that again were high quality, said okay, definitely not going to take that risk to shut down the project. That kind of opened up a lot of the current meta where we are today. Private market investing, accredited investing, completely leaving out retail to the end stage or for the projects that couldn't even achieve that, they said okay, I'm happy to take a lot more risk on in the effort to raise in a decentralized way. Obviously KYC is too much. We're just going to go to market like this, et cetera. And to some degrees for these founders or projects they said we almost absolve ourselves of our entrepreneurial duty in the sense of like okay, it can't be revenue generating.
00:22:39.295 - 00:22:54.005, Speaker C: So if we're not going to be revenue generation, let's just ship a governance token or we'll just tell everyone like we're not even trying to build a revenue generated product. So I think like a lot of these tokens with no value capture as well kind of like led to this negative incentive which again was a second order effect of the regulation.
00:22:54.625 - 00:23:54.071, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, I mean when you talk about the positives of like community forming and people coming together on the Internet for everyone, for all of us who went through ICOs, it's kind of hard to remember that bit, right? You just remember like the when Moon kids on Telegram or whatever or I need price to go up right now, you know, all the memes that came from I am over invested by a lot like all the memes that came from ICO days. So yeah, I guess what do you see as the big cause? ICOs definitely had some issues with them, right? Like fraud was one of them. But I think they're. There are other issues too. Like projects that raised. I mean, one example I hate to hate on specific projects, but the golem one, right, where they raised like six years ago, I went to see, they're still in like, I think it's not even a beta, it's like something like less than a beta.
00:23:54.071 - 00:24:22.093, Speaker B: And they're sitting on like nine figures of eth in their treasury, right. And their descendants will forever live off this Swiss foundation, right? Like everyone's set for life. There's. And then there's, I think, other issues too. I'm curious, like, what do you think about that? Like, didn't they lead to a bunch of rugs? Like a bunch of Swiss foundations that are set for life? Like, whoa. Yeah. Is there a reason they went away in the first place?
00:24:22.149 - 00:24:55.703, Speaker A: I guess, yeah, it's a great question. Like, we have to acknowledge, right, that ICOs were not perfect and we are not advocating for a return, a copy paste return to 2017. This is an evolution of ICOs. So, yeah, to go through some of the most common problems and kind of how we think about mitigating them. Obviously, as you mentioned, fraud was a big, you know, the number one problem. And so better risk disclosures go a long way to that. Right? Like people actually being honestly told what the project is doing, who the team is, who's behind it.
00:24:55.703 - 00:25:23.353, Speaker A: Right. Having that transparency that back in the day an individual retail investor didn't really have, you know, a VC could go in and demand a meeting and get access and ask a bunch of questions. The average investor had no access, had no transparency into kind of the true risks and objectives for the project. So better risk disclosure, which comes partially from regulation, partially from quality control of our platform of the projects is key.
00:25:23.409 - 00:25:23.577, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:23.601 - 00:26:08.385, Speaker A: And so that quality control of, look, we're not investing in projects that cannot raise from top tier VCs. These are projects that are able to raise from top tier VCs and then intentionally also including or allocating to community because they see the value of doing that. And because of the second piece of investor reputation, which ensures that they're actually able to get valuable investors participating in their sale. And so the investor reputation piece also solves a lot of problems that the ICOs had because, sure, fraud was one of them, but also just really poor quality investors. Right. You had the gas wars, right, which was the term at the time for people just paying a bunch of Eth. Right.
00:26:08.385 - 00:26:33.051, Speaker A: Paying, bumping up their gas fee so that they could be the first into the sale contract. Right. And so. And then they win allocation. Right. So gas wars, it was literally just a race of first come, first serve, which is probably not the best sale mechanism if you're trying to attract, you know, the best quality investors. So instead you got a bunch of sniping bots, you got, you know, just sybils, you got industrial farms, you got people dumping the token.
00:26:33.051 - 00:27:16.755, Speaker A: And so that also is a big piece of the problem that we need to solve. It is solved around the investor reputation. And then there's aspects that you referred to Jose of the. Probably doesn't make sense for teams to be raising like 100 million all at once in one shot on a white paper. We think again, this is an evolution of ICOs where one of the relative benefits of VC rounds is that you're doing it in these progressive tranches, if you will. First you're raising 2 million maybe then you're raising 5 million, then once you've derisked and have a live product more, you're raising another 10 million. That aspect we think works better than raising 100 million all at once.
00:27:16.755 - 00:27:28.575, Speaker A: But you still need access to community. Right. So this is about an evolution, giving people access to each of those rounds, pre token or liquid token. Not just saying we're going to copy paste the 2017 model.
00:27:29.715 - 00:27:52.487, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. For me when I think about it and when I hear what you're saying, I just see sort of adverse selection all the way down. Right. Like with 2017 ICOs it pretty quickly became that as regulators began to go after them, like investors had to do so many things that made. Well, sorry. Like the.
00:27:52.487 - 00:28:06.599, Speaker B: There were so many things that, so many dynamics that made it so much worse for investors. Like. Yeah, first of all, what we talked about before, only the projects, like the really good projects can raise from vc. Why would they risk an SEC enforcement to do an ico? Right.
00:28:06.647 - 00:28:07.039, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:07.127 - 00:28:36.919, Speaker B: And then, and then the second bit, like the valueless token, all these founders that were that had to say their token was valueless, they couldn't put cash flows through it. Like all this stuff, you know, it made it so every token was just a medium of exchange kind of thing. And then on the demand side you have like. And this is what, like I think the investor reputation thing you guys are working on is so, so important. Just being able to pick your cap table because these auctions, like they work in economic terms to like price something like an oil.
00:28:36.967 - 00:28:37.223, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:37.279 - 00:28:54.315, Speaker B: Or like these things that they were designed for. But what they ensure is that only the people who are willing to pay the most get in. Right. And that's not necessarily what you want for your community. Like the people who are willing to pay the most aren't necessarily your best community members in fact.
00:28:55.215 - 00:28:56.271, Speaker A: Informed, right?
00:28:56.303 - 00:29:10.125, Speaker B: Like yeah, exactly. And they're going to have the highest expectations, they're the most annoying. So I really think like having the reputation score and being able to hand pick your cap table is such a big deal with this.
00:29:11.465 - 00:29:39.465, Speaker C: Yeah, there's definitely an interesting dynamic there where it's like in the private markets, right. It's like there's a two way opt in, right. You know, you vet the investor, an investor vets you, you come to like an exchange, you got an expectation what the future is going to look like, you know, the ups and downs, et cetera. Where in like the public markets you don't get that it's only one way. It's like everyone that's a project but the projects never get that opportunity to like as you said before, design what their ideal user base of token holders look like. Who do they want to share that incentive alignment with?
00:29:40.325 - 00:29:46.877, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And in this case it's sort of every sale becomes kind of semi public or semi private, however you want to think about it.
00:29:46.901 - 00:29:47.037, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:47.061 - 00:29:53.145, Speaker B: Because you get to choose. You could choose VCs, you can choose angels, you can choose your Legion.
00:29:53.605 - 00:30:04.395, Speaker A: And yeah, and projects can customize it. Right. They could say everybody gets $1,000 max allocation, but people who meet these criteria get a $10,000 max allocation, for example.
00:30:04.815 - 00:30:27.719, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Maybe we can go into the Legion score. Actually, should we start with. I think, I think it's worth starting with Mika just because of how important it is. Because I think this, none of this would be possible without a regulatory framework that allows projects to feel comfortable. They're not going to get enforcement letters for doing this. Right.
00:30:27.719 - 00:30:49.645, Speaker B: Like it just the past few years show that like ICOs just being a better mechanic was isn't enough to get them used because people don't want to get, get like you need regulatory compliance to be there. So could you talk a little bit about like Mika, how it works and like how this allows ICOs how projects can, what kind of investors can projects target? Like the whole, that whole thing.
00:30:50.585 - 00:31:41.575, Speaker C: Yeah, I can take that. And Matty, if you want to chime in as well, I mean like Mika, first off, Marco, encrypted market and crypto assets regulation, it's again EU wide. So European Union focused, but all countries, again, difference between regulation and individual countries, legislation, essentially, if you're going to sum it up, Mika is about appropriate disclosure. Is it the core thing that the whole reason Mika kind of exists today is they recognize that, like, okay, these crypto assets are actually. They're different things, they should be treated differently. Most important thing here is that there's some level of investor protection that people that do end up purchasing or participating in these sales have a good understanding of the risks that they're going into. Trying to remove that information asymmetry that was very prominent back in the ICO days, which I think in principle is fantastic, and we're very aligned with supporting that.
00:31:41.575 - 00:32:26.017, Speaker C: I think much like I talked about before, how you had regulation come in and completely change the incentive model for raising capital, capital formation, market structure in crypto, it's like now we're kind of approaching this new horizon where Mika is coming back in and trying to bring things back to making it again more accessible. So I think it's like a why now? And we'll touch on this a little bit more into the future. But it's a very pivotal moment for capital formation. A lot of people are kind of sick with the current meta. I think it's like, it hasn't been able to be changed, and without Mika, it won't be able to be changed. But again, appropriate disclosure allows projects from anywhere to raise from European citizens. Now, there's different type of exclusions, if you meet them or not, exemptions.
00:32:26.017 - 00:32:46.947, Speaker C: But typically you have to publish this thing called amica white paper. It's not a typical white paper that talks about, like, technical aspects. It's more of like, this is a roadmap. This is how we're going to allocate the capital, These are the risks, et cetera. Something, again, that should be widely available for investors to read and get to a good understanding. Does this make sense or not? I mean, there's like a few other things. You have to get an opinion that your token is not security.
00:32:46.947 - 00:33:23.549, Speaker C: EU has taken not a lax stance to this, but a whole lot more open stance to what they'd consider the equivalent of a financial instrument. It's been very, very friendly. And then on top of this, there are a few other bits and pieces such that there's a refund period of 14 days that you can say, okay, actually, I think I've made a bad decision. You want to avoid fomo, you can actually request a refund. Now, of course, all this we bake into the Legion product. So there's kind of two things. Like there's a time change now Mika is sort of opening the door for bringing in a new meta and then there's also the piece around needing support regulation.
00:33:23.549 - 00:33:51.635, Speaker C: I can tell you right now, I've never filled that as many forms of documents in my life than we have getting the licenses and moving forward on Mika. But again we handle all that now. The real benefit here comes from the fact that removing all the legal gray area but projects from anywhere can now raise from European investors with no need to have an accredited or approved investor status. It can literally be anyone in the EU can participate. And we think like that is super powerful.
00:33:54.375 - 00:34:11.535, Speaker B: That is super powerful. It is a little bit more burdensome right. When you're talking there a little bit more burdensome for the project founder. I guess you have to do this white paper. You have this refund period but the benefit is you can raise from. Yeah like maybe talk a bit about those trade offs.
00:34:11.995 - 00:34:59.555, Speaker A: There is that benefit but we do automate a lot of like that is kind of abstracted behind the scenes for people. So the refund period compliance for example, like that's handled by Legion itself. Right. And investors can request their refund. But given the mechanisms, mechanisms you're using, given the disclosures that are being made, given that you have this double opt in, as Fab mentioned, we don't anticipate that being a widely used option. This is more about people just fomoing in and instantly regretting it, which is going to be much more common in traditional ICO setting. We try to handle this as much as possible for teams upfront users are KYC'ed on our platform so you can pick from that pool.
00:34:59.555 - 00:35:21.855, Speaker A: You don't have to worry about integrating your own KYC or manage your own risk there. The refund is handled for people. And we've also partnered with service providers that can do things that are working on things like automating the generation of your Mika compliant white paper just to minimize that overhead as much as possible for teams.
00:35:22.515 - 00:35:39.545, Speaker B: And so who can you. Who can you reach with this? Then you can reach. Is it anyone in the EU or is it just accredited or the equivalent of accredited people that self certify as having over X net worth? And then what about the US and then the rest of the world? Maybe you could go in those three.
00:35:40.845 - 00:36:17.883, Speaker A: The EU doesn't use the term accredited but they have their equivalent of qualified investor and most jurisdictions around the world have some kind of term for what they would call, you know, sophisticated investors. Right. That separate you from a normal person. The nice thing about Mika, one of the biggest benefits is that it does not require you or limit you to only involving what they would call qualified investors. Right. They were equivalent of accredited investors. You can sell tokens, include anyone from the eu and Mika governs who you sell tokens to, not who is selling the tokens or where the tokens are coming from.
00:36:17.883 - 00:37:11.301, Speaker A: Right. So Mika says these are the sets of rules you need to follow if you want to sell tokens to persons in the eu, but does not require that the team or the entity issuing the token is a European team or located in Europe or anything like that. So you get this flexibility, you get this benefit and honestly you will. It will soon be a requirement, right, for projects that want to do this compliantly to be Mika compliant if they want to include EU persons in their community. The US unfortunately, for the time being, non accredited US investors are still blocked out. Hopefully things change soon with that and we're going to be at the forefront of that by being Mika compliant, being a market leader, ready to react as soon as options become available. But there's nothing to prevent teams from doing a reg D offering, which is how all startup funding is done.
00:37:11.301 - 00:38:26.949, Speaker A: Even in Web two, when you talk about a startup funding raise, that is what's called a Regulation D offering under the sec and that's compliant because it only involves accredited investors. And so that's still an option. There's nothing mutually exclusive about doing a reg D offering and separately, you know, doing a Reg Ask mega compliant offering, for example, on our platform. So those options are for EU persons and for US persons and then for, you know, around the, around the world, that's really at team's discretion of which additional jurisdictions they want to include in their raise. From our point of view, from Legion's point of view, we cannot work with jurisdictions that are OFAC sanctioned, that are on the blacklist, like your North Korea is that type of country. But if you're being MECA compliant, you're doing your offering under our regulatory license as a crypto asset service provider and you want to include additional jurisdictions that you believe are low risk for your team, then that's something we can facilitate and we can help get those legal opinions as needed on the status of the token as it is in regards to that jurisdiction. Fab, anything you want to add as well?
00:38:27.117 - 00:39:02.919, Speaker C: No, I think you covered it pretty bloody well. I think the only other thing to touch on here is like we're super long on the idea of Mika and this idea of regulation covering multiple countries. And I guess our thesis on this is that while it is pushing the boundaries, I think a lot of countries should recognize that like, okay, Mika is actually world class and world leading. We hope that a lot of these countries do adopt it. Obviously, as you said, United States is notoriously the difficult one. It's election year, you never know what's going to happen. But yeah, we're very much working on a day to day to hour, hour basis to try to ensure that we can bring back to the roots what we're talking about.
00:39:02.919 - 00:39:08.265, Speaker C: Open access to everyone. That will be the ideal state. But right now Mika is a good start to that.
00:39:09.605 - 00:39:37.115, Speaker B: Nice. And then the. I think that's, I think that's good on the regulatory side, which is super important. And I hope some of the projects listening to this can kind of get some comfort from this and realize that ICOs are now an option or I guess will be once Mika is. And what is the timeline on Mika and is it like set in stone? Is it one of these things where it can change like last minute or. Yeah, what's the scoop there?
00:39:38.375 - 00:40:09.909, Speaker C: Yeah, Mik has been happening, to be honest, for almost four years now. So it's gone through many iterations. I mean there's always minor changes, but I think on like the macro level, it's pretty set in stone. Mika has already started to be rolled out as of mid this year. This year being 2024 for whoever listen to the podcast in the future. And then they've been focusing on E Money, for example, E tokens. But yeah, due by end of this year, we should have the first like compliant Mika ICOs being able to be launched and be raised.
00:40:10.037 - 00:40:28.239, Speaker B: That's awesome. Okay. And on the Legion score. All right, let's move on to the Legion score. One metric you guys talk about a lot internally is this maximizing value add per dollar, per dollar raised. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that? Like the intuition behind it and I guess how the Legion score helps you achieve this.
00:40:28.277 - 00:41:09.589, Speaker A: This. Yeah, awesome. So, yeah, the Legion score is the implementation, right. Of this reputation, this investor reputation that we've been referring to. And just to set the stage right, when we'd spoken to all these projects, yes, of course they're first and foremost concerned about regulation. But their second concern, not far behind regulation is, well, if I could already raise from accredited angels who I know on a face to face basis or VCs who I know exactly who I'm working with, I know exactly like their investment thesis, I know the terms of their investment. Why would I go and sell tokens to these anonymous or pseudo anonymous wallets? Right.
00:41:09.589 - 00:42:19.729, Speaker A: I have no data, I have no assurances that they're investing for the right reasons, that they actually care about my project at all, that they're even human beings to begin with. And so that's what Legion Score speaks to, is letting projects quote quality control and give merit based allocation to their ICO and really customize not just the quality of investors that are participating, but also the kind of characteristics of the investors that are participating. And so it kind of breaks down into multiple different factors. When we think about the Legion score, we can get into a lot of detail on this, but I'll give a general summary first. So there's various different inputs that go into the Legion score and all these scores, these sub scores and achievements and et cetera are all aspects that teams can kind of customize and filter by if they want to select who they wanted to participate. And so part of that is we look at people's clout, right? Their social influence on networks like Twitter and Farcaster. And this is input that is like all of these been engineered to be very abuse and exploit resistant.
00:42:19.729 - 00:43:07.745, Speaker A: Right? We're using, inspired by what's called eigentrust, which is a open source algorithm for determining kind of global reputation from local peer to peer relationships. And so that's kind of the inspiration for everything we've engineered. And so your cloud score, for example, is not just a function of like oh, you have X number of followers and if you increase your number of followers, your score goes up. No, it's more richly determined by kind of the shape and connections of the social, of the social graph. So you have your cloud score, you have your developer score, which is based on your developer activity, which GitHub repos have you contributed to. What is that activity? It's again not just a simple function of more stars or more lines of code. Higher score, no, we've made it very exploit resistant.
00:43:07.745 - 00:44:22.003, Speaker A: You also have your on chain score. So measuring your activity on actual chains, whether they're Ethereum or L2s or even Solana as we expand into SVM. And so a measure of your activity on chain, you know, do have you been a loyal user throughout the bear and bull markets or do you only show up in bull markets, for example? So we're looking at social impact, developer impact on chain activity. And then all of those are kind of, you can think of them as pre investment type of scores, right? They're kind of somewhat, at least a degree independent of your activity on Legion or with the projects you invest in. We also though do consider once you've made investments on Legion, what founders or their community managers that they delegate to, how they review you, or what they say about you, or what they don't say about you compared to what they say about their other investors. And so this endorsement score basically holds you accountable where if you're going to be value extractive and you just invest and then dump the token and someone says this investor promised to make these introductions, promised to be adding value in this way, never did. Well, guess what, your Legion score is now going down and you are going to be less likely to get opportunities in the future.
00:44:22.003 - 00:44:58.889, Speaker A: So what does that mean? You're incentivized in the moment to add value, to invest in projects you legitimately want to contribute, to support long term add value. Because if you do that, you're going to get more opportunities in the future. If you do the opposite, you're going to get less opportunities. So you get almost like a, almost like a social slashing element involved, which really changes the incentives and changes the dynamic. And so yeah, we consider all those factors and more such as how and when you sell the tokens that you purchased on Legion. So all those roll up into your Legion score. And this is a tool for teams to not only hold investors accountable again, but also customize their offering.
00:44:58.889 - 00:45:25.125, Speaker A: So for example, they could say we want to give a discount or we want to give higher max allocation or we want to whitelist, you know, people who have a certain social following or who have contributed to certain GitHub repos or have a certain level of developer activity or who are power users of a certain defi protocol or use bridges a lot. All these aspects you can customize and find your community that you want to distribute your token to.
00:45:25.745 - 00:45:56.283, Speaker C: Yeah, I think as well, just to touch on that is like if this is gameable, it won't work. Yeah, right. There's no possibility that this will work. And I think it's like I mentioned before, one of my last projects were one of my initial projects, we did a campaign with actually XDFI and 3 Galaxy and the numbers of reporter was like 100,000 people participated. And we looked at the on chain data, it was six. We had to laugh. And it's like if it comes down to that point, there's completely no use to it.
00:45:56.283 - 00:46:39.611, Speaker C: I think the other thing that Matty touched on is there's definitely the economic incentive model for future opportunities on Legion, but there's this also idea that people essentially are fronting their reputation, their social capital here to a public place where if they act in a bad way, they essentially forego that social capital. And that's like reputation on the line. Reputation is one of the key things that drives industry interaction. So we're removing that pseudonymous or completely anonymous person, just promising that they'll do something and tying reputation to that. And I think that's also makes it super powerful. And again, to touch on the scoring mechanisms, humans are very complicated, impossible just to say, okay, this human is a number. So there's the quantitative data that we look at, but there's also the qualitative side of things.
00:46:39.611 - 00:47:07.085, Speaker C: It's a very complex thing. Assessing like, okay, what's the relevant experience they look at that's kind of akin to the on chain score. What's their engagement and influence, that's kind of akin to the cleat score. What's like their contribution potential that can tie in with the dev score. A few other things like the past contributions that should come from the endorsement scores. Reputation, trustworthiness come from an endorsement score. So it's like they kind of have like, yeah, kind of funny and relatable names, but like they are fundamentally rooted in some very interesting thinking.
00:47:08.425 - 00:47:40.521, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to be clear, like people can remain synonymous. Right. Like you can still be behind Alias for example, but we're attaching reputation to that pseudonym. Right. And you're carrying around this from each sale. So you know, sure, there could be Sybils, but you would have to defeat KYC and you'd have to attach all these value add things, your GitHub activity, your social activity, and then be willing to basically sacrifice that and start from scratch if you were to burn your reputation.
00:47:40.521 - 00:47:49.765, Speaker A: So it drastically reduces or drastically increases, I should say increases, the cost of doing Sybils and doing bots and these sorts of activities.
00:47:50.745 - 00:48:36.635, Speaker B: Makes sense. And I guess to, to cover like the intuition behind this, like the, the sort of maximizing value add per dollar invested. The way, the way I see that and the way the kind of Legion score improves that is just that there's a lot of like everyone who's, who's raised money knows that sometimes there's like an angel that invests like 10k and ends up adding the most value out of anyone. Maybe it's their first angel deal. It means a lot to them. They're out to prove themselves and you just get the most value add out of that 10k check. And then on the other hand, there's VCs that will invest millions of dollars and do very little other than the basic introductions and stuff like this.
00:48:36.635 - 00:49:12.395, Speaker B: And really it's sort of understandable, right. VCs have normally staff of five to 10 and maybe 100 portfolio companies. So you're getting 100th of those people's time plus all the new deals they have to do where most of their time is spent on new deals. And obviously it doesn't scale that much with the size of the VC fund. So it tends to be that the bigger the round, the more they invest. You're not really getting more value add for that. Speaking as a VC myself.
00:49:12.395 - 00:49:32.329, Speaker B: And there's also a lot of differentiation between them and what you want as a project is really you want to maximize the value add that you get for every dollar that's invested in your round. So if you can get all from like angels that are, that are super motivated to add a lot of value, that's, that's kind of ideal. And you can kind of see this happening already.
00:49:32.377 - 00:49:32.513, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:32.529 - 00:50:12.289, Speaker B: With the current rounds where founders will do like VC rounds at like X Val and then they'll do an angel round at 0.5x. Right. And that I think that is kind of proof that founders are using the situation. They're like VCs are adding less value and so they're worth less to me and they need to pay more to get into my round. And so I guess the way I see the Legion score is just a way to help founders do this calculus, right. What's done right now through word of mouth and your network can just be done more easily through this sort of really multifactor like reputation score.
00:50:12.337 - 00:50:32.805, Speaker A: And yeah, yeah, it makes it more transparent and it makes it, you know, the, the big, the big like household name VCs and accredited angels have that, that reputation just because they're well known in the industry. But this kind of extends that to everybody. Even if you are this first time investor or you. Yeah. Have haven't yet built a big footprint.
00:50:33.745 - 00:50:51.681, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All right. I think people understand how Legion works now. One question I had is why now is it just. Mika, that's going to change this because this has kind of been going, this meta has been in place at least since 2020. 2021. Right.
00:50:51.681 - 00:51:28.743, Speaker B: So like for a couple years it's arguably working for some people. Right. The centralized exchanges sort of benefit from it to some extent. Insiders benefit from it because they have higher paper value to use on, incentives to use for hiring, to use for like points, campaigns. VCs kind of benefit Although they're mostly luck, but they, I guess they get higher paper marks to raise new funds. Like a lot of people have tried to do different flavors of like launch pads, I guess, over the last few years. Like, why is now the time? Is it mainly Mika or is there, Is there other.
00:51:28.743 - 00:51:30.235, Speaker B: So something else too?
00:51:31.055 - 00:51:57.465, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll speak to this quickly and the fab. Welcome to join in. But I think Mika is certainly a part of it. But I think beyond that is just compared to 2017, when there just simply weren't that many projects out there. It's a much more competitive landscape these days and you have lots of capital, rich teams or teams that are rich in capital but poor in community. And I think community is what makes the difference. Right.
00:51:57.465 - 00:52:26.873, Speaker A: As we've said, the first 10 employees you have defines your company culture. The first hundred first thousand token holders defines your community culture. And that community is ultimately what's going to make a difference in adoption and decentralization and pushing the product forward in making a difference. Right. Having a few large investors on your cap table can't meaningfully decentralize the project. Right. Can't lead to widespread adoption in the same way that a widespread base of loyal community members does.
00:52:26.873 - 00:53:17.641, Speaker A: And so I think smart, if you look, one of the signs, for example, is what you just mentioned, Jose, of like these projects doing these raises where they intentionally give a discount to a broader base of like angel investors. Smart projects and smart VCs are kind of waking up and realizing, you know, community is super important, it's vital, and it's actually better if we invest alongside the community instead of shutting them out. Right. And so VCs, at least the top tier VCs, are realizing that they can get bigger returns in the long run by involving community rather than just taking everything for themselves and trying to shut out retail, which is not exactly what's happening right now. It's a kind of a mischaracterization. But taking a more friendly approach to widespread distribution of the token is a key step. And I do think there's signs that people are waking up to that important importance.
00:53:17.641 - 00:53:19.445, Speaker A: Fab, anything you want to add to that?
00:53:19.865 - 00:53:45.175, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think there's too much to add. I think he covered it pretty bloody well. Maybe the only thing is like, yeah, for right now, this actually is super advantageous for a select few. I think they probably don't want things to change too much. But again, for kind of like our mission and what we're trying to achieve. And I think it will lead to a Much better long term outcome for not only funding the projects of today, but they're the projects that will be existing in the future for their success as well.
00:53:46.955 - 00:53:48.815, Speaker A: I think you're muted, Jose.
00:53:50.235 - 00:54:09.975, Speaker B: Not bad. Yeah. And so the ultimate, that all makes sense. The ultimate goal for you guys, I guess, is to democracy. Actually, maybe we can start with this. Let's say in five years, Legion has massively succeeded. It's like matched or exceeded all your kind of wildest expectations.
00:54:09.975 - 00:54:29.695, Speaker B: What is the world? What does that world look like? Maybe you can walk me through, like, how do projects raise money? How do they launch tokens? What's the life cycle look like? Are they coming to Legion super early on? Are there still VC rounds? But are those happening through Legion? What are your. Yeah, maybe you can kind of paint a picture for us.
00:54:29.855 - 00:55:14.153, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So now, I mean, you have existing teams coming to Legion raising, but I think in the future you would have founders. You know, everybody has a Legion score, everyone has reputation, including founders themselves. And so you'd actually on Legion have founders meeting, forming teams, right. Projects coming into existence via Legion with maybe some early followers and some involved, you know, team members, they're raising via Legion for their first checks. Maybe, you know, VCs are also investing alongside separately or via Legion as the rails for that investment and forming their community. All of that is happening on Legion, right? So Legion becomes this place where projects are born rather than where they only come necessarily to distribute the token.
00:55:14.153 - 00:55:54.845, Speaker A: And I think the reputation layer that we've built, right, is this holistic insight into every investor, founder, developer, right, community member, their track record and all the projects they've cared about and all the projects they've added value to push forward. So I think that's a little bit glimpse into what the future looks like where it's still top quality projects launching here, the rails are all still on chain for the investments. It's all smart, contract driven investments. But you have this richer kind of ecosystem surrounding it of teams forming, building, raising, launching, leveraging their community, all via Legion.
00:55:56.075 - 00:56:35.041, Speaker C: Yeah, I think maybe just to chime in on that, this may be a little bit more future thinking. I mean, five years is a very long time in crypto for itself. But I think that when people typically think about capital formation, they think about financial capital formation. So essentially you go, you raise financial capital, you use that capital, you deploy into production capital. Production capital is used to achieve XYZ goal for whatever the venture is. When we talk about the world and the dynamics and democratizing access is not everyone has financial Capital to contribute. But there are a lot of people that have social capital to contribute, Creative capital, contribute, developer capital, contribute, et cetera, Hustle capital.
00:56:35.041 - 00:57:07.035, Speaker C: Hustle capital, yeah, you name it, right? And I think it's also a really interesting thing to think about. It's like, what does the future of the purest thing, the future of an organic idea spawning and being able to find the right capital. Maybe it's not financial capital, maybe it's, you know, production capital to come together to create something that changes the world. And I think like, facilitating something like that into the far future is also super, super interesting to think about. And again, the reputation layer, you know, without it, something like that would never be able to be achieved.
00:57:08.975 - 00:57:45.847, Speaker B: I love that. Yeah, I mean, you could say like launching tokens is crypto's killer app, but we're not necessarily doing it super well right now. And I even think capital formation is so broad. I always love Constitution Dao. Just a bull market phenomenon, but yeah, a bunch of crypto people coming together to try to buy the Constitution. And it feels like if you had these primitives, these reputation scores, like a platform with significant distribution, it would be so much easier to bootstrap social capital and financial capital to. To do stuff.
00:57:45.847 - 00:58:15.469, Speaker B: And it's like, it's a really exciting. It's a really exciting vision. Okay, I kind of want to end on that. I had a few more questions, but I feel like ending on that note is pretty good. You guys want to maybe say some last words also point people to where they can find you, where they can find out more, how they can get involved. I bet a bunch of people are going to want to. Is there going to be a points program? Is there any advantage to signing up? Like, yeah, give people the low down there.
00:58:15.557 - 00:58:43.993, Speaker A: Yeah, take it away, man. On that last point, I mean, we're, you know, we're very much committed to leading by example dog fooding our product. Right. We're focused on Mika compliant offerings at the moment. No US persons can participate in sales, but to the extent we can, we also want to have a very widespread distributed community of users because we see the value in that. We definitely want to lead by example as much as we can. So yeah, stay tuned.
00:58:43.993 - 00:58:55.297, Speaker A: There will be a points program and all sorts of news coming out soon. I'll be sharing the white paper, but Fab, do you want to kind of give everyone where they can, where they find us in your last thoughts?
00:58:55.481 - 00:59:23.923, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll wrap her up. So everything on socials, Farcaster, Twitter, the website, Legiondot, cc So Legion cc, you can find us if you're a project keen to chat. If you know any of the like Jose or the Delphi guys, reach out. I'm sure they'll connect us. You can also go through our website. There's the apply as project option there. I think you'll get direct to Maddie and I where we like to keep things super flat, super lean.
00:59:23.923 - 00:59:47.287, Speaker C: So you'll be speaking directly to us. I think it's like if you're mission aligned and you're keen to bring back ICOs, if you want to say, like, okay, instead of raising a large treasury on our own native token, that's what we want to do to raise an ico and then we have stablecoins to deploy instead of having to sell our own token. Like if you mission aligned with any of what we've said before, like definitely come speak to us. It doesn't really matter what stage you are. We can support the pre liquid token stuff. We can support the token launches. We've been cooking up a lot of stuff on that front.
00:59:47.287 - 00:59:59.193, Speaker C: And then on the investor side is like if you can deliver value to projects, we are going to give you a chance to make it. So come swing by, join and get involved.
00:59:59.319 - 01:00:05.381, Speaker B: Thanks very much guys. This is great. Yeah, thanks everyone for listening and see you next time.
01:00:05.533 - 01:00:06.213, Speaker A: Thanks Jose.
01:00:06.309 - 01:00:06.565, Speaker C: Thank you.
