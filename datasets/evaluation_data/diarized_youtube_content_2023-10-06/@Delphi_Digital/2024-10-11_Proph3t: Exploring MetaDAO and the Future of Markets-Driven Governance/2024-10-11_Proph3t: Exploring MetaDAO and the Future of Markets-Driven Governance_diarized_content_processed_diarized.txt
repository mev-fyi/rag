00:00:01.400 - 00:00:03.725, Speaker A: You're now plugged into the Delphi Podcast.
00:00:05.625 - 00:00:19.145, Speaker B: All right, welcome to the Delphi Podcast. I'm Michael, researcher at Delphi, and I will be your host for today. I'm joined by Profit, who is the founder of Metadao. Welcome, Profit.
00:00:19.265 - 00:00:20.617, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Michael.
00:00:20.761 - 00:01:05.857, Speaker B: Of course. Super excited for this conversation. I guess before we dive in to Metadao, which I'm excited to talk about, I kind of wanted to start with high level. I guess the core idea behind Metadao, in my understanding, is kind of based on markets being efficient. Markets being a useful tool to make decisions. And, you know, one maybe the first like, use case that we've seen from Mark, like, or that that's tested the efficiency of markets in crypto is prediction markets. And I've noticed recently that you've.
00:01:05.857 - 00:01:30.615, Speaker B: You've been talking a lot about prediction markets recently. So, yeah, kind of curious, like, what, what you're seeing right now and specifically related to, like, market efficiency. Like, do you, do you think people underestimate, overestimate, or idea how do you kind of think about where prediction markets are and just general market efficiency?
00:01:31.715 - 00:02:07.875, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess in terms of do people overestimate or underestimate the efficacy of markets? I think they estimate. I think, like, the consensus here is pretty much right, which is that markets are not perfect, but they are the best tool that we have of aggregating information. So they're better than polls, they're better than your parents just like saying who they think is going to win. They're like, better than any other tool that we have. And yeah, I think that's right. And I think that holds up with the data. So, like, there have been studies.
00:02:07.875 - 00:02:53.245, Speaker A: There's a study that went from 1988 to 2004, and yeah, it found that 74% of the time prediction markets are better than professional pollsters at predicting who's going to win the election. And then, yeah, I guess some people bring up this idea of manipulation as an issue with poly market. People can just try to pay to manipulate prices. I don't find that to be a very good argument. There's actually some research to suggest that manipulation increases the efficacy of prices. And that kind of makes sense because you have to try to manipulate the market. You're a noise trader, and other traders will look for that and trade against you in order to make money.
00:02:53.245 - 00:03:06.739, Speaker A: So, yeah, I pretty much agree with the consensus that markets are good at predicting who's going to win the election or other other topics that polymarket surveys on.
00:03:06.867 - 00:03:47.987, Speaker B: What do you make of the recent move that we've seen specifically related to the presidential election market, Trump has moved up pretty significantly on polymarket. And then I think just today we're recording this on October 10, Trump eclipsed Kamala on predict it as well as Kalshi, I believe, kind of like small moves in either direction. Like are these markets efficient enough to like price that. Because obviously there's been like a lot of debate that's kind of erupted on the timeline around these, these kind of moves recently.
00:03:48.171 - 00:04:14.955, Speaker A: Yes, there has been a lot of debate. I mean, yeah, I think it's possible that. Well, yeah, I guess so. One thing that some people say, like Paul Graham even said this on Twitter is oh, the prediction market has moved but the polls haven't moved. So like clearly there's an arbitrage here. Like clearly this. He didn't explicitly say manipulation.
00:04:14.955 - 00:05:05.687, Speaker A: Other people have explicitly said manipulation. And I don't think that's true at all because markets are like. One possible explanation of this is that the market is pricing a future event that will affect the polls. So I would guess that in this case the future event might be the hurricane that's about to or is currently going to Florida. And polls are backwards looking. They're looking at like how much do people currently like the president? Um, it's also, it could be manipulation in which case it'll likely resolve within a day or two. Um, but, but these are also small moves.
00:05:05.687 - 00:05:47.051, Speaker A: So I think people probably over index on the small moves in general just cause they, people like intuitively care about who's winning. Um, like there's a difference between Trump being at 53 and Kamala being at 47 versus like I don't know, we don't wait 3% movements equally. Like if Trump was at 65 right now and then he moved up to 68 and come on, moved down 3%, people wouldn't really care about it because it switched it such that now he's in the lead and now is seen as like a leader or whatever. People care about it more. So I think yeah, people probably put too much weight in the small booths.
00:05:47.203 - 00:06:49.805, Speaker B: One of the things that's been interesting for me is know I recently wrote a big piece on prediction markets and Futurchy Metadao and I talked to a lot of people internally at Delphi and then just within crypto and one of the bigger surprises for me in talking, you know, with people about kind of both of these technologies, prediction markets and Futarchy is there are a lot of people within crypto that, that Just, I don't know how else to say this, but, like, don't believe in markets almost, or almost like in disbelief that markets can be like a valuable source of information. Which was kind of surprising for me because I thought like, within crypto, you know, we're all here on some level because we believe in free markets. Do you agree with that? Like, have you had a similar experience? Have you kind of struggled to like, you know, explain, you know, how Futarchy uses markets in like a novel way to solve problems? Kind of curious, like, what your experience there has been.
00:06:50.225 - 00:07:42.173, Speaker A: Yes, I do think there are some people who just don't believe in the market. Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true. It's probably truer in the Ethereum ecosystem than it is in the Salon ecosystem, which is why it's kind of nice that Metadao is in Solana. But yeah, there are definitely some people who just don't believe that the market is like a good means of aggregating information. And you can show them as much empirical evidence as you want, but it won't change their opinion that much. There, I mean, like a common belief, for example, is that the team should be making all the decisions and you're never going to be able to beat the team at making decisions. And yeah, I mean, I don't think it's like, I think the team.
00:07:42.173 - 00:07:58.709, Speaker A: Team generally is a good means of making decisions, but we've also seen plenty of times where like incentives are misaligned. And so even if the team is making the right decision for themselves, they're not making the right decision for the overall protocol. So, yeah, I definitely think there's some belief in that.
00:07:58.837 - 00:08:41.484, Speaker B: What do you, what do you think it's going to take to like change that view? Because obviously Futarchy represents like a radically new way to make decisions instead of, to your point, like a CEO or a C suite execs or like a board of directors making a decision. It's like the market and I think that that is. Can be unsettling to people. It's like some. Something very new that we're not used to and people don't really know how to think about. Like, is there some tipping point in your mind or is it just like kind of the more reps Metadow gets in, the more comfortable people will become with this idea?
00:08:41.644 - 00:08:52.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's the latter. Just like the more usage and the more time, the more comfortable people will get and eventually it'll just be the norm and people won't even think about it interesting.
00:08:52.884 - 00:09:31.275, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I've noticed. I don't know how much you can speak to this because it's all kind of happening in real time. But it does seem like within the Salon ecosystem more and more teams are expressing interest in Metadao and in adopting, you know, Futurchy as part of their governance. JITO just has up a new proposal today, I believe to use metadata for part of their treasury management. I think. What do you think is driving this adoption right now?
00:09:32.175 - 00:10:54.005, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I guess I can speak to Cheeto in particular where, yeah, they have a new restaking product and they want to drive traction to that. And the core piece of restaking is the AVS or the NCN is what they call it a node consensus network, which is like the essentially customer of restaking network, the person who is buying economic security. And so that's like a core piece for them is developing these NCNS on Hapogito. And one way they can bootstrap adoption of NCNS is to do a grants program. And so they decided they were going to do this and they ran a process to get quotes from a lot of the research organizations in crypto who run these grants committees for projects and they got quoted what they deem to be high dollar amounts and they were like, okay, maybe we'll just try out the markets for this. It'll be free, which is a lot better than paying a lot of money and maybe we can get better decision making and try out this new mechanism and support a fellow Solana ecosystem team. So I think that's their story.
00:10:54.005 - 00:11:43.187, Speaker A: Flash, which also recently announced that they're going to use Futurkey for their governance there. So Anas, he owns Meta Tokens and he traded in a proposal that was the battle for Fitardio, which Michael, I believe you also traded in and whether or not we should build out this product. And he realized that the engagement was very high. So quantitatively, the average trader in that market had more than 30 trades. So yeah, there was more than 30 trades per user, was like 1300 trades, 45 traders. And that's pretty insane considering the fact that that was all manual. Like everyone, those are button clicks.
00:11:43.187 - 00:12:01.649, Speaker A: There's no bots, there's no like scripts that are running, people going to the site and clicking buttons more than 30 times to trade. And he wants to engage the Flash community and so I think that's why it made sense for Flash. So yeah, Those are like two early.
00:12:01.777 - 00:12:41.535, Speaker B: Stories that's super interesting. The 30 trades per person, that's a cool stat. I hadn't heard that before. How do. We were talking offline about this a minute ago, but how do those two examples kind of fit into? You know, I think some people view Futar Key as basically like SaaS. Like you spin up like a Futurchy as a service. And then I've also heard you talk about like futarchy as just like a kind of general purpose tool to build a better, more effective, more profitable organization.
00:12:41.535 - 00:12:58.646, Speaker B: And to me, like that, that kind of ladder vision is just like bigger and more ambitious, more exciting than the, than the first one. Yeah. Kind of curious, like where these two early examples fit in and how we go from like 1 to 2.
00:12:58.691 - 00:13:00.265, Speaker A: How we go from 1 to 2.
00:13:00.305 - 00:13:35.019, Speaker B: What, how we go from. Futarchy is more of like a SaaS model where people are using it for, I guess, one off decisions or kind of like, yeah, just like decisions that don't really move the needle versus like really adopting futarchy as like a foundation to like build an organization on and make, you know, the critical decisions that, you know, create products and bring in users and like drive profit.
00:13:35.147 - 00:14:28.835, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. I guess. I think one idea that I've gotten excited about recently and I guess to reframe the question in terms of the way that I'm thinking about it is like, how do we get more Futurchy native organizations? Like, BY FAR there's four DAOs today that use Metadata's Futurchy platform. By far the most engaged organization is Metadata itself. We've done more than 30, 30 proposals through Futurkey. And so how do we create more metadata? And one idea that I kind of like is this idea of a futurchy launch pad. So I guess we've had Meme Coin launch pads now and we've had just like regular ICO launch pads.
00:14:28.835 - 00:15:00.105, Speaker A: And one of the problems with ICO launch pads is that a lot of the times the investors lose money. Like the people who put money in get less money out when all is said and done. We've had a few examples on Solana of that being the case. Famously Parrot, the team walked away with $72 million, I believe, after raising an $80 million IDO. And yeah, the token holders walked away with like $0.10 on the dollar. And then we've had a few more examples of that.
00:15:00.105 - 00:16:33.475, Speaker A: And so, yeah, what if you could instead create this launch pad where say, anyone who has an idea of a product to build, they release this idea on a launch pad. Like say they want to build a new, I don't know, a new AMM protocol that's going to deliver more value to LPs and going to be able to make some fees. So they post this idea and then anyone can invest money in a dao in exchange for a pro rata amount of the tokens. So kind of similar to the Ethereum ICO where you just put in dollars and then you get back tokens and at this point all of the dollars sit in the futurkey dao on Metadata's platform and all of the tokens are held by investors and there's not like a pre mine for insiders. And at that point what you can do is yeah, so say, say the team rugs say the team just like walks away which happens plenty of times within crypto. Then anyone would be able to raise a proposal to just do a buyback, to do a liquidation and all of the, all of the token, all the USDC would just be returned to the token holders and so like they get their money back. And, and the way it would work for insiders is they would have to raise proposals to receive money to build out portion of the product and if they want to be grant granted a token allocation they could also do that.
00:16:33.475 - 00:17:10.615, Speaker A: So like that's just like how me and Colin, we have this deal with Metadao where if we hit certain, if metadow hits certain market cap numbers then we get paid some percentage of the token supply. Insiders would be able to do that as well. And that just feels like a much more aligned system. And it's cool to me because originally what interested me about crypto was ICOs. Like that was the thing that got me hooked. I was like, oh this is cool. This is capital formation, global capital formation where anyone can instantly fund an idea and then people go execute on it.
00:17:10.615 - 00:17:54.675, Speaker A: And this would actually potentially make that work as opposed to it historically not working so well. So that's like. And then yeah, because you have all the assets in futurkey, you have the sourcing function to use futurkey. So I think that's like one idea and then the other idea is just having people build organizations that uniquely use futurkey. So like, I don't know, one thing I've been kicking around is like a futurkey native Stablecoin, like a stable coin that somehow uses futurkey to allocate funds of the stablecoin. Kind of like an Olympus down model. So yeah, I think those are like a few ways Interesting.
00:17:55.215 - 00:18:14.477, Speaker B: So can a, can an organization only become like futarchy driven if they like launch as that or can like an existing protocol transition into becoming like driven by Futurchy?
00:18:14.621 - 00:18:37.837, Speaker A: Oh, for sure. I think that is the master plan. Right? Because I mean, yeah, so like Drift today uses us for grants. JITO is now going to use us for grants. Dean's list I would say uses us for more consequential proposals for them. And same with future dao. But yeah, the goal is proving the model is smaller scale so that we can start.
00:18:37.837 - 00:18:42.973, Speaker A: So that Futurchy can start controlling a larger and larger piece of these organizations.
00:18:43.149 - 00:19:17.045, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. I kind of want to talk about what your experience has been like so far building Metadao. I mean, speaking for myself personally, one of the very high level, maybe dumb things that attracted me to Metadao in the first place was just that it was new. And it's kind of weird, but we don't see a whole lot of new stuff in crypto these days. It seems like there's just a million DEXs L2s. We just got another one today with Unichain.
00:19:17.045 - 00:19:31.675, Speaker B: So I'm curious what your experience as a founder and as a builder has been trying to do something new where there isn't really an established playbook for how to do this?
00:19:32.015 - 00:20:42.515, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a double edged sword. I don't like doing something new in crypto is any different than doing something new. Just like in a broader sense, like doing new stuff is hard because, yeah, you got to write the playbook, but it's also kind of easier in a lot of senses because yeah, like if we were just doing, I don't know, uniswap, but on sui, I think it'd be a lot harder for me to like get psyched up to get out of bed in the morning and to compel people to build on this. Whereas like, I really fundamentally believe in futurkey and a lot of people actually believe in futurkey because yeah, it's this new idea and it's kind of like this attractive idea both because, well, A, I think it's futurity is just such a great nerd snipe because A, it's very novel and B, it could totally reshape civilization. So it's like a huge idea. And yeah, so I think in some sense it makes it harder because it's like, yeah, there's no playbook. But I think also it makes it easier because it nerd snipes the right people and attracts attention to yourself.
00:20:42.815 - 00:21:16.307, Speaker B: So how do you, you know, given that it's such a ambitious idea Never been tried before. There's so many different ways you could apply it. You could do, I guess, what metadata was doing, like make every decision based off the token price. You can do grants. Maybe this, you know, launchpad idea, which the Futario proposal kind of hinted at. How do you, you know, given all of those options, like how do you kind of select which one to do and prioritize?
00:21:16.491 - 00:21:54.309, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a lot of just listening to what people want today because yeah, obviously we have this very ambitious vision. But like also pragmatically you got to build for the user that exists today. You can't build like yeah, sure, Futurkey. You want to reshape the way governments work. If you build futurity for governments today, no one will use you. No one will use you. And so yeah, like we, we started with market governed organizations and then we go to daos and we pitch that and a lot of them were like, okay, we like this, this is a really cool idea and it kind of intuitively makes sense to me.
00:21:54.309 - 00:22:16.439, Speaker A: But also I don't want to hand over the reins of my organization that I've spent all my blood, sweat and tears building to a market that I don't fully trust yet. And so why don't we try grants? That's been like a common thing that we've gotten back. And so we're building grants because of that. And yeah, I think we'll hopefully be able to leverage that into the things that we want to do long term.
00:22:16.637 - 00:22:27.371, Speaker B: Can you talk a little bit about that grants product? How it works and maybe how it's different from the Futurchy model that's driven by the token price.
00:22:27.523 - 00:22:56.705, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. So high level context on Futurchy is in a futurkey. You bet on some. Well, yeah, I guess there's token based futurkey which is what metadow is doing today where people trade their tokens in these two markets. They essentially bet on what would be the price of my token if this proposal were to pass. What would be the price of my token if this proposal were to fail. And then if it makes number go up, you do it and if not, you don't in a grants based market.
00:22:56.705 - 00:24:05.625, Speaker A: I can actually just give the concrete example with jito. So yeah, you JITO wants to fund these NCNS to build on top of JITO restaking. And so what we're doing is NCNS will be able to apply first they have to kyc with the Judo foundation and then once they do that we will create a market for them. And it is a type of prediction market. So people bet on would this NCN generate more than $250,000 in economic activity through G2 restaking, where economic activity is defined by value that's flowing from the NCN back to stakers and operators and those guys. So like yeah, say you have this ncn, call it like Super Oracle because yeah, a common, common use case of restaking is to provide economic security for oracles. So you have Super Oracle and they have their Super Oracle token and they give it back to restakers or they like yeah, do this liquidity mining program.
00:24:05.625 - 00:25:09.435, Speaker A: Then we would measure, we measure the dollar value of this transfers as like flowing back to restakers and people bet on whether or not if a grant were approved, would this NCN generate more than this threshold in economic value. So it's, it's kind of like a prediction market where yeah, you're betting on yes and no just like you would buy yes or no and will Donald Trump win the election? The only difference is that so instead of with the normal prediction market you just have this long trading period. So yeah, poly market creates this market that's like who will win the election. And then people trade yes or no and then once someone wins the election their resolves. So like if Donald Trump wins then his yes tokens pay at $1 and there's no tickets pay out $0. The only difference here is that you actually have two trading periods. So in their case we're going to have a five day trading period where people initially trade these prediction markets.
00:25:09.435 - 00:26:04.357, Speaker A: So what would be the yeah, will this NCN be able to deliver this amount of economic value and then based on the prices in those markets we'll actually decide whether or not to give the grant or not. And so yeah, say we do give the grants to Super Oracle. So yeah, say the market says that they're like 90% likely to deliver $250,000 or above in economic value. 90% or more likely is in like the price of yes is 90 cents, the price of no is 10 cents. Then yeah, you give the grant and then you keep allowing people to trade until the six months is over. So yeah, it's time bounded as well. You're saying will they be able to generate this amount of economic value within six months? And if the prediction market says they're unlikely to deliver.
00:26:04.357 - 00:26:47.925, Speaker A: So yeah, say like Super Oracle's team is like sifu and some guys who are like known to be unreputable and are probably just going to take the grant money and run and the prediction market is trading at 10 cents. So it's saying there's only a 10% probability that they'll actually be able to deliver this amount of economic value. Then the grant would not go through and also all the trades in that prediction market would be reverted. So if you like I don't know, bought yes for, if you bet $100 on yes, then you would just get your $100 back or if you bet $100 on no or $1,000 on no, you would just get your $1,000 back. And so yeah, that's pretty much how it works at a high level.
00:26:48.305 - 00:27:48.515, Speaker B: Got it. One of the things that I've been thinking about recently is there's a lot of people that are obviously interested in trading and just paying attention to the presidential election production market on poly market or whatever. And then there's a decent amount of people as you were talking about earlier, that are interested in trading kind of, you know, sexy or controversial proposals like that are kind of, I don't know, like impactful. Like, like the Futario proposal was kind of a big one. It really would have shifted the direction of metadata so it got a lot of attention and, and volume for these kind of like longer tail decision markets like a jito. You know, let. There's just inherently less people that are maybe familiar with like what an NCN is, what restaking is.
00:27:48.515 - 00:28:03.195, Speaker B: How do you think about like driving volume and liquidity and like who are the Personas that will be trading these markets? And yeah, how do you, how do you like, engage more people?
00:28:03.895 - 00:29:04.165, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. So yeah, I guess there's a few facets to this. But yeah, inherently off the bat, yes, there are going to be fewer people that are interested, an order of magnitude fewer people interested in trading markets like this than are interested in trading the US Election or other sexy topics like that. And I think that's actually okay. Uh, so yeah, in the earlier study that I cited of the presidential prediction markets beating professional pollsters 74% of the time, those prediction markets only had between 155 traders and 790 traders. So that's not like a crazy number of people. There are at least between 155 and 790 people that understand pretty much how restaking works and may be able to provide some, some information to this market.
00:29:04.165 - 00:29:56.155, Speaker A: And yeah, so and then also like a lot of companies have run introduction markets so like HP has run internal prediction markets on future printer sales and those prediction markets are better, were better than our expert Forecasts. And so, yeah, I mean, there's a small number of people that really have the information there, but they're the ones trading the market. So it's okay. Yeah, I mean, essentially, like, I think there's not going to be that many people trading them, but I still think you'll get a better price signal than you would buy an expert because you let people surface themselves and then. Yeah, you also get these other benefits that like this is decentralized as opposed to just selecting a few central authorities to make the decision.
00:29:56.455 - 00:30:30.577, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is one pretty incredible thing about markets is that even at such a small size, with so low liquidity, these markets still can be efficient. We saw that in the early days of metadao with proposal 6, I believe metadata at the time had a tiny market cap and really wasn't widely known outside of the couple dozen early adopters. And there was a, you know, attempt at manipulation and the market defeated it, which is pretty remarkable, right?
00:30:30.681 - 00:30:47.073, Speaker A: Yeah. It's kind of funny to think that was the volume in that market, like the manipulated amount, which was 250k, that was probably like a quarter or maybe a third of the market cap at that time. Which. Yeah, so it was like a crazy amount, but yeah, it got defeated.
00:30:47.209 - 00:31:33.045, Speaker B: How do you think about kind of on the same question, like building the product, like literally designing the interface for kind of like a power user who's actually clicking a button based on like what the prices say at that given time versus maybe more of a casual user, you know, for Jito maybe, you know, this person's like, I don't really care. If the JITO foundation thinks that this specific NCN proposal is good, that's good enough for me. So I'm just going to. I want to vote pass on everything. Or I think, you know, this is all. NCNS are dumb. I'm bearish restaking.
00:31:33.045 - 00:31:46.655, Speaker B: I want to vote fail and everything. Like, will there be almost like two paths to participating or. Yeah, how do you think about like designing the product for those, you know, power user and then more like casual, lower information type person?
00:31:47.035 - 00:32:54.895, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. So it's kind of like, do you want to be Coinbase or do you want to be Binance? And I think if the sole goal was to make money off of trading fees and that was all that mattered, like, you're just building exchange. I think we'd want to be Binance, just finance, just building for the power user because ultimately I think that's where a lot of the flow is going to be. Right. Like if you look at Binance or these other like pro oriented exchanges, they dwarf the like normie retail volumes that happen on exchanges like Coinbase and Yeah, so I want to build for power users. However, you also have this situation where you have to sell futurkey itself to the organization and the organization may not understand this complex trading interface. And so I think you kind of have to do both because you have to like show people how it works with a simpler interface.
00:32:54.895 - 00:33:18.985, Speaker A: And so for there we've taken a lot of inspiration from like polymarket, which I think is a relatively easy to understand interface. And then we're also thinking about like how do we provide pro traders what they need. So ultimately I think it probably ends up in like just two different UIs like metadata normal and then Metadata Pro and probably most of the volume flowing through Metadata Pro.
00:33:19.525 - 00:34:02.507, Speaker B: Interesting. I guess zooming out a little bit. One of the interesting things to me about Futarchy or one of the unique challenges that the model or idea faces is there's a, there's like this question of how many metrics, how many good metrics can we find to like run a futarchy on. So right now like we have token Futarchies where these markets are just decided by like which. Which decision? Yay. Nay, left, right makes token go up more. And then this next one that's kind of in the works, Jito is going to adopt it.
00:34:02.507 - 00:34:14.451, Speaker B: I think Drift has also signed up as like a grants product which works a little bit differently. Do you have a sense of like other metrics that could be a good fit to run a futurchy on?
00:34:14.643 - 00:34:37.421, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think revenue is a great one. Like if you have say a marketing campaign and you want to see whether like you want to decide whether or not to approve it. Yeah. Put it up to a feed turkey that decides whether or not it'll increase revenue. Right. Because that's what marketing is trying to do. Or whether or not it increases revenue up to some threshold earnings.
00:34:37.421 - 00:35:23.055, Speaker A: Potentially another one. I think there are some, I can also list some examples of metrics that I think are not super great. So anything that's trivially manipulable. Yeah. Like if you have number, if you are a defi protocol and you have a decision market on number of wallets or like number of users that use your application, A, you're kind of retarded for doing that in the first place, but B you're going to be completely borked if you use that with a decision market because someone's just going to Long that and then they're going to create all these sybils and use your product so they can get paid out more. So yeah, I think that or like anything where the people who are trading can pretty easily manipulate the metric itself is not a good metric.
00:35:23.355 - 00:36:09.251, Speaker B: So what do you say to the people? I've seen this kind of debated in the metadata discord that say, you know, price, while it's clean and it's good, the way that metadata currently calculates it with a T wop is also somewhat prone to manipulation or maybe not manipulation, but you could, you could game it a bit because you know, most people only pay attention to these proposals like I don't know, the last 24 or so hours. So if you come in early and kind of, you know, slam the market one way or another, you can lock in those twat prices before people pay pay attention. Is that a problem or like, you know, is there a better way to measure price than just the current twap?
00:36:09.403 - 00:37:19.527, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it definitely is an issue. What Robin Hansen his idea of how you kind of run these proposals is instead of anyone being able to raise a proposal at any time, you instead have slots. So you could say like every Monday at 9:00am Eastern time someone can create a proposal and how they get access to that slot is they bid for it. You could bid in usdc, you could bid in meta, you could bid any token you want and whoever gets the highest, has the highest bid, gets access to that slot and they can publish their proposal. And then you run a proposal for a shorter period of time. So maybe it could even be like four hours or eight hours where you just concentrate people's attention in that small period of time so that it's not diffused across these three days where yeah, someone can like wake up at a time when no one else is really watching and move the prices and then, then that factor in the tee up. You can also just take a T wop over like the last hour of a proposal.
00:37:19.527 - 00:37:59.151, Speaker A: So concentrate, have people trade for a while and then only take tea wap in the last hour. So yeah, everyone is like watching during that hour. You can also use things other than twap. I think this is more into the future. But yeah, like Robin and I guess for people who don't have the context, Robin Hansen, he's an economist at GMU. He was the guy who invented feed turkey in 1999. And yeah, he also has these ideas of yeah, things that we can use other than TWAP to decide whether or not to Pass a proposal or not Basically using more statistical methods for that.
00:37:59.303 - 00:38:10.715, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess slightly related. Do you see? You know right now I think that how it's set up is proposals run for four days. Is that right?
00:38:11.015 - 00:38:11.991, Speaker A: Three days.
00:38:12.183 - 00:39:06.965, Speaker B: Three days, okay. Yeah. So like right now three days isn't like that long a period of time. But with the this grants product it sounds like the time that your capital will be locked up is longer because you have to kind of wait and see whether it was a good decision or not, whether it led to the intended outcome. How do you get around the time value of money problem there? Where if I'm deciding to trade a JITA proposal on whether they should fund this ncn, I'm locking my money up for a month or several months and I'm kind of losing the opportunity to I don't know, go buy Apple stock or buy a bond that's going to issue or I'm going to accrue interest on. How do you get around that or solve that problem?
00:39:07.425 - 00:39:59.481, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a good question and I think it's something that prediction markets generally have been trying to tackle. I'm surprised that we haven't seen a yield bearing prediction market yet. I don't see any fundamental reason that you can't create one. But yeah that would be, that would be one tool is to provide some underlying yield in the prediction markets. Yeah, like concretely say you take the money that's deposited in your prediction market and you lend it out to margin fire Lulo that aggregates all the lend borrow lens on Solana. Of course there's risk there, but not a substantial potentially amount of risk. And then yeah, I think, I mean yeah, I actually think that's the main solution of this problem.
00:39:59.481 - 00:40:26.381, Speaker A: But I agree that this is a problem like six months. We're gonna see if that's too long because it is. Six months is a very long amount of time, especially in crypto. So yeah, I think we'll see whether or not a timeframe like that works or whether we have to rely on shorter time frames, different metrics and so.
00:40:26.413 - 00:40:59.025, Speaker B: Basically I think what you're saying is just like composability kind of could in theory solve this problem. It's easy to imagine I guess like a poly market or drifts bet product. It's prediction market plugging into their existing like borrow land because you know it's all right in the same platform. It's seems relatively easy to do. Is it as easy to do with Metadow futur or is there are there like Weird things that makes composability harder.
00:41:00.525 - 00:41:11.585, Speaker A: No, yeah, we would just take the USDC deposited and then like. Yeah, throw it in drift or whichever. Borrow end or like. Yeah. Lulu who aggregates on Solana.
00:41:12.165 - 00:41:13.029, Speaker B: I see.
00:41:13.197 - 00:41:40.589, Speaker A: I mean it's not free. It's not a free lunch because yeah, technically with a borrow lend you can actually like borrow lens are not 100 liquid. They cry. They try to tailor their yield curve such that they are liquid all the time. But there have been cases where they're not. Like on. Yeah, right before ETH did the merge.
00:41:40.589 - 00:42:07.885, Speaker A: I remember on aave it was hard to borrow eth. Like there was very little capacity and you also couldn't get your ETH back if you had deposited because everyone was borrowing it in anticipation of getting both ETH pow ETH and ETH on. Yeah, ETH main net eth and. And so yeah, like situations like that can arise but the goal is that they get resolved relatively quickly and you can pull back and pay people.
00:42:08.045 - 00:43:01.149, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. I saw an interesting tweet from Brian Smith who's I believe the COO at jito. He made the point that like, you know, you can imagine going forward on like a longer term time frame that organizations, daos that are driven by futarchy and then you know, traditional DAOs or DAOs 1.0 or whatever you want to call them, futarchy driven organizations might trade at a premium and that would seem like it'd be a better like an ideal outcome for defi and crypto because we would kind of be like delivering on the original promise of like decentralization and free markets. Yeah, I'm kind of curious like your thoughts on that.
00:43:01.317 - 00:43:40.963, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is 100%. I mean, yes, if futurity proves itself, I think the market is naturally going to do that. And that would also be the inflection point because not everyone wants to give up control, but everyone wants their token price to go up. Like every single team in Solana Defi and Ethereum Defi. In any project, any company wants their stock price to go up like the CEO wants their stock price to go up. And so once it becomes that then I think it. Yeah, that I just view that as like a huge tipping point and it makes sense for all parties.
00:43:40.963 - 00:44:34.323, Speaker A: Right. Because like, I don't know, like right now if you listen to Demodoron, the like NYU professor who researches valuation, I remember him talking about how there are some companies where the cash on the balance sheet of the company trades for less than a dollar. So like the market is valuing the cash on the balance sheet at like 50 cents, which is pretty insane. And it's just because, yeah, the market know essentially is like saying, I know management is going to waste this money on like projects that have a lower return on invested capital than my hurdle rate, say like 8% or whatever. And so yeah, I'm going to price it at less than a dollar. And so it makes sense if, if that were governed by a futur, it would just say, oh, we're just going to distribute this money back to the, the shareholders. We're not going to let the have the managers waste this money.
00:44:34.323 - 00:45:18.321, Speaker A: And so like the stock would trade at a premium to where it was before. And yeah, and I guess like recently we've seen after, I don't know, different people have different opinions on whether or not Facebook was wasting money on Metaverse. But it did objectively have a very, very large team. I think at peak it was what, like 70,000 people. And yeah, we saw that once they decided to like start closing that down or at least reducing headcount, the market responded positively to that. And yeah, like if it was market governed in the first place, maybe that wouldn't have happened. And so it would have just traded at a premium.
00:45:18.321 - 00:45:25.245, Speaker A: So yes, essentially I agree with this and I think this is a big part of the bull case for Futurkey.
00:45:26.425 - 00:46:31.231, Speaker B: On that same vein, how do you think about, I guess the meta Facebook now meta example is a good one because you could on one hand you could look at that and be like, well like you know, Zuck is wasting a lot of money. The market doesn't like this that he's making all these investments in the Metaverse and they're building goggles and they have this, you know, crazy spend on VR AR and it's so far out and we're going to be burning a lot of cash in the meantime. So like listen to the market. The market will make the price go up. But then maybe the other side of that argument is like, well, you know, it takes kind of like a benevolent dictator, like a Zuck to like really see out these long term bets. And if you hand over all the power to, to markets to decide then, then maybe the market is like more short term oriented or risk averse and you know, you don't get that, you know, kind of 10 year like R and D process and then like the next big thing. Yeah.
00:46:31.231 - 00:46:42.195, Speaker B: So I guess I'm kind of curious whether or not if you think the markets are well suited to make those long term Strategic decisions.
00:46:42.575 - 00:47:25.055, Speaker A: Yeah, I think frankly long term strategic decisions are hard. And yeah, the question is whether benevolent dictators are better than the markets. So yeah, Zuck is a special case where he's the founder. So his, he owns lots and lots of Facebook or Meta Stock. And so he's like pretty aligned with the organization as a whole, but also not perfectly aligned. Right. Like it actually could very well be in the Facebook interest that they just stop innovating and just treat Facebook as a cash cow for.
00:47:25.055 - 00:48:24.141, Speaker A: Yeah. And essentially just like, yeah, milk the cow for as most months, as much money as you can get. Which is like kind of what Apple has done over the last 10 years. Like there haven't been, I mean I guess we now had the Vision Pro, but until then it was, I think most people would call Apple like uninvitive. And yet like that has actually proved to be a very successful strategy. Like it may have just been the case that like for, for them you had this already great thing which is you have the iPhone, the iPad and the MacBook and really you didn't need to innovate a bunch can create a bunch more stuff. What you really needed to do was invest your money into just improving the existing experiences of those products like improving battery life for the iPhone or CPU power like the M1, M2 and M3 chips.
00:48:24.141 - 00:49:13.599, Speaker A: And so yeah, I mean I think markets are better at aggregating information and they have. Yeah. So, so back to this question. Like it may be that Facebook really is just supposed to be a cash cow, but probably a founder isn't going to want to run the company like that. Like even if that was the case, I think the founder would still want to take these big bold bets because that's how they got to leading the company in the first place, was taking this big bold bet. And so yeah, I guess I haven't done enough research on AR VR, but I would just like, I wouldn't discount the power of the markets because also like markets are risk averse but it's rational to be risk averse. Right.
00:49:13.599 - 00:49:50.025, Speaker A: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. There's discount rates where like a money today, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now and a lot worth more than a dollar 20 years from now. I think at a 5% discount rate. It's been a while since I've run the math on this, but a dollar today is worth 5 cents 15 or 20 years from now. And so yeah, it does not always make sense to be super long Term oriented if that means thinking 10, 20 years in the future looks rationally. So, yeah, that's kind of my take.
00:49:50.365 - 00:50:38.365, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. Apple is probably a good example of like you said, a company that had a cash cow and kind of has just decided to milk it as opposed to bet the farm on the next big big thing. And the market seems to like that. But then on the other hand, maybe Amazon is a good example, at least in the early days of a company that was like they had a lot of revenue but then they were just plowing that back into the business and they really didn't show any free cash flow for the first decade or so of the company. And the stock price was going up that whole time. So the market seemed cool. Cool with this kind of like long term strategic direction.
00:50:38.365 - 00:50:43.245, Speaker B: So yeah, this is one of the things I'm pretty excited to see play out.
00:50:43.705 - 00:51:10.575, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think Amazon is potentially a good counter. I mean, yeah, it was this long term play where, yeah, a lot of this, I mean Bezos was able to convince the market, but also there were times where he wasn't right. Like Amazon stock did go down a lot after and after the dot com bubble. But yeah, I'm also excited to see how this plays out.
00:51:10.995 - 00:51:54.725, Speaker B: Yeah. And I wonder if there's like a, almost like a happy medium here where there's like a periodic check in with the market where, you know, in the Amazon case it's like, okay, we're going to take all of our revenue and like plow it back into the business, build out this like massive distribution network. We're going to build a bunch of like fulfillment centers. And then like every year, a couple of years, I don't know, maybe a decision goes to the market if Amazon was a futurist and almost like a check in, like, how's it going? Is this working? Yeah. How do you think about that? Like balance, almost like gut checking These like long term decisions. Decisions, sure.
00:51:54.765 - 00:52:11.905, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I don't necessarily know if it's better than just having more control of the market, but yeah, I think any control of the market is better than the status quo.
00:52:12.565 - 00:52:59.535, Speaker B: Interesting. I guess for this one of the last things I wanted to talk about was AI. Obviously AI is a big narrative in and of itself and people are kind of trying to port it over to crypto. And I think my main criticism so far of a lot of the ideas that we've seen is it seems like we're taking things from web2 copying and pasting them into crypto sprinkling a little quote unquote decentralization over them and then boom, saying they're better. And to me that, that approach just doesn't seem like it's going to work. And I look at futarchy as like something that's like totally new. It's, it doesn't exist in Web2 or anywhere else.
00:52:59.535 - 00:53:16.095, Speaker B: And it's kind of something that's like only possible with crypto. So yeah, I'm wondering like maybe high level, like what you think of this whole like AI crypto narrative and if you see a way for, you know, maybe futurchy to play a role in that.
00:53:16.255 - 00:54:05.575, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't have a big opinion on the AI crypto narrative overall. I haven't really studied whether or not decentralization helps. At a gut check, it does look like a lot of scams. But yeah, in terms of futur and AI, yeah, you have this really interesting thing where, yeah, so like in a market, sorry, an AI is able to be awake 247 and they can ingest way more information than any human can. And they can potentially be less susceptible to emotional biases. Right. Because they're computer programs and they're not like squishy meat program.
00:54:05.575 - 00:55:14.949, Speaker A: Squishy like meat computers with these with like an evolutionary past. And so all those reasons point to the fact that AIs or models or agents or whatever we want to call them will be better traders than humans in markets generally and in decision markets specifically. And so what that means is that you could end up in a place where Futurkey is really just an aggregation layer for different AIs to bet against each other on what they think the future will be. And then you have future key. It's just like the aggregation layer where instead of all like submitting their vote or something and then you just take the majority vote, you have them trade and then yeah, you take like the price. And yeah, I think that's one reason why when I talk about futurchy with AI people and obviously there's some like history there. So yeah, Robin Hansen, he's also big into AI, part of the rationalist movement, which is, yeah, big into like AI safety.
00:55:14.949 - 00:55:33.715, Speaker A: And so there's like a lot of overlap there. And when I talk about future with AI people, they actually find it interesting and are like, oh wow, this is like something that's crypto but not a scam. But yeah, so I think that's like one potential feature of where FUTURITY goes is this aggregation layer.
00:55:35.095 - 00:56:52.035, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's super interesting and makes sense. If AIs are better at everything than humans at some point, then it seems like they'll be better at making informed bets on decisions. One of the other kind of areas of potential overlap with AI that I thought a lot about for this piece is just governance. How will humans interact and collaborate with these AIs that will potentially come on chain? It's still a narrative for now for sure. One of the things that I was somewhat surprised to learn about metadao is that it just like it enables like a degree of minority protection that's just not possible with traditional daos. And you know, would be to get your thoughts on this like an attritional Dow, you can, you could basically just like 51% attack it and you know, the 51% can slowly rug over and over the 49% until the 51% is like 100. And with Futarchy this is like, it's much harder.
00:56:52.035 - 00:57:04.235, Speaker B: Do you see that alone as, you know, a potential reason why a futurchy makes more sense as like the next evolution of governance?
00:57:05.655 - 00:57:51.113, Speaker A: Yeah. And so like to get into the mechanics here essentially. Yeah. In future Turkey, you have this past market and this fail market and say someone raises a proposal that you disagree with, then in order for any proposal in future to pass the price in the past market, time weighted average price has to be higher than the time weighted average price, the fail market. And so if you want to dump your tokens in the past market, then they have to buy you out. Like essentially anyone who wants to get this proposal through has to buy you out for a price higher than the spot price in order for the proposal to pass, which is kind of a nice. Yeah.
00:57:51.113 - 00:58:25.449, Speaker A: Guarantee of minority protection that you have to be bought out for like a price higher than the spot price if something that you don't want to have happen happens. Yeah, I, I would say it's like, it's interesting. I, I know Big Z, who's a member of the metadata community and the co works at Drift. He really likes this. I think it's kind of an interesting property, but it's not the most interesting property to me. But yeah, it's interesting for sure.
00:58:25.617 - 00:58:27.965, Speaker B: What is the most interesting property for you?
00:58:28.665 - 00:59:22.789, Speaker A: Just that it's a better way to aggregate information. I mean, to me what futurkey means. I was talking about this with someone at Breakpoint about how we all have our different intuitions about markets. And to me a market is this place Where I guess I've always been a nerd and I think I've gotten better at communicating in a way such that other people agree with what I'm saying. But I think when I was a kid, like I would say things that I thought were right and I think I would just like not explain them in a good way and people would like disagree with me just because of the tone or the way I explained it or something and. But markets don't really care about that. They just care about whether or not, you know, the truth.
00:59:22.789 - 00:59:41.695, Speaker A: And so like I kind of have this mental model, a futurkey as this place where we can finally put the nerds on top. We're like the smart autists who actually know shit can be the one governing decisions as opposed to the smooth talking politicians. And I think like to me that is the most cool part and engaging part about futur.
00:59:41.855 - 01:00:46.469, Speaker B: Yeah, like a, like a pure meritocracy. How do you see, you know, as we're wrapping up here, how do you kind of see the next six to 12 months going for Metadao? I mean the project has only been live for what I believe like just over a year now or maybe almost a year and it's already seen, you know, pretty incredible growth. You said earlier, you know, you've done 30 proposals now, the community is growing. You know, if we kind of base the whole, if the whole idea is kind of based on like whether or not it makes number go up, you know, you look at the number, you know, the meta token price is doing pretty well. So it seems like, I don't know, seems like the model is working so far. What are you looking forward to and how, what are there any like big kind of moments that you are kind of waiting for that will like validate that like the model is continuing to work? I guess?
01:00:46.667 - 01:01:32.557, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess six to 12 months I think more like focused on growth essentially. I want to get more DAOs using Futurkey on Solana. I want to get more proposals per DAO and be able to own a larger. So yeah, we have token based and soon we'll have grants like a product specifically targeted to grants, but more of those. So potentially like a product specifically targeted to liquidity mining decisions or tokenomics decisions. I think those are all interesting. Potentially even something in like consumer like I don't know.
01:01:32.557 - 01:01:47.969, Speaker A: There's this idea that I kind of joke around about which is like what if you could create prediction or decision markets and be like what would be the probability that I find a girlfriend if I move to New York City or like some other city? I think that would be like, kind.
01:01:47.977 - 01:01:52.085, Speaker B: Of interesting that have immediate product market fit in crypto.
01:01:55.265 - 01:02:11.985, Speaker A: But yeah, so potentially something like that. But largely just like growth, listening to our users and hearing what they want and then building on that and iterating and making it better, essentially just improving the core mechanism.
01:02:12.525 - 01:02:22.293, Speaker B: Got it. Well, I think that's a. That might be a great place to leave it. Prophet, thanks so much for coming on. I really enjoyed the conversation and hope we can do this again.
01:02:22.429 - 01:02:26.677, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks so much for having me. And thanks for being a futurt.
01:02:26.781 - 01:02:28.225, Speaker B: I got one shotted.
01:02:28.805 - 01:02:29.493, Speaker A: Me too.
01:02:29.589 - 01:02:30.245, Speaker B: All right, see you guys.
