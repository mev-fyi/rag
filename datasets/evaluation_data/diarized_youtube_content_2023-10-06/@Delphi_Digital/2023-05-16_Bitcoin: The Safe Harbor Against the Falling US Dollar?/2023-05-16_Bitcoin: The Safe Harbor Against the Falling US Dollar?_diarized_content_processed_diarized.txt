00:00:02.080 - 00:00:09.966, Speaker A: Haters here working the phone say a lot of their customers are freaked out. We're down over 16%. The stock market is now down 21%.
00:00:10.070 - 00:00:17.630, Speaker B: It was the worst day on Wall street since the crash of 1987. Out of this worry, we have something called the bitcoin.
00:00:17.702 - 00:00:31.030, Speaker C: Bitcoin was born in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The first block was inscribed with chancellor on the brink of the second bailout for the bank. And at the beginning of March, 3, new banks collapsed. Signature Bank, Silvergate bank and Silicon Valley.
00:00:31.062 - 00:00:35.118, Speaker A: Bank marks the third largest bank failure in us history.
00:00:35.206 - 00:00:37.062, Speaker C: And what did the Fed do? They backstopped them.
00:00:37.078 - 00:00:39.046, Speaker B: A few days later, Americans can rest.
00:00:39.110 - 00:00:41.574, Speaker D: Assured that our banking system is safe.
00:00:41.614 - 00:00:44.270, Speaker C: This is exactly what bitcoin had been born for.
00:00:44.382 - 00:00:50.114, Speaker D: The one thing that's missing, that will soon be it all, is a reliable e cash.
00:00:53.454 - 00:01:12.846, Speaker B: As soon as the banks collapsed, it went up 50% in price and added $200 billion to its market cap. And the news focused on bitcoins price action. But bitcoin is more than that. It always has been. The endgame for bitcoin is to offer a unique alternative financial system. Different to our fiat system or natural reserves like gold.
00:01:12.990 - 00:01:18.710, Speaker E: Bitcoin is the worlds first globally accessible public money.
00:01:18.862 - 00:01:56.846, Speaker B: But bitcoins price action still gets the most attention, even at this most interesting time for its larger story. With banks collapsing, Bellagi bet $1 million that within the next 90 days, bitcoin was going to be worth $1 million per bitcoin. He was expecting the US dollar to hyperinflate, meaning that bitcoin would go up in value in comparison. And Bellagios argument is that hyperinflation happens very quickly. Its not a linear thing. It happened slowly and then all at once. So that was what he was betting on.
00:01:56.846 - 00:02:06.834, Speaker B: So let's look at the dollar, the global reserve currency. It's been the global reserve since the end of world War two and it's been fiat, not backed by anything tangible for over 50 years.
00:02:07.254 - 00:02:14.742, Speaker D: I directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets.
00:02:14.838 - 00:02:32.654, Speaker B: What's really important is not only is most of the world's trade done in dollars, but also global reserves are often held in us dollar debt. Treasuries. Treasuries are government issued debts, essentially ious from the US government that say that the US government will repay the debt with interest.
00:02:33.114 - 00:02:35.698, Speaker D: We've got another bond to buy.
00:02:35.826 - 00:03:07.272, Speaker C: So basically there are two dominant ideas about what's going to happen to the US dollar. On the one hand, you have people like Balaji who believe that the dollar is about to hyperinflate and therefore assets like bitcoin are going to go up in value in relation to the dollar. And then on the other hand, you have people that highlight that this is a narrative that's been going on for the last 50 years, that everybody constantly says that another reserve currency is coming or no reserve currency at all, and that the US dollar is about to fall. However, over the last 50 years, those people have been wrong. So what makes this time different?
00:03:07.368 - 00:03:14.902, Speaker B: To get more information on what it would take for the dollar to lose its reserve currency status and lead to its potential fall, I spoke to an expert.
00:03:14.998 - 00:03:48.402, Speaker F: I don't think people understand how much it takes to move away from the dollar as a global reserve currency on just about every corner of not just the financial markets, but even the global economy. For the dollar to really hyperinflate, you would have to have a mass loss of confidence in the dollar itself. And as a corollary, or potentially even as a catalyst for that happening, you would have to have a massive loss of confidence in the US being able to eventually pay back its debts. Right, the US treasury market.
00:03:48.458 - 00:03:48.602, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:48.618 - 00:04:23.398, Speaker F: And US treasury specifically. So us government debt is also the most important, most considered, the most pristine collateral on the planet. If we don't raise the debt ceiling and you start to have yields and rates spike up, because you would see mass selling of treasuries, that is actually the short term, probably biggest risks to starting that potential hyperinflation cycle or narrative, because people would start to lose confidence in the US treasury market, us government debt and the US dollar. As a corollary, I was reading your.
00:04:23.446 - 00:04:38.366, Speaker C: 2019 report, and in the intro you were saying that you don't think that the dollar is going to hyperinflate or lose its reserve currency status over the next however, like ten years. I think you said in that. I'm just wondering if your base case changed in any way.
00:04:38.430 - 00:04:54.714, Speaker F: I look out three to five years and I very much don't think the dollar is going anywhere. You look out 30, 40 years from now. I'm not saying that the US is by any means, and the dollar by any means is going to have the type of, the same type of prestige that it has today, or the same type of global reserve currency stats it has today.
00:04:55.774 - 00:05:47.984, Speaker B: So if bitcoin could take over from the dollar in 30 40 years, why would it succeed where the fiat dollar is failing now? Firstly, it's important to realize that bitcoin wouldn't replace the dollar one to one. Its design doesn't lend itself to instant or cheap transactions, and it lacks the throughput needed to make the billions of transactions that the dollar makes every day. But what bitcoin does offer is decentralized money that can be used trustlessly, which is uncensorable and beyond government control. Which means bitcoin could serve as the base layer of a new financial system. Because it's decentralized, has fixed supply, and because it's digitally native. Because it's decentralized and beyond state control, unlike the dollar, it's uniquely positioned. Its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, is anonymous, has disappeared entirely since bitcoin's creation, and can no longer alter bitcoin's design or supply.
00:05:47.984 - 00:06:16.896, Speaker B: Some people refer to it as the immaculate conception, as its pure technology not burdened by state or creator control. Compared to the dollar, which is controlled by the US government, mean that countries and people that use the dollar have to trust that the US government will act fairly. And since 2008, there has been a record amount of quantitative easing or money printing or us dollars being injected into the financial system.
00:06:17.040 - 00:06:20.554, Speaker D: Fair to say you simply flooded the system with money.
00:06:21.614 - 00:06:25.318, Speaker E: Yes, we did. That's another way to think about it. We did.
00:06:25.406 - 00:06:27.514, Speaker D: Where does it come from? Do you just print it?
00:06:28.134 - 00:06:33.534, Speaker E: We print it digitally. So we, you know, we as a central bank, we have the ability to create money.
00:06:33.654 - 00:07:21.814, Speaker B: During COVID alone, there was over $3 trillion added. With bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million created. And every four years it goes through a harvening where half as many bitcoin are created per block, which means it's the hardest form of money. Fiat currencies in their current form have existed for 50 years since the US government went off the gold standard in 1971, whereas bitcoin has only existed for 14 years. Enough to establish itself worldwide, but not enough for it to be a credible global reserve currency. Yet, as Kevin pointed out, the dollar appears strong. But other global currencies have lost their dominant position relatively quickly as the issuing institution lost strength and confidence due to macro factors like war or crises.
00:07:21.814 - 00:08:00.400, Speaker B: Bitcoin doesn't rely on a single institution, but a decentralized network of miners. So it's inoculated from one single point of failure. Given bitcoin's properties, even though it won't replace the dollar like for like whole financial ecosystems can exist on top of bitcoin like the lightning network and decentralized finance. So bitcoin itself wouldnt have to transact as much and exist for notable transactions rather than buying your daily cup of coffee. But given all these strengths, some people still argue that bitcoin should be worth nothing at all because it has no inherent value. Its not backed by anything. If I buy bitcoin, am I buying.
00:08:00.432 - 00:08:02.640, Speaker E: A share of stock or am I.
00:08:02.672 - 00:08:04.176, Speaker B: Buying a pork belly?
00:08:04.280 - 00:08:04.752, Speaker D: What am I buying?
00:08:04.768 - 00:08:06.464, Speaker A: Are you buying air?
00:08:06.624 - 00:08:07.152, Speaker B: Oh wow.
00:08:07.208 - 00:08:21.152, Speaker A: You're buying something that other people believe either is going to go up in value. Presumably that's why you're buying it, or think it's going to go down in value, which is presumably why someone else is selling it.
00:08:21.208 - 00:08:44.344, Speaker C: So watch the interview that Elizabeth Warren did recently where she said that platinum has intrinsic value but bitcoin doesn't. Platinum only has value because we have ascribed it value. It's just a metal at the end of the day it doesn't buy you food or take you out for dinner. The same with bitcoin. We've decided that bitcoin have a certain amount of value and even more people in the world have decided that the US dollar has value. As soon as people stop believing in these ideas, these narratives, then all of it loses their value.
00:08:45.204 - 00:09:17.742, Speaker B: Like platinum, gold is just another metal as we were talking about earlier. Before 1971 it was used to back up countries currencies known as the gold standard. But it's been used for thousands of years as a store of value and medium of exchange. Obviously bitcoin has only existed for a few short years, so it has some way to go before its store of value. Narrative is as strong as gold, but bitcoin and gold have similarities. Both bitcoin and gold have limited supplies. Theres only so much gold worldwide and small amounts of it are discovered each year.
00:09:17.742 - 00:10:00.412, Speaker B: As for bitcoin, we know that only 21 million will ever exist. Like bitcoin, gold is trustless and non sovereign governments cant choose who can or cannot use or own gold or bitcoin. They also cant choose to create more gold or bitcoin whenever they like. One of the strengths that bitcoin has over gold is its easier to transport and custody. Often when people own gold, they own a piece of paper representing ownership. If you hold your bitcoin in self custody like a hardware wallet, you actually own the bitcoin itself. If you want to learn more about wallets and self custodying your crypto assets, check out our recent video on wallets and hardware wallets.
00:10:00.412 - 00:10:37.264, Speaker B: You can find the link in the description below. Now back to bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain. Transactions can be made across the world 24/7 with relatively cheap transaction fees when compared to golds global transportation costs. Because bitcoin is digitally native, it can be used as the base layer of a new digital economy, taking its place in the heart of DeFi, something gold can't do. But that's not all. Though we're no longer on the gold standard, central banks still hold large gold reserves for the reasons we just talked about. Trustless, limited supply, durable and outside of state control.
00:10:37.264 - 00:10:44.068, Speaker B: These are all things that bitcoin is too. So bitcoin could be used for central bank's reserves as well.
00:10:44.196 - 00:11:06.256, Speaker F: Bitcoin could start to slowly but surely make its way into global foreign central bank reserves as a additional hedge against global fiat currency debasement. Because it diversifies those reserves, it gives them a, let's say, higher beta hedge on currency debasement, especially as foreign central banks understand the concept of currency basement.
00:11:06.280 - 00:11:06.416, Speaker D: Right?
00:11:06.440 - 00:11:38.824, Speaker F: Because it's a practice that's been going on for again, decades and decades now. But one of the biggest arguments against it doing that, and what something it has to prove as it grows over time, is the volatility around bitcoin actually makes it a very unattractive, active version of collateral for when we're talking big transactions or serving as collateral for the global economy. In a sense, its volatility actually works against it because you don't want to necessarily lever up on something that can lose 20% of its value in a given week.
00:11:38.864 - 00:12:31.674, Speaker B: Right, but this is bitcoin on a 20 to 30 time horizon. But what is it good for? Now, bitcoin is a hedge against fiat currency debasement. Looking back at March 2020, when bitcoin started its run up from five k to 69k. This happened as the US and other central banks announced massive quantitative easing programs, or money printing, to mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. So bitcoin proved a good hedge against quantitative easing, loose fiscal policy, money printing, or the systematic weakening of fiat currencies by their own governments. To prove this point, bitcoin's largest one day rally in years came after the recent banking crisis and the shadow QE that the US Federal Reserve enacted to backstop banks. Since fiat currency debasement has been an issue for as long as fiat currencies have existed, it seems that bitcoin will continue to be a good hedge against it for the foreseeable future.
00:12:31.674 - 00:12:37.246, Speaker B: There is no second best. There is no second best crypto asset. There's a crypto asset.
00:12:37.270 - 00:12:38.094, Speaker G: It's called bitcoin.
00:12:38.134 - 00:12:40.434, Speaker B: Right, right. There's no second best.
00:12:41.294 - 00:13:15.614, Speaker G: But take all your money, buy bitcoin, then take all your time, figure out how to borrow more money to buy more bitcoin. Then take all your time and figure out what you can sell to buy bitcoin. And if you absolutely love the thing that you're. That you don't want to sell it, go mortgage your house and buy bitcoin with it. And if you've got a business that you love because your family works for the business that's in your family for 37 years, and you can't bear to sell it, mortgage it, finance it, and convert the proceeds into the hardest money on earth, which is bitcoin, so what should you do?
00:13:15.954 - 00:13:46.502, Speaker B: Should you go and mortgage your house and buy bitcoin? No, I'm definitely not saying that. But global fiat currencies have been debasing for years. Whether or not that happens on an extreme level over the next few is up for debate. But what we do know is they're going to continue debasing. So the endgame for bitcoin is the base layer of an alternative digital financial system. A stateless, scarce, non sovereign, secure, portable store of value. But the journey is exciting.
00:13:46.502 - 00:14:00.854, Speaker B: But in the end, it's just bitcoin, a unique asset born of immaculate conception. So, beyond the speculation and narratives, what's really important is that one bitcoin will always equal one bitcoin.
