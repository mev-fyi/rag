00:00:00.480 - 00:00:10.694, Speaker A: And Duncan, also known as flood cap. How do we intro you again? Shitcoin scavenger and enthusiast. Shitcoin enthusiast. Or can we say shit in the intro?
00:00:10.854 - 00:00:13.622, Speaker B: Why would you say Altcoin investor?
00:00:13.758 - 00:00:17.966, Speaker A: Altcoin investor. That's just everyone in the space. It's the most nondescript.
00:00:18.070 - 00:00:19.006, Speaker B: Low cap.
00:00:19.150 - 00:00:21.514, Speaker C: Low cap. Gem Hunter, Thousand X.
00:00:33.294 - 00:01:16.216, Speaker A: Hi, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast. I'm Jose, your host and head of Delphi Labs. And today with us, as always, we have Ceteris, who's the head of Delphi Research. Jan, who is the managing partner at Delphi Ventures, and Flood Capital, also known as Duncan, or Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, who is requested to be introed as a gem finder, an altcoin hunter. So we're sticking with that for this episode. So we've got a full docket today. I think we're going to start with what's been on everyone's mind on twitter and everywhere else, which is the eigen layer, airdrop and token announcement this week.
00:01:16.216 - 00:01:43.536, Speaker A: So there's a lot to dig into here. I suggest we start with just the airdrop. People were raging about this airdrop. There was a bunch of stuff that people were mad about. I think if I had to summarize it, I would say it was the VPN blocking. Like letting people farm without a VPN and then forcing a VPN to claim, which, I mean, it's hard to argue that you wouldn't be angry at that one. It was the pendle situation, which I believe got resolved.
00:01:43.536 - 00:02:13.200, Speaker A: Like the fact that YT people weren't getting the full yield. It was the non transferability, and it was the fact that the snapshot was in the past, right. And people kept farming for ages afterwards. And there was a bunch of people who, like, miraculously withdrew the day after. So, yeah, it was in the charts. So, guys, what are your takes? Who wants to start here?
00:02:13.392 - 00:02:39.082, Speaker D: I can start. So let's see. I think the two is the non transferability and the geo blocking. I think the non transferability is not a massive deal. I understand why teams want to do this. It's also not necessarily terrible for users because, I mean, I'm not like a tax lawyer or anything, but I'm pretty sure they're just zero basis when you get them because there's, like, no value to them. They're, like, actually valueless.
00:02:39.082 - 00:03:15.870, Speaker D: So I don't know if that's the worst thing. Like, element finance did this a few years ago, and it didn't work out well. For them, safe just did this. They just made their token transferable after like two years or something of not being transferable. I think the reason people don't like it, one of the nice features about airdrops is that they actually go to, obviously there's a lot of sibling and airdrops, so you gotta keep that always in the back of your mind. But they do go to like retail participants before anybody else gets liquidity on the investment. Right.
00:03:15.870 - 00:03:52.734, Speaker D: And so that's always been like the nice thing about it is that if you get this airdrop of this project and it launches at like this really high ftv, that you don't think sustainable, you, as retail getting this airdrop token, actually have the ability to like sell it before team and private investors can. So that's always been like a nice feature of airdrops to me. And by making it non transferable and by starting the like unlock clock for team and investors at the same time, it's not clear that like, it's not clear that by the time it's transferable, everybody else also won't be unlocked at the same time too. Right.
00:03:52.894 - 00:03:54.830, Speaker B: That's not clear. They haven't.
00:03:54.982 - 00:03:58.134, Speaker D: Well, it's like up to like governance proposals and stuff like, well they have.
00:03:58.134 - 00:04:06.742, Speaker C: To meet benchmarks, right. And so that's once they meet those benchmarks, the unlocks will happen. So I think it's reasonable to assume that they will happen before team and investors.
00:04:06.798 - 00:04:17.314, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, we're investors in, in eigen layer and see the disclaimers at the end for none of this is investment advice, et cetera. But, yeah, keep going.
00:04:17.854 - 00:04:20.034, Speaker D: So that's like the first one. I don't know if we.
00:04:21.094 - 00:04:22.834, Speaker B: What are the benchmarks for them.
00:04:24.614 - 00:05:02.660, Speaker A: That teams do? This non transferability thing is someone who's kind of dealt with these token considerations. A lot is just legal advice. Right. And in general, a lot of these things are just legal advice, like the non transferability. The idea is that if you have a non transferable token and then eventually you distribute it broadly enough that the DAO itself can vote to make a transferable, and you or the team didn't vote in that decision, or didn't have a controlling vote in that decision, then it's harder for the SEC or a regulator to argue that it was you that did this. And it's the same thing with the VPN blocking. The reason they do that is to.
00:05:02.660 - 00:05:38.840, Speaker A: To avoid the US. So yeah, I understand the argument for it. I also think there's some benefits to it in terms of the advantage of points to some extent is that you don't have a token price. And so you can imagine whatever token price you want and have this mental masturbation which people do with these spreadsheets and stuff and with non transferability, kind of allows you to keep doing that to, to some extent. You know, I have another season of Eigen layer is going to trade at 20 bill or 40 bill or whatever, and people can. So it can keep the stuff going longer. I mean, I'm kind of, it's, it's.
00:05:38.872 - 00:06:33.812, Speaker C: Kind of, I think that the big, the big issue is, is basically the disconnect between expectations, which, you know, that people had when they deposited those tokens, which are based on, you know, what market norms are. Right. That's if you're, when you're participating in these airdrops, you assume unless the protocol is telling you otherwise, it'll proceed like most do, and most usually give you the token upfront. So I think that's really where the source of frustration is, because this was a long airdrop, so there's a lot of opportunity costs and then a lot of risks that was taken. So it's not purely a free lunch. And so you had the fact that there was no discussion around these not being unlocked when, when they were expected to be. And then I think the geo blocking is, a VPN blocking is pretty, as a bit of a rug.
00:06:33.812 - 00:06:38.908, Speaker C: Right. Because you allow them to participate but not claim any of the benefits.
00:06:38.996 - 00:07:03.712, Speaker D: So this is the one. Yeah. So this is the one that actually I feel pretty strongly about. I understand that on transferability. I don't think it's, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I like, understand why they're doing it, but I just don't think that you should be giving out points to people without geo blocking for like a year. And then when you launch it, you block all these people.
00:07:03.712 - 00:07:38.374, Speaker D: Because, and I hate the tweets on Twitter where people just talk about, oh, another airdrop, people are complaining about free money. It's like, no, these people that you're geo blocking 100% have lost money by being in this protocol, which has helped the protocol. It has helped the protocols metrics, right? It has helped them look stronger, higher TVL, more like demand. And they paid a real cost by, you know, there wasn't a lot of risk with Eigen. It was just the smart contracts, if those could get hacked. But there is some non zero risk there. And then there's the opportunity cost of just locking up.
00:07:38.374 - 00:07:48.790, Speaker D: That money for like a year and you're giving these people points for like a year and then at the end you're saying oh no, you're actually not getting anything for this the whole time.
00:07:48.902 - 00:07:58.550, Speaker A: Yeah. How many people are actually not going to be able to like use a VPN or travel or whatever to, to claim this airdrop? I feel like most people will, I don't know.
00:07:58.742 - 00:08:07.462, Speaker D: They said that they're going to blacklist addresses if any. If any. Like. Yeah. Like I think they're being pretty strict on it.
00:08:07.518 - 00:08:11.118, Speaker B: Yeah. That's what I'm going to ask. Could you just fly? So they're blocking VPN's.
00:08:11.246 - 00:08:16.158, Speaker D: Yeah, you could if you did. If you had a lot. Yeah. You probably want to fly somewhere. I guess it's probably worth.
00:08:16.206 - 00:08:22.542, Speaker A: But you blacklist an address if they, if they like connected from the US that'd be pretty ridiculous.
00:08:22.598 - 00:08:22.790, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:22.822 - 00:08:24.518, Speaker A: That doesn't mean you're a US citizen.
00:08:24.646 - 00:08:35.630, Speaker D: So that's my issue with it. And it's because they did points. Listen, if you don't do points then whatever. Like there's a lot of, a lot of protocols like let's get into points and everything.
00:08:35.702 - 00:08:56.776, Speaker A: Then before I, as the next, the next topic, just one note. I do think the non transferability and starting the investor ticket like clock and team at the same time is dodgy. I feel like the spirit of the, of the cliff is that it starts once the token is liquid. Right. And so really the clock should start once the token becomes.
00:08:56.840 - 00:09:06.944, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. When I said I don't care about the, I agree. I think the non transferable. Non transferability is fine with like the clock not starting at the same time.
00:09:06.984 - 00:09:31.960, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the clock starting certainly bad, but it's, it's only really bad if there's an overlap where one is starting to unlock either at the same time. So basically if you have team unlocking around the same time as airdrop, that'd be really bad. But it's, and I think it's also still bad if it's pretty close. Right. Because those unlocks start to get priced in and it's pretty detrimental to those who farmed and kind of the value of their airdrop.
00:09:32.152 - 00:09:55.308, Speaker D: Yeah. And also let's like this last comment on this again because I feel strongly about this is like airdrop farmers do deserve compensation. Like they are, they are taking risk and like I hate the idea. I understand like not liking civil farmers and everything. Like 100% agree with all that. A lot of these protocols would have zero users. Listen nobody.
00:09:55.308 - 00:10:14.924, Speaker D: There's no point to have Eigen. We created $8 billion of LRT's because people were farming points. Like, there's been no product here yet besides points. Right. And this is like a lot of money that's gone into this and people taking risk. And so I don't think it's fair to, like, call them entitled and everything.
00:10:15.264 - 00:10:18.192, Speaker A: Yes, I agree. Should we.
00:10:18.248 - 00:10:43.670, Speaker C: I think it depends on, it depends on kind of where. What you're doing for those points. Right. If it's. If you're, if you're actually taking risk or there's opportunity cost or you're providing liquidity, then by all means, I agree that, you know, the, that value is deserved. And then certain things on, on kind of the, the other end of the spectrum where, you know, it's just kind of logging in and interacting that way. It's, it's.
00:10:43.670 - 00:10:54.854, Speaker C: You have a bit smaller of an argument to deserve those points because they're not really taking much risk. You're kind of just gaming it to some extent, which, you know, it's, it's still a valuable metric to the protocol. It helps them.
00:10:54.934 - 00:10:57.118, Speaker A: Let's move on to points then. Let's. Let's move on to points.
00:10:57.206 - 00:10:58.454, Speaker D: No, just on that, though. I saw.
00:10:58.534 - 00:11:03.838, Speaker C: I was going to. I think it's worth going into this a bit more, though, just because we've done points already and we haven't.
00:11:03.926 - 00:11:09.462, Speaker A: I mean, like the whole meta people were saying on Twitter, like, points. Eigen Lair has killed points.
00:11:09.558 - 00:11:12.406, Speaker D: Yeah, but we can still go into points. Let's finish this, like, section.
00:11:12.470 - 00:11:17.846, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think it expands beyond just like. Yeah, go ahead, I'll finish it up.
00:11:18.030 - 00:11:31.266, Speaker D: Oh, no, all I had to say is that, like, I saw a funny discord thing the other day about someone asking if they get points for saying GM in the discourse. Like, people can't even just say GM because they want to say GM anymore. They need to get points for it.
00:11:31.350 - 00:11:33.746, Speaker A: So that was the. No, that was the point you needed to make.
00:11:33.770 - 00:11:36.482, Speaker D: No, no. It seemed like yon wanted to keep going on this topic.
00:11:36.538 - 00:11:51.354, Speaker C: Well, I was going to go into more. Just kind of the, the, I guess going into kind of what we've seen on Twitter, which is the animosity towards VC's and that whole element. I don't know, I feel like.
00:11:51.394 - 00:11:54.402, Speaker B: Yeah, well, this whole thing is, like, pretty bad. I feel like.
00:11:54.458 - 00:12:14.122, Speaker C: I agree. This is bad. Yeah, this is. There's no real supporting argument for this. Like, I think everyone looked at it as soon as it came out and just kind of. It's hard to defend the approach, but it's worth noting that, you know, a lot of this stuff isn't really VC driven. Right.
00:12:14.122 - 00:12:20.934, Speaker C: And so I think, you know, you end up kind of pointing the finger that way. But it's not really the case that.
00:12:23.194 - 00:12:29.068, Speaker B: Like, the team and the VC is probably like, if you start the clock at the same time and like, well, that.
00:12:29.116 - 00:12:31.220, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
00:12:31.292 - 00:12:32.612, Speaker B: And, like, don't give an airdrop of.
00:12:32.628 - 00:12:54.672, Speaker C: It to, like, you kind of, like, crypto Twitter all of a sudden kind of became socialists all the. When price starts going down, it's. It's, you know, how. How dare these people make money on their investments. I agree in this. This is not in that uniform, but I think that perspective was, you know, applied as a blanket to the entire space.
00:12:54.728 - 00:12:56.968, Speaker B: And more broadly, I think a lot.
00:12:56.976 - 00:13:33.290, Speaker A: Of VC's would agree that the timer should start when the token becomes transferable and not transferable token is issued for sure. But, yeah, it's a short term game, have way less impact than people think on these protocol decisions. And also, VC's don't benefit from protocols, like botching their airdrops. If anything, you're harmed from it alongside everyone else. So I don't know, I think the sentiment is. Yeah, it's like whenever price goes down, people start with a sentiment and, well, I was like, retail only sees. Yeah, go on, go on.
00:13:33.442 - 00:13:47.682, Speaker B: Like Duncan VC's. I think that, well, like, I've been saying this since we started recording this, that these low flow, high tv things are just fucking going to ruin the industry. And no one cared because everyone was making money. And now it's all agreed with you.
00:13:47.778 - 00:13:48.614, Speaker A: What do you mean?
00:13:49.374 - 00:13:59.494, Speaker B: I know, but, like, I feel like when you're saying, like, people complaining on Twitter, like, you know, not that many people were complaining on Twitter about it until stuff started going down and people realized what was happening and like, oh, this is actually a matter.
00:13:59.534 - 00:14:13.806, Speaker C: Well, it's going down. It's not like these VC's are selling. All this stuff is locked. Like, the only people that have actually made money are people who got airdrops and sold. Like, the only unlocks that are happening are from the previous cycle. It's these new ones are unlocking.
00:14:13.870 - 00:14:20.118, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think. But, like, they can. Well, when. When does Celeste. I feel like Celestial is like the first one. That's like October.
00:14:20.118 - 00:14:20.758, Speaker B: October.
00:14:20.886 - 00:14:23.302, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, we're halfway there and we.
00:14:23.318 - 00:14:25.886, Speaker B: Had our pop in, which is from last cycle, and our.
00:14:25.950 - 00:14:34.382, Speaker C: Exactly, like, this whole, like, the only people that have made money are airdrop farmers and traders like this, you're yelling at VC's who are still locked up and doing nothing.
00:14:34.438 - 00:14:45.426, Speaker B: It really is, you know, it's gonna. If we think this is bad, just wait till the VC's unlock and we're in some real trouble. Like, it just shows.
00:14:45.490 - 00:14:49.466, Speaker C: Then it's like, boo, capitalism. I mean, like, no, it's just the.
00:14:49.490 - 00:15:16.438, Speaker B: Way that they're designing this shit is so ridiculous. And the way that people are, I feel like just like aping into these things that don't really, you know, it's like even when you looked at Eigen layer at like a billion dollar valuation, I feel like a lot of the conversations a lot of VC's are having, it's like, yeah, like this is like super Ethel line is probably going to pump, like, if they do, if they have a good launch. But like, does the business model even make sense?
00:15:16.526 - 00:15:16.774, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:16.814 - 00:15:23.382, Speaker B: Like at $8 billion of staked eth, like, is there even demand for these liquid restate staking tokens?
00:15:23.518 - 00:15:23.790, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:23.822 - 00:15:37.492, Speaker B: It's more just everyone thinks it's going to make money at like a 500 mil val or a billion dollar val because, you know, you get these optics in there, you hype it up and then you just try and sell the tokens. It's not like, oh, this is going to help bootstrap a whole new, you.
00:15:37.508 - 00:15:42.220, Speaker A: Know, I think maybe we can go into the, I think we have another ducket to go into.
00:15:42.252 - 00:16:25.190, Speaker D: The actual fundamentals of Duncan's point though. Like we were, Duncan is right here, is that we created a whole new vertical and changed like actual fundamental eth market structure over like an unproven protocol. Like, like, it's not like eigen layer launched and then there's a lot of demand for avss and restaking. And then all these LRT's got made. We made all this before, right? Like, we made all these products, all these LRT's took all this money out of Lido, out of all these other places. We did all this like way before. It's actually proven that, like this is going to be a real thing just based off hype, right? Like that's the backwards part of this industry.
00:16:25.342 - 00:16:25.774, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:25.854 - 00:16:37.716, Speaker C: It's not going to be a real thing for VC. Like it's not going to be profitable for VC's or it might be like a little bit unless it becomes a real thing, right? Right now it's only profitable for the farmers and the airdrop. And I think that a lot of.
00:16:37.740 - 00:16:42.184, Speaker B: These will still make money. Like what, it has to go down 90% for VC's to be underwater.
00:16:42.604 - 00:16:42.916, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:42.940 - 00:16:54.388, Speaker C: But if you're describing the reckoning that you think is coming on some of this stuff then I know. Especially when you consider opportunity cost and when the investments were made. Right? Like a lot of these were made years ago.
00:16:54.556 - 00:17:11.219, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know if the VC's will get unscathed either because there's so many of them that are like this, right? I mean the best projects that like don't make any fundamental sense like on terms of their $10 billion plus valuation. So VC's might end up getting screwed.
00:17:11.331 - 00:17:14.707, Speaker C: I think a lot of VC's will underperform for sure. It's.
00:17:14.795 - 00:17:19.619, Speaker D: Listen, how many, how many VC's are going to outperform if they just like.
00:17:19.691 - 00:17:36.303, Speaker B: The ones that, the ones that outperform are literally the ones that like get into these rounds and are just trying to extract the value immediately as soon as they can. Like get me out of this at a 50% discount. Get me out of this thing. 10 billion, 20 billion, whatever it is for solutions yet.
00:17:37.584 - 00:17:39.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean do they keep getting in?
00:17:39.664 - 00:17:51.044, Speaker B: But do they keep getting in? Those species that are going to do well is super extractive. They know it's not worth anything and they're just like have these big headline numbers and it's like, get me the hell out of this thing.
00:17:51.584 - 00:18:29.860, Speaker A: I mean I think in some market scenarios that's the case and in others it isn't right. Like a lot of people, there's a lot of examples last cycle where people sold Seoul and Luna right way too early as VC's that got in it. It just depends if the project ends up being real or not. And of course these things are super hyped. But hype is like a pricing in of future expectations of what this will do. Right? Like the Eigen layer has hype because people think rightly or wrongly, and obviously like you guys think wrongly, that it's going to be super important for the Ethereum ecosystem. And so like what is the solution here? Like you can't stop hype.
00:18:29.860 - 00:18:35.988, Speaker A: Like VC's are locked. Like everything that's happening in public markets is just retail, on retail violence that they then blame on.
00:18:36.156 - 00:18:37.412, Speaker B: No, but I think that's.
00:18:37.428 - 00:18:38.596, Speaker A: And then the other point on VC's.
00:18:38.620 - 00:18:42.180, Speaker B: Is just that are hyping these projects out.
00:18:42.332 - 00:18:59.140, Speaker A: The other point of like the thought leaders. Yeah, but you, that, that's, that's like the incentives, right? That's, that, that's just markets. Um, you invested because you're hyped and because you invested, you're incentivized to hype. Like, it's. It's. It's not like they were born with these bags. Right.
00:18:59.140 - 00:19:21.764, Speaker A: They chose to invest in them and therefore they're excited about it and we'll share their, their thoughts on them. If they're saying, like, misleading or like false things, that's another thing. But I don't. I don't think that dynamic in itself is. Is the problematic one. I don't know. I agree that, like, the VC's, crypto VC's specifically, like the brand name VC's are in a very privileged position where they have access to these.
00:19:21.764 - 00:19:51.734, Speaker A: To these deals very early on. But I also think retail misses out on the fact that for every Eigen layer, there's like a hundred or a thousand things that never launch, never launch a product, never launch a token, never do anything. And a lot of these investments and things that are launching this cycle or last cycle are made at the bottom of the bear, where crypto. Twitter is comparing crypto to online poker and saying it's dead. It's just going to be like online poker in 2008 or whatever. Everyone's desperate. A lot of these rounds.
00:19:51.734 - 00:20:11.894, Speaker A: I don't know, it's worth keeping that context in mind. While I agree that it's flawed, that's why we're incubating this ICO protocol. That's why we're super hyped about stuff like Echo. Like, I think there's. There's better ways to do this stuff, but I don't really see what the. What the solution is. Like these things.
00:20:12.674 - 00:20:19.894, Speaker C: It's just. It's like individual examples extrapolated to the entire space is kind of the mistake that's being made. I think.
00:20:20.674 - 00:20:28.778, Speaker B: I think there's like a lot of these projects that have launched in the past three months, like one a week type thing.
00:20:28.906 - 00:20:35.170, Speaker C: Right. And then we'll see what happens when those unlocks. Right? Like, there's no guarantee that these VC's are actually going to make any money.
00:20:35.362 - 00:20:37.754, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. A lot of these guys.
00:20:37.794 - 00:21:12.272, Speaker C: Underperform is a lot. A lot of these like VC's. If you look historically on the crypto side, it's, you know, and similar to just traditional VC where it's very power law. You'll have one or two winners that'll really do well and then you'll end up not making money on the rest, but all of those other ones that you don't make money on. Plenty of people are right. Like, to some extent, VC's are subsidizing the farming and the gains that other people are having by interacting with these protocols. And there's no guarantee that they'll actually make any money on it.
00:21:12.448 - 00:21:22.964, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so we've. We. Yeah, we talked about the RBC's evil. Should we talk about points? That's the other thing that people have been reacting to, the Eigen layer.
00:21:27.184 - 00:21:29.392, Speaker B: Like, everyone's at this stupid take.
00:21:29.488 - 00:21:31.512, Speaker C: No, that's a bad take.
00:21:31.648 - 00:21:39.604, Speaker A: That's how saying this take. All right, can we summarize then, why it's a bad take and then move, and then we can move on quickly? I agree that it's a bad take, by the way.
00:21:40.624 - 00:22:26.654, Speaker C: Again, it's pointing at one bad example and throwing the entire model out the window because of one bad example. Points are just a derivative of tokens that you receive without getting tokens. So it's just like another kind of game of incentives that's being played. But directionally, they're very similar in terms of what they accomplish and what you do. It's just a more precise way of distributing incentives throughout seasons, and particularly a good way to get a decent amount of supply. It actually helps reduce the low float high FTV problem because it allows for people to farm these tokens and get benefits without actually having to distribute them. And so you either distribute the tokens.
00:22:26.654 - 00:22:55.564, Speaker C: So imagine if you didn't have points and you distributed tokens right away, you'd exacerbate the low float high FTD problem, right? But if you can actually, instead of giving out 3% of supply, you can give out 10% through points and then release all ten at once in a granular way. Right. So the points are accumulating, but you don't. You don't. You're not having the low float high FTE problem. So it actually helps you launch with a higher initial float because you've been doing points and you can be much more precise and there's less chaos.
00:22:55.644 - 00:23:00.404, Speaker A: You don't need a governance proposal to change, to change them and stuff like this. Yeah, I agree with all that points.
00:23:00.444 - 00:23:02.484, Speaker C: You'Re kind of against tokens. It's like.
00:23:02.604 - 00:23:34.166, Speaker A: No, no, no, I disagree. So, first of all, I agree with you in general that points are here to stay. And they've also been, like, super profitable for users. Athena was ridiculous. Even Eigen Lair, which is universally hated, was probably like a 50% APY. If you're in from the beginning on ETH, which is the best yield on ETH out there, and some of the Solana ones were even more ridiculous, especially for smaller amounts of capital. But to steel man the other side, or what Gabe would say, and we're having these discussions in the company chat, they're not the same as tokens because they're fully trustful.
00:23:34.166 - 00:23:58.770, Speaker A: It's literally an entry in a centralized database. They don't have to issue the tokens to the point, sort of, if they don't want to, they can issue whatever number they want. It's completely intransparent. They can do stuff like block VPN, block VPN, block every country. They could do whatever they want. You're fully in their hands. So it's moving from tokens so that they're the same mechanically, but in terms of trust, they're like a fully centralized version.
00:23:58.770 - 00:24:02.954, Speaker A: Right. That's the issue that gave us. That's like the tokens you could say are similar.
00:24:03.114 - 00:24:26.530, Speaker C: You can argue tokens are similar, like tokens. You could, in theory, geoblock participants after they deposit liquidity. And so when they have to claim the token, you can say, you know, you can apply the same rules. And so it's, it's slightly less centralized, but directionally is still similar. Like you can still rug people in the same. Like the risks to that you're describing for points can still be applied to the token size.
00:24:26.562 - 00:24:29.946, Speaker A: Well, if you're doing token smaller degree farming, you'd be doing.
00:24:29.970 - 00:24:37.922, Speaker C: Yeah, but then you have, like, when you go claim. When you go claim, you can say no, right? Like it's, it's, it's still centralized in that sense in terms of what they.
00:24:37.938 - 00:24:47.534, Speaker B: Can have when they kind of, when it's liquid, like, you know, the granularity of how to distribute it and like, also the low float issues.
00:24:47.834 - 00:24:51.754, Speaker C: But yeah, I feel like there's definitely differences between them.
00:24:51.874 - 00:25:05.270, Speaker B: The point similar people, like, feel like they're earning something over time. So you can kind of like string that carrot out over a really long period, like I did for a very long time. I think hyper liquid's done a really good job at it. Like, I don't see parts going away anywhere.
00:25:05.382 - 00:25:28.956, Speaker A: And also you can keep doing them after the token is live. Right. You can do season twos and season threes like Athena's doing. And again, it just allows you to move really quick in terms of like, shifting incentives around and stuff like this. I agree. They're here to stay. I do think there's going to be like one, at least major rug where the project team gets like subpoenaed or even an injunction before they ever launch their token and points.
00:25:28.956 - 00:26:01.784, Speaker A: People just never get anything because no one is going to go against, against that to like Lord said, so going to do right by the community. So I don't think Eigen layer was the biggest rug. I think we'll have like way bigger rugs with, with this system. And it's just like, unfortunately, table stakes. But yeah, let's, should we move on to Eigen Lair and like itself? What people thought they released this intersubjective work token, which, you know, a lot of people were, were trolling the sort of overly academic nature of the paper and stuff.
00:26:01.904 - 00:26:05.208, Speaker D: Sorry, that's like made up term.
00:26:05.336 - 00:26:12.176, Speaker A: So I mean, that's, that's pretty much the, what we do in crypto though, right? We just, we like make up terms and listen.
00:26:12.200 - 00:26:51.536, Speaker D: So, yeah, so basically, so basically, yeah, so basically, you know, restaking with ethanol. And this is like the fundamental reason why they need an Eigen token is that when you restake with ETH, you can only slash it for like attributable on chain events. Right? And so easiest, easy, easiest examples of this is like a validated double signs. You can prove that on chain, you can go ahead and slash the ETH. Okay. But there's a lot of faults that you can't prove with any on chain data. And these could be like oracle mispricing or like data withholding.
00:26:51.536 - 00:27:17.970, Speaker D: Okay, and data withholding. And like a DA layer is the most dangerous attack. And you have to like resort to social, social slashing through that. And so that's essentially like why the Eigen token is plugged in here. It is to, you know, you can't use, if there's like a, if there's like a data withholding attack on Eigen dA, you can't slash the ETH without like forking Ethereum.
00:27:18.162 - 00:27:20.906, Speaker A: And so at this point, you can slash the ETH.
00:27:21.090 - 00:27:27.122, Speaker D: To be clear, that's our data. Not for data withholding, not for a non attributable fault. You only slash.
00:27:27.218 - 00:28:18.078, Speaker A: I mean, the committee can choose to slash the ETH. That's, that's restated to Eigen layer for sure. The issue is what you're saying that you can't go down all the way if you disagree with the committee, you can't fork ETh, right? And that's where the Eigen token comes in. They have this, this sort of defense against mob rule or majority rule where you can actually fork the Eigen token and then the entire crypto community can effectively decide. So not just the committee, not just Eigen token holders, the entire crypto community effectively gets to vote on this dispute by choosing which fork to support. That's, I think, what the difference is, because social consensus ultimately to me means like, who decides what chain is valid, right? What fork is valid. And that's what like Vitalik wrote about with his concerns with eigen layer and don't overload ethereum social consensus.
00:28:18.078 - 00:29:31.200, Speaker A: And so, like this to me is, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it's like a really elegant way of creating this like, effectively crypto native court system where you can adjudicate on subjective disputes or inter subjective, whatever you want to call them, things that, like, reasonable people can agree on, which is, if you think about it, as all the things that we, that we specify in legal contracts, right? Like legal contracts, there's very few things that are deterministic about the world and about, like, coordination generally. Like you can maybe specify like a revenue target and an earn out or something like this. But even that, like, you know, can be, can have some fuzziness to it. Most things are like reasonable expectations, best efforts, like there's all this fuzzy language in legal contracts or even in oracle disputes and things like this. And I feel like that's what this, like, you're extending this proof of stake like slashing mechanism, skin in the game slashing mechanism to any subjective dispute in this really elegant way that's pretty well thought out where you're not dependent on a committee because you have the ability to do this fork rule, unlike Aragon court or Klaras before it. So I don't know, I thought it was pretty interesting, actually. Like, I don't know what.
00:29:31.232 - 00:29:40.624, Speaker D: Just like, not sure that's the thing. Like, I'm not sure who's going to actually want to use this. I think that all the most of the AVss are just going to be first party eigen layer ones.
00:29:40.744 - 00:29:42.920, Speaker A: I think an oracle is low hanging fruit.
00:29:43.032 - 00:30:04.744, Speaker D: Yeah, but Eigen will probably just do that. Eigen Oracle. And so I think that Eigen will just start looking more and more like an l one in that sense where they just have their own abs's. And because I don't know, the incentive for a third party to come in and be like, yeah, we want to use Eigen. We want to use the e three stake. We want to use the Eigen token for these intersubjective faults. Like, where does the project's token, like, fall in here?
00:30:04.784 - 00:30:41.190, Speaker A: I agree, but I also don't think crypto primitives in general get invented in response to user needs. It's more like a cool primitive gets invented and then developers tinker with it until they find something that has, like, product market fit. I could think of use cases like, for instance, insurance for oracles. Right? As Oracle, like PIF, started implementing insurance models where you stake pith and you get. And you basically get some insurance that if they serve you a wrong price, you can get reimbursed for that. Then at some point, you might not want to just rely on pith for that. You might want a court that can.
00:30:41.190 - 00:31:22.210, Speaker A: If you disagree with Pith, if you think they fucked you and they should reimburse you, you can go to the Supreme Court and appeal it to eigen or whatever. Another example I can think of is circle release, their reversible token standard, which I thought was pretty, pretty interesting, which. The idea that you can wrap USDC or any token in this reversible token, and then there's a challenge period where you can challenge a transaction, and if the court agrees, you can revert it. Like the court. There could be an Eigen backed court, right? I think there's other things as well that you can think of that could be done with this. So, I don't know, I think it's. I'm a nerd for this stuff.
00:31:22.210 - 00:31:38.854, Speaker A: Like, I was bullish on arrogant court back in the day. Rest in peace. So. But I do think it's, like, very interesting and well thought out also the way they thought about, like, B. Eigen and Eigen and, like. So that Eigen can get integrated into defi. But be, you know, you can still fork.
00:31:38.854 - 00:31:40.934, Speaker A: I think it's pretty clever.
00:31:42.314 - 00:31:59.350, Speaker C: The court stuff is tricky, though. Like, even. Yeah. Just from doing the Aragon deep dive in 2020 and doing that, um, where you. The disconnect between the. The value at stake and. And the.
00:31:59.350 - 00:32:06.234, Speaker C: The recourse for bad judgments was. Was hard to match where, you know, the value.
00:32:08.014 - 00:32:09.114, Speaker A: That was the case.
00:32:10.174 - 00:32:23.262, Speaker C: Right. So basically, your decision impacts x dollars of value, but you're. It's hard to have those that are making the judgment have any. Anything, anywhere nearly that much at stake to ensure.
00:32:23.358 - 00:32:25.674, Speaker A: Well, that's what's cool about this model, though, right?
00:32:26.294 - 00:32:27.662, Speaker C: That's what I was going to go into. Yeah.
00:32:27.758 - 00:32:28.230, Speaker A: Oh, sorry.
00:32:28.262 - 00:32:43.614, Speaker C: Like, the fact that you can kind of tie, but. But you still have to have those individual users put up that stake, right? So, like, yes, you have. Eigen itself is incredibly valuable, but it's. It's also that the people making the decision have to have.
00:32:43.734 - 00:33:15.236, Speaker A: Well, the people making the decision can get slashed, but ultimately, any dispute is backed by the entire market cap of eigenvalue. Because of this fork choice rule, effectively because you can. So when, again, it's fresh in my mind. But basically, if you disagree with the dispute, you can initiate a fork. And then if your fork gets supported, basically your bounty is the entire eigen market cap. To some extent. Every dispute here is backed by all of the Eigen market cap.
00:33:15.236 - 00:33:23.574, Speaker A: And obviously, there's cost for. For creating disputes. So for very small disputes, it would never be economical for you to. For you to do this fork.
00:33:23.614 - 00:33:29.118, Speaker C: But, yeah, that would be the entire supply. Like, what if you have multiple disputes at the same time?
00:33:29.246 - 00:33:48.762, Speaker A: If you have multiple disputes at the same time, what do you mean? So I think the idea is that there will be some. There will be, like, an AV's or whatever that's staked Eigen on one dispute. But if you disagree with that, you can fork. Right. And then that's when you tap into the. Effectively, like, the entire market cap. I think it's.
00:33:48.858 - 00:34:02.930, Speaker D: It's pretty. It's pretty operational heavy. Operationally heavy for all these people, too, because you've got to run, like, you have to participate in, like, governance and social consensus on all these different abs's. Right?
00:34:03.042 - 00:34:09.090, Speaker A: For sure. I think very well paid. Right? Like, lawyers are very well paid. I think that the social. This. This stuff. More.
00:34:09.090 - 00:34:12.028, Speaker A: More. Yeah, I think it'll be pretty well paid.
00:34:12.196 - 00:34:25.708, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, in my opinion, eigen, it's, like, kind of interesting. I guess I'm not, like, as hyped as other people. I. It's possible that it turns out to be pretty successful. Yeah.
00:34:25.716 - 00:34:47.574, Speaker A: So I wasn't very hyped on the restaking stuff, because I think economic security is mostly a meme. Like, no one really cares. And also, you're kind of competing with projects, not launching their own native tokens to secure their stuff. So I didn't think there would be, like, too many use cases for that. Definitely nothing to justify a decent yield on $15 billion of capital. But this stuff, I think, opens up, like, a really massive market.
00:34:48.594 - 00:34:51.934, Speaker D: So is restaking the Trojan horse for them to launch a court?
00:34:53.834 - 00:35:21.052, Speaker A: I guess so, yeah, it's interesting. You basically have, like, EtH for anything that's, like, objective, you know, provably provable. And then if you want to tap into a social consensus, you have Eigen. You can even do, like, stack both, I think, you know, have, like, Eth as the base layer, then Eigen as a court of appeals or whatever. But, yeah, I don't want to belabor this. I know we want to move on to some other topics does anyone have anything else to say about Eigen or the. Or the airdrop? No.
00:35:21.052 - 00:35:36.292, Speaker A: All right, let's. Let's move on to markets then. We had a lot of people wanting us to talk about whether it's all over again. But I believe today we are back. So we kind of. Kind of missed time. That should have talked about it yesterday when it was over, but, yeah.
00:35:36.292 - 00:35:38.620, Speaker A: What does everyone think could be over.
00:35:38.652 - 00:35:43.144, Speaker C: In, like, an hour again? So, as an 1115 esT, we are back.
00:35:46.404 - 00:35:49.424, Speaker B: I think that. Yeah, you go.
00:35:50.404 - 00:36:55.124, Speaker C: No, I mean, the whole, it's over. Obviously, you can't say anything with certainty. It's all probabilities, but I'd say pretty low probability that it's over. You had a bunch of catalysts that kind of exhausted themselves, and so you had all the hype from the ETF and kind of everything else that happened. And so it's natural for there to be profit taking from people that were in it simply for that reason, particularly after multiple rejections of all time high. But bitcoin has kind of cemented itself now as a macro asset through these rails. And so I think you have the combination of slow drip from passive 401K buyers, which we've never really had before, and just rails and trust for buyers to come in that weren't route previously available.
00:36:55.124 - 00:37:38.024, Speaker C: So I think it will gradually trade more and more like a macro asset. Obviously, the narratives tend to change based on what happens, and so it's still somewhat of a new asset, but it's large enough now and institutionalized enough that I think the macro forces at play that everyone's kind of aware of over longer time horizons should be strong enough to serve as kind of tailwinds for bitcoin. And we see bitcoin goes up. Everything else kind of does, too. And so I think for that reason alone, it's not really over, and it won't be for quite some time.
00:37:38.884 - 00:37:58.534, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, when I look at the chart, I see textbook complex pullback, so. But also, like, I don't know, today, it's like whenever bitcoin and Seoul are up and ETH BTC is down on the same day, that's kind of been, like, the textbook for this cycle so far, is, like, when those three things are all going on.
00:37:58.874 - 00:38:10.534, Speaker B: And so I think Seoul looks really good here. I'm also long soul disclosure, but I think it looks good. It got hammered from 200 down to 115.
00:38:10.954 - 00:38:11.694, Speaker D: So.
00:38:13.394 - 00:38:55.904, Speaker C: The auctions that were closing at such a minor discount to spot is incredibly bullish. Right. It's just like that. That is to some extent a floor and also just signaling the appetite. So, you know, you probably saw some selling that was happening from people that were long term soul bulls and say, you know, I'm going to hold this thing for a while anyway, so why not collect the spread in between the discount, basically. And so I'll sell it at 100 4150 and buy it in the auction at a discount. And if I'm selling it at the same future date either way, why not lock that in? And so I think that probably contributed to some of the selling.
00:38:55.904 - 00:39:09.664, Speaker C: But also now seeing how small of a difference there is between people willing to lock it up for years versus buying it spot is a pretty strong signal for just broader support for that asset.
00:39:09.744 - 00:39:18.594, Speaker B: Yeah. And for contacts, the auction. So the first set of auctions I think was like $60 sold or 65, 64.
00:39:18.714 - 00:39:44.562, Speaker D: And they sold two thirds of the estate of 41 Mil. And then this last one was only like 1.8, I think. So they still got like twelve Mil sold left. And the next one, I think they're opening it to like non us and then us accredited to the public. There's also people launching like spvs for this, but it's also, I think, just going to be a way to like rake fees.
00:39:44.738 - 00:40:21.672, Speaker A: So that's the thing, that's the thing that makes me a little bit less bullish. Definitely bullish given where the auction ended up. But there's a lot of people just raising spvs for this and with the staking yield that you get because you basically get staking yield on your principal. So you're effectively getting whatever. If you buy it at 50 and it's at 150 and it's like 7% yield, you're getting like 21% yield. Right. So it ends up like looking very attractive for trad five boomers that probably don't even know how to buy this, this stuff spot.
00:40:21.672 - 00:40:31.984, Speaker A: And so there's a bunch of people spinning up spvs and doing Dex for this. As someone who got, who had sent a few, which makes me a little bit less bullish. But yeah, they still have the.
00:40:32.024 - 00:40:37.720, Speaker C: But the spvs are still racing. Yeah, I was gonna say it's still people saying yes. Yeah, for sure, for sure.
00:40:37.792 - 00:40:48.948, Speaker B: They should be getting tricked a little bit. But literally the sole prices at 120 yesterday, like 122 yesterday morning and it just announced it closed at 100. It's like, okay, I'm going to take a four year lock on, like, you know.
00:40:48.996 - 00:40:52.844, Speaker D: Yeah, but it wasn't trading. But it wasn't trading there when like.
00:40:52.884 - 00:40:57.940, Speaker B: The bids were due but, like, I feel like it was trading at like, maybe 130.
00:40:58.092 - 00:41:11.530, Speaker D: No, it was like. It was like 150 ish. I think the bids were due April 25. That's what the article said, at least. And if you look, it was around like 150 then. So it's like a one third discount. April closed around 100.
00:41:11.530 - 00:41:13.602, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's when they were.
00:41:13.618 - 00:41:19.202, Speaker B: Doing is at 140. Yeah. So still. I still feel like that's pretty.
00:41:19.298 - 00:41:33.134, Speaker C: Pretty good on the we're back, it's over thing. Right. I think part of what's contributing are the pretty big outflows, and, well, so part of it's, you know.
00:41:35.484 - 00:41:36.156, Speaker D: Crypto, Twitter.
00:41:36.180 - 00:42:17.424, Speaker C: And the crypto space as a whole is really tracking every single tick of every single thing. And so you're gonna. If you see a consistent stream of inflows, and then all of a sudden it changes it. Like, everyone thinks it's, you know, complete reverses, but if you look, you know, these ETF's have inflows have outflows. You know, why do they have inflows and outflows? It's people are basically, you know, people holding the ETF shares are trading, and then the AP's come in, and basically. So the idea is, if someone sells a bunch of ETF shares, an AP would come in if, you know, they. So it's the market cap of the ETF.
00:42:17.424 - 00:43:08.010, Speaker C: So I bit shares times price, and then it's the market cap, the ETF relative to the nav of the underlying. So how many bitcoin the ETF is holding times bitcoin price. And so when people come in and start selling the shares, you basically have a discount where the market cap of the shares is cheaper than the nav. So you can come in as an AP, which is Jane street and other businesses buy the market cap by the ETF shares and then redeem it for the underlying and sell the bitcoin. So it's not like this massive effort. It's just kind of people trading in and out. I think probably what surprised people a bit was the expectation that these were, you know, diamond handed buyers, because it's, you know, partially mom and pop, and partially, you know, a bunch of others buying for the long run in their 401k or buying passively in other strategies.
00:43:08.010 - 00:43:27.394, Speaker C: And so I think that's probably what shook people, where there's that disconnect. But ultimately, it doesn't really take that much to create outflows. It's just, you know, if they're selling and there's not really that much of a bid in the ETF, then the market cap will trade at a discount and cause a lot of redemption. So I think, yeah, there's.
00:43:27.434 - 00:43:33.694, Speaker D: I mean, it went from 74 to 56. I don't know why you wouldn't have outflows, like.
00:43:34.554 - 00:43:46.294, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty steady other than the grayscale up until yesterday, and then, like, fidelity puked a lot. Like, this is the biggest non grayscale outflow there's been, like.
00:43:46.754 - 00:43:51.644, Speaker D: Yeah, there was over. There's over half a bill yesterday, which includes grayscale, but still.
00:43:52.144 - 00:44:25.032, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think that flows. Yeah, but I think, like, even, like, the top. Right. Was when just, like, you know, flows into the ETF kind of topped out, and then flows in, the ETF just kind of went sideways for, like, seven weeks. And I think the bottom could be, like, this big puke of outflows, but we'll see. Like, I think Bitcoin's holding up pretty well considering that if this had happened, like, when there's, like, more leverage in the system, I could have seen us, like, puking on that. But leverage really got cleaned out.
00:44:25.032 - 00:44:33.856, Speaker B: Like, ois down, like, almost 30, like a third, from 75 billion down to, like, 50 billion. And funding is pretty much.
00:44:33.880 - 00:44:37.008, Speaker D: Reset funding is back to, like, October, November.
00:44:37.056 - 00:44:37.844, Speaker C: Bitcoin.
00:44:38.144 - 00:44:38.680, Speaker B: Pardon?
00:44:38.752 - 00:44:40.240, Speaker C: Alt stop going down.
00:44:40.432 - 00:44:41.868, Speaker B: Yeah, it was.
00:44:41.916 - 00:44:50.944, Speaker C: Yeah, almost like you had that big wipe and then also floored. And whereas BTC is still kind of making lower lows. Or not lower lows, but, yeah, trending lower.
00:44:51.284 - 00:44:53.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I think things look pretty good. Right.
00:44:53.484 - 00:45:05.504, Speaker C: The good thing on the GPC side is that's, like an expiring negative catalyst. Right. As those flows, there's. There's only. There's a. There's a set amount, and they can only really. Once that runs out.
00:45:06.524 - 00:45:12.984, Speaker A: All right, can we. I find this flow shit so boring. Can we. Can we move on? And you want to keep talking about this a little bit longer?
00:45:14.324 - 00:45:16.660, Speaker D: Yeah, we can move on. I don't care about flows either.
00:45:16.812 - 00:45:17.544, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:19.124 - 00:45:28.588, Speaker A: I mean, the last thing that we had on the duck is. Is a bit controversial. You guys thought it was too boring to talk about just the lending stuff. Do we want to touch?
00:45:28.636 - 00:45:29.704, Speaker B: You're getting bored.
00:45:31.844 - 00:45:36.784, Speaker D: Yeah, I know. Why don't you explain Aave four and why it's important.
00:45:37.934 - 00:45:45.518, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Jan's already looking at one of his other screens, basically, I.
00:45:45.526 - 00:45:49.918, Speaker B: Guess, on the market stuff to wrap up. I feel like we're feeling pretty good after this pullback.
00:45:49.966 - 00:45:50.830, Speaker A: We're bullish.
00:45:51.022 - 00:45:51.678, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:51.806 - 00:45:52.494, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:52.654 - 00:45:58.014, Speaker A: I'm always bullish before the pullback, though, to be honest. So, I mean, last week, were we bullish?
00:45:58.054 - 00:46:01.038, Speaker B: I feel like the tone was pretty sad last week.
00:46:01.206 - 00:46:03.634, Speaker A: That's true, actually. You got. Yeah. Or two weeks ago.
00:46:04.574 - 00:46:06.614, Speaker D: Yeah, we had Jason on the bear.
00:46:06.654 - 00:46:11.382, Speaker A: King who turned meme king. Yeah.
00:46:11.518 - 00:46:31.334, Speaker B: I think things are looking decent here. But I am. The one thing that I think it would be cool to talk about the market dynamics is like, I agree, bitcoin is going to recover, but it's kind of. Then you go into all these alts, which obviously if bitcoin goes up these altar, probably going to go up again. But I still feel like there's a lot more supply on the market of these coins.
00:46:31.494 - 00:46:33.630, Speaker D: No, like, the dispersion is definitely real.
00:46:33.742 - 00:46:39.714, Speaker A: We've talked about this, like, loads. Right. This actually high fdvs and unlocks.
00:46:40.174 - 00:46:51.434, Speaker C: No, well, it's more. So what, what bounced. Right. Popcat and just sold memes bounce the hardest, which is. Yeah, hilarious. Like. Yeah, that.
00:46:51.434 - 00:46:55.954, Speaker C: It's pretty. Yeah, I'm still waiting for the games.
00:47:00.234 - 00:47:12.854, Speaker A: I find that. Yeah, there's also like this general angst. I think about this stuff. Right. Like the. A lot of people are pretty depressed about or angry about the memes. And then on the other side, there's people that are like, this is the future of culture or whatever.
00:47:12.854 - 00:47:43.452, Speaker A: I don't know, I feel like this bull cycle has been a bit disappointing in terms of actual innovation compared to past ones. Feels like a lot of infra. On infra. On infra, you know, with not many applications and then memes. And I do think, like, memes are interesting. Obviously, I'm long a bunch of memes, but I do think we need actual applications. If any of this stuff is going to be valuable outside of BTC, like, we need.
00:47:43.452 - 00:47:47.052, Speaker A: We need real applications that people enjoy.
00:47:47.148 - 00:48:41.200, Speaker C: Enjoy using the counter to that. And I'm in a similar camp where it's, I was, I think, more excited last time around because, you know, the primitives of Defi were being built and so there's still a lot of, you know, open space for what could happen. And I think, you know, everyone's imagination was kind of going wild. The argument for the meme stuff being constructive is that it is bringing in a lot of users. Granted, it's chasing these memes, but if we want to build apps, I think building apps, there's two kinds of approaches. You can build apps for the native user base and then you can try and build apps to bring in normies. It's definitely easier to build apps for the native user base because the onboarding frictions are different.
00:48:41.200 - 00:49:17.320, Speaker C: And so it's a lot easier for them to start engaging with your app. So what you can argue that memes are helping is they're increasing the low hanging tam for these apps. And so, yes, obviously longing memes and to some extent not enjoying longing them as much as longing stuff that you think is fundamentally compelling. But all of the users that are coming into chase memes are potential users for actual apps, rather than comfortable with.
00:49:17.352 - 00:50:25.722, Speaker B: Holding crypto, which I guess as a meme non enjoyer, is a decent use case. I feel like, honestly, the tokenization stuff, they're seeing BlackRock do a bit, like, that's one avenue where we could actually get some real use case that gets a really long road. I feel like the low hanging fruit and lower friction stuff is games. If we had some good games that, like, incorporated crypto to the economy, just like, actually fun games to play that people play for free already and dedicate, like, a lot of their life to, and also, you know, will spend a lot of money on. If you were to get like, a World of Warcraft level game of complexity and popularity and layer on crypto to that, like, I think it would be pretty epic. And I'm still kind of holding out for that. Cause that's like a Trojan horse into, like, the younger generation getting them, like, familiar with these digital currencies and assets and also, like, digital money that they could honestly, like, feel more comfortable holding over time than holding money in their bank account because it's like, really theirs can't be inflated away.
00:50:25.722 - 00:50:48.574, Speaker B: I think that's really where you see the mass adoption come from. I don't see, like, I don't really see where else it comes from. It's either like the very like, regulated, tokenized financial route or like, kind of money and, you know, countries, that financial system isn't as stable. And then the more one where like, you get a lot of people is games, I think is the big one.
00:50:48.694 - 00:51:29.792, Speaker C: But yeah, the development of just like now we're bringing in users for a bunch of different reasons, which was kind of, you know, super bullish on the crypto side. One thing on that front, on the user base side, curious, you know, you've seen the numbers that bases onboarding all these users and all these new addresses and, and there's, I forget how many. It's like 20 to 30 billion of USDC on base. What's. But I might haven't really seen, yeah, but I haven't really seen much activity, though. So I'm curious to see, like, to understand what if anyone has an opinion there. So what's actually happening in and.
00:51:29.792 - 00:51:30.444, Speaker C: And.
00:51:30.744 - 00:51:31.056, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:31.080 - 00:51:34.004, Speaker C: How those metrics have been so up and to the right.
00:51:36.934 - 00:51:38.982, Speaker B: I don't know. I haven't heard much.
00:51:39.078 - 00:51:41.354, Speaker A: I don't know. Yeah, there's not much to do on base.
00:51:41.774 - 00:51:46.034, Speaker C: Right. But like, there's like the dashboard showing the amount of new users.
00:51:47.254 - 00:51:52.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's Coinbase wallet, maybe that has like an onboarding flow there. I'm not too sure, honestly.
00:51:53.454 - 00:51:55.034, Speaker B: That could definitely be it.
00:51:55.374 - 00:52:05.776, Speaker A: Coinbase wallet is pretty good, by the way. The centralized exchange wallets in general are actually pretty good. In Dubai, I heard OKX has like 600 people working on their wallet, which blew my mind.
00:52:05.920 - 00:52:07.776, Speaker D: They have a big ordinals wallet now too.
00:52:07.840 - 00:52:09.004, Speaker B: 600 people.
00:52:09.424 - 00:52:54.046, Speaker A: Yeah. I was like, jesus. But it's a really good wallet. So, yeah, I think those use cases are interesting. I do still think tokens are a massive use case and meme coins kind of fall into that. And I think AI crypto is going to be a really big narrative, even just because of the fact that it's so hyped that it presents just such a massive bounty. If you're a smart AI developer and you want to build something, you can either join OpenAI and obviously make massive money, or you can launch a token and have way higher upside and be liquid versus getting OpenAI stock or whatever.
00:52:54.046 - 00:53:21.814, Speaker A: So I think that on its own is going to drive a bunch of interesting innovation. And I just see crypto as the business model for open source AI. So I'm kind of excited about that narrative alongside the game stuff and some of the others. Yeah. So the lending thing got rugged. I'll just do a quick summary on it, basically. So, yeah, with lending and like anything that has leverage, you have to decide on risk parameters.
00:53:21.814 - 00:53:44.600, Speaker A: Right. There needs to be some way to arrive at ltvs and. And liquidation levels and stuff like this. Historically, there's like two different approaches. The first one is delegate that decision to a group of incentivized people with skin in the game. That is, Aave delegates it to governance. As a user, you don't need to think about it, you just go in and deposit and trust that the Aave governance is doing a good job.
00:53:44.600 - 00:54:27.852, Speaker A: And historically they have, they've done a really good job. They survived through market cycles that killed most of the centralized lenders. And then the other approach, which is really interesting, which started off with Rari back in the day, is to make it more market driven. And you can basically make it market driven in two ways. The first one is to let anyone create a lending market and select their own parameters, their own oracle, their own LTV. And then basically lenders will choose which markets they want to deposit on based on who created them, the risk parameters, stuff like this. And there's kind of a market clearing, sort of the best lending markets compete on the market and hopefully win.
00:54:27.852 - 00:55:14.100, Speaker A: And that didn't really work with Rari, but it is working pretty well with Morpho, which is interesting. And then there's, I guess, a third approach to finding market rates, which is Ajna, where rather than delegating this to managers, you actually delegate it to the users themselves, who can set like ranges similar to Univ three. And then an Euler is somewhere in the middle too. I think Aave V four is really cool because it makes Aave kind of a middle ground between the more modular approach and the delegated approach. I think it's a really good, I think Aave is a really good product. I think this unified liquidity layer is a really good product. They're doing an app chain, or they talk about doing an app chain or, or an app specific roll up, which is pretty cool.
00:55:14.100 - 00:55:57.564, Speaker A: And in general, I just think it's awesome to see a project that literally has existed for like seven years, right, since it was lend in the ICO days, continued to build and innovate. Like you have this decentralized governance community that's effectively paying a centralized company to develop for them. And there's a bunch of different centralized companies that are all contributing to the governance. And to me, it's an example of actual innovation in deFi, cool stuff being built and decentralized governance working for better or for worse. It's very decentralized. All these arguments happen in public with Mark Zeller going mad at people and being rude and stanny weighing in and all this stuff. And I think, yeah, it's cool.
00:55:57.564 - 00:56:12.904, Speaker A: It's one of the OG crypto projects. So, yeah, that was it really. I think it's a more interesting product than. Well, I don't know. What do you guys think? I guess, do you have takes or do you want to just close it up?
00:56:16.084 - 00:56:20.264, Speaker D: I don't like how competitive is it going to be to like Morpho now?
00:56:23.044 - 00:56:50.624, Speaker A: I think Morpho is still going to be better for what they're good at. Like, you know, the maker Athena deal, or like these daos that want to do specific markets. Like, I think more Morpho is still going to be the go to for that. I think if you want to borrow against your assets, like in a generalized way. I still think Aave is going to be the best for that. It's like slightly different use cases. Yeah.
00:56:50.624 - 00:56:54.644, Speaker A: All right.
00:56:54.724 - 00:56:54.980, Speaker D: Yes.
00:56:55.012 - 00:56:59.612, Speaker A: You guys are right. That was a bit of a buzz. Go chewy.
00:56:59.668 - 00:57:01.864, Speaker D: I mean, I just don't know what to say.
00:57:02.764 - 00:57:04.624, Speaker B: What are people going to do with that information?
00:57:06.204 - 00:57:10.564, Speaker A: Just not be financial nihilists and say that it's all. It's all just memes and scams.
00:57:10.604 - 00:57:20.036, Speaker B: I know, but this is still funny, but this is all, like, I feel like the only thing. Okay. That's like the same with perfect. It's like we've built these, like, financialization tools, but we're still not doing anything.
00:57:20.060 - 00:57:21.452, Speaker D: Yeah, we still need the right product.
00:57:21.548 - 00:57:30.326, Speaker B: More ways to speculate. Like, I would be really cool to talk about, like, a BTC, like, native lending market. Like, that would be cool because I think that's, like, bitcoin.
00:57:30.510 - 00:57:31.954, Speaker A: Another way to speculate.
00:57:34.774 - 00:57:46.794, Speaker B: Different. It's different because bitcoin is like actually competing for, like, money. Right? Like, your shit coins that can't get listed on Aave are not competing for money. You're competing for, like, getting rid of the. On them.
00:57:48.814 - 00:57:50.334, Speaker A: WBTC make, like.
00:57:50.414 - 00:58:06.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. I'm not saying that can't get listed on a bay, like, you know, on these more like rarity type lending markets, but, like, bitcoin is like actually competing for global money. So, like, you probably need a lending market on that. That's what I'm working on.
00:58:06.786 - 00:58:25.756, Speaker A: I don't know, I think you need. You have censorship resistant assets, you need sensory position financial system, and it needs to be more and more efficient to be able to compete with the traditional financial system. And like, once you've onboarded rwas and stuff, and you have things that people want to trade on chain, which is slowly happening, suddenly you have a whole sensor persistent financial system built on top.
00:58:25.780 - 00:58:33.980, Speaker B: Of it where you can, like, I feel like any, anytime there's like rwas, it's like they're gonna be like, the RWA issue is gonna be involved in.
00:58:34.012 - 00:58:41.064, Speaker C: That, like borrow, lend, can you have defi on bitcoin with ten minute block times?
00:58:42.324 - 00:58:45.124, Speaker D: You have to use like a roll up. So you have to go.
00:58:45.244 - 00:58:47.592, Speaker A: Everything that's happening is most side chains.
00:58:47.788 - 00:58:52.104, Speaker C: Yeah. Which at that point is like, might as well be or Solana or whatever.
00:58:52.184 - 00:59:00.232, Speaker B: Well, I guess the thing is like having actual native, like, settlement on the bitcoin. It's like not just like trusting bitcoin.
00:59:00.248 - 00:59:02.184, Speaker D: If you get a real roll up. Yeah.
00:59:02.224 - 00:59:06.560, Speaker A: But they're going to be slow as fuck you get. Or you're going to have to wait ten minutes between transactions.
00:59:06.632 - 00:59:08.832, Speaker B: That's okay. Doing, like.
00:59:08.968 - 00:59:14.884, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it's more on the liquidation front that you can't have ten minutes happen.
00:59:15.404 - 00:59:25.916, Speaker B: Well, yeah, over time, ten minutes is fine. Well, yeah, you don't let them lever up. Like, you just have it more of a tiered system. And, like, as things get less volatile.
00:59:26.060 - 00:59:30.436, Speaker C: I mean, you can have low leverage and still get liquidated on these.
00:59:30.540 - 00:59:44.390, Speaker B: No, by tier. Like, you. Like, you need to deposit more collateral by a certain time or something. Like, if you get to a lower, like, you can only take out a certain LTV, and then you have to deposit more as you go down.
00:59:44.462 - 00:59:56.034, Speaker D: I mean, some blocks take an hour, right? So it's not like it's always ten minutes. It's not a fixed time. I bought an ordinal once, and it took 45 minutes, so that's, like, my first experience.
00:59:56.734 - 01:00:00.314, Speaker A: You can't really get around that without someone else.
01:00:00.734 - 01:00:01.514, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:00:02.094 - 01:00:02.834, Speaker A: So.
01:00:06.254 - 01:00:09.076, Speaker D: Apparently sailor is doing some ordinals thing.
01:00:09.230 - 01:00:09.928, Speaker A: I know.
01:00:10.056 - 01:00:12.576, Speaker C: Id. Yeah, he's doing the id thing.
01:00:12.680 - 01:00:14.244, Speaker B: The digital bitcoin.
01:00:14.944 - 01:00:16.632, Speaker D: So the bitcoiners really hate him, though.
01:00:16.688 - 01:00:19.432, Speaker B: Big, if true. What do you mean? Who hates him?
01:00:19.528 - 01:00:28.064, Speaker D: No, because sailors. No laser eyes. Like, sailors. Like anti privacy. Anti. He's just, like, pure. Like, regulate the shit out of this thing.
01:00:28.064 - 01:00:33.776, Speaker D: Just make the number go up. So he's not really a real bitcoiner, like, from the ethos perspective.
01:00:33.840 - 01:00:34.104, Speaker B: Oh.
01:00:34.144 - 01:00:39.000, Speaker D: So I understand why people don't like them. Like, he's not really for the cause.
01:00:39.192 - 01:00:42.964, Speaker B: I think he is for the cause of hard money, which is important.
01:00:44.304 - 01:00:45.704, Speaker A: He says, regulate shit out.
01:00:45.744 - 01:00:46.496, Speaker C: What are the trust.
01:00:46.560 - 01:00:50.724, Speaker A: And make real big number go up. Yeah, sorry, say that again.
01:00:52.344 - 01:00:57.032, Speaker C: What is a real bitcoin? Or how would you define that?
01:00:57.208 - 01:01:04.552, Speaker A: You. You just stack sats, you eat red meat. You have. You have guns. You live out in a ranch yourself?
01:01:04.608 - 01:01:05.724, Speaker C: No, not like that.
01:01:07.294 - 01:01:11.834, Speaker D: I think. Well, I mean, like, appreciating privacy, like.
01:01:12.294 - 01:01:13.034, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:13.414 - 01:01:19.074, Speaker B: The privacy issue is tricky one. But, like, bitcoin wasn't built for, like, that in mind.
01:01:21.294 - 01:01:34.994, Speaker D: Right. It's actually kind of ironic that the ETF will be the most private way to own bitcoin now. You'll have more privacy. You will know. You'll have more privacy bitcoin than any other in the ETF than any other any other way.
01:01:35.644 - 01:01:37.300, Speaker B: Those samurai wallet people got arrested.
01:01:37.332 - 01:01:43.420, Speaker C: What do you mean, though? Because, I mean, really, your account is registered to your name, your Social Security number, or.
01:01:43.492 - 01:02:00.584, Speaker D: Yeah, yes. I mean, but you can't bitcoin is a public chain, so you can already not hide it from the government. And everybody else sees it, too. At least with the ETF, it's, like, commingled with the rest of the ETF. I mean, only if people don't.
01:02:01.234 - 01:02:11.734, Speaker C: But you don't know. Like, you could see the wallet has the asset, but you don't know who owns the wallet. Like, the government doesn't really know who owns the wallet, whereas ETF, like, they know how much you own in your brokerage account.
01:02:13.314 - 01:02:18.202, Speaker D: You're conflating, I think you're conflating the censorship resistance of it with the privacy of it.
01:02:18.218 - 01:02:27.014, Speaker C: I think you're, like, privacy from who? Right? Privacy from the government, privacy from on chain sleuths looking at your wallet but don't actually know whose name is associated with the wallet.
01:02:28.694 - 01:02:30.694, Speaker D: Yeah, and from, like, the chain analysis.
01:02:30.734 - 01:02:33.534, Speaker C: Of the world and all that, I'd rather have prior.
01:02:33.574 - 01:02:37.598, Speaker A: At worst, chain analysis ends up with the information that the government already has, though, right?
01:02:37.646 - 01:02:39.794, Speaker C: Like, yeah, exactly.
01:02:41.414 - 01:02:55.240, Speaker A: Anyway, I feel like we've. We should end this. This is a really good one, though. Thanks, everyone, for. For tuning in, and we'll see you in two weeks for the next episode of the Hive Mind. Bye.
01:02:55.352 - 01:02:56.504, Speaker B: Sweet. Bye.
