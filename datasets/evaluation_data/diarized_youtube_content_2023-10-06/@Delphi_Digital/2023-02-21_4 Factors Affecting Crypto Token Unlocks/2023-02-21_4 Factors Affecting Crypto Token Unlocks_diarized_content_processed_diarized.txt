00:00:00.320 - 00:00:31.352, Speaker A: There are four factors that affect token the size of the unlock, the liquidity, perpetual futures, and tokenomics. Number one, the size of the token unlock. If the amount of tokens getting unlocked are large compared to the circulating supply, there's going to be more sell pressure. Number two, liquidity. They do this by creating positive narratives just before an unlock to provide temporary demand to offset the impact of selling. Number three is perpetual futures. Perps are interesting because private investors can use them to hedge their locked tokens.
00:00:31.352 - 00:00:55.624, Speaker A: Secondary buyers can hedge their exposure before an unlock, and traders can short a token, hoping for a market dump after the unlock. Finally, we have number four, tokenomics. Generally, it refers to token distribution, the tokens utility, the amount of lock tokens, and the tokens emission schedule. So understanding what affects price action during token unlocks means you can do your own research to analyze projects and their unlocking schedules.
