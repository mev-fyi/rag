00:00:01.040 - 00:00:15.310, Speaker A: You're now plugged into the Delphi podcast. Hey, everyone. Welcome back to the podcast. Today I'm thrilled to have on David Johnston, who's an open source contributor to the Crypto AI project Morpheus. David, how's it going?
00:00:15.462 - 00:00:17.454, Speaker B: Hey, man, it's great to be here, David.
00:00:17.494 - 00:00:28.100, Speaker A: I saw a video of Eric Voorhees talking about crypto AI project Morpheus, and I got super interested, and I think that's how we initially met, right?
00:00:28.222 - 00:00:36.688, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it was at one of the decentralized AI events. It was pretty cool to see the whole community kind of come together and all the people that are working on it.
00:00:36.736 - 00:00:50.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you were working on this early on, right? I think. I mean, it's got to be many, many months ago, right, before all the crypto AI hype. I think I met you at one of the multicoin summits or something like that. And I was like, what's this guy working on? Or what's he contributing to?
00:00:50.552 - 00:01:34.698, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think it was probably early 2023. I had written the paper on smart agents, and this concept of connecting AI agents to smart contracts in your web3 wallet, and that sort of sparked a lot of early conversations about how we connect web3 with AI, and it must have sparked something with the original Morpheus. Authors reference my paper in their paper about Morpheus, which came out in September of last year. And I was like, yeah, this is the next logical step, is go from these local AI's to having a whole network that supports smart agents. So, yeah, it's been wild how fast all this has developed.
00:01:34.786 - 00:01:54.528, Speaker A: So, before we get into it, I mean, one of the things that I thought was just wild was just the reception out of the gate. I mean, I think Morpheus attracted something like 120 or 130,000 staked ETH, which is, I think, three or $400 million, depending on your Eth price, within two weeks, which is sort of wild.
00:01:54.656 - 00:02:20.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Especially considering there's no Morpheus company. There's no foundation. There was no hype. There was no pr. Like, it was entirely word of mouth in the community, because there's no formal team. It's just a bunch of open source contributors that got together and said, yeah, we have to build decentralized AI and started making the smart contracts and donating the audit time, building out sort of all of the pieces of the infrastructure.
00:02:20.202 - 00:02:59.814, Speaker B: So, yeah, to see, like, out of nowhere, you know, 100,000 stake de come in in just a week or two was really cool validation that one people holding ETH want to support new open source projects and especially that are using this fair launch type of model, right, where there is no pre mine. It's entirely transparent. The project's been built totally in public since the white paper dropped. And I think that's refreshing. I mean, that's sort of what got me excited about it is it really feels like that 2012 2013 kind of early crypto energy that I remember from those bitcoin and early Ethereum days.
00:03:00.594 - 00:03:22.004, Speaker A: It definitely has that cypherpunk ethos to it, right? Yeah, it feels like it's grassroots. It feels like it's community oriented. It feels good. Before we get into the fair launch stuff, um, because I want to get into that because it's new and innovative. Let's just do quick elevator pitch on Morpheus for those who have been, you know, on vacation, right? What does Morpheus do? What's the end goal?
00:03:22.424 - 00:04:46.792, Speaker B: You know, I think the community really believes in building a free future, right? And if you believe in a free future, what you need for that is a personal AI, right? Not an AI controlled by a company or some government, but, like, literally your personal AI, that is an extension of your data, your wallet, your transactions, and that's acting on your behalf with your best interests at heart, right? And so I think that's just such a fundamental idea is for the same reason you want a personal phone, for the same reason you want a personal computer, right? You're gonna want a personal AI, and you really couldn't do that until the open source models sort of caught up and which they really have the last 612 months, especially now with llama three. It's right there at the same quality as, like, a chat GPT four. Right, which is the gold standard for AI chat models right now. And so the idea that now you can run this on your own hardware or that you can run it in a peer to peer network is incredible, right? It opens up the opportunity to build agents and applications and dapps all connected to AI in a way that you can just talk to it. You need no technical background whatsoever. You can just show up, say what you're trying to achieve, express your intent. Hey, I want to stake my eth.
00:04:46.792 - 00:05:02.864, Speaker B: Great. You've never heard of Lido? You don't know how smart contracts work. No problem. The AI understands how to do that. It can map that intent, create that transaction, and you, as the user, ultimately approve it. Yes, that's the person I want to send it to. Yes, that's the amount I intend to send.
00:05:02.864 - 00:06:09.760, Speaker B: You're ultimately providing the preferences and the wisdom and the system as human. But we can abstract away all this complexity of web3. And I think this is how we actually get a billion users to use crypto, is you take away all of the hard parts and just boil it down to what they want to do and achieving that with a click and move buttons. So, yeah, that's the core heart of Morpheus, is like, how do you give everybody on the planet a personal AI that's built on open source, that they can connect to web3 and get all these capabilities? So I think that's sort of been the start of it. And then I was like, okay, this is a lot of stuff, right? This is a big project, and Morpheus is just providing sort of the rails, right? It's providing the platform. Then you need other people like Akash to build decentralized compute networks and 6079 to do proof of inference. And Eric Voorhees has said he's building a permissionless chat GPT that he's going to announce soon, and it'll be a censorship resistant text model for the masses.
00:06:09.760 - 00:06:46.206, Speaker B: All of these components of decentralized AI, they need incentives, they need the infrastructure to connect them together. And that's sort of what Morpheus is positioned as is being that neutral platform that's open to everybody. It's not owned by a company, it's not controlled by any one protocol. It's just this agnostic platform anybody can use. And I think that's the key, is there's no pre mind, there's no preference. This is owned by the community of all these people that want to build decentralized AI. Yeah, that's sort of the quick tldr.
00:06:46.390 - 00:07:14.438, Speaker A: No, I mean, it's a fantastic Tldr. Right. So just to give it back to you and let me know if I'm following correctly here. So the end goal is everybody's supposed to have their own personalized AI. They want their data to be private. They want an AI that's personalized and trained on their data, that's in their voice, in their tone, things like that. And then when they want to go out to the world to perform actions, whether it be in DeFi or their own private life, ordering an uber rebalancing liquidity pool, what have you.
00:07:14.438 - 00:07:25.074, Speaker A: Ordering a GPU from Akash. Right. Great project. They can do that through the network. And Morpheus is sort of the coordination network between the personalized AI's and this global network of services.
00:07:25.494 - 00:08:02.906, Speaker B: Exactly. You can think of Morpheus as a delegator or coordinator agent, but then you're going to have hundreds of specific smart agents. Like you're saying that, do that one thing and it could say, oh, here's what you're trying to accomplish, and point it at that specific agent that's going to accomplish that. You can think of it like a marketplace, like an app store. You're going to end up with people publishing and deploying a morpheus. Hundreds of different smart agents, and then they're all easy to discover, they're all easy to connect to because there's this decentralized registry for smart agents. There's a decentralized network for the compute.
00:08:02.906 - 00:08:40.926, Speaker B: You have all these pieces you need in order to really have an open source personal AI that's not even just limited to the hardware you have, because you might not have a GPU, but you want to make an image or a video. Great. That's what Akash exists for. Bittenster is training advanced models, but they're all providing the supply side. They're creating the computer, the things that you need for decentralized AI. Morpheus is on the demand side. The smart agents are using the models and the compute that are being provided by these other networks.
00:08:40.926 - 00:09:10.708, Speaker B: If you're a fan of Bittenster or Akash, you should love Morpheus. It's going to consume all of the supply that those networks are creating. It's the opposite side of the network. It's demanding those services and resources. You need both sides. The simplest way is for smart contracts to exist. You needed Ethereum as a platform, and Ethereum didn't write the smart contracts.
00:09:10.708 - 00:09:28.384, Speaker B: It just gave you the EVM and the consensus mechanism and did execution and all the rest. That's where Morpheus is sitting. It's not going to build the smart agents. It's just giving all those crypto primitives and the chat aspect and the compute everything you need to deploy a smart agent.
00:09:29.744 - 00:10:00.504, Speaker A: So, David, it sounds not scary, but ambitious. How many potential services can be on the network, how they're chosen for a user, how do you wrap your head around the complexity? Let's say that Morpheus is successful. It uses an incentive mechanism to draw in all these different providers to provide services for users. How do the users visualize this? How do they surface the needs that they want? How is all this handled end to end?
00:10:00.924 - 00:10:45.634, Speaker B: Well, I mean, that's sort of the magic of what LLMs are really good at, is understanding normal human language and detecting intent. Right. If you asked right now for llama three to write you an article, which I did just a couple of minutes ago, it spit out an incredibly accurate write up, and I didn't even have to give it that much context. The LLMs, they're already there. That's the magic sauce. That was the missing ingredient for building something like this two, three years ago. You just didn't have the tool to go from human language text input to really accurate outputs, trying to guess what they're trying to achieve.
00:10:45.634 - 00:11:28.334, Speaker B: Once you have that building block, a lot of the other stuff's already there. Web three has already spent 15 years building the payment rails and the wallets and the APIs and the compute networks and the peer to peer infrastructure. So you're not building a lot of new pieces. Take for example the decentralized router that's getting built MorpHEus right now, and this is Ryan Condron at Lumeran, had already built a decentralized system for hash power routing. And he's like, oh, I can point this at inference. And we could be using this for AI models in a couple of months. It's literally the same contracts on arbitrum just now.
00:11:28.334 - 00:12:21.566, Speaker B: You have AI model providers instead of SHA 256 hash providers. But almost all the other infrastructure is the same for how you match the compute with the person that needs it, how you manage reputation, how you pay the compute provider. Like this has all been built the last four or five years in the web3 context. And so a lot of this has been just saying to the AI world, hey, we saw all those regulations that are getting proposed. Like, we've been through this, we know what that's like. And here's the solutions, right? You have to go peer to peer. You might have to train models overseas, you might have to be jurisdiction agnostic and build these as protocols that don't have any custody over user information or user money, but are user run applications.
00:12:21.566 - 00:12:57.786, Speaker B: And changing that perspective has been the big thing as the communities have come together. It's like showing the AI community all the tools that web3 has built the last 15 years and how they can apply to them. I don't, I don't think it's actually that far out. The Morpheus local version has been live since last October. You can download right now a full large language model on your laptop and the 6th version of Morpheus, you can connect it to your metamask. You can send Ethereum with it. Hey, I want to send 0.1
00:12:57.786 - 00:13:37.134, Speaker B: ETH to Bob and it's going to ask you questions and check it's got the address correct and all that kind of stuff. So. And those are just like sort of really basic examples, but that's where it is right now, right before sort of all the development is going to come the next six months. So, you know, I think it is an ambitious project and it has really wide sort of impacts. But, like, the tech is there. Like, you couldn't have built this three years ago, you know, and they may close the door on this type of development in a year or two because, you know, they don't like sort of the us plebeians having all this access to information and, you know, free exchange and the rest. But, like, you can build it right now.
00:13:37.134 - 00:13:59.382, Speaker B: And I think that's part of what the urgency that's developed in the community is. Like, there's this feeling that, like, this, the moment in history where right now we can build this. And we really want the version of the future where you have a personal AI, not one owned by Microsoft, not one owned by a big government, right? But you have your own personal AI. Like, that's the future.
00:13:59.438 - 00:14:43.858, Speaker A: I want, David, just to linger on this for a bit, because I know that you and I have talked about this, and we've seen really smart people talk about this as well. But a lot of the time we spend discussing crypto AI, we talk about model selection, ranking models. And if I fine tune a model, and if you do and they compete, that could be a better bridge for crypto assets. It could be a better trading experience, whatever it is, right? When these two models go head to head, if I'm an end user and I'm on my personalized AI, and I want to trade a defi asset, and there's two killer defi models. How does the Morpheus network decide which one to use? Is it reputation? Is it accuracy? Is it user choice? How is that decided?
00:14:44.026 - 00:15:13.544, Speaker B: Well, let's peel back a little bit. The word model. Most of the foundational models, let's say llama three, or Neus, Hermes, or mistral, people have probably heard these different names. Most of them are kind of like the general layer. It understands the intent. It sort of has a broad knowledge about the world. But on top of the model, when we talk about a smart agent, this is really the prompts, what APIs it's connected to.
00:15:13.544 - 00:15:51.212, Speaker B: It's probably much more narrow and specific to a certain task or application you're trying to do. Just like you have an operating system on your iPhone, but it doesn't do anything beyond the basic system stuff. I have 100 different apps installed to do specific tasks. Think about that same framework coming here. The model is your operating system. It does the general stuff, but you're going to end up with an app that does tons of very specific, narrow applications. The beautiful thing here, though, is you don't even need the app store experience.
00:15:51.212 - 00:16:42.462, Speaker B: I mean, people are going to throw out marketplaces and they'll put up nice logos and you could see all of the cool smart agents that people are deploying. But to discover them, you're just going to interact with the Morpheus coordinator, the Morpheus delegator agent, and tell it what you want to do. And it has an algorithm, and I wrote a paper about this last year called smart contract rank. Right? And you're going to end up with a smart agent rank algorithm. And the algorithm is entirely transparent. Like, how many transactions has this contract had? That's a really good indicator, whether it's a real contract or some shady thing somebody published yesterday. Oh, it's the lido contract, and it has 50 million transactions and secures $20 billion.
00:16:42.462 - 00:17:25.080, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good indicator. The algorithm takes into account, is it built on Ethereum or some other decentralized system? Or is it Bob's personal server running on a private network? It gives a quantitative rank. Ten points for Ethereum, zero points for the centralized solution. Is it custodial? Is it non custodial? You can look at the algorithm, and there's a paper on GitHub, just look up for smart rank or smart contract rank, and you can see all the details. That's a database. Okay? Now, you basically did a survey of all the top smart contracts in the world, and you can do the same thing for the smart agents. And I did a survey.
00:17:25.080 - 00:17:46.840, Speaker B: You could do this every day. You could do this every week. And if somebody asks about this stakey Neath, it's going to give them these top three recommendations. Just like the Google pagerank algorithm used to be. Fairly neutral and trustworthy, especially back in the late TBT. Yeah, exactly. And it was like, oh, I want to find a sports website.
00:17:46.840 - 00:18:28.166, Speaker B: And it gave you the top five sports websites, and you didn't have to think through how to discover them. That's because it was looking at the number of links between the websites and the number of links that site was connected to. So it created this organic graph of the web. Now, Morpheus, thanks to smart rank, has an organic graph of all the smart contracts, and that just gets fed into the prompts and the embeddings to the model. And so when the model hears a keyword, oh, they're asking about Defi. Oh, they're asking about a Dex? Oh, they're asking about whatever. It's already got that ranking in its system and ultimately it's up to the person.
00:18:28.166 - 00:19:04.774, Speaker B: They don't have to use what it recommends, but its top recommendations are probably going to be the safest, most used, best thing that they could access. And that's a lot of what Google did. Is it protected you from the scams or phishing. They did a lot of work to basically filter out the crap Internet and give you the best quality ranks. I think that's a core thing to understand as Morpheus has got some intelligence embedded. But ultimately this will probably be based on people's preferences. Everything is biased.
00:19:04.774 - 00:19:19.674, Speaker B: Maybe you don't care about decentralization. No. Give me the fastest, lowest cost execution. That's fine. That's a preference you could set. But because it's open source and transparent, you can build systems to let people set those preferences.
00:19:20.214 - 00:19:35.980, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hearing you talk about it, it sounds like, I don't want to die on this hill, but it sounds like brands are becoming less important in this world. Like if you build a killer agent or killer model, like you don't need a brand, you don't need a name on it, you just need it uploaded to the network to be able to.
00:19:36.012 - 00:19:41.852, Speaker B: Execute if it works well, almost like a meritocratic system.
00:19:42.028 - 00:19:43.652, Speaker A: Like the early web, the ones we.
00:19:43.668 - 00:19:50.664, Speaker B: Always build the best. Yeah, you built the best website, not just the one that had the most advertising. Maybe that should be at the top of the ranks.
00:19:51.914 - 00:20:13.294, Speaker A: So, David, switching gears a bit, I want to talk so we have a good understanding of the network and its goals and its ambition. I want to talk a little bit about the new launch framework. This is something that I dont think has ever been tried before. So I want to talk to you about the fair launch. I want to talk to you about the token economics and what happened there. Maybe we could start with the fair launch.
00:20:13.994 - 00:20:46.154, Speaker B: This is one of the things that really attracted me when I first read the white paper, it was, oh, they're just using the yield, right? From the staking rewards on Ethereum. I don't have to risk my eth, I'm going to hold Eth anyway. And I can just take the yield and contribute it to a cool open source project. I want to exist. You're like, yeah, I'll do that. And I think that logic and that really simple decision tree, like, am I going to hold Ethan? Not even staking it anyway. Oh, cool.
00:20:46.154 - 00:21:22.980, Speaker B: I can point the staking rewards at this cool new project and get a new token. Yeah, that's like a no brainer. And I think that's part of why the fair launch has been so successful is that's a really easy decision tree for anybody in crypto that is long eth and wants to support decentralized AI. But yeah, you can generalize this model. And the community is calling this more 20 Mor 20 as a platform, as a token standard. You can think of it inspired, like ERC 20 became for Ethereum. This is for Morpheus, the button that you push when you want to launch your own fair launch.
00:21:22.980 - 00:22:06.000, Speaker B: You want to raise stake deep and do it in the Morpheus way, where there's no treasury, there's no foundation, there's no centralized company. All of that yield, what's happening to it? It's going into protocol owned liquidity. So its buying more tokens out of the uniswap pool every day, making them more scarce, creating demand to bootstrap the system. And it just ends up staying in there as protocol and liquidity as an LP in uniswap pool, that liquidity just keeps getting deeper. As long as people are providing capital, thats the cool thing. This isnt a 90 day thing. The bootstrapping period is just where people can start claiming their more tokens.
00:22:06.000 - 00:22:32.540, Speaker B: The token emissions go for 16 years, so there's a long term opportunity. It is still so early for people hearing about this now. It is still so early to take your eth and stake it in the contract. I think that really hit a chord. And so a ton of projects have jumped in the community and it's like, we want to do a fair launch. These are the ethics, this is the values that we stand for. We want to do something like that.
00:22:32.540 - 00:22:46.864, Speaker B: And so. Great. Well, Morpheus is all open source, so here are the smart contracts. Here are the dashboards. Yeah, it's been audited now seven times. I think the latest one was done by open Zeppelin. So great security firms.
00:22:46.864 - 00:23:18.132, Speaker B: And so, yeah, that's the contract I wanted to use. The one that's been battle hardened by hundreds of millions of dollars of assets and a ton of audits. Don't change anything about the contract. Just here's the weights I need. Here are the different groups, compute, code, whatever that I need to reward for my project. And I can take that template off the shelf and just launch a more 20 in a few days. Instead of spending six months in development and waiting around three months to find an auditor in a bull market who has time to audit my project.
00:23:18.132 - 00:23:49.098, Speaker B: Here's a template that sort of embodies all these values. And I think the cool thing for capital providers is I think of it as like almost like rug free or rug proof. Like, I still hold my principle. I can withdraw my eth whenever I want. Okay, I'm out the yield if the project didn't work out. But I never had my principal sitting with somebody else. There's no custodian, there's no counterparty.
00:23:49.098 - 00:24:15.930, Speaker B: It's just sitting in the contract, sending that stake Deeth reward every day to the protocol on liquidity. In a world of, like, there's so much complexity, everybody's rolling their own smart contracts. There's a million different models. I just want to do the one where I can't lose my eth. Right. And so for people in that bucket, it's like, yeah, give me more projects like that. So I think they're going to see a ton of announcements around more 20.
00:24:15.930 - 00:24:52.674, Speaker B: It looks probably, probably in the next two to three weeks, just after the token goes live, people adopting this model, making announcements about doing fair launches. I can't wait for that. It's almost like a rebirth of, there was so many cool ideas, people funded with icos, but the model just drug you back into a centralized foundation or company. You had to trust a group with that money, and they're going to totally make a token at some point in the future. No, you can cut all of that out. You can cut out all those middlemen and centralized points of failure and just have an entirely clean, fair launch model on smart contracts.
00:24:53.534 - 00:25:34.058, Speaker A: David, just to recap the mechanism a bit for you real quick, or just correct me if I'm wrong here, basically, the way it works is users deposit their stake deeds, Lido staked ETH into a contract, and they're foregoing the yield. The yield is now going to the Morpheus contract. So they maintain their principle, they give up the yield, and they earn a pro rata share of the more tokens that come from the capital bucket, which is a quarter of the tokens, or 24% of the tokens, I think, over 16 years. So over that 16 year period, you get your pro rata portion of that issuance based on the yield you're providing.
00:25:34.226 - 00:25:43.394, Speaker B: Yep. Correct. Calculated every block. And so when you stop staking, you still got all the rewards you've already earned, but you don't earn additional rewards.
00:25:44.174 - 00:26:24.174, Speaker A: Got it. That's okay. So, taking this a step further, there's four token buckets in Morpheus, right? There's the capital bucket, which we're talking about right now. But there's also a code bucket. There's also a community bucket, a capital bucket, a small protection bucket. I don't want to overly spend time on maybe each bucket, but maybe one of my more direct questions for you is that I feel like the code and compute buckets are really important, right, because they're key value providers for your network, right? They're creating agents, they're providing resources, things like that. How do those people or those projects get rewarded? Like, how does their incentive mechanism get back to them?
00:26:24.994 - 00:26:39.762, Speaker B: So you think about the builders in the community that are making the smart agents, and that's called the community bucket. Not to be confused with, like, influencers or stuff, but, like, actual the builder community, the people making the smart.
00:26:39.818 - 00:26:41.334, Speaker A: I was a little confused by that.
00:26:42.034 - 00:27:20.910, Speaker B: So they've got 24% of all the emissions, right? And when I say code, code is in reference to, like, the reference implementations of Morpheus. And there are ten different pieces of that. Like, there's the smart contracts and the smart agents and the node software and the interoperability. And you can go through the whole list on GitHub, ten pieces of the reference implementation that make up, like, the entire Morpheus platform. So that's the code bucket that gets 24%. So you can think about people building the platform, 24%. People building on the platform, the smart agent builders, as 24%.
00:27:20.910 - 00:27:59.414, Speaker B: You've got the compute, like you said, is 24%. And then the capital, which is 24%. And then the last one, everybody forgets. Yeah. Is the little protection fund bucket, which is 4% because it's 2424-2424 last 4% goes into protection fund, which I think is really smart, because there's always something, right? You can audit the thing ten times. There's always some risk in smart contracts. So building in a protection fund that holds more and can balance into ETH and can pay out bounties and more audits and recover in the case of attacks and stuff like that, I think is really smart.
00:27:59.414 - 00:28:29.074, Speaker B: Even bitcoin had two unintentional hard forks in 2010 and 2013. It was like Gavin Andreessen paying out of his own pocket to try to make the miners better. Whoops, sorry, you missed some blocks there. What's 10,000 bitcoin here? Or whatever it was. But God bless him for doing it. And sort of restored faith that there was somebody standing behind it was going to fix these problems. But why not build that into the protocol? Those are the five buckets.
00:28:29.074 - 00:28:58.984, Speaker B: But I think the balance is pretty good. It's like half proof of stake ish kind of stuff and half proof of work kind of related things. Like if you're building a platform or you're building on the platform you're doing, it's basically proof of work. It's development work. It's real time and energy of devs to build it out. But if you've just got capital, you don't have the development skills. Cool.
00:28:58.984 - 00:29:27.544, Speaker B: You can do capital or people with capital buy machines. A lot of people are, oh, I'm getting a GPU and I'm going to use my GPU. That's your proof of stake? Not in the traditional form, because there's no consensus mechanism here. This all exists on second layer from smart contracts. You don't need consensus rewards. But think about that as a framework. Rewarding people that are building, rewarding people that are providing the capital so they can build.
00:29:27.544 - 00:30:14.694, Speaker B: Right. It's a really cool combination because I think most protocols make the mistake of being really heavy proof of work or heavy proof of stake. Like we're only rewarding capital people and you have to have millions of dollars to run a node or we're only running rewarding proof of work and you got to have a ton of compute and the group. That's often forgotten. And I really haven't seen somebody go this heavy into community builders and core open source builders rewards since the days of Ethereum. To have almost half of all the rewards going to the people actually building it, that's how you get. I mean, there are 200 code contributors already on Morpheus and it's been a few weeks since launch.
00:30:14.694 - 00:30:34.934, Speaker B: That's crazy. Most teams are 510, 2030 people. You couldn't find and centralize 200 people all over the world building this different infrastructure in such a short amount of time. But if you just give them the incentive, they show up. The quality of the people has just been incredible.
00:30:35.944 - 00:30:59.484, Speaker A: So David, one thing I'd love to learn more about is how people earn money based on pings to the network, right? Like the compute budget and how that works. I might be dating myself to Eric's Yellowstone paper. I'm not sure if the community has changed things or not, but would love to get your take on how the agents and users are rewarded for providing to the network.
00:31:00.574 - 00:31:45.794, Speaker B: I think Eric's Yellowstone paper was pretty brilliant. It sort of changed up the old model of just have a block award and everybody's going to compete whether the resource is used or not and put it much more into like a free market type bidding system. Hey, I'm running this particular LLM model and I'll do it for this much money. And if you have the best bid in the system, when somebody makes a request, it gets matched. Now you have a session, and this is what Ryan Condron is building with the Morpheus Lumerin node is now you have a session. I can leave that session open for a day, a week, whatever. I'm going to send you a bunch of prompts, make a bunch of images, whatever.
00:31:45.794 - 00:32:36.030, Speaker B: Then when I end that session, all those records get published to the chain and that compute provider can claim those rewards. So that's an important difference is the compute provider is getting paid by the protocol, not by the user. The user just holds some Morpheus tokens and has a pro router right to the inference available in the network. Right. And the important thing is there you're not creating a transaction with every prompt or even with every interaction, which would be not scalable in a blockchain context, but instead you're batching them together by the hundreds or thousands into a session and the provider of the compute is just clocking away every second. How long did I provide that session? How long was that GPU available? And the user's up to them. They can cut it off whenever they want.
00:32:36.030 - 00:33:14.732, Speaker B: So obviously they're going to run it as long as they want and then cut it off. That's sort of their feedback into the system. Then they can go paid by the protocol rewards. So think about the 24% of emissions which started off as 3456 tokens a day into that compute bucket that's just been building up the 90 days during the bootstrapping period. Now there are 300,000 odd tokens sitting in the contract. So a lot of resources. And when it goes live and it's likely that the testnet will be in maybe and potentially in production in June.
00:33:14.732 - 00:33:49.814, Speaker B: And so anybody holding more will then be able to access this huge network of decentralized compute. And on the other side, the compute providers will be able to get paid directly from the rewards contract. So that just gives you a sense for it's paying out the reward based on real usage. It's actually connected. Yeah, it's programmatic and it scales because you could have a session open for a week and you've done one transaction on arbitrum for $0.50. Right. Instead of trying to put that burden on it every time.
00:33:50.594 - 00:34:14.194, Speaker A: Got it. So just to give it back to you again, just to make sure I understand. So there's a daily amount of more tokens for this bucket, right? So daily amount and based on the request to the network, the agents models, whatever people want to call them. But they're called smart agents. In the paper, they earn a portion or pro rata amount of those tokens based on how much work they do.
00:34:14.974 - 00:35:00.784, Speaker B: So just to separate compute providers from people building smart agents. The current proposal for awarding smart agents is actually to use the more token holders as the people that provide the signaling of who to reward. So think about this like I'm holding more. I'm in a good position to say the next thing I would love to see built or bootstrapped or supported on Morpheus. And so I'm going to stake my more and point the yield from that protocol yield towards that project. It's almost like recreating the Ethereum model with the staked eth in the more context. So now you have a yield, a native yield on more.
00:35:00.784 - 00:35:41.272, Speaker B: It's that 24% bucket that goes to all of the community builders. How do you direct it? Not a dao, not a vote, not a committee, not a bureaucracy. Every individual can say, this is the project I want to support, and it's going to get its rewards pro rata based on how many people are supporting it. So I think that's a really interesting way to do that. And it's hard to game because you could look a lot. Oh, we're going to do on chain metrics, almost all of them. Okay, somebody's going to flood the network with a million transactions, but there's an economic cost to holding more, and it's something you can't fake.
00:35:41.272 - 00:35:47.084, Speaker B: It's a really high signal. Like, no, this is what I want to support and this is what I think should be rewarded.
00:35:47.744 - 00:35:48.648, Speaker A: That's really cool.
00:35:48.696 - 00:35:48.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:48.880 - 00:36:16.466, Speaker A: I mean, if you're a young developer and you want to build something, you just have to convince people to sort of delegate to you and you could earn and start building faster. And David, just to clarify, for my own knowledge, so directing your more rewards to help bootstrap projects being built on Morpheus. I know I'm messing the language up a little bit. That's different from projects on Morpheus. Earning though, by handling requests and inference. Right. That is part of they're just earning tokens of the daily amount.
00:36:16.610 - 00:36:41.784, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the compute bucket versus people that are in the community builder bucket and are creating the smart agents, the applications that people are using. Just think about them as apps, and then somebody is powering the compute for those apps. Then somebody's providing the capital to fund the whole system and somebody else is writing the code that makes it all work together, those are the four big components.
00:36:42.804 - 00:37:12.260, Speaker A: It's pretty cool how I think the bull case I would make, or the positive take I would give is that I think it's really cool how Cypherpunk Morpheus is along the fair launch and leaning into the community on pretty much every aspect. It seems like a lot of the crypto ad networks too, are moving in a more programmatic function like Morpheus with this bit tensor with dynamic Tao. It seems like we're trying to get away from human or some human decision making before we even go live.
00:37:12.452 - 00:38:02.794, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to give you one more thing that blew my mind was, I don't know if you've heard of these yet, but, you know, nfts, non fungible tokens in the Morpheus context, it's non fungible agents. You can use that same infrastructure and it just happens to be MRC 21. Right. You know, a nice tip of the hat to ERC 721 for non fungible tokens is how do you reward every single project that publishes something amorphous? You just create it as an MRC 21. Now you've got a non fungible agent with an address attached, and the developer can parse out the rewards however they want to themselves, to the community, whatever. And it becomes this easy to use infrastructure.
00:38:02.794 - 00:38:44.744, Speaker B: Like some networks, you have to apply to be whitelisted or joined. Here you can just issue, effectively your own token for any agent you build and get rewarded in proportion to the people that are using and pointing rewards to it. And so now you have an entire ecosystem of people that can natively bootstrap with Morpheus. And that's what people did in the early days of Ethereum. Like, what did I do with the ETH? I wanted to support more cool projects building on Ethereum. What are most people likely to do with it? Well, I'm going to stake mine, point it at the next cool project that I would love to see built in the ecosystem. We can skip the whole ico phase.
00:38:44.744 - 00:39:21.344, Speaker B: You don't have to reinsert a company. It doesn't have to recentralize. You can just give developers these tools. Like you were saying earlier, this is the dream for developers. That's why they love the app store and the play store is it just handled payments and discoverability and they could just ship their code. Somebody else handled the infrastructure. They don't have to run any servers like the whole thing, except for you pay the 30% apple tax, except for you need permission from Apple to do the thing which a lot of times is fine, but, oh, not if you're doing crypto, not if you're doing anything with tokens, not if you're doing web3.
00:39:21.344 - 00:39:53.784, Speaker B: All of a sudden you can't get permission, right? So to have a permissionless marketplace where people can launch anything they want, that's MRC 2021 and non fungible agents, I think, is just going to be incredible because you're just unleashing the horde of developers that have been pent up, that want to build this stuff and couldn't get permission, or they're in the wrong country or whatever, or the 30% killed their economics or whatever it was. It kind of opens that up to all these open source projects, gives them an entirely new model.
00:39:54.324 - 00:40:23.026, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's cool. My thesis has always been just largest service area for creativity wins, right? Ethereum with merchandise, apps, Eigen layer. We'll see with avss, Morpheus, potentially with being able to allocate to builders to lower the barriers for them to create agents. It's definitely a cool, dynamic. Two last questions for you, David. I'm keeping these podcasts a little shorter because people's attention spans are cratering as we get older.
00:40:23.026 - 00:40:30.924, Speaker A: But the phases of Morpheus, I think, would be interesting to talk through, like real, you know, what are the phases and where do you think it's headed?
00:40:31.224 - 00:41:13.334, Speaker B: Sure. So this is an easy way to think of it, is it really mirrors the phases of Ethereum, and the communities called them the same thing, which is Genesis, right from when the white paper happened to the fair launch started. That was the Morpheus Genesis period. Now we're in the frontier period where the fair launch has started, and code and capital, people can earn rewards. But as soon as we get into compute earning rewards, that becomes homestead. Now you're adding a whole new community of people to Morpheus, everybody with GPU and the planet that wants to participate. Then you get to after Homestead, it's metropolis.
00:41:13.334 - 00:42:05.954, Speaker B: The actual builders can show up and they've got the compute, the code, and the capital they need to run. Now you get into smart agent developers deploying stuff on chain, and the registry goes live, and they can start earning their rewards via that more staking mechanism that we talked about. Then finally, fifth phase is serenity, is you see all of this infrastructure start to spread across all the different chains, all the different yield types, because Morpheus is agnostic, it should be on Solana, it should be on Cosmos, it should be on all. All of these. I should be able to hold bitcoin or anything else I want and be able to contribute that yield. Thanks to platforms like Thor chain, there's now actually a way to do that, all that type of integrations. There's a ton of cool proposals in the Morpheus request for comment section of the GitHub about how to add all those different chains.
00:42:05.954 - 00:42:31.954, Speaker B: And the developers have already baked in both layer zero and wormhole. You've got multiple interoperability messaging layer options to go into Ethereum, second layers to go into Solana to go into everything. So that's inevitably sort of where this is going to go is let's get MOrPHEUS everywhere, let's get the agents everywhere, let's get the tokens everywhere. Let's bring in yield from any part of any community that wants to adopt this model.
00:42:32.974 - 00:42:52.474, Speaker A: David, thinking through your journey with Morpheus, seeing the community, seeing its future, if you had to put on your, your critical hat in a way to improve the network and the community, is there anything that you would say that you want to see improved upon, anything like that?
00:42:53.534 - 00:43:34.684, Speaker B: It's a good question. I think the key is to make it easy for everyone to use. And there's still a technical barrier as far as participating. And a lot of people are like, oh, I don't know how to code, or I don't have a ton of money. And so reducing those barriers when compute comes online, a lot of people have hardware, even if they don't have a ton of money or coding skills, and there's millions of people with GPU's. So I think that'll be a huge improvement. Making it easy for developers, and I mean really easy to deploy smart agents without a lot of backend knowledge.
00:43:34.684 - 00:44:10.026, Speaker B: Just they can create a front end application, something very simple just to get started, like removing those barriers and making it friendlier and friendlier to less technical people, I think is sort of a big key. But a lot of this will come out of the community. The average user probably is never going to download a full morpheus node. I hope they do. I'm running one. But I know the reality that in the entire world there are 20,000 people running a bitcoin full node or an ethereum full node, and that's okay. The hobbyists, the passionate people, they're always going to do that.
00:44:10.026 - 00:44:52.424, Speaker B: But for most people, they'll just show up on a website like the one Eric's building, and they'll use it, and it's got fast free inference for chatter images, and that's all they need to know or understand. Oh, if I own one of these morpheus tokens, I get the free pro account. Great, I'm going to go do that. They don't have to understand all the technical nuance. So I'm sort of looking forward to this being a mass market thing, not just for the hardcore backend people, but easy user interface. And that's what I'm so glad that the Morpheus token economics reward people that are building the end user applications. It feels like that's where a lot of times crypto stops.
00:44:52.424 - 00:45:25.592, Speaker B: Great protocols, infrastructure backend, and nobody wants to build the website. There's no reward for the actual app. And it's like, no, you have to reward the app builders. And so I'm so glad that that's like the full stack approach in the Morpheus community. No, everybody needs to get rewarded, including the guy building the app. He's just as important as the guy building the peer to peer network because that's the one serving 99% of the users at the end of the day is the app. And if you don't reward the app builders, what happens? It gets sucked into some company.
00:45:25.592 - 00:45:39.488, Speaker B: Some company hires the app builder, pays them an hourly wage, and happily accepts all the rewards for the stuff on the backend. So I think that's the biggest part that needs to improve and I think will rapidly.
00:45:39.616 - 00:46:00.862, Speaker A: I'm glad you mentioned the LLM because it's a good example of something that should be built on crypto AI. I don't know if people are aware of how long that list of rules and regulations it is when you enter a prompt on Gemini or chat GPT is before it processes your request. I mean, it's only going to get longer and it's only going to get filter your question more and be more biased.
00:46:00.998 - 00:46:20.730, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah, it's crazy. A friend tried to ask about the lyrics for a Christmas song to tell his kid and it refused on ethical grounds to give him the lyrics. This song is like, what is going on? Like, I could go to a library, I could go to a search engine. I can't. I can't ask you about a Christmas card. No, no, no.
00:46:20.730 - 00:46:24.734, Speaker B: It's like, you know that there's strict ethical considerations.
00:46:26.554 - 00:46:38.684, Speaker A: I used to use like the GPT just to compare like allergy medicines and things like that. And now it, like, if you put it in meta AI, like, it'll give you your response, then quickly say, I can't give you advice for that. It's horrible.
00:46:38.834 - 00:47:07.610, Speaker B: Yeah, they're just censoring the hell out of them. It's going to get a lot worse. I mean, maybe you saw the homeland security, as part of the executive order, has assembled a crack team of experts for their committee on safety. Who's going to issue the licenses? Yeah, it's Microsoft and the usual players. Not a single open source player. No Elon, not even Zuckerberg. You're not welcome.
00:47:07.610 - 00:47:43.480, Speaker B: None of those guys made the list. For whatever reason, the governor of Maryland's there and the mayor of Seattle and the head of Microsoft, but nobody to do anything with open source. And so it's like you're not welcome. Like if anybody hasn't gotten the message or the memo and is building a centralized USAI company, you're not welcome. If you're not in the $100 billion club, you're not going to get that license from Homeland Security. Don't forget they're going to start licensing the models. You can't release it without a safety committee to prove the model could never do anything bad.
00:47:43.480 - 00:48:20.064, Speaker B: They're non deterministic models. You can't predict perfectly what it's going to say, but it's not how the technology works. All this stuff is just going to make it more and more croft for centralized companies trying to do this. This is why the decentralized AI stuff is just going to blow it out of the water, because there's going to be no restrictions on talking about tokens or giving you real advice about these things that people want to. They want advice on their medicine, they want advice on their finances. And if you just hobble these models and won't let them answer anything, it's just inevitably going to push everybody towards the decentralized model, which is fine with me.
00:48:20.564 - 00:48:46.134, Speaker A: No, I mean, I think that was a great, great summary. My thesis that I've always told people internally at Delphi was like, chat GPT five is obviously going to blow everything out of the water. Like short term, but mid to long term, they will always be stunted and kneecapped by the rules. Regulation, will culture, whatever the hell you want to call it, just stopping them from achieving their true potential. And obviously you just don't have the service area of creativity and incentives.
00:48:46.474 - 00:49:26.666, Speaker B: Well, let me draw another important distinction. Most of the existing models will have to stop within information. They won't be able to take action because they don't have identity, they don't have a payment rail, they don't have a wallet, they can't touch the tokens, they can't pay for anything. The only thing they can do is the old ad model. They're going to mine all of your data, just like they do today, and shove ads at you. They're literally going to auction off the tokens, the AI tokens. The response to you, like, the response you get from your Google search now is a page full of ads and not like real information.
00:49:26.666 - 00:49:36.490, Speaker B: Like, we can't have that be the result for 99% of intelligence on earth, right? We need a true and accurate. We need free AI. Right?
00:49:36.602 - 00:49:41.346, Speaker A: Free isn't free to do that. So, like, I want to buy a bike. I put that in my gemini LLM.
00:49:41.490 - 00:49:41.842, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:41.898 - 00:49:42.698, Speaker A: Like what?
00:49:42.866 - 00:50:06.378, Speaker B: Their advertisers will be bidding for the word, just like they do with adwords on Google. What else are they going to do? They don't have a payment rail, they can't do micropayments. They have no tokens, they don't have access to anything. Web three. Because they've been pushed out of that by regulation. That's inevitably what's going to happen. Those are the only two models available.
00:50:06.378 - 00:50:30.424, Speaker B: I don't make the rules. That's just how it works. With free AI, we can actually dream of a free future. Right? Like, I really think it's that important. Like this is that fundamental is like, I reject their worldview and I would like one that isn't as draconian and is open for everybody. Right? That's, that's what we need.
00:50:31.244 - 00:50:45.170, Speaker A: David, you crushed it. Open source contributor to Morpheus. As a disclosure, I'm in the Morpheus fair launch pool. Very excited for it. And David, this has been incredible. Really appreciate you coming on and this is a lot of fun.
00:50:45.322 - 00:50:46.434, Speaker B: Thanks, man. Great to be here.
