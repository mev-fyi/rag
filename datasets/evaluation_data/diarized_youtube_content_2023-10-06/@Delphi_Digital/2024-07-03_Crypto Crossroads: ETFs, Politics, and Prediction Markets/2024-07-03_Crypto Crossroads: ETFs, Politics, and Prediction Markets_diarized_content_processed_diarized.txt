00:00:05.320 - 00:00:42.960, Speaker A: Hi everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind. We're back this week after the lunatics took control of the asylum. Last week, we had Duncan on a caffeine binge going crazy with his ton bull posting. But yeah, it was a high energy podcast for sure. We're back this week talking about ETTF markets generally, prediction markets, and a bunch of other stuff. So, yeah, same cast as always. It's Duncan flood Capital, ceteris, head of research, and Jan, managing partner at Delphi Ventures, and myself.
00:00:42.960 - 00:01:27.176, Speaker A: So who wants to kick us off on the ETTF? I mean, I feel like we've kind of discussed, everyone's discussed this to death, but there's not that much that happened in the last week since our last pod. So I feel like maybe starting off there, obviously for some context. I guess Kang, who in general is not someone you want to fade, came out pretty bearish on the ETTF and crypto generally after being pretty bullish a few months before with his meme kind of super cycle thesis. There's a few other, I think, good traders that came up bearish, but there's also some smart minds on the other side. So maybe to start with, can go around the horn and see how everyone's feeling about ETH right here and markets generally leading up to the ETF.
00:01:27.288 - 00:02:31.102, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, ETH launch got delayed to what is currently set to be end of July launch. There's definitely mixed feelings about what the flows will look like. I think initially they will be pretty strong, just as, you know, people are converting their spot holdings into ETF holdings, similar to what happened on bitcoin. So you can expect some decent flows early on, but those aren't necessarily purchases, but rather just kind of conversions. And so it's not necessarily positive flow from a buying perspective, but just from ETF Aum perspective. One of the initial kind of bearish concerns around the timing of the ETF launch was that it was too soon relative to the BTC one, and so that didn't allow for enough time for BTC to grow and then the marketing engines to turn on for eTh. And it was also just, you wanted that catalyst pushed out further as something to look forward to, rather than one that then materializes a lot sooner.
00:02:31.102 - 00:03:35.696, Speaker B: So in that context, I think having it pushed back a bit, even though it's only a few weeks, roughly a month, is, I think, bullish overall because it does push the catalyst back. You do have a bit of a lull now between now and then where there isn't much happening and so I think that's part of what's pricing, that's part of what's being priced in. And then I think just there's been a gradual decline in kind of global liquidity. And that's probably one of the other big drivers of BTC decline. I, if you look throughout the year, we're all bullish on the space in the long run. And so if you think about what will be the future kind of catalyst you have, if you assume a high probability that Trump wins, that'll certainly be bullish. I think he's speaking at that bitcoin conference along with Vivek and a few others, end of July.
00:03:35.696 - 00:04:05.910, Speaker B: So I think that that's probably a pretty decent catalyst where what could be brought up is that they want to hold that bitcoin on balance sheet. Right, rather than continue selling it. And so I think that that's not at all priced in and could be something that gets mentioned. So if you think about the setup leading into it, you have a lull from here until then. And then end of July, I think, has a few kind of really bullish setups. And so it's kind of just waiting until then.
00:04:06.030 - 00:04:24.038, Speaker C: Also, I saw people floating for SEC chair, the guy who's Robin Hood's chief legal officer. And so that's a pretty big, would be good. That'd be a nice little turntables right there. So, Duncan, we know, I think we.
00:04:24.054 - 00:04:29.928, Speaker A: Know where you stand on the, on the ETF. If you don't just go read his.
00:04:29.984 - 00:04:32.352, Speaker D: Tweets, I don't even get to say anything.
00:04:32.536 - 00:04:37.820, Speaker A: Just a little bit. All right. Go on, give us your. And then we can go to ceteris.
00:04:38.280 - 00:05:17.168, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think the delay was definitely like Bush. Just give the asset managers more time to, you know, maybe I don't even know if they're going to be doing education or just like organize some more flows, just give them more time to prepare for the launch. I think the big thing that everyone on Twitter has been kind of overlooking is they're talking about ETh as like, how it looks bearish right now just from like, a fundamentals point of view. And it might be, like, really hard to sell. But in reality, like, the asset A is very, like, reflexive. So as the price goes up, its fundamentals, like, get better with the price going up.
00:05:17.168 - 00:05:53.130, Speaker D: We've talked about that a bunch in the past, but so that's one thing. Like, it looks more attractive as its price is going up. And then the second thing is Blackrock. You know, I was like, shouting this on Twitter. But they are like, six months into their most successful product launch ever. They're making already revenue of 50 million a year off ibit, and they still have pretty small market share of, like, total bitcoin that they could capture in that vehicle. Like, realistically, crypto ETF's, if price keeps going up, are going to be like billion dollar a year.
00:05:53.130 - 00:06:00.530, Speaker D: Definitely, like multiple billions over a decade in terms of management fees and revenue. So I think they're going to be.
00:06:00.570 - 00:06:04.778, Speaker A: Like 20 billion a year, though, or something along those lines.
00:06:04.954 - 00:06:05.218, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:05.234 - 00:06:08.950, Speaker B: It's more brand, I'd say, than tangible revenue.
00:06:09.490 - 00:06:54.210, Speaker D: Oh, I think that this is a whole new asset class, right? Like that the ETF asset class era management fee game is, like, very competitive amongst these people. And it's really hard to differentiate. This is like a whole new pie that they could get a slice of. So to, like, make sure that the four, like their leader is there is massive. Not only that, like, ETH also has, like, more monetization potential, right? Like, BTC is like the flat fee of 60 bps or whatever. But you have, you know, on ETh, like a flat fee plus if you could take some off staking if that gets amended later. So that is, I think one of the big things where they can, like, almost, like Blackrock can, like, almost create Ethereum's narrative or vanak, right? Like, Blackrock has, like, their build fund, like, their money market on chain.
00:06:54.210 - 00:07:28.150, Speaker D: Like, you know, I think it has, like 500 million in it right now. Like, what happens if Larry thinks, does what he did for bitcoin and starts doing the rounds on Bloomberg being like, you know, everything's gonna be tokenized and tradable on Ethereum. Like that in itself. Like, creates interest in Ethereum. You get interest in these, like, RWA products, like, more money on chain and could, like, literally improve the fundamentals of Ethereum itself. And he's just like, you know, selling his own product and like, this RWA product, you know, Vanek publisher piece talking about a theorem is like the open app store. Like, the app store takes 30%.
00:07:28.150 - 00:07:59.456, Speaker D: So, like a theorems, like, you know, deploy these apps and it takes like a smaller take rate. Like, any of these things. Also stable coins. Like, vanek, the head of Vaneck's son, is making a stable coin agora, where they're going to compete with circle. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if Blackrock made a stable coin. Like, that's enough. Like, stable coins in itself are like, right now it's like $150 billion market I think that they could probably get up to like a trillion, maybe a few trillion, because it just makes so much sense for all these people who don't have dollars in other countries in the world.
00:07:59.456 - 00:08:39.288, Speaker D: So, like, any of these angles, they could really take and push alongside marketing for the ETF to like, capture those fees and like, new products they launch, like their stablecoin or their RWA product. And I think it could completely flip the narrative for Ethereum. So people, bearish as it is right now, I think, are kind of missing, like, the reflexive nature of Ethereum. Like, if they get that flywheel going, things could get crazy again. Also, like, we basically retraced the entire announcement pump. Like, we pumped 30% on the fact that the Ethereum ETF Washington was going to be passed sooner than expected. And, you know, we're down like 27% from the.
00:08:39.464 - 00:08:44.592, Speaker B: I think that the market's really pricing in a dud of a launch at the moment. That's it. Yeah.
00:08:44.656 - 00:09:01.424, Speaker A: Although, like, the ETH pairs are all up since then, right? As kind of cetera pointed out last week, like, most of the ETH pairs are up. So ETH has outperformed since the ETF announcement. But I agree. Let's go. Maybe ceteris last. I think you have a slightly bearish take.
00:09:01.552 - 00:09:10.776, Speaker C: Well, I just, like, don't. I have no. I have no idea what the demand for this will be. Like. I don't know how I'm supposed to.
00:09:10.808 - 00:09:28.094, Speaker A: I have no idea either. I agree that it feels like it's. It's, it's the market's pricing in pretty crappy demand, right? Like, I think most people are saying we didn't have enough time to market it, which is probably true, that. That people won't understand ETh. Like, bitcoin's digital gold. It's easy to understand. I don't know.
00:09:28.094 - 00:09:47.470, Speaker A: I also think there's this thing where, like, not that many people care about gold in the scheme of things. Like, gold is 10 trillion, maybe ten to 20% of that is like, industrial uses, but not that many people care about gold or are into this, like, fiat, the basement sort of narrative.
00:09:47.550 - 00:09:52.526, Speaker C: I feel like, yeah, but that's not just, that's not bitcoin's only narrative now anyways. It's becoming a da layer too.
00:09:52.598 - 00:09:54.944, Speaker A: So it's like, yeah, but no one's wrong.
00:09:55.032 - 00:09:56.580, Speaker D: No, they're not selling.
00:09:58.120 - 00:09:59.584, Speaker B: Pension funds are buying.
00:09:59.712 - 00:10:06.740, Speaker C: You guys gotta look at it. Blackrock is selling da coin. Da. This is the most expensive Da you can buy.
00:10:07.240 - 00:10:10.208, Speaker B: The basement narrative is only gonna gain momentum, though.
00:10:10.384 - 00:10:23.732, Speaker A: I agree. But, but I also think that narrative for, like, the narrative for ETH is in a way, like bigger and also in a way easier to understand. I feel like, like, yeah, like crypto, Twitter's pretty funny form, like tech platform thing.
00:10:23.856 - 00:10:33.156, Speaker C: Yeah, but the tech, but digital key. Okay, but here's the thing. Digital gold is true. And it's like, it's the one. It is. Bitcoin is the one. Digital gold.
00:10:33.156 - 00:10:38.332, Speaker C: You say tech platform, it's like, hey, there's a lot of different tokens you can buy to like express the player.
00:10:38.396 - 00:10:40.228, Speaker D: You don't know they're going to just be.
00:10:40.364 - 00:11:00.180, Speaker C: Why does everybody think that, like, all these institutional investors are like 50 IQ? I mean, I think you're going to put some, you're going to do some research into this. They're going to look at like declining revenue for like a theory over the last few years. They're going to see other ecosystems going.
00:11:02.360 - 00:11:09.672, Speaker A: To, that are built on top of a theory and they're choosing Ethereum, almost rwas are issued on the, I think.
00:11:09.696 - 00:11:43.174, Speaker B: The weak fundamentals, you can also say, have the potential to reverse in a regime that's more startups building on Ethereum and crypto. Right. And, and so that, that's something that will only get stronger leading into year end. Then you get, the question is like, will crypto come up in a, in a, in the debate? Right? Like they kind of go through topics gradually with the most pertinent ones first, and then they kind of, they don't necessarily repeat everything at each. There's a chance it comes up and.
00:11:43.182 - 00:11:54.270, Speaker A: Like, more institutional in my mind, like, you know, salad, it's like, you know, do you love your mother? And, you know, iggy posting aspects and like, meme coins drive most of the revenue there, most of the excitement.
00:11:54.310 - 00:11:57.134, Speaker C: Yeah, that's bad. That's like kind of stupid, but I.
00:11:57.142 - 00:12:03.926, Speaker A: Don'T think people are going to see that as like are going to be. And first of all, there's no, there's no ETF, right? There's no way for most institutions to buy it.
00:12:04.038 - 00:12:05.822, Speaker C: Well, I'm not saying that like a.
00:12:05.846 - 00:12:07.686, Speaker A: Tech attack bet on crypto.
00:12:07.758 - 00:12:23.964, Speaker C: I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that bearish, like ethereum, ETF loads are good for soul. It's bad for everything. I don't, but like, I don't think it's guaranteed that people are ready to like eight this narrative.
00:12:24.052 - 00:12:25.116, Speaker A: Underpriced is what I'm saying.
00:12:25.188 - 00:12:27.972, Speaker D: Yeah, I think how to see how.
00:12:28.036 - 00:12:35.640, Speaker A: Like, determine what the flows are going to be, but I think the markets pricing them super bearish. And I think at this point, it's more likely to surprise.
00:12:36.100 - 00:13:03.900, Speaker B: I think you get. I think you have. You're going to have flows again from people converting, and then I think that they will fall off a cliff once the conversions stop. And so there's gonna be a trade where you probably de risk, whether it's one to two to three weeks after the ETF, once you start to see the slowdown, where the easiest flows are behind us. And now it's really you convincing people that there's a lot of value here.
00:13:04.060 - 00:14:00.568, Speaker D: But yeah, I think the big thing right now that's happening in the market and same kind of right after the bitcoin ETF is every market participant that's, like, done well and survived. Almost every big news event in crypto has been a sell the news, right? Like, almost every single one. So it's like we're all conditioned into this, like, shorter term thinking where it's like, okay, like, this event happens, and it's very rare that, like, the fundamental effect from it is actually going to keep up with, like, the hype that gets priced in because the market's very excited. And what's happened with these ETF's is that, like, it's been a complete shift in market structure. And, like, stuff for blackrock, you know, they're starting to put it as, like, a 1% allocation in a bunch of their funds. It's like, if that becomes the global standard of 1% allocation of bitcoin, like, there is still, like, so much inflows to come, like, hundreds of billions inflows to come. And so.
00:14:00.568 - 00:14:44.810, Speaker D: But that happened over a long period of time, right? So I think that, like, right now, we had an insanely, like, he did run up, up to 74k. Shit went crazy. We've chopped along in this range from, like 60 to 70. And then a lot of these, like, meme coins and, you know, low float, high FTB coins have gotten wrecked. And now, like, crypto, Twitter at least, like, the people are like, okay, like, we're cooked for now. But in reality, this is like, you know, a multi year timeframe, and everything's lining up really well for bitcoin. And I think on the ethereum side, there's so many angles and narratives that they could spin up that, a, like, improve the fundamentals and b, allow them to sell the product.
00:14:44.810 - 00:14:53.878, Speaker D: And, yeah, Solana might be better. Ceteris for sure. I agree with that. But it's like, it doesn't have an ETF right now, and there's still going to be, like, flows.
00:14:54.014 - 00:15:02.782, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Once again, we're not arguing ETH versus soul. We're arguing if the ETH will get flows and so we can, we can.
00:15:02.806 - 00:15:05.830, Speaker A: Move to ETH versus. We're going to discuss market dynamics anyway.
00:15:05.870 - 00:15:40.532, Speaker C: I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I guess one thing I'll say, though, this idea that, like, institutions are going to choose Ethereum is, like, provably wrong at this point anyways. Like, PayPal is literally incentivizing. There's like, you deposit PayPal on Camino and you get paid PayPal, stable coins. Right? So this idea that institutions will only deploy in, like, the Ethereum ecosystem is like a nice thing, people tell themselves, but institutions are rational, they will just deploy where is most profitable for them.
00:15:40.676 - 00:15:44.332, Speaker D: No, I definitely think that market share.
00:15:44.516 - 00:15:48.160, Speaker A: Like, most rwas are on Ethereum, though. Like, right now.
00:15:48.540 - 00:16:02.730, Speaker C: Yes, right now we're forward looking, though. Like. Yeah, like, it's pretty easy to see the projection of where this is going to go. Like, it's, it's pretty obvious where this is all going to go to me.
00:16:03.550 - 00:16:45.626, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I agree with that. But I think that the high value stuff in the stable coins right now have, like, are being, you know, mostly deployed on ETh. And that is definitely a mo for now. But the payments and the higher speed stuff, I definitely think Solana is, is taking share there. But I just think it would be so easy for Blackrock to, like, launch a stable coin or like, put more attention on this RWA stuff and just like, start this entire narrative up and actually, like, single handedly, like, get the reflexive cycle going for Ethereum again and, like, improve its fundamentals for a time. And people are just like, so bearish on that.
00:16:45.738 - 00:16:50.630, Speaker C: Well, maybe, listen, the lower the market goes, the more bullish you should become on the ETF, right?
00:16:51.130 - 00:16:52.190, Speaker D: Definitely.
00:16:53.170 - 00:17:25.136, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, the prediction markets, so they started pricing in camellia, like, day and a half ago. She was, I don't know, $0.03 or something, and now she started, and then she started skyrocketing up. And then about half an hour ago, it said Biden is mulling whether or not he's gonna run, which, I mean, that kind of seems like he's dropping out. And so I, I think prediction markets have definitely shown, like, their use in this. The other thing too, though, is like, bowdoin is.
00:17:25.208 - 00:17:33.752, Speaker B: What do you define as use, though? It's not like they're influencing the election. They're just a fun, very efficient way to speculate on them.
00:17:33.816 - 00:17:37.864, Speaker D: But, yeah, but it's good to see what's actually cut through the bullshit noise. Yeah.
00:17:37.952 - 00:17:41.088, Speaker B: It's also. There's. There's 5 million abetting on Kamala.
00:17:41.104 - 00:17:51.740, Speaker D: This is. Well, there's 80 million predicted in the democratic nominee, 2024. Right? 6 million. Yeah, come on.
00:17:52.560 - 00:17:54.224, Speaker B: Yeah, but, I mean, it's.
00:17:54.312 - 00:18:45.282, Speaker D: Yeah, but even so, like, et cetera, maybe remember this better. But, like, markets, like, I think they showed, like, even, like, a pretty small sample size of, like, markets are very good at, like, predicting, even if it's not a ton of liquidity or at least cutting through the noise of what's happening, it's not necessarily predicting what's going to happen, but it's like, digesting all the news that's coming out and then, like, putting an accurate representation on it, which I think is super helpful with, like, all this media stuff. Like, you know, all these different media sources, you don't know who to believe. Like, this is a great kind of source of truth. Like, I love checking this stuff to be like, okay, like, as long as the market's reasonably liquid, this is probably a pretty good proxy for actually what's going on versus, you could read, you know, 100 different headlines, and if you're not, like, a subject matter expert, like, you wouldn't really know which institution is telling the truth.
00:18:45.426 - 00:18:51.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's just, like, a broader issue of today's media landscape in the US.
00:18:51.930 - 00:18:58.218, Speaker D: Yeah. I just like them to digest information and take a look at what's going on.
00:18:58.354 - 00:19:07.160, Speaker C: Yeah. Is anybody gonna, is anybody gonna buy bowdoin? Like, this is the worst looking chart in probably the entire industry.
00:19:08.300 - 00:19:10.000, Speaker A: I round tripped my bowden.
00:19:10.740 - 00:19:26.240, Speaker C: Like, it's still 26. It's still 26 mil. It's like, what? So, okay, so the bear case for them is pretty easy to understand. Like, voting was funny. Voting was funny and then went to being sad. And, like, sad is not. And so.
00:19:26.240 - 00:19:45.408, Speaker C: But I still, like, what can anybody have, does anybody have, like, a case for why some of these political coins will retain any value after the election? Like, why are people still going to be holding Trump or MAGA or whatever?
00:19:45.544 - 00:20:10.916, Speaker B: I mean, it's the same argument that you can make for any meme coin, though. It's just a bet on attention. Right? And so if, like, why. Why is with going to continue holding value or Popcat's number one cat? But it's all the same rationale, right? Like, I don't understand. Like you were saying, it's not like you can redeem the Trump for something like that. But that was never the thesis behind any of this.
00:20:10.948 - 00:20:12.660, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.
00:20:12.740 - 00:20:13.988, Speaker B: So I don't know how.
00:20:14.044 - 00:20:23.196, Speaker C: I guess. I guess the reason is. But, well, I guess the reason is because there is, like, a clear end date for political coins versus meme coins.
00:20:23.308 - 00:20:24.052, Speaker B: For some of them.
00:20:24.076 - 00:20:24.760, Speaker C: I mean.
00:20:25.250 - 00:20:52.970, Speaker B: I mean, but at the same time, you could say, you know, he, as he becomes, if in the scenario where Trump wins and he's more constructive towards crypto, then. Then, you know, there's more attention. Like, again, it all sounds a bit ridiculous, but you have to view this through the lens of meme coin investing, and that's what we're doing. Right. And so if the idea is he will, I agree, the losing candidates, those should trend towards zero because those guys have no future attention.
00:20:54.590 - 00:21:00.038, Speaker A: The voting thing was that even if he fails, he'll do it. You know, the diaper stays on and.
00:21:00.054 - 00:21:00.610, Speaker D: So.
00:21:02.390 - 00:21:04.290, Speaker B: But, like, no one's thinking about it.
00:21:05.390 - 00:21:07.118, Speaker A: I feel like I was scammed on that.
00:21:07.174 - 00:21:09.422, Speaker D: Yeah, that was, that was a scam.
00:21:09.526 - 00:21:14.010, Speaker A: But I think people don't assure me that the diaper stayed on.
00:21:14.310 - 00:21:16.890, Speaker B: The Trump one is like, diaper does stay on.
00:21:19.440 - 00:21:30.096, Speaker D: I don't own Trump anymore, but I think it is like, the whole DJT thing. Like, that probably helped dearest Kim launching his own coin. So, like, that could, like, I'd say the other.
00:21:30.128 - 00:21:48.152, Speaker B: I take the other side of that. I think that kind of ruined his. Because they're, you know, we still don't really have full clarity on the degree of Baron's involvement, but it's clear that there was some. And so I think that kind of spoiled their opportunity to launch their own token.
00:21:48.176 - 00:21:50.352, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I mean.
00:21:50.456 - 00:21:52.744, Speaker B: Oh, which is bullish for Trump.
00:21:52.792 - 00:21:54.208, Speaker D: Yeah, got it.
00:21:54.224 - 00:22:04.248, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought you were going the other side on that. Like, it was going to. That was bullish on them launching their own token because it shows that there was appetite on their side to do it. But, yeah, I think that just, like, kind of ruined the setup for them.
00:22:04.384 - 00:22:06.540, Speaker D: At least for now. Who knows? Trump.
00:22:07.720 - 00:22:14.342, Speaker B: Because, like, I think part of the, the rationale on their end was it was going to be a potential fundraising mechanism as well.
00:22:14.536 - 00:22:27.830, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I could see him doing it, like that thing post election crazy. Yeah, yeah, but, yeah, that the political coins are strange.
00:22:28.890 - 00:22:35.550, Speaker B: I think they're as reasonable as most. Like, the most popular dog coin, the most popular cat coin, the most. Sure.
00:22:36.170 - 00:22:39.950, Speaker D: I'll agree with that. I think those are stupid, too.
00:22:41.640 - 00:23:20.146, Speaker B: So the one, I think, I guess, potentially bearish argument for the Trump coins, but I think that'll eventually reverse to the polyfi coins. Is there difficulty with getting listed on sexes? And so part of what helps on some of these meme coins is the fact that you can ape them on leverage. And so you also have opportunities to squeeze the shit out of people who come in on late shorts. And so that really kind of, I think volatility is very. Is a. Is a. Is what's needed for some of these meme coins to do well.
00:23:20.146 - 00:23:32.066, Speaker B: Right. Because they're the best trade to go long and then their best trade to go short. And so that the fact that perps exist, I think, is a huge benefit to some of these in terms of their ability to kind of.
00:23:32.258 - 00:23:48.674, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a good point. Like, on the pepe stuff, it was just seen as, like, really good eth beta. So, like, on the eth, everyone logged it, just, like, looking for something higher beta, and then it's come back down just as fast. So, like, it's a good tool to trade.
00:23:48.842 - 00:23:57.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Pepe's pretty good setup. I am long. Pepe going into the ETF.
00:23:58.020 - 00:24:29.020, Speaker C: Do we have theories for, like. So, I mean, stocks are doing pretty well again today and we're just selling off super hard. And we've also had a ton of big, like, political wins recently, too. It seems like, I guess the SEC suit, but I don't know, do people care when the SEC sues people now? Like, we've had the BNB secondary sales ruled out of security, which is pretty big. Even Gabe said that was big. And, like, when Gabe says that, then he thinks everything is not as big as people on Twitter make it out to be. So that was pretty bullish.
00:24:29.020 - 00:24:33.100, Speaker C: There was like, chevron, which I don't know anything about.
00:24:34.320 - 00:25:02.984, Speaker B: I think it's flows that are really Germany selling us, continuing to sell. I think once there's clarity on that front, that'll bring people in off the sidelines. And that's why I think the bitcoin conference where Trump is speaking could be a really solid catalyst because it potentially puts a lid on selling of, like, gox coins and all, and all the other stuff that they've taken.
00:25:03.152 - 00:25:08.432, Speaker D: Wait, they have gox coins, too? I thought it was just like the Silk road and the seizures.
00:25:08.496 - 00:25:11.488, Speaker B: Silk road. Sorry, sorry. Silk road. Yeah, gox. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:11.544 - 00:25:52.054, Speaker D: Well, what's been interesting over the past couple weeks? Let's say three weeks, I've been watching the price action pretty closely, and it's like, we had this sell off from, like, 71 at the start of June, all the way to 64, which was kind of unexplained because, like, equities are, like, ripping to new highs. Then we, like, sold off really sharply from 64 to, like, 58. Five based on the Mount Gox news coming out. So, like, we had some people front running that, and then after the debate, like, crypto rallied because it's like, okay, Trump looks like he's going to win. And then, like, the next day, like, everything was up. Like, equities are up. Like, everything that is correlated with crypto was up, and crypto sold off.
00:25:52.054 - 00:26:23.040, Speaker D: And then, like, later that day, the SEC sued consensus. So it felt like those are two events of, like, insiders front running the news again. Like, equities are up more today. And then crypto just randomly puked, like, 4% over the weekend. So is there going to be another news event? I feel like we've absorbed a lot of bad news. You have, like, Silk Road or, sorry, mount Gox coins, Germany selling, and then also those lawsuits. It's, like, now.
00:26:23.040 - 00:27:02.446, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like it just comes down to flows. Like, what other big surprise news is going to come out and smash crypto over the head? Especially coming into the election, where both candidates are kind of, like, more aware of crypto as, like, a potential, potential issue for voters and don't want to piss anyone off. So at least out of the US, I don't see any big things. Maybe it's just, like, flows slow down because it's summer and, like, that whole marketing engine kind of turns off, which could be also, like, an intermediate bear case for ETh. But, yeah, I feel like we've absorbed quite a bit of bad news, and we're still holding the range lows. Like, we're just. Yeah, like, we're not that high.
00:27:02.446 - 00:27:04.358, Speaker D: We're, like, 15% off the highs.
00:27:04.494 - 00:27:14.102, Speaker A: Yeah. Crypto Twitter vibes definitely make it seem like we're a lot lower. Although I think most people on crypto Twitter are overweight alts, which have just gotten destroyed.
00:27:14.286 - 00:27:17.930, Speaker D: And I don't, except for banana, made a new all time high yesterday.
00:27:18.710 - 00:27:19.790, Speaker A: Really nice.
00:27:19.870 - 00:27:20.530, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:22.710 - 00:27:34.820, Speaker A: Yeah. Except banana. And I don't think it's gonna get too much better for a lot of these alts. I think the supply, the man dynamics are pretty bad, as we've talked about for a long time on the hive mind.
00:27:35.840 - 00:27:52.300, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm curious what some of these are trading OTC at now. Like you said, dunkin. Like, bitcoin's off 15% off the high, but, I mean, celestial is, like, 75% off the high, you know, and there's a lot of, like, OTC stuff.
00:27:52.600 - 00:27:53.780, Speaker D: Fatality.
00:27:54.600 - 00:28:11.830, Speaker C: And, I mean, Tia's kind of, like, Tia is like, a legit project, right. And it's something people actually wanna, like, have a take on. And so it's like, it's a legit project. Should tib valuable is a different question, but it is a, like, legit, good project.
00:28:12.370 - 00:28:29.148, Speaker A: It's definitely a good project. I think it's definitely valuable, and I think that's one of the, like, better setups. Well, actually, I don't wanna say that that's a bit too much, but I do think that it's. It's not. It's not one of the worst ones, for sure.
00:28:29.284 - 00:28:30.440, Speaker C: It's getting better.
00:28:31.580 - 00:28:56.396, Speaker A: You had just, like, a lot of secondaries. A lot of secondaries happened above the current market price. While it was at $15 to $20, you had, like, reasonable, I think one of the higher ones, like, outside of the. Outside of, like, layer zero ton and Seoul, which I don't really consider, like, in the same. The same ballpark. It's one of the ones that had a higher secondary volume. And you also had that launch at, you know, it's up from where it launched.
00:28:56.428 - 00:28:56.572, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:56.596 - 00:29:05.116, Speaker A: It's one of the only ones where you're up. If you bought it on. On launch week, it launches like, two and a half bucks. And there's a lot of volume that took place about the market price. Cost basis is reset.
00:29:05.228 - 00:29:05.452, Speaker B: Now.
00:29:05.476 - 00:29:19.178, Speaker A: There still are, like, insiders that are up a ton. Like, I think the seed was a 10 million, but it's super legit project. Like, there's. There's, you know, there's a lot of stuff happening. A lot of people deploying roll ups on top of celestial stuff.
00:29:19.274 - 00:29:27.394, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's just like, I don't know, being. I don't know if being a legit project is enough to. Your token needs to be valuable.
00:29:27.482 - 00:29:35.386, Speaker D: Like, that's a legit project. It makes a couple million a year, doesn't it? Like what? I think someone said it would only.
00:29:35.418 - 00:29:47.712, Speaker A: Make you talk about the top cat in, like, the. This is that. This is a top cat coin. Like, how is that not, like, how is that not way less than being a legit project that's actually solving, like, an important problem in the space?
00:29:47.856 - 00:29:52.140, Speaker B: Well, it just goes back to the whole, like, the fundamentals can be bearish thing.
00:29:53.080 - 00:29:53.816, Speaker D: Yeah, that's.
00:29:53.888 - 00:30:00.552, Speaker B: Luckily there are. Listen to Russ Hanneman. Absolutely no revenue. Don't show revenue.
00:30:00.696 - 00:30:08.056, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is all, like, pre unlocks, you know, all this stuff.
00:30:08.208 - 00:30:09.368, Speaker C: There'S a lot of, like, a bunch.
00:30:09.384 - 00:30:34.134, Speaker A: Of these coins, weird distortion unlock actions. So it's gonna be pretty crazy. Once I think, unlocks. Hit on some of these and you have, like, billions of dollars of unrealized gains. I think there's stuff. There's a lot of stuff that's much closer to vaporware, I would say, with billions of dollars of unrealized gains, where you've gotta assume the team knows it's vaporware. They're not mission driven.
00:30:34.134 - 00:30:43.030, Speaker A: They haven't been here since, like, for years. Like the tier team has building through, you know, two or three bear markets. There's a lot of teams where I think it's like.
00:30:43.410 - 00:30:43.858, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:30:43.874 - 00:30:45.710, Speaker A: I think these charts are going to look really ugly.
00:30:46.490 - 00:31:10.890, Speaker C: I agree with that. And I think with Tia, it's like, listen, if the whole Tia thesis was only da, and that's, like, the whole thing, it's ever going to be. I'm not interested in that token. I don't care how many roll ups use it, but I think there's, like, a lot of future paths it can take, and that is, like, pretty easy to kind of get behind and convince yourself of. And so they are a legit team. They have, like, a lot of smart people. It's a good project.
00:31:10.890 - 00:31:12.846, Speaker C: It makes a lot of sense.
00:31:12.998 - 00:31:16.690, Speaker D: So I don't know if it's worth $6 billion, though.
00:31:17.870 - 00:31:22.022, Speaker A: It's just. It's just you got to compare them relatively, right? Some of this stuff.
00:31:22.086 - 00:31:23.510, Speaker D: No, that's coke.
00:31:23.670 - 00:31:24.822, Speaker A: That's not coke.
00:31:25.006 - 00:31:28.530, Speaker D: Unless. Unless it's an abs and wormhole, it's coke.
00:31:29.750 - 00:31:31.570, Speaker B: Unless it's my bags.
00:31:32.470 - 00:31:33.982, Speaker D: No, the relative value stuff is.
00:31:34.006 - 00:31:43.794, Speaker B: Honestly, such relative value stuff is. It's cope. Unless you're doing pear trades. But to think, like, you. One should reprice to the other.
00:31:43.962 - 00:31:44.770, Speaker A: No, that's.
00:31:44.890 - 00:31:53.070, Speaker B: If you think, like, they're going to converge, then. Then yes, converging or one reaching the high price of the other one.
00:31:53.370 - 00:32:16.344, Speaker A: It's more so that these things are priced in Ethan bitcoin terms. Right. There's a pretty good. Like, Doug had that really good. Doug from ambient had that really good post. Because everyone was saying, like, ftbs are really high when you launch, but actually, when you price these things in terms of eth, they're launching at pretty similar levels. Like, the floats are pretty similar to past cycles, and also the valuations are pretty similar in eth terms.
00:32:16.344 - 00:32:33.320, Speaker A: So, like, relative value to that extent isn't coke. Like, these things are priced and there's also, I think, someone else, I don't know if it was him, that showed that the same thing is actually true in traditional markets where the valuations correlate pretty well to the S and P and the Nasdaq. Like IPO.
00:32:33.620 - 00:32:56.928, Speaker D: No, there's definitely an element of that, but I think Kobe had, like, a thread where he talked about that. But it's also just like, some of these projects will clearly, like, I don't know if Tia's old roadmap, but at least just on the data availability roll up stuff, like, it's never gonna be worth five and a half billion, I don't think based, like, maybe, yeah, they.
00:32:56.944 - 00:33:12.192, Speaker C: Need to, like, come up with other. You need to come up with other business lines, which they can definitely do. So that's like part of it's like legit project, good team, and they're going to get a lot of roles playing on them. And then once you have a lot of roll ups on them, you can kind of like, start to fit in other pieces. Right.
00:33:12.256 - 00:33:57.976, Speaker A: So there's also like an interesting. I kind of talked to a few of you about this. An interesting, more sinister thing that's happened wherever I like a lot of the circulating supplies for some of these coins are just like Fugazi, like the coin gecko circulating supply. Like they include treasury or they include market maker tokens. And oftentimes, or not oftentimes, but sometimes they're overstated by, like up to ten X. The project that will not be named is an example of this, where the float, the actual float is much lower than the reported flow, which means that the first unlock is way heavier than it seems like it's going to be. And also, like, if you're looking at the unrealized gains to market cap ratio, it's.
00:33:57.976 - 00:34:20.889, Speaker A: There's some projects when you actually look at the reality, it's like 15 to 20 times, I don't think the people who are to your vest, it's literally like every month and a half, the whole market cap worth of value is unlocking. And you need like, that much buying pressure just to sustain. Like, it's. I don't know, it's. I don't see bullish on looks ahead.
00:34:20.969 - 00:34:42.705, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I think that our listeners probably know to stay away from these unless you've gone really deep on them. So that's good. But yeah, it's just kind of. We've talked about a bunch, but it's just. It's unfortunate. I just wonder what's the price action going to look at like, cause yon, you and I have talked about this a bunch, but you're like the price is set on the margin.
00:34:42.705 - 00:34:54.060, Speaker D: So it's like, it could look like there's so much selling coming and then the first unlock happens and then they're just down like 50% and then it's like, okay, it's not that much. Or they're down like 90% and the future's not that much.
00:34:54.480 - 00:35:22.154, Speaker C: Right? Yeah, I think with like this whole talking about like circulating fully deleted all this stuff, a lot that also matters is like the propensity to sell with these tokens. And so obviously the ones that unlock and like higher unrealized gain as Jose has talked about higher propensity to sell. But there's also like the just using them for grants and everything too. And like those, yeah, percent get sold all the time. And so that's why a lot of.
00:35:22.162 - 00:35:28.990, Speaker A: These l two s, that's world coin, right? $60 million a day worth and iron.
00:35:29.530 - 00:35:56.182, Speaker C: So essentially you just have all these protocols. They have like a monopoly on printing their own currency and they just print a bunch and that's how, that's what they use to like develop their project. And it's pretty heavy and it's just like constantly coming on the market. It takes a lot of just real buying pressure on those to like you're essentially funding all the grants if you're buying like the token on the open market.
00:35:56.286 - 00:35:57.982, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:35:58.006 - 00:36:22.000, Speaker B: They're all trades, not investments or most of them, I guess you look for good setups for oversold. You know, people are positioned well and then there's some, some catalysts coming up. But over time there's still going to be a lot of, a lot of net selling and so it's hard to be long term optimistic on them.
00:36:22.940 - 00:36:49.962, Speaker A: Yeah, I think project has raised too much money. You know, there's, there's too much like there's too many tokens sold at the low valuations and like there, one doesn't need to raise $200 million. Like realistically it's a software project. Then token itself is the incentive because you kind of raise this money and dilute yourself and then you're using your token for grants on top and diluting yourself further. It's just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:36:49.986 - 00:37:22.656, Speaker B: But like I think, I think it makes a lot of sense though. You, you kind of sell enough to fund a long Runway and then because you raised at sunbal earlier, right. You raised a couple hundred mil or whatever it might be. Because of that, there is a perception that your token should be more valuable. And so when you do these grants, you have a lot more ammo to use and you can make them kind of objective based grants. And so you can claw back if certain criteria. But it gives you a lot of ammo, though, to kind of.
00:37:22.656 - 00:37:30.452, Speaker B: I'm not saying the math necessarily checks out. I'm saying the logic is there to raise a bunch and then use it as grants at inflated vowels.
00:37:30.616 - 00:37:41.412, Speaker A: But in a world where people are more aware of these dynamics, like the unrealized gains to market cap and stuff, then they won't command a premium, right. It'll be kind of the opposite. Like, if you raised a bunch of money in a low valuation, you're like.
00:37:41.476 - 00:37:42.292, Speaker D: No, I don't think that.
00:37:42.316 - 00:37:44.284, Speaker A: I know those tokens are going to be easily.
00:37:44.412 - 00:38:08.072, Speaker B: I think that impacts it, but it doesn't net out. I. No way. I still think, like, if it's. If it were trading at one 10th Deval, the grants wouldn't be more valuable because there's less future selling like that. I think, sure, people are going to apply a discount to a very inflated valve, but it's not going to be. It's not going to reduce it enough where it's actually worth less than something trading at a much lower valve.
00:38:08.072 - 00:38:10.100, Speaker B: People still anchor in high numbers.
00:38:10.800 - 00:38:25.420, Speaker A: You've paid a lot to, like, all those tokens are going to be sold at some point, and the more these people are up, the more likely they are to be sold. And you don't need that much money to get to the same place.
00:38:26.210 - 00:38:26.818, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:38:26.874 - 00:38:27.402, Speaker A: I don't think.
00:38:27.466 - 00:38:33.630, Speaker D: Are you saying, like to sell less, sell less tokens and keep more in the treasury?
00:38:33.930 - 00:38:46.018, Speaker A: I'm saying, like, so, like, raise less money. So sell less tokens to investors. Yeah, keep more in the treasury or distribute or whatever. Like, you. These products don't need to be raising this much money.
00:38:46.114 - 00:39:19.994, Speaker C: I don't know, though, you can make the case that, like, if you raise so much money, then you can also just use like, dollars for grants, your own token. And so then you have the double dip of, like, your valuation is probably higher and then you're also not actually using your token as currency more, because if you. If you're just going to use your token as currency for most of the grants, then that's just like a consistent headwind that you're dealing with versus if you. I mean, yeah, there's no reason why projects need like 200 plus mil.
00:39:20.122 - 00:39:34.074, Speaker B: They're never going to point out flaws in raising a lot, but I don't think it's better overall for the project, nor do I think it provides them with more optionality versus raising less. So like, yes, you can point out.
00:39:34.162 - 00:39:37.074, Speaker A: Raising more, but I think, yeah, but.
00:39:37.082 - 00:39:50.870, Speaker B: At the same time, if there's appetite to raise for people to invest, I think there's, it's, it's rational to build up your us dollar based treasury and ensure that you have Runway for a long time.
00:39:51.370 - 00:40:09.602, Speaker A: It's rational for the team, but I don't think it's necessarily rational or good for the project long term. And I don't think overfunded projects do very well either. When you look historically, even the successful projects, Solana didn't raise that much. The biggest round, it did. How much did they raise in the coin list auction?
00:40:09.786 - 00:40:12.114, Speaker B: Yeah, but that was more a function of the size of the market at.
00:40:12.122 - 00:40:20.514, Speaker C: The time rather than we had. Yeah, we had one of these mega raises, actually have like their token and have we, stop.
00:40:20.562 - 00:40:32.874, Speaker A: To me, there's a bunch of these other ones raised up. Raise a lot of money. Aptos, wormhole. Raise a lot of money. There's a raise a lot of money. Those raise a really good ballast, to be fair, those have, don't have the issue.
00:40:32.922 - 00:40:52.358, Speaker B: You're a project. Like, everything comes with trade offs. But I think it's, you're better off raising more when it's available because it's not always gonna necessarily be there. And so you should take it when you can and then just kind of, then you have the optionality of deciding what you wanna use to fund grants or expansion.
00:40:52.534 - 00:41:09.444, Speaker A: I just think you should have like 24 to 36 months Runway for your, like, for whatever it is you wanna achieve, and not like 20 years, which is like, realistically what. Otherwise you end up like polka dot spending money on animated coin gecko logos. You know, you literally.
00:41:09.492 - 00:41:10.932, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's, yeah, that's just like.
00:41:10.956 - 00:41:15.620, Speaker B: I think there's a lot more governance. Yeah. That's not necessarily a product of raising.
00:41:15.660 - 00:41:19.940, Speaker C: I don't know. Everybody, everybody one project has animated.
00:41:19.980 - 00:41:20.852, Speaker B: I agree. Yeah.
00:41:20.916 - 00:41:43.610, Speaker A: No, your Runway expand. You should think about it in terms of what you need and then raise that rather than how much can I raise? And then, okay, let me, let me expand my team, my resources according to how much I can raise, which is realistically what people are doing in crypto. Like, it's very hard to spend $150 million productively, or like nine figures in any case, productively for a crypto project. Like, even if you're a layer one.
00:41:44.430 - 00:41:49.390, Speaker D: I think you're kind of like, there's too many factors to, like, de facto say, raise less.
00:41:49.470 - 00:42:12.992, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly. I think raising more gives you optionality, and so it's ultimately up to the team to decide what they're going to do with it. I agree that there are conditional elements where it's like, naturally, if you raise more, you're more likely to be kind of irresponsible with it. I agree. But I still think ultimately it boils down to the fact that it just gives you more optionality.
00:42:13.176 - 00:42:24.162, Speaker A: Like ethereum raised 17 million in an ICO. Like, when you look at all the most successful network, I was going to put cosmos in there. I don't know if it spread. I mean, it's still a $7 billion, whatever. That's one of the highest market.
00:42:24.226 - 00:42:30.510, Speaker C: I mean, it's only like, it's only like two x above where it came public. Like five years ago.
00:42:32.290 - 00:43:02.374, Speaker A: They raised like, ethereum raised 17 million. I think Solana raised very little in their coin list auction. I don't remember how much. I think it might have been like $2 million, and then there was like two or $3 million raised before that. And like, I see this consistently, that the most successful teams in general are raising small amounts of money that get to their next milestone and being really agile and like, um, just efficient with the funding. And teams that raise a lot then have. Now you need an HR person because you need to expand your team way faster.
00:43:02.374 - 00:43:04.222, Speaker A: You need a fancy office. You need to do pony.
00:43:04.286 - 00:43:06.450, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that, yeah.
00:43:06.830 - 00:44:20.194, Speaker B: Brad Gerstner and, and, uh, and Bill Gurley had that pot on, on basically just the, the effects of, or like how they thought the venture landscape was going to evolve after 2001, where it was more of the value be captured on the private side because you had what Google did, where they raised very little and were able to accomplish a lot. And then Zurp and just VC's raising a bunch of money forced these companies to just take on these massive checks. And so taking all that money, like you mentioned, created a lot of bloat. But I think it's a little bit different on the crypto side because you have this token and basically the fact that you have the optionality of using cash or token on the incentive side. So I don't know, I still think for a lot of these projects, it makes sense for them to raise, perhaps not to the same degree, but I'm probably somewhere in the middle between where you stand and what currently played out.
00:44:20.362 - 00:44:33.482, Speaker D: Where it's also the type of people who are going to raise like, you know, the type of people are going to raise small rounds just to do what they need. They're probably like very, like, you know, pragmatic, mission focused, versus, like, the marketers are going to, like, raise.
00:44:33.586 - 00:45:28.034, Speaker A: No, I think at some point it makes sense to, like, I'm not saying you don't always need to raise. Like, if you're, if you have big ambitions and you've got product market fit, it makes sense to throw fuel on the fire and raise a lot of money when you know how you want to deploy it. But you should start with what you need and then raise that rather than starting with what you can raise, which is what I think a lot of people are doing in crypto. And to me it should be like a seed round and then depending on how complex your project is, like series A, and then there should be some kind of form of ico that you can do where you can raise money directly from the public or you go live and then do like a treasury sale once the token's live. If you raise too much, I just think it really screws with your incentives and I haven't seen it really go that well, with obviously exceptions, for sure. And I think that's part of the problem, why these projects raise so much. It's just going to be tough to sort of pay that back.
00:45:28.082 - 00:45:28.670, Speaker D: Right.
00:45:29.130 - 00:45:38.968, Speaker A: Because that's effectively what you're doing when these unlocks happen and it's going to just be tough to, to pay all that back. Yeah, yeah.
00:45:39.104 - 00:45:42.328, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, we can move topics I think we've done.
00:45:42.504 - 00:45:56.368, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that was it for the topics I had. Does anyone want to talk about anything else? I had, like, Pendle randomly on the topics just because there's a bunch of people that were super bullish. Pendle.
00:45:56.424 - 00:46:01.104, Speaker C: Well, yeah, Pendle's a weird one because I guess it, it did well.
00:46:01.232 - 00:46:02.678, Speaker A: A bunch of people on Twitter.
00:46:02.864 - 00:46:21.306, Speaker C: Yeah, it did well due to something that wasn't actually their, like, business model. And so now that that's going away, which is essentially they were what? Kind of like an ICO type platform. Yeah. Now I guess it's like unclear. They got a most pivoting hundred percent.
00:46:21.378 - 00:46:21.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:22.042 - 00:46:27.914, Speaker C: Like they took advantage. Most teams just like, keep going to just like, good product.
00:46:28.002 - 00:46:49.008, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I just think that it became like most of their TVL attraction comes from being an ICO platform. Right. Where people are buying YT and, like, effectively participating in an ICO and the other side is taking the fixed yield and I don't know how sustainable that meta is.
00:46:49.184 - 00:47:06.728, Speaker D: Well, it'll try just like, it's a function of market, like heat, right? Like people launch and raise money and do these points things and the market's hot, and then when it's not, they don't. So it's like, it'll probably gyrate like a launch pad type of business where it's like, market's hot, the revenue's high.
00:47:06.904 - 00:47:14.736, Speaker A: But it's just like a very, it's a very crappy way of like, achieving that job to be done.
00:47:14.768 - 00:47:14.912, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:14.936 - 00:47:29.534, Speaker A: Like the people buying yt, and I'm one of them, are just trying to get exposure to these, to these early stage or like relatively early stage projects. But like, you don't know how much you're buying a. You don't know how much they're going to issue. Like, you don't know, like, it's for.
00:47:29.542 - 00:47:33.850, Speaker D: Sure, but it's more like a regulatory arbitrage, right?
00:47:34.230 - 00:47:52.734, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's unclear whether that, whether it actually stands. And also, I think, like, there's Kobe's thing that's doing icos. There's like, we're incubating a project that's doing that too. I think if icos come back, that's just a much cleaner way for sure to participate in early stage projects. Right. That's my main issue with it. It's like, yeah, it's very hacky way of getting.
00:47:52.782 - 00:48:24.846, Speaker B: It was more of a way to kind of allow for people to participate in the initial, like, TVL bootstrapping these projects while simultaneously de risking by giving up the upside and taking a fixed return. So I think it was a combination of things. Right? The fact that it was combining two elements. Yes. The buyers of that's fair, wanting exposure and the sellers of people wanting to de risk for providing capital to the athenas of the world.
00:48:24.918 - 00:48:34.286, Speaker A: But don't you think they should be two separate sort of markets? You know, you would just like pay your capital providers for capital and then the people that want to buy your token should just buy your token rather than.
00:48:34.318 - 00:48:35.782, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it should be both.
00:48:35.886 - 00:49:02.990, Speaker B: But I think it's. I think it'd be both. I think you can have those who want to purely buy into the token, but I think the market is probably a bit larger for you combining the two, because there's also the speculative element of which encourages additional participation. Not speculative element on the upside of the token, but also how much you're going to get. And so it can be like both a feature and a bug.
00:49:03.410 - 00:49:09.714, Speaker D: I think it's more of a bug, but it's definitely just a regulatory thing.
00:49:09.762 - 00:49:09.946, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:09.978 - 00:49:18.220, Speaker D: It's like, so many of these projects are just regulatory arts. Like, if there was a way to, like, completely sell the token like an ICO, they would probably rather do that.
00:49:18.260 - 00:49:43.440, Speaker B: Well, it's also depending on the scale that you want to do it. Right. Like, if you want to participate in, like, really early stage stuff, there's not going to be the capacity to do it in massive size, but for these huge farms. Right. Like, again, just going back to Athena as the example where there's, you know, nine figures of exposure possible, I don't think you're really going to be able to achieve that through, like, a seed stage ICO platform.
00:49:44.330 - 00:49:44.946, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:45.058 - 00:49:51.906, Speaker A: You can't get nine figures of exposure on the YT either, though. Not without, like, not without meaningfully moving.
00:49:52.058 - 00:49:54.738, Speaker B: Not individually, I think, like, in aggregate.
00:49:54.874 - 00:50:01.770, Speaker D: But I think it'll probably. The business will come back assuming points in the YT stuff. YTPT stuff.
00:50:01.850 - 00:50:04.082, Speaker B: Yeah. I definitely don't think points are dead by any means.
00:50:04.186 - 00:50:08.190, Speaker A: No. I think this is a market function.
00:50:08.570 - 00:50:34.628, Speaker C: I saw Kane had a thread today for. I forgot his project Infinix or something. He's doing this, like, you farming access to come to be in the ICO. So it's not like an ICO open to everyone. I think you need to do some, like, work, but then you are able to participate in the ICO after, which is like, kind of. He says, we're in the thread. Like, it's probably still not legal, but, like, it's a good way.
00:50:34.628 - 00:50:38.110, Speaker C: Like, the incentives kind of make sense. It's an interesting idea.
00:50:38.730 - 00:51:08.566, Speaker A: We're, like, scheming on something similar. I think that's an interesting idea. Like, using points to basically, like, rather than give you an airdrop, give you, like, discounts on a future ICO is kind of an interesting idea. Like, you qualify for the ability to purchase the token or whatever, but you'll still probably end up with a secondary market. Right. For people that, like the YT equivalent for people that farmed it, but don't actually want to do the SEO. So I don't know, I think these things always get, like, markets find a way to.
00:51:08.566 - 00:51:18.270, Speaker A: Anyway, I think that was. That was good. In the end, I was losing hope there in the middle when we were discussing cat coins and political.
00:51:18.350 - 00:51:22.610, Speaker D: See, Jose, we're aligned on the memes. Yeah.
00:51:25.190 - 00:51:29.210, Speaker A: The difference is I trade them. I don't like them, but I trade them.
00:51:30.070 - 00:51:36.290, Speaker D: There's only one play you need for memes. It's called banana again. Give you exposure to everything.
00:51:37.230 - 00:51:42.838, Speaker B: Beautiful, beautiful coin with, like, a 0.2 beta. And I say this with, I have a big bag of banana.
00:51:42.894 - 00:51:48.142, Speaker D: It's at all time highs. All your means are down 75 fucking percent. What do you mean, a 0.2 beta?
00:51:48.286 - 00:51:53.810, Speaker C: I mean, also, just like farming stable coins, you're always at all time highs, too, right? So.
00:51:55.990 - 00:52:00.940, Speaker D: It'S up like three x. This like it. What was it?
00:52:02.240 - 00:52:04.704, Speaker B: I'm still up here. Reacts on my memes.
00:52:04.832 - 00:52:11.896, Speaker D: This year, it's up five times while paying a yield the whole time, 20% to 40%, y'all.
00:52:11.928 - 00:52:17.528, Speaker C: Yeah, but, Duncan, these memes like, and listen, I don't. I didn't catch any's, but some of these go, like, hundred x before they go.
00:52:17.624 - 00:52:20.368, Speaker B: But you don't draw down.
00:52:20.424 - 00:52:20.760, Speaker D: You're still.
00:52:20.800 - 00:52:22.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't like. I don't do the.
00:52:23.360 - 00:52:37.280, Speaker D: Before. We've talked about this before, everybody. If you pick the best performing meme. If you pick the best performing meme, then it's going to outperform this coin. But it's more about certainty and sizing and all these other factors.
00:52:37.400 - 00:52:42.280, Speaker C: Yeah, some deserve to take a little risk. Duncan, this guy's buying index tokens.
00:52:42.440 - 00:52:50.680, Speaker A: Duncan's such a contradiction. He's like a 21 year old who's bullish gold and cash flow.
00:52:51.980 - 00:52:53.800, Speaker D: I just turned 23 today.
00:52:54.580 - 00:52:55.444, Speaker A: Oh, no shit.
00:52:55.492 - 00:52:56.036, Speaker B: Happy birthday.
00:52:56.068 - 00:52:56.516, Speaker C: Happy birthday.
00:52:56.548 - 00:52:57.692, Speaker A: Happy birthday, sir.
00:52:57.836 - 00:52:58.796, Speaker C: One thing I'll say about.
00:52:58.868 - 00:53:00.060, Speaker D: I feel old now.
00:53:00.220 - 00:53:28.160, Speaker C: I don't agree with all of. I don't agree with all of Duncan's takes, but I do respect that Duncan actually tries to develop, like, fundamental thesis for everything that he's interested in. And so he doesn't just, like, do narrative or. Or, like, trend following type stuff. I was gonna say it anyways, but now I'll use that as my birthday.
00:53:29.700 - 00:53:31.120, Speaker A: Jan, it's your turn.
00:53:32.140 - 00:53:33.360, Speaker B: I got a list.
00:53:34.780 - 00:53:41.756, Speaker A: I didn't pull up my list. All right. Oh, sorry.
00:53:41.828 - 00:53:42.324, Speaker D: Get those.
00:53:42.372 - 00:53:42.796, Speaker B: Okay.
00:53:42.868 - 00:53:44.520, Speaker C: You got the one compliment.
00:53:46.650 - 00:53:51.370, Speaker A: I love your rug in the background. And your office looks very legal.
00:53:51.530 - 00:53:52.550, Speaker D: Thanks, guys.
00:53:52.970 - 00:54:11.578, Speaker A: And altcoin, treasure trove. What do we call you? Treasure. Treasure hunter. And I appreciate your banana pig. Probably my only alt. That's not down 50%, so that's nice.
00:54:11.634 - 00:54:11.898, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:11.954 - 00:54:13.742, Speaker B: I'm enjoying being a banana holder.
00:54:13.866 - 00:54:14.846, Speaker D: Same here.
00:54:14.998 - 00:54:18.210, Speaker A: I'm not enjoying being a synapse holder as much.
00:54:19.070 - 00:54:21.570, Speaker D: Guys, don't worry. The chain's coming soon.
00:54:22.470 - 00:54:24.846, Speaker A: The chain's been coming soon since 2022.
00:54:24.918 - 00:54:28.290, Speaker D: Yeah. That must mean it's really soon.
00:54:30.750 - 00:54:38.734, Speaker A: Surely it's sooner now than it will. It's like sharding. It's like the ETH sharding fucking roadmap.
00:54:38.862 - 00:54:40.094, Speaker D: All right, well, thanks, guys.
00:54:40.142 - 00:54:47.738, Speaker A: All right, boys, let's wrap up. Thanks, everyone, for tuning in. We'll see you. Is it next week? No, in two weeks for the next episode. Cheers, everybody.
00:54:47.874 - 00:54:48.706, Speaker B: Bye.
