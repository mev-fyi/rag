00:00:05.160 - 00:00:34.209, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Delphi hive mind. Today we have Jason, our markets wizard, stepping in for Jose, as usual, we have Ceteris, our head of research, and Jan, our head of ventures. So I guess we can just get things kicked off here. Crazy weekend, obviously, just in general for the US Slash the world, and then also crypto with the Trump assassination attempt. That was pretty. That was pretty wild.
00:00:34.209 - 00:00:36.001, Speaker A: Anyone have thoughts on that?
00:00:36.153 - 00:01:06.463, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just the main thing being how much of a turnaround there would, or rather, I guess, where we'd be trading if that bullet was one inch to the right. And not to focus everything around crypto prices, obviously there's a whole host of other issues that would come from that. But I guess more specifically to crypto, since that's what we're talking about, we'd probably be in the 40s or something like that if that bullet hit instead of ripping through. Mid-60s.
00:01:06.639 - 00:01:17.527, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Like, obviously, crypto is one aspect, which is, like, how many things would be different if that was, like. Yeah. If things were just a little bit different on. When was that? Saturday.
00:01:17.711 - 00:01:19.439, Speaker C: Was that Friday. Friday night?
00:01:19.527 - 00:01:20.015, Speaker B: Friday.
00:01:20.135 - 00:01:22.717, Speaker A: Saturday, yeah. Pretty wild.
00:01:22.861 - 00:01:27.309, Speaker D: I don't know. I. I was sleeping because I was in. I was in Brussels.
00:01:27.397 - 00:01:27.989, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay.
00:01:28.037 - 00:01:45.797, Speaker D: And then I woke up to, like, the fam chat, and I was, like, still kind of not. I was still, like, tired. I didn't really comprehend it. But then. Yeah, it was. It was kind of crazy catching up on all that after the fact and turned out being bullish, though. Like.
00:01:45.797 - 00:01:56.007, Speaker D: Yeah, like, now it's. It's a lot of. Yeah, it cemented him. Like, it's. It's moved a lot of people to support him. Like, that picture is so iconic.
00:01:56.151 - 00:01:56.455, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:56.495 - 00:01:59.555, Speaker D: Picture probably got, like, 1 2% of votes. That picture alone.
00:01:59.975 - 00:02:37.825, Speaker B: The whole argument that, like, I feel like it's a. You know, you see someone's true, like, animal instincts in those scenarios, and then, you know, people kind of trying to point the finger and say it was, you know, taking advantage of a situation to get photos and votes. I mean, I don't know. I don't really see there being a lot of kind of calculated decision making. Ten seconds after you, like, a couple of bullets whiz by your head with one hitting your ear, I feel like that that's just, like, your inner rage, and I think that people just really enjoyed seeing that.
00:02:38.405 - 00:02:49.017, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, those takes were. There's some weird. There's some weird people out there, basically. As hell put it. Um, you don't really Know how you're gonna react until that happens. Right. Like, I don't know what I would do.
00:02:49.017 - 00:02:50.217, Speaker D: Would I fist pump or would I.
00:02:50.241 - 00:02:51.177, Speaker B: Like, I would run?
00:02:51.281 - 00:03:01.361, Speaker D: Just run. I'd probably. I'd probably run. I probably wouldn't be fist pumping, but maybe it'd be nice. It's a nice thought to think I would be fist pumping. So.
00:03:01.513 - 00:03:08.729, Speaker A: Yeah. Pretty insane. Did you guys see that, like, 3D rendering where they had, like, the whole 3D face and then just, like, showed.
00:03:08.817 - 00:03:11.817, Speaker B: It's like the aerial view where it just rotating.
00:03:12.001 - 00:03:22.241, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it was pretty wild because, like, heads like this and the bullet's going, and then he's just like. And it goes by his ear. That was the wrong direction.
00:03:22.393 - 00:03:32.106, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, so bringing this back to, like, markets, I guess we were what, we were like, what, 60ish when that happened.
00:03:32.228 - 00:03:33.329, Speaker A: 59. Yeah.
00:03:33.451 - 00:03:35.225, Speaker C: Like 58. 59.
00:03:35.345 - 00:04:03.315, Speaker D: Yeah. And now it's like, now you're seeing all these, like, a 16Z and all these supporters coming out, being pro Trump. There's this podcast Yesterday with the A16C guys, and it was pretty interesting, but, like, how they're all pushing their support towards Trump now. Yeah, it's, like, not taboo. It's not taboo to support Trump publicly now, which is the biggest difference from, I think, when he got selection.
00:04:03.395 - 00:04:24.843, Speaker C: Dude, it was wild. Dude, it was wild. At least where I lived, like, in New York, it was like, like, if you would like, even, like, suggest that you were thinking about maybe voting Trump. It was. Yeah, it was lots of social ostracization. It was just like a very weird environment, one that I had never, like, seen before. I was like, this is like, super weird.
00:04:24.843 - 00:04:37.335, Speaker C: Like, why? But, yeah, it, like, kind of makes it, like, I don't know, openly supporting him is, like, the popular thing now, kind of. Which is also kind of wild to me, given how fast things change.
00:04:37.715 - 00:04:38.187, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:38.251 - 00:04:46.555, Speaker B: It does seem like he's a bit of a different person now versus before, too, in terms of understanding what needs to be done and. And approaching the role differently.
00:04:46.675 - 00:04:46.979, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:47.027 - 00:05:10.235, Speaker B: Firing less from the hip, being more calculated, surrounding himself with smarter people. I think that's probably what the. The tech community sees quite a bit of. Right. It's just how difficult the current administration is when it comes to M and A and regulation and stifling, all of that. And having a candidate who's, you know, kind of going the complete other direction on that front.
00:05:10.615 - 00:05:26.287, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, instead of having Mike Pence in his pocket now he's got essentially Peter Thiel. Right. So it's a pretty big. It's a pretty big upgrade. And people are calling him, like, the shadow. The new shadow president, which would be, like, bullish for tech and stuff.
00:05:26.287 - 00:05:26.955, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:29.065 - 00:05:38.873, Speaker A: So, yeah, I just got a notification on Poly Market. Biden's odds jump over 75 of dropping out. Yeah, yeah, that one.
00:05:38.979 - 00:05:48.325, Speaker B: 2 of, like, tweet 1. I'll drop out if. If I'm sick, if I'm diagnosed with something, and then three hours later, I. I am sick.
00:05:51.905 - 00:05:52.741, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:52.913 - 00:05:54.185, Speaker C: It's a circus.
00:05:54.805 - 00:06:01.077, Speaker A: So wait, what happens if Biden drops out? Does it go to Kamala or they. And then who's the vp?
00:06:01.261 - 00:06:05.021, Speaker B: I think they have to pick that at this point.
00:06:05.053 - 00:06:08.829, Speaker C: Yeah, it does. Right. Because it's too late to change it. Is that. Is that how that works?
00:06:08.877 - 00:06:14.333, Speaker B: I think in order to keep the funding that they raised, the $90 million ticket.
00:06:14.429 - 00:06:14.981, Speaker C: Gotcha.
00:06:15.093 - 00:06:16.425, Speaker A: I heard that too.
00:06:16.965 - 00:06:33.525, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. I'm not sure, but that makes sense. Which I guess would be like. I guess that's, like, better, right? Because, like, wasn't the argument, like, a couple weeks ago or a couple months ago? Like, if Biden's, like, drops out, it actually makes it tougher for Trump to win because they replace him with somebody who's, like, alive. So.
00:06:34.305 - 00:06:43.289, Speaker B: Yeah, the problem is it just kind of, you know, usurps the whole Democratic primary process and basically allows, you know, a few people in power to kind.
00:06:43.297 - 00:06:44.425, Speaker C: Of pick the cabinet.
00:06:44.585 - 00:06:45.801, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is.
00:06:45.993 - 00:06:55.355, Speaker D: It's pretty bad that this. It happened now. And, like, it didn't. That. That's, I think, kind of shady, I guess. Like, everybody knew he was like this the whole time.
00:06:56.215 - 00:07:05.127, Speaker A: Well, yeah, like, right after the debate, it. The whole thing, everything seems like there's just a little bit of orchestrated. Like, literally right after the debate, the whole CNN panel just starts trashing it.
00:07:05.191 - 00:07:06.035, Speaker C: Drop out.
00:07:07.855 - 00:07:26.145, Speaker D: Still. The media is. It is insane to me how some of these people have jobs. Like I was. There's that. There was this thing on Emma NBC yesterday, and this host was comparing Biden recovering Joy Reid, Biden recovering from COVID just as heroic as Trump surviving the assassination.
00:07:27.005 - 00:07:28.093, Speaker A: This is strong.
00:07:28.189 - 00:07:34.985, Speaker B: She's been awful. I mean, if you. If you see she. All of her takes are that caliber of just like. What.
00:07:36.285 - 00:07:37.525, Speaker C: That caliber.
00:07:37.645 - 00:07:38.309, Speaker D: Yeah. That's crazy.
00:07:38.357 - 00:07:43.431, Speaker A: Anyways. It is pretty insane. Yeah. Anyways.
00:07:43.623 - 00:07:48.167, Speaker D: But I mean. Well, we got the. We got ETTF on Tuesday. Right.
00:07:48.311 - 00:07:49.119, Speaker A: Well, I guess the last.
00:07:49.167 - 00:07:49.935, Speaker D: You also got the.
00:07:50.015 - 00:07:53.679, Speaker B: The J.D. vance. Yeah, I think. Yeah. That's a. It's a big appointment. Right.
00:07:53.679 - 00:08:32.293, Speaker B: For a couple of reasons, I guess. More Crypto specifically is because he's disclosed holdings between 1 and 250k. He's a tech guy, but. But still kind of, you know, really appeals to middle America, but as part of this younger demographic. Teal kind of understudy. And so before we had Trump being bullish, now you have VP being bullish. And I think this is probably going to be one of the more impactful VPs in a while, whereas previously it was kind of just a position to.
00:08:32.293 - 00:08:50.954, Speaker B: How many marginal votes can this guy give me that smile and wave? Exactly. And here the idea is, you know, he, he's. They're kind of positioning him to try and be the future of the party. So it's not just like a fresh start after four years, but rather a kind of a transition to a longer term.
00:08:52.054 - 00:08:55.190, Speaker C: What do you, what do you guys think they're going to say at the conference? The.
00:08:55.262 - 00:08:56.150, Speaker B: I was wondering.
00:08:56.302 - 00:08:56.686, Speaker C: Friends.
00:08:56.750 - 00:09:07.603, Speaker B: Yeah, I gotta imagine it's. We'll. We'll hold balance sheet btc. That would be super bullish if, if they, if they add like that would be, you know, the most bullish way.
00:09:07.619 - 00:09:08.939, Speaker A: They're gonna announce that they're.
00:09:09.027 - 00:09:14.107, Speaker D: Yeah, there's no way they're gonna do that. That would send us to 100k. That. Send us to 100k.
00:09:14.171 - 00:09:20.255, Speaker A: But anyways, for those who don't know, I think Trump's. And who. Trump and who else are speaking at the big conference?
00:09:22.235 - 00:09:23.227, Speaker C: It was Trump.
00:09:23.371 - 00:09:24.575, Speaker B: Suspect Sa.
00:09:25.635 - 00:09:44.561, Speaker A: Nice. So I think that's at the end of July. When is that? A couple weeks? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the best thing you can do is like, hey, we're not gonna make it illegal and we're gonna have like, better regulation and maybe some stuff around self custody. Like we're going to protect your right to self custody. And then. Yeah, we're going to.
00:09:44.561 - 00:09:44.753, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:44.769 - 00:10:07.437, Speaker B: The one message he keeps also parroting is obviously unrealistic, but still it's something that you can infer from is the whole we want all the bitcoin being made in the US Kind of thing, which maybe there's, there's kind of friendly tax structures or something like that for miners, I don't know, something favorable for miners to bring more of that on shore.
00:10:07.621 - 00:10:10.665, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a funny thing to say.
00:10:11.445 - 00:10:13.301, Speaker C: Bitcoin's made in the U.S. bring back.
00:10:13.333 - 00:10:15.505, Speaker B: The jobs and bring back the bitcoin.
00:10:16.565 - 00:10:21.385, Speaker D: Yeah, but you won't be able to buy China bitcoin. There'll be a 50% tariff.
00:10:25.525 - 00:10:31.889, Speaker A: Yeah. And then. Yeah. So ETF next week, that'll finally In July. There we go.
00:10:31.997 - 00:10:33.321, Speaker C: Yeah. Tuesday for that one.
00:10:33.353 - 00:10:53.145, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think so. And we've seen some like insane flows into the bitcoin ETF in the past like eight or nine days. I think it's like, I don't know what, like, I think it's over 2 billion now in the past nine days trading days, which is basically the German selling. Yeah, but these guys, these guys are diamond handed.
00:10:53.265 - 00:11:00.105, Speaker D: I think Gox, Germans, Gox coins are all being distributed like Kraken will be next week, I think.
00:11:00.405 - 00:11:01.909, Speaker C: Yeah, I did see that.
00:11:02.077 - 00:11:02.917, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:03.101 - 00:11:07.573, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the market seems to be taking that pretty well, all things considered.
00:11:07.629 - 00:11:12.861, Speaker D: I mean I don't think most people are going to sell it. They're probably going to try to make it all back, you know.
00:11:12.973 - 00:11:39.985, Speaker A: Oh yeah. But I guess like the big thing with the Gox coins is like, you know, this process has been going on for like 10 years, 10 or 11 years. So if people really needed the money then there was definitely ways to earlier liquidity versus just like waiting and holding the bitcoin. Because even if you think like the opportunity cost of like waiting those 11 years, if you like really needed the money, is like pretty massive. So.
00:11:42.085 - 00:12:03.751, Speaker B: There'D be some selling off this like you know, the whole idea of oh, he got in early. But you know, part of the difficulty of, you know, is of actually realizing that all that performance is holding the whole time. And so these guys were kind of forced holders and you got to imagine you know, the amount that they're getting. Although wasn't it, isn't it being distributed at cost or something?
00:12:03.943 - 00:12:42.935, Speaker A: No. So they only recovered 15% of the Bitcoin from the exchange which, but like Bitcoin's like 100x so like they basically I think cover everyone in kind and they force you to hold. But it's not like they're recovering all of it. So that obviously helps. So it's like 10x the value instead of or 15x the value instead of, you know, 100 or 100x the value. Yeah, there's probably gonna be some selling but I don't know if it's gonna be as bad as like the Germans literally just dumped 40,000 BTC in like a week with everyone watching them during.
00:12:42.975 - 00:12:45.463, Speaker B: Probably the most illiquid time. You could do it.
00:12:45.479 - 00:12:46.063, Speaker A: Yes.
00:12:46.239 - 00:12:47.675, Speaker B: Mid summer holiday.
00:12:48.095 - 00:12:53.047, Speaker A: Started it on July 4th, accelerated it on July 4th. Yeah, that was just ridiculous.
00:12:53.111 - 00:12:59.275, Speaker D: Yeah. This is why we have to make bitcoin a bad tool for criminals so that governments can't confiscate it. And then Dump it.
00:13:01.055 - 00:13:02.815, Speaker C: Because that's where the selling.
00:13:02.895 - 00:13:08.745, Speaker D: Every time, every time a government confiscates bitcoin from one of these things, they're just going to methodically.
00:13:08.935 - 00:13:13.853, Speaker A: Well, the U.S. the U.S. has it 20 U.S. has it 4 billion or 12 billion.
00:13:13.909 - 00:13:23.333, Speaker D: That's a lot. That's like a lot. I'm talking. This was like a small government. This wasn't like the German Federal Government. This was like some. Some smaller like which is.
00:13:23.349 - 00:13:25.445, Speaker A: They just gonna keep it. That's kind of sick.
00:13:25.485 - 00:13:29.925, Speaker D: Yeah. So for them it's like free money. Right. It's just as you know and just.
00:13:29.965 - 00:13:31.749, Speaker C: Paid their budget criminals 10 years.
00:13:31.837 - 00:13:39.337, Speaker D: Yeah. Some criminal proceeds. Who cares if bitcoin even doubles from here? That like they're not a hedge fund. They don't care. This is all free money. So they're just going to sell it right away.
00:13:39.401 - 00:13:53.713, Speaker A: The US government holds 13 and a half billion 2, 210,000 Bitcoin. 213,000 Bitcoin rookie numbers. So hopefully, hopefully Trump says Trump pumps those up.
00:13:53.769 - 00:13:54.457, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:54.641 - 00:14:01.505, Speaker A: So they only 1% of the Bitcoin supply. Right. Yeah.
00:14:01.625 - 00:14:13.193, Speaker C: It's a good start. If you want to do something with a strategic, you know, reserve asset. Trump said something, you know, who knows what. What he's actually gonna do. But he did float. Float it in an interview.
00:14:13.329 - 00:14:15.609, Speaker A: So what did he say it was?
00:14:15.657 - 00:14:17.845, Speaker C: It was like a Forbes headline the other week.
00:14:19.185 - 00:14:28.593, Speaker A: That's definitely clickbait. There's no way he said it. We're considering it as, as a strategic reserve asset, I'm pretty sure. Incredible.
00:14:28.649 - 00:14:30.273, Speaker D: Yeah, I think he did. Yeah, he did.
00:14:30.329 - 00:14:36.089, Speaker C: Yeah. On July 3rd, Trump sparks talks of bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.
00:14:36.217 - 00:14:43.897, Speaker A: But what did he actually say? Oh, well that's like such. That's so stretched.
00:14:43.961 - 00:14:49.041, Speaker C: I would need to go on his truth social post and read it.
00:14:49.233 - 00:14:51.249, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm guessing that was stretch.
00:14:51.377 - 00:15:00.393, Speaker B: The other thing he's been saying, or I guess this is more of like a past 24 hours thing that Jamie Dimon is turning his. Changing his tune on bitcoin.
00:15:00.569 - 00:15:06.451, Speaker A: Yeah, well, because they're talking about him as anything secretary. Right.
00:15:06.643 - 00:15:08.571, Speaker C: Oh, here's. Here it is. Here it is.
00:15:08.603 - 00:15:09.787, Speaker A: That would be pretty cool.
00:15:09.931 - 00:15:28.455, Speaker C: Vote for Trump. Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against the cbdc. Biden's hatred of bitcoin only helps China, Russia and the radical communists left. We want all remaining bitcoin to be made in the usa. It will help us be energy dominant. And then there's a dot, dot, dot.
00:15:28.595 - 00:15:33.351, Speaker A: Yeah. So nothing, I guess you did you.
00:15:33.383 - 00:15:35.855, Speaker C: Can connect the dots, Duncan, you know.
00:15:35.895 - 00:15:50.919, Speaker D: Well, he's talked a lot about energy too. There's that interview that came out yesterday, the one where he went on about Coke versus Diet Coke. That was a fun ramble. But there's this whole. There's this whole energy thing too that he wants to incentivize a lot.
00:15:50.967 - 00:15:53.375, Speaker A: No, it's massively important. Right?
00:15:53.535 - 00:15:54.333, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:54.519 - 00:16:23.745, Speaker A: Like I feel like, well, Biden ran down the whole SPR during COVID Like I think I forget the numbers, but they ran down like I want to say at least like 70% of it. Yeah, 60 of it. And yeah, obviously I think the US is now like a net exporter of oil through shale. But if they want to keep inflation down and like us as its position in the world, they. They need cheap energy still. So.
00:16:24.285 - 00:16:26.265, Speaker D: So what are you bullish right now, Duncan?
00:16:26.565 - 00:16:50.155, Speaker A: What am I bullish right now? Yeah, I guess like bitcoin, Salana eth. The standard ones. Gold. Gold is hitting new all time high last week to like 2450 an ounce. Gold miners and some of the best altcoins in the market.
00:16:50.195 - 00:16:52.715, Speaker C: Didn't you post something on Galaxy on Twitter?
00:16:52.835 - 00:17:20.074, Speaker A: Oh, Galaxy, Galaxy, that's a good one. I forgot. Yeah. So Galaxy is Novograt's company. This is actually an interesting one to talk about. I think they're maybe at like, I want to say like four, four and a half billion US market cap and just like on their balance sheet alone I think they probably hold like two and a half billion worth of, of crypto and other investments. Plus they have kind of all these business arms where they do like a ton of trading.
00:17:20.074 - 00:17:31.970, Speaker A: They have like investment banking for like M and A within crypto. They are have like a venture business. They have a mining business. They have like this asset management business.
00:17:32.042 - 00:17:36.114, Speaker C: Is that one of their minor. Isn't their minor like mining like process.
00:17:36.194 - 00:17:40.614, Speaker D: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. New tweet. Trump to announce USA strategic reserve.
00:17:41.655 - 00:17:43.375, Speaker C: Is that. Actually this is a.
00:17:43.415 - 00:17:54.591, Speaker D: This is. I mean this is a bitcoin guy. Dennis Porter. Yeah, I don't know how much I believe this. He says Trump to announce a USA Bitcoin strategic reserve in Nashville. Sources.
00:17:54.703 - 00:17:55.355, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:57.575 - 00:17:58.615, Speaker B: Sounds good.
00:17:58.775 - 00:18:01.647, Speaker D: I don't know if I believe this. I don't think this retweet.
00:18:01.751 - 00:18:06.635, Speaker A: Let's check. Okay. The market isn't up. So that's, that's a lie.
00:18:10.175 - 00:18:22.927, Speaker C: I was going to say, isn't Galaxy's mining like mining rig and operation one of the, one of the better ones? I was reading about this the other day. That I think that their mining operation is one of the better in the U.S. yeah.
00:18:22.951 - 00:18:57.149, Speaker A: So they acquired Helios, which is this big miner in Texas, for like $65 million during, like the bear market, which is like, pretty cheap. And I think it's like 220 megawatt facility. And they're like, in the process of, I believe, upgrading it to like an 800 megawatt facility, which is like, on par with some of like the bigger miners, like in the same order of magnitude. I don't know exactly, but like with your marathon digitals, like clean spark, those. Those sort of players. So that's like an angle. They're basically touch everything crypto.
00:18:57.149 - 00:19:36.317, Speaker A: And they're also doing like, what Genesis did, so, like this kind of prime brokerage, so they have like the institutional arm. I think they just partnered with State street on like, trying to sell the ETFs or like, help them give their clients exposure to crypto. They have a bunch of trading, they have a ventures business. They hold a bunch of crypto on the balance sheet. You know, they're in charge of stuff like the FTX estate and it's listed. And why it's interesting is because, like, you know, it doesn't trade very expensive relative to like, the other Bitcoin miners or like Microstrategy or Coinbase. And it's only listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under glx.
00:19:36.317 - 00:20:22.241, Speaker A: Why? And obviously, like, they've been trying to get UP listed to the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange, but since, like, the SEC has been pretty unfriendly to crypto, they haven't been able to. But I think that that's like a massive, you know, that's like going from being listed on Kucoin to Binance if they. If they can secure the UP listing. So, like, that's an interesting way to play, you know, the Trump presidency because obviously that's. That regulation should open up. So, like, you know, if you like Coinbase, maybe take a look at Galaxy there, you know, maybe some of their businesses compete. But I would say Galaxy is more like focused on the institutional side, where Coinbase has like, a lot of retail offerings that Galaxy doesn't really compete in.
00:20:22.241 - 00:20:24.485, Speaker A: So that's a cool one. If you guys haven't.
00:20:24.985 - 00:20:28.205, Speaker C: No, I like that. Cool idea.
00:20:29.135 - 00:20:35.631, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, they're also like the biggest Solana validator. Like, they have so many things. Like, you just need to keep on, like, the rabbit hole's deep.
00:20:35.703 - 00:20:54.037, Speaker D: Yeah. I think that they're gonna start dropping everything. They're gonna Start dropping off Solana. What's cool, what's cool. What's going on in Salon is that all the apps are starting to overtake like other validator, like professional validators. So Helios Merch company, they just became number two. They passed Coinbase the other day.
00:20:54.037 - 00:21:21.393, Speaker D: Some of the other OG validators like Shinobi and Lane are dropping down because applications keep taking over. And so this is like a cool dynamic in Solana versus Ethereum is that the applications are running validators. Right. Because also Solana has this stake weighted quality of service now where the more stake you have, like the higher your inclusion probabilities. So apps are kind of. And like, you can debate if this is a good. It's probably.
00:21:21.393 - 00:21:36.275, Speaker D: It's not a great mechanism. That's just what they have for now. But you're seeing a lot of apps run validators. So I would say Galaxy is probably going to drop their validator size on Solana if I want to just fud your.
00:21:37.135 - 00:21:38.155, Speaker A: Wait, why?
00:21:38.495 - 00:21:51.847, Speaker D: Because more people are going to keep delegating to apps on Solana versus, I mean, Galaxy will keep whatever institutions I guess they have, but we'll see. I mean, Helia is passing. Coinbase is pretty cool, man, when you.
00:21:51.871 - 00:21:52.909, Speaker A: Really think about that.
00:21:53.007 - 00:21:53.265, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:53.305 - 00:21:55.561, Speaker A: Like, they didn't they just like start that.
00:21:55.673 - 00:22:05.085, Speaker D: Yeah. Not too long ago and they made the lst, which is another thing on Solana you have all these individual LSTs, which is a pretty cool dynamic.
00:22:06.225 - 00:22:09.457, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, definitely good for them. They.
00:22:09.561 - 00:22:51.785, Speaker C: So, I mean, a lot of stakes. I gotta. I got a kind of like a question for you guys about, you know, with ETH at the ETF coming up next week and obviously the question or the debate on on Twitter has been, you know, soul ETH pretty much all cycle. Right. So how do you. How do you guys kind of see Sole or like the dynamic between the two playing out once we get this etf? Like, initially, like, my thinking is right, like, given, like, I think it'll just. I think it'll be like bullish for Seoul also because I think like the next obvious thing you have to look forward to is the sole ETF after, like after this, like six months ago, that probably wouldn't be the case.
00:22:51.785 - 00:22:55.353, Speaker C: Like, I don't even. Like six months ago, nobody thought we'd have an ETH ETF this year, right?
00:22:55.449 - 00:22:55.913, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:56.009 - 00:23:36.629, Speaker C: So a lot has changed and like, I think that's like kind of a reason why like ETH didn't really perform as expected compared to Bitcoin, like in the run up to the Bitcoin etf, because I don't think people were like, immediately speculating that the ETH ETF would come anytime soon. Right. Like, it was kind of like, well, there's no real good narrative here. It's like, like the, like, you know, fragmentated liquidity. Like there's all these things that people talked about ad nauseam. And then I think, like, the big thing is like, in January when the Bitcoin ETF launched, I was under the impression, I think most people were, that the ETF wouldn't come until maybe early 2025. So like, you know, that's like a ton of time to speculate on, like, oh, etf.
00:23:36.629 - 00:24:04.785, Speaker C: So like, you know, it kind of continues to underperform Eth BTC or so. Like, I think, I don't really think that's the case now. Right. Like, I think with the regulatory shift and like, with Trump leading as, as, as much as he is, I think like the next obvious thing to think about once this is like approved and launching and trading is a sole etf. So I'm not like, I don't have a super strong opinion and I'm trying to form one here. It's like, what do you guys think?
00:24:04.865 - 00:24:25.371, Speaker D: So for me, the, the, the ETH is like the only reason I've been like, bullish on ETH recently, because nothing else is making me bullish on eth really. But you can't like, deny the flows and everything. And so if we're talking like next six months, whatever, I don't know, it depends how these flows go.
00:24:25.563 - 00:24:41.025, Speaker C: Okay, so the, I think Bloomberg boys said 10% of Bitcoin or 10% of what we saw with bitcoin flows is what they're expecting for E flows. So if we've had like 20 billion of net flows through seven months of the year, that would be about, I guess, what, 2 billion for eth?
00:24:41.145 - 00:25:01.931, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess the thing for me is, like, I just expect Solana's metrics are just going to keep growing faster than Ethereum's. They're going to keep getting more developers. It's the biggest problem in Ethereum for a new developer is like, where do you deploy? You have no idea. You have too many options. It's too confusing. And then like, oh, you can make your own app chain. It's like, hey, nobody's going to go there.
00:25:01.931 - 00:25:36.161, Speaker D: There's no liquidity there. And so I think for new developers coming in, it's like a very simple decision. Solana has all this liquidity now. They have A lot of users there, you know, and Solana is going to start doing like L2s, app chains, all this stuff, but they're going to look a lot differently. Because if you're a developer who's like learning us, you like Solana virtual Machine, you'll always have the option to deploy on L1. Right. So if you want shared state, you just go deploy on L1 and you can have the shared state.
00:25:36.161 - 00:26:15.255, Speaker D: And then if you want like app specific because you don't want to share block space with anyone, then go make an L2. Right. And if you're Ethereum dev, you don't have that. That's not the decision you're making because all these L2s are essentially creating their own general purpose, like shared state. And so it's like, do I want arbitrums shared state? Do I want optimism? Do I want base, Do I want blast? And I also just don't see L2S as scaling Ethereum. I've just fundamentally always kind of disagreed with this narrative and I think other people are coming around to this too. Which is why you see all this based roll up talk recently.
00:26:16.435 - 00:26:27.275, Speaker A: Yeah. So can you expand upon why you think the LTS on Solana will be better for Solana than the LTS on Ethereum will be better than like, you know, that compare and contrast.
00:26:27.355 - 00:26:37.339, Speaker D: I don't know if they'll be better for, they'll be better for the, like the apps. If you, if you make an app specific roll up, you should accrue most of that value to your application, right?
00:26:37.387 - 00:26:38.067, Speaker C: Yes.
00:26:38.251 - 00:27:20.383, Speaker D: I think my point is that a lot of apps will just launch on the L1 because they'll always have that option which is good for Solana. And then they can even either launch like an isolated L2 that rolls to Solana. I mean, they could also, they could also just use Solana as, as like based roll ups. Because Salon is like the, the number one thing you need for base roll ups is like super fast block times, which is why they're kind of like infeasible in Ethereum. And that's why like right Now Ethereum has 12 second block times. There's all this talk recently about shortening Ethereum block times a lot and getting single slot finality so they can do all these base roll ups. And so Salon is already a good shared sequencer.
00:27:20.383 - 00:27:45.161, Speaker D: And I mean there's this protocol, roam protocol that just raised 9 mil who's using salon as like shared sequencer. And so they'll have that, they'll have that option there. I just think that, I just think Solana needs, Solana Eco really needs to take this opportunity because I mean I was at ECC and Modular this week and my main takeaway is that nothing's happened for a year.
00:27:45.273 - 00:27:46.245, Speaker A: Like I need.
00:27:46.545 - 00:28:40.165, Speaker D: Yeah, nothing's happened. It's. It's basically research has progressed a year. That's what it is. All the talks, like last year there was a lot of excitement and you know, went to all these side events and like people were talking about lvr, people were talking about APP sequencing, app contract sequence, like app chain versus app contract, talking about, you know, sovereign roll ups, talking about CK stuff and you know, that's the same thing everyone was talking about. I kind of got a bit of deja vu there. And that's just the reality, I guess, that these things take time and so like Ethereum will get to the end state it wants to get to, but there is this time effect, right where this is kind of the moment for Solana to really step on the.
00:28:40.165 - 00:29:21.515, Speaker D: I think that the biggest risk to Solana is I guess they get complacent, right? But there's, there's just for. To me there's such a massive opportunity here to just keep accelerating over the next couple years. Like even, even Celestia, the Mustafa had this presentation. He was like 2021, these were all the modular projects and there was a very small amount, right? And then it was 2022, here's, here's the modularity and it was a pretty big increase. And then it was 2023 and it was an even bigger increase. And then 2024, it was like the same as 2023. You know, same team, same projects, same discussions mostly.
00:29:21.515 - 00:29:38.115, Speaker D: I think the biggest, the newest change I guess is people are taking TE seriously. So like trusted execution environments for privacy and stuff. That's, that's kind of the big takeaway I got is that those are going to start to be used a lot.
00:29:38.275 - 00:29:53.735, Speaker A: So if we had to more for the normies, non technical people, if we, if you had to say your outlook on like Solana scaling over the next year versus Ethereum scaling over the next year, what would you say?
00:29:54.075 - 00:30:01.905, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, Solana Fire Dancer should be live. Fire Dancer built their first block like a week or two ago. Pretty cool.
00:30:03.285 - 00:30:07.825, Speaker A: So how big of a efficiency or scalability improvement is Fire to answer?
00:30:08.805 - 00:30:19.965, Speaker D: You can't really put exact numbers on it in a local test environment, only doing the most basic of transactions. They can hit like a mill. That's not something you're going to see in production.
00:30:20.085 - 00:30:24.749, Speaker A: And how many is like current Salana does.
00:30:24.877 - 00:30:32.591, Speaker D: Solana does like what, 3,000. And the thing about Salana TPS too is that it's basically demand based up to like a limit.
00:30:32.703 - 00:30:36.295, Speaker A: So you're talking about like one or maybe two orders of magnitude.
00:30:36.415 - 00:30:53.743, Speaker D: I could. Yeah, like if ever like everybody running Fire Dancer and there's you know, obviously there's like a lot of bugs that can happen. There's a lot of like path dependency and a lot of risks. But I, I think, I think most people would be expecting like an order of magnitude increase.
00:30:53.839 - 00:30:59.532, Speaker A: Oh yeah, that's into 3,000 to 15,000 or 30,000.
00:30:59.633 - 00:31:08.395, Speaker D: Yeah, like, I mean like 10k plus I think is what people are expecting if everyone's running it.
00:31:09.255 - 00:31:10.303, Speaker A: Okay, lots ahead.
00:31:10.359 - 00:31:13.255, Speaker B: And how quickly would the adoption cycle?
00:31:13.335 - 00:31:36.803, Speaker D: Oh, I think pretty quick because it's going to be hard to be a validator without running Fire Dancer if everyone else is so much faster than you. But like there's other stuff too. There's a validator client on Solana that's working on just, just like on home hardware being able to run a full node basically. I don't really know how feasible it is in their progress but like that's, that's pretty cool too.
00:31:36.899 - 00:31:40.867, Speaker A: And what about the ZK stuff that like Mer was talking about like the.
00:31:40.931 - 00:32:01.455, Speaker D: ZK, it's kind of like what they do with NFTs. So they have compressed NFTs on Salana where they just post like Merkel root on chain that proves the off chain data and so then our PCs feed the data to the chain and you can do the same stuff with tokens and other things.
00:32:02.075 - 00:32:04.587, Speaker A: So that could increase scalability more.
00:32:04.691 - 00:32:06.371, Speaker D: Well, you can just get more stuff going on.
00:32:06.403 - 00:32:19.295, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. So you think in a year Salonic going to have maybe 10 to 30,000 TPS in that ballpark. I don't want to hold it to you.
00:32:19.995 - 00:32:24.405, Speaker D: Is this a poly market? 50. 50. 50. Yeah. I'll take the yes on that. I'll take the.
00:32:24.825 - 00:32:30.193, Speaker A: And then what? Where's he's gonna look in a year in terms of scaling? Like not much different. Right.
00:32:30.289 - 00:32:57.863, Speaker D: ETH will be like I would imagine Base is doing a lot. I, I don't know what's going on with optimism L1 it feels like base just kind of took all that over Arbitrom. You know, there's just, there's just a lot of random chains in eth. Right. So maybe there's some killer app that launches. That would be nice. Maybe we get some killer App that has its own chain and everyone's using that, right?
00:32:57.959 - 00:33:02.115, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be cool. Hyperliquid could be it. Hyperliquid is pretty popular.
00:33:02.615 - 00:33:07.195, Speaker D: Maybe that's just like a centralized exchange though. No, Aren't they like one node or something?
00:33:07.855 - 00:33:08.727, Speaker A: For now.
00:33:08.871 - 00:33:11.975, Speaker C: For now, bro, chill, relax. Stop flooding.
00:33:12.055 - 00:33:14.271, Speaker B: I actually don't flood their purr bags.
00:33:14.423 - 00:33:17.463, Speaker D: Listen, I'm not a hater. I'm not a hater, but going back.
00:33:17.479 - 00:33:18.567, Speaker A: To the soul eat story stuff.
00:33:18.591 - 00:33:19.103, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:33:19.159 - 00:33:45.119, Speaker A: I feel like SOL at 1 5th or 1/6 of each market cap, even with the ETF and like it sounds like just so much of like the new marginal users. So many of the new marginal users are going to Solana versus Ethereum. And you know, Ethereum still has like a lot of the capital there, a lot of the stable coins there, a lot of like the trust there. But it definitely seems like the, the new entrance or new capital is kind of more skewed towards Solana.
00:33:45.207 - 00:34:13.325, Speaker D: But the thing is like, even if, let's say one of these roles. Sorry, let me just make this one point. Like even if one of these new roll ups, let's say Mega Eth, they figured out, I mean Mega ETH is going like the most extreme centralized. We're beefing the fuck out of this one sequencer and we're making this centralized as possible and we're just going for it. Max performance. Right. And I don't know what they're using for da because they can't use eth.
00:34:13.325 - 00:34:35.061, Speaker D: They probably can't use Celestia. They're going to have to figure that part out because they're still gonna be bottlenecked. But let's say they're like really successful, get a lot of users and everything. I still don't know like how bullish that is for eth. Like why, like everything is sequenced by Mega Eth sequencer. Like I think the thing we've realized over the last year or two is that all the money is in sequencing.
00:34:35.173 - 00:34:38.453, Speaker A: For the most part, like 96 ordering transactions.
00:34:38.549 - 00:34:46.215, Speaker D: Yeah. And so who. Those who order the transaction. That's why L2 tokens could theoretically be bullish. But the problem is that they're just used for grants these days. Days. And so.
00:34:46.255 - 00:35:06.471, Speaker B: And they're just way too big relative. If you like, it'd be bullish. The reason you get bullish them is for fundamental reasons. But then if you start trying to do fundamental valuation on any of them, you're like, all right, this doesn't make sense. So that's why I think, you know, the whole value prop of the other stuff is just increasing the, the moneyness of eth. Right. ETH is still used as the collateral and all this stuff.
00:35:06.471 - 00:35:49.473, Speaker B: And, and so I think it's, it's honestly like what you lose in, in gas demand you gain in quote unquote moneyness and, and store value kind of capacity is the argument, I think. Yeah, like the whole soul versus E thing, it probably just depends on, on how cute you want to get with the trade. You know, if you're looking a year from now, I have. I think it's harder to make the argument that ETH outperforms. So if you're, if you're thinking on like that level of time horizon purely returns basis, I think SOL makes more sense on like a risk adjusted basis. I don't know, they probably have similar degrees of risk. So I don't think that changes the calculus there.
00:35:49.473 - 00:36:49.085, Speaker B: On a shorter time horizon, what do you have going for eth? Obviously like the flows from the etf and it's also, it's kind of the more institutionalized asset where you know, like BlackRock's doing all their stuff on ETH and so the narrative is stronger there for like the more polished underlying chain. Whereas Seoul is, I'd say attracting more of the new user cohort, but is still more of a degen chain. But I think with an ETF that narrative can shift. So it's more just priced in now in terms of penalizing sole price, I think to that degree. But yeah, I'm in a similar camp where I think so outperforms longer time horizon. I think you could see an opportunity for ETH to outperform on a shorter time horizon. But that window closes with the, the odds of.
00:36:49.085 - 00:37:15.501, Speaker B: Because the odds of a SOL ETF are so much higher now. Right. Previously it was, it's just gonna outperform because the SOL ETF was so far out it can't really be priced in. And the probability of a SOL ETF was so low that it can't really be priced in. But now with everything kind of happening that, that, that, that gets priced in a lot earlier. And so I think there's like, there's going to be a window where ETH out performs but I think if you zoom out like over a year, it's, it's harder to see ETH outperform Seoul.
00:37:15.693 - 00:37:16.505, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:17.885 - 00:37:46.819, Speaker D: Do you think everyone's excited that ETH is getting this etf because yay, now we have institutional investors, we've got the boomers to buy Our bags, all this stuff. Do you think they are going to. And at the same time it's like, what's the narrative For Ethan, it's this tech platform and everything. Do you think they're going to underwrite it as money or they are going to look at it on like a fundamental basis? Right. And I just don't see them looking at it as like a money thing. Like they look at bitcoin. I just think they're fundamentally different parts.
00:37:46.819 - 00:38:01.989, Speaker D: For me. I've always viewed. I've always viewed crypto as bitcoin and everything else. It's like they both. Yeah, they all show on the coin market cap and there's some similarities in the tech and everything, but they are kind of like fundamentally different. I don't know, maybe bitcoin is becoming a DA layer now.
00:38:02.037 - 00:38:35.025, Speaker A: So it's changing, I think, where ETH could maybe get a narrative. And I still don't know if this outperforms Soul over time. I think Soul will probably outperform over a longer time period. That's what seems to be coming more of an inevitability as you look in the future, at least in the next one or two years. But I definitely think ETH has some potential on the narratives of like more stable coins launching on them. Like it didn't. State street just mentioned something about a stable coin.
00:38:35.025 - 00:38:49.017, Speaker A: You have like State Tree talking about a stable coin. Vaneck, like Vanek Sons doing Agora to compete with. Yeah, but it's like so these rwas. But those are. Yeah, like I said, I understand long term that.
00:38:49.081 - 00:39:05.861, Speaker D: No, no, no, no. That's not even the point I'm making. That's not even the point I'm making. I'm like, even if these guys launch these things on eth L1, okay, but then to actually use them, you're probably going to like bridge them to L2s. And then like what is that? Where. What's that doing? What's that giving back to Eth?
00:39:05.973 - 00:39:08.237, Speaker A: Just like a lot of capital on the chain.
00:39:08.341 - 00:39:18.245, Speaker B: The argument is like, what do you base the fundamental value of ETH on? Is it purely based on fees or do you. Do you factor in TVL and users and all of that?
00:39:18.285 - 00:39:18.459, Speaker C: Because.
00:39:18.497 - 00:39:24.847, Speaker B: Because those other things do contribute to all of the fundamental variables that aren't burn.
00:39:24.951 - 00:39:56.711, Speaker A: And fees will definitely go up. Like, you know, so you have the stablecoins and maybe like the RWA stuff that BlackRock has that like build fund which is like 500 million on. On it. And like the fees will go up on L1 and you will get that kind of reflective cycle getting kicked off. But eventually, yeah, you run into the problem. At the end of the day, it's like you either push these users to L2, which kind of cannibalizes some fees from the L1, or you push them to Solana because it's just not scalable yet.
00:39:56.823 - 00:40:14.093, Speaker D: Yeah. One thing I'll say is that Ethereum core devs are actually looking at the execution side of stuff and there's a lot of proposals on that. And so that's pretty bullish, I guess, because they've never really thought about that before.
00:40:14.229 - 00:40:15.949, Speaker A: What do you mean by the execution?
00:40:15.997 - 00:40:39.573, Speaker D: Well, like all, all the Ethereum upgrades are always around like consensus changes and so now it's like, oh, how do we actually scale execution? How do we make like EVM more performance, stuff like that. And so that's finally. Yeah, like that's what I mean. Right. Listen, Ethereum is always going to be. This Ethereum has some very useful properties. Right.
00:40:39.573 - 00:40:46.705, Speaker D: I think a lot of the bullcase for Ethereum though is more so like qualitative than quantitative, right?
00:40:47.405 - 00:40:51.461, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's kind of like the stuff that Gabe talks about, right?
00:40:51.493 - 00:41:05.965, Speaker D: That's Gate. Gabe's whole bull case on Ethereum is around qualitative things. Right. It's like the censorship resistance. I don't know, what else does he say? That's like the main thing. That's like the main thing.
00:41:06.585 - 00:41:09.365, Speaker A: Jason, what are the charts telling us?
00:41:10.185 - 00:41:12.225, Speaker C: I mean, what for Soul Eth?
00:41:12.305 - 00:41:14.041, Speaker A: It's in the charts. What are they?
00:41:14.113 - 00:41:39.635, Speaker C: Everything's in the charts. Obviously. The German selling Trump, Trump getting nicked. It was in the charts. Dude, you didn't buy the lows. I don't know for, like I said, I, I don't really have a strong opinion. I was kind of thinking about it from the perspective of the number that the Bloomberg guys gave for ETH flows.
00:41:39.635 - 00:42:22.925, Speaker C: We're expecting 10% of Bitcoin's flows to be the numbers for the ETH products. Right. Which isn't really that much money, but I guess you don't really need that much money to move an asset. And I think a big difference is we had a huge run up into the Bitcoin ETF approval and then another huge run up after it. Eth is, I mean, I guess it's up now a little bit after the, the, like that, that tweet a couple weeks ago, the God Candle tweet, where it was up like 20 or whatever. But like, I don't, I think, I think I think ETH outperforming in the immediate term makes a lot of sense. Although for me it's more of a decision of like.
00:42:22.925 - 00:42:32.475, Speaker C: Like I have bitcoin, like a lot of bitcoin spot positions and, and like for me to allocate to eth, I would have to sell one of those.
00:42:32.635 - 00:42:34.495, Speaker B: Coin margin perps, bruh.
00:42:35.115 - 00:42:57.347, Speaker C: If I'm not going into, you know, if I'm not gonna. Which is what I'm probably gonna end up doing. Right. So for me, like, I just don't, like, I don't have a strong enough opinion on eats outperformance over any like me, like meaningful time frame that would like make me as like an allocator of my spot bag sell out of BTC or Seoul.
00:42:57.491 - 00:43:03.455, Speaker A: I. I agree. That makes sense. I just checked the chart, the sole chart. It looks, looks good.
00:43:04.275 - 00:43:06.527, Speaker C: So that's why 0.1.
00:43:06.619 - 00:43:13.255, Speaker A: In private, Cedric's targets 0.1. He won't say that at all, but I'll say it. So I was going higher.
00:43:13.875 - 00:43:37.213, Speaker C: So. Yeah, I don't know. It's just tough for me to like, you know, sell a spot like if I'm just building out positions like that. So like the way that I'm planning on playing it is probably like what, what Jan said, just either through perps, like once we. Once we get the approval and we start pumping and just kind of play it like that. But like I don't see a very strong argument for selling out of the other two positions, which is where the allocation would have to come from.
00:43:37.349 - 00:43:53.035, Speaker A: This is why Banana Gun's such a great play. You got your, your ETH trading fee exposure. You know, they're launching their new Solana product. It's just the best of both worlds. It's a small market cap on the relative basis, you know, got some high beta.
00:43:53.455 - 00:43:58.595, Speaker B: Yeah. In terms of ETH beta, I think that's been a big widow maker trade.
00:43:58.975 - 00:44:00.675, Speaker A: Except for banana guy.
00:44:01.015 - 00:44:05.911, Speaker B: I mean right now it's been maker and, and you know, maker's been pretty good.
00:44:05.943 - 00:44:06.431, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's.
00:44:06.463 - 00:44:06.607, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:06.631 - 00:44:47.129, Speaker B: Makers from trading. Well, I think you got a decent situation where Rune has, has bought back a lot. Like there's been a good kind of shuffling of coins over time into decently stronger hands. So I think you have that and then the whole idea of there's going to be a bunch of catalysts, but kind of without any specific timelines, just, you know, randomly scattered throughout the year. Yeah, it's kind of nuts that they haven't really provided much in terms of Concrete deadlines. But I guess it's probably for the better sometimes. Yeah, that's been one of the few that's.
00:44:47.129 - 00:45:01.929, Speaker B: That's kind of done well but. But ETH beta chasing in general has been a pretty tough trade. If you try. If you chart a lot of these against the broadly outperformed aside from like a few windows where. Which are very difficult to time banana.
00:45:01.977 - 00:45:05.601, Speaker A: Against that all time high in US dollars and yeah, but if you're trying.
00:45:05.633 - 00:45:09.229, Speaker B: To take a bigger swing, it's not as feasible. It's like.
00:45:09.277 - 00:45:18.597, Speaker A: I know but for most people it is feasible. Unless you're like running a fund. Even if you're running a fund you can buy some. But yeah, anyways obviously have banana.
00:45:18.661 - 00:45:25.773, Speaker C: I fund did buy banana recently or a couple weeks ago. Right. I forget who. Who it was but they announced. I was announced on Twitter.
00:45:25.829 - 00:45:27.965, Speaker A: I'm messaging everyone possible to get.
00:45:28.005 - 00:45:37.399, Speaker C: I know you are like one thing that I was looking at and like. Duncan, does anybody know anything like about ENS and why the chart looks so good?
00:45:37.597 - 00:45:40.259, Speaker A: I actually have like a good business model, I think.
00:45:40.307 - 00:45:41.771, Speaker C: I mean I don't really.
00:45:41.923 - 00:45:43.675, Speaker B: You can charge a lot for vanity plates.
00:45:43.715 - 00:46:00.099, Speaker C: You know that's what I'm saying. Right. Like, I don't know when you talk about like looking at the charts. Duncan. Right. Like there is something to be said for coins that trade stronger within like an ecosystem than its peers or like you know, comparable things. So like I don't know, it's just something I've been watching over the last couple.
00:46:00.099 - 00:46:18.987, Speaker C: Couple of months and I'm just like, you know this like it's trading better than eth. It's trading better than most things in ETH land and like I don't know, maybe there's. There's something there. I just haven't really looked at the business or like anything really about like why it might be. But if you look at it looks real good.
00:46:19.091 - 00:46:22.827, Speaker A: We'll have to. We'll have to get back on that one. Setter Jiminy Takes nes.
00:46:23.011 - 00:46:31.363, Speaker D: I've never been interested in like the product, but a lot of people are so I don't know. I don't know enough to have a comment on the token.
00:46:31.499 - 00:46:32.259, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:46:32.387 - 00:46:39.195, Speaker D: I don't know why you'd want to like tie the vanity to your personal address, but I don't know.
00:46:39.235 - 00:46:39.947, Speaker B: I mean it depends.
00:46:39.971 - 00:46:41.091, Speaker C: It could be anonymous too.
00:46:41.123 - 00:46:42.371, Speaker D: So. Yeah, well there's.
00:46:42.443 - 00:46:53.539, Speaker B: I mean you also have like there's reason to have a public address. Right. If you're, if you're doing like your NFT Collection. The business and yeah, I mean people.
00:46:53.587 - 00:46:59.335, Speaker C: Will always, always buy stupid like that. That's like a thing that's been proven across like decades.
00:47:00.005 - 00:47:03.341, Speaker A: Who's building ENS for Solana? Is there Solana?
00:47:03.493 - 00:47:08.945, Speaker D: They have. They've had them. But it's like, I don't know. Bona fide I think was what it was called.
00:47:09.405 - 00:47:15.105, Speaker A: That thing got torched. Aren't they doing a bunch of stuff?
00:47:19.285 - 00:47:21.265, Speaker C: Does it even show up anymore?
00:47:21.765 - 00:47:22.381, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:47:22.413 - 00:47:22.605, Speaker C: But.
00:47:22.645 - 00:47:32.936, Speaker A: Oh yeah, I hear about like. I just remember this is a 21 coin. Oh, let's not. Let's check all time high down 98.6%.
00:47:33.053 - 00:47:37.791, Speaker D: What's the market cap? 40 million. It's still. Wow.
00:47:37.903 - 00:47:41.235, Speaker A: I would have guessed like fully diluted is 300 million.
00:47:41.575 - 00:47:42.239, Speaker D: Wow.
00:47:42.367 - 00:47:57.231, Speaker A: This thing got absolutely. This thing is trading at like $10. It's at 27 cents. So at $10 it would have been 10 billion. This is a sneak peek on what some of these low float high FPV coins are going to be trading look.
00:47:57.263 - 00:47:58.755, Speaker C: Like in a year and a half.
00:47:59.485 - 00:48:14.533, Speaker A: You know we've been warning about that for a while, but still. Yeah. Be careful with those unless you know what you're doing. Go pull up the bonafide chart ticker Fida. That's a little sneak peek. Unfortunately. I think that was like.
00:48:14.533 - 00:48:18.381, Speaker A: That was like an early soul, like SPF eco type type thing.
00:48:18.453 - 00:48:22.225, Speaker C: Yeah, it was. It was like that serum were the early ones.
00:48:22.605 - 00:48:30.855, Speaker A: They even have a Binance listing anyways. That's a tough chart. Could be a value by now.
00:48:32.155 - 00:48:40.995, Speaker C: 300 mil FDV value buy. So yeah, I, I think I agree though with Ceteris. I think, I think. I mean I'll.
00:48:41.035 - 00:48:41.315, Speaker D: I'll.
00:48:41.355 - 00:48:52.267, Speaker C: I'll actually like make like a. A guess. Like I think end of the year, like December 31st, I think Solit will probably be around like 0.055 or 0.06.
00:48:52.451 - 00:48:54.963, Speaker A: That's the same as what it is now, isn't it?
00:48:55.019 - 00:48:57.320, Speaker C: No, it's like 0 4.04546.
00:48:57.501 - 00:49:01.291, Speaker A: I see a 20% move.
00:49:01.323 - 00:49:02.699, Speaker C: Jason, that would be at what sort.
00:49:02.707 - 00:49:05.227, Speaker A: Of highs for the prediction is that.
00:49:05.291 - 00:49:07.655, Speaker C: That would be high for the cycle.
00:49:08.275 - 00:49:24.955, Speaker D: The thing about Soleaf is like off the bottom it's like 4 or 5x right. And so now you're looking at. I mean probably it's like you're looking at. Is there like a 2x left in it? Right. So it's different. It's like a different mindset than it was. Like souls run a lot right?
00:49:25.535 - 00:49:27.039, Speaker C: So yeah, like point zero. Yeah.
00:49:27.127 - 00:49:33.855, Speaker B: We're doing solely relative. Yeah. We're talking 2x in relative terms. Right. In absolute. There's still.
00:49:33.975 - 00:49:37.647, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, you still expect. I mean, we're all like permeables, right?
00:49:37.791 - 00:49:38.327, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:38.431 - 00:49:42.375, Speaker D: Oh, no. I feel like 6K. 500. That's nice. Right. I could get.
00:49:42.415 - 00:49:43.675, Speaker C: Those are good numbers.
00:49:44.255 - 00:49:45.475, Speaker D: That's my goal.
00:49:48.335 - 00:49:48.825, Speaker A: Big flash.
00:49:48.855 - 00:49:50.385, Speaker B: Close to get 6K.
00:49:51.405 - 00:49:58.861, Speaker D: Yeah. That's the thing. Right. Well, I don't know. What would BTC be in that scenario? Like115,120 if it was Egypt?
00:49:58.933 - 00:49:59.885, Speaker A: Bitcoin reserve.
00:49:59.925 - 00:50:00.545, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:01.165 - 00:50:03.701, Speaker B: There's more. More catalysts for BTC at this point.
00:50:03.733 - 00:50:05.749, Speaker C: I feel like that's why I'm saying.
00:50:05.877 - 00:50:13.941, Speaker D: Well, if BTC goes to 120, BTC goes to 5. That's down a little bit. Then you get your 6K. Right. That's like kind of reasonable.
00:50:14.093 - 00:50:14.613, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:14.709 - 00:50:23.609, Speaker B: But what would take BTC to 120, I think would cause there to be a. It'd be lower than 0.05.
00:50:23.777 - 00:50:25.489, Speaker A: Imagine that's true.
00:50:25.577 - 00:50:26.625, Speaker D: I get what you're saying. Yeah.
00:50:26.665 - 00:50:31.969, Speaker C: So you'd say like, like a banking crisis or something happens. Everybody just swarms. Bitcoin ETFs.
00:50:32.017 - 00:50:34.681, Speaker B: No more like strategic reserve conversations.
00:50:34.753 - 00:50:37.245, Speaker C: Or then everybody just focused on btc.
00:50:37.785 - 00:50:39.605, Speaker A: Just a mere double.
00:50:41.265 - 00:50:46.947, Speaker D: I mean, no, you can make the case that. Listen, I'm not as much of a need there, but like.
00:50:47.091 - 00:50:48.835, Speaker A: Yeah, by the end of the year. Let's talk.
00:50:48.875 - 00:51:02.731, Speaker D: Like, I'm not this much of a neat there, but I mean, you can't make the case that ETH is still like overvalued against BTC by a lot if like BTC really becomes this like type of asset. So just.
00:51:02.883 - 00:51:09.497, Speaker A: Wow. So soul 500 eth. 5000. Banana.
00:51:09.700 - 00:51:10.511, Speaker C: What?
00:51:10.714 - 00:51:17.001, Speaker A: Hi. I'm thinking 500 as well. Banana Soul parody.
00:51:17.193 - 00:51:18.965, Speaker C: Banana soul parody.
00:51:19.865 - 00:51:21.485, Speaker A: That's the trade I'm playing.
00:51:22.305 - 00:51:26.045, Speaker D: So is there anything else you want to talk about? I feel like that's kind of it. It's.
00:51:26.545 - 00:51:27.025, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:27.105 - 00:51:30.825, Speaker D: I mean, rate cuts. Rate cuts look like they're coming now, right? September. So.
00:51:30.905 - 00:51:37.015, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, September's like 95. They think is what like the Fed watch tool has.
00:51:37.315 - 00:51:38.219, Speaker A: Wow, that's hot.
00:51:38.267 - 00:51:50.135, Speaker C: And in December it has. It's like. I think it's like a 60 chance of 2 by December. By the December meeting or at the December meeting might be different now. I checked like a couple days ago.
00:51:50.595 - 00:51:52.295, Speaker A: That should be good for gold.
00:51:55.475 - 00:52:16.505, Speaker C: Yeah, probably good for gold. Yeah. So 18 December, 18 December, there's a 55. They're saying 55. That there will be 50 basis point cuts or two cuts by December. And some are even. It's starting to even price in three rate cuts now potentially, but that's still quite low.
00:52:16.505 - 00:52:24.077, Speaker C: So. Yeah, seems like two is pretty locked in now for between now and the end of the year.
00:52:24.221 - 00:52:33.185, Speaker D: Dude, how much. I'm changing the topic here. How much do you think Pump Fun is made in its lifetime fees? Because I just saw a tweet.
00:52:34.285 - 00:52:39.109, Speaker A: Okay, so, like, I making probably a million a day for six months, so.
00:52:39.277 - 00:52:40.465, Speaker D: Six months?
00:52:40.805 - 00:52:42.749, Speaker A: Yeah. For six months, yeah.
00:52:42.797 - 00:52:46.873, Speaker D: Anyways, they made 60 mil. It's just like. That's crazy, man.
00:52:46.958 - 00:52:47.341, Speaker A: 500.
00:52:47.453 - 00:52:51.469, Speaker D: Yeah, those guys, like, those guys should never launch a token 60 mil.
00:52:51.517 - 00:52:55.675, Speaker A: That's pretty good. Good for them. That's a lot.
00:52:56.175 - 00:52:58.063, Speaker C: And by the way, gold's a product market.
00:52:58.119 - 00:53:05.715, Speaker A: Gold's up 20% this year, so, you know, putting in some pretty big moves. How much is bitcoin up this year?
00:53:06.135 - 00:53:08.585, Speaker C: Yeah, more than that. I think 50.
00:53:08.661 - 00:53:10.122, Speaker A: I would hope so.
00:53:10.199 - 00:53:12.814, Speaker C: I think it's up like 50 or.
00:53:12.890 - 00:53:24.105, Speaker A: Maybe a little less 40. I'm doing. I'm doing the maths. It's up 50, but, you know, that's not bad for. That's not bad for gold.
00:53:24.265 - 00:53:25.513, Speaker C: For analog gold.
00:53:25.569 - 00:53:29.617, Speaker B: For analog bitcoin, that's not bad.
00:53:29.761 - 00:53:30.965, Speaker A: It's coming along.
00:53:32.945 - 00:53:47.635, Speaker C: No, I think gold is really good. And I'm honestly, I am kind of annoyed that I didn't put on gold positions like when we were talking about or when you were shilling it for, like, months and months and months. But it is what it is.
00:53:47.935 - 00:54:02.035, Speaker A: The thing. The reason I like gold is just because the central banks own gold. They don't own bitcoin yet until the strategic reserves announced. I feel like that's the one thing gold will have on bitcoin.
00:54:02.535 - 00:54:29.759, Speaker D: I feel like we should wrap this up. The one thing I'll say is there's that big India hack, India exchange hack today, which seems pretty bad. So how much got stolen? Like 300. But also, also India is, like, very hostile and this is going to be used as, like, another reason to, like, fully ban it. That's what people are kind of so pouring out for our Indian brethren. Hopefully it turns out not too bad there.
00:54:29.927 - 00:54:30.675, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:32.535 - 00:54:36.655, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I think we don't. I don't think we have anything else to talk about at this point. Right.
00:54:36.775 - 00:54:38.681, Speaker C: We will next time. Right.
00:54:38.823 - 00:54:39.957, Speaker A: Goodbye, everyone.
