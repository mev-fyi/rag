00:00:01.520 - 00:00:18.566, Speaker A: I just don't think it's going to be May. I mean, like, I just think it's like. It's like, a political thing. Like, I think that, like, there's still, like, all of that going on. It's like an election year. Maybe they're going to make a big deal of, like, staking or saying it's, like, not the same as bitcoin's ETF. Their arguments don't have to be rational, obviously.
00:00:18.566 - 00:00:24.334, Speaker A: Right? Like, they can just make some shit up, and then it's, like, on somebody to either sue them or appeal or whatever.
00:00:24.494 - 00:00:42.066, Speaker B: He barely made it right. It has. Like, it needed Gensler as a tie breaking vote, so it's just hard to believe he's gonna get behind this. Yeah, I think you probably need a Trump presidency. Well, Gensler's probably out either way, but you probably need a Trump presidency where you get a bigger overhaul of some of the three letter agencies, and I'm.
00:00:42.090 - 00:00:47.794, Speaker A: Like, 70% not happening. This year is, like, my base case.
00:00:47.954 - 00:00:50.674, Speaker B: The pretty ideal catalyst for selling May and go away.
