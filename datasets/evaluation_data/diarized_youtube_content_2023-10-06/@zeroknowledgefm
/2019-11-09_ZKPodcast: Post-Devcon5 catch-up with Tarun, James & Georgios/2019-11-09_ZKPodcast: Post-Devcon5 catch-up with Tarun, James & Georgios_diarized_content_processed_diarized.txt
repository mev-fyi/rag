00:00:10.010 - 00:01:19.138, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge, a podcast where we explore the latest in blockchain technology and the decentralized web. The show is hosted by me, Anna and me Frederick. In this week's episode, I catch up with Giorgios Constantopoulos, James Prestwich, and Tarun Shitra. We talk about their takeaways from Devcon five, what's on their mind, and how they feel about the explosion in zero knowledge research. Before we start, we want to say thank you to this week's sponsor, Trail of Bits. Trail of Bits recently shared their review of this year's IACR Crypto conference on the Trail of Bits blog. They highlighted some of the major themes of the conference, including the importance of getting basic cryptographic primitives right, as they reported, systems ranging from TLS servers and bitcoin wallets to stateoftheart secure multiparty computation protocols were broken when one small subcomponent was either chosen poorly or misused.
00:01:19.138 - 00:01:51.774, Speaker A: The blog also highlighted the ascendance of cryptographic tools for privacy preserving computation, such as zero knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computation, and secure messaging systems. For more on their thoughts from the conference and what they see on the horizon in the industry, check out a link to their blog in the show notes. So thank you again. Trail of bits one last thing before we start. The Zero Knowledge summit is coming up fast. It's happening on October 26 in San Francisco. It promises to be a day packed full of some of the best research in the zero knowledge space.
00:01:51.774 - 00:02:10.470, Speaker A: If you happen to be in the Bay Area for San Francisco blockchain week and want to check it out, please do apply. I'll share the link in the show notes. I hope to see you there. And now here's my conversation with Tyrone, James and Giorgios. What did you just say?
00:02:10.620 - 00:02:14.630, Speaker B: It's first lines from a poem that are also the Alphabet.
00:02:18.330 - 00:02:25.818, Speaker A: Explodes. So I'm sitting with James, Giorgios, and Tarun on this last day of Devcon. Welcome to the show, guys.
00:02:25.904 - 00:02:27.562, Speaker C: Hi, it's good to be here.
00:02:27.616 - 00:02:28.730, Speaker B: Nice to be back.
00:02:28.880 - 00:02:47.950, Speaker A: I want to start off with James and Tarun. You've both been on the show before. I'll actually put links to the shows that you guys were on in the show notes so anyone can find out what you've been working on, maybe in more detail. But why don't we do a quick intro and tell us what you've been up to since you were on the podcast. Let's start with you, James.
00:02:48.110 - 00:03:17.318, Speaker B: So since last time I was on the podcast, we've brought bitcoin, SPV to several more chains. So we're now available in solidity, Goling and ECMAscript, and we have an upcoming rust implementation with Wisem bindings. We finally announced TBTC that we've been working on for almost a year now with Giorgios and other people. And TBTC is the first project of our new trade group, Cross Chain Group, which aims to work on applications across multiple chains.
00:03:17.494 - 00:03:18.602, Speaker A: Who are we?
00:03:18.736 - 00:03:25.546, Speaker B: Well, we is Suma keep and a few other companies will probably be joining very shortly.
00:03:25.658 - 00:03:29.134, Speaker A: Very cool. Tarun, what's new with you?
00:03:29.252 - 00:04:22.314, Speaker C: Yeah, we at Gauntlet have been kind of growing and moving towards basically doing a lot more financial simulation for Ethereum smart contracts, a little less on this proof of stake side. I think there's kind of a little less demand on the kind of pure financial modeling side right now, because right now everyone's focusing on engineering. But in the DeFi world, I think a lot of these contracts that have got a lot of liquidity like compound and uniswap, are starting to try to attract more sophisticated institutional investors, and they're really needing stress tests and things of that nature. So been focusing on that and have been thinking about a lot of new financial attacks on proof of state currencies.
00:04:22.442 - 00:04:31.762, Speaker A: Cool. Lastly, Georgios, I want you to introduce yourself. This is the first time you're on the Zero Knowledge podcast, so why don't you tell people who you are, what you're doing.
00:04:31.896 - 00:05:20.946, Speaker D: Thank you for having me, Anna. So, my name is Georgios. Currently, I'm an independent consultant and researcher focused on layer two, scalability solutions and interoperability solutions, always with security in mind first. Most of my work has been on the plasma side of things. Lately I've been working more and more on the rollup constructions, like primarily the optimistic roll up technique. And lately I've been spending time with James on TBTC, which is an amazing protocol that you should all check. And I've also been spending a lot of my time working on the interledger protocol, which is a protocol for interoperability that is agnostic with respect to the ledger, the settlement layer that you're like.
00:05:20.968 - 00:05:26.520, Speaker A: So you mentioned roll up here, but I think of you very much as also existing in the zero knowledge community.
00:05:27.050 - 00:05:28.760, Speaker D: I try to keep up.
00:05:30.010 - 00:05:49.814, Speaker A: Cool. All right, so now we're here on the last day of Devcon. We're in Osaka. That's where it was this year. I want to hear from all of you what your thoughts were. And I think maybe to start, let's just do like an overall. What was your overall thoughts of Devcon five here in Osaka.
00:05:49.942 - 00:06:58.734, Speaker C: I think something I find kind of interesting is that other large public blockchains were the biggest sponsors this year, and there were a lot of other layer ones presenting at Devcon. And I kind of got the feeling that the gaga days of late 2017 and early 2018, where people thought you could bootstrap a new community for each and every one of these many layer one chains, has turned into, wow, there's the social proof you need from the theorem community if you are going to expand. And we saw things like Ava supporting ETH. We saw, well, a somewhat confusing launch of open libra. And it was interesting to watch the mix of layer ones, other layer ones. The only other comment I will add is it did seem a little weird that they got mainstage these other layer ones. Other ethereum competitors were on the main stage, but people working on ethereum projects were kind of off in different rooms.
00:06:58.734 - 00:07:02.660, Speaker C: And I feel like maybe it seemed a little weird to me.
00:07:03.510 - 00:07:54.222, Speaker B: A lot of my Devcon experience focused around ETH two. There were a lot of workshops and research breakouts and discussions around it. I gave a presentation on cross shard communication. Generally, the people working on e two seem extremely confident about it, while the people who aren't working on it are generally more skeptical of it. So I think that we're seeing many different implementation strategies for ETH two. We're seeing them try to bake roll ups into the shards themselves via execution environments. We're seeing a lot of very high level details of the later phases of e two change very rapidly.
00:07:54.222 - 00:08:06.214, Speaker B: And I think it's perfectly reasonable to have uncertainty and healthy skepticism of it. So that's kind of been what Devcon's been about for me, is trying to figure out where eth two is going.
00:08:06.412 - 00:09:20.846, Speaker D: So for me, instead of being about where e two is going, it's where layer two is going, because we saw the result of a very big effort, the state channels initiative, where eight different projects merged and standardized on a specific way of talking to each other on the protocol layer, on the networking layer, and so on. But currently, the design space is changing in the sense that literally everybody wants to do the roll up thing. And right now, everyone's trying to figure out what's the optimal trade off space. Because currently the roll up seems to be the layer one of layer twos. You have the layer one, the public blockchain that you're using. You have the roll up, which you just dump data on, and then you will be able to perhaps build plasma on top or channels on top and so on. So a lot of my time is figuring out, spent trying to figure out what will the layer two stack look in the end? Will it be layer one on top of it? Roll up on top of it, plasma on top of it, channels on top of it, interledger maybe like for everything speaking to each other.
00:09:21.028 - 00:09:22.720, Speaker B: How many layers is that?
00:09:23.650 - 00:09:26.020, Speaker D: We're way past layer two. Yes.
00:09:26.390 - 00:09:30.894, Speaker B: Also, every time someone says roll up, I can only think of fruit roll ups.
00:09:31.022 - 00:10:06.334, Speaker C: So actually to that .1 thing that I think is funny is the word roll up in the last two months has dramatically grown in scope. If you look at, say, e three, search or telegram or anywhere where people are talking about this stuff, to the point that the word means almost anything you can imagine that has a data availability problem. But there's a zero knowledge roll up, there's an optimistic roll up, and they have very different security and performance guarantees. And yet people kind of, if you go to some of these talks, people say roll up, roll up, roll up, but they don't specify which one.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:17.762, Speaker A: Is it sort of replacing plasma or where is roll up exactly? Because to me, it's about sort of like an off chain or a side chain then being brought back on.
00:10:17.896 - 00:11:22.818, Speaker D: So the difference between the roll up, which is exactly, literally exactly the same technique as the one that's going to be used for execution environments, is that instead of you're just dumping raw data somewhere instead of doing putting everything off chain, it's an on chain data protocol with off chain execution. The optimistic rollup uses fraud proofs. The ZK roll up uses validity proofs. The data that you put on chain is different in one case and in the other. And the roll up, what it solves, it doesn't solve the data availability problem, but it kind of like works around it by saying that we will only advance state if the data is put somewhere that we can all verify where it is. And by solving the data availability problem, quote unquote, you can have like arbitrary state transitions happen while in plasma, where the data availability problem still exists. You're very much limited into what you can do in order to maintain safety.
00:11:22.914 - 00:11:41.310, Speaker B: Of course, data availability is very expensive. You can think of it as one of the primary problems that public blockchains solve. And that's why any kind of roll up only gets you a small constant factor improvement in throughput.
00:11:42.290 - 00:12:02.094, Speaker C: One other thing, I guess about roll ups is the design space is still quite large in terms of there's a trade off of time for like and compute. There's sort of like the three axes. And I really don't like these trilemmas. So I'm going to just say there are three somewhat dependent coordinates.
00:12:02.142 - 00:12:04.130, Speaker B: Can we call it Troon's triangle?
00:12:05.130 - 00:12:36.270, Speaker C: I prefer a simplex because this is a simplex and you can generalize that to more than three parameters. But I think those trade offs are going to be very important to which ones get adopted and used. And I think you're seeing a lot of experiments that are engineering driven in the roll up space versus purely theoretically driven, like in other parts of the zero knowledge world. So I'm pretty well optimistic about that.
00:12:36.340 - 00:12:36.960, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:39.410 - 00:12:45.410, Speaker A: We can totally come back to these topics, but before that, I want to hear a little bit more about what was your favorite talk?
00:12:45.560 - 00:13:26.462, Speaker D: I really liked a talk on stablecoins, which the name of the talk was deleveraging spirals, causing instability of stablecoins, which I found to be very interesting because they actually do modeling and science, which we're missing a bit in the industry, which is very much into Tarun's expertise, like actual modeling, which shows how certain actions of actors can affect the results, can affect the Defi ecosystem. While currently everyone's just putting money in the DeFi ecosystem and we don't know what's going to happen when everything blows up.
00:13:26.596 - 00:13:32.634, Speaker A: Actually, Tyrone, what do you think about. You must be paying a lot of attention to this. Did you see that talk, too?
00:13:32.772 - 00:15:04.480, Speaker C: I've actually seen Aria give that talk in New York, but I think there are a lot of these types of financial attacks that people are really worried about as the total contract values go up. I think getting from the $100 million in a contract to a billion dollars in a contract scaling jump is going to take a lot more analysis of both these contracts and kind of these weird liquidation events that look similar to a lot of things from the financial Cris, but sped up. The interesting thing is there was recently a day where ETH had this really large price drop, and a lot of the services that are supposed to close your CDP for you basically before you get liquidated, they actually couldn't get enough block space to actually do the operation of closing your CDP for you. And that's the closest we've actually come. And the interesting thing is there's just enough competition for block space and there's not so much block space that it's actually very hard to execute this type of attack. But in a world where there's actually more throughput and scalability, it becomes way easier to execute this type of attack. So I think I spent a bunch of time talking with people about why we haven't seen some of these live, and the limited block space kind of helps you in some ways.
00:15:04.480 - 00:15:34.898, Speaker C: So I guess I would add one other thing, which is that I think there's going to be multiple fronts under which scalability is changing within this space. One is financial scalability, like can we really support more than x dollar equivalent locked into a contract that interacts with the actual transaction scalability? And we're going to see a lot more of these interactions leading to sort of malicious, but very interesting to think about attacks and events.
00:15:35.074 - 00:15:56.586, Speaker D: So to rephrase what you said, you mean that currently these attacks are not successful because an attacker is not fast enough, cannot get his transaction in fast enough. But if we had like a uniswap run over channels, for example, and where the attacker could do an instant state update, this could have been much more dangerous.
00:15:56.698 - 00:16:58.420, Speaker C: Yes, one other thing, actually, speaking of the other proof of stake networks, I think you're starting to see a lot of them trying to build in lending and stablecoin primitives directly into the base consensus layer. So I think the most famous example is Celo, who you've had on the show pretty recently. But I think even the other proof of stake layer one projects I talked to, a lot of them want to find ways for validators to actually make income streams that aren't just keeping up with inflation. And some of those income streams involve letting you lend against or borrow against your locked stake token, kind of the same way you borrow against your eth in maker. And I've been hearing a lot of very interesting crazy ideas, because I think people are starting to realize it's going to be hard for validators to make money if they are just keeping up with inflation and taking an ever shrinking pie of the basis point spread on that.
00:16:59.030 - 00:17:22.666, Speaker B: There are some other revenue streams that are available to validators. We call it minor extractable value. And generally it's executing the kinds of attacks that we were talking about earlier. Validators and miners are in a privileged position to execute any kind of attack they want for no gas instantly because they make the blocks for sure.
00:17:22.688 - 00:17:29.954, Speaker C: And I think the roll up stuff will change the cost, the sort of cost plus, as we said with uniswap.
00:17:30.022 - 00:17:36.880, Speaker A: But are you saying like another way that validators can make money is just to corrupt the system?
00:17:37.490 - 00:17:38.362, Speaker C: Sounds horrible.
00:17:38.426 - 00:17:46.414, Speaker D: They're not corrupting the system. They're performing valid actions which abuse badly designed mechanisms.
00:17:46.542 - 00:17:48.146, Speaker B: Coded law. Yes.
00:17:48.248 - 00:18:40.226, Speaker C: Speaking of my favorite talk, actually it was definitely Phil Dyne's talk on free will and it was something about how do you quantify extractable value in a smart contract? And what are the formalisms to bound say? The total amount of value that any single validator can extract by basically having a bribing contract or making cartels or different types of behaviors. And I think that we're going to see a lot more of that in the proof of stake world. In proof of work it's actually really hard to because the actual asset that is earning you is paying for sort of fees is separate from the way of generating it by burning energy. You don't have a lot of these kind of extractable events. There's a much smaller surface area.
00:18:40.408 - 00:19:08.970, Speaker B: And the other aspect is that proof of work miners tend to have more avenues of optimization than stakers do. So proof of work, your primary expense is electricity. And you can always search for cheaper electricity and hardware, and you can always search for better manufacturing processes. You are likely to save more money doing that than you would by pursuing minor extractable value in many cases.
00:19:09.890 - 00:19:17.440, Speaker C: I want to shill for James because he doesn't want to shill his own article, but he Hasu and.
00:19:19.330 - 00:19:20.394, Speaker B: Brandon Curtis.
00:19:20.442 - 00:19:32.510, Speaker C: From radar wrote a pretty cool article on this, trying to quantify minor extractable value for proof of work chains that definitely worth reading.
00:19:32.670 - 00:19:51.770, Speaker B: It's been in the works for months and months and we've rewritten it so many times and I'm super excited it's finally out the door. It just came out yesterday. I think it's hard to tell with time zones. Hasu deserves most of the credit. It's his model. Brandon and I provided input and review mostly.
00:19:52.350 - 00:20:16.962, Speaker A: But going back to the derivatives idea are these protocols actually they're building it into it and it's not like you're doing wrapped. So basically in Cosmos where you have a lot of tokens already staked, I've heard proposals, I don't know if it's actually live where they'd actually create like wrapped tokens on another chain. It's like promises, it's like ious on what's been staked or something.
00:20:17.016 - 00:21:05.230, Speaker C: But to be fair, if you use makerdao or use compound, you sort of have the same thing because you convert your asset into the wrapped version of that asset. The difference is the next generation smart contract platforms, a lot of them are going to have the staking mechanism as a smart contract. So right now, the actual code that checks hey, you transferred X Ethereum. Does it meet all the requirements or all the signatures? Are they valid? Is this account allowed to transfer to this account, more or less. That's all done in the client code separate from the smart contract side. But implementing staking like the rules of staking in a smart contract makes it extremely easy to generate the derivatives in the same smart contract or in another smart contract.
00:21:05.590 - 00:21:23.190, Speaker A: Are you talking about kind of the tokens that decided to stay on Ethereum then? Is these like the ERC 20 type protocols where it's like it still lives on Ethereum? Or are these also like the layer one new, completely new protocols? They have all of their validation being done through smart contracts.
00:21:23.770 - 00:21:49.550, Speaker C: The rules of validation are done through smart contracts. So, for instance, if I want to set the monetary policy of there's an inflation rate of this amount that's just executed in a smart contract that computes what the current block reward is. And then when a validator is chosen by, say, a VRF, the VRF is executed as a smart contract too, that chooses a random address and then gives them the block reward.
00:21:51.010 - 00:22:01.006, Speaker B: Generally speaking, newer proof of stake systems have much less of a division between contracts and consensus. Do you think that's a fair description?
00:22:01.118 - 00:22:41.790, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the idea is to make consensus a first class object so that it's implemented as a smart think. You know, Facebook in particular with move. I think one of the cool things about the language is that they force the smart contract developers to think about move only semantics. So Ethereum is scarce and the scarce object can't be copied. It needs to be movable. Only making that very apparent to a developer who's writing a DAP or a smart contract. Having that as a first class object makes it much easier to implement the other client code, just as a smart contract itself.
00:22:41.860 - 00:22:48.900, Speaker A: Can you just really quickly give me a couple examples of protocols that are coming out that have that construction that you just mentioned where it's very, very close.
00:22:49.670 - 00:22:55.022, Speaker C: Sello Facebook Salana probably e two. I actually have no clue.
00:22:55.166 - 00:22:58.502, Speaker B: Well, it's very hard to say anything about eth two beyond phase zero.
00:22:58.556 - 00:23:06.006, Speaker D: The original idea on e two was that Casper would be. Not before it was called eth two. Was that Casper FFG would have been.
00:23:06.028 - 00:23:07.942, Speaker B: A smart contract on eth one.
00:23:07.996 - 00:23:15.580, Speaker D: Yes. So this idea has been around for a while. It's just that now we're seeing people actually start to deploy it.
00:23:16.830 - 00:24:33.780, Speaker B: So going back to staking derivatives a little bit, the main thing to know about them is that they're literally unpreventable. You can't actually force someone to lock up an asset because I can always make a side bet with someone else. I can always go to Giorgios and ask for liquidity on my locked up asset. The question is how difficult it is to do that, and how much slippage or premium I will pay in order to get liquidity. You can't prevent people from trading things they own. So we're kind of seeing some chains try out the Netflix model of staking derivatives, where instead of having these off chain pirate derivatives that are freely traded, some chains are trying to provide an approved oked ecosystem for staking derivatives on chain so that they don't have weird side markets interfering with their consensus process. One of the ideas is that it'll just be so much easier to use the approved market that undesirable from a consensus security perspective, instruments will be less common.
00:24:34.310 - 00:25:07.354, Speaker C: And I would add one other thing, which is that they're designed with the idea of the cost of putting an oracle or some other way of getting an external price feed into the underlying network has to be a lot more expensive than the on chain version. So you basically try to adjust the economics of these instruments, both at the transaction fee level and at kind of turnover level, to kind of make it too expensive to have to interact with an off chain, centralized exchange.
00:25:07.402 - 00:25:08.400, Speaker A: This is cool.
00:25:08.770 - 00:25:18.850, Speaker B: A concrete example of this happening in the past is tezzies were traded on multiple different venues long before Tezos launched.
00:25:19.190 - 00:25:46.854, Speaker D: The same thing was happening also for ICO tokens. People were buying tokens via smart contracts. Let's say I have like Xyz ICO. I would send my ether to my smart contract. The smart contract would check how many tokens I would get from the ICO. It would mint this many coins at that smart contract, which were like, literally. And then this would be one to one redeemable for the tokens from the ICO crowd sale contract once they were liquid.
00:25:46.982 - 00:26:09.730, Speaker B: Right? Because anybody can offer this, and multiple major exchanges have done so in the past. We should really expect to see e two staking derivatives available on the open market long before ETH two has smart contracts or even transfers of assets.
00:26:10.710 - 00:26:13.474, Speaker D: What would be the relationship between them?
00:26:13.592 - 00:26:34.140, Speaker B: Well, because you can always buy one staked eth two for one ether, there must be a price cap. It can't be worth more than one ether, which implies that eth two will be worth less than ether by whatever we value the staking revenue at.
00:26:35.230 - 00:26:45.450, Speaker D: If there is a way to go back from ETh two to Eth one, would that change the price relation versus if it was only a one way peg?
00:26:45.610 - 00:26:46.640, Speaker B: Yes, definitely.
00:26:47.090 - 00:27:40.350, Speaker C: Yeah. One other way of thinking about this is if you make. Imagine you have two different prices in transaction fees for going from ETH one to e two, like one ether to one beacon eth, and a price going from one beacon eth to one ether, and they're two separate prices. You can think of the case where what's happening in phase zero looks like having one of the prices be infinite and the other 10. But in reality, a smooth transition to this would basically be to make it very asymmetric. So make it cost in transaction fees 100 x what it cost for one direction relative to the other, and then slowly bring that ratio down until it hits parity. That would be a way to kind of smoothly go from having this price delta until you get it to converge right when you kind of are launching further phases.
00:27:40.850 - 00:27:57.880, Speaker B: And it's worth noting that it will converge as ETH two becomes more tightly integrated with ETH one, and you have two way asset transfers and things like that. It's just likely to be very messy based on what we know about the market dynamics right now.
00:27:58.330 - 00:29:17.470, Speaker C: So I want to actually give a little bit of historical context to this idea of having staking derivatives, or like this theorem we're sort of sketching out that's claiming you must have derivatives the moment you have a capital asset that you're trying to make scarce, versus a physical asset like energy that is naturally scarce, and you don't have to sort of force scarcity on it. So in kind of the normal financial world, an interesting fact about us reserves is there's much less money that's actually cash floating in the US supply than there is other types of money supply. So most us companies don't hold cash. They actually have very little cash. And one of the reasons that this has flipped since the financial crisis is that during the financial crisis, there were enough banks that failed and companies that had their money at banks without deposit insurance. So in the US, every bank has to offer you deposit insurance up to $250,000. But for companies which have bigger cash flows or have more cash sitting around, that doesn't protect them enough.
00:29:17.470 - 00:30:20.062, Speaker C: They might have millions of dollars in a bank account. So what happened was, after that failure, in order to sort of replicate deposit insurance, a market called the repurchase agreement market kind of grew a lot. And how the repurchase agreement market works is actually very similar to a lot of these semicolateralized derivatives in crypto. So I'll give you kind of like a high level version of this. So instead of having cash, you go and buy bonds, and bonds are considered us treasuries are considered the most cash like asset. So you're Apple, you get $100 million today, you go buy $100 million of treasuries and let's say tomorrow you have to build a new factory and you need to get $100 million in cash to pay Foxconn or something. Then what you have to do is you basically lend your bonds out for cash, and then you go and buy the factory.
00:30:20.062 - 00:30:35.990, Speaker C: And then because you're Apple and you have cash flow, your lenders trust you to pay it back in like a week. Know, I don't know. You sold some more iPhones. And this system looks very similar to a lot of the on chain lending platforms. It's just that the pricing mechanism is very different.
00:30:36.140 - 00:30:43.094, Speaker D: I think that what you just described is very similar to what was being done with CDI and RDAI and all these DAi derivatives.
00:30:43.222 - 00:30:53.070, Speaker A: But like, in a very short, this is like, the iterations are incredibly fast. What you're describing, you say it like it was far in the past. This was like six months ago.
00:30:53.220 - 00:31:09.070, Speaker C: 75% of us dollars that exist in bank databases are in the repurchase agreement market. So very little of the real of the dollars that are outstanding in the world actually are not held in bonds.
00:31:09.150 - 00:31:10.420, Speaker B: That's a lot of dollars.
00:31:12.310 - 00:31:39.894, Speaker A: Given that I have you three here, one of the topics that I'd really like to talk about is sort of the state of things. Since we're just wrapping up Devcon, we can talk about the state of Ethereum. What's happening in Ethereum right now? In 2017, there was a very distinct thing happening. Culture moment, whatever. 2018 also had this sort of like it was crypto winter. There's a lot of positivity. There was a lot of excitement.
00:31:39.894 - 00:31:45.920, Speaker A: There was a lot of building. People seemed pretty pumped. How did they feel this year? What was the sort of sentiment this year?
00:31:46.770 - 00:32:44.800, Speaker D: I think that people are sobering up right now. It's no longer a situation where you raise a lot of money with just a white paper. You need to have a product, and you need to find some product market fit. If this thing exists in this industry beyond regulatory arbitrage and securities fraud, we're starting, finally, that scalability is coming soon. Trademark in the sense that things are starting to get built around the scalable protocols. DeFi is definitely the narrative that will stick around, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the competitors will actually react to this, because the competitors of Ethereum are. Ethereum accepts everybody.
00:32:44.800 - 00:33:02.600, Speaker D: That's why the Ethereum culture is very well known for that. Come as you are, we're going to take you in. And as Darun said earlier, we saw that with the sponsors and the mainstage talks by competitors. However, what I haven't figured out yet is what will the competitors do?
00:33:03.210 - 00:33:16.380, Speaker B: I would expect they'd copy any portion of the Defi ecosystem that finds product market fit. But do you guys think anything in DeFi has product market fit yet?
00:33:17.150 - 00:34:20.814, Speaker C: I think the interesting thing is that, at least coming from the New York side of things, I do hear institutions and more traditional hedge funds, as opposed to kind of crypto native funds, being interested in a lot of the on chain lending products more as just a way to diversify some of their lending risk. Ironically, in some ways, I think the thing that has the best product market fit, and this is, I guess, maybe somewhat controversial, is tether, which is the ultimate tool of traders and regulatory arbitrage. The other thing is the fiat backed stablecoins have not had any blacklisting. So if you go and look at USDC, the blacklist function has never been called. That's why it's kind of funny that it's getting lent on compound. So you can basically get a KYC dollar, lend it on compound to someone who's not KYC, and kind of get around the system. So a lot of regulatory arbitrage stuff is working really well.
00:34:20.814 - 00:34:55.450, Speaker C: There's also a lot of kind of India and China focused companies that are trying to be like betterment or wealth. You know, you put in some fiat and they help you get into crypto, and then they go and lend and get you some yield. I think there's some of this personal finance type of stuff that seems to actually be. The narrative seems to be striking a tone with people who are very different than the crypto native users. So that's just at least from the Defi perspective.
00:34:55.870 - 00:35:25.762, Speaker D: What I want to talk about to you, James, and you, Tyrone, is currently. I think that for me at least, there's a big question. How do you build a business that makes money in this industry? Making money. And they have the following constraints. No token, your business does not reduce to being an exchange. So onboarding offboarding platforms are exchanges. Uniswap, which you could argue has some exchange like structure.
00:35:25.762 - 00:35:41.178, Speaker D: How do you generate revenue without margins going to zero fast and without, other than consulting, not VC revenue? Like, I have customers that use the product. The product makes money.
00:35:41.344 - 00:36:40.860, Speaker B: You know, it hasn't escaped my notice that all three of us work in services to other projects. Essentially, sumo tends to work with layer one chains building interoperability solutions turn gauntlet tends to work on agent analysis for other projects. Proof of stake and Defi systems. Giorgios, I know you've been involved as a consultant in a number of research on projects on layer one and layer. So like we've all kind of answered that question the same way is we're providing non recurring engineering work for other teams and those other teams are all VC funded or token funded, which usually means VC funded. For now, we're all just trying to make revenue where we can. And I think we're all really searching for recurring revenue, something that's a sustainable product.
00:36:40.860 - 00:36:50.414, Speaker B: And so based on where all our businesses are at here, I don't know that you're going to get a solid answer for how to build that. We're all still searching, I think.
00:36:50.612 - 00:37:49.250, Speaker C: And I will say I guess the businesses that I think staking has helped launch will and seem quite unbundled right now. So node operation services like Bison Trails who was on the podcast earlier custodians especially as people seemingly want these NPC style custody instead of strictly multisig and broker dealers. So people who actually can provide sizable liquidity for holders, I think you're going to see those three businesses integrate from a traditional financial view. Those services are all sold by one vendor. So like if you're a hedge fund, you don't find a custodian who's separate from your prime broker who's separate from the person who's getting your bond coupons for you. They're all the same and it's the same service. And I think someone will find that aggregation at that layer.
00:37:49.250 - 00:37:55.220, Speaker C: That's like in my mind slightly adjacent to exchanges. It's exchange plus plus.
00:37:56.410 - 00:38:00.310, Speaker B: Do you think existing exchanges are looking for that aggregation?
00:38:01.610 - 00:38:26.480, Speaker C: I think that you can tell by their moves they all are moving into staking. They're all operating nodes. I think they're going to sell developer node operation like infura or alchemy. I think you're definitely seeing that happen, which is also going to just shrink the margins. But at least there's like a minimum when you have a physical hardware thing that you can kind of go to.
00:38:27.010 - 00:38:31.562, Speaker D: I'm trying to figure out how can we grow the pie rather than redistribute wealth.
00:38:31.706 - 00:38:48.150, Speaker C: I actually have a question. I'm responding to your question with the question, but I vaguely remember something called an NFT that was supposed to be the pie growing universe for online items, digital items. What happened to that narrative?
00:38:48.970 - 00:39:06.874, Speaker B: I thought ERC 20s were supposed to be the pie growing thing wasn't like rich state on a chain supposed to be the pie growing thing, and now DFI is supposed to be the pie growing thing. And I guess we've gone through a lot of things that haven't grown the pie that have always been supposed to be that thing.
00:39:06.992 - 00:39:39.214, Speaker A: So I guess the answer to that question is, you guys don't know the answer to that question. It's a thought experiment on that level. I want to talk about funding. So I think your question was very much like, how does a business make revenue? But I think there are other ways that companies projects are funding themselves. Sometimes they've actually added funding directly into the protocol itself. Founder rewards, block rewards. You have companies that have developed protocol, and they're probably also going to move into staking and validation.
00:39:39.214 - 00:39:51.702, Speaker A: If you look at, like, the Cosmos team and who the validators are in cosmos, they've at least found ways to maintain their own livelihood through that. Yeah. I'm wondering, what are your thoughts on all of these kind of, like, new ways of funding?
00:39:51.846 - 00:40:19.460, Speaker B: I'm generally skeptical of anything built into the protocol because it funds things. It funds people, and people have control of those funds without the obligation to provide any value in exchange for them. This is why I am a fan of revenue focused businesses, is because if people are buying your product, that means you're providing value.
00:40:21.350 - 00:40:59.642, Speaker D: You take something that is very objective, like the protocol rewards. Currently, for example, in proof of work, like a block gets mined, the rewards go somewhere. If you add a way for dev, funds like that get distributed based on some multisig, then you took something that was perfectly objective and you made it subjective based on that multisig. And my whole idea for joining this industry was I can have something I can observe completely objectively, like work is objective and proof of work is objective. So I want to avoid any form of subjectivity baked in the product owner.
00:40:59.786 - 00:41:29.658, Speaker B: Tying into that a little bit, the whole thesis of blockchains is that incentives create results, and that if there is a protocol sponsored stream of money being given out, that people will compete to get it. And so this is why I don't really understand the push towards governance and protocol issued funds is if there is money being given out, people will compete to get it.
00:41:29.824 - 00:42:20.570, Speaker C: One thing I will say about that that is kind of weird in a lot of these new next generation networks is that there's not the homogeneity in node types and rewards as there is in proof of work. In a lot of staking networks, there are many different types of validators so some validators are actually executing the state transitions. Some validators might get rewarded for providing data availability. Some, especially in the zero knowledge world, will get rewarded for running proof generation, like in coda. Right? And now you have a multi agent problem where you have to design the reward structure such that you have a revenue split that everyone is happy with. And you now get back to this founder's reward problem with this multiple node types.
00:42:21.790 - 00:42:40.554, Speaker A: I didn't think about it that way. That's interesting. But I guess in this case, the decision making of the breakdown would have to happen, or would likely happen before the launch. Or do you imagine it actually being altered after launch has happened? And then there's some small group that can make those decisions.
00:42:40.602 - 00:42:44.020, Speaker B: How much money is there to make by altering it after the launch has happened?
00:42:45.750 - 00:43:08.940, Speaker C: I think you're going to see both of them. I think even in the more permissioned blockchains, I suspect we will also see some of these revenue sharing agreements change quite dramatically, as we've observed, certainly with Libra and the change to the association members.
00:43:09.390 - 00:43:46.040, Speaker A: Wow. I hadn't thought about that. I hadn't thought about that connection between the issue with the subjectivity of block rewards and the distribution of that with these emerging protocols and all the different roles that validators and the various types of validators will take. Since I have you here, and this is actually going to be episode 99 of the podcast, which is kind of cool, I really wanted to talk about the zero knowledge space. I feel like you've, at least all three of you have been observing it or acting in it, working with it. There's a lot going on right now.
00:43:46.730 - 00:44:26.350, Speaker D: So there has been a so called cambrian explosion of schemes in 2019. We called it Snarktember Snarktober. We'll see if we'll have Snark November, I guess. I don't know. Currently we've been using a protocol that has cryptography like Bitcoin and Ethereum all use cryptography that's been well known for more than 20 years, like even well standardized with wide support, very well explored. Everything. All the new protocols that are being released, yes, they might have amazing properties.
00:44:26.350 - 00:45:37.574, Speaker D: Yes, they might get you constant prover time, constant verifier, like low memory, no trusted setup, or continued like never ending setup. However, you're using cryptography from 2019 that only 30 or even less people have read, let alone understand, let alone understanding and being able to evaluate the proofs is very far from each other. So I may be able to read a paper and kind of get the gist of it and explain it to somebody. But me evaluating the security proofs of the paper is a completely different level, and it's usually the authors that are going to be able to do that only, and maybe they're academic reviewers in some peer reviewed conference. The situation is that when these protocols get coded, you have another problem, because you have the perspective and you have the protocol, you have the spec, and you have the implementation. Each time you move from one to the other, there is even fewer people that can do it. So the people that can currently implement and deploy these protocols are very few.
00:45:37.574 - 00:45:49.226, Speaker D: And I would still be very careful with what I'm going to be using from all of this. And let me take a moment to say that at the ZK summit, which.
00:45:49.248 - 00:45:50.926, Speaker A: Is coming up in two weeks, I.
00:45:50.948 - 00:46:23.078, Speaker D: Will be doing a presentation on a map of the zero knowledge proving systems that are being used today with the latest protocols which were released. And the title is going to be growth 16 is not dead, because growth 16 is one of the best protocols that we have to date. It works very well. It's been battle tested to a good extent, and I think that we should be a bit more conservative rather than trying to reinvent new stuff at the.
00:46:23.084 - 00:46:37.082, Speaker A: Same time, why don't we give a little bit of context for the listeners? What kind of stuff is actually coming out? What's exciting? I think what you've just described there is like, this is the issue with a lot coming out, but what is it like? What is coming out?
00:46:37.216 - 00:46:47.840, Speaker B: Snarks are like the most widely known of these, and there are a few different snark constructions dating back to 2013 or so, maybe even a little earlier than that.
00:46:48.690 - 00:46:52.910, Speaker C: Quadratic arithmetic programs compilation Gentry thanks.
00:46:52.980 - 00:46:55.780, Speaker D: 90 88 Goldvas, what are you talking about?
00:46:56.150 - 00:47:01.874, Speaker C: But I mean, the first, more practical thing was really the gentry paper man.
00:47:01.912 - 00:47:57.926, Speaker B: I hate being on podcasts with people who know more than me. So they only go back like seven years in practice, right? And the first ones were incredibly inefficient. So, for example, when Zcash launched, their snark prover took like minutes to run, and the verifier was much more efficient, but still was computationally very expensive. Snarks have an additional downside, which is they need a trusted setup. So there has to be some trusted group of people that go through a process and throw away the toxic waste and do the whole thing. What we're seeing now is many, many different systems that improve on specific aspects. So, like, graph 16 is just almost a strictly better version or a strictly better construction of the same kinds of proofs we saw in 2012.
00:47:57.926 - 00:48:40.574, Speaker B: But then you get into things like sonic and supersonic and plonk and all of these other names that I'm going to forget. Each of them are improving some specific aspect of it. Maybe making the trusted setup reusable for many different proofs, maybe trying to remove the trusted setup, maybe trying to have more efficient provers. We're seeing kind of exploration of some trade off space that we don't understand very well yet. We don't know what is possible and how efficient or small or pretty we can make these. So we're trying a lot of things and seeing what has useful applications.
00:48:40.702 - 00:49:19.310, Speaker A: I've noticed as groups are trying to implement what's coming out, what is actually happening is groups that aren't deep in the research see so much flurry of activity. They're like, this is exciting, but we're going to wait until the dust settles before we start really deploying our engineering team, our engineering efforts towards these things. Because what if a brand new underlying construction comes out in the next month or two, which is very possible, and it changes a lot of it. That's at least what I've been hearing from some of the teams, which is kind of like the other side. It's the double edged sword, right?
00:49:19.460 - 00:49:24.274, Speaker D: Or what if an attack gets found because the proofs in the paper were wrong?
00:49:24.312 - 00:50:18.034, Speaker C: I will say one other thing, especially in the style of proof that's used for a lot of these constructions, is that they're not quite perfectly comparable assumptions between the different models and actually knowing there's a sort of like performance versus time versus security versus a few other things. Simplex trade off, simplex triangle. That's why it's simplex. It has a Barry center in all dimensions. But basically we're also forgetting that we're drawing all these trade offs on the same surface, but there's actually different security assumptions in a lot of these proofs, and a lot of them use different types of reductions. And so it's not just reading a single paper. And I think Georgia was sort of getting at this.
00:50:18.034 - 00:50:37.618, Speaker C: It's like you need to know the whole dependency graph of all the papers beforehand and understand when a certain assumption was relaxed or changed, and that knowing that whole body of knowledge ends up being really hard for a single person at a company to really be the expert on.
00:50:37.724 - 00:51:27.430, Speaker B: Right. Especially because this is an extremely complex field and the work is so new. In ECDSA, we're typically using assumptions that are 20 years old, like discrete log problem stuff. There's starks, which are based on hashes, and those are using assumptions that are like 40 years old and battle tested. A lot of zero knowledge proofs coming out today are using knowledge of exponent assumptions, which are like five years old, really. And we have new VDF stuff using class groups, which is maybe ten years old. We're seeing a lot of cryptography introduced that is based on poorly understood assumptions, or assumptions that haven't been tested in practice, or relaxed versions of older assumptions.
00:51:27.430 - 00:51:34.218, Speaker B: It's extremely difficult for anyone who's not a full time academic to keep up with.
00:51:34.384 - 00:51:35.980, Speaker A: And yet we still try.
00:51:37.070 - 00:51:39.594, Speaker B: I don't try all that hard, I.
00:51:39.632 - 00:52:36.446, Speaker C: Think, at least personally, I will say there was a while when I was very excited by what I would call the zero knowledge porn that was coming out every week, and I really enjoyed reading these papers and having discussions with people. But the flood of the Gilgamesh event, the cambrian explosion, sort of has made it hard to even care anymore. It reminds me of proof of stake in 2016 and 17. First you had Algorand, and you had Snow White from Raphael Pas and Lane she. And after that there was this flood of provable proof of stake protocol papers. I remember reading them being like, oh, this is amazing. And then by the time I read the 7th one, I was like, they're all actually basically the same, with a very tiny little difference, because they're all chasing after ICO money.
00:52:36.548 - 00:52:45.150, Speaker D: And also they're written. Some papers that I've read, they're intentionally made very complex because complexity sells.
00:52:47.330 - 00:52:50.478, Speaker C: The sex cells of the cryptocurrency industry.
00:52:50.654 - 00:53:01.510, Speaker B: Complexity cells. If you've met Zakimunyan, you know that he likes to say that all other proof of stake systems are just tendermint with extra steps.
00:53:02.330 - 00:53:06.674, Speaker D: The infamous theorem of the tendermint reduction.
00:53:06.802 - 00:53:53.750, Speaker C: Yes, I will say that I suspect once we actually have simpler proofs for a lot of the zero knowledge work that's coming out right now, we might be able to kind of connect this morass of different theories and assumptions and kind of get a good intuitive understanding. This oftentimes happens in mathematics, where a difficult result is proved, and it's proved in a really complicated way, and then someone finds a much simpler version, and at each level of simpler proof, you get much more intuition into why it works. Whereas the first really difficult thing was someone really straining and kind of climbing Mount Everest for the first time, whereas each additional one is a better and better Sherpa guiding you up the mountain.
00:53:54.570 - 00:54:07.450, Speaker A: That's nice. Well, I really want to say thank you to all three of you for joining me on this podcast on our 99th episode. Is there anything else that you want to talk about before we sign off?
00:54:07.520 - 00:54:54.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. I had a question for basically everyone here, which is, I think we've seen a lot of interest in using starks and snarks for Dexs, but what are some other applications outside of consensus and dexes that excite you, especially with regard to the implementation? Because if you think about it, whichever application or layer or protocol implements any of these proverb verifier systems, they will be designing it around their organizational structure and whatever their application actually is. And so it's interesting to think about how the code that gets written will reflect the first user who's writing it. So what are some of those applications you're excited about?
00:54:55.470 - 00:56:08.980, Speaker B: I'm really interested in how we can use zero knowledge proofs in cross chain communication, which is what I work on all the time and what I'm excited about. So we've been talking a lot recently about this concept we call observability is what can a chain practically know? And part of this is like, what is deterministic and publicly verifiable, but the other part of it is what is cheap to verify, cheap enough that you can put it in a consensus process. And so zero knowledge proofs have this great property that they're publicly verifiable, deterministic, and a lot of them have constant time verification, so they can be extremely cheap to verify, and we can verify extremely large statements about reality in other systems in a very small amount of time cost. So that might mean Coda's recursive snark structure, making statements about the entire history of their chain and evaluating that from within some other chain's smart contract or consensus process.
00:56:10.470 - 00:56:41.500, Speaker D: I'm a fan of dark pools, but nobody wants to talk about it because it might be illegal to do. But I'm a big fan of the design, and I think that once zero knowledge proofs get deployed more, we will see some kind of uniswap with a built in dark pool to be more robust when a market participant wants to add a bunch of liquidity to it so that nobody can see that the market moved. Yeah, that is something I would like to see at some point.
00:56:42.590 - 00:57:36.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm quite interested in the interoperability use case for zero knowledge proofs. I've done a workshop with Chris Gohs from Cosmos, where we actually went through all these different ways that zero knowledge type constructions can be used in interoperability, not only as light clients, but in all these different ways. It was really, I mean, the topic that I wanted to talk about here at Devcon was about the idea of privacy and transparency and this balance that can be achieved through zero knowledge proofs. And that kind of takes the form of things like compliance or interactions with some regulators. A very unpopular topic in some circles. But I think that zero knowledge proofs in that context could be very, very interesting. That's a very real world example that I'm using here, but thanks for that question.
00:57:36.494 - 00:57:38.560, Speaker A: How about you? Do you have anything?
00:57:39.170 - 00:58:12.298, Speaker C: I guess I'm in the frame of giorgios. Maybe not quite dark pools, but some other kind of liquidity provision without leaking identity. Because in the normal markets, that happens via speed, not via brains. And so it's kind of interesting to think about what happens when you flip that dynamic. What does trading look like? But again, it doesn't feel like that's like a growing the pie use case. Just to go back to earlier. It's just cool.
00:58:12.384 - 00:58:13.020, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:58:13.470 - 00:58:27.374, Speaker A: Okay, so listen, thanks again. This has been really cool to have this conversation with the three of you. I hope each of you will come back on the podcast. Maybe I can also get you guys all back at the same time. Let's try this again.
00:58:27.412 - 00:58:35.726, Speaker D: Thank you very much for having Usana. Tyrone, and James are among the people I most respect in this industry. So this was very nice and very insightful to me.
00:58:35.828 - 00:58:45.970, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for hiring us, and congratulations on 99. You're almost at a big milestone. I'm excited to see what you do for that episode.
00:58:46.710 - 00:58:53.270, Speaker A: Well, Frederick will definitely be on that one. I'm sorry that Frederick isn't here in Osaka with us.
00:58:53.340 - 00:59:02.678, Speaker B: Thanks for having us, Anna. This has been really fun. It's nice to get a room full of friends together and talk about the state of things and where we think they're going. I'm excited about it. Still.
00:59:02.764 - 00:59:03.942, Speaker D: See you next year.
00:59:04.076 - 00:59:07.110, Speaker A: All right. And to our listeners, thanks for listening.
