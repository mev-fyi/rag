You could, in principle, use it with any chain. And the thing that's really cool about IBC is that it's fundamentally not sort of, oh, this is a bridge. It's more like, you know, TCP for blockchains, a way to have two chains securely communicate and pass messages to each other. And the really powerful thing about that design is that it means that if you wanted to, for instance, do bridging, you can do so without any other sort of additional trust assumption. You close.
