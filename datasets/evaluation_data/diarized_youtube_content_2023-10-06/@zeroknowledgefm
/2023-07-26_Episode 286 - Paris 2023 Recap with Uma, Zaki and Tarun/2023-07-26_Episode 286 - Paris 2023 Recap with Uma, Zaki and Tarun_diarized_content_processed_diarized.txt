00:00:05.450 - 00:00:58.590, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. This week I host a spontaneous catch up with Uma and Zaki Tarun joins us partway through the interview as well. This was recorded near the end of the ECC Paris week, and in it we talk about the topics that were discussed at the events, our favorite talks, our favorite parties, and generally what the sentiment is in the space. As we round out the week, expect some spicy takes off topic rambles, inside scoops and more. A bottle of fine french champagne may or may not have been polished off during this interview, so hope you enjoy.
00:00:58.590 - 00:01:27.990, Speaker A: Now, before we kick off, the application to attend ZK Summit Ten is now open. This time around we will be hosting the event in London. It's happening on September 20. As always, we aim to bring together the top researchers and engineers working in ZK to share their latest research and new findings. Check out the show notes for the application form. Please note spots are limited and only folks who go through the application will be considered to attend, so hope to see you there. Now Tanya will share a little bit about this week's sponsors.
00:01:29.150 - 00:02:28.806, Speaker B: Polygon Labs is thrilled to announce Polygon 20 the value layer for the Internet. Polygon 20 makes mass adoption possible by offering users and developers unlimited scalability and unified liquidity. This mission is fueled by groundbreaking ZK innovations, including a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability protocol and the next generation of the industryleading and widely adopted plonky two proving system.

00:03:04.650 - 00:03:16.426, Speaker A: I'm here with Zaki Uma, and we might have a special guest coming soon to join us. And we're here in Paris near the end of the ECC Paris week. Welcome.
00:03:16.528 - 00:03:17.082, Speaker C: Hello.
00:03:17.216 - 00:03:17.850, Speaker D: Hello.
00:03:18.000 - 00:03:30.734, Speaker A: All right, so let's kick off with a little know. We're not quite at the end of the week, but we're far enough in that I think you might have some thoughts on what's been happening here. So just overall, generally, what's your week been like?
00:03:30.852 - 00:03:46.686, Speaker D: This has been a very sort of intense and chaotic week. There's a conference, there's like infinite side events. Every price of my calendar had, like three simultaneous things I was supposed to be at. Paris has been lovely. Paris accommodates a large 10,000 blockchain people really easily.
00:03:46.798 - 00:04:01.560, Speaker C: Yeah. Very similar experience. A lot of very fun side events. I think most people I've talked to have not even been to the conference or maybe don't even have a ticket. And the side events have been really the highlight, which seems to be always the.
00:04:02.570 - 00:04:19.518, Speaker A: I mean, ECC is an event itself, but I kind of called it the week of it, because at this point, I think even during that four day period, each day we'll have, I don't know, like six, seven other full day conferences happening. Did you get a chance to check out any of the other ones?
00:04:19.684 - 00:04:40.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I went to Mev Day, which I thought was a really high quality event. There was a lot of discussion around Dex design intents, the future of the transaction, and Mev supply chain, which is interesting. And then there was two ZK days events, and, yeah, those are the ones that I've been to so far.
00:04:40.812 - 00:05:24.386, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of investors also through events is a big thing here. So funds that I've either invested in my projects or I've lp in or all had events. One of the things that the vcs have figured out is it's actually better if they throw their events parallel to a blockchain event that everyone else is going to, instead of the old thing, which is like, everyone fly to San Francisco for three days or some resort or whatever. It's actually like, no one really wants to do that anymore. So like a half day event parallel to a crypto conference. You can get a lot more in.
00:05:24.488 - 00:05:42.502, Speaker A: That's interesting you say that because we've actually experienced almost the opposite where we're so exhausted, and you then try to tack on some sort of workshop or retreat where you're actually trying to solve a problem and, yeah, you're sort of out of it. I guess it works if you put it beforehand.
00:05:42.646 - 00:05:45.946, Speaker D: Yeah, I did a topic specific retreat before.
00:05:46.128 - 00:05:47.466, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair.
00:05:47.648 - 00:05:51.030, Speaker D: And then did some investor events sort of in parallel.
00:05:51.110 - 00:05:55.182, Speaker A: Yeah, I think before must be the trick because we've tried in the middle before.
00:05:55.236 - 00:05:56.734, Speaker D: Worked really well.
00:05:56.932 - 00:06:02.666, Speaker A: All right. Is this your first time coming to the Paris week? What's your impression?
00:06:02.778 - 00:06:35.434, Speaker C: I mean, Paris has been really wonderful. People really warned me about the weather, but from my understanding, this year is really nice. So it's been super nice. And I think there is still a lot of activity going on, even though I think everyone acknowledges, oh, we're in the bear market, there's still a ton of activity going on, especially at the infra level of the stock. And there's a ton of people here and I think a ton of excitement. So it actually feels really good. It's always very nice to hang out with a bunch of very excited crypto people.
00:06:35.434 - 00:06:40.300, Speaker C: I feel kind of bad for the Parisians, but it's really fun for us.
00:06:40.670 - 00:07:00.734, Speaker A: Yeah, we've really kind of taken over the city, maybe some neighborhoods. I had a very strange experience yesterday where I was in a taxi that was stuck in traffic and there was these people biking by and scooting by. And at one point I saw Alex G. From matterlabs. He doesn't know this, but he will maybe now. Just like scootering by. And then I was like, oh, that's funny.
00:07:00.734 - 00:07:16.854, Speaker A: He's there and on the same car ride, I see Merrick from cello biking by. And then I get out of the cab and I see Jenny at Pollock just walking through and I'm just like, do we own this town at this? Yeah.
00:07:16.972 - 00:07:27.530, Speaker D: Yeah. Again, Paris has been good because there have been plenty of space and venues and everything for side know, food, reservations have been easy to get. So it's just been like a very pleasant.
00:07:27.870 - 00:07:33.260, Speaker A: And also, Uma, what you were just saying about being warned about the weather, I think that was really last year.
00:07:33.950 - 00:07:34.714, Speaker D: Last two years?
00:07:34.752 - 00:07:44.414, Speaker A: Well, 2021. I was here for that. And I didn't find it too wild. It was like, nice. It was warm. But I did hear about last year's. It was like, what, 36 degrees the whole time?
00:07:44.532 - 00:07:45.274, Speaker C: 40 degrees?
00:07:45.322 - 00:07:45.534, Speaker D: 40.
00:07:45.572 - 00:07:47.150, Speaker A: I don't know what it's in fahrenheit.
00:07:47.730 - 00:07:49.810, Speaker D: It was like 9000 plus.
00:07:49.880 - 00:07:56.334, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. In the middle of a city, and you can see it's not like. I mean, yes, if you're next to the river, it's airy. But most of the streets.
00:07:56.382 - 00:08:06.594, Speaker D: I'd gone to an event that was like, in this restaurant that had no air conditioning and it was like a greenhouse, and it must have been 115 degrees fahrenheit inside. Yeah, it was like a sauna.
00:08:06.642 - 00:08:23.614, Speaker A: So this year, everyone was warning everyone, like, oh, why would you go back there? But to me, this is what Paris in the summer is like in the past when I've been here, it's kind of nice. All right, let's crack in then, to the themes of Paris. What are people talking about here this week?
00:08:23.732 - 00:08:58.998, Speaker D: So I think everyone has a different experience. I sort of cross the world of l ones. Dfi cosmos eth dfi eth staking. I've been talking a lot about financialization of ETH staking yield and the general ETH staking stack that is being built, like, where interoperability is going, value capture. And then intents have been, which I'm sure we're going to talk a lot about. The intent apocalypse is continuing, by the.
00:08:59.004 - 00:09:26.446, Speaker A: Way, as you describe the scenes that you're in. It reminds me, when I was younger, I was in a lot of different music scenes. So I was in, like, the house scene, the drumming bass scene, the indie rock scene, the electro scene. This is very dating me to a certain era in time. And my favorite thing about it was I would go from party to party in one night, and it would be like just a different vibe. Do you feel like that's kind of similar? You're going to these different conferences, different dinners. You get to wear a different hat.
00:09:26.446 - 00:09:30.066, Speaker A: Can you give some texture to that? What are the different crowds like?
00:09:30.168 - 00:10:12.654, Speaker D: Well, so ETH staking has revived. DeFi has sort of made a comeback, I think, at this point in the year, and it's basically been revived by ETH staking yield and different things you can do with ETH staking yield. In the past, in other events this year, people hadn't really wanted to talk about was actually. I found that people wanted to talk more about applications in general in Europe than in the US, like EtH Prague, it was the same way. It was like people were, but it's even more now. Yeah. And then the infrastructure scene is somewhat distinct from applications, defi, et cetera, which.
00:10:12.692 - 00:10:27.842, Speaker A: Is more vibrant right now because there's sort of this. I mean, I've seen criticism that we spent so much time on infrastructure and almost, like, not enough time on application. There's not enough users, not enough things for people to do. I don't know, maybe I'm not in those circles enough.
00:10:27.976 - 00:10:47.926, Speaker D: I think one of the things that's been exciting is just like in Cosmos, a lot of new applications have been launching, so the application space has gotten a lot more exciting. I think in general, applications are coming back. Is kind of like a theme, I would say, but there's limits to it, right? There's only so many things you can build on top of each staking yield.
00:10:48.038 - 00:11:27.202, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the themes I've seen is, as Zaki mentioned, staking and then also restaking. A lot of people are pretty excited about Eigen layer and what restaking will do and the design space it opens and the new stuff it brings. It's also funny being here with Zaki, who's from OG Cosmos, and seeing kind of a lot of those themes and visions around app chains and shared security. But it's all coming to life on Ethereum as well with app roll ups. Now everything is basically an l two. Every app has their own l two. And then, yeah, you obviously have shared security with Eigen layer and restaking.
00:11:27.202 - 00:11:33.082, Speaker C: So, yeah. How do you feel about that, to see the cosmos vision, kind of copy paste it?
00:11:33.136 - 00:12:08.390, Speaker D: Well, my vision related to Ethereum has always been not to kill Ethereum, but to cosmosify Ethereum, because I've always thought what Ethereum should be is basically cosmos. But part of the goal in building Cosmos is to lay the rail tracks that Ethereum would travel. And I think over the last two years, we've really seen Ethereum start to travel those. So I kind of view the roll ups, the roll up stacks, especially more open source roll up stacks, app roll ups, restaking with Eigen layer as like, the cosmosification of Ethereum.
00:12:08.730 - 00:13:01.810, Speaker C: Yeah, very much agreed. And then I think also another interesting theme we've talked a lot about is interoperability, especially in this very multi roll up world, the interoperability situation is kind of a mess. And then you see, for example, with Cosmos, you guys thought ahead about that, and you put it in protocol called the IBC. And then I think in the roll up world, there has also been a lot of talk about putting interop in protocol, because they are starting to realize it will be a huge problem. And I think you see this with, like, Polygon's Zkevm l two roadmap, where they have this unified liquidity layer for their new pole token across all their roll ups. That's basically going in protocol to their Zkevm roll up stack. There's been some talk or proposal of doing something similar with shared validity for op stack and maybe other ecosystems.
00:13:01.810 - 00:13:08.018, Speaker C: But yeah, I've heard the words unified liquidity a lot, which I interpret as putting interoperability in protocol.
00:13:08.114 - 00:13:16.762, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the Ethereum people have a lot to learn from the cosmos experience, which the unified liquidity is not nearly as unified as you think.
00:13:16.896 - 00:13:37.058, Speaker A: It's so funny because you highlight sort of the Cosmos Ethereum connection, but I can't help but also bring up the polka dot connection because what I see is like, 2017, 2018 polka dot and Cosmos were kind of in a similar space, but they were distinct. They were really distinct in their vision. And what I see is, like, Ethereum is now both of them.
00:13:37.224 - 00:13:38.274, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:13:38.472 - 00:13:53.046, Speaker A: And Cosmos took on a little bit of, I think, the Polkadot with the ICS stuff, and I think Polkadot took on a little bit of the cosmos with the XCM stuff. But then you see all of those ideas being really brought to light with.
00:13:53.068 - 00:14:00.460, Speaker D: Liquidity in and Polkadot now supports. So, you know, Cosmos and Polkadot are the same thing.
00:14:01.150 - 00:14:01.658, Speaker A: Good.
00:14:01.744 - 00:14:02.138, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:02.224 - 00:14:39.046, Speaker A: Those two projects had at their start the vision for this. In the Ethereum's case, it's like adoption post launch, post being very live, but with a lot more mind share. And I feel like it's. I mean, at least in this snapshot in time, it feels like it's very powerful because you have so many people looking at it and working on it. But do we think there's also openings for chaos because it's kind of piecemeal, like there is no larger architecture, there is no IBC. Yeah, I guess the ZK roll up might be. I don't know.
00:14:39.148 - 00:15:15.890, Speaker D: It shocks and horrifies me that every single roll up is writing their own bridge contract. Why is this not the same bridge contract? And then the validity or fraud proof piece is just swapped based on what your roll up is doing? Right. It's insane. Conversations about security have been a big part of this for me, too. There's been a lot of industry wide conversations about security as a huge gaining factor also at this event. And it seems like only a matter of time before there's a major bridge hack in the ethereum roll up ecosystem. There's been so many near misses.
00:15:16.390 - 00:15:26.294, Speaker C: Really? That's interesting because I think the roll up narrative is all about, oh, this is so much more secure. We're inheriting security our bridge is totally safe. So I'm curious, what makes you say.
00:15:26.332 - 00:15:58.110, Speaker D: That roll ups architectures enable in a future in which you can have stronger bridges, that do more things, that enforce more properties than, let's say, the light client model of IBC. But that reality, we are nowhere close to it. And so I think that the reality is that there's a lot of fragility in the cryptography layers of these bridges, in the software stack, especially on the ZK side. There's a lot of agility in the smart contracts.
00:15:59.650 - 00:16:48.014, Speaker A: I'm not sure if you know this, you probably know this Uma, but I don't know if you know this, Zaki. The fact that there's kind of a huge conversation going on right now in ZK about security and that exact thing, like each one of these systems potentially using different systems. So it's different types of roll ups, different types of using. You're. Yes, you're auditing them with a pretty small group of auditors who can even handle this tools to audit that are still being developed, not quite there, and they're going to start having a lot of value attached to them. I'm nervous that there is something that happens in one of these EVM, kind of ZK EVM thing, where it's kind of disastrous and it casts shade on the whole scene. It's definitely something I'm worried about, and I don't really know what to do about it.
00:16:48.212 - 00:17:52.610, Speaker C: Well, I think Vitalik has a really good pragmatic take on this, which he, I think him and maybe Justin Drake have written about this on ETH research, where they really advocate for two factor kind of authentication for ZK roll up. So you have the ZK proof, maybe you even have multiple proofs, and then you also have some sort of tee or SGX based solution. One really interesting thing is, I know flashbots is really interested in using SGX for suave, and they're doing a lot of work there, and so I think they're going to do a lot of work there. And I think SGX will become, I know it's controversial, but in the short term at least, will become a good kind of two factor stopgap for a lot of these security issues. And then I think one really nice thing about ZK is that at the end of the day, these ZK circuits are just functions, right? They're like f of x equals y. There's a really clear spec. And so compared to a smart contract, actually, for a ZK circuit, you can have many different implementations, because the spec is so well specified and it's a pure function, whereas for a DeFi protocol like Euler or something, there's state.
00:17:52.610 - 00:18:09.142, Speaker C: So it's hard to imagine how a two factor would really work there. But for ZK, you can have many different implementations. I kind of view it as like client diversity, and I think that's something that also, the ZK industry, maybe they're not talking about it a lot. I've heard it a little bit, but I think will become more prevalent and more important.
00:18:09.276 - 00:18:46.530, Speaker A: So I had a conversation recently with an auditor on the show, and we talked about under constrained CK systems, which is like, that's a place where a vulnerability can happen, but that sometimes teams will do that because they're sort of like, there's going to be some sort of validator set that's going to make choices about governance and about upgrades, about stuff like that. So there is some backstop that is supposed to be decentralized, but that means they can be a little bit more loose and fast with some of the constraint stuff. I don't know if that still doesn't make me feel super confident.
00:18:47.430 - 00:19:49.074, Speaker C: I do think as someone who has deployed like a ZK protocol to production, like our protocol or ZK, like client is running in production, honestly, running it in production feels a lot better to me than having to manage the keys of a multi sig, because you have that math encryptography. So, yes, while thinking about circuit security is stressful, I think the alternative is that, oh, you have, I don't know, some, maybe three out of five multi sig, you have to worry about keeping the keys safe. You have to worry about who has access to your AWS account or wherever you're running it, you have to worry about not losing the keys. And so I think compared to the trade off, actually, if you just even viscerally feel it deploying a system, it feels a lot better than just like a pure multi sig. And I do think it's important to not be purists. I think it's important to have both kind of like this validator set plus ZK, or like ZK plus all these methods. Security is very additive, and I think that's important to be okay with and think it's valuable.
00:19:49.202 - 00:20:14.638, Speaker A: I actually want to talk a little bit about the big announcement by gnosis, because I'm just curious, like, gnosis released this gnosis pay, and I know that succinct is now it's deployed right. It's part of the bridge. It's not the full bridge. This is what I kind of learned recently. It's like there's a number of multi SIG signers, but now succinct. A ZK agent is one of them. Are you also involved in the new product?
00:20:14.804 - 00:20:33.426, Speaker C: I actually don't know too much about gnosispay. I think it's super cool. I think it is like, one of those applications that we really need. So I'm really excited they're working on it. And personally, we use gnosis chain a lot as our testnet, so I really like using the chain. But, yeah, we are involved. Sysinct isn't involved in securing the gnosis bridge.
00:20:33.426 - 00:20:52.570, Speaker C: So, like, die is locked up on Ethereum. It's minted as XDI. That's like the gas token on gnosis. And then we help secure that through our zklike client. But, yeah, gnosis pay, from my understanding, is like an l two on top of gnosis to make it even cheaper. But, yeah, it seems really cool product wise. I want to try it out.
00:20:52.640 - 00:21:03.826, Speaker A: Yeah. Zucky, you and I got kind of, like, pilled by gnosis. Pilled. Last time, Frederica was telling us all the stuff they were doing, and we're like, how is it that you're doing all of these things?
00:21:03.928 - 00:21:37.462, Speaker D: The infrastructure that they've built seems like a breakthrough. The ability to actually have something that you can use at a payment terminal, like just boop your credit card, boop your phone, and have a signature get relayed through an account abstraction. Basically, you're integrating account abstraction directly into the payment infrastructure, which is just such an amazing piece of infrastructure building from the best infrastructure building team in the game, which has been gnosis.
00:21:37.526 - 00:21:44.718, Speaker A: Cool. Any other themes, maybe? Themes even, like, outside of what you normally pay attention to?
00:21:44.884 - 00:22:05.926, Speaker C: I think it's been so reinforced that l two s are the new thing. I think in ethereum world, like, so many people have adopted the op stack, they're making their own roll ups. Especially in the infrastructure world. It just feels more and more consensus that building your own l two is like the way to go, which is very interesting.
00:22:06.028 - 00:22:24.778, Speaker D: I mean, it's been interesting. In 2019, the exchanges were all adopting the Cosmos SDK to build their exchange chains. And now the story is mantle and bybit and base both doing op stack is.
00:22:24.864 - 00:22:38.446, Speaker A: Op stack is the new Cosmos SDK. Okay, it is. But as we say this, all the other big l two projects, I mean, doesn't ZK sync have a new thing coming out?
00:22:38.468 - 00:22:40.046, Speaker C: Arbitrum probably is going to do it.
00:22:40.068 - 00:22:40.494, Speaker D: Yes.
00:22:40.612 - 00:22:46.254, Speaker A: Arbitrary created a Cosmos SDK substrate, whatever. Like this building environment framework.
00:22:46.302 - 00:22:47.970, Speaker D: There's a building environment framework?
00:22:48.390 - 00:22:50.798, Speaker A: A roll kit, I guess, falls under that category.
00:22:50.894 - 00:23:13.046, Speaker D: Yes. Which brings the Cosmos SDK to Celestial. Well, to roll ups in general. Okay, that's very much the narrative here. But DydX chain is the other side of this, which is an l two, which was an early adopter of an l two, which said, I've gone to the limits of what we can do in the l two world, and now we need a Cosmos chain.
00:23:13.158 - 00:23:37.778, Speaker C: Well, also, I think another theme that we haven't talked about is speaking of the limits of the l two world. I think there's a lot of da layers that are popular right now. Celestia avail. I know espresso, I think, is also Eigen DA is another one. Yeah, espresso is also going to make their own DA layer. And really, the true cost of making a roll up on Ethereum is putting your da on Ethereum. That is the main cost.
00:23:37.778 - 00:23:48.326, Speaker C: And yeah, there seems to be a ton of new solutions for DA for these validiums that are settled to Ethereum, have their off chain da, which I think is pretty interesting.
00:23:48.508 - 00:24:02.762, Speaker D: What I would say about that. I think another theme that I've seen on this event and in the future, in other events this year is the block space surplus theme. We have so much more block space.
00:24:02.816 - 00:24:04.282, Speaker A: Now than we thought we would then.
00:24:04.336 - 00:24:15.390, Speaker D: Demand is for sure. You have these roll ups as a service. You have these alt Da layers. We can produce petabytes of block space. Right. Like so much block space. Now.
00:24:15.390 - 00:24:21.710, Speaker D: No one has a good answer really, for what's going to consume that. The recurring theme is gaming.
00:24:22.290 - 00:24:24.174, Speaker A: You need something that uses a lot.
00:24:24.292 - 00:24:29.950, Speaker D: The games are going to come and the games are going to rescue us from the boxplace surplus.
00:24:30.110 - 00:24:51.594, Speaker A: It's so funny, I have heard from other people that there is so much happening in games. I don't know if I've just been at the wrong events or looked in the wrong direction at a certain time. For some reason, it has not hit my radar correctly. I've seen cool experiments, or maybe this is something I should be exploring on the show. I feel like maybe there's just places I've not been looking.
00:24:51.712 - 00:25:08.958, Speaker D: On the gaming front, I think one of the biggest things that we in the blockchain space don't really appreciate is how much bigger gaming is. Gamescon, which is going to be in Cologne in Germany in like a month. That's like 400,000 people.
00:25:09.124 - 00:25:10.270, Speaker C: Oh my God.
00:25:10.420 - 00:26:09.522, Speaker D: Right? We are like, oh, we're like, our 10,000 blockchain people showed up at Paris and we took over the city. And like a GDC or a Gamescon or these things are like orders of magnitude larger. So I think one of the things that is interesting about the gaming stuff, and there seems to be quite a bit of innovation, and there's projects in the cosmos ecosystem that are going like saga and Argus that are going after these markets, and they don't make a big splash here because what's the point? It's not like D five, where a couple of hundred accounts can move $100 million. Gaming is like the long tail of users. So if it works, it's not going to be because we convinced the crypto people to use this. It's like we went to Gamescon, we went to that gamer audience, we got on people's xboxes, we got on people's phones, and that onboarded it.
00:26:09.576 - 00:26:44.682, Speaker A: Except sadly, right at this very moment, the word crypto in gaming, in gaming land, apparently is quite tainted. I don't think they like it. I think they find it quite yucky. And yeah, I think for that to happen. The thing is, the marriage makes so much sense because those games are creating their own economies anyways. Like, they're creating these little inner game trading all this stuff, and it can get kind of sophisticated, and it's totally just living on one company's servers. It's kind of ridiculous.
00:26:44.682 - 00:26:59.060, Speaker A: The users don't own it. The game shuts down at some point. People have put so much time and energy into this, it's quite sad. It's like having a career that at some point is just taken away from you. I mean, gaming is maybe not the healthiest, but you know what I mean?
00:26:59.590 - 00:27:03.380, Speaker C: It's like people time into it and it's kind of crazy.
00:27:03.990 - 00:27:24.202, Speaker A: But at the same time, I think crypto went too far on the other side. It was like, let's gamify it and pay you immediately. And you're just going to mine and farm and do these things in game just to get immediate tokens. And it was just such an immature model. You need an economy, you need a community, you need people who give a shit about what you're of.
00:27:24.256 - 00:27:42.160, Speaker D: A lot of feedback that similia has gotten from investors is that we should be gamifying it aggressively. And I felt that it's too early. Trust is more important than like, I am thinking also of things we could do.
00:27:42.770 - 00:27:48.770, Speaker A: Although gamifying what you're talking about sounds more like gamifying Robin Hood or something. It's like you're gamifying financial.
00:27:49.110 - 00:27:50.510, Speaker D: Robin is quite gamified.
00:27:50.590 - 00:28:02.934, Speaker A: But I think of games proper and they hate crypto, but the combination is so inevitable, and yet, yeah, they have this sort of bad taste in their mouth that we need to fix.
00:28:03.052 - 00:28:44.658, Speaker C: Yeah, they hate crypto now, but I feel like all this stuff, they'll like crypto when it has its time in the sun again. So I feel like they're sent in general, I've seen this, I live in San Francisco and I go to parties and I tell people I work in crypto, and I get these horrified looks. Honestly, people are quite rude about, like, oh, what is crypto? But then you just know that all these people, whenever crypto takes off again, they'll be like, oh, my God, crypto is amazing. And in general, I feel like the outside sentiment tracks crypto's adoption quite closely. So I'm sure they can have their mind changed or I'm very optimistic about that.
00:28:44.744 - 00:29:33.060, Speaker D: So what worries me about is the blockchain surplus is arriving today, like now. Right? Like, Celestia is launching soon, eigenver is launching soon. This massive surplus is coming right now. I believe gaming can work, but it has to be a little bit more organic. You can't just knock out a partnership with some giant game dev company or some giant publisher like Activision or whatever, and be like, oh, we've just produced enough transaction volume to fill the blocks. Right. I mean, I've been following what's been happening on swee, right? And right now, oh, they have this very simple mobile phone puzzle game that is producing an enormous amount of transaction volume, and it's great.
00:29:33.060 - 00:29:45.574, Speaker D: They have an enormous amount of box space, and they have to find something to do it. And they've created a little game that does it, and they have tokenized incentives and they've gamified things and stuff like that.
00:29:45.692 - 00:29:50.402, Speaker A: But it's still short term. It feels very short term, like mobile games. Yeah.
00:29:50.476 - 00:30:05.738, Speaker D: Whereas what teams like Argus and topology and I'm sure there are lots of others, lattice, Keystone, I think also. Yeah, there's like, all of these teams are really trying to build authentic experiences.
00:30:05.914 - 00:30:56.714, Speaker A: The thing about that authentic experience, though, I feel like what has to happen is it's so hard to work in the short term mentality of, like, create company, get investors, get return in x years, short term, that kind of thing. If you really had the blockchain native game growing over time, you'd have to have people doing it for nothing for a really long time. And genuinely having people who are just like, into it, because this is sort of the going back to my music scenes or whatever. It was very indie. It was very like, you had to have people who were genuinely into it because that was what made it cool. And it took a long, and it's almost like the longer it was underground and before becoming cool, the more backstory you had. I mean, I could actually give something closer to blockchain.
00:30:56.714 - 00:31:31.322, Speaker A: It's like the crypto anarchists, the bitcoin early people, they worked under the radar for many, many years before they were recognized. And I think that legacy adds sort of like strength to a community. And in the environment we're in right now, you want the big hit real quick, then you sell out immediately. You're going to get the pressure to gamify so quickly, and then you don't have any of that backstory. You don't have the legend, you don't have the Messiah who disappears. You don't have any of that.
00:31:31.376 - 00:31:43.040, Speaker D: Yeah, a lot of the stuff is descended from the dark Forest team, which does have a little of that organic mythology that definitely descended from the dark Forest team, right?
00:31:44.770 - 00:31:59.794, Speaker A: I mean, they did some nfTs, but I don't think they never monetized. They monetized by starting companies well and do Xerox park. And that's so kind of giving. It's very altruistic, I feel still, it's about kind of like funding other people.
00:31:59.912 - 00:32:19.190, Speaker D: What I will also just say about the gaming stuff is I do think that we're going to have. I think there are applications coming that can, like gnosis, pay, like gaming, that can actually consume this massive amount of block space that we've created. But I think there's a gap.
00:32:19.350 - 00:32:27.050, Speaker A: I want to bring it back for a minute to Paris. What was the best talk that you've seen?
00:32:27.200 - 00:32:45.010, Speaker D: I am going to more talks at the latter half of the week because there's a lot of cosmos stuff. So I'm doing osmocon modular nebula, which are all sort of cosmos adjacent. And so I'll go to more talks there. Ethland, I didn't go to that many talks.
00:32:45.910 - 00:33:00.870, Speaker C: There was a lot of panels, which I think I find pretty interesting because it feels like more interactive, more live, like more fresh, more spicy, also. So Mev Day was actually just all panels and yeah, those were really fun, but it wasn't like talks.
00:33:01.210 - 00:33:35.290, Speaker D: I did some of the talks for DeFi security summit, which was like, there were some really good talks about trying to improve the way we interact with audits. How hard is it to know what code actually got audited. There was a really good talk on that. Yeah, DeFi security summit, I think was like one of the sleeper events that some subset of the population got to but didn't get hyped up. There were no big fancy announcements, but a lot of conversations about security in Paris.
00:33:35.450 - 00:34:24.094, Speaker A: One of my favorite talks actually happened today at CK. So we're recording this on the Thursday ZK. Paris was happening today. This is an event that the ZK validator and geometry put together, so I'm biased, but Kobe did this little intro at the beginning, sort of showing what a user in 2020, I think it was 24 or 25, could do using some of the tools in the ZK stack and the different things that you could be doing if you wanted to win at Dark Forest. I think that was his model and it was this really useful image to just see what a user would need to do. And then also you still see like, okay, there's a lot of clicks, you're kind of going through it. Are there ways to even make that more efficient? And I feel like it was a beautiful picture if that happens.
00:34:24.094 - 00:34:43.814, Speaker A: A lot of the companies he referenced are like companies that are building right now. So those products don't exist yet. Those products might. They might pivot. We don't know if they're going to be used in the way they're expected. But even to have that, I hadn't actually seen anything like that at all in the ZK space ever. So anyway, we're going to have a video for it soon, but I loved it.
00:34:43.852 - 00:35:18.078, Speaker D: I think another thing has been account Abstraction seems to be really breaking through. Like Vitala gave a talk about it, but I think we have to come up with something new to call it, which may be just intense, which might be better branding, but these sort of know augmented. A big is a big part of it. And the too many clicks problem, the too much waiting. Ux, I think has also been like a big. There's probably more of a focus on Ux now than I think, than in previous eras of blockchains.
00:35:18.254 - 00:35:41.210, Speaker C: Yeah, strongly agree with that. I have heard a lot of stuff about account abstraction and then also the ux of interop. And I think everyone is kind of now on the same page that it really sucks. Like it needs fixing. Whether that's like putting it in protocol or using account abstraction or whatever to fix that, I think has been definitely another theme, which I think is really positive for actually getting real adoption.
00:35:41.550 - 00:35:49.530, Speaker A: All right, we did best talk. What about best party? Could be best party, best crowd, but it could also be, like, best venue.
00:35:49.870 - 00:35:52.586, Speaker D: I mean, the food has been amazing.
00:35:52.688 - 00:35:54.846, Speaker A: In Paris, just generally across the board.
00:35:54.948 - 00:36:14.702, Speaker D: I didn't go to any of the catacombs parties, but those were pretty the. I saw the photos, but there were a bunch of, you know, Paris is generally, I think, a pretty good city with a lot of good venues in it. And I think we've had a lot of classy, less generic blockchain events.
00:36:14.846 - 00:36:28.994, Speaker C: I love how in Paris, you can be walking around, doing a walking meeting. You turn the corner, and there's this very historic, very beautiful, amazing building, and you're like, oh, my God. And you didn't know about it, and it's literally every corner.
00:36:29.122 - 00:36:34.170, Speaker A: So there was a party I'd wanted to go to but didn't make, which was in the Eiffel Tower.
00:36:34.510 - 00:36:37.958, Speaker C: The Zkon conference tomorrow is in the Eiffel Tower.
00:36:38.054 - 00:36:54.526, Speaker A: Whoa. That's where. I mean, I've been around it in the past. I've not gone up to it in a really long time, but I was like, oh, my God, there's something you can do in it. But I didn't make it. I did go to the Eigen layered drinks dinner, which had a view. It was amazing.
00:36:54.526 - 00:37:03.918, Speaker A: The venue was fine, but the view from the venue was like the river and the Eiffel Tower, and it was all green and it was blue sky. It was just incredible.
00:37:04.014 - 00:37:07.250, Speaker D: I mean, because I got here early, I got to do Bastille day in Paris.
00:37:07.770 - 00:37:10.882, Speaker A: Oh, the Bastille day, yeah. This is their big celebration.
00:37:10.946 - 00:37:30.022, Speaker D: Their big celebration. They do, like, huge fireworks show in front of the Eiffel Tower. The French take fireworks very seriously. They budget for fireworks at the federal level. It is a matter of honor that the Paris Bastille day fireworks show be ridiculous.
00:37:30.166 - 00:37:31.900, Speaker A: Wait, someone just walked in.
00:37:32.350 - 00:37:33.590, Speaker D: In a puff of smoke.
00:37:33.670 - 00:37:36.960, Speaker A: In a puff of smoke. We didn't say his name three times, but we could have.
00:37:37.570 - 00:37:46.206, Speaker E: We're not in New York, which is a city that is literally covered in smoke. We.
00:37:46.308 - 00:37:47.806, Speaker A: No, but not anymore.
00:37:47.998 - 00:38:22.074, Speaker E: Not just Canada, who I think we need some reparations from. Personally, I distinctly think the US deserves reparations from Canada for all this smoke. But secondly, no, New York is in this very weird state with weed legalization, where the state fucked up and they didn't come up with the licensing agreements, which was the tax law for how to split the revenue. Then basically, they said it wouldn't be illegal for six months to be unlicensed and sell weed. And there's been this mad frenzy to buy any retail space and turn it into a smoke shop.
00:38:22.112 - 00:38:22.614, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:38:22.672 - 00:38:26.078, Speaker E: But also the smoke shops are all selling general.
00:38:26.164 - 00:38:26.682, Speaker A: Oh, dear.
00:38:26.746 - 00:38:35.086, Speaker E: So it's like. It's like everything went from, like everything was illegal to nothing is illegal in a very large city overnight. So it's been kind of crazy.
00:38:35.188 - 00:38:39.140, Speaker A: So welcome to the show, Tarune. Very nice intro there.
00:38:39.670 - 00:38:42.690, Speaker E: I'm sure it had a lot to do with the rest of the episode.
00:38:43.430 - 00:38:49.698, Speaker A: We had not been talking about New York. We had actually been talking about Paris. But, yeah. Welcome. It's nice to meet you.
00:38:49.784 - 00:38:50.482, Speaker E: Great to be here.
00:38:50.536 - 00:39:02.618, Speaker A: Just to kind of bring you up to date on what we've been talking about, we have done a little bit of a Paris recap, talked about some of the themes. But now I'm really curious. What's your Paris recap now that you're here?
00:39:02.784 - 00:39:21.840, Speaker E: I read somewhere that someone wrote this on Twitter, but I thought it was a great summary, which is like, the future of crypto is off chain is like, a lot of the announcements have been like, pseudo off chain stuff. There are things that are on chain components, but they're, like, unsettled on chain, but there's a lot of off chain logic around them.
00:39:22.290 - 00:39:25.390, Speaker A: That's probably so true for the short term.
00:39:25.730 - 00:40:01.350, Speaker D: I've been thinking about it. I think a theme of the talks I'm doing later in the week is that kind of, we figured out a lot of the limits of the on chain pieces and pre consensus, peer to peer layer, order flow, intent, dissemination, all of these things are like the future. And so, yes, I agree with that. Take trying to do the off chain things, but get them to be decentralized, to get them to be constrained, to get them to be secure, I think is a big. Because the past of crypto is off chain too, which is like everybody uses centralized exchanges.
00:40:01.430 - 00:40:37.254, Speaker E: I'm going to posit a spicy question for you. From my perspective, at least, it's spicy, which is the idea of doing a lot more off chain logic that settles or has some proof of correctness on chain is actually really bad for the Cosmos app chain thesis because in some ways, the chain itself needs to be as secure as possible for the settlement layer. You can't have, like 500 chains with varying levels of security and doing all this off chain logic and treating it at one to one on many different chains. Right. Like doing the same thing on different apps. The bullcase for Polkadot, bullcase for roll ups in some sense. Right.
00:40:37.254 - 00:40:52.140, Speaker E: Because they're still going back. But, yeah. How do you feel about that? Do you think the off chain version of the world impacts the pure app chain. I call them the pure and adulterated app chain theses. The adulterated one is the roll up one because it's not the true.
00:40:52.610 - 00:41:09.074, Speaker D: One of the things, though, that we've seen right now is that the people who are like, flexing decentralized off chain the hardest are like people like Dyx who needed the Cosmos stack in order to decentralize the off chain components that no one else could give them how to.
00:41:09.272 - 00:41:12.478, Speaker C: But isn't their order matching still done off chain?
00:41:12.574 - 00:41:41.674, Speaker D: Yes, that's what I'm saying. And they're using the cosmos stack to facilitate decentralizing that off chain system. I think there's some version of the app chain future that is becoming less relevant because of moving to this intent centric world and stuff like that. But you have a lot of people building, like, they need a toolkit for building decentralized off chain pieces, and the Cosmos toolkit becomes very relevant there.
00:41:41.872 - 00:41:48.890, Speaker A: Can I ask you one of the questions? We just were talking about best party, and that can be because of crowd or location.
00:41:49.050 - 00:41:52.894, Speaker E: Honestly, maybe it's because I've been in this industry long enough now.
00:41:52.932 - 00:41:54.402, Speaker A: No parties are good for you.
00:41:54.456 - 00:42:14.280, Speaker E: I kind of am. Like, all crypto people kind of have shitty parties. Like, I feel like the NFT was bad rage was a scourge on this industry because it allowed people to go for the least common denominator, where they went for the shittiest anything as long as it was golden looking.
00:42:17.050 - 00:42:19.002, Speaker A: Don't you think the tide went out with that?
00:42:19.056 - 00:42:40.240, Speaker E: I don't think the party planning event planners have adjusted. I think they're still living and throwing these parties as if it's like, it feels like pre NFT boom was a different universe then trashiness and Miami ness was like, kind of somehow became acceptable everywhere, always.
00:42:40.690 - 00:42:46.078, Speaker A: Were you at the blockchain conference in New York in 2018?
00:42:46.174 - 00:42:49.374, Speaker E: Yeah, when Arthur Hayes showed up with Lambo.
00:42:49.422 - 00:42:53.602, Speaker A: So I don't know what you're talking about exactly. Was it classy? Because I do not remember.
00:42:53.656 - 00:43:09.074, Speaker E: No, but this is theoretically a developer conference, right? Main net and consensus are like money conferences, right? Money conferences have been trashy since the beginning of history. That's almost their definition.
00:43:09.202 - 00:43:09.974, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:10.172 - 00:43:15.046, Speaker E: But developer conferences being trashy only really was accelerated by NFT.
00:43:15.158 - 00:43:29.630, Speaker A: Okay, this is a bit of a question. I really don't mean this in a bad way, but it's like, is ECC still a developer conference mean? I think there's deeper technical conferences happening around it. I just don't know if it's there.
00:43:29.780 - 00:43:46.966, Speaker C: I can't say because I haven't been to ETHC, but I feel like all the events and side events we've been to have been very developer focused. So yes, there's literally not one app specific side event that I felt like was super popular. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not.
00:43:46.988 - 00:43:58.840, Speaker E: Sure I totally agree with that. I think that Paris still has a lot of nebulous stuff like web3 fashion shit. And there was tons of parties of that form.
00:43:59.310 - 00:44:02.170, Speaker C: I was not invited to the web3 fashion parties.
00:44:03.310 - 00:44:15.818, Speaker E: And there's a lot of that type of stuff that I think those of us who are focused on adding numbers instead of adding apes are kind of avoid on purpose.
00:44:15.914 - 00:44:23.758, Speaker A: I feel like, is there anyone here who's into apes? Actually? You lived in New York, man. You were like the closest to this thing.
00:44:23.844 - 00:44:35.220, Speaker E: I know. This is why I'm saying I can see across the chasm of, like, this exists and we're all very oblivious because these things are happening, but we're just like, not.
00:44:36.070 - 00:44:38.420, Speaker A: Do you think we're sliding towards it, though?
00:44:38.790 - 00:44:49.510, Speaker E: No, I just think that the trash. Remember, the event planners for these things are shared and a lot of them are picking the same venues. They're picking the same whatever. Fucking shit, DJ.
00:44:50.410 - 00:44:52.918, Speaker A: It's not shit on the event planners, man. I'm an event planner.
00:44:52.934 - 00:44:54.106, Speaker E: No, hard.
00:44:54.288 - 00:44:59.882, Speaker A: All right, sorry, hard. You're trying to do events in different cities, like all over the world.
00:44:59.936 - 00:45:09.470, Speaker E: I agree. Yeah, that's fair. Sorry, I didn't mean to give them a hard time as much as the fact that there's a lot of repeated effort.
00:45:09.810 - 00:45:15.970, Speaker A: Okay, now I have a more superficial question. What was the best swag on that theme?
00:45:17.270 - 00:45:41.062, Speaker E: I find swag cringe. There's actually like, one amazing answer, one amazing party I went to where they said you're not allowed to wear any company logos, t shirts or whatever, and there still were people doing that. Wow. I thought that was funny to me. I was like, wow. It became like the burned band book.
00:45:41.116 - 00:45:42.614, Speaker A: Okay, so you just dissed swag.
00:45:42.662 - 00:45:48.700, Speaker D: But wait, I was planning on going to that party, but then I got back to my hotel room to change, and then I went to.
00:45:51.870 - 00:46:02.766, Speaker A: But can I still ask the question to the non swag hater? I think if teams are trying, that's cool. Uma and I've seen a. Socks are.
00:46:02.788 - 00:46:07.162, Speaker D: Always handy and useful for sure. Water bottles always handy and useful.
00:46:07.226 - 00:46:07.466, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:07.508 - 00:46:30.450, Speaker E: I take it back. There's actually one swag piece that I thought was very on point and very good. Which was at Mev day, which is hosted by Frontier. There was a sunscreen from Mev protect, and I thought that was just, like, both useful, so brand accretive and not trashy in that you look like you're in San Francisco.
00:46:30.530 - 00:46:44.446, Speaker A: I didn't actually see this for real, but I saw on Twitter with some random Twitter person. They tweeted, like, what was it? What are they like here in France? The little colorful macaron with scroll on it. That was cool. I like that.
00:46:44.628 - 00:46:45.022, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:45.076 - 00:46:47.914, Speaker D: Food is ECc did its soap.
00:46:48.042 - 00:46:52.990, Speaker A: Oh, soap. Okay. And I think, wait, we saw a really good one. Um, and I saw a good one.
00:46:53.060 - 00:47:02.130, Speaker C: There was these Eigen lair, Nike, air force ones that had the eigen layer logo on it. Yeah, Tarun's cringing, but I thought it was really cool.
00:47:02.280 - 00:47:09.122, Speaker A: I thought it was cool, too. You know why it was cool? Because it just looked like cool design. And you did not notice the logo until you looked closely.
00:47:09.186 - 00:47:24.810, Speaker E: It was actually saw. I saw someone from angler with it, and I think as long as the one I saw had no text. But then I saw a picture online that looked like it had text. And you don't want that. The text is like, a little too.
00:47:24.880 - 00:47:29.546, Speaker A: The thing is, if you have no text, why is that company like, how.
00:47:29.568 - 00:47:31.370, Speaker E: Does the company logo. It's amazing.
00:47:31.440 - 00:47:31.814, Speaker D: Logo.
00:47:31.862 - 00:47:38.810, Speaker A: Well, just the colors you have to have. I mean, the Eigen layer words logo. It doesn't have to have the tagline.
00:47:38.890 - 00:47:46.210, Speaker E: Maybe, but, yeah, I might be the wrong person to talk about this. It's like my company gives up swag. I have absolutely nothing to do with.
00:47:46.360 - 00:47:48.546, Speaker A: Actually. Gauntlet had a cool orange cap I.
00:47:48.568 - 00:47:58.766, Speaker E: Saw, like, I never want to wear. And sorry, I know Zaki is here, sitting here wearing a piece of swag.
00:47:58.798 - 00:48:05.974, Speaker D: That he can just, you know, the sommelier swag distributor. I just have a bag of sommelier swag that I.
00:48:06.092 - 00:48:08.454, Speaker A: It's in a near bag. That's amazing.
00:48:08.572 - 00:48:37.522, Speaker D: It's in a near bag. I will also say I do feel like Eigen layer has really broken out from a momentum and branding point of view. I remember I've been a Sriram fanboy since 2018, but it's sort of interesting. My take on Eigen layer has been all of the challenges around the business value accrual product. None of these things have been solved, but we've really momentum, vibes, branding have been really strong.
00:48:37.656 - 00:48:46.222, Speaker A: But Tarun, the other day, you were telling me about some kinds of swag you really like, which are kind of like bags that middle aged women in New York would be carrying.
00:48:46.366 - 00:49:12.634, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. So I love the irony of carrying bags, although I hide the logo as much as possible. In fact, sometimes I put duct tape or the logo and I'd rather. And I like carrying bags that just look like you're going out to the beach or to yoga or to yoga or something. It feels very ironic to do that. But I think some of the best swag is candles, although you have to get good one.
00:49:12.672 - 00:49:14.326, Speaker A: I've seen those. But like cheap candles.
00:49:14.358 - 00:49:14.998, Speaker E: No, not cheap candles.
00:49:15.014 - 00:49:16.110, Speaker A: You're like, you don't want that either.
00:49:16.180 - 00:49:19.486, Speaker E: You want like a birido or something like that. You don't want some.
00:49:19.668 - 00:49:40.998, Speaker A: I'm actually sitting next to a nanoma bag. It says intent centric architecture. And actually, this is a topic we have not fully dived into on this show yet. And I feel like since we're all here, we might as well do it. We're talking about themes of the week, things that have been talked about, would you say? I know that at the research day, that was the.
00:49:41.164 - 00:49:48.018, Speaker E: Before we even talk about research day, Uma got a shout out from Brian Armstrong for her talk about intense on Twitter.
00:49:48.114 - 00:49:56.620, Speaker C: Intents are going mainstream. A public company CEO knows about intense and suave. We're really going to make it crazy.
00:49:56.990 - 00:49:59.194, Speaker A: But yeah, let's kick this off, shall we?
00:49:59.232 - 00:50:01.520, Speaker E: I mean, there's no better person to start than.
00:50:03.250 - 00:50:11.178, Speaker C: Think at. So Zaki was the original one who intent pills me. And just from a group chat, Zaki.
00:50:11.194 - 00:50:12.202, Speaker E: Is a super spreader.
00:50:12.266 - 00:50:58.398, Speaker C: So that's the thing. We've been thinking a lot about interop, better ways to deal with Interop, mostly from a security perspective, but then also from a UX perspective. And when Zaki had mentioned this intense concept, I just went down the rabbit hole. And it's one of those ideas that seems like more and more obvious in hindsight, in a way, I think you saw throughout this conference a lot of teams converging towards it. Like Uniswap X, for example. Is this intent based RFQ or request for, quote, for trades? And then I think Skip recently released this Cosmos Dex aggregator, which kind of also looks like an intent based system. So you see it across ecosystems, you see it across domains, you see it like single domain, you see it across roll up.
00:50:58.398 - 00:51:16.018, Speaker C: And so it seems like a lot of those ideas that we were even discussing, like two to three months ago at that research day where there was a talk I gave on intents and account abstraction and suave and crosschain bridging and how all those things are related and how all those things are important for UX. A lot of those visions are coming to life, which is actually really cool to see.
00:51:16.104 - 00:51:32.342, Speaker A: I have such a question here, because when you talked about the rabbit hole, because I think for a lot of people, the intent conversation, research, the rabbit hole is your was and other talks that happened on research day. So what were you looking at in building this? Who were you reading?
00:51:32.486 - 00:52:12.406, Speaker C: I think I was reading Zaki's messages and group chats. And I think also a lot of it was just, I think I was in this really interesting spot thinking a lot about interoperability. But then I think also just personally, I care a lot about UX, and we'd been thinking a lot about how existing wallets suck and existing bridges suck. And so I was just at these intersection of, like, personally, I was like, oh, my God, I have to bridge to operate my protocol, and I dread it. And then also, I work at the infralayer. So I just was thinking a lot about those ideas. And then on, it was a lot of, like, me and my co founder just getting in a room and jamming and being like, this cannot be the, like, this has to be better.
00:52:12.406 - 00:52:22.140, Speaker C: But yeah, there wasn't a lot of source material. Like, to this day, I think a lot of people ask me, oh, what should I read about intense? And yeah, I think the talk is a good start, but there isn't a lot of written material, so I hope that changes.
00:52:22.670 - 00:52:30.662, Speaker D: There is Georgios's post on the paradigm blog, which is a very good intro to intense.
00:52:30.726 - 00:52:33.758, Speaker A: This is since those talks, though, right? Since those talks, like, in the last few months.
00:52:33.844 - 00:53:13.718, Speaker D: Yes, there's Giorgios'paradigm intense blog that came out after the think. Like, if people ask where this intense conversation came from, anoma started two years ago. Like, Chris goes, who, you know, built the system that opensea used for their marketplace, which is essentially like a proto intense system. He built, uh, he was like, two years ago, Zeki intense. And I was like, I don't really know what you're talking, but, like, really, for me, what it was was the experience building sommelier, because I'd never built an end user Dap before. Like, Tom is my. So different is like, my first end user Dap.
00:53:13.718 - 00:53:34.286, Speaker D: And then we realized this enormous problem that people had, which is like, I want to use your app, but how do I bridge? Where do I go? And all the answers that we've given people are like, people can struggle their way through it. So people use the app, but you can't just expect a noise and you.
00:53:34.308 - 00:53:40.914, Speaker A: Feel like the intent centric architecture. Something like an intent would be better in a system like that, but you can't do that yet.
00:53:41.032 - 00:54:23.902, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think one of the other things that I think is intriguing about Uniswap X, which is their new RFQ system, is it very much is, in my mind, of what you could build without solving any of the researchy problems around intents. So the research problems of intents are like programmable privacy. There's like a programmable privacy problem that we don't really have a solution to. There are how do you do price discovery, how do you do multi chain settlement? Like, all those things are like the research problems of intents. And I think uniswap. I think one of the things that's intriguing about Uniswap X is just like build the thing that you don't have to solve any of those research problems to build and put that out there.
00:54:23.956 - 00:54:28.546, Speaker A: Just want to do a quick call out, because what you're talking with Chris's work, Tarun and I just did an.
00:54:28.568 - 00:54:30.418, Speaker E: Episode came out today, I think.
00:54:30.504 - 00:54:36.594, Speaker A: Yeah, or like this to. We're going to put the link to that. If people want to hear a little more of that backstory.
00:54:36.722 - 00:55:48.406, Speaker E: One thing I guess that's worth calling out about this is intents do feel like the first piece of infrastructure that people care about from purely UX reasons versus some theoretical efficiency gain reason. Most things that people have always proposed infrastructure wise are like efficiency gain, or it's cheaper, gas wise, or it's easier to do XYZ action. But I think the interesting thing about the intent architecture in some ways, is it has a lot of empirical proof that it works, even though the empirical proof it works is not the one that people would cite. People usually would cite the fact that zero X, which still runs rfQs, non controversially, has done significantly less volume than non intent based systems and dexes. And so people always point out that as something not working. But the fact that Opensea worked for many years is a much better signal that this is an architecture that people like. Now, one interesting thing about Chris is I feel like he did not come up with this architecture for UX reasons.
00:55:48.406 - 00:56:24.742, Speaker E: He came up with it for completely opposing reasons. In fact, his research day talk gives his philosophical reasons for why he thinks this architecture is the best. And it's exactly almost anti UX. He has, like an example in that talk of a problem that finding a fixed point of a particular system and finding a fixed point of that system is actually like a very hard computational complexity problem. It's like the opposite of UX. So it's funny how something that started for pure reasons is actually now being co opted for UX reasons, but perhaps that's a much better way of getting it built.
00:56:24.876 - 00:57:08.654, Speaker C: UX is the go to market for, I think. I do think it does help with scalability. Like, I feel like a lot of the reasons Uniswap X or the Uniswap people cited, they did. Uniswap X was for moving a lot of the computation off chain and saving users gas costs and things like that. And the RFQ system implicitly does do this, right? Because you have these sophisticated actors who are the fillers or the quoters who are monitoring the price on binance or wherever else, and they're very sophisticated, they're quoting you a price and they're doing a lot of off chain logic. So I do actually think it does help quite significantly with scalability and basically leveraging off chain compute to do on chain settlement.
00:57:08.782 - 00:58:07.238, Speaker D: A lot of the problems that we'll get are, I think, going to be the key features of sort of blockchain development in the next three years have not previously really been hyped up. I think a lot of the problems are going to be things like, oh, how do you do exception handling? How do you do this bridge, the chain halted, or the bridge halted, or the keys disappeared. How do you deal with exception handling? How do you deal with routing? Like, hey, my portfolio, I hold this set of assets, but I want to use this app and I need to get into the entry asset. Each sommelier seller has like an entry and exit asset, which is like, might be a stablecoin or eth or wet or something like that. But you have a user and they hold all of these liquid stake token like lsts and all this stuff. How do they transform that? How do they do that in an efficient manner? These are going to be the big problems. Rather than just like how do we make more block space? Because I think we basically have made more block space than anyone really needs right now.
00:58:07.324 - 00:58:41.890, Speaker E: Yeah. And I think an interesting point, sorry, it's a tiny tangent, but it's towards this view of exception handling, which is the multichain bridge hack. I put maybe bridge in quotes. Hack in quotes also. Yeah. But I think it's kind of this type of case where imagine if the contracts had some exception handling on bridge keys compromised. We actually have never really thought about this in this industry at all, especially because multi chain's whole thing was like, we use MPC, don't ask who the signers are.
00:58:41.890 - 00:58:49.798, Speaker E: And I think one important thing to think about as people building this technology is there's also people who can misuse it.
00:58:49.884 - 00:58:50.278, Speaker A: Why?
00:58:50.364 - 00:58:50.902, Speaker B: How?
00:58:51.036 - 00:59:08.874, Speaker E: Well, they're using it for multi chain misused acronym MPC, to be like, oh, look, we're really safe. We're doing some MPC thing across multiple signers. And of course, you have no way of even knowing if all the signers are the same computer, let alone same subnet. Right?
00:59:08.992 - 00:59:29.934, Speaker C: Yeah. I think this is why ZK is actually really nice, because I think we should strongly advocate, or it should be totally unacceptable to have a ZK circuit that's close source. Obviously. It's like a smart contract. It's basically the same as any solidity code. But, yeah, with ZK, you can't really misuse it. Anyone can look at your circuit and find bugs.
00:59:29.934 - 00:59:37.166, Speaker C: Because with MPC, a lot of the correctness of it relies on the infrastructure, which generally has to be closed source.
00:59:37.198 - 00:59:37.394, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:37.432 - 00:59:58.262, Speaker C: Like, oh, what AWS box are you running your MPC signer on? Whereas with ZK, if your circuit's open source, then you can't abuse it this easily. So I think, for example, combining ZK plus a multi sig or ZK plus MPC or ZK plus MPC plus SGX or something, that's when it gets really powerful. It's just like an additional layer that can't be abused as easily.
00:59:58.406 - 01:00:44.762, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I guess from your vantage point, do you think this. I'm going to keep calling it a hack, even though obviously it's like this weird security incident. That's probably a better word, this security incident, which had a ton of side effects, where there were a ton of protocols that were just like, yo, we're shutting down because we just never can get out of the bad debt we have. So, yeah, in some sense, a one version of the world is sort of what Zaki was intimating to, where there's, like, exception handling to particular types of events across other, which is like the kludgy kind of duct tape and baling wire thing, but you can do it faster. And the other is like, hey, we get everyone to use ZK. So what's your view on, in the one to five year time frame, how that changed for both and for both of you?
01:00:44.816 - 01:01:20.454, Speaker C: I mean, I'm obviously really biased, but I think, hey, let's just all use ZK is obviously the correct thing, I think, with exception handling. I don't know how you handle an exception where it's like, oh, now billions of dollars are gone. Sure you can handle the exception, but the conclusion might still be the same that oh, our protocol is completely done, it doesn't really matter. And so I just am always advocating for, let's add more layers of security and make this stuff more secure. Because usually in the case of hacks they are very catastrophic. And so it doesn't really matter if you handle the exception or not for sure.
01:01:20.492 - 01:01:41.178, Speaker E: But there are things like halting particular markets in response to when the key signing stops happening. The threat response stuff is actually still quite poor in some of these contracts because everyone is gas optimizing. So they're like oh no, we can't add this extra hatch. And my point is, I think there is a lot of value in it, it's just not.
01:01:41.264 - 01:01:46.178, Speaker C: But if the hack can be atomic, then you're really for sure like the beanstalk hack.
01:01:46.214 - 01:01:47.054, Speaker E: There's no way around that.
01:01:47.092 - 01:02:22.694, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And I think there is actually a lot of value too. So I think there's arguments for it. I think there is a lot of value to atomic composability. So I do think it's kind of annoying to have a lot of this exception handling because if you've ever programmed an even Javascript where you have to do this async await and then handle the exception with a try catch, it just all gets very ugly very quickly. So it is nice to assume, oh, things are fine. One thing I have thought about is what if you had a roll up where you could fraud proof certain exit conditions, like for example, oh, none of the protocols are hacked and you kind of have atomic composability between all the apps in that domain.
01:02:22.694 - 01:02:46.802, Speaker C: But then the domain itself has kind of like this optimistic challenge period or things like that. Maybe that's interesting to think about as like a research exercise. But I think it's very tricky because often in defi the hacks happen and it's like in one transaction all the money is gone. It's not this continuous strip. And there, it doesn't really help if you can pause the protocol because by the time you can, it's done.
01:02:46.936 - 01:03:15.878, Speaker D: I think one thing that the multichain hack has been a great example of is the way in which the security of your system ends up being reduced to your largest or most dominant bridge. Right. It doesn't matter that phantom is consensus secure. The fact that it's still making blocks securely doesn't matter because everybody lost all of their money, because the bridge was what represented everyone, like all of the meaningful assets on chain.
01:03:16.054 - 01:04:11.818, Speaker C: I think the other thing I want to say about the multi chain hack is like, sorry, security incident. As Truan reminded me, say you have a token that you're bridging across a bunch of chains through one bridge. I think that's really silly. And I think there really needs to be a standard for having a cross chain ERC 20 or a cross chain asset that you can be compatible with many different bridges so that you're not kind of like a slave to any one bridge or any one security model. And so I think that's really important to make that a standard going forward, because my one worry is like, okay, multichain got hacked and now people are going to move to having their assets secured by one other bridge that is equally susceptible, by the way, to the same security properties. And that's really dangerous for the ecosystem in general. If that happens.
01:04:11.818 - 01:04:30.580, Speaker C: I think it's dangerous to crypto in general. So I think builders should just be really aware of the security properties they're assuming. And then also, I think as an industry or in the interop space, we should make this more of a standard so that you're compatible to many different bridges. There's not vendor lock in because it is really hard to have good security properties of any one.
01:04:31.670 - 01:04:44.870, Speaker E: And before Anna concludes, I want to say we normally don't have so much doomerism like ZK security doomerism, but this was an incident where it deserved to be talked about.
01:04:44.940 - 01:04:47.602, Speaker A: We have been talking about it, actually, before you arrived.
01:04:47.746 - 01:04:48.994, Speaker E: Oh, you talked about multi chain?
01:04:49.042 - 01:04:50.120, Speaker A: No, we talked about.
01:04:52.010 - 01:04:53.142, Speaker E: Yeah, that's.
01:04:53.286 - 01:04:53.786, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:53.888 - 01:04:54.298, Speaker D: Awesome.
01:04:54.384 - 01:04:57.754, Speaker A: I wish I could keep talking forever, but I think we all.
01:04:57.792 - 01:04:58.810, Speaker E: Forever is a long time.
01:04:58.880 - 01:05:21.950, Speaker A: We all have. True. But we also all have dinners, things we're supposed to go to. So I think it's a really good time to wrap. Thank you all for coming and doing the sort of the Paris ECC week roundout roundup, sharing all the ideas and themes, hopefully giving folks a bit of a sense for what's been happening here, what the conversations were like. So, yeah, thanks so much.
01:05:22.100 - 01:05:23.726, Speaker C: Thank you. Thanks for having us.
01:05:23.828 - 01:05:24.238, Speaker E: Thanks.
01:05:24.324 - 01:05:24.994, Speaker D: My pleasure.
01:05:25.082 - 01:05:31.810, Speaker A: Cool. And I want to say a big thank you to the podcast team, Rachel, Henrich and Tanya, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.
