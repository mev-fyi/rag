00:00:09.130 - 00:02:40.080, Speaker A: It's been a long break, so maybe you've forgotten a bit about what we've been talking about, but I'm going to try and quickly recap about what Joe was getting at in that with the multi at shielded pool, we have the ability to construct new asset types through a linear combination of preexisting asset types. A potential issue we might run into when doing this is that we may create negative asset types, which are not great because it will allow you to print an infinite amount of assets. But there are other times when we actually may want to have a linear combination of asset types to allow for conversions. So you can think of this as burning and minting assets, right? So when you have a new asset type that consists of, say, negative eth and positive wrapped eth, then you could send your asset through your eth through this conversion, and it will burn your eth and output a wrapped eth. And this is the basic principle for what we have coined as a conversion circuit. And also to caveat this, Joe, if you have anything to say, just please hop in and unmute yourself at any point. So I don't make any major errors, but yeah, so what the Mesp is checking for is that there is this net value zero created, so that if we want to create any type of conversion, then the conversion defines exactly what is net value zero.
00:02:40.080 - 00:03:52.070, Speaker A: In this sense, we have this law of conservation of cryptographic assets, where tokens can either be created nor destroyed, except for these new assets, which allows for these conversions. So more formally, a valid predefined conversion is a list of tuples. So you can say a one v one a two v two. Theoretically infinitely long list, but in practice usually just two from what we've thought of. And you can then define a new asset generator, EBCC, as the sum of these vis, which we put in brackets to indicate that these are their integer values multiplied by the asset generator of the asset type we're interested in. And this multiplication isn't the normal arithmetic one that we think about. It's over an elliptic curve.
00:03:52.070 - 00:05:36.120, Speaker A: So let's just jump back to reality bit and think of a very applicable example that we've tried to tackle through our lifetimes, and then the crypto verse, and that is creating a stable coin. So if it was as simple as this, then we could in theory make a conversion whereby we have the stable coins asset generator, and then our already kind of accepted notion of the asset we are trying to peg to in another asset generator. God knows how we're going to get that into the blockchain. But in this sense, you could have a conversion where if you send the stable coin, you're guaranteed to get exactly one USD or whatever peg you're trying to achieve out on the other side. And this would be done completely anonymously, right? Because these conversions are conversions in their truest sense. There is no counterparty, there is no public exchange, there's no need for shielding or unshielding anything. It simply just ensures that the condition of net value created or destroyed is zero.
00:05:36.120 - 00:06:39.980, Speaker A: So for Nomada, we want to incentivize the idea of public goods, and we believe that privacy is a public good. So we want to incentivize users for keeping their assets in their shielded pool. So how would we go about doing that without asking people, okay, how much assets do you have in the shielded pool? Okay, we believe you. We can't see it. We're going to send you some, or another way, I guess, would be to ask them to prove that they had it. But then there's no point in that, right? Because we're just leaking privacy, which is the public good we're trying to protect. So if we create, let's say, epoch based tokens, so we would have.
00:06:39.980 - 00:07:38.734, Speaker A: I wonder if you can see my mouse on the screen. Perhaps not. Let's say we have Nam tokens, which is our native asset, denominated in every epoch. So each nam asset in the shielded pool is different from one another based upon which epoch they were generated in. And then as epochs go on, you can convert any previous epoch nam token to a current epoch nam token. And that conversion ratio is something like negative nam epoch one plus one nam epoch two plus 0.5 nam epoch two.
00:07:38.734 - 00:09:10.720, Speaker A: So you get an additional 50% nam for each epoch. That is obviously a very high rate of inflation, but in this sense you could create an incentivized shielded pool without breaking any forms of privacy guarantees. But that is what we thought about doing, right? And in a sense, we think of this workshop as a place to generate new ideas, and a place to let engineers and thinkers like yourselves to come up with ways to apply these ideas onto other things or new things, and we would love to see it used. So I was sitting and brainstorming about what potential ideas you could use this for, and one I came up with, which was quite interesting, was the idea of having shielded prediction markets. Prediction markets, for those of you not very familiar, are quite fun ideas where you can essentially you're betting on doesn't need to be about, but usually binary outcomes. So let's say, will I end my presentation in time? Yes. No.
00:09:10.720 - 00:10:38.266, Speaker A: And there's a probability on this happening. And in a transparent prediction market, that question would exist, let's say. And let's say there would be some token, like bank finishes his presentation on time. And if I do, this token evaluates to, let's say, $100 to keep them, or 100 USDC, sorry, or die. And if I do not, then the opposing token, let's say, generates 100 die, then this token would be traded on the market for, let's say, if the probability of me finishing in time is around 30%, then it would be trading at around 30 die. Because obviously if there was actually a higher likelihood of that happening, then someone could come in and buy it, and then in expectation they'd be making profit anyway. The finance part of it is not the interesting part.
00:10:38.266 - 00:12:53.220, Speaker A: The interesting part is that it's possible to do this, I believe, using just the convert circuit. So some additional things that we required in order to make this work would be a trusted oracle for the blockchain, or an ensemble of competing shelling point oracles like Chainlink, where we have some source of truth, right? Because we need to evaluate whether this binary outcome actually does occur. And then we'd need some form of contract, or what we call validity predicates that handle the creation and deletion of these convert circuits. And then in order to facilitate trading, we might want some counterparty discovery in some front end, right? So that people, users, sorry, can be, what's the english word? They can decide by themselves how much privacy they want to leak in finding these counterparties. Obviously, if it's just a friend, then they don't need to at all publicize to the whole world who they're trading with and what they're trading. And then if people really don't trust each other, might need some adequate contracts to ensure that the trade goes through. But the idea is this, right? So yeah, I guess a somewhat relevant example is, will England win the Fifa 22 World cup? Then we initiate this convert circuit whereby any user can go and mint both one yes England token and one no England token for 100 Nam, with the idea that once the results have been decided, the yes England token will be able to be converted for 100 Nam if they do win.
00:12:53.220 - 00:14:09.562, Speaker A: Otherwise will be worthless, and the no England token will be able to be converted for 100 Nam if they don't win, vice versa. So the benefit behind this is that we don't need some writer of contracts, we don't need some trusted point where users can go and talk to someone who will give them prices today. I guess things exist on place like aurora where they need liquidity providers and better exchange, where you have bookies that lay these ods for you and write them. But instead it could be literally anyone. Because in this conversion you're not creating or destroying any value. If you decide to do nothing here, one of these will always evaluate to 100 and the other will always evaluate to zero. So this conversion is benign in that sense, and then you can go and trade these.
00:14:09.562 - 00:15:35.670, Speaker A: So let's say Tom, who is my proud english friend, believes with very high certainty that England will win the World cup. And me being, I guess, less enthusiastic, I could trade with him. Let's say one yes token for 90 Nam or 80 Nam, or however strong his belief is. And I still keep my no England token. So potentially I can make up to, I guess, 180 Nam if they don't win, or 80 Nam if they do win. And once the World cup winner has been decided, you can just open up the convert circuits that allow you to convert your prediction tokens for their respective values. So, yeah, to recap the benefits of this over, what currently exists is that you don't need some centralized party to handle the payouts to ensure that one person pays the next.
00:15:35.670 - 00:16:30.726, Speaker A: Because all of the Nam will already exist in the pool, because they cannot do that if they haven't been converted initially. You don't have to track the supply of these tokens. Nobody has to reveal what they've been trading. So Tom doesn't know that I've betrayed his trust by thinking that England will not win. And other benefits like, yeah, I'm sure you can think of other benefits for being able to do this privately, but those were my ideas. And then on the motto we have these incentivized, we have these subsidies for providing assets to the yielded pool. And that, I think, is a great idea and necessary.
00:16:30.726 - 00:18:29.390, Speaker A: But let's take some steps forward into thinking about when blockchains become really mainstream. And ideally, we'd be doing all of our transfers, all of our transactions on a blockchain. And what we try to motivate is that we don't want to be doing this all on a transparent blockchain because I don't want literally everyone to see all the transactions I'm making. Because it just so happens that when I'm buying Christmas presents, I don't want the people that I buy Christmas presents for to know what I've bought beforehand. So regardless, we get to this point and the government says, no, we refuse to allow for private blockchains because we can't tax people if we don't know how much money they have, right? But if we create convert circuits where we enforce that the only legal tender is the latest epoch, then you can tax people in a completely anonymous way by ensuring that as they update their tokens, certain amounts get either burned or created in the name of the government or whatever body exists. And it doesn't need to necessarily be just a tax for the sake of taxation, but it could also act as a stick. Let's say for people that if we go back to our example of trying to incentivize shielded assets in the shielded pool, then we might want to incentivize active assets in the shielded pool by saying, okay, if you haven't converted in the past ten epochs, then you'll be taxed.
00:18:29.390 - 00:19:54.934, Speaker A: So it incentivizes people to keep their assets updated. Then another idea is perhaps to use it for voting and crowdfunding. So my idea here was that we could distribute vote tokens, and people can vote anonymously, perhaps in a private Dow where there exists certain proposals, and they can convert to their vote tokens for voted for x proposal tokens, and you would have no idea of who voted for what, and not even actually how many people voted for it until you collect them and reveal it. You could create some revealing mechanisms still with zero knowledge, so that nobody has to reveal who they were. Or you aggregate it at some place, and then that place reveals it. And then once that is done, you can trade back your vote tokens, or voted for tokens for new vote tokens for the next proposal so that they're compatible. And the same goes for funding projects.
00:19:54.934 - 00:21:13.940, Speaker A: So that once it's successful, you can get your sorry. If it's not successful, you can open this other circuit and get your money back. And if it is successful, then that's great. And another funny example I thought of was perhaps using it for nfts, right? We don't distinguish between using ERC 20s or ERC seven, two ones, or whatever other token standards exist. So you could be able to use your serums and your upgrades to your nfts over time without telling the whole world that you've done so, which could be an interesting application as well. And finally, I keep saying I this is of course a collective effort. Been thinking about an idea for shielded lending and borrowing, and what I mean by that is, ideally we would be able to create the ave equivalent or the compound equivalent privately, but it proves to be quite difficult.
00:21:13.940 - 00:22:47.140, Speaker A: However, we can quite easily create shielded lending whereby you can convert assets for lent assets anonymously, and then these lent assets could receive some interest based on their epoch difference if they're epoch denominated. But the problem with doing this for borrowing is that lended tokens are very fungible. It doesn't really matter as long as they exist in the pool, then there are no collateral requirements to be met. There are no other guarantees. But when you're borrowing, each borrower has a different risk profile, each borrower has a different amount of collateral that they've provided, and it's not as easy making these fungible. And when things aren't fungible, it's hard to keep it anonymous because you want to aggregate them into a pool. So I'm going to leave that question with you guys and I think that if you can solve this, it will be a very interesting application and will probably be necessary at some point if we have this dream of having zero knowledge blockchains that can do everything.
00:22:47.140 - 00:23:16.120, Speaker A: So yeah, I promised to make it quick. I didn't realize it would be that quick. But I am very happy to take any questions, any thoughts, concerns about this half of the presentation, and I'm sure Joe will be willing to answer any about his port.
00:23:24.770 - 00:24:03.210, Speaker B: I'll also jump back on. Yeah, we are a little bit early. One thing is, I think Kobe's not quite ready to present puzzle two yet. So yeah, we will have a bit of time to kill. If there are questions, it's really great to put them in the Q-A-I think there is actually one. So why don't we answer a couple of these questions and then, yeah, I'll just see if we can get Kobe over. I know someone has also asked in another chat about networking further, and that's actually something we can totally do today.
00:24:03.210 - 00:24:14.240, Speaker B: If people want to stick around to meet other participants, I think it would be really fun to do that after. But yeah, for now, do you want to just maybe read this Tamir's question?
00:24:15.170 - 00:25:16.020, Speaker A: Yeah. So yeah, Tamir asks, maybe you said this already, but in the world cop example is the end conversion coded in advance based on some future predicate, and it wouldn't be necessary as long as you can guarantee that the yes and no tokens as a sum can always be traded back for 100 now. But yes, you'd need some guarantee that these assets aren't going to end up being worthless at some point. So you make a very good point there, but I'm sure that could easily be done with a validity predicate or smart contract that ensures that. I hope that answers that question. But yeah, it's a very good point.
00:25:19.270 - 00:25:41.110, Speaker B: Bogdan actually asked something that I can answer. Is the new puzzle somehow connected with today's information? I would say no connection planned in any way. I can't give anything away, but I know that was not something that we discussed internally.
00:25:43.210 - 00:25:51.840, Speaker C: If you're really revealing no information about the puzzle, then there's always a small probability that like, it'll collide by chance.
00:26:02.210 - 00:26:39.162, Speaker B: Yeah. Are there any other questions for Joe or bank? I think we have a little bit of time still in this session. Wonder, is there anything else that either of you would be able to share, maybe even links or ways because you had asked this question at the end there. Is there any directions you can point people into how to get into that?
00:26:39.296 - 00:27:07.000, Speaker A: Yeah, very good point actually. So we do have our code on GitHub is very useful if you want to take this out of the box and start implementing directly without having to rewrite a bunch of code. So I would like to share our GitHub repo. I can do that in the chat, but not sure.
00:27:21.610 - 00:27:35.838, Speaker B: Also, Bugdan's asking about sort of getting some easier, simpler, beginner level stuff. I'm going to add some separate links that are more just beginner content if you're interested in just general ZK stuff. But anyway, go ahead, bank please.
00:27:35.924 - 00:28:02.920, Speaker A: Yes, and then if you want to read a bit about, I guess go in a bit deeper context and read up a bit more on what Joe's slides were based off of. There is paper here where we borrowed a lot of ideas from the zcash as protocol specification, but could be a good read.
00:28:08.760 - 00:29:45.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I would just add, I think the zcash protocol specification, while being quite good, again, is not necessarily light reading. It's 100 something pages and it's rather dense. And also it very specifically is describing the zcash protocol, right? And it's not necessarily describing a generic or a high level the description of things. It's describing this very specific protocol. Nevertheless, it's still great reference for learning how this stuff works, but it doesn't necessarily teach you. And there's maybe a lack of resources which are more primarily instructional in nature, which could be sort of read linearly. But also it doesn't really teach you anything about zero knowledge application design in general or how zero knowledge proofs work, because protocol spec is not designed to do that, and so other resources would be better, for example, for learning how the case narcs work in general.
00:29:45.250 - 00:30:05.450, Speaker C: A more generic source would be better for that, because these specifications are not going to describe that at all. It's just going to be assumed that those things kind of work as they do in a black box.
00:30:12.090 - 00:30:44.660, Speaker A: Yeah, and I agree with Joe there, because I don't come from a cryptography background, and all the information that I've collected have been most useful from the zcash specification, but has been a very long read, and I would highly recommend to stay motivated to go on some of the shorter reads first, get grasp like, I guess, the bigger idea, and then go more granular when needed.
00:30:49.650 - 00:31:04.740, Speaker B: I have a sort of side question. Do you have any sort of. I don't know if either of you are in any way involved in your trusted setup, but I am curious to hear how is it going? Because it sounds like there's a lot of.
00:31:09.270 - 00:31:20.310, Speaker A: Joe. Do you want to speak about Joe actually fixed a little front end mean. Otherwise it's been going perfectly.
00:31:22.010 - 00:33:22.640, Speaker C: Yeah, there was a little bit of a UI issue to start, but otherwise the underlying cryptography is very much just the same multiparty computation that was used to set up sapling in the first place. And so it's very time tested, I guess, is the way to describe it, and it's very efficient. Interest seems to be quite high. I think it's good if people can participate and also post public attestations. The idea is that hopefully, if you want to actually use one of these circuits, that either you've participated yourself or you actually have some kind of trust connection to someone who participated, who you, for whatever reason, suspect has participated correctly. When you get a public ceremony which has thousands and thousands of people, you're really hoping that at least one person has done it correctly, which I think given the state of the sapling set up, which I think had maybe 90 people, I don't remember. For the second phase, it's certainly a much more expansive ceremony, and it's certainly more interesting also to involve a large number of people.
00:33:23.170 - 00:33:34.740, Speaker B: The point from Francois, actually in the chat. But this is a quick question about this. Maybe you want to just read it.
00:33:36.150 - 00:33:39.754, Speaker C: Yeah. Privacy oriented projects have been on the rise.
00:33:39.902 - 00:33:44.120, Speaker B: No, this is actually in the chat. This is from Francois, just in regular chat. Yeah.
00:33:50.170 - 00:34:20.994, Speaker C: As a contributor. The trusted setup is ridiculously smooth. What max proof size did you go for? The computational burden was lower than I expected. Yes. So the computational burden is actually significantly lower than the zcash sapling one. And this is not just because of technology improvement over the years, which is a little bit. A little bit.
00:34:20.994 - 00:35:43.420, Speaker C: The code has just improved over time. But the primary reason is, in fact, that zcash did not just have to do the sapling upgrade, they also had to do like, they weren't just implementing the sapling protocol, they were doing a sapling upgrade, they were upgrading sprout from the old sprouts protocol to sapling. And so they had to do the set up for the old sprout join split circuit at the same time. Of course, it wasn't revealed at the time, but there was the infamous bug in the sprout trusted setup that they also had to fix at the same time by doing the gross 16 set up for the sprout circuit. And so the sprout circuit, because they did the setup for that as part of the sapling ceremony, the sprout circuit is much larger. I mean, sapling was a really huge upgrade in terms of performance. Having to do the sprout setup at the same time actually kind of slowed them down.
00:35:43.420 - 00:36:22.166, Speaker C: Whereas with Masp, there's no legacy sprouts pool to deal with. And so we just get rid of the sprout circuit. So we had the convert circuit to also do the setup for. But convert circuit is very small when you consider all the different things. Hardware has improved a lot over four or five years. Software has improved a lot, and we didn't have to do sprout setup. That contributed a lot to it.
00:36:22.166 - 00:36:55.570, Speaker C: Being more efficient and having an automated coordinator, which is, I believe, based in alias coordinator, having an automated coordinator helps scale the ceremony a lot easier. You just join and you don't have to deal with receiving the file, receiving files and uploading files. It's all handled by the coordinator. And so that gives the perception, at least that the contribution is a lot smoother.
00:36:57.110 - 00:37:00.222, Speaker B: There's like a step taken out there in a lot of ways, I guess.
00:37:00.376 - 00:37:10.834, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes it kind of more frictionless, but, yeah, definitely. It seems like demand is very high to participate.
00:37:10.962 - 00:37:11.750, Speaker B: Totally.
00:37:12.910 - 00:37:52.360, Speaker C: I'm hoping that at least some of the anonymous contributors are actually, like, contributing in some way to the public confidence, I guess, of the ceremony. Because if they're just contributing for themselves, it's okay, it helps themselves, but it's better if people know that there's a very wide variety of people with different incentives that are.
00:37:52.730 - 00:38:00.440, Speaker B: Shall we jump on to a few of the questions? So there are two questions, three questions. There's another one here.
00:38:01.050 - 00:38:03.590, Speaker A: I'm happy to take Hakan's question.
00:38:03.740 - 00:38:05.880, Speaker B: Sure. Do you want to say it out? Do you want to read?
00:38:06.890 - 00:39:51.354, Speaker A: So, yeah. So Hakan says privacy oriented projects have been on the rise lately because of the increasing pressure on crypto, which is going towards centralization, and the future of such projects will be under pressure. What do you think? So, yes, I am sure you've all heard about the tornado cash incident, or whatever you want to call it, which we is perhaps not directed in the way that I would have done it had I been the social planner. But yeah, these will all come under regulatory pressure because of the nature that they are taking away power from controlling entities. So we like to live on the approach where we build technologies that should be neutral to this, where you could in principle implement everything that you should need to implement. Like if you could prove that you have not interacted with any addresses on the sanctioned list, that should be sufficient for the regulator. So that is definitely possible using our technology, and then you can provide other proofs that ensure people that you are being a law abiding citizen.
00:39:51.354 - 00:41:17.434, Speaker A: And hopefully this should be enough to get us to a place where we want to go. We also need to work together to push the narrative that privacy is essential for protecting human beings. I feel like the government also, or not the government, but any regulatory body needs to see the perspective that when everything is public and transparent, we unintentionally, perhaps, emit a lot of information and data that could be even a security, like a national security risk. And it definitely can be infringing on people's right to having an opinion and things like that. We need both not just building in technology, but building in a social sense, where we try to spread these ideas that we hold. We need to convince people. Right? But yeah, I don't know, maybe.
00:41:17.434 - 00:41:18.540, Speaker A: Joe, you have another?
00:41:19.870 - 00:42:30.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the really great benefits of sticking close to the sapling design and inheriting a lot of the nice features you get the features which are important, like the sapling key schedule, which allows for incoming and full viewing keys and transaction memos, and all these other features which are really designed to make it. I'm not the person to ask about policy, but on the technological side, building as many of these features in as possible, where it's really possible to provide these guarantees as much as you can to help people meet whatever policy requirements there are, is really important.
00:42:33.350 - 00:43:02.250, Speaker B: There was two questions that I don't think are super. I mean, I don't know if they're related to anything you feel you were talking about, but maybe we can rephrase one of them, which is like, you received a lot of requests for the trusted setup. I think that's maybe what that means did you expect that? And then will there be any sort of second trusted setup? I think not. Right. Oh, maybe for a noma. Actually, do you have to do a separate one for a noma?
00:43:02.670 - 00:43:05.942, Speaker C: A noma will not have a second trusted setup.
00:43:06.006 - 00:43:06.534, Speaker B: Okay.
00:43:06.672 - 00:43:42.120, Speaker C: Because, of course, you can never predict the future entirely. But from my perspective. Gross. 16. Which is the reason that you need a circuit specific set up. Gross 16 is great. And, I mean, the fact that it's still basically state of the art in some ways in 2022 and 2023 is amazing.
00:43:42.120 - 00:43:56.730, Speaker C: But there's some really good technology out there now. And I think Halo two is an incredibly exciting proof system.
00:43:56.880 - 00:44:01.790, Speaker B: Do you think by the time anoma is launching, that's what's possibly going to be under the hood?
00:44:03.650 - 00:44:04.990, Speaker C: I think there's.
00:44:07.730 - 00:44:09.586, Speaker B: A non negligible chance.
00:44:09.688 - 00:44:17.970, Speaker C: Is that what you from my perspective, I do not foresee any need for more trusted setups in the future.
00:44:18.040 - 00:44:18.820, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:44:20.810 - 00:45:29.100, Speaker C: I think there's some philosophical kind of reasons why some people might prefer not having a trusted set up. Certainly there's this qualitative difference between having a trusted set up and not from a sort of social perspective. There's really not from a cryptographic perspective because, again, as long as one person completes the ceremony successfully and honestly, which I don't see how that cannot happen. But it's theoretically possible. But cryptographically, if the ceremony is completed successfully, there's not really much cryptographic difference. But again, you're exchanging a cryptographic kind of assumption for a social assumption, which is different. And if you just don't want a social assumption, that's important.
00:45:29.100 - 00:46:07.922, Speaker C: But I think mostly doing these ceremonies is maybe although it's a lot of fun to participate, it's not maybe the most productive use of the community. I think maybe takes away the focus a little bit on what interesting things that these systems can do, and it's maybe technologically not so necessary anymore.
00:46:08.066 - 00:46:09.800, Speaker B: Makes sense. Cool.
00:46:10.570 - 00:46:57.510, Speaker C: But if I have anything to do with it, I think this will be the last. And whether we expected such strong demand, I don't know because I wasn't involved on the planning planning side. But I think certainly interest just is very strong in general for ZK stuff, even just from a curiosity point of view. It's like something very fun and interesting to participate in. And I think that's reason enough for a lot of people to participate.
00:47:00.570 - 00:47:19.614, Speaker B: Fantastic. I want to say a big thank you to both of you for this great workshop, and thank you so much for answering these questions. And it did fill up the time in the end. So we worked it out really good. Sometimes I think questions just take a little while to get going, but I think it worked out well.
00:47:19.652 - 00:47:20.766, Speaker C: Thank you for having us.
00:47:20.868 - 00:47:22.480, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you.
00:47:23.090 - 00:47:44.130, Speaker B: Will you guys pop by the job fair Thursday? Amazing. This is also for anyone listening, the job fair. Actually, I'm about to talk about it in these slides. This is kind of our concluding slides, but, yeah, we're doing that on Thursday. So I guess I'll see you there. Hi, guys. Stick around for a little bit to the audience.
00:47:44.130 - 00:48:10.926, Speaker B: I will be doing a. Hold on. I'm just going to wrap this up. Okay. Just me. So before you leave, don't leave yet, because we are about to announce the puzzle t two. Kobe, you popped up a little early there, but I'm glad you're here.
00:48:10.926 - 00:48:52.726, Speaker B: Now, I first want to say a bit of a thank you to some of the sponsors, which we didn't actually mention earlier. Partners, the workshop hosts. Basically a big thank you to everyone. So today we heard from anoma, but there are a number of workshop hosts. And I think you, obviously, if you're looking at our schedule, you know this. But I want to say big thank you to Inoma and Aztec and Alio and risk zero, as well as our mid tier workshop sponsors, scroll Ovone labs, privacy and scaling exploration from the EF and Sismo. I want to say a big thank you to the community sponsors, trapdoor tech, sunscreen, Lambda class and one KX.
00:48:52.726 - 00:49:17.330, Speaker B: And I made a separate slide now for the ZKV team, because there's a ton of people from the ZKV team who are helping on this event, as well as geometry, because geometry has really been managing the puzzles. And so I just wanted to make sure that both of these entities were highlighted. Okay. Oh, and the team. This is the team that's put this together. Thank you to everyone. This is us.
00:49:17.330 - 00:49:32.840, Speaker B: You might see us in chats. Okay, we're here. We are at the point of releasing puzzle t two. I am excited. Kobe, just a quick question. Is the leaderboard live?
00:49:33.930 - 00:49:37.154, Speaker D: Not yet. It will go live in the same time. With the puzzle.
00:49:37.202 - 00:49:50.058, Speaker B: With the puzzle. Okay. So in this right now, what we're going to hear about is what puzzle t two is all about. Maybe you can give us some sense for how people should approach it. A little bit of a tip.
00:49:50.234 - 00:49:51.390, Speaker D: Yes, definitely.
00:49:51.540 - 00:49:53.998, Speaker B: All right, let's dig into this.
00:49:54.164 - 00:50:38.842, Speaker D: All right, so, puzzle t two. Power corrupts. So this is very exciting. This is a puzzle that was created by Dan Bonet's team in the cryptography group at Stanford. So this includes Trisha and Didi. And this puzzle is about a topic that some people mention sometime, and it's about the security of large, trusted setups, essentially, and how it relates to specific properties of a curve. And this touches upon the Cheon attack algorithm that some of you may have heard.
00:50:38.842 - 00:51:03.286, Speaker D: And if not, it's a really good chance to get to know it because it's really interesting. Yeah. So that's what the puzzle is going to be about. Again, it's in arcworks this time. It's going to require also some computing power, like you will need to run your computer. And it may get heated for 20 minutes or something, but it's worth it.
00:51:03.468 - 00:51:21.270, Speaker B: Cool. Exciting stuff. Thank you, Kobe. And as you mentioned, I guess it'll go live on the website shortly. Maybe we can just share. I'll just share a link to the website in the meantime. So this is Zkhack.
00:51:21.270 - 00:52:00.710, Speaker B: Dev Zkhacki here. It's here where if you look for puzzle two, this is where it's going to first appear. Also, if you're not yet in the discord, you should head over there because we'll be sharing links to all of this over there as well. So you'll see it as it lands and as this is a time you're competing both for accuracy of solution, but also for speed. I think someone was asking what you had mentioned there when you had said the chinon attack.
00:52:00.860 - 00:52:08.442, Speaker D: I will write it in the chat. You will see all the details in the background materials, but I will also write it here so it will be easy to see.
00:52:08.576 - 00:52:09.162, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:52:09.296 - 00:52:35.218, Speaker D: But yeah, like you said, fast solvers get rewards, but also the best write ups so you can submit them whenever you want. The puzzle finishes at Monday night, so up until the last minute of the day UTC. And yeah, feel free to ask questions and form teams in the puzzle chat channel on discord and have fun.
00:52:35.304 - 00:52:49.954, Speaker B: And maybe just one thing. There are going to be hints. So we release three hints during the week. So if you are stumped, just keep your eye out for that. When's the first one usually going out? Thursday or Friday?
00:52:50.002 - 00:52:54.710, Speaker D: No, the first one usually goes out a day after the evening.
00:52:55.050 - 00:52:55.800, Speaker A: Cool.
00:52:56.270 - 00:53:29.598, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, thanks, Kobe. I just have a few more things to say about the next. Yep. Okay, we are doing a session with Aztec on Thursday. This is going to be a two hour workshop on the DSL Noir. I think they may have done workshops on this, but I know this is one of the earlier workshops, so I think it would be really cool if you want to find out about that to join it right after that session.
00:53:29.598 - 00:53:55.302, Speaker B: So this is on Thursday. Right after that, we are also going to be doing the Zihi jobs fair. This I've mentioned and teased a few times. It's in this digital world, like, you get to have a little avatar. You can run around and meet people. It's a fantastic way to kind of get to know your potential employers before going through any sort of formal process. You can find out about available jobs.
00:53:55.302 - 00:54:22.740, Speaker B: You can just get to know the vibe of the company. There will be, I think, some hiring folks there, but also some engineers. So you could potentially meet people you're going to be working with as well. And just generally it's a cool place to go hang out after Zkhack period. Like, you will get to meet other participants as well. It's like the networking is one thing, but this is a lot more casual. And there's going to be some games we tend to play, like poker at the end.
00:54:22.740 - 00:54:46.630, Speaker B: I think this is the 7th or 8th time we're doing it. So there is like we kind of have fun. We come to the space every once in a while and get to know each other and get to hang out. So I hope to see you there. The links for all this, we're going to be mailing out. We're going to be adding in the chat. We'll definitely be getting it to you, but keep your eyes posted, put it in your calendar.
00:54:46.630 - 00:55:10.034, Speaker B: The easiest way is just sign up for the next event. For Zkhack. We just put it in the chat there. But Zkhack session four, because then if you're signed up for that, you will for sure be reminded you can put that in the calendar and yeah, I hope to see you there. One last thing is that we are like, a lot of teams are starting to do their postings on the jobs board. So if you're looking for. Oh, yeah.
00:55:10.034 - 00:55:33.622, Speaker B: So Derek, you just asked how long is the job fair running? Actually, before I do that, job fair is running usually about two. Like, I would try to get there earlier rather than later. Assume for about an hour and a half. It's pretty high activity. And then by the end people kind of trail off. And then we tend to play poker and we kind of get distracted. But I think for the beginning part, everyone's a lot more focused.
00:55:33.622 - 00:56:02.270, Speaker B: And what you'll see is we have booths for the different workshop hosts and you can actually walk up to them and get to know what's going on. And there's like little interactive things you can touch in the meantime, check out the jobs board because we are getting the sponsors putting up their jobs right now and so they're sort of popping up. This is very fresh jobs. These are the jobs that they're also going to be talking about at the job fair. You can already check them out. I don't know if we could actually add the link to that. Maybe in the chat.
00:56:02.270 - 00:56:22.378, Speaker B: Perfect. So, yeah, I just wanted to let you know about that. I just went blurry. I don't know why that happened. Okay, well, here's all the rest of our links. We're at the end anyway, so. Yeah, thanks so much for joining us for session three of the ZK hack three.
00:56:22.378 - 00:56:24.230, Speaker B: And we'll see you on Thursday.
00:56:24.390 - 00:56:26.218, Speaker D: Puzzle is officially live.
00:56:26.304 - 00:56:35.006, Speaker B: Whoa. Yeah. Okay. We'll add the link in here too. Oh. What we could do right now is we can turn on networking. If anyone does want to meet, if anyone's still around.
00:56:35.006 - 00:56:48.810, Speaker B: I think we can do that. Yes. Okay. We'll put on networking. You have to refresh your browser. I will hopefully not be blurry after that. And I think you'll stick around for another 1520 minutes and then the event ends.
00:56:48.810 - 00:56:55.650, Speaker B: But enjoy yourselves and hope to see you in the discord. And hope to see you on Thursday, the job fair, and for the session. Bye.
