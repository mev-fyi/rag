00:00:05.610 - 00:00:54.846, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. This week I catch up with Justin Drake from the Ethereum foundation. We catch up about what he's been working on since he last was on the show almost three years ago. We chat about the progress that's been made on vrfs and how these can be used in Ethereum's POS architecture, the concept of ultrasound, money, where it started, what it means, and where Justin sees it going, as well as other interests he has in ZK generally. Before we kick off, I want to share a quick announcement from one of our partners from last fall's ZK Summit eight event.
00:00:54.846 - 00:01:19.234, Speaker A: Risc Zero would like to announce the next version of their ZKVM is now available on GitHub. The new version greatly improves performance, adds GPU support, and includes a pure rust verifier for easy inclusion in WASM projects. Check all of this out on their GitHub GitHub.com slash Risk Zero that's riskthenumberzero. We'll add the link in the show notes. Now Tanya will share a little bit about this week's sponsor.
00:01:19.362 - 00:01:52.238, Speaker B: Today's episode is sponsored by Mina Protocol. The need for private, trustless solutions is clear. A new era of ZK power decentralized applications is coming, and Mina is the place to build them. Introducing Mina's ZK ignite cohort Zero, where developers complete tutorials and build zero knowledge apps, or ZK apps and get rewarded. There are a quarter of a million Mina tokens up for grabs for Zkignite cohort Zero participants. Over 2000 builders have joined cohort Zero, and nearly half of them have already submitted code to win prizes. And there are still more prizes to go.
00:01:52.238 - 00:02:14.994, Speaker B: Cohort Zero is finishing soon, so head to minaprotocol.com zkpodcast to get involved today. And if you're tuning into this podcast later, no worries, Mina will be launching additional ZK ignite cohorts. Just head to slash Zkpodcast to check out the best way to get involved. That's minaprotocol.com forward slash zkpodcast. So thanks again, minaprotocol.
00:02:14.994 - 00:02:16.870, Speaker B: And now here's our episode.
00:02:20.170 - 00:02:23.750, Speaker A: Today. I'm here with Justin Drake. Welcome back to the show, Justin.
00:02:23.830 - 00:02:25.354, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having me again.
00:02:25.472 - 00:03:13.546, Speaker A: I was just looking back through the archives to better understand when you were last on. You've been on twice as far as I could find, and once was like April 2019, and then you were talking about vdfs, and then we did an interview in February 2020, like right before everything went down. We were at the Stanford blockchain conference and Vitalik was on as well. And it's just sort of wild to remember that recording because it was just weeks before everything got locked down. It's one of the last sort of in person ones I got to do for a long time. But I think maybe a starting point would be to hear what's been up. I mean, a lot has happened since February 2020.
00:03:13.546 - 00:03:16.906, Speaker A: So tell me a little bit about what you've been up to.
00:03:17.008 - 00:03:53.942, Speaker C: Oh, wow. So much has happened. I mean, one of the big events, of course, is the merge for sure. But, yeah, I think my role has evolved during that time. The research, at least the blue sky research that I have been doing in the early days, is to a large extent complete. And so to the theme of this discussion, I've been transitioning a little bit more to the human layer, to the economics layer. In addition to looking at ultrasound money, I've also been looking at themes like mev and censorship resistance, which are not on the cryptography side of things, but more on the economic side of things.
00:03:53.942 - 00:04:06.838, Speaker C: And really our field is crypto economics. And I feel like I'm exploring the second chapter, as it were, the economics side after being fairly satisfied with the first chapter of cryptography.
00:04:06.934 - 00:04:19.402, Speaker A: So I kind of want to hear, let's start on that sort of completion of the cryptography side. The first episode that we did together was on vdfs verifiable delay functions.
00:04:19.466 - 00:04:19.694, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:19.732 - 00:04:20.446, Speaker A: Did I remember it?
00:04:20.468 - 00:04:21.390, Speaker C: Yes, that's correct.
00:04:21.540 - 00:04:35.006, Speaker A: Okay, good. And actually, I'll add a link to that. I want to hear what's happened with that research. I mean, at the time, for me at least, you were just presenting this idea. I didn't actually know what this thing was. How far has that gone?
00:04:35.128 - 00:05:25.822, Speaker C: Right. So VDfs, like many things in Ethereum, is a very ambitious project, and it's especially crazy because it involves asics, it involves hardware, and asics just, they take a lot of time and they're fairly expensive. Now, it turns out that in a few weeks, in December of this year, we're going to have the first test samples of the ASIC. So we went ahead, we taped out the twelve nanometer chip with global foundries and fingers crossed it should just work out of the box. And we'll have these extremely fast VDF evaluators. But that basically do sequential computation extremely fast. We're talking 128 bit modular squaring at 1 ghz frequency.
00:05:25.822 - 00:05:29.474, Speaker C: So one modular square per nanosecond.
00:05:29.602 - 00:05:52.958, Speaker A: Let's give a little bit of context to where this lives though. Is this purely research? Is this something where it's like you had an ambitious research project and now you're seen in ASIC, or are these things already in the Ethereum that we know today? Do they exist and this is actually going to optimize something? Or is it still sort of like, oh well, now we have this cool optimized thing we could use in the future, right?
00:05:53.044 - 00:06:51.306, Speaker C: So the research is very much done, but it's not in production yet. So we have this primitive, which is interesting because it's a very unique and exotic VDF primitive because it kind of connects to the physics of our world. So just like proof of work connects to the energy consumption, vdfs connects to time. And most cryptographic primitives like encryption and hashing and signatures and snarks, they're kind of detached from the physics of things. And this very unique cryptographic primitive unlocks various use cases which are very interesting one is unbiasable randomness. Another very interesting one is what's called timelock puzzles or delay encryption, which is this idea that you can encrypt a piece of information and it kind of automatically decrypts at some future point in time. And this is actually very interesting in the context of mev and censorship.
00:06:51.418 - 00:06:52.010, Speaker A: Totally.
00:06:52.090 - 00:07:25.098, Speaker C: And the reason is that you can have this thing called encrypted mempools. So the idea of an encrypted mempool is that when you broadcast your transaction, you actually broadcast it encrypted, and then it gets included on chain encrypted, and only after it's been included on chain does it get decrypted and executed. And because your transaction is encrypted, people can't see the contents of it, and in particular they can't front run you and they can't censor you, at least not as easily as it is possible to do today.
00:07:25.184 - 00:07:34.330, Speaker A: I mean, one of the ways that I've always heard this described is threshold decryption. Does this replace that concept or is it also being executed by a VDF?
00:07:34.410 - 00:07:39.722, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's kind of these two flavors of what I call automagical decryption.
00:07:39.786 - 00:07:46.238, Speaker A: Okay, so it's like when people are using that term, they're talking about a different technique, they're not talking about the one you just described.
00:07:46.334 - 00:07:55.162, Speaker C: Exactly. So there's kind of two flavors, two very natural flavors of encrypted mempools, one using threshold decryption and the other one using kind of time based decryption.
00:07:55.246 - 00:07:55.830, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:07:55.980 - 00:08:28.218, Speaker C: And they have different assumptions. So for the threshold version, you're basically trusting that a committee is majority honest, meaning that some large fraction of it is honest. And if they're dishonest, then they could do bad things. One of the things they can do is they can not choose to not decrypt specific messages. Or maybe even worse, is that they can decrypt things ahead of time. And you kind of lose the encryption with vdfs. One of the very nice things is you just have to trust physics.
00:08:28.218 - 00:08:34.922, Speaker C: You're no longer trusting a committee. And so it's kind of a more conservative security assumption.
00:08:34.986 - 00:08:35.870, Speaker A: But it's fascinating.
00:08:35.950 - 00:08:50.166, Speaker C: It comes with downsides. One of them is that you need hardware, and kind of another one of them is that it's a little harder to work with because you have to wait these delays. And so that can add maybe artificial latency in your system.
00:08:50.348 - 00:08:59.994, Speaker A: So it's a bit harder to work with potentially. Is there a way that you would have them both happening at the same time? Would they ever be combined or you'd always do an either or?
00:09:00.112 - 00:09:51.414, Speaker C: Yeah, you can combine them. And one of the things that you can do, for example, is you can have an encryption mechanism, which by default is threshold. But if the committee goes offline for some reason, then after a period of time, kind of the delay kicks in and then it automatically decrypts. And so there's actually this form of encryption which kind of generalizes both threshold and delay encryption, which is called witness encryption. Now, witness encryption is a little bit of moon math, but the idea here is that you can use any arbitrary witness to decrypt your payload. And so the witness could be a proof that either the committee has signed off on the decryption of your message or enough time has passed. And if you want, you can have these arbitrary, complicated statements.
00:09:51.414 - 00:10:01.510, Speaker C: So one of the statements could be, for example, only decrypt once ethereum has finalized the block, which includes the encrypted payload.
00:10:01.590 - 00:10:05.742, Speaker A: Just one thing. Do you keep saying auto magical? Is that what you're saying?
00:10:05.876 - 00:10:07.600, Speaker C: That is what I was saying, yes.
00:10:08.930 - 00:10:13.518, Speaker A: You say it very subtly, so I wasn't sure if I was, like, missing it. But that's a good word.
00:10:13.684 - 00:10:51.782, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically we want to have this guarantee that your encrypted payload will decrypt. So there's kind of a very naive thing that you can try and do for encrypted mempools, where it doesn't involve any encryption, which is that you kind of commit to your transaction by including a hash of the transaction on chain, and then you make a promise that you're going to reveal your transaction and then execute it. But the problem here is that you can't force people to actually reveal those transactions. And so instead, what we need is encryption with a sort of guaranteed decryption. And the two main natural flavors are threshold decryption and time based decryption.
00:10:51.846 - 00:11:09.874, Speaker A: I've done a few episodes where we've mentioned only threshold decryption. I actually didn't realize there was a second technique that we could use. And the pushback from the MEV crew has always been, oh, you can try to get rid of the MeV there, but the MEV will just move elsewhere. What do you make of that?
00:11:09.992 - 00:11:46.126, Speaker C: Right. So there's different forms of MeV, in my opinion. There's kind of good and public MeV, and there's kind of bad and Mev that is triggered based on user transactions. So let me try and flesh out these two buckets. So, in the first bucket, you have things like arbitrage, and things like liquidations, or even things like back running. And the idea here is that anyone can go ahead and grab this mev, and it actually performs a service to the ecosystem. And MeV is extractable value.
00:11:46.126 - 00:12:25.594, Speaker C: It could be extractable value that is specifically put there by the designer of a decentralized application. And so one of the classic examples here is liquidations. We want people to trigger transactions that will liquidate very risky positions. And in order to guarantee that, we give them an incentive, a reward. So that's the form of meV, which is very good, because it's constructive. Now, the other form of MeV, which is toxic, and it tends to be kind of triggered by user transactions, is essentially front running. The idea here is that as a user, I make a transaction, and this transaction specifically is going to get front run.
00:12:25.594 - 00:12:37.454, Speaker C: And my belief is that front running can basically be removed, eliminated with these encrypted mempools. But of course, the first type of public good MeV will stay.
00:12:37.572 - 00:13:16.326, Speaker A: Have you been following some of the, I don't know if the word is controversy, but like, findings about the MEV operators of today, I don't know if that's what you call them. But I had the flashbots folks on some time ago, and they talked about the PBS, the proposer builder separation. And then I learned later that because of this model. There were sort of these centralizing points in the actors actually getting MeV. We had all these conversations about how validators could potentially be centralized or be censoring, how they could be coerced. And then we learned that, actually, there's these different places in that stack, which could be. And I'm just curious.
00:13:16.326 - 00:13:25.886, Speaker A: It sounds like you're obviously digging more into MeV. What are your thoughts on this? And are you looking for ways to mitigate this kind of censorship at these different points?
00:13:25.988 - 00:13:54.850, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%. I did a very deep dive into this whole topic. And so the flashbots people talk about this MEV supply chain. I like to think of it as a pipeline, as a linear pipeline, where you have various actors involved. So it kind of starts with the user. The user goes through an interface to create a transaction to publish it to the mempool. This transaction gets observed in the mempool by so called searchers.
00:13:54.850 - 00:14:12.054, Speaker C: Searchers take these transactions, and they create so called bundles that extract value. And then these bundles get sent to builders that produce blocks, and then these blocks get sent to a relay, which acts as an intermediary between the builder and the proposer.
00:14:12.102 - 00:14:17.822, Speaker A: And it's the relay part that can be centralized. Right. I feel like that's what we talked about in the last time.
00:14:17.876 - 00:14:27.630, Speaker C: Yeah. So it turns out that at every single step of the pipeline, there's an opportunity for censorship. And for every single step of the pipeline, we need different types of solutions.
00:14:27.790 - 00:14:28.210, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:28.280 - 00:15:24.146, Speaker C: And it turns out that for relays specifically, which is a big, contentious topic nowadays because of OFAC compliance, there is, as you said, something called enshrined PBS, which is this idea that instead of doing proposer builder separation outside of consensus, which is a little clunky and a little hacky, and it's basically something called Mevboost. Let's do it very cleanly, in consensus, where you don't need the relays. And so right now, well, the most popular relay is the flashbots relay, and they're based in the US, and they have to do this, or at least they've chosen to do this filtering of transactions that involve addresses on the OFAC list. And the net effect of that is because most of the validators are using the flashbot relay as their relay. Roughly 80% of blocks are so called OFAC compliant, although I heard, for some.
00:15:24.168 - 00:15:31.862, Speaker A: Reason, I heard it had gone down because the alight was shone on it. That number had fallen more to, like, 60%. Is that possible?
00:15:31.996 - 00:15:46.538, Speaker C: So there's a website called Mevwatch info and I'm looking at it right now. It's at 73%. And there's a graph, which is basically. It's seemingly up only in terms of the red area.
00:15:46.704 - 00:15:50.026, Speaker A: Okay, so forget it. I must be thinking of something else.
00:15:50.128 - 00:16:30.778, Speaker C: Okay, so there's kind of several pieces of good news here. One is that relays will completely disappear in two to three years once we have enshrined PBS. Another piece of good news is that this form of censorship is called weak censorship is this idea that transactions actually make it on chain. The only bad thing is that they get delayed a little bit. Now, we can do some quick math. If 80% of the blocks are censoring are OFAC compliant, that means that only one in every block will contain these transactions. And so the average time of inclusion of these transactions will be multiplied by five.
00:16:30.778 - 00:17:21.258, Speaker C: And so the slot time is 12 seconds. Twelve times five is 60 seconds. So it takes 1 minute for a censored transaction to go on chain. Okay, now, this is still ten times faster than bitcoin on average. And I guess the other piece of good news is that there is this community effort, this desire to address this situation, even in the short term, before entry and PBS, and there's various efforts to build credibly neutral relays. And this is something which I don't think has been announced publicly, but I guess I could do it now, is the ultrasound money team is working on such a credibly neutral relay. So we're building the ultrasound relay, which hopefully people will use and help address this situation.
00:17:21.424 - 00:17:47.282, Speaker A: So this brings us to another topic, which is kind of one of the reasons that I invited you on ultrasound money. That's a thing. And this is something that I don't know anything about. And you just talked about a team. It's not just a meme anymore. It's a thing. So tell me a little bit about what is ultrasound money? Maybe even give me a little bit of the background, like, where does this concept start from?
00:17:47.416 - 00:18:18.630, Speaker C: Okay, so let's try and give context and motivation. So, for a lot of technical people, we like to think that blockchains are secured by mathematics and cryptography. And this is where I came in maybe five years ago. But it turns out that this is just not the case. There's two pillars that are securing blockchains. Pillar number one is cryptography, and the other one is economics, and that's why we call it crypto economics. And it turns out that we can make the cryptography level extremely secure.
00:18:18.630 - 00:19:13.950, Speaker C: We can have, like, provably secure 128 bits in the quantum oracle model, whatever, blah, blah, blah. But the economics pillar is much weaker. And it turns out that the overall security is your weakest link. It is important to focus on the economics, and there's this concept called economic security, which basically tries to quantify how much security is backing your system. And it basically puts a number on how many dollars an attacker needs to go attack a specific blockchain. And this is something that hasn't really been done very much until recently. Now, if you go through the exercise, you realize that bitcoin has on the order of five to $10 billion of economic security, meaning that an attacker with that much money can just completely break the system.
00:19:13.950 - 00:19:36.402, Speaker C: They can, for example, only extend the chain with empty blocks. They can start doing reorgs. The whole thing just collapses. And now let's think to ourselves, who has $5 billion? Many, many nation states. Russia, China, the US. $5 billion is peanuts. I mean, even someone like FTX, perfect example.
00:19:36.402 - 00:20:08.846, Speaker C: Sam Bankfront freed. His evil strategy could have been to just 51% attack bitcoin and destroy this whole industry. And so we want to be building settlement layers for the intent of value. We want infrastructure, which is so called world war three proof. And in my opinion, the only way to get there is to have a trillion dollars of security, or ideally, trillions of dollars of economic security. And the reason is that no single attacker can go take down these systems if we're talking about trillions of dollars of economic security.
00:20:08.948 - 00:20:15.886, Speaker A: But when you say economic security, do you still mean needing that much value on the network?
00:20:15.998 - 00:20:16.418, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:16.504 - 00:20:25.122, Speaker A: Does it have to be actually like, money invested, tokens owned? Is it that straight calculation, or is there some other calculation that goes into that?
00:20:25.176 - 00:21:06.638, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great point. There's two concepts here. One is what is called tvs total value secured. And if you go on DFI, llama, or L2 beat, or whatever, there's these websites which will tell you how much value is being secured by these chains. And if you take Ethereum, for example, there's on the order of $300 billion being secured, there's ether itself, the asset, which is about 150,000,000,000. And then the other 150,000,000,000 is eRC, twenty s and NFTs, and all sorts of other things like that. Now, the other important concept is how much value is securing the chain, and that is much, much smaller.
00:21:06.638 - 00:21:45.674, Speaker C: So in the case of Ethereum, proof of stake, it's the amount of e staking, which is about 15 million e, and that corresponds to $18 billion at current prices. And so we have this concept called the security ratio, which is the ratio of the total value secured divided by the total value securing the chain. And we want this security ratio to be low. And right now, the security ratio having a look on autism money is 18.9, meaning that there's roughly 19 times more value being secured on Ethereum than is actually securing Ethereum.
00:21:45.722 - 00:21:50.558, Speaker A: So the staking is the second one, like the amount staked is the second value, correct?
00:21:50.644 - 00:22:12.070, Speaker C: Yes. And you want the second value to be extremely high. Now, if we're going to be securing the Internet of value, we need to appreciate how large the Internet of value is. And it turns out that it's on the order of hundreds of trillions of dollars. Right. If you take all the wealth on the whole world, it's ballpark figure, it's $1 quadrillion.
00:22:12.220 - 00:22:15.510, Speaker A: And if new category.
00:22:17.290 - 00:23:13.114, Speaker C: And we can expect in a success scenario that hundreds of trillions of dollars will flow to the incentive value. And in order to comfortably secure that, we need to have at least, let's say $1 trillion of economic security so that the security ratio doesn't go into the thousands, which would be a very precarious situation to be. And the reason it would be so precarious is because the security ratio measures how much leverage an attacker has to cause damage. If they were to invest $1, they'd be able to break $100 or 200 or $1,000. And one of the kind of scary things with bitcoin, for example, is that we should expect the security ratio to go to roughly 1000. And the reason is that with bitcoin, the issuance is going to zero, and it's only going to be secured by transaction fees. And transaction fees represent roughly 1000 of where we need to be.
00:23:13.114 - 00:23:20.138, Speaker C: And so bitcoin potentially could be attacked with a very small budget in the future relative to its size.
00:23:20.224 - 00:23:37.010, Speaker A: Is this idea here that there will just be fewer miners because it won't be worth it for there to be as many miners? Will there actually be a reduction in number of actors? And that's why it becomes so much easier to attack? That's what I'm sort of trying to figure out. What would an attack like that on bitcoin actually look like?
00:23:37.080 - 00:24:19.834, Speaker C: Right. So in order to perform a 51% attack on bitcoin, you need to have more hash rate, more hash power than the rest of the network combined. And basically what needs to be done is to buy these mining rigs and connect them to the grid and buy the transformers and the cooling and the data centers and whatnot. Now, ballpark figure in the future, my expectation is that the cost to attack bitcoin will be roughly 1000 times less than its market cap. So let's say that bitcoin becomes like gold, $10 trillion market cap, 1000 times less. That would be $10 billion. So it would cost $10 billion in the future to go break bitcoin.
00:24:19.834 - 00:24:52.806, Speaker C: So let's do the math. Let's say that bitcoin becomes like gold. It's a $10 trillion asset. Then the cost of attacking it would be roughly 1000 times less, which is $10 billion. Now, one of the scary things here is that it actually becomes economically rational to go attack bitcoin. And the reason is that you can open a so called short position, and you only need to open a tiny, tiny short position on the order of 0.1% of the total bitcoin supply.
00:24:52.806 - 00:25:10.282, Speaker C: So bitcoin is meant to be this really liquid asset, which is easy to short. Right now, in order to attack bitcoin and be profitable, you need to short maybe 2% or 3% of the total supply is very hard to pull off. But shorting with 0.1% is much, much easier.
00:25:10.346 - 00:25:32.502, Speaker A: In your calculation. You still talk about it as though you'd have to buy all these rigs. But wouldn't it be a lot cheaper if the fees are so low? Don't miners just drop off anyway? The hash power per minor becomes higher anyways. You just have less of them. There's less competition. And maybe I misunderstand the sort of end game of bitcoin here, but that's how it seems like it would work.
00:25:32.636 - 00:26:06.946, Speaker C: No, you're right. I mean, the most likely scenario that I see is that bitcoin will never reach $10 trillion. It will never become the size of gold. And the reason is that it doesn't have this credibly sustainable security model. And so what's most likely to happen, in my opinion, is that it will stay roughly in the current ballpark of, let's say, $1 trillion. And what that means is that the total amount of value that's going to go to the bitcoin miners is actually going to dwindle over time. With every single happening, there's going to be less and less.
00:26:06.946 - 00:26:36.838, Speaker C: And you're right. Today, the bitcoin mining industry is roughly a $10 billion per year industry. In, let's say, 20 years, it might be a $1 billion industry. And so with just $1 billion, you'll be able to take down bitcoin which has a size of $1 trillion. So I'm very bearish on bitcoin over 20 to 30 year time span, because there'll be enough happenings to make the security of bitcoin very precarious, unless I'm.
00:26:36.854 - 00:26:44.030, Speaker A: Going to give the one thing that could happen, unless the community comes together and allows change to happen. Am I right?
00:26:44.100 - 00:27:26.858, Speaker C: That is correct, yes. I mean, it's kind of interesting how bitcoiners have been framing the fact that they don't have an EVM as a security benefit. And the reason is that they have this very simple Utxo model, which means that there's a lower probability of bugs and things like that. But one of the things we've seen empirically is that Ethereum has 100 times the fees of bitcoin, and bitcoin is secured by fees. And so basically, bitcoin has reduced its security by roughly 100 x by being really, really stubborn and saying, no, we will never support smart contracts, and we'll stay with this 1 mb block for ten minutes.
00:27:26.944 - 00:27:45.118, Speaker A: Let's move on to ultrasound money. What is the meme like? A few years ago, everyone was talking about this, but I thought it was kind of a joke or something, and I don't think I followed it closely enough, and I apologize to anyone listening who's deep in it. I feel like I should know this better, but tell me how this starts. Ultrasound money.
00:27:45.204 - 00:28:05.090, Speaker C: It started as a joke, actually, Vitalik came up with the joke. He said, if cap supply of bitcoin is sound money, then decreasing supply ether must be supersonic money. And I kind of made a very small variation of that change supersonic to ultrasound.
00:28:05.170 - 00:28:07.320, Speaker A: Ultrasound, nice.
00:28:07.770 - 00:28:49.382, Speaker C: But, yeah, you might ask yourself, why would the supply of efer decrease? How is that even possible? Well, the reason is that there's two factors that come into determining the supply of efer. One is issuance, which is inflationary in the sense that it increases the supply of efer. And then there's this other thing called the burn with EIP 1559. Every time you make a transaction, it destroys eth. And so if you can burn more eth than you're issuing, then your supply goes down. And this is something that has happened after the merge. And one of the big reasons is that the merge has dramatically reduced issuance on Ethereum by roughly a factor of ten x.
00:28:49.382 - 00:29:05.690, Speaker C: So if you go to the ultrasound money website, you will see the supply of ether having decreased since the merge. And I'm looking at it right now, it's gone down roughly 6000 e since the merge 64 days ago.
00:29:05.760 - 00:29:18.958, Speaker A: Cool. The story of EIP 1559, I did years ago, an episode on that that was controversial at the time. Right. Like, people didn't want this to happen. What were the arguments against it?
00:29:19.044 - 00:29:46.310, Speaker C: Right. So I think controversial is a bit of an overstatement. I think what really happened is that there was a very loud minority. Okay, maybe 1% were against it, but they were pretty loud about it. And this is actually very healthy. We want these contrarians that really question our thinking. And I think part of it was around the novelty of it and the fact that the community wanted to push it through quite quickly.
00:29:46.310 - 00:30:35.394, Speaker C: It had only gone through two or three years of due diligence, and maybe we needed to do more serious due diligence. I think the other aspect around it was that it was a change of user experience for the users. Now there's kind of these two fees, there's the so called base fee, there's the tip. At face value, it sounds like more complicated, but it turns out that from a UX perspective, it was a game changer in terms of dramatically improving the user experience of Ethereum. And the reason is that nowadays you just click send and you don't even have to set your fee. It just works and you get included in the next block. It used to be that you had to participate in this auction where you had to guess kind of the optimal gas price for including transactions.
00:30:35.394 - 00:30:46.950, Speaker C: And so there was kind of two scenarios. Scenario number one is that you underbid and then your transaction is just pending, stuck forever, or you overbid and you feel really bad because you've overpaid.
00:30:47.110 - 00:30:47.482, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:47.536 - 00:30:53.166, Speaker C: And now we have kind of this fair pricing mechanism, which is transparent and very easy to deal with.
00:30:53.268 - 00:30:59.146, Speaker A: When was that actually put through? When did EIP 1559 actually get included?
00:30:59.258 - 00:31:12.114, Speaker C: Right. So it was included 469 days ago. And the reason I know this is because if you go to autonom money and you click the since burn time frame, there's a little fire emoji. It will tell you how many days.
00:31:12.312 - 00:31:15.630, Speaker A: So over a year, basically, exactly over a year.
00:31:15.720 - 00:32:14.482, Speaker C: And we've been burning at a rate of roughly 2 million efer every single year. And in comparison, we are currently issuing on the order of 600,000 efer per year. So we're burning three times faster than we are issuing. And so that kind of leads to a very interesting shape of the supply. So we basically been printing, printing, printing very fast from genesis to the merge. And then the merge is kind of this inflection point, after which the supply kind of starts decreasing and then finds a new asymptote. And so one of the reasons why the oldshawn money meme is kind of important is because it's a shelling point, right? The shape of the supply is very unique, and that creates a shelling point for the community to gather around this asset and recognize it as being special and recognize it as being worthy of so called monetary premium.
00:32:14.482 - 00:32:47.890, Speaker C: Monetary premium is this idea that an asset is somehow worth more than its intrinsic utilitarian value that maybe originates from cash flows. And you can ask yourself, why is monetary premium useful in our industry? And the reason why it's useful is that the only way we can get a trillion dollars of economic security is if we accrue monetary premium. And so monetary premium is actually necessary for ethereum to be successful in its mission of settling the Internet of value.
00:32:48.040 - 00:33:04.466, Speaker A: Interesting. So this is this going back to that, what did you call it, the ratio, like what the actual value of the staked assets are in this thinking, because it has monetary premium, is that actually more valuable than it looks like? It's more valuable than what's actually locked.
00:33:04.658 - 00:33:39.902, Speaker C: Yeah. So as you said, for the security ratio to be reasonably small, we need the value of the e staked to be reasonably large. Now, we can ask ourselves, where does the value of eth even come from? And the way that I think about it is that there's two components. There's kind of the Fundamentals, the cash flows. And this is how people have been valuing companies, for example. So you can think of Ethereum as being a business which sells secure block space. That's the product that's being sold, and people are willing to pay for it with base fees.
00:33:39.902 - 00:34:24.782, Speaker C: And the income is going to be the total amount of ETH that's burnt. That kind of accrues to the ETH holders and Ethereum, the network. Now, in terms of the expenses of this business, it's basically the cost of securing the blockchain, the cost of providing the product, and that's going to be the issuance. And so one of the things that we want is, first of all, this project, this company to be sustainable, right? We want it to be profitable. We want to have more income than expenses. And when that's the case, you can look at profit and you can look at so called p ratios. And so right now, this is something you can see on the ultrasound money website.
00:34:24.916 - 00:34:31.842, Speaker A: We'll definitely add a link to that, by the way, in the show notes, because it seems like there's some awesome dashboards that we can see there, right?
00:34:31.896 - 00:35:42.198, Speaker C: So right now, Ethereum has a pe ratio of roughly 30, which is a reasonable pe ratio of a mature company. It's, like, not too far away from Google, for example. But then once you have this fundamental valuation, in my opinion, we have this idea of monetary premium, which derives from the use of EFA, the asset being used as collateral money. And it's this idea that when you use EFA as collateral, you're reducing the velocity of money, and only a fraction of the total supply is basically privy to these cash flows, the burn and the issuance. So only the portion of ETH which is actively moving in the economy is paying for transaction fees, and that's the portion as well, which is subject to the issuance. Now, you can ask ourselves, why would people use efer as collateral money? And that's kind of these two big use cases. Use case number one is using efer as collateral money for staking, and use case number two is collateral for DFI.
00:35:42.198 - 00:36:15.966, Speaker C: And my expectation is that the vast majority of efer, let's say 80%, will eventually be used as collateral money. And people often think that money is only useful if it's being used for payment and it's moving around. But actually, money can be used when it's just sitting there and doing almost nothing other than backstopping some sort of liability. And so the liability that's backstopped in the case of staking is if you make some bad ass cessations, you make double votes and you get slashed.
00:36:15.998 - 00:36:16.846, Speaker A: Yeah, you get slashed.
00:36:16.878 - 00:36:22.998, Speaker C: And then defi might be backstopping a loan, for example, or backstopping a leverage position or whatever it is.
00:36:23.084 - 00:36:37.818, Speaker A: I want to go back to the monetary premium, though. So if you're using it as collateral, like, is the price of the liquid token always the same as the price of these backstopping ones? The collateralizing ones?
00:36:37.984 - 00:37:15.654, Speaker C: Yes, they are the same. And one way to think about it is imagine that the coins that were used as collateral were completely lost. Then from an accounting perspective, they're still included in the total market cap. But really, in practice, they're just never sold. And so if you want to do a cash flow analysis, you're going to do a cash flow analysis on the liquid tokens. Maybe a more realistic example might be tokens that are currently vesting, right? They're kind of locked, and so they're kind of artificially low velocity. And it's a common trick that founders do.
00:37:15.654 - 00:38:15.990, Speaker C: They have these very large portion of the supply, which is vesting and they kind of artificially inflates the supply. And I don't want to pick specific names, but maybe Solana is a good example where there's been these massive unlocks and the price has dramatically crashed, and it's kind of in, quote, lost some of its monetary premium. But in my opinion, there's this kind of very natural, strong demand for an organic demand for use of low velocity etH, which, in my opinion, shouldn't be accounted for when doing this cash flow analysis. But it's still part of the overall market cap and plays a crucial role for two things. One is economic security that we've talked about, and the other one is this concept of economic bandwidth. Now, if you want to be securing the Internet of value, you need decentralized applications that have access to economic bandwidth. And one of the best examples is decentralized stablecoins.
00:38:15.990 - 00:39:07.286, Speaker C: Right now, we're in a very precarious situation with stablecoins. The major stablecoins, USDT and USDC, are 100% centralized, 100% trustless, trusted, and they're being censored, and there are massive liabilities and systemic risks for the whole space. What we want is decentralized stablecoins. Now, in order to build a strong, decentralized stablecoin, you need what's called over collateralization. You need more collateral than the debt, which is the stablecoin. So what you want is a design like Dai and maker, and maker is one of the largest consumers of economic bandwidth out there. Millions and millions of ETH are being used, but that's still a very small amount of stablecoins.
00:39:07.286 - 00:39:37.470, Speaker C: In the grand scheme of things, Dai has on the order of $10 billion of stablecoins, where we want to be in a position where we have $10 trillion of stablecoins. If you take all the fiat in the world, we're talking on the order of $100 trillion of fiat. That's the order of magnitude. And we're going to want at least $10 trillion in terms of value. And so that means we need at least $10 trillion of economic bandwidth. And again, the only way to get there is through monetary premium.
00:39:37.550 - 00:39:50.726, Speaker A: I want to go back a bit of a step here. So you had said that with EIP 1559, it started to burn things, but emissions were still higher than burn, I guess. Right, like you're saying there was this inflection point at merge.
00:39:50.838 - 00:39:51.450, Speaker C: Yes.
00:39:51.600 - 00:39:53.482, Speaker A: How much did that change?
00:39:53.616 - 00:40:00.534, Speaker C: Yeah. So from an economic standpoint, the merge reduced the amount of issuance by a factor of ten, roughly.
00:40:00.582 - 00:40:00.842, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:00.896 - 00:40:07.886, Speaker C: So before the merge, we had 15,000 e every single day in issuance to.
00:40:07.908 - 00:40:09.230, Speaker A: The miners at the time.
00:40:09.300 - 00:40:22.322, Speaker C: Yes, it was 13.5 to the miners and 1.5 to the proof of stake participants. There was these two chains running in parallel, proof of work and proof of stake. And then the 13.5 disappeared. So we were left with only the 1.5.
00:40:22.322 - 00:40:44.822, Speaker C: So we went from 15,000 e per day to 1.5 thousand e per day, roughly a ten x decrease. And the burn on a daily basis, on average is something like 4000 e burnt. And so before the merge, actually the issuance was overwhelming the burn. But after the merge, the burn is overwhelming the issuance.
00:40:44.966 - 00:40:57.898, Speaker A: Okay, so you have less and less of the overall supply going forward. And you have some of these things locked in staking, you have some of them locked in defi, you have some that are liquid.
00:40:57.994 - 00:40:58.686, Speaker C: Yes.
00:40:58.868 - 00:41:21.842, Speaker A: I still don't really understand where the monetary premium comes in, though. Are you saying that you take that number of tokens, you multiply it by the price per one token? That's the market cap. The number of tokens are going down. So you're thinking like the value of each individual token will go up if the market cap stays steady. But what is the monetary premium on that? That's what I didn't fully get from what you explained.
00:41:21.906 - 00:41:56.660, Speaker C: Okay, so there's kind of two ways to think of monetary premium. There's kind of the qualitative way and the quantitative way. Let's start with the qualitative way, which is that monetary premium is something very special. It's kind of the societal illusion that we've agreed that we're going to use one specific asset as money. And how do societies coordinate on choosing one specific asset? It used to be salt and then shells and then gold and silver. And it's kind of evolved over time. Maybe bitcoin soon, maybe ether soon.
00:41:56.660 - 00:42:35.920, Speaker C: And it turns out that the way we coordinate as humans to a large extent is through shelling points and memes. Right? And this is part of the reason why this all shell money meme is so important. And one of the most important memes in money is around scarcity. That's why bitcoin has such a huge emphasis on this 21 million limit. Right? And so the old cell money meme is kind of the equivalent of the 21 million bitcoin limit is kind of the scarcity meme. But there's other things which are important as shedding points. Like one very, very important shedding point in the context of blockchains is security.
00:42:35.920 - 00:43:28.890, Speaker C: And today ethereum is the most secure blockchain in the world. It has the most amount of economic security, roughly $20 billion, at least twice more than bitcoin. And so it has these two most important selling points going for it. It's the most secure and the most scarce blockchain in the world, where the supply will decrease for the next 100 years and the supply of bitcoin, for example, will inflate, will increase for the next hundred years. So the scarcity is kind of very much black and white, and so is the security. And so as a society, there is a possibility that we agree that e for the asset is worthy of monetary premium. And not only is it worthy, but it's kind of necessary for it to be successful in its mission of securing the Internet of value by providing economic security and provider economic bandwidth.
00:43:28.890 - 00:44:00.938, Speaker C: Now, once as a society, we've kind of agreed on these shelling points. We can ask ourselves, how much monetary premium can we expect from a quantitative standpoint? And the way that it works here is just a model, right? It's just a way to think about it. It's kind of the best model that I've found so far is to look at the so called velocity of money. So there's two types of money, in my opinion. There's kind of cold money and hot money. Hot money is what's known as currency. The word currency comes from word current.
00:44:00.938 - 00:44:47.670, Speaker C: It means money that flows. So you can think of money that's used for payments of nfts, for example, or even payments of block space, for transaction fees. And that's one important part, because it leads to cash flows around the burn. And you can think of this hot money aspect of the economy as being like a company. But then there's this other also very important aspect of the ethereum economy, which is the cold money, the cold EFA. And that's where the collateral comes in. And if we have, let's say, 90% of all EF, which is in the cold money scenario, then in my opinion, these 90% don't really play a part in the cash flows.
00:44:47.670 - 00:45:49.642, Speaker C: Ethereum, the company, is really only the hot money. Everything else is this other thing. It's kind of this use as a collateral money. And so if the 10% of the supply is worth, let's say, $1 trillion because of cash flows, it's a very successful company like Apple or Google, which has a lot of income and relatively few expenses, then the other 90% should give it kind of a ten x monetary premium. So there's this illiquidity multiplier, that's another term that I use, which is that because part of it is liquid, it comes in as a multiplier in your overall valuation, in terms of the fully diluted valuation. And it's the same thing with some blockchains out there where maybe 90% of the tokens are illiquid because they're vesting. And so there's this ten x illiquidity multiplier that should be accounted for when you're looking at the whole market cap.
00:45:49.642 - 00:46:52.518, Speaker C: But unfortunately, vesting is not sustainable, and it's artificial. On the other hand, staking and use of ether in defi is organic, it's natural. And the reason is that it's tied to this idea of the cost of money, right? So when you're staking, you have various costs involved. You need to pay for your hardware, for your Internet connection, electricity, and you need to pay what I call capital costs, which is the opportunity cost of money. And it turns out that the vast majority of the costs are opportunity costs of money. And so if the cost of money is, let's say, 3%, what we should expect is that in the equilibrium, the amount of each staked is going to be such that the issuance is going to be roughly 3%, so that profit margins kind of tend to zero and validators are still profitable. And it turns out that if with a 3% cost of money, we should expect about 30 million e staked.
00:46:52.518 - 00:47:37.630, Speaker C: So that's kind of a huge lump of ether which organically will be locked up and with low velocity, and then something, I think similar will happen. In the context of stablecoins, we need decentralized stablecoins. There's no other way. In my opinion, we can't be successful without these decentralized stablecoins. Someone I'm hoping will make a massive breakthrough in terms of improving the user experience or the tokenomics around it or something, and that will lead to a huge demand for EFA, the asset, as collateral. Now, one of the things you can ask yourself is, can we use other forms of collateral than Efer? And it turns out that for staking, there's no choice. You have to use efer and nothing else.
00:47:37.630 - 00:48:04.978, Speaker C: For Defi, you do have choice, but there is strong reasons to use efer specifically. And the term that we use here is we say that it's pristine collateral. Efer is the only form of collateral that has no contract risk, no governance risk, no oracle risk, all sorts of tell risks that no custodial risk, no counterparty risk, and that makes it a very attractive asset for use in deFi.
00:48:05.074 - 00:48:17.100, Speaker A: Why, when you talk about stablecoins backed by crypto, why does dai not work? Why does maker Dow's product not satisfy what you want?
00:48:17.870 - 00:48:37.550, Speaker C: Right. The main problem is that there isn't enough economic bandwidth. So I can check the numbers, but I think roughly speaking, dai is using 3 million each now, and that corresponds to some amount of decentralized stable coins.
00:48:37.630 - 00:48:52.258, Speaker A: Are you just saying it's not popular enough yet? I'm curious, if there's like, why isn't it? Then what kind of breakthrough would you need? Would it just be like a marketing breakthrough, like getting more people to participate in it? Or is it like you need a new concept?
00:48:52.354 - 00:49:31.634, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's say that we want to increase the total amount of decentralized stable coins by a fact of 1000, which is what we need to fulfill our vision of being the incentive of value. How can we do that? Well, option number one is just for dai to be more popular in the sense that more eth is being used to back Dai. But the problem is that there's only so much e out there. So if you're using 3 million, then maybe you can increase that to 30 ten x. But pushing it beyond that is going to be very, very hard because there's a very limited supply of Efer. And so really that shows you the importance of the e price itself.
00:49:31.634 - 00:50:17.326, Speaker C: So you've got a ten x by having more ef as collateral, but you need another 100 x. That has to come from just the price of e increasing. And that's to a large extent only possible through efer gathering monetary premium. And in order for it to get to that point, we need kind of memes, we need shelling points, we need society to kind of somehow believe that e for the asset is worthy of monetary premium. And basically education, which is what the ultrasound money meme is all about, is about spreading this message and encouraging people to learn about e for the asset and appreciate its shelling points may help e for the asset accrue monetary premium.
00:50:17.438 - 00:50:35.014, Speaker A: I'm so not an economist, but when you say monetary premium, should we be thinking price worth more like token worth more than it seems? Every time you say it, I'm still like, oh, what is he trying to tell me? What's the translation for what that actually is?
00:50:35.132 - 00:51:16.178, Speaker C: So there's two things that need to happen. First of all is that Ethereum needs to be a super successful business. It needs to sell a ton of secure block space, and scalability is going to play a very important role here, so that billions of people can be paying these transaction fees, and that leads to income and profit for Ethereum. And here we have this ultra high velocity economy, which is very successful, but what we also need is kind of this ultra low velocity economy to also be successful. And the reason is that it's going to lead to this illiquidity multiplier to kick in by a factor of roughly ten x is what we can expect in the best case.
00:51:16.264 - 00:51:36.118, Speaker A: And this market, where is this price even picked from though? You talk about the multiplier, but is this like on Coingecko? It'll show up higher for some reason. This is where I don't get what's it compared to that multiplier of value, right? Versus what is your baseline? Are you still basing it on USD?
00:51:36.214 - 00:52:07.880, Speaker C: Actually, the baseline is the fundamental value as a company. And I think the best example I can give here is gold. So gold is a $10 trillion asset. And you can ask yourself, where does the value of gold come from? Now, it turns out that gold is an industrial metal. It's an extremely useful industrial metal. In every single iPhone and computer, or really strictly any piece of electronics, there's gold that's being used. And if you try to value gold based on its cash flows as its industrial metal, it should be worth on the order of $1 trillion.
00:52:07.880 - 00:52:27.110, Speaker C: Now you can ask yourself, where does the extra $9 trillion come from? Well, it comes from the fact that there's this crazy societal illusion that we think of gold as money, love of, and people are keeping it in vault and central banks are locking it up and people use it as jewelry.
00:52:27.190 - 00:52:28.742, Speaker A: They love it because it's shiny.
00:52:28.806 - 00:53:02.760, Speaker C: Yes. So the shininess kind of. And jewelry might be the equivalent of this silly joke, ultrasound, money, meme. But okay, it's still extremely important. So it just turns out empirically that societal illusions or myths are extremely valuable in society. And one example here might be the nation state, right? If you look at boundaries and frontiers, this is just completely arbitrary. People just get excited about the flag and their football team or something.
00:53:02.760 - 00:53:54.422, Speaker C: Think of the legal system and the police system. Why is it that people in suits and a stick and they somehow get authority, but if some other random person in the street would perform the same exact actions as police, but they didn't have the uniform, then people would start freaking out, what about religion? Right? Religion is kind of like there's these crosses, and I don't want to insult anyone, but there's all these symbolism which rituals, and yet religion is extremely powerful. It has allowed the coordinations of millions, if not billions of people to do all sorts of things, some good, some bad, maybe crusades, arguably a bad thing, I don't know. But yeah, money is one of these societal illusions, which is just incredibly useful, just as a coordination tool.
00:53:54.476 - 00:53:54.882, Speaker A: Totally.
00:53:54.946 - 00:53:58.742, Speaker C: Just like the legal system or nation states or religion.
00:53:58.806 - 00:54:17.486, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, now I want to understand, like ultrasoundmoney eth. So it was a meme. It was like a joke. It was a concept. It kind of informed some economic planning or thought research, the work that you've been doing. But what is it? Also, it's a team.
00:54:17.486 - 00:54:20.910, Speaker A: Is it a, like, what is this ultrasound money?
00:54:20.980 - 00:54:46.230, Speaker C: Right. So originally it just started as a joke, and then it became kind of this educational website, and now it's a community, a movement. So it turns out that David Hoffman, who is one of the hosts of the bankless show, came up with emojis to describe the ultrasound moneymen. He had the bat and the sound emoji, because bats produce ultrasound. So that is a good set of emojis.
00:54:46.810 - 00:54:54.218, Speaker A: This is making some of Twitter make more sense to me. I was so out of the loop. Justin, this is hilarious. Okay, yes, keep going.
00:54:54.304 - 00:55:40.766, Speaker C: So, emojis are kind of one of the most condensed forms of communicating information, and memes are nothing but that. They're kind of these small pieces of cultural information that kind of spread virally from mind to mind, very similar to a virus, a biological virus that spreads from body to body. And it just so happens that we have on our hands a pretty viral meme, where we now have over 6000 accounts on Twitter that have this bad signal. And the Twitter account is just a meme machine. Right. Its role is just to spread the meme further and further, partly through building out the website, but also through trying to foster this community. So there's a poop that's been issued.
00:55:40.766 - 00:56:17.014, Speaker C: There's also a discord, which is going to be open in a few weeks. And there's all sorts of initiatives that are being put forward to try and spread the meme more. And one of the latest initiatives that I mentioned earlier in the podcast is this ultrasound relay, where we're trying to improve the PR, the image of Ethereum. Really, this censorship problem has no fundamentals, right? Because as I mentioned, sensor transactions take 1 minute to come on chain, which is totally fine. It's not an issue, but from a PR standpoint, it just doesn't look good. So it's kind of an anti shelling point, as it were, which we're trying.
00:56:17.052 - 00:56:26.358, Speaker A: To address, what's your relationship to the ultrasound money movement? Do you run the Twitter account? Who runs the Twitter account?
00:56:26.524 - 00:56:42.954, Speaker C: Right. So I bought the ultrasound money domain, and at the end of a two and a half hour long podcast on the backlist, I said, I bought the domain, let's try and do some sort something with it. And like ten people came to me and said, I want to help out.
00:56:42.992 - 00:56:43.350, Speaker A: Cool.
00:56:43.440 - 00:57:28.746, Speaker C: And right now we have about four people that are kind of working full time. There's two devs, and there's one person who spends her time responding to dms and things like that, and there's also me. And we're trying to just grow organically. We think of ourselves as a public good, and very recently we received public good funding. Initially, it was me that has been funding this project out of my personal money. But it looks like we might be able to diversify the sources of funding, and if the meme becomes successful, then maybe we can be like a ten or 20 or 100 people project.
00:57:28.848 - 00:57:33.578, Speaker A: Cool. And you want to actually create a new relayers. Are you competing with flashbots?
00:57:33.754 - 00:58:12.742, Speaker C: I don't think flashbots is very happy with the current situation. I think flashbots wants to focus on the builder side of things. They have this suave and the decentralized builder, and I think them running a relay is more of a necessary evil. And I think they're waiting for the relay ecosystem to mature a bit more before maybe moving out of the relay game. So I think they're very encouraging, and I've had discussions with them where they're really encouraging of this effort to put forward an ultrasound relay.
00:58:12.806 - 00:58:27.166, Speaker A: I want to just mention one other thing before we sign off, which is zero knowledge technology. I sort of want to go back to the earlier topic of like, vdfs. Is there any VDF ZK overlap? Is there any way for those to be used together?
00:58:27.268 - 00:58:52.294, Speaker C: Absolutely, yes. So it turns out that the VDF that we have built an ASIC for needs to be paired with a zero knowledge proof system, a snark. And basically the snark provides the V in the VDF, the verifiable. It allows you to verify that time has elapsed without having to do the computation, the sequential computation yourself.
00:58:52.412 - 00:59:07.050, Speaker A: Amazing. So there's a snark in the VDF construction, actually. But when you talk about the ASIC, I know there's also ZK ASICs, or like ZK hardware being developed. Would you have like a shared hardware piece doing both of these things, then?
00:59:07.120 - 00:59:30.818, Speaker C: Great question. So right now, the ASIC does only the sequential computation, and we're doing the SNOC proving in gpus, but the firm foundation and various other people in the ecosystem want to build a snark ASIC. And so that is kind of what we're actively thinking about in terms of the next ASIC that we would go build.
00:59:30.904 - 00:59:59.370, Speaker A: Neat. There's like some community efforts, like things like Zprize, which are also created in order to push that work. Now, before we sign off, I just have one last thing I want to mention, and that's the Nova whiteboard sessions. We actually recorded this earlier this year. It's just come out. It's part of the whiteboard sessions that we've been Nova. Like, do you do any work on that? I was actually always curious when I talked to you about doing the whiteboard, you were like, let me present this really cool paper.
00:59:59.370 - 01:00:06.830, Speaker A: But are you still working sort of in the ZK direction? Are you still doing research in our space?
01:00:06.980 - 01:00:24.258, Speaker C: Yeah. So Nova is a really exciting construction, because you can think of it as essentially the fastest snock you could ever hope for if you're working with elliptic curves, and it's the one that we're using for the VDF project.
01:00:24.344 - 01:00:25.170, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
01:00:25.320 - 01:01:08.130, Speaker C: And one of the really exciting properties of Nova is that not only is it optimal from approver standpoint, but it's extremely hardware acceleration friendly, partly because it doesn't have these ffts. And so it's one of the prime targets to be building a snark ASIC for. And one of the end games in the ethereum roadmap is this idea of a Zkevm at layer one. And in order to get there right now, we're off from a performance standpoint by several orders of magnitude. And having this hardware acceleration is going to be a critical part to getting to where we want to be.
01:01:08.200 - 01:01:27.046, Speaker A: That is so cool. Bringing it back to Zkevm. Yes, we've done a few episodes on that, so I'll try to dig one up and add it here. But, yeah, share. I mean, maybe as a sign off. What is that vision? Share a little bit about next stages or what you're seeing coming up.
01:01:27.148 - 01:01:27.800, Speaker C: Okay.
01:01:29.530 - 01:01:33.706, Speaker A: I feel like we have a whole episode ahead of us. We let ourselves, but, yeah, go for it.
01:01:33.728 - 01:02:13.606, Speaker C: Yeah. So I have a very kind of crazy vision, which is that I'm hoping that the proving for the ZK vms will happen not in data centers like it's currently happening for many of the ZK rollups. A lot of the ZK rollups, because it's still, very early days, they have so called centralized proving. And what they do is that they rent out racks and racks and racks of hardware on AWS or some other hosting provider. And this is not good for liveness in the sense that if this centralized proverb goes down, everything kind of collapses. The ZK roll up stalls. Instead.
01:02:13.606 - 01:03:22.346, Speaker C: I think the position where we want to be in is we have these pieces of hardware which allows people from home to be participating in the proving. And we have this idea of a distributed prover network where collaboratively, like a few of these machines, can build proofs for these roll ups. Now, one of the interesting thing here is that it's possible that ASics are more about decentralization than they are about performance. And one of the consequences here is that really what we need is people to have the hardware in their home and be able to turn it on if and when a primary prover goes down. So I kind of see, my vision is that there's a hybrid model, it's the backup. And so it's kind of an insane thing where we'd be investing tens of millions of dollars to build these pieces of hardware to ship them to people around the world. And then they just never turned on.
01:03:22.346 - 01:03:48.434, Speaker C: They're just connected to the Internet and powered on and ready to turn on at a moment's notice, but they're never actually turned on. And so that means that there's no impact from a power consumption standpoint. There's no impact from a heat standpoint or a noise standpoint. And because it's an ASIC, which is custom designed for this one specific operation, it's a very small box with a low footprint, and it's kind of this crazy vision.
01:03:48.562 - 01:03:54.550, Speaker A: Wow, that's like the. That's like, that's the World War II kind of scenario, too.
01:03:54.620 - 01:03:55.240, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:03:56.010 - 01:04:16.622, Speaker A: Cool. Well, Justin, thank you so much for coming on the show and sharing this amazing update. I loved this conversation. I feel like I got a chance to ask you about, obviously, like this big meme I clearly had missed, but also I love how it sort of circles back through the vdfs and things we had talked about earlier. It's really great catching up.
01:04:16.676 - 01:04:18.634, Speaker C: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. Anna.
01:04:18.682 - 01:04:25.530, Speaker A: I want to say a big thank you to the podcast team, Henrik, Tanya and Rachel, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.
