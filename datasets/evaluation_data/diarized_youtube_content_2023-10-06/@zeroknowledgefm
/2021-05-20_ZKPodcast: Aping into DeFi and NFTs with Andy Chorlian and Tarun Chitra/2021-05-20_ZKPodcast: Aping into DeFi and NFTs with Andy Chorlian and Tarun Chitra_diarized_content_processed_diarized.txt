00:00:05.450 - 00:00:07.610, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge.
00:00:07.770 - 00:00:10.090, Speaker B: I'm your host, Anna Rose.
00:00:10.250 - 00:00:21.280, Speaker A: In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online.
00:00:26.970 - 00:01:25.670, Speaker B: This week, Tarun and I chat with Andy Chorleon. We talk about his journey starting as a makerdao dev all the way to NBA Topshot star, and how this has influenced his new project, fractional, and how it connects to the pleaser Dao, a Dao that has recently outbid the competition and bought the Edward Snowden NFT. This episode really explores the connection between NFTs, Daos and Defi and how these overlaps could enable some truly futuristic ways to allocate value and create value. Now, before we start in, I want to remind you to check out the ZK Jobs board that I mentioned last week. I update this every month to coincide with the ZK Jobs fair. I also recommend you sign up for the Zero Knowledge Announcement newsletter to stay up to date about all the activity over here in the zero Knowledge community, and it's hard to keep track. Do join our Telegram group to join the conversation, and I've also added the links to both the ZK Jobs board and the Zero Knowledge announcement newsletter in the show notes.
00:01:25.670 - 00:02:10.886, Speaker B: I now want to take a moment to thank this week's sponsor and a ZK focused project that I'm proud to be advising on. Mina Mina is the world's lightest blockchain powered by participants. It is a layer one protocol creating a private gateway between the real world and crypto. The entire chain is about 22 kb, thanks to ZK snarks. The layer one protocol replaces the traditional blockchain with the Zero knowledge proof, ensuring a super light and constant sized chain. This allows participants to quickly sync and verify the network. The entire chain is and will always be around 22 kb, even as it scales, and snark powered dapps called snaps allow access to verified real world data from any website for Onchain use.
00:02:10.886 - 00:02:30.860, Speaker B: The ecosystem is growing fast and Mina's mainnet has just gone live, which offers users a platform to build a private gateway between the real world and crypto. To find out more, visit minaprotocol.com. I've added the link in the show notes, so thank you again, Mina. Now here is the conversation between Andy Tarune and myself.
00:02:34.190 - 00:02:42.490, Speaker A: Today. Tarun and I chat with Andy Choilian from the fractional project, and he's also part of something called Pleaserdao. So welcome to the show Andy.
00:02:42.570 - 00:02:44.626, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me excited to be here.
00:02:44.728 - 00:02:51.618, Speaker A: So maybe to start off, tell us a little bit about what fractional is and also what pleaserdao is.
00:02:51.784 - 00:04:01.894, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So fractional is a new project that I started working on a few months ago, and it's focused around fractionalization of nfts, which have, obviously, nfts have kind of captured a lot of the crypto Twitter sphere and general mindshare over the last couple of months, and I got pretty interested in them over the last half of a year or so, or now even a little longer than that. And so fractional, as a protocol, is going to allow you to take an NFT or a basket of nfts and lock them up into what we're calling a vault and then create fractional ownership tokens of that NFT that are just normal erc 20 tokens. So that's fractional. And then pleaser Dow is kind of this new strange dow that popped up back when people pleaser released her x times y equals k nft on foundation. And I was actually part of the initial little group chat to form pleaserdao. One of my friends, Jamis, messaged myself and a couple other people and said, hey, this thing is really cool.
00:04:01.894 - 00:04:23.070, Speaker C: Do you want to try to buy this? And we were like, yeah, sure, let's do it. And we didn't really know it was going to turn into what it has turned into. There were a lot more people who were interested than we expected, and now it's kind of formed into a bit of a bigger collective of generally defi people who are interested in art and NFTs and defi stuff.
00:04:23.220 - 00:04:25.690, Speaker A: And Tarun, are you part of this, too?
00:04:25.860 - 00:04:34.260, Speaker D: I am. I was also in this genesis group of people, but I regret not, as they say, aping in more.
00:04:34.630 - 00:04:35.620, Speaker C: Me too.
00:04:37.190 - 00:04:47.798, Speaker A: I want to go back to this later on in the episode. Right now, I want to hear a little bit about your background. Let's go back pre crypto. Where were you at and kind of what led you to here?
00:04:47.884 - 00:05:00.640, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I went to school for computer engineering, and I didn't really know. So at the time, I thought I was interested in hardware. I wasn't interested in hardware. I learned that.
00:05:01.170 - 00:05:01.902, Speaker A: That's good.
00:05:01.956 - 00:06:02.410, Speaker C: Yeah, that's good. And so then I found myself at a pretty generic software company that was owned by Fidelity called Emoney, doing general, kind of like back end work, working in c sharp. I was there for around a year, and this was from 2016 to 2017, summer. And kind of in the early spring that year, I had started to get interested in crypto. And this all stemmed from wanting to gamble on an offshore sports gambling website and not wanting to give them my credit card. And so I downloaded Coinbase and started was like, all right, what are these things that I'm buying? And I just got totally captivated by it and just realized that this was something I was extremely interested in and I thought was just so cool. And so then I was lucky enough in August of 2017 to get a job at a fintech startup in New York that was tangentially interested in crypto, and they knew I was interested in crypto.
00:06:02.410 - 00:06:45.294, Speaker C: And so I kind of fell into a position where I got to learn solidity on the job, and we made an ERC 20 token and did all that fun stuff. And so I worked there for about a year. For a while, I was the only crypto person on the team. And then we eventually brought on Noah's inswiser from Uniswap, prior to him being at uniswap. And I worked with him for a bit. And then around the same time, this was towards the end of 2018, I had left to go to maker, and I spent two years ish at maker on the smart contracts team doing a little bit of everything that we need to do for the smart contracts team. And so for a while, that was prepping for McD's release, and a lot of the formal verification and testing around that.
00:06:45.294 - 00:07:00.450, Speaker C: When I joined, a lot of the code was already completed. And then a lot of the stuff that came after that with Black Thursday and working on new liquidation systems, which actually, I think, just released today for link, which is exciting. And then also.
00:07:00.520 - 00:07:02.050, Speaker A: What's Black Thursday?
00:07:03.270 - 00:07:04.242, Speaker C: Oh, man.
00:07:04.376 - 00:07:06.260, Speaker A: All right. Oh, yeah.
00:07:07.350 - 00:07:08.790, Speaker C: Am I supposed to know this?
00:07:08.940 - 00:07:09.638, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:07:09.804 - 00:07:16.470, Speaker D: This is, like, the biggest day in DFI. It's like the big crash. We've talked about it on the show before.
00:07:16.540 - 00:07:17.734, Speaker A: Maybe not really.
00:07:17.852 - 00:07:18.470, Speaker E: Yes.
00:07:18.620 - 00:07:19.302, Speaker A: Damn it.
00:07:19.356 - 00:07:21.434, Speaker D: It's March twelveth 2020.
00:07:21.632 - 00:07:29.494, Speaker C: Yeah. So this was right, as Covid was kind of really coming into its own, which is a weird thing to say about a pandemic.
00:07:29.542 - 00:07:31.706, Speaker A: Was this just the day that everything crashed?
00:07:31.818 - 00:07:32.286, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:32.388 - 00:07:38.880, Speaker A: Oh, wait, is this the day that everything crashed? And makers, like, what are they called? Cdps, all got.
00:07:40.530 - 00:08:19.958, Speaker C: I was, at the time, my girlfriend Allie was working and living in London, and so I was visiting her in London. And so the crash happened pretty early in the morning us time. And so I was, like, sitting at a coffee shop, eating some lunch and just on my laptop, and all of a sudden, I see all these messages come in, like, are you guys seeing what's happening? What's going on? And I was like, oh, crap. That. I grabbed all my stuff and left the coffee shop and went back to her apartment. And essentially what happened was crypto and kind of everything flash crashed. And what we learned was the maker liquidation systems were not totally prepared for a massive flash crash.
00:08:19.958 - 00:08:53.750, Speaker C: But also there was a lot of other stuff that was going on. There was difficulty getting transactions through to maker. And, I mean, some people even still think there could have been some type of minor manipulation there. I didn't spend enough time to really have strong feelings about that. But essentially what ended up happening is when cdps are liquidated, they basically go up for auction, and someone was putting up bids that were extremely low, one guay bids, and the bid length was only ten minutes. And so after ten minutes, if no one had outbid you, you would win. And people just weren't prepared for this and were having trouble getting transactions through.
00:08:53.750 - 00:09:14.654, Speaker C: And so the gas fees were insanely high. And so, for example, the makers keeper network code had, like, a hard cap on gas fees at, like, 400 gwe. And I think it was up more in, like, the 500 range. So none of the bots would work, and they couldn't get transactions through. And so a lot of cdps were liquidated for basically nothing. And so that was Black Thursday, and.
00:09:14.692 - 00:09:16.382, Speaker A: You were at maker at that time?
00:09:16.516 - 00:09:19.902, Speaker C: Yeah, the rest of my time in London, I basically spent working.
00:09:20.036 - 00:09:58.566, Speaker D: Can we get a little color on what it's like being a developer in the war room on Black Thursday? Because that's probably one of the. Since 2017. Certainly the craziest day. Of course, prior to 2017, there was Kenny, stop trading and things like that. But that was the craziest day. You're working at the developer that made the thing that was losing the most money and had the most at stake. What was it like, just stress wise? And that's different than being on call at a tech company, right? This is like, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars are about to be liquidated.
00:09:58.758 - 00:10:50.790, Speaker C: Well, yeah, so it was really stressful. I think one of the hardest parts, too, was because it's all smart contracts and kind of coda's law, we felt a little bit helpless in a lot of things, and so part of it was once we kind of realized what was happening, oracles would update every hour, and so every hour you'd have a wave of liquidations. And so most of those liquidations happened over a period of a couple hours. And so then it was trying to figure out, like, the first couple of waves, we just didn't really have time to appropriately respond and figure anything out. And then relatively quickly after that, some people spun up just like some internal code so that we as employees could bid on these things. Or anyone who had money and wanted to try to bid on these cdps that were being liquidated could try to come in and just help. I was literally on ether scan trying to put through bids on different cdps that were being liquidated.
00:10:50.790 - 00:11:18.578, Speaker C: And that was what was hard about it. We couldn't just push a code through because maker governance has a whole governance process and all this. It was hard. There was a lot of internal discussion about calling emergency shutdown and what that would do. I think that was really where the stress came in. There was a group of people who felt that we should call and shut down the system and a group of people who were like, no, that's not the right way to handle this situation. And I think in the end, the right decision was made not to shut everything down.
00:11:18.578 - 00:11:36.890, Speaker C: But it was very stressful. And then a lot of what came after that, after the first couple of hours, was just like an insane amount of calls trying to figure out what do we do? How do we rectify this? How do we calculate what the damage done actually was? And kind of what is our process to move forward from this?
00:11:37.040 - 00:11:44.158, Speaker A: Wow. But wait, they could have stopped it. When you say shut it down, that's sort of surprising to me. That was even an option.
00:11:44.244 - 00:12:20.794, Speaker C: Well, so Makerdao, the protocol has an emergency shutdown where if you burn 50,000 mkr, it basically just kind of ceases the protocol and there's a whole unwinding that comes along with that and stuff. But, so that was basically the conversation was, is the fallout that's going to come from calling emergency shutdown? And basically you'd basically have to rebootstrap, die. You'd have to start over again. Versus the fallout of people losing money from cdps, getting liquidated for next to nothing, kind of weighing those pros and cons and figuring that out.
00:12:20.912 - 00:13:01.446, Speaker D: And for the record, that is probably one of the most extreme engineering situations I think anyone has lived in. In crypto that day, not just for maker, but, like, BitMex went down. I mean, that led to Bitmex's collapse in a lot of ways, was how much money people lost that day due to systems failing. So, like, the craziest stress test of all of the engineering in this industry took place on Monday during this crazy crash. And it's important not to understate that, because most networks, especially new networks, have never even come close to dealing with 50% of their network getting liquidated all.
00:13:01.468 - 00:13:04.086, Speaker A: At once in like 12 hours or something.
00:13:04.188 - 00:13:09.894, Speaker D: 1 hour bitmex was a crazy thing when that happened.
00:13:10.012 - 00:13:32.734, Speaker C: Yeah, that is crazy to think about. In my mind. I have a hard time imagining what could possibly happen that could be a more catastrophic market event than that for a system like maker at least. And if they were able to withstand that and continue to go through, it would have to be a bug in the code that actually broke the system. At this point, it feels like for, that's the only thing worse for it to collapse.
00:13:32.782 - 00:13:33.426, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:33.608 - 00:14:12.700, Speaker D: After the most calamitous collapse in this industry, then we had this crazy, insane bull market. And part of the bull market was really driven by yield farming and sort of these protocols giving out tokens to users directly, which is a very different model than like proof of stake networks where you sell the tokens or distribute tokens upfront instead of distributing them to users per se. It's a kind of different go to market model. And in the process you got involved at yearn pretty heavily. So I think maybe walk us through how your dgen habits somehow made it on.
00:14:14.270 - 00:15:11.226, Speaker C: I was actually, all things considered, I would say I was a tiny bit late to defi summer for a I when Wifi came out. And there was that one week of farming, I was on vacation with my girlfriend's family, and I missed all of that farming. So that was a bummer. But what I found really, really interesting about a lot of Defi summer and all of that was a lot of the strategies and figuring out how to more efficiently farm and do all that stuff. And so back in September, October, I started to get pretty active in yearn and the strategist group, as that was kind of starting to be built out a little bit more. And so what I was primarily focused on at that point was sushi swap farming. So they were like pretty generic strategies, which were, you were depositing liquidity positions into a urine vault and farming sushi tokens.
00:15:11.226 - 00:15:59.198, Speaker C: And then part of the interesting evolution of these strategies was urine's kind of change in relationship with sushi. And it created some interesting problems where originally we were farming and dumping sushi tokens, and then urine kind of creates a pretty strong working relationship with sushi. And so at that point, we changed the strategy from farming and dumping sushi to farming sushi and staking it in ex sushi and earning more x sushi. Yeah. So that was kind of a fun part of the defi summer for me was trying to figure out more programmatic ways to be involved and also help other people do the ridiculous things that I was doing. Because there was a period of time in September where I was just not really sleeping and just aping money into every single asian food name.
00:15:59.364 - 00:16:02.350, Speaker A: Did you have a job at maker at this time?
00:16:02.420 - 00:16:04.038, Speaker C: Yeah, I was still working at Maker.
00:16:04.154 - 00:16:08.018, Speaker D: I'm sure everyone at Maker was doing this because we were all in a.
00:16:08.024 - 00:16:09.474, Speaker C: Group chat together, all different.
00:16:09.672 - 00:16:12.050, Speaker D: It's like you're already in the weeds.
00:16:12.390 - 00:16:41.230, Speaker C: Yeah, well, and that's where having people who you know and trusted in the space was insanely valuable. So we had a signal chat with, like, ten people in it, and it was a lot of smart contract developers. And one person would find a new farm and they'd post it in the signal chat, and we would all pull it up on our code diffs and stuff, and we'd look through it and go, yes, looks good to me. And then we'd all just dive in right at the start. We'd have, like, timers and keep each other already and stuff. It was a really weird time.
00:16:41.380 - 00:16:45.070, Speaker A: Very bonding, though. It sounds like a fun game with some friends.
00:16:45.220 - 00:16:47.390, Speaker D: Like summer camp Covid edition.
00:16:49.650 - 00:16:50.158, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:50.244 - 00:16:50.880, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:16:51.410 - 00:17:21.530, Speaker D: So before kind of after you learned a lot about Defi summer, you decided, hey, I'm going to go for Maker, which was an organization, I suppose at this point is more like in maintenance mode than in adding new products mode. High velocity, because it has a ton of value in it, so it can't move quickly, as quickly to somewhere kind of smaller. So maybe you want to walk us through that. And then how that led to you becoming the face of NBA topshots in the journal.
00:17:22.430 - 00:17:50.354, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Yeah. What you said exactly of I found myself. So Defi Summer kind of reignited in me, like, remembering just how cool ethereum is. There was a period of time, kind of while Mallmaker was in maintenance and stuff, where it was really easy to just be tangentially involved on Twitter and tweet about stuff every once in a while and then do my nine to five solidity work and kind of call it a day. And Defi Summer was just so insane. And I was like, oh, this is really fun.
00:17:50.354 - 00:18:28.730, Speaker C: This is what's really cool. And so after that, definitely found myself in a place where I wanted to get back to more rapidly iterating and building and having fun with all that kind of stuff. And so that was why I found myself at yearn. And then at that point, I was pretty set that I was going to move on from maker just kind of when the opportunity arose and figure out what I was going to do next. And I had a good friend reach out and say, hey, I know these guys who are starting a new project. Would you want to kind of read what their kind of docs are looking like and their idea? Because he knew that I was relatively knowledgeable about on chain strategies and farming and stuff like that. And so that was element finance.
00:18:28.730 - 00:19:33.966, Speaker C: And so I ended up after kind of talking with Will and Johnny, the co founders, I decided to join that team and help them out kind of as someone who knew a lot about yearn and knew a lot about strategies. And so the idea of element is basically to take deposited positions into yield bearing protocols and kind of cut up that position into two separate tokens, one which is your principal and one which is your interest. And those are based over a deposit that's kind of like tranched or time locked. And so I was helping a lot there with writing the code to integrate with yearn and ideating on kind of what the value proposition of this stuff would be and why it's valuable to be able to separate your principal and interest tokens. And that was a really, really fun project to be a part of. And so I was there for about five months, and I think they're going to launch relatively soon, and I'm really excited to be able to take part in that launch and kind of see what happens there. But at the same time, I was also starting to dabble in nfts and I found NBA topshot.
00:19:33.966 - 00:19:36.002, Speaker C: I'm a huge basketball fan.
00:19:36.066 - 00:19:36.486, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:36.588 - 00:19:56.762, Speaker C: And so previously, before kind of COVID and everything, I was playing pretty intense NBA daily fantasy and had my own models for scoring and stuff. And I watched a lot of basketball. And so for me, it just totally clicked in my head and I was like, this is awesome. Nfts of basketball players. Let's go.
00:19:56.816 - 00:19:57.130, Speaker A: Wow.
00:19:57.200 - 00:20:13.680, Speaker C: And I aped in a little bit harder than I probably should have. I mean, it worked out, but in retrospect, it's like, oh, yeah, I put a lot of money into this thing, but it was one of those things where I loved what I was doing, and so I wasn't even really consciously doing.
00:20:14.530 - 00:21:04.766, Speaker A: And this is what we're going to be talking about for the rest of the episode, the nfTs, and how you're kind of involved in that space. But I wrote like a few months ago, we interviewed Andre and Trevor. We did this episode about NFTs music and media kind of. And after that, I wrote a piece where it's like, I can't imagine myself buying one of these things. But part of the reasons this is what I kind of the conclusion I came to is like, the reason is the content, the underlying content isn't something that I'm in love with yet, but there are things I am in love with, like types of media I really love. Now, if you combine that with nfTs, and that's where the sort of mind experiment goes, where it's like, if you combine something you love with an NFT, would you then ape into it? And it sounds like they did the combination that you wanted right off the bat.
00:21:04.868 - 00:21:15.910, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And that's where it clicked with me. And so I had previously been following along with crypto punks, and I had considered buying a couple back in the summer and when they were less than one Eth per.
00:21:16.060 - 00:21:16.626, Speaker A: But you didn't.
00:21:16.658 - 00:22:02.226, Speaker C: Why would I do that? I didn't because I was like, why would I do that when I could yield farm with it with that same Ethereum? And obviously hindsight is 2020 there. I wish I had a couple more crypto punks than I do right now. But yeah. So Topshot, for me, like you were saying, it unlocked to me, like, okay, now I get this, because previously, why would I care about cryptokitties or crypto punks and all these different things? Sure, they have an interesting story, but they're not really like a narrative that fits what I'm interested in. And Topshot was the first thing that really did that. And so I spent a lot of my free time between September and November, December even, like, either browsing the Topshot marketplace, working on off market deals, or all these crazy things. I had written my own bunch of Google sheets that was doing analytics on all the moments and stuff got way too into the weeds, but it was just fun for me.
00:22:02.226 - 00:22:19.660, Speaker C: It didn't feel like I was making some super sharp investment that was going to do well financially. And at that point, it kind of at the same time made it really clear to me the value proposition of all NFTs. And at this point, now I do own crypto punks, and I bought more because I get it and they have a cool story.
00:22:20.430 - 00:22:26.682, Speaker A: Let's hear what happened to you with the NBA Topshot. So you said you went in too hard. Maybe.
00:22:26.816 - 00:23:17.546, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, so I had a couple of good connections with a couple of the larger NFT collectors and more like market maker style NFT people, and so they weren't really interested in basketball and I was. And so I felt that I had a bit of an edge where I could be like, hey, I want to buy a bunch of this player from you that you don't really know that much about or don't really care about. And so I was generally offering them an off ramp from Topshop because it was at that point, was very hard to withdraw. It still is now, but not as bad as it used to be. And so I would buy stuff at a discount to offer them an off ramp into Ethereum. And then back in January, a daily fantasy guy, now, like, writer, doing a lot of cool stuff named Jonathan Bales, put out a piece about how him and some of his friends bought a John Morant moment for $35,000.
00:23:17.546 - 00:23:39.010, Speaker C: And that kind of kicked off like a tidal wave. Wow. So there was a couple websites that would show you your account balance or, like, your general idea of how much your account was worth. And over the course of three weeks, my account went from being worth like $200,000, which was a little more than the amount I put in, but not very much to. I think at its peak, it was almost at 16 million.
00:23:39.080 - 00:23:39.570, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:23:39.640 - 00:23:42.100, Speaker C: It's gone down significantly from then.
00:23:42.630 - 00:24:00.120, Speaker A: Also, there was an article that came out about your experience with Topshot that Tarune actually shared with me. That was one of the things that I read about you before I met you. So you were kind of the poster child in a way. You were the example of, if you're lucky, girls and boys, here's what you can do.
00:24:00.830 - 00:24:38.754, Speaker C: Yeah, that is definitely the weirdest part of this simulation that we live in, for sure. But really, I think, honestly, what that actually comes down to and what I've been incredibly thankful for is the dumb luck of topshot going crazy. And me being one of the largest collectors has opened up a ton of doors for me, just of new friends and people that I've met who have been just so kind and really great to get to know and great to work with and people who. I'm excited. I feel like I've made lifelong friendships because of this. And one of the guys who bought the John Morant for 35,000, Peter Jennings. And so he is also a big daily fantasy guy, really successful.
00:24:38.754 - 00:24:57.610, Speaker C: And he reached out to myself and MBL, two six seven, who was the other guy in the article about his friend who worked for the Wall Street Journal who was looking to do a topshot article. And so we had a couple of calls with him, and then I had, like, a really weird hour long photo shoot with someone from the Wall Street Journal.
00:24:59.230 - 00:25:02.774, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you take a picture of a top shot star?
00:25:02.912 - 00:25:22.894, Speaker C: Well, so she brought a basketball. I don't own a basketball. And so we walked around Brooklyn for a while and took some pictures. And then it's funny. So that picture we ended up using is in the second bedroom of my apartment, which is a home office for myself and my girlfriend. And I didn't know we were going to take pictures inside. And I was like, oh, should I clean up the office? She was like, no, it's fine.
00:25:22.894 - 00:25:30.440, Speaker C: We probably won't use one of these. And then she's just like, crap on my desk and clothes on the floor. But that's crazy.
00:25:31.130 - 00:25:52.602, Speaker A: So what does it mean when you make this change over? You have gone from farming, I guess, to now you're on topshot. But is this your job? Is now this your job? Like, do you spend every day looking at these NFts and trading them? Or was it more like this was a side thing that kind of blew up?
00:25:52.736 - 00:26:13.090, Speaker C: I would say more so that, okay, there was a period of time where I was spending a lot of time per day on it, and kind of, I think crypto has taught this lesson many, many times, especially in the crypto space. If you feel like there's kind of an asymmetric risk reward ratio, the best thing you can do is just kind of dive in headfirst and see what happens and figure everything else out later.
00:26:13.160 - 00:26:13.582, Speaker A: Totally.
00:26:13.646 - 00:26:44.230, Speaker C: And I was lucky as well to have a couple of guys who were also pretty confident in the platform, who I considered smart and would talk to, and we would kind of talk about strategy, of what we're going to buy and sell together, who I think we all kind of were able to help convince each other that this was, like, a really good product. We all came from extremely different backgrounds. I was the only really crypto native one. One of them runs an education startup. The other one is a Wall street guy. And neither of those guys are really crypto savvy. One of them doesn't even really own crypto.
00:26:44.230 - 00:27:17.526, Speaker C: And so that, to me, kind of made me feel more confident in it because I was talking with guys who were all interested in buying these things. One, because they thought it would go up in price, but also because they were really excited about the platform and wanted to be a part of it and really enjoyed what they were doing. And so it made me just really confident. And so for a period of time, I was probably spending, like, a full time job, amount of hours just thinking about it and doing things but then at a certain point, I got to the point where it's like, okay, I've put enough money into this. I don't need to put any more money into this thing. If it goes well, I'm going to have money. If it doesn't, I'm going to lose this money.
00:27:17.526 - 00:27:21.574, Speaker C: And I'm at a point where I feel good about the risk reward ratio.
00:27:21.702 - 00:27:44.414, Speaker A: Fair enough. By the way, I just realized, I keep asking you, like, was this your job? And I'm sorry about that. It's such a dumb question to ask in this space. If somebody asked me that, it's like they're all my jobs, all the things are my jobs at some point, and it's also my life. I don't know, it's like there's a combination happening and a lot of it's just interest. You're following something that you're into.
00:27:44.532 - 00:28:07.174, Speaker C: Yeah, no, definitely. I think that it makes sense. That's another weird thing in crypto. I feel like people do have jobs and where they're paid hourly, but at the same time, it's such a constantly moving thing that is just always changing and always evolving. And so there's a lot of things you can do that can take up a lot of your time that aren't your job and that you can still find extremely interesting and are worth it.
00:28:07.212 - 00:28:32.862, Speaker A: Yeah. It sounds like you're somewhat like at peace with whatever happens in the top shot world. You've kind of explored it to the point where your interest has been fulfilled. You're just going to leave it there. But at the same time, the NFT market, you must know quite well how that's doing. What is happening in the NFT market right now. What are your thoughts on that?
00:28:32.916 - 00:28:51.846, Speaker C: That's one of the other funny things that have kind of come out of topshot is I now do a weekly live stream with some other topshot guys called club Topshot. That's like a very casual YouTube stream we had on Ja rule a few weeks ago. It was so weird, so fun. Yeah. Jaw rule got high with us on a live stream talking about, did you.
00:28:51.868 - 00:28:53.830, Speaker D: Ask him about fire Festival?
00:28:54.330 - 00:29:03.718, Speaker C: So he made one backhanded comment. Ja rule is an insanely large collector. He had some crazy stuff in his apartment or his house. Not an apartment. He's too rich to have an apartment.
00:29:03.894 - 00:29:04.666, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:04.848 - 00:29:19.514, Speaker C: But he had one card that he was showing us and he said that it was fire, but it felt like he knew what he was saying. And then he actually did talk a bit. He sold a firefest NFT. And he talked about it for a second. Yeah, it sold for like six figures.
00:29:19.562 - 00:29:21.246, Speaker A: I heard about these, but he was.
00:29:21.268 - 00:29:53.898, Speaker C: Saying, I think it was kind of like a closing a chapter in his life in a way. But I was shocked. He came off as I expected nothing from him. And he came off as the nicest dude who was extremely thoughtful about collecting. I was really, really taken aback, but he was like a really good hang. It was funny. But sorry to go back to your original question at this point with Topshot specifically, I'm not really putting more money into it.
00:29:53.898 - 00:30:09.914, Speaker C: That would be extremely irresponsible, I think, just based on my general situation in life. But I do still keep up with it pretty well. I still use the site. They have challenges. I'll go and complete them sometimes if I think it's a good risk reward. But yeah. So I definitely am keeping up with NFTs pretty consistently.
00:30:09.914 - 00:30:16.898, Speaker C: And at this point, I don't only own topshots. I have crypto punks and I used to have some hash masks. I think I sold all of them.
00:30:16.984 - 00:30:34.406, Speaker A: But do you believe that at this moment in the NFT lifecycle that it was overhyped and that it's on the way down, or do you feel like, I'm really curious what your thoughts are maybe of this moment. It's not like obviously in the future, we don't know.
00:30:34.428 - 00:31:19.734, Speaker C: But I think, and I've actually been thinking about this a bit, especially because of the NFT very quick rise and fall that happened, although, I mean, the crypto punks are still doing pretty good. They kind of just rise and rise, but kind of everything else has had a bit of a rise and fall. I think that we're going to continue to see bubbles of these things rise and pop faster and faster because of the Internet. I think the Internet is just going to keep accelerating these things because the time it takes to disseminate the information of what is this and why is it cool? Has gone from years to hours. And so I definitely think that it was overhyped. But overhyped is a hard word. I think that NFTs are amazing and game changers for a lot of different things.
00:31:19.734 - 00:31:48.218, Speaker C: So maybe overhyped isn't the right word, but maybe just overbought for the amount of participants in the market for the use case, almost. Yeah. And it reminds me a lot of thinking about either like the.com bubble or stuff built on Ethereum in 2017 where there's going to be some really cool stuff that stands the test of time and it going up and down a couple of hundred percent in the spring of 2021 is going to be irrelevant, but then there's going to be a lot of stuff that no one cares.
00:31:48.234 - 00:31:51.402, Speaker A: About after a few years. Totally.
00:31:51.466 - 00:31:52.126, Speaker C: Probably.
00:31:52.308 - 00:32:06.162, Speaker A: Speaking of things that will hopefully last the test of time, let's talk about your project. You have a project called Fractional. I'm curious about the origin story of this. How old is it? And let's talk about what it is.
00:32:06.296 - 00:32:36.650, Speaker C: Yeah. So naturally, a lot of my kind of initial thoughts about it came because of Topshot, which I think just makes sense because of my kind of introduction into really taking nfts very seriously. But a lot of my conversations with a few of the other larger collectors was, I want to buy this moment for $25,000. I think it's worth a million dollars. Is anyone actually going to spend a million dollars on it? What's the addressable market of people who have seven figures they want to spend on a basketball gift, which it seems like it's not. None.
00:32:36.730 - 00:32:38.160, Speaker A: It seems like there's someone.
00:32:39.330 - 00:33:34.714, Speaker C: And so then it just obviously reevaluate what that means to the larger numbers that got me. And a lot of people at the time were fractionally going in on topshot moments, but just not trustlessly. It was just a group of friends. Yeah, it was just a group of friends who were either agreeing to or giving one of their friends cash, and then they were buying it and just custodying it in one of the accounts, which works at small scale, but realistically, you have to have better solutions than that in the long term. And so at the time, this was, I guess, like early February. I basically just spent a weekend coding up kind of what it would look like to have a fractional vault of an NFT that would give out shares and then you would have a reserve price, and if someone were to meet that reserve price with Ethereum, you could buy out the shares. And so I kind of coded this up over a weekend, just no front end or anything, just some smart contract code.
00:33:34.714 - 00:33:49.670, Speaker C: And I actually reached out to Tarun because I knew that robot, I should say, had some involvement with NFTX. And so I just wanted to get his opinion because I didn't know Tarun crazy well at the time, but we had exchanged some dms and Twitter.
00:33:52.330 - 00:33:56.818, Speaker A: Funny, because you guys actually live in the same city, but you never cross paths.
00:33:56.994 - 00:33:58.840, Speaker C: No. You know, I don't know.
00:33:59.370 - 00:34:00.710, Speaker A: I mean, it is a big city.
00:34:00.780 - 00:34:03.986, Speaker E: I mean, now we have, now we have.
00:34:04.028 - 00:34:23.474, Speaker C: But hopefully many more times. But, yeah, so I just reached out to him. And I was like, hey, I have this idea kind of what I've been working on. I just like spent some time doing this. I'm curious what your thoughts are. And kind of just pretty quickly, I'd been wanting to do my own thing and I had thought about that before doing element even, and it kind of just felt like as good a time as ever to do that.
00:34:23.592 - 00:34:32.686, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's like a thing you have experienced, maybe even more than most. You've gone through this cycle fully.
00:34:32.798 - 00:35:38.454, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. I do think that fractionalization kind of does bring some interesting defi style stuff to NFts. And so I feel very fortunate that I think that I found myself in kind of a nice position where I have experience in both of these things to a level that not a ton of other people do just based on my circumstances. So, yeah, so really the focus of what we're trying to build at a super basic level is how can we make something that's really easy for someone to kind of lazily buy some percentage of a crypto punk or a LeBron James moment or all these different things. I think there's going to be a ton of different really awesome and really complex daos and things like Pleaser Dow, which has spun up to where it's not explicit fractionalization of an NFT and sharing the pieces, but you're going to have these dow groups that are coming in and buying stuff. But this is more focused on just the really basic lazy version of that. What does it mean to lock up an NFT and people can buy a bit of it and then maybe someone will buy out the entire thing? And so that's really been the focus.
00:35:38.572 - 00:36:17.198, Speaker A: Is that how it kind of works? So the fractionalization, I think, makes a lot of sense. I think anyone can understand that. You take some fixed thing and then you break it up into lots of mini parts and each part represents a minor ownership in that. Like a stake almost. But is the idea here that it would go across all the platforms like that it would work on the NBA topshot and on some of the Ethereum based nfTs? Or is this more like I'm just trying to picture? Is this like you already coded it in solidity, so I'm guessing it lives more in the ethereum world. Is it meant to be kind of a concept that's then expanded out to other ecosystems?
00:36:17.294 - 00:36:49.450, Speaker C: Yeah. So in the short term, obviously, I'm insanely bullish on Ethereum. I spent a lot of my time over the last four years building on Ethereum. And so to me that was just like the natural place to kind of start building this thing. I think in the long term it'll be really interesting to see how kind of the multi chain NFT world plays out. Because I do think that there's going to be a much larger retail and casual focus than Defi or a lot of the financial stuff. I've been trying to convince my friends for years to get into crypto.
00:36:49.450 - 00:37:24.298, Speaker C: It took me minutes to get them to buy a topshot moment. So that kind of stuff, it's just like to me, I think it lends itself to a less sophisticated, not in a bad way, but just a group who doesn't care as much about a lot of different things. So I don't want to totally count out something like a flow blockchain or some of these other chains that are coming up that are more NFT specific. But to me, I naturally just first going to place my bets on Ethereum and build on Ethereum. But I do think the idea of kind of being in a cross chain world with nfts in different places is definitely possible. At least right now it's happening. Whether or not that plays out long term, I don't know.
00:37:24.298 - 00:37:30.140, Speaker C: But I wouldn't be shocked to see fractional living on multiple chains at some point in the future.
00:37:30.750 - 00:37:39.040, Speaker A: It's not a protocol though, is it? Is it a product? I'm kind of curious. And what stage is it at too? Yeah, I'm throwing a few questions away.
00:37:40.130 - 00:38:30.122, Speaker C: I think the protocol versus product question is really interesting. I would argue that we are trying to make something that could be considered a protocol. I guess the question is, what do you consider a protocol? I don't really know. I don't know. I'm not sure I have a finite answer to what is a protocol versus a product, but I want to make something, and we are actively working to make something that doesn't have to live on our website, that anyone can come in and fractionalize anything and build on top of us and create products on top of the fractional smart contracts. So in that sense, I do think of it as a protocol for fractionalization as far as the smart contracts go. But at the same time, we're pretty interested in building a really nice front end and UI that is a great product for people who want to come in and buy a fraction of a crypto punk or something along those lines.
00:38:30.122 - 00:39:17.198, Speaker C: So it's kind of hard to say. And as far as how far along we are, we just finished up an audit end of last week or middle of last week or so, and everything went pretty good. So we're hoping that very soon, maybe by the time people are listening to this, people can test out our product on girly testnet and kind of get an idea of what that's going to look like. It's just all a fake crypto punks smart contract and you can mint yourself a punk and fractionalize it and then go to Sushiswap and sell the fractional shares or provide liquidity. And so hopefully, if that goes well, it won't be too long until we're able to have people fractionalizing on Mainnet. We don't have a specific launch date kind of keyed in right now, but we're definitely hoping that it's sooner rather than later.
00:39:17.364 - 00:39:18.080, Speaker B: Cool.
00:39:18.450 - 00:39:43.846, Speaker A: Is this using one of the ERC? I know that there was like ERC 721 and then there's these extensions, and I can't remember the number of the one that allows the NFT to have hats and accessories. Like the game example where you have the one NFT that is standalone, and then you can actually use another standard to connect other objects to it. Is it using that or is it completely separate from that?
00:39:43.948 - 00:40:13.354, Speaker C: So I'm not sure exactly which one you're talking about. I know there's ERC 1155, which was, I think, made by engine, and that's like what rarible uses for their nfts. And so that one allows for you to have an NFT with additions of more than one. So out of the gate, we are not going to be supporting, that will just be ERC 720 ones. But we're very much so extensible to be able to support that in the future, should we need to.
00:40:13.412 - 00:40:26.742, Speaker A: Yeah, it was ERc nine nine eight, but I think it's since been replaced by this maybe ERC 1155. Okay, I don't have that handy, but yeah, I guess anyone can correct us if we got that wrong.
00:40:26.796 - 00:40:31.650, Speaker C: Sadly, I haven't been able to memorize every single ERC yet related to nfts.
00:40:31.730 - 00:40:32.438, Speaker A: Fair enough.
00:40:32.524 - 00:40:35.094, Speaker D: Actually, I think something that might be.
00:40:35.132 - 00:41:09.950, Speaker E: Super useful is to maybe go through the mechanics of like, hey, I own an NFT and how I fractionalize it, how things work, because I think actually for an audience that includes a lot of developers, it might actually be good to walk through the mechanics of how these things are made, what they look like. And I would say, at least from my purview, it's definitely a protocol. There are smart contracts that are auctions and there's tokens involved that are made. I think maybe if we walk through the mechanics, it'll be a little bit clearer.
00:41:10.030 - 00:41:10.274, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:10.312 - 00:41:11.042, Speaker E: Does that make sense?
00:41:11.096 - 00:41:46.458, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'll go through kind of like the lifecycle of an NFT and what that would look like in the fractional protocol and what it does to the NFT. So say I came with a crypto punk and I wanted to fractionalize it. Well, one, you'd have to have a wrapped crypto punk because we accept ERC 721 tokens, not crypto punk tokens. But then at that point, you would create what we're calling a vault. And that vault cares about a couple of unique things, and then a couple of things it has you put in, but it's not very opinionated on them. So you're going to be creating an ERC 20 token, which represents the ownership of the NFT.
00:41:46.458 - 00:42:22.860, Speaker C: And so that ERC 20 token needs to have a total supply, a number of decimals, which actually we force you to have 18 decimals for the sake of everyone's well being. And then a name and a symbol. And so the protocol is not opinionated on those things. You can name it whatever you want. But then alongside that, some of the more important stuff is one, a reserve price, which is going to be kind of the initial price in Ethereum, to buy out that vault. And I'll get into how a buyout works in a little bit. And then alongside that, we also need an auction length, which again with the buyout, is going to be a part of that system.
00:42:22.860 - 00:43:05.750, Speaker C: And then lastly we have what we call a curator fee. And this is a fee that the NFT originator is able to set, which allows them to essentially take almost like an asset under management style fee from the vault that they create. And this can be set in a range. And the way that that fee is paid out is in the form of total supply inflation. So let's say you create a vault and it has 100 ownership shares. Then you set your fee to 5% annually. And then over the course of a year, the vault would eventually accrue up to 105 ownership shares, and those would be sent to the NFT originator.
00:43:05.750 - 00:44:01.482, Speaker C: And so what that allows for initially is in a market where maybe it's not very desirable to fractionalize an NFT because NFTs are kind of going parabolic. You are able to basically turn your NFT into something that is providing you some interest, essentially, and you can take some profit off of your NFT. And still earn some shares, but in the long term, what I think is really interesting there is it allows for artists that fractionalize things to kind of create a new revenue stream that isn't secondary market sales. It encourages diamond hands, as opposed to weak hands with their collectors. For example, if an artist has a bunch of collectors who really like the artwork and don't want to sell it, they're never going to have secondary sale profits. Whereas in this, if you have a bunch of collectors who really, like, all own 25% of the fractional shares of your piece, even if they never sell it, you're still going to be seeing revenue from that, which I think is really cool.
00:44:01.616 - 00:44:15.178, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, that's kind of one of the problems with nfts being sold to an owner who really loves it. They may just emotionally love it so much that they never resell it, and the artist doesn't get that sort of secondary market resale benefit.
00:44:15.274 - 00:44:30.194, Speaker C: Yeah. And so I think that's a really interesting dynamic that'll play out. I'm very curious to see what kind of curator fees are set and what the market kind of determines is a fair curator fee. But I think we'll just kind of need time to see what that looks like for this.
00:44:30.232 - 00:44:37.318, Speaker A: Are you thinking primarily like the top shot model where it's like art, that you're fractionalizing, or is the vision a lot broader than that?
00:44:37.404 - 00:45:48.506, Speaker C: Well, so I think in the short term, kind of the low hanging fruit of topshot and crypto punks and all that is definitely the current addressable market of fractionalization. But I do think that it's a lot wider reaching than that, kind of as we see real world assets come onto Ethereum, and you saw that with maker just recently they started onboarding their first real world asset. I think that what is able to be fractionalized is going to continue to expand beyond just artwork. I kind of, in general, my feelings on nfts is that we're in a really interesting kind of proving grounds right now, where people are going to be building out a lot of cool primitives and applications that can use nfts. And the artwork and everything that people are trading right now is just kind of like the testing tokens for all of the actual insanely valuable stuff that in my mind should be an NFT, or could be an NFT, like buildings and esports teams and all these crazy things. There's been a couple different kind of models around fractionalization. Some have been more like heavily dao focused and stuff like pleaserdao kind of is moving in that direction and then other ones that are not quite as much.
00:45:48.506 - 00:46:04.240, Speaker C: And so it's going to be really interesting to see kind of as this all plays out, what do these fractional tokens look like? Are they something that trades above what people consider the fair market value of the asset that's locked up and all these different things? It's going to be very interesting to see that all play out.
00:46:04.610 - 00:46:19.830, Speaker A: Are there previous defi models that influenced your thinking around this, or do you already see some strategies that could be influenced by some of that, excuse the term, degen activity that you engaged in earlier this summer, at some point last year?
00:46:19.900 - 00:46:20.950, Speaker D: Last summer?
00:46:22.090 - 00:47:17.350, Speaker C: Well, so I think one of the cool things that could really pop up from this would be kind of an interesting way to do lending and borrowing protocols with nfTs. There's currently a project called NFT Phi, which is basically like a peer to peer NFT lending marketplace. But I think turning an NFT into ERC 20 tokens allows for more like compound or aave style markets around them and stuff, which I think would be really interesting. And that would kind of create the ability for you to make more educated bets on nfts, whether that's like trying to go long on an NFT or short on it, which I think is really interesting and not quite as easy to do in something like NFT Phi, I think. Or at least it's a little bit more of a manual process because it's peer to peer, where you have to have someone agree to your terms and kind of lock into a more structured loan.
00:47:17.690 - 00:47:20.530, Speaker D: Yeah, and for some historical context.
00:47:20.610 - 00:47:39.182, Speaker E: So ave, before they came, Aave was Ethland, which was peer to peer and very similar to NFTFI. And it just could not get traction because it was impossible for people to figure out a price, what the interest rate was. And I think once they moved to the pooled model, of course they were able to grow much more quickly.
00:47:39.236 - 00:47:40.782, Speaker D: And I think that's in general probably.
00:47:40.836 - 00:48:18.490, Speaker E: The same thing for nfts. Although, of course, the notion of price discovery for nfts is difficult, but I think it's improved a lot when fractionalized. I guess one thing that maybe is interesting to think about those, let's say I own an NFT and I go and fractionalize it. If I sell more than 50% of the shares, then I basically have exceeded control of the reserve price. Right. So I lose the ability to have a right of first refusal. How do you foresee the dynamics changing there when people fractionalize nfts, but they keep a right of first refusal versus those that don't.
00:48:18.490 - 00:48:28.030, Speaker E: Because I imagine that's something that happened in topshot. That's something I haven't seen kind of in defi. You don't see there's no right of first refusal.
00:48:29.010 - 00:49:11.546, Speaker C: I don't really know what's going to happen there. I've talked to a couple of people who have been interested in fractionalizing stuff and have said I want to keep more than 50% to kind of make sure that I still have some say in whether or not this thing would sell. But I don't know. I think probably a part of it depends on what's being fractionalized and why it's being fractionalized. I think that maybe for some people, fractionalizing an NFT is just a different way to find exit liquidity from that NFT. And in that case, maybe they don't care and so they'll sell 90% of it because they don't want to own this NFT anymore. And it was easier to do a Dutch auction for the fractional tokens than it was to list it on openc and wait for someone to buy it.
00:49:11.546 - 00:49:51.942, Speaker C: But I definitely think that for people who are trying to build more unique and wider reaching projects on top of a fractionalized NFT or fractionalized basket of NFTs, I do think that that's going to be a point of contention for a while, is I have these grandiose ideas for I'm going to take this thing and I'm going to fractionalize it, and then people who own fractional tokens for it will be able to do x, y, and z because they own part of the ERC 20 tokens. And so it would suck if you build this whole thing out and have this whole grand idea, and then you sell 60% of it, and then it gets a buyout triggers a week later, and all of a sudden all your plans have now been ruined. So that'll be a very interesting dynamic.
00:49:52.086 - 00:49:54.890, Speaker D: Yeah, because things like opensea and rarible.
00:49:55.310 - 00:50:01.454, Speaker E: People can kind of make bids continuously, and people do just make a lot of annoying bids all the time.
00:50:01.492 - 00:50:01.742, Speaker C: Right?
00:50:01.796 - 00:50:40.370, Speaker E: There's like this weird ux thing that happens. So kind of curious how you foresee that impact. This idea that there's like an auction triggered is kind of funny compared to defi. So in Defi, an auction is a bad thing. It's like there's a liquidation, like the loan is going under, but here the auction is a good thing in the sense that it's supposed to be like liquidity event we're cashing out. And so somehow merging those two mental states I think is the key to these products that people haven't really figured out. But fractalization certainly seems like one of the necessary pieces.
00:50:40.450 - 00:51:14.306, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. And it also comes with some serious risks where if there is an auction where the buyout ends up going for significantly less than what the token was trading at, then everyone who was trading the token takes a haircut. And so there have to be token holders who are making sure they're keeping track of the reserve price or really in any fractional thing. I don't think token holders want to see the NFT sold for less than they bought the fractional shares for. But that's also just kind of a part of markets. That's the rough part of that.
00:51:14.488 - 00:51:33.478, Speaker A: I want to talk about pleaserdao and how this relates to all of this. So it's a different project, right. It's not closely related to fractional and yet is there a connection point? Is there something of commonality between these two projects?
00:51:33.654 - 00:51:36.058, Speaker D: Maybe we should give the history of pleaser down.
00:51:36.144 - 00:51:36.922, Speaker A: Please do.
00:51:37.056 - 00:52:19.994, Speaker E: So basically, people pleaser, who is a good friend of both of ours, in various, like in summer she did this amazing set of illustrations for Sushiswap's launch and for Ave's launch. And Mateo at Uniswap messaged me and was like, hey, can I get an introduction to people, please? So I introduced him sometime in summer. And then I just didn't hear anything about it for a while because was I like, okay, maybe it didn't work out. But then in April, sometime maybe March, late March, uniswap b three kind of has this launch announcement and as a teaser they put out this video that she made.
00:52:20.112 - 00:52:24.970, Speaker A: And she's an artist, I guess she's an animator. Visual artist.
00:52:25.390 - 00:52:27.978, Speaker E: Yeah, she used to work on game designing. Game.
00:52:28.064 - 00:52:28.842, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:52:28.976 - 00:52:38.058, Speaker E: Then she's been kind of a freelance defi graphic designer. She's done every defi protocol, done some piece for literally every protocol.
00:52:38.154 - 00:52:38.798, Speaker C: Cool.
00:52:38.964 - 00:53:14.620, Speaker E: Probably the most in demand defi artist that exists. Like every project has been trying to commission pieces and she's one person, so obviously that's hard to do. And so this piece was pretty epic because it kind of marked kind of this big change for uniswap. And then I think around that time there was a lot of violence towards Asian Americans. And so she decided to put sell an MFT of the piece with all the proceeds donated to asian american violence nonprofits. Well, antiviolence. Sorry, I guess that sounded like.
00:53:14.620 - 00:53:36.930, Speaker E: But you got one. And so then basically, I think it was at auction, and the price started going. You know, I think Andy and I both have different stories of how we got involved in this, but I was at a restaurant a little bit inebriated, and I just got this message of, like, send ten e here before this amount of time.
00:53:37.080 - 00:53:40.126, Speaker D: And I was like, well, who knows.
00:53:40.158 - 00:53:43.006, Speaker E: What this is, but sure, let's roll the dice.
00:53:43.118 - 00:53:47.110, Speaker A: From anyone? Was it from an anonymous account on telegram?
00:53:47.770 - 00:53:49.990, Speaker E: No, from someone who I won't dox.
00:53:51.050 - 00:53:54.214, Speaker A: Someone you knew and trusted, I guess.
00:53:54.412 - 00:53:58.738, Speaker E: And they were like, yeah, we want to buy the piece. We're going to pull together some funds.
00:53:58.834 - 00:54:17.326, Speaker D: And I was like, sure. This is basically, like, the problem that Andy is talking about, about pulling together money to buy one piece. This is kind of that, and get added to some telegram group, and all of a sudden it's like, hey, we won this $500,000 piece, which was, I think, foundation's biggest sale at that time for them.
00:54:17.428 - 00:54:23.530, Speaker A: So, wait, were you pooling together to buy the people pleaser image nft?
00:54:23.610 - 00:54:27.586, Speaker D: Yeah, the uniswap nft that she was.
00:54:27.608 - 00:54:33.780, Speaker A: Selling to raise money. Okay. So there was basically a collection of people who got together in order to buy.
00:54:36.630 - 00:54:37.474, Speaker E: The group.
00:54:37.592 - 00:54:45.766, Speaker D: And then people pleaser, I think the group gave her some fraction of the token. So they tokenized, basically made a token for voting on what pieces to buy.
00:54:45.868 - 00:54:46.566, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:46.748 - 00:54:53.194, Speaker D: Mariano from maker was kindly our governance czar and set everything up.
00:54:53.232 - 00:54:53.818, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:53.984 - 00:55:19.918, Speaker D: And then I think there was this crazy excitement and tons of people who are like, I want to join, I want to join. I'll add money, whatever. And so we're like, well, the goal of this thing was have, like, a sort of social mission and to buy paintings that have a social component and also represent sort of the values that people pleasers art does. I think of these things as, like, community owned art museums.
00:55:19.934 - 00:55:20.114, Speaker C: Right?
00:55:20.152 - 00:55:25.010, Speaker D: Like, you're never going to own a share of the Met, but at least here you can kind of own a share of these things.
00:55:25.160 - 00:55:32.566, Speaker A: And the way you're doing this is through Dao. So you're basically just using, like, a Dao infrastructure, kind of. I don't know which one is it?
00:55:32.668 - 00:55:35.794, Speaker D: We're using compound unisoft governance contracts.
00:55:35.922 - 00:55:36.502, Speaker A: Okay.
00:55:36.636 - 00:55:37.462, Speaker D: Pretty simple.
00:55:37.596 - 00:55:44.150, Speaker A: So you have this Dao, and you're pooling money in order to buy nfts, and in a way, you're fractionalizing the nfts.
00:55:44.310 - 00:56:09.458, Speaker D: Yes. And then somehow there's this decision on the Snowden piece, that the Snowden piece was the thing we had to buy and we had to raise money for that. And so somehow we added new members. That part I won't really get into any details on, but new members were added, capital came in and we had this crazy bidding war with this anonymous person. And then the piece ended up going to pleaserdraft for 5.5 million.
00:56:09.624 - 00:56:10.434, Speaker A: Wow.
00:56:10.632 - 00:56:11.138, Speaker D: Dollars.
00:56:11.224 - 00:56:15.026, Speaker A: And now you own it. So are you waiting to eventually sell it?
00:56:15.128 - 00:56:20.758, Speaker D: So Andy can now tell you where the true long term goals go.
00:56:20.924 - 00:56:21.398, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:21.484 - 00:56:33.238, Speaker C: Yeah. So I don't think we've had an official snapshot vote or anything to ratify doing this, but generally the plan is to fractionalize the piece on fractional.
00:56:33.334 - 00:56:33.930, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:56:34.080 - 00:57:16.840, Speaker C: What exactly we're going to do from there also has not totally been decided. I would say it's a very free form group right now. We're still figuring a lot out, but that is the general plan. And I think the idea is that we could potentially then maintain ownership of the piece to some extent and kind of, I think it's fitting for a snout and piece something to give it to the people and then also hopefully raise some capital through that to be able to figure out what's next and go from there. But again, it's all like, if none of that happened, if we did something totally different with the fractional tokens, I wouldn't be shocked. But as of right now, it's the general idea.
00:57:17.290 - 00:57:26.374, Speaker A: The pleaser Dow sounds like it just was created by a community spontaneously. But is everyone cool with using it with fractional?
00:57:26.422 - 00:57:31.910, Speaker D: Or is it like, that's why there's governance votes. The NFT can only be moved by governance.
00:57:31.990 - 00:57:32.378, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:32.464 - 00:57:34.474, Speaker D: The governance contract owns the NFT.
00:57:34.602 - 00:57:35.680, Speaker A: This is an amazing.
00:57:36.290 - 00:57:37.518, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:57:37.604 - 00:57:39.214, Speaker C: It's a lot of fun. It's really cool.
00:57:39.252 - 00:57:57.220, Speaker A: I know it's like the launching of your project through this experiment sounds given like the story we've heard also of your background. This is so fitting and so awesome. It's like learning in the moment as this thing is moving a million miles an hour and all these people want to throw money in.
00:57:59.290 - 00:58:13.660, Speaker C: I just, I pulled up my first twitter DM from this. I won't say from who, it was just me and three other people. Just, yo, let's get this NFT. Someone suggested Penny beach and that was it. And then all of that turned into a telegram group and way more people.
00:58:14.270 - 00:58:18.438, Speaker A: Amazing. Is people pleaser involved in the Dow?
00:58:18.534 - 00:58:24.190, Speaker D: Yeah, she is now after the piece was purchased, she is a partial owner.
00:58:24.530 - 00:58:39.762, Speaker A: Amazing. So maybe to wrap up the interview. What are you seeing kind of coming down the pipeline for nfts? Obviously, fractionalization is one of these things, but what else do you think you're looking forward to? Maybe in the space?
00:58:39.896 - 00:59:42.902, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm very curious to see what happens with the Christie's crypto punk auction that should be happening pretty soon. I think that's going to be really interesting and there's a chance that it just totally rerates crypto punks, and so I'm looking forward to that and kind of seeing what happens there. I think there's also a good chance that that could be the local top of crypto punks for a little bit, which wouldn't be shocking considering how the beeple stuff went and all that. But I think in the long term, I'm really interested in fractionalization and all the different things that can come with NFTs in creating these really interesting, sometimes gamified, sometimes just cool money Legos. Just building out the ecosystem around them from just buying and collecting is awesome and really cool. But there's just so much more that's capable of being done. And I think that these last couple of months have hopefully injected enough money and excitement into the space that over the next year or so, we're just going to see some really cool, crazy, interesting projects that are going to come out.
00:59:42.902 - 01:00:06.778, Speaker C: And I think that as people continue to build, that's what I'm most excited for, is just other smart people who are building stuff and creating other interesting NFT legos. In the same way that for a while DeFi was just a few interesting protocols that were doing stuff and now we have this crazy ecosystem with so much going on, I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that people haven't even considered with nfTs.
01:00:06.874 - 01:01:04.302, Speaker D: I would add one of the things I find most miraculous about this story, plus, in general, kind of the way the analogs to the last cycle, like 2017, that I would make for nfts is like during the last cycle there was obviously a lot of froth and fake stuff that doesn't work or make sense, like fractionalizing farms in India and selling them on the blockchain or something. Like, I remember seeing things like that. But amidst all of kind of like in every good lie is a kernel of truth. And so I tend to think in every good kind of hype cycle there's always a kernel of truth infrastructure wise. And last time it was defi stuff. Like the core tenets of Defi people were raised Ave Ico'd for Etheland Bancor ico'd, they may not have been the main winners. I mean, in case, you know, obviously they made it into the successful ICO wasn't a scam, really provided use value to users Bancor.
01:01:04.302 - 01:01:43.502, Speaker D: Maybe halfway there, I would say. But the idea is there's all this infrastructure that comes from the hype cycle and getting all these people into it, into kind of these kind of last minute things. And I think NFT infrastructure in general to make it more useful and accessible and almost like interoperable in a weird way, in the sense that somehow I want my top shot nfts to interact with my crypto punks, but we don't know exactly how that's going to happen. I think that's going to be the cool stuff to see. And I think fractionalization is one of those core primitives that has to exist first.
01:01:43.636 - 01:01:59.810, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. I feel a lot of similarities from 2017 e icos and stuff to nfts now, which has a lot of good and bad connotations to it. But I'm very excited about what the next couple of years are going to hold.
01:01:59.960 - 01:02:15.378, Speaker D: So I think Defi and NFTs are going to intersect a lot more over the next couple of years, kind of as we're talking about the future. Where do you see that going? And what are kind of the grape leaves, tea leaves, whatever the leaves that are predictive.
01:02:15.554 - 01:03:19.402, Speaker C: I do love stuffed grape leaves, but I think the thing that, to me, is just like an obvious use case for fractionalization outside of the crypto collectibles and art world and into the DFI world, is the upcoming uniswap v. Three liquidity tokens, or LP tokens. So for those who aren't aware in Uniswap v three, because they have ranged liquidity as opposed to just generic liquidity, they have to identify each user's lp position as an NFT as opposed to an ERC 20 token. And so that's going to open up some really interesting things, but it's also going to break a lot of things. For example, uniswap V two liquidity pool positions are able to be used in Makerdao as collateral to borrow against V three. That won't really be possible, at least right now, maker doesn't support nfts. So to me, fractionalizing those things kind of immediately helps to solve that problem and address one of those pain points.
01:03:19.402 - 01:03:52.706, Speaker C: And I wouldn't be surprised if in the long term, kind of as DFI continues to evolve and explore nfts more, and these worlds continue to merge, we're going to see more and more nfts that represent positions in DeFi or different things that we hold or do in DeFi. I mean, Uniswap has generally been a trendsetter for a long time, and them doing this to me means probably other people will do it as well. And so I'm very interested and excited to see kind of what that whole Defi fractionalized lp positions and whatever else comes from that holds.
01:03:52.818 - 01:04:03.638, Speaker A: Cool. So thank you so much, Andy, for coming on the show and sharing all of this with us. What an amazing journey and also very exciting stuff in the pipeline, it sounds like.
01:04:03.724 - 01:04:09.998, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you very much for having me. This is a lot of fun. It's always fun to talk about Defi and crypto. I could do it all day, of course.
01:04:10.044 - 01:04:14.698, Speaker A: Us. Same here. Tarun, thanks again for joining as the co host.
01:04:14.794 - 01:04:16.062, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
01:04:16.196 - 01:04:24.010, Speaker A: And I want to say a big thank you to Andre, the podcast producer, Henrik, the podcast editor, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.
