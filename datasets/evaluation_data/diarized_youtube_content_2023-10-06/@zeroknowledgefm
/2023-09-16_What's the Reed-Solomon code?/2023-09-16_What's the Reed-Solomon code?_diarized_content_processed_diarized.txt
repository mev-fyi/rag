00:00:00.730 - 00:00:03.418, Speaker A: The probably more common encoding in Zk.
00:00:03.514 - 00:00:04.218, Speaker B: Is the reit.
00:00:04.234 - 00:00:05.038, Speaker A: Solomon code.
00:00:05.124 - 00:00:06.686, Speaker B: What it is is it says if.
00:00:06.708 - 00:00:07.678, Speaker A: There'S anything you get out of a.
00:00:07.684 - 00:00:11.790, Speaker B: Stock is forget all of the linear algebra. What we're going to do is we're going to say x.
00:00:11.860 - 00:00:21.486, Speaker A: Is the coefficients of a polynomial of degree n minus one g of x means you're going to encode that polynomial or encode that message into a polynomial, and Gx of.
00:00:21.508 - 00:00:22.346, Speaker B: R says, evaluate.
00:00:22.378 - 00:00:24.318, Speaker A: That polynomial at a point R.
00:00:24.484 - 00:00:26.246, Speaker B: That's it. So this is.
00:00:26.268 - 00:00:26.902, Speaker A: The one.
00:00:27.036 - 00:00:27.766, Speaker B: If you ever get.
00:00:27.788 - 00:00:28.326, Speaker A: Lost in the.
00:00:28.348 - 00:00:29.206, Speaker B: Sauce, I.
00:00:29.228 - 00:00:36.660, Speaker A: Would recommend just go back to this quant definition, and this will kind of set you back on the right track. Close.
