00:00:00.330 - 00:00:37.220, Speaker A: Let me give you a very short recap how positron actually works. So it's essentially a cryptographic permutation. You can see the design on the right side here. And in the beginning we have these, we call them full rounds because we apply the s boxes or the nonlinear functions to the whole state. Then we have some partial rounds, and then we again have these full rounds and these monomial functions for the s boxes. And the thing, the important thing is that every matrix, so every m, this is a matrix multiplication, is actually an MDS matrix and all these things. So the primutation then gets used in a classical sponge mode to, for example, build a general purpose hash function, or even encryption, if you want.
