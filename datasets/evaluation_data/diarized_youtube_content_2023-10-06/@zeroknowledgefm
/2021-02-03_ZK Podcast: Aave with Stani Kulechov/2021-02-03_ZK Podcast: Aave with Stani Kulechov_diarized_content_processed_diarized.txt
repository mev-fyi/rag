00:00:05.530 - 00:00:50.182, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. You this week, guest host Turin Shitro and I chat with Stani from Ave. We talk about the early days of DFI, the introduction of collateralized loans and stablecoins, flash loans, flash minting, and Ave's new credit delegation function. We also touch on the effects of gas l two s and where the space might be headed. But first, I want to say thank you to this week's sponsor, Hermes.
00:00:50.182 - 00:01:45.562, Speaker A: Hermes is an l two solution that scales token transfers on top of Ethereum, which can handle up to 2000 transactions per second. Designed for high frequency tokens, Hermes is a ZK rollup, a topic we often cover on the show, including this one, and a project which leverages ZK snarks for validity proofs with onchain data availability. These zero knowledge circuits are developed using Iden Three's circuit compiler language circom. The system also brings a novel consensus algorithm called proof of donation that gives 40% of each transaction fee back to the Ethereum community as a donation, which supports Ethereum development. Now, after passing two security audits, Hermes is running a bug bounty program. They're offering up to 100 eth to whoever discovers any critical vulnerabilities. If you want to hear more about the project, I recently had Jordy Bilina, technical lead at Hermes on the show for an interview.
00:01:45.562 - 00:02:11.506, Speaker A: I've added the link in the show notes and if you want to find out more about Hermes and the bug Bounty program, head over to Hermes IO. I've also added the link there. So thank you so much Hermes, for sponsoring. Now here is our conversation with Stani from Ave. So today I'm chatting with Stani from Ave and guest host Tarun. Hi Tarun.
00:02:11.698 - 00:02:14.422, Speaker B: Hey, happy to be back and welcome.
00:02:14.476 - 00:02:15.810, Speaker A: To the show, Stani.
00:02:15.970 - 00:02:18.230, Speaker C: Thanks Anna and Tarun for having me here.
00:02:18.380 - 00:02:36.640, Speaker A: So Stani, you're from the project Ave. I want to hear, and I know you've probably said this every time you've been on a podcast, but I think our audience actually doesn't know that much about the Ave project. Can you give us a very short timeline of what it was and what it is today?
00:02:38.130 - 00:03:17.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the projects itself was named Ava a couple of years ago. So before that we were used to called Ethland, which is short for Ethereum lending. And Ethland was a project that we started to actually build in already 2016, very kind of slowly. So I was still studying in university in Helsinki, Finland, where I'm originally from, and I was actually studying law. So I have a background in software development. So I used to develop financial technology. So practically more of front end user experiences.
00:03:17.670 - 00:04:43.960, Speaker C: And that was kind of like my first startup experiences. And always with fintech, you end up meeting regulation quite a lot. And somehow I got excited about law because I didn't understand well all of these rules, why there's so many rules when you want to do some innovation and you want to help people and you see a lot of potential. And I started to read more and more, and then I went to study law. And at some point at the end of law school, I got interested in contracts, contract law, and kind of like how to make contracts more efficient, automated, and also somehow the whole legal industry, something that's actually modern, we still have a legal industry that is a bit lot of paper based and feels quite old fashioned, at least to me. When I was studying and I started to read about a lot of things, AI contracts in general, digitalization. And one of the things I stumbled upon was practically smart contracts and started to dig deeper and understood that there's practically a concept where you can publish code into a distributed ledger, a blockchain ledger, and practically, it's very difficult to manipulate that data.
00:04:43.960 - 00:05:39.974, Speaker C: You can put data that is very hard to manipulate. And one of the places where you could do that, actually the only one I was widely used, well, widely, it was still early, was Ethereum. And that kind of got me excited that actually we can do contracts and codify things in a way that they execute by themselves. So you kind of don't need to go later into court and prove things. Of course, this is the black and white thing. And then I wanted to just try what we could create and somehow went back, we started to build financial applications because I already did that. So we created basically first proof of concept of ETH lend, which is practically on chain peer to peer lending protocol.
00:05:39.974 - 00:05:40.794, Speaker C: Back then.
00:05:40.912 - 00:05:59.546, Speaker A: Was Eth lend a hackathon project or was it a team? How did that come about? And by the way, your story of coming from law to blockchain is cool. I don't know that we've had. And the fact that you also had that technical background, it's just neat. It's like kind of a unique perspective.
00:05:59.658 - 00:06:36.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's quite different. And that's what makes the space interesting, because it really doesn't matter that much, the background itself. So to contribute in, say, decentralized finance or any kind of like on chain system, you don't need to be, let's say, developer. It's so kind of more wider than that, so there's different areas you can contribute. And that's pretty interesting. But I would say it was a hackathon project in the sense that we were doing something that was very challenging for us and we didn't have the skills. We failed a lot of times.
00:06:36.106 - 00:07:17.282, Speaker C: It was frustrating at some points, and at some points we were like quitting that this is just too hard. It's really difficult. But at some point we realized a bit that practically we can actually do this. And it was as early as 2017, January when we actually released a Covan version of the Ethlin protocol and was very simple. I mean, you practically had only very basic functions. You could do loans between two peers. It's not the same that we see in Defi with the pool systems that we see today, pooled capital.
00:07:17.282 - 00:07:39.790, Speaker C: But it was something back then, and this was when we practically had only one decentralized exchange, ether delta. And a bit later that year, for example, Kyber came, so liquidity started to pile up a bit. Ecosystem was very small then. So what we did then, it wasn't beautiful at all. So I would say that it was a hackathon in mindset.
00:07:40.770 - 00:07:41.230, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:41.300 - 00:07:45.600, Speaker C: But we actually tried to make something that people would use.
00:07:47.650 - 00:07:52.814, Speaker A: Who are your co founders, by the way? Because you say we, so I'm guessing you didn't do this alone.
00:07:52.942 - 00:08:41.842, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. Funny thing about the whole project, it started that I started to build a bit. And we had another kind of person back then, his name was Anton, and he was already building stuff like very small blockchain related things. He tried to build some sort of way to ensure market prices very early. Also, I practically went to Reddit with my idea and also actually went to Facebook. And there was this Ethereum group back then that started to grow, mainly of people who actually are kind of like more interested in going long on Ethereum. But in Reddit and in Facebook practically, I was voicing out that I would like to create this kind of a project and see how it goes.
00:08:41.842 - 00:09:09.846, Speaker C: And if there's someone who wants to join, there's different tasks that you could do will be pretty awesome. And then people started to come. Jordan, for example, he's our CEO. He was one of the first. He was, I think I made the post roughly month after the COVID release or something like that. So it was very early. And yeah, that's how the team formed.
00:09:09.846 - 00:10:15.630, Speaker C: And funny part about Reddit was that when I posted about this idea, there was so many kind of like comments against that. Why would you even put assets as a collateral? So the way that this over collateralized lending works is that as a borrower, you put a deposit collateral, and against your deposit you can borrow something else. So actually there was like a lot of resistance and kind of vocaling about why would you actually put anything as a collateral and borrow when you can actually sell the asset? And this was in the Ethereum subreddit, so I kind of understand that. Wow. In terms of understanding of economics, definitely there's still big gaps and ways to go. And today probably whole ecosystem is based in a way that there's some sort of a collateral, collateral for borrowing collateral, let's say, to provide liquidity, leading funds there. So, yeah, definitely now it's a different story.
00:10:15.630 - 00:10:19.106, Speaker C: I mean, there's a lot of information about it, very common. Yeah.
00:10:19.208 - 00:10:59.150, Speaker B: You know, what's kind of interesting about your point about how the Ethereum Reddit community would be very against collateralized lending is that I think that bitcoin had the same evolution where in early bitcoin, people were very against bitcoin lending in general, and then miners, they were unable to kind of manage their treasury. And suddenly you started seeing bitcoin lending, and the miners always drive the financial innovation, I find, before it kind of reaches, goes up the stack to the user. And so I bet you around that time that Ethereum miners would have been like, this is amazing. But Ethereum Reddit users are usually not miners.
00:11:01.010 - 00:12:06.610, Speaker C: Yeah. And also it's more of like a professional user group. So they have the need, I think kind of like Reddit, also the user group, there was more of a retail. So today, if you talk about, let's say, defi, it's very much understood what's going on because the ecosystem has grown substantially. But then it was starting to grow and it was like weird times. 2016 17, a bit of 18, and then 90 was a bit easier, I think when maker system and makers, practically the stablecoin dies, started to pick up and there was more kind of like things being built on top of that. When ecosystem started to grow, it became more kind of like cooler, because then you will not need always to explain everything from scratch.
00:12:07.050 - 00:12:36.462, Speaker A: I was actually about to ask you if Makerdao, because for me at least, Makerdao and the Dai minting was like the first time I understood this idea of collateral in crypto that would actually create something else for me at least that was the educating point. That was the project that got me on board, I guess. And that process was happening, I believe, throughout 2018. Yeah, I think 2017, that wasn't really.
00:12:36.516 - 00:13:22.558, Speaker C: Like a known concept, actually. I quite remember because back in then, our lending model didn't have any stable coins. The only stable coin practically was tether, which was an omnichain, and how we solved the stability. So obviously, you want also to borrow stable currency is that we pegged the eater. So practically you put a loan request and you lend out, let's say, 100 usd worth of eater, and then you borrow 100 usd worth of eater and return, let's say, after six months, 100 usd worth of eater. That works pretty well. But kind of the issue is kind of like the accounting side of it.
00:13:22.558 - 00:14:09.718, Speaker C: It's way easier to just hold die that doesn't fluctuate, and then practically borrow one USD, let's say, worth of ether, because you practically need to convert it to fiat or purchase whatever you need to purchase. Maker solves a lot of interesting issues, and we try to kind of build upon it. And I think for me, the coolest realization of the whole deFi space is that it started when we started to see a lot of projects coming in, building different things, and you started to actually understand and look at their ideas and started to build on top of those ideas and kind of like rehyberating those kind of initiatives.
00:14:09.894 - 00:14:17.142, Speaker A: I'm trying to understand what ETH lend was before Dai, actually, was it just this ETh collateral to Eth?
00:14:17.286 - 00:14:18.606, Speaker C: Yeah, so it seems like such a.
00:14:18.628 - 00:14:20.558, Speaker A: Weird, like, what would you use that for?
00:14:20.644 - 00:15:11.786, Speaker C: Yeah, because you could kind of borrow USD peg. But our goal was actually that they use tokens as a collateral and then borrow it. And the funny part is that ERC 20s weren't that big thing yet. So 2016, beginning of 2017, practically the market capitalizations were quite small. And one of the things what was interesting that the liquidity started to grow as we saw Kyber coming in, and also Dex liquidity increase is that kind of like, you don't need to separate any more risks, that you can actually pull things together. And in Eastland, we always thought about it, that let the kind of counterparties handle their own risk. So let's say let the lender fund collaterals, loans with collaterals that are comfortable.
00:15:11.786 - 00:15:30.626, Speaker C: And we didn't want to put pools together. And today it's very obvious that actually, I think Tara knows pretty well that you can do a lot of magic when you actually kind of have compositions and pooling and there is many elements involved.
00:15:30.818 - 00:16:18.738, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, actually, you've talked about kind of the early days, but one kind of question is how were you able to kind of start with sort of a coin offering in 2017 and survive through the lean times of 2018, especially in 2018, when I think, at least from the investors standpoint, investors were really interested in other layer ones or basically anything on this podcast that has been featured was funded in 2018 instead of Ethereum based finance. And so you survived through that period and then launched. So maybe walk us through how you did that and what it was like kind of going through the downturn and then somehow kind of having this miraculous exponential growth after 2018.
00:16:18.834 - 00:16:20.600, Speaker C: Those were really dark days.
00:16:21.290 - 00:16:23.590, Speaker A: Dark days of 2018.
00:16:24.330 - 00:17:30.650, Speaker C: I felt personally kind of like being in a ship where everyone is just jumping out and you started to become more lonely in the space because many projects, nothing happened. And somehow when the bear market start to happen, and it was very steep, many of the ideas didn't have a lot of merits. And we actually had already a product back in 2017 and before the funding, but kind of like we understood that the product isn't good enough, that we have to continue building things and still keep up. And during actually that 2018 and even 2017. One particular point I want to highlight is that many of things that was happening on Ethereum, for example, usually projects choose a kind of like a horizontal approach, in the sense that they wanted to create a protocol that other protocols will then consume. And the other protocol that was building want to create a protocol that other protocols were consuming. And you had this kind of like layers of verticality.
00:17:30.650 - 00:18:41.422, Speaker C: And then there was questions about adoption, and there's so many step in user experience and so forth. So no one wanted to go to actually the end user, kind of like end to end from the protocol all the way to end user. And for us, it was always from the beginning kind of like point that we want to just try to do something that actually the users will use and kind of focus on the end user. And this is kind of relates, even today, that we focus quite a lot on the user experience. So we try to always keep that relationship to the end user and not only build on a protocol scale. And during 2018, I definitely noticed that it was kind of like you were building things, but you're building in a silo a bit, so there wasn't any distractions and so forth, which was good, because probably we focus in 2018 and actually even 2019 quite a lot on just brainstorming ideas and trying to figure out ways to build things implementation. So we spent a lot of time on those, and actually that's very healthy.
00:18:41.422 - 00:19:22.778, Speaker C: So in one way, the market wasn't healthy, but the way we developed and we had time to think things, that was super healthy. And I think that's the way that protocols should be built. So you should not have this kind of like a pressure of getting things quickly on the market because some other protocol made this feature, and everyone loves that, and you have to come something else, but everyone loves you again and kind of have this attention competition all the time. And even though we felt bad because of the market and everything, but we felt good that we could actually just build things without much of distraction.
00:19:22.874 - 00:19:35.380, Speaker A: In a way, the price was so much in the toilet that I guess everyone had already given up and just left you alone. I don't know how your token went exactly, but I just know it went down. There was almost this.
00:19:35.930 - 00:19:37.910, Speaker C: It was harsh.
00:19:38.330 - 00:20:02.734, Speaker B: Although the trough to current level is kind of one of the craziest things, I think, that has ever happened in the history of cryptocurrency. The recovery of Ave is kind of honestly just insane. You need to plot it on a log chart and just look at how many orders of magnitude it jumped. It's actually amazing to see the ICO price is actually a tiny blip relative to the current.
00:20:02.852 - 00:21:02.590, Speaker C: And even post ICo it went so down, and you have a lot of kind of community members that are also living on the prices and so forth. So that's kind of like you feel the pressure, and it's actually enormous pressure that what protocol builders have, it's not just pressure from the community, but pressure to succeed and pressure of security, pressure of. It's a hard business, but end of the day, we're building some stuff that is in some extent, very groundbreaking. And I've realized that maybe recently, for us, it's always about innovation, but now that there is, like, DeFi became an epicenter in crypto, I kind of understood that we actually have what we're building. The whole ecosystem here is going to be something very significant. I mean, if people will start to use more DeFi and the networks will clog.
00:21:04.370 - 00:21:36.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk about that later on, actually. But first, I think one of the topics that we wanted to cover in this episode with you is that of Flash loans. Now, Flash loans is something that we've actually mentioned. I think, Tarun, you were in that episode. It was in beginning of 2020 at the Stanford Blockchain conference, where we actually just talked about it off the cuff. We gave a quick definition, but Flash loans is, as I understand it, an invention or like one of the features, one of the, I don't know what you call it, but concepts that Ave pioneered.
00:21:36.374 - 00:22:43.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Ave didn't kind of pioneer it because in terms of flash loans, we have seen implementations beforehand and kind of like what Ava did very well is that we made it pop culture practically when we launched. Flash loan was actually like one of the latest features we added. We talked about it like how cool would be this and that, what kind of things you could do? And actually we were even thinking that it never was actually a feature. But then at some point, I don't know, was it like we had time in development or something? We practically added the flashlon function. And in the beginning we didn't see that much of usage in January. And I actually took it. I took kind of a big initiative to actually campaign that, hey, we have these flash loans and hackathons, and also very vocally being in the community and trying to get people to build things because there's so many use cases that you could do besides hacks or so called arbitrage.
00:22:43.310 - 00:23:10.570, Speaker C: At some point we started to see interesting things to be built. So first projects, and then came the big hacks with flash loans. Then of course that was more pr, and at some point we realized that, wow, we already have like a half a billion flash loans, and the whole year was 2 billion worth of flash loans in the whole year from August. So it's a neat functionality.
00:23:11.470 - 00:24:03.558, Speaker A: I think our audience probably knows what a flash loan is, but I do think it might not hurt to just quickly say just for our audience, flash loans are a tool that lets developers borrow instantly without collateral. And they can do this as long as they return the liquidity within one block transaction. So it's almost like that's why it's called flash. Basically, it's like an instantaneous loan and then repayment. And what they do with that loan is where. And this is interesting that you actually used the term hacks, these flash loan hacks, because I always understood them as sort of like arbitrage loopholes. They found price differences basically in different protocols and were able to use this instantaneous flash loan concept to do a bunch of things, basically just shave off the differences as profit.
00:24:03.734 - 00:24:55.798, Speaker C: Yeah, and that's exactly. And practically when it comes to the hacks and arbitrage, definitely, I think the arbitrage is what happens, but let's say a hack as exploit. So one of the interesting things about DeFi is if there's a protocol where there's some sort of like a possibility to exploit. Is it designed as it should be, or is it just arbitrage? Because there are people in the DeFi community that think that every exploiting a smart contract is an arbitrage opportunity. But I don't feel that way. I think kind of like if there is a chance that users can lose serious amount of funds, maybe the protocol isn't designed that way because you will not deploy anything like that. For example, I know a lot of protocols will not want to deploy stuff that actually makes their users feel upset.
00:24:55.798 - 00:25:45.094, Speaker C: And that's the kind of thing. But the interesting part about flashlone is how they help people without the end users probably knowing it. So when you go to this app called DeFi saver or for example instadap, that are practicial ways to manage your different positions, you might, for example, created a vault in Makerdao, borrowed or printed die, and practically you spend that die, but you want to close that vault. Your ether, for example, might be their stock. So you can't do that if you don't have the funds available. But what you can do is that you just practically go to these services and click a button and confirm transaction. And what happens in the background is that a flash loan is taken from the ave protocol in form of Dai.
00:25:45.094 - 00:26:11.790, Speaker C: Then practically the loan is closed, etri is taken away from the collateral and then partly sold to Dai. The flash loan is returned, and then the user gets the rest of the collateral. And cool part about flash loans is that there is a reward for using that liquidity, so it increases on that, block the deposit rates. And that's a small but quite meaningful gesture for the depositors.
00:26:11.950 - 00:26:20.758, Speaker A: That's cool. I actually didn't know that flash loans were now being used in other super. That's news to me, Tarun, you probably knew that, but that's really cool.
00:26:20.844 - 00:26:52.862, Speaker B: I think it was used in other protocols before it was used for like. I think the problem with Defi is the opposite of the problem. The ZK community, where in the ZK community everyone talks about the engineering, but never the users. And in DeFi, everyone only talks about the users and trading and not about the actual engineering. But a lot of the engineering work is actually being done, has been done in January. Like the first flash loan, defi saver stuff was like a long time ago actually.
00:26:52.916 - 00:26:53.134, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:53.172 - 00:27:19.400, Speaker B: Like I remember the integration was. So I think people don't pay attention to the GitHub as much as they should in DFI. I think now in the last six months I've noticed it's increased a lot. Like the comments have increased a lot. But in the bear market days, I remember in 2018 and 19, I'd like look at your repo compound maker and there was basically no contributors even doing code reviews or looking at stuff.
00:27:19.850 - 00:27:51.700, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think there should be more actually activity, but I think now protocols are opening more to development with the community developers cron programs. So what I hope to see is that actually there will be more community developers that are participating in different protocols in that way, kind of like contributing. So I think the best phase of development community for ethereum projects is just coming up. That's my take.
00:27:52.390 - 00:27:54.450, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. That definitely makes sense.
00:27:54.600 - 00:28:08.620, Speaker A: What other projects since then have actually started to experiment with flash loans? Is there new concepts around flash loans? Has it actually evolved more recently, or is it still what was released in January 2020?
00:28:10.350 - 00:29:25.278, Speaker C: I would say applications where you can make capital efficiency for the end users. So I would say, for example, a way to swap debt is one of the coolest things, instead of it's a good example. So you could swap debt between, let's say, compound ave back and forth, depending on the interest rates. And practically what's happening in the background is that there's a flash loan that is taken, paid off and there's interesting kind of like developments every time you're in a position where you need capital to do transactions and I mean change positions, kind of always have to evaluate whether flash loans could be used. But I still think, could there be something else in the future? I think probably, yeah. I never doubt the innovation that we have in Ethereum community, because I think many of the projects are innovating quite a lot, but someone comes out of the bull and has very cold stuff, things that I would not expect to happen. And especially when you look at traditional finance, how things work there, what kind of products and services there are and how you could build them in the DeFi ecosystem, there's a lot of innovation.
00:29:25.278 - 00:29:45.974, Speaker C: And I think the various DeFi projects has interesting formulas. And even like in other protocol, there's still a lot of things to do. There's still a lot of things to do. Optimize, innovate on interest rates, risk, and I don't think we are still even, we're not peaking. DeFi is not peaking yet. I don't think so.
00:29:46.092 - 00:30:14.718, Speaker A: I have a last question about flash loans specifically though, which is the type of tokens that you can actually have flash loans with. I don't know if I just said that right but obviously you can take a flash loan of ETh, you can take a flash loan of dai I guess. But there's also some weird crappy coins. Is it any ERC 20? Are there any limitations? Yeah, I'm just curious how you actually deal with the various types of tokens and the flash loan concept.
00:30:14.814 - 00:30:22.370, Speaker C: Yeah. So at least at ave you could flash borrow, eat and other shit coins.
00:30:25.190 - 00:30:27.910, Speaker A: Unlimited, anybody as much as there is, of course.
00:30:27.980 - 00:30:50.470, Speaker C: So this is interesting part. So where's liquidity and where now other protocols are also implementing the Flashmont feature. If that particular asset is listed there as liquidity, you can do it. But what's now interesting is that some of the protocols are implementing minting functionality. So I don't know if Makerdao already has, but practically I think they have.
00:30:50.480 - 00:30:56.894, Speaker B: The ability to this proposal didn't pass governance to add flash mints, but maybe.
00:30:56.932 - 00:30:59.406, Speaker C: It'S good because I don't know about.
00:30:59.428 - 00:31:01.562, Speaker B: You, flash mints are a little bit scary.
00:31:01.706 - 00:31:03.570, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't feel confident.
00:31:05.430 - 00:31:42.010, Speaker B: For the listeners. Flash mints are basically, imagine. So a flash loan lets you borrow an arbitrary amount of capital in a pool. Take a function that depends on capital provided as the input. Let the function execute. If the function doesn't halt, that means it's found in arbitrage condition or some type of reasonable state that can pay back the loan and then the loan is closed. A flash mint is imagine you have a function where I say hey, what if I had an infinite amount of die? Like how would that change my function? So I go to the die contract, say hey, mint an infinite amount of die, run my function in a single transaction, and then burn all of that die.
00:31:42.010 - 00:31:50.574, Speaker B: And so it's a little scarier in that now you really do meet the bitcoiner's worst nightmare of like no supply cap.
00:31:50.692 - 00:31:58.578, Speaker A: But when you say it didn't pass, where didn't it pass? Tarune makerdao governance ah, okay, so slash minting is in Makerdao right now.
00:31:58.744 - 00:32:05.038, Speaker B: There's a pull request that already has it implemented. It's just that governance voted not to add it to the core protocol.
00:32:05.214 - 00:32:10.882, Speaker A: I see. But like flash minting, is this something that one could also propose for Ave?
00:32:11.026 - 00:32:14.598, Speaker B: It's for an ERC 20, so it's just for any asset you can add it.
00:32:14.684 - 00:32:24.054, Speaker A: Oh, I see. That was actually the question, is it the ERC process or was it like the maker Dow internal governance no, ERC.
00:32:24.102 - 00:33:07.762, Speaker B: Process, no, sorry, it's Makerdao. There is an ERC for flash minting, but I don't think that's going to get. I mean, people have made flash mintable tokens, it's just none of the ones that have high money velocity have flash minting added, right. At the end of the day, you need a token that people actually care about to have this feature for anyone to do anything super malicious with it. But it is weird because you could imagine a flash loan calling a flash mint. And that to me actually is like one of the kind of weird, you flash borrow some asset and then you use that as collateral to borrow something that's flash mintable and then you call flash mint on it. So obviously there's constraints to this on what functions can get executed in a flashland.
00:33:07.762 - 00:33:14.140, Speaker B: But it's kind of interesting, and I think there's a good reason people don't want to add it.
00:33:14.830 - 00:33:35.438, Speaker A: I'm now remembering James, actually, in that episode, the more recent episode, we talked about this, and he said that it's only when flash minting would only work if it's actually implemented into the DeFi protocol like you like, Ave would have to enable it for Aave particularly to be able to flash mint.
00:33:35.454 - 00:33:38.002, Speaker C: Yeah, for the Ave token, for example.
00:33:38.136 - 00:33:47.622, Speaker A: Yeah, but the ERC already exists, there is a standard on how to do it. And so yeah, just for our audience to understand a little bit more.
00:33:47.676 - 00:33:53.974, Speaker C: Yeah, what's interesting actually, Donald, was that unlimited min thing or did they actually have a cap?
00:33:54.092 - 00:34:01.000, Speaker B: They had a cap function, but it was initially set to minus one. So infinite to Max Int.
00:34:01.530 - 00:34:27.570, Speaker C: Yeah, because I could imagine, let's say if there is certain amount of die, let's say 2 billion. Well of course in that case you could use something that Ave, which has already died to flash borrow, but maybe it has some cap. But then again, if I'm thinking about it, the idea of mean you will just go to aven and just do flash loan from there with the Dai. I mean you don't need the minting. Unless there is not enough liquidity anywhere in Dai, then you could have this, right?
00:34:27.720 - 00:35:33.394, Speaker B: You could imagine a flash loan that does something where it makes an LP share and it mints a bunch of flash mints Dai to manipulate the Oracle price. Yeah, so it's a little bit weird. You could actually basically drown out all the other lps with a flash. That's the part where I think it's scary you don't want those in uniswap because it'll kind of actually mess up a lot of the arbitrary incentives. But actually, one thing I did kind of talk about, which is, and this is something I spend a lot of time trying to explain to kind of technical people in finance, is that flash loans are actually extremely unique to crypto, and they don't exist in the normal market, but there are analogs and they're kind of unique because with the blockchain, you can verify whether the loan actually was used for the thing. It was supposed to, the thing made a profit and it can be returned. But in the financial market, there's a lot of stuff that looks quite a bit like this, where a bank will give you a really short term loan for you to do a trade, and then you pay it back, like repurchase agreements.
00:35:33.394 - 00:35:47.450, Speaker B: And so I actually am curious, do you think, I know you guys are making an institutional push and a push for more non defi native users, which is great. How do you see institutions using flash loans, or maybe bigger entities?
00:35:48.030 - 00:37:04.254, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's quite interesting question. Obviously, if they're doing something in DeFi and they need the liquidity, but let's say that they're trading and they want to use flash loan to flash borrow and it trades. But one of the things could be fascinating is that if you're on the level in institutional usage, that you are actually tokenizing things. And upon that tokenizing, imagine that you could tokenize some sort of debt, or any kind of like not even debt, but could be anything. And you practically could just temporarily mint enough in DFI that it becomes very attractive. Then you can ask a question like, you have an instrument that is in traditional finance that actually is in value, let's say 1 million, but you could temporarily in DFI get it into 10 million. And that might be interesting, could have interesting dynamics in terms of, is it that case, if you want to do stuff, would you rather do it in defi than in paper finance? And in traditional finance, but that could be something I could see, like innovative way of getting flash loans into something where you can't stretch.
00:37:04.254 - 00:37:28.730, Speaker C: You have an instrument that you can't just stretch in traditional finance. It's just like it will not work because of the nature. But when you tokenize that asset, then you have the value on chain, and then with the minting, you can stretch because the instrument doesn't decrease in value of this one block minting, because the next block is back in the same position again, unless someone else stretches on that block. That could be something.
00:37:28.800 - 00:37:40.318, Speaker A: Although then you'd then come back, though, with this stretched amount, and you'd need some vehicle to reimburse that into the real world assets, I guess yeah, I.
00:37:40.324 - 00:38:22.140, Speaker C: Could imagine some cool situation where you have a couple of this kind of assets, and then basically you pile up even this asset, these kind of asset types that are very difficult to stretch in traditional finance. And then you create a marketplace where you can trade with these assets, and then you will have a bit more margin on your trades, or you can use them somehow. Honestly, I don't know what could be that kind of asset, but I could imagine that this could be interesting in institutionals to kind of realize that maybe that could be a way of utilizing flash loans, that we have something that we have limited amount, but we could actually quite easily trade it.
00:38:23.950 - 00:38:24.506, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:38:24.528 - 00:38:25.854, Speaker C: That could be one thing.
00:38:26.052 - 00:39:35.462, Speaker B: One of the things is the way I usually explain what a flash loan is, is imagine to a trader is like, if you're a trader and you go to an exchange and you say, hey, I want to borrow x amount of bitcoin for 1 hour, the exchange will quote you some price. And if you say, I want to borrow it for 30 minutes, they'll say, I'll quote you half the price, roughly. And if you say 15, they'll say roughly half the price. Now, what happens when you say you want to borrow it for zero duration? And it's actually impossible in normal finance to actually do a zero duration loan unless you can verify in the way that you can on chain. And so there is kind of a question of what assets are compatible with zero duration loans. And those are the types of things where there's a ton of instruments actually, in traditional finance that are kind of illiquid, where people are too afraid to borrow against them unless it's a really long time period. But there's kind of the flip side, which is actually, if you could do a zero duration loan and take a small percentage of the basis point on this really illiquid asset, you would totally offer that.
00:39:35.462 - 00:39:57.980, Speaker B: And so that's sort of where I've always been kind of curious how finance people, if this is communicated correctly to them, would figure out, oh, houses barely trade, but somehow I can get some margin on my house, on the brick in my house. And I think that's more interesting than like, hey, I tokenized a house. Buy one brick from this house.
00:39:58.670 - 00:40:34.760, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. You give additional functionality, you provide more efficiency. I would really love to see this happen in a way you always see flash on in use cases that people build, like, in efficiency, but this will be, like, actually in the tokenization level, and, and it could be cool to see, like, if, if something happens. Yeah, I mean, in. In general, I think there should be more tokenization. I mean, I would love to see more different kinds of assets, but there's their own challenges there as well.
00:40:35.290 - 00:41:26.198, Speaker B: I always feel like this is the real reason to bother tokenizing a real world asset. So people are always like, oh, what's the point of tokenizing a real world asset? I can make an SPV special purpose vehicle or a REIT, like a real estate investment trust, put a bunch of things in there and sell you shares in it. And isn't that the same? Why do I need a token? But actually, the zero duration loan is fundamentally impossible in the world of lawyers and pens. Sorry, not to insult your former colleagues, but it's actually impossible in that world. Whereas I actually think if you're tokenized, you get this functionality. And I think, until this year, I didn't realize that that's actually the real kind of crazy benefit of tokenized assets is you get stuff like this.
00:41:26.364 - 00:41:29.980, Speaker C: Well, Tarun, we have a weekend. We can build something. Exactly.
00:41:32.030 - 00:41:33.100, Speaker B: There you go.
00:41:33.950 - 00:41:43.050, Speaker A: Okay, so more recently, you have a new function or instrument called credit delegation. What's credit delegation?
00:41:43.390 - 00:42:24.410, Speaker C: Yeah, so practically, how the vending borrowing works in Aave is that, let's say, user comes into the protocol, deposits, let's say assets, and then starts to earn interest. Right. Then a credit line is open to you, so you could actually borrow against your assets. But I think it's roughly 70% of the depositors there actually are not exercising their credit lines because their interest more lies in actually earning yields. And what we realized, that actually what you could actually do is delegate that credit line that you have to someone else that you might trust. For example, I could delegate to Tarun. I trust him.
00:42:24.410 - 00:43:13.238, Speaker C: I could delegate to a smart contract that has some sort of closed loop function that it can only farm a token, and then I can call back the delegated funds. Or one interesting function is just that that trusted person could be an entity. So I could imagine that some beautiful day, there might be some kind of like, a institution that is borrowing that. So we're delegating to the institution, and they're borrowing from Abe without a collateral. So this is the key thing. So the depositor keeps the collateral and keeps earning on the deposit, but then the delegate takes the borrowings. And what could be interesting, this entity relationship, that you could convert it to, let's say, dollars and put it to work in traditional finance.
00:43:13.238 - 00:43:23.826, Speaker C: So kind of that we get defi a two way stream. So there's assets coming in, liquidity coming in, but also, it's a way of source liquidity and consumer.
00:43:23.878 - 00:43:38.478, Speaker B: And for the record, this type of thing does happen in traditional finance quite often because it sort of helps. You have the appearance of under collateralized loans that are actually technically collateralized.
00:43:38.654 - 00:44:28.466, Speaker C: Yes, normally what we're used to in DeFi is we have cryptographic collaterals. Right. But very typical scenario in traditional financial world is that you're going into a bank and you're taking a loan and you have a co signer, so someone else is putting the collateral and you're borrowing. But in essence, what we are looking to achieve is that some sort of way that we add a bit more trust networks around the protocol. What's good about this, in technical sense, risk sense, is that the protocol doesn't bear additional risk. So the protocol is collateralized. So it has a collateral and there's an under collateralized loan relationship, but it's practically with the peers, and you can even pull it.
00:44:28.466 - 00:44:43.298, Speaker C: You can create a vault where there could be multiple depositors depositing into a vault that is borrowing to farm in DeFi or to convert stablecoins USD and just lend it out in traditional finance.
00:44:43.474 - 00:45:33.858, Speaker A: So the next point that I want to talk about with you is I want to talk about the things that nobody wants to talk about, gas prices and usability in terms of the base chain being ethereum. From where you're sitting, you were originally named ETH Lend. You're clearly deeply within the Ethereum community. Smart contracts are at the core of everything you're doing. But what happens in moments when either ETH is so expensive that gas just inevitably is expensive, or the network is so congested that prices also go up for gas. So it makes basically small loans, or small lending, or small minting, collateralizing. All of those things become incredibly expensive, especially for users that don't have excessive amounts of funds.
00:45:33.858 - 00:45:41.178, Speaker A: So what are your thoughts on that phenomenon? Like? You've definitely watched it, I'm sure it affects your thinking?
00:45:41.344 - 00:46:34.474, Speaker C: Definitely, yeah. I mean, the original idea, also kind of in Italy, period, is that we kind of saw the on chain lending and earning a way that it democratizes a bit because it's not restricted to borders. Right. And what's cool about the average protocol and the deposits is when you deposit, let's say 100 USDC, you get in return so called a tokens. So 100 a USDC, and those a tokens practically grow in balance. So it's direct crediting of what you earn and plus the underlying debt for the depositors. So in essence, it's kind of like a global permissionless savings account and USD nominated that has automated treasury management and it's globally accessible to kind of like it's not restricted to me.
00:46:34.474 - 00:47:14.360, Speaker C: And cool is that practically I will get the c yield, Darren will get the same yield, someone in Brazil will get the same yield. So there's this democracy thing going on and at the same time gas prices are getting high. And usually issue here is that if you deposit 100 USDC into the protocol, but you're paying 30 USD in gas and even higher. I mean, we saw some crazy stuff going on recently and you are not earning anymore. Actually, you are going into a situation where you're paying to deposit. I mean, that's a negative interest rate if you think about.
00:47:16.090 - 00:47:51.746, Speaker A: Mean. I can, I can say from personal experience, having played around a little bit during defi summer, but being a little bit of a chicken with the amounts that I actually wanted to play around with, I definitely earned nothing because of gas prices. Like any earnings that I made were eaten up by pretty excessive gas prices. So I would say I fall victim to exactly that. So what would you say is as a project, what are you thinking about? It sounds like this democratization is your goal, so this sort of prevents it. Like, are you looking at l two s? What are you thinking?
00:47:51.928 - 00:48:53.666, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we always try to state that Ethereum is our headquarters, the community is here, it's a great community. And I think just talking about the tech, practically what we have here is enormous security in the sense that how much kind of like Ethereum as a network secures transactions. But I agree that you don't need to secure all the transactions at the same level. So imagine a system where you go to a bank and you transfer funds and all the people in the world would need to kind of accept that transfer, say yeah, then you have high security, but not all transactions need this and use cases. And this is always kind of like an issue for us because as we want to be Ethereum native, we also understand that if everyone is going to L2s and we're staying here, we will become like the bitcoin of lending protocols, the maxis.
00:48:53.858 - 00:49:12.554, Speaker B: Well, I actually did, just while we were talking, think about a weird use case of credit delegation, which actually matches this l two question, which is imagine a credit delegation from someone who wants to fund someone to be a validator for a L2.
00:49:12.672 - 00:49:13.882, Speaker C: Yeah. For example.
00:49:13.936 - 00:49:30.562, Speaker B: So you do need some base protocol. You need this type of stuff on the base protocol because even the L2, you're not getting around the fact that someone's locking up capital on the base protocol. And so in some sense, you can't forsake the layer one at all. You have to just make it easy to transfer from a layer one position to L2.
00:49:30.616 - 00:50:05.360, Speaker C: Yeah, and that's the kind of thing. So the cool thing is that if the L2 ecosystem is big enough, you could just access directly by assets, and if there's gateways. But the beginning will be very not like this. I mean, the beginning is like transition phase. And the thing is that usually when we start discussions, we have calls with some of the other d five projects. We start discussion. So what's your l two strategy? And everyone is asking the same question all the time.
00:50:07.410 - 00:50:13.774, Speaker B: This reminds me of 2017, when every Fortune 500 CEO company was asked, what's your block?
00:50:13.822 - 00:50:15.940, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly the same.
00:50:17.350 - 00:50:20.260, Speaker A: What's your l two strategy? Has taken it over.
00:50:21.190 - 00:51:11.390, Speaker C: This is challenging because some of the projects are doing things on, let's say, obm. And then you have some cool stuff, like you have the zero knowledge with ZK sync, which is quite interesting because you practically can eliminate this kind of like a work horse that you need people to validate. And also the, and, and also there's matic and plasma. There's different kinds of things. And you could cross port, make usability everywhere with the tokenized positions. But deploying infrastructure to each and every blockchain is a big thing. So let's say if you have to change something in the main chain with the same infrastructure, you have to change in other places.
00:51:11.390 - 00:51:32.940, Speaker C: And also if you think about, for example, ZK making proofs on all of the functions, and it's not that straightforward. So it's still a big question to us, like how we will do the L2. And it's not just about L2, it's just about how we get rid of the gas issue.
00:51:33.390 - 00:51:40.334, Speaker B: One thing to point out, flash loans and zero knowledge proofs are not actually even clear that they can be compatible with each other.
00:51:40.372 - 00:51:40.718, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:51:40.804 - 00:51:41.502, Speaker A: Oh, true.
00:51:41.636 - 00:51:43.630, Speaker C: So we already lose one baby.
00:51:48.210 - 00:52:03.730, Speaker A: There are projects that are emerging that have the exact same, or like, it's very, very simple for Ethereum based smart contracts to be redeployed on new chains. Is this anything you've even considered? Or do you feel like even asking the question is a bit sacrilege?
00:52:04.150 - 00:52:51.138, Speaker C: No, we have actually the work that goes there and managing, I mean, once you deploy, you deploy, but then you kind of, like, I think probably we estimated that the biggest work actually is to manage the risk. So if you have, let's say different chains. And the thing is not just kind of like, I would say, like in risk wise, let's say there's three interesting chains that we want to deploy. So first we have our own different avenue markets and then we have the different chain deployments. It's a whole lot of work. So one of our things is that we want to decentralize our risk management so that there's parties that can contribute to the risk management and guide the governance. And that could help, but it's quite a lot of work.
00:52:51.138 - 00:53:35.870, Speaker C: And at the same time, we want to keep the rate of innovation constantly high enough so any management thing will actually draw it back. And some of the stuff I still want to see that they work like OVM, I want to see it actually work. Things are very early. And the good thing about protocols like Ave is that it's not kind of like one of the first that needs to be in L2 because obviously trading and that requires more frequent stuff. Could be, but still, if everyone is going somewhere, it's like we have to be in the same party. There's no other choice.
00:53:37.650 - 00:54:46.150, Speaker B: By the way, this reminds me of an allegory that was told to me by someone who is a friend of mine who is like the third or fourth employee at Dropbox in 2010. Basically, iPhones kind of just came out like the non CDA George Hotts illegal App Store, but like the Apple App Store just started and Dropbox was like, okay, we only have enough engineering resource to build for one platform, either Apple or Android. And they chose Apple and Samsung after a while. And this reminds me a lot of all the layer ones right now. And stanny, you can tell me if this matches your experience, but this is kind of what I've observed is Samsung came to them and was like, hey, look, we will pay you to build your app and we will build your entire app for you if you make an Android app and support it and whatever. And I think he was saying startups at that time of their stage were like maybe 50% of apps took those deals and the other 50% didn't and stayed on Apple. But he said within two years, 100% went back to Apple.
00:54:46.150 - 00:54:51.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought that was like a very interesting, because it reminds me a little bit about the current.
00:54:52.064 - 00:55:14.740, Speaker C: Do you remember there was already thrown a bit like this gas thing isn't like a new thing. There was like way long time ago. I can't remember the time frame where the L2 s and everything. There was a lot of discussion and people were planning and was it actually, even before the bear market or something that then people forgot about it or something. But the cryptokitties. Yeah, exactly.
00:55:15.910 - 00:55:17.330, Speaker A: Wrecked the network.
00:55:18.790 - 00:55:51.530, Speaker B: I think the thing that's interesting is other layer ones always capitalize on this moment to raise more money. But the interesting thing right now is I think 2018, all the new layer ones and professor coins and stuff were like, oh yeah, we're going to beat ethereum on our own. We'll build our own stablecoin. We'll do this, we'll do that. 2019, they're like maybe a little more hesitant about that thesis. And then this year, 2020, since summer, all I've seen is every layer one big life, we're building a bridge. And so that basically turns them into L2.
00:55:51.600 - 00:55:52.202, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:55:52.256 - 00:56:03.306, Speaker B: And I think everyone's going to kind of end up being a L2. And now the competition amongst L2s might be more intense than the competition among apps. Liquidity. That's my 2021 prediction.
00:56:03.418 - 00:56:04.080, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:04.850 - 00:56:21.430, Speaker B: The fight for block space is going to be aggregators. Fighting. Layer twos are a form of aggregators. Things like urine are a form of aggregators. So individual users won't actually be making single transactions, they'll be batched somehow. Yeah, sorry, that's my hot take prediction.
00:56:21.930 - 00:57:00.130, Speaker A: All right, Stani, this has been a really cool conversation. And dig into Ave, I have one last question that I want to ask you, which is about kind of going back to the story you told about your background, having studied law, since you know law and you know this space, super. Like, what is your feeling on kind of regulation? How the laws of the ecosystem work versus the laws of the real world? I don't know if we should say that anymore. The other world, we're all so used to just staring at screens that I don't actually know what the real world actually is anymore. But anyway. Yeah. What's your thoughts on regulation?
00:57:00.950 - 00:57:36.080, Speaker C: At some point you kind of think about what should be the relationship with regulation we have and what we're doing, what's happening in the space. And when you're dealing with smart contracts, it's kind of like one of those things where it's practically regulation. So it's just different type of regulation because the nature is different. So traditionally law has been created to protect. Right. So you create law, then you create also agreements on top on matters that practically you can agree upon. And eventually you go to court if something went the other way.
00:57:36.080 - 00:58:49.030, Speaker C: And what we have now is that practically all kinds of rules could be built into smart contracts, and they need to go to court because they're self executing. The issue, of course, is that most of the value in transactioning is happening in the legacy systems, but it doesn't actually restrict most of the stuff going into the decentralized way. Even like in the physical world, there could be decentralized network there, and then you have the actual cryptographic value networks, which is the theorem. And one thing we should do this year is build more kind of different kinds of protection mechanisms in the sense that traditionally, let's say, law has been about, could be about investor protection, consumer protection, so forth. Those kind of functions could be built into smart contracts and even made better transparently. And I think probably blockchain is the best rectech tool, the best one. You have all this transparency, and practically you can build more security mechanisms.
00:58:49.030 - 00:59:48.582, Speaker C: I don't think we have realized yet the potential here how it could actually, smart contract could replace law completely. That is something we actually have even thought about. One thing I need to chill about Ave is that the governance, because we divided the vote delegation, where you can delegate votes to, let's say, protocol politicians from actually delegating proposition power. And this is interesting in the sense, because in, let's say, governments and different bodies, usually you have lawmakers that are creating the law, and then you have the politicians who are voting on the proposals. And here in decentralized systems, the law is practically the code that we create. Right? So practically, that's the idea. So you have different people for creating code, which is the regulation, and different people voting, whether it's good or bad code regulation practically.
00:59:48.582 - 00:59:57.660, Speaker C: There is the old school debate about whether code is law, but we can have another podcast on that.
00:59:58.910 - 01:00:19.570, Speaker A: Sounds like a totally new topic. It's an interesting scenario, though, because I always think of crypto as being such a cowboy, kind of like wild west scenario in a lot of ways. And yet what you're describing is like a very rule abiding society as well. And so that's kind of an interesting juxtaposition.
01:00:20.470 - 01:01:01.642, Speaker B: I mean, one thing to note though, is that lending protocols in general, both compound and Ave, have been kind of the only protocols to prove that they need a governance token so far in some ways, right? They actually really use them quite a bit, and you actually use them to safeguard assets, to be like, we're not going to add this asset, we're going to change these parameters. Whereas a lot of other governance tokens have very dubious direct utility to the protocol. I mean, sometimes they might. I'm just saying it takes a little while. But in the case of lending. It's always been something where you need some form of oversight because there's an implied social contract.
01:01:01.706 - 01:01:32.466, Speaker C: That's true. I never actually thought about this way but I do agree. I mean there's so much risk exposure and I don't think we even realize how much different kinds of risk there are in Defi. That's also another topic but kind of like that's also cool part about DeFi because everything is transparent. You can calculate everything the exposure and make interesting tools you might not be able to do in the similar extensively in traditional finance because you are trusting.
01:01:32.498 - 01:01:34.774, Speaker B: Always someone or it'll take you a long time.
01:01:34.812 - 01:01:35.302, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:35.436 - 01:01:37.240, Speaker B: To get everyone to give you the data.
01:01:39.530 - 01:01:40.280, Speaker C: Cool.
01:01:40.850 - 01:01:46.670, Speaker A: So I want to say thank you Stani for coming on the show and sharing all of this with us.
01:01:46.820 - 01:01:49.840, Speaker C: Thanks, Anna. Thanks, Tarun. It was fun.
01:01:50.930 - 01:01:52.382, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah.
01:01:52.516 - 01:01:54.890, Speaker A: And to our listeners, thanks for listening.
