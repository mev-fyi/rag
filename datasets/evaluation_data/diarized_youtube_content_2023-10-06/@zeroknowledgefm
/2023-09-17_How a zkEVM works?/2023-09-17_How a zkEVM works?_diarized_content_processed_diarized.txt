00:00:00.330 - 00:00:41.110, Speaker A: Let's frame. What's the finality of acidic KVM? Okay, so for those who don't know, the idea of aztec VM is just taking a set of transactions, something that we call a batch of transactions. And instead of sending each transaction to the network, what we do is we generate a proof for the validity of such transactions. The important thing here is that the nature of these transactions be on any kind. Okay? So for example, we can have sax actions sending ether from one account to another one. Or we can have a sax action executing a function in a smart contract. Okay, so what we do, instead of sending the sanctions, we generate this proof, and we instead send the proof to the blockchain.
