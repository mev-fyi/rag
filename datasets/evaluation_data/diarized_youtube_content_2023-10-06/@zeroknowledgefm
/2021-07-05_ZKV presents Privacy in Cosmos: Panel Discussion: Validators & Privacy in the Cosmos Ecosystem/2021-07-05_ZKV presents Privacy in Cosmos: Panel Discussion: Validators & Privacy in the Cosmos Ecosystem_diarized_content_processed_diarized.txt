00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.954, Speaker A: I have a number of questions I want to jump into, but first, maybe I will quickly introduce everyone here. So we have Zaki, who just joined from iclusion, and sommelier. We have Adrian from Heliax Anoma and previously, Cryptium Labs. We have Felix from Chorus one, our new partner. Thanks, Felix, for basically in the chat being like, we're live. I was like, oh, I mean, awesome. Billy is here from the ICF, and Dave is here from Sika.
00:00:31.954 - 00:00:56.062, Speaker A: And now osmosis. Did I say that? All right. Did I miss any affiliation? Let me know if I feel free to jump in if there's another company I should mention there. No, I got it. Okay. All right. So I think my first question is, it's been three months since we last did a session, and we actually did a panel in that event as well.
00:00:56.062 - 00:01:08.878, Speaker A: And I want to hear from you, kind of like, from each of you, what is the most exciting development in cosmos that's happened in the last two months? Two, three months. Let's start with Adrian.
00:01:09.054 - 00:01:39.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, honestly, the answer is pretty obvious. In my opinion. IBC is life, and osmosis has proved out the use case that IBC is like a reasonable ux that you can actually move assets with. This was really not clear to begin with, if honest, whether IBC transfers would look in any sort of way reasonable. And I think osmosis is really proving out that IBC works in practice. So I think over time, we start seeing a lot more adoption of IBC.
00:01:40.590 - 00:01:46.606, Speaker A: Cool. All right, who wants to go next? Felix, what's new with you or what have you?
00:01:46.708 - 00:02:22.490, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I can just, could repeat just what Adrian has said, but I'm going to also add, I think, a lot of things maturing, right? A lot of chains coming to launch in the cosmos ecosystem, be it their osmosis or also, like, injective today. And really, I think a lot of the tooling, kind of cosmos being used widely. Peggy Bridge coming to a lot of chains. So I think really cosmos, really bright future and great moment right now in the ecosystem, and we're super excited to be part of this and support a lot of chains.
00:02:23.550 - 00:02:26.300, Speaker A: Zaki, what's new from your side?
00:02:28.270 - 00:03:25.790, Speaker D: All I would say is shame on Adrian for ever doubting that IBC was going to be awesome. But osmosis definitely made the IBC dream a reality, and that has obviously been, I think, a big deal. It's been super cool to see several thousand IBC packets moving every single day now. So you go to map of zones, you see tons of activity the atom osmosis trade route is alive and well, and a lot of the vision is sort of expanding the way it was always intended to, finally. So that's kind of cool. I think all of this stuff is kind of paving the way for privacy now. Because before we had IBC, our privacy solutions would just be the same as everyone else's privacy solutions, which is privacy for the native asset inside of your chain.
00:03:25.790 - 00:04:01.050, Speaker D: Limited bridges, limited composability, vision, and the same semantic constraints that every other blockchain has, where you need a shielded pool and a non shielded pool, and then you have to have a way to get in and out of them and all of this stuff. And how do you get exchanges to support all of this and the general nightmare of privacy and blockchain integration? And I think IBC basically solves a lot of that, and we are just right at the cusp of the frontier.
00:04:01.950 - 00:04:07.498, Speaker A: Cool. All right, Dave, your project keeps getting talked about, so maybe you should weigh in.
00:04:07.584 - 00:04:15.482, Speaker E: Yeah, for me, this is definitely the osmosis launch. It feels almost like a cop out answer here. Pretty stoked.
00:04:15.546 - 00:04:18.160, Speaker A: Funny if you highlighted something else, but yeah.
00:04:21.010 - 00:04:43.090, Speaker E: I think I see go live and have this much impact. I don't know. I really got the sense that this cosmos dream we've been working towards for years. I don't know. I felt like this is the first time it was met with all these IPC transfers. Sub minute latency for moving things around. Beyond that, I've had a ton of fun, like the last three months, watching all the progress on Laze's ledger and heliax.
00:04:43.090 - 00:04:49.240, Speaker E: I've been following the repos pretty closely and tons of cool developments going on there.
00:04:49.710 - 00:05:08.426, Speaker A: Very cool. Just a little note, Dave and I actually, with sunny, recorded an episode of the Zero Knowledge podcast, which is coming up next week. So look for that. Just so everyone kind of is ready for that. Billy, we haven't heard from you. You are sitting at the ICF. You have a slightly different perspective.
00:05:08.426 - 00:05:16.350, Speaker A: I feel like you see all these other kind of maybe things coming up. What was new in the last three months that was very exciting?
00:05:16.850 - 00:05:39.960, Speaker F: Yeah, definitely have my hand in a lot of pots. And it's a lot of stuff that won't be really publicly visible for a long time. So it's like, I feel like I'm often working on different timescales, which can be frustrating as well. I want to see it now. I mean, even with seeing IBC live, I've been dying to see the sharp edges. You know what mean, like when you see it live. Like, where are the hiccups going to come? Because that's the really exciting part of seeing that it's actually happening.
00:05:39.960 - 00:06:30.150, Speaker F: But in light of this being a privacy event, I would say one of the soon to be live features that I think has a potentially interesting application with privacy is an ICS called interchain accounts. It's ICS 27. So it was the first one that was basically merged after ICS 20, which is a token transfer. This is the application level standard for IBC. The IBC is agnostic to the contents of the packets, but inside of those packets, if you write standards, then it becomes easy to parse on both sides. And ICS 27 interchange accounts basically allows you to send a packet across IBC that is executed on the receiving chain as if it was a normal account who was executing a normal message. And so depending on exactly how it's crafted on the sending side, you can basically create contract based accounts.
00:06:30.150 - 00:06:57.118, Speaker F: So you could have an entire blockchain, basically control an account collectively on a different blockchain, the way a smart contract can interact with other smart contracts on Ethereum. And it opens up a lot of possible applications. One of them is like staking derivatives. One of them is sort of like group management of funds. You could imagine like the community pool is a DAO that controls funds collectively. And they use those things in different DeFi operations. Maybe they use them to collectively stake.
00:06:57.118 - 00:07:28.250, Speaker F: You have sort of like business development between blockchains. You could do a token swap between community pools. Each of them delegate tokens on each other's validators. There's lots of sort of cool stuff there, but in terms of privacy, I think also sort of like an interesting feature of IBC fact that you could have basically a private blockchain that's being run with its own internal rules and things like that. Doesn't need to use cryptography to be private. It could just be privately run from a few nodes who only know about the existence of each other. They could come to sort of terms, they could be relatively.
00:07:28.250 - 00:07:59.510, Speaker F: They don't have to trust each other in the same sense. They have a use for a blockchain, but they can still sort of collectively manage assets on a remote public blockchain. And the only aspect of that public blockchain that they can see are the IBC packets that come through. So actually who's managing that system? What is the composition of it that can be completely private? Not through cryptography, just because it's maintained on private servers that they have traditional access control with, and they only expose those IBC packets that interact in interesting ways on remote blockchains.
00:08:00.250 - 00:08:11.610, Speaker A: What kind of project? I'm trying to understand from what you described there, what projects would use that central bank currencies.
00:08:11.950 - 00:08:38.530, Speaker B: Which one central bank currencies is like, I think one of the obvious cases there, right? No central bank is ever going to give up monetary sovereignty to the east. Two validator set or to any other validator set. So I think, honestly, the way to get central bank currencies into these systems is to allow them to expose proof of authority chain IBC connectors effectively via which they can issue and redeem in and out of the assets.
00:08:39.510 - 00:08:57.000, Speaker F: You could also imagine sort of like a private Dow. So it's a bunch of people who have enough trust to put their money together, but they want to have strict accounting with like a byzantine fault tolerant system and state machine with accountability. But they also don't want their inner workings to be visible to the larger public.
00:08:57.530 - 00:09:15.710, Speaker B: Companies issuing shares, I think is another one, actually. Even like things like tokenizing supply chains, right, like Volkswagen isn't going to run on ethereum. They're going to issue car NFTs and then they can still run the ecosystem. If you actually want to get a car in exchange, you go back to the Volkswagen IBC connector.
00:09:17.330 - 00:09:30.260, Speaker A: So you mentioned the ICS 27. So that's a standard. But is there tooling that would need to be built for this? Or would you expect the teams that are interested in building this to build all of it into?
00:09:31.030 - 00:10:24.334, Speaker F: The way ICS module works is there's like a core module that's able to basically process these messages, produce them for outgoing, and also receive them incoming and processing. So that's like the first layer that is sort of just supplied out of the box inside the Cosmos SDK. It's part of the IBC team's sort of work that we're doing here in interchange. And then you would have a secondary module which actually has logic about under what conditions can you produce outgoing transactions. And that's where you might have really customized stuff for your own project, like you might actually put in some custom engineering about. I want these conditions before the blockchain is willing to produce an outgoing message on behalf of all of us by default. And the other module that we're planning on producing as part of this is to utilize the governance module.
00:10:24.334 - 00:10:42.282, Speaker F: So you'd be able to go to the governance module, say, hey, I've got a message that I think we should execute on the Cosmos hub. It's a sale of the tokens that we have there for this other token set. I submit that message to the governance module. The token holders on this local chain will vote, should we execute this message? Yes.
00:10:42.336 - 00:10:42.698, Speaker E: No.
00:10:42.784 - 00:11:12.900, Speaker F: If it gets voted yes, it gets handed off to the ICS interchange account module, which converts that into an IBC packet that's ready to be relayed. So then anybody can take the contents of that packet and submit it to the cosmos hub. It goes to the interchange account there. It says, oh, yeah, I know about the connection to that blockchain. I know that it controls this account. And here's a message that it says it wants to execute on behalf of that account, which is directed at the Dex, for instance, or whatever it is that it's directed at at the very end.
00:11:17.910 - 00:11:56.560, Speaker A: Cool. All right, next kind of direction I want to take. So out of the five of you, four of you are validators, or were validators. In the case of Adrian, you were a validator. One of the things I wanted to ask here is, what is the role of a validator on the Cosmos hub in the cosmos ecosystem? And I'm wondering if that's changed in any way as IBC has sort of, like, unlocked the zones and connected all of it. And I don't know if you have thoughts on this, but, yeah.
00:11:59.410 - 00:12:01.874, Speaker B: It just opens up the software stack that you have to run.
00:12:01.912 - 00:12:02.210, Speaker D: Right.
00:12:02.280 - 00:12:43.898, Speaker B: And, like, the ways you can help the ecosystem grow over time. I think, as a validator, I think you are focused genuinely on proof of stake. So you're running multiple chains not specific to cosmos ecosystem, actually. And I think now with IBC, you're also just going to be running multiple relayers that bridge between different chains, whether it be near to cosmos, near to osmosis, osmosis to Cosmos, whatever. Right. I think one of the underexplored aspects, though, of this is that validators will also make very good market makers over time, especially if you're really in lots of data, because you're going to see a lot of the arbitrage opportunities on the different chains. You're probably going to have accounts on different chains.
00:12:43.898 - 00:12:52.850, Speaker B: And I think if I was a validator right now, this is probably the future direction I take my validator in, which is arbitrage across chains.
00:12:53.190 - 00:12:56.110, Speaker A: Wow, that's exciting.
00:12:56.190 - 00:13:15.478, Speaker E: That feels similar to miners should all be front running, where as a miner, you have this capability, but then should you execute it? And it seems right now that miners don't, just because on Ethereum or weren't. Maybe they are now just because they were lazy or didn't know have a generalized front running bots.
00:13:15.654 - 00:13:46.334, Speaker B: So, honestly, this feels different, though, because you and me, we are biased here. We're going to solve front running on single chains pretty soon, especially once built on tendermint. But I don't think we should call it front running if you like, supply liquidity, if you keep the osmosis amm stable in relation to coinbase or uniswap and Ethereum.
00:13:46.382 - 00:13:46.642, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:46.696 - 00:13:51.974, Speaker B: This is what I mean, that you have a lot of pricing opportunities because you're watching and running all these chains anyway.
00:13:52.092 - 00:13:56.950, Speaker E: You meant, like, take ARB opportunities or take liquidation. There's a compound chain.
00:13:59.690 - 00:14:56.650, Speaker D: I think we should assume that there's going to be a trading venue of some kind on every cosmos chain, that there is going to be price distortions between them. This is the world that we're seeing. Ethereum is going to have an amm on every roll up, right? Every roll up will have an amm. And so now you have some sort of. And then there's the true heterogeneous world of l ones. Then you have these ecosystems, like the substrate ecosystem, the substrate ecosystem, the cosmos ecosystem, the avalanche ecosystem, the ethereum roll up ecosystems that are all very similar into their structure. And so there's just going to be this pervasive need to constantly be arbing the markets between them to ensure financial stability.
00:14:56.650 - 00:15:16.480, Speaker D: But this goes to my general thesis, which is like, if you are running a validator, you have two directions that you can go. You can either be a capital deployer or a protocol developer, or all three, if you really don't want to sleep ever.
00:15:19.410 - 00:15:27.600, Speaker B: Okay, all three, you're running into tons of conflicts of interest, Dev. You may experience this relatively sooner, I guess. Lucky as well.
00:15:27.970 - 00:15:37.378, Speaker D: Oh, absolutely. I'm very familiar with these conflicts of interest. I don't think we will be running a validator on sommelier, for instance.
00:15:37.474 - 00:15:41.266, Speaker E: Yeah, similar to we're not running a validator on osmosis.
00:15:41.458 - 00:15:43.020, Speaker B: We have exactly the same.
00:15:44.030 - 00:16:14.100, Speaker A: I want to bring. Continuing on that question, though, the role of the validator in our case. I sort of forgot to mention me in this group I've mentioned there was four out of five. There's actually five out of six. But is there a role for. I mean, granted, what we're trying to do, which is also push for some ideas, potentially build in certain directions, is that still something that validators, you think validators should be taking a role on?
00:16:14.790 - 00:16:57.834, Speaker E: Absolutely. Especially with how governance is structured in the cosmos ecosystem? I think not so fundamental to abstract staking, but I think that concrete staking in cosmos where when I stake to you, I don't just delegate money for security network, I also delegate my governance vote. And in that regard, this is then critical. The governance opinions of validators at the moment are very important. I do think we can imagine a world in which we separate the governance rights from the staking rights, and you get ward separately. That's not the world we live in right now. So until that happens, pushing for governance change, I think is an important part of being a validator.
00:16:57.962 - 00:17:57.810, Speaker F: Yeah, I was going to say, from a user perspective, I'm mostly the person who's looking at the list of validators and definitely selecting the worst qualified one. Whoever's got the lowest commission rate, whoever has the flashiest picture, whoever has a brand familiarity, or whoever, I'm familiar with the person doing it. And all of that is a combination of politics and Hollywood marketing. You know what mean? Like, I think that's actually an aspect of validators, that we're going to see a lot more additional services, not exactly in the way I think it's mostly been spoken about, but more like, I don't know, like airdrops and access to group chats. And I think that I would expect that validators should want to have actually a much closer relationship to their delegators, whether it's like updates, chat, being able to send notifications. Hey guys, thanks so much for your loyalty. All of this sort of stuff will only increase the delegations and increase the power, which if that leads to a better profit margin, it seems inevitable.
00:17:59.210 - 00:18:40.580, Speaker D: It's interesting, right, though, that Sika was like one of the pioneers in this, right, having really good relationship with their delegators. But you've run into the inevitable tensions, which is, hey, we want to build a protocol now. And so again, you don't have as much time to be and resources to put to that. There isn't like building a standardized toolkit for a toolkit for validator. Delegator interactions and stuff like that are all things that are still TBD to be for the most part. Like, the stuff needs to be built. I've wanted to build it, but haven't had the time.
00:18:40.580 - 00:18:46.900, Speaker D: And I think we run into this general situation of generally not having enough time.
00:18:49.430 - 00:19:09.498, Speaker F: I wonder if the tipping point will be staking derivatives, at least on the short term version of it, in which you would have a staking derivative attached to an actual validator. And so the identity of that validator becomes an economic pressure as well, for the fact that you're trying to have the highest valued one in different ways. Or if we're going to see that most derivatives are essentially priced the same.
00:19:09.584 - 00:19:33.410, Speaker B: Regardless of the valid, I would expect the latter, that most derivatives are priced roughly the same. Actually. Wait, there's a caveat to this. I think most derivatives for public validators that are sort of similar, sort of seeker course one inclusion figment staked whatever, right? Like they will be priced similar to each other, the randoms won't.
00:19:34.950 - 00:20:46.970, Speaker C: I think it also depends, going back to this MeV discussion, in a way, if the validator is doing these arbitrages or whatever, if he can give back to his delegators, I guess it might also impact pricing of his staking derivative or something. I think that's also where the loyalty thing comes in and could be a very interesting dynamic. I definitely tend to agree that the actual role of the validator becomes in this current ecosystem much more financial in a way where it's not just about kind of DevOps anymore, but more like, okay, how do you understand what's happening in this defi on these chains? And can you use it? But maybe also you have this powerful position. Do you exploit it? Do you not? I think the validator also has more social responsibility than kind of the proof of work miner, who no one cares about. The validator is more public facing, will have content, will have a Twitter account, and then people can call them out and also unstake if they see them kind of being detrimental to the network or trying to do things that maybe you have a harder time kind of forbidding miners to do. So I think it's a really interesting dynamic.
00:20:47.710 - 00:21:21.602, Speaker E: There is some superlity still in cosmos to rewards, which I think also relates to your point about if they're doing arbitrages or liquidations and they do some kickback to their delegators. Currently, we actually still have this in cosmos where the proposer for block gets a larger percent of the reward. So if I have a higher staking power, I propose more often, I get more reward than everyone else than other validators. And so I don't know if we've seen this impact delegator decisions because that would be kind of a similar effect to the kickbacks or liquidation.
00:21:21.666 - 00:21:22.134, Speaker D: It might be.
00:21:22.172 - 00:21:23.078, Speaker E: No one knows about this.
00:21:23.164 - 00:21:23.800, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:25.530 - 00:21:40.330, Speaker C: Maybe it's not big enough, right, the money you're making from this. But we're kind of soon probably entering this moment where it will become more valuable as there is like amms and all these d five applications.
00:21:41.390 - 00:22:28.490, Speaker B: I honestly think that Valdez are not really going to compete on price, I mean, all valdiers will charge will return the same amount of money sort of within a narrow band of fees, probably from 5% to 15% or so. And whether you pick five or 15 probably actually doesn't impact your delegation amounts all that much. Like what we discovered, for example, with cryptium is that most people cared about our stances in the ecosystem, much more so in our fees. This doesn't apply for the small holders that are very loud on Reddit and Twitter, but for the large capital deployment integral there, this is where they didn't care whether it was five or 15% fees. Effectively they cared like what stances you take in the ecosystem.
00:22:34.900 - 00:23:00.250, Speaker A: I want to kind of bring it back to privacy and the role of validators. What could validators do to promote or push for privacy? Is there anything, I mean, this is our big question to ourselves constantly, but are there things that you could start to incorporate into the validator's role that actually could push some of this tech forward?
00:23:02.540 - 00:23:26.560, Speaker E: To Zaki's point earlier, at least in the Cosmos hub, a lot. The early validators were people who work in the protocol and there's know feedback loop where a lot of validators end up being like protocol developers. That's one way. The second way is also just trying to market to build the meme of privacy. Is this important thing in the telegrams convincing all these voter rights? This is what popped to mind. I don't know if there's.
00:23:29.720 - 00:24:42.990, Speaker D: I think one of the biggest questions is really going to be, as privacy enabled technologies that require validators start to pop up, how is the reputational aspect of being a validator on them going to don't. I don't think any of us wants to be a validator on the money laundering blockchain. Right. And so legitimizing privacy as an important function that a validator provides as part of their overall service portfolio, I think is a really important thing. And why I've been such a supporter of zk validator, because zk validator brings a lot of brand positivity and this is advancing cryptography and science aspect of privacy to the sort of privacy space and these events. All of these things really help us push an impression of running a validator on a privacy blockchain as really furthering these causes rather than providing a convenient way to launder money.
00:24:43.600 - 00:24:45.916, Speaker B: Yeah, I would absolutely agree with this.
00:24:46.018 - 00:25:13.990, Speaker A: This is an issue of all privacy tech too. We constantly ebb in and out of these conversations. And I think as a validator, as a very public facing entity, obviously, I don't think anyone here would want to be part of something that isn't good. And at the same time, in our case, we are extremely focused on privacy. And so this is sort of a dilemma that we, I'd say, so far, have not faced. But could.
00:25:14.440 - 00:25:48.130, Speaker B: I think long term, it'd be very helpful if validators start pushing very much the narrative of financial privacy is an important, fundamental human right. They come out strong out of the gate, saying that this is why we support these privacy endeavors on chains. I think we should very much shift the conversation away from money laundering towards this. Helps people press parts of the country, of the world, or country to be safe from government prosecution. Right.
00:25:49.060 - 00:26:37.104, Speaker D: It also makes markets safer. Right. Like what anoma is building and the threshold decryption stuff and all of this stuff. It makes markets less vulnerable and provides consumer protection. So there's like, a definite consumer protection angle to all of this. The other thing that I thought was an interesting dynamic in Cosmos is like, I would say that the political role of validators in the hub sort of peaked in 2020, when sort of cosmos politics was in peak chaos and has declined into 2021, as the sort of political institutions of cosmos have sort of solidified. Again, something that's kind of disappointed me.
00:26:37.142 - 00:27:07.096, Speaker E: Since even kind of early inception of the hub is how little impact I feel like validators or governance directly has on the direction the protocol is taking. We've never voted on like, or, okay, we've voted once or twice, but it's never been a big deal for where governance votes. I want this feature in the next upgrade. It's been more so like some college hub development team or collective says, here's this new upgrade hash. You should.
00:27:07.278 - 00:27:12.964, Speaker D: This is not true. Sika is deeply opposed to gravity decks coming to the hub.
00:27:13.012 - 00:27:19.230, Speaker E: Yeah, but that's like, the recent. Historically, I feel like it's part of.
00:27:19.600 - 00:27:32.176, Speaker F: Hub readiness checklist now. Every feature goes to the hub to confirm, even at early stages. Hey, we're going to continue working on this feature because we think it belongs on the hub. Do you guys agree with that? I mean, it's a little bit harder to wait.
00:27:32.278 - 00:27:47.540, Speaker D: Do you think any of the exchange validators are happy about bringing the gravity bridge to the hub? No, it's only the overwhelming interest from atom holders that is a reason to keep putting in all this effort.
00:27:51.080 - 00:27:55.060, Speaker E: Sorry, I didn't realize it's part of the checklist to get voted in. That's actually extremely exciting.
00:27:55.900 - 00:28:49.864, Speaker F: Can I ask a question about validators and privacy really quick, which is maybe just an extension of this. I feel like I've seen demos or grant applicants from before I got into the ICF that were related to plausible deniability of the operation of the validator itself. Validators are in some ways the most precarious point of a network that may be deemed, like, illegal or something like that. They often are public legal entities that could have cease and desist or takedowns depending on the jurisdiction. But certainly there's technique. Be curious if anybody knows what the status of them are for running a validator completely anonymously or in a way that you could be public but not proven to have produced any of the blocks. I know there's this problem of like, you need to be public and sort of like, why would I delegate to the sketchy validator? But there's also certainly a gray area.
00:28:49.902 - 00:29:06.750, Speaker B: Between, I mean, an interesting thought could be, can you participate in consensus where it's unprovable whether you have participated, but you're still stashable? This seems very hard and maybe impossible, though.
00:29:11.140 - 00:29:35.480, Speaker D: There's a cryptographic frontier system. I forget the name is slipping my mind right now. But basically it requires cryptography that we don't have yet in order to have slashable accountable. But like consensus protocols, you don't have flashing. It's trivial to do anonymous proof of stake.
00:29:37.660 - 00:29:42.992, Speaker B: Just as a point here, you should have flashing non slashable systems that prove long term unsafe.
00:29:43.156 - 00:29:45.470, Speaker E: Oh, is it functional encryption is what we need?
00:29:50.480 - 00:30:02.960, Speaker D: Yes, believe it's what it is. I'm trying to remember if you can do it with functional encryption or you need indistinguishability obfuscation.
00:30:03.940 - 00:30:06.960, Speaker E: These are pretty related in constructions.
00:30:09.140 - 00:30:44.190, Speaker B: Generally on the point of validator privacy. I actually think it's not a long term concern that I particularly hold for these ecosystems. I think it matters much more how geographically distributed your validators are. And generally speaking, these are small entities. They're not like massive failure points like one large exchange. And so taking a lot of Aldias down at the same time is very hard. And what we've seen from these exchanges, which at the moment everyone is using to wash their coins, is that even centralized exchanges run out of shady jurisdictions are incredibly hard to take down.
00:30:44.190 - 00:30:52.592, Speaker B: Yeah, I would expect you to come after the fiat offerams much before they try to come after the protocols themselves.
00:30:52.726 - 00:31:03.190, Speaker D: Yeah, going after validators like it becomes too difficult to run occlusion. We just unbond all our coins and move on. Right. Do other things.
00:31:05.000 - 00:31:48.160, Speaker A: I think one thought here, and it doesn't exactly solve what you described, billy, but I know that Henry, who is in the chat, has been actually doing work on. I don't think it's privacy for validators, but I believe it's privacy for the delegators to the want to, if you want to say anything there, just to clarify mean, and I don't know if looked on the validator side, if you've actually explored what it would be to be privately validating, but definitely somebody to be in touch with around that rough area. And actually, I think it's the only project that I've seen that's really dealing with it. This is penumbra.
00:31:49.860 - 00:32:23.420, Speaker E: There's another question of does it suffice to have kind of bandwidth privacy where I have someone, a non identity, then no one can locate my servers or find the person behind it. We also have found this is historically pretty hard to run a very live server that no one can trace. So maybe with Nim this might get fixed. But I don't know. I think it's a very hard side of maybe one of the hardest network anomaly cases to handle.
00:32:27.600 - 00:33:13.710, Speaker A: All right, I think we have about ten minutes left in our session, and I have a question about osmosis going back to Dave's project. And the question here is, what does osmosis do to the ecosystem? What does it mean for the way that all of these things are running? And I feel like there might be slightly different opinions in this panel here. Basically, the question here is, how does osmosis being live change? Or what does it do to the role of the Cosmos hub itself? I didn't say that too.
00:33:16.240 - 00:34:14.160, Speaker D: I will. I will say that basically my expectation has been that the lifecycle of Cosmos zones is going to fundamentally change because of the emergence of IBC connected. Because if you kind of look at what was the lifecycle of a Cosmos zone was you go out, you start like, a Cayman foundation, you sell tokens to investors and validators, you get a network up, you go to an exchange, you try and get that exchange to list you. Then your token has some liquidity. Then you have community events and marketing and telegram groups and all of this stuff. And this was like the original way of doing things. And now the way of doing things is going to be like, I get a small number of validators, two, three, four validators.
00:34:14.160 - 00:34:50.540, Speaker D: I get a zone up, I connect to the Dexes on the hub and osmosis. I maybe make a community proposal to spend some community funds on incentivizing an osmosis pool. I immediately get liquidity, start building a community of users and validators. My validator set grows organically over time as value accrues to the token. And all of this heavyweight stuff that people used to complain about Cosmo suddenly goes away. It's all unlocked by having a Dex connected over IBC.
00:34:54.560 - 00:34:56.190, Speaker A: What does this mean for the.
00:34:59.280 - 00:35:39.180, Speaker B: So this is very true. This is like reducing massively the burden of launching new independent chains that connect over IBC, right? But I also think the more interesting thing will be to. Not the more interesting thing, but a different thing is going to be how the topology of IBC connections evolves. So currently we're seeing this only. I mean, map of zones is great for this. Currently we're only seeing this really with things built with the Cosmos SDK, but here we're already seeing. It's not like a hierarchical connection, right, where things connect to each other much more fluidly, rather than all go via a central hub.
00:35:39.180 - 00:35:59.220, Speaker B: It'd be interesting to see what happens as soon as there's an IBC connection going on to Nia, whether that flows only through the hub or that flows into the hub and osmosis and region, maybe, and how this is going to structure. I think this is going to be the most interesting. To me, this is the most interesting thing, like how this topology of IBC connectors evolves.
00:36:00.760 - 00:36:12.852, Speaker E: I'm also kind of dubious if we're going to get this hub and spoke model organically playing out. Unless there's like thousands of chains. I'm not really seeing how it's going to model.
00:36:12.906 - 00:36:27.896, Speaker B: Makes a lot of sense for a lot of smaller things. Like if you have like Ethereum style smart contract chains, kind of like they will need a hub and they're the spokes to this. But I think all major chains, it's not necessarily going to be this hub and spoke model at a global.
00:36:27.928 - 00:37:15.370, Speaker D: No famous chains. So I use the term famous and non famous chains, which is, I think, a much better model and a much better way of thinking about interchange protocols. IBC is a protocol that's designed to work in both famous and non famous chains. Other people are building protocols that are really only designed to work between famous chains. But I will say that you're already seeing right now atoms really doing the job of providing the liquidity injection into the ecosystem that everything else needs. That's why the atom osmosis trade route is so valuable and why the Osmo atom pool is so valuable. And at very least, atoms are supposed to do that.
00:37:15.370 - 00:38:04.430, Speaker D: I think every other functionality that atoms provides, there's going to be lots of competition, like the Hubkit will have a Dex, but you will have osmosis, and you will have numerous other Dexes and will have a bridge, but you will have lots of other bridges to various chains that don't natively support IBC. And as people get native IBC support, flat topologies will dominate, because that's the way these things should be. So on the one hand, I feel like atoms are really doing their job. They're doing the job that we worked really hard to get atoms out there early, to have a lot of regulatory clarity around atoms, so that exchanges could freely list them, and there could be many on ramps and off ramps to atoms, and they seem to be doing their job.
00:38:07.120 - 00:38:11.870, Speaker A: What is the status of the gravity decks, and will that change something?
00:38:15.860 - 00:38:35.472, Speaker D: The version of the hub software with the gravity text was released, I believe. I think yesterday or Monday. Monday. The last couple of days have been really busy and blurry. I put up the governance proposal to adopt an upgrade on Monday as well, and we are currently voting on it, so please vote.
00:38:35.616 - 00:38:47.400, Speaker A: Cool. Is there any predictions on what this will mean for the hub? Is there a goal with this that maybe can be articulated?
00:38:50.220 - 00:39:20.932, Speaker B: Go on, Zucky. Sorry. No, no, go mean in my mind, whether there's like a goal or. What does it mean? It's sort of the wrong question to ask. It's more that I think it's cool to see tons of experimentation, and I think right now the focus should be, we've covered so little of the space we can be occupying here, and this isn't that it's either osmosis or the gravity. DaX is some other thing. We should very much think about this.
00:39:20.932 - 00:39:29.110, Speaker B: There's so much unexplored space, and we should try to occupy as much of the unexplored space as possible and not try to fuck each other.
00:39:30.680 - 00:40:01.376, Speaker D: I do think that, as a practical matter, one is that a Dex in the IBC network is an essential service. And so it certainly would be bad for the cosmos ecosystem if there wasn't only one. And I do think when you get down to an essential service in the IBC ecosystem, my belief is the hub should have that in its protocol. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be other competing ones. It just simply means the hub should provide all the essential services of the IBC network as much as possible.
00:40:01.558 - 00:40:12.320, Speaker F: The Dexes themselves also have different features. They're sort of, like, better suited for different specific use case. There's certainly lots of overlap, but totally divergent roadmaps.
00:40:15.220 - 00:40:32.890, Speaker D: The gravity Dex is going down the uniswap V three concentrated liquidity route role. And the osmosis is much more focused on MeV protection. I don't really see threshold decryption coming to the hub anytime soon.
00:40:33.580 - 00:40:47.170, Speaker F: Very different approaches MeV. I mean, the hub has batch transactions, so there's already mev resistance within that on the amm. And I guess what's the timeline for threshold decryption on osmosis? Because until then you guys are front running.
00:40:50.820 - 00:40:51.376, Speaker D: As is.
00:40:51.398 - 00:41:06.724, Speaker E: Batch things timeline special? Not entirely sure yet. We're actually working with helix pretty closely on this. I don't know, hopefully by end of the year. I think that's possible because we're also.
00:41:06.762 - 00:41:24.344, Speaker B: Deploying them into anomal. Right. So we are looking to launch with full fundraising protection, Mav protection, so as soon as possible. But the crypto is pretty much upgrading tenement at this point, so we'll see. But end of the year is very good bet.
00:41:24.462 - 00:41:27.100, Speaker D: Yeah. Abci Plus plus is very exciting.
00:41:28.960 - 00:41:51.030, Speaker E: Yeah. I think one thing that's exciting about having two Dexes is now we get this cross chain arb that Adrian was talking about. Sick. As famously as a stance, we don't think gravity decks on the hub is the move, but given that's the world we're living in, I think it is going to be exciting to see this Arb opportunity play out. Like our ballad is going to step up for this role of using their lower latency to make this happen.
00:41:51.560 - 00:41:52.260, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:41:52.410 - 00:41:58.564, Speaker D: Another good thing, I think, about having the gravity decks is it put a gun to Osmosis's head to watch and watch fast.
00:41:58.682 - 00:41:59.350, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:01.720 - 00:42:04.484, Speaker B: That is very cool. I have a question, actually. Wait.
00:42:04.602 - 00:42:05.488, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:42:05.594 - 00:42:22.012, Speaker B: Just generally, what do you think is going to be the first life chain that adopts IBC? As in like, not built on the famous chain, first non SDK chain. By the way, I would say that.
00:42:22.066 - 00:42:49.780, Speaker D: In general, substrate stuff is like the most staffed at this point of everything. Right. There's a lot of work around various variants of Istanbul. BFT doing a cello IBC bridge is actually also a modest amount of work. Oasis was just talking about how they're going to. And they're not Cosmos SDK, but they are tendermen.
00:42:52.280 - 00:42:57.076, Speaker B: It's probably either going to be near in my mind, or someone coming out of anyone.
00:42:57.178 - 00:43:01.144, Speaker D: I just don't think anyone at near is working on it. They have other stuff to worry about.
00:43:01.182 - 00:43:04.924, Speaker B: I think it's going to change because now there's liquidity and actually things are happening.
00:43:05.042 - 00:43:10.284, Speaker A: Felix, you have to drop off. But I actually wanted to ask will I will.
00:43:10.322 - 00:43:15.772, Speaker C: I can stay on for a final question. We are working on this.
00:43:15.906 - 00:43:16.444, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:16.562 - 00:43:18.804, Speaker E: Wait, what is it? Say it again, salo.
00:43:18.872 - 00:43:20.610, Speaker C: As we are working on it, I have.
00:43:25.780 - 00:43:26.608, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:43:26.694 - 00:43:30.820, Speaker D: There's too much going on. Like, I knew this. I spoke at the cello conference.
00:43:32.280 - 00:43:52.092, Speaker A: That's exciting. Well, listen, I mean, we're at time. Felix. I know. You have to jump. Thank you all for this awesome panel check in, helping us to kind of go through what's happened over the last few months. We have added links in the chat to the feedback form which we need for our report, as well as the.
00:43:52.092 - 00:44:08.460, Speaker A: The ZK hackathon survey, in case it might be something interesting for you or you want us to do it virtual. That's kind of what we're trying to figure it out, but, yeah, please do fill those out. And I hope to see you at the next privacy and cosmos event from the ZK validator.
00:44:08.960 - 00:44:09.484, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:09.522 - 00:44:10.108, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody.
00:44:10.194 - 00:44:10.988, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:11.154 - 00:44:12.600, Speaker A: Cool. Bye.
