00:00:05.450 - 00:00:56.998, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. This week I catch up with Zucky Munyan, co founder of Iclusion and Sommelier. We do a massive recap of the history of Cosmos, bringing us up to date since our last interview two years ago. We cover the IBC launch Osmosis as the catalyst that really got it activated, how the ecosystem grew and accelerated up until the Luna crash, and what the recovery and prospects of Cosmos have looked like since. We then discussed sommelier, which offers managed Ethereum defi strategies from a cosmos based chain.
00:00:56.998 - 00:01:30.250, Speaker A: Lastly, we explore the concepts of emerging asset classes such as real world assets, and how ZKP's for privacy may finally find a product market fit that could bring real market adoption. Now, before we kick off, I want to quickly let you know about the upcoming ZK summit nine event happening on April 4 in Lisbon. Join us for our 9th edition with all the latest research and most cutting edge implementations in the ZK space. Applications to attend are open. I've added the link to this in the show notes. Hope to see you there. Now, Tanya will share a little bit about this week's sponsor.
00:01:31.390 - 00:02:03.998, Speaker B: Alio is a new layer, one blockchain that achieves the programmability of Ethereum, the privacy of zcash, and the scalability of a rollup.

00:02:15.770 - 00:02:26.310, Speaker A: So I want to welcome back Zucky to the show. Zucky's the co founder of iclusion and sommelier. He's aware of many hats and an advisor to many things. Hi Zucky.
00:02:26.390 - 00:02:31.260, Speaker C: It's great to be here. I love this podcast, and so it's always a pleasure to be on this.
00:02:31.570 - 00:02:45.914, Speaker A: You know, it's funny, so you've been on three times, but your last time on was quite a while ago. It was. Let me just pull it. March 31, 2021. It's almost two years.
00:02:46.052 - 00:02:49.506, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a lifetime ago. So many things have happened.
00:02:49.608 - 00:03:09.462, Speaker A: Yeah, it's weird. As a starting point, it would be really good to catch up with you. That episode two years ago was all about the Stargate upgrade. And this got me thinking, actually, in prepping this, what is the timeline of cosmos? Maybe you can just do a step by step. For example, I forget if IBC had already launched or not.
00:03:09.596 - 00:03:11.078, Speaker C: Yeah, it's very fast.
00:03:11.164 - 00:03:12.486, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:03:12.588 - 00:03:54.854, Speaker C: 2014, J Kwan comes up with tendermint as, like, an idea and is basically the first person who's like, I can reconcile the differences between academic, basically useless BFT research and this weird Satoshi nakamoto bitcoin thing. And basically, Jay gets all of the key points right. So I started a company which will become relevant to the later parts of our discussion called SKU chain, where we were going to do supply chain assets on blockchains. When we started that company, we raised a little money. We were in an office with a project that later became definity. So there used to be this mailing list called Crypto Economicon. It was a Google group.
00:03:54.854 - 00:04:28.226, Speaker C: And that was, like, back in the day, where all the smart people, where a lot of the smart people who were kind of, like, a little bit less maximalist, were all hanging out. So we invited that mailing list to our office. And so Vitalik came, vlad came. Vlad had a friend from college named Ethan Buckman. Just like a lot of people who would go on to be big parts of the crypto industry all came to this conference. So Jay and Ethan met each other. Honestly, I think, for mean, I remember talking to him after it.
00:04:28.226 - 00:04:49.026, Speaker C: He was like, yeah, I watched Jay's presentation. It was probably the first. Really got him started thinking about proof of stake in a different way. So all of that happened. So then Jay and Ethan start working on it. That's 2015. 2016, they decide to do a public chain because they kept trying to find enterprise users of blockchains.
00:04:49.026 - 00:05:19.410, Speaker C: And at the time, it was all IBM and everybody. Nobody wanted this tiny little project by two nerds, two weirdos in the mission. So they decided to do a public chain. Collectively, we arrive at the Cosmos architecture, which was very inspired by both Jay's work on. On chain light clients and Mark Miller's work on interoperable sovereign systems. So Mark Mario are one of the founders of Agoric. So I didn't know him at the time, but I'd found his website and stuff, and I was really into it.
00:05:19.410 - 00:05:35.478, Speaker C: Okay, that's 2016. So 2017 fundraiser raised $17 million. ETH is like $40. So everything goes up. So the Interchange foundation basically gets funded. 2017, 2018. I joined the project full time.
00:05:35.478 - 00:05:58.570, Speaker C: We do game of stakes. At the end of 2018, we start the validator program. Companies like Figment, advice and trails all get started in the Cosmos validator program. 2019. We launched the proof of stake network on top of Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. We get early adoption by some projects. That leader turned out to be significant.
00:05:58.570 - 00:06:05.598, Speaker C: Both finance adopts the Cosmos stack for doing B and B chain, and Terra adopts us.
00:06:05.764 - 00:06:07.018, Speaker A: For better or worse.
00:06:07.114 - 00:06:24.422, Speaker C: For better or worse. That's 2019. So at that point, Agoric had been founded. And so I call up the Agora guys and I'm like, the plan was always, hey, we're going to implement your ideas on top of Tendermint. Well, Tendermint is live. I told you I'd call you when it was done. Well, here it is.
00:06:24.422 - 00:06:28.150, Speaker C: Come help us implement it. So we design IBC together.
00:06:28.300 - 00:06:32.634, Speaker A: Oh, really? I didn't know the agoric team was really involved in the IBC design.
00:06:32.752 - 00:07:08.246, Speaker C: Yeah. If you want to give you my best guess as to why IBC works as well as it does is it's because Mark and Dean have basically implemented all of their ideas in enterprise settings, like, two or three times before. And we just implemented them on top of tendermint and public blockchains. And so we got to skip a lot of. We got to imbibe two to three decades worth of burnt fingers experience. And this is, like, why IBC just, like, you opened the box and it just worked instead of having to stumble around in the dark for several years. Right?
00:07:08.428 - 00:07:13.878, Speaker A: Crazy. Wait, so tell me, say this again. Design completion. IBC is when.
00:07:14.044 - 00:07:35.274, Speaker C: 2019 is the design of IBC. So 2020, Jay becomes increasingly unstable and difficult to work with. So the entire engineering team basically leaves. I leave work on inclusion. Jack goes to strange love. The Berlin engineering team splits off into a subsidiary of the ICF.
00:07:35.402 - 00:07:42.094, Speaker A: Yeah, that was 2020, spring, and this is right before the lockdown and everything.
00:07:42.132 - 00:07:44.154, Speaker C: But at that moment, this was right before lockdown.
00:07:44.202 - 00:07:45.666, Speaker A: Cosmos was looking.
00:07:45.848 - 00:07:47.854, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, everybody thought we were dead.
00:07:47.902 - 00:07:50.994, Speaker A: It was, like, super not clear it was going to be okay.
00:07:51.112 - 00:08:38.494, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. I was not sure if we were going to, like. But Chris goes and I had, like, a blood pact. We said, if there's no money, if there's nothing, we will write IBC ourselves, if that's what it comes down. Like, we just swore to each other that no matter what happens, we were going to ship IBC, but there was this odd thing that is, like, way down in the details, and nobody really remembers it, where the way we built IBC involved deeper changes with Cosmos SDK that had the unfortunate impact of breaking a lot of our exchange integrations. And so that's what the Stargate episode was about. It was about this massive process of both shipping IBC.
00:08:38.494 - 00:09:01.706, Speaker C: So then we ship IBC. So all of this stuff is done IBC. Everything is done in about late November 2020. But between the holidays and chinese new year, there was just, like, no reason to launch this. We could not launch this thing until March. So we launch IBC on the Cosmos hub, March, we do the stargate upgrade. It's all a success.
00:09:01.706 - 00:09:09.558, Speaker C: At that point, I'd already started working on sommelier, but the honest answer is, nobody had a plan for what to do after IBC launched.
00:09:09.654 - 00:09:10.202, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:10.336 - 00:09:15.754, Speaker C: And so kind of IBC just kind of, like, sat around. Nobody really did anything with it, although.
00:09:15.802 - 00:09:48.390, Speaker A: People used, like, what's crazy now is think about when we talked about that upgrade and that time two years ago. I mean, since then, there's been all of these chains launched. There's, like, exchanges that actually, the fact that they could have sort of this boom of airdrops two years last year was because there was some way to move it around this ecosystem all over IBC. But it's funny when I just said that, though. I just said. And since then, it's been used a lot, but you're shaking.
00:09:48.470 - 00:09:51.594, Speaker C: So there's, like, this gap. There's march to.
00:09:51.792 - 00:09:53.386, Speaker A: Okay, okay.
00:09:53.488 - 00:09:56.666, Speaker C: And then in July, osmosis comes.
00:09:56.768 - 00:09:57.498, Speaker A: Ah, yeah.
00:09:57.584 - 00:10:24.110, Speaker C: And osmosis bootstraps IBC. They bootstrap. Know the airdrop is a success. They launch with this amazing sort of skinner box user experience where you get your rewards. You got to reinvest it. They bootstrap all these liquidity pools, and osmosis gets off to the races, and osmosis, suddenly, it establishes this pattern. Right? You can launch a chain.
00:10:24.110 - 00:11:01.022, Speaker C: You can incentivize a liquidity pool. You can do airdrops. You could bootstrap liquidity. And then by the end of 2021, the UST carry trade is, like, the dominant thing happening in cosmos, where, basically, most the smarter people realized that the best way to get into anchor was to buy atoms, take them to osmosis, swap to UST, go to the terra chain, and deposit into anchor, and in and out. And so billions of dollars are now flowing over IBC, and it's through osmosis, and it's kind of crazy.
00:11:01.156 - 00:11:19.206, Speaker A: It sounds amazing when you say it, by the way. Billions of dollars are flowing over IBC through like. I know we're thinking of the project, but just, if you take the words, it's such good branding. Anyway, just in terms of timing, you're talking end of 2021. We're going into 2022.
00:11:19.308 - 00:11:19.960, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:20.570 - 00:11:22.578, Speaker A: What happens to cosmos?
00:11:22.754 - 00:12:09.346, Speaker C: So, in 2022, for the first half of the year, everything is kind of going gangbusters, kind of up, only things are going well. Lots of airdrops, lots of airdrops, lots of liquidity, everything. And then Terra collapses in May, and that's a huge blow to the ecosystem. Cosmonauts lose many millions of dollars from being in the osmosis, liquidity pools and stuff like that. Many of us have, like, six figure plus losses. It's hugely damaging to the ecosystem and everything. On the other hand, the reality is that from a tech point of view, Terra was always very distant.
00:12:09.346 - 00:12:23.466, Speaker C: The thing the core Cosmos team was constantly trying to figure out a way to do is get go to actually fund some technology development, actually be more involved in building the platform. But none of that stuff actually had happened at that point.
00:12:23.648 - 00:12:42.186, Speaker A: Just a question I actually want to ask you about that moment. So when that happened, was there an existential crisis in cosmos? Was there like a moment because it was so closely tied, it was running on the Cosmos SDK? It was a zone, a chain connected to IBC.
00:12:42.298 - 00:13:07.250, Speaker C: It was a zone, it was a chain. It was the largest pools on osmosis. It was the dominant stablecoin in the IBC ecosystem. It was like, frankly, a large percentage just had a large impact in our user base. There was also a lot of concerns about consensus takeover. There was this whole very dramatic thing about where the validators of the terra chain kind of stepped in and took over the chain, essentially by freezing, staking.
00:13:07.410 - 00:13:08.454, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:13:08.652 - 00:13:14.970, Speaker C: It was by far the most chaotic thing that has ever happened I've ever seen, ever been a part of. It was crazy.
00:13:15.120 - 00:13:20.346, Speaker A: And to go to zero that fast, had you ever seen anything like the thing?
00:13:20.368 - 00:14:05.946, Speaker C: Okay, so the thing is, I was very well aware of the death spiral risk of terra, okay? Right? Every time anyone had asked me about it, investing in Luna, et cetera, I would say things. The same thing. I would say, probably the best thing about Luna is the mechanism is very simple, like the code. You could read all of the code to. How does USD work in an afternoon? Occlusion had actually written an implementation of the oracle at one point, because for a while, we were actually validators on Terra, though we had dropped out of the validator set because we were uncomfortable is like the actual answer. But we still had some Luna exposure. But we had dropped out of the validator set because we were sort of uncomfortable with how things were going there.
00:14:05.946 - 00:14:22.046, Speaker C: But I would always tell people, I'm like, well, there's this thing that'll happen, right? If Ust dpegs, which is you could print infinite Luna and it just destabilizes the whole system. The system has a huge debt spiral risk. And that totally was a thing.
00:14:22.148 - 00:14:39.930, Speaker A: But was there sort of the sense that it was like, it could happen, but it won't happen. Why, if that was so well known, did people still continue to. It was for, I guess, the first half of the year, or maybe even longer. The stablecoin of cosmos, the largest non.
00:14:40.030 - 00:14:43.014, Speaker C: Dollar backed stablecoin in the entire ecosystem. Right.
00:14:43.132 - 00:14:46.786, Speaker A: Was it bigger than maker, do you think? Yeah, definitely bigger than dai.
00:14:46.818 - 00:15:19.422, Speaker C: It was bigger than dai. Oh, it was huge at the peak. It was like $30 billion or something like that. What I think about what UST was, it was basically a fairly interesting and novel financial structure. It was like a form of leverage introduced into a system that had never existed and could never have existed without blockchains and probably without the cosmos SDK, it would be relatively hard to build. Kind of leveraged, a form of leverage like this. But then the people who were really drawn into that ecosystem.
00:15:19.422 - 00:15:59.006, Speaker C: Right, were people who were really good at leverage and momentum jump galaxy, all of those things. I continue to talk to those teams on a regular basis. I talked to those teams on a regular basis there. I talked to them about the DPEG risk also on a regular basis. And it seemed like there was enough financial firepower to sustain the system at that level. And sort of the general vision of Luna was like, use this extreme form of leverage, like this form of leverage that was built into the system to grow really fast, get big and then sort of buy your way back to.
00:15:59.028 - 00:16:01.578, Speaker A: Solvency, almost like become too big to fail.
00:16:01.674 - 00:16:04.602, Speaker C: Become too big to fail and then buy your way back to solvency.
00:16:04.666 - 00:16:21.762, Speaker A: Yeah, because I guess there was sort of almost a dependency on people buying back. And you sort of saw that in the exact moment of the fall where there was talk of trying to get some backstops, some big groups to come in and kind of keep the peg.
00:16:21.826 - 00:16:55.818, Speaker C: Because it had happened at smaller scales. At smaller scales. People had stepped in in previous times when the peg had been tested. I don't think the full story of what happened is known still right now. I think it's going to be really interesting as the Alameda and Genesis bankruptcy filings kind of get worked through, how much information about the fall of terra. But these actors were very, without a doubt. And it's like publicly.
00:16:55.818 - 00:17:15.350, Speaker C: Right, the UST for bitcoin trade that set up the stability fund, the counterparty was genesis. Right. And so that's public knowledge. And I think it's going to be really interesting to see how much of the financial history of this period of time comes down.
00:17:15.420 - 00:17:38.302, Speaker A: I mean, this sounds like a book like the things happening behind the scenes to cause Luna, which was obviously built badly and had that vulnerability. But then to see the cascade and all of the ways that people tried to sort of escape it, and it just sort of bulldozing over everyone involved in a way. Wow.
00:17:38.436 - 00:18:07.430, Speaker C: I would say that a lot of the people were heavily invested in Luna, knew what it don't. The question of whether or not it was built badly represents an interesting question, because it's really more about what do you think is an ethical level of risk in a product. Right. The code was there. Anyone could read it. I do not think that ultimately this is a story that is primarily about fraud. I think it's ultimately a story around the code was there.
00:18:07.430 - 00:18:38.718, Speaker C: The people who backed it were super familiar with how it worked. The DPEG risk was well understood in terms of what would happen. And the question is, was this a product that exposes too many people to too much risk of loss to ethically build the product? Which is an interesting question and a question that I have feelings about. I work on stablecoins all the time. I build stuff on top of stablecoins. On sommelier. I work on the agoric stablecoin ist.
00:18:38.718 - 00:18:59.000, Speaker C: I think a lot about what is the ethical level of risk? If you build a decentralized stablecoin of any kind, there is some amount of risk. And the question is, what is the ethical level of risk to expose people to? And I think that is a more interesting and more nuanced question that I think has largely been lost in the whole.
00:18:59.870 - 00:19:28.594, Speaker A: I do think at the same time, when you say that one of the faults of the luna ecosystem I think you can pin on them is the marketing around how it worked and how safe it was. It wasn't that they were going, hey, this is very high risk, but could have great reward. That wasn't the marketing. And a lot of people who couldn't read the code, like, yes, the code is there, but they wouldn't understand that. They're not looking into the code were kind of taken in.
00:19:28.712 - 00:20:14.026, Speaker C: There's a weird thing, though, about the culpability there because the people who were most aggressively marketing it, as safe, as far as I can tell, were the exchanges themselves. I think it's hard exactly to find something from t because everybody's looking. That would be your smoking gun fraud claim right there. They said it was safe. They didn't disclose how it worked or its risks, everything. And so mean, from what I've seen, I think I haven't seen anything where somebody is actually able to pin TfL down on that work. Where you find the misleading stuff is on the exchanges, on the docs around that, where it's like, oh, this is a stable coin, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:20:14.026 - 00:20:33.698, Speaker C: It's always going to be redeemable for a dollar, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. I think the Luna story has a lot of nuance to it. There's definitely a lot to be learned from it. So anyways, that was a collapse of Luna, biggest story of cosmos in 2022, the contagion spread far larger than anyone would have really imagined.
00:20:33.794 - 00:20:53.230, Speaker A: I wonder, actually, don't you feel like after that drop, though, cosmos as an ecosystem continued to be affected by the general market, but that was its shock, and it then sort of leveled out almost, whereas other ecosystems just tumbled one after another, month to month.
00:20:53.300 - 00:21:57.934, Speaker C: It feels like it was a very strange experience in general for me because one of the things, though, that happened is it was like terra collapsed. And I remember just kind of know I was like in a hotel room for a conference in Croatia, kind of like in the validator chat, trying to help people out and just kind of shell shocked by the scale of the collapse. And then was like, went down and floated in the ocean for a while and was like, I wonder if Cosmos is going to come back from this. Is it all like, this is pretty bad? And then, bizarrely, the phone was ringing off the hook. I think the other thing that has to be recognized, though, as a true statement of Cosmos is cosmos has not come back yet, is a thing I would very much say about the truth of Cosmos is we have not come back from the Luna situation. There's a lot of green shoots. There's a lot of things that potentially might represent a true restoration of momentum.
00:21:57.934 - 00:22:38.334, Speaker C: But the actual reality of Cosmos right now is liquidity sucks. Dex volume is a pale shadow of what it once was. Developer numbers are pretty good. There's a lot of people building, but we have not hit a product market fit moment. But I would say the thing I'm most excited about is DYDX chain. Other know I'm very excited about SOm. But the things that we're doing with DYDX, the things we're doing with bringing USDC natively to Cosmos and what's generally happening in the modular celestia roll up ecosystem represent to me like a bunch of things that are very going to be exciting for 2023.
00:22:38.334 - 00:23:12.550, Speaker C: There's a number of kind of dark horses like Kanto and Barrachain and stuff like that. So Cosmos continues to stay weird, interesting stuff continues to happen. To be really satisfied. We need to truly move beyond what happened with Luna in 2023. I think we have about this year to do it. And if it doesn't happen in this year, I think most likely what will happen is the app chain thesis will have been right, but the Cosmos stack will not be the dominant app chain stack.
00:23:12.710 - 00:23:15.178, Speaker A: What will be, though? What could be?
00:23:15.344 - 00:24:04.902, Speaker C: There's so many other players in the app chain thesis world. The optimism stack, which both optimism, like they call it, the op stack is becoming a thing. Starquare is building their own sort of app, like Starquare, Arbitrum, optimism all have app chain SDKs essentially, that are much less mature than the Cosmos SDK. Our OG peer Polkadot is also starting know is finally the pieces are starting to ball together. So I think that there's a lot of stuff, great stuff going on in Cosmos. There's a lot of momentum. I'm on this thing called the Technical Advisory board, which is we're trying to contribute a new strategic focus for Cosmos and we've dodged some bullets.
00:24:04.902 - 00:24:59.978, Speaker C: Like we had this really bad vulnerability called Dragonberry in October that was never exploited and all got patched. My role in this whole story, right, and my honest take on Cosmos is the app chain thesis is starting to make more and more sense to more and more people. It's great to be right eight years later. There is a lot of stuff, there's a lot more things being built, but there is this need for really a strategic focus this year and I think things are pretty well aligned to come together. A lot of the pieces are in place and I'm excited, I'm bullish, I'm working really hard and it's kind of great to see all of these pieces coming together, but we're not there yet. We haven't recovered from terror yet and we won't until and unless some of these pieces really hit.
00:25:00.144 - 00:25:09.454, Speaker A: Can you tell us a little bit about kind of Adam 2.0? Because I know that was an attempt to actually do that. Right. This was a manifesto or something.
00:25:09.572 - 00:25:29.750, Speaker C: Adam 2.0 was a manifesto. One of the things that happened with the whole terra story, right, is Adam really got displaced. So Adam is this token that was launched. It was like one of the first chains launched with Cosmos SDK, but like BNB chain, Adam and Iris all launched roughly at the same time.
00:25:29.900 - 00:25:36.326, Speaker A: It was also one of the first proof of stake, generally. Like, I think Tezos was maybe out before, but Tezos was before us.
00:25:36.428 - 00:25:46.678, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, Tezos was probably the only really legit proof of stake chain to launch before us. But Tezos eventually is now running a variant of tendermint.
00:25:46.854 - 00:25:52.474, Speaker A: Oh, funny. All paths lead to the Cosmos SDK.
00:25:52.522 - 00:26:26.610, Speaker C: I guess all paths lead to Cosmos, right? So the question that comes down to it is, I'm sure Arthur's going to yell at me about this, too, but, yes, it's true. It's true. Tezos is running a variant of tendermint today. So Adam is this token. It was launched for a variety of reasons. We never really had a strong story about what Adam was for in the cosmos ecosystem. It was just like, hey, you participated in the fundraiser, you got this token, you run this network.
00:26:26.610 - 00:26:29.178, Speaker C: Hopefully you guys will figure out what to do with it.
00:26:29.264 - 00:26:53.022, Speaker A: Yeah. And maybe just to note this for listeners like IBC and transfers over IBC, while part of sort of the cosmos effort, none of that is funded. There's no fee associated with that's in atom. Atom as itself still just lives in the hub, although it is one of the main trading partners, I think, over on osmosis, too. Right? It's used for pooling stuff.
00:26:53.076 - 00:27:16.002, Speaker C: I mean, it's amazing to me that you have axor, which is a cosmos SDK chain that enables this bridging, and it bridges between ethereum almost every l two avalanche polka dot collective flow through osmosis on axelar is equal to the amount of flow between atom and osmosis.
00:27:16.066 - 00:27:16.694, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:27:16.812 - 00:28:01.958, Speaker C: So what atom 2.0 was really about trying to create this idea around is what we call the atom economic zone, which is a subset of cosmos, where atom is used for security, where liquid staked atom is a major store of value. And the unfortunate, the main thing that happened with atom 2.0 is Jay sort of resurfaced after having kind of been pretty inactive in the cosmos community. And right after cosmoverse and the announcement of atom 2.0, he led this sort of veto campaign in Cosmos governance against the atom. Now, at the end of the day, the Atom 2.0
00:28:01.958 - 00:28:14.220, Speaker C: proposal was just a signaling proposal. If it had passed, nothing would have happened. If it had been failed, nothing would have happened. So the whole story of it was nothing happened.
00:28:14.830 - 00:28:35.898, Speaker A: I think what it definitely did do is it framed the problem, which I think had maybe been ignored a little bit. I felt like it really brought that to the forefront that what is this asset really for? And how do you actually make sure that it still has some purpose beyond just living within the hub?
00:28:36.074 - 00:29:25.818, Speaker C: Yeah. And so I think Adam was a little bit tabular. It was like this blank slate that various influencers and other people could be like, oh, Adam will be this and tell a story. Adam will be that and tell a story. And I'm glad we did this. I think in the long run, it's going to have been the right thing to do, which is to basically go out and say, like, look, Cosmos can succeed without Adam, if Adam holders are just happy with this world that they are in, because, know, Adam ended up being an important part of the anchor carry trade. Yes, it is currently a big part of the osmosis trading sort of ecosystem, but it seems like only a matter of time before that reality is eliminated.
00:29:25.818 - 00:30:09.200, Speaker C: Native USDC was announced at the same time, at the same event as Adam 2.0. I think it's like, without a doubt, it is only a matter of time before the current role of Adam in the ecosystem is displaced. And if that happens again, the network can succeed, the technologies can succeed, IBC can succeed. But it was basically a bunch of people who decided, we are going to frame the problem and propose a solution. But the thing that it has sort of created is this. There is sort of a sense of warring camps right now in Cosmos. I would say most of the people who worked on Atom 2.0
00:30:09.200 - 00:30:41.306, Speaker C: have shifted their attention elsewhere. So one thing that then happened is the Cosmos hub has always had a very small community pool relative to the other cosmos chains. Many cosmos chains have 1020, 30% of the token supply in this governance controlled treasury. And the atom treasury was, it's a $3.5 billion chain. And at the time, it typically has a treasury around like ten or $15 million. Right.
00:30:41.306 - 00:30:44.506, Speaker C: So not enough money to actually really do anything.
00:30:44.608 - 00:30:45.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:45.232 - 00:31:43.120, Speaker C: And so one thing that did happen is a governance proposal was passed to redirect more emissions to the community pool. And now there are some governance proposals out about setting up grants programs and how to spend them. There's a lot of discussion around atom economic zone, and it continues, and it remains to be seen the atom token can overcome its problems or whether or not. Another thing in Cosmos displaces it. But I think the best outcome, obviously, would be some effective piece of the atom economic zone. Thesis gets realized, Adam becomes a more effective means of carrying the message of cosmos out in the community. And Adam can be a sort of foundational asset that bootstraps all of our other ecosystem players, injective and secret and agoric and all of these other things to success.
00:31:43.490 - 00:31:45.950, Speaker A: Cool. Well, this is a great recap.
00:31:46.930 - 00:32:04.046, Speaker C: That's been the drama of my life for the last two years, since I was last on a collapse of a $40 billion ecosystem, a few billion dollar vulnerabilities mitigated. It's just another day in my life, just chilling.
00:32:04.158 - 00:32:22.458, Speaker A: Let's talk now about the project that you co founded, sommelier, and how that's going, because the last episode you were on was all about the Stargate upgrade, the one before that was all about Sommelier. You've changed a lot. I think that project has pivoted quite a bit as well.
00:32:22.624 - 00:32:39.418, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, so, in many ways, Somilia is a system by which we offer actively managed defi strategies. And what we do is we do this through a combination of a cosmos chain and Ethereum smart contracts.
00:32:39.514 - 00:32:45.730, Speaker A: Would you say it was inspired by yearn? Was it like, when you talk about strategies and vaults? Is it similar?
00:32:45.880 - 00:33:48.230, Speaker C: Okay, so, as we kind of pivot this conversation, we're talking reference the first episode of the year, which know you, Tarun, Kobe, Guillermo, talking about the sort of different kinds of asset classes and all of this. You know, we definitely stand under shoulders of giants like urine. But one of the things that urine has never been able to figure out how to do is to have a truly dynamic strategy, I. E. A strategy that adapts to market conditions. Because the thing that happens with all financial strategies and Defi strategies in general is they work, and then markets change, and then they don't produce good returns anymore. With the design of sommelier that I came up with, my co founders with, is we basically use the cosmos chain as, like, a coordination and governance layer to basically, hey, you can have an actively managed strategy, but there's actually a mechanism by which someone else can step in if that strategist disappears.
00:33:48.230 - 00:34:24.180, Speaker C: The vision of this was always to really enable complex defi applications. We launched the first sommelier strategy right after Terra blew up. Oh, man, that was annoying. We've had a tough time with strategies, right? So it was a stablecoin yield product on top of Ave. So that was the first thing. Then we launched these portfolio management strategies later in the year. But then FTX blew up and the markets were down only.
00:34:24.180 - 00:34:37.270, Speaker C: So today we are recording this on January 26. So January 25, we launched a new stablecoin yield strategy, which I'm honestly, hopefully nothing else will explode.
00:34:38.970 - 00:34:47.446, Speaker A: It's like how if Tarunes in Mexico, something crashes for you, it's if Somalia is about to release a strategy. Hopefully not this time around.
00:34:47.548 - 00:35:32.134, Speaker C: But yeah, I mean, it's actually been good if you actually look at the data for sommelier. So TVLs have been not what we've been hoping for. To be very straightforward, there's about $2 million being managed by sommelier. It's not super great, but if you look at our strategies, our ETH bitcoin strategies are up by 20 30% now our portfolio management strategy is starting to be really profitable. This new yield strategy that we just launched is the first strategy that composes Ave lending, compound lending, and Univ. Three LP into a single vault. We're the first people to do that.
00:35:32.134 - 00:36:43.646, Speaker C: And what our numerical analysis, and totally validated by the first day in production, is more than 50% of the available stablecoin yield on Ethereum is optimizing your univ. Three positions, and no one else is doing that in a decentralized setting. And that's built on top of a technology that has taken us almost a year to build, which hats off to crispy mangoes and Kevin Kennes from our smart contract team for dreaming all of this into existence. What similia is built on is one, is we built this governance layer on top of cosmos, which allows for off chain strategists who have proprietary alpha, to communicate with the decentralized network and get decentralized execution of these trades. But we also have built essentially like a full blown fund accounting platform, essentially in an ethereum smart contract so you can enter in withdrawals. We do nav computations like net asset value computations. We figure out the asset, and now with this latest platform that the new yield product is built up, we can combine any DeFi protocols on Ethereum into that nav calculation system.
00:36:43.646 - 00:37:16.230, Speaker C: It's honestly super exciting. I really believe that. We call it real yield. USD is the most state of the art yield protocol on Ethereum, and so I'm super excited about it. About a half a million dollars came in over the last 24 hours. People don't really know about it, but I'm really hoping we're going to be able to really flex some numbers. My tiny preview of flexing that number was that our univ three fees on the first day were so large that if you annualized them over the year, it would have been an 8% yield.
00:37:16.230 - 00:37:36.986, Speaker C: It's real cool. I think I'm excited about being able to flex this stuff. It's really exciting. And this kind of loops back to the cosmos thing, which is cosmos was really driven in 2022 by airdrops. Hyperinflationary staking rewards. Like, lots of just, like, money printing. Like, everywhere you go, just like money printing everywhere.
00:37:36.986 - 00:38:02.258, Speaker C: And that's another big problem in cosmos that we have to get past. So sommelier is a fixed supply token. There's only 500 million. We're launching non inflationary staking rewards soon. I'm, like, hoping for, like, it's like a week or two out. Yeah. So we're going to be powering our staking rewards, both fees from things like real yield USD, and then we're also going to be pulling from the community pool.
00:38:02.258 - 00:38:08.326, Speaker C: But we're not printing tokens out of thin air. There's 500 million som, and that's how much som there is.
00:38:08.428 - 00:38:29.198, Speaker A: Just to kind of, like, recap, though, when I had first heard about it, I always thought of it as very cosmos native. It's like, built on the Cosmos SDK and the cosmos ecosystem tradable within. IBC enabled the token. But all of these strategies live on, or it seems like you're pointing at Ethereum more.
00:38:29.364 - 00:39:03.462, Speaker C: The next chains that we're going to launch on are other EVMs. So arbitram, February. Sometime in February, we'll be on Arbitrum and avalanche as well. I would say that the biggest reason for this is all of these things are related, right? Is like Cosmos Defi has been very immature relative to the EVM and Solana Defi ecosystems. Cosmos Defi has basically meant Dexes. That's what it's meant. We've had a lot of Dexs, and we have more Dexes coming, and we have a lot of Dex.
00:39:03.526 - 00:39:21.230, Speaker A: Is it just like years? It launched long after Ethereum launched, and Ethereum just needed x amount of years to start getting the sort of confidence where more money could be put into it by larger players. Is that possibly why it feels immature?
00:39:21.650 - 00:39:51.740, Speaker C: There are a couple of missing pieces. One missing piece is the liquidity piece. Lack of on ramps, lack of easy way to get funds in and out of cosmos. And that's definitely a challenge. You take the example of sommelier. So we do these nav calculations when people are adding funds by being on single chain, and even when we do arbitram and osmosis or arbitram and avalanche. We're still going to be single chain on those two.
00:39:51.740 - 00:40:50.534, Speaker C: We're going to have sellers on multiple chains, but each seller will be self contained because you can do all of the Nav computations atomically on Ethereum as people add funds and remove funds, right? So you can do all that accounting. It all happens atomically in a smart contract when you build these things in a sort of multi chain world, whether it's cosmos or anything else. Now you're introducing these cues because you can't atomically calculate nav. So you're like, you would like to add money? Okay, at this time, we will finish our Nav calculations and then give you your LP shares based on our Nav computations. And the same thing will be true when you exit. So why is Somilia so focused on Ethereum defi? Two things. One is I really, really, truly believe that active management is like decentralized active management.
00:40:50.534 - 00:41:14.334, Speaker C: And on chain asset managers are like a key primitive that we have to get, right? Because right now, the DeFi version of be your own bank is like really legit. Be your own bank. I. E. Be the back office, be the front office, be a bank. Do everything yourself and nobody will. This is not a sustainable strategy.
00:41:14.334 - 00:41:51.134, Speaker C: Right? Sitting there and hand optimizing your tick ranges on Univ three is just not a thing that anyone should be doing. This is like, you need a professional. But how do we do that without centralization? Right? So that's the problem. Somalia and the primitives that we see in Ethereum are showing up all over cosmos now we're starting to see money markets. We're starting to see liquid staking, concentrated liquidities coming to osmosis. Like, all of these pieces are coming. And I believe that if we can find product market fit on Ethereum, I'm starting to get excited about the idea.
00:41:51.134 - 00:42:36.046, Speaker C: But the UX that we have focused on building in types of sommelier, which is this, like, instantaneously put your liquidity, instantaneously take your liquidity out. The instant you put your money in, it's earning yield. When you go into real yield USD, it's like the same transaction. Your funds are already in aave like earning yield, and it might get allocated into a tick on Univ. Three or it might get allocated somewhere else. But this experience, whereas in the multi chain world, you are definitely entering in this world where there are like, I put my money into a thing, I might not get what LP share for hours. I want to take my money out of the thing.
00:42:36.046 - 00:43:10.102, Speaker C: I'm not going to get my money for hours. And so that world is a very, very different world than the world that we've built for the sommelier user experience on EVMs. And I think that world is the cosmos world is inevitable. I don't think that this idea that all of DeFi is going to live on one chain and liquidity isn't going to move around and all this stuff seems pretty unlikely at this point. So we're all going to have to build this stuff. But I want to show the power of active management. I want to show what it can do.
00:43:10.102 - 00:43:27.022, Speaker C: It's going to be a lot easier to convince people to put money into these things once the single chain. Primitive, though, there are people like Quasar who are basically building some melia type strategies for cosmos today. And it's going to be interesting to see how that goes.
00:43:27.156 - 00:43:42.626, Speaker A: Do you see yourself switching over, though? Do you imagine that you would also include, if there is mean, obviously, if there are compelling cases, you probably would. But would you even try to instigate compelling cases over in cosmos? Do you still want to?
00:43:42.728 - 00:43:43.970, Speaker C: Yeah, we do.
00:43:44.040 - 00:43:44.706, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:44.888 - 00:44:29.650, Speaker C: We think a lot about it, but there's still a lot of pieces. Right. If we wanted to, we could launch a thing on top of osmosis, for instance, later in the year, once concentrated liquidity and all are sort of implemented, that looks a lot like the kinds of sellers that we're running on Ethereum, but it wouldn't be multi chain. So it's tricky to figure out exactly how we want to do it. The other thing that's absolutely true is, just like the cosmos, it matures slowly and unexpectedly. Like sommelier, we had to build our own bridge because there wasn't any bridge we could use. But there are multiple protocols that are building bridging products for cosmos that would have allowed sommelier to exist without building our own bridge.
00:44:29.990 - 00:44:34.290, Speaker A: But you didn't have it at the time, so you had to kind of build. And now it's catching up.
00:44:34.360 - 00:44:56.838, Speaker C: It's two years later, and this stuff is still in testnet. So it honestly takes some time for these. And maybe these things move more slowly because of just sort of how uncoordinated cosmos can be. But, yeah, these pieces are coming together. But like I said, how to get the queue, like user experience, right, and stuff like that are still big challenges.
00:44:57.014 - 00:45:54.190, Speaker A: I want to shift a little bit to another topic that I wanted to cover in this episode, and that's kind of revisiting. You'd sort of mentioned that episode, the first episode of the year in that episode, we talked about these asset types, and Tarun had this really nice kind of history, and year by year on, what kind of asset types were important. And the funny thing is, after that episode came out, for me, at least literally the day after, everyone around me was, like, real world asset. And I had not actually been in conversations before that moment hearing about it, and we didn't mention it. It was sort of, like, missing from that part of our conversation. You and I have chatted since then, and you mentioned it, and then I was like, oh, man, I think we need to bring it up on the show, so maybe we should define this for folks when we hear people talking about this. What is it? Is it the same thing we saw in 2017?
00:45:55.010 - 00:46:29.074, Speaker C: Okay, so just to sort of summarize a little bit about what I remember from the first episode of the year was Tarun was making this point where he was like, every kind of sort of bear market era of crypto always gets defined by, like. So first there was bitcoin. Then there was the bitcoin fork era. Then there was the ERC 20 era and the 2017 IcO boom. Then there was, like, the Alt L1 staking coin era kind of around, like, cosmos, polka dot tezos, all launching. Then there was, like, uniswap LP shares.
00:46:29.202 - 00:46:31.526, Speaker A: NFTs get introduced somewhere in there.
00:46:31.628 - 00:47:06.434, Speaker C: NFTs which hang around are around even in 2017, suddenly find their moment. And so two things that are kind of true, right? Is, like, every time an asset class takes off in the crypto ecosystem, there's something that looks a lot like it that existed before that didn't take off, I think is, like, one thing. So, like, ERC 20 has had their preexisting things called colored coins, which no one was interested in. ERc 20 takes off, and then ERc 20 blows up. So that has been a pattern. But there's also. There's this.
00:47:06.434 - 00:47:24.746, Speaker C: Like, it's just like everybody says, this time is different. And groans, right? Like, the groan is heard throughout the universe reverberates because I started trying to put real world assets in blockchain in 2014, and I tried real hard at it for three years.
00:47:24.928 - 00:47:29.980, Speaker A: This is going back to your story, right? This is the beginning of the story. What was the name of the project?
00:47:30.510 - 00:48:10.694, Speaker C: Sku chain around. Okay, still around, still in business. Hasn't died. Actually has high profile customers like Apple and stuff like that who use parts of its stack. But let's first talk about what we mean by real world assets. So, one, there is a form of real world asset that has had enormous success, which is dollar backed stablecoins. So tether and USDC and the Paxos family of stablecoins, BUSD, are all in the real world asset, collectively represent probably the third largest asset in crypto.
00:48:10.694 - 00:48:53.234, Speaker C: Right? So when we say real world assets, it's like, well, they exist, they're a thing. They're a thing. They're hugely valuable, useful, have achieved enormous product market fitment. But basically you kind of have crypto native assets. Crypto native assets are assets that have no reference to the real world, and their value is just what people are willing to buy and sell. Then you have real world assets which have different properties where they are redeemable, for instance, in some way for assets that exist off chain. And there's a contract that exists between the holder of that asset and some off chain entity that is sort of represented by the on chain asset.
00:48:53.234 - 00:49:06.966, Speaker C: So if you hold USDC, you have a contractual relationship with center and circle, and you are able to redeem that USDC, or you are able to potentially trade to someone who can redeem with that same thing. Is true with tether.
00:49:07.078 - 00:49:18.046, Speaker A: Would you add things like the supply chain management projects into the real world asset class? By the way, I stumble on this R1 world assets. There, said it.
00:49:18.148 - 00:50:01.134, Speaker C: Yeah. And again, we continue to be, as a blockchain, as a community, terrible at naming our thing RWA. Now we're calling them Rwas, which is just going to be endlessly confusing too. What I would describe it is crypto native assets are counterpartyless assets. They're assets where your own only counterparty is the decentralized blockchain system. So you're both settling and trading sometimes and lending and borrowing in Defi, which makes the intermediary native to the blockchain. But then your only counterparty is the blockchain itself.
00:50:01.134 - 00:50:09.486, Speaker C: NFTs have definitely blurred this line already because you get a board ape and you get invited to parties and stuff like that.
00:50:09.588 - 00:50:10.986, Speaker A: You get experiences.
00:50:11.098 - 00:50:16.066, Speaker C: There are experiences and contractual rights and stuff like that that get wrapped up in it already.
00:50:16.248 - 00:50:16.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:17.080 - 00:50:58.090, Speaker C: And RWAs are a more explicit form of that, where the thing that you have formatted and are trading on a blockchain, there is a defined, there's a counterparty that is off chain that your thing you are trading on a blockchain represents a right to that's real world assets in like supply chain, off chain lending, debt protocols. So one thing that is cool, and the best argument for it this time is different, is previous generations of real world asset products all were basically living in highly self contained sandboxed ecosystems, like SKU chain did the first cross border trade on a blockchain.
00:50:58.170 - 00:51:06.050, Speaker A: There was like, real estate where there would be like, you'd have tokenized portion of a house. I remember that being like an earlier one.
00:51:06.200 - 00:51:22.358, Speaker C: But all of this stuff tended to exist in very minuscule pilot projects or highly sandboxed environments, like, not in defi. Interacting with all of the stuff that's happened in smart contracts could build strategies around it. All of the stuff.
00:51:22.444 - 00:51:45.854, Speaker A: You couldn't really get return on it, could you? You were still sort of hoping that the price would go up, or the return was really only from the RWA. Right? So it would have been from. In the real estate case, it would have been like the rent or the increase in price of the actual physical real estate. So the yield didn't look very exciting. In a way, yeah.
00:51:45.972 - 00:52:35.982, Speaker C: Maker has this large treasury of billions of dollars of USDC and Gemini USD, like stablecoins, basically because of the way the parity stability module works. And you actually have real world debt agreements where they are loaning money out of the PSM to go out and interact with off chain counterparties, like actual banks. Society general has taken, like, I think, a $9 million loan out of the PSM and facilitated that. So you have that. There's another protocol called Ondo Finance, which is making a representation of treasury bonds available on chain so they can be held in smart contracts, et cetera. You have maple. They just announced a supply chain finance play.
00:52:35.982 - 00:53:05.302, Speaker C: Centrifuge has about $150,000,000 of real world assets in their ecosystem. So it's like actual money is moving, actual smart contracts are being used. It's happening on actual public chains. And so that's the argument for that. This time is different. It's a very common thing that everyone's saying, right. It's like when treasuries were one, 2%, right, and DFI yields were 810, 1220 percent.
00:53:05.302 - 00:53:33.054, Speaker C: Everyone's like, why do you need real world assets? Like, all we want is crypto native. Now you are having somilier is throwing an enormous amount of advanced technology at Ethereum. We think we can get 4% to 6%, which is like 1% better at best. We think about 1% better than holding a Treasury ETF. Right. Which are like 3.5%. Right.
00:53:33.054 - 00:54:18.186, Speaker C: Now, if you're crypto native, it's not bad, but it's like, oh, okay. I could see why someone might want to in this interest rate environment. Somebody built an ETF on top of treasury bonds that you could participate in on chain. So you kind of like a hybrid of what sommelier is and a traditional exchange traded fund. That would be a kind of thing you could build with our tech, with the sommelier tech and Ondo, or the sommelier tech and maple. You could build essentially like ETFs type things or like hedge fund type things, but are very crypto native, but have these off chain counterparties. This is the kind of technology that we're trying to enable.
00:54:18.186 - 00:54:42.038, Speaker C: This is the zero Knowledge podcast. And one of the things that has been out there is what are the use cases of ZK? And the thing that I would observe about ZK is like, the succinctness property of ZK has been super successful and super dominant, and has facilitated trillions of dollars of trades and stuff like this.
00:54:42.124 - 00:54:50.198, Speaker A: Maybe it's been super impactful as well. The amount of people who touch that part of it is much, much bigger than, say, the privacy part.
00:54:50.284 - 00:55:30.310, Speaker C: Yeah, the privacy part doesn't get touched. And I think one thing I just probably would be a good thing to discuss is there's some possibility that this real world asset thing might scale now. And I think for the reasons that we have, because you could have things like on chain asset managers and stuff like that, which makes on chain assets in general more interesting. But one question that really, I think is a plausible scenario is that ZK and the privacy properties of ZK suddenly find their moment of actual relevance and impact in the presence of real world assets.
00:55:31.050 - 00:55:32.934, Speaker A: Why is that, do you think?
00:55:33.132 - 00:56:12.334, Speaker C: Things that you need a lot more when you're dealing with real world assets is you are representing a contractual right, and you need to kind of know your transaction, know your counterparty, you kind of need to be able to bring a little bit more to the interaction with your counterparty, where you're like, I can prove more things about me. So if real world assets are going to start to scale, the other thing that you care about with the real world asset is you care about some of the properties of that real world asset. So you're like, if I'm buying a portion of the house, what are the houses that? What does this represent? If I'm buying an invoice, who are the parties of this invoice?
00:56:12.382 - 00:56:16.882, Speaker A: And stuff like this, and you start to get deep into business stuff, then this is business.
00:56:16.936 - 00:57:16.134, Speaker C: You get deep into this business stuff. Yeah, but you want to represent some of these things on chain, and you don't want to disclose all of the details of your business. This is always an objection at SKU Chain, right? If the system operated at scale, why would I want to put all of how much I'm paying my suppliers on chain, right? And different counterparties are going to want a different level of diligence and all this stuff. And you do have a garbage in, garbage out problem, which is like ZK is never going to solve. Your problem of is the thing I'm making a zk proof, is the underlying data fraudulent? Which has been a tricky problem to solve. But it doesn't strike me as impossible that we might be able to end up in an ecosystem where there are places that attest and agree on the sound. Counterparties agree on large amounts of data that are like this amount of data.
00:57:16.134 - 00:57:32.710, Speaker C: We all agree that this matches our internal systems, which is like what's happening on SKU chain systems today. And then when you trade this asset on chain, it comes with a zero knowledge proof. It's like, here's the executive summary. Yeah, and here's the zero knowledge proofs.
00:57:32.790 - 00:57:47.220, Speaker A: With the RWAs that you're hearing about. Do they tend to be kind of like the NFT model where they are one to one and they're non fungible, or are they like fungible, like you have a percentage of something that's owned as a whole?
00:57:47.590 - 00:58:29.790, Speaker C: So the maple pools, as I understand them, are sort of fungible systems. They are fungible systems that you have tradable rights to, and you have a credit delegate who's kind of managing the pool. But everybody, it is a collective endeavor, like ondo finance, like treasury bonds, at least for the kind of treasury bond, are fungible with each other. So you have classes of assets you've yet to see. I think really a financialized real world asset NFT thing really take off yet. But it seems like a thing that could happen at any moment. Those pieces of the puzzle, I think, are coming together.
00:58:29.790 - 00:58:52.278, Speaker C: And the ZK tooling is definitely getting to the point now where I want to attach proofs to an NFT. Instead of some counterparty permissioning me into the pool, there's some list of people, and if they give me a zero knowledge proof, I can enter and start trading against these counterparties. That world is kind of a thing. That is, the pieces are there.
00:58:52.444 - 00:59:10.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say it's still in this fun experimental phase in a lot of ways where it doesn't seem like businesses have been built around them. I mean, businesses have been built to build those tools, but they're not necessarily yet being incorporated into true business practice.
00:59:10.182 - 00:59:59.260, Speaker C: I think that represents probably the frontier that it just seems like it's honestly about to break down. And I don't know. When I decided that public chains and crypto native assets were where I wanted to focus in 2017, it wasn't because I believed that the real world asset thesis that I'd start out with was wrong. I believed it was wrong. I just realized that the public chain technology had to mature a whole bunch, and then it would be compelling that starting with real world assets was not the right place to start. Immediately after the FTX meltdown, I was very surprised to hear smart people start telling me real world assets. And I was like, my initial reaction was grown, I can't believe we're doing this.
00:59:59.260 - 01:00:29.314, Speaker C: This. I remember how much it sucked, but then I'm like, keep talking to people. Keep having conversations that go places. People keep showing real world transactions, actual legal structures, actual money moving. And I start seeing how all the pieces will fit together, and I'm like, we have the pieces now. We have scalable, fast, interoperable public blockchains. We have defi primitives that are actually battle tested.
01:00:29.314 - 01:01:02.720, Speaker C: We have on chain asset management primitives. We have custody. We have all of the things to actually make this work. And the speculative fervor has died down. So people are like, well, we have to build things that are actually useful, and we might be in the. We might be at the cusp of something transformative. I remember the first time Iran and Ellie presented zero cash at my tiny little meetup in Mountain View.
01:01:02.720 - 01:01:35.900, Speaker C: That was kind of what I was thinking when I saw that, I was, you know, we are trying to build this supply chain blockchain thing. People have enormous concerns about revealing all of their data on chain. That makes them very nervous. But these people have shown me this magic math that lets you have both soundness of information, of computation and privacy. And it seems like we could do it, but now you have programming languages for it, and all of this stuff is coming together. So maybe this time is different.
01:01:38.110 - 01:01:44.462, Speaker A: Maybe that's a good point to wrap on. I feel like your story has come sort of full circle with it, so. Yeah, thanks.
01:01:44.596 - 01:01:55.630, Speaker C: Yeah. I was not expecting to sell the story of the last two years of my life on this podcast. It was incredibly enjoyable. It all does fit together, right?
01:01:55.700 - 01:02:09.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it's quite a narrative. I like that. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. And I want to say a big thank you to the podcast team. Tanya, Henrik, Rachel, Adam, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.
