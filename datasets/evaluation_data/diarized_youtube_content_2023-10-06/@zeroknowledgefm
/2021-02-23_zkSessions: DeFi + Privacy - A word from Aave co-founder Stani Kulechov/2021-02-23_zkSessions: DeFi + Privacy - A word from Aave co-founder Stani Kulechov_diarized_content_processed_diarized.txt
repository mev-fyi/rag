00:00:02.550 - 00:00:25.740, Speaker A: You. I want to sort of throw it over to Stani so that you can say a few words. I think actually you have a ten minute block. We're backed up a little bit, but hopefully people are here, hopefully they're able to enjoy it. I'm going to take a little moment to go check in on. Hop in and anyone chatting, but take it away, Stani, I think you. Perfect.
00:00:26.190 - 00:00:43.750, Speaker B: All right, thank. I mean, happy to be here. I'm Stani Klechov. I'm the founder and CEO of Ave. So Ave is basically a protocol.
00:00:48.580 - 00:00:52.496, Speaker A: Everyone's muted, at least if they start just spamming the chat. Sorry.
00:00:52.678 - 00:01:48.800, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. We have wasted a lot of time, a lot of issues, but it's Monday and so forth. We basically are building DeFi related protocols, financial protocols. And one of the issues in DeFi at the moment is that we're transacting more and more on chain over time. And practically what kind of issues this creates is that all of the users, you have this amazing network of transparency on financial markets, which is very efficient, it allows a lot of interesting things to be built, risk assessment tools and so forth. But one of the issues is that we're seeing how people are transacting and this is something a bit new compared in this scale, compared to traditional finance and why privacy is interesting field for Ave.
00:01:48.800 - 00:03:04.430, Speaker B: We're not trying to solve privacy by ourselves internally because our goal is to create open, transparent markets. But what's important for DeFi and for the Ave protocol is that there is a layer of privacy involved, especially that we are transacting more on chain. And that is why we are practically here and especially want to discuss about how privacy and why it's important in decentralized finance. And there was recently global market make hackathon and there was actually one interesting hack called Hush hush which implemented this tornado cash style of zero knowledge proofs to be able to withdraw from the protocol either deposit or borrowings without actually kind of like with retaining your privacy in a very similar tornado cash style. But this is like a short presentation. I think we have lost a bit of time and I don't want to do too big of a presentation and most of you pretty much know, so I'm just going to go too deep dive and to save some time.
00:03:05.280 - 00:03:26.672, Speaker A: Thanks for that. And thank you so much for joining the event. We're actually going to see Stani again. Hopefully later we can do this panel conversation that we to. I'm trying to work on hoppin'at, the same time, but if we're going to do it here, then we're gonna do it here. But thanks again, Stani. And thanks for helping with the zoom whack a mole.
00:03:26.672 - 00:03:29.040, Speaker A: Somebody just said that in the chat. I thought that was pretty accurate.
