00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.714, Speaker A: So I guess the first question, Barry, in general, what is a rollup and why do we need it? Right? So a rollup is a way to scale blockchain and we need it because we need to because blockchains are really the amount of transactions they include is quite low. And then every time we make a new block we have a state transition. And the way that blockchains work is that this state transition is validated by all of the nodes. But the problem is that we have many. When we have a state transition and we have many users to check we want to make the state transition as simple as possible so that we maximize the number of users that can check. What we do with roll up is we want to put a million transactions into a plan. So with a roll up we have the same situation but instead of having everybody check we have something that guarantees the validity.
00:00:47.714 - 00:00:51.050, Speaker A: This can be a ZKP or it can be a problem proof.
