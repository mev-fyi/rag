00:00:05.450 - 00:00:37.894, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. You so we're back. This is our first episode of 2023, and our first after a three week hiatus. Very nice to be back here. I hope you've had a little bit of a break.
00:00:37.894 - 00:01:11.614, Speaker A: Yeah, so this week's episode we will be wrapping up our 2022 wrap up with a little catch up since our last episode, and we're also doing a look forward into 2023. I'd say like most of the episode is really about ZK use cases. We sort of explore areas where we think there might be some ZK activity. We also check in on kind of where certain use cases are at. Yeah, and I hope you like it. Before we kick off, I do want to let you know that there is an upcoming ZK summit nine. It's happening on April 4 in Lisbon.
00:01:11.614 - 00:01:48.110, Speaker A: I'm very excited to once again invite some of the best researchers and practitioners in this space to present new research, new ideas, implementations. It should be a really good time. We're also going to be doing a hackathon around this time, so keep an eye on our Twitter or telegram channels for more info. I've added the link to apply for the summit in the show notes tickets are always limited and it's always better if you go through the application process early. You have a better chance of getting a ticket that way. So be sure to sign up soon and hope to see you there. And now Tanya will share a little bit about this week's sponsors, RisC Zero and Anoma.
00:01:48.610 - 00:02:20.198, Speaker B: Ever wish you could use existing rust libraries in ZK? A friendly reminder from the team at Risczero that you can things like proof of Checkmate, blinded proof of password complexity, and even proving things like protobuffs are straightforward when you can use existing code. To learn more, check out the Risk Zero video tutorials from the last zkhack@YouTube.com. At RisC Zero, that's R-I-S-C-Z-E-R-O. You can also follow them on Twitter at risc Zero to make sure you don't miss their upcoming 10 launch and the alpha launch of the Bonsai network.
00:02:20.294 - 00:02:20.954, Speaker A: So thanks again.
00:02:20.992 - 00:03:13.462, Speaker B: Risk Zero Anoma's first fractal instance, Namada, is launching soon. Nemada is a proof of stake l one for interchain asset agnostic privacy Nomada natively interoperates with fast finality chains via IBC and with Ethereum via a trustless two way bridge. For privacy, Nemada deploys an upgraded version of the multi asset shielded pool circuit, otherwise known as MAsP, which allows all assets, fungible and non fungible, to share a common shielded set. This way, transferring a cryptokitty is indistinguishable from transferring eth, Dai, atom, Osmo, Nom, Nemata's native asset, or any other asset on Nemata. The Masp circuit's latest update enables shielded set rewards directly in the shielded set, a novel feature that funds privacy as a public good. Visit Namata. Net for more information and join the community on Discord via Slash Namada so thanks again, anoma.
00:03:13.462 - 00:03:15.450, Speaker B: And now here's our episode.
00:03:18.910 - 00:03:26.206, Speaker A: So I want to welcome back to the show my awesome, sometimes co hosts, Tarun, Guillermo, and Kobe. Welcome.
00:03:26.308 - 00:03:27.054, Speaker C: What up?
00:03:27.172 - 00:03:28.190, Speaker D: Nice to be here.
00:03:28.260 - 00:04:16.894, Speaker A: A quick note, Kobe did let us know that he might have to bounce off this one early, but in the meantime I hope we can cover some really good ground on ZK use cases basically, I want to use this episode to talk about what is exciting in ZK and what might be coming next. This is our look forward part of the wrap up episode that we started last month. So maybe before we jump into the future stuff, let's get a quick recap of what actually happened since we last spoke. So we recorded our last episode on December twelveth. I think in it we were even talking about SBF going to jail or not going to jail that day after we recorded he was arrested. And then at the same time, Tarune, you had mentioned something like, I hope there aren't any more dominoes that can fall before the end of the year. Like there was something else you were kind of worried about for that last 19 days of the year.
00:04:16.894 - 00:04:22.750, Speaker A: I wanted to check in about that. One, what are those? Dominoes. And two, have they fallen?
00:04:23.510 - 00:04:47.000, Speaker E: I guess the last one was the Genesis DCG stuff, which seems to have erupted like last week, where the Vinkalai kind of are like basically saying they're going to sue them and trying to get DCG to fire its founder. So that didn't blow up. But it's not looking like it won't blow up, if that makes sense.
00:04:47.530 - 00:04:51.130, Speaker C: Wow. It's not looking like it won't blow up. What a statement.
00:04:51.550 - 00:05:01.526, Speaker A: But I do wonder, given that this seems to be primarily in the CFI or like crypto intraadfi realm, does this still have an impact on Defi?
00:05:01.718 - 00:05:47.686, Speaker E: Yes and no. I mean, I think a lot of the centralized lenders did actually source liquidity from DeFi or provide it. So there's some sense in which they're still kind of connected, but it probably doesn't really affect it in the long run. I think the bigger thing is just more like net market confidence in decentralized entities that haven't died. If everyone is dying like Domino's, then, and no one survives, then it's sort of like, that would be bad from the perspective of, like, there's no on ramps anymore, but, yeah, I don't think it would have destroyed stuff, but it would have obviously caused a lot of havoc, especially if they have to liquidate private positions and stuff like that. A little bit like FTX caused kind of this huge panic.
00:05:47.878 - 00:06:00.094, Speaker A: Do you think we're still at risk of that then? Yeah. Recording today on January 11. Are we still in a position where something like that can happen in the next month, or do you feel like somehow the worst is behind us?
00:06:00.212 - 00:06:05.940, Speaker E: After the last six months, I don't think I ever can assert that type of claim again.
00:06:08.230 - 00:06:45.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, maybe this is then a good time to switch gears and start talking a little bit more about what's coming up and specifically what's going on in the ZK space. Over the holidays, Kobe and I went on another podcast. We went on Epicenter, and in that we actually covered a lot of ZK use cases. I can add the links to that in the show notes if people want to see the whole thing. But actually, I wanted to start off this, look forward into the new year with sort of a short summary of some of those interesting use cases that we mentioned there. Kobe, I don't know if you want to take it away and start this off.
00:06:45.540 - 00:07:49.358, Speaker D: Yeah, let's talk about some experiments. I think one thing that we're seeing more this year, which we haven't seen before, or I guess last year, is that we see people being able to use the ZK tooling to deploy applications that are user facing and are bit further away from just research or just proof of concepts. So I think we had this cabal application, which was really fun. You could have groups that are pseudonymous in discord and other locations which use ZK membership, which previously, I think the only on chain use case that we had for it was for mixers and anonymous messaging, like in semaphore, but that was a fun one. There was also this cool experiment with recursive snarks, which the first time that was deployed by an independent developer rather than a company like Mina that was deploying it. So you could prove how close you are to Vitalik.
00:07:49.454 - 00:07:51.458, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the EtH DOS project.
00:07:51.624 - 00:08:05.398, Speaker D: So what's your degree of separation like? That's the Eth dos. Yeah. So I have a good number, I think. Yeah, but because I know the developer, that's the only reason I have a good number.
00:08:05.484 - 00:08:05.830, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:05.900 - 00:08:06.470, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:06.620 - 00:08:18.154, Speaker A: It's like a score. You get a score for how close you are. But I actually have always been curious, what's the actual linking point? Like, what's the tool that's linking? Is it GitHub, Twitter, Eth address?
00:08:18.192 - 00:08:18.822, Speaker C: What is the graph?
00:08:18.886 - 00:08:19.482, Speaker A: What is it?
00:08:19.536 - 00:08:41.970, Speaker D: I think basically it's just a signature, because you get a link from someone that they say this link shows that you know the person that sent you the link, and then you generate like a recursive proof that takes the previous proof that is in that link, that shows, okay, this is degree two, and then you can create a new proof of degree three.
00:08:42.040 - 00:08:43.022, Speaker A: And it's private.
00:08:43.086 - 00:08:43.410, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:43.480 - 00:08:44.946, Speaker A: So you know the degree, but you don't know who.
00:08:44.968 - 00:08:46.834, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. You don't know the whole path.
00:08:46.882 - 00:08:55.734, Speaker A: That's interesting. It used to be five degrees from Kevin Bacon. Wasn't that, what, six degrees of Kevin Bacon? Okay, six.
00:08:55.852 - 00:09:02.374, Speaker E: It's kind of a stupid number. The six was not even like the median of the degree distribution.
00:09:02.422 - 00:09:04.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know actually where they came up with it.
00:09:04.128 - 00:09:11.514, Speaker E: I think it just was just like the movie was called that. But it has very little factual basis.
00:09:11.562 - 00:09:14.398, Speaker D: I think in the ZK space it's more like three.
00:09:14.484 - 00:09:15.120, Speaker C: Two.
00:09:15.730 - 00:09:16.880, Speaker D: Okay, fine.
00:09:17.250 - 00:09:33.140, Speaker E: I mean, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, everyone. The diameter of the ZK graph has to be. I would. Pretty small. I feel like the expected diameter of, like, if I did a random walk is less than two.
00:09:34.630 - 00:09:41.350, Speaker C: Yeah. Even in math from Erdos, it's still quite small. Right. It's like six or something. Or seven.
00:09:41.420 - 00:09:44.854, Speaker A: Is that to anyone on the planet or something. What is the.
00:09:45.052 - 00:09:47.954, Speaker C: From mathematicians to this very famous.
00:09:48.082 - 00:10:01.238, Speaker E: Well, I mean, the best version of these is. What was it? Is the Natalie Portman Kevin Bacon eridosh number or whatever, because Natalie Portman has a finite eridosh number. I think it's like three.
00:10:01.424 - 00:10:02.078, Speaker D: Oh, wow.
00:10:02.164 - 00:10:07.070, Speaker E: Something quite low. And then basically like, yeah, nice.
00:10:07.140 - 00:10:46.442, Speaker C: Well, there's the Metallica bacon erdosh number, I think is what it is. Or something like that. And it's like if you've ever put out an album, right? And you probably have a finite Metallica number because you've worked with someone who's worked with someone who's worked with someone who worked on some Metallica album. Then there's a finite bacon number, which means that you starred in a movie or in some piece of media which had someone who had. Someone who had someone who, like, sixfold, who, whatever, wasn't part of the Bacon movie or Kevin Bacon movie, and then so on and so forth for papers as well. So that's the coolest. But unfortunately, I'm still seeking a finite erdosh bacon number.
00:10:46.496 - 00:10:49.770, Speaker E: Wait, you don't have a finite Erdog bacon number?
00:10:49.920 - 00:10:52.282, Speaker C: No, I have a finite Erdog number.
00:10:52.336 - 00:10:54.170, Speaker E: Do you know your number?
00:10:54.320 - 00:10:58.062, Speaker C: I think it's, like, three, actually. I think yours is three, too.
00:10:58.116 - 00:10:59.550, Speaker E: Mine, actually. I think we're both.
00:10:59.620 - 00:11:01.662, Speaker C: Yeah, we're both three for the same reason.
00:11:01.796 - 00:11:08.530, Speaker E: Yeah. Which is. Steven, actually, I have another route to three, but yeah.
00:11:08.680 - 00:11:10.526, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. Oh, that's spicy.
00:11:10.558 - 00:11:18.646, Speaker E: Okay. But it's a funny thing, which means, like, I guess, Guillermo, you got to go become an actor soon.
00:11:18.748 - 00:11:19.910, Speaker C: I know. Clearly.
00:11:21.690 - 00:11:32.858, Speaker E: Very clearly, you're in the wrong career right now. You got to quit, start acting, and figure out how to get close to people who've been in movies with Natalie Portman. It would be cool to have the.
00:11:32.864 - 00:11:35.980, Speaker C: Lowest number, but I think the lowest number is pretty low, actually. It's like four.
00:11:36.670 - 00:12:25.660, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, actually, this is a good question, though. In crypto, maybe there's, like, when social networks first started growing, let's say, even Myspace, like, 2000, mid 2000s, there was a lot of stuff about people trying to be like, how many friends can you really have online? And people were like, oh, there's this limit of 100 or whatever. And then people kept coming with all these different half graph theory, half sociological observation statements of, oh, this is how many friends you should have, or how many degrees of separation you should be. An interesting question is, in the crypto world, how does that different, given the lack of identity? Does that number go down? Does the number go up? Are we going to see these kind of sociological theories for how connected certain addresses should be?
00:12:26.270 - 00:12:33.900, Speaker A: Isn't it sort of weird online because there's also people who have multiple identities you might be friends with, like, three people that are the same person.
00:12:34.610 - 00:13:02.150, Speaker E: Right? That's what I mean. So it's sort of, like, interesting of, like, I guess in Solana, right? Like, the one guy who deployed all the contracts that got used in their defi bull run. I'm sure he has the highest degree, highest connectivity of everyone. He's like, wow, if you ran pagerank on Solana, you probably just get to him. Or anatoly, like, with probability one always star.
00:13:02.300 - 00:13:06.722, Speaker A: All right, let's continue then. Let's keep the new use cases rolling.
00:13:06.786 - 00:13:36.260, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think another cool one that I've seen that I also had fun participating in was this anon thing where they created these Twitter users, I guess, that allow you to tweet if you were part of some known group. So one of the groups that they created was the Dow hack victims, I guess. And yeah, I think I was the only one that tweeted from there. Yeah, I'm de anonymizing myself.
00:13:39.030 - 00:13:40.462, Speaker C: Who posted those tweets.
00:13:40.606 - 00:13:42.660, Speaker A: Hey, Anon was the project.
00:13:43.270 - 00:14:05.594, Speaker D: They have multiple Twitter users for different use cases like Xerox spark participants and dell hack victims and some other. So like, I really like the integration with the real world rather than just being this own chain use cases. So that's what I found fun about all of these three.
00:14:05.792 - 00:14:15.774, Speaker A: Tarun, I want to throw to you. Is there any upcoming ZK projects, experiments that you think have high potential, something maybe to look out for?
00:14:15.892 - 00:15:05.614, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think we talked a little bit about it in the summary of the idea of language models having some form of distributed training or distributed verification. I think we're very far from that. But the fact that people have been able to snark imagenet and snark like medium sized neural nets sort of says we're in a world where people could get this verifiability. And I think if you look at OpenAI or DeepMind, they've hired all these people to do not zk based verifiability like Scott Aronson and stuff, for proving that some content was made by a model or not. And I think fundamentally ZK is going to be the only way to do that. I just don't think that all of these kind of half assed watermark solutions are going to really work.
00:15:05.732 - 00:15:07.280, Speaker C: That's an interesting hot take.
00:15:08.690 - 00:15:36.246, Speaker D: I do want to see how people can reduce the trust in training specifically. I mean, it's not as sexy of a problem, I guess. But if we can get to some situation where it's the same trust as a trusted setup where we can have one honest participant and we can know on what data a model was trained, I think that would be really cool.
00:15:36.348 - 00:15:56.254, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I still am a little confused as what the use cases of verifiable imagenet predictions are. I don't know. Right. Or not predictions, I guess classification is. What is the active use case here for? Like, we have a model, we verify that the output is indeed from that model. What do we do with that.
00:15:56.292 - 00:16:30.262, Speaker E: So I think this idea of the value that people get from social networks, if we try to decompose that value into value they get from content generated by other humans, content generated by purely algorithmic means, and content generated by a combination of the two, roughly speaking, bucket into those three. I think the more scarce that the content that's actually generated by a human gets, the more people value that over time versus, like, the algorithmic content is going to be everywhere.
00:16:30.326 - 00:16:30.794, Speaker C: Sure.
00:16:30.912 - 00:17:23.258, Speaker E: And being able to prove that you're not algorithmic content and or having the algorithmic content forced to verify itself and prove that it is algorithmic will sort of be this thing that makes the real content value go up. Right. It's like the vinyl records, right? Everyone was like, vinyl records are dead. Right. But ironically, they make more money. A lot of record labels make more money from vinyl records than they do from any of their other digital forms of selling stuff because people buy it as merch. And I sort of think content on the Internet will have, that will be the vinyl records, where if you can identify that content was or something was made algorithmically, and it's sort of like a standard that everyone can verify, then suddenly your single origin human created thing becomes just worth a lot more.
00:17:23.258 - 00:17:26.394, Speaker E: Whoa. What are the other fair trade human content?
00:17:26.432 - 00:17:33.100, Speaker C: Fair trade organic, non gmo human content or non computer modified CMO, maybe?
00:17:33.710 - 00:17:43.298, Speaker E: Again, this is all just my opinion, obviously. It's like, I don't know, ask some Sci-Fi author. They probably have a much larger thesis than I do on this.
00:17:43.384 - 00:17:57.794, Speaker C: I'm not fully sure I understand how one would prove the non providence or the provenance of a fake not being from a computer. Right. Fundamentally, that separation feels actually much more difficult to prove than not.
00:17:57.992 - 00:18:08.358, Speaker E: Yeah, but I would say networks can enforce that any algorithmic content generated had to be, has to post some provenance proof in order for it to use their API or something. Right.
00:18:08.524 - 00:18:16.522, Speaker D: I mean, you could always have these open source people create different versions. That doesn't do it. So I don't know.
00:18:16.576 - 00:18:17.754, Speaker C: Yeah, just like repost it.
00:18:17.792 - 00:18:25.754, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. I'm definitely not saying that there's a foolproof way of doing it, but I do believe that there will be this monetary premium.
00:18:25.802 - 00:18:26.158, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:26.244 - 00:18:57.960, Speaker E: In the same way that art gets more valuable when someone commits suicide or they die, or definitely way more when it's suicide versus just normal death. I kind of think this is going to end up being the same thing. And somehow single origin human content might be inferior, might not be as precise, or might not have as much descriptive desert Ada. But for some reason it will be worth more and it'll be like art. It's hard for me to imagine that not happening.
00:18:58.410 - 00:19:08.246, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I believe the general gist. I just don't know if ZK proofs is going to be the way to do it. That's where I diverge.
00:19:08.278 - 00:19:57.626, Speaker E: But the proposals we see a lot of right now are all these statistical watermarking mechanisms. And those things all seem like fine. Having to run the modified version that doesn't need the proof is one thing, but these things that you can actually fool with very simple adversarial models seem like not know. We're just back to this whole know. People in ML have this version of what they think private ML is, and half the time it always gets attacked. And actually we had an episode with Florian, who's a professor at ETH, about exactly this phenomena, which is know, in machine learning there's kind of much less of the notion of privacy so weak, and these watermarking things look exactly the same. So I'm quite nebulous on them.
00:19:57.626 - 00:20:13.518, Speaker E: I think all of those are just so that big companies can tell regulators like, hey, we checked the box, we tried, but I think ZK is the only thing that will actually provide some actual guarantees, not just some sort of like, bullshit. We added noise. Hope it doesn't look like a human.
00:20:13.684 - 00:20:41.606, Speaker A: What do you think this year though? What do you think we could see in that way? Like in the ZKML front? I guess we could see new projects who are trying to do it. Do you think we'll be actually hearing new use cases being proposed? Yeah, I kind of wonder, at least when I talk to other people, they're like, timeframe wise, we might be looking at seven years or something. Like, it might not be a two year, three year type thing, I think.
00:20:41.628 - 00:21:21.426, Speaker D: Related to what Tarun was saying, you have these maybe middle grounds. So for example, what worldcoin is doing, or what we talked about with Dan on epicenter, or actually in our episode as well, where you have signed inputs like either from the orb or from the cameras. So that helps a bit alleviate the worries of adversarial scenarios. So then you can offload or move all the detection models to run on the client side, which is interesting, because then you have privacy against the servers.
00:21:21.538 - 00:21:22.198, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:21:22.364 - 00:21:32.330, Speaker D: And you don't worry as much about adversarial inputs. So that could be an interesting use case that doesn't take too long to deploy.
00:21:32.750 - 00:21:56.450, Speaker A: Maybe actually that time frame was also talking about, because as I learned through that interview with Florian. The difference between inference and model training. So everything we're talking about right now, I think, is the inference side. Right. Using existing models. But then it's the model training. Trying to do that in private would probably take a lot longer.
00:21:56.600 - 00:22:03.874, Speaker E: That is effectively impossible. Yeah, I'm effectively going to just assume that's not going to happen, actually.
00:22:03.912 - 00:22:15.800, Speaker C: There are people, pretty important people in the system, disagree with you, actually. True. I mean, I agree with you, actually, quite a bit. But there was recently a paper that attempted to disagree with you. I think.
00:22:16.650 - 00:22:41.726, Speaker E: I think if you jointly optimize some type of. How big your model is versus how much privacy you want type of thing, maybe. But training is also just like a dark art versus inference. Right. Inference is a very well defined algorithm. It's almost deterministic. Training involves, like, I do batch norm on a random layer, I suddenly truncate a bunch of other things.
00:22:41.726 - 00:22:52.782, Speaker E: There's so much dark art in that stuff that I hesitate to. Even if you were able to prove that you could do it for one model, it'll never scale to the way people build models.
00:22:52.846 - 00:22:59.558, Speaker D: Maybe if you save some seeds and randomness, that could make. We could make some progress, but I'm not sure.
00:22:59.644 - 00:23:03.394, Speaker A: Kobe, I know you have to bounce early, but thanks for those use cases.
00:23:03.522 - 00:23:06.230, Speaker D: Thank you for having me, and good to see you all.
00:23:06.300 - 00:23:11.500, Speaker A: Yes, and excited for our next episodes coming up in the next few weeks.
00:23:11.870 - 00:23:13.222, Speaker C: Catch you later, Kobe.
00:23:13.366 - 00:23:36.574, Speaker A: Thanks, Kobe. So now we'll continue without Kobe. We're going to continue with a couple of use cases. I'm curious if you. I think both of you could probably speak on this, but I don't think we would have talked about this last year, but it was the ZK bridges. Like, we did talk about it in 2022, but I know that that really kind of came into a fore in the last few months. Do you see more things in 2023 around ZK bridges?
00:23:36.702 - 00:24:08.714, Speaker E: I mean, more meaning, like, the people who are working on it will deliver things? Yes. More in the sense of new algorithms, maybe not. I feel like right now, ZK bridging feels like the type of thing where it's like, we have enough of a design space, and now it's about just like, optimizing the code to actually run fast. Right. It's like, proof of stake hit this same stride in late 2018 or mid to late 2018, where it was like, all the ideas are on the table. There's not that much else you're going to do. It's just like, implement them, and then.
00:24:08.752 - 00:24:09.914, Speaker C: You have this make them good.
00:24:09.952 - 00:24:20.974, Speaker E: Couple of years of engineering, it feels more like that than it feels like there's some big, unsolved, mechanistic thing that is out there. I don't know, Guillermo, what do you really?
00:24:21.012 - 00:24:58.394, Speaker C: I don't know. There's certainly some art to it, but for the most part, it's kind of know we have these consensus things we're following, right. Whatever consensus rules following, we need to verify them. I'm sure there's maybe some set of ways that you can make something slightly smaller, slightly larger, but at the end of the day, you're kind of just, like, doing the thing, right? There's not some complicated, difficult, hard elliptic curves question in there? I mean, there might be, but it's pretty unlikely, right? For the most part, it's now more an engineering problem than it is a research problem. Maybe is the which is good.
00:24:58.432 - 00:25:32.418, Speaker E: In a lot of the 2017 boom, stupidity was like everyone and their mom, if they had Chat GPT, they wrote things that sounded like they came out of Chat GPT for describing why their proof of stake mechanism is better, and they had no way of proving why or how or whatever. And I think by mid 2018, it became a lot more clear. There's only a few things you can really do, few ways you can, directions you can make some particular large changes in. And then it was like the teams that had the most capital just went down those roads.
00:25:32.514 - 00:25:56.286, Speaker A: Yeah. I wonder, do you see the ZKVM ZkevM in a similar state as bridges? A lot of the ideas have been quite fleshed out, and now it's about implementation, and the sort of who's going to win is still kind of up for grabs, like, who implements fastest? We don't actually have metrics on a lot of these things yet, because the.
00:25:56.308 - 00:26:33.314, Speaker C: Task is so much more complicated. Large in the space. I do mean, like, large in this weird one. We're kind of doing arbitrary computational one. We're kind of not. There are probably a few more tricks to be played, but I do think it looks much more like engineering than research still. Yeah, I think if there are improvement, like systematic improvements, it'll probably come more from better tooling for ZK in terms of optimization, in terms of whatever, any number of things, then I think they will probably come from really smart, individual optimizations.
00:26:33.314 - 00:26:52.062, Speaker C: So I'd still see that still as more of an engineering, artsy fartsy part of engineering, because it requires some tricks, but still engineering than what is pure research of. Like, let's figure out this general thing that has all these nebulous questions about it.
00:26:52.116 - 00:27:58.754, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, arguably, ZkevM has a bunch of open problems, but they're not theoretical problems about ZK. They're much more just about you. Have you ever seen that meme about what modern software engineering is? And it's like they take a bunch of plugs from different countries and then they stack them until they all interface correctly and they make this monstrosity. It's sort of like that more than it is like, oh, how do I make a new ZK mechanism? I kind of feel like while there is a lot of stuff people are doing on ZK mechanisms, I think more of the actual true research seems to be on the NPC and fhe side. If I'm giving you kind of my stylized view of it, I actually wonder if we'll see more breakthroughs there than in actual ZK. There just seem to be some people who are really plugging away at fhe a little more after the last couple of years, because I feel like there was, like, a little lull and people were pretty down on it and then moved towards ZK.
00:27:58.754 - 00:28:22.446, Speaker E: And I kind of feel like I've met more people who seem to be suddenly thinking a lot more about fhe fully homomorphic encryption. And so I'm not trying to say anything that's like some crazy thing, like, oh, yeah, we'll solve it by next year. But if I were to place lottery ticket style bets on where you would have the research innovation, it's like, in.
00:28:22.468 - 00:29:00.662, Speaker A: That realm, I think in terms of innovation in ZK, what I see happening more and more is, like, use cases for these tools, like what we described earlier, these experiments. It's at the stage where people can actually do that. And so it's true that, yes, there are increment. I think we've actually felt that since 2019. In 2019, there were, like, breakthroughs coming in, and then early 2020, it was like, plonk comes out, and since then, there have been a few milestone breakthroughs. But it definitely got. It was like lots of papers being published, lots of small, interesting, incremental, incremental add ons.
00:29:00.662 - 00:29:07.370, Speaker A: Yeah, but less of that paradigm shifting research coming out. Yeah, I think that makes sense.
00:29:07.520 - 00:29:16.814, Speaker E: That's why my bet is actually that it will come in these things that people are quite negative on but are starting to switch a little bit on or so it seems like.
00:29:16.852 - 00:29:19.230, Speaker A: Just in terms of big research breakthroughs.
00:29:19.570 - 00:29:20.320, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:29:21.090 - 00:29:42.290, Speaker C: I also think the frontier for fhe is quite a bit more open for these breakthroughs than ZK. Maybe there's like another inflection point for ZK. But it does feel like we're very quickly leveling off the low hanging fruit unless someone comes up with some crazy new technique that just opens up a new field. But that seems, as time goes on, more and more unlikely.
00:29:42.370 - 00:30:24.478, Speaker A: I think that's fair, but I want to explore one use case that actually, I think it might have been Guillermo. I think this might have been the first time you came on the show. I think we talked a little bit about this. I think it was the private dexes, the idea of a private deck, what you needed for a dex to be called private, because there's, like, parts that can be made private and other parts that can't. But then can you really keep certain things private if other information is available? I do wonder, just checking back in on that, where are we at with private dexes? Has there been a standard decided on. There's not that many groups doing it? I still think it's pretty wild, Westy.
00:30:24.574 - 00:30:44.374, Speaker C: I think there's some initial answers, for sure, which have interesting, proper, actually, weirdly enough, I guess maybe these sweet describe it is. It's a bit of an open space still. Sure. I mean, that's the obvious way of describing it. But within that, there's like a big spectrum where you trade off fundamentally.
00:30:44.422 - 00:30:45.020, Speaker E: Right.
00:30:45.550 - 00:31:21.906, Speaker C: And I don't know if you recall, I think you're acknowledged in this paper for inspiring it. There exists this funny open space of privacy. Can't really, when we say privacy, we mean specifically like, one cannot reconstruct individual trades just by viewing public data. That's actually a surprisingly difficult thing to achieve. Right. And that's kind of what we outlined there. But that also means that there's kind of, like always a fundamental trade off between kind of how quickly things get executed and at what price they get executed at, like, trades.
00:31:21.906 - 00:31:34.122, Speaker C: I mean, and like, privacy. Right. I think we now have some ideas for certain solutions in the sense of, like, penumbra is one example.
00:31:34.256 - 00:31:34.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:35.168 - 00:31:56.666, Speaker C: Where you have a little bit of this trade off between privacy and what one might call economic efficiency or whatever. But I don't think the trade off has been fully explored. For example, penumbra use a very particular mechanism for how to kind of scramble together trade, so to speak. And it turns out it has kind of interesting properties.
00:31:56.778 - 00:32:14.818, Speaker A: Yeah, we did an interview, we actually could link to that. We did an interview with Henry where we talked a little bit about that particular model. But I do wonder, have you been following that space? Is there any other, are there unanswered questions or models that maybe have been sort of proposed but not explored, not implemented.
00:32:14.994 - 00:32:28.474, Speaker C: There are some, most people see for some reason, the hot thing within privacy turns out to be, I think people call it like RFQs or whatever. Is that what it is?
00:32:28.592 - 00:32:29.238, Speaker E: Terun.
00:32:29.334 - 00:32:36.058, Speaker C: So it's like somehow everyone thinks that a private Dex is solved by making a private RFQ.
00:32:36.154 - 00:32:37.198, Speaker A: What does that stand for?
00:32:37.284 - 00:33:45.460, Speaker E: Request for quotes? So it basically just means, like I say, I want to trade five anacoins for Guillermo coins, and I say, okay, here's how much I want. What's the price? Then the mechanism goes and queries people who are willing to take the other side of that and then gives you the minimum of their thing. So the places where you could make that private and sort of one bad thing that might happen is like, say, you say you want to buy 10% of the Anna coin supply. Well, if I tell the mechanism that, and then they go and ask all the people who want to sell Guillermo coin, they may collude and say like, wow, anna's dumb. She's like selling 10% of this, let's collude to give her a horrible price. Right? That's like one mechanism. So the notions of privacy you need there are, can you submit your trade size privately? But can it be done in such a way that the people who are then providing bids to you can get enough information such that they can give an accurate price? That makes sense.
00:33:45.460 - 00:34:45.282, Speaker E: And in some sense, you have to have privacy on both sides, but also some amount of information that's shared. But it's very like you can analyze each of these components separately, which is why I think people are, people from the privacy lens want to do it. It's a little bit more like over the counter trading, though, than it is trading against an amm. It doesn't feel like continuous trading. Right. It's like there's many interactions, like, you have to go give the amount you want, then it has to go message everyone who's willing to be a liquidity provider, then take those, compute some function of that return to you, then you say you execute, whereas uniswap, it's like a one click, one message type of thing, right? So this communication complexity aspect of these is actually quite important. And I think I haven't seen anyone on the privacy side who's actually focused on the fact that you're reducing the quality of trading by forcing people to have many different rounds of communication.
00:34:45.282 - 00:34:47.510, Speaker E: And what does that cost you?
00:34:47.660 - 00:35:13.598, Speaker C: Right. For some reason, that specific mechanism has been what's been. I've seen some amount of exploration, actually, even that, not that much, but let's say claimed exploration. It's actually shockingly difficult to understand, but kind of on the deck side, there really hasn't been that much more. I haven't really seen that much personally. I don't know exactly why, but I mean, it's fine.
00:35:13.684 - 00:35:21.362, Speaker A: I wonder. Well, I mean, tornado happened and it might have maybe made some people a little bit more cautious to explore that right now.
00:35:21.416 - 00:35:40.730, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. It's just kind of a funny thing because it's a cool open. Know, maybe if you think that penumbra is the end state of private decentralized exchanges, then in that case, surely go work for penumbra or something instead of making your own. But there is an open question of whether there are more interesting mechanisms. I think there are.
00:35:40.880 - 00:36:44.474, Speaker E: I mean, the place I think that's in between these two is sort of like mechanisms that involve sort of like many auctions that are involved. Actually, I'm writing this kind of short paper on this right now, but I was actually trying to study this gradual dutch auction thing. Art Gobbler is gross, disgusting, whatever. I could never imagine liking the art or game. It's kind of gross. But I think the mechanism is actually kind of interesting if you try to understand when it's sort of incentive compatible or not. The current version that the one that art gobblers uses and sort of like Dan Ed Al made is technically not incentive compatible, but there's a way to basically modify and I think once the space of things that are like continuous repeated auctions that you can join and leave whenever you want, and there's sort of some supply.
00:36:44.474 - 00:37:28.634, Speaker E: It's sort of like a middle ground between the pure RFQ, which is like lots of back and forth to do anything, versus the uniswap, like, hey, there's just like continuous trading. And I think that space is actually a place where you can make things a lot more private. But I think you first need to actually flesh out the design space of that. Of like, here are mechanisms that could work, not privately. Here's how they work. Original exponential gradual deduction is like right idea, sort of, but like wrong parameterization and wrong model for the curve. It's sort of like as if I did a uniswap curve that was linear when Uniswap started and it didn't really wasn't able to take off.
00:37:28.634 - 00:38:20.310, Speaker E: I kind of think that GDa has that problem right now. But, yeah, systematically studying that, I think will lead to some private routes. And there's some sense in which the real North Star for private decks should be that there should be some mechanism where trading liquid tokens and nfts should be the same. You just parameterize it differently for both in some way and you can kind of interpolate between the two so that you do kind of like one type of trading vehicle that lets you do everything. And right now you see the Vespers of that, right. It's like Uniswap bought that aggregator and for their NFT exchange it's like mainly an aggregation mechanism. But there's some clear thing where there's a design space prior to making it private that unifies trading these non fungible type of things with liquid tokens.
00:38:20.310 - 00:38:53.400, Speaker E: And then you try to make that thing private. So that's sort of, if I were to give you the two year vision of this, that would be what I would say is missing. And I think part of it is people aren't that interested in building those things when there's not much trading volume. So there's certainly that aspect that you can't ignore. But maybe like Uniswap, someone will in the bear market be bored and interested. And I think that's more likely the thing to look out for. But again, I think the design space needs to be fleshed out.
00:38:53.400 - 00:39:19.246, Speaker E: I think there is some sense in which the North Star shouldn't just be private decks or like private RFQ. It should be like I want to trade nfts and liquid tokens almost in the same way. And that thing, if it works, should be able to be made private. But that might be a lofty goal, right? You have to have kind of the hotspot of believe that that thing can be pilted and whatever.
00:39:19.428 - 00:39:39.474, Speaker A: It sounds actually a little bit like a noma's pitch, but actually I want to know in the larger defi ecosystem, are there any other places where ZK's been incorporated? Even like maybe on the MEV front, is there any sort of place that you do see some sort of incorporation that we haven't seen yet, or you could see?
00:39:39.592 - 00:40:25.910, Speaker C: I don't know, actually, I haven't seen anything. So usually what happens specifically with an MEB is like ZK is kind of used for two things. It's used for privacy and it's for proving the correct execution of something. In the case of MEB, there's often relatively succinct ways of proving the correct execution or the correct solution without actually requiring the full machinery of ZK. So for the most part, within MeV, the real, so to speak, use of ZK is actually more as a privacy tool. Not always, perhaps. I mean, there might be exceptions to this rule, but for the most part it's used as a privacy tool rather than as like a succinct proof tool, a correct execution tool or whatever you want to call it.
00:40:25.910 - 00:40:36.600, Speaker C: Right? Which is distinguished from ZK almost everywhere else where it uses both roughly equal, if not actually more in the succinct side than the privacy side.
00:40:37.130 - 00:41:02.446, Speaker A: So, I mean, one place where it has already been at least proposed is in the voting part. So maybe it won't be in the kind of protocol level like the software level of the actual mechanism, but rather in the voting or governance side of things with voting using something like CLR fund or Macy as private voting. But also this idea of like anonymous multi sigs. You heard about constitution Dow too?
00:41:02.548 - 00:41:08.866, Speaker C: I heard about it. I actually have no idea what know, new and improved version don't actually, I.
00:41:08.888 - 00:41:41.314, Speaker A: Haven'T tracked it, so I don't know where it's at. But I do know that Dan had done work on creating private dows. The idea here would be like specifically in the case of an auction, if you are bidding against other people and you can see exactly how much they have, this is like maybe in a real world auction, it's really hard to sort of win your auction. If yours is visible, it kind of puts you at a disadvantage. And in this way you could actually create sort of a private treasury amount when participating in an auction.
00:41:41.382 - 00:41:41.854, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:41:41.972 - 00:42:05.694, Speaker A: And I don't know if this fully connects to DeFi, but I know voting in general and doing that privately might help. But has that been explored at all? Has there been any kind of major projects that have even worried about it or discussed any sort of privacy in the voting? Or do you almost feel like it's antithetical because you want reputation on the line when you're in those spaces?
00:42:05.742 - 00:42:40.558, Speaker E: Yeah, it's sort of both. Part of it is like the existing ones want the latter. There were certainly some very bad actors of late 2021, early 2022 voting wise. I mean, the easiest example was Wonderland, but there were a ton of other voting malfeasance types of things. Also, the v model kind of distorts that. And we've seen some crazy things like the thing that happened to balancer a few months, a month ago. So I would say people focus way more on the voting mechanics payment side so far.
00:42:40.558 - 00:43:33.630, Speaker E: There's a huge disconnect between real projects that are live and ZK intern projects like at CRX park and stuff where there's like tons of these, like, hey, how do you do private devoting stuff? And I think part of it is just not very robust right now. And also the voting mechanisms, you need some form of credibility that needs to also exist. And actually there, I mean credibility in sort of like a technical sense, which know if the entire Dao was completely private and you're voting whatever. I forget what Phil, Diane likes to call it, dark dows. But I think privacy shouldn't be connotated as light or dark. It's just its own know. Hey, like you'll never know where the money is going to be, where it's going, how things are voted on, whatever.
00:43:33.630 - 00:44:20.640, Speaker E: So can you have any notion that people aren't cheating in that system? There's definitely that in the practical side, I think that's what's keeping it from reality. But I think if there were some set of very good queries where you could prove some state of all the voters in aggregate, that gives you confidence that it wasn't manipulated or like some type of thing, like some aggregate statistic can be monitored, that's public, you might get to that. But yeah, there just hasn't been that much. I think there's this huge divide in that the people on the ZK side are like, oh, yeah, isn't it obvious? Why wouldn't you use this? But they completely ignore the sort of sociopolitical dynamic aspects. And so that kind of, I feel like is why they're separated. Yeah. This constitution too thing I think is probably the only thing that's trying.
00:44:20.640 - 00:44:31.220, Speaker E: I haven't really looked at that hard. I saw some people shilling it on Twitter but didn't. I tried to take an actual vacation and not read any.
00:44:33.110 - 00:44:59.114, Speaker C: What's funny about this is I remember you mentioning constitution. Dow 1.0 was like people like dows learning about adverse selection in real auctions. Right. I actually remember you saying something like, privacy tools are probably going to be more useful for dows at the beginning because they're going to be expensive to use and kind of difficult, annoying than they are for the average Joe or whatever because of this.
00:44:59.232 - 00:45:03.822, Speaker E: Right. But the average DaO participant isn't the average Joe at this point, right?
00:45:03.956 - 00:45:04.750, Speaker C: No, exactly.
00:45:04.900 - 00:45:15.214, Speaker E: So there's sort of this very weird thing of like that daos are democratic, but only democratic for people who understand how to use wallets and block explorer as well. Of course. Yeah.
00:45:15.252 - 00:45:16.014, Speaker C: For sure.
00:45:16.212 - 00:46:03.838, Speaker E: Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, anyone can go learn how to do that. But it's not going to be like everyone, right? Yeah, I mean, I think the other things that are kind of, like, interesting, I mean, the thing I'm still focused on, but again, this is a little bit like this idea of how do you do NFT trading and normal trading all in the same way. MeV auctions also, certainly I still stand by my claim last year that they will be the number one consumer or producer of value using ZK at some point. And when I say ZK there, I'm using it in the venture investor sense of fhe ZK. But I am purposely ignoring SGX because I don't think long term SGX will survive in that.
00:46:03.924 - 00:46:46.270, Speaker A: So I think there are a few more categories in the ZK space that are emerging that we should mention here. One is just to keep an eye on ZK gaming. Dark Forest came out, I think, in 2019 and obviously blazed a trail. But I know that there's still been a lot of experimentation around this, and I'm hoping that we start to see another breakthrough with ZK gaming. Another space to keep an eye on would be ZK social. So this is things like semaphore, private messaging, or trying to rebuild any sort of social network with ZK and some sort of privacy sort of close in proximity to both of those topics would be zkid. This has been proposed for a while, but I actually think this year we're going to see it being used a lot more.
00:46:46.270 - 00:47:15.894, Speaker A: I know that there's a few really key projects like ident three has been working on this for a really long time. There's also a company called Sismo. ZKV is an investor there. Sismo. Every time I see one of their presentations, I kind of understand better how powerful this can be. I'm going to take a step back into what id is usually. So if you think about it like, say you're trying to get a passport or you're trying to get some sort of identity card, usually what you have to do is fill out a form with a ton of information.
00:47:15.894 - 00:48:09.420, Speaker A: Some of that will be used on the card, some of it is actually used by this third party governmental body to prove that you are who you say you are. But once that's proven, it's sort of like it's made private, actually, again, it's not shared further on the card or on the passport. What's on the passport is just your public facing version. And I think when it comes to on chain identity stuff, right now, at least without zkps, it's extremely transparent. So it's like everything you do that adds reputation, it's sort of visible. And say you want to issue a PO app or you want to offer, like, oh, you participated in our airdrop, or you did some action, you're still kind of linking the action with the address that's going to get the reward or certificate or stamp or poap or token or whatever. And so it's extremely public.
00:48:09.420 - 00:49:15.850, Speaker A: What these new projects are offering is a way to kind of cut that link so you can actually prove that you've done something. So like, build reputation, offer all those documents, have your private data, have it somehow kind of checked, but it's not checked by a third party. I'll use the example of Sismo where what they're actually doing is you can prove, for example, that you have a Twitter account that's on a certain list, or you have participated in some sort of protocol, you've done some sort of trade, you've added liquidity, you've taken a loan, you've done some sort of action, and you can then kind of choose to create an attestation. So this, you think, is something that could show reputation. It kind of proves your humanness, maybe your participation in a certain community, but you can actually create it from one location, but send that attestation or badge or in their case, it's like one of those nfts that can't be moved. Soul bound. Love that term.
00:49:15.850 - 00:49:59.094, Speaker A: You basically can put that into another address that you control and then use that to sign things. So it's a really cool idea. And I think with this tool, or with even the concept of such a tool, I think there's a lot of very interesting use cases that could be created around ids, group membership, reputation, and, yeah, I think it sort of takes it up a level. I think it's a really cool case for ZK. Definitely not something I feel very well versed in and something I think I would love to explore more in future episodes. So are there any other use cases you think we've missed on this episode?
00:49:59.222 - 00:50:33.298, Speaker E: I mean, I think the real question is, in this kind of prolonged bear market, what the new types of assets will be that are needed in the next year. Because I feel like each year seems to be punctuated by certain types of assets that are either created or destroyed. 2018. 2019 is like the uniswap, lp share, or c tokens or a tokens. 2020 was probably like vaults, like urine vault. Like the notion of those types of assets.
00:50:33.394 - 00:50:34.082, Speaker A: Strategies.
00:50:34.146 - 00:50:53.630, Speaker E: Yeah, strategies. 2021 was probably just layer ones. I don't even know other types of nfts. 15, 11 55, stuff like that. 2022, who the hell knows? The destruction?
00:50:54.290 - 00:50:57.840, Speaker C: Yeah, the destruction of claims and all associated benefits.
00:50:58.290 - 00:50:59.470, Speaker A: It was the stress test.
00:50:59.540 - 00:51:10.530, Speaker E: So 2023, what type of asset do you predict? I know Anna's default prediction is private asset, but I don't know if this is the year of private assets.
00:51:11.590 - 00:51:16.370, Speaker A: I think my current is like ZK use cases, but I don't know what the tool there is.
00:51:16.520 - 00:51:58.820, Speaker E: Yeah, but one way of rephrasing that question is what asset is important, because that will actually end up kind of dictating what the use case that gets adopted is if you work backwards. So it's like, what does that asset look like? Right. The 2020 innovation was like, you can have actively managed strategies, right? 2019 innovation was like, passive. Everything was passive. 2021 was maybe like, make your own non security security. 2022 was bridges, bridge assets blowing up. Actually, I actually would say synthetic claims across chains not being what they were.
00:51:58.820 - 00:52:33.294, Speaker E: But the bridge asset, in my mind, stands out, whether it's synthetic or native. I feel like anytime anyone tells me these native bridged assets, they never really are when you read the contract because they have some clawback provision or you have to put up some collateral, so you're really holding a portfolio. And so then it's like, it's not really native in the sense of like, I went from ETH to Seoul, I put in etH, I get out Seoul, I never have to think. And then when I go backwards, I get ETH and like a centralized exchange. You don't think about that.
00:52:33.332 - 00:52:33.534, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:33.572 - 00:52:58.934, Speaker E: But in bridges, you still have to spend all this time. I think the native asset bridge is a bit of a LArP so far. At least the contracts don't look like that. Okay, so 2023, let's say there's a new asset type. Maybe it's coming from ZK. What does it look like? Does it look like an NFT? Does it look like a strategy? Does it look like a passive thing? What do you think that would look like?
00:52:59.052 - 00:53:38.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I really don't know how to answer this. I'm so not thinking. I don't have any sense for an asset at all. I'm just going to say the thing I want and the thing I think needs to exist for that to exist. So the thing I'd like to see are ever more ZK use cases. Kind of the creation of more black box, easy to use, out of the box tools, some sort of platform where people can actually build and deploy ZK things in environments which are really, really catered to that. I know that there's a few projects aiming for that, because really, what I want to see by the end of the year is just a ton of really cool experiments.
00:53:38.878 - 00:53:54.870, Speaker A: And I know this does not answer your question, where you're really looking for, like, an ERC something, some sort of token standard, an asset Standard. I don't have that. I think it's really hard to predict what that looks like.
00:53:54.940 - 00:53:55.334, Speaker D: To me.
00:53:55.372 - 00:54:00.250, Speaker E: This is easier than predicting black swans, which was one of your original suggested topics.
00:54:00.670 - 00:54:04.620, Speaker A: Okay, fair. Okay, well, what's yours? Do you have a good one?
00:54:05.070 - 00:55:19.730, Speaker E: I think mine is like, if there is some data structure that exists that allows you to simultaneously store private data, but provide some summary statistics of it, and you can own some notion of a fraction of that, where the private assets are pooled together, but no individual can control them uniformly. But the public statistics are how people have an understanding of what's happening, and you can own a share of that in a world where, in this non existent world, where you could have had a totally private uniswap LP share, in theory, that meets those criteria, right? Where it's like, I have my liquidity. People don't know it's my liquidity, but I also know some public thing. I know the price and I know the price impact. But obviously that has this impossibility theorem. So, okay, let's now try to say what is something like that? Where you can pull together assets privately, but there's some public transparency around the aggregation of those assets, and you can own fractions or trade fractions, right? Like I said, it's not going to look like a DeX LP share. It's going to be something like that.
00:55:19.730 - 00:55:25.782, Speaker E: And whatever that is, I think the first ZK asset will look like that first well used one.
00:55:25.916 - 00:55:46.682, Speaker A: Could this sort of play into that concept of zkid, then, where you do attestations privately to things existing, so there you'd be able to create. It already exists, where they have an attestation badge that can be publicly shared and it reflects something private. I know this is like. I mean, this is usually used for events and stuff like that.
00:55:46.736 - 00:56:40.650, Speaker C: Yeah, it's similar here, I guess, is the point. But here you have more data. So one example is they can have an attestation that indeed, the balance you have is greater than like a million or whatever, or whatever. The amount of token a. Let's say we're talking about like a private LP share, right? You can attest to individual elements of the share let's say it's like you have like ten coins in this LP share. For some reason or another, you can attest to the fact that the LP share in coin three has this much without revealing anything else for the remaining parts of the share. I mean, that's one example, right? You could also imagine if you're collateralizing a debt position using this thing, you could say, based on the current price given by whatever exchange, the total worth of the share is x, but you actually don't know how much individual assets within the share are actually worth.
00:56:40.650 - 00:57:05.878, Speaker C: That's one example. Of course, Turin is talking about a slightly more general data structure than this specific case. That can include maybe other things. But the point is, you can prove kind of like economic or non economic, just like general. This is what I think he means by summary statistics, like statements about the claim. So you can make claims about this thing, you don't know what it is, it's some opaque object. But I can guarantee that its worth is like, whatever.
00:57:05.964 - 00:57:56.190, Speaker E: Yeah, not just worth, it can be attestations about the content, right? Any attestation. But my point is, one interesting thing. If I take the asset of the year of 2020, these are all my of the years, obviously, everyone else can kind of tell me, go fuck off if they want, but if I take the vault. The vault sort of was created out of necessity, because you had d five summer, and there was tons of farming, and you had to manage these portfolios, and it was way easier to manage them in the smart contract than to do it individually in wallets. And then it became a standard over time, like the ERC 4626 standard. And obviously in Salana, they have an equivalent. Realistically, the ETH and Salana ones are the only true vault standards.
00:57:56.190 - 00:58:51.000, Speaker E: I think other networks have them, but they're not extremely standardized of what it means to be a vault. But the existence of a vault was like one of the best developer tools ever. It made it super easy. And you can argue that uniswap v three learned from that, the way it stores things. So there's a sense in which maybe in Zkland, a way to actually get adoption is to invert that thing where you actually make a standard like this, that's like the token standard of how to combine assets and make attestations, and then have those attestations be tied to the minimum, some functions of the composition economically, without revealing a lot. And if that was an easy standard to use, then you could start making these ZK assets, right? And then I haven't seen anyone really try to standard? Because ZK people define making standards unsexy. There's no way of getting around that.
00:58:51.000 - 00:59:18.880, Speaker E: I'm not that type. I don't like the idea of writing specs for standards. It sounds boring, right? But in every programming and open source community, there's always some fraction of the community that is very much like, no, we must only write this type of module in this way, in this language. And here's a spec. And if you don't agree, get out. No pull requests. And they're the quote unquote soup Nazis of every open source community.
00:59:18.880 - 00:59:26.930, Speaker E: And I think ZK could use a little bit of someone like that whipping this type of asset into shape.
00:59:27.510 - 00:59:39.714, Speaker A: I want to explore what you just said quickly, this idea of what needs to be underneath. Do you think there's any work that's come from the bridge work, the roll up work, like basically doing bridges that.
00:59:39.752 - 01:00:01.718, Speaker E: Have to make this? Like the bridges implicitly are making this. And so the question is, like, can you. Yes. Yeah, exactly. And so the question is, can you standardize this so that it can be used in a lot of environments? Because I feel like that would make it a lot easier for a defi developer who doesn't want to learn anything about ZK, but wants to just be able to get some values from this blob that's kept private.
01:00:01.814 - 01:00:02.860, Speaker A: I like this.
01:00:03.310 - 01:00:05.934, Speaker E: That's my prediction for asset of this year.
01:00:06.132 - 01:00:06.542, Speaker A: Cool.
01:00:06.596 - 01:00:15.546, Speaker C: That's a cool one, actually. I mean, it's a little bit general that it feels almost like we are just kind of rehashing what ZK proof is. But I think the standard for Defi.
01:00:15.578 - 01:00:36.598, Speaker E: Development, the way you hold a bridged asset across a bridge, if it was private, not just for succinctness, would basically look like this. Right? You would be like, there's some collateral that's private on the remote side, there's some attestations that that collateral, without leaking its value, is locked correctly, and that you have balances here of this. That's an account tied to that.
01:00:36.684 - 01:00:46.780, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah. But one could imagine making a more general standard that isn't. Here is like generic blob. Here is generic computation that actually is useful and easy to develop for.
01:00:47.230 - 01:00:52.010, Speaker A: We have three minutes. Guillermo, can you give a quick prediction in a short.
01:00:52.080 - 01:01:35.162, Speaker C: Oh, man. Can I give a quick prediction for what kind of asset is going to be like the asset? I've been a little stuck on kind of Meb lately and a few other things that are similar in spirit, but my suspicion is things that are going to happen is one of the things that happen is there's going to be weird future claims for kind of like interchange MeV and interchain arbitrage, and these kinds of things like these weird derivatives, where essentially what you're doing is you bid now for an expected future slot at some point. And I think that's actually going to be like the asset that defines 2023, at least me.
01:01:35.216 - 01:02:34.350, Speaker E: That's probably, honestly, a more realistic prediction in the sense that the Zk one needs all the ZK stuff to work. So it might be like a year or so, but, yeah, that's a very good one in one other respect, which is that almost every MeV on every chain, including eth, like flashbots, is moving the direction of having. There's a word for this that functional programming people like, and I kind of like the word for this, there needs to be some version of this, but there's a thing called a thunk, and a thunk is a way of wrapping deferred computation that you can transfer around. So it's like, let's say I have some deferred computation that's like, find the Nth Fibonacci number, and I give you a little box, Anna. That's like, hey, this thing can compute the Nth Fibonacci number. I've computed the first five, but you have to put in some gas to get the 6th one out. So the idea of the computation exists, but it hasn't been paid for yet.
01:02:34.350 - 01:03:05.574, Speaker E: And it's a very natural way of thinking about these kind of like, MeV future type of things. But, yeah, these cross chain futures and promises definitely, inevitably will have to somehow be assetized. I mean, the most hyped asset right now is like staking derivatives. But I kind of agree that these mev derivatives, or future rights derivatives, like land, right. Those are clearly going to be people already have made them, they just haven't standardized them.
01:03:05.612 - 01:03:19.450, Speaker C: Maybe, but they haven't gone into a public consciousness in the same way that any of the other things. Well, when I say public, I mean, like very esoteric niche and made loving crypto shitcoin degenerates world.
01:03:19.600 - 01:03:30.080, Speaker E: But actually, here's a question, philosophically. Do you think that those will be standardized, or do you think there's actually excess value to not standardizing them because each pair wants.
01:03:33.350 - 01:04:00.022, Speaker C: Certainly at some point, they'll be standardized. I think there will be a right way of doing these futures, but these partial futures, whatever with, you have additional things that you need to do to step through the next point of the state machine. That being said, I think currently there will be some internal strife as to should we not standardize it? Because that means that there's other people will start.
01:04:00.076 - 01:04:02.150, Speaker E: We can break our liquidity.
01:04:02.910 - 01:04:10.410, Speaker C: Exactly. Also, we can break it in whatever way we want in the next iteration. If someone does something and be like, oh, we added this new epic cycle. And that's.
01:04:10.750 - 01:04:22.480, Speaker E: I mean, that's a very good question. That I think next year we should revisit is like, did the bear market cause people like it did with l ones in 2018 2019 to all work together a bit?
01:04:22.850 - 01:04:23.262, Speaker C: Right?
01:04:23.316 - 01:04:28.162, Speaker E: Or will it cause people to be like, no, I don't want you to steal my liquidity. I'm making my own standard.
01:04:28.296 - 01:04:31.154, Speaker A: It does both, I think. But, yeah, we should check in.
01:04:31.192 - 01:04:31.922, Speaker E: That's good.
01:04:32.056 - 01:04:41.426, Speaker A: That sort of wraps up our look across sort of ideas and use cases for ZK. A little bit of a look forward. How are you feeling about 2023? Are you excited?
01:04:41.538 - 01:04:42.182, Speaker E: Hell, yeah.
01:04:42.236 - 01:04:43.874, Speaker C: Well, hopefully. I don't know. I think I'm excited.
01:04:43.922 - 01:04:45.190, Speaker A: Okay. Tarun.
01:04:48.510 - 01:04:50.940, Speaker E: It was good to take a vacation after many years.
01:04:53.390 - 01:04:55.402, Speaker A: Rosier outlook, maybe.
01:04:55.536 - 01:05:15.902, Speaker E: I don't know about Rosier, but I will say during my vacation, I went to Switzerland. I went to zug. And don't worry. Not because I was, like, starting the stiff tongue or something, but I had relatives. But, like, everyone in Switzerland is still positive on, like, all of them were just like. I was like. I was kind of shocked.
01:05:15.902 - 01:05:28.390, Speaker E: But obviously, Switzerland is the wrong place in some ways. It's a very biased sample. This is a country that had bitcoin atms on trains in 2015. Right.
01:05:28.460 - 01:05:33.090, Speaker A: But they're still not benefited. That's the thing. It's like, no minus.
01:05:33.250 - 01:05:44.230, Speaker E: Yeah, but even then, they're still pretty. I was surprised by how positive people were. They were just like, yeah, it's good to have the frauds out early.
01:05:44.380 - 01:05:49.094, Speaker C: I was like, okay, that's one way of looking at it. Cool.
01:05:49.212 - 01:05:51.582, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks to both of you for coming on.
01:05:51.636 - 01:05:52.362, Speaker C: Thank you, Anna.
01:05:52.426 - 01:05:52.942, Speaker E: Thanks.
01:05:53.076 - 01:06:03.210, Speaker A: Thanks to Kobe, who had to leave early. Thanks to the ZK podcast crew, Tanya, Rachel, Henrik, Adam, and to our listeners, thanks for listening.
