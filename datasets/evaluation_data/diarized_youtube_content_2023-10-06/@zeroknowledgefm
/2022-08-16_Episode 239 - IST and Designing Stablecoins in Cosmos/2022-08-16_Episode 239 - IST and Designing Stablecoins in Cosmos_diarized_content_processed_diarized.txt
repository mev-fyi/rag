00:00:05.450 - 00:00:53.898, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. This week I catch up with Zucky from sommelier and Dean from Agorc. We catch up about their respective projects and then explore some major narratives happening in the cosmos ecosystem. Specifically, we recap the UST collapse, fallout and impact on cosmos. We talk about the move of some apps from roll ups to their own app chain, as well as projects looking to be increasingly exposed to IBC, or bridging into the cosmos ecosystem.
00:00:53.898 - 00:01:40.650, Speaker A: Finally, we look at IST, or interstable token, a project being developed by the Agoric team, which is meant to be a cosmos native multi collateral stablecoin. We look at how they are thinking about it, how other projects'successes and failures are influencing its design, as well as the role it hopes to play in the ecosystem. Now, before we kick off, I do want to highlight a new video series that we are launching this summer called the ZK Whiteboard Sessions. It's produced by Zkhack as well as the ZK crew from Polygon. In it hosts Bobin and Brendan interview top experts in the ZK space, exploring the most important concepts and building blocks of ZK. I'm going to add the link to this in the show notes, and it's definitely a great resource to watch out for. We're just starting to release these whiteboard series now, so you might want to check it out.
00:01:40.650 - 00:02:09.602, Speaker A: We also have three introductory videos for the ZK whiteboard series, produced by Dan Bonet from Stanford, so you can already check out a lot of these videos over at Zkhack. One more thing. This September the ZK Summit returns for its 8th edition, and we are bringing it back to Berlin. It's happening during the Berlin blockchain week. Be sure to apply to attend. Spots are limited, so get your application in soon. Now Tanya is going to let you know a little bit about this week's sponsor.
00:02:09.746 - 00:02:40.362, Speaker B: Today's episode is sponsored by Alio. Alio is a new layer, one blockchain that achieves the programmability of Ethereum, the privacy of zcash, and the scalability of a rollup. If you're interested in building private applications, then check out Alio's programming language called Leo. Leo enables noncryptographers to harness the power of ZKPs to deploy decentralized exchanges, hidden information games, regulated stablecoins, and more. Visit leo lang.org to start building.

00:02:55.350 - 00:03:00.646, Speaker A: Today. I'm here with Dean from Agoric and Zaki from sommelier. Welcome to the show, guys.
00:03:00.748 - 00:03:01.846, Speaker C: Thank you for having us.
00:03:01.948 - 00:03:02.966, Speaker D: Great to be here.
00:03:03.068 - 00:03:36.266, Speaker A: I'm very excited to catch up with both of you. One of the reasons that we're doing this episode is to talk a little bit about general kind of cosmos narratives. I wanted to talk to people about the UST fallout from a few months ago, and I felt like the two of you would be fantastic people to talk about this with. And also, we want to touch on sort of a new plan for something called IST. But before we do that, I mean, you're both from different projects. You've both been on the show before, but it's been a few months, and I think we're kind of due for a little check in on what each of you are doing. So let's start with Zucky.
00:03:36.266 - 00:03:37.920, Speaker A: You were actually on the show last.
00:03:38.290 - 00:03:38.966, Speaker D: Yep.
00:03:39.018 - 00:03:49.026, Speaker A: You presented sommelier. I can definitely link to that in the show notes. But you did just tell me before we started recording that a lot has changed. So do tell me what has changed.
00:03:49.218 - 00:04:51.820, Speaker D: So probably the last time we spoke, Somilia was focused on uniswap v three liquidity management. That was kind of our game. What we learned over the course of a few months was that basically any sort of decentralized liquidity management on v three style Dexes is going to lose money outside of a relatively narrow set of use cases around stablecoins and paired assets, like some of the stuff that Arrakis and gelato are doing. It's a relatively narrow set of things. If you are making money on Uniswap V three, you are hedging on centralized venues. There was $200 million of flash liquidity on Uniswap V three in the last year. We basically analyzed the whole Uniswap V three space and came back in December and were like, oh, we are not going to launch this product.
00:04:51.820 - 00:05:23.534, Speaker D: I'm not going to launch this product. I'm not going to launch a product that I am 100% sure people will lose money on. So in the meantime, we had actually been specking out a different set of use cases for Somilia, and we have sort of entirely pivoted to this. And the new use cases are actually probably going to be launched within a week of when this episode goes live. We're looking at like July 20 as our most likely launch date. Everything is done. Chain is upgraded.
00:05:23.534 - 00:05:50.140, Speaker D: Smart contracts are audited. Ui is done. It's really great. So what we decided we really wanted to focus on is this combination off chain computation model or off chain strategy model with validator driven on chain execution. So you have some entity who knows what it is. It could be a program, could be a bot, could be a guy on a keyboard, you have no idea. The system does not define what this is.
00:05:50.140 - 00:06:42.726, Speaker D: Is sending messages to the validators telling them what trades need to be executed on various smart contracts that we call sellers, and then those contracts are executed. So we are initially launching with an Ave stablecoin rebalancing seller, which is just going to go and say, hey, I would like to know which stablecoin I can get the best yield on Ave and just rebalance my funds into it. I don't want to take spot risk, essentially like risk on the appreciation of the asset. Like, here's a list of stablecoins because there's actually quite a bit of volatility between different stablecoins in the lending market. And rebalancing this yourself is like a full time job. So this is the first thing that we're launching. But really what's very cool about sommelier now is that we are a platform, I.
00:06:42.726 - 00:07:09.350, Speaker D: E. You can launch pretty much any seller you want. We have already started onboarding external teams, so we're building sellers on our platform. Really, the only thing that is slowing us down at this point is everybody's like, this sounds really cool. I just want to see money moving through the system. I'm like, I feel the same way. And that's why we're starting out with this very low risk stablecoin seller that it's like, will this make insane amounts of money for any, especially right now? It won't.
00:07:09.350 - 00:07:56.690, Speaker D: Yields will eventually go up. They will. But right now, stablecoin lending yield demand is terrible. But there are actually strategies that we see coming that are really good for kind of a bear market environment. This is a great time to be like, hey, buy St ETH. If the ST ETH discount goes outside of a range, buy ETH when it has moved out of the two week moving average, right on the bottom side, there are strategies that are going to do that are potentially like huge money making strategies, but are like, you need to be a full time trader to really run yourselves. Strategists can provide these strategies on top of sommelier and get this sort of high reliability execution environment.
00:07:56.690 - 00:08:10.970, Speaker D: Like, we have a fully generic platform that can support sort of arbitrary smart contracts and arbitrary strategies today. So, yeah, this is what similia is now is like. We are sort of an arbitrary strategy execution platform.
00:08:11.120 - 00:08:28.622, Speaker A: I mean, you did have that strategy mentality before. I just want to check something, though. Are you primarily still looking to kind of work from the cosmos area, but working over a bridge with Ethereum? Because if you're doing Ave, you're talking about the ETH Ave. Yeah.
00:08:28.676 - 00:09:07.130, Speaker D: The primary place that we're executing right now is Ethereum. We have multi EVM support coming, but it's going to be interesting to see how compelling that is in the bear market to all of the liquidity has retreated to its home on Ethereum. But the general framework that we've built is applicable to cosmos. It's applicable to Ethereum, it's potentially applicable to other chains. We're mostly looking for where economic opportunities arise, because the whole point of this thing is to be able to aggregate significant amounts of capital underneath it.
00:09:07.200 - 00:09:16.222, Speaker A: When you say the word seller, I think we're continuing with the wine metaphor, am I right? It's a C. It's not a seller. Like an S. Yeah, it's a C.
00:09:16.276 - 00:09:18.474, Speaker D: E L l a R, seller.
00:09:18.522 - 00:09:25.482, Speaker A: Okay. And these sellers are strategies. There are contracts that execute strategies, or they're vaults.
00:09:25.546 - 00:09:54.486, Speaker D: They're like comparable to urine vaults or enzyme vaults. Right. But the difference is they have this sort of unique thing, right, where you have off chain strategies. So you have this off chain strategist. The off chain strategist can sort of make discretionary orders. Right. The strategy is not fully on chain, but you also have this validator set that can potentially swap out the strategist.
00:09:54.486 - 00:10:20.846, Speaker D: And so we have this sort of interesting governance dynamic between the strategists, the validators, the Som holders. One of the other things that is just like we're really pushing for is to do a cosmos chain that, where the rewards are not inflationary. Oh, so basically, Som holders and Som validators do not make money until users make that money. And so that has been another big piece of the experiment.
00:10:20.958 - 00:10:23.614, Speaker A: But you have a chain.
00:10:23.662 - 00:10:44.074, Speaker D: Yeah, our chain has been launched for a while. We've even done the seller upgraded, like, I don't know, two months ago. We have been in solidity smart contract audit hell process for a while. And that concluded on Friday. And so now we're just like we're rearing to go.
00:10:44.192 - 00:11:11.954, Speaker A: Very nice. All right, let's switch over to you, Dean. We actually had a conversation about agoric more recently, I believe like this past year, February actually 2022, where you introduced agoric. We talked about hardened Js. I'm also going to link to that in the show notes if people want to find out more. But you have since launched I think, right? Or had you launched then? I think you had not launched then. So tell me what's gone on on your side.
00:11:12.072 - 00:11:52.400, Speaker C: Okay, so Agork is a big platform play that's really important to getting mainstream developers into being able to do smart contracts by enabling smart contracts and hardened JavaScript, as you mentioned. But there are multiple stages to that launch. So last November we launched the layer Zero, the cosmos layer, what we call main net Zero, which allowed the deployment of BLD tokens. It allowed us to do a public sale at the end of December and so forth. But that was phase zero of several. Right. Phase one is the important next step where we launch the hardened JavaScript platform.
00:11:52.400 - 00:13:11.878, Speaker C: And once that's launched, then smart contracts will launch on top of that. And I'll talk a little bit more about that. We'll talk about interprotocol in a little bit. But that's main net one now we're sort of steadily marching towards that with testnets, with a preview release of the bunch of smart contracts and the platform on top of it. So preview release of the interrotocol for other projects. We've got lots of security audits, third party security audits in progress, and we have an economic stress test where economists are testing the economics of and analyzing the economics of the stable token infrastructure, the Amms and the other smart contracts that are critical to the main net one. Now our strategy was always launch a set of contracts that provide a stable economy, right? The platform is build fast, earn fast, rapid development using a modern component architecture of interesting smart contracts and being able to deploy them in a stable, vibrant economy, which to our mind includes having basic trading and having a stable token to grease the wheels of commerce in that economy.
00:13:11.878 - 00:14:44.578, Speaker C: And so all of that launches those first round of contracts launch in main net one targeted later this year, targeted Q three after that is the next couple of stages are permissioned release governance determined release of new smart contracts, of additional smart contracts so that experts building things carefully that go through security audits, they can convince the community that this would in fact enhance the robustness of the environment or enhance the richness of the economy that can get voted in and released in a permission fashion, moving towards through additional security audits, additional metering support, all those kinds of things, to eventually mainnet phase three, which is permissionless. And so we very carefully staged to allow this thing because this is not a, oh my gosh, let's rush out a platform that people can whack together crap. Right? And maybe some of it will stick. This is building a platform that non crypto developers can get into. And if they can build an application now in web two, they could go and build it in web three. And that requires a level of support and tooling and familiarity and training and all these things that they just take time to build. Now, what's really exciting about Mainnet one is it turns out that what we need to launch a stable economy is what the interchange needs for the rapid growth of defi in the interchange.
00:14:44.578 - 00:14:51.470, Speaker C: And so this is the interprrotocol and our stable token for the Agora platform, interprotocol.
00:14:51.570 - 00:14:57.366, Speaker A: Like when you say that, is that the name of the token? Because I've been calling it ist.
00:14:57.558 - 00:15:16.820, Speaker C: Yes, the token is ist for interstable token ist or iced tea. As someone on Twitter, every time I said that, he was envisioning this iced tea. So now I want a glass of iced tea and to have a rapper actor dictate our advertisement. Right.
00:15:17.990 - 00:15:20.174, Speaker A: You didn't think of the drink, you thought of the wrapper.
00:15:20.302 - 00:15:20.980, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:23.750 - 00:15:30.920, Speaker A: Okay. But you keep saying inter, like the other word you're using, interproteocol. What do you mean by that then? Is that just like.
00:15:31.770 - 00:15:58.922, Speaker C: No. So interpretocol is about having a stable token that works across IBC. So it is IBC native, but it is a collection of smart contracts that form the backbone of an economy, basically. So it is a makerdao CDP style vault infrastructure. Right. But you can take assets over IBC. So this becomes a stable token for the interchange.
00:15:58.922 - 00:16:49.530, Speaker C: And that's sort of the thing that has happened with main net one is it goes from being an initial release for this larger platform to being really critical and interesting for enabling economic growth in the interchange. It is a stable token where the assets are not one token on one zone that now you have to care about, but they are community determined set. Starting, for example, with atom, where you could bring atom over IBC, lock it up in a vault, make it collateral to make it collateral. So it becomes collateral that you then mint ist against. And then you can take that iST and you can of course use it on local smart contracts on the agoric platform. But you can also take that over IBC, over to other chains. So over to Som, over to Juno, Osmosis, Evmos, et cetera.
00:16:49.530 - 00:17:14.470, Speaker C: It can become not just a stable token that is usable in the cosmos ecosystem, but because those chains can provide the asset that is the collateral that they're using. It's not that they buy into our chain, it's that I've got a bunch of atom. I can unlock its power by using it as collateral and taking ist back to Adam Crescent, Evmos, et.
00:17:15.530 - 00:17:56.494, Speaker A: I mean, one of the reasons you're here is to definitely talk about this particular topic. But I do think we need to do a little bit of backstory into why this is very relevant today. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the interview or at the beginning of this episode, UST and its collapse. I mean, what I now want to touch on is basically these three narratives that I see kind of like coming. They're very different. The UST fallout and its effect on Cosmos, the sort of movement for applications that were trying out roll ups, and now they're creating their own app chains over on Cosmos. And I'm also learning about a lot of bridge projects or projects trying to bridge to IBC.
00:17:56.494 - 00:18:36.270, Speaker A: So these are like other networks trying to bridge in. Let's kind of rewind to may. I don't think I've talked about this at all on the show, so I'm excited to do it. I always like doing this, by the way. I always love doing recaps rather than trying to report news because then people have digested and they can kind of look at it a little bit more calmly. But I think the two of you were probably looking very closely at this as it happened. UST was the stablecoin on Terra was very, very key in Cosmos because Terra was built on the Cosmos SDK so it was the first stablecoin to really proliferate within the cosmos ecosystem and then had a very dramatic collapse.
00:18:36.270 - 00:18:43.714, Speaker A: That's my quick summary. But Zucky, tell me a little bit about your take. Where were you at when this happened and what did you think was going on?
00:18:43.832 - 00:19:04.634, Speaker D: So I was in Croatia for a conference. Fede was there. It was good. Fede from Evanos was there. And this was going know. It had been know right before that, I had literally been talking to Mike Novogratz about Terra. I had talked to Kanov about know.
00:19:04.634 - 00:19:49.418, Speaker D: I was continuously sort of like, the potential risk about Terra was always, well, but like, what do you really do about it? You also had this problem, which we can come to later, right? Because USDC is coming to Cosmos, all of these things. But bringing USDC, bringing the sort of dollar back stablecoins to Cosmos has always been a challenge because in a bridged environment. Right. How do you implement the blacklists that are sort of core to the theory of compliance on these chains? Right. Part of the reality was, so Terra had been on the Cosmos SDK since, like, mid 2019. Right? So longtime Cosmos SDK user. Right.
00:19:49.418 - 00:19:58.458, Speaker D: So both been part of the ecosystem and not part of the ecosystem. Occlusion was a validator on their network in the early years.
00:19:58.624 - 00:20:00.854, Speaker A: Occlusion is your validator.
00:20:00.902 - 00:20:34.822, Speaker D: Company inclusion is my validator with my partners. And so we had been part of this world we had been paying attention to. We were very familiar with it. We actually wrote an implementation of the terra price oracle, like a bunch of stuff. So we pretty engaged sort of into 2019 and 2020, and then as 2021 sort of rolled on, we got less and less comfortable with kind of where the Terra ecosystem was going. But on the other hand, they had a lot of money, and we were trying to get some money to support Cosmos stuff. Right, okay.
00:20:34.822 - 00:21:29.334, Speaker D: That was one aspect of it, right? Doe had announced this project dawn thing, right, where he was going to allocate $150,000,000 to Cosmos projects and cosmos infrastructure, which was great. And we were trying to figure out, okay, so how do we actually get this money into things that are worthwhile? This was our engagement. Okay, so keeping an eye on Ust and then the other thing that was very. A big thing for Cosmos, right. Is a lot of smarter actors in the space sort of figured out that the best way to do one of the most efficient ways of doing the sort of ust carry trade, where it's like, hey, I'm going to take stablecoins, swap them to ust get my 20% on anchor was to actually route through atom route through atom route through osmosis, go to Terra. Right. And so you actually saw this massive volume.
00:21:29.334 - 00:21:36.550, Speaker D: And the way osmosis sort of does incentives. Right. Is pools that have volume get incentives.
00:21:36.710 - 00:21:39.750, Speaker A: Yeah. From the actual osmosis treasury.
00:21:39.830 - 00:21:40.374, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:40.512 - 00:21:44.842, Speaker A: They are providing extra incentives to those large pools.
00:21:44.906 - 00:22:43.790, Speaker D: So that creates these recursive feedback loop where the pools get bigger because of the volume. The volume is getting bigger because of the anchor incentives. People were like, smart actors were figuring this out. All of this stuff. Was very familiar with all of these things. And then was basically watching the binance order book in real time while they were jump and LFG were trying to keep the peg and watch it collapse, watch it explode. But then the thing that, like, Sunday and Monday were about that, then what happened was there's this famous leaked telegram group that you can see me in for a period of time, and then I leave because basically what happened was I was very familiar, many other cosmos dess were very familiar with the mechanism by which ust gets converted into the, the mechanism of the stablecoin.
00:22:43.790 - 00:23:04.626, Speaker D: Is that at any time? Well, to some limit, but the limits are fairly large. You can convert Luna to Ust by burning Luna and getting Ust, and you convert USt to Luna by burning Ust and getting one dollars worth of Luna. Okay, at some point, sort of Tuesday ish.
00:23:04.738 - 00:23:11.658, Speaker A: So you're talking right around May 20, I'm assuming. I don't know what the days were, but we're going like May 20, I.
00:23:11.664 - 00:24:13.198, Speaker D: Just remembered as this crazy week. So one of the things, though, about this mechanism was there was never any UI for it. You had to use the command line to do it. And so at some point, people who were on the trade realized that they could buy USt on the market, turn it into Luna and sell it as a profit. So this put Luna into this hyperinflationary sort of cycle where the price of Luna kept dropping. The price of UST was kind of actually stable, and people were just like, recycling, were just exiting by dumping Luna on binance and other markets that were forever. And it was like, okay, what is going to happen here? So the cost of taking over the validator set, like, becoming the single validator, we would just watch it fall from like, okay, now it's like $100 million, then an hour later it's like $10 million, then an hour later it's like $100,000.
00:24:13.198 - 00:24:48.658, Speaker D: And you're seeing this collapse, right? And I'm like, guys. So I start tweeting about the potential risks of all of this. Sunny is also in a chat with them. There are a bunch of other cosmos devs. We're like, okay, validators. You have to halt the chain and then restart with staking disabled, because otherwise we have no control over this Luna ust disaster. But there are, like $80 million of non native assets on this chain, primarily like ETH and be and other assets that had been brought over the wormhole bridge.
00:24:48.658 - 00:25:02.006, Speaker D: And we're like, real worried about the next phase of this. Afterhead has become essentially free to take over the chain is some sort of attack on those assets, right? Some sort of ransom on those assets.
00:25:02.198 - 00:25:30.178, Speaker A: So I want to just give a little bit of context, timing wise, to what we're talking about. It looks like I'm just checking it. It was May 2020. May 7 was when it started to Depeg. That's like, I think, what is this? This is a Saturday, and so I'm guessing Zucky, the Tuesday that we're talking about would be around the 10th. And it was that week that you were seeing this. And what you're saying is, at this point, the deeping has fully happened.
00:25:30.178 - 00:25:36.854, Speaker A: It's depegging. There's this automatic sort of liquidation, or, like, the price of Luna is just.
00:25:36.892 - 00:25:51.066, Speaker D: Going, no, it's not automatic. Someone has figured, okay, that there is an arp here, which is, I can take UST, which no one will buy. I can convert it to Luna, which someone will buy.
00:25:51.168 - 00:25:53.642, Speaker A: And that's hard to do. You have to use command line to do it.
00:25:53.696 - 00:26:01.294, Speaker D: You have to use command line. But people started realizing you could do this and started buying UST to do this. Okay, right.
00:26:01.412 - 00:26:08.000, Speaker A: But why wouldn't it repeg USt if they're buying it? Well, because it was dropping, too.
00:26:10.050 - 00:26:31.130, Speaker D: Like, basically the minute any liquidity showed up, and there wasn't infinite Luna liquidity. But a lot of traders were looking at this coin that was worth $100, and they're, like, seeing it for pennies, and they're like, oh, there's an opportunity here. I'll buy this. Not really understanding the mechanism that infinite Luna was being printed.
00:26:31.550 - 00:27:03.250, Speaker C: The key here about being able to take over the validator set is where there might have been a billion tokens before. I don't know how many there were now. It was so cheap, and the mechanic of Luna was such that you could do uncontrolled minting, that someone literally minted trillions. And so now if you could take trillions and stake them, you now have a validator that is a thousand times larger than the entire rest of the network. And so all blocks would go to it. It'll do whatever you want, and you're now in complete control from a protocol point of view.
00:27:03.320 - 00:27:12.082, Speaker A: And what could it do, though? Like you just mentioned, there's all these other tokens on the network itself. Could they have started to just make those tokens land in their wallets?
00:27:12.146 - 00:27:16.102, Speaker C: Exactly. It could just do a vote and vote to give all the money to themselves. Right.
00:27:16.156 - 00:27:16.566, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:16.668 - 00:27:35.950, Speaker C: Transfer on another chain. But they're in control of the endpoint of the bridge, so now they can give all the money to themselves and transfer it off. Know Luna implodes, but their money, as far as ethereum is concerned, or binance or whatever they've been told by Luna it was transferred into the attacker's chain. What are they going to do?
00:27:36.100 - 00:27:41.710, Speaker A: Although there would have been a couple stop gaps there. I can imagine. Like, bridge operators could have maybe done something.
00:27:41.860 - 00:28:01.858, Speaker D: Yeah, it would just have gotten a lot worse. And clearly people in that chat room decided to arb this whole process of halting the chain. Also because somebody decided to arb the process of, oh, I realize this trade is going to stop, right? Because of this chain halt. It was all pretty chaotic.
00:28:01.954 - 00:28:02.358, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:28:02.444 - 00:28:07.800, Speaker D: It's like, basically the most chaotic environment for validators that I think I've ever seen.
00:28:08.250 - 00:28:08.758, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:08.844 - 00:28:12.170, Speaker D: But I wouldn't say that it was like a complete fail. Right.
00:28:12.240 - 00:28:20.154, Speaker A: Okay. It's cool that you were in that group, though. It's kind of crazy that you had that perspective, that you were still running a validator at this point.
00:28:20.192 - 00:28:20.730, Speaker D: No.
00:28:20.880 - 00:28:26.222, Speaker A: Oh, you weren't? Okay. So you were just, like, giving your thoughts, but then you didn't have to turn anything off. But other.
00:28:26.276 - 00:28:41.522, Speaker D: I didn't have to turn anything off. It was just know I'm familiar way the code works. The TfL devs really did not know what to like. This thing is know everything is falling apart. They didn't have, like, a good crisis plan.
00:28:41.576 - 00:28:42.450, Speaker A: They didn't have a plan.
00:28:42.520 - 00:29:11.174, Speaker D: Crisis response was really not happening. So a bunch of Cosmos devs showed up, advocated for a course of action that could be executed quickly. Was it perfect? No. Did it achieve the stated objectives? Were those the right stated objectives? Who knows? But the stated objectives was to create an environment in which people who have foreign assets in smart contracts would be able to extricate their assets from those smart contracts.
00:29:11.222 - 00:29:18.250, Speaker A: Okay, did that happen? I mean, the chain froze. I guess the validator set decided to. Is that what you call it? They just stopped the chain.
00:29:18.330 - 00:29:23.114, Speaker D: They stopped the chain. All the validators stopped. Then there was an IBC stopped.
00:29:23.162 - 00:29:26.850, Speaker A: So the relayers also stopped. Or was that so?
00:29:26.920 - 00:29:39.480, Speaker D: You know, one of the things we put in the chain in the upgrade was close the IBC channels. Okay. Again, who knows if this was the right solution? But it was all under fire. Right?
00:29:40.890 - 00:30:09.850, Speaker A: Do you feel like, I mean, I got the sense that the sort of chaoticness, the intensity of this particular event, that it needs to be dissected and studied in a way, because I think in it, there are lessons. I mean, I think there's the obvious lesson of how to design a stablecoin differently, that that's not a good model. That's dangerous. I think that people kind of already knew that was dangerous.
00:30:09.930 - 00:30:11.854, Speaker C: People already knew this was dangerous. Yes.
00:30:11.972 - 00:30:26.486, Speaker A: Yeah. But then it's also this, like, to see what is a cascade from this. What is the domino effect? What happens after? I think us being able to see it will become useful for the future in design.
00:30:26.588 - 00:30:58.110, Speaker D: I think the other thing that was kind of interesting about this is the way you could construct something that basically functioned as a waterfall credit instrument that does not look like a legacy finance waterfall credit. There's a sense in which this thing was like, oh, Luna as a chain was operating in a conceptually similar space to a mortgage backed security where you have the AA rated Trans 2007 or something.
00:30:58.180 - 00:30:58.558, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:58.644 - 00:31:04.046, Speaker D: And it was like you've constructed a cosmos chain that is the functional equivalent of that system.
00:31:04.148 - 00:31:04.810, Speaker C: Wow.
00:31:04.980 - 00:31:12.722, Speaker A: When you use the word waterfall here, what do you mean? Is it like waterfall of money pouring out of itself or something?
00:31:12.856 - 00:31:34.650, Speaker D: The idea of the system was that essentially in the risk management system, Luna was supposed to be the junior tranche where it was supposed to absorb risk, and the UST was designed to be the senior trash. But if the entire system turns to garbage, Luna fails to absorb the risk.
00:31:35.150 - 00:31:42.240, Speaker A: Could Luna have acted differently? Was there something reckless in the way that it was promoted or how it was?
00:31:43.970 - 00:32:15.186, Speaker D: There's. There are many layers of recklessness in this whole thing. There's the way it was promoted by the centralized exchanges who promoted UST on the same level as other large, more secure, dollar backed stablecoins. There was really no quality filter there. I think it would be wholly ineffective to fight this in Cosmos governance. It would not have worked. But the other mechanism that I would say was a big thing was TfL was reckless.
00:32:15.186 - 00:32:21.946, Speaker D: Right. Withdrawing on that Saturday, you remember, actually.
00:32:22.048 - 00:32:28.838, Speaker A: I'm going to have to recorrect. It was the 7th. I have a graph. It was May 7. So May 7 was a Saturday.
00:32:28.934 - 00:32:40.750, Speaker D: Yeah. So on that Saturday, they withdrew a huge amount of liquidity from the curve pool with the intention of later in the week setting up a new curve pool.
00:32:41.730 - 00:32:49.010, Speaker A: And they communicated that, right, like this was somehow made, or was it just visible on chain or was it actually both? Okay.
00:32:49.080 - 00:33:32.954, Speaker D: Yeah. The setup of the new pool was planned. And the fact that they did this in not like one atomic operation, but over the course of days created a definite moment of maximum instability where all these other forces around instability, the general deleveraging of the space, like the general deleveraging that was going on, the amount to which TfL had sort of burned their own luna to create, UsT swapped into other coins. For various reasons, all of these things had been sort of converging. And that was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back. Or like the Jenga block.
00:33:33.082 - 00:33:41.586, Speaker A: Do you think it was malicious? Do you think that there was someone or a big group that saw the opportunity to crash this out?
00:33:41.688 - 00:34:28.766, Speaker D: I have heard rumors of people raising money to attack UST, so I don't know whether or not those rumors are true. I don't have the slightest idea. But again, the other thing though, that I've heard in general is that a lot of funds had their risk management systems on UST. Sort of go alert them over the weekend that they thought something was wrong and pull liquidity out. Banker sell Luna, like all of this stuff. So it could have been any number of those things, but it was certainly the way in which the three pool to four pool set conversion was. And so I think this is, again, another lesson for blockchain teams.
00:34:28.766 - 00:34:29.042, Speaker D: Right?
00:34:29.096 - 00:34:29.406, Speaker A: Totally.
00:34:29.438 - 00:34:47.430, Speaker D: Is that operating, assuming sort of a non adversarial environment, whether or not the adversary was there or not, but operating as if no one is going to attack you at a publicly broadcast moment of vulnerability is just a recipe for disaster.
00:34:47.770 - 00:35:38.520, Speaker C: There's a couple of critical things I'd like to insert here. There are lots of layers of failure or attack or vulnerability, what have you. So at the bottom, there was robust software that was functioning on a continuing basis, sending messages back and forth, all of which were the intended action. And then there was the design of the economics that could cause this minting of trillions of Luna that was fundamentally flawed. People can talk about it as it was an experiment and what have you, but no, there was a lot of people going, it's really bad over there, but it'll never get there. And that was the fundamental bogus error on which this stack was layered. And there's an important sense in know better that bubble was popped now before it got mean, you know, Doe was very actively wanting to get too big to fail, so that if his bubble popped, it would take everything else with him.
00:35:38.520 - 00:36:19.766, Speaker C: And that's not the way to build a robust economy. That's not the way to build a robust system. And that was the problem at the bottom. There were plenty of other ways you get problems, but many of those could have been coped with if there wasn't this core problem that would cause the whole infrastructure to collapse because someone could take over the chain, because every system is going to have people that are. When you talked about, do you think it was deliberate or malicious? Let's be really clear, that does not mean criminal, hostile takeovers happen legally. All the time, that kind of economic activity, to notice an opportunity and take it. I mean, arbitrares, malicious, I don't know.
00:36:19.766 - 00:36:20.742, Speaker C: They're just doing their thing.
00:36:20.796 - 00:36:21.362, Speaker A: It's tricky.
00:36:21.426 - 00:36:31.080, Speaker C: And so much of blockchain is all about being robust in the face of this byzantine environment. That's just a byzantine economic environment. Suck it up.
00:36:31.770 - 00:36:45.178, Speaker A: Yeah. What about you on the agork front? I mean, you're busy building. Did you feel this? Did it hit like, did your team feel it? Or were you just guys like, oh, well, we're not really, like, we're not IBC enabled yet. It doesn't.
00:36:45.354 - 00:37:31.142, Speaker C: Well, okay, so several things. And some of this will go back to cosmoverse in November or whenever it was where we started talking about interprrotocall or at that point it was called run and talking about, we've gotten through mainnet. We launched our main net zero and then went to cosmoverse and talked about it. Many of our investors are people in the cosmos ecosystem, so they suddenly could actually get their tokens and start to stake them, even though rewards weren't turned on. Now you can start to see that there could be governance, there could be all these things that they're used to. But when we describe, interpret know, folks like sunny Pung, people know fede from all these different chains. Sunny was like, finally an Atom backed stable token.
00:37:31.142 - 00:38:09.106, Speaker C: That's just what we've needed forever. And I really had this sense related to know people were using ust heavily in the cosmos ecosystem because it was kind of the only game in town and everyone was leery about it, partly because its architecture was to use this. You're relying on that chain over there that has some potential issues. And not only are you relying on that chain, you must buy into their token, right? You have to buy into know. So the only way to exit is through means, you know, if you've got really active use of it on Gaia, you got to go over to Luna exit. And so they're sort of relying on some other project to have yours be successful. That can always be challenging.
00:38:09.106 - 00:38:52.562, Speaker C: And so they were very excited about being able to unlock the capital in all of their chains, in Osmo and in Gaia, Cosmos hub and et cetera. And the fact that sort of attitude wise, we were much more about IBC enabling the world and inclusiveness so that they could feel economically that they were engaged in the stable token. And so this changed our vision of what was our initial launching to being something that was suddenly a huge service to the entire ecosystem. And that's part of what inspired renaming it and the interpretocol. And the stable token was sort of important, but not central. We need a stable token in agora. The particular mechanics don't matter to us, but it needs to be robust, it needs to be healthy, it needs to be economically sound and solvent.
00:38:52.562 - 00:38:54.534, Speaker C: And so we've been working on that.
00:38:54.572 - 00:38:55.398, Speaker A: Got it.
00:38:55.564 - 00:39:29.250, Speaker C: So obviously we saw this happening because we'd been paying attention to stable tokens in the cosmos ecosystem because we were planning to roll out with a new, very robust one. And it know, interesting. Couldn't keep your eyes off of what was going on. Partly know, oh my gosh, is it going to get all the way to where it hits that death spiral? That's sort of inherent in the architecture. And we had a conference the very next week. So gateway events, one of our investors, Rockway, put it on and it turned into a big cosmos conference. We were one of the sponsors.
00:39:29.250 - 00:39:42.514, Speaker C: It was in Prague, and it was inspired originally by cosmoverse. Like, oh, that worked. Let's get a bunch of people together in the community and make something happen. And that was starting right after that Tuesday that you talked about earlier.
00:39:42.562 - 00:39:42.726, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:42.748 - 00:40:17.234, Speaker C: So starting on the 15th. So we're showing up there, me, Zucky, the agora crew, all of these cosmos chains. And at the start of the conference, everyone's like, what's going to happen? It's really scary. There was really this, I don't know what to do yet, right. And there was a lot of terra people there and all this sort of thing. And a big impact, I think, of that conference sort of, and we'll look back historically and sort of measure some of that is it started with, okay, we had a plan, but let's talk about USD because. Oh my God.
00:40:17.234 - 00:40:49.146, Speaker C: Right. And so many chains stepped up. I mean, the first thing, know what happens to the, you know, first off, IBC executed beautifully, tendermint executed beautifully. All these things were happening, but it wasn't a bug in the software, it wasn't these systems collapsing. It was everything functioning just amazingly well to accomplish this thing that had an economic problem. But that thing imploding over there. Yeah, prices fell, but everything kind of stayed up and was fine.
00:40:49.146 - 00:41:01.194, Speaker C: I mean, this is an important way in which loosely coupled systems working together, they'll take some dependency, but they get to control it, they get to bound it and they get to stay up when that other thing over there dies. And so it was just a tour de force.
00:41:01.242 - 00:41:09.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I remember I spoke to the wormhole folks. I mean, this is maybe a bit more of a centralized bridge, but all of their system also worked. And that was one of their takeaways.
00:41:09.822 - 00:41:10.130, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:41:10.200 - 00:41:15.202, Speaker A: Nothing crashed, nothing broke, even though there was, like, liquidity flowing super fast over that.
00:41:15.256 - 00:41:58.062, Speaker C: And then the other thing that happened is the developer ecosystem worked. So just one more point about that is, at this conference, everyone's like, there were also a bunch of good projects on Terra that were quality things that they built there because there was a stable token there first. That's critical to making an economy Hackman, as I've mentioned multiple times. And so the community of Cosmos was just incredibly welcoming, right? There's several cosmwasm chains that are all like, you guys have expertise in projects, here's a new place to build. We'll fund it. Get over here. And so the transition of attitude across the two days of the conference from, oh, my God, what's happening? To, wow, cosmoth is healthy and thriving and growing.
00:41:58.062 - 00:42:04.500, Speaker C: There's a place for these people. Yep, there's going to be a big market downturn, but this is a robust place to build. Was huge.
00:42:04.950 - 00:42:42.490, Speaker A: I want to move on to sort of the second narrative I had sort of mentioned here, which was like, apps dapps that have been thinking of deploying on roll ups, potentially launching their own chain. I think the biggest example here is DyDX moving from Starknet to the cosmos ecosystem. But I do know that there's some talk of other chains doing or other applications doing this. I am curious. It almost feels like a narrative that counter, like the UsT narrative as much as it showed sort of like that. The network stayed up. It was also, I think we could say it was a bit of a hit because it was like a somewhat toxic asset that had spilled into the cosmos ecosystem.
00:42:42.490 - 00:43:04.280, Speaker A: It pulled down a lot of prices. It made people sort of feel slightly shaky. Then this new kind of narrative of roll ups potentially not being the place where people want to build, but rather them moving to the cosmos ecosystem is an interesting narrative, I would say. And I just wondered, is that a blip narrative, or is that something you're seeing in a bigger way?
00:43:04.730 - 00:43:39.874, Speaker D: So there's a lot of conversations about this going on. So I want to link it two things to this. One is, applications that were on terra have gone in a bunch of different directions, right? Some of them have gone to Polygon and Solana and all of this stuff. But there's been quite a few applications that have stated cosmos. Some of them have gone to Juno, but some of them have also launched their own chains. Some of those chains are already crazy, you know? And the other thing that was kind of funny about all of this for is Terra was always this, like, both part of Cosmos and not part of cosmos. Right.
00:43:39.874 - 00:43:48.290, Speaker D: They were always kind of like, oh, we're our own thing, separate from the rest of the cosmos ecosystem with loose connections to the cosmos ecosystem.
00:43:48.370 - 00:43:58.694, Speaker A: Wasn't there some sort of schism with Kepler wallet in them, too? I feel like they weren't added for a long time or something like that. Or ever.
00:43:58.812 - 00:44:00.582, Speaker D: Team have not been fans.
00:44:00.726 - 00:44:01.082, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:01.136 - 00:44:36.478, Speaker D: It's sort of been an interesting thing, though. As close as the Kepler and osmosis teams are, the Kepler team was not fans of Terra and UST. And even though it became such an important asset for a while on osmosis. Okay, so a lot of these have come. Some of them have launched their own chains. Kujira just launched, this is early July, and Kujira just launched their main net, which is like a Dex and stuff like that. A lot of things that were sort of in the terra ecosystem have been very seamlessly able to move into the cosmos ecosystem.
00:44:36.478 - 00:44:56.586, Speaker D: Delphi Digital has their Mars project, which is now going to be another chain on, like, all of these things. Right? Huge amount. And the world of, hey, we mostly talk to TfL people. We mostly talk to people on the terror side, has now transformed into a world of. We talked to Jack, we talked to Zucky, we talked to David at Galileo. We talked to this whole network of people. Right?
00:44:56.688 - 00:45:16.754, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think what we're also going to see, though, is some projects just shouldn't have their own. Like, do you think it might swing too far into, like, everyone has a DAp chain, has an app chain. Is it an app chain or dapchain? Or is it a app chain? It's not a zone anymore. I was schooled recently for calling it a zone. They were like, what are you saying?
00:45:16.872 - 00:45:24.754, Speaker D: We were really worried about Blockstream's trademark on sidechains. For whatever reason, when we white paper, that was why we did it this way.
00:45:24.792 - 00:45:25.950, Speaker A: So it's app chain.
00:45:26.110 - 00:45:26.850, Speaker D: Yeah, whatever.
00:45:26.920 - 00:45:27.986, Speaker A: Not zone.
00:45:28.178 - 00:45:31.270, Speaker D: I don't know. Honestly, I don't really care.
00:45:31.420 - 00:45:37.442, Speaker A: Okay. All right. But go back to the question. Do you think we might swing too far with too many teams?
00:45:37.506 - 00:45:49.738, Speaker D: So I think that's a good routing. Now, into your roll up question, right? Are all of these chains going to be able to economically secure themselves, support a lot of economic activity, all of.
00:45:49.744 - 00:45:52.202, Speaker A: This stuff, a full value set, et cetera?
00:45:52.266 - 00:46:47.854, Speaker D: Yeah. And what I would say is one of the biggest differences between the cosmos ecosystem and the roll up ecosystem, specifically the execution layers of the roll ups ecosystem, is right now, the execution layers are not really community projects. There is a company, the company has a business model, like frequently source available, business source license stuff. You can't just fork the code. And all of these entities have roadmaps, right? They all have these elaborate roadmaps of stuff that they're working on. And you have an entity like Dydx who's like, we do not want to couple our decentralization to our vendors decentralization roadmap, right. And we would like to be able to throw our own engineering resources to solve our decentralization problem.
00:46:47.854 - 00:47:05.006, Speaker D: And the roll up ecosystem today, there's nothing that architecturally about rollops that forever makes this true. It just means that the roll up ecosystem today did not have anything to offer them. And so that is how Dydx sort of ended up on cosmos.
00:47:05.118 - 00:47:27.642, Speaker A: Could you imagine where a lot of these groups launch app chains aren't able to fully create secure validator? Like, they just don't get enough value into their validator. They can't grow the value high enough that it's not corruptible, basically, or they can't get enough validators or something. Would they then potentially become like a roll up on Celestia? Is that an option?
00:47:27.696 - 00:47:55.090, Speaker D: That is largely a world there is a lot of work going on into, again, because the execution environments are so immature going back from, like, 2019, when celestial was founded, to now, as we get close to celestial launching. The thing that is most surprising to me is how immature the execution environments still are compared to the Cosmos SDK. And in theory, I'm not as familiar, but compared to something like substrate.
00:47:55.850 - 00:47:58.342, Speaker A: Wait, you're saying cosmosm? Is that what you mean?
00:47:58.476 - 00:48:41.700, Speaker D: No, what I mean is the Cosmos SDK itself, what DYDX wanted is like a full distributed system, right? They wanted proposer selection. They wanted fairness. They wanted to be able to implement their own business logic on top of a roll up system. And no one offers that today. No one in the roll up ecosystem really offers a solution in that space. And what, one of the things that we're seeing is a surprisingly large amount of interest in using pieces of the Cosmos SDK on top of optimate to build roll ups on top of celestia for custom chains, because there isn't an execution way or toolkit that really works for.
00:48:44.230 - 00:48:59.394, Speaker A: Mean. Could they also use something like interchange security eventually, or is it too hard to do that kind of migration? So interchange security being, like, using potentially a validator set and creating almost like, a subset of those validators that could be used for other projects.
00:48:59.522 - 00:49:50.150, Speaker D: So interchange security is going to appear in multiple forms, just like everything in Cosmos, right? We make open source technology, we give it to the world. Multiple go to markets run simultaneously. So one of the go to markets for interchain security is like expanding the atom economic zone, right? And that's not really like, hey, I have an app chain, I would like someone else to run it. I'm worried about security for that specific go to market. Our focus is expand the atom economic zone. But you have teams like Saga, which are trying to sort of make it much, much easier to sort of deploy app chains, get it secured by validators, all of the stuff, without having to go through all of this. And that might end up being a very appropriate solution for that kind of environment.
00:49:50.810 - 00:50:30.406, Speaker A: Okay, I want to talk about the third narrative, because then we know how to get back to IST. The third narrative is bridges bridging to IBC, or just generally other projects looking to bridge into IBC. You had sort of mentioned USDC as well, using Axilar. But, yeah, tell me a little bit about. I mean, Axelr is a Cosmos app chain itself, so maybe that's a bad example. But I know that a lot of the bridge teams we've talked to, I've had on the show also has asked them about IBC, and there is often some narrative, some kind of, like, exploration happening there. So is that a narrative that you think is taking hold of Cosmos two, which is like other networks trying to bridge into it.
00:50:30.508 - 00:50:57.886, Speaker D: So, two of the most amazing teams that we've sort of found in the last six months or so, one is the composable finance team has just been crushing IBC to the substrate polkadot ecosystem, and then also been doing it for the near ecosystem. The other teams are polymer, and they're looking at other ecosystems to build IBC clients to, too. Roll ups, et cetera. Right.
00:50:57.988 - 00:50:58.542, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:50:58.676 - 00:51:38.774, Speaker C: It is worth distinguishing, getting IBC connected to those other chains, because IBC is designed to be largely technology stack neutral. It's designed to be able to do IBC over to substrate or even over to proof of work chains. It's designed so that developers can accommodate that, they can adopt it as this neutral mechanism, and that allows you to have the robustness and usability and extensibility of IBC all the way through to those other chains. That's very different from IBC to a node that is then doing a bridge where there's some multi sig, five party bridge to just transfer assets. And so it's useful to distinguish those two cases.
00:51:38.822 - 00:51:46.330, Speaker A: But I mean, every time you touch ethereum, you are doing that, like, every time you have to convert IBC to something else because they wouldn't have an IBC.
00:51:46.410 - 00:52:03.646, Speaker C: But, for example, the substrate bridge is IBC to substrate nodes, so that you are doing end to end security without trusting the relayers in the middle, which is one of the much more robust elements of IBC versus bridges, where you're trusting the software in the middle to faithfully move your money back and forth.
00:52:03.758 - 00:52:14.390, Speaker A: Yeah, on the Polkadot front, they also have the XCM. And I was wondering if the XCM and IBC will ever speak the same language or somehow talk to each other. But we'll see. Maybe they're two different.
00:52:14.540 - 00:52:44.954, Speaker D: That is a composable finance question. But I think it's the most exciting thing about all of this stuff is, again, we are disseminating out the IBC expertise to the point where other teams are able to implement it in other places. In other places. I was always kind of frustrated, to be honest, with the ICF team's unwillingness to really go after some of these other environments as places. It's fantastic that we have new participants in the ecosystem that are doing this work.
00:52:45.092 - 00:53:18.940, Speaker A: Cool. Okay. I think we've covered some good background narratives of the cosmos ecosystem, which I think does bring us now to talk a little bit about IST. I guess in that conversation, maybe we can talk a little bit about how it could compete. I mean, I think, Dean, you've already mentioned a little bit, like, where it comes from. You always had the plan for a stablecoin, but now it's sort of become, I mean, at least it sounds like you're thinking about it a little bit more like taking the role of what UST was doing, but obviously built on much, much sturdier foundations. I hope it better.
00:53:18.940 - 00:53:33.194, Speaker A: But what about USDC coming in? Do you see it? Is that a competition? There is a stablecoin coming in. It's bridged in. It's not IBC native, I don't think. Right, correct. There's no, like, USDC.
00:53:33.322 - 00:53:36.818, Speaker D: Well, even if there is cosmos, it's coming.
00:53:36.984 - 00:53:37.940, Speaker A: That's coming.
00:53:38.710 - 00:53:46.580, Speaker C: Even at that point, it's in some sense not IBC native because your money's in a bank account. But yeah, native direct bridging into cosmos is coming.
00:53:47.590 - 00:53:52.786, Speaker D: Where is native issuance from to be announced?
00:53:52.978 - 00:53:53.526, Speaker A: Okay.
00:53:53.628 - 00:54:09.526, Speaker D: I mean, the main story is, well, like DyDX has been tweeting and they represent like $1 billion of USDCTVL. Right. We've been working very closely with the DydX team to find a USDC solution that is acceptable to them and acceptable.
00:54:09.558 - 00:54:21.214, Speaker A: To the broader Cosmos DeFi ecosystem that will then be a native asset as well. In cosmos, mintable. Well, mintable, like some centralized body will be minting it.
00:54:21.332 - 00:54:43.910, Speaker D: I think there's a fundamental reason even in an environment like the Ethereum, ecosystem is economically stable in a world where both multi collateral, DAI exists and USDC exists and tether exists. Right. Like economic stability of these things is real and actual intangible, and they are actually complementary to each.
00:54:43.980 - 00:54:44.310, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:44.380 - 00:54:52.526, Speaker A: And you think different ones have different use cases. Are there moments where you should be using DAI and moments where you should be using USDC?
00:54:52.578 - 00:55:18.306, Speaker D: Well, let's say you have a lot of atom, right? You're like, I have a lot of atom. I would like to take out a loan against that atom. Sure. You could go to some lending protocol. Lending protocols always have this mismatch between depositors and borrowers, where if you deposit when there's no borrowers, you're just not earning anything. And if you are trying to borrow when there's no depositors. And so lending protocols are called, are constantly trying to smooth this.
00:55:18.306 - 00:55:32.310, Speaker D: This is literally what we're doing in sommelier, is building a smoother for. This is something that smooths this. But when you have a maker style protocol, you can show up with your atoms and get your stablecoins, there does not have to be a deposit. Right.
00:55:32.380 - 00:55:48.330, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, so ist, like, is ist. I mean, you've sort of said it's a multicolateral dye of cosmos, I guess you could say. But is it multicolateral? Is it starting multi collateral like when you first envisioned this, Dean, wasn't it more like a single collateral?
00:55:48.830 - 00:56:22.182, Speaker C: No, it was always multi collateral. It was always about bring assets over IBC to be able to mint against it. Because ironically, the one asset that we don't directly do this sort of CDP style vault with is agorax build, because then that competes with using build to secure the chain. Right. And so it was always about being able to bring other assets as collateral and enabling people across the interchain to unlock the value of those assets. And so the multicolateral was, well, got to do atom, right? And Osmo. Got to do Osmo right now.
00:56:22.182 - 00:56:53.102, Speaker C: Oh, well, there's all these other chains coming up, many of which are going to be big chains with serious asset value there, enabling them to unlock that in a way that is consistent with how all the other chains are unlocking themselves. What you would not want is a stable coin per chain, right? A stable coin per app chain. What you want is to know you can use the same thing. I can unlock my atom and use it over in this smart contract running on Evmos. I can unlock my OsmO and use that value over in the same smart contract running on Evmos, right?
00:56:53.156 - 00:57:01.458, Speaker A: Would you only allow cosmos native tokens to be collateral, or would you allow synthetic ETH to be a collateral as well?
00:57:01.544 - 00:58:09.134, Speaker C: Well, so first off, it's a community thing. It's really not up to me. There'll be an economic committee know informed by gauntlet running simulations and all this sort of thing that determines the right profiles and risk for that. But one of the key differentiators about the implementation of IST on agoric is because it is built with the same hardened JavaScript framework with composable smart contracts, it will be much more straightforward for it to grow over time to incorporate other things like even synthetic assets for off chain assets, or at the point where there is some robust set of NFTs or some robust set of securitized real estate assets, the community could decide with the appropriate risk models and liquidation process to add those as potential collateral types. That's a long way away. The key thing is it was always the assets are up to the community. And if there was a robust bridge, then being able to use Saul or wrapped ETH or BTC, those were always something that we envisioned as being reasonable collateral.
00:58:09.134 - 00:58:52.678, Speaker C: It was always designed, IST was always designed. Nutra protocol was always designed to be multi collateral with assets in the cosmos ecosystem, so that you could uniformly use a stable token, even if you were starting from having Osmo or having atom and assets from other chains, either as IBC connects to substrate or what have you, or they're just brought over with, you know, Wrapdeeth, Rap, BTC, Zec, Solana, what have you. All of those are capital assets that have some kind of history, models of volatility, such you come up with an appropriate role for them as collateral in our ecosystem. And that's how you power an economy is, by connecting disparate things and making it so you can do business across them.
00:58:52.844 - 00:59:18.960, Speaker A: So now I want to throw back to the story a little bit of UST and I guess a question I have is, given the knowledge that we have from that kind of case happening, from having been able to observe it, do you have protection within the design itself for if a toxic asset were to be used as collateral in a system like that. And I guess here I need to also check, could a toxic asset really kind of mess it up, I'm assuming? Yes.
00:59:19.330 - 00:59:58.490, Speaker C: Well, we have protections against that. So the key thing, I mean, one of the biggest protections is debt limits for any particular asset type. And if you're going to have a system that's extensible, thinking about how you extend it but bound the risk of any new extension is absolutely critical. So we were talking about USDC. That's a friend to getting defi going. Right? We have a module which you can bring in USDC and directly mint IST against that because it's a high quality existing stable token. But that too has a debt limit because that's another system.
00:59:58.490 - 01:00:21.934, Speaker C: It's got its own risks, whether it's contract bridge or US government. And so it's got to have a debt limit. So every distinct collateral has a debt limit. And one of the jobs of the economic committee is if things start to turn south, bring that debt limit to zero so that no new vaults can be created or no new IST can be minted against a collateral that looks like it's at risk.
01:00:21.982 - 01:00:28.082, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. Would there be like a risk assessment done on these different assets? Is that how that happens?
01:00:28.216 - 01:00:28.814, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:00:28.952 - 01:00:31.574, Speaker A: Is that how it happens in Dai? Actually, yeah.
01:00:31.612 - 01:00:39.114, Speaker C: There's a risk committee that evaluates new collateral types. There's a whole process for adding a collateral type. In our case, we're working through that process now.
01:00:39.232 - 01:00:48.954, Speaker D: The work of the risk committee at Maker is actually like a shining example of prudence in cool, right?
01:00:48.992 - 01:00:50.810, Speaker C: Yeah, it's an inspiration.
01:00:51.390 - 01:01:13.582, Speaker D: Monet supply, who's like one of the people on the risk dow, is also a big cosmos enthusiast, and so we talk about this all the time, but I'm a huge fan of his work. They look at smart contracts, they look at the economics of the asset, they look at everything. Right. And I hope that with inter, we live up to the standard that is set by the Makerdao collateral risk committee.
01:01:13.646 - 01:01:27.574, Speaker C: So, yeah, we're inspired by their risk committee. In addition, we've engaged gauntlet. They do economic simulations on other smart contracts and are very well respected, Tarantitra and company, about how they understand these.
01:01:27.612 - 01:01:29.740, Speaker A: Things, sometimes co host of the show.
01:01:30.910 - 01:01:32.202, Speaker C: You might have met him, right?
01:01:32.256 - 01:01:33.162, Speaker A: You might have heard him.
01:01:33.216 - 01:02:27.078, Speaker C: Yeah. And so Gauntlet will be doing ongoing simulations. So not only we do risk evaluations upfront, but every week there's a reevaluation of every collateral type to figure out what the right debt limits, interest rates, volatility targets, all these kinds of things are for each collateral type independently in each of the different ways it might function in our system. And so that will, as we grow either new collateral types or new collaterals, or even new collateral types, like if we want to use liquidity tokens as a collateral type that has some important economic advantages from a capital efficiency point of view. That's something that we look forward to doing after in future main net releases, and that's something that they'll be able to model, incorporate into the overall risk analysis models that's being continuously evaluated for each of these collaterals.
01:02:27.254 - 01:02:54.514, Speaker A: Very cool. I want to say a big thank you to both of you for coming on the show, sharing with us a little backstory on UST. Also what you've both been up to in your respective projects and the istinterstable tokeninterist, whatever we're going to call it, upcoming token. I guess this comes out with main net one phase one, right? The one you were saying would happen potentially in Q three. So it's something to look for, I guess.
01:02:54.632 - 01:02:55.106, Speaker D: Cool.
01:02:55.208 - 01:02:57.122, Speaker C: And we'll be back after that launches.
01:02:57.266 - 01:03:00.886, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. All right, thanks, guys. Thanks for being on.
01:03:01.068 - 01:03:04.760, Speaker C: Thank you so much for having us. And as always, it's great.
01:03:05.450 - 01:03:06.722, Speaker D: Thank you. Anna.
01:03:06.866 - 01:03:14.770, Speaker A: I want to say a big thank you to the team that put together the ZK podcast. That's Tanya, Rachel, Chris, and Henrik. And to our listeners, thanks for listening.
