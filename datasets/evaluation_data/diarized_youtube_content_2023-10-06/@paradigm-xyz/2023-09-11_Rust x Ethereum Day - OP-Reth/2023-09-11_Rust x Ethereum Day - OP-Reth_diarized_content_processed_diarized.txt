00:00:02.280 - 00:00:25.614, Speaker A: All right, hey, everybody. So we're here to talk to you guys about Oprah today. And just before we get to the slides, we just wanted to show you this is a real node. This is the op node driving Reth to sync base Gourlay. At the moment, we are at block around 5.1 million, which is past the regolith hard fork. So we have already gone.
00:00:25.614 - 00:01:08.636, Speaker A: Oops. We've already gone all the way through the bedrock blocks and are well into sinking regolith. So, yeah. So where did this project start? About last fall, I pinged Georgios because we were planning on making a patch to Akula. Obviously, Reth came in and kind of deprecated akula and took over development of the rust client. And so Georgios was well willing to do this. Some projects came in the way of everybody, and now that Reth is coming close to being out of alpha, about a month and a half ago, Coinbase optimism and the Reth team got together and said this patch must be pretty easy to do.
00:01:08.636 - 00:01:47.196, Speaker A: And it turned out to actually be. So the op gethdif is actually really small. It only entails a couple of things. The primary things are that we have this new deposit transaction type, which actually allows you to send deposits into the roll up, as well as some l one to l two cross chain messages. The engine, API, and payload building receive several modifications to allow us to insert transactions directly from the sequencer in order. And then there's also some state transition modifications that affect how deposit transactions are processed, the gas accounting, et cetera. And then there's also some small, less consensus critical items, like some RPC stubbing, et cetera.
00:01:47.196 - 00:02:18.290, Speaker A: But that's kind of the gist of it. So when will you guys be able to run this? Hopefully pretty soon. As you guys can see, we got past the regolith hard fork on base Gourlay. I think that the biggest hurdles next will be historical state support so we can run this on op mainnet. If any of you guys don't know, base goorly is an op stack chain that has no historical state. Op mainnet is really the only one. But past that, we are pretty close to having this in your hands.
00:02:23.430 - 00:03:03.290, Speaker B: And we just like to say a huge thank you to all of our contributors. We based a lot of this off of op Geth as well as op Aragon, built by testin prod Proto helped us a ton base developers. We have Roberto at the top left there, Brian bottom right. Killer, killer job. And then, of course, the whole op, the whole ret team as well as vex and myself. And so what's next? We're going to build the op stack in rust. It is going to happen.
00:03:03.290 - 00:03:37.490, Speaker B: Op Zethe is up next. We have optimism, execution changes. We have to move them into revm. We have ref powered indexing tools. We can probably get that alongside cryo for free and off chain agents, l two blockbuilders, et cetera, et cetera. And first we need to get to tip and say syncede. And if you don't contribute to the rust op stack, t eleven s won't follow you, so better get on it.
00:03:39.790 - 00:03:40.798, Speaker A: Thanks, Sean.
00:03:40.974 - 00:03:41.430, Speaker B: Thank you.
