00:00:10.170 - 00:00:43.910, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to another week of system seminars with avalabs. This week we're joined with ex Cornell professor and the CEO of Panoptic to talk to us about blockchain options. All right, yeah, thanks very much. Yeah, I used to be in a assistant professor of applied physics, and I was doing research in biological physics. So overall, very remote from DeFi or finance. But then it turns out that the math and the models that a lot of physicists use in their research, including mine, can be applied to pricing of options, or at least derivatives.
00:00:43.910 - 00:01:10.114, Speaker A: So it was the same equations if you want, but applied to a different system. So again, I was a options trader at the retail side. I was big into DeFi. I was able to kind of see a link between the amms that seem, again, there's a duality. That's the title. Let me share my screen. There's a duality that again, I feel I discovered as a way, and you can reinterpret options amms in a different way.
00:01:10.114 - 00:01:38.170, Speaker A: So again, life also happened. So again, I'm moving on for my position. I'm full time CEO and founder of Panoptic. We did a seed around last year, and the blizzard or avalanche ecosystem fund participated. But yeah, overall, we're in the better phase, will launch next year. And yeah, let me tell you about, again, the journey that is behind panoptic. So, first, the TLDR.
00:01:38.170 - 00:02:37.978, Speaker A: The one thing that you have to take out of this talk is that concentrated liquidity amms, they are both a spot trading venue, which is what you're used to. You go on uniswap or Trader Joe, you just swap spot trade, two assets, but at the back end, it's also an options clearinghouse. And that's kind of the new way of reintroducing amms. Whereas before you had two markets, two cities, even two different structures for the New York Stock Exchange in New York and the Sibo, or the Chicago Board of Options Exchange in Chicago, where prices in the New York Stock Exchange will drive the pricing of options halfway across the country. There used to be an optimal pathing for the best routed fiber optic to get a few nanoseconds ahead of your competitors. And now everything, the servers are in New Jersey, and it's all algorithmic, but it used to be very important. And again, New York was spot and exchanges.
00:02:37.978 - 00:03:29.562, Speaker A: Chicago was options mainly. And the beauty of considered liquidity amms, like Uniswap B, three, that you have a spot market in the front, and also it's like, again, a mullet options curing house in the back, you don't necessarily see it. And unless you're a LP yourself or provided liquidity in Uniswap, you don't ever have to touch the options part. So that's kind of the basic idea behind why panoptic is able to create options by leaning into Uniswap. Again, I'll go over a few key aspects of panoptic, and then again we'll describe this. I wasn't sure the level, it might be a bit more academic, but I'm leaving plenty of time at the end so that people can ask questions. First, is that an option in panoptic is created by moving liquidity inside a Uniswap pool or any concentrated liquidity amm.
00:03:29.562 - 00:04:31.394, Speaker A: So you don't trade tokens, you trade LP tokens or shares or concentrated liquidity shares. That's one point. The other one is that the pricing of an option is path dependent and starts at zero, and our options have no expiry. It's a new way of thinking about options, but the same way that Uniswap had to get rid of the order book to create a kind of seamless experience for traders, we also have to get rid of expiries and other inefficiencies in options, but that makes the whole system work more fluently and that the pricing is the biggest thing that is impacted. And finally, lps, or at least there's a new role for a passive liquidity provider. Again, if you are into deFi, you may have tried providing liquidity here. We make it much easier in panoptic and kind of disintegrate the traders and market makers, which are sophisticated and they're more passive users, which are, again, less, cannot be on top.
00:04:31.394 - 00:05:00.234, Speaker A: Twenty four seven. So we allow them to create something that is easier for them. All right, so we'll go over a few components of Panoptic and going back to uniswap v three and considered liquidity. Again, uniswap was the original amm. You have this x times y equals k curve. That's the kind of blue line here. This is kind of a lot of what the MMS do.
00:05:00.234 - 00:05:30.390, Speaker A: Now. You make sure that the product of token zero and token one, for instance, is always the same. And this is kind of given by the liquidity. This is one way of looking at it. You can also invert that equation in a way that, again, personally I find more intuitive. You look at the value of an Lp position, meaning that you start with this equation and invert it to see what is the value of my position as the price increases. So the value as a function of price is a square root function.
00:05:30.390 - 00:05:54.494, Speaker A: So if the price goes to zero, you own nothing. But as the price increases, because it's an invariant that is maintained, the value increases as a square root of price. So you have four x in terms of expansion. In price, you only have two x more value in your wallet. But that's kind of the weird convexity payoff. Normally, it would be one to one. Now it's one to square root of p.
00:05:54.494 - 00:06:19.746, Speaker A: The price. That's how you do it. With a regular v two, like amms, uniswap v three allowed liquidity to be concentrated. So what you do is effectively move that line towards the again, origin, and that shifts and changes the form of that equation. X times y times y equals k. It's x plus some factor. Plus y times y to plus factor is l squared.
00:06:19.746 - 00:06:52.834, Speaker A: Liquidity squared. Some math. This is from the uniswap white paper. And then you can do more math to replot and retransform this invariant way of showing the reserves to something that, again, looks like a payoff. So as the price increases, you also have a value. And in the case of a uniswap v three, concentrated liquidity position, you specify a range, and you have point a here and point b. If the price is below that lower range, you're 100% asset, your 100% eat.
00:06:52.834 - 00:07:35.534, Speaker A: For instance, as the price increases and you get above that upper limit, you're 100% cash or 100% USDC. So below you are exposed to the asset. Above you are kind of in the quote. If you want asset, that's the quote token, which is USDC. And somewhere in between curvy, there's some square root function. If you look at the full payoff of UnivQ, it goes from zero to infinity, being that square root here, it's only between that range that you have this square root function. And if you look at it again, if you're above the range, if the price moves, you'll stop with USDC, that doesn't move.
00:07:35.534 - 00:08:01.842, Speaker A: If the price collapses, you're stuck with more of that whatever shit coin that you hold. And in between, it's kind of moving. But if you look at the payoff, the purple line here, this looks a lot like a covered call. Payoff. Again, a covered call is a regular, very used option strategy. You can be out of the money, which is kind of above this price, and the payoff is flat. If you're in the money, payoff is flat.
00:08:01.842 - 00:08:36.962, Speaker A: Out of the money, you are holding the asset. So you have a very similar payoff of the value of your LP position to the payoff of a covered call position. So that's kind of the first kernel of idea that drove, and is driving, again, panoptic. So again, that payoff of a covered call looks uncannily like a payoff of a univ. Three LP position. And that's kind of the formula, but overall, very similar. So, if we start with this simple observation, and adding liquidity in a uniswap pool here, you add some liquidity around some strike k s is the current price.
00:08:36.962 - 00:09:16.138, Speaker A: If you're adding liquidity below the price, it's 100% die, or in this case, code asset. And as the price moves, you have this kind of conversion. And the key point is that you can also generate a payoff that looks a lot like the payoff of a covered call by just adding liquidity this way. And the key point is that the offset in the Y level, meaning that. Do I have it? Yeah, the offset in the y axis here is the amount of fees that you collect by that position. So if the price is outside that specific range, you collect no fees. If the price hovers and hugs that price, you collect a lot of fees.
00:09:16.138 - 00:09:43.394, Speaker A: So the fees you collect kind of shifts. This goes upwards. You have a very simple analogy with the payoff. Looks like a cover call payoff, but also the fees collected by your position, they look a lot like the premium you would receive as an option seller. And just to illustrate this, you can have a very narrowly defined single tick position. And every time you get in range, you collect some fees. And as the price moves up and down again, this happens naturally.
00:09:43.394 - 00:10:00.186, Speaker A: But you could cross that boundary. And every time you cross, you collect some fees. In that case, it could be 30 basis point or 0.3% per visit. But as you move back and forth, this is how you can collect. So this is maybe from a bit earlier, but you can visualize where fees are collected. So this is the price of die over time.
00:10:00.186 - 00:10:25.410, Speaker A: The red is where liquidity, oops, liquidity is distributed. And the green line is where fees are collected. So as price moves, this is where fees are collected. You have, again, thousands of fees collected, but most of the liquidity is outside of range. If you want this, liquidity is not near the price. Same thing here. People are a bit more, a bit wider, but a lot of liquidity sits idly outside.
00:10:25.410 - 00:10:52.474, Speaker A: If you were able to just focus your liquidity to that region, you would make a lot more money than if it's wider. But overall, this is kind of the natural process of things. The price moves. It determines where fees are accumulated and if you're in range, you get paid more for your covered call. If you're out of range, you don't get paid anything. So that's kind of the two key elements, payoff and premium. And that's what you can do now.
00:10:52.474 - 00:11:20.434, Speaker A: You can actually do. And if you were to provide liquidity now on Uniswap, you would be selling property call options, whether you understand this or not. So that was kind of the first step, understanding what it is to provide liquidity. Provider what it is to provide liquidity in uniswap. The next level of where kind of panoptic adds some magic to it is, yeah, it's fine to sell options, but most people want to buy options. You want to buy puts, you want to buy. GameStop calls.
00:11:20.434 - 00:12:13.746, Speaker A: How can we implement options buying in a concentrated liquidity? Mm, like that. So the first gut is that gut feeling is that if you have a LP position, this corresponds to selling an option. What about shorting that LP position or borrowing that LP position? Would that invert the price curve and go from a short put to a long put? You either sell it put, but rather you buy a put by shorting that liquidity provision. So that's kind of the next innovation that is enabled by panautic. If you remove liquidity and borrow an LP token, you are creating the exact same payoff as a long option, as if you were to buy an option. So we'll go over the details, but the way this works is that you remove liquidity. Someone else could put it there, either the protocol or some other user.
00:12:13.746 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker A: But you remove liquidity and you have a debt that is owed, which is KDI or whatever, immunity. But you remove coin from that pool and you put it somewhere, you tuck it somewhere else. And if you look at the price, and if the price stays above that range, you can just move it back with no cost. You borrow some stable coin, you put it back and the payoff is the same. You may be paying a commission fee or some type of lending fee, but the key point is that it doesn't cost you anything if the price is above. If, on the other hand, the price moves down, and this is kind of the key point, you borrowed, or your debt is dominated in stablecoin. But as the price crosses that region, your debt is now one e or one unit of the risky asset.
00:13:06.870 - 00:13:47.430, Speaker A: So what was initially a debt in stablecoin? Becomes a debt in ETH, a risky asset. So I'll pray it one more time. If the price goes up, it's back to stablecoin. If it goes down, it's back to eth. So that simple conversion means that you borrowed some cash, and you have to pay back an asset whose value is lower than the value of what you own, you owe. So you get KDI, could be 1500 USDC in your account. You have to pay back one unit of ETH, and because the price is down, it's below 1500, could be 1000, could be 100, could be zero.
00:13:47.430 - 00:14:40.786, Speaker A: It's cheap to buy it, so you buy this, eat in the open market, you decrease your balance a little bit, but it's cheaper than what you own, so you are creating a profit that's kind of strike minus price, and that's kind of your diagonal line up to the left. So that's the tId. If you short an LP token, the debt instrument changes with price. And what was initially stablecoin becomes assets. And this transformation happens by trading activity in uniswap. If someone wants to manipulate the pool, they really have to push it through all of that liquidity, and they would be trading against their own kind of liquidity if they are the ones positing there. So that's kind of the key feature that allows us to create long options, because you can borrow the price, and there's no oracle that tells you what the price is.
00:14:40.786 - 00:15:45.030, Speaker A: You just look at the composition at the LP position, that tells you whether you're in a money or out of money, and how much you have to pay back, and that's your pre off curve. So all of this creates a very simple system to not borrow coins, but also borrow and short, I guess, those LP tokens. There's always a problem with any borrow or lending protocols, is that someone can go and buy a mention, and then if the price of the asset goes down, they have to pay it back, and you cannot go and see someone else's mention, and that could lead to bad debt. So that's a problem that most lending protocols have to face, someone borrowing all the available stablecoins. The way we solve this is that when someone borrows funds, it doesn't go to their account, it goes to the panoptic smart contract, and they are kind of entitled to that amount. And as long as they close their position and pay it back, they can net the profit. But all the liquidity that is moved or reshuffled never leaves the panoptic uniswap ecosystem.
00:15:45.030 - 00:16:17.442, Speaker A: That means that it's very straightforward to liquidate someone or to kind of take care of debt that is accumulating because it's in the penoptic pool, smart contracts, you just have to move it back to where it belong. It's not going to be sold off on some centralized exchanges. So that means that users somewhat communicate with the smart contract. And the smart contract is the one moving liquidity back and forth. They own all of it, and they are entitled to that kind of profit that's generated or they have to pay back what is owed. But it's more like a swap. They don't own the instrument.
00:16:17.442 - 00:16:55.354, Speaker A: They direct someone, a smart contract, to kind of trade or at least move the liquidity. So that means that it's somewhat straightforward to liquidate an account, and losses are much less because you can actually, again, move liquidity back from an optical, or you can seize the collateral. Yes, everything is fine. Okay. Again, feel free to ask questions, if you had any questions as I go through. So one key feature is that your positions have a width. In uniswap, it doesn't need to be very narrow.
00:16:55.354 - 00:17:20.754, Speaker A: It could be wider. And you can create kind of this call spread where you remove some liquidity and put it higher. But then the width means that the payoff is going to be smoother and that's going to be helping you with managing risk and gamma risk and stuff. You can also create multilegged positions. You can combine selling a put and selling a call. That's a strangle. You can buy and sell options to create defined risk strategies.
00:17:20.754 - 00:17:46.340, Speaker A: This is kind of an iron condor. So you cap your max losses by buying protection on the upside and downside, you can do a lot of interesting stuff. Again, it could be ratio spreads, Eddie payoff. And I'll show in the interface, we can create a lot of them. That payoff you can think of, you can basically create in panoptic. So options are kind of payoff complete. That means we can create pretty much anything we want by just moving these blocks of equity back and forth in.
00:17:46.340 - 00:18:15.062, Speaker A: So this is kind of the kernel. Daddy. This started more than two years ago. I was still a professor. This was my summer project, meaning I wanted to understand uniswap because I lost money the first time lp. I got to this conclusion pretty early on that this was like a put and call option, and there's a perpetual nature to it, but that was kind of very early on. I'm sure most people also would have gotten that point, but this is kind of the nature of amms.
00:18:15.062 - 00:18:53.494, Speaker A: On one side spot, the other side is this options clearing house. The key point that took a little bit longer to figure out is the actual pricing of these options. So it's fine to move liquidity around, but if the cost is too high or too low, the incentives aren't well aligned. So again, how to figure out pricing was a very large component of the next kind of months till we launch. So we have this black Scholes pricing that's oracle less and I'll explain to this in a little bit. But black Scholes is the kind of most used model to price options. The discovers blacks and Scholes got Nobel Prize and overall it's still used to this day.
00:18:53.494 - 00:19:35.010, Speaker A: It's not a perfect model, but the best one we have. And the key point is that, as I mentioned earlier, you have this analogy between the fees collected and the premium you would collect as the option seller. And if we were to look at different price paths that you can simulate again fairly easily, you start at some price, you have liquidity deposited above your strike. So that could be a covered call depending on the price path. This unlucky price led to zero fees, meaning that the price never reached that boundary. So as an option seller, you get paid nothing or at least you get no fees. You could be moving right past through it and very quickly kind of moving away.
00:19:35.010 - 00:20:35.750, Speaker A: In that case, you get a little bit of fees or you can be extremely lucky on the sell side and price hugs around this price, this range, you collect a lot of fees because you were kind of directionally neutral and this is where the price stayed. So that is what you get now in uniswap, depending on where you deploy and the price path can vary quite a bit from zero to a little bit, more than zero to quite a bit. And in that case, what is the relationship between all these numbers? Say if you collect 0.2 e in a month or seven days, in that case, or zero in seven days or one, how does that convert to the black shoes? How would black shoes predict that price? And again, given that in traditional finance, you get paid upfront for your covered call here, it's fees that are accumulated and they are accumulated over time. It's again, a slightly different way of keeping track. So how can we kind of reconcile black shoes and the fees collected by the position? And it turns out that the way to see this. So our options are perpetual.
00:20:35.750 - 00:21:06.290, Speaker A: They don't have an expiry. If you go on uniswap now, you can deposit liquidity there and hold it for years if you want nothing will prevent you from holding it. So the options don't expire. They are always present. And the way to see this is that instead of thinking that they expire infinite in the future, they instead expire every block and are redeployed at every block. So it's a construction that you don't have to redeploy it yourself. Every block that expires, you redeploy your option.
00:21:06.290 - 00:21:32.826, Speaker A: Redeploy, redeploy, redeploy. And if you want to stop, if you want to remove that position, you stop redeploying. This contrast a little bit with maybe a large fund that wants to buy, put options to kind of hedge their risks. Every month they buy an option. At the end of the month it expires. Whether they make money or not, they redeploy and buy again, and buy again and buy again. So it happens every month or it can happen every week or every day.
00:21:32.826 - 00:22:17.906, Speaker A: In tradfi here, it happens every 12 seconds. And if we stop from that shift behind LP positions being options that expire every block, you can now accumulate the price as whatever is emulated by each block. So every time it's in range, you accumulate a little bit of fees. If it's out of range, you accumulate zero. So this is the fee that is collected. And can you actually integrate those fees over time to get back the price or in blood price of that option, that call option? So, again, theta is the Greek that determines how much money you make, I guess, as a seller, every day. What if we integrate theta in that case, is integrating this tiny, tiny chunk over the price path.
00:22:17.906 - 00:23:00.774, Speaker A: Can we get back to a premium or value for the premium? So, again, that's something you can do numerically, that's something you can do analytically as well. The key point is that if you look at the price path, there's a clear analogy. Again, this is some liquidity that's been deployed in a very narrow range. This is the gray bar here. If you were to look at that premium, it's going to be zero most of the time, but you have these kind of super large jumps whenever it crosses this, but most of the time it's going to be zero. So it's very steppy in terms of how much you get. If you are wider, you always get something, but it's a bit less.
00:23:00.774 - 00:23:42.900, Speaker A: So as long as you're in range, you collect fees. You may be not getting fees, but most of the time you're in range. It turns out there's a clear analogy between the width of your option, meaning that the width of your lp position and the implied time to expiry of that position. So what I mean by that is that in uniswap, the wider you are. This corresponds to a covered call payoff that's further away from expiring. It's still redeployed every block, it's still doing this weird kind of auto rolling. But the gamma profile, the fees collected and kind of the risk that you undertake looks a lot like a weekly option.
00:23:42.900 - 00:24:05.210, Speaker A: And the narrower you are, this looks like a zero DT, even, or 1 hour for expiry. And if you take this to the minimum tick size, this is similar in terms of payoff and risk as an option that's 15 minutes from expiring. So. 03:45 p.m. On a Friday. People that have options know about gamma risk and pin risk. It's very risky to hold this.
00:24:05.210 - 00:24:59.782, Speaker A: So the narrower the position, the closer it is from expiry, and the other side, the wider it is. You can go full range, you can do go super wide in uniswap. And that corresponds now the risk and the payoff of an option that expires way in the future. So the perpetual nature means that your option is rolled forward every block the width gives you a risk profile that corresponds to some intrinsic timescale. And again, I'm a physicist, so if you actually estimate that gaussian function that you have for the theta of a real expiring options using black scholes, and you kind of convert this to a square, which is what you have in uniswap. I'm okay with making these assumptions. You can actually convert the fees collected by that position to an implied volatility that would exist in a black Scholes like marvel.
00:24:59.782 - 00:25:26.126, Speaker A: And in that case, yes, in that case, you can backtrack and find, given the fees you collect, what is a fraction of the implied return you would get from black trolls. And the numbers I showed you before, you collect no fees because the price never touched your position. It's 0% of black trolls. You collect a little bit of fees. It's, I guess, 85%. But if you're unlucky, it moves there. You end up collecting multiples of black holes.
00:25:26.126 - 00:26:03.370, Speaker A: The keyboard is. You can run these simulations. You can use that relationship between that kind of square rectangle to estimate the gaussian payoff and get a distribution of returns. And all of those generate a lot of returns with zero, meaning that you don't collect fees for selling an option. And a lot of those generate much higher returns. But if you look at it over a million different price path, they converge to that Blackrock's price of like one to one. So the key point is that returns, if you were to average them over multiple positions, multiple traders, multiple timescales, would converge to black shoals.
00:26:03.370 - 00:27:01.742, Speaker A: And the only parameter you need to fit is some type of implied volatility that is given by the market structure of the uniswap pool, not necessarily what happens on derivit or the CME or any other centralized exchanges in terms of options pricing. So that's kind of the analogy that we can make, is that when you have a model for options pricing, this is Merten and Scholes and fisherback as well. You can convert this to how much fees you collect in Uniswap. And again, very simply, fees that you receive as an option seller would correspond to a premium with a specific iv. And fees you pay as an options buyer would be those same fees or the same premium that the seller would have got. So someone sells an option, you buy it. The price that the buyer will have to pay is read off from the Uniswap smart contract.
00:27:01.742 - 00:27:32.234, Speaker A: It tells you how much fees was generated. So you can, one to one, reimburse the seller, and the buyer will be somewhat paying a fair price because there's no intermediary, it's on the market maker that tells you what to price it for. And the seller as well would be also accurate because it's the real trading activity that happens in uniswap. So now we can only sell options and collect this fee. What pinoptic enables is buying an option. And the premium you have to pay as a buyer, again, is that fee that would have been collected. So it's very straightforward.
00:27:32.234 - 00:27:53.970, Speaker A: We don't have to solve any. It's very, very integrated by the Uniswap smart contract. So that's the second very important component. Payoff is one thing, the other one is premium. And it turns out to be very simple. Fees are what you pay. If there's not enough fees and options are cheap, you should buy them.
00:27:53.970 - 00:28:44.594, Speaker A: If there's a lot of fees and options are rich, then you shouldn't sell them. So it's going to be a lot more market driven in terms of pricing, because you can benefit and you can arb with urban or CME, or you can just kind of bet on the intrinsic volatility of that asset. So from that point of view, there might be something that if folks are following the crypto Twitter quite a bit, everyone is hammering on uniswap LP, saying that they lose money. Again, 50% of wallets are losing money in uni v three. This was kind of from two years ago, but even now, a lot of this is still kind of part of the discussion. Most of the people have this notion that lps are losing money. This one, again, they collectively lose millions of dollars because they are dumb or not able to do it, or people don't know.
00:28:44.594 - 00:29:19.918, Speaker A: They just like to mention that folks are losing money again. My own personal experience is that it's different. It's not quite as simple as that. My view is that yes, some pools are net ev in terms of returns in uniswap, but the reason is that those are the most popular pools. Those are the pools that everyone wants to participate into. And what happens is that in this environment, the implied volatility of that option that you're selling by providing liquidity is less than the realized volatility of the real price move. That happens.
00:29:19.918 - 00:30:07.514, Speaker A: So most of the time in tradfi, implied volatility is higher than realized because people are buying options for risk management. They don't mind paying a bit more because it helps them sleep at night. And it's somewhat rare that implied is less than realized. And when this happens, as a seller, you don't sell and maybe you're more inclined to buy, but typically the implied is higher. So you make a statistically better chance of making a return by selling to that pool. So that is what you have now, if you add liquidity in uniswap, you add more liquidity. Price move gets repressed, you have less volatility, and the more people sell, the more the volatility will be below, meaning that the less returns you get as a seller.
00:30:07.514 - 00:30:33.714, Speaker A: So if everyone is selling something, the price will go down. In that case, iv and fees will go down. What we enable in panoptic is that you can tap into this low iv environment and buy options. And again, if you buy options, you remove liquidity, you make the pool slippage higher, more price impact per trade. It's harder to keep track with centralized exchanges. You make more money per unit of liquidity. So that's kind of how you can now restore the fees.
00:30:33.714 - 00:31:10.930, Speaker A: And that's why iv now will be the metric to verify whether you should participate in the pool or not, and not necessarily kind of the price move. So that is kind of what I see as the main problem with current narrative. It's not just that the lps are losing money, it's like because they don't have any chance to take the other side of the market. If someone wants to bet something, there should be someone to bet against. So that's kind of where the buyers will come to play. After we launch. Again, that liquidity that is created now will be shaped not by folks thinking where the price would go, but rather by buying and selling of options.
00:31:10.930 - 00:32:06.630, Speaker A: Then someone can move liquidity closer to the price, someone can move it away, and that shape will be now kind of creating a volatility surface will kind of inform the market structure, but it's going to be very integrated. So again, spot and options are in the same contract, but also options impact spot prices a lot more closely because you are physically changing how much it costs to trade. If there's a lot of liquidity, the process size is going to be lower. So again, it's very integrated, very kind of a beautiful relationship between spot and options that you don't necessarily see in tradfi. So that's payoff and pricing. And if that's the only thing we need, then again, it's fairly easy and straightforward to create that protocol. The one thing that is missing, and that was missing, and we identified this early on, is that in order to trade options, in order to be a trader, you need to have capital efficiency.
00:32:06.630 - 00:32:42.330, Speaker A: You cannot be successful if all of your positions have to be backed 100% by your collateral. In tradfi, low small accounts cannot trade on leverage. The larger your account is, the more sophisticated, quote unquote, the banks think you are, so they allow you to borrow in excess margin. Same thing happens in the options. You need some capital efficiency to be successful and kind of be more capital efficient with your money. So what happens now is that as an LP, now you have to choose where to deposit liquidity. You have to manage that liquidity.
00:32:42.330 - 00:33:11.362, Speaker A: You have to kind of be subjected to implement loss, or at least changes implement loss. We call this gamma risk in tradfi, but it's a tough job to be an LP. It's simpler in uniswap v two, because it's only one range and you don't have to worry. It's just entry and exit point that are important. In Univ. Three, it's actually very difficult to manage. So what we enable is that folks can deposit funds in the panoptic pool and act as lenders.
00:33:11.362 - 00:33:52.386, Speaker A: It's like a lending protocol on AvEG and or compound. But instead of those funds going to buy I mentioned in Australia, they go towards market making. So the borrowers can only borrow those funds to market make with and trade, and they may be sophisticated and they know where to put liquidity. In your case, you don't care because they pay you an interest rate and they don't actually have to manage that liquidity book. So this is how, again, in our case, there's a new role that exists. We always say we bring back passive liquidity provisioning to Uniswap, because there's going to be a passive role that will fund the market makers. And these market makers will be happy to tap into this leverage and borrow, but they themselves will be not exposed that much risk.
00:33:52.386 - 00:34:31.902, Speaker A: There's going to be a return that maybe matches the volatility. So stablecoin, stablecoin may be lower returns in terms of borrowing and lending, but pepe or croc or any meme coin may have a lot of demand. In that case, the yield of this passive liquidity provider might be much higher. But yeah, so this is how we have kind of a new role, which is the passive liquidity provider. It's the bank. If you have a brokerage firm or I don't know who lends you money here is going to be users and they can type into this. That means that there's going to be a lot of funds in the Uniswap pool, likely in excess of what has been sold.
00:34:31.902 - 00:35:07.854, Speaker A: There's always a buffer in terms of kind of protocol risk, and the buyers, or the traders as well will also tap into this leverage by kind of netting the capital requirement. And we're matching what happens in tratfi, meaning that if you want to sell a covered call that has notional value of one eth, so you sell a one e covered call, it could be a one contract in tradfi. Here it's one eth of covered call. You only need to put 0.2 e of collateral to back it up. And that means that you're protected up to a 20% downturn in price. And more than that, you lose all of your money.
00:35:07.854 - 00:35:59.662, Speaker A: But as a basis, we allow these more capital efficient trading activities to happen. So if you have many different options altogether, maybe again, straddle call j laser, short term, all of those have different capital requirements. This could move, in theory, ten e worth of notional value, at least this is 2.5 e worth of notional value and 5500 die. But because of that capital efficiency you borrow and the net that you have to supply as a seller or a trader is 1000 die. One fifth of that, and also a bit more, but less than one e, so you can actually be more capital efficient, because you don't have to source your own eth and die. You just have to have enough to cover the worst case scenarios, and that is going to allow you to have more capital free.
00:35:59.662 - 00:36:27.160, Speaker A: You don't want to be 100% utilized if you want. You want to be 30% to 50%, but that buffer allows you to react if you need to. So that's kind of the capital efficiency you see in tradfi options. And then we also build this from the protocol level in our defi options. That was a lot, I guess. I went over penoptics, how it works, how it's actually kind of managed. Capital efficiency was a big part.
00:36:27.160 - 00:36:55.994, Speaker A: It's also options. I don't know how many of you are options, but it's a difficult field to get into. Again, what we want to do is to replicate the Uniswap model again. This is also called Cornell, my alma mater, but I would found a protocol where any person can trade options on any asset. So, in uniswap, the protocol allows you to list any pair. No one's stopping you. If you lp in a meme coin and lose everything in your shirt.
00:36:55.994 - 00:37:15.110, Speaker A: It's not Uniswap's fault, it's just an infrastructure that's present. So, yes. Thanks, Aaron. So the key point is that there's a similar ethos, I guess, of defi. There's a similar maybe method that I like, which is we also create a permissionless protocol. Anyone can trade, anyone can do what they want. They are in charge of the risks, and if they get degree, it's their fault.
00:37:15.110 - 00:37:46.306, Speaker A: And also, we want to create something that is a little bit more user friendly. So this is eta delta. So those that may be and may have been around for more than five years, this was the state of the art in terms of trading in 2017. Order book, based on chain, you sign transactions, you put liquidity, remove liquidity, all of those required, like, dozens of signatures. And that kind of worked, but didn't gain traction. Uniswap came in, made it very simple and elegant. Two boxes, token one, token two.
00:37:46.306 - 00:38:08.614, Speaker A: You just swap. Don't even have to worry about market orders or limit orders or stop losses. It's all kind of handled by this automated market maker. Similarly, if you look at options in Tradfi, this is TD Ameritrade's options order book. It's actually a mess. Again, there's a lot of numbers. Some of them are with delta or probably in the money.
00:38:08.614 - 00:38:43.646, Speaker A: This is something that the user may not know. Percent decimals, what the hell is this even this is like concatenated tables. You can expand tables more and more like Excel spreadsheet worth of data and it's actually daunting if you want to start. And that again if you are experienced, makes sense. But in the first few times or even first year, it's hard to just penetrate this. That's why we are also using a much simpler interface that is based on these kind of visualization tools where you don't have to worry about spreads or iv. It's all kind of given to you by the pool.
00:38:43.646 - 00:39:00.390, Speaker A: In that case, it's a very visual way of creating your options. So this is what the interface looks like now. And this is going to be a demo. I'm going to do it now. I'll go back to that slide. I guess when we have questions, you can also try it out yourself. Beta panptic XYZ here.
00:39:00.390 - 00:39:28.798, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to show you the demo of the trading interface. This is going to be my own account and this is an account I'm trying to get liquidated for. So we've been running for almost three weeks now and this is the interface again. We are trying to do a trading competition just to get people motivated. And this is my dashboard. These are my positions. Yeah, leaderboard.
00:39:28.798 - 00:39:54.060, Speaker A: Okay, that's fine. So this is one position I created earlier today. This was done an hour ago. This is a butterfly. This is four legs, two puts, two calls, two short put, one put. All right, let's do this again. Is it going to crap on me? Wait.
00:39:54.060 - 00:40:17.816, Speaker A: Oh, no. Let's see if this goes. All right. So the key point, we're launched, we're on base, we're doing this in the ETH with DC pool. Lots of movement over the past couple of weeks. Actually, price went up, now it's back down. It's actually very dynamic.
00:40:17.816 - 00:40:41.564, Speaker A: We like it. So here's. Yes, I think I'm going to be able to make a trade here. This is the interface. You can start by selecting a strategy. So here we added a bunch, but you can create strategies from existing tradfi. You can buy a call, take a put, spread, create a ratio, spread, strangle.
00:40:41.564 - 00:41:19.632, Speaker A: So again, if you're neutral, can say, I'm going to buy a straddle or strangle. And this is what the payoff looks like for that position. So this is buying a 1700 put and buying a 2100 call. I don't know if the price is going to move there so I can actually interact with the interface and move it to where I want it to be. So in that case can buy two add the money options and again it's 219 23 puts and calls. I know from that payoff that if the price goes above about 2004, I make money, or if it goes below about 1840, I make money as well. Current price is 1930.
00:41:19.632 - 00:41:56.276, Speaker A: So that is again very easy to use, very easy to manipulate and create exactly the payoff you want to create. It's not just buying put options or call options. Again, you can create put spreads and this is how you can limit your risk. So again, selling a put is what you do now in uniswap, you move liquidity. The best way to limit your risk is to buy a protective put as well. You pay a little bit but you have a limited downside. So again, a lot of what you can do in Tratfi you can also do in panoptic by combining these multi legged positions.
00:41:56.276 - 00:42:34.532, Speaker A: And we can go very simple. You can also create perp like products. There's a put call parity that allows you to create a one to one short position that uses a long put and a short call. The key point is you can do this as forex leverage because of that capital efficiency. So you can short forex perps in panoptic on any assets you want. You can also go long as well in a forex manner, any token. So again it's whitelisted and gated now for the gated launch and eventually it's going to be open.
00:42:34.532 - 00:43:09.004, Speaker A: So anyone can trade an in asset. So here, let me create this long per, let's go short perp. I think it's going to keep going down. I'm going to create a short per position and the contract size is going to be, don't want to lose my shirt. This is going to be requiring me. Wait, what is it? Yeah, $1.8. So anyways, the buying power is about thirteen cents.
00:43:09.004 - 00:43:33.050, Speaker A: So it's a small position. I'm shorting the ETH price and now we can go and I can actually confirm it. And once this is confirmed it's going to show on my interface. And again, hopefully I'm going to make money. But as I mentioned, this account goal is to lose as much money to be liquidated. So maybe it's going to go in the right direction. So that's kind of the idea.
00:43:33.050 - 00:43:56.976, Speaker A: Let me confirm that transaction. And it's on base so you can actually see the transactions. All the codes is open sourced. So this confirms. So it should show here on my main page. Yeah, there we go. So I have a short perp already made 39 USDC and that's it.
00:43:56.976 - 00:44:25.180, Speaker A: So again, very unique, very new way of trading options. This is mostly retail focused. This is where folks like you guys probably will be more at home. The most sophisticated traders can trade with an SDK on the API or whatnot. So in that case, it's going to be very open to all. So yeah, I think on that note, I'll edit here and yeah, I'd be happy to answer questions. We can go back to interface or back to the slides anytime.
00:44:25.180 - 00:45:13.276, Speaker A: I just have one probably pretty quick question. So at the beginning you said it was based on uniswap. Is this like a wrapper around Uniswap, or does this actually require changes to the actual Uniswap internals to support the core functionality? So it's a wrapper on top. So we are tapping into Uniswap's existing liquidity. So the ETH USDC pool that is treated now may have $100 million worth of liquidity. I can sell options in that pool and again, be sure that the price will be hard to manipulate, even though I'm selling tiny option. So we lean into Uniswap again, could be pancake swap.
00:45:13.276 - 00:46:04.604, Speaker A: It's a one to one fork of Uniswap. There's some change that need to be done so that you can adapt. But yeah, the ethos is that we build on top and rather to fork away and how to attract liquidity. One question that I had for the UI, which first of all, super sick, really cool when it comes to projecting the payoffs, does that use the premium or how does that actually project the payoffs? Is that assuming something about the implied volatility and how much premiums are you going to? I can go back to my if I were to create a put option and mint it, it's not collecting any fund. So this one's actually pretty good. So it's using the real accumulated premium. And when you monitor existing positions, you look at the realized one that's being accumulated.
00:46:04.604 - 00:46:25.460, Speaker A: Again, I got $0.28. Awesome. Out of that position. If you were to create a new position, then yes, we have to assume some model of the iv and then black shoes kind of works. But then the iv is a bit arbitrary. So that's why in that case, in theory, I'm making like already 10% from the get go. So yes, we assume 40% iv.
00:46:25.460 - 00:46:56.316, Speaker A: And the width of that position has some impact on the payoff as well. So this is similar to a three DTE option. Again, it's a competition that warrants weekly. That range here that I'm dragging, you expect that range. The position being ranged between, what, two to three days before it moves. The past few days were extremely volatile, so it did move up to 25 back there. But yes, we will show it in a way that is less misleading.
00:46:56.316 - 00:47:19.704, Speaker A: But yes, currently we are estimating it based on the 40% annualized iv. Very cool. I saw you guys have code for arena starting next week, right? Yeah. We are taking security very seriously. We did a first audit with open zeppelin. We did one a little bit more technical with ABDK. This is a firm that also audited the Uniswap code base.
00:47:19.704 - 00:47:37.056, Speaker A: We're doing code arena. We didn't think about it, so I announced it so that it was going to be black Friday, but they don't do it over the holidays, so it will start next Monday. So the 27th is when we open it up. And just some details. It's all open source. You can have a look. It's a pretty large code base.
00:47:37.056 - 00:48:32.860, Speaker A: We're splitting it in half. So the first half is the more mechanical, easier to audit component, which is kind of moving liquidity. Very simple. And the second half is the liquidation engine and the collateralization and the leverage part, which is going to be probably going on for like, two weeks and stuff, so that we don't throw everyone to the wolf. There's a lot of code there. I have a question, not related to tech, but are you applying this, everything you just presented just on crypto, or are you also going to apply to traditional financing, stock trading? Maybe that's the beauty of the corn futures. Whether they are traded in a pit with guys shouting or electronically, or maybe on an order book based model on a blockchain or an amm, you don't care as a farmer, you just want to get your conference.
00:48:32.860 - 00:49:07.800, Speaker A: So, yes, I think that's my hope, is that this is removing the market making component and making it irrelevant. So you don't have to trust a market maker to take risk. The pricing is organically determined by the chain. The inventory is kind of always in use. So, yes, I think that the pipe dream is that the same way we saw a transition from guys shouting in a pit to electronic. We'll see electronic to blockchain based automated market making, perhaps. And that will mean that we don't have to be limiting ourselves to crypto assets.
00:49:07.800 - 00:49:47.400, Speaker A: Although I'd be happy to buy puts on Shiba Inu or calls on the meme coins, but yes, it's making it easier and making it like it's a perpetual option. It's a different way, but I think in a better way in many senses. So did you start just from crypto or did you actually learn start trading on option on stock? I'm sorry, personal question. Yeah, I started on the options. So I was big into d five. At the same time I got into DFI, I got into options a little bit, and I'm mostly selling options in tradfi and I was a huge lp. I managed hundreds of positions myself in uniswap b three.
00:49:47.400 - 00:50:23.716, Speaker A: And I saw the analogy, someone that would only buy options, perhaps would not see the link, but yet my own portfolio in tradfi is exclusively options. And my whole portfolio up to recently in DeFi was exclusively LPNG. Providing liquidity in uniswap is the front end open source code, because I'd hate to not be able to play around with the UI. It does look really slick. Yeah. So if I disconnect, you can actually go on now and disconnect and use it. Even though you cannot connect, you can go on the trade page and you can mint, or at least pretend to mint positions, it's still going to allow you to do it.
00:50:23.716 - 00:50:58.290, Speaker A: So that's kind of how we can onboard and show what people are missing out. And overall, if you are savvy enough, you can create your own script, your own node, you can go on ether scan. Even the part that's tricky is that once the contracts are deployed, we could walk away and it works. And that's kind of how we can disintegrate the risk. We say we don't give it in control and someone can access it. So on easecan, you can actually input the right amount and mint a position as well in ether scan, but us, we cannot make it easier. So that's the part.
00:50:58.290 - 00:51:34.860, Speaker A: That's right. I was asking the lawyer, me as a founder can actually use it and he said no, but then they won't go after an individual if they catch me using it, they're going to go after the company that gave it to me and not the user. They cannot sue individuals, or at least it's not worthwhile. They sue the provider. So again, we'll see. But, yeah, I had a question. Could you talk about maybe like the downsides, providing liquidity to the panoptic pool versus providing it to the uniswap pool? Yeah.
00:51:34.860 - 00:52:01.316, Speaker A: So the downside, there's leverage and there's more risk. You can lose more than you put in. So if that happens, you'll get liquidated, and you end up losing all of it. So that's the big component. In a case of in options, you can also be a bit more careful. Again, you can create spreads that tells you exactly how much you can lose. Here, you can lose at most $.6,
00:52:01.316 - 00:52:30.412, Speaker A: you can make 0.6. You can lose at most one. So that is very easy to define. But yes, if it's a naked position like you have in panoptic, you can lose quite a bit. The other one is that the PLP, the passive liquidity providers, could get exposed if there's a large price drop. So lunar, for instance, the price of lunar token, collapsed in five minutes, like 90%. And there should be a liquidation system happening.
00:52:30.412 - 00:53:11.290, Speaker A: There should be kind of ways to manage this, but if it happens too quickly and no one can catch this falling knife, the PLPs, those that deposited some ETH in that ETH Luna pool, will get exposed in a way that is like impermanent loss. So they would lose their ETH as collateral, even though they didn't trade, because the whole pool went bust. So that's kind of the two. And we'll have to also communicate this very efficiently. But, yeah, that's the two risks mainly that we see with that. Sweet. We're pretty much at time.
00:53:11.290 - 00:53:13.910, Speaker A: Thank you for your time, Guillaume. Sure.
