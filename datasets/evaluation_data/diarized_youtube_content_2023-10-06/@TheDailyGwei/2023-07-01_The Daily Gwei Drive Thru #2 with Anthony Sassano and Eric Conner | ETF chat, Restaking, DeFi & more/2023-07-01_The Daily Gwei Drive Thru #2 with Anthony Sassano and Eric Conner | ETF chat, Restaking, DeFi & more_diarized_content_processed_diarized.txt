00:00:00.520 - 00:00:12.034, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the daily grade drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and I'm here today with Eric Conner to walk you through everything that happened in the ethereum ecosystem over the last two weeks. Hey, Eric, how you going?
00:00:12.934 - 00:00:15.806, Speaker B: Anthony, nice to be back. Thanks for having me back.
00:00:15.990 - 00:00:20.754, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, for sure. As we said, we weren't going to rug this time, right. We're going to make this a regular thing.
00:00:21.334 - 00:00:32.874, Speaker B: We've got two, which I think is we're in non rugged territory, but yeah, I think we're going to try to do every two weeks ish. Summer is a little tricky with travel and stuff, but that's. That's the goal at least.
00:00:33.294 - 00:01:03.846, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, well, yeah, I mean, we can get straight into it. I think the biggest stuff that happened, I mean, I think it's been like maybe three weeks since we did the last, last podcast, was all this talk about like, these ETF's, right? These kind of like bitcoin ETF's that are, that are kind of coming on the radar again. And all these big institutions like Blackrock and fidelity issuing, um, applications for ETF's. And we've seen this, this before, you know, plenty of times before. Obviously, it was a main narrative during the last bull market, but none of them ever got approved. And I'm talking spot ETF's here.
00:01:03.846 - 00:01:44.694, Speaker A: The futures and kind of ETF's get approved because they're separate products, they're basically derivative products, whereas the spot ETF's just haven't. And because of this, we saw the consequence of everyone piling into things like Grayscale, GBTC and EFE, which are inferior products because they're basically a one way bridge. There is no way to redeem. So they trade at a discount pretty often. And I think they went as deep as a 40% discount. I believe GBTC of this, it was nicknamed the widowmaker trade because there's a lot of funds that actually piled into this thing. And if you actually trace back why all the funds and things blew up like they did in 2022, it can actually be traced back to GBTC.
00:01:44.694 - 00:02:38.034, Speaker A: So really, if the SEC had just approved one of these spot ETF's, we probably would never have gotten such a inferior product that the SEC approved, by the way, which is just weird to me, that led to a lot of the blow ups in crypto. Now, I'm not saying it's the only reason, but it was definitely a big reason. But that's just some context for people listening in game that may not know about that, but yeah, I guess, like, what's your general take on this ETF stuff? Like, is it, is it different this time around? Like, obviously Blackrock is a lot bigger than, well, he is the biggest player in the tradfi space, right? So obviously they put them, putting their weight behind this is, is pretty big. But the timing is also pretty interesting as well because it came basically a few days after the SEC sued Coinbase and binance. So, yeah, just because I know, obviously you've been in the tradfi world for people who know, who know you, you're in the tradfi world. Like how, how big is this? Like, is it actually something that's different? Like, is this time different? Or are we just going to say everything get rejected again?
00:02:38.774 - 00:03:29.590, Speaker B: I think it's actually different. And this is funny because we, if people list were into the ether listeners, like, we talked about ETF so many times, and I think I want to say, I said it was like four or five years away and this was back in like 18, right? So we're there, right? We're within that window. I really do think this time it's different. And I, you mentioned it, like, the timing is interesting and I think that's the biggest takeaway here. I think this is a little bit of a signal from these institutions, right, where they're kind of saying to these politicians, hey, back off a little bit, right? Like, we see money to be made here. We want to get involved in crypto. You shouldn't have all the power to, like, say that crypto can't be a thing in the US, right? So I think it's very intentional that Blackrock came out within a week after the Coinbase and binance being sued by SEC News and say, hey, we want to do an ETF, and then Fidelity follows.
00:03:29.590 - 00:04:10.604, Speaker B: Like, all the big players are coming out. And I think one of the things you really have to realize about us politics and politics everywhere, but especially us politics, is these guys are kind of the puppet masters, right? Not in like a conspiracy theory way, but they're paying the bills. Like, if you go look at like the Blackrock CEO, Fidelity CEO, like, follow the trails of donation money, like these guys get things through. I think I saw that Blackrock's historical record of ETF approvals is like 491 or something like that. So like, is Gensler gonna step in the way here? I don't think so. I think this is it. And then to see the fight fidelity follow up, you know, and people want to say, when's the ETH ETF? If you're in an institution, go with the brand first.
00:04:10.604 - 00:04:29.988, Speaker B: Right. It makes sense to me. Like, we might disagree that bitcoin should have the number one brand, but like it does right now, and it's the easiest one to kind of get through. They don't want to like throw Ethan there and some other alts and confuse things. So I think if this does get approved, we'll quickly see an ETH follow. But I think it's time. I really do.
00:04:29.988 - 00:04:45.704, Speaker B: The market's mature enough. We're seeing two x future ETF's of bitcoin be approved. The spot ETF gets disapproved twice. With fidelity and Blackrock. It's like something really shadies up. But I think it's time.
00:04:46.164 - 00:05:19.516, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Just as you said, there's that signal being sent right now. And I think that the market kind of reacted obviously positively to this. But then it came out yesterday that Saylor bought another two $300 million worth of BTC, which at around 28,000, which could also explain, you know, the pump. So it's kind of hard to know what the short term movements are based on. Obviously it was a BTC led rally because the ETH BTC ratio went down and a lot of the other coins didn't really do much. So people pointed, oh yeah, you know, this is BTC rallying ahead of the ETF approval.
00:05:19.516 - 00:05:51.120, Speaker A: It's like yes and no. I think that the ETF applications, you know, are kind of like they're positive but they're not bringing in new money yet. Right. Even from non kind of like ETF money. Basically people buying BTC just on coinbase or whatever. So really you have the same money sloshing around and you could argue that the biggest new money coming in is probably just selling microstrategy stock and then using that money to buy BTC. But other than that, I'm not seeing much of any new money coming in right now.
00:05:51.120 - 00:06:26.634, Speaker A: And I think that's what people don't get, is that the price can probably retrace its entire pump before back down to the price it was at the time of these ETF applications. But that has no bearing on if the ETF's are bullish or bearish. What it signals is that theres just the same amount of money sloshing around. Its just traders trying to make some money off the volatility and eventually that will change and eventually well have a proper change where it becomes a bull market instead of a bear market. Or a crab market, I guess, what were in right now. But thats, I think, what a lot of people kind of miss there. And you mentioned that an ETF would probably come after a BTC one.
00:06:26.634 - 00:07:15.108, Speaker A: I mean, I definitely think so. And the funny thing about an ETH ETF, or just like institutionalized ETH products generally is that staking actually has a big part to play here because I think that ETH as an asset is just much more attractive to, I guess, like the tradfi investors because of that yield you can get. Even though the yield obviously keeps going lower because more people are staking, it's still quite, quite a healthy yield. And obviously in the bull market, when activity ramps up again, there will be more rewards like fee rewards and Mev rewards and stuff like that as well. So I think that's going to be very attractive to people. But in terms of like, other things, getting ETF's is probably going to be like, not this cycle, maybe next cycle there might be some standouts. But the problem is, is that like with a lot of these things and the way tradfi looks at it, they need regulatory clarity.
00:07:15.108 - 00:07:51.858, Speaker A: And really only BTC has that. Today, ETH is in this limbo where the SEC still maintains that it's a security, but this EFTC says it's a commodity. Obviously, we both believe that it is not a security. And I think that generally it's probably not ever going to be labeled officially security. I don't think the SEC is actually going to try and go after ETH, but it does scare away players. Right? It does scare away these tradfi institutions. But I think ironically, what could happen is that they might file for ETF's and then if those get approved, if the SEC approves those, it's basically them saying, well, this isn't a security because as far as I know, the way it works is that you can't approve an ETF for an unregistered security.
00:07:51.858 - 00:08:26.204, Speaker A: That would just be really silly for the SEC to do. And yeah, as I said, the other ones, the other kind of tokens out there, very hard for them, I think. And you put out a tweet, actually, that I wanted to talk about. This was a little while ago, maybe a few days ago or something, where you basically said that you think this could potentially be like an ETH BTC led bull run, where a lot of the other coins basically lag and we don't get a repeat of what happened in 2021 and maybe even 2017. I kind of have a little bit of a different view on that. But maybe you want to expand on that view and why you think that it could just be Ethan BTC and all of these other things will lag.
00:08:27.144 - 00:08:48.754, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think it circles back a little bit. Going back to your point of why haven't we seen the rally yet? If we think the ETF's going to be approved, why haven't we really seen that in the charts? A lot of that's going to come after the fact. Right. Which is kind of what you were saying. Everyone's talked about ETF's at this point. If you're in crypto now, you probably found a way to get crypto.
00:08:48.754 - 00:09:00.018, Speaker B: People that want an ETF, they want to open their fidelity account, their e trade account, whatever their brokerage account, and just type BTC into their ticker box to buy. And it's there.
00:09:00.066 - 00:09:00.346, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:00.410 - 00:09:10.050, Speaker B: The ETf's there. If you go look at the gold chart, once a gold ETF got approved, I think it shot up from 400 to 2000 or something like that.
00:09:10.082 - 00:09:10.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:10.250 - 00:09:33.370, Speaker B: And it's never been back to that price before. So if you look at like BTC or ETH, let's take BTC, whatever the high is, 70,000 or something like that. I can't quite remember, somewhere around there, say at four exits from there it never goes back to 70,000. But that's because people now have access to it. They want to buy it either in their 401K, with their broker, whatever. Like they don't want to go on Coinbase and buy. I don't blame them.
00:09:33.370 - 00:09:49.498, Speaker B: They might feel like it's a little shady or the media makes them feel like that. Right. So I don't think an ETF rally will happen until after the ETF. And we see that a lot. Right. In general with like e staking, remember phase zero, like the bullet market happened after that hit and went live.
00:09:49.546 - 00:09:49.802, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:49.858 - 00:10:34.278, Speaker B: So I really think the ETF rally will be after that. And so kind of going back to my tweet a little bit, I don't think like it'll be as in no alt will rally. But I do think if we really, because the last, the meme in the last bull market was institutionalized money, right. Well if were talking real money coming in and its not real money as in one big player, talk about millions and millions of people want access to this stuff again in their 401K or brokerage, that adds up very quickly. And we havent seen that influx of money yet. If those rally, those big inflows are going to be coming from ETF approved or stamp of approval coins. Trust me, I dont like this.
00:10:34.278 - 00:10:55.214, Speaker B: I dont think a government should be able to just say, hey, we think BTC is great, give a stamp of approval, fidelity can trade it, blah, blah, blah. I don't like this. But it is. Sometimes you got to just take the reality of the market, right. And I think the flows will come in there. Now, of course as people make money there, they get involved in crypto, they might go chase alts. That will always happen.
00:10:55.214 - 00:11:29.194, Speaker B: But I think maybe for the first time, I think ever, we might see like a dive in the ratios between like a BTC and ETH and alt rally. Right. Like they might actually rally a little stronger than alts. I mean, last cycle was crazy with the alt layer ones and all this stuff going up exponentially and kind of outpacing BTC and ETH. And of course ETH is outpaced BTC for a while now, but I think every market's a little different. I just think there's going to be a hint of that is kind of what I'm trying to say.
00:11:30.174 - 00:11:53.134, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think it really depends on who the kind of marginal buyer of crypto is. Right. Like if the marginal buyer, if most of the inflows is coming from like the ETF's and the trad five institutions, then they're definitely not going down the risk curve, right. Going BTC and probably ETH as well. And they're going to kind of stop there. It's really these kind of like alt rallies that we see are really kind of a retail trader driven phenomenon.
00:11:53.134 - 00:12:25.638, Speaker A: And then we have some crypto native funds and stuff join in as well. And we obviously see how that ended in 2022 where everything blew up. But my opinion, I think, I mean, I agree mostly with you, but my opinion differs a little bit wherein that I don't know if this cycle will be the one where the institutions outweigh the retail. I still think that retail is going to have a definite big presence during the next bull market. I think that they're still going to have plenty of access to things. I mean, Coinbase and binance are still there. They haven't delisted these assets that the SEC claims are securities.
00:12:25.638 - 00:12:52.374, Speaker A: I know other platforms have, but there are these tradfi platforms that added crypto just to be part of, I guess, like the flavor of the month, basically back in 2021. And they've delisted these things. But I think that Coinbase is going to be pushing people to their new base. L two as well. And that's going to get a lot of people just playing around with different tokens and things like that. So I definitely do think we going to see those rallies still happen. But we all know what happens when the liquidity kind of dries up and we go into a bear market.
00:12:52.374 - 00:13:32.424, Speaker A: Again, everything just absolutely nukes against BTC and ETH. Like, there is very rarely a token that will actually outperform BTC and ETH over the long term. I think I can think of maybe one that's outperformed ETH over the long term. And that's Rocketpool, the RPL token that's been out since 2017. But that's one out of how many of these things have we seen come and go over the years, right? When it comes to these rallies? Yeah, they can. They can happen, I think, in bull markets because of that retail participation. But yes, it's going to be the same story still, where if you're stuck holding these things, you know, one to two years after the bull market, there is more likely than not you're never making your money back in probably USD, but also against Ethan BTC.
00:13:32.424 - 00:14:36.288, Speaker A: And especially if we have that more traditional finance kind of type person involved with crypto, just buying BTC and ETH indiscriminately, basically through these ETF's, then yeah, it's definitely going to going to be a wind change there. But I do think that retail participation in crypto is still going to be very, very strong. People go down the risk curve, as you say, they make money in BTC and ETH and they go down the risk curve. But I also think that a lot of people, especially in like the peak bull market, like three to six months, the last three to six months of a bull market, the marginal buyer is clueless people, right? They're just people who have come in via watching crypto on YouTube or hearing about it on mainstream media, and they're like, oh, wow, what do I buy? And then a youtuber tells them to buy this coin because it's going to some ridiculous price and they buy it, right? And then the players who've been around for a while will trade around this, obviously, chase the pumps, look at the charts, basically do ta on this or whatever. But that's why you see most of these things underperformed, because most of them are generally not supposed to be worth anything because they're just crap. They're part of crap projects. And the projects are like, a lot of the time the projects are dead and their tokens are still worth something for some reason, but that's just crypto.
00:14:36.336 - 00:14:44.232, Speaker B: But, like, last cycle, EOS popped all the way back to its previous cycle high, like, at the very end. Like the last month of the bull cycle.
00:14:44.368 - 00:15:03.896, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. And that was only against USD, against Ethan BTC. It definitely didn't get close. And I think that signal, though, during a bull market where if you. When you start seeing these things that are so obviously dead popping back off, it means that the liquidity is very close to running out. It means that everyone is going down and just seeing what hasn't pumped yet. Because, like, oh, this hasn't pumped yet.
00:15:03.896 - 00:15:24.284, Speaker A: It means we've got to plow into this to pump it. And that is usually, from my experience over the last two markets that I've been part of. I know you've been a part of three of them, actually. Technically, I've been a part of three of them, but you kind of stuck around in the 2014 bear market. But that is basically the clearest signal ever, is when people are just going down the risk curve to absolute crap, and it's pumping. It's time to get out.
00:15:24.784 - 00:16:10.076, Speaker B: Right, exactly. So it's an interesting topic. Right? Because you said, and I totally agree, like, retail will always be there and probably, as a combined entity, outweigh institutions. So a question would be, I'm curious, your thoughts on this. Do you think retail has chased shitcoins, let's put it that way. Whatever you want to call them in the past, because they log in, they hear about Ethan BTC, and they're presented with all these things on these exchanges because they can't buy them in their brokerage accounts or their normal investments accounts. Do you think potentially because they would have access to, like, a bitcoin ETF and ETH ETF in their normal accounts that they won't go to coinbase binance to buy? You know what I mean? Do they go there and they're like, it's like.
00:16:10.076 - 00:16:19.824, Speaker B: Like a candy store, and they're like, oh, I should buy eight of these, you know, instead of just the core two that I really like. That'll be the most interesting, I think, dynamic as we approach this.
00:16:20.284 - 00:16:45.148, Speaker A: I think so. And, I mean, everyone has their own anecdotal experiences with their real life friends and family who talk to them about crypto. And then you wonder how they even heard of this coin, right? Sometimes they'll mention a coin to you and you'd be like, what? I'd never heard of that before. So I think you're right. There is definitely a huge element of people going to these exchanges and seeing this candy store and just buying whatever looks good. A lot of the time it's whatever's cheap. Cheap being the coin price, not the market cap.
00:16:45.236 - 00:16:50.628, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, that's, that's the number one. Oh, this is the cheapest. If it goes to bitcoin price, I'll be a gazillionaire.
00:16:50.716 - 00:17:21.258, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So there is a huge element of that. But I think that the mainstream media and just media in general and crypto media, like crypto youtubers, they play a huge part for sure in a lot of this stuff because during a bull market they get a lot of viewers. You know, some of these guys, they get hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views on their videos. And these videos basically will highlight one coin or a bunch of coins and run through the bull case for them, which is usually just the narrative of the month for each of these things. And then they'll say, this is going to this price. And you know, basically here's where you can buy it and here's my referral link.
00:17:21.258 - 00:17:40.076, Speaker A: So maybe because of that dynamic where these exchanges don't have these coins on them, it will be harder for people to buy them. But as I said, coinbase is launching their own l two, which will have all of the coins on there. All of the tokens, at least. Not that. Probably not the coins, but you know, the tokens. Right. The ERC 20 tokens and ETH and stuff like that.
00:17:40.076 - 00:18:14.210, Speaker A: So Coinbase will obviously say, hey, we don't have this thing here, but you can go buy it on base. And Coinbase obviously still benefits from that, from people going to base. It's like what binance did with BSC. So it's just basically the coinbase's version of BSC. So I think that that dynamic is still going to exist because of that. But yeah, it'll be definitely curious to see how muted it is compared to last cycle because there maybe isn't that candy store because we all know that, that a lot of the things that pump in bull markets are new things, right? The old things, theyre old, theyre boomer, we dont care about them. And theres new flashy coins on the market.
00:18:14.210 - 00:19:02.054, Speaker A: But if those things arent getting added to centralized exchanges because of regulations or whatever other reason, will they actually pump as much? And I think the argument, as you said to be made is they probably wont, especially if theyre not easily accessible on base because theyre a coin of another l one or another blockchain where you have to bridge it across the trade and people arent really going to do that. I think that there is definitely going to be a big element of that. And maybe the optimist in me thinks that we won't see another alt l one season because I'm so sick of these other l one s and these Ethereum killers getting attention and making everything so noisy. When you and I both know, and a lot of people that have been in Ethereum for a while know that pretty much all of them are going to be useless, right? No one's going to be using them after the bull market and they're going to fade into irrelevancy. So yeah, it's going to be curious to see how that all plays out for sure.
00:19:05.174 - 00:19:34.878, Speaker B: Yeah, no, definitely. I mean, I think people think, oh, I had this coin. Like it's going to pump this next cycle. Like you should go check some old charts, right? Look at the EOS chart, look at all these charts. And I think, I don't know what happened last cycle. I think a lot of it had to do with like SPF and FTX and pumping some of these alt L2 narratives, right. But you always get a new narrative in the new cycle, right? So I think personally it's going to be around the ETF's and these kind of regulatory approved coins.
00:19:34.878 - 00:20:30.274, Speaker B: But I mean, we're seeing one of the most interesting things as an american that I'm seeing is all of a sudden China has totally pivoted, right? We're seeing Hong Kong be totally open to crypto, like overnight. It's like, oh, you can buy bitcoin, ETH, there's ETF's like you can do everything with it. I mean, that clearly seems like some kind of political move. And I don't think it's a coincidence, right, that a few days later you saw these ETF's applied for in the US, right? And I think there's some pushback probably to, I mean, it's all politics, right? America is such 50 50 divided. If someone takes this stance, you have to take this stance, right? So now all of a sudden, crypto has become this like battleground. But I do think, you know, China, when it comes to the US right there, whatever you want to call them, I guess you call them enemies. I don't know what the proper term is, but definitely political opponents is probably the right way.
00:20:30.274 - 00:20:39.354, Speaker B: But I actually do think China taking this stance to pro crypto all of a sudden will actually help when it comes to american regulations.
00:20:39.934 - 00:21:15.662, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And I actually like, that it's become such an issue in american politics because, like, even though it's so divided, it means that we don't just have, like the Democrats attacking crypto, right. And saying it's all crap and trying to destroy it. We actually have another side that's fighting for. And I think that, I know it's kind of annoying for Americans because depending on their politics, they may not side with like Republicans on, on things, but the crypto thing is like a big thing for them, right? You may. And that it's so weird that like Democrats are against crypto, uh, when they're supposed to be progressive. I don't, I don't know the ins and outs of american politics that well.
00:21:15.662 - 00:21:53.010, Speaker A: But from the outside looking in, it does strike me as a bit weird. But then I look deeper and I'm like, Democrats, like the banks, they say they don't, but they definitely do. Um, so I don't know, like, personally, I don't consider myself like a one issue voter. I probably wouldn't vote just based on the crypto issue. But that's, again, why I like, it's a battleground thing because if the Republicans can push the Democrats to be friendlier, then it means that people in crypto don't have to be one issue voters. Because I think that that's probably the worst outcome for Americans is that they're just forced to vote for someone that they otherwise just didn't want to vote for at all just because of that one issue that obviously affects them quite deeply. So we'll have to see how that plays out.
00:21:53.010 - 00:22:14.650, Speaker A: But yeah, the China stuff's interesting. Europe as well as being very friendly, East Asia generally is pretty friendly. India I think is warming up to it. But I think during the bear market and the crowd market, you just see more regulatory stuff than the bull market because in the bull market, everyones having fun. No one wants the regulator coming in in the bull market and spoiling the fun. Right. Im ruining the party.
00:22:14.650 - 00:22:37.998, Speaker A: Whereas the regulator is like, okay, well wait till the partys ruined. Wait till the partys over. Theyll ruin it themselves and then well come in and start doing some stuff. I tweeted the other week that I think the regulatory kind of bottom is in. To be honest, I don't really see any more kind of like harsh things coming down the pipeline. I think the SEC is pretty stretched in at this point in terms of who they're going after and the battles that they're fighting. But hopefully I'm not wrong on that.
00:22:37.998 - 00:23:02.872, Speaker A: Hopefully we don't wake up next week to SEC for some reason, battling and going after ETH or something, which is an interesting discussion in of itself, because I've had this discussion with people before. Who would the SEC even go after? Right. Like, the closest company to, like, ETH as an asset and Ethereum as a thing in the US is consensus. But consensus didn't issue ETH. It didn't. It wasn't even around at the time of the ICO. It was formed after it.
00:23:02.872 - 00:23:28.680, Speaker A: It doesn't control Ethereum. So who would they go after? Vitalik, he's not a us citizen. Right. Um, there are some co founders that are. But going after someone personally is, is not usually something that the SEC will do, and that's not how they, they win. So in my mind, the SEC can't go off to anyone, right. They accept the exchanges trading these things, and this is something that people missed, is that the SEC is not going after, like, Polygon or Solana or Cardano in their lawsuits.
00:23:28.680 - 00:24:01.454, Speaker A: They're going after Coinbase and binance for trading these things that they claim are unregistered securities. So for them to actually go after the issuing company is quite difficult. And a lot of the times they do it, and it's an american company or something based in the US, but if it's not in the US, it's very hard for them to actually go after the company that issued it. And in Ethereum's case, it was a foundation, was the Ethereum foundation, which from memory is based in Switzerland. Right, or based out of Switzerland. So it has nothing to do with the US. But, yeah, it'll be interesting to see if they ever did go after ETH, which I think they won't, but if they did, like, who would they actually go after? Right?
00:24:02.314 - 00:24:25.322, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I guess all of us validating or something, they're going to chase 200 or whatever. What are we, up to, 600,000 people or something validating on the Ethereum network? No, I mean, it's a good point. I think people miss that. Like, it's not necessarily that because they're saying a certain coin in the lawsuit is an unregistered security. Like, they're just trying to go after these exchanges for whatever reason. Power play.
00:24:25.322 - 00:25:00.330, Speaker B: But if you really break it down, right, like, they probably got buddies at banks and brokerage firms that are saying, hey, we want a piece of this pie. Like, it all, if you start to think about this, it's like they're going after these small exchanges and all of a sudden Blackrock and fidelity are like, okay, we want an ETF. Like, come on. There's definitely some patting on the back happening here. I think we. You can all kind of see through the lines. But no, I mean, it's interesting, actually, a topic I kind of wanted to transition to a little bit because last time we talked on here, what was it, three weeks ago or something like that, we weren't too far away from withdrawals being enabled.
00:25:00.330 - 00:25:29.210, Speaker B: We were talking, like, about the queue and stuff. And, I mean, we're just kind of exponentially going up on these stakes. I think if you go back to some of our original, into the ether episodes, talking about how much we think would be staked, I was saying around ten to 20 million max. And I think we just broke through that 20 million ETH stakes a couple days ago. I think we're at like 20.3 million or something like that, last I looked. And it doesn't seem to be slowing down.
00:25:29.210 - 00:26:07.046, Speaker B: I mean, the deposit queues at 40 days, 30, 40 days, the exit queues at zero. You can basically get out at any time. And yield, I think yield. Like, if I had to average out, I'm running Mev Boost, I think I'm like 6% or something, six to 7%, something in that range. But if you don't and you're just staking on rocket pool, lido and exchange, I think you're like three and a half to 4%. I'm curious, where do we think this will stop? At what point? Maybe this just keeps going. I know there's a point in the protocol where it starts to deter more stake, but I think it's up at 60, 70, 80 million.
00:26:07.046 - 00:26:39.874, Speaker B: I don't want to be quoted on that because I haven't really looked at that in a while, where the rewards start going down a little bit faster. But are we going to see this just driven down to two, 3% and see 40, 50 million east stake? Or do we think this is kind of like a level where this levels out? I don't know what to think. Like, I think bull market will change this a little bit. Like, if we run up to 1015 some point, like, people will probably withdraw some and sell, but it seems like. Like there's no stopping this wagon right now.
00:26:40.974 - 00:27:19.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of different kind of things, I think, that go into it. I mean, on the APR, the yield front, what people do, and I've noticed they do they take like a daily or weekly APR and they extrapolate that out to, like, the year, which doesn't really make much sense considering that gas fees and like mev payments play a big part in this. And obviously those things are going to be higher when activity is higher and that will affect the yield. And the yield is affected by a lot of different things. But that's the execution layer rewards and then you've got the consensus layer rewards, which obviously go up if less people stake. You know, if people withdraw it will go up, it'll go down if more people stake per validator. Um, so I think that the APR you kind of have to wait.
00:27:19.284 - 00:28:03.894, Speaker A: You might, you may be able to take like a month APR and extrapolate that out, but still it's kind of hard. And different services will give you different APR as well depending on a multitude of different factors, right. Like the, the effectiveness, the fee that they take if they're paying out token rewards. Uh, Rocketpool actually pays out RPL token rewards to, to stakers as well. So there, there are a number of different things that factor into yield, but I think generally its kind of hard to know where its going to stop because there is another big factor that plays into this, which is restaking from something like eigenlayer where essentially if, lets just say the vanilla eat staking yield goes to 1%, its really, really low or something. But you can get another 3% on Eigen layer if you restake your ETH. Effectively yes, youre adding more risk.
00:28:03.894 - 00:29:04.364, Speaker A: Yes youre not just an ethereum staker anymore, youre also an Eigen layer restaker. But effectively you would be getting 4%, 4% ETH denominated yield instead of the 1%. Theres been a blog post actually about this put out by someone called data. Always people can look that up. But effectively what it argues is that theres going to be so much e stake simply because that even though the vanilla stake yield is low because of these lsts, you can actually restake it with Eigen layer or you could go put it on a money market and draw against it and do whatever with it, even though the yield is quite low there. So I think the thing that im paying the most attention to is if thats actually going to happen, are we going to run it up to 60 70 million each state even though it makes no sense for it to be that high considering that the vanilla yield is quite low at that point? Or do we stop out somewhere and peter out somewhere and it just levels out at maybe 3% or something vanilla steak and then you get another 3% for eigen layer. But if youre approaching 6% ETH denominated yield, thats going to encourage more people to stake.
00:29:04.364 - 00:29:26.668, Speaker A: Thats a huge yield. And people forget that thats ETH denominator. That is not dollar denominated yield. ETH goes up. You were earning even more against the dollar because you've earned ETH rewards which are now worth more. And obviously taxes playing to this as well, which is another thing that gets thrown into it. So I think that trying to reason about this is very hard because there are a lot of assumptions you have to make and there are a lot of moving parts to it.
00:29:26.668 - 00:30:07.908, Speaker A: But generally I think that a staking is going to be up only for a while. That's, that's the conclusion that I've been at for a while is that I don't expect inflows of Ethan to staking to slow down anytime soon. But in terms of where that ETH stake goes, it's going to be interesting. I think a lot of it is definitely going to go into lsts for sure, because it's just a no brainer for people to do that because they want to be able to restake or they want to be able to put that into money markets. Restaking will be possible with, for solo validators as well, but it'll come at a later date, so it'll be interesting to see how the share happens there. But then there are other staking providers coming online as well that are doing things a little bit differently. And then they're going to be institutionalized staking products which probably won't have an LST attached to it.
00:30:07.908 - 00:30:38.504, Speaker A: But it begs to the question of like, okay, are these institutions going to work with existing providers? Are they going to become like a lido node operator or a rocket pool node operator? Or are they going to do it in house? I feel like regulatory wise, they're going to have to do it in house and have custody over the funds themselves or with a registered third party. But that's all, again, open question. So I think, yeah, when thinking about this, it's very hard because you just keep going down different rabbit holes and you come to different conclusions based on different assumptions.
00:30:39.524 - 00:31:23.708, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, even when we were talking about this a few years ago, we didn't think about the concept of restaking, right. I mean, we were barely even thinking about the idea of liquid staking derivatives then. So I do think like you were just saying, giving the solar solo stakers the ability to get involved in some of this stuff will be important, right. From like an Ethereum community protocol development layer, right? Like if not everyone's going to rush to lsds, right? And like be involved in that because it's easier. They're wrapped, you can do whatever you want with it, put it in lending protocols. I mean, this is one of the things, right? I think the new compound, v three. Yeah, v three, you could take like your staked ETH, lido ETH or whatever, like aave and use it as collateral, right, to borrow against.
00:31:23.708 - 00:31:29.572, Speaker B: Now this is like, or I think they have lido. Do they have rocket pool ETH on one of them?
00:31:29.588 - 00:31:36.724, Speaker A: I think one of them has rocket pool ETH. I think, yeah, they're slowly in the process of adding them all. It's obviously about liquidity and stuff like that, right?
00:31:36.844 - 00:32:22.974, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But like as a solo stake, you're like, okay, well, this, I'm kind of just like solo stake in fuck me, I guess I can't do anything. So like, it is when people are like, why are, why is so much money going into liquid staking derivatives and not into solo staking? Like this is something to consider, right? Not only can you earn additional yield, you can borrow against it, you can use it in defi. So these are all things to consider. Like if we want solo staking two floors to get bigger, these are things we need to think about and improve upon, right? So, yeah, I mean, it does seem like it's just going to keep going up. And when we're talking about this three, four years ago, we weren't even thinking about these derivatives that would happen. We were just saying, oh, we were thinking pure yield and you couldn't do anything with it.
00:32:22.974 - 00:32:59.218, Speaker B: We probably should have talked more about the idea of it being liquid, but we weren't. So it's just totally opened up this new gate. I think the most interesting thing is I would think most of these people staking this 20 million ETH probably aren't short term concerned about price action. Right? So you've got what, a 6th of all each supply kind of quote unquote locked up? Not really locked up, but people probably not really thinking of selling. I mean, if you really start breaking it down, not many people. Control is the wrong word. Like on a day to day basis, control the price of ETH.
00:32:59.218 - 00:33:39.714, Speaker B: Like there's just a little bit of ETH on an exchange and being traded that actually controls it. But yeah, I mean, as a solo staker myself, I hope people stop staking because I don't like my yield being ripped into. But I will say one cool thing of being a solo staker, that you don't get of being like, on an lsd is ran a block reward. So I've had some pretty sweet random, I mean, I'll get a blog that's like 0.01 and I've had some well over one ETH just completely random come in over the last few weeks. So, I mean, yeah, the bull market, I agree, we're quoting four, five, 6% right now. I mean, it could get pretty wild in a bull market.
00:33:39.714 - 00:34:08.326, Speaker B: One thing I've been thinking of recently, and I'm curious to get your thoughts on this, what do you think is going to drive on chain activity in the next bull? So two cycles ago, well, let's call it one and a half cycles ago, we had Defi, we had nfts. What are your thoughts around you think those are going to be revived? There's always something that clogs the chain. And besides just price and speculation, what are you seeing or thinking as far as that goes?
00:34:08.350 - 00:34:51.796, Speaker A: In the next cycle, it's going to be a different cycle. I think because of the l two s, we're pushing everyone off l one to l two s. And obviously l two s take up block space with their proofs and data and things like that and the bridging and all that sorts of stuff. But with EIP 4844 going live probably by the end of this year, that's going to dramatically lower those costs for data, which means altoos are going to go pretty back to, to a pretty small portion of the overall block space usage. I think they're at like five to 10% now. So it's not huge, but that could drop to like 1% or below. And then it depends, like who stole l one? Once we push everyone to l two, it's going to be the whales, right? Like the whales, the people who aren't fee sensitive, they're going to be on l one.
00:34:51.796 - 00:35:43.150, Speaker A: So I still think that the stuff that has driven the activity in previous bull markets will drive activity in the yuan. And why I think that is because even if the fees are like high and theyre like, what, $100 to do a uniswap trade or mint an NFT. If that NFT or uniswap trade is worth more to you than dollar 100, youre going to still spend that money. If you have that money to spend, youre going to do it. Because if you can claim an airdrop and the airdrop is worth $1,000 and it costs you dollar 100 to claim and swap it, youre still going to do that because thats dollar 900 that you still get there. And this is what people don't understand is that the fees are paid by people who have, one, have the money to pay it and two, it's worth it to them to do it because they're going to have more value out of paying those fees than they were putting in. And that's not going to change just because people move to l two s.
00:35:43.150 - 00:36:31.148, Speaker A: I think. I think l one is still going to get pretty expensive. I think there's going to be plenty of stuff happening on l two, of course, as well for maybe people who won obviously can't afford the fees when they get that high because that's, that's pretty ridiculous, like for a lot of people, right? And two, there's going to be a lot of stuff happening on the l two s, naturally, because that's where the users are. That's where a lot of the new users are as well. Because as we've seen in previous bull markets, it's the new users that drive a lot of the fresh activity because the older users, maybe they don't want to get involved with this stuff because maybe they've already made their wealth a lot of their money and they're like, you know what, I'm not going to go down the risk curve as much this time. I'm not going to just mint these random nfts, I'm not going to trade these random coins. So I do think it'll be a similar thing to what we've seen before, but a lot of it will probably happen at l two and the fees on l one will just go up from whales and non fee sensitive users generally.
00:36:31.148 - 00:37:24.900, Speaker A: So that's, I think something's going to be majorly different between last cycle and this cycle is that the l two s are actually live and have a lot of stuff on there and they're going to have bridges into them. We do have bridges into them already from centralized exchanges and stuff like that. But in terms of the l two s as well, like the fee revenue that they're going to drive, it's going to be interesting because they're not things that can provide unlimited scalability. Even with 48, 44, there is going to be a point on these l two s where they reach their own capacities that they've got set for themselves and the fees start going up because of that. And then what happens then? Do we see people migrating to other al two s or to l one s? Again, it's an interesting dynamic to think about. But yeah, I think generally the activity will be driven by the same stuff we've seen before, just speculative stuff around nfts and tokens. And obviously l one, ethereum is still the premier place to mint an NFT because it is, I mean, the art itself isn't permanent or anything like that.
00:37:24.900 - 00:38:01.224, Speaker A: Right. Because it depends on where the metadata stored and stuff like that. But generally if you mint, you know, an nft on, especially if it's a newer one, are you sure that l two is going to be around for a while? Right. And then, okay, can you bridge it to l one? Okay, well, what does bridging actually mean? Does it mean it burns the asset on l two and gives it to you on l one, or does it, is it an iou? So there are concerns around that, I think for people that collect maybe the high end nfts as well. So generally I think those things will still be minted on l one and then potentially bridge to l two for ease of trading and stuff. But, yeah, I don't expect l one activity to really go down even if we move people to l two.
00:38:02.174 - 00:38:35.384, Speaker B: Yeah, we're finally kind of there to l two. That's an interesting topic, by the way, that I don't think, not to fully pivot to nfts, but I don't think people realize, and we kind of saw this, there was like a, I think it was like a Solana nft exchange or something. So they were just shutting the doors and they had been storing a lot of metadata and, like, these nfts just basically disappearing. Right. I don't think a lot of people realize that your, your favorite profile picture, your favorite art most likely isn't stored on chain. There are some. I'll give a shout out to rip cash, who's like a one of one artist that stores a lot of his art on chain.
00:38:35.384 - 00:39:03.504, Speaker B: There's a few kind of coming along that are now, of course, like, because the data can only be so small, you have to do it in like unique ways. Right. You can just upload this, like giant JPeG to the chain. Punks did. They're technically, punks are stored on chain. Like, the website doesn't really pull from it, but you can pull up traits and like colors on chain. But, yeah, I mean, I think going to L2 will be a huge, we've been talking about this literally since we started podcasting, which now is five, six years ago.
00:39:03.504 - 00:39:34.370, Speaker B: We finally, I think, are to L2. Right. But what a lot of people don't realize in bear markets, I see a lot like, oh, why isn't this L2 getting a lot of activity? Well, the fees are cheap on layer one, right. So the whole point of L2 is once fees start ramping up on layer one, people start going off to L2. But we do need that seamless experience, which I think we're getting there. Block explorers are finally there. I know Metamask has some bridge options now they have the default dropdowns.
00:39:34.370 - 00:40:04.246, Speaker B: Wall connect 2.0 just came out where I know if you connect your wallet, you're connected to all your wallets on all these different chains. And I know Metamaster has integrated that as well. So we're getting there where it feels more seamless. And we have these like liquidity provider hopping systems where you can get on and off L2s quick and not have to wait for the timeouts and stuff. So it'll get there. I still want to get to where users don't really care if it's on like polygon or arbitram or optimism.
00:40:04.310 - 00:40:04.534, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:04.574 - 00:40:51.456, Speaker B: They just kind of like, they're agnostic to that. And I think we're getting pretty close. That fell far away away three years ago. But yeah, what projects go over there? I mean, in my opinion, 99% of the NFT space should be on a L2 and I think they're trying to figure that out. I mean we saw some big missteps like doodles went to flow and we saw some weird stuff with going like VC chains or bad decisions sticking on layer one when teams could have went to L2 and just minted there and we get gas wars and the gas was worth more than the mints. These teams need to start realizing this. But in all fairness, a lot of these NFT teams are newer to Ethereum and the tooling and the knowledge might not quite be there for L2 yet, but I think well get there in this cycle.
00:40:51.456 - 00:41:14.414, Speaker B: So I think, yeah, the bigger money trades, defi transactions probably stick to layer one. I definitely agree with that. That'll take up a lot of block space. I mean even with the market being kind of quiet, gas is decently high. And I think, yeah, I think we'll see nfts eventually, like gaming type stuff, be pushed to L2. I totally agree.
00:41:15.114 - 00:41:54.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I think even the growth of l two s has been quite impressive in the bear market. Theres still a lot of activity happening there, a lot of apps being deployed there, the users there. And I think as I mentioned earlier, Coinbase putting out base and putting users there and getting people on chain is going to be a big thing, because Coinbase has a lot of users who have never touched a blockchain. They may have bought crypto on Coinbase and never done anything with it and just left it there and speculated. And theyve never been on chain. So Coinbase has this perfect opportunity to basically say, hey, we have this chain for you to use called base. And I have a feeling they're going to make certain transactions free on there, such as USDC transfers and things like that.
00:41:54.634 - 00:42:27.170, Speaker A: Because at the end of the day, the gas fees, the thing is with the gas fees is that what you're really paying for is compute. At the end of that, you're just paying for someone to store that information and to run the node for you on their machine, really, at the end of the day. So Coinbase is going to be running the only validator and sequencer for their l two for a while. I believe it'll start off off pretty centralized. So they can just cover the costs, right? They can just cover those compute costs, those hardware costs. And they could potentially, I mean, they would have to have a way to stop people from like spamming the chain, obviously, and then, and do like a cyber resistant thing. But I'm sure they can come up with ways to do that.
00:42:27.170 - 00:43:20.210, Speaker A: And they could potentially offer like free, I guess, like gas fees or like gasless transactions on a lot of different things such as USDC transfers and a few other things, which is going to entice users a lot more, I believe. Because if Coinbase, Coinbase says, hey, we dont have this asset, but you can trade it on base, well, thats going to lead a lot of people there, I think. Because usually what would happen is that people would see an asset and it wouldnt be on Coinbase and theyd be like, okay, where do I buy this? And they might go to binance, right? I might go somewhere else and Coinbase would lose the business because of that. Because they can see that, right. They can see the ETH getting withdrawn from Coinbase and going to some other exchange or the dollar or the USDC or whatever. And they would say, well, how do we keep this in house? How do we profit from this, obviously as a business? Well, I think the way theyre going to do it is via base, which is to be great for the entire l two ecosystem because people arent going to stop at base. Theyre going to bridge to other l two ecosystems because other l two ecosystems will have something that base doesnt have, right.
00:43:20.210 - 00:44:06.196, Speaker A: For example, and maybe not tokens or maybe like an NFT as we were just talking about. So I think overall im very happy with l two growth in the bear market and I think in the bull market its just going to get absolutely crazy because Im expecting base to go live maybe this year, if not early next year, and thatll be before any bull market because I think a lot of people, people seem to think, and I think this is actually the right way to think about it. My gut tells me it is, is that the bull market will start again next year. We'll just be stuck in this four year cycle that we've been stuck in for a while for crypto. It just, just feels like that's going to happen again and then it won't be like the raging bull market, it'll be like the early innings of it, like what we saw with 2020. And I've speculated that we probably see a L2 summer because of that, where we get like a lot of this money coming in and people will want to go somewhere with it and want to do stuff with it and the l two s are right there with all these stuff people to do. So.
00:44:06.196 - 00:44:12.094, Speaker A: And obviously base playing a big part in that. So yeah, I'm very much looking forward to seeing if that plays out.
00:44:12.674 - 00:44:44.536, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I'm guessing the craziness around price action will eventually be the L2s themselves, right? Probably getting crazy valuations way over. I mean even though they're all doing great work, we're going to see copycats and clones and all this stuff. Come on, people chasing price up. But yeah, I mean, I agree. It's definitely, it's time for L2 coinbase. Kind of like taking some leadership here, doing their own, which, yeah, maybe it's a little centralized to the start, whatever you want to call it, but a lot of their customers probably don't really care.
00:44:44.536 - 00:45:28.578, Speaker B: They're keeping their crypto on there anyways and introducing people to this concept that Ethereum can have a L2 with pretty much the exact same security assumptions as the layer one, but transaction fees are a lot less. I'm excited for it. I'm not going to make any predictions, I guess, but I'm getting a tingling of bull market starting, let me put it that way. The early months are always a little choppy. People think it's like, oh, we're just going to go straight to the moon. And it's never like that. If you go back and look at the last two cycles, the first few months are very up and down, shaking people out, volumes up and down, nothing too crazy.
00:45:28.578 - 00:45:47.214, Speaker B: And then it just takes off into some godly candles. But I would agree. I mean, I think the juice of it is going to be early to mid next year, but I'm starting to feel something a little different. I'm not going to lie on the bull market side of things.
00:45:47.794 - 00:46:21.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I would say I am as well. But I think that one thing I've learned over the years is that the market needs to be convinced, right. And that takes time to do like to swap from like a bear market to a bull market. It needs to be convinced that like the bottoms for BTC and ETH particularly are like in and they're never going back there. Right. It needs to wash out all the bears and needs to basically keep wrecking them and saying hey, you cant be bearish anymore because this is actually a bull market now. And then once you flip like these big bears into bulls, these ones that are just stubbornly bearish, I think thats when the real bull market starts.
00:46:21.930 - 00:46:52.176, Speaker A: And how you flip them is the price just goes up. You go up and you go up to these levels that they look at on the chart and they say, okay, well this is a key level. If we take this and we hold it, then its more likely than not the bull market is actually starting. So we need to, to stop being bearish. And now lets just pivot to being bulls. So I think thats what takes time. At the end of the day, even if you know with all your heart and you feel it in your entire body that the bull market starts now, the market still needs to be convinced that it has started, which as you said, leads to a lot of chop, leads to a lot of people being washed out.
00:46:52.176 - 00:47:34.008, Speaker A: But eventually we get there. So I do think the rest of this year is probably just going to be us convincing the market that hey, the bottoms are in for BTC and ETH were not going back there. There's not really that many reasons to be bearish anymore. There's more reasons to be bullish because of the tradfi stuff, because of all the building happening, blah, blah, whatever narrative you want to attach to it. And then usually when New Year's happened, people have this thing. I have this kind of theory that the reason why pivots usually happen in the new year is because people always have this thing, whether it's conscious or subconscious, where they're like, it's a new year, everything's fresh, everything's awesome, it's going to be great this year. And then slowly during the year, obviously that becomes less and less and you're like, oh, crap, this year was shit.
00:47:34.008 - 00:47:50.496, Speaker A: But at the start of the year, youre always like, oh, its a new year, blah, blah. Right. And its just like a very human thing that we do. So I think thats why you normally see pivots in the new year. If you look on all the crypto bull markets, a lot of them have happened. A lot of the craziness happened at the beginning of the year. 2017 was 2017, right.
00:47:50.496 - 00:48:16.674, Speaker A: Like that whole year. But in the beginning of the year, thats where it actually started. And then 2020 and sorry, 2020, we actually started going up positively. But because of COVID it kind of delayed things. Then 2021 got crazy. So I think that when you look at it, the pivoting to the new year is definitely a huge thing and a huge thing for human psychology, which obviously drives markets. And I do think we're going to spend the next six, seven months convincing people, guys, it's not going low again, it's not going to the lows again.
00:48:16.674 - 00:48:39.974, Speaker A: Maybe we get close to it and maybe that's the last thing we have to do is that we have to go back down to near the lows for all this liquidity to come in and basically say, no, you're not going back there. We want to buy here and then continue on. We don't know exactly how that's going to play out. But yeah, I think I agree with you in that it definitely feels like if we look back in twelve months, we'll be like, that was the start of the bull market here.
00:48:41.234 - 00:48:48.058, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I'll leave everyone with this. You know the level we have to claim and defend before the bull market, right. It's 2500.
00:48:48.226 - 00:49:01.010, Speaker A: Yeah. Your last top prediction, the last bull market, which is kind of funny, but as I said, like you're saying what, 15k this cycle for Ethan? We went two times your prediction last cycle. So. So it's 30k. That's how it works, right?
00:49:01.122 - 00:49:16.066, Speaker B: Maybe 30, right? Yeah, I'm going 15. I'm going 15k this cycle. I don't know when it's going to happen, but I know it's going to happen. I don't know. If you look at like multiples, they go down. I think it was like two cycles ago was 120 x. I think last cycle was 60 x.
00:49:16.066 - 00:49:31.986, Speaker B: I want to go with something around 20 to 30 x this cycle, which I think puts us 1520 grand range. So I'll go a little conservative. 15. And look, I don't have a crystal ball. Don't be buying either based on this. This is just my hunch like you said. I mean I said 25 last cycle.
00:49:31.986 - 00:50:06.382, Speaker B: I sold a good amount of ETH at 25 but you know what we're below 25 now so I don't feel too bad about that. And I sold up a little bit towards the top too. But I've got plenty left and I'll be looking at him actually won't be selling much this cycle to be honest with you. What I have stake now and we've talked about this a lot but what I have stake now I'm just keeping. I mean maybe we really get crazy it 15 2025k something. Of course I'm going to have to take like something off the table but it'll mainly just be staking rewards that I've earned over the last two or three years. I have a permanent stash.
00:50:06.382 - 00:50:10.714, Speaker B: I'm just, I'm waiting for well beyond fifteen k at this point.
00:50:11.374 - 00:50:35.886, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And I think you know even if, I think this is what people don't understand even if you sell at like a low price comparative to the all time high like selling at 2500 instead of what the all time high was just like five k. Right. It doesn't matter are because you could just buy back in in the bear market and you've had plenty of time to buy back in below 2500 and be in in profit. Right. And be able to buy back in with uh you know at a lower ETH price.
00:50:35.886 - 00:50:55.932, Speaker A: I mean imagine you did this and it's very hard to do this but imagine you know you sold it at 2500 but then you bought it back at like a grand right. Like you just did an amazing trade. It took a while to do it obviously but you still did an amazing trade even though you didn't hit the highs um or the exact lows. And I think that's what people miss. They always like oh you have to sell the all time high and then you buy the lower. It's like yeah. Okay.
00:50:55.932 - 00:50:58.948, Speaker A: Good luck with that. Have fun trying to do that.
00:50:59.116 - 00:51:35.298, Speaker B: Fool's Aaron, man. Fool's Aaron. I mean this. Yeah it's such a good point. People obsess for some reason with selling tops and buying bottoms but if you just, if you sell somewhere near the top and buy somewhere near the bottom I mean you, you do great right? I mean this cycle yeah I sold good chunk between 2000 3000 but I, and I didn't really, really rebuy too much of the bottom but last cycle you know we topped out of 1420. I sold a lot at like 950 but I rebought a bunch at like 80 to 100. So, I mean, look, maybe I didn't hit top exactly, but I hit bottom decent, if you can be in that range.
00:51:35.298 - 00:51:40.250, Speaker B: Right. I really, it's great advice. Do not obsess over top and bottoms.
00:51:40.282 - 00:51:40.522, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:40.578 - 00:51:48.866, Speaker B: Create a sell plan that works for you. Set some of that aside, reboot you. Like we're gonna cycle. It's not like we're gonna go to like one hundred k and never come back.
00:51:48.930 - 00:51:49.154, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:49.194 - 00:51:57.134, Speaker B: Like we always are gonna cycle. It's human nature to cycle. Um, so, yeah, no, I, I really do like that advice.
00:51:57.714 - 00:52:20.026, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think people shouldn't feel guilty for selling or anything like that. At the end of the day, like, in as much as we love Ethereum and love ETH, ETH is an asset. It is not something you marry. You know, if you want to keep it forever and stake it and earn off your staking rewards, that's totally fine. If you want to sell it all because the price went to like ten k and now you've got a lot of money to do other things in your life. There's no shame in that at all.
00:52:20.026 - 00:52:39.584, Speaker A: Right? And I think people sometimes feel guilty about it. Like, I can't sell, you know, and like, you know, doing bad by Ethereum. No, at the end of the day, as you said, things cycle. People are going to sell, people are going to buy. Most majority of people are going to, you know, are not married to their investments. Um, and the ones that do, well, a lot of them, you'll see them on twitter, they, they look that you. They're very easy to spot.
00:52:39.584 - 00:53:00.528, Speaker A: They're, they're coping and they're, they're what we call bag holders, so you don't want to become that. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Um, cool. Well, I think that's the perfect, uh, note to end this podcast on today. Uh, that was great. I really enjoy talking about the markets for a change, I guess, over some of the tech stuff, but I think they all kind of intertwine a lot.
00:53:00.528 - 00:53:12.244, Speaker A: People sometimes try to, I guess, reason about them not intertwining. But a lot of crypto is still speculative. I would say most of it is speculative. So, yeah, prices play a huge part in that. But, yeah, this is great.
00:53:14.224 - 00:53:31.790, Speaker B: Yeah. Good to be back. We'll do it again, I think, in like two weeks or something like that. But again, appreciate you having me on Daily Gwei. I'm glad I can add a little fresh insight here. And it's always fun to talk about markets. I'm sure there's plenty of tech to talk about, but like you said, they intertwined.
00:53:31.790 - 00:53:32.714, Speaker B: For sure.
00:53:33.174 - 00:53:43.734, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. All right, well, on that note, thank you, everyone, for listening or watching. You can subscribe to the channel for more of this. And, yeah, as Eric said, we should be back in another two weeks.
