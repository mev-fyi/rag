00:00:00.720 - 00:00:35.096, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gui refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Susano, and today's the 15 February 2021. Alright everyone, what a crazy weekend. So a lot to get through. But before we do that, I wanted to give a quick little market update here as we did see some volatility in the markets over the last few hours. So we saw ETH drop from a high of about, I think 1840 down to about 1666, and then it popped back up. Basically we're almost back at $1800 now at time of recording, which is quite cool.
00:00:35.096 - 00:01:13.816, Speaker A: You know, it's always funny seeing the sentiment, you know, on Twitter and stuff kind of change really rapidly depending on whether or not what the price is doing. But while I was watching this, I was like, this is nothing, right? And I'll zoom out here on the chart and you can see what I mean by this. If you actually see here, and this is the four hour chart to the left here on the 10 February, which is about five days ago, right. The price basically just went back to that. And then, you know, the fact that we've bounced off that kind of bottom there and now we're back up to basically, you know, almost back where we were. But essentially we're at this price like two days ago. You know, you kind of zoom out and see this perspective and you're like, what's everyone worrying about? Right.
00:01:13.816 - 00:01:38.610, Speaker A: It's just, it's just always funny to see that sentiment there. So yeah, the prices is, the bounce has been quite, quite bullish and quite good. I mean, it shows that there's a lot of people still wanting to buy kind of Ethan, I guess, like the rest of the cryptocurrencies as well kind of fell. It was kind of like a market wide sell off. There was like, I think $1.6 billion worth of liquidations across like Defi and that stuff too. So it was, it was a pretty good shakeout in general, I think.
00:01:38.610 - 00:02:06.384, Speaker A: You know, usually these things happen and the goal is to kind of like shake out the people that are over leveraged. Right. You know, and basically liquidate them because there's just too much froth in the market. So, you know, I guess like some people like to say bullish selling. Like, they like to say it as a joke, but in reality it can actually be true sometimes where, you know, selling, clearing out the froth, clearing out the leverage can lead to a more healthy market going forward. And that's kind of what we saw there. And, you know, of course I'm still bullish.
00:02:06.384 - 00:02:58.726, Speaker A: This is nothing for me. This doesn't change anything. You know, if I scroll out, you can see we've had these kind of like, dumps, like, many times over the last, you know, month, month and a half, two months, right? I mean, we've always had these sorts of things. You can see here, dump down, up, dump down, you know, up, dumb, down, dump down again. Like, it's just this is par for the course of crypto. And I know you all probably all know that, so I won't harp on about this too much, but, yeah, I just wanted to give a quick little update on that one there. And on that note, I saw, like a few people asking questions around, why does the gas prices or the Gwei prices on Ethereum spike so high when the price is volatile? Right? And I've spoken about this before, but the two main reasons is that when there's that much volatility arbitrage, bots are going to go crazy, right? They're going to try and get their transactions in, and they don't really care what fee they pay as long as the results of their transaction is still profitable.
00:02:58.726 - 00:03:21.234, Speaker A: So there, it depends on the variance of these bots. But you could theoretically set up a bot that paid the. That paid 99.99% of the profit it was going to make in the transaction fee, because it would still have made 0.01% profit, right? And it's not exactly like that. There is variance there. But if you have to pay 90% of the transaction as fees, right, and that eats into 90% of the profit.
00:03:21.234 - 00:03:51.916, Speaker A: Sorry. And you still profit 10% at the end of that, you're probably still going to do it. Right? And that's what kind of pushes the gas prices up so high, at least, is a major reason when the markets are super volatile, because only a couple hours later, when the volatility died down, their gas prices went back to under 100. Right, which is quite, quite crazy. And then on top of this as well, people, you know, scrambling to cover their leverage positions. Now, I was just talking about how people get shaken out in these things. You know, if you have on chain kind of leverage positions, you're going to pay whatever fee you need to, to make sure that you don't get liquidated.
00:03:51.916 - 00:04:38.770, Speaker A: So that pushes it up as well. And, you know, there's only a maximum amount of transactions that can get into a block, right? There's around 15 transactions per second on average. So you pay a higher fee because you want to be in the next block, right? You want to beat everyone, and, and you're willing to pay whatever fee to get into the next block, depending on your circumstance. So those are the two main reasons why we see these BoD fluctuations. And this is actually something that EIP 1559 will help with. I've mentioned before how 1559 is not actually going to make gas costs cheaper, but it will make it so that you can have better fee estimation and smoother transactions rather than having to do this kind of race, you know, at least for a part of it. Like, there's obviously the way EIP 1559 works is that there's, like, a base fee, which, which makes the transaction smoother and everything like that.
00:04:38.770 - 00:05:20.780, Speaker A: But then there's also a tip. And when you're in the tip kind of part of the, the block, the transaction kind of gas fee mechanism reverts back to what it is today. So, you know, it's not a perfect solution, but it does help a lot. So, yeah, for those who wonder, you know, will 1559 lower the gas costs? No, it won't, unfortunately, not in any kind of impactful way. But it will make kind of gas estimation better, make transactions smoother, and we'll fix a lot of these issues that we see today for sure. On the bullishness about ETH kind of note as well, the grayscale ETH trust is basically still going up and going up a lot, actually. This is a dashboard from the blocks data section, which I like keeping an eye on for those.
00:05:20.780 - 00:05:46.706, Speaker A: I mean, most of you probably know this by now, but the grayscale ETH e trust basically holds ETH, and it, it really isn't a one way street. Like, ETH only goes in. It doesn't come out. You can see from this chart that ETH rarely ever comes out. It's pretty much always, like, up only, and they're up. But over 3 million ETH in that trust right now, and it's still been going up over the past few days. So, yeah, that's another very bullish thing to keep an eye on, I think, you know, especially the rate at which is going up.
00:05:46.706 - 00:06:13.708, Speaker A: As I said, it doesn't really go down, but the rate at which it is going up is what you really want to kind of pay attention to. And you can see here it started, like, pretty much in, like, March or April, right after that dump we saw last year. It kind of, like, started skyrocketing from there, and it's kind of kept going up. And you'll notice this flat line here. That's because they actually turned off the fund for a couple of weeks for some reason. I wasn't sure on the exact reason, I haven't checked on that yet. But then it's continued up from there.
00:06:13.708 - 00:06:59.218, Speaker A: So yeah, another kind of bullish indicator here that ETH is still being bought up by both institutions and kind of retail investors who want this exposure in their retirement account, basically. Alright, so I think the biggest news from the weekend was the fact that there was an unfortunate kind of hack or exploit within DeFi between alpha finance and cream finance. So for those who don't know what happened, I'll give you kind of like a summary here. It was actually one of the most complex exploits and one of the most creative ones I would say, that people have seen yet in Defi. And it was, it was funny because when chatter of the exploit first came out, people were blaming cream and then the cream token price dumped. And then a couple hours later people like wait, no, this isn't cream's fault. This is kind of on the alpha finance side.
00:06:59.218 - 00:07:30.256, Speaker A: So then Alpha's token price dumped. So it was funny to see that the market was just following the kind of sentiment on Twitter and kind of like what people were saying because the market itself didn't know. And it was funny to watch people get like confused between it. Like I originally thought it was on cream side. Then I saw people say, no, if you actually look what happened, it's on alpha side. So yeah, what I'll run through, I'll run through what happens. So basically what Alpha finance does as part of one of its products is it borrows money from Cream's iron bank at zero collateral.
00:07:30.256 - 00:08:06.754, Speaker A: So for those who don't know, the cream iron bank is a kind of, I guess, pool of capital that other protocols can access without putting up collateral to, to borrow that kind of capital. Now this was introduced a few weeks ago. It has been a pretty kind of innovative feature that's come to defi. And I've talked about it before on the refuel. So there's kind of nothing wrong with the underlying mechanism of how it works. That wasn't the exploit. What the exploit was was that because Alpha Finance is whitelisted to borrow from this iron bank, so the only people who can borrow, or the only kind of protocols that can borrow have to be whitelisted.
00:08:06.754 - 00:08:56.664, Speaker A: So Alpha Finance is one of those protocols. I think it's the only protocol that's whitelisted so far to borrow from the Iron bank. So it did, you know, as part of its products. And for its users it borrowed capital or, sorry, kind of liquidity from the Iron bank, put it into its own system to do, to do whatever. I won't go into the details of what happened there, but basically the way the exploit worked is that someone very craftily was able to kind of, I guess, impersonate an alpha finance kind of contract. So what they did was they made a new kind of contract, smart contract that looked like it was Alpha finances. So the cream Iron bank thought that the kind of contract that was withdrawing, I guess, capital from it was part of Alpha Finance, but in reality it was fake.
00:08:56.664 - 00:09:33.542, Speaker A: It wasn't actually alpha finance themselves, but they were able to use a mechanism to trick the protocol into thinking that it was. Now, I mean, they have a post mortem here, alpha finance themselves. And it's important to remember that the actual exploit and the debt that's owed now, I guess the short fork, I think the exploit was for about $34 million, is actually between the protocols because it was the Alpha finance protocol that borrowed the money from Creams Iron bank originally. Right. Wasn't the users. Yes, the users have access to it as part of Alpha, but the debt is not between the users and alpha. The debt is between alpha and cream.
00:09:33.542 - 00:10:30.614, Speaker A: So that begs the question like who's going to cover this, right? Like is, is Alpha going to cover this? Are they going to sell treasury assets to cover this? Right? Who knows? They haven't put out like a plan yet. I think there are multiple ways they can do this. But yeah, because of the complexity of this kind of exploit here and how it works, people think it might be an inside job because it required some very specialized knowledge of how both protocols worked, essentially how they were interacting with each other, how the kind of, I guess, smart contract intricacies worked for Alpha Finance. So people were speculating, you know, could it be one of the team members? Could it be one of the auditors, right, that found this kind of bug in an audit and figured, wow, this is actually really profitable and maybe I won't report this bug in and I'll wait until it's live and then I'll exploit it? No one really kind of knows. Obviously Alpha Finance did mention they have a suspect already in mind. I don't think they've mentioned who that is yet. Maybe they weren't.
00:10:30.614 - 00:10:57.406, Speaker A: But, you know, maybe the, the hacker was sloppy here. Who knows? But yeah, I mean this is, this is quite crazy because it's very, it's very well and good to say you got an audit, right, of your of your smart contracts, of your code. But an audit isn't actually going to cover economic exploits. A lot of, pretty much most of them don't, I think. And because they're relatively new. Right. It's normally not part of the scope of a smart contract audit to cover economic exploits.
00:10:57.406 - 00:11:24.150, Speaker A: And it's something that you kind of have to look at yourself as like an internal team. So because of that, I don't think the auditors caught this. And I'm not saying the auditors were the ones who pulled off an inside job, but if they were, maybe they caught it and then I guess didn't want to report it. But that's just pure speculation and I probably shouldn't even be bringing that up. But, and that's, that's not true. I haven't seen anything about that. It's just like pure speculation that I've seen on Twitter and myself speculating too.
00:11:24.150 - 00:12:09.252, Speaker A: But in general, from what I know, the auditors aren't looking for economic exploits. Whether that's an exploit via flash loan, whether that's this kind of exploit with, with someone faking an alpha finance contract and being able to access kind of cream's iron bank, I just not totally sure there, but because it was so complicated, that's why we had the kind of market chaos where the cream price dumped really hard and then the alpha price dumped after. And I don't think the cream price has actually recovered from that dump, unfortunately. So it's a bit unfortunate that I guess cream kind of like wasn't at fault here and they still copped like most of the, the pain I think, from it. It's unfortunate there. But Alpha was quick to respond here. They have a post mortem out here if you want to go read.
00:12:09.252 - 00:12:28.370, Speaker A: It'll be linked in the YouTube description. This team, I mean I'm a be a very big fan of the Alpha finance team in general and their products and everything like that. Full disclosure, I hold alpha tokens here and I also hold cream tokens as well. Well I just should put that out there. But basically you can read the full breakdown of what happened here. They've got links to the transactions, right. They've got exactly what happened.
00:12:28.370 - 00:13:03.744, Speaker A: They've got how much kind of how the, how the exploit actually worked from, from I guess like the technical point of view as well. So yeah, definitely, if you're interested, go give this a read. I won't go over the whole, the whole thing here, but I think in general what this points to is that, you know, a smart contract audit is not enough anymore. You need to basically, if the auditors won't do it, you need to examine your own protocol for the possibility of economic exploits. And you need to get that peer cross examined by your peers in other kind of projects and stuff like that. And you need to do it lots of times. It can't just be done once.
00:13:03.744 - 00:13:57.660, Speaker A: You have to keep kind of looking at this. You have to, even when it's live, you have to keep thinking about this. If you see new attacks happen, you need to, you know, and that aren't, that don't involve your protocol. You probably need to look at your protocol and be like, okay, could this happen to us? And if it could, you need to quickly fix it because, you know, if you don't figure it out, someone else will figure it out for you and steal money from your protocol. Because there are probably, I wouldn't say many people. There's probably a handful of really, really, really smart people that are able to pull this off in the world, and they're probably actively looking for these opportunities all the time on chain, right? And if you're, you know, you could probably get away with it if your protocol was, like, small and wasn't really known. But if your protocol is really popular and has a lot of money in it, that's, that's a very juicy target for these kind of hackers or exploiters, right? And if they can get away with doing this, which a lot of the time they can, because one, you know, if they still ETH, they can just wash it through tornado cash.
00:13:57.660 - 00:14:20.282, Speaker A: If they still stable coins, they can also wash it through tornado cash. And then, you know, if they have the ETH onto a new washed, washed address, they don't have to go to fiat. Right. They don't have to try and get it through an exchange. They can simply go to stablecoins and just do whatever within Defi with stablecoins, they could get like a debit card and then pay their bills with that. Right. We're gonna get to a point where stable coins are ubiquitous and Visa and Mastercard are gonna have them integrated.
00:14:20.282 - 00:14:58.226, Speaker A: So, you know, these hacks are just gonna become more and more, I guess, profitable not only from a monetary perspective, but also from a, you know, you don't have to worry about exiting anymore because you can just exit to fiat on chain. You don't have to exit to fiat in like, the, I guess, exchange space, right. The centralized exchange space where, you know, a lot of centralized exchanges will block you from kind of depositing there. So, yeah, I guess the TLDR here is that this was a very novel exploit that hadn't been done before within Defi. I feel really kind of bad for the Alpha Homura or, sorry, Alpha finance team here that they had to deal with this. This is a very big loss, $34 million. I'm not sure how they're going to cover it.
00:14:58.226 - 00:15:38.632, Speaker A: They have, I think, over a billion dollars in treasury assets, most of it being the alpha token. I don't think they necessarily want to dip into that as that would be a pretty big market shock to just sell 30 million alpha tokens or $30 million worth of alpha tokens. Sorry. So maybe they'll take an innovative approach like yearn did. Remember last week I talked about how yearn covered the loss from, or is covering the loss from their hack by using the, the Wi Fi tokens that they printed as collateral in maker to draw dai and then kind of farm with that dai and then the kind of like, I guess protocol fees and performance fees go to paying off that kind of debt. So maybe Alpha will do the same thing here. I'm just not sure.
00:15:38.632 - 00:16:12.852, Speaker A: But yeah, I just wanted to give like a quick rundown there. As I said, there's a more technical explanation and more detailed explanation in this post, which will be linked in the YouTube description. And yeah, I guess keep an eye out because I think we're going to see more and more of this stuff happen. You know, I'll be very surprised if we go with, you know, we go like a few months without a defi exploit or hack only because there's going to be a lot more Defi apps coming online. Right. So the honey pot gets like even bigger and a lot of people building, are building kind of these apps for the first time. So they might make mistakes that other kind of more experienced developers won't make.
00:16:12.852 - 00:17:09.954, Speaker A: But unfortunately, and what I read online is actually a lot of the auditors are pretty much booked out till I think, like may or something like that. So, you know, if you need to get an audit done and you have to wait till may, but you want to, you need to get your product out because, you know, it's a competitive environment, it's a bull market and everything like that, you might just forego that order and say, oh, well, I'll just peer review it, I'll get like a few different people to look over it, and if it looks legit, I'll deploy it. And then you get $100 million in your contract. And then, you know, there's a, there's an exploit just sitting there, that's probably going to get exploited. So that's why I think we're going to keep seeing this happen. This is like basically saying that, you know, people, you know, this is like people deploying websites, right, and then those websites getting kind of exploited or hacked or put, or malware put on them because, you know, I guess in the website world they're not really audited either because it's not really a thing that you do. But in general I think, you know, it's just going to get worse from here, unfortunately.
00:17:09.954 - 00:17:49.514, Speaker A: I wish I could say it would get better but, you know, the way to protect yourself is definitely to use trusted protocols. I know Alpha finance is one of the bigger protocols and was, and was thought to be kind of like trusted and everything like that. But I'm talking about like the big protocols. Like are there like compound like maker, there is a reason they are the top protocols like Uniswap as well, right. They are the reason that they have the most value locked and it's not just because they're the, they're the biggest, it's because they're the most secure too. Like you know, maker's never been hacked. They've had one economic exploit that involved the keepers which were supposed to bid on the collateral back in March of last year and that wasn't really makers fault so.
00:17:49.514 - 00:18:24.112, Speaker A: And compound, as far as I know has never been hacked. Uniswap has never been hacked ave I don't think has. So yeah, there's a reason why there's lots of money in those protocols and I personally will, you know, only use well for like if I'm putting a lot of money into something I will only use those top protocols as well. So that's a very easy way to protect yourself. Another one is insurance, but that's still a very nascent field right now. The only one I would trust right now is kind of Nexus mutual if I'm being honest, and that has Kyc too. But you know, this cover, there's yam that's doing umbrella protocol which I don't think is live just yet or might be live in a limited fashion.
00:18:24.112 - 00:19:03.364, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean as I've said plenty of times, still very early in this space, if you're interacting with this stuff, this is just the risk you have to take unfortunately. And I would actually, the way you kind of mentally kind of prepare for it is that if you put money into something kind of say to yourself, I could lose this, right? I could lose all of this because of this, this and this reason. And I know that's kind of crappy to say, but I think that, you know, that's how you kind of prepare yourselves for these things. And if you, you know, you're not comfortable taking the risks, then don't do it. You know, no one's forced to do this stuff or do it with like a small amount of money that you don't mind losing. So, yeah, I mean, give this post a read for the full breakdown here and then. Yeah, that's it.
00:19:03.364 - 00:19:43.976, Speaker A: All right, next up, we have this really exciting podcast from Camila Russo of the Defiant. So she had Mark Cuban on her podcast recently, and I actually listened to this. It was pretty amazing, actually. You know, you might have seen Mark Cuban tweeting about crypto, specifically ethereum, Defi and NFTs on kind of Twitter lately. And, you know, this podcast just kind of, I guess, reinforced the fact that he really knows what he's talking about. I'm not going to kind of like go over all the, all the juicy bits here, but I highly recommend going and giving it a listen because he's not just some guy who's tweeting about some random coins on Twitter and some random things trying to, like, catch a trend. He's actually deep in the weeds and knows what he's doing.
00:19:43.976 - 00:20:10.698, Speaker A: He's played around with a lot of this stuff. He's really, really into NFTs, especially, which has been a very hot topic over the past few weeks, I think, as well. But it's been really awesome to just see, to just hear him kind of like talk about this stuff, like I would talk about with my friends in Defi, right. For example. So, yeah, definitely go give this a listen. I'm not going to spoil it for you because there's a lot of juicy bits in there and it was a very, very fun listen. So thank you to Camila for getting him on and kind of putting this together.
00:20:10.698 - 00:20:39.010, Speaker A: I thought it was really great. Speaking of NFTs. So for those who don't know, Hal Finney is a kind of famous bitcoin developer. I mean, very early bitcoin, a lot of people consider him to actually be either Satoshi himself or themself or at least part of the kind of Satoshi circle, if Satoshi was actually a group of people. So. And unfortunately, Hal Finney passed away earlier on, I think a few years ago now. So he basically lives on in memory.
00:20:39.010 - 00:21:02.856, Speaker A: But he has a lot of, I mean, he was an early cypher, cyber cypher punk. Sorry. And he was, as I said, very early bitcoin. So Justin here posted on Twitter today that Hal was actually talking about crypto trading cards back in 1993. Right? So 1993, like get crypto, you know, basically nfts, crypto trading cards. And this was long before bitcoin came out. Right.
00:21:02.856 - 00:21:23.732, Speaker A: But back then there were actually attempts to do this, right? Digital money, digital collectibles, all this sort of stuff. So, yeah, this is a kind of note from Hal Finney on compuserve.com. And he posted this in 1993. Now, you know, I'll let you read this. I'll put it in the YouTube description if you want to read the whole thing. But basically, yeah, this was crazy. And I kind of, like made a comment here.
00:21:23.732 - 00:22:09.472, Speaker A: Hal Finney was a time traveler. You can't convince me otherwise because not only did he kind of put these really early kind of comments out about nfts and stuff like that, but if you go back and look at a lot of the posts he made on the Bitcoin research forum in the email trails with Satoshi, he was very forward, you know, forward looking. He kind of like could tell or at least had a kind of idea of what the future would look like one day right far into the future because 1993, you know, that's like almost 30 years ago now. You know, we only recently saw like the uptrend in Defi kind of lately. I guess. Like if you're looking at the history of nfts, you know, 2017, we had crypto punks and cryptokitties. So, you know, maybe 25 years or so from, from when house started talking about it.
00:22:09.472 - 00:22:45.654, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is really, really cool and some, some nice kind of history here. So I guess thanks to Justin for putting this out on Twitter today. And on top of that, again, as I said, it's, there's been very bullish kind of stuff happening with NFTs lately. And Michael Wong posted this video of chamath. And for those who don't know, Chamath is a basically a billionaire investor. He basically was early Facebook and kind of like was part of that. But he's also the, I mean, he has his own fund called Social Capital and he's the chairman of Virgin Galactic, part owner of warriors, which is, I think, a sports team in the US.
00:22:45.654 - 00:23:06.980, Speaker A: I don't follow sports. I'm not exactly sure which. But basically, if some of you might have seen like a few weeks ago, he was on Laura Shin's podcast. And basically she asked him, you know, have you been following the defi space or anything? Like that. And he said, you know, what's defi? And the funny thing is is that when he said that, I'm like, no, no way this guy doesn't know what DeFi is. No way this guy doesn't know what ethereum is. Right.
00:23:06.980 - 00:23:37.752, Speaker A: And anything like that. I, you know, he's a billionaire investor. He's got his pulse on, like, what's happening and what's, you know, what's kind of, I guess, new and innovative going on in the space. And he's also really early, sorry, very big on bitcoin and actually really early on bitcoin, too. He was, I think back in like 2013 or 2014, he was into bitcoin as well. So I thought, yeah, there's no way. And then this video comes out of kind of him saying, or talking about nfts and saying that him and his team have built a sizable position within nfts.
00:23:37.752 - 00:24:02.766, Speaker A: Now. I don't think that he stopped here. I think he was building a sizable position in Defi, in ETH and everything like that, and has been and continued to be. And he wants to do it in silent. Right. In private. He doesn't want to publicize his kind of like picks yet because all the people catch on that he's into this stuff because, you know, then the coins and token price of that, those coins that he's accumulating is just going to pump because everyone's going to be like, wow, this billionaires in it, right? He's buying it all up.
00:24:02.766 - 00:24:27.974, Speaker A: Let's, let's make him buy higher. So I think he's been accumulating for quite a while. I'm curious to see when they actually do go public to see what NFT kind of, I guess, NFT items they bought and NFT kind of plays they bought. Like, there's a bunch of tokens you can buy in the NFT space right now, like NFTX and Rari and, I mean, there's a few other smaller ones out there. You know, there's this tons. Like, there's so much to invest in there. So I'm very curious to see kind of what he did here.
00:24:27.974 - 00:24:56.326, Speaker A: But yes, it's funny to see that. I guess I was right when I thought to myself, there's no way this guy doesn't know what Defi is. He was just bluffing. Or at least he didn't want to give away the alpha, so to speak. So I guess in general, it's a good rule of thumb to take what everyone says with a, with a grain of salt right? No one really wants to give away their positions before they're done accumulating. As I said last week on one of the refuels, you don't shill something before you buy it yourself, essentially, right? You want to, you know, feel before shill as the kind of term goes. But yeah, you can watch this clip.
00:24:56.326 - 00:25:36.042, Speaker A: It'll be in the YouTube description. It was, it was quite, quite fun to watch. As another guess note on NFTs is that, if you haven't noticed yet, the entire NFT economy, well, at least most of it, is priced in ETH, right? It's not priced in stablecoins. It is for some reason priced in ETH. Now, I have my own theories on why it's remained priced in ETH, but I'll quickly tell you why. I think this is actually a really awesome thing. And I tweeted out here basically saying, you know, not only does this reinforce the fact that ETH is money, right? Because it is, and I've argued this for years now, but it also means that all the new people coming into the ethereum ecosystem via nfts become ETH holders by default.
00:25:36.042 - 00:26:35.530, Speaker A: Because they do, right? I mean, this is, this, this kind of ties into why I think the NFT economy is priced in ETH. I think the main reason is because you have to pay gas fees in ETH, right? So it's just easier, it's easier for someone just to have ETH in their wallet and buy an NFT with it rather than forcing them to go trade that ETH for stable coins after buying on an exchange or something like that, right? But also have to keep ETH for gas. So it's like a holistic thing where price things in ETH, right? And then people can just like pay the gas fees in ETH and pay for the NFT and ETH. And then it's just a very smooth and simple transaction that way. The second reason, I think, is because with ETH, it actually because ETH is such, as such a high price, the, the kind of like unit price of these NFTs might be like ten ETH. And you know, you, you don't think that ten ETH is like $18,000, right? You think that ten ETH is depending on when you bought it, you might think it's a lot less. Like sometimes I think to myself, ten e, that's not that much, because I forget that ETH is at 18,000, $18,000, right.
00:26:35.530 - 00:27:13.622, Speaker A: Because, you know, I bought my ETH a long time ago. So for me, like ten ETH is, in my head, at least psychologically, is like that. So I think that's another reason where the psychology of it plays into it. People are like, oh, that's all right, it's only ten ETH, so they'll easily spend that. Rather, if you told someone that like ten ETH was $18,000, they'd be like, wow, that's, that's a lot of money. Right? So from that perspective, I think that plays into it as well. Um, and, but I think that the first point is stronger in that because you need ETH to pay for gas and because, like, you don't want to make, people have to do multiple trades and because the gas fees are so high as well, like, you know, just doing a uni swap trade to get some stables is like 30 or $40 or something like that.
00:27:13.622 - 00:28:10.234, Speaker A: Right? You know, that's just an extra transaction and extra money. People have to spend that it doesn't need to be spent if you just price these things in ethics. So, yeah, I thought that was really, really interesting as well. Another thing on nfts, and this is the last thing today as an interesting thread from TM from Coingecko. So he starts his thread off by saying the momentum behind nfts reminds him of the history of Venice during the Renaissance period, just like how art and artists were supported by a thriving trade economy and major port at that time. And then he says that basically the rise of the Defi economy on Ethereum is supporting this kind of, I guess, NFT boom, or renaissance, as he likes to kind of liken it to. And I think this is very true, actually, because if you think about it, there's a whole economy on Ethereum, right? And nfts and kind of like art and stuff like that are luxury goods, right? They're not something that like, are a necessity or anything like that.
00:28:10.234 - 00:28:58.344, Speaker A: Whereas, you know, in the economy, there's a lot of things that are a necessity for people, you know, like taking loans and swapping, you know, from, you know, currency to currency and stuff like that. Those are sort of things that you kind of have to do, but you don't have to buy collectibles, you don't have to buy luxury art and stuff like that. But the fact that, you know, people are making so much money within the on chain economy now, and the fact that it's so easy to use that money to buy nfts, right? I was just talking about how you can use ETH to buy nfts leads people to just spend more money and to be, and to like, I guess want to, you know, use their gains to buy, you know, unique pieces. And I mean, I've spoken about nfts plenty of times before and about why they valuable to have written about it and everything like that. And I think that's basically fueling that. So interesting tweet thread here, I'll link it in the YouTube description. You can read the full, full thing here, but got my kind of brain moving for sure.
00:28:58.344 - 00:29:37.606, Speaker A: So Synthetix has raised an additional $12 million from Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures and iOS G. So this $12 million was raised out of the Synthetix dao. So they basically, I guess, bought SNX from the DAo. It's vested over time, of course, and now they're on board as partners. So yeah, I mean, I don't think synthetix needs this money at this point because they already have like a massive treasury. But I think it's more about getting these VC's or these investors on board to help them in various areas. And I spoke about last week, Hayden Adams had a thread about how VC's kind of helped them and helped their product grow.
00:29:37.606 - 00:30:08.258, Speaker A: And one of those VC's is actually paradigm. So, you know, paradigm, I've heard from multiple people have like a pretty good kind of rep in this ecosystem where they've got a rep for helping their projects that they invest in. Right. And being very hands on when needed. They don't get in the way or anything, but they're hands on when needed. So yeah, congratulations to synthetix on these raise and to getting these kind of partners on board, especially Coinbase ventures. Right? I mean, Coinbase has a lot of different, I guess, links within the traditional finance system, especially through their exchange, that will help synthetix as well, I think so, yeah.
00:30:08.258 - 00:30:37.034, Speaker A: Really, really awesome to see this race from Synthetix here. So another thing that's been firing up over the weekend is this website called Support AIP 1559. Dot. That basically is a website that tracks like, you know, who is in support of ERP 1559, why we need it, what the arguments are for and against. Right? And you know, you can tweet your support like I've done here. Now, I wrote about this in the daily grand newsletter today. And for more detail, you can go check out that edition.
00:30:37.034 - 00:31:09.796, Speaker A: But the TLDR is that there are some miners right now that don't want EIP 1559. They've banded together. They actually made a site called oppose AIP 1559. And they're doing this because they're going to because of the fact that in 1559, there's a fee burn mechanism. Right, where that fee burn mechanism is obviously going to mean that miners take a bit of a pay cut here. Now, I don't think that the miners that are holding out here are actually arguing in good faith or actually have any kind of leg to stand on. And as I said, I go into detail on the daily Wear newsletter.
00:31:09.796 - 00:31:39.600, Speaker A: I won't go into too much detail here, but, you know, if you support 1559, you know, I'll link this in the YouTube description. You can go tweet out your support. It's really good to make sure that the kind of ecosystem knows that these miners that are against it are a very kind of small minority. And as I explained in the newsletter today, actually, they don't control the network. I mean, I think people kind of think that miners control the network when that's so far from the truth. The miners are service providers. I mean, I've spoken about this before, but basically the miners are service providers.
00:31:39.600 - 00:31:59.422, Speaker A: They get paid by the network for their service. Right. And, you know, because of the fact that they're service providers, it means that they are there to serve the network. The network is not there to serve them. Right. So from that kind of point of view, the miners basically have, like, they still have a voice, right? I'm not saying I hate miners or anything like that. I think they're evil and don't deserve a voice.
00:31:59.422 - 00:32:38.624, Speaker A: They have a voice. But if the rest of the ecosystem wants something, then the miners are just going to go along with that, that, you know, they're not going to create a new fork of Ethereum over this and try to split the network. If they did that, they'd just be wasting money because I don't imagine any exchanges listing a new kind of ETH here. You know, the, I guess the non 1559 fork of Ethereum ETH, which would just be weird and, you know, you would need to have liquidity for it, right. You don't need to have all this sort of stuff. And then miners kind of mine this other chain, which is waste money, essentially waste electricity, waste kind of opportunity cost here from not mining on the correct chain. So that's just like, I guess like a long winded way of saying, I'm not worried about this at all, about miners opposing this.
00:32:38.624 - 00:33:07.138, Speaker A: I still think it's important to show your support publicly on Twitter so that the rest of the ecosystem can see this because I saw some people getting concerned and kind of saying to me, you know, this is going to lead to a chain split, when in reality, no, it's not. We've already seen this kind of play out in a much bigger way with bitcoin and bitcoin cash, where there's. Where there was a split there, and that was actually very ugly. There was a hash war that goin on and everything like that. But it's not like bitcoin stopped being bitcoin. Right? Bitcoin continued on just fine. I don't think this is going to be anywhere near that.
00:33:07.138 - 00:33:34.558, Speaker A: I actually think some of the miners, or at least most of the ones against this, are bluffing and they will just simply go ahead with 1559 when it gets implemented. So, yeah, as I said, read the Daily Gray newsletter for a fuller breakdown on that one there. Interesting tweet from will price over the weekend. Basically a nice picture here. You won't see this if you're listening in, but I'll link it in the YouTube description. He basically calls this the Ethereum semantic web. And he's showing that everything within Ethereum is connected to everything else.
00:33:34.558 - 00:34:15.878, Speaker A: And, you know, I mean, this is, when you think about it, it's kind of obvious, but it's really nice to see this visualized here because you can see that all the interactions going on between all the different, I guess, like apps on Ethereum, all the users, and I guess, like, I don't, I don't think this shows users, actually. I think this just shows the apps and how all these protocols are talking to each other and all these tokens are kind of like moving between apps and things like that. And. Yeah, I think it is. You can see on the right here, he's got like different kind of, I guess, functions and stuff, like the governance functions, time locks, factories, minter, those will mean something to you if you're a developer. If you're not, you probably won't understand that. But yeah, I think this is basically just showing that all the Ethereum apps are like talking to each other.
00:34:15.878 - 00:34:42.230, Speaker A: And this is what we mean by composability, right. This is essentially like Ethereum's big bang, where starts out of the center and then you have all these kind of, I guess, planets kind of feeding into it and stuff like that of other apps and fitting into the core with, you know, I like to visualize ETH at the center of it, basically. But yeah, I thought this was very cool. So thanks, will, for putting that out. So Mstable released MBTC over the weekend. Disclosure here. I'm an investor advisor to Mstable.
00:34:42.230 - 00:35:02.876, Speaker A: So just want to get that out of the way before I dive deeper into this. But what MBTC is, is basically a wrapped kind of bitcoin. So it has three underlying assets, which is ren BTC, SBTC. And I think there's one I've forgotten off the top of my head here. Maybe they listed here. No, they don't list it here. Maybe in the blog post.
00:35:02.876 - 00:35:30.310, Speaker A: I always forget there's so many tokenized bitcoins now that I sometimes forgot to forget what, what this one consists of. But basically you can go and mint this and hit. Here we go. WBTC, Ren BTC and SBTC. So the MBTC is a wrapper around these three assets. And the logic is that because you have three underlying assets, it kind of spreads the risk out here. And there's mechanisms in place to kind of do this, to kind of like make this like a risk minimized tokenized bitcoin.
00:35:30.310 - 00:35:55.556, Speaker A: Because I've described before how none of the tokenized bitcoins today are actually decentralized on ethereum, or at least fully decentralized. You know, there's an, there's an attempt through TBTC, but that's not very liquid Ren BTC. I mean, there is still centralization vectors there. SBTC is part of synthetix. It's a synthetic bitcoin, so it's a bit different. And synthetix is also still centralized because they have an admin key. And WBTC is obviously super centralized because it's custodial.
00:35:55.556 - 00:36:25.542, Speaker A: But basically what, what MBTC does is it minimizes the risks of this. It abstracts the kind of value so that, you know, as a standard because you have all these different tokenized versions of bitcoin. Let's just make a standard for it. So MBTC acts as a standard here and it also creates a pool of these tokenized bitcoins on Mstable that you can kind of trade between. So you can go between WBTC and Ren BTC or Ren BTC and SBTC. And this is similar to what curve has already. But yeah, this is just another implementation of it here.
00:36:25.542 - 00:36:57.726, Speaker A: So if you're interested in that, go check it out. Link will be in the description, of course. Quick shout out to Arjun here. They put out a kind of blog post saying a brief guide to crypto Twitter, which basically has a link to kind of like the Twitter accounts that you should follow. I was very honored to be included in the top five among heavy hitters like Vitalik, antiprosynthesis Ryan, Sean Adams, Eric Conner, and then there's a bunch more down here that kind of like, you should go follow here. This is actually a really great list, not a super comprehensive list. It's not going to give you everything.
00:36:57.726 - 00:37:33.780, Speaker A: But I think if you're new to crypto Twitter, especially ethereum Twitter, you should go definitely give these, these kind of accounts a follow. And I'll link that in the YouTube description. Last up, we have Xsushi added to Aave as a form of collateral. Now, for those who don't know, ex sushi is actually, it's sushi tokens, but it's sushi tokens in staking. So for those who don't know, you can. You can, when you hold sushi tokens, you can actually take them to the sushi platform, stake them to earn rewards in the, in the form of sushiswap revenue. So whenever sushiswap makes revenue, it gets paid out to sushi swap stakers.
00:37:33.780 - 00:38:01.638, Speaker A: And that kind of like gives you kind of, I guess, like a yield bearing instrument there. And the tokenized representation of this is Xsushi. So what Aave has done it. They've actually added x sushi to their platform, not just sushi. So what you can do is by putting Xsushi into Aave, you are still getting exposure to the revenue generated by the Sushiswap platform. But you can also use this as collateral to draw kind of stable coins against if you want, or something like that, which I thought was very, very cool. Right.
00:38:01.638 - 00:38:53.358, Speaker A: We saw this a couple of weeks ago with Makerdao putting in uniswap lp tokens as collateral where you could still earn trading fees on your lp tokens and still have exposure to that. This is very similar in that you can still earn the trading fees from staking your sushi on this x sushi and use it as collateral. And this is just the power of defi, right? Like, this kind of stuff is not possible in traditional finance systems. This is what's revolutionary about defi and about like a theorem and the whole kind of ecosystem here. So, yeah, just wanted to give a quick shout out there. And if you have x sushi and you want to kind of use it as collateral, now, you can, I think the tv, the loan kind of ratio is quite low, so you can't borrow too much yet, but I think it's going to be raised over time. But really good to see these lending markets onboarding more of these exotic collateral types that help people kind of like retain exposure but also use their things as collateral.
00:38:53.358 - 00:39:11.590, Speaker A: I thought this was really cool. So, yeah, kudos to ave for adding this. And congrats to sushi. Swap sushiswap for getting this added because it's always a big deal when you get your token added to a money market. It kind of creates, like, a more compelling reason for people to hold the token, that's for sure. All right, that's it for today, everyone. Thank you again for listening and watching.
00:39:11.590 - 00:39:23.074, Speaker A: This has been a very long refill. I hope you enjoyed it. Give that video a thumbs up. If you did, subscribe to the YouTube channel.
