00:00:00.840 - 00:00:45.862, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Dailygui refuel, where we recap the last 24 hours in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency space. Today's episode is going to be packed, so let's get into it. So, as I guess everyone knows at this point, the crypto markets had a bit of a tumble, unfortunately, over the last, I guess, twelve or so hours. It was funny because yesterday I was saying that, you know, just five days ago, ETH was $470 and, you know, it was up in the 600s, but seems like we went almost to 470 over the last few hours again and have kind of bounced back up to 520. You know, I think this came off the heels of one. I mean, we were due for a kind of correction in the market after going up so much, especially bitcoin. Like, it had gone up for so many weeks without any kind of correction.
00:00:45.862 - 00:01:10.014, Speaker A: And I kind of felt it was. It was coming. I mean, easy to say in hindsight, of course. You know, no one can predict the future, but I'm not really surprised by this, this fall here. And then I think it was exacerbated by the kind of, I guess you could call it fud, or like, you know, concerns around the US banning self hosted wallets. So. Self hosted crypto wallets, which I'll talk about in today's episode as well.
00:01:10.014 - 00:01:31.654, Speaker A: Yeah, so we got bitcoin here, did the same thing as kind of ETH. I think, you know, pretty similar charts here. And the DeFi pulse index is. Is pretty similar as well here. So, yeah, not a great day in the markets, but I don't think it means the bull market's over or anything like that. I just think that it's a. It's a, you know, healthy correction that was needed, which actually resulted in a lot of liquidations today.
00:01:31.654 - 00:02:08.652, Speaker A: So you can see here that this is actually over $100 million worth of liquidations happened on compound today because of this. This dump. But it wasn't just because of the dump. It was also because of the fact that DAi actually ended up trading at $1.30 on Coinbase for a little bit, which you can actually see in the chart here. So the DAI USDC pair kind of like, spiked up to 1130 and then came back down. Of course, now, compound actually uses coinbase as one of their oracle providers, which, you know, it wasn't the only one that they use, but it's one of them, which means that the.
00:02:08.652 - 00:02:34.486, Speaker A: The DAI price on compound would have been higher than it was everywhere else, because it was being dragged up by this $1.30 kind of outlier here. So, you know, this is not a new problem with oracles or anything like that. There's always going to be these outliers that, you know, if other kind of services are relying on them, they're going to affect the price. So we saw some huge liquidations here. We actually saw, I think, one of the biggest liquidations ever. And Giorgio gives a great breakdown here.
00:02:34.486 - 00:03:07.050, Speaker A: Basically, this is how it worked here. They drew, you know, all this dai from, from uni, repaid it into compound, compound, received the CDAI, unwrap the CDAI into dai, repay, repaid the die to uni, and then keep the remaining CDAI using a liquidator bot. So, you know, this is a big payday. I think they got, you know, $3,000,003.5 million of CDAI worth out of it. And if you go to the Ethereum address here, we can actually see the transaction here. So, yeah, it's crazy amount of, amount of money for this liquidator.
00:03:07.050 - 00:03:40.620, Speaker A: And for those who don't know, when I say liquidator, I'm kind of referencing liquidator bots or, you know, human liquidators who hunt for these opportunities. Right. They see that a position on compound or a maker has gone underwater. They're like, okay, it's time to, time to liquidate this person, to keep the system healthy and everything like that, but also to profit, of course. So that's what we saw kind of play out today here. But, yeah, as I said, it's, it's really crazy because, you know, people are saying it's like an oracle attack. You know, there isn't very, there isn't like a very clear deep dive yet on what exactly what happened.
00:03:40.620 - 00:04:09.212, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure we'll get that in the next few hours. But for now, I don't know if it's an attack per se. You know, it could have been someone, you know, pumping the price up to $1.30 on, on Coinbase's Di USDC pair and then getting ready to liquidate positions that they knew that they would, they would, they would be able to liquidate in this case. But, yeah, I'm not convinced yet. I'm going to wait on the Internet report here. And what this did do, actually, as well, is it resulted in a lot of Dex volume for the last kind of 24 hours.
00:04:09.212 - 00:04:28.420, Speaker A: Can see here. And this was updated 2 hours ago. It's probably more than this $1.2 billion traded in the last 24 hours. A lot of this volume went through Uniswap. Of course, the lion's share of it basically brings Uniswap's volume for the last seven days to $3 billion. So, yeah, this is, this is a pretty big event.
00:04:28.420 - 00:05:10.770, Speaker A: As I said, there's more kind of news coming out about it as time as the next few hours go on, and we'll probably cover it in tomorrow's Deli Gwei refuel episode. So. And what else ended up happening? And I put out this little funny tweet here, is that the gas prices on Ethereum spiked again. And this wasn't just due to compound. This is, in general, when prices are very volatile, especially to the downside, people are trying to close off their positions, right? So if they have an open leverage position, whether at risk of liquidation, on chain, on ethereum, then you're going to pay whatever gas fee you need to pay to close out this position. You know, I have been in similar positions before. Not so much because of, like, leverage trading, you know, ETH or whatever, more so stable coin farming.
00:05:10.770 - 00:05:40.710, Speaker A: But you kind of get scared, right, when you see the prices drop so rapidly, like we saw happen, right? We saw ETH go from 600 to under 500 in a few hours. I think it was. That's scary. And then you think, okay, it's better safe than sorry. So everyone just ends up paying all this, all this money to, you know, protect their positions. And on top of that, there's a lot of trading going on because of the volatility. So all the on chain, you know, Dexs are seeing a lot of volume, there's a lot of arp opportunities popping up, and that's why people will pay more gas fees as well.
00:05:40.710 - 00:06:11.666, Speaker A: So I don't expect these gas fees to persist. I mean, you can see here they're already down back into like, the eighties and seventies or whatnot. You know, this is just like, this isn't like, you know, the Defi summer yield farming craze where it was persistent. This is just naturally going to happen when we have these, these moves in the market, basically. Another interesting thing I saw today was from antiprosynthesis. This was really cool, actually. So for those who don't know, it's actually encouraged that when you set up your ETH two validator, that you run an ETH one full node as well.
00:06:11.666 - 00:06:42.664, Speaker A: You don't have to. You can use third party providers, but it's encouraged that you do. And it actually turns out that a lot of people are doing it. So you can see here on the chart, you can see on towards the right end there, you know, when people have started spinning up these ETH one nodes, because as I spoke about yesterday, you want to get your ETH two validator set up before December 1. So we're actually seeing a huge spike in ETH one decentralization right now, which is really cool. And an antiprosynthesis kind of points out that Ethereum's node count is now almost at parity with bitcoin, which is a pretty big deal. Right.
00:06:42.664 - 00:07:13.870, Speaker A: Bitcoin has pride themselves on running a full node and being decentralized because of that. But, you know, Ethereum is almost, is almost up to that. And you know, in general, Ethereum hasn't got like a low cost kind of node count. You know, it's lower than bitcoin, but it's not, you know, too much lower. But now we're pretty much, we're probably going to surpass it given how many people are setting up validators, right, and going to be setting up these ETH one nodes. And yeah, if you want to check out this for yourself, you can go to ether nodes.org, it's a really cool website to track the nodes and like the distribution between them.
00:07:13.870 - 00:07:38.544, Speaker A: And the history tab here will show you exactly what is in anti prosynthesis image there. So, yeah, as you can see, as I was saying, you know, I mean, I don't think these dips are accurate. Like these node counts are there. It's a kind of a crude way of getting node counts. It's just scanning the network to get them. And sometimes, like they dip due to, due to, you know, number of reasons. But I, you know, obviously you see how quickly they come back kind of like a v shaped recovery.
00:07:38.544 - 00:08:17.146, Speaker A: Right? So. But yeah, this is the highest it's been since, since a while. I mean, this doesn't go back too far, but, you know, I'm willing to bet this is, this is some of the highest node count we've seen on the network, and that's simply because the incentive is there to run this sort of stuff. So there was a really bullish tweet, kind of posted by Spencer noon today, and he actually posted this just before the market started dumping, I think, you know, 03:39 a.m. My time. I woke up and the market was already kind of like cooling down and then, you know, went on to it to be a big dump there. But basically what he does is he walks through kind of like the on chain metrics that are showing that we're in an ETH bull market.
00:08:17.146 - 00:08:48.110, Speaker A: So some stuff like Ethereum, you know, daily active addresses, which is a figure that's nearly doubled year today. You can see, look at that. That's. That's crazy growth, right? You know? You know, and coming out, you know, January, February looks like it was kind of like, maybe not so much February, like basically till mid February. It looks like it was taking a dip, but then it just exploded up, right? And it's continued up, and now we're kind of going sideways. But, you know, as the market heats up again, I think we're going to. We're going to see that kind of, like, continue to continue to improve there.
00:08:48.110 - 00:09:21.336, Speaker A: He points out that ethereum's fees dwarfs, you know, everyone else's fees in terms of, like, bitcoin and like, every other chain, it's not even worth mentioning the other chains, as their fees are quite low. So if we just look at bitcoin, it's pretty crazy. And it's even crazier that uniswap's up there, right? With, with bitcoin, too, the gas being used on the network, you know, it's at record highs. Another bullish thing, the network's being used like, extremely, you know, extremely frequently. There's more than 16 billion stable coins issued on Ethereum, which has gone parabolic. I mean, everyone knows about the growth of stable coins this year. It's just been.
00:09:21.336 - 00:09:42.410, Speaker A: It's been insane. Cumulative. There's almost 1 million DeFi users. Now, I do want to caveat this by saying that this metric just tracks a bunch of basically, interactions with different DeFi apps. It doesn't track every DeFi app, and it kind of, like, misses a lot, but it's basically has an address interacted with a smart contract or a DeFi app. Yes. Okay.
00:09:42.410 - 00:10:13.726, Speaker A: Add it to this cumulative total, but it's still cool to see the growth here. And you can actually see it kind of, like, go up much, much faster as we came into defi summer, which makes sense, right? So it's cool to see that one. It goes into TVL, right? At the time, there was more than $14 billion locked in Ethereum protocols or on Ethereum, which is really, really cool. Almost $3 billion with a bitcoin on Ethereum now, which is just insane. Like, most of that came to Ethereum just this year, as you can see from the chart. Right. It wasn't really a thing last year, and now it's crazy.
00:10:13.726 - 00:10:39.212, Speaker A: I remember at set, we were talking about, you know, WBTC liquidity earlier in the year, and we're like, you know, we need to get more WBTC liquidity. Cause we wanted to do more WBTC sets and it was really hard. You can see for a few months there, or even pretty much a year, there was just hardly anything. And then it's just exploded. And now you can't get enough liquidity. Right. There's so much talks about Dexs, as I just showed before, you know, Dex volumes are exploding.
00:10:39.212 - 00:11:07.794, Speaker A: You know, it's been the year of Dexs for sure, on Ethereum. And then, you know, he has a link to his newsletter here. I actually highly recommend that you go subscribe to this newsletter from Spencer Noon. It's like an on Chain analytics newsletter. The link to the thread is going to be in the, in the description of this video along with the links to everything else in this video. So definitely go subscribe to that. Now, I mentioned at the start of the video that there was a bit of drama around self hosted work wallets today.
00:11:07.794 - 00:12:07.298, Speaker A: So basically what ended up happening was that you can see Brian Armstrong put out a tweet thread about rumors that he heard that the US treasury and Secretary Munichen, I think, is how you say his name, were planning to rush out some new regulation that would basically make it so that centralized exchanges, institutions and everything around crypto would have to KYC, AML and make sure that a user owns their self hosted wallet. So the wallet that you own your own private keys to, they have to make sure that you own it before they let you withdraw to it. So, I mean, you already have to do KYC and AML when you go on these centralized exchanges, of course, but these new regulations would basically make it so that you'd have to go that step further where you're like, okay, I own this address and attest to it, but there's a number of problems with that. I won't go through all of them because Brian does a really great job of breaking it down in his thread. But I think for me, I mean, I wrote about this in the Daily Gwei. I kind of hypothesized that in the deli Gwei newsletter. Sorry.
00:12:07.298 - 00:12:34.966, Speaker A: I kind of hypothesized that this could be a stepping stone if it does go through to those banning self hosted wallets altogether. Right. You know, you can think of a self hosted wallet or your personal wallet as, like, cash, right? And government, like fiat cash. And governments have been trying to not ban fiat cash, but like, get people off it for, for many years now simply because they can't track it. Right. It's very, very difficult, if not impossible to track cash, whereas they can track the entire banking system. Right.
00:12:34.966 - 00:13:08.184, Speaker A: And all the digital system going on there and they're happy with that. Whereas the same thing applies to crypto, where they can't really track a lot of the things that are going on in the crypto economy because it's all self hosted. Right? No. You know, you can be anonymous because you don't have to tie your ethereum address to any identity, stuff like that. Yes, they can use chain analysis software, but that's not going to tell them, you know, too much, depending on who the person is. And, and, you know, it's more work basically, than just, you know, the burden becomes for them to do it, the government to do it instead of the exchanges to do it. So it becomes a lot of work and it's not very scalable.
00:13:08.184 - 00:13:35.074, Speaker A: It becomes very hard to kind of enforce these things. So I think that is a stepping stone. If this goes through, would be really bad, but I doubt it. Like, I don't see a world in where something like this goes through. It's pretty crazy when you think about abandoning self hosted hosted wallets, but I guess if they did do that, it wouldn't really matter. I think it's unenforceable, the ban. I think it's like copyright infringement, right? Like people download things all the time, download copyright materials.
00:13:35.074 - 00:14:06.142, Speaker A: It's extremely hard to police that, right. There's hardly any individuals that have gone to jail over it or gotten fines for it or anything like that. It's mostly like, you know, the enforcers go for the suppliers and the big, the big parties as part of it. They don't go for the individuals. So, you know, you could still kind of like have your own wallet, still interact with DeFi on Ethereum, still do a lot of things. It would definitely suffocate the DeFi space, I think, because a lot of DeFi actually benefits from these centralized players. There's market makers, there's centralized exchanges using, you know, people use as Arbs.
00:14:06.142 - 00:14:33.358, Speaker A: Between that and. And DeFi, there's a lot of centralized players actually getting into DeFi as well, not just market making, but generally providing liquidity and being part of the ecosystem. So this would hamper their efforts as well. So, you know, I hope this doesn't go in. I don't. I don't really think so. And the, the, the, the administration's changing, of course, to a Biden administration, and Munichin's not going to be, you know, the, the secretary anymore from my understanding.
00:14:33.358 - 00:15:00.012, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't think this is something to worry about just yet, but just know that, you know, this can happen at any time and any government can do this. That's what we're fighting against, basically. All right, last thing I wanted to talk about. So yesterday I spoke about how, you know, why own is going on this kind of merger Spree. So they, or acquisition spree, I should say. So. They merged slash acquired Pickle yesterday, and I spoke about that yesterday's episode, if you want to go check that out.
00:15:00.012 - 00:15:26.372, Speaker A: Apologies for the audio quality on that episode. Actually, it's a bit choppy, but you can still hear it. But today they announced that yearn wire and, sorry, and cream v two are merging now. You know, I don't really know if these things are mergers or anything like that because the protocol that they're merging with still retains their token. So cream still has its own token. It's not like cream said, okay, we're giving up our token. We're just gonna be part of the Wyoming ecosystem, and we're gonna use Wi Fi, or Wi Fi as our token.
00:15:26.372 - 00:16:12.096, Speaker A: That's not what's happening here. What's happening is basically that they're kind of like merging in the sense that they're trying to, like, increase the TVL of both platforms, you know, share, kind of like create these synergies of, like, sharing liquidity and things like that. And bringing cream in is like a lending platform for, for y earn. Um, it's, it's a bit, it's a bit weird, I think. I think what, I mean, I wouldn't say weird, maybe. I think what Wyoming is trying to do is they're trying to absorb as many kind of quote unquote competitors as they can. They're doing the classic mergers and acquisition spree where acquire, you know, competitors merge with, uh, with apps that are synergistic for, for your own platform and do that really aggressively and really quickly right before someone else can do it.
00:16:12.096 - 00:16:22.016, Speaker A: I kind of. I get it. I get it. You know, that strategy might work for Wyrn. You know, cream isn't really a huge lending platform. I mean, it's growing, but it's not like a compound or an aave. Right.
00:16:22.016 - 00:16:41.226, Speaker A: If that happened, that would be big news, but I doubt that would happen. Right. You don't. You know, it's very hard to acquire or merge with the bigger players. Usually you go for the smaller players and you hope that they can move faster to disrupt the bigger players and that, you know, you have a stake in that as well. So, yeah, I think that's what we're seeing here. I'm curious to see what the next wire and merger is.
00:16:41.226 - 00:17:07.584, Speaker A: You know, there, there's smaller yield farming protocols out there like harvest and yaks that, that they might go after. There's, there's a few other things like options platforms like hedgehog, for example. You know, Molly and Andre. Molly, the, the founder of Hedgehog and Andre did some work together for a while, but I think that relationship fizzled. So I don't know what's going on there. But yeah, go, I guess go check this article out. I mean, there's not much here.
00:17:07.584 - 00:17:21.648, Speaker A: There's a few different things. Like, Andre likes to keep his articles sweet. But yeah, I've got all the links to everything that I spoke about today in the description anyway. So yeah, definitely go check everything out. Alright. I think that's everything for today that I had. Thank you for tuning in.
00:17:21.648 - 00:17:35.344, Speaker A: We'll be back tomorrow with another live stream. I'm sure there'll be plenty of talk things to talk about tomorrow as well. So don't forget to subscribe to the channel and definitely go subscribe to the newsletter and go follow the Daily gwei on Twitter to keep up to date with everything. Thanks everyone.
