00:00:00.520 - 00:00:11.518, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily grade drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and I'm here today with Eric Conner to walk you through all the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem. Hey, Eric, how you going? Hey.
00:00:11.566 - 00:00:23.994, Speaker B: Hey, Anthony. Doing well? I think it's been four weeks or something like that since we did the last one. I've been traveling a bit, but, yeah, should be settling into this every two weeks or so now. But yeah, I've been good overall. How about yourself?
00:00:24.414 - 00:01:06.926, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I've been good. I think a lot has happened, actually in the last four weeks. Crazy enough, maybe not so much in the market action, but on the regular there's been a lot of kind of action and it kind of feels like we hit like a regulatory fud bottom, right? Like maybe a month or five, five or six weeks ago now where we have a lot more positive regulatory stuff coming out. There was these recent bills that got passed through the committees. I mean, haven't been passed through the House yet or the Senate, of course, but passed through these kind of like subcommittees and things like that. So there seems to be some real positive kind of bipartisan support of these crypto bills lately, which is, which is really positive to see. But I think people are, you know, they're kind of asking, why is the market not kind of reacting to this, like, well, because markets can lag for a long time.
00:01:06.926 - 00:01:28.034, Speaker A: And people are also saying, well, the stock market is hitting all time highs or going towards all time highs. And why is crypto still lagging? It's like, because it does. Right. It's a riskier market. The information asymmetry is pretty bad generally, and I think that people need to realize that these things take time to catch up. But, yeah, I mean, have you kept up with all the regulatory stuff over the, I guess last, like last month?
00:01:28.414 - 00:01:29.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I have been.
00:01:29.366 - 00:01:29.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:29.550 - 00:02:05.020, Speaker B: I guess last time we talked, I think ETH was about the same prices as now, but we dipped all the way to like 1600, all the way up to like above 2000. Now we're back at this. Like we're stuck forever apparently. Like 1870, 1880, whatever this, whatever this weird number is that we're attracted to. Yeah, I have. So I guess the dip was originally because of like the SEC lawsuits against finance and Coinbase and everyone kind of like fearing that. And they were like, the SEC claimed, you know, this list of coins were securities in their lawsuit, which of course they're going to do because that's the SEC and they're trying to, you know, do a bit of a power grab on crypto.
00:02:05.020 - 00:02:39.536, Speaker B: That doesn't mean they are securities, but the market still kind of panicked. Right. And then we started, you know, we came back from that a little bit, and then we started pumping when XRP ripple, of all things, kind of had a win in court against the SEC and what's called nano security. And there's some nuances to that that I'm not a lawyer, I can't really go into too much, but I don't think that legal battle's over. I know the SEC can appeal and all this stuff, but then we kind of shot back up. So, yeah, I mean, I think the market's a little exhausted probably right now just from this up and down regulatory yo yo. And I agree.
00:02:39.536 - 00:03:09.504, Speaker B: Usually when that happens to me, we've bottomed in the bear cycle right now. There's always that weird window between bear and bull where you just sit there and you, and I call them crab markets. You're just crabbing left and right on the graph. And unless you're on high leverage, getting chopped out, I mean, you could just kind of chill, right. I mean, I think I still stand by, you know, since we've started doing these again, I've been saying, I think the bull market's brewing, right. It's about to start, and the biggest is the macro environment. Right.
00:03:09.504 - 00:03:30.352, Speaker B: Like inflation's down much lower than it has been. You know, the Fed's still raising rates a little bit, but it seems like they're going to be stopping pretty soon around this level, the Nasdaq S and P 500 are near all time highs. And I think what you said, the most important thing is realizing that crypto is risk gone. And usually there's a waterfall effect.
00:03:30.408 - 00:03:30.600, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:30.632 - 00:04:00.576, Speaker B: So if we watch stocks break, like, all time highs, people start feeling good, they've got extra money, they go look for more risk, they go look for more multiples. And crypto usually is the benefactor of that. Like, if you look at past cycles, like, usually crypto lags stocks a bit on the up and then blows by it percentage wise. So I think we're just in that bit of a waiting game. And this is where people get chopped out, be impatient, and we're kind of flushing those last people out, in my opinion. But, yeah, don't be fooled. Like, if stocks break, all time high in the background looks good, cryptos going up.
00:04:00.576 - 00:04:02.600, Speaker B: Theres just no other way around it.
00:04:02.752 - 00:04:32.016, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah. I think the chopped up aspect is pretty important because I put a tweet where I basically said people are going to fumble the bag. Now youve been holding crypto and then youre looking at stocks and youre like, wow, okay, im holding this crypto. Its not really doing anything, but stocks are going up. So they sell their crypto and go buy stocks, but they do it at the worst time, right, because as you said, you chop up these last kind of people and then we go up and then they kind of just like end up trading in and out of things like constantly. So, and it causes them to lose and get, as you said, chopped up.
00:04:32.016 - 00:05:09.182, Speaker A: But the ripple thing, I actually completely forgot that that happened between our last episodes. And it was such a, you know, such big news because like, I think for a lot of people in crypto, they're not huge fans of Ripple and XRP, but they're less huge fans of the SEC. So it was kind of like rooting for ripple to win that case because we don't want the SEC to win. And I think overall the win is good for all of crypto, really. As you said, there can be appeals and stuff like that. But from my reading of it, it really does seem like the SEC does not have very much, very much left to stand on there. And obviously it plays into their other cases, as you said, against Coinbase and finance and people are pricing that in as well.
00:05:09.182 - 00:05:56.662, Speaker A: I think Coinbase stock is up quite a lot because people are basically saying, well, if the SEC can't even beat ripple, how are they going to, and they can't even classify XRP as a security, how are they going to classify all these other things as securities in order to win their cases against Coinbase and Binance? Binance is a bit separate because they've got other charges against them as well, not just the securities trading things. So yeah, there was a lot of positive, I guess, reaction to that. But at the same time, as we're talking about the kind of prices and what they do, it obviously shot up. There was a huge pump after that win, especially on XRP. I mean, XRP went up ridiculous amounts within 24 hours for a cap of its size, right, for a mark cap of its size. And then all the other coins followed the ones that had been beaten down because they were listed in the lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. But, you know, as you said, we came back down right now we've just been crabbing again.
00:05:56.662 - 00:06:14.798, Speaker A: And I think that's got to do with the fact that the, and I say this all the time, but like, there's not any new money still coming in. Right. It really is just the same money. It's a, what we call a PvP market where everyone's just trading against each other. And in that environment, what ends up happening is that there's no follow through. Like pump happens because all the traders are piling in, like, oh my God, this is a new narrative. Let's trade this.
00:06:14.798 - 00:06:41.600, Speaker A: And then they're all taking profits because they're traders, right. They're not going to just sit in the position, um, where. And that's why you don't see a follow through because it's just trader money. It's not new money. But when we have net new money come in, as you said, when the stock market hits all time highs and people start looking for more multiples and want to take on more risk, that's when new money comes in. And obviously the existing players and the traders, they realize this as well, because on their charts they have these lines that they draw and those lines start getting broken. They're like, oh, okay, wow, there's new money coming because there's follow through.
00:06:41.600 - 00:06:59.564, Speaker A: Now we're actually going up from here. So it all just feeds on itself, right? And it snowballs and it causes a bull market. Same is true for bear markets. It just depends on the trend. And it also takes a lot longer than people would like for trends to change as well. The market needs to be convinced of things. So that's what's kind of happening right now.
00:06:59.564 - 00:07:06.384, Speaker A: But, yeah, that whole ripple case, that two and a half years since that case has been going on is a pretty big win for crypto overall.
00:07:06.684 - 00:07:22.444, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. It's funny. It came at the hands of ripple, but it still doesn't really legitimize the project by any means. But it was a general good win for crypto as a whole. Right. So I guess we'll take that, even though it was ripple. But yeah, you know, the market's funny right now.
00:07:22.444 - 00:07:52.620, Speaker B: I mean, I think right now is the time. Prepare a little bit. Like get your staking rig, set up, stash some, eat the way, clean up your addresses. Like kind of just do some maintenance on your stuff, right. And kind of prepare. And I would say the number one thing is, like, if you, I mean, if a bull market's coming, which I think it is, you know, set some, unless you're still holding all your e through this next cycle, set some, sell targets, right. And I talked about this, like, a lot back in the into the ether days, like the first big ETH pump, I wasn't prepared.
00:07:52.620 - 00:08:37.700, Speaker B: I didn't have any sell targets set. And I kind of like missed the top, which is fine, right? And I sold some lower, but I didn't like play that how I wanted to, right? And last cycle I was prepared, right? I had like the percentage of ETH I wanted to sell. I had a plan, I had targets. And like, I know I didn't sell it all at 4900, but it doesn't matter, right? I was still like hit what I wanted to hit. So it's a good thing because like you very quickly get caught up in the mania, right? Like if we start moving from 2000 to like 4000 people start losing their minds, you, you forget how fast it can go, right? Like we wait like three years in a bear market for a very short amount of time of bull market. So that's one thing to always kind of think about with an impending bull coming. But it's funny, right, how it always, I posted a chart the other day, the, like all time bitcoin chart.
00:08:37.700 - 00:09:28.536, Speaker B: It literally does align every four years and it also always aligns with the havening. Now, I don't think, like the havening, like the actual event is the direct impact. It's just that narrative around it, right? And bitcoin is a great at building that up. And I think that'll kind of be, it's all self fulfilling in a way, right? The happening narrative starts that media kind of starts picking that up. Price starts kind of going up and then retail starts noticing and then they start, the new money starts coming in, right? And we're just not quite there yet. I think Ethereum has better narratives with like fee burn and staking live and. But retail hasn't caught on to that, right? We're going to need, like them to come in because of the graphs and then stay for those narratives because in all reality, the only crypto narrative that really translates well right now is the bitcoin digital gold narrative.
00:09:28.536 - 00:10:01.204, Speaker B: As frustrating as that is, we're still a little while away. I think a lot of people will come in because of the inflation happening across the globe. That narrative will start to catch on for ETH and then people will get interested in the fee burning, could be deflationary and, oh, I can earn 4% if I stake this. But, you know, it's just funny how these cycles happen. Like, I haven't had any random friends or family text me yet and I always know that's like around the start. And then if I'm getting like multiple a week and they're asking me if they should buy like, Cardano, then I know, just sell everything.
00:10:02.104 - 00:10:13.488, Speaker A: Yeah, I had a friend last cycle who messaged me only twice at the May 2021 top and the November 2021 top, and both times it was about Ponzi's. So I don't know if that's going to work next cycle, but I'm going.
00:10:13.496 - 00:10:15.224, Speaker B: To be text you this.
00:10:15.264 - 00:11:06.014, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I'll be sharing it for sure. Because he, I mean, he's been my friend for a long time, since basically high school, and I've talked to him about crypto a bunch. But it's kind of funny how, yeah, he messaged me those two times, and it was basically the top each time. So, yeah, maybe he'll be the signal next cycle as well. But you're right generally, about those narratives, because I think what happens is that, say right now you're allocated to stocks or you're in cash, and you're thinking, when do I deploy into crypto? Or you're thinking, well, maybe I won't deploy until the harvesting gets closer, because then the narrative will start getting more heat and then we'll start going up, and then it becomes, as you said, a self fulfilling prophecy. And I think that maybe it lasts for a little while longer, that kind of harvesting narrative. But I think the more sophisticated players we get into the ecosystem, like the actual institutional and tradfi kind of money, not the, not the memes of like three AC and stuff like that that people thought was smart money, but they weren't.
00:11:06.014 - 00:11:54.720, Speaker A: Right? I'm talking like actual non crypto native money, because these funds that came in, they're crypto native money and they still influenced by the crypto native narratives, whereas the kind of like ones that exist outside of it, I think that theyre influenced by a bunch of different kind of metrics and things. And also if theyre managing other peoples money, they also have to think about things differently and think about risk differently and have their models and everything like that. But I think at least this cycle seems like the harvarding narrative is something people are latching onto again. And as you said, it seems to want to line up anyway, because regardless of the harboring happening next year or not, I still think next year is going to be a very positive market just based on a bunch of other things that weve spoken about in the past there. But I guess you mentioned ETH staking as well. It's probably a good way to segue into that. It's been up only, right? It has not stopped.
00:11:54.720 - 00:12:13.408, Speaker A: I mean, the queue is still above 80,000. It was above 90,000 for a bit, but it's still above 80,000. And it just doesn't really stop. It hasn't come down that much. And we have newer protocols coming online as well. We had over the past few weeks, Geode finances on Testnet diva staking was announced. I think they're on Testnet or Mainnet at this point.
00:12:13.408 - 00:12:52.834, Speaker A: And there was also stakewise, v three opened up their, they're testing it to everyone. So there's more and more products coming online. And also the Gollum have this new kind of foundation or something that's spun out of Gollum called Octant, which is staking the ETH that Gollum has. And then GLM holders can vote to distribute that to like wherever, distribute the rewards from the staked ETH to wherever. So, yeah, we have all these kind of activity happening in the Ethereum staking space right now, and it just seems to be happening mostly in the background. People are kind of not paying too much attention to it. I think it's become a stale narrative for people where they're like, yeah, okay, staking, you know, people are staking more, Ethan, and they're just not realizing that it really has been up.
00:12:52.834 - 00:13:29.906, Speaker A: Only the restaking stuff has gone crazy. I mean, Eigen lay, every time they raise their caps, it's just immediately filled. Now, of course, I'm sure that a lot of that has got to do with airdrop farming as well. People think that they put the ETH and they might get an airdrop one day, but I mean, it's an incentive. At the end of the day, this space runs on incentives. So, yeah, all of that just combined together is just making for a very crazy ETH staking ecosystem coupled with the burn still, you know, going strong, still burning ETH. And it's funny because I saw a tweet yesterday, someone said ethereum delivered the burn and the merge and ETH BTC is still kind of stuck in this range or not like going to highs.
00:13:29.906 - 00:14:05.660, Speaker A: But I think that's the wrong way of looking at it. If you look at it from performance from last cycle to this cycle's perspective, ETH BTC went down 90% last cycle, which was extremely brutal. I mean, that's just crazy. You put ten BTC in to ETH at the top. Of course you'd have to buy the top, but you'd have one BTC left, right? So it was a crazy drawdown there. Whereas the max drawdown that happened from peak to bottom, this cycle was 40% and its only 28 ish percent right now. So really the burn and staking and all the other thing, all the other fundamentals that have come to Ethereum have really basically acted as a flaw in the bear market.
00:14:05.660 - 00:14:27.144, Speaker A: Now I always say what do you think happens in a bull market where supply is basically, most of it is staked? Well, not most of the supply, but a lot of it is staked. And theres so much burn going on. Theres always other reasons for holding ethics. So I think that people tend to look at the short medium term stuff and forget the bigger picture, the bigger long term picture when looking at a performance. But yeah, the staking ecosystem is just so healthy right now.
00:14:27.484 - 00:14:43.820, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I see that all the time. Actually kind of what you're saying. People will be like, oh, we got feedburn and staking and there's 20 million stake but east only at like 1860 still. And I. That's not like you said, that's not the way to look at it. What, what would it be if that wasn't? I mean we might be down at 1112 hundred. Right.
00:14:43.820 - 00:14:53.892, Speaker B: And it's kind of amazing that we only on the ratio retrace 40%. I actually didn't the exact amount. I thought it was a little bit higher than that. But yeah, that's amazing. Looking back to like last like button.
00:14:53.988 - 00:15:07.276, Speaker A: I think it only went that low because of the three Ac blow up where they were puking all of that ETH onto the market and. Exactly. It only lasted for a little bit actually. Right after that it just went right back up. So yeah, yeah.
00:15:07.300 - 00:15:20.528, Speaker B: It's pretty much been stable. Yeah. No, I mean, I definitely think that's the way to look at it. Not like, oh, why isn't ETH at ten k? Because that'll happen in a bull market too. Right. We'll see better performance for Ethan and a bull because there's less supply to sell. There's more ETH locked up.
00:15:20.528 - 00:15:47.184, Speaker B: I mean, locked up is maybe not the right term, but I mean, we got used to that with like locked in Defi. Right. But in reality, like it's not locked but yeah, kind of going back to that topic. I mean, I think we're at 22 million east stakes. Seems like we'll be up probably on our way to 30 pretty soon with all the pending validators. And it kind of blows me away. I mean, if back in the day I thought maybe ten to 20 million would be staked, something like that.
00:15:47.184 - 00:16:23.960, Speaker B: Because at a point like the risk reward factor isn't quite there. Like there's not that much risk. I think there's more risk, though, than people kind of realize, right? Like, just, you know, making sure your machine stays up, that there was, like, a major client bug, and, like, a majority of people were using that client. Um, or you do some things wrong, or maybe there's just a bug in general in staking, and everyone kind of gets screwed, right? Like, there are still. We've been running less than a year on this, right? Well, going back to phase zero, we've been running, like, four years now, something like that. Three, four years. But, you know, the actual, like, my withdrawals and all that recently hasn't been that long.
00:16:23.960 - 00:16:43.924, Speaker B: And the merge. So there definitely is some. That's my favorite, by the way, on bitcoin Max, is they're like, back in the day, well, the rich get richer, there's no risk in staking. And then the other day, like, Vitalik on. I think on bankless was like, oh, yeah, I don't know if I would be staking all money because there's some risk. And then the bitcoin max is like, see, Vitox is risk. So it's like, which one is it? It can't help all of those things.
00:16:44.664 - 00:16:46.256, Speaker A: Schrodinger's fud, right?
00:16:46.360 - 00:17:15.512, Speaker B: Yeah, they love their Schrodinger's FUD 100%. But, yeah, I'm curious to see where we're going. I mean, I think as a solo staker, I would love for people to stop staking. Cause my yield keeps going down and my blocks keep going down every day. But I think I'm at, like, I think I'm just creeping under 5% now with MeV Boost on as a solo staker. So I'm guessing that's trending probably towards four soon. Now, in a bull market, it'll get wild, right? Because fees will be up, and you could get a block.
00:17:15.512 - 00:17:44.944, Speaker B: I mean, I've got a few big blocks, but I'm sure people are going to be getting 2030 blocks, like, daily, right? I mean, that even kind of happens now, but, like, when things heat up a little bit. But I think it's going to be pretty constant for stakers and east going up. So, you know, your previously earned stuff's going up. So, yeah. Where does it end? I don't know. Maybe we get up to, like, 50 million or something. I think this will be a strong narrative for Ethereum once retail kind of comes back, because I think it's a little misleading to say, oh, the ETH locked in staking.
00:17:44.944 - 00:18:03.724, Speaker B: But in a way, like, if you're staking your ETH. I think most people are not. And you see it in the exit queues. Not many people are, like, lining up to go rush out in a bull market done stake, right? I think in a way, way more than DeFi. Stake is much stickier as a stuck money than value locked in DeFi was.
00:18:04.144 - 00:19:08.026, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. And I think that kind of snowball effect you were alluding to in a bull market where essentially the AP or APY goes up because there's more fees being paid, there's more mev, which means that there's going to be more ETH staked, which feeds into the narratives of, oh, look, more ETH is being locked up. Even though it's not accurate to kind of say that, I guess, especially with lsts, it's still going to be a narrative that people play on and they're going to. It's going to snowball. And then you just keep getting. So what ends up happening is that the APR goes up, more ETH gets staked, and then more people buy ETH to stake it, and then maybe the ETH price keeps going up, right? And then the USD denominated returns keep going up, because, as you said, you earn it in ETH, but then you measure that ETH against us dollars, so it could lend itself to a pretty extreme flywheel effect, right, where essentially you have, as you said, like sticky ETH steak sitting there, and then more ethic coming in, and then that's not even talking about things like restaking, right? Like Eigen layer, or even like, leverage staking, where you can essentially just like, do the recursive staking via these money markets and stuff like that. Obviously, that's a lot more risk of taking on doing that.
00:19:08.026 - 00:19:36.420, Speaker A: But in a bull market, I think people remove the risk part of their brain a lot of the time, because everyone's making so much money, because everything's going up. You're not thinking about risk, you're not thinking about things going wrong. Like in 2021, no one was really thinking about what would happen in. In a bear market. And in 2022, like so much happened in that year, that was just out of the kind of, I guess, mind for so many people. Like, no one predicted that Terra would collapse in three days. There were obviously lots of concerns around Terra and how it looked like a ponzi.
00:19:36.420 - 00:20:06.596, Speaker A: Will the UST stable coin look like a ponzi? And that played out pretty much. No one knew what FTX was up to. We knew that SPF was dodgy and FTX team dodgy but we, like, I don't think anyone had any idea that he was doing what he was doing with customer funds, right? Like that was next level and then all the other kind of daisy chain leverage that blew up. So in a bull market next time you'll see the same thing happening. Everyone will be like, oh, it's a super cycle, we're not going to get another bear market again. And that's why people remove the kind of risk part of their brain. I mean, maybe not the people that are around for a while.
00:20:06.596 - 00:21:15.924, Speaker A: I know you and I definitely think differently about this because we've been around for a long time now, but the newer people, even the people that were around life cycle may, may forget these lessons here and that bring it back to eat staking, that might result in just a crazy amount of kind of risk that people take on for their ethake. Now, does that mean that it's going to harm Ethereum as a network or ethereum as a chain if something goes wrong? I don't think so. I think that ethereum, the Ethereum network, has really great mechanisms in place to control that. Like the exit entry queue is a perfect one because people say, oh, what if there's a mass slashing event on eigen layer and then all this ETH has to be withdrawn from the beacon chain? It's like, well yeah, it'll get withdrawn, but the thing is, is that they can't get withdrawn faster than the execute. There is a limit. So what ends up happening is that the secondary market prices in all of this risk, so the LSTs will maybe trade at a discount because everyone's trying to get out, right, or these services are trying to sell what they have in order to cover their losses or anything like that. So theres a lot of moving parts here, but in a bull market I think it distorts things because therell be so much demand, therell be so much money flowing around that what ended up happening is that people will not, I guess, do a risk reward kind of analysis properly and well get some crazy stuff going on.
00:21:15.924 - 00:21:55.900, Speaker A: But yeah, its hard to know where e staking will actually go to. As you said, will it go to 50 million, 60 million? Ethnic I think its going to be generally lower than the other networks out there because ETH is used for so much more than a staking asset. Lsts do change this a bit and so does restaking, but at the end of the day, ETH is still going to be required to pay for gas fees. So even if all the ETH is staked and doing other things and doing like, lsts and restaking. There still needs to be a part of, you know, still needs to be some ease to pay for the gas fees, right? Like, you can't pay gas fees in lsts ultimately. I mean, you could, people say, oh, you can abstract it away. You can, people can pay in whatever token they want.
00:21:55.900 - 00:22:11.264, Speaker A: But the ultimate settlement, uh, token for paying fees on Ethereum is ETH. And you can't get around that. That is literally baked into the protocol via AIP 1559. You have to pay that base fee in ETH. So that also plays, I think, a big part into it, um, for, for a lot of people.
00:22:11.924 - 00:23:00.548, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I mean, and on the topic of like, you know, lsts, I saw a tweet earlier today about, and this is like a fascinating topic and could be a huge narrative for defi someday. Maybe not this cycle, but maybe the cycle after, as people kind of start to learn about this stuff. Um, a lot of defi collateral is being replaced by lsts and not, and not ETH, right? So like Coinbase v three, for example, or compound v three, for example, you can go, you can lend your lido, repped ETH as collateral and borrow against that. I mean, how cool is that? You're earning four to 5% on your collateral as your borrow. So you can go lend or post your collateral, you're earning four to 5% on it, you can go borrow, say, USDC. And I think the borrow rate's only like three or 4% or something like that.
00:23:00.548 - 00:23:34.306, Speaker B: So you're kind of like, of course, different assets and there's a mismatch there, but it's such a cool, unique thing. It's not a very common thing in traditional finance to be able to have a collateral that's earning you interest beneath the scenes. Say you're borrowing a position and ETH goes up, you're earning all this interest plus the value of ETH going up. So I expect almost all. I don't really know why you wouldn't wrap your ETH if you were using ETH as collateral and defi on borrow against it. I think that's going to be a big push as well. And another reason we're seeing a lot of staking.
00:23:34.306 - 00:24:11.124, Speaker B: If you are someone that's wanting to borrow against your ETH, you're going to go stake it, earn on it, and then borrow against it. That'll be a big, interesting narrative, I think. Really something that's just unique to Ethereum. Another cool new financial component that's not necessarily invented on Ethereum, but just only possible on Ethereum. ETH truly is one of the most unique assets in the entire world. Now, given all these things we're talking about on that, it's funny. The gin Spartan has like, this three year defi bear market, which is expiring, like any day now.
00:24:11.124 - 00:24:14.948, Speaker B: I think. I think it's like up. He's like a little ticker.
00:24:15.076 - 00:24:19.460, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's like August or September, basically, when it close.
00:24:19.652 - 00:24:48.150, Speaker B: Yeah. So what's funny is, like, just like, these cycles do line up with stuff like this, right? And like, memes and self fulfilling prophecies do play a role. And, like, we're starting to see some defi coins moved up. Move up. I took a few DeFi positions for the first time in many years. At this point, it seems like many decades. Like a small portion of my portfolio, very small, but wanted to play because there are some graphs that I think that looked a little prime to do well against ETH.
00:24:48.150 - 00:25:24.492, Speaker B: But it's funny. If Defi does start taking off in its own little bull market right at the end of this three year bear meme, it would be so fitting for crypto. But I think we're going to see a comeback of defi. The original defi bull was propelled, in a way, propped up by farming, which wasn't sustainable. These protocols were just essentially printing off tokens, trying to attract liquidity. And now it's more about the quality of the protocol, what features they offer. It's pretty basic now because everything's settled in, the code's been verified a lot more.
00:25:24.492 - 00:25:59.750, Speaker B: It was the wild, wild west back then. I think we definitely could see a prolification of Defi again. And just like that usage going up and see a second little Defi hype bubble, I'm more confident, of course, in ETH going up. I don't want to sit here and say comp is going to go up ten, x and the next, I don't know. But I do think Defi is getting to the end of that bear cycle. And the coins themselves I'm not a fan of. I call them worthless governance tokens, but it almost doesn't matter retail.
00:25:59.750 - 00:26:25.754, Speaker B: Everybody just sees them as, like, ownership. And like, if. If Defi takes off, just because, like, comp or uni have not much use other than governance, they're still going to go up, right? Like, people don't. It's, it's, it's really, you're, you're mid curving yourself, right? If you're thinking too hard about, oh, this token doesn't really have a use, even though, like, Defi might go through a bull market. But, uh, that's a sector I'm. I mean, I'm always interested in, of course, but I kind of have a new eye on.
00:26:26.904 - 00:26:53.696, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the probably quintessential example of this is MKR. Right. It's one of those tokens that has been beaten down for a very long time for various different reasons, even though Maker as a protocol has been growing. I know that the. I put this tweet out the other day, the purists among us, like the ETH ogs, were really disappointed with maker over the past couple of years because it kind of shifted away from that. That vision of a truly decentralized stablecoin to being basically the bridge between the old world and the new world.
00:26:53.696 - 00:27:30.858, Speaker A: You know, really integrating the real world assets, starting with things like USDC now doing other things like treasuries and stuff like that. I think that's the right path for them to take. And I think that they're one of the only protocols actually making real money as well. As you said, these things are governance tokens, but they also have the ability to capture some sort of dividend eventually. And it just depends because with MCAl in particular, I actually saw some proposals put out there that I think they want to turn it into a staking token, and they also want to do a split on it at a thousand split or something, where essentially, I think it's, what, $1,300 right now? So it would be like $0.01 or something, 1.3 cents, which would be.
00:27:30.858 - 00:27:33.546, Speaker A: Which would be pretty crazy because we all know how. Unit bias.
00:27:33.610 - 00:27:37.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to do that for ETH, but I would never get through.
00:27:37.066 - 00:28:08.778, Speaker A: But, yeah, sadly not. But, but, yeah. So there's a lot of that going on. But I guess those are like the OG DeFi protocols, right? The ones that have been proven tested, the ones that would be more interesting to the traditional finance world because they're more interested in things that are low risk. Right. And then. And things that have been around and test, tried and tested and have not just died off, but there's also a resurgence, I think, in newer DeFi protocols over the past six or even twelve months that aren't just kind of modifying things a little bit, but trying to do radically different approaches to DeFi.
00:28:08.778 - 00:28:25.066, Speaker A: So one of the themes is like, oracle less protocols. So there's one that came out recently called azure finance that is trying to do oral cool, less money. Markets, which is. Which is pretty ambitious. Right. There is a new amm that I know of. They're trying to do like radically different AMM design.
00:28:25.066 - 00:28:44.434, Speaker A: Like just very different to uniswap. Not just trying to fork uniswap, add a few bells and whistles. Uh, there are other things like LST centric borrowing protocols, like gravatar protocol. So you basically put your LST and it's like. It's like liquidy, but for LST's. And you, uh, you mint this gray, stable coin against it. So there are a lot of things happening, and it actually feels like a real Defi 2.0
00:28:44.434 - 00:29:21.358, Speaker A: instead of what we had, which was just Ponzi's, um, you know, with the. With the original thing that was called DeFi 2.0. So I think DeFi, you know, as you said, like, is in a really great place right now. It seems to be coming out of its deep bear market, not just the tokens, but I think generally people got bored of DeFi for a bit because nfts kind of became the thing and then l one s as well. The l two hype is pretty, pretty big right now, too, but I think DeFi also plays into that because a lot of these DeFi apps, they work a lot better on an l two because it's more scalable and faster and there's more, there's a bigger design space there. So, yeah, I'm definitely paying attention. I haven't taken any deFi positions besides some angel investments, to be honest.
00:29:21.358 - 00:29:40.296, Speaker A: I kind of look at MKR and I'm like, I've been burnt too many times on that token. I kind of want to buy because it feels different this time, but at the same time, like, I measured everything against ETH and I'm like, realistically, how much is it going to go up against ETH, right? Am I going to make a ten x against ETH, for example? I don't think so. Maybe I'm wrong, but, yeah, that's how I kind of look at things.
00:29:40.480 - 00:30:10.294, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the same. And that's the hard thing. Like, usually I just hold on to my ETH, right, because, like, you have to look at it against ETH, right? Because I mean, most of the stuff, if I'm investing, I'm taking it likely out of my ETH stash. But yeah, no, it's a very good point too, on like newer experimentation in defi. I definitely think we'll see that. For example, uniswap, of course, v one of their amm wasn't the end all be all right. They're already on before and they've got uniswap x, and there's big improvements that could be made to amms, huge improvements.
00:30:10.294 - 00:30:38.028, Speaker B: We still have the issue with low liquidity and people ap in getting sandwich attacks. There's so many things like the inefficiency of v two. They tried to sell them v three, but v three is not really great for unless you're a crazy sophisticated lp kind of running bots. So there's a lot of improvement that can happen. Even things like, you know, Cal swap and a lot of improvements have happened to help people get better prices and not get front run and all that stuff. So I do think we'll see a.
00:30:38.036 - 00:30:38.708, Speaker A: Lot of that happen.
00:30:38.756 - 00:31:13.470, Speaker B: One of the cool things I saw the other day was curve launched their stable point curve USD, and they have a pretty cool mechanism on liquidation. So I think even things that people thought would just be how they are. So curve, for example, you can see a band of liquidation on like, say, maker, you borrow against your ETH, it'll say, oh, your liquidation price is like 1000 ETH or whatever, $1,000. And it'll just like liquidate you there. On curve, you can like set these bands and it'll slowly liquidate you across these bands, right. So your collateral, and if it goes back up, goes back up, it'll rebuy for you. So you.
00:31:13.470 - 00:31:52.050, Speaker B: If it kind of goes back and forth in those bands, you could get wrecked on like slippage and stuff like that. But it's cool because theres not just like one price where you get liquidated, you could hang on, and then if ETH goes back up, so its just stuff like that improvements upon. And again, those are things kind of only possible on Ethereum, right. Of course, in the traditional world, you could get liquidate on collateral in your account, but they cant programmatically do these bands of liquidation and rebuy for you, that stuff doesnt exist. Its literally only possible with smart contracts. You mentioned L2s, one of the funniest narratives. You and I have kind of been saying this for a while.
00:31:52.050 - 00:32:14.618, Speaker B: I had a tweet. I retweeted about Polkadot three years ago. I said, they'll come crawling back to Ethereum in five years. So there's two more years left there. But we're slowly seeing chains that were, we would call them quote unquote alt layer ones. Starting to crawl back to Ethereum and say, actually we're going to go the L2 route and use Ethereum as our layer one. What do you think about that? You think that's going to be.
00:32:14.618 - 00:32:29.634, Speaker B: Well, I guess first I'll ask do you think the alt layer one wars are done, or will we see that another cycle? Are they all going to just come crying back as L2s and rebranding and going that route? Or how do you see that all playing out this cycle?
00:32:30.614 - 00:32:45.566, Speaker A: Yeah. So it is a kind of relatively new trend that we've seen play out. And it's something, as you said, we've spoken about for years, that these l two s. So these l one s would transition to l two s. We saw sello do it recently, and they've been around for quite a while. They're not just a new l one. They've been around for a long time.
00:32:45.566 - 00:32:52.374, Speaker A: I remember watching a presentation from them in 2019 at Dapcon. So they've been around for ages. Right.
00:32:52.534 - 00:33:00.174, Speaker B: But then you, we had their founder on the podcast forever ago, probably around 2019. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:00.214 - 00:33:30.598, Speaker A: So it's not just like a recent kind of phenomenon, it's a pretty long term thing. Palm network, which is this NFT, like layer one that consensus launched at the time. Remember when they launched that, I'm like, why isn't this a L2? So they've done that. And I think there are a few others in the works as well that I've kind of heard rumblings about wanting to transition. But I think when you look at the l one space as a whole, you can split them up into different things. There are the l one s that really should never have been created as an l one to begin with. They just make much more sense as an l two.
00:33:30.598 - 00:34:30.966, Speaker A: And these are things like the EVM compatible l one s, they just make zero sense as an l one. But in saying that at the time, the infrastructure was not there for them to spin it up. It's only recently that we've gotten things like op stack, for example, where people can easily spin up an l two that people are now doing that necessarily blame people for building these things if they wanted to build something that was more, I guess, like better than or more scalable than ethereum. Because side chains were accepted as a ethereum scaling solution for quite a while there, probably till like at least 2019, before we changed because we started getting some roll up stuff happening. I remember optimism in 2019 started making noise about rollups as a successor to plasma. So there was a different kind of narrative back then. But yeah, over the last couple of years that has shifted squarely into rollups and now that its really easy for anyone to deploy their own roll up, you see these chains that have pretty much been failures as l ones, to be honest, they havent really gotten much traction saying, okay, well, were going to transition to a L2 for various different reasons.
00:34:30.966 - 00:35:14.062, Speaker A: And one of those reasons is to tap into the ethereum ecosystem, obviously, to tap into all of that activity, all that money there. It doesnt necessarily mean that theyre going to succeed at that. Theres going to be plenty of l two s that failed to get any traction, just like theres been plenty of l one s that have failed to get traction. But I do like the trend, uh, in saying all of that, the l one was an not over in terms of the, I guess, like fact that there are people out there who just don't like Ethereum or the l two s, right? They just don't think that the Ethereum roadmap or the roll up centric roadmap or the Ethereum design is the way to design and scale the blockchain, which is fair. I mean, you can have differences in opinions, that's totally fine. And I think the biggest communities around this, ironically enough, you mentioned Polkadot. I think they're one of the biggest around this as well.
00:35:14.062 - 00:35:38.758, Speaker A: I think that they have a very specific vision of what they want an l one to be, and they're building towards that. So I don't know if we'd see them kind of come over as an l two. It just wouldn't make much sense for what they're trying to do. Same with Solana, for example. I feel like they're always going on about being able to do transactions at the speed of light and being able to replicate the database across the world, whatever. If you want to do that, you have to do that as an l one. It's not really going to translate very well to an l two.
00:35:38.758 - 00:36:27.606, Speaker A: You could bring the Solana SVM Solana virtual machine over to ethereum as an l two and create an l two around that and use the Solana execution environment as an l two, but as a network itself, I think Solana can't really transition to an l two and Cosmos as well. Same thing. It's kind of funny with Cosmos, though, where they had this vision of app chains, app chains building and then being connected by the cosmos hub. And I think the vision was correct, the implementation was wrong, because what they tried to do was have all these chains be sovereign. And essentially what that would mean is that you would have to secure them by the token that was issued by the chain itself, by the project itself, and then you could optionally connect to the cosmos hub in order to do bridging and things like that. That, whereas with l two s, you don't have that. You can have your own token, but you basically just settle to ethereum.
00:36:27.606 - 00:37:08.730, Speaker A: And it's not really a choice. You have to settle to Ethereum. I mean, you can choose to settle your data on there or on another data availability solution, but to be a roll up, for example, you settle everything to Ethereum, layer one, and that becomes your bridging infrastructure, and you tap into all the money and everything like that. So yeah, there are differences in the l one s, but all of the EVM compatible ones, or at least most of them, I expect them to either lose market share to the l two s or to transition themselves. And I would really love to see like BSc transition, right? Or even like Tron transition, for example, because both of these things actually, funny enough, do have a lot of usage BSc does. I mean, it's more of a casino chain, but I guess that's that. You know, I don't have a problem with that.
00:37:08.730 - 00:38:10.974, Speaker A: I mean, a lot of crypto is speculative, and if that, and that's something that people do on binance anyway, such as an extension of that, whereas Tron actually has a lot of stablecoin activity on it because of the cheaper fees. So if they just transition to a L2, it would work the same way, if not better. Now, the last thing I'll say on this is that I think what's going to cause the transitions to accelerate is if the native tokens of these projects start performing better once they transition to a L2, because at the end of the day, it's all about financial incentives. So if people see if these other projects say, wow, okay, being an l two is actually good for our token, their community is going to start telling them, hey, transition to a L2. And then eventually I think that a lot of them are going to do it just for that and not even consider all the other benefits of doing it just for that financial benefit. So, yeah, but generally the l one wars amongst those l ones that I mentioned, definitely not over. And I think that it's over in the sense that I think Ethereum won, but it's not over in the sense of these things are still going to be around, and I don't think they're going to transition to an l two.
00:38:11.684 - 00:38:41.044, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think we'll see a little bit. Of course, the last cycle a lot was, hey, we're an ethereum competitor, come buy our token, and shit went crazy, right? And that was like the narrative for non Ethereum chains. There'll be a little bit of that this cycle. Still, I don't think as much as we saw in the past, but I agree, some of those chains will always exist as layer ones and we'll always have those quote unquote wars kind of going on of which stack is better. What we'll definitely see. I mean, this cycle, 100% is going to be the L2 cycle.
00:38:41.044 - 00:39:22.262, Speaker B: From the hype of people buying the tokens of the L2s to teams saying, hey, look, we're L2, come buy our token. Which, so I agree with you, there'll be pressure from token holders at the governance of the exchange or the teams that are running them to do that transition. But in reality, once stuff takes off, we're finally in a pretty good position to say, hey, look, ethereum is scaling, go pick your favorite layer too. The only thing this cycle is we're not fully there yet from a decentralization aspect or from a truly risk free aspect of these L2s. And I'll give a shout out to beat l two beat.com dot. They do a great job at kind of like, it's kind of like Defi pulse was.
00:39:22.262 - 00:39:26.918, Speaker B: I almost said Defi pulse back in the day. I think Defi pulse still exists, but I haven't heard anybody.
00:39:27.046 - 00:39:36.918, Speaker A: It is, but they changed to like, just being a message board. I think it got sold. So it's interesting. Defi llama is kind of like the replacement of Defi pulse these days. Okay.
00:39:37.006 - 00:40:03.254, Speaker B: Yeah. Been there for a while or even heard it mentioned. So it's a lot like that where it shows you the value, but they do a great job at like educating, um, you know, kind of like risks. They have like five, I think, like highlighted risk and like what each, what each L2 has done and like where the risks are. So we're still, there's a lot to do on like the technology side of improving that for L2s. Right. But at least we can say like, hey, you know, the main chain's full.
00:40:03.254 - 00:40:24.350, Speaker B: You can go over to arbitram. Optimism, whatever. I mean, gosh, you go L2 beat down. I think there's like 35 on there or something like that. And we can push people there and they can do probably lower transaction cost things. Remember back in the defi days, if you were doing a $200 trade, the fee was like $50 to trade on Uniswap. So you're down 25% on your trade.
00:40:24.350 - 00:40:56.574, Speaker B: Now. One of the interesting things, maybe we just won't see the big push until people come in and fees really start going off on layer ones. But we've seen this weird micro cap stuffed meme coins over the last couple months. People chasing like sub million dollar microcap coins and the rise of Dex screener and people just launching literal meme coins. I mean, one of them that's gone to hundreds of millions is sonic, Harry Potter ten Inu or whatever it is. It makes no sense. But that's why I love crypto.
00:40:56.574 - 00:41:30.956, Speaker B: It does make sense because it's just a stupid meme that took off. But we're still seeing all of that happen on the layer one side and I'll go look. And people are making a $100 trade, losing $10 510 bucks on transaction fees. And I'm a little amazed that stuff hasn't really moved over yet. But I'm guessing it's because right now it's more the people that the crypto native people like probably have bigger stacks and they're just chasing stuff. They don't really care about the fees. Once like retail comes in with only a couple hundred bucks to play with and they want to jump into meme coin for 1015 bucks, then they're going to want to be on L2.
00:41:30.956 - 00:41:54.828, Speaker B: But you still have this fragmented liquidity. Interestingly enough, this microcap stuff has all been happening on uniswap v two. Thats where a lot of the liquiditys been. But its tough when the teams launch whatever they put their liquidity on. Main Ethereum, layer one, uniswap v two. If you want to go trade on arbitrum or optimism or whatever. On uniswap, the liquidity is not there.
00:41:54.828 - 00:42:25.624, Speaker B: Everyone stays housed where the original liquidity was launched. Hopefully we see that transition. A lot of activity is happening over on arbitrum of course, and optimism and ZK sync and all of these. I think total value locked in L2 surpassed 10 billion just the other day. So we're getting there. Right? But I don't think we'll see the true effects of how awesome it is going to be to have scaling until stuff starts popping off and new users coming in and gas is 200 way daily.
00:42:26.964 - 00:43:09.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one thing that a lot of people seem to miss, and it's not just people on l two s or l one s, it's just generally in this ecosystem, is that the money is where the activity flows to, right? Like and big money does not care about fees. Right. They are fee insensitive, really. I mean, there are different types of big money. There's obviously the ones that do a lot of transactions, and obviously they're going to be a bit more sensitive to fees than others. But if you've got tens of millions of dollars on layer one and you're doing a transaction every other day or a few transactions every other day, you're not going to care about even paying thousands of dollars in gas fees because most likely you are making more money in profits than you are in paying those kind of gas fees. And it's just a business expense at the end of the day for a lot of these kind of people.
00:43:09.190 - 00:43:45.494, Speaker A: If you have that much money, you probably registered as a business and you can claim against that, to claim the fees against that. So liquidity rules everything. As you mentioned, there's liquidity for these things on l one. There's always the network effect there. And to move that across to l two s is maybe not as difficult as moving it across to other l one s, but it's still difficult and it's still going to take time and it's still going to take that incentive to go to these l two s. One big push that's going to happen is when base launches, and that's actually happening in the next week, apparently they said early august. So it's already live for developers, but it'll be live for users.
00:43:45.494 - 00:44:22.606, Speaker A: And I think Coinbase is obviously going to push a lot of activity there, a lot of people there, and they're going to make sure that there's liquidity there as well. I'm sure they've got partnerships with different people out there, so that's going to push things there. And the interoperability stuff as well is coming along nicely. There is obviously a lot of bridges and they have their own different risks and things, but there are other ways of doing interoperability and sharing liquidity. But yeah, as you said, needs to be that, that big push, that big incentive there. And at the end of the day, the gas fees are that push. I think that what we could potentially see this time around is that instead of people leaving Ethereum l one and going to these other l one s, just bridging across, you know, especially the EVM compatible ones, they just go to the l two s instead.
00:44:22.606 - 00:45:20.466, Speaker A: Right. Especially post ERP 4844, where for those who don't know, not only does it reduce the fees of roll ups, it also separates the roll up fee market from the normal l one fee market. So if gas fees spike normally on l one, it does not affect the l two s, because the blob transactions, which they'll be storing their data in, is different to the rest of the l one. So essentially your fees will be maintained at that low point on these l two s, regardless of what l one is doing, which obviously is awesome, right? It's awesome because there's not going to be that spike where it goes like 200 way and the l two s also go up because they're sharing the same fee market, which I think is very smart. That's something that I actually, it's been talked about for a while. It was called multidimensional EIP 1559, which is splitting out the different kind of fee markets for different transaction types. I think that Solana actually has something like that implemented on their network, where essentially they split up fee markets.
00:45:20.466 - 00:45:42.254, Speaker A: And it's a really good idea. But for Ethereum, the way it works is that Ethereum layer one is not being scaled for end users anymore, it's being scaled for L2s. And that's why we're splitting out that fee market there. So once all that comes together, I do think that we can see some pretty incredible adoption of l two next year, potentially, as the market market heats up. So, yeah, I'm very much looking forward to all that.
00:45:42.834 - 00:46:21.418, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what you just said is a very important point that people need to understand more is we're no longer scaling, like you said, ethereum layer one for users, we're scaling it for L2, where the users will go eventually. The layer one will just be the settlement layer for large transactions, for L2s, or just whales that just don't care or make huge trades or huge defi moves or whatever. But yeah, I mean, it's happening, it's coming. One of the best things you mentioned in Coinbase is Coinbase being open to these L2s. Like the other day, I had some funds on arbitrum, I wanted to move to the main layer. I just use Coinbase. Just sent them over to my wallet on Coinbase, straight off to layer one.
00:46:21.418 - 00:46:49.134, Speaker B: And like, yeah, I could use a bridge, you could wait, but it was quicker. Just that, you know, Coinbase has the support, they've got the pool ETH, they don't really care where users are moving it. So just having that, even as a power user, was nice. But as a retail user coming on, maybe hasn't used it much and doesn't want to go deal with bridge transactions and stuff. Coinbase makes it easy to just kind of like on and off to these different L2s. Yeah. And I'm excited to see the launch of base.
00:46:49.134 - 00:47:17.074, Speaker B: And I mean, the price narratives will be about L2, but for those of us that have been around for a while, it'll be way better just to see this stuff actually working right and scaling Ethereum and finally not have the endless annoying Twitter comments of how is ethereum ever going to be used worldwide if trade fees are $50? I mean, if I had a dollar for every time I got one of those last cycle, my lord. But, yeah, exciting times ahead, as always.
00:47:17.454 - 00:47:46.140, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And, yeah, I think the rest of the year will probably be more of the same, I guess generally for everything we've talked about, but, yeah, next year definitely feels like it's shaping up to be a really positive year. But I think by the next time we do another episode, base should be live for everyone, so that'll be cool to talk about. But, yeah, I think that's going to be it for. For today's episode. I think we covered everything we wanted to cover, so I hope everyone enjoyed it. As usual, we should be back in two weeks from now, not four weeks again, but, yeah, we didn't.
00:47:46.140 - 00:47:51.132, Speaker A: We didn't rug. We didn't rug this time. This is the third episode where we've maintained the cadence here, which is good.
00:47:51.268 - 00:47:54.028, Speaker B: The devs are back. The devs are cooking.
00:47:54.156 - 00:48:04.174, Speaker A: Yeah, the devs are cooking. That's it. That's it. All right. Well, yeah, everyone please, like and subscribe to the channel there if you haven't already, and we'll be back in a couple of weeks. Weeks. Thanks, everyone.
