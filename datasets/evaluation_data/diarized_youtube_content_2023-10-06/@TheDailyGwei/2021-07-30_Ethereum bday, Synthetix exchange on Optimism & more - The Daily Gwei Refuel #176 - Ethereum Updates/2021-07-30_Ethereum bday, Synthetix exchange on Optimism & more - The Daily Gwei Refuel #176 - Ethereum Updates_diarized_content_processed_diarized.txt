00:00:00.440 - 00:00:29.098, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Guy refuel, where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Susano, and today's the 30 July 2021. Alright everyone, 30 July 2021. You know what that means? It is Ethereum's 6th birthday. So the Ethereum mainnet went live on the 30 July 2015. You know, it's funny because like the ICO was actually done in July of 2014. So it was about a year from the ICO that the Ethereum mainnet went live.
00:00:29.098 - 00:01:27.864, Speaker A: And then even like the white paper was published late 2013. So it was about, I guess you could say 18 months before the kind of like Ethereum Mainnet went live and everything like that. You know what, I always think about this and think about how amazing it is that it only took 18 months from white paper to main net, whereas there's a lot of these other kind of like chains out there that have been developing for many years before they shipped anything. I mean, just thinking back now to Polkadot, they did their ICO in late 2017, didn't kind of like launch till late 2020. And even still, they're not kind of like launched with full, full features or anything like that, like the parachains and smart contracts and stuff that's just starting to come online now, you know, same thing with, I mean, I know I make fun of Cardano all the time, but like Cardano went live in 2017 with just like their staking chain and they still don't have smart contracts. Like, it's just amazing to me that Ethereum had smart contracts and ETH one was basically, I mean, ETH one isn't, isn't obviously. Or the existing Ethereum chain today is obviously very different to what it was back in 2015.
00:01:27.864 - 00:02:05.858, Speaker A: There's been multiple upgrades since then. But the core thing, like the EVM, being able to execute smart contracts, you know, proof of work and everything, that's still kind of the same. And obviously it took, you know, a while to get to where we want it to be in terms of like upgrading Ethereum, getting proof of work, you know, sharding and stuff like that is still a little bit further away. But it's amazing, like how quickly, how fast, you know, Ethereum went to mainnet after just being a white paper. And back then that was very, very different, right? It was just bitcoin and a few bitcoin derivatives and forks. Ethereum was like totally game changing back then, so I thought that was quite amazing. But you know, I was writing the Daily Gray newsletter today and it's about Ethereum 6th birthday, obviously.
00:02:05.858 - 00:02:50.142, Speaker A: But I was going through each of the kind of the years and how, you know, what, what narrative is dominated each year in Ethereum's life. So with 2015, or at least 2014, I don't think really anyone knew what Ethereum was going to be and what it was going to amount to. I wasn't around back then, but from what I can see, there wasn't really a big enough community for there to be any kind of, like, prevailing narratives. It was really, hey, you know, we want to build this thing because we believe that smart contracts or, you know, lead to all these really cool applications that can be built. But there was not enough of a community to really set a huge narrative or anything like that. Same within 2015, like when Ethereum first went live, it was really like no one kind of knew what we were going to do with the network, what was going to, like, have product market fit. It was just like a pretty big experiment at that point in time.
00:02:50.142 - 00:03:22.552, Speaker A: Then coming into 2016, we had the prevailing narrative of the Dow. The Dow was like the biggest thing that happened in 2016 in good and bad ways. Good that it showed like, the power of crowdfunding with blockchains, Ethereum specifically. And it showed like, you could tokenize or at least sell tokens and things like that and raise money. And then obviously bad is that we had it explode and we had the kind of rollback. Not the rollback, sorry, the irregular state transition, which basically took the ETH away from the hacker. And then we had the Ethereum classic fork.
00:03:22.552 - 00:03:48.810, Speaker A: So there was all that in 2016. And then 2017 saw an extension of that crowdfunding mechanism. And we had ICo mania, where Ethereum pretty much led the bull market. In 2017, you know, ETH went from $10 to basically its all time high of 1420 in January of 2018. So, yeah, 2017 was definitely the year of the ICO. Uh, then in 2018, we. I wouldn't say Ethereum had any kind of, like, good narratives.
00:03:48.810 - 00:04:19.968, Speaker A: I think 2018 really was, like, a very sobering year for the Ethereum community. ETH fell 94% from its all time high. Uh, ICO's manual obviously subsided because that was only really sustainable during a bull market. Ethereum itself didn't really have, uh, any, any kind of, like, prevailing use cases. We had some, like, very, very early stage defi stuff, but it wasn't called Defi or anything like that, and hardly anyone was paying attention to it. And we had, like, nfts, like, with cryptokitties, had, like, come and gone. And no one was really doing much stuff with nfts back then.
00:04:19.968 - 00:04:47.752, Speaker A: So 2018 was, was really a kind of. I guess the sentiment was like really low, but it was a sobering year for the people who stuck around. Then in 2019, the, the sentiment was. The sentiment, I think, changed. Like, everyone had gotten over the, the price falling. We had kind of found a bottom in December of 2018 and started to trend up a little bit again, but not really. I mean, we hung around the same kind of price for most of 2019, but essentially in 2019 we saw the first signs of like real Defi coming, coming alive.
00:04:47.752 - 00:05:20.042, Speaker A: And, you know, it was still very early, still very niche, but it was still, it was kind of like growing and people kind of like, in the know were like, yeah, we can see something here. Like, we can definitely see this being something big. And then that was 2019 for, for Ethereum, I think. And then in 2020, I mean, it was completely different to 2019, right. Ethereum, uh, had its breakout with Defi summer, um, you know, compounds, liquidity, mining law kind of, I think, launched. And I mean, x price started going back up again. Of course, we started the year at $130 ish, I think, and we ended the year at about $1,000.
00:05:20.042 - 00:06:12.814, Speaker A: So, I mean, went crazy. And obviously 2020 was also dominated by like the COVID narrative, uh, because, you know, we had, we had COVID and lockdowns and things like that. So Ethereum really kind of like had a lot of new people interacting with it and a lot of new narratives kind of coming into its own. Uh, and then in 2021, so far, we've had, I think we've had like a mix of things. It's not really just one prevailing narrative. We've had DeFi, we've had nfts, we've had L2s, we've had, you know, proof of stake going live end of 2020 into 2021, more and more people staking. So it's funny how like, I think we went from having like one or two maybe prevailing narratives during the previous years, but now in 2021, Ethereum is so big, the community is so large, the network is used by so many people and so much money is being invested in it, so many people are developing on it, that Ethereum itself has just become what we originally envisioned it as.
00:06:12.814 - 00:06:48.980, Speaker A: And that was as a world computer. You know, that was the kind of like original vision of Ethereum. Now, not to say that Ethereum is scalable as it is today still or anything like that, you know, it's still got a long way to go, but a world computer, to me, was never about being like this thing that could run every kind of, like, app on it, right? Ethereum, as a world computer meant that it was basically something that executed arbitrary code, and it was located all across the world because you, you know, different. There was miners all across the world, there was full nodes all across the world and things like that. So that's what the world computer always meant to me. But that narrative kind of, like, fell off, you know, the face of the earth. It doesn't really get spoken about at all anymore.
00:06:48.980 - 00:07:09.604, Speaker A: I don't even see anyone saying the term world computer, even to make fun of it. Like, no one's really saying that anymore. And I think that's fine. I think people now know what Ethereum is good for. You know, what the breakout use cases are, what the killer apps are, and people are just doubling down on that and focusing on that. And Ethereum is a community, social layer and cultural layer. All of those are very, very, very strong.
00:07:09.604 - 00:07:58.450, Speaker A: And it continues to feed into whatever else we're going to build, whatever else is going to be breakout as we go into 2022 and beyond. And I mentioned in the newsletter today that I really do think Ethereum is a rocket ship that shows absolutely no signs of slowing down. It is going way past the moon, it is going out into outer space, into exploring other galaxies, and basically growing much faster than, than we can even anticipate. And lastly on this, you know, I put in my tweet here, thank you, Ethereum, for changing my life. And I think that's one common theme across, like, all of the years, right? From, from, from the very kind of, like, start of it when Vitalik first posted the white paper to today, is that Ethereum has changed so many people's lives in so many different ways. You know, some of them in monetary ways. And people have, have bought ETH early on and obviously, you know, ETH appreciated, and they've, they've kind of erode that up.
00:07:58.450 - 00:08:37.270, Speaker A: But, but also in terms of, like, giving them, you know, a purpose or make, or letting them work on things, you know, that they want to work on instead of having to work for some massive multinational corporation. I mean, for me personally, I get to basically do, do the refuel, do my newsletter, help out all these kind of, like, early stage teams and stuff like that, and, and be really heavily involved with the Ethereum community. And I get to do that all on my own without, without a kind of boss. And Ethereum enabled that for me. So, I mean, it's just amazing that that I think that is incredibly sticky. And that is what causes a lot of people to stay in this ecosystem is that Ethereum has given them so much and they want to give back. So, yeah, I guess I'm going to leave it at that for now.
00:08:37.270 - 00:09:03.672, Speaker A: But happy 6th birthday again to Ethereum. Let's, let's get to many more. I think, you know, it's funny because, like, blockchains can live forever as long as someone, you know, someone's mining or staking it. As long as there's a full node out there, the blockchain can live forever. So I'm going to, I'm going to say Ethereum is going to live for many, many decades, if not centuries from now. I don't see any reason why I wouldn't. And it's going to be awesome to kind of like celebrate all those birthdays as they come.
00:09:03.672 - 00:09:27.688, Speaker A: So. Yeah. All right. I've been talking about stateful works as Beacon book a lot lately. Well, finally, the 100 physical beacon books are now being auctioned off on Mira. So you can head to the kind of mirror page here, we're linked in the YouTube description, and you can kind of put your, I guess, like place your bids in for these books. So the way it works is essentially there's 100 physical Genesis edition books.
00:09:27.688 - 00:09:49.402, Speaker A: You, you can, can go here and basically click back this project and the top 100 backers will get one of these books. There's only 25 backers so far. So, you know, no matter what you kind of like, put forward here, you're guaranteed to get a book. But the suggestion is to put forward 0.018 to cover, like, printing costs and things like that. There's also a leaderboard and everything. You know, I'm not first right now.
00:09:49.402 - 00:10:08.430, Speaker A: I'm third. But like, I'm thinking before this ends on August 3, maybe I'll outbid James here to become first. But, you know, that one eight is a lot of money there. 1.18 is a lot of money these days. And I did mint all of the NFTs from, from the Beacon book. So I think I have, I've definitely already spent a lot of money on this project.
00:10:08.430 - 00:10:43.082, Speaker A: But anyway, I think that all of you should definitely go check this out if you haven't yet. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the Beacon book by now, but yeah, this is your chance to get a physical edition of the book. Now, if you don't want to kind of like get a physical edition or anything like that, you can read the whole book on stateful works is mirror page here. It's in one of their other posts where essentially you can read all of the text that was in the book and basically see all the images and stuff like that. You don't have to purchase the physical edition, but me being a collector, I want the physical edition. I want all the NFts that went with it. So I'm definitely going to be backing this.
00:10:43.082 - 00:11:09.362, Speaker A: But yeah, I'll link this in the YouTube description for you all to check out. So, people, please, who a lot of you will know as. I mean, she's been known for creating a lot of different NFTs artwork within the crypto ecosystem, specifically Ethereum and defi. There's actually like a dao that's. That's. That's dedicated to, you know, I guess, like buying her works and kind of like buying other works as well that's centered around it called Pleaserdale. So I'm pretty sure a lot of you will have heard of her.
00:11:09.362 - 00:11:39.786, Speaker A: Well, she made a kind of, like, image here with a bunch of references to crypto Twitter. And she had it on the COVID of Fortune magazine, which is, I mean, pretty. A pretty big deal. Right? And so you can see here that in the image, there's a bunch of crypto Twitter accounts, basically. I mean, from what I can see here, you know, the bunny's band tag, you have the people on the kind of like rug there. You have Cl loomdart and Cryptodog. And then you have inverse bra, like, attempting to rug them, which I thought was a pretty funny reference.
00:11:39.786 - 00:12:00.504, Speaker A: You have tetranode on the left there playing. Playing the DJ. And then, you know, I mean, there's not just the character references. There's also, like, protocol references. I mean, obviously you can see compound on the right of this increase image. You can see the ETH logo, the BTC logo, chain link God sitting in the back there. And then you can see, like, sushi, obviously, uni, the unicorn.
00:12:00.504 - 00:12:25.240, Speaker A: Pleaserdow is those three stars. Yeah. So there's a ton of references in here. I mean, even crypto Cobain's in here, those bitcoin glasses. But this is really cool because Fortune magazine, I mean, this isn't just like an image for them to build in their cover. They've actually got a story that goes along with this called crypto versus Wall street, how the well funded tech rebels behind decentralized finance plan to remake the financial system. We're mainstream, guys.
00:12:25.240 - 00:12:53.048, Speaker A: Like, we're really breaking into it now. And not only are we mainstream, we're getting to set the culture of what this is like. No one's telling us that DeFi has to be, like, all suits and. And proper and, you know, adhere to the traditional finance culture, which, quite frankly, is pretty shit. Like, I would not want to be involved in the ecosystem that had that kind of culture of, like, big banks and centralization, all that sort of stuff, because Defi is wacky, decent, you know, decentralized. It's still very early. We.
00:12:53.048 - 00:13:25.070, Speaker A: We see these kind of things playing out where you basically have, like, all these anons on CT that are kind of some of the most prominent people within the Defi community, and they're very, very active, and they kind of, like, set the culture and set the tone not just within DeFi, but with nfts as well. So I'm really kind of glad to see this from. From people pleaser. And, you know, she's very good at kind of, I guess, putting these artworks together to capture kind of, I guess, like the. The mimetics of Defi and, like, the characters within it and the culture within it. So I'm glad that she was the one to put this together. But, yeah, I mean, I love this.
00:13:25.070 - 00:13:49.950, Speaker A: I really do, because it just perfectly encapsulates what Defi is. And it kind of, like, sets the tone and sets the theme so people can kind of get a good idea for it. And I'm surprised fortune let her do this. Right, but I think that fortune may be a bit more progressive on that front. I kind of realized that, you know, Defi is not, like, traditional finance is not like, what we're used to from, like, the Wall Street. Wall street. Kind of like, people in the Wall street kind of culture.
00:13:49.950 - 00:14:19.356, Speaker A: It is very, very different. It is much more weird and wacky and much more colorful as well. At the end of the day, it's not, you know, grays and greens and blacks and all that sort of stuff. We have all kind of funky colors, like purples and oranges and greens and, sorry, like, bright green. Like with the Wall street stuff, it's like, usually dark green, or it's like, you know, faded, faded green as well, to represent money. Whereas within crypto, we have, like, all these bright and fancy kind of neon colors and stuff like that. So, yeah, I thought this was really cool.
00:14:19.356 - 00:14:57.934, Speaker A: I'm sure a lot of you already saw this, so I'm not going to kind of, like, go on, go on too much about it. But I just thought it was a cool way to capture the culture of crypto defi. Ethereum in the image. So this ultrasound money account is one of my favorite follows on Twitter recently, and I've showed you the website that they've put together before. Actually, this ultrasound money website, I'm sure a lot of you have seen it by now. I've covered on the refuel before. It's got a 1559 countdown here, and it's got, like, the eat supply and a projection you can kind of put here where you can say, okay, well, what if there was 20 million ETH staked and, you know, the gas price was this way and how much ETH would be burned per day, blah, blah.
00:14:57.934 - 00:15:32.024, Speaker A: But they put in a tweet today, which I think is, is pretty good, is a pretty good way of reminding people about, like, what eats scarcity engines are. Now, this is something that Justin Drake has spoken about a lot on the bankless podcast, but essentially, ETH has three kind of, like, score core scarcity engines that's staking, where 6.4 million, I think that's at 6.6 million ETH has been staked so far, which is basically effectively locked because there's no way back just yet. But I think that there's going to be a lot of ETH that just perpetually stakes. Then you have Defi. There's almost 10 million ETH in Defi that's only taken three years and eight months.
00:15:32.024 - 00:15:55.516, Speaker A: This is, and this timeline is counting from, like, December 2017, where it was just maker that came out. So. Yeah, but you can see the growth, like, how much quicker it's been. It's been happening. And then the third kind of scarcity engine is obviously the burn, which activates in 155.9 hours, which was from the time of this tweet. So it's, I think it's, like, a lot less than that now, but obviously that's activating next week.
00:15:55.516 - 00:16:34.848, Speaker A: So these are the three kind of core components to why ETH is valuable. Right? I mean, why ETH is going to be considered scarce, why there's not going to be much ETH supply for people to, to buy on, whether they buy on centralized exchanges or decentralized exchanges, which I think is very, very important for people to understand. And it's a big reason why a lot of people are kind of, you know, really bullish on ETH is that these, these scarcity engines are so much better than just this vanilla. Oh, you know, we have a 21 million supply cap for bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't have these scarcity engines. They don't have staking, they don't have true defi. You know, you can have wrapped bitcoin coming to define all that sort of stuff, but that is still, like a very big centralized, centralized point of failure.
00:16:34.848 - 00:17:25.391, Speaker A: And then you have, you know, this burn, which bitcoin doesn't have either. There's no BTC being burned on each transaction as part of 1559. So ETH and Ethereum are uniquely positioned here to. And that's, you know, that's why a lot of people believe in the flipping, is because ETH just has so many more value accrual kind of mechanisms and so many more scarcity engines than something like bitcoin has. But not just bitcoin, like pretty much everything else within crypto, which I think is really interesting. And, you know, the funny thing is, some people ask me, well, what if, you know, one of these other networks? What if bitcoin implemented a fee burn? It's like, okay, well, they could do that, but it still wouldn't be nearly as impactful as Ethereum's fee burn, because if you actually look at the fees generated on all the other networks, bitcoin is only generating, I think, six, $700,000 a day in fee revenue, whereas Ethereum is generating, like, anywhere from five to 10 million, depending on what the day is. And that's on, you know, that's during kind of like the quiet market right now.
00:17:25.391 - 00:18:01.780, Speaker A: When we're at the hot market. We were generating, you know, 30, $40 million a day, more than that, during the hottest kind of days. And then all the other networks, if you go and crypto fees dot in fo, you can actually see that pretty much all of them aren't generating much fear revenue at all, except with the exception of, like, BSc, which I've spoken about BSc before the other day, and how I think that it's very hard to know if that fee revenue is actually kind of, like, real or not, but I won't go into that again. But, you know, besides that, like, pretty much all the other networks are not generating much fees at all. So even if they had a fee burn, it wouldn't really account for much, and it wouldn't really do much for the. The asset that's native to their network. So ETH is very, very uniquely positioned here.
00:18:01.780 - 00:18:31.448, Speaker A: So just a good reminder from the ultrasound money account. So some more exciting news out of the synthetix ecosystem. I should actually start with this. So the synth exchange is now live on L2. So this is live on optimism, and that means that Quinta is now enabled for trading on there. So Quinta is basically the interface you use to trade synthetix products on. And you can do all of this on optimism, which, I mean, synthetix has been pretty much the earliest team working with optimism to get onto l two.
00:18:31.448 - 00:19:06.104, Speaker A: They've had staking life for quite a while, but now this is the next level where you can basically trade a bunch of different assets here, as this is a testing phase. Right now, the only assets available for trade are synthetic USD, BTC, ETH and link, which I think is fine. I mean, this is the same deal with Uniswap where there was only a handful of assets on optimism that were available for trading. But this is awesome because I think synthetix is one of those protocols that really did suffer from the high gas fees at layer one. No, I wanted to trade, like, the synth assets and stuff like that on layer one, or very few people did. And the fact that they have, like, a really beautiful interface with Quinta now as well. People can.
00:19:06.104 - 00:19:26.226, Speaker A: More and more people can trade on here and tap into all of this. And I think it's really, really positive. So, yeah, just another app that's live on optimism for you to go use. Yes, it's still in alpha testing phases, but I think, you know, it's still public. You can all use it. And this is just the optimism ecosystem growing. You know, just continuing to grow because you have uniswap on there now.
00:19:26.226 - 00:19:51.234, Speaker A: You have Quinta on there, a chain links on there to enable, you know, the synthetics kind of integrations and stuff like that. And I'm sure we're going to see many more protocols as well. And obviously, arbitrary is coming. You know, I'm not sure if they're going to come before the end of the month. This hat is apparently getting eaten because I said they're going to be live before the end of the month. Unfortunately, I don't know if they will be, but still, they're all coming, so, you know, slightly. But surely the l two ecosystem is being built out.
00:19:51.234 - 00:20:04.316, Speaker A: It's maturing. Um, you know, as I said, this is still very early days. It's still going to be in testing and phases like that. Uh, but it's coming, and you can go play around with it, even though it's in alpha testing phase. You just have to be aware of that. Uh, and it's. And it's kind of, like, limited in.
00:20:04.316 - 00:20:27.288, Speaker A: In some way. But as we progress over the next few months, this stuff's just going to kind of snowball, I think. And we're going to have a much bigger L2 ecosystem to play with. So, uh, there was an article about 1559 and London in Bloomberg today. Now, I don't know if this is going to paywall me if I load it up here. Yeah, it's going to paywall me. But essentially it was an article covering London and 1559, which I thought was pretty cool.
00:20:27.288 - 00:21:04.354, Speaker A: Unfortunately, they did get some, some, they get like a core thing wrong, as Chainlink God notes here, where he says, where he quotes their article, which says a change called ERP 1559 will split up the roughly 13,000 new ethers issued each day for minor payment gas fees into three parts. I mean, no, this doesn't make sense. The 13,000 new ETH issued a day is protocol issuance. That's got nothing to do with the fees being paid to miners. So that definitely isn't what 1559 is about. And then I replied to chain link God saying they should have just read my piece. Right, the piece that I put out the other day with my co author, where we basically gave you a really clear overview of 1559, which you should all go read if you haven't yet.
00:21:04.354 - 00:21:35.012, Speaker A: But still, I mean, it's cool to see the mainstream publications covering the more kind of esoteric stuff about Ethereum, like London, a network upgrade, and like 1559. But seriously, this is surface level stuff. Getting this thing kind of wrong just shows how far mainstream media still has to go to get a grasp of this sort of stuff. And honestly, all they have to do is ask, like, a few of us if they're doing an article on Ethereum. Like, seriously, if they dm me on Twitter, I will reply to them. If they're from like a media outlet. Like, I see all the DM's that come through.
00:21:35.012 - 00:22:03.960, Speaker A: You know, sometimes I won't reply to them because for various different reasons, or I don't have time. But if, like, a mainstream media kind of, um, reporter contacts me and wants information for an article about Ethereum, I'm more than happy to give it to them. And that's all it takes. Like, I don't get how the, the mainstream media can still get this wrong. Like, you have access to all of these sources, not just myself, but all these Ethereum education sources on Twitter that you can just DM. And they will get, they will kind of like, reply to you. So at this point in time, I would say there's no excuse.
00:22:03.960 - 00:22:51.456, Speaker A: Getting this wrong is just like blatant laziness at this point. And getting it as wrong as what chainlink God points out here. Like, come on. Like, did they even do any research on this? Like, you, I don't even know how they made this connection. But anyway, I don't want to rant too much about that, but it just shows, like, how early we still are and how confusing this stuff still is, I think, for, for people because, you know, I'm attributing laziness as a main factor for them getting this wrong, but it might be that it's confusing for them. They might be thinking, well, you know, what's all this stuff? What's 1559? What's, you know, issuance? What's proof of stake? What's all this kind of stuff? I think it's easy to get confused, but at the same time, there's so many resources now for you to kind of, like, educate yourself and not get confused. I feel like if they just messaged, like, any of the, the kind of, like, people that are doing educational stuff, they would get their answers rather quickly.
00:22:51.456 - 00:23:31.654, Speaker A: And I do have reporters message me from time to time, and I reply to them straight away and I answer all of their questions, you know, with, with factual information. So really, there's no excuse at this point in time, but still good to see, I guess, like, a major publication covering this. I just wish that the value of the information was more accurate because I just hate knowing that people are being misled by this. And this is how those kind of, like, weird narratives start. You know how I was talking about the other day how people thought that 1559 had to do with the triple harbing? This is exactly how it starts. They see this kind of, like, incorrect information, whether it be on a media outlet or somewhere on Twitter, and then it just kind of, like, warps their view, and they think it's actually right. Like, these people reading it, they're not spreading it on purpose.
00:23:31.654 - 00:23:59.156, Speaker A: They just think that it's right because they read it on some kind of trusted resource that they trust, whereas it was completely wrong. Right. And I explained to you why it's wrong. I explained to you why 1559 has nothing to do with the triple harbing. And this is how the narrative kind of can get away from you. And narrative wars are inherently pretty hard to win. Like, especially when a narrative takes hold that a lot of people kind of, like, resonate with, and a lot of people want to promote for one reason or another, especially narratives that pump people's bags, it's very, very hard to change their opinion on these sorts of things.
00:23:59.156 - 00:24:44.790, Speaker A: So getting to it before those narratives take hold, I think is very important, but there's only so much I can do. There's only so much people like bankless can do and the defiant and defy dad and all the people producing Ethereum media. We're a small kind of group and we're not mainstream media, so there's only so much we can do. But I think as time goes on, it will get better. But I just wish that these reporters contacted people who knew what they were talking about to kind of like get clarity on this sort of stuff and not spread the wrong information. So yearn Finance announced a book called the Blue Pill, which is basically a spiritual guide for the past, present and future of yearn. It is, as they describe, a beautifully typed set book, and it's available to our 13,500 most loyal supporters.
00:24:44.790 - 00:25:26.234, Speaker A: So what this kind of like book is, is a bunch of nfts. Here you can see, and the people who can claim these nfts were the ones who originally participated in yearn's early life, whether that be as an original farmer or be part of governance or anything like that. So you can go to the link here, claim the nfts and claim the ones that are available to you. Unfortunately, not all of them are available to me, even though I was a very early, kind of like yearn user, wifi, kind of like farmer and buyer, but I didn't get all of them, unfortunately. But still, I got, I got a, I got a few of them, which I thought was really cool. So, yeah, if you are looking for some more nfts to kind of like mint and be part of the culture of of yearn, definitely go check this out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description for you.
00:25:26.234 - 00:25:58.626, Speaker A: So the ethereum.org team is building out a new security page to help protect users on Ethereum. So they're asking for that kind of feedback here, like what they are missing. I'll link this in the YouTube description and you can definitely reply to them here. But this page just in general I think is really, really great. So as I said, it's a safety tips page for Ethereum. They cover wallet security, dapp security, social media, community platforms, giveaways, like, you know, covering you for like giveaway scams and stuff like that, ETH to unstaking security, best practices, strong passwords, all that sort of stuff.
00:25:58.626 - 00:26:36.444, Speaker A: So this is a work in progress, obviously. It's not even on kind of like the main website yet, it's on their kind of staging area. But essentially this is really important because I've seen so many people for one reason or another, either get, like, rugged from, you know, from within a protocol or have their funds stolen because they put in their seed phrase into somewhere they shouldn't, or they don't have, like, their funds on a ledger. They have them all in metamask. They don't use a hardware wallet, but whether that being ledger or lattice one or something else. And, you know, they kind of, like, approve tokens into contract that they shouldn't be approving them into, and they can lose them that way. So, you know, there's plenty of ways to get scammed and to lose your, your crypto.
00:26:36.444 - 00:27:18.808, Speaker A: So I'm very glad that the ethereum.org team is putting this together. I mean, giveaway scams as well. Like, I've had a few people message me before saying they fell for some of these giveaways and kind of like, asking me, like, how do I get my funds back? And, like, I feel so bad for them, because as much as I think to myself, like, you know, I see these giveaway things, I'm like, okay, who would actually send money to kind of, like, these people? Like, this is just seems like a blatant scam to me. There are a lot of newer people to this ecosystem who aren't used to this. Right? Like, if someone, if you're very new to the ecosystem and you see this, you may not be know that this is like a well known scam within kind of like, the crypto ecosystem, and you may kind of like, you know, you may fall for it. And on top of that, I see a lot of people kind of, like putting in their seed phrase or they're, like, their secret phrase into various places that they shouldn't.
00:27:18.808 - 00:27:52.396, Speaker A: And they get fished that way because it's very easy for people to trick newer people into putting their seed phrase into a fake, like my crypto, my ether wallet page, for example. Whereas, like, they may not know any better. And it's very easy to trick people into signing a transaction on metamask that they, that they didn't actually authorize because all this kind of stuff is still very, very technical if you kind of, like, look below the surface. So I'm glad that the ethereum.org team has put this page together. You can go check this out if you want to, to kind of, like, read their security tips here. As I said, it's a work in progress, so I'm expecting much more kind of tips to be put on here.
00:27:52.396 - 00:28:44.052, Speaker A: And if you have suggestions for them, you can reply to their tweet and kind of like, give you a suggestion there. So the Altair Devnet to forked successfully, I think it was yesterday, this. And as Terrence here from the prior labs team notes, this is likely the last Devnet before forking the public paramount testnet. And he says, congrats to all the hardworking teams on making this happen. So I spoke about this a couple of days ago on the refuel about how, yeah, the next kind of like thing here is just to fork on the testnet and then that'll last for, I don't know how long it's gonna last for a few weeks, maybe a couple of months or something like that. I don't expect it to last too long, but once that's kind of like on there and working and chugging along, there'll be a main net date set, and that will be the first hard fork slash network upgrade for the ETH two network. And then after that, I'm pretty sure all the ETH two teams kind of like efforts are going to turn to the merge, as I discussed yesterday or the day before, on the refuel.
00:28:44.052 - 00:29:13.466, Speaker A: So, yeah, getting closer and closer to Altair, getting closer and closer to the merge. And obviously London is going live next week. So a lot of things happening on the Ethereum core protocol development side and really exciting to see it all coming together. And I think the next 612 months is going to be absolutely amazing in Ethereum on the, on the core protocol side, and it's going to be really awesome to see all these upgrades finally go live. But on that note, I think that is it for today, everyone. So thank you again for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
00:29:13.466 - 00:29:19.514, Speaker A: If you haven't yet, give that video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord Channel, and I'll catch you all next week. Thanks, everyone.
