00:00:00.480 - 00:00:25.758, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 23 July 2021. Right everyone, let's get into it. So the next daily gwei AMA is going to be happening tomorrow, Saturday the 24th. If you haven't kind of joined the Discord channel yet, be sure to do so because it's going to be happening in there in the voice channel. And the times will be 11:00 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time, 03:00 p.m.
00:00:25.758 - 00:00:47.446, Speaker A: Central Eastern Standard Time in Europe, 09:00 a.m. Eastern time and 06:00 a.m. Pacific time. Of course, this will be recorded as usual and uploaded to the YouTube channel about 24 hours after the AMA is done. Now, if you want to ask questions, you can ask them in the AMA series channel on Discord. Or of course you can ask them live on the, on the AMA. So yeah, hope to see you all there.
00:00:47.446 - 00:01:37.672, Speaker A: These, just a reminder, these happen every two weeks, so even if you can't attend tomorrow's one, you can definitely check out the one in two weeks from now. And actually next week there's going to be a surprise AMA. I'll have more details about that posted in the discord next week, but I have like a guest coming to do an AMA, so that's going to be really exciting. But anyway, enough on that. Actually, just a quick shout out here, the 300th edition of the Delaware newsletter is going to be published next week. And in honor of this milestone, as I've written here, I'll be dropping a fire piece on EIP 1559, which is co authored by the same guy who was recycling cans for money to buy ETH during the bear market. Now, I put out this tweet, I don't know if everyone got this reference, but I put out this tweet a little while ago that one of my friends was essentially recycling office cans to buy ETH during the bear market, like truly dedicated Ethereum.
00:01:37.672 - 00:02:05.454, Speaker A: So we've co authored that together. I think it is one of the best overviews of 1559. Obviously very timely, and I'm really excited to get that out in the 300th edition of the newsletter. So go subscribe to the newsletter if you haven't yet so you don't miss that. And just, you know, for anyone who hasn't subscribed to the newsletter yet, it's basically a daily newsletter. It goes out every weekday around the same time as the refuel goes live and basically covers one event, or at least the biggest event in the ethereum or crypto ecosystem over the last 24 hours. So I write that every weekday.
00:02:05.454 - 00:02:38.146, Speaker A: So definitely go check that out, if you haven't already. So I think the biggest piece of news of the last 24 hours at least, the thing that Twitter was talking about, I don't know if it's news, but just the thing that Twitter was talking about was the fact that the 8th hashtag now has the ethiopian flag next to it. Now this was, this got blown up on Twitter. I think people were confused by this. It is not something that Twitter put in place as a troll or anything like that. I know Jack, the co founder and CEO of Twitter, put out a tweet with just hashtag ETH with ethiopian flag there. And he's known as being a bitcoin maximalist.
00:02:38.146 - 00:03:09.272, Speaker A: So he was trolling a bit there. But essentially what this is is that the country code for Ethiopia is ETH. And what's on at the moment, the Olympics. So these flags next to these hashtags for the Olympics, they're not, they've got nothing to do with crypto. I saw Solana had one of these, these flags next to it as well. So. Yeah, and, and the funny thing is, is that I saw bitcoin maximalist making fun of Ethereum because, you know, bitcoin has its own, its own emoji next to its hashtag, whereas ETH hasn't in the past.
00:03:09.272 - 00:03:40.862, Speaker A: And now that ETH does, it's like the ethiopian flag. So I saw bitcoin maximalist basically making fun of Ethereum being like, aha. Ethereum got like the ethiopian flag, didn't get their own kind of emoji next to the ETH hashtag. But I think this is one of the greatest examples of the Streisand effect that I've ever seen. Now, for those of you who don't know what the Streisand effect is, it's basically by bringing attention to something that you don't want attention being brought to. It essentially, like, compounds and becomes like a marketing vehicle. So you can see like the kind of Streisand effect here as defined by Wikipedia.
00:03:40.862 - 00:04:29.290, Speaker A: It's actually named after Barbra Streisand. And I just want to break it down because I saw a lot of people getting confused by this. But essentially, the way Wikipedia defines it, it says the Streisand effect is a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or sense information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information, often via the Internet. These named after american entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose attempt to suppress the California coastal records projects photograph of a residence in Malibu, California, taken to document California coastal erosion, inadvertently drew attention to it in 2003. Now you can see the kind of like image here and everything, but yeah, essentially by, I guess making fun of, of Ethereum. It's just become like this massive Streisand effect where Ethereum has all this free marketing thanks to bitcoin maximalists. I mean they do this all the time.
00:04:29.290 - 00:04:57.302, Speaker A: They're, they're our best marketing vehicle and I think they play a big part in raising awareness about Ethereum even though they don't want to. But yeah, so that's kind of like the story around that. And I think just generally I like the way the Ethereum community responded to this. It wasn't like us complaining about it. We weren't kind of like saying oh my God, we got this silly flag or whatever next to ETH. We kind of embraced it and we're like, okay, yeah, like Ethiopia and Ethereum. Like let's embrace this.
00:04:57.302 - 00:05:19.750, Speaker A: I added the ethiopian flag to my twitter name here. But this is ethereum culture. This is what we do. We don't get triggered over things like this. We embrace them and, and we kind of like form collectives around them. And I saw some people even saying that we should form some dao to donate to, to causes in Ethiopia, which I think is awesome. I haven't seen anything concrete just yet, but I think that's really cool that that's kind of popping up.
00:05:19.750 - 00:05:57.878, Speaker A: So yeah, I guess perfect example of the streisand effect backfired on, on Max. He's trying to dunk on ETH again, trying to get a cheap hit in on ETH. Was disappointing to see Jack do it, but not unexpected. But yeah, anyway, that's the backstory that I'm going to move on from that to stateful works announcing that the 1559 NFT supporter NFT has sold out. Now obviously I've been showing this to you guys over the past few days and I am incredibly excited that this sold out. And they raised 243 0.05 ETH, all of which went to the different contributors, researchers, developers, all the people who made 1559 possible.
00:05:57.878 - 00:06:25.510, Speaker A: And you can actually see the breakdown of it. Now the really cool thing about mirror is that they have this thing called splits, which essentially means that you can split up the payments or at least split up the kind of funds that were raised with whatever addresses you want to split them into. So you can see here, this was the sales done. This was the price. This was the NFT sold, obviously, those 1559 of them. And then you can scroll up and see, see the splits. So you can see each address and the ownership part of the funds that everyone kind of got here.
00:06:25.510 - 00:06:52.306, Speaker A: So most of these are unknown addresses or like, they don't have an Ens or a Twitter account attached to them. But you can see here, lite clients and Tim biker. I mean, they're both ethereum core developers, researchers. I mean, every, everyone at this stage knows who Tim is, but, yeah. So that means that you can essentially claim whatever your share is. And that's really cool to see that the shares were kind of like done like this. I mean, you can see here, kitty, the one who designed the NFT as well, um, he got 2% of it.
00:06:52.306 - 00:07:17.074, Speaker A: So it's basically, uh, of that, of that, you know, 243.05 ETH. This is the percentage that would get, which is a fair chunk of change, I think, you know, 10% of, of, uh, of that number is, uh, 24 uh, ETH. That's. That's a lot of money, right? 24 times two k. You have like 52, um, not, sorry, $58,000, I think, if I'm doing my math correctly. Um, no, no, $48,000 us dollars, um, which is just awesome.
00:07:17.074 - 00:07:41.264, Speaker A: These people. I mean, I think these people deserve much more than this, but this is still awesome to see this. And this is a way for the community to get something out of it, too. I mean, we all got a really cool NFT. And the 1559 patron NFT, the one that's for auction, is still up for bidding. So if you are interested in bidding on this, it is a hefty sum of $32,000 right now, or 15.59 ETH, but it's still going for another four days and 18 hours.
00:07:41.264 - 00:08:18.494, Speaker A: Now, I didn't mention that these nfts are really cool and we all got one if we were a supporter, you know, obviously it wasn't cheap, but if you got one, you can basically kind of say that you have one, but you can display it. Here's Carlos displaying it on his digital frame, called the mural two, which I actually bought today after seeing this. It wasn't cheap, but I brought it because I've been looking for a really cool digital frame to display my nfts on. And, you know, it's coming, I think, next week or something. So you might see it pop up behind me. Maybe I'll find a spot for it behind me. But I would love to display my 1559 Nft along with, you know, all the other nfts that I have and kind of like a rotating thing.
00:08:18.494 - 00:08:32.098, Speaker A: So yeah, I'm looking forward to that. But yeah, I mean, just, just playing this video here and seeing how it works. This is so cool. I love this. I mean, and I know people can just say, oh, well, you didn't need to buy it to do this. You can just like copy paste, control, click, save, whatever. But that's not the point.
00:08:32.098 - 00:08:48.546, Speaker A: The point is that you know that you own it, right? Like you actually own the art. You have proof of ownership over it, and that's what I think counts. And, and, and obviously other people can see this. You have providence over it. It's all on chain and things like that. So I think it's really, really cool. And you know what? I would feel like it was a bootleg version.
00:08:48.546 - 00:09:14.988, Speaker A: If I essentially just copy pasted it or just control click right click saved on it and then displayed it, I would be like, well, this is a bootleg. I don't really own this. And I would feel kind of, kind of meh about it. It wouldn't really mean much to me. But the fact that I actually own this NFT means a lot to me. Now, maybe a lot of you don't, I guess, like maybe don't, don't think that's important or maybe don't get it, but, and that's fine. This is very subjective stuff here, but I still think it's very, very cool.
00:09:14.988 - 00:09:48.954, Speaker A: But anyway, congrats to stateful works for this. I mean, I've stateful works. I've showed you guys before, like the NFTs that they did and the beacon within the Beacon book and now the 1559 one. They've already planning something from the merge as well. I think I'm just going to collect every one, every NfT that these guys do. Because honestly, I just like, I love the fact that it's focused on Ethereum and Ethereum culture, really, rather than, I guess, new kind of projects building on top of Ethereum, which are all fine, like new NFT projects, I should say, which are all fine and dandy. But I like these ones that are focused on the Ethereum protocol itself and the core of Ethereum.
00:09:48.954 - 00:10:44.694, Speaker A: Because I think if I was to say what I spend most of my time on, that is what I spend most of my time on is the core Ethereum stuff, the application layer, sure. But in terms of what interests me the most, it's definitely the core of Ethereum. So the other piece of huge news over the last 24 hours, I think this was the biggest piece of news over the last 24 hours, was that Arbitrum announced that they are scaling Reddit's community points. So you can see this post here on Reddit, and a lot of you will remember the community points that Reddit has done. And they've kind of, they kind of put out this baking, scaling Bake off challenge back last year, I think it was like September last year. If I load this page up, it was, if I got the date here, October, October 1, 2020, they could play, they put this post out called the great Reddit scaling Bake off. Now, this was a competition where people do, working on scaling solutions, could submit their solutions to scale.
00:10:44.694 - 00:11:20.452, Speaker A: Reddit's community point system. Now, Reddit has chosen Arbitrum as the winner here. So what they're actually going to be doing is deploying their own instance of Arbitrum. So there's Arbitrum one, which is the first instance, and that's the one that the off chain Labs team, the ones building Arbitrum, are going to be deploying. And that's the one where things like Uniswap and all the other Defi projects that have announced that they're deploying to, there are going to be, but this one, this community point system is going to be on its own instance of arbitrary. Now, that means that is, it is effectively separate to Arbitrum one. So you can call this like Arbitrum, Reddit, for example, but it's still using Ethereum for security.
00:11:20.452 - 00:12:09.106, Speaker A: It's still a true layer, too. It is still inheriting the decentralization and security properties of Ethereum, but at the same time, because it's controlled by Red, I'm not, I'm going to assume that it's not going to be decentralized from, from the get go, right? Like, even though they say it's decentralized here, the underlying arbitrum technology is because it's structured in such a way that inherits ethereum security to an extent. But there'll be going to be admin keys. I'm sure there's probably going to be some form of, like Kyc or identification or something, at least in the short term. But I don't think that takes away from the fact that Reddit, right, Reddit is using Ethereum and using Ethereum L2s, which I think is really awesome. Now, some people brought up concerns around composability, saying, okay, well, if they're launching their own roll up, then they lose composability with arbitrum one. And like everything else.
00:12:09.106 - 00:12:47.404, Speaker A: And like, that is the reality of all of this sort of stuff, not, not just got to do with Reddit, but this is the way the world is going to be. There is no way to have composability across all of these apps with scalability while preserving decentralization and security, not even with sharding. Now, I know there are some projects out there that want to scale via layer one to keep that composability that we all know and love today while keeping the fees low, but they sacrifice decentralization and security to achieve that. So we're going to live in a world that is essentially asynchronous communication. Now, what this means is we're going to have bridges between the different L2. Now, I've spoken extensively about these bridges. Connext, hot protocol seller network.
00:12:47.404 - 00:13:09.164, Speaker A: I mean, starkware is doing bridging stuff as well. There's so many things happening, and that's exactly what's going to happen with this. There's going to be a bridge from the arbitram Reddit chain or L2 to the arbitrary one chain. There's going to be a bridge from them to ethereum. Obviously. There's going to be a bridge from that to optimism, to stock where to other chains, like side chains, like whatever. Like the polygon pos chain.
00:13:09.164 - 00:13:46.092, Speaker A: There's going to be bridges everywhere. And that's okay, because we want to preserve that decentralization and security of the base layer. And the only way to do that is to scale via L2, and sharding enhances L2. I've spoken about this before as well, a lot on the refuel. So that's kind of like how the Ethereum scaling world is going to be playing out. And I don't think that takes away from the amazing achievement that we have with these new L2s, like optimistic and zk roll ups. And I also think that the composability will be possible in an asynchronous way where you'll send a message to another chain and it will take a little bit of time to get there.
00:13:46.092 - 00:14:23.094, Speaker A: Won't be instant, but this is exactly how the web works today. Like web two world works today. It is not. A lot of things aren't synchronous, they're asynchronous, so they have to wait for things to happen. I mean, yes, it feels fast and everything like that, but to bridge between different databases and stuff like that, a lot of databases don't even talk to each other. The fact that a lot of these things are permissionless as well, where you don't have to basically say hey to the centralized company, can I talk to your database? With an API, you can talk to Ethereum. Like, anyone can talk to Ethereum, anyone can talk to these L2s as long as they've been set up in a permissionless way, which if they're not, I mean, they're not going to get very far in my eyes.
00:14:23.094 - 00:15:08.756, Speaker A: So we have these kind of like open APIs and these permissionless API standards where everyone's just going to bridge in and out of. There's just going to be so much scaffolding around that, so much infrastructure put in place. And that to me is the multi chain world. I don't believe that the multi chain world is lots of different competing layer ones, all trying to, I guess like get this kind of like piece of the pie. I think the multi chain world is Ethereum at the center, L2s and side chains all around it. And I, and I actually do think long term L2 secured by Ethereum is going to be the thing. I think sidechains serve their purpose, maybe in the short to Medium Terminal, but long term, I'm very, very bullish on Layer twos on Ethereum, basically filling all scalability needs and that is to me the multi chain future.
00:15:08.756 - 00:15:25.668, Speaker A: But anyway, really awesome to see this from Arbitrary. I mean, this is super exciting. This happened like a few, I think it was like 20 minutes after I went to bed. I went back and checked the time that this was announced. I'm like, oh my God, I missed this like by 20 minutes. But it was like 03:00 a.m. So I was alright with it, but I woke up to this News and I was like, this is absolutely amazing.
00:15:25.668 - 00:15:53.762, Speaker A: So I, I'm really excited about this. You should be too. You can go check out this post for more details about this. But you know, Reddit, I mean, Reddit's huge. So it's going to be awesome to see how they, how they continue with this and it's going to be awesome to be able to play around with this sooner rather than later. So I put out this tweet today where I said the holy trinity of Ethereum and then I listed three ips. Here I have EIP 1559, EIP 3074 and EIP 365.
00:15:53.762 - 00:16:52.760, Speaker A: Now 1559 I'm not going to talk about, you all know about 1559. There is absolutely no reason for me to rehash it again. As I said, I have a post coming out next week on in the newsletter about it that will give you a nice high level overview of it before it goes live, you know, within the next few weeks. But the other two aips I do want to go over a little bit. So AIP 3074 I have spoken about this on the refill before, but 3074 is a scalability up scalability usability upgrade for Ethereum. Now what this does in simple terms, and the way that users are going to get the benefit out of this is it makes it so that developers can code up their smart contracts in a way where instead of having to do two separate transactions like an approved transaction and a swap transaction on something like Uniswap, you can do this in one transaction where you do the approve and the swap, and you only have to pay the gas once, you only have to sign the transaction once, you don't have to do two separate transactions. That is a massive, massive ux upgrade.
00:16:52.760 - 00:17:35.808, Speaker A: Like I can't tell you, and I'm sure you guys feel the same, how much it annoys me having to approve tokens every single time, interact with a new smart contract for every single token. Now I get why it's there for security reasons, but it is incredibly annoying having to do that all the time. So that is a massive user upgrade there. But I mean, this is more for developers and there's a lot more to it than this, of course, but I think this is the main kind of thing that at least that the easiest way I can break this down for people. But essentially, you know, it does a lot more than that from, from my understanding. But I think that is one of the major, three major eips coming within the next twelve months. And then on top of that we have EIP 3675, which you'll be forgiven for not knowing because it's new EIP.
00:17:35.808 - 00:18:25.476, Speaker A: It was only put forward 22 hours ago as of time of recording, but this was put forward by Mikhail here, who basically describes this EIP well. The title of it is upgraded consensus to proof of stakeholder and he describes it as a specification of the consensus mechanism upgrade on Ethereum mainnet that introduces proof of stake, aka the merge. This is the EIP for the merge. Now I spoken about the ETH one to ETH two merger before on the refuel, but just a quick summary. It's when we get rid of the proof of work consensus mechanism for Ethereum, we merge the current ETH one chain into ETH two by using the beacon chain as the new consensus engine for that ETH one chain. Now, you may have seen this referred to as the consensus layer, which is the beacon chain, and the execution layer, which is going to be the ETH one chain we know and love today. That's essentially what this EIP is.
00:18:25.476 - 00:18:48.054, Speaker A: Now, I don't think I have to go over why this is such a big deal. I mean, you can all pretty much get why it's such a big deal, but this is. I mean, I would say this is the most important. IP 1559 is the second most important, I think, and biggest. And then 3074 would be the third. But this is by far the most important in Ethereum's history. The culmination of six, seven years worth of work, research, development.
00:18:48.054 - 00:19:22.484, Speaker A: In addition to that, it's a massive security and economic upgrade to a theorem. It is exactly why I have been buying so much aetherium over the years, so much ETH over the years, or at least one of the reasons, not, not the only reason, but is one of the reasons, because I wanted to stake it and I am staking most of it. And on top of that, I really like the fact that Ethereum is not going to have to deal with the ESG narratives that bitcoin is going to have to deal with, you know, as time goes on. So, yeah, really positive EIP 367 five. You can check this out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description. There's a bunch of comments in here you can read through the specification for yourself if you'd like to do that.
00:19:22.484 - 00:19:47.200, Speaker A: So the index co op has announced the bankless bed index in cooperation with the bankless DaO. Now, what this index is, is basically equal weighted exposure to bitcoin, ETH and the DPI, the DeFI pulse index here. So just a disclosure here. I am an advisor to set, which is heavily involved with index co op. I own index tokens, and I'm good friends with the bankless guys. I just want to get that out there. Um, but I'm not just, you know, covering this because of that.
00:19:47.200 - 00:20:25.684, Speaker A: I think this is actually a really cool kind of product that appeals to a different set of people than maybe, you know, us hardcore people within the crypto ecosystem. I think this is definitely something that can be suggested to, you know, your normie friends or your, or your family and say to them, hey, you know, if you want passive exposure to crypto, here's the bed index. This gives you exposure to BTC, Ethan, DPI. Um, and, you know, they will, they will have heard of DeFi or at least rumblings about it. And if they're asking about it, and then they might be asking you, okay, what can I buy to get exposure to defi? And, you know, what can I buy to get exposure to Ethan? BTC? And this is the. I think this is the perfect product here. Now, is this a product that I would buy? Probably not, because I.
00:20:25.684 - 00:20:52.856, Speaker A: Well, one I don't want bitcoin exposure to. I manage my own investments because I'm so, like, deep in the ecosystem. But this product, as I said, is not made for people like you, you and I. It is definitely made for people who are looking for, like, passive and easy exposure from crypto. So definitely go check this out, if you haven't already. I think it's a great product. I think it's already got over a million dollars of aum in it, which is really cool to see.
00:20:52.856 - 00:21:28.580, Speaker A: But generally, you should definitely suggest this to people when they come up to you and ask you how to get exposure to the whole ecosystem. I think it's really cool and really easy way to get exposure there. So I came across this piece that I missed yesterday from Andrew Bakst, and it's titled ETH, the world's most valuable asset. So there's a blog post here, and it's also available in a PDF version. But essentially what this does is it goes over ETH as an asset and Ethereum as a network from a different lens than what I've seen before. It maps it to, like, the traditional finance system, how Ethereum improves upon it. It's got a bunch of nice graphics here and pictures which you can follow through.
00:21:28.580 - 00:22:04.214, Speaker A: I mean, as I was reading it, I was like, this is really, really good. Like, I really, really enjoy this. I'm glad that I came across this again. But essentially it pulls together a lot of what you may have seen. You know, the bankless guys talking about myself talking about a lot of people in the ecosystem talking about and kind of just like, contextualizes it, which I really like. When people do that, when people bring all this stuff together and contextualize it and contrast it with different kind of like, things, whether it be the traditional finance system or like the web two world, I think that works really well to kind of like, give analogies for people and allow people to kind of dive deeper into this, this sort of stuff here. So, yeah, I highly recommend giving this a read.
00:22:04.214 - 00:22:24.702, Speaker A: Obviously, I'll link it in the YouTube description. And I just wanted to quickly shout out to Andrew, if you're listening. Thank you for putting this together. I mean, this is the first, um, I've seen of you and of your work, and I really love it. So keep up the good work. I'm looking forward to future pieces you do on ETH and whatever else you do, really, on Defi or whatever. If you've got more coming here, and I did comment that you were going to make it, and of course you're going to make it.
00:22:24.702 - 00:22:53.924, Speaker A: If you're into Ethan, you think ETH is the most, the world's most valuable asset, as I truly believe it is, then you are going to make it for sure. All right, so last up here, we have a tweet from Brantley from Ens domains who said the number of unique Ethereum counts that hold at least one ens name just past 100,000. And you can see there's a Doonata leaks dashboard here. My camera is probably covering it. No, no, we got it all good. You can see the total names created is over 300,000. You can see, like, different charts and the monthly registrations that spiked last month.
00:22:53.924 - 00:23:23.274, Speaker A: And I went over why they spiked, you know, gas fees being cheaper, people realizing the Ens names were actually nfts, things like that. But also enos just getting more popular generally, I think because more and more people are realizing that they want a name and they want a name attached to their Ethereum address, especially for things like the metaverse. And they want to be able to show off the NFTs on their, you know, ens on their Ethereum addresses. They want people to know who they are. So I think that's why we saw a big spike there. Um, but yeah, this is really cool. You can check out this doing analytics dashboard.

I mean, ENS has been around for quite a while now. They've been doing amazing work. I love my Ens name, Cecil ETH. Right? Everyone knows me by that.
