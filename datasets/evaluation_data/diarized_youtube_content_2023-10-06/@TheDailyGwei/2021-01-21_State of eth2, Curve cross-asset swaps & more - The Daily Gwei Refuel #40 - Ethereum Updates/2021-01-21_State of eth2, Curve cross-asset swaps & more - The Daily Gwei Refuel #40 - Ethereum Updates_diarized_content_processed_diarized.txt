00:00:00.440 - 00:00:43.240, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Wave refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 21 January 2021. Alright, everyone, there's a bit of a sell off in the markets over the past, I guess, 12 hours or so. Yeah, we've come down from, you know, oh, well, this is the last 24 hours, right. We've come down from like the all time high back down to under 1200 here at time of recording, you know, particularly bad over the last twelve. Yeah, 12 hours or so, down from 1390 to under 1200. Now, I mean, this is typical crypto, so I'm not gonna like, harp on about this or anything, but the reason I wanted to quickly just mention the price is because I put out this tweet today.
00:00:43.240 - 00:01:30.844, Speaker A: And, you know, it's funny looking back and zooming out on things. So I wrote in the tweet that in March of 2020, during that massive crash that we had, you could have scooped up some ETH for $90, right? And even for a couple of days, it was hovering around $100. You didn't have to catch the exact bottom, but you could have, you know, scooped some up for about $100. So the funny thing is about this is that if you had bought at around, you know, even like, if you had bought 90, $90, say, right? And then, you know, a few hours ago, the price was $1,300, you had made like 13 times your money essentially, in like ten months or eleven months I've got written here. So it's always good to zoom out in times like these. Obviously, sometimes it doesn't work. Like during a bear market, you know, if you bought the top of the last bull market and you held down to like $80, you've obviously lost over 90% of your money.
00:01:30.844 - 00:02:10.016, Speaker A: But I think in general, you know, time in the market beats timing the market. So, you know, the longer you're in the market, you know, even if you bought, you know, even if you bought at the very top, you know, you're almost back in profit. You were back in profit, like, you know, a couple days ago, most people didn't buy at the very top. Top, right. You know, even if you bought at $800, right. Just a few weeks ago, you got back into being in profit, and that's after, you know, obviously a long time, maybe two, two, three years. But it's always just good to zoom out because if you pay attention to, you know, the day to day movements of these markets, a lot of it is noise.
00:02:10.016 - 00:02:32.494, Speaker A: A lot of it isn't going to give you any context of things. It's actually going to warp your view of the market. So just a little bit of advice there on how to view the markets, not how to invest or how to trade, just how to view the markets from. From a different perspective. Cause, you know, I do the same thing. We all kind of, like, love to just check the price every day, right? Especially when it's going up. You know, that feels good.
00:02:32.494 - 00:03:01.450, Speaker A: But then when it's going down where, you know, we're like, oh, my God, what the hell? But you can see here, right, that $1,200 ETH is like three days ago. Like the 18 January, right? We were at that three days ago. So when you zoom out like that, you kind of can see how these, these kind of, you know, dumps here can, can look like nothing, right? And then, you know, this is the 1 hour chart. And if I scroll out to, like, the one day chart and then fix up the chart here, right. It doesn't really look like anything. Yes. Okay.
00:03:01.450 - 00:03:28.000, Speaker A: This is a pretty, pretty red candle here. But, you know, we had one of those, you know, just a couple of weeks ago, or even less than a couple of weeks ago, then we trended back up. You know, there's plenty of these. You can see them all on the chart here. There's plenty of these red daily candles. And then you can go, I mean, if you zoom out even more, go to the monthly chart and like, look at this. We're still in the green, like massively in the green, right? So, you know, the further you zoom out, the better it looks, you know, over time, especially during, even, even during bull market.
00:03:28.000 - 00:03:53.564, Speaker A: So just something to keep in mind that I wanted to kind of bring up, you know, just as the markets seem to be selling off right now, which is, you know, it feels crappy, but always zoom out. That's what I always like to say. So Josh Stark and Evan van Ness put out their year in Ethereum 2020 recap today. It's quite a lengthy blog post here. It's about a 14 minutes read. I read through the whole thing. I suggest you go do the same.
00:03:53.564 - 00:04:25.398, Speaker A: It's a brilliant kind of blog post. It will give you a recap of what happened in 2020. Not so much about what I did in my 2020 recap video where I went through what launched the projects that launched, get my thoughts on it. They kind of go through the themes here of the year. So how Ethereum basically overtook bitcoin in a few different metrics like, you know, settlement value settled on the network, fees paid, all that sort of stuff. Then they move into the Ethereum creator economy, like nfts and art and things like that. That kind of boomed in 2020.
00:04:25.398 - 00:04:55.010, Speaker A: I think towards the end of 2020 it definitely boomed. Yeah. You can see here from the chart. Then the other big theme was Defi, obviously, especially decentralized exchanges, which, which again, grew extremely quickly towards the, you know, I guess second half of the year of 2020 and then onto Ethereum scaling upgrades. So L2 especially, and obviously ETH two as well. That was another big theme of 2020. And then, yeah, I mean, they go on and they summarize, you know, what, what they think it all means.
00:04:55.010 - 00:05:27.112, Speaker A: But basically, I highly suggest going to give this a read. I really liked how they broke it up as different themes and segments about what we saw in the year because I do think DeFi was, was big and it was probably the biggest thing for Ethereum of 2020 and what drove a lot of the growth. But, you know, nfts, the creator economy was huge. ETH two launching obviously was very, very big. Layer two scalings, you know, got, got hotter throughout the year. And then Ethereum overtaking bitcoin on a bunch of different metrics was, was huge. Right? I mean, that kind of coincided with the DeFi growth.
00:05:27.112 - 00:05:47.186, Speaker A: So I would say DeFi is responsible for a lot of that, especially stable coins and things like that. But yeah, so this is great. Go give it a read. I'm not doing it justice by just summarizing it. It's got a lot of great stats in there and it'll give you some context. Right. It's good to zoom out, as I said just before, to get some context around and not just price, but like how far we've come as an ecosystem.
00:05:47.186 - 00:06:11.502, Speaker A: Because even if I just show you the chart of, even if I go to like the decentralized exchange chart, right. We were doing like, you know, kind of meh volumes until mid 2020. Right. We, we were all bullish on it. Like a lot of us that have been in the ecosystem will bullish on Defi, bullish on decentralized exchanges. We kind of knew that this was going to be the next big thing on Ethereum. We knew it was going to be lasting and provide a lot of value.
00:06:11.502 - 00:06:38.334, Speaker A: But until recently, we didn't see that materialize. Right. And then once we did, it kind of like, you know, it shows the strength here of Ethereum and defi. So it's really great to see that put into context, you know, and kind of zooming out over the last few months. So an update from Danny Ryan on the state of ETH two. This is quite a long blog post as well. It's available in English and Mandarin, so you can go give this a read.
00:06:38.334 - 00:07:11.424, Speaker A: It dives into basically, you know, as the title says, the state of ETH two. You know, how, what, where we're at today with the beacon chain, how it launched, how much easy staking, you know, the status of it, how it's going kind of. And then it moves on to focus on like what's coming this year in, in ETH two. And also he talks about ETH one and how ETH one fits into this picture. And then he talks about how the different phases that you've probably heard of, of ETH two, like phase zero, phase one, phase two. They don't have to be kind of like sequential. They can happen in any kind of order.
00:07:11.424 - 00:07:37.192, Speaker A: Obviously phase zero, the beacon chain has already happened. So, but we can actually do the merge before we introduce sharding, for example, or we can do sharding before the merge, or we could do this before that. So it doesn't have to happen in a specific order. It's just whenever it's ready, basically. So that was really cool to see. And he explains it quite well here. And then he explained, he goes on to explain like, you know, what sharding actually means in this context.
00:07:37.192 - 00:08:12.906, Speaker A: So you might have seen that we're going for sharding of data first and then execution and state. Sharding kind of comes later because it's a more difficult problem. It requires more research and development there. But the shard, sharding the data gives us more scalability at L2, which is what we want, of course. So he goes, you know, and explains about that, kind of talks about the state of ETH two clients, kind of on the state of 1559, AIP 1559 and stateless Ethereum and a bunch of different things here. So really great summary here. I highly suggest that you go and read it if you want to know where ETH two is today.
00:08:12.906 - 00:08:50.712, Speaker A: And there was also a blog post yesterday that I spoke about from, from Sigma prime that went on about kind of like where we were today in ETH two as well, and kind of like what it looks like from an engineering and development perspective going forward to get this full kind of roadmap done. And it's just really great to see all these teams putting up this content, talking so, so candidly about this because they seem very, very excited and committed to the mission, you know, more so than ever. Right. They launched this beacon chain that's, that's great and everything. It's a huge part of ETH two, but they want to see it through to the end. Right. They want to get it done right because they want, you know, at the, I mean, at the moment there's not much to it, right.
00:08:50.712 - 00:09:23.388, Speaker A: The beacon chain validates itself. Right. You stake and validate, you know, the beacon chain staking balances and all this sort of stuff, whereas when we get to the later phases, we have actual user, you know, interfaces on their state execution, smart contracts, all this sort of stuff. And we can actually, users actually get the benefit. But for now, you know, it's kind of, you know, limited. But I think, you know, the developers, the researchers are very, very dedicated to getting this whole thing rolled out. So, yeah, obviously looking forward to that in 2021 and 2022.
00:09:23.388 - 00:09:59.624, Speaker A: I think the merge will happen in 2022, 2021, we'll probably see sharding going live and EIP 1559 for sure. But the merge is both complex and it needs to be done right the first time. There can be no kind of screw ups here. I mean, they can be technically, in terms of like if it's screwed up, we can just revert it and try it again, but that's just messy as hell. You don't want that to happen. So, you know, while technically there can be a screw up and the Ethereum network would probably recover from that, I think we'd much rather not have that. So it's going to require a lot of test nets.
00:09:59.624 - 00:10:26.460, Speaker A: It's going to require the beacon chain to be live for at least six to twelve months, I would say, to make sure that it's stable and can handle ETH one and not kind of like buckle under the load or anything like that. So. Yeah, and Danny talks about this in this blog post as well. So definitely go give it a read. So Sigma prime released a new kind of lighthouse release today. That lighthouse is their ETH two client. So if you're running the lighthouse client, be sure to go and update it here.
00:10:26.460 - 00:11:10.760, Speaker A: I mentioned the other day that Prism, Prismatic Labs had released a new version of Prism as well. So if you haven't upgraded and you're using Prism, definitely go do that. It's always good to, to upgrade here because as you know, the post here says these kind of things contain stability improvements, right. They contain bug fixes, a bunch of other improvements, you know, potentially making your validator more profitable depending on, on the fix and stuff like that. So highly recommend going and upgrading, if you haven't already. So an interesting tweet here from Codadan ETH. He put out this tweet basically saying that another developer called Nick Mudge has bridged Avez interest bearing a tokens to Matic network, which is.
00:11:10.760 - 00:11:44.254, Speaker A: Which is a side chain network. And he even created a pool on a Dex called Quick swap. Dex to swap between USDC and MA USDC or matic MA USDC, yes, or Matic Ave USDC, which is the matic version of a USDC, which is really cool. I mean, he says here, defi meet L2. I've gone on about this so much and, you know, I feel bad whenever I have to correct people on this, but Matic is not L2. It is a side chain. There are specific differences and very important distinctions to make there.
00:11:44.254 - 00:12:12.770, Speaker A: But, you know, I think that's just a failure on the community's part, that we haven't done enough education around this. So that's why I bring it up enough. But I'm not going to harp on about it now. You know, Matic is a scaling solution. It's just a side chain rather than a L2. But that still doesn't take away from the point that, you know, aave is bridged into this kind of side chain. So, you know, you can potentially get more scalability on Matic network than you do on the Ethereum main net, which is the whole point of these side chains, and then it allows you to do all these things.
00:12:12.770 - 00:12:46.668, Speaker A: So it's really cool to see this implementation already done on there. I don't think it's an official implementation. It doesn't seem like Nick works for Aave. No, works for Aave Gotchi, which is like another project that's building on Aave, and so does this Codedan person as well. So, yeah, I think that, you know, they obviously work closely with the Aave team, but not the official Aave team. And I'm still curious to see what L2 solution or what scaling solution in general, Aave decides to use, whether it's, you know, a side chain or L2, like, you know, optimistic or ZK roll up. I think they're waiting.
00:12:46.668 - 00:13:17.754, Speaker A: I don't think it's as urgent for Aave to move to L2 as it is for other apps, because if you look at Aave's growth and what they actually offer in terms of products, their growth is amazing. They're still going up. Their product is a money market where pretty much it doesn't really make sense to do small value transactions anyway. So the gas fees aren't really going to eat into your profitability here or what you're doing. A lot of people tend to do these large transactions. Right. You know, anything a few thousand dollars transaction definitely justifies the gas fees, considering the rates that you get as well.
00:13:17.754 - 00:13:44.708, Speaker A: So I don't think there's that much of an urgency at this .5 air. Whereas like something like Uniswap, obviously it appeals to more than just big traders, right? Appeals to lots of small retail traders who want to do maybe $1,000 trade. And, you know, the gas fees can eat into that at times, you know, 50, up to $100 gas fee, depending on how, how clogged up the network is. Same with synthetix. Right. So I think certain apps require scalability sooner than others.
00:13:44.708 - 00:14:11.352, Speaker A: And aave and compound and money markets in general, I think can wait a little bit. It's not critical for them. So, still curious to see what L2 solution they decide to go with and what, what scaling solution they decide to go with. I think we might see them end up on optimistic Ethereum because synthetix and Uniswap are going to be there. But at the same time, you know, ZK roll ups already have like, a pretty vibrant ecosystem too. So the jury's out here. I don't know.
00:14:11.352 - 00:14:36.434, Speaker A: You know, obviously the other day I spoke about how one of the other team members said that, well, hinted at optimistic Ethereum, but who knows if that's gonna materialize. He might have been trolling us. So. We'll see. We'll see. But yeah, I just thought this was interesting that someone's just, you know, building on their permission as permissionlessly with matic as well, and kind of, you know, playing around with this and showing what can be done. I just thought it was really interesting.
00:14:36.434 - 00:15:16.378, Speaker A: So an interesting tweet from Andre today that was quoted, quote, tweeted by Degen Spartan here. So Andre's tweet, I mean, this, this guy can just tweet out an ethereum transaction hash and get everyone talking. But basically what it is, it's the, the curve synthetic swap, the cross cross kind of protocol swaps that I talked about the other day. And at this point, I think not enough people are talking about how incredible this actually is and how amazing this feature is. So you can see digent's button here. Broke it down. So what ended up happening in this transaction was 9 million USDC was traded for 6689 synthetic ETH using curve.
00:15:16.378 - 00:15:52.654, Speaker A: So this, the transaction flow is, is as you can see here, the. The USDT is traded for SUSD on curve, and then the SUSD is traded for se on synthetics. Right. So you can go from like, do a large order through this cross asset swap at very low slippage because you're going through the USDT and s USD pool first and then sust to SE because they're synthetic assets. The slippage is basically non existent because. Because of the fact that it's a synthetic swap on synthetix exchange. And on top of that, there's a.
00:15:52.654 - 00:16:30.276, Speaker A: There's a fee, of course, but this is the fee that goes to the synthetix platform, which is $26,859 of a fee for this transaction, which I think is 0.3% or something like that. So a $9 million transaction, you don't mind that you're paying $27,000 of fees, I don't think. Right. You just have to think about it in a percentage term, not an absolute kind of value term, but yeah, I mean, this, this is one of the biggest things to happen in a while in Defi. And, you know, I always like putting a light on things that I don't think are being spoken about enough or being paid attention to enough. Obviously, this kind of thing isn't going to appeal to the everyday trader.
00:16:30.276 - 00:17:13.948, Speaker A: It's really just going to appeal to whales and trades of large size. But the whales and the traders doing large size and the kind of market makers that also do this are the ones that basically provide a lot of the liquidity for Defi. So giving them more options to go in and out of things, to do various things on defi to provide more liquidity, you know, all that good stuff. There's nothing kind of, like, bad about that that benefits everyone, not just the whales. So really, really exciting to see that. I think that we're going to see more and more of these swaps happen as, you know, more and more market makers and whales clue into this sort of stuff. Because I think, you know, it's funny, I was actually discussing this with some friends earlier about, you know, how early DeFi was until recently in terms of just in the crypto ecosystem.
00:17:13.948 - 00:17:54.374, Speaker A: You know, up until a few months ago, before we had defy summer, even people in the crypto ecosystem didn't know what DeFi was. So if you think of. If you think about that and how crazy that is, that something that had existed within Ethereum and pretty much everyone in Ethereum knew what Defi was. Um, and then, you know, obviously there's other crypto communities, they didn't know what DeFi was. They didn't know how big it was. You know, maybe they thought it was a scam because, uh, you know, depending on what bubble they were in, um, they might have believed it was a scam or whatever. But now we're at the point where like Defi is an inevitability and more and more people are coming on, and more and more traditional finance people are coming on and people from the centralized exchange and service space are also coming on, which is extremely bullish.
00:17:54.374 - 00:18:58.514, Speaker A: And those are the people that these products are going to appeal to definitely because of the fact that a lot of them, you know, especially coming, you know, from the traditional finance space, they're gonna be, you know, market makers funds, you know, traders like big trade hedge funds and big trading kind of prop shops coming in to defi and thinking, okay, well, is there liquidity for this? You know, can I do this, can I do that? And liquidity matters a lot for these guys because slippage can be brutal, right? I don't think there's any decentralized exchange right now out there where you can trade 9 million USDT for 6700 ETH, essentially without incurring some serious slippage. Maybe they, maybe there is for this pair, but if there was, I don't think the person would have done this trade or this trade was still cheaper because of the fact that this, there might have been more slippage. So, yeah, this is just really great for those large trades. And as I said, that trickles down to everyone else in the ecosystem. It's not just for the, for the whales. So definitely pay attention to that. I'm curious to see more of these trades go through and to see how, how this evolves.
00:18:58.514 - 00:20:08.920, Speaker A: So gitcoin put out this tweet today, basically thanking their matching partners that make bitcoin grants possible. You know, it kind of got me, got me thinking some more. Like, look at all these ecosystem projects, right? And I guess you can call them angels like Fernando from Balancer, Andrew from Dharma Capital. Basically, you know, there's a group of people and projects here that are putting up funds to get coin grants as matching. And those will go out to the rest of the ecosystem to fund open source development, open source media and all these sorts of things which, you know, I've spoken about it before, but this is just, I mean, so incredible, right? And the fact that, you know, the reason why we have so many of these kind of teams and people donating money and match in matching funds now is because of the bull market, you know, the more capital that comes into the system means that the more money can flow into these public goods and the more generous people are. You know, you can see it not just from like bitcoin grants, but also from all the projects getting funded in general, like all the funds spinning up, you know, investing millions of dollars into new projects and everything like that. That's because of the fact that there's a bull market and the prices have gone up.
00:20:08.920 - 00:20:38.960, Speaker A: So, you know, it's incredibly reflexive like that. And I'm sure during the next bear market we're going to. Unfortunately, you know, depending on how deep this, the next bear market goes, we're gonna have the thing where, you know, git coin grants rounds aren't maybe not gonna be as big as the previous rounds in the bull market. And that's, I think that's just natural. I don't think that's something to be concerned about, but make the most of it while we've got it. I think I want to see more projects. I want to see every, you know, defi project with it, with a war chest or with a treasury to, you know, match providing matching funds.
00:20:38.960 - 00:20:56.448, Speaker A: I mean, the other day I spoke about how Uniswap has a $500 million treasury. I want to see them use that in gitcoin grants. Like, come on, let's do it right. That's, that's a huge treasury. I'm sure you can spare 500,000, maybe a million dollars. Hey, you hate uni governors. Maybe you want to do that to give back to the community.
00:20:56.448 - 00:21:20.476, Speaker A: I, you know, obviously Uniswap has already done a lot, but why not do some more? A million dollars out of 500 million, that's nothing, right? If I'm doing my math right in my head it's like 0.2% or something like that. I think I'm doing my math right. Yeah, that's like nothing. And as I said the other day, that treasury of 500 million is actually 2 billion once it all vests out. So, yeah, I. And Uniswap's not the only one.
00:21:20.476 - 00:22:02.882, Speaker A: Synthetix has a massive treasury and they're obviously already doing it, you know, in finance are doing it, you know, balancer Labs Harvest, the Ethereum foundation, you know, and we're seeing centralized exchanges in here like Kraken and Binance, which I thought was, was really cool. So, yeah, I mean, it's just great to see this. It always warms my heart as someone who has benefited greatly from Gitcoin grants through both ETH and the Daily Gwei. And as someone who was given a lot of money on Gitcoin grants as well and had my donations matched, I just, I love it. Git Coin is one of my favorite platforms on Ethereum, one of my favorite apps to use. And it just provides so much value and joy to the community. And it's basically all positive sum.
00:22:02.882 - 00:22:51.342, Speaker A: You know, it's all going to projects that kind of need it to open source projects that like do it for free, daughters passion projects and things like that. And allows them to build more open source software, allows them to do more open source content on the media side of things. So yeah, just wanted to kind of, I guess, talk a bit about that because as git Coin says here, these matches are the, the heroes Ethereum needs. Alright, last thing to talk about today. So yesterday I spoke about and how much, how excited I was about loop rings new fast withdrawal feature from L2 to layer one where it was basically withdrawals from L2 to layer one within 30 seconds, which, you know, obviously is mind blowing. So Philippi from Zero X Horizon games, or I think it's just called Horizon Horizon games. Yeah, yeah.
00:22:51.342 - 00:23:21.258, Speaker A: He basically put out this tweet quote, tweeting loop brings announcement and says this is one of the best features of ZK roll ups. You can even do redeposits in your withdrawal transaction like this. So he gives an example here. You can withdraw token a from the ZK roll up z. He's calling it trade token a to token b on uniswap on the layer one main net and then deposit token b into the ZK roll up. And you can do that in a single main net transaction. And step two can be anything on Mainnet.
00:23:21.258 - 00:24:20.266, Speaker A: So we're getting closer to this point where we can do these more, you know, I guess you could call them composable transactions between layer one and L2 because we haven't really been able to do that because of the slower withdrawal times. And that's been a massive worry people, you know, thinking of breaking composability and all that sort of stuff. But I think that, you know, as we get these more faster withdrawals out there, as we get them down to basically, you know, I'm sure there's a way to do it and maybe the reason it hasn't been released yet, but I want to get to a point where we can securely do a atomic transaction from L2 to layer one. Maybe, maybe it's impossible. I don't know. I don't know enough about the technicals and what I mean by an atomic transaction is basically do it all in one block, right? One Ethereum block where you do what Philippi it said here and basically trade and do whatever you want within one Ethereum block like you would with a flash loan, for example, and then it still go back to L2. I'm sure that's possible in some way.
00:24:20.266 - 00:24:50.906, Speaker A: I'm not sure if it's possible in a fully decentralized, secure, you know, copy of layer one main net way, but we'll have to see. So there. I thought that was really interesting. I love these examples of things you can do because it kind of shows people the use cases, right. And it shows people just what's possible here. And as I said yesterday, super excited about loopring, doing this fast withdrawals, because it's going to make the user experience a lot better. People are going to realize the power of L2 a lot quicker and they're just going to move forward as an ecosystem here.
00:24:50.906 - 00:25:06.194, Speaker A: So really great to see all of that. Right, everyone, that's it for today. Thank you again for watching and listening. You can subscribe to the YouTube channel.
