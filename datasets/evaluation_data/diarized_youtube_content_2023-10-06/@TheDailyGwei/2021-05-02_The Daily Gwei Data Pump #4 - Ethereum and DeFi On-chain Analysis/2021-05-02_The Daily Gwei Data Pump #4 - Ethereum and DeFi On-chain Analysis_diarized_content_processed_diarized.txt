00:00:00.400 - 00:00:23.990, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the fourth episode of the dailyguay data pump. In these episodes, I go over various on chain metrics for both Ethereum and Defi. Today's episode is going to be covering the months of March and April. So let's get right into it. Alright, so March and April were very big months for Ethereum's price. You know, a lot of you will remember what happened in February. We had like a pretty, pretty nice spike up, I think.
00:00:23.990 - 00:00:51.770, Speaker A: What was it at the start of February? It was 1270. We went up to 2100 or so. And then by the end of February we're back at about 1300. So since then, up until today. So I'm recording this on the 2 May. So basically all of March and April, we started March 1 off at 1420 here, which is the old all time high, the old ETH all time high. And then we're up at almost $3,000 at time of recording over just two months here, which is quite crazy.
00:00:51.770 - 00:01:34.718, Speaker A: That's, that's over a two x in that, in that timeframe there. Now, the reason why I bring up the price, it's not an on chain metric, but I do like to kind of contextualize the episode because once I go through all the metrics, you'll be able to kind of relate it back to price and we'll be able to draw some conclusions from the metrics and what, what possibly drove the price of Ethan and maybe what was bearish for ETH, you know, during these kind of downtrends we saw here. But yeah, that's, that's basically the price action for the last kind of two months there. So I'm going to move into the on chain metrics now. So this is a new one actually, from glass node here, which is one of my favorite sites for tracking this sort of stuff. And this is basically the number of transactions on Uniswap based on the seven day moving average. Now you can see how hard this spiked up.
00:01:34.718 - 00:02:06.806, Speaker A: Like obviously this is more than March and April. This goes all the way back to basically July here. But you can see like how hard it spiked up here and then kind of went sideways for a bit after defy summer kind of cooled down and it's going back up again now, which is, which is quite cool. Right. And, you know, you can overlay the price here and see if there's any correlation. Doesn't seem to be really, and I wouldn't expect any correlation between the price and number of trades happening on Uniswap. But still the growth is actually quite cool because obviously the gas fees up until, I guess, the last couple of weeks have been really high and people were still doing uniswap trades.
00:02:06.806 - 00:02:39.442, Speaker A: It wasn't like they, they kind of stopped and the trades fell off a cliff, I guess, during December. It seems that, you know, we had a, I guess December and January was like kind of a fall off there. But since then, you've gone back up and we're at basically all time highs for number of, number of Uniswap trades per day here, which currently we're at 200,000 trades per day, which is, which is quite crazy. Just to give some context here, back in July 1, it was only at 25,000 trades per day. So. Yeah, really good to see this. I really like this chart from, from glass node here.
00:02:39.442 - 00:03:09.234, Speaker A: As I said, one of the new ones, and they only started tracking it back in June here. You know, the data only goes back to June. I think they're just tracking Uniswap V two here for now. But obviously uniswap v three will be out soon, which, which is going to be cool to see how that goes. And then obviously L2 as well. I'm going to go into different L2 metrics later in the episode because I've got some stats around that. But I'm interested to see how these data kind of, I guess, centers and, and trackers split out the layer one, L2 things.
00:03:09.234 - 00:03:39.290, Speaker A: And like, if I actually have a toggle for that because I do believe you should toggle between layer one and L2 when looking at the various data here and be able to kind of like, put it together as well. So. Yeah, really interesting metric here. Maybe not much you can kind of get from it for the price of, I guess, ETH. But maybe if you overlaid the uni price chart here, you may get some correlation there. But I don't know, it's funny because, you know, uniswap isn't just like uni trading or ETH trading, like the tokens trading on Uniswap. There's thousands of them.
00:03:39.290 - 00:04:26.458, Speaker A: Right. So, you know, you wouldn't expect any of them to kind of, I guess, like correlate with, with the number of transactions on Uniswap. But at the same time, I guess, like, you know, the more transactions, the more fees, and theoretically, the more valuable the uni token is once the fee capture gets turned on sometime in the future. Right. So from that perspective, I think that does inform it and, you know, probably has some correlation to the Uni price but I would also say you would have to consider things like, is it a leading or lagging indicator? Right? Like, is. Has. Did the uni price spike a couple weeks after the number of transactions on Uniswap spiked? I think maybe because I think it takes, like, a little bit of time for that information to flow out into the ecosystem where they start, you know, recognizing, oh, my God, there's lots of revenue kind of like being generated by uniswap here.
00:04:26.458 - 00:05:09.366, Speaker A: And you could have picked it from the number of transactions chart. So, yeah, I am, I'm curious to see how this plays out with more data. Obviously, we've only got maybe, I guess, like ten months of data here, not even nine months or something like that. So, yeah, I'm curious to see if this informs any price movements in the future. So this is the number of active Ethereum addresses on Ethereum. So if we kind of, kind of look back maybe six months here, we can see, I mean, I was just showing, like, all here you can see that's an all time highs, basically. And, you know, it's funny because I'll talk about this when I talk about the gas prices kind of on Ethereum, but it's funny because you look at this and you're like, okay, well, you know, gas prices are down, but the number of active Ethereum addresses are up.
00:05:09.366 - 00:05:33.992, Speaker A: So the network activity is still kind of up and still kind of up there and is at all time high. So why are gas prices down? Why explain this in the Daily Gray newsletter and on the refuel last. Last week. But essentially, there's a lot of transaction. Sorry, there's a lot of transactions going through flashbots. The gas limit was increased. Right? So we get these cheaper transactions now, and, you know, the network activity is still high.
00:05:33.992 - 00:05:57.244, Speaker A: Like, they still. The number of active addresses are really high. The number of transactions on the network is still at all time highs and things like that. So, yeah, just really cool to see that it's at all time highs here. I mean, this, this crazy spike was just absolutely insane. If we look at 2017 and from October to basically January 2018. So October 2017 to January 2018 was just an absolutely insane growth.
00:05:57.244 - 00:06:23.814, Speaker A: It went from 130,000 active addresses to, at peak, about 660,000. So, you know, maybe about a four or five x there in a matter of like two to three months, which is absolutely insane. But you can see here the growth has been more steady. It has kind of spiked up here. And I'm trying to find a reason. I haven't found it yet. So why this this spiked up so much, there must have been something that happened on the network that caused this.
00:06:23.814 - 00:06:56.218, Speaker A: But, yeah, it was, it was quite. Maybe, maybe it correlates with the cheaper gas prices. Maybe people got more active again because they're like, they were waiting for gas prices to come down to do a bunch of things on, or maybe there's their secondary addresses or whatever that they're farming with, and it's. Maybe they've got some airdrop tokens they wanted to sell. That could be an explanation there as to why we saw this kind of spike here. But this is based on the seven day moving average. If I go to zero days here and we kind of, like, zoom in, we can see, you know, I guess, like it went up and peaked at 700,000 active addresses, and then it kind of came down to 622,000, back up to 671.
00:06:56.218 - 00:07:51.704, Speaker A: So there is some variance here, but still the trend is up over the last six months and over the last year as well, of course. And, and, you know, this, this spike happened in April, and I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna chase that theory down maybe, maybe a bit later, where the, the fact that the gas prices are low means there's more active addresses because more people are doing more things and they're not priced out anymore. That, that could be a legitimate reason. I haven't actually looked into that, but, yeah. And the final thing here, I guess, is the price action. Obviously, I don't know how much kind of like, alpha you can get from this metric alone, because if you look at the price action, I would say it's obvious that the price going up would drive more activity on the network, which means that this would probably be a lagging indicator, the active addresses, rather than a leading indicator, because I think that the activity on the network spikes with, with price movements, not the other way around. So, yeah, still an interesting metric to look at and still great to see it at all time highs here.
00:07:51.704 - 00:08:46.304, Speaker A: All right, so this is the ethereum, the percent of ETH on exchanges, on centralized exchanges here, which is currently at, I think it's a two year low. So the percentage of ETH on centralized exchanges is around 12% right now. And the last time it was that low was back here in November of 2018. So obviously, people are looking at this as a really bullish signal that, you know, eats coming off centralized exchanges, which means it's going into cold storage and all that sort of stuff. And you can see there's a very kind of clear, I guess, like, correlation, at least lately, between the price going up and ETH going off exchanges. But then if you look back and you kind of see during the bear market, which is quite, quite, I mean when you look at this, I don't know if this is like a data error, but it's kind of weird that you would see balance on exchanges being so low when the price was kind of going down. Right.
00:08:46.304 - 00:09:17.276, Speaker A: The price was I guess like from the peak here going down like considerably, and then the percent on exchanges was going down. You would expect that to go up. Right. So maybe there's an error in the tracking here. But still, I think this is, I mean, I think it's more relevant lately simply because a lot of these ETH is actually going into Defi as well, I think. So what ends up happening is a lot of this ETH won't just go into cold storage, it'll go into backing as collateral for Defi, it'll go into ETH two. So it's actually being locked up.
00:09:17.276 - 00:09:47.754, Speaker A: Right. It's not, it's not part of the active supply anymore. A lot of it, some of it is in defi like within uniswap and things like that. But on Makerdao, you know, being used as collateral for Ave or compound, you know, the only reason to borrow these assets really is to short them or to do some yield farming. But you're better off doing yield farming with stable coins than like ETH. So yeah, a lot of that ETH supply is just getting taken off the, off the kind of active market here and pushing the price up. You know, it's basically an inverse correlation, like exactly here.
00:09:47.754 - 00:10:21.654, Speaker A: But again, always hard to pick what's a leading and lagging indicator, I think. But in general, it's just really insane to see how closely correlated this is over the last, you know, I guess what you can, you say here, I'm just zoomed in here actually I should zoom back out to get a better picture of it. But be it basically, I guess like the last six months or so, four or five months or so. So yeah, quite, quite insane there. And there was a, there's a chart that shows like this, the percent in smart contracts. I can't remember if I have it up here. Yeah, I do.
00:10:21.654 - 00:10:42.174, Speaker A: Okay, I'll show it this next. So basically the percent in smart contracts is actually, you know, at almost all time highs. So it's at like 22.8%, which is, which is quite crazy as well because a lot of, I'm wagering a lot of this is going into that. And there's actually, again, an inverse correlation. Right. Where ETH going in smart contracts.
00:10:42.174 - 00:11:04.810, Speaker A: Smart contracts is going up and Ethan, on a centralized exchanges, is going down. But if we also think about ethan, smart contracts, this includes multi signature wallets as well. So it actually includes cold storage, too. So all of this ETH isn't in d fire and e two or whatever. It's. Or anything else or like nfts or whatever. It's in cold storage and multi seat contracts, too, which is.
00:11:04.810 - 00:11:22.454, Speaker A: Which is even better, right? Like just sitting there being taken off out of the active supply as well. And, you know, I mean, the last time it was this high was. Was the. The Dow, essentially, when people were putting, like, all the Ethan to it, the Dow. And at the time, the price was like completely different. I mean, you. If you look at the know price back here, it was like $15.
00:11:22.454 - 00:11:38.654, Speaker A: So 23% of the eat supply at $15 and 23% was. Was less of the ETH supply. Sorry. It was more of the e supply back then because there was less of it. But 2023 at $15 is still. Doesn't even hold a candle to 23% at $3,000. Right.
00:11:38.654 - 00:12:07.292, Speaker A: And 23% now is how many. How much ETH is that? If. Just off the top of my head, it's probably something like 2020, 5 million ethanol at times that by 3000, you get a lot of ETH, right? You get a lot of dollars. Like tens of billions of dollars there. Whereas back here, if you did 25%, I think that the eat supply back in June of 2016 was maybe 80 million, maybe 90 million. I'm not sure exactly. But if you take that and do a 2020 3% there, you'd probably get around like 15, 20 million or something like that.
00:12:07.292 - 00:12:23.184, Speaker A: If I'm doing my math right. And at $15, that's basically nothing, right? That's. That's not very much at all. So it's not even a billion dollars if I. If I'm doing my math right there. So, yeah, you can see the stark difference here. And I think that's simply because, you know, there wasn't much reason to put your ETH into smart contracts back here besides the Dow.
00:12:23.184 - 00:13:04.152, Speaker A: You can see the spike of the dow, and then the dow hack happened, and then, you know, all the ETH kind of got drained out again. Or at least most of it got drained out again there. And then, you know, it went sideways for a long time, even during the last bull market, because actually, you know, a lot of icos weren't even using smart contracts, so they didn't even count here. A lot of icos were actually just using an EOA and externally account, which is it could have been a multi c, it could have just been a normal wallet. Whereas, you know, you can see here, like, the, basically the rise of Defi really made a difference here. So, yeah, really, really cool to see that again. You know, you can see the price is tracking this quite closely, but the scales are different here.
00:13:04.152 - 00:13:41.064, Speaker A: So, you know, like the, you just look at like, the price going up and, and the, the percentage mind contracts going up. But again, I don't know if it's a leading or lagging indicator. It seems to track price pretty closely, which would make sense, I guess, ETH going out of cold storage into exchanges and things like that. But, yeah, I wouldn't take much alpha from this. Maybe over the longer term you would, because if you expect this trend to continue, but the short term doesn't seem something like you could trade on. All right, so we're at the fees now. So I think this is the most interesting thing that's happened over the last, I guess, couple of months here.
00:13:41.064 - 00:14:00.128, Speaker A: Definitely the fees right now are very low. Like, if you look at my extension here, that's 26 way for a, for a fast transaction. I don't think it'll come up on the screen here, but. Yeah, 26 for a fast, 27 for rapid, hovering around 30 for rapid, you know, most of the time here. But that's still very cheap. Right. And as I said, there's a few reasons for this happening.
00:14:00.128 - 00:14:38.770, Speaker A: There's the gas limit increase, which means we can actually fit more transactions into a block, which means that, you know, even though the, the, the gray price is down, if we, if we're still at capacity and we're still feeding more transactions to a block, more fees are being paid. So it's funny how that works, right? And then there's also flashbots, which is something you, you may have heard about, where miners. Sorry, not miners. People who want to extract Mev are skipping the public mempool and going directly to miners, which doesn't show up here in this chart. So there could be all these other fees being paid, like, out of band, right, outside of what the network can see. Um, and then I think they are. And that wouldn't count towards this.
00:14:38.770 - 00:15:07.934, Speaker A: Um, now, the interesting thing is to see, like, kind of how it's evolved over the last, I guess, like six months is. It's very like, I mean, this is based on the seven day moving average in, in USD, of course. So you can see here basically we seemed to have peaked at about $34 million, $35 million, based on the seven day moving average. And then we've dropped down to about $15 million right now. If we. If we just do zero day moving average, it looks a lot more pronounced. You can see here that, you know, the highest was $50 million in a day.
00:15:07.934 - 00:15:26.350, Speaker A: And then after that, it dropped considerably as well. Kind of, like, went back up a little bit. Went up the other day to another 50 million and then back down, and we're at basically 14.3 million right now, or actually 14 million. So. And then, you know, I mean, if you can go all. It's still, like, dwarfs, basically, all the other transaction fees over the years.
00:15:26.350 - 00:15:49.482, Speaker A: It absolutely dwarfs 2017. Um, but I did want to. Want to stay on this a bit more about, like, kind of the gas fees being down. And I've had people ask me, they're like, okay, well, if gas fees are down, won't this hurt a IP 1550 nine's ability to burn? You know, lots, lots of e. Like, everyone wants to happen. It's like, well, yeah, of course, like, if the fees. If there's less fees, there's less ETH being burned, like, straight up.
00:15:49.482 - 00:16:30.190, Speaker A: But this is where it gets. It gets a little bit interesting. If flashbots is responsible for taking, like, a considerable amount of transaction fees out of, sorry, transactions out of the public mempool and rerouting around it, but they're still making fee revenue, then what ends up happening is that with ERP 1559, these miners that are on the receiving end of the flashbots still need to pay ETH to the base chain for the base fee. So there's still going to be ETH being burned, even though these. My. These MeV extractors are going around the public mempool. So, from that perspective, that base fee is based on the current Gwei price.
00:16:30.190 - 00:17:19.636, Speaker A: So will that drive up the Gwei price? Like, will we get to a point where it's, like, becomes more profitable to not go through flashbots again and just go through the normal mempool? It's going to be interesting to see play out. But that's the beautiful thing about 1559, is that even if you're going around the public kind of mempool, and even if you're trying to avoid paying public fees, you still have to burn ETH. The miners would still have to burn ETH to once to put your transaction into a block because of ERp 155 nine's base fee mechanism. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And, you know, $15 million, even if we say that only 10 million of dollars of this will be burned, which I think is going to be more than that, but just say 10 million, that's still 10 million ETH being burned every day right now. And as I said, the higher the gas limit, the more transactions. And it doesn't necessarily mean that.
00:17:19.636 - 00:17:52.098, Speaker A: And obviously, the lower the the way price, but that doesn't mean that we get less fever revenue, necessarily. Right. Because you can see here, the gas limit was about the same back here, and we had even lower fees during March. So fees are highly dependent on, like, network activity as well. And, you know, general network activity, especially arbitrage, and a lot of the arbitrage activity and front running and kind of stuff like that has been taken into flashbots now. So again, I think flashbots counts a lot for a lot here. Obviously, the gas limit made, it made a big difference here as well.
00:17:52.098 - 00:18:13.002, Speaker A: But interesting to see how this is playing out. And obviously, like, the prices, you know, has gone up, but I don't think the price and the fee revenues actually correlated at all. I remember some people saying on Twitter when, when the gas price is kind of low, it's like, oh, my God, this is so bearish for ETH. He's going to dump. And it's like, it's never been like that. There's just been no correlation between the two. Little to no correlation.
00:18:13.002 - 00:18:39.600, Speaker A: I think the narrative of 1559 burning ethnic and kind of like the fee revenue going to, to burning ETH is going to be a fundamental driver. Because if you think about it, where does ETH go right now? And fees. Right. Goes to miners. And, you know, what, what are miners doing? Well, they're going to inevitably sell it. So it's just selling pressure. So, like, logically, you know, the ETH price shouldn't go up, right, based on, based on this sort of stuff, it should actually go down if we're, if we're counting that.
00:18:39.600 - 00:19:11.882, Speaker A: And, you know, network activity can spike for any number of reasons. The fees can be high for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the ETH price. It could be some, you know, it could be a defi summer, for example, where the ETH price is kind of trending up a little bit, but not, not really doing much, where, you know, all these other defi things are doing a lot more. So from that perspective, it's quite, quite funny to see that. And, you know, even look back at Defi summer here and, like, the highest that spike to indiefly some was like $17 million and that was without flashbots or anything. That was the old gas limit and stuff like that. And then, you know, you can see how we've wafted here.
00:19:11.882 - 00:19:45.770, Speaker A: I'm curious to see where we baseline. Do we, do we keep going down from here? Do we see like sub ten gas or gwei transactions again going through? That'd be, that'd be kind of, kind of cool, I think. And then, you know, obviously people come back to Ethereum and able to do a lot more things because the gas is cheaper and things like that. But yeah, the fee stuff is definitely something that I've been keeping a very close eye on myself and I know a lot of, a lot of other people in the ecosystem are as well. But yeah, something to keep an eye on, that's for sure. And see what we bought him out on. I'll definitely be following up on that one in the next data pump.
00:19:45.770 - 00:20:16.588, Speaker A: In next month's data pump. Alright, I'll do some data from the block here. So Ethereum's adjusted on chain volume is at all time highs right now. So if I just, I mean, this is the all time high, the all time chart you can see here. Just for some context, we're well above like 2017, kind of like, I guess 2017 2018 peak here. But if we just go like year today, let's zoom in here and see like where we're at. So basically from at the beginning of the year, the adjusted on chain volume based on the seven day moving average was $3.2
00:20:16.588 - 00:20:42.986, Speaker A: billion a day. So what that means is that the Ethereum network is processing in volume. I mean it's, it's, it's kind of like stipulated here. The adjusted transaction volume is a measure of the economic throughput of ETH on the Ethereum blockchain. So this only counts ETH. This doesn't count tokens or anything like that. This doesn't count, I guess, other value being settled on the network, other, other kind of value flowing back and forth within the network.
00:20:42.986 - 00:21:13.720, Speaker A: It's just ETH. So, you know, it spiked up at $14.6 billion here, $14.7 billion here on the 9 April, and that's settled at current time of recording about almost $12 billion here. But it still kept going up like, and these spikes are fine, but the general trend has been up. I mean, if I zoom back out to all here, you can see the spikes on the chart and this is of course a linear chart, but you know, the general trend is still up. And you know, even if it comes back down considerably, it's still kind of like trends up there, which is really cool to see that.
00:21:13.720 - 00:21:50.686, Speaker A: And I think at this point in time, maybe not at this value, but like most days, ETH, Ethereum is settling more value than bitcoin just from ETH. Like not even including all the other tokens like stable coins and things like that, which is huge. And last year I pretty sure Ethereum settled a trillion dollars on the network or even this year, like if you annualize it out. So yeah, lots and lots of value being set on. And of course this, this tracks the price, right. The higher the price of ETH, the more, the less ETH you need to move around to kind of have the same amount of impact here. So if more ETH is moving around, it's going to have a more pronounced impact on, on the, on the kind of like adjusted volume here.
00:21:50.686 - 00:22:27.234, Speaker A: But yeah, you can see big, big kind of April here with, with wrapping here. And I think that maybe because know, the ETH price started spiking after that, obviously that, that bad march that we had. And then you know, it went back up into April and then you know, basically continued on from there, dropped down here and then kept, kept going from here. There's probably another event that this correlates with that I'm not remembering right now. You know, it could be the FAE protocol launch. Actually, maybe, maybe it could be the FAE protocol launch. I can't remember exactly, but that sucked in a lot of ETH really, really quickly, which means a lot of ETH moved on chain.
00:22:27.234 - 00:22:52.694, Speaker A: But yeah, I'm actually curious. Did much ETH move around November. Yeah. So it's funny because a lot of ETH moved around November, which is the, I guess like November 24 was the deadline for ETH to be in the deposit contract for ETH two. So a lot of ETH got moved around there, which makes a lot of sense as well. So yeah, just a really interesting stat here from the block. This is a really, really interesting, interesting stat.
00:22:52.694 - 00:23:31.756, Speaker A: Percentage of ETH supply in profit based on the seven day moving average. Now this obviously tracks the price, right? Like this is based on the price. It tracks the price. But I still think it's super interesting because it can act as a measure of, I guess kind of, I wouldn't say calling tops because you would expect, you know, as it's hitting more all time highs, 100% of the supply is going to be in profit. And this is the on chain supply. But if you look at the, the bear market kind of, you know, chart here. And you look at basically 2018 and 2019, it seems to have stopped at about 2020% to 25%, 25 ish percent every time.
00:23:31.756 - 00:24:07.276, Speaker A: Right? Every time. The three bottoms that ETH paint here, or, like, almost this one as well, 30%. It seemed to stop at 25% of addresses in profit. So I would say that those addresses are the ones that were, like the ogs, right? The ones who just have no reason to sell, even at, like, $80 at what eve bottomed out around here. So I actually think this might serve as a really good indicator of the bottom of the next bear market. This threat is only, you know, three or if you count this one, four data points, it is not going to be anything, like, super predictive. But I do think that if this.
00:24:07.276 - 00:24:26.054, Speaker A: If this kind of, like, keeps holding, and I do think it makes sense that they're kind of, like 25% here. But, you know, I definitely think that it can be an indicator for, like, a local bottom here. And there's actually another. Another kind of chart that I want to show. Actually, I didn't show it. I haven't got it loaded up here. Maybe I should show it.
00:24:26.054 - 00:24:48.622, Speaker A: Actually. I'll just show you what I mean by percentage in profit. So there's this thing called the net unrealized profit and loss indicator, or Napoleon. This is really great as well. So you can see here the green zone is essentially, like, you know, most people are in profit. Okay, so I should explain how this metric works. The way this metric works is that it measures the addresses in profit, but also measures how much during profit by.
00:24:48.622 - 00:25:12.908, Speaker A: So are they up ten x? Are they up 15 x? Right. And. And aggregates that altogether. And basically the. The blue zone is essentially, like, everyone's, like, super rich, right? Paper rich. Everyone's made so much money off ETH, you know, and it has worked before as, like, a kind of, like, local top indicator here. So, like, the perfect example is what happened in 2017 when ETH ran from ten dollars to four hundred twenty dollars in six months.
00:25:12.908 - 00:25:41.000, Speaker A: Everyone was in massive profit, right? And then they had. There was that massive dump where ETH went from 420 to 120 in, like, a month. So, you know, we're not. We haven't been in the blue zone yet. We've just stayed in the green zone. And the green zone, basically everyone's, you know, not nicely in profit, or at least most people are in profit, but they're not in profit by, like, a huge amount just yet. So when we start going into the blue, and we can stay in the blue for a while, I mean, the blue started here in 2017 in April and went till July.
00:25:41.000 - 00:26:08.324, Speaker A: So we can stay in the blue for a while. But once we're in the blue and if you, if the price keeps going up while, while you're in the blue, if it you just means that, you know, sooner or later the price is going to have like a massive pullback because too many people are in profit. People want to take profits here. So that that might be like a nice indicator there. But, you know, and one more thing I will mention. This is the longest streak of green that ETH has ever had. So if we look here, November 2020 to today, that's six months.
00:26:08.324 - 00:26:52.082, Speaker A: The last longest streak of green was September 2017 to November 2020. So like two to three months here. So the longer we stay in the green, I actually think the better. And it just feels healthier, right? I mean, we all look at the price a lot and if you kind of look at what the price is doing and how it's growing, it just seems much healthier that it's not like just teleporting, you know, for instance, like, you know, it's at almost 3000 today. If it went to 4000 in the next few days, that would mean that a significant majority of the network were in significant profits or 100% of the network were basically insignificant profits. And, and you would expect a pullback from there, right? You would expect like quite a, quite a large pullback. And, you know, if we went 3000 to 4000 in a week, I would expect this to go into the blue because of that as well.
00:26:52.082 - 00:27:36.274, Speaker A: And, you know, it could stay in that mania phase for quite a while as well. That's why this indicator is, is cool, is okay, but like it's, it's kind of hard to use it as like, I guess a top signal at times. Because if you say, for example, you sold like right here on April when it went into the blue the first time while the ETH price in April here, if you look here, it's about $50, right? And then ETH went to 420 after that in the blue the whole time. So manias can get really crazy. Crazy. Like if we go into the blue at 4000, you know, ETH would go to 10,000 or something before it kind of tops out and comes back down. So this is just a good, I guess, indicator to look back in the past and say you, you want to be as, you know, as risk averse as possible.
00:27:36.274 - 00:28:23.650, Speaker A: Well, then when it goes into the blue, maybe, maybe you sell, right? Maybe, maybe you sell and you're fine, but in general, I think this again is better at spotting kind of bear markets because it stays red for quite a while. And you can see here like this massive kind of spike down to $8. The first time meant that, you know, most of the network wasn't in profit and basically in on, in profit by, you know, by, I guess, like in negative, in loss, essentially. Sorry, losses were amplified here for a lot of people. And that's why you had that massive kind of like dip here in the red. So I do think this is a better bear market indicator than a bull market one, but still interesting to see when this is going to go into the blue for the first time here. All right, so since the last data pump video, the block has added scaling solutions, metrics, which is, I think is really cool here.
00:28:23.650 - 00:28:46.882, Speaker A: So you can see here now the value locked of Ethereum scalings by scaling solutions by type in the first chart on the left here. So they've got valid ian valydium, which is a form of ZK roll up. Oops, sorry. Get rid of this. They got plasma, which is obviously a L2 solution that's been around for a while. ZK roll ups, optimistic roll ups, and state channels. Now, this growth has been quite phenomenal lately, actually.
00:28:46.882 - 00:29:07.726, Speaker A: And you can see, like, if I take out optimistic roll ups here. Sorry. If I take out optimistic roll ups, because they've been live as on synthetics, right? Only as far as I know. You know, we can kind of get a cleaner picture here because I do want to kind of, I guess, look at things that have more than just one app behind them. So valid. I'm. I'm pretty sure is.
00:29:07.726 - 00:29:29.838, Speaker A: Is, man. What? Which one's valid? I'm. I can't remember which app is using validium right now, but it's. It's star quest technology. So whatever apps using that plasma, pretty sure that's matic, the matic plasma chain and msigo as well. ZK roll ups is Zeke stuff like loop ring, optimistic roll ups. I'll just add that back in that synthetix right now.
00:29:29.838 - 00:29:50.298, Speaker A: And state channels, there's ride in and connects network and things like that. So, yeah, I mean, the. This will. This will obviously follow price because this is denominated in us dollars. So when the assets fall sharply in value, then the value locked will fall sharply as well. But still, General uptrend again here. And then they've got a value locked of a theorem l one bridges here.
00:29:50.298 - 00:30:25.222, Speaker A: So you can see that, you know, the bridges, I guess, like BSc has been dominating, you know, for a while now. BC's in dark, dark blue here. But the polygon pos chain is, is making moves, you know, widening, kind of like their market share here. Avalanche, Xdai, Ronin, and I guess others here are small share of the network. So essentially, it's a battle between BSc and Polygon right now. And what this measures is basically the amount of value locked in the smart contract that you send your, you know, funds to, to be able to use them on BSc or polygon here, or the polygon Pls chain. So, yeah, cool metric.
00:30:25.222 - 00:30:44.860, Speaker A: Their value locked in plasma solutions. So, yeah, as I said, like polygon, Omcar and Gluon as well, which, which I'm pretty sure is part of the leverage decentralized exchange validium. Here's the validium thing. So, ZK swap. Okay, yeah, now I remember. And stark where here. So ZK swap starkware.
00:30:44.860 - 00:31:07.380, Speaker A: And I wonder where they have Dy Dx of. Dy DX is in the ZK roll up section here, along with loop ring. So you can see, you know, loop ring had had dominance for quite a while here, but then you start. Stockwood got released recently, and they've been growing. And same with ZK, sync has been growing because of git coin. Aztec and immutable and Hermes are relatively new, so they're, they're kind of less here. But yeah, loop ring still dominates here.
00:31:07.380 - 00:31:35.340, Speaker A: And then value locked in, optimistic roll ups. Obviously, synthetix dominates because they're the only major app live on optimistic roll ups here. So, yeah, I can't wait to visit this, you know, maybe even in a few months like these, these charts and see how things progress here. I want to see this. When optimism goes live, it's like a public main net. When arbitram goes live with optimistic roll ups, when stark where goes, kind of live with more of their stuff that they're doing, and obviously polygon as well, and things like that, because I think it's going to be really cool to keep. Keep an eye on here.
00:31:35.340 - 00:31:57.462, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's, that's the scaling solutions, metrics. You can find all these data. I'll link it all in the YouTube description for you guys to go check out as well. So, BTC on Ethereum has been a big theme since defi summer, and it has not slowed down. It's just kept growing. Like, you can see here, there is, I guess, like a huge amount of BTC on Ethereum. I think it's over 200,000.
00:31:57.462 - 00:32:21.898, Speaker A: And, I mean, it does go down sometimes, but, you know, the general trend is just up right. And this is obviously rather bitcoin is dominating. But, you know, second place here is HBTC, which is huobi bitcoin. Ren BTC seems to be kind of like steady with market share here. And then the smaller ones, synthetix, BTC, TBTC, and IM BTC. So, you know, Im actually surprised that HBTC second here. I would have thought maybe that was Ren BTC.
00:32:21.898 - 00:32:51.788, Speaker A: But I guess, like they're not too far apart, but not surprised at all by WBTC being the dominant thing here. They were first to market. Their liquidity begets liquidity. So they were able to get like a massive market share here. But, yeah, I guess, like if we, if we just look at March and April and see how kind of like it progressed from there, I guess we can do the last three months. Let's go March, March here, the total was, what, 175,000? So yeah, 200,000, 205,000. So another 30,000 bitcoin was added over the last two months.
00:32:51.788 - 00:33:20.942, Speaker A: So obviously it slowed down. If we zoom out here, it slowed down, but still it's trending up. And I think, you know, as BTC's price goes up as well, you know, this BTC is worth more. It can be used for more within Ethereum, within Defi. So makes sense that I guess, like, it would slow down, too. So this is a fun one, and this is one that was way more relevant in, I guess, like 2017, 1819. But this is the ICO treasury balances chart, which tracks the amount of ETH in different ICO treasuries.
00:33:20.942 - 00:33:57.326, Speaker A: Now, I do think that icos were a major driver of the bull market in 2017 and, and also a major driver of the bear market in 2018, especially because these icos had millions and millions and millions of ETH in them and they were selling them into the market right, while the market was coming down. So you can see here that a lot of them don't have much ETH left, essentially. I think the gnosis kind of like one is wrong here. I think gnosis actually has a fair bit of ETH left. But you can see the biggest ones, like, obviously the ETH foundation, which is the core development for Ethereum. They're not going to be dumping their ETH, you know, anytime soon. Golem is a surprise here.
00:33:57.326 - 00:34:28.477, Speaker A: Gollum is one of the first icos. They raised all this ETH, like 300,000 ETH back when ETH was basically worth nothing. It was like during 2016 when it was, you know, $10, something like that. And then you have like these, these smaller ones. And I think at this point, you know, everyone, every one of these treasuries that wanted to just dump their ETH has done so already. So it's just funny to see, like, it went from millions and millions and millions, like tens of millions of ETH in these kind of treasuries to essentially, I guess, like, if you add all these up, it's probably about a million. And if you added gnosis to it, probably 1.5
00:34:28.477 - 00:34:44.053, Speaker A: million, I guess you could get to. So not much at all. And, you know, that definitely won't be the Ethereum foundation. And it seems Golem are not going to be just like market dumping all at once. Right. You know, I'm surprised Golem still has this much and, you know, the project's still going and everything like that. But that's a lot of money.
00:34:44.053 - 00:35:09.214, Speaker A: 300,000 ETH, that's. God, how much is that today? It's got to be $600 billion, I think. 600. 600 million, not billion dollars, still, like a crazy amount of cash that they're sitting on there. So, yeah, we'll. I don't think I'll be revisiting this chart. I just wanted to show it because I haven't shown it before, but I still think it's very interesting to kind of like, see how far we've come from, from the 2017 era, era of icos.
00:35:09.214 - 00:35:38.356, Speaker A: So another kind of, I guess, like, breakout metric over the last few months and especially during March and April is the total die supply. So you can see here it's exploded up. I mean, if we go to just like, I guess, what is it? March, 1, 2.3 billion to today, 3.9 billion. So it's about one point seven, one point six billion dollars of Dai being issued over the last two months. And Dai supplies at all time high, as you can see in the chart here.
00:35:38.356 - 00:36:16.348, Speaker A: And it was steady growth for a while, but then it just like, exploded up. And this is after Defi summer too. And it just shows that the guess, like, the hunger for stable coins is really there and die being like, a decentralized stable coin is even better. Like, USDC's had some incredible growth, of course, and obviously tether and stuff like that, but seeing Dai continue to compete and grow has just been, just been really, really great. And, you know, obviously, Makerdao is not just backed by ETH anymore because multicolateral, it's backed by USDC and routes, bitcoin, things like that. But I think, I think, you know, Dai can still be considered decentralized as a stable coin. And I think that, you know, for them to scale, they needed to add those assets.
00:36:16.348 - 00:36:44.318, Speaker A: So. Yeah, and then Dai is basically used across like the entire defi ecosystem. Like every defi app likes to support Dai. And you know, I think a lot, some of this has got to do with Alchemix as well. Alchemyx has, I think, 25% of the Dai supply in it or something crazy. And that's because they were, they have some yield farming programs going on, but they also have a really amazing product that, that lets you pay down your, automatically pays down your debt, and you can take loans against your debt and then yield farm with it. And it's just some crazy wizardry going on there.
00:36:44.318 - 00:37:09.130, Speaker A: So. Yeah, good to see the DAI supply at all time highs here. So another interesting kind of, I guess, like, bunch of charts here from the block is protocol revenue. So you can see here the different DeFi protocols and the revenue that they're generating for DeFi. It is definitely on an uptrend. Went down a little bit, I guess, you know, in April, but still back on the uptrend here. And that's revenue, I guess, like for not.
00:37:09.130 - 00:37:17.450, Speaker A: Maybe not. Not to toke, I guess, like not. Not the token holders specifically. Maybe it is the token holders. Actually. No, this is daily. So I don't think it is to token holders.
00:37:17.450 - 00:37:46.524, Speaker A: I think with this, it's just basically the total revenue that the protocol is generating, whether that be for liquidity providers or token holders. And you can see here just a breakdown of the monthly defi revenue that's obviously been going up as well. Cumulative defi revenue, this only goes up. Crossed a billion dollars recently, which is quite cool. And then defi revenue by recipient here. So as I was saying, protocol or supply side. So supply side basically means that is it revenue being paid to like liquidity providers on Unisoft, for example, rather than the protocol itself.
00:37:46.524 - 00:38:04.802, Speaker A: So protocol revenue is much less. Because a lot of these protocols don't have, you know, a lot of fee capture going on. Some of them don't have it at all. But still, that has, I think that's been on a general uptrend here. If I click into it. Yeah, that's been on a general uptrend as well, which is, which is cool to see. Annualized DeFi revenue by protocol.
00:38:04.802 - 00:38:32.382, Speaker A: Uniswap still leading. But again, none of that goes to the protocol, which means none of it goes to token holders compound. I don't know if this goes to token holders, but they have a bit of protocol revenue there. Sushi swap is pretty high, are there? And then maker. So all of makers revenue actually goes to to maker. And they have the most protocol revenue out of any of these kind of apps here. As you can see here, they currently making 100, $123 million, I guess like per year.
00:38:32.382 - 00:39:10.674, Speaker A: I think this is annual. Annualize your annualized per year much more than any of the others besides like sushi swap and compound, which is actually quite cool here. And then on the supply side, you know, the leader is obviously uniswap. But again, none of that is going to token holders right now. There's a bunch of others like TVL annualized revenue ratio and market cap annualized revenue ratio, which is used to see if things are overvalued or undervalued here. So sticking to the defi theme here, it's good to, I think, go over defi pulse and see like how much USD and how much ETH is kind of locked here. So we're at about 68 million USD locked according to DeFi pulse in DeFi maker is still leading at 10.72
00:39:10.674 - 00:39:28.760, Speaker A: billion, Ave is at 9.8 billion with compound at 9.2. If we go to ETH locked, it gets a bit more interesting. We actually broke a new all time high in April, which was about 11 million. We're back down to 10.7 million now. But I think with Defi pulse they just track Ethereum based DeFi.
00:39:28.760 - 00:39:55.474, Speaker A: There's also been upticks in L2s and also upticks in polygon, the POS network on Polygon, where I think Aave has $2 billion there. Curve has a bunch there as well. You know, some other DeFi apps on there too. So I think a lot of kind of like liquidity is going there and a lot of TvL is going there as well, which would make sense here. But still, it's not like Ethereum's kind of, um, DeFi is slowing down at all. Ethereum's layer one DeFi is slowing down here at all. It's still going quite strong.
00:39:55.474 - 00:40:36.066, Speaker A: And again, sticking with the defi theme here, we can go to the Dex metrics, which I'm just gonna give it a quick refresh to make sure I've got the most up to date data here. So this is my favorite decentralized exchange tracking dashboard on dune analytics volume over the last, I guess, 24 hours and seven days probably isn't very relevant here, but basically 2.1 billion over the last 24 hours and 15 billion over the last seven days. What I do like to look at is basically down here, the month of the monthly Dex volume grouped by. Yeah, now April was almost a record month, I think. I think it basically, I think it was just a record month beating out February by just a little bit here. March was in the middle, but yeah, I think it's fine.
00:40:36.066 - 00:41:05.650, Speaker A: This is like, this seems to have maybe capped out here on layer one, I guess, you know, it's been four months now where it's basically stayed around the same here. I'm curious to see how may goes. I mean, we're only two days in so far, so it's not going to, there's not much data here. But you can see the general trend is that, you know, 2019 is in blue, just like, you can't even see that on the chart, really. You have to squint to see it. 2020 is in gray. And, you know, you what, when you, when you start getting candles of, of 2021 that's making gray look, look like nothing as well.
00:41:05.650 - 00:41:44.478, Speaker A: And, you know, I think these two candles here, these two monthly volumes here dwarf the total volume that, that was done in 2020 on Dexus, which is quite cool. Now let's see who's dominating still. And of course, it's still Uniswap. Uniswap still has 55% dominance with sushi swap at 16%, zero x at 10%, which has been the breakout star actually lately. Zero X has been, you know, what was, was kind of like, I guess, not doing much volume for a very, very long time. But now they're doing a lot thanks to their Zero X API and match, our decentralized exchange aggregator. And then you can see here that there's a bunch of other ones like curve and Bancor and balancer and all the rest of here.
00:41:44.478 - 00:42:10.234, Speaker A: And then on the, the, on the right, you've got the aggregator share of decentralized exchange volume, which has remained steady. Again, it's about, I guess, like 14%, and DirectX volume is 86%, which is quite insane. Right. You would expect a lot of people to go through aggregators, but I think they don't. I think a lot of people just go to Uniswap, right. And just use Uniswap's contracts directly because that's what they know. And there's a lot of people, like a lot of newer people who won't use an aggregator, but we'll use Uniswap right off the bat here.
00:42:10.234 - 00:42:32.134, Speaker A: So cool to see that. But this chart on the left, the daily Dex volume, kind of is pretty illuminating as well. There's some times where like, you know, there's spikes and stuff like that, but Unisop is still, is still kind of leading here. So very interesting, interesting kind of metrics on the Dex front. All right, it's supplying smart contracts. I think I've already gone over this one. This might be a duplicate here.
00:42:32.134 - 00:42:53.420, Speaker A: We'll leave that. So, yes, basically the ETH two metrics. So essentially we crossed a 4 million ETH stack staked in April. We're at 4.18 million here, which represents over $10 billion currently securing the ETH two network. Stakers are getting 7.7% APR right now, and there's over 127,000 validators.
00:42:53.420 - 00:43:39.504, Speaker A: So you can see here that APR changes as more ETH stake. So if we went to like 10 million ETH stake, it would go to 4.9%. But this is just protocol or block reward. AP APR, there's estimates now that when the merger goes through, the ETH one to ETH two merger, this APR is going to spike to 2020, 5% plus because fee revenue, all the unburnt fee revenue is going to be going to stakers as well. So I think we can expect to see the total ETH stake just, you know, basically once the merge goes through, we can expect it to go to north of 10 million easily, I think, especially if the AP APR stays around, you know, 510 percent, like, comes down from 25% because more people stake, but it stays around 510 percent. And then as more people stake, more ETH gets locked up. And naturally the price should appreciate, too.
00:43:39.504 - 00:44:19.916, Speaker A: And, you know, I guess, like the, the, when the merge happens, isn't there's going to be about a 90% issuance reduction, like, you know, immediately as well. And stakers don't have a huge ongoing cost like miners, so they're not going to be dumping as much. So I can only say that, you know, obviously, the more ETH locked up in staking, the better it is for the price. Like, it's just, that's an obvious correlation for me. It may not play out day to day or week to week or even month to month, but it'll play out over the longer term for sure. So that's something that I'm keeping a very, very close eye on and checking it regularly, checking it for any spikes. I know Coinbase started rolling out their staking kind of service recently, but they're going to be, I guess, like doing more of that over the coming, coming weeks and coming months.
00:44:19.916 - 00:44:44.218, Speaker A: So it's going to be interesting to see what, you know, amount of ETH is staked in the next data pump. But on that, I think that's it for today's episode or for, for this episode that's, that went over the months of March and April. So thank you everyone for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed it. I do these, as I said, once a month, but you know, I kind of like it. I ran out of time to do it last month. I kept kind of delaying it and didn't get to it.
00:44:44.218 - 00:45:03.364, Speaker A: So that's why I've done two months this time. But usually these come out once a month so if you don't want to miss that, definitely subscribe to the channel. You also get access to the refuel videos too, which I do every weekday. Basically ethereum updates and all that sort of stuff. And yeah, give the video a thumbs up if you haven't yet and I'll catch you all next month for the next deli. Great data pump. Thanks everyone.
00:45:03.364 - 00:45:04.224, Speaker A: Bye.
