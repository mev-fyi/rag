00:00:00.640 - 00:00:52.436, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gui refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Susano, and today's the 23 February 2021. Alright everyone, what an absolutely crazy time in the markets over the last, I guess, 24 to 48 hours, right? We had, I mean, this happened just after I recorded actually yesterday's Daily grey refuel where we had this kind of first dump from, you know, about 1800 down to, what was it, 1500 or something like that, as you can see on the chart here. And then we kind of like bounced up from there, you know, went back into the 17 hundreds. Then today we've kind of just come down completely and ETH went to 1355 below the previous all time high and kind of has bounced back up. And at time of recording, ETH is at about 1470, 914 77. You know, it's changing.
00:00:52.436 - 00:01:27.028, Speaker A: Um, this is a pretty big dump. I think it is the biggest dump that we've seen for, for a little while now. I think the last big one was, was, was, was over here on the chart. You can see over here. What is this? When we were at 1350, when we rejected all time high, we went down to about 1900, which is a 33% drop, whereas up here we peaked at what, 20 kind of 38 drop down. It wasn't, it was a kind of a 34% drop. But I think this time the drop felt a lot more dramatic and a lot faster and there are a lot of kind of liquidations that went off and everything.
00:01:27.028 - 00:01:50.602, Speaker A: So, yeah, pretty brutal time. But you know, I wrote about this in the Deli Gray newsletter today, so I won't go over all of my thoughts here. You can read that for more of my detailed thoughts on kind of the state of the market. But I don't think this means the bull market's over, that's for sure. I know, I know I say this every time I talk about a kind of crash here, but I mean, this is kind of normal. This stuff happens. You know, if you look back at 2017, this was completely normal.
00:01:50.602 - 00:02:16.158, Speaker A: Actually, for ETH. It was even worse where ETH went from like ten dollars to four hundred twenty dollars and then dumped 70% to like $120 in a month. So $10 to 420 took six months, and then within a month it dumped 70% from there. And then obviously we know ETH went a lot higher after that. So, yeah, this isn't bearish for me at all, for sure. I just think, you know, function of the way these markets are. I mean, pretty, pretty brutal.
00:02:16.158 - 00:02:44.222, Speaker A: I mean, this isn't just like for ETH, right? The whole market kind of sold off and bitcoin as well, right? Came down from almost 60,000 to, I think, what is it, about like 47, 45? It actually got to or something like that. So, yeah. And I don't know if the pain's over yet. Right. You never know with these sorts of things. But for me, you know, you got, you all know that I'm a long term person. I kind of take a very long term outlook and all this stuff, and, you know, actually bought a little bit more east today, of course, didn't catch the bottom.
00:02:44.222 - 00:03:00.398, Speaker A: Bought it around, I guess it was like 1570 or something like that. You know, trying to catch the bottoms like a fool's errand. There's no way you can kind of do that. But, you know, sometimes you get lucky, but sometimes you don't. So. Yeah. And on that note, there was also very high gas prices today as well, I think.
00:03:00.398 - 00:03:40.240, Speaker A: Record high gas prices. You can see here on the screen. I've got it up to, like 1300 here for a rapid transaction or a fast transaction. I think it peaked at like 1500 or something like that, which is insane, right? I mean, you know, 1300 guys is a $40 ETH transaction. That's just like a simple kind of ETH transaction, right? Smart contracts, interactions would be in the thousands of dollars because of this. Now, I explained that last time, I guess, why gas prices kind of go so high during, you know, extreme volatility. The two main reasons is arbitrage bots that, that kind of like, arbitrage the entire kind of defi on chain ecosystem and, and look for, I guess, look for opportunities there.
00:03:40.240 - 00:04:08.418, Speaker A: And that includes, I guess, liquidation bots as well, who look for positions to liquidate. And then you have people who are willing to pay absolutely anything to kind of save their positions right there. People could be at risk of liquidation. They're going to pay whatever gas, gas kind of price they need to pay to make sure their transaction gets in because the market's falling so quickly. So, yeah, the gas prices went absolutely nuts there. And on that note as well, there was a ton of liquidations that have come in so over the last 24 hours. I think this is probably more.
00:04:08.418 - 00:04:52.702, Speaker A: By now. There's almost $6 billion worth of liquidations. I think this is the, this is the highest number ever, as kind of Larry points out here as well in his tweet, but not the highest relative to open interest. And then about 2.6 billion of this came from just bit binance itself, which, which is funny, I saw a tweet, actually, from kind of crypto cobain yesterday where he said, you know, binance traders are just farm animals with Internet connections, because you can look at the chart here and see that binance traders just got absolutely wrecked here off liquidations. And, you know, this is, this is kind of like what happens with, with markets is when people are too over leveraged. You know, these liquidations happen, and then, you know, as people get liquidated, it pushes the price down more.
00:04:52.702 - 00:05:21.842, Speaker A: And then you have what's called cascading liquidations, and these can get pretty deep. And that's why a major reason why we saw such a big dump is because we had a lot of these cascading liquidations happen. And then, you know, there's obviously not enough liquidity there to kind of pick it up. So the bottom kind of just absolutely falls out. And then you get to a point where eventually, you know, the selling pressure dies down and then buyers start stepping in. But, you know, you never really know when, when it's going to stop in that scenario. And there are certain technical indicators you can look for.
00:05:21.842 - 00:05:49.572, Speaker A: There are things called wicks on the chart. You know, I can show you here on the chart, like these things, wicks here, the wicks can go pretty deep. I mean, you can see here, this week was extremely deep before going back up, right? And, you know, that just means that there just wasn't any buy buyers there. There was very low liquidity there. But then the buyers step in because, you know that they see a bargain or whatever and they think it's time to buy. And that's kind of when the market reverses. But after a kind of dump like this, I think it takes a little while for us to head back up.
00:05:49.572 - 00:06:11.954, Speaker A: I mean, you can see from other kind of dumps with the same magnitude. If we look at even the, the daily chart here, right? You can see, you can see how bad this one is. You know, I think the comparable one was kind of January. It didn't take us too long to start going back up. This is the daily chart. Only took us a few days here, I guess, to get back to where we were, maybe about a week, but sometimes it can take longer than that. Right.
00:06:11.954 - 00:06:37.872, Speaker A: You know, it is a bull market, so who knows at this stage? But maybe it only takes us a week to get back to where we were, which is around 2000. You know, I'm still pretty bullish in general, so we'll see what happens there. But, yeah, I guess just hold on to what you've got and make sure you're not too over leveraged in these markets, and I think you'll be fine. So there's a bit of drama today with. With crypto punks and binance. Binance punks. Sorry.
00:06:37.872 - 00:06:59.584, Speaker A: So what ended up happening is that someone, I guess, cloned crypto punks, like, literally cloned them and put them on binance chain and just called them binance punks. And, you know, it was a direct copy. There was no changes made. It was just like being sold as something. And it. It was a clear money grab. I think they raised over $3 million or something like that, which is absolutely insane, right, for something that they just literally copy pasted over.
00:06:59.584 - 00:07:36.408, Speaker A: And, you know, it's just scammy as hell. And I don't want to kind of talk about that too much. What I do want to talk about is, you know, the copycats here, because you have nfts and then you have anyone that can copy them, right? You can copy the images, you can copy the code, you can copy whatever. And then people think, well, if it can just be copied, then how is the original still valuable? And I think this is a funny kind of line of thinking, because this was the same logic that was applied to forks of, like, bitcoin, for example. This used to be a very popular argument where people could say, well, you know, bitcoin has 21 million, you know, coins. That's its cap. But, you know, bitcoin can be forked infinite amount of time.
00:07:36.408 - 00:08:07.864, Speaker A: So what gives bitcoin its actual value, right? What makes bitcoin continue going up in price? What makes it unique? And we all know a lot of the reasons why it's unique, right? You know, a lot of it's got to do with the community and the social contract around it. You know, the community saying, well, no, you know, bitcoin is bitcoin. You know, these other forks aren't bitcoin. And that's why bitcoin is valuable. You know, bitcoin has all these other special properties to it, right? You know, it's decentralization, things like that. And, you know, has all the mind share, essentially, and stuff. The same kind of thing plays into, I think, you know, nfts.
00:08:07.864 - 00:08:37.976, Speaker A: And specifically, I guess, crypto punks, right? You know, binance punks. Just because it's a clone doesn't mean it's the same as crypto punks. Crypto punks, as I've discussed before, are the first NFT, right, on Ethereum, where there's a lot of culture around that. There's a lot of social consensus around those being the crypto punks, right? Those are the ogs. You know, you owning a copycat is essentially owning like, a bootleg or a rip off. Like, no one. No one cares about that, right? Like, people want the original, right? No one values the bootlegs or the ripoffs normally, unless it's a very good ripoff.
00:08:37.976 - 00:09:06.718, Speaker A: But obviously with. With kind of blockchain technology, we can tell if it's the original or not, because you can see on chain. Um, but, yeah, and I actually think that the forks, I guess you could call them of these nfts, work to reinforce the value of the original. Um, I don't know. We haven't seen this play out yet, and this is just a hypothesis that I have, but I think it really does work to reinforce the value of the original, because I saw everyone kind of calling out binance, binance punk, saying, you know, this is crap. This is just bullshit. This is a copy.
00:09:06.718 - 00:09:40.924, Speaker A: It doesn't make any sense. You know, why would this be valuable to money grab? And then, you know, not only does that bring more awareness to crypto punks itself, for those who hadn't heard of it yet, right, it also kind of acts as a. As a social signaling mechanism to say, you know, any copycats are just crap. Like, just, you know, this isn't, this isn't something that we want to own. This isn't something that we're going to value. And then the rest of the kind of ecosystem follows that. They're like, well, you know, if all these people are saying this is crap, then, you know, and there's no community backing behind, and it just looks like a scam, then, you know, why it's not going to be worth anything, right? And this is what happened a lot with a lot of the bitcoin forks.
00:09:40.924 - 00:10:34.670, Speaker A: Not that there were scams or anything, but a lot of them didn't change anything, right? A lot of, you know, I guess, like the two clear examples here of bitcoin forks that tried to be bitcoin is bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv, right? Now, bitcoin cash is a bit of a special case where they actually, the community that actually forked off did kind of like, want something different to what bitcoin was giving them, and that was bigger blocks. You know, they were probably misguided in what they wanted to do. And obviously, bitcoin cash is worth a lot less than it was relative to bitcoin. Bitcoin sv is a scam, right, run by a serial scammer who claims to be Satoshi. I'm just going to, you know, straight up say that so that there's that aspect to it as well. And that's kind of where I guess the social contract comes into it and people being like, you know, bitcoin is and other people outside of the bitcoin ecosystem, you know, recognizing bitcoin as the thing and this, this, you know, as the real kind of bitcoin, so to speak, right. And not these other forks and stuff.
00:10:34.670 - 00:11:13.824, Speaker A: And the forks actually reinforce the fact that, you know, it's not just easy enough to fork bitcoin and like call it bitcoin and then everyone will accept it as bitcoin. So I think, you know, we'll probably see a similar thing play out in the NFT space. And this is just the first example of it, I think. So diversify. So for those who don't know, diversify is another, I guess, decentralized exchange that is using ZK roll ups to scale their, their exchange and they're partnered with starkware to do this. So you've heard me speak about loopring a lot and about their ZK roll up exchange, but diversify is just as good as loopring. And I think that they deserve more attention here.
00:11:13.824 - 00:12:04.340, Speaker A: But basically what they introduced today in their, I guess, solution was that you can send tokens to other diversify users now kind of gas free, right? Because the L2, and you can do this privately, it will not be visible on, publicly on the Ethereum blockchain. And this is something that a lot of people miss about L2, is that when the L2s are built right, it's always private by default to it means it doesn't publish. Kind of like your data on the Ethereum blockchain. I do think the l two operators can maybe see what you're doing, or at least kind of like see some of what you're doing, but it doesn't get published to the main Ethereum blockchain. So you have like privacy within that ecosystem by default, which I think is like a really undersold aspect of L2. Not only do we get scalability, but we get privacy because we don't really want privacy on Ethereum's base layer. Right.
00:12:04.340 - 00:12:28.312, Speaker A: Built into the protocol. And the major reason for this is because of inflation, bugs. Now for those who don't know, Zcash has a, has a privacy built into it, but it's not by default. It's an opt in privacy. But that still prevents issue. Sorry. Presents issues as well because you don't know if an inflation bug has happened because of the fact that you can't verify the supply.
00:12:28.312 - 00:13:03.138, Speaker A: So if there's like an inflation bug where the supply is increased, you won't actually be able to tell because of the fact that it's all private and that kind of like, is very dangerous. Right. And this is the main reason why we don't want privacy on, on, on. Layer one is because we want to be able to verify everything and verify everything's fine. If there is a bug, we want to be able to see it and revert it because there actually was an inflation bug on zcash. And I don't think they've been able to work out if it was exploited or not at this stage. So sometime in the future, you know, it could be revealed that it was exploited and there were funds in shielded addresses, they call them the private addresses that.
00:13:03.138 - 00:13:25.316, Speaker A: That were using this inflation bug to create more Z cash and that could flood the market. Right. I haven't kept up with that since that was announced. Maybe they did figure it out, but normally that's the main risk there. So that's why we want to push all the privacy stuff to L2. Or you can do like privacy wrappers on layer one. Aztec protocol actually did this where they wrapped Dai and other tokens in like ZK dice or zero knowledge Dai.
00:13:25.316 - 00:13:50.004, Speaker A: And then you could, you couldn't see the amounts being transferred on chain. You could only see like the to and from address. So that was a really cool way to kind of obfuscate the. The transfers happening there. But generally, privacy is going to be done at L2 and layer one. It might be done in a way with like, kind of like ZK technology as well, cryptography on layer one, but that's expensive. So I think most of the time it's going to be happening on L2, which is really cool.
00:13:50.004 - 00:14:16.976, Speaker A: So, yeah, kudos to diversify for this. If you haven't used their exchange yet, I highly recommend going and checking it out. You know, you've probably used loop ring because I've spoken about it so much, but it diversify is just another option for you on L2. And there's more coming. I mean, I know I talk about it all the time, but there is more coming to L2 very, very soon. Actually, I spoke about how yesterday I spoke about optimism and how they're due for an update very soon in the next couple weeks, according to their last blog post. So I'm keeping an eye out for that.
00:14:16.976 - 00:14:46.546, Speaker A: And there's also actually, I think I've got it up here. I'll actually talk about this now. There's a podcast that you should definitely listen to from bankless, where they got Matt Feinstein, Robbie Ferguson, and Justin Moses from Loop ring, immutable and synthetix, respectively, to talk about L2 and why they chose L2 on Ethereum, what they're building, what the differences are between them. It's a two hour long podcast. I've only listened to about 45 minutes so far, but it made me so bullish. I was like, I was on a walk and I was just listening to it. I'm like, oh, my God, like.
00:14:46.546 - 00:15:24.252, Speaker A: And, you know, it was funny at the time, the ETH price was crashing and I just completely forgot about the prices because I was like, this stuff's awesome, right? These guys are really, like, trying to scale Ethereum and, you know, loop rings live today. Synthetix is on testnet, immutable is building their decentralized NFT exchange, which is going to be live soon. So, yeah, I mean, I highly recommend going and listening to this podcast because it'll just get you really amped about L2 on Ethereum. And it's, it's, it, you know, it's coming and it's here and kind of like the rest of the kind of ecosystem is going to get on L2 over the next few months. And it's going to be good. It's going to be really awesome. And, you know, as I guess Ryan says here, rip ETH killers.
00:15:24.252 - 00:16:01.386, Speaker A: I really do think that if L2 works as we want it to work, which I believe it will, I don't really get the value prop of these other kind of chains. Like, most of them. Most of them at least, right. Their main selling point is that they're more scalable, they can do more transactions per second. They have cheaper fees. Well, when we have that on a theorem with L2, then what's the, what's the point of these other things, right? If your main selling point is that you have cheaper fees and lower, you know, you know, more tps, that's not going to mean anything. And you know what's hilarious? I was actually looking at some stats today because of, like, all the binance chain drama, and I was looking at Ethereum usage stats to see if they had gone down at all.
00:16:01.386 - 00:16:29.588, Speaker A: They had it right. They're still trending up. Like, the BSC has not put a dent in Ethereum at all. And this goes back to, I guess, my thesis about a theory and becoming this economic nexus where everything just feeds into it, regardless of, you know, if people go off chain to do it, it comes home to roost, right. People are sending their assets back into Ethereum once they're done in the Binance casino. Right? So in the BSc casino. So, you know, this just feeds into that thesis, and so do L2s as well, and everything else kind of around Ethereum, too.
00:16:29.588 - 00:17:02.314, Speaker A: So definitely go listen to this podcast because, you know, I know I've sold it here, but it's very, very bullish, and I can't wait to listen to the rest of it tomorrow. So token terminal put out this interesting statistic on Twitter. I think this was actually from a couple of days ago now, but they basically said the total value locked in Defi was $40 billion or $42 billion, I think it's three days ago. And the total revenue being paid in DeFi was $800 million. And Uniswap's dominance is almost 50% of the fees being paid, which is awesome. I mean, you can see it in the. In the kind of charts here.
00:17:02.314 - 00:17:35.406, Speaker A: My head's probably blocking half of the picture here, but I'll kind of walk through it. You can see, you know, since Defi summer, the revenue of these protocols has gone up. And I think it's important to. To kind of like split out protocol revenue from LP revenue. So, for example, on Uniswap right now, all of the fees and all the revenue generated is going to liquidity providers, right? There's 0.3% fee charged on every single trade on Uniswap, and that's going to the providers of liquidity, whereas, you know, there are plans to switch on kind of like fee capture, where 0.05% of that 0.3%
00:17:35.406 - 00:17:49.290, Speaker A: would go to uni token holders. Right. Or like uni token stakers or whatever. But that's not happening right now. But. But that is happening for some protocols. Like Sushiswap, for example, has that right, where they have feed capture, you know, yearn used to have that.
00:17:49.290 - 00:18:02.858, Speaker A: Doesn't have that right now. I don't think comp. Well, at least it doesn't have it for token holders. I don't think compound does, I think. I'm pretty sure Aave does. And then these other ones, I'm not entirely sure. I think most of them don't yet, and they will turn them on.
00:18:02.858 - 00:18:18.454, Speaker A: And. And there's one that here that actually, I don't think is listed is maker. Right. Maker is generating a lot of fees it's like $50 million annualized or something right now, which is huge. And that's going to buying and burning MKR tokens. So which is really cool as well. So yeah, there's a.
00:18:18.454 - 00:19:20.832, Speaker A: To keep an eye on, something I keep an eye on when I look at things that I want to kind of put my money into. Like if a protocol is generating, I guess, you know, cash flows, especially to token holders, that kind of puts a flaw on the token price, right, where you can kind of look at it and be like, why are people signing this thing? This thing gives them a ticket to generating kind of like revenue and to kind of like getting a dividend, essentially. So why are people selling this? And I think we've seen that play out with something like curve, you know, the CRV token, where curve is actually making like a lot of money for its LP's and for its CRV token holders. And people are like, well, why is, you know, why isn't CRV like a steal here? And I was like 60 or seventy cents and it's gone to like $3 now, so. And you know, even though CRV is still being paid out as part of a liquidity mining program, which puts kind of sell pressure on the token, there's still that demand there from people who want to get, you know, the fee capture essentially, while kind of like putting their assets in there as well. So that was really cool to see here. So illuvium has announced that they're teaming up with immutable X.
00:19:20.832 - 00:19:43.554, Speaker A: I think they announced this the other day, but they've detailed it more here. And as I just explained, immutable X is going to be an ethereum L two for nfts. And alluvium is of course a new NFT, kind of like video game or gaming kind of thing on Ethereum. And that's coming out soon. I think it's coming out Q 320 21. Actually, it's launching on immutable X in Q 320 21. So that's going to be huge.
00:19:43.554 - 00:20:15.974, Speaker A: Seems like Q three is probably going to change the game for nfts and gaming because we do need a L2 solution for this. Right? Because I think nfts are one of those things that got completely priced out from layer one, unfortunately. And I think immutable X is going to play a big part here in getting NFTs back into kind of like the game, you know, no pun intended. So we're really looking forward to this. If you haven't yet, you should check out alluvium you know, they've been teasing a lot of stuff that they've got going on. They've got airdrops going on in their discord for their token as well. So you definitely go check them out if you haven't yet.
00:20:15.974 - 00:21:02.708, Speaker A: So Justin from NFTX tweeted out this kind of teaser today that cross asset swaps are coming to the platform, which means you can kind of like cross asset swap between different nfTs. So he's got an example here that you can go from, you know, one punk to another punk to one hash mask to another hash mask, which I think is really cool. So basically being able to, you know, get from like one NFT to a completely different one routing through different kind of like other nfTs. And this is kind of what happens with uniswap, right, where, or at least other amms in general, where you can kind of like buy something with ETH and then it'll kind of like route through Dai or another stable coin to get to the token that you want if it needs to. Right. And this is exactly what can happen with, with, with NFTX. And not yet.
00:21:02.708 - 00:21:32.578, Speaker A: They're, they're kind of teasing it. But I think, you know, this is just awesome, right? NFTX is one of my favorite projects right now. I am a holder of the token, of course, as I've mentioned before, but it's just awesome. They're bringing liquidity to nfTs, which is, which is sorely needed. I think they're going to actually, like, I just assume, I haven't seen any announcements around this yet, but I assume that they're going to basically team up with Mutable X as well because it just like, seems like a very obvious kind of thing to me. But, yeah, I mean, this is exciting. NFts are really hot right now.
00:21:32.578 - 00:22:03.386, Speaker A: Anything in that arena I'm just having so much fun with, because Defi is fun, right? Defi is awesome. But it's very like, I guess, speculative focused. Whereas nfTs, yes, there's this element of speculation there, but you don't necessarily have to kind of play in that arena. You can just buy things that you want, right. And buy things that you like. You can pay attention to things, you can look at things, you can get involved in the designer communities by art, whatever, you know, talk to people about the different art and how it kind of like speaks to you and stuff like that, right, in the different video games. So there is another side to it rather than speculation, which I think is really cool, to be fair.
00:22:03.386 - 00:22:41.446, Speaker A: There is with Defi as well, because there's a lot of developments going on. But I think with nfTs, it attracts a different kind of crowd and a different kind of person than what DeFi does. And it's just kind of refreshing as well to see that. So the index co op released a new index today called the Coin shares gold and crypto asset index with ticker CGI. Now, what this index is, it basically it consists of ETH, BTC, and gold. So basically it'll track that as part of this index. And, you know, I think it's a pretty good way to get exposure to, I guess, like these three kind of the two crypto blue chips plus gold, right.
00:22:41.446 - 00:23:08.048, Speaker A: Because, you know, people still want gold, right? People still like gold. People still want to buy it and still want to hold it. And this gives you basically tokenized exposure to it through coin shares. And I should kind of like, I guess, like disclaimer here that, you know, index co op, I'm pretty close to. I hold index tokens, you know, it's part of, like, my advisor role at set. But in general, like, I just thought this was really cool. This is the second index that the index co op has launched, the first being the DeFi pulse index, of course.
00:23:08.048 - 00:23:44.384, Speaker A: And this is, like, completely different to the DeFi pulse index because the DeFi pulse index obviously has DeFi tokens in. It doesn't have BTC, ethan and gold, or whatever. So I thought this was really cool. So if this is something you're interested in, definitely go check it out if you want kind of this exposure. I feel like this portfolio in particular is definitely going to be really great over long periods of time. I feel like the presence of gold will dampen the volatility here, and the presence of BTC and ETH will kind of, like, give you those nice returns because gold obviously doesn't go up too much compared to BTC and ETH, but it does help to dampen the volatility here. So, yeah, definitely go check this one out.
00:23:44.384 - 00:24:34.012, Speaker A: So an announcement from immutable here that they've onboarded another kind of project called Epics GG here, which is they basically make, I guess, trading cards for PUBG and CSGO, which are two of the most popular video games in the world. They're going to be scaling with Immutable X, which is really, really awesome. I just. I mean, I really love immutable and immutable X. And what they're trying to build here, they, after listening to that podcast, or at least part of that podcast from bankless with Robbie from, from immutable. They're talking about it. They care deeply about scaling Ethereum, right? And making sure that they do it in a right way, in a way that retains kind of decentralization and security properties at L2, and not just building some kind of like centralized thing where people can go and do whatever, not taking a shortcut, essentially.
00:24:34.012 - 00:24:59.016, Speaker A: So their deep commitment to Ethereum is what makes me the most bullish on, on them and their team. And you might know them from gods unchained fame. They've been building that video game for quite a while, but I think they hit a roadblock there because of the scaling kind of issue. So that's why they needed to build immutable X as well. But the fact that they didn't just pack up and go somewhere else, love that. I love when that happens. I love when teams actually stick to Ethereum and stick by the mission and believe in the mission.
00:24:59.016 - 00:25:33.288, Speaker A: So yeah, really, really bullish on them. Go check them out if you haven't yet. I'm very much looking forward to seeing immutable X go live in Q three. So Alex here announced a new tool called MeV Transactions Explorer. So I've spoken about Mev on the refill before. For those who don't know what it stands for, it stands for minor extractable value. This basically means value that is extracted by either miners or by, you know, astute, kind of like blockchain, I guess, like observers or like people who build bots.
00:25:33.288 - 00:26:19.452, Speaker A: And what they do is they basically, a lot of it is front running where they'll front run your transaction. So for those who don't know what a front run transaction is, say you're making a uniswap trade, right? And, you know, you've made a uniswap trade, you've paid your fear. You're waiting 15 seconds until you know, or whatever, waiting one ethereum block until it confirms, and then someone comes along and runs in front of you and submits the order and pays a higher fee than you and kind of gets that order before you do for purposes to make a profit. So that essentially the front run you, right, this is, this plays into Mev. It plays a big part into Mev. And as you can see here, Mev is not necessarily, I mean, it's not, it's not really good. It's kind of parasitic, right? Because it's kind of stealing value from the ecosystem, or at least taking value for where it should be preserved.
00:26:19.452 - 00:26:50.404, Speaker A: And you can see here that since January 1, 2020, which was, I guess, about a year ago now, there's been $320 million worth of MeV that this tool has detected or their team at flashbots have detected here, which is quite a lot, and it's accelerating. You can see here it's going up a lot because the on chain defi activity is going up a lot. So it only makes sense that it would track that. And the daily extracted MeV is going up. You know, actors are getting more sophisticated. You can see here the MeV split by protocol, you uniswap's number one, sushi swaps number two. Right.
00:26:50.404 - 00:27:33.012, Speaker A: And then by type, there's arbitrage, and then, you know, liquidation and front running. Arbitrage kind of counts as front running here, where, you know, the reason they're front run you is to arbitrage that kind of transaction and the MEV by role. So, you know, MeV can be done by, as I said, miners, but it can, it's done mostly by non miners at this stage. But the reason why miners would do it and why they have an advantage is because they control the transaction ordering in Ethereum blocks. So I've spoke about this before, but basically, miners can control whatever order they want transactions to go into a block, and they can also put transactions into a block that costs zero fee. So they can just put their own transactions in, you know, put it first. Right.
00:27:33.012 - 00:28:01.160, Speaker A: Put it at zero fees and front run the world. And I expect them to do this more and more into the future, you know? You know, it's only 12% now. I expect this to grow. I'm surprised it hasn't. I'm surprised they're not doing more of it because they have all the advantage to do it here and extract even more value out of the Ethereum ecosystem. Or, I mean, they're already making a killing from, I guess, like, mining the mining block reward and the fees in general. So maybe, I don't know, maybe they like the fees more than they like moving the world, but we'll have to see what happens there.
00:28:01.160 - 00:28:22.096, Speaker A: But this is a really cool dashboard. I'm glad that we have it gives us something to keep an eye on. And there are people working on ways to mitigate MeV. But it's a very hard problem. It is something that I think some of the top minds in the space are working on because it's a very fun problem to work on because it's so hard to crack. There's some stuff going on about, like Mev at L2, how to kind of solve that. How to fix it, we'll have to see.
00:28:22.096 - 00:28:48.244, Speaker A: Right. I have faith in the builders here, I have faith in the researchers and I'm excited to see how it plays out. So speaking of miners, Tim Bico put out an update on one ERP 1559 today. So he does these updates from time to time. This is update number seven. The TRDR is basically, I guess most of that focused on miners. I mean there were some stuff about client updates and kind of like when we can expect the IP 1559.
00:28:48.244 - 00:29:26.472, Speaker A: And I've spoken about this before that I think we're going to get it in July or August as part of the London Ethereum network upgrade. But basically he go, he went, what I wanted to talk about was this part, the mining update. So obviously we know that miners, some miners, not all miners, aren't a big fan of 1559 because it represents a pay cut for them. And minus have proposed kind of several alternatives to 1559 which would, which here he's listed out here, the first proposal being change 1559 itself to remove the fee burn. That's never going to happen. Like, I can already say that that's, that's absolutely never going to happen. No one in the community wants that to happen except miners.
00:29:26.472 - 00:29:57.724, Speaker A: Right? Increasing the block reward to make up for the lost fees. That's also not going to happen. That miners are making enough money, the network is secure enough, we don't need to increase in block reward to make up for some loss of revenue here. And changing the proof of work algorithm to make it ASiC resistant. Again, that's not going to happen because we already had this debate with prog power last year. So I just, these are just weird to me. These kind of, I wouldn't call them demands, but these, like, even just these, these requests, it just doesn't make much sense to me at all for this to kind of like come up.
00:29:57.724 - 00:30:16.822, Speaker A: Like these things are basically not going to happen. I mean, I don't even know if miners think they're going to happen because this is just too obvious to me that, you know, the community really wants the fee burned. That's like a major part of 1559 that people want. Right? Increasing the block award. I mean no one wants to do that. No one wants to give more miners more money at this stage. Right.
00:30:16.822 - 00:30:51.548, Speaker A: And no one wants to increase the overall network inflation and no one wants prog power as we saw last time, or at least no one, most people don't. Right. And you know, the funny thing about, I guess kind of like the kind of like, increasing in block reward here to make up for the lost fees. I mean, the price is still, like, really high and they're still making a lot of money off this. So I just, I just don't get it. And overall, the funny, the even funnier thing is that, you know, I've gone through before on the refuel how miners are making threats now, right? They're threatening to kind of do a chain split or attack the chain if they don't get their way. And it's just so, like, weird.
00:30:51.548 - 00:31:12.208, Speaker A: Like, is this the way to negotiate? Right? Do you threaten people with all this, like, stuff that's basically empty threats to get your way? It's like a child essentially kind of like doing these empty threats or, you know, someone just kind of like holding a gun to your head and threatening to kind of pull the trigger. But there's no ammo in the. In the kind of gun. Right. There's no bullets in the gun. It's just, it's so weird to me. Right.
00:31:12.208 - 00:31:49.016, Speaker A: And I've said on the refill before, I don't hate minors, but, and not all miners are like this, but there's a certain kind of, like, you know, section of them that are just, like, going kamikaze on this and basically kind of just going like, the complete wrong path here. And I'm a firm believer in that the miners really are just service providers and we shouldn't be negotiating with them at all. I actually don't really like that they've been invited to this community call. You know, they can have their say, but at the same time, I don't think we should be compromising for them. I don't think that we should be, you know, if these are the things that they want, then, you know, in reality, none of this is going to happen. So, you know, let them speak on the call. I mean, everyone should have a voice.
00:31:49.016 - 00:32:14.678, Speaker A: Sure, whatever. But at the same time, I think there's enough kind of proof out there that those three things aren't going to happen. Right. And 1559 is going to go in. And the game theory around kind of minors, including 1559, is pretty sound. And there was actually a piece from, from Hasu and Georgios that was published yesterday that goes over why they believe 1559 is going to actually go in. It's actually here.
00:32:14.678 - 00:32:45.242, Speaker A: It's in this post. So I'll link this post in the YouTube description. You'll be able to check it out. But basically, yeah, they go through, like, why they, they kind of think it's going to go in one of them, one of the reasons is because of the difficulty bomb, right. And that needs to be diffused and 1559 is going to be coupled with that, then they kind of COVID the case where the miners are going to launch their own fork, which, you know, would require them to obviously convince everyone else to follow on their fork, which isn't going to happen. You know, the top dapps in Ethereum have already signaled their support for 1559. You know, the exchanges are going to follow it, I think, as well.
00:32:45.242 - 00:33:19.722, Speaker A: That's just a non starter altogether. And they also explore the idea of miners launching a fresh state fork, which would basically encounter issues regarding supply distribution as well. And then finally they explore the scenario where miners stay on the 1559 chain but decide to block its usage by not allowing blocks that raise the base fee, which Hasu and Jorgeos kind of argue here that this is just like not in their best interest to do. They're just kind of shooting themselves in the foot. So you can read the analysis in full here. But I mean, that kind of like echoes a lot of my sentiment around this, too. And, yeah, I mean, this is a really great update.
00:33:19.722 - 00:34:04.082, Speaker A: So I won't kind of go, won't linger too much here, but definitely go check it out if you haven't yet. Last thing here is Alpha Finance and Cream Finance did a joint announcement about how they're going to be paying back that debt. I remember I spoke about this on the refuel last week about how there was like $30 million or $34 million worth of debt that Alpha Finance owed the iron banking cream. So what's going to end up happening is that Alpha is going to pay it back out of protocol fees. They're not going to sell any alpha finance tokens to the market to pay it back or anything like that, which is, I think, the better path here. But they are actually going to put up 50 million alpha tokens, which is worth about $50 million right now as a bond with cream. So to guarantee that they're going to pay back the value, I thought that was a really good outcome for both of the teams here.
00:34:04.082 - 00:34:25.770, Speaker A: I'm really kind of, like impressed or at least proud that they went down this direction. So, yeah, kudos to them for doing this, but I won't linger too much on this one. You can read the thread in the YouTube description, of course. I think I've gone overtime for today. So, yeah, that's it. Thank you, everyone, for listening and watching. Again, if you haven't done so, give that video a thumbs up subscribe to the YouTube channel, join the Discord server, subscribe to the newsletter, and I'll catch you all tomorrow.
00:34:25.770 - 00:34:26.194, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
