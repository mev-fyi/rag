00:00:00.400 - 00:00:26.622, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the delibuate refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cesano, and today's the 21 September 2021. All right, everyone, let's get into it. So, final days of the latest bitcoin grants matching round eleven here. You can see that the stats are absolutely amazing. 168,000 plus contributions from over 8000 people. Up to $718,000 has been donated so far, which is.
00:00:26.622 - 00:00:48.638, Speaker A: Which is amazing, honestly. I mean, that's a lot of money. And that's on top of, obviously, the matching pool, which is $950,000. So there's been 1100 grants contributed towards, which is a 10% increase from 15th of the 9th with just about a week ago now. So, yeah, this is cool to see. I mean, if you haven't donated on Gitcoin grants, be sure to do so. There's obviously a lot of great projects on there.
00:00:48.638 - 00:01:06.924, Speaker A: This will probably be your final reminder if I don't, you know, if not, maybe I'll remember on the last day to remind you guys to do it. But don't dawdle, it's almost over. September 23 is when it ends. I think it's two days from. From now. It'll end. So, yeah, just get on there and the link will be in the YouTube description, of course, and go donate to your favorite projects.
00:01:06.924 - 00:01:58.316, Speaker A: All right, so a bit of news from Coindesk last night where they kind of like announced that Coinbase has dropped plans to launch their lending product after the SEC warned it would violate federal securities laws. So this was something that I spoke about a couple weeks ago, maybe on the refuel, about how the SEC was basically being bullies towards Coinbase. And that's why I kind of, quote, tweeted here and said, the SEC are bullies. This is pretty bad. I mean, they've basically forced Coinbase not to launch their lending product, which was essentially the goal. I remember I said on the refill that I don't think the SEC is acting in the interest of the people, they're acting in the interest of the banks. And, you know, it was funny, I don't know if I mentioned this on the refuel before, but Kathy Wood kind of like said on a podcast, on the Bankless podcast that she thinks that the yield available within kind of crypto is eating into the bank's profit margins, at least at the margin.
00:01:58.316 - 00:02:23.028, Speaker A: And they're kind of like now aware of it and it's kind of like a threat to them. So they're using whatever power they have at their disposal to stop this thing from proliferating, which, as we all know, is not going to be stopped. It's just going to continue. You can't really stop crypto, you can't stop truly decentralized finance. But unfortunately they can stop decentralized, kind of, I guess, like institutions like Coinbase, for example, where it's very easy for to do so. They can, you know, Coinbase is us based. They can base.
00:02:23.028 - 00:03:13.944, Speaker A: The SEC can basically just go, yeah, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna pursue you criminally or sue you if you do this. And the Coinbase probably weighed up the options be like, okay, well, how much money would we make from this product? Is it worth getting sued over? Is it worth kind of battling in court over? And it obviously isn't, especially because it's not just the money aspect of it. It's also if they kind of like, lose, then they'll have to remove the kind of like service anyway, and then they'll have like a mark against their name and the regulators will probably go after them even harder. So feel very sorry for Coinbase here. I know that I always say that, like, when we're trying to disrupt decentralized institutions because we can't trust them, you know, they're shitty. They obviously take advantage of their customers, some of them. But I think the real reason why I want to disrupt all decentralization, and I think this is like, the wider sentiment within the community, is because it means that these regulators can't shut us down.
00:03:13.944 - 00:03:46.342, Speaker A: They can't take down something that is decentralized. And that's why I've always been like super, super bullish on things like uniswap, which are fully decentralized from the start. The smart contracts cannot be tampered with unless you were to overtake the entire ethereum network, and we should be promoting more of that within the ecosystem. But it just sucks that it's just so easy to go after these kind of like centralized entities. And I mean, that is, that is the trade off you make. Centralized entities can, can do things that decentralized ones can't at this point in time because they can, they can scale easier and stuff like that. But long term, they are not.
00:03:46.342 - 00:04:26.240, Speaker A: They are not the kind of like the solution here for this industry. We need to get, get rid of them as fast as possible. We need to get off them as fast as possible. They're still going to exist in the kind of like fiat on and off ramp capacity um, they're still going to exist as like the front door to kind of crypto from for a lot of people. But generally we need to be able to replicate their functions as much as possible within the kind of like defi space especially. And we also need to stop relying on the byproducts that they create as well, such as the USDC stablecoin tether, uh, all the other centralized stable coins as well. We do need to kind of like, uh, I guess like, uh, kill our reliance there because as I've said before, the regulators are going to go after two things.
00:04:26.240 - 00:05:12.496, Speaker A: They're going to go after the exchanges and they're going to go after the stable coins. Those are the two major things that they can easily shut down if they want to, or force into a kind of like a corner where they have to comply. And, you know, if they were able to kind of, I guess, heavily regulate these stable coins like USDC, it would be bad news for DeFi. I think depending on what they do, USDC could possibly lose its peg or it could become so regulated that doesn't make sense to use within DeFi because you have to KYC and all that sorts of stuff. So, you know, there's plenty of stable coin projects right now that are trying to, I guess, do a decent, truly decentralized stable coin, but it's going to take us a while to get there. I think it's quite hard. I've written about this before in the newsletter where I said, like the holy grail of decentralized stable, of a stable coin in general is being decentralized, scalable and stable.
00:05:12.496 - 00:06:12.238, Speaker A: We don't have that right now. I think to an extent, the closest we came was under single collateral die when we just had ETH backing it up and we had like, there was a governance process, but it was, it was, it was quite decentralized. And you know, the problem was, is that Dai wasn't very stable under that. I mean, it would depend and deep pegged pretty bad at times as well. And it wasn't, it's not a very scalable system and it probably still isn't even with the kind of like multicolateral system, even though it's been growing. I'm talking scalable as in like trillions of dollars of these things with kind of like collateral backing it. Now there's other projects like Rye, for example, that are tackling this, and there's even other ones that are, that are, I guess like tackling it from a different perspective, like the Olympus Dao that I've been kind of, like, looking into a little bit recently, so, and I think something called spell or mim or something like that, there's, there's definitely some, some stuff going on there that I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of, like, looking into now, I had heard about it before, but the thing is with a lot of these stablecoin projects is that a lot of them look like Ponzis, and a lot of them actually are Ponzis.
00:06:12.238 - 00:06:45.002, Speaker A: So I tend to ignore them until they get big enough and until I see more legit people get involved with them to actually start diving deep into it. I don't care if I miss out on gains or whatever from not investing early. That's, that's not really the kind of the point of why I wouldn't want to look into it, but I would really love to see one of these things succeed in, in a really big way. So, um, but, yeah, the SEC just doing what they do best, being bullies. They seem to be taking a scorched earth approach to crypto regulation right now, where they're basically just going after anyone they can and scaring everyone else into submission. I mean, really protecting investors, guys, you know, it's just ridiculous. It's crap.
00:06:45.002 - 00:07:23.740, Speaker A: They're going to push a lot of people overseas. I'm already hearing from a lot of friends that people they know are literally moving out of the US and going kind of like living and working somewhere else because they're sick of being kind of, like, forced into a corner and forced to comply with draconian regulations and forced to feel like they're constantly being, I guess, like watched by the SEC and at any moment could be kind of subpoenaed or sued or whatever. So, yeah, it's definitely not a great time, I guess, like, to be a Defi builder in the US right now. But I don't think this is obviously a death knell or anything like that for DeFi or for crypto. I just think that there's going to be a lot of. A lot of movement in the world, that's for sure. It's going to be a lot of movement, a lot of economic movement.
00:07:23.740 - 00:08:00.532, Speaker A: And if the, as I've said before, if the US continues down this path, they're going to be left behind in the crypto revolution. So it's up to them what they want to do. I don't know what's going to happen politically. Like, obviously the SEC has some level of autonomy, but they do ultimately answer to, I guess, to Congress right in the US. So they, they can't just do whatever they want, but it feels like they're trying to do that right now. It feels like, you know, it feels like they're trying to do as much as they can before they get told off, because to a certain extent, they, they, you know, they can keep doing this, but then someone's gonna complain to Congress. Someone's gonna be like, you know, what's, what's, what's going, like, one of the bigger players are gonna be like, what's happening here? This is ridiculous.
00:08:00.532 - 00:08:26.016, Speaker A: And then Congress is gonna chime in, and then the SEC are gonna, like, be backed into a corner because they have masters at the end of the day. They're not like they have their own autonomy to do certain things, but it's not like they can do whatever they want. And it feels like they're trying to do that right now while they've got time, while they can. But that certainly won't last forever. At least that's my understanding of kind of like, the regulatory landscape in the US. But I'll leave that at that for now. Definitely.
00:08:26.016 - 00:08:57.118, Speaker A: Obviously going to keep an eye on what's happening with regulatory stuff in the US. You know, I heard that someone in the, in the, kind of, like, at the conference in the US in New York, the mainnet conference, got served a subpoena from the SEC while on an elevator or something like that. And there's rumors that it's do Kwon from the terror ecosystem hasn't been confirmed yet. So I don't want to kind of, like, say that that's a sure thing or anything like that. But the thing is, is that do is a south korean resident and citizen. He is not based in the US. The terror ecosystem was born out of South Korea.
00:08:57.118 - 00:09:22.678, Speaker A: But the thing is, is that they have a very popular stable coin called UST, which also has a very popular yield bearing product in anchor, which allows you to get about 20%, I think, on your UST. So I think what the SEC is doing is going after these yield generating or yield bearing products because their banker overlords are basically saying, well, you know, this is eating into our profits. That's. That's kind of my take on it. I know that some people say, oh, it's a conspiracy. The SEC is not doing that. It's like, follow the.
00:09:22.678 - 00:09:59.230, Speaker A: Follow the clues, guys. Like, it's not hard to draw these kind of conclusions, you know, especially going off what the SEC has already done and the products that they're going after, like, Coinbase lend, for example. But anyway, living at that for now. So, uh, Coinbase institutional, uh, the. Sorry, the Coinbase institutional Twitter account put out a great little kind of, I guess, table here where they said, despite the recent sell off, ETH is on track to close its 6th consecutive positive quarter. So you can see here that obviously, um, you know, uh, through 2020, it was all kind of like green, every quarter all positive. And then in 2021, you also have kind of, like, positively here.
00:09:59.230 - 00:10:19.964, Speaker A: This is the 7th, I think, consecutive quarter. I don't know why they said. They said 6th year. Maybe they did. They didn't notice that it was 7th, unless I'm reading it wrong, because q one, q two, q three, q four, and 2020 were all positive, and so is the three quarters in 2021. So 7th consecutive positive quarter, which is even better than six. Right.
00:10:19.964 - 00:10:38.232, Speaker A: But, you know, the funny thing is, is that I was thinking about this today. I'm like, okay, wow, we're already at the end of q three. For some reason, my brain was thinking about, you know, these quarters as seasons. Like I was saying, okay, well, you know, q three is. Is basically starts in September. I don't know why my brain was going like that. Definitely doesn't happen like that.
00:10:38.232 - 00:10:53.856, Speaker A: Q three ends in September. And then we have q four being October, November, December. And q four is actually usually a very good month for. For. For crypto, especially bitcoin. I mean, you can see here in the chart that it may not look like it. Um, but q four leading into, I guess, like, q one is.
00:10:53.856 - 00:11:08.924, Speaker A: Is pretty good for crypto generally. Uh, but, like, I guess 2018 and 2019 were both bear market years. If you want to look at bull market years, 2020 was very good. 2017 obviously was very good. And then 2021, who knows? Maybe it's. Maybe it's good or bad. And even in 2015, it was pretty good.
00:11:08.924 - 00:11:28.140, Speaker A: But if you look at bitcoin, it usually performs really well in q four and sometimes into q one. ETH definitely performs better in kind of like, I guess, later q four, earlier q one sort of thing. So we're going to have to see how that plays out. But who knows? I mean, obviously, I'm still bullish. Obviously. I don't think. I mean, I've said it before.
00:11:28.140 - 00:11:54.844, Speaker A: I don't think we're going into, like, a two year bear market. You know, say we like PE in Q four, Q one, and then we go into a two year bear market until 2024. I don't see that happening at all. You know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it does happen maybe I'm completely off base there, but I can't imagine that happening. But I still think this kind of, like, table is pretty cool to kind of see here. And then, you know, the reason why, or at least one of the reasons why I don't see these kind of, like, long term bear markets happening is stuff like this.
00:11:54.844 - 00:12:37.940, Speaker A: So this was a reply to a tweet that I kind of put out. The tweet that I replied to today about ERp 1559, where this person called t on twitter said the data around 1559 is honestly pretty crazy. Miners still have a good chunk that they will be selling if we keep with history, but we're talking like 150,000 ETH instead of 400 plus thousand. And there's this kind of little chart here that shows just how kind of like the mining supply shock ratio, how prevalent it has been, or how kind of like, effective it has been since 1559 went live. And the funny thing is, as I've mentioned before, 1559 is only the appetizer we've got. The merge is the main course. The merge is a supply shock much greater than 1559.
00:12:37.940 - 00:13:21.466, Speaker A: And I wrote about this in the newsletter today, but essentially the reason why it's much greater, I mean, I've talked about this a lot before, but the TLDR, for those who haven't, haven't kind of like, listened to those episodes, essentially the, the merge is a 90% issuance reduction instantly. So, and instead of issuing about 4.5% ETH per year that we are now to miners, we would be issuing 0.6% ETH there. And then coupled with the burn, we would be net deflationary. But outside of that, there's a key difference here that I don't think a lot of people realize. You have miners today, even if they've taken a pay cut, they're like, with 1559, they are still forced to sell most of the ETH that they mine because of the fact that they have these massive ongoing costs.
00:13:21.466 - 00:13:53.410, Speaker A: There's electricity costs, personnel costs, they have maintenance costs. They have to buy new hardware every now and again. They have obviously, tax and stuff like that. So there's, there's that aspect to it. And they also have to probably pay play kind of like rent as well for like, these data centers that they have to kind of like rent out to put their miners in. Then contrast that to contrast, contrast that to stakers who not only are going to be earning much less, but still keep the chain secure at 0.6% a year at current staked amount.
00:13:53.410 - 00:14:18.798, Speaker A: But on top of that, they also are not forced to sell ETH to cover anything, really, besides taxes. The only force sign that they have is taxes. They have a much, much smaller electricity bill than a miner does. Like 99.9% smaller than the electricity bill than a miner does. And to be honest, do people mining. Sorry, staking, they can pay that extra bit of electricity bill they have with their normal income.
00:14:18.798 - 00:14:48.892, Speaker A: They don't even have to cash out ETH to pay for it. So really, the only time a staker is going to be selling ETH, I, you know, I think this is going to apply to most stakers is to cover taxes. And this isn't going to be all stakers either, because there's going to be places where staking isn't considered kind of income tax and it's kind of tax free. I'm not sure exactly which places that those are, but they do exist, of course. Right? So there's going to be that. There's going to be different kind of like tax levels as well. Business tax for people who have businesses or for institutions that are staking and things like that.
00:14:48.892 - 00:15:17.400, Speaker A: And then there's personal income tax, and it's going to vary. So let's say, like, there's a flat 30% tax, right? Just, just as an assumption here, maybe it's 40%, maybe it's 20%. I don't know. Let's just say it's a 30% flat tax. So really only 30% of newly issued ETH would be forced to sell each, each year to cover. To cover taxes. And maybe that doesn't even end up happening, because what ends up happening is, is people just pay their taxes on that, that they owe on that from other things, maybe from other gains that maybe within the ecosystem, maybe from selling ETH at.
00:15:17.400 - 00:15:38.404, Speaker A: They kind of, um, weren't staking. So when you kind of bring this all together, the supply shock coming with the merge is insane. Like, I don't think people realize just how insane this supply shock is. There's been, there's never been anything like this. And people sometimes argue back against me and say, oh, well, scarcity is like only one side of the equation. You need demand as well. Well, hello.
00:15:38.404 - 00:16:15.600, Speaker A: Like, how much demand do we have for ETH right now? Um, the, the fee burning doesn't just happen for no reason. The fee burning happens because people are using ethnic to use the ethereum network to pay gas fees, and that's tens of millions of dollars of daily revenue and tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH. Being burned every day, which translates to tens of millions of dollars worth of demand for ETH. Then you have demand for ETH for staking. Of course you have it for defi, you have it for people just holding ETH as a store of value, people using ETH as money within the NFT economy, and a bunch of other use cases out there and ones that we haven't even thought of. Like, I just. The demand side is there, guys.
00:16:15.600 - 00:16:28.008, Speaker A: Like, it's not just, I'm not just saying that, like, scarcity is everything. I don't believe that at all. And this has always been my problem with the bitcoin. A school of thought is where they're basically like, well, we have scarcity. That's all we. That's fine. You know, demand will come because of that.
00:16:28.008 - 00:16:53.438, Speaker A: I don't believe that at all. I believe you need very strong demand drivers and a very strong demand side to match the scarcity. Or our scarcity means nothing. Like, I can create a token today, right? I can just go there underneath the scan, create a token, make it like, just have like a supply of ten, right? No one's gonna care. Like, really? And no one's gonna care at all. It's gonna go to zero. Like, if I don't do anything with it, it's gonna go to zero because there's not gonna be any fundamental demand for that token.
00:16:53.438 - 00:17:29.260, Speaker A: Doesn't matter how scarce it is. So the same applies to everything. And that's why I always push back on people that kind of come at me with scarcities and everything. And I know that. And I wouldn't be kind of like pushing this as a bullish scenario for ETH if the demand side wasn't there either, because it's all well and good to issue, much less eats and have much less ETH entering, kind of like the circulating supply. But if there's not a demand side to match that, it's kind of meaningless, because there'll be, because on net, there would be more supply entering the market than there would be demand, which means that you would have a lower price over time anyway. But the reality is, is that there's much more demand even at these levels.
00:17:29.260 - 00:17:54.584, Speaker A: Like we've been able to appreciate from an $80 ETH or $9 ETH in March 2020 to a $3,000 ETH today. And, you know, at all time high was a $4,400 ETH, and we're still issuing 4.5% new ETH a year. And this was, majority of this move was done before 1559 was issued as well. So, you know, we're currently not issuing 4.5%. I think it's about 3% if you can't account for the fee burn. But the fee burn has only been live for like seven weeks.
00:17:54.584 - 00:18:38.354, Speaker A: So before that, and it went live after we went to 4400. So we were able to go 44 x or more than that off the bottom in March 2020 in kind of like a year and a bit. With that level of issuance, imagine what the ETH price is going to do when we have the same, if not more demand that we've had over the last few months, minus the like 90% less or more than that issuance reduction. It's just insane when you think about it, right? So I think a lot of people are sleeping on this. This is, I mean, I've said this before, but this is the main reason why I stack ETH every day and I have no issues with it. This is the main reason why I believe ETH is going to $100,000 plus. As crazy as that sounds, as crazy as people have called me about that, they said the same thing to me, about $10,000.
00:18:38.354 - 00:19:11.510, Speaker A: And now $10,000 is considered a bearish target. We're pretty close to $10,000. Really, in the grand scheme of things, we could be there within the next few months. So from that perspective, and taking all that into account, the world is not ready for this. And that's kind of like the TL doctor kind of bull case, I guess, for ETH. But at the end of the day, I think all of this doesn't matter unless we still have the demand side. So let's keep going the demand side through apps, you know, through kind of like getting people to use their network, getting a L2s online so they pay the high fees and users don't.
00:19:11.510 - 00:19:47.694, Speaker A: All that sorts of stuff like continue the NFT stuff. I. I mean, I have no doubt that that's going to continue, and I don't think that at this point it can be stopped. I think ethereum has reached escape velocity where just there's too much happening, the network effects are too strong, and the fees aren't hampering adoption in my eyes. I think the fees maybe in the very short term, have kind of like made other chains, sorry, benefited other chains because they were able to get the users. But I don't really think that's a long term thing because these same users are going to come and use L2s on Ethereum, which are paying for layer one security anyway, which just. I mean, it's still paying for the fees.
00:19:47.694 - 00:20:11.934, Speaker A: Fees are still getting burned, all that sort of stuff. So, yeah, crazy stuff going on there, but I'll leave that at that for now. I've got a bunch of other stuff to get through today. So MJs from Lyra Finance here is teasing that before the end of the year, Lyra is going to launch markets that don't exist anywhere, on chain or not. This is really cool. I'm a fan of the Lyra project. As I've said before, I did kind of participate in one of Lyra's kind of funding rounds.
00:20:11.934 - 00:20:27.914, Speaker A: But I've been talking about Lyra for quite a while now. I've been talking about them before. I kind of did that. For those who don't know, Lyra is an options protocol that exists on optimism. It's a L2 only protocol is not on layer one. And they kind of like, got spun out of the synthetics ecosystem. They've been having some decent growth.
00:20:27.914 - 00:20:52.876, Speaker A: I think they just started the liquidity mining program the other day, so you can earn some tokens there. But, yeah, I'm excited to see what these markets are. I mean, the fun thing about crypto is that we can't have markets for literally anything. And I think that the reason why maybe it hasn't taken off, as I've described about prediction markets before, is the scaling aspect to it. So we need those low fees. But Larry doesn't suffer from this because they're on optimism. They get to enjoy the low fees and instant transactions on there.
00:20:52.876 - 00:21:28.860, Speaker A: So, yeah, definitely looking forward to that. So one of my, I guess, like, favorite people lately that I. That I've been talking about a fair bit, I think, on the refuel and a bit on Twitter is polynya. And he put out another blog post today where he basically detailed short, kind of like, thoughts on the metaverse and how we're going to reconstruct society from kind of first principles. And I guess the gist of the post is that a lot of the kind of, I guess, stuff that limits us within meat space within kind of like the real world goes away in the metaverse because the metaverse is essentially infinite. We can build worlds that are as big as we want or as small as we want. We can do anything in these worlds.
00:21:28.860 - 00:22:10.736, Speaker A: There's no limitations to what we want to do. We can kind of, like, restructure the way people coordinate and live. We can live in these metaverses. You know, I mean, there's been lots of Sci-Fi about this before, where people kind of living in these places, and I think, you know, as the world progresses the way it is right now, where more people kind of, I guess, work from home, I guess with COVID a lot of travel was kind of like, was canceled as well. More people got used to living at home, sorry, living at home, working from home, staying at home and stuff like that. The metaverse is definitely going to, I think, be a big kind of theme over the next decade for sure, especially with virtual reality making strides and kind of like improving as time goes on as well. But yeah, I mean, this short little note from Pauline got my just brain thinking, spinning about things like that.
00:22:10.736 - 00:22:45.788, Speaker A: So I definitely give, recommend giving it a read. I think it's just a great little snippet of what to expect from the metaverse. So Patrick Makora put out an interesting tweet today where he said anyone has played around with arbitrum, optimism, aztecs, darkware loop, ring, ZK sync has noticed that they get a coinbase experience. So basically, you know, fast, fearless, kind of like low fee experience, proof of reserves by default. What he means by this is that we can basically audit the smart contracts, anyone can, and see that they have the money that we expect to be in there. So the reserves are there. There's no lying.
00:22:45.788 - 00:23:08.804, Speaker A: It's not like an exchange. They can say, oh yeah, we're fully backed, we have all the currency that we say we do, but then they don't prove that. There's no way around this. This is all provable on chain self custody by default. Obviously, you're just using metamask. It's all in your wallet. Yes, there are centralization vectors to some of these L2s right now, but that'll go away in time, of course, and that'll decentralize over time.
00:23:08.804 - 00:23:47.882, Speaker A: And then you get instant confirmations of your transactions, but delayed financing. Now what this means is, as I've explained before, when you use, when you do transactions on these chains, especially something like an arbitram, for example, and optimism, your transaction is, it may be instant in terms of confirmation, but the finality of that transaction is delayed until the batch is posted on layer one ethereum. Now, until that batch is posted, that transaction may be confirmed but not finalized, which means it can in reality not exist at all until the batch is, is posted to layer one. So that's something to keep in mind as well. And then he goes on to say, you know, version 0.1 of the scaling crypto future is already here. And I think that's a great way to put it.
00:23:47.882 - 00:24:20.304, Speaker A: We're still super early on the scaling front. This is really just the very beginning of everything that we're kind of, like, trying to build here. But it's great to see that all these features are already kind of like front and center within these L2s. And speaking of L2, this fantasy soccer NFT platform, so rare, which I've spoken about before, has raised $680 million in a series B led by Softbank. This is a huge round. I don't know if this is the biggest funding round in crypto that I've seen lately. I know that flow had a couple of big rounds.
00:24:20.304 - 00:24:48.110, Speaker A: I think this might be bigger than that. I can't remember exactly or about the same size of it, but it seems that NFT mania is well and good. That doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. There's no, I guess, like, even the NFT market on, on kind of like open sea and stuff like that seems to be making a rebound from, I guess, coming down off its highs. But this is insane. And the thing is, is that so rare is not built on flow, another blockchain or their own blockchain. They're built on Ethereum because they're using starkware.
00:24:48.110 - 00:25:00.766, Speaker A: So they're using Stark X, which is Starkware's kind of technology there. I don't think there is a roll up. I believe that they're a valid. I'm. Or kind of like, not. They're not evolution because I don't think that's out yet. I believe they're a valid.
00:25:00.766 - 00:25:18.070, Speaker A: I'm actually, if I. If I look it up quickly here, I'll be able to get you an answer. Yes, they are, Lydia, which basically means they keep the data off chain, but they post the proofs on chain, so they're not technically a ZK roll up. But that's okay for stuff like this. I think that's the perfect construction for stuff like this. And so we have volitions, which are even better than. Than volydiums.
00:25:18.070 - 00:25:49.976, Speaker A: But, I mean, this is amazing to see. This is, I mean, I'm not really into kind of like soccer or anything like that, or sports generally like that, but I see the, the massive appeal. I mean, it's a huge sport worldwide. There's, I think, billions of fans, and obviously, a lot of people love to trade, kind of like do fantasy sports stuff. So, yeah, I mean, Softbank sees that. A bunch of other investors see that as well, I believe. What are the other investors? Actually, I don't remember, um, there's a few, I guess a lot of them were web two based investors, not a lot of crypto native investors, but I think the crypto native ones actually got into the previous rounds.
00:25:49.976 - 00:26:19.480, Speaker A: As I said, this is a series b. They've obviously already done a seed in a series a. Uh, but you can see, yeah, I mean, uh, Atomico, Bessemer Ventures, d one capital, they're all traditional, kind of like web two, uh, kind of, I guess, like VC's and funds here, which is actually pretty bullish because this is what we need. We need these kind of like bigger players from the web two, I guess, world to legitimize this sort of stuff, especially investing more in the ethereum ecosystem. So I'm really happy to see. So, you know, so raise this and congrats to the team on that. All right.
00:26:19.480 - 00:26:50.796, Speaker A: Polygon is now has support from Bitfinex. So the Polygon pos chain, if you're a bit for next user, you can withdraw to it directly from the exchange, which is really cool. So you can, I think it just supports matic right now, I think. And then maybe they support other kind of like exchange kind of withdrawals here. Oh, and this is also a listing, I believe, too. So I didn't know that matic wasn't live on Bitfinex just yet, but I guess it's live now. And you can also withdraw it to the POS chain, which means that that's just another bridge into the POS chain.
00:26:50.796 - 00:27:31.660, Speaker A: Don't have to go through a theorem if you don't want, don't have to go through hot protocol or anything like that. You can go through Bitfinex if you are a bit for next user. So frame, which is basically an Ethereum wallet that some of you may or may not have heard of, have released an extension that now order automatically verifies Ens names on Twitter. So if you hover over someone that has an EnS name in their, in their kind of like Twitter name here and hover over this little Ethereum icon, you'll be able to kind of like see the kind of like the inventory of these sorts of things, like what people are holding their name, stuff like that. I mean, if I go to mine, it's probably, it's probably better example here if it wants to load, you know, these live demos, man, they never, they never work really well. There you go. And you can see my inventory.
00:27:31.660 - 00:27:57.400, Speaker A: You can see all the NFTs that I have and you can kind of scroll through them and stuff like that, yeah, you can see them all here. And the funny thing is, is that like it says, you know, I've got no NFT profile picture. This is actually going to be an NFT. This was here from the loom lock Nft kind of project. And you know, then you can see if the NSN was verified or not. I'm yet to verify mine, but I do obviously own sassle ETH. But yeah, I thought this was just a little, really cool little feature here that frame has done.
00:27:57.400 - 00:28:28.504, Speaker A: And those who don't know frame is just like an alternative Ethereum wallet or an Ethereum wallet that is an alternative to something like metamask and stuff like that. And I've heard a lot of good things about it. I haven't used it too much yet, I'm definitely gonna use it. But I think from what I've read, it also works really well with the lattice one hardware wallet too. So that'll be really cool to check out as well. But I mean, if you wanna get the extension, the frame extension, to basically be able to see this on Twitter where you can automatically see people's NFTs that they've got on their Ens name and stuff like that, definitely go download it. It'll be linked in the YouTube description.
00:28:28.504 - 00:28:54.114, Speaker A: Just a quick shout out here to cryptocurrency jobs. They have a weekly newsletter that basically highlights the best new jobs at leading companies within crypto. So if you are looking for a job, definitely subscribe to this newsletter. You'll be able to keep up to date with what's happening in the, I guess, like hiring space and potentially get yourself a job as well. As I've spoken about many times before, there are many different paths into crypto or into working in crypto. This is just one of them. So definitely sign up to this.
00:28:54.114 - 00:29:39.004, Speaker A: And speaking of kind of, I guess, like roles available right now, the ESP, the EF ecosystem support program, is currently hiring a team lead. They're looking for someone organized, innovative and passionate about Ethereum. If and if you think you might be the right person to lead a small but hardworking grants team, see the job posting and apply here. And I'll link this in the YouTube description, of course. But if that sounds like you, if you want to head up a small, little nimble team as part of this program, where basically what the ESP do is that they give out grants from the Ethereum Foundation's treasury to ecosystem projects, I think that's actually a pretty cool job. You're going to be able to decide which projects get grants, kind of like filter through them, see all the cool projects that are happening within the space, and lead a small team. So, yeah, if that sounds like something you want to do, definitely check this out.
00:29:39.004 - 00:29:49.244, Speaker A: But I think that's it for today. So thank you, everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give that video a thumbs up. Subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks, everyone.
