00:00:00.360 - 00:00:20.926, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Guy refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 19 May 2021. All right, everyone, I'm sure you've been waiting for this episode today. It's been a day, that's for sure. I don't know what to say, really. I'm kind of in disbelief. Obviously.
00:00:20.926 - 00:00:53.228, Speaker A: I'm talking about the price here. You can see on the chart that this has been one of the worst dumps in probably in a very long time. I would say it's gone much lower than most people thought it would. You know, we went actually under 2000 here at 1900 at time of recording. I really hope by the time you're watching this, we haven't gone further down than that. Like, this is, this is really, really crazy. I mean, if I switch to the, to the weekly chart here, you can see, like, the magnitude of kind of, like this dump is very similar to what happened with the COVID dump.
00:00:53.228 - 00:01:28.850, Speaker A: And that's actually the vibes that kind of like I'm getting right now is this feels exactly like the COVID dump from back in March. People getting kind of liquidated everywhere, right? People kind of losing lots of money, people, you know, really, really panicking trying to buy dips, but it just keeps falling. And I, yeah, I personally, I mean, don't know what to think over the short term. I don't, I didn't expect this. I don't think anyone expected this. You know, there were some people calling for around a $3,000 ETH, right? And they probably, I mean, they were right there, obviously, and they probably got filled there with some buys. But I don't think anyone expected this.
00:01:28.850 - 00:02:04.744, Speaker A: And there was no reason for it, really. I mean, I know I spoke about the other day how, you know, as humans, we always try to find reasons for these dumps and things like that. But for dumps of this magnitude in such a short amount of time, you would expect something to trigger it. Right? Like, we can point to this one and say, okay, well, this was the global kind of sell off because of the COVID uncertainty. And then you look at this one, you're like, okay, like, why did we, why did we come down here? Was it because we went up too fast? Um, which, I mean, we went up really fast. And, like, I expected the dump off, you know, these levels up here, but myself and pretty much no one else expected it to go down like this much off that. And you usually don't see that.
00:02:04.744 - 00:02:26.704, Speaker A: Right. We didn't even say that in all the other previous dumps that we've had, um, you know, over the last few months, so. Or at least even over the last year. Like, this is literally like it was back here, which is, yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely giving people pause, I think. I obviously still remain long term bullish and everything like that. Haven't sold any ETH. I actually dipped into my fiat reserves for the first time in a long time today to buy ETH.
00:02:26.704 - 00:02:55.844, Speaker A: I bought it about 2900, which obviously wasn't ideal because I really did not think it was going to go this deep. But, yeah, I don't really, you know, I don't really have any kind of, like, other. Other things to say, you know, in terms of, like, words of wisdom or what to do or anything like that. I'm not going to tell you what to do. You know, I always encourage people to just really manage your leverage and not take on too much leverage when you're trading or doing, you know, these sorts of things. Uh, because, yeah, it's very easy to kind of get wiped out on these. On these dumps, and I've seen many people, uh, get wiped out on them.
00:02:55.844 - 00:03:17.074, Speaker A: So I really, uh, encourage you, if you are, uh, playing with leverage, to play it really safe. At the end of the day, like, whenever I take out a leverage position, my liquidation price right now is like dollar 700. Right. It is really, really low. And, you know, not to say that it can't go to there, right. But, like, that would be really, really, really bad. Um, you know, what we just saw was really bad.
00:03:17.074 - 00:03:35.058, Speaker A: And, you know, some people are saying, oh, well, that's the bull market done. It's over. We're going into another two year bear market. I honestly don't think so. You know, and this is just my opinion. I could be totally off base and wrong here, but this bull market, to me, the entire time has felt very different to 2017. Like, very, very different.
00:03:35.058 - 00:04:08.392, Speaker A: And all the charts that you can kind of look at, people try to compare it. You know, they try to compare 2017 to today and, and trying to find patterns and things like that, that's fine. But I think in terms of just, like, general, not, not just market structure, but general kind of, like, attention around crypto and how crypto has been going and, like, you know, crypto becoming more legitimate as a platform, especially aetherium and things like that, I think that plays a big, big role, but those are more longer term things. I don't think it's a short term thing. Short term, I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen. I have never claimed to know what's going to happen short term. Most people don't.
00:04:08.392 - 00:04:25.894, Speaker A: Right. But yeah, I guess, you know, long term, I'm still really bullish. I don't know if we're going to go into, I mean, this damage here has been pretty brutal. Like we could go into a sideways slash down movement for four months from here. I don't know if that, if that's going to happen. Maybe it doesn't happen. I'm not playing it in any particular way.
00:04:25.894 - 00:05:08.822, Speaker A: I'm not buying or selling assets or doing anything like that. I'm definitely not, you know, taking on leverage to try to play these kinds of things. And, you know, right now the, the market is like super crazy. You know, even just like on chain, you can see here the gas prices are 2000 dozen way. That means a lot of people are currently like super scared and they trying to close their positions, their on chain kind of like leverage positions and things like that so that it, and get liquidated. There's a lot of arbitrage going on between the different exchanges and things like that. So, yeah, I think, you know, this is going to be the highest volume dump in history for crypto, I believe because there's so much money in the system now, I believe it'll be the highest 24 hours fee revenue for the Ethereum network ever.
00:05:08.822 - 00:05:36.024, Speaker A: Because 2000 GWeI, that's, that's a crazy kind of price there. And I just believe that this is going to be a day that's etched into a lot of people's minds. You know, think about the last few months, how many new people have come into this ecosystem. They haven't experienced anything like this. Like you can just look on the chart. They have never experienced. I mean, if we, if we kind of measure it from top to what it went to the bottom here, that was a 56, 57% drop in two, in two weeks.
00:05:36.024 - 00:05:55.384, Speaker A: Right? Like this is, I mean, not even two weeks. This is the 10 may 9 days. We had a 56% drop in nine days. That is not something that, you know, most people have experienced. Right. And this is just ETH, like a lot of the other things are down, you know, about this amount, if not more. And people are going to get scared off.
00:05:55.384 - 00:06:09.314, Speaker A: Definitely people are going to get scared off here. There's institutions that are now underwater. Like think about Elon Musk with his Tesla bitcoin buy. Definitely underwater at this price. I don't think they're they're so reactionary that they're going to sell the bottom or anything like that. But. But who knows, right? And.
00:06:09.314 - 00:06:47.720, Speaker A: And who knows where the. Where the buying pressure is going to come from, you know, immediately. Now everyone's like, you know, buy the dip and you see these kind of wicks playing out, or people try to buy the dip and then it keeps going lower because of the fact that people keep getting liquidated because they're buying the dip on leverage and stuff like that. Um, and then, yeah, if you just, like, structurally look at the chart here, I mean, the monthly chart looks pretty, pretty bad. Um, but we've seen this before, you know, remember the 2100 to 1300 dip? But I think this dip feels a bit differently to that one. I think that one, you know, I pretty much everyone I knew was just laughing it off and thought that it was like, you know, just a hilarious dip. To buy this dip feels different, like, the sentiment that I'm seeing.
00:06:47.720 - 00:07:13.440, Speaker A: People are genuinely scared this time. So, you know, whether that's a signal that, you know, this is like a local bottom, we're going to continue higher. I don't know. As I said, not playing the short term kind of markets here, and long term, still bullish. Long term, still plenty of catalysts for ethanol, uh, you know, coming around and things like that. But I'm not going to tell you that if you buy now, you're going to, you know, double your money tomorrow, anything like that. I don't know when, you know, what the bounce is going to be like here or how.
00:07:13.440 - 00:07:39.600, Speaker A: How much it's going to bounce or anything like that. So, yeah, just wanted to kind of get in front of a lot of questions that I'm sure are going to pop up, you know, over the coming days about what happened. There was no trigger, really, at the end of the day. There was. There was no trigger. There was just, you know, it started dumping and then it kept dumping, and then fear kicked in and it kept dumping. You know, you had cascading, liquidation, liquidations going on, and then extreme fear kicked in and it kept dumping, blah, blah, blah, you know, and then eventually the market, you know, always finds a bottom.
00:07:39.600 - 00:07:57.760, Speaker A: It's not going to zero. Like, anyone who's saying it's going to zero is joking or they're just, like, totally off base. It's not going to zero. That's just dumb. But, you know, there's no telling what happens from here. Do we go into a bear market? Do we go into a bull market? Who, you know, so do we continue the bull market. Who knows, right? Maybe this is just a different kind of cycle.
00:07:57.760 - 00:08:44.862, Speaker A: Maybe we just have, like, a longer cycle playing out now where it doesn't play out like the other ones did, which I think is actually true, because if you look at them, I mean, just, just the structure of these monthly charts on the 2017 kind of bull market for ETH, they went up a lot quicker. Right. This just seems a lot more gradual, gradual, like, in terms of, like, magnitude, even though we've gone up to some pretty crazy prices. So maybe we just get a longer bull market, right? Maybe we just get a longer. Maybe. Maybe the markets actually, you know, maybe ironically, the market's actually maturing to, to a point where we are able to quickly clear out a lot of these kind of, like, a lot of this toxic leverage in the system, quickly clear out the, quote, unquote, weak hands, and we can continue up from here much quicker than that. So we basically have, like, mini bears and, and bull cycles instead of, like, one grand cycle.
00:08:44.862 - 00:09:01.382, Speaker A: So we'll see what happens. As I said, you know, I've said this a few times already, but I don't have any special knowledge. Anyone claiming to have any special knowledge on Twitter is, is kidding themselves. No one saw this coming. Absolutely no one. I follow a budget traders. I follow investors.
00:09:01.382 - 00:09:27.134, Speaker A: I follow a lot of smart people. Absolutely no one saw this. And anyone who tells you otherwise is just, he's just laughing or, you know, just basically faking it out. Maybe there's, like, one trader that I haven't seen that put some, like, chart out there that said we would go back to this price. You know, just like a random guess. You know, a broken clock is right twice a day and all that sort of stuff. But generally, yeah, this was, this was, this was bad in terms of, like, catching people off guard.
00:09:27.134 - 00:09:59.772, Speaker A: I'm curious to see where we go from here. But anyway, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave it at that because there's not much else I can say here. I don't, I don't have any special insights. I did put out a tweet here that said, in hindsight, the dog tokens were a pretty amazing top signal. And generally, I mean, not, not so much the dog tokens, but more specifically, I guess, the, the general froth in, like, the shitcoin market, I guess you could call it in the scam market, in the dead zombie chain market. That. I mean, to me personally, I saw that and I was like, this is just, this is just insane.
00:09:59.772 - 00:10:20.638, Speaker A: Like, and then I was thinking to myself, surely this, we're going to have to pay for this somehow. Surely we're going to have a, have a pullback. And then when we did have the pullback, I was like, okay, this is healthy, right? This is clearing out a lot of this kind of like, crap that's been going on. But then we kept falling, and I'm like, okay, okay. And then we kept falling again, and we've kept falling. And who knows if it stopped by the time you watched this video, maybe we were, maybe we've fallen even further. I hope not.
00:10:20.638 - 00:10:41.430, Speaker A: But I think that, you know, in hindsight, right, it was, it's a pretty amazing top signal. But as I said, you know, as I explained the other day, these are just humans. You know, I'm human. I'm looking for signals in the noise. I'm looking for reasons why. But at the end of the day, maybe there isn't a reason why. Maybe it was just a random thing that happened and was going to happen anyway and people are just going to have to deal with it.
00:10:41.430 - 00:11:16.490, Speaker A: So that's that. I think I want to move on to some more positive news, actually, I think I have one more tweet here, uh, from Ash here, who said that, and he posted this before all the big dumps happen. But he said that, you know, BTC inflows to exchanges have been quite large, whereas ETH outflows have been, have been large. So it's kind of like a flip there. Now, I personally, I actually think this whole dump was BTC led. Um, I think BTC has been weak for quite a while because it, you know, kind of rejected 64k. Rejected going into price discovery again, then came back down, broke through all those psychological levels.
00:11:16.490 - 00:11:23.170, Speaker A: Broke through 40k, almost broke through. Thirty k. I don't think it actually broke through 30k. If I check my charts here. No. Wow. Holy crap.
00:11:23.170 - 00:11:39.170, Speaker A: I'm just looking at the chart now. It wicked off thirty k. Oh my God. I'm just looking at the charts up here. There's some insane wicks going on now, so. And what a wick means, basically, I'm looking at the 1 hour charts, and when you look at a candle, there's like the body of the candle and then there's the wick. If something's like wicking up.
00:11:39.170 - 00:12:03.522, Speaker A: Right, right. From a price, it means it was like a, you know, it just bounced really hard because there was a lot of people buying at that price. But you can also have like wicks down where a lot of people were selling and like all of that really positive price action was kind of a raise there. But yeah, I'm just looking at it now. So BTC did actually touch 30k there. ETH went to, you know, I think maybe 1800 or something like that, depending on what exchange you look at. I usually look at Coinbase pro, but I'm just.
00:12:03.522 - 00:12:30.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just looking at the charts now, but I'll leave it at that for now. But as I said, I think that, yeah, this was definitely BTC led. I'm, you know, I don't know. I don't know how institutions are going to treat these. Are they going to look at these markets and be like, holy shit, like this stuff just fell 50% in a couple of weeks. Can we actually put money into this? Like how risky is this? Who knows? We'll see. But still good stats here from Ash, who kind of like spotted these BTC inflows and ETH outflows here.
00:12:30.258 - 00:13:13.702, Speaker A: But I'm going to leave it at that, I think, and move on to the next piece of news here, which is that Cathie Woods, Ark. In investment holding company here is holding the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and has about 639,000 shares, which I think at current prices equates to $2 million, maybe. I'm actually not sure what the current ethy price is. I'm just scrolling through the comments to see if there's any prices here. But anyway, it's a few million dollars, I think, of Ethio, which is really cool to see that Cathy owns ETH because she owns BTC as well, or her fund at least owns BTC as well. So makes sense here. That's a positive signal too, I think, in it, you know, generally it's just a positive signal that these institutions are even buying this sort of stuff to begin with.
00:13:13.702 - 00:13:25.870, Speaker A: You know, it's, as you've seen, it's still very, very risky. You know, who knows if they're going to keep buying stuff now. Maybe they will. Maybe they'll buy the dip, right? Like everyone wants to buy the dip. Institutions are the same. Like I. They're made up of people.
00:13:25.870 - 00:14:00.998, Speaker A: Maybe they want to, maybe they think this is a steal. Who knows? But yeah, still really cool to see. See, kind of Kathy, I mean, see, I kind of put out this kind of announcement today. They're holding some, some ETH through the grayscale Ethereum trust here. So there's a great blog post put out today from the Ethereum foundation researcher Carl here, who basically said that Ethereum, the TLDR of the blog post is that a theorem will use at least 99.95% less energy once the ETH one to ETH two merger goes through. Now, obviously this is because it's going to be proof of stake and not proof of work work.
00:14:00.998 - 00:14:38.040, Speaker A: And the way Carl came to this number is that he basically did a bunch of research here. You know, he definitely made some assumptions, but put together some nice charts and, you know, explained his reasoning in this blog post. So if you want to read this, it'll be linked in the YouTube description, of course. But I think this is another reason, actually, just going back to price for a bit, sorry, but I think this is relevant. I think this is another reason why BTC has been so weak lately, is because of this really bad narrative around its energy use. Because I don't think, as I've explained before, that war can be won. I do think it's going to be a very poor narrative going forward for quite a while for bitcoin.
00:14:38.040 - 00:15:17.974, Speaker A: I do think bitcoin is becoming a little bit poisonous to hold because of it, whether that's poisonous for institutions or individuals or whatever. And I do think there are a lot of people who are going to avoid buying bitcoin because of its energy usage. On the other hand, when ETH one merges with ETH two, we won't have this problem anymore. And that's. That's actually one of the major reasons why I'm bullish on ethereum, like more long term, is because Ethereum doesn't have to deal with this, it doesn't have to be bucketed in with this anymore. And Ethereum can, once the merge happens, we can now advertise Ethereum as being, you know, green and eco friendly and we have stuff to back it up. And it's very simple for us to say, well, Ethereum doesn't use mining, it uses this other thing, which doesn't use.
00:15:17.974 - 00:15:42.662, Speaker A: It uses way less electricity. And that's just a very simple explanation, rather than bitcoiners trying to, you know, explain to people, oh, well, you know, bitcoin encourages renewable energy research. Bitcoin, you know, it doesn't actually use as much energy as you think it does. Bitcoin's good for the planet, blah, blah, blah. As I've said before, that's too complex. Right. That's just doesn't, doesn't lend itself to an easy explanation, it doesn't lend itself to an easy narrative.
00:15:42.662 - 00:16:26.952, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, narratives and memes rule the world. So if you can't explain something simply to a mass group of people, you, you're going to lose the narrative war. And I think bitcoin will lose that narrative war on the energy usage front here. So that's another reason why I'm super bullish on Ethereum. But anyway, if you want to see like an accurate breakdown of it and how Carl came to these numbers, definitely check out this blog post here. So Synthetix had some really great and bullish news yesterday where they basically, Cane, the founder and CEO, put out a blog post detailing kind of the future for synthetix here and what they're actually kind of going down and what paths they're going down. So think the major updates were an update on L2 that they're saying in the next few weeks there's going to be exchange functionality on their L2, which is optimism for those of you who don't, who don't know.
00:16:26.952 - 00:16:53.470, Speaker A: So that's going to be cool to see, you know, optimism, kind of like working in live in the wild here. But also they announced that they're actually spinning out a bunch of projects, you know, from the, from the synthetix umbrella into independent projects. So there's actually going to be four of them, I think. So there's one called fails. And I think. I think, I'm not sure if they, if it's detailed anywhere, but each of these projects do do different things here. Some of them do options, some of them do other things.
00:16:53.470 - 00:17:23.284, Speaker A: But the article explains this, this all. But anyway, there are four projects called Thales, Lyra, Alien and Quinta. And Quinta's live today and they all have their own token. And these tokens will be distributed to SNX stakers. Now, Quinta is actually a front end, an interface that's built on top of synthetix that makes it really easy to trade on the synthetix platform. I think alien is like a treasury platform or something like that, or a fundraise platform for memory. Either fails or Lyra is the options protocol platform.
00:17:23.284 - 00:17:49.592, Speaker A: And then something else. I can't remember exactly what it is. But anyway, if you're an SNX holder, this news would make you very happy. I know. I am very happy. I would love to get, obviously, my hands on some tokens here, but I think this is really cool, just from experimentation point of view and, you know, from a synthetic kind of synthetics fundamentals point of view as well. But I'm most, I guess, like, I'm most excited for the L2 stuff that's happening, you know, exchanging on L2 doing kind of synth swaps and things like that.
00:17:49.592 - 00:18:12.360, Speaker A: Actually, I'm just looking at the screenshots now. So Lyra is the as a native l two options protocol, which is really, really cool and, I don't know, fails decentralized options on more than synth price speculation. So spoil outcomes, elections, flipping. Okay, really, really cool to see that as well. So yeah, if. Yeah, if you're a fan of synthetics, definitely go read that blog post. It is on Kane's twitter.
00:18:12.360 - 00:18:43.654, Speaker A: You'll be able to find it there very easily. So cyber hokey put out a really great tweet thread today, kind of fighting back against this tweet from this person named Emperor BTC here, where he tweeted ethereum maximalist act the same way bitcoin maximalist act to high fees, slow transactions, and lack of scaling criticism. It's the tech. It's the tech you support, not the cult. Except innovations be open to new doors. Adoption can't be paved with slow $300 transactions. Now, antiprosynthesis also replied here where he said, most scalability, R and D today converges to ethereum.
00:18:43.654 - 00:19:13.642, Speaker A: You can be both excited about the high demand that high fees signify and be critical about the inclusivity, inclusivity of such high fees. Meanwhile, transacting BTC on bitcoin is still more expensive than transacting ETH on ethereum. So I think that that kind of, um, guess like tldrs it quite well. But cyber hokey goes into, you know, further detail here where he basically has a thread and he starts the thread by saying, this is false. Ethereum is full of people working on these, not throwing their hands in the air and pivoting to narratives that would disregard the issues. Ethereum is slow. Ethereum is expensive.
00:19:13.642 - 00:19:58.324, Speaker A: Ethereum under proof of work is wasteful. Ethereum acknowledges this, and he's working desperately to fix all of this. I think this is like totally accurate, and I couldn't have said it better myself. Not once have I seen anyone in the ethereum ecosystem say that ethereum is perfect, that high fees for end users are perfect, that we shouldn't scale, that we shouldn't get off proof of work. That is the beauty of Ethereum and the whole Ethereum ecosystem, both in the developed ecosystem and just the general community part of it. We all believe that Ethereum needs to improve, that ethereum is not perfect, that we can keep doing things to make Ethereum the absolute best, you know, blockchain or decentralized blockchain in existence. And we can, we'll keep working to do things like making ETH the best asset in existence.
00:19:58.324 - 00:20:59.374, Speaker A: And that's exactly what happens, right? Like Ethereum's monetary policy isn't just sticking to one thing where we, where we basically say, oh, well, okay, let's just stick to, you know, just perpetual issuance forever and throw our hands up and then we're done, right, and it'll just be arbitrary, whatever we decide. No, what Ethereum did was we did a lot of, kind of like the community and like the, the researchers did a lot of deep diving into what works, right? So we, and then we came up with like the perpetual issuance under ETH two with, with staking and also AIP 1559, that is. And that works to improve a number of different things, which I've gone through before. And then outside of that L2 stuff, right, we took multiple tracks to scaling Ethereum. There are roll ups, there are side chains, there are commit chains, there's plasma, there's all these sorts of things, right? And there's multiple teams tackling this as like ten plus teams, at least, at the very least tackling this. I think there's more than that now. There's probably like 20 teams now that are tackling scaling in L2, scaling in some way, and even more that are tackling scaling in other kind of means.
00:20:59.374 - 00:21:21.408, Speaker A: So when you kind of like, take that, you know, holistic approach, you can see that, you know, Ethereum is very critical of itself and is very open to improving itself. And on top of all of that, we've been working on proof of stake since 2014. We didn't give up on it. We never, we never threw in the tower. We didn't just say, oh, well, this is just the way ethereum is going to be. We're just going to be on proof of work forever. We did not do that.
00:21:21.408 - 00:22:03.736, Speaker A: So, you know, I mean, just going through all of this stuff right now is making me really bullish. Like just, this is, this is the kind of stuff when people tell you to focus on the fundamentals, think in years, not days, right? Because none of this stuff changes with the price moving. Literally none of it. Right. The price of ETH from 2014 went from thirty cents to like, you know, $10 or, sorry, $20. I think in 2016 to like seven dollars to one thousand, four hundred dollars to eighty dollars to, you know, $4,400 to 20, whatever it is now, $300. And literally none of these changed regarding proof of stake, right? Got moving to proof of stake that kept building the entire time scaling and L2 kept building the entire time.
00:22:03.736 - 00:22:36.692, Speaker A: Defi kept building the entire time. And this is what people mean when they say, focus on these things. This is how you don't get shaken out during these dumps, especially dumps like this, where fear is at an all time high. It's just destroyed everyone. Your portfolio is down 50%, right? And you're just like, underwater and you're thinking, is this it? Is this all over? Well, I mean, if you're looking at the charts and depending on what timeframe, you might feel like the world is ending, but then you take a step back and look at all the fundamentals and you might be like, wait, wait, wait a second. This is all real, right? 1559 is still coming. The merge is still coming.
00:22:36.692 - 00:23:11.924, Speaker A: Defi is still going to change the world. You know, all this scaling is coming and everything like that. So taking that kind of, like, long term view there is what I do and what I do a lot of the time and is extremely important to recenter yourself. And, you know, I know it can be very hard to sometimes think of this, especially when, you know, you're seeing things play out in the markets and you're just like, your mind's just on the chart, right? And this is why I encourage people to close the charts. You know, on days like today, what I like to do is I literally just minimize all my charts and I just sit here at my computer. You know, some of my screens are blank, you know? Right. I have my charts on two screens above me here.
00:23:11.924 - 00:23:42.038, Speaker A: I literally have had them close most of the day. And then only, you know, recently when I saw that the, my friends were messaging me, like, holy crap, what's happening? I was like, I looked at the charts and looked at the prices. I'm like, oh, okay. This is, this is interesting here because for your mental health, even if you're a long term thinker, it can get to you, right? Like, no one wants to see their portfolio drop 50%. Like, imagine if your portfolio was like a million dollars and it drops 50%. Like, and, you know, you've made a lot of money. A million dollars is life changing money for, like, more than life changing money for a lot of people.
00:23:42.038 - 00:24:11.280, Speaker A: And you see that drop 50% in a couple of days, of course you're going to feel sick, right? Of course you're going to feel really, really, really bad, and of course you're going to forget all the positive things happening. But at the end of the day, you need to just take a step back. You need to close the charts. Unless you're a trader, there is literally no point looking at the charts unless you had planned to sell, had cell targets in mind. No point. You don't even have to look at the charts to have cell targets in mind. If you want to sell and take profits, put some limit orders up on a centralized exchange because obviously you want to go to fiat, right? But you can do it on Dex as well if you want to go to stable coins.
00:24:11.280 - 00:24:59.388, Speaker A: But if you want to go to fiat, put some limit orders up, say to yourself, okay, well, I'm going to take profits when ETH hits this price and this price and this price, and you don't even have to look at the charts. You can literally come back one day and be like, oh, well, okay, I said the price went to this and go to your exchange account, and you'll see, like, this money sitting in there for you and be like, oh, I'm glad that I set those limit orders now and took profits when I, you know, when I should have. And that's the way to do it. But I know that it's hard because not only do you have to ignore the charts, if you want to avoid the price talk, we have to ignore twitter, you have to ignore the refuel, right? You have to ignore my newsletters. You know, so much of this ecosystem is focused on price, and for good reason, I think, because price drives a lot of activity in this ecosystem and things like that. But at the end of the day, you've got to recenter yourself sometimes. So, anyway, I'll leave it at that for now.
00:24:59.388 - 00:25:30.852, Speaker A: I think Cl had a related tweet here where he said, yeah, he basically put out this tweet where he said, the first of many l two s alive next week. Arbitrum, on May 28 at their Devnet Coinbase wallet, is integrating ethereum's L2. So will many others eat proof of stake in, you know, six months? He's being a bit ambitious there, I think, maybe six to twelve months here. When the merger happens, all Internet culture is being priced in by nfTs. On Ethereum, the masses are now warming up and talking about crypto because of dogecoin. And if you can't see where this is going, well, you know, we can't help you. And you can see this.
00:25:30.852 - 00:26:01.914, Speaker A: This is the adoption curve for technologies. They start off slow, right, and slower than, than you would think, and then they just go exponential. Humans have a very hard time grasping exponential growth and have a very, very hard time coming to terms with it. But this is what's going to happen. In terms of adoption, this is exactly what I was just talking about. The prices don't change this, right? The building still happens, it still goes on. But yeah, I mean, I just spoke about all that, so I won't go into that again, but just something relevant, I think, here from Cl, which I thought was pretty cool.
00:26:01.914 - 00:26:39.938, Speaker A: So speaking of L2, Matt Feinstein put out a friendly reminder here to say that as ethereums would be wise to remember, l two means inheriting ethereum level security and that means paying Ethereum for that security in ETH. Loopring just had its all time high paying tolls to Ethereum. $45,000 in gas fees in one day to submit their Zk roll up blocks. So this is exactly how a true L2 works. And this is what I've spoken about before, where the end users themselves aren't going to be paying these high fees. It's going to be the L2s. And the L2s are fine doing it because they generate income in their own way, whether that's from fees on L2 or some other kind of way sort of happening there.
00:26:39.938 - 00:27:03.638, Speaker A: So this is really cool. And obviously post 159, this, these, these fees are going to be burned as well. So, and this is going to keep happening. Looping is only one roll up. We're going to have potentially hundreds of roll ups, right? Maybe even thousands of roll ups. I don't know, you know, paying these security fees to Ethereum, which I think is going to be really cool and I'm really, really excited to see how that shakes out there. But yeah, I'm going to leave that at that for now.
00:27:03.638 - 00:27:29.490, Speaker A: Move on to this tweet from Zach Cole. Just wanted to give a quick shout out here that Zack is looking for a solidity developer for, for Slingshot crypto, of which he is a CTO and co founder. They're a decentralized exchange. They're doing a lot of good work. Just a disclaimer, I'm a seed investor in Slingshot, but for good reason. They have an amazing team, really fun, fun people over there. So definitely if you're a solidity developer and you want to build dope stuff, as Zack says here, definitely a DM.
00:27:29.490 - 00:27:53.902, Speaker A: Zach, I'll leave the link to this tweet in the YouTube description. Finally, I have a transaction here of someone who bought a lot of ETH on using DExs yesterday. And this was passed on to me by someone through DM's. And it's funny because when he passed it on to me, I think the 8th value was over 60 million here that had been bought or maybe like 69 million or something. And now it's down a lot since then. Maybe it's up more. Let's see, is the ETH price.
00:27:53.902 - 00:28:14.022, Speaker A: Oh, wow. The price is back over 2500. And this is at 50 million now. Okay, it doesn't look as bad, but anyway, they used Dexs to buy, to buy this ethio. You can see that they used USDT and they basically, I think they went to one inch, you can see here, one inch v three, and then you can see in the internal transactions. And this was a new address, it looks like. Yeah, it was only created about three days ago here.
00:28:14.022 - 00:28:29.614, Speaker A: So, yeah. Cool to see there's some still. There's some really, really big buyers buying Ethya. Could this be an institution? I don't know. We'll see. But they bought at the wrong time. I think they could have waited just 24 hours and they would have, you know, gotten a better price.
00:28:29.614 - 00:28:47.016, Speaker A: But maybe this doesn't, this doesn't matter in the long run. Maybe when ETH goes to ten k plus they're like, oh, well, you know, we got a good entry anyway. But anyway, I spoken about price a lot today. I know how you all feel right now. I feel the same way. But hopefully the worst is behind us, you know, 24 back to 2500. Maybe we did finally bounce.
00:28:47.016 - 00:29:01.988, Speaker A: I mean, that's a pretty epic balance. I mean, if I open my charts again here, I can see. Yeah. Wow. We went from 1860 on Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, to 2600 in the last hour. So maybe the worst is behind us. I hope so.
00:29:01.988 - 00:29:25.500, Speaker A: I hope you all are keeping your head on. I hope you didn't get liquidated. I hope you're doing okay. I know it can be scary, but at the end of the day, are you in it for the technology? Are you in it for the money? You can be in it for both. But if you're in it for the tech as well, then focus on the fundamentals recenter yourself, watch the refill, read my newsletters, because I always try to focus on the fundamentals of things happening here and just stay the course. Long term, really, really bullish. Short term is noise.
00:29:25.500 - 00:29:37.294, Speaker A: That's all I can say. Anyway, I'm going to leave it at that. Thank you all for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give that video a thumbs up. Subscribe to the newsletter. Join the Discord Channel actually join the Discord Channel because it's absolutely popping lately.
00:29:37.294 - 00:29:47.878, Speaker A: Seriously, if you haven't done so yet. You're missing out on so much alpha and good conversations going on in there. Just join it. You can join the prices channel as well in there and cope with us when. When the dumps are happening. It's. It's quite fun.
00:29:47.878 - 00:29:52.934, Speaker A: I actually enjoy it. It's entertaining. But anyway, that's it for today. Thank you, everyone. I'll see you tomorrow.
