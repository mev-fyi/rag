00:00:00.480 - 00:00:30.706, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where we recap the last 24 hours in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency space. Let's get into it for today. So I guess the price here of ETH has been a bit stale today. You know, it's, that's expected after what we saw over the past 24 hours or so where the prices came down. I think, you know, right now, the volatility has kind of subsided a bit, and the market's just trending sideways for now. You can see that on, on the chart here. It's been trending sideways a little bit.
00:00:30.706 - 00:00:49.694, Speaker A: I don't expect any fireworks for a little bit here. Maybe I'm wrong, but, you know, it seems the market needs to kind of cool off. People need to be more confident again and then we might head further up. But, yeah, not sure what's going to happen there. So we'll keep an eye on that one. You know, same thing for bitcoin here. You can see still just trending sideways.
00:00:49.694 - 00:01:13.804, Speaker A: And then we have the Defi pulse index as well, which is doing similar things. So, you know, I guess in times of when the market kind of corrects and dumps down, it tends to correlate a lot more than it would if it was going up. So, you know, normally correlations decrease in a bull market and they increase in a bear market. But even the short term moves, the correlations are there. Right. We all see what happens when, when bitcoin dumps. Right.
00:01:13.804 - 00:01:41.268, Speaker A: The rest of the market tends to follow. So. But that's just a short term for now. And I don't expect this to be anything like the bear market. As I said yesterday, I still think we're in this, this bull market, and I still think we have a ways to go from here. Speaking of, I guess mark the market and things that can affect it, we had this really insane news come out just a couple of hours ago that the block put out. So they put out an article that stated that the chinese police have seized $4.2
00:01:41.268 - 00:02:13.974, Speaker A: billion worth of crypto from the plus token ponzi. So for those who don't know, this is a pretty big ponzi. This is actually, some people think that this Ponzi was responsible for the 2019 run up we saw in bitcoin and ether where, where bitcoin went to. I think it was like, you know, 14k or something like that. And ether went to the high three hundred s. And then, you know, through some on chain analysis, people actually saw that, you know, the timing was, was, was, you know, matched up sort of thing. So, you know, I haven't looked into that lately.
00:02:13.974 - 00:02:33.994, Speaker A: But, you know, considering the. The kind of. The amounts that were sent to this ponzi, it is plausible. So you can see here that 1% of all bitcoin, about 200,000 bitcoin, was actually associated with this. Plus token Ponzi, 833,000 ETH, which is 0.73% of the supply. You know, there's a bunch of other coins here as well, like 1.4
00:02:33.994 - 00:03:04.214, Speaker A: million LTC, 27.6 million eos for 6 billion doge, which is actually, I think, like 5% of the total supply of dogecoin, which is quite insane. So, yeah, and, you know, this isn't actually new. I think from. From what I dug into it, we can actually see that this news is in particular, probably not fresh. I think it's actually about six months old. It's just been now confirmed that the chinese police are in.
00:03:04.214 - 00:03:35.560, Speaker A: Are in custody of these assets. I think before it was kind of known because, you know, the funds stopped moving or they were being like, you know, some funds are moving and they're washing through different addresses. You know, you can see here that, you know, this. This person is claiming that the address on ether scan here, you know, one of the addresses associated with them hasn't moved their coins in 140 days, which is. Which is quite a while. So, yeah, still developing story, I think, you know, we don't really have a clear picture here. People think, you know, maybe this will lead to a dump in the prices because the.
00:03:35.560 - 00:04:09.038, Speaker A: The government's just going to offload these coins now. That's not usually how these things work. You know, the queens will either. I mean, the way it works in the US is that when this property is seized from criminals, it is auctioned off in kind of private auctions on secondary markets. This is actually how investor Tim Draper, for those who of you who know him, how he got access to a large chunk of bitcoin back in the day, and just recently we saw that the Silk Road bitcoin is going to be auctioned off in the same way. I'm not sure how it works in China. It's probably totally different, given it's China, but definitely will keep a.
00:04:09.038 - 00:04:31.662, Speaker A: Keep an eye on this and see how it's going and see how it evolves. Next up was. So we obviously spoke about this yesterday about how there was the. The compound liquidations of over $100 million due to the die price going to $1.30. On Coinbase. So there was actually a lot of discussion around this on Twitter today. It was kind of hard to follow a lot of back and forth.
00:04:31.662 - 00:05:07.544, Speaker A: We had everyone's favorite green frog chain link God in a lot of the threads because, you know, this was an oracle issue, right, where the Oracle reported this, this kind of number that it shouldn't have been able to report to compound. You know, it functioned as it should have, but, you know, there should be kind of like an aggregate feed that gets fed over the price so that it doesn't, doesn't just come up as a dollar 30. Right. You know, you could have ten different feeds. And if nine of them, say, dies $1.01, one of them says it dies 30, it'll take that into account and kind of like average out the price. And this is what maker does with their oracles.
00:05:07.544 - 00:05:42.780, Speaker A: And this is what Chainlink does, of course, as well. So, you know, we had Robert Leshner put out a kind of tweet about it. And there's a, there's actually a blog post here. Not a blog post, sorry, a forum post where they went through what happened with, with compounds, oracle, and did some analysis here. So I'll leave the link to that in the description on, on YouTube if you want to go check that out. Same with all the other things I'm talking about today. You know, and then Robert Leshner, who's the CEO of Compound and the founder of Compound, for those who don't know, he went on to say that only 124 out of 225,000 users were impacted.
00:05:42.780 - 00:06:11.552, Speaker A: There weren't any under collateralized accounts, and all the markets seem healthy now. I mean, I get that, but at the same time, I think what he's doing is he's using ethereum addresses as a proxy for users here, which I don't think is very accurate. We saw the volume that was liquidated. Right. I think in Defi, what matters more than anything is volume and liquidity more than individual users. This is a pretty big blow. You know, as I mentioned yesterday, there was one address that got hit for 40 or $50 million.
00:06:11.552 - 00:06:41.128, Speaker A: And it actually turns out that that address might belong to Celsius, the centralized lending platform. You know, I don't know that for sure, but from my investigations and talking to a few people, it seems like that's the case. Case. So, yeah, as I said, chain link God, who's a, who's a huge chain link advocate on Twitter. You've, you've definitely seen him. If you're on Twitter, he's, you know, he was on the, on the attack today about oracles. He went after basically, you know, compounds, oracle, uniswap's, you know, Oracle.
00:06:41.128 - 00:07:01.698, Speaker A: I mean, we'll using Uniswap as an oracle, for example. And basically saying that, you know, rolling your own oracle solution is, is not the best thing to do. You should just use, you know, standards that we already have, like chain link and things like that. Now, you know, I tend to agree with him. I, I'm one of those people who actually think that Chainlink is, is great. It's a great project. I think what they're doing is really important.
00:07:01.698 - 00:07:55.344, Speaker A: You know, oracles in DeFi are extremely important. You want a strong oracle for exactly this reason. You want the prices to be reported correctly because if they're not, you can have these things happening within different DeFi protocols that are, that are quite, you know, not, not expected, basically. So, yeah, I mean, I expected this from Chainlink God actually said to one of my friends yesterday, I'm like, I can't wait for Chainlink God to see this because he's going to go on the attack because he'd actually been warning about this for weeks with compound basically saying, you know what? The oracles that compound uses aren't great and they are not going to function as expected. And, you know, he was, he was right. Credit where it's due. There was another kind of person on Twitter called Defi God, kind of, you know, putting out his thoughts here, saying that he's very angry over these liquidations because they could have been avoided, you know, by not using just Coinbase's price feed and using chain links, oracles and things like that.
00:07:55.344 - 00:08:26.622, Speaker A: And again, I agree with this to an extent. I really think that if you've got a Defi app out there and you need an oracle, which pretty much all of them do, you should, you should seriously consider Chainlink. And I'm not saying this because I have, you know, I own link bags or anything like that. I actually don't own any link. I just think that you, after seeing what's been happening in this space and how important oracles are, you know, and how I've actually interacted with the Chainlink team myself a lot as well. I know them, you know, I've spoken to them as part of my role at set. I trust them.
00:08:26.622 - 00:09:09.696, Speaker A: And, you know, you might get turned off because of the link Marines on Twitter or whatever, but that's just an unaffiliated kind of like, I guess you would call them army of people that obviously, you know, made some money on link and are really excited about the project because of that. But that doesn't take away from the merits of the project. The project is sound, it works. I actually speak to people running nodes and it works really well. So yeah, when you think about that and you take that in consideration, you know, I can, I can see their point of view here. You know, Hayden also put out a tweet about oracles too, and he said that from, from what he heard, the compound liquidations would have been much worse without the addition of the Uniswap protocol. Twap compound oracle.
00:09:09.696 - 00:09:52.878, Speaker A: So what team stands for is time weighted average price. So what this does is it basically averages out the price of an asset over trading pair, basically, and uses that as the oracle price. I'm not sure exactly how Uniswap does it, but that's generally how it works. He goes on to explain that while the Uniswap oracle price spiked. Sorry. While the Coinbase oracle price spiked, Uniswap's price did not increase much, causing the most extreme prices to be, to be rejected. And of course there was some discussions around, you know, from Chainlink God again, and saying that, you know, using Uniswap as a price, Oracle is not the greatest way, the greatest thing to do.
00:09:52.878 - 00:10:56.864, Speaker A: It's an insufficient solution when you want to secure real value and things like that. Now there's a bunch of other discussions in this thread, I'll link it definitely in the YouTube description as well for you to check out. Won't go, won't go into it all. Today there was an interesting post on the ETH research forum from his username Mkal McKaylin. Sorry, I'm here talking about an executable beacon chain, and this is part of the ETH one to ETH two transition. So it actually gets quite technical here, but the TLTLDR is that he's proposing an 8th two execution model that's alternative to the executable shards with support for single execution thread enshrined in the beacon chain. Now, as I said, this is very technical, but this is actually quite an important post and quite an important thing to think about because as I said, it plays directly into the ETH one to ETH two transition, which is in my opinion, you know, we have phase zero going alive with the beacon chain, which kick starts the ETH two chain.
00:10:56.864 - 00:11:27.064, Speaker A: That is probably the most important. But I think the ETH one to e two transition is, is pretty much just as important. It's going to be just as big of a deal if not a bigger deal, because we get to basically get rid of proof of work and, you know, use proof of stake for ETH one as well now. So yeah, go have a read of this if you're into the more technical things. I'm not going to try and, you know, describe it here because as I said, it gets very technical and there's a lot of discussions underneath here as well. So as I said, I'll link the post in the description. You can go check that out.
00:11:27.064 - 00:11:55.244, Speaker A: So for all our budding ETH two validators. So if everyone's looking to, to stake on ETH two, you've got your Ethan to the deposit contract. You need to set up your validators. Now, there are some amazing guys that have been put out by summer Esat here, I'll link this. It's on his medium anyway. So he's got three guides so far, with the fourth one coming out soon. Basically he's got the guide to staking with ETH two for the lighthouse client from Sigma prime.
00:11:55.244 - 00:12:28.424, Speaker A: He's got the one for Nimbus from status, and he's got one from, for Tecu from consensus. And then he'll obviously, he's obviously going to have one from prismatic labs for, for prism. So these guys are quite detailed. Like I think they're about 20 minutes read each. And he goes like in depth, basically, like really in depth from zero to 32, 32 ETH basically staking. And he explained, you know, he's got all these amazing diagrams here. He's got a ton of different things here, like step by step, each step you need to take to get this all set up right.
00:12:28.424 - 00:12:50.606, Speaker A: All the commands you have to type in, everything like that. So if you, if you are stuck at all in your journey to setting up a validator, right, and you don't understand what some of this stuff is, I highly recommend checking these guides out and giving them a read. They will help you a lot. And as I said, he's got them for the three major clients and he'll have it for the fourth one soon. Maybe he has it now if I refresh the page here. Yes, he does. Okay.
00:12:50.606 - 00:13:09.878, Speaker A: That was published 3 hours ago. I hadn't refreshed yet. So he has the prism one as well. So whatever client you're running on ETH two, he's got a guide for it. So definitely go check that one out. And speaking of ETH two staking as well, dap node has a mainnet package that's ready. It's basically their prism package is ready now, so you can go check that out as well.
00:13:09.878 - 00:13:55.998, Speaker A: For those who don't know, Dap node is basically an operating system that you can run on your hardware that lets you basically easily set up different nodes and different kind of like infrastructure for Ethereum and for other networks as well. So you can set up like, ETH one nodes and now ETH two nodes. I used them a lot for the ETH two testnets and it was seamless. It was really great. So, yeah, definitely go check that one out as well. All right, so another bit of news that came out that, you know, I hadn't heard about this project for a while, but basically there's a report that Facebook's Libra could launch its first stable coin in January, which is a lot sooner than what I, what I kind of figured. You know, we first heard about Libra like a few months ago, and everyone was just like, wow, Facebook's gonna like, you know, kill the game here.
00:13:55.998 - 00:14:27.950, Speaker A: But then what ended up happening was that the regulators and I guess, like, especially in the US, were like, you know, they're not very fond of Facebook. Facebook doesn't have a very good reputation with regulators. So when they announced this, the regulators were like, oh, no, we can't let Facebook issue their own currency. This is, you know, this is not on which, you know, for better or worse is what it was. So, you know, then they had people pull out of, of the Libra association and things like that. You know, they had a bit of a bumpy start there, but it seems like they're still chugging along and they want to. To get this out there as soon as January.
00:14:27.950 - 00:14:46.440, Speaker A: So, yeah, we're going to keep an eye on that. There's not much meat in this article here. I think it's just an announcement. This is going to be kind of coming in January, so, you know, we'll see what happens. January is only two months away, so much sooner than I expected. All right. The last thing I wanted to talk about was.
00:14:46.440 - 00:15:37.976, Speaker A: So for those who don't know, the centralized exchange, OKX had paused their withdrawals for quite a while, so no one could get their crypto out of the exchange. And this was due to one of the co founders being questioned by police. There was a ton of fud around this. There was like, you know, he's under arrest, like, he's going to jail or everyone's coins are lost, you know, the usual, the typical stuff. But they actually resumed withdrawals yesterday and they've seen quite a big outflow of bitcoin, specifically almost 30,000 bitcoin has left the exchange. And we saw the same thing happened when the BitMex founders were charged and a few of them were arrested where the withdrawals still went through. They weren't, they weren't paused, but there was like a withdrawal window that they missed because bitbacks only does withdrawals like once a day and actually doing do them more frequently now.
00:15:37.976 - 00:16:14.298, Speaker A: But what ended up happening was that, you know, we had a ton of BTC flow out of Bitmex because of this. And it's only natural, right? I mean, I personally, if I was using a centralized exchange and then this was happening with it, I wouldn't keep my coins there. If I could get them out. Like, why would you? So, yeah, I mean, just seeing this chart from glass node here showing it being a pretty huge withdrawal from OKX, which is one of the bigger centralized exchanges, it doesn't really come as a surprise to me. What's, what's more surprising, there's still 212,000 bitcoin in there. Like, as I said, I. If anything like this goes on, I would be getting my coins out.
00:16:14.298 - 00:16:39.886, Speaker A: And, you know, this is why. Exactly. Why I don't even use these exchanges anymore is because they have this risk associated with them. You know, when you're using decentralized finance protocols, especially something like uniswap, like an exchange protocol that's fully decentralized, you know, no one can, can take your funds here, right? So, yeah, I don't know. Tons of people still use centralized solutions, and that's fine. It's just not my. Not my cup of tea, for sure, but, yeah, so.
00:16:39.886 - 00:17:05.122, Speaker A: And in general, I think for those who follow and who like to follow on chain stats and on chain data, I actually wrote about this in the daily way today as well. On chain data is like, really rich, right? Because we've got no base layer privacy. You can get like a ton of insights from it. And one of my favorite websites to actually go on is glass node. So they have this amazing studio on here. So studio dot glassnode.com for those listening on the podcast.
00:17:05.122 - 00:17:42.124, Speaker A: You won't be able to see it, but I'm just quickly showing it here. You can see here they've got metrics for, like, you know, new addresses, active addresses, addresses with balance over a certain amount. So if an account has more than $10 of bitcoin or ether in it, they show you that. And these insights can, can kind of, like, let you see, you know, if we're in a bull market, if we're in a bear market. Is there going to be a price move? There's tons of info here. Now, I will say that, you know, there are, most of the best insights are behind, you know, subscriptions. You have to pay a subscription, you know, this isn't an advertisement or promotion for them by any means, but they have a few free insights you can go check out as well.
00:17:42.124 - 00:18:02.580, Speaker A: And they're not the only data kind of provider as well. They've got coin metrics, you know, into the block. There's, there's a bunch of others like this. There's actually a lot now out there that I, that I tend to use and they're just super interesting to look at. So definitely go check that, those things out. Alright, that's it for, for this episode, everyone. Thank you again for listening.
00:18:02.580 - 00:18:27.164, Speaker A: We'll be back next Monday to go through all the news that happens over the weekend. Of course, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast, the YouTube channel and the newsletter, and, you know, and, and follow on Twitter and join the discord. We'd love to get some, some more conversations going in the discord. If you need help with anything, be sure, sure to join.
