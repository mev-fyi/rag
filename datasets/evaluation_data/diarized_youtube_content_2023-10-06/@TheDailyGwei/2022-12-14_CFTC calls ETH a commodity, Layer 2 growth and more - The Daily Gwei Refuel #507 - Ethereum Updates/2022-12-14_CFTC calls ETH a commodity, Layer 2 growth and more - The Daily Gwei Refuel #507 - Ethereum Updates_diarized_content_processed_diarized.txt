00:00:00.160 - 00:00:40.342, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Deli Gray refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Dan and his Asano, and today's the 14 December 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So we saw some new charges be brought against SPF from their CFTC after I put out yesterday's refuel, but I don't want to talk about the charges specifically. I think at this point we've all seen the threads, we've all seen the information about it. We know that he's pretty much going to go to jail for a very long time. I found guilty here, which, I mean, shouldn't be too hard to prove, right? But there was a part of the series document that actually specifically calls ETH a quote unquote digital commodity, alongside bitcoin, tether and others.
00:00:40.342 - 00:01:31.614, Speaker A: Now of course, tether is a weird, I guess, addition there, considering that tether is a currency. But there are arguments to be made, and there were some people kind of making arguments in the replies about how tether, it can be considered a commodity and currencies can be considered commodities as well. And then the end others kind of category here, we don't know what they mean by and others, and obviously they've just said and others as a, as a way to just put that in there without specifically naming anything. But this is funny because I was talking about the other day about how like, there's a lot of fud around ETH being labeled a security and how it looks like a security and acts like a security when in reality it acts and looks much more like a commodity. Money, right? You know, ETH is used as money within the Ethereum economy. It's used as a, as a commodity within the Ethereum network to pay for gas, right? There is no central body that manages Ethereum. Ethereum is decentralized, so that means there's no central body that manages ETH.
00:01:31.614 - 00:02:11.186, Speaker A: And, and people always make up the silliest arguments that say, oh, vitality controls the chain or consensus controls the chain or the Ethereum foundation controls it. When we know the reality of the, of the matter is that no one controls Ethereum. Ethereum, he has a decentralized governance process to get any changes into the network. And there's been countless examples of things that haven't happened in Ethereum, even though people wanted them to happen just because it needs to go through the governance process. They can't just be a unilateral thing that happens on the network. And one example that I always go back to regarding that topic is EIP 999. Now, for those of you who haven't been around for that long, you won't know what Eiple nine is, but basically a bit of, a bit of context around this.
00:02:11.186 - 00:02:45.754, Speaker A: So in 2017, slash 18, there were two bugs with the Multisig smart contract created by parity. Now, parity had been in the Ethereum ecosystem for quite a while. They're a separate company to the Ethereum foundation in consensus, and they were building the parity ethereum client, and they also had this popular multisig. Now, the first bug happened, it wasn't that bad. There was a white hat operation that happened, and then it was all good and people kept using the, the multi sig. But then the second bug happened and basically froze all the funds in that multi sig. And of course, after that happened, the multi sig was shut down.
00:02:45.754 - 00:03:09.120, Speaker A: But there was an EIP that was submitted called Eiple nine to basically rescue those funds. Now, the reason why the funds got frozen is because there was a library on chain that essentially got deleted. It's actually pretty infamous in the community, in the Ethereum community. Someone went on GitHub and said, oops, I accidentally deleted it. But that's a bit of a meme around it. But it was a lot of ETH. It was hundreds of thousands of ETH.
00:03:09.120 - 00:03:52.552, Speaker A: I believe maybe it was half a million ETH, if I remember correctly, and that still stuck to this day. But there was this EIP that someone came up with as a recovery EIP. I think it was a core developer that came up with this as well from parody Afri, who's still around today, does a lot of work on test nets. But yeah, that AIP came along and they were like, you know, why don't we just do this? Because we can see, you know, where the funds are, we can see what we have to do to fix this and to give people their funds back. Uh, let's just do this. And then obviously it didn't go through, but the whole reason why it didn't go through was because, well, it's a slippery slope, right? Like, if we do fund recovery for this, what's to say we can't do fund recovery for other things in the future, other exploits and other hacks? So it was decided by the community that we wouldn't do it. And it was never even on the table to begin with.
00:03:52.552 - 00:04:29.586, Speaker A: It was just an, I mean, anyone could submit Erp's for anything, but it wasn't being seriously considered at all. And I think that just shows, and this was back like in I think, 2018, right? Like quite a while ago now. Um, but I think that just shows that Ethereum really is, is very decentralized. There is even, even for uh, things that happen. Um, and a bit of context that I didn't add here is that parity's company was co founded by Gavin Wood, who's a co founder of Ethereum, obviously working on Polkadot now. But we didn't do anything even though that was, you know, obviously going to benefit Gavin Wood, who's a co founder of Ethereum. So not even a co founder of Ethereum has, has power over the network.
00:04:29.586 - 00:05:04.764, Speaker A: And I don't even believe that if the EIP came from Vitalik, it would have had any diff, it would have made any difference at all. People would have been like, you know, this doesn't make sense for all the reasons I just outlined. So we're not going to do it. So, yeah, as I said, like, none of the arguments that either security makes any sense to me, I firmly do believe ETH is a commodity money. And the CFTC has reiterated their stance here, saying that ETH isn't, that they're calling ETH a digital commodity. Now the problem with statements like this is that they're not binding, right? They're not legally binding. The SEC can come out and say, well, we think ETH is a security and the CFTC can say, okay, well, we think ETH is digital commodity.
00:05:04.764 - 00:05:47.826, Speaker A: But I mean, they're both, I guess, like playing their hand here, vying for, I guess, regulatory control over ETH in, at least in the US. Now I'm not familiar with the entire process here, but eventually one of these bodies gets control given to them. I don't know how that works specifically, but that's what they're doing now. They're vying for control here. Obviously, I would like to see the CFTC be the one that is, that handles regulation of ETH in the US, because that means that the, that ETH would be considered a commodity and not a security. But until the US puts in place a proper crypto regulatory framework, we're going to keep having those, these question marks pop up in saying that I don't think ETH is going to be officially labeled a security. I just, I put a pretty much 0% chance on that.
00:05:47.826 - 00:06:18.298, Speaker A: Obviously anything is possible, but, but I personally put a 0% chance on that. And as I said, the arguments make much more sense for ETH to be a digital commodity money, rather than a security. All right, moving on to a slew of L2 updates from today. So first off, we start with EIP 4844 and the latest implementer call notes from Terrence, who's at prior labs here. So basically he put together a little thread here about what was discussed on the call. It's not too long. I just wanted to highlight this for you guys to go check out.
00:06:18.298 - 00:06:44.998, Speaker A: Obviously work continues on 48, 44, even though it's not going to be in the Shanghai update. And the latest implementers call is summarized here by Terrence for you. Now, moving on to the L2s themselves. So we have two charts here that I want to focus on. One of them comes from Michael Silberling, who works at optimism, showing that optimism achieved an all time high in daily transactions today. Basically. And you can see here on the chart that it's over half a million transactions on the day there.
00:06:44.998 - 00:07:25.012, Speaker A: And as I've been saying, L2's continue to grow in this bear market. You can see on this chart. I mean, the hilarious thing about this is that the growth since the bottom or since, since ETH bottom in June at 880 has just been up only really. I mean, it just keeps going, right? And the bear mark, I mean it's grown more in the bear market by far than it grew in the bull market. But that's, and that's simply because I think the return to quality, the ecosystems building themselves out, obviously it's how long it to bake because I mean, for the, for the most of the bull market, optimism, or for at least a partial part of it, optimism wasn't really live in a public capacity. But, but now that it is, we're seeing this happen here. Now, a related chart was one here.
00:07:25.012 - 00:08:02.436, Speaker A: Posted by M. Hokkala so salo on Twitter showing the daily transactions on both arbitrum and optimism are very close to flipping ethereum l one right now. And you can see in the chart here what this looks like. Now, I've discussed before how ethereum l one is obviously limited by a hard gas limit that it has on the network. That that kind of, I guess, like governs how many transactions can be included in the network per day. And depending on the transaction types, I mean, there's a theoretical limit of the transactions that can be included, but normally it hovers between a million and 1.5 million per day.
00:08:02.436 - 00:08:33.800, Speaker A: Just depending on what types of transactions, depending on the, I guess, like the market action. Well, as you can see here, optimism, which can handle more transactions per day, are almost up to flipping Ethereum here. And then once they flip a theorem, they're going to keep going. I don't know exactly how many opportunism together can handle per day, but that it can definitely handle more than Ethereum. And then obviously what happens when they reach their limit is the same thing that happens on Ethereum, where the fees start going up. And that's really the only way to do congestion control on a blockchain. I don't think you like.
00:08:33.800 - 00:09:31.130, Speaker A: I really don't agree with doing things like dropping transactions or doing kind of, I guess, quality of service on blockchains. I more like, I more so agree with doing the control around fees, right. And making it so that if once you reach the limit, the fees control the demand, rather than doing some quality of service, I guess like load balancing stuff which lends itself to potential censorship vectors there. But I guess that's an orthogonal discussion to, to this in particular. But I mean, yeah, we can see that these L2s continue to grow in this bear market, which I think is extremely positive. Now one thing I did want to say about these things is that something that's been, I've been seeing a lot more people talk about on Twitter lately, and I'm kind of glad they are, is that I, and I've mentioned this on the refill plenty of times, but basically both arbitrary and optimism right now are very, very centralized. And I would actually argue that they're more centralized than most of, or at least some of the alt l one s out there.
00:09:31.130 - 00:10:01.016, Speaker A: Now this is of course because they're in their beta training wheel stages. They either don't have fraud proofs enabled or they don't have permissionless fraud proof enabled. They have multi sig upgrade keys, you know, they can just upgrade the network to do whatever their bridges are behind the multisig of course. And obviously that is, can be used for nefarious purposes. Not that it would be, not that I think it would be, but it could be right? So it's always good to keep that in mind. I mean personally, that's a big reason why I haven't actually put a lot of my funds on these things. I can definitely play around with them.
00:10:01.016 - 00:10:25.712, Speaker A: I do, you know, a healthy amount of activity on these networks. But majority of my funds are still on Ethereum layer one. And of course most of my ETH is in staking. But other, any other things, I just prefer to keep them on layer one. And obviously it's easy to do that, easier to do that when fees are low. You know, I. It's funny, I always talk about fees on layer one, how they're obviously very volatile and depending on how much money you have, you don't care about them.
00:10:25.712 - 00:10:51.000, Speaker A: But, like, generally, like, even for me, I don't want to be paying a $100 fee if I don't have to. Like, it doesn't matter how much money people have or how much eat someone has. I'd rather not be burning more, Ethan. I have to, so to speak. I know that obviously it literally does get burned, but I'd rather keep the, keep the ETH. Right. So I think right now it's just easier to be on layer one, you know? And it's surprising to see the L2s grow so much, considering that layer one fees are kind of low here.
00:10:51.000 - 00:11:26.752, Speaker A: But I think that L2s, it's not just the fees, it's also the speed of the transactions, the ecosystems that they're developing, which just aren't available on layer one. A lot of these apps, it's also the potential to be early to things, of course. And on top of that, it's got to do with, I think once you've bridged over, you don't really want to go back to layer one, go back to slow, more expensive transactions. Right. So you stay on L2 and kind of enjoy what's on there, especially if you can do everything that you could do on layer one anyway. And no one wants to be spending, you know, a crap ton on fees and giving up all their, their hard earned ETH to do that. Right.
00:11:26.752 - 00:11:52.742, Speaker A: But, yeah. Cool to see the growth here. And thank you to Michael. And I think this, his name is Michael as well here, for, for sharing this. All right, so Slingshot announced today that one year after launching on Arbitrum, Slingshot has become the largest Dex aggregator by retail market share. And you can check out their growth journey on Arbitrum in their latest blog post. So this still comes with, sorry sticks with the theme of arbitrum.
00:11:52.742 - 00:12:16.580, Speaker A: And L2 is generally growing here. And you can see slingshots growth as a Dex aggregator on Arbitrum. And you can also see a bunch of nicer charts through these blog posts as well. I think the charts are on the Twitter thread too. Yeah, you can see that number of active wallets using slingshot on arbitrum was only, I believe, 7000 or 700. No, 7000 in November of 2021. Now it's at.
00:12:16.580 - 00:12:28.076, Speaker A: No, no, it was, it wasn't 7000. It was 700. I don't know why they wrote 0.7k like that at 700. Wallets. Now it's 56,000 wallets, which is an 80 times growth in one year. And these are active wallets as well.
00:12:28.076 - 00:12:49.644, Speaker A: They're not just wallets that touch once. And that's it. And this is a total of 126,000 wallets. Swapped $264 million on arbitrum, on slingshot. So very cool to see this growth on slingshot. As you guys know, I am an investor in them, so of course I'm going to disclose that there. But I think, as I said, it speaks to the growth that we're seeing on the L2 side, especially on arbitrum and optimism.
00:12:49.644 - 00:13:25.818, Speaker A: All right, shifting gears here a little bit, but staying on the L2 theme, we have a blog post from scroll today talking about zero knowledge proofs and how they have a big bottleneck, which is proof generation, which is slow and expensive. So why is proof generation slowers, expense and expensive? Can it be accelerated? And you can learn all about proof generation in their new technical blog post here. So as I, as they said, it is technical. It's actually very technical. I mean, if you don't know what these things are in front of me, these kind of like math mathematical equations here, then the blog post is probably going to be gibberish to you. 100% gibberish to me. I can't read this and make sense of it myself.
00:13:25.818 - 00:14:09.138, Speaker A: I was so bad at math. It's cool, that's for sure. But if you are into this stuff and you are a technical person, I highly recommend giving this, giving this kind of blog post a read to be able to get a grip on these sorts of things. And I've talked about, I guess, like proof generation times before and how it's slow and expensive right now on zks. And that's why zks are kind of like, well, I guess like depending on what you do with ZK tech, it can be more expensive, more slow and expensive than even layer one, especially when you start doing privacy stuff. But in saying that these costs are going to come down over time, there are companies working on specialized hardware, as I've talked about before, like in Ganyama, that are working on specialized hardware to get these costs down. And it's not just hardware, it's a lot of the software improvements that are coming down the pipeline as well.
00:14:09.138 - 00:14:47.748, Speaker A: There is a huge vested interest from all these ZK teams to get these proof generation down as much as possible. And in saying that, you know, people will sometimes ask, you know, what's to say that they're actually going to get this proof generation cost down. Like, you know, why hasn't been, why hasn't it been brought down, you know, already? Well, it's because people knew about ZK stuff for, for decades, right? Like zero knowledge proofs is not something new. But it's always been in the theoretical realm. It hasn't really had a practical application. Well, obviously with blockchains, with, with ZK tech for L2s and beyond, it has a lot of practical applications. So now there is a reason to bring these costs down.
00:14:47.748 - 00:15:36.260, Speaker A: There is a reason to work on these sorts of stuff. And there is a shit ton of money, billions of dollars at this point, right, going into this, this stuff across everything as software, hardware, ecosystem, development, community stuff, which all kind of culminates in making it, making this technology better. So yeah, anyway, you can go give this blog post a read here from scroll. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, so finally, up here on the Lita Lee Tay L2 topic here, we have consensus announcing the private beta release of their ZKe EVM test, which is available on Infuria here. So I've talked about consensus doing their own ZKVM before, but this kind of came out of nowhere. It's funny, consensus a few months ago, it's actually quite a while ago now, and I believe I covered it on the refuel.
00:15:36.260 - 00:16:24.120, Speaker A: They launched something called Palm, which was a sidechain or an EVM side chain for nfts. And I think I discussed it when I talked about it originally that I didn't understand why they did this. I mean, a EVM side chain in the era of L2s doesn't, you know, in 2022 doesn't really make sense, especially something specialized for nfts when we already have like L2s that are doing that like immutable x. So I thought that was weird. And it doesn't seem like that palm side chain has really gone anywhere. So it's really great to see that consensus is actually bringing out a ZKVM because they must see the writing on the wall. They must see that L2s are the future, right? I mean, I hope they do, considering that they're such a big part of the Ethereum ecosystem and they actually developing towards that with their own AVM, which has now entered private beta and the private beta testnet.
00:16:24.120 - 00:16:58.724, Speaker A: So if you go to this blog post as a form on the right hand side here that you can fill out, which you can do. So I'll link it in the YouTube description below, but very much love to see that consensus. Such a big organization is throwing their weight behind ZKVM. I mean, it's just another sing signal that ZKVM is the future. And I've talked about why a million times before, but I think if you're betting on the L2 future, you're pretty much like all in on EVM right now. Not just ZkvM, but just EvM in general at L2. And then taking that a step further, you're definitely all in on the ZKVM vision as well.
00:16:58.724 - 00:17:20.753, Speaker A: And there's different types of ZKVM. I believe there's three or four types of them that I've discussed before and different projects are tackling different types. I mean, Taiko is tackling type one, I believe scroll is tackling type two, type three. I think Polygon is tackling. I might be wrong there. It's kind of hard to keep track of it all. I'm not sure what type consensus is tackling, but obviously they would fit into one of those categories there.
00:17:20.753 - 00:17:39.649, Speaker A: But we're coming at it from all sides. It was thought ZkVM was fire, you know, five years away, just. Just a year ago. Well, it seems like it's not even, you know, I guess like a year away at this point. It's mere months away. So very cool to see a consensus getting into the game here. All right, moving on to other updates from today.
00:17:39.649 - 00:18:10.466, Speaker A: So Partydao introduced the all new party bid today, which is an. Which is. Which they're calling an on chain multiplayer for nfts. Parties can now do anything together as a group coordinated on chain, and it's now live at Partybid app. So what does this new party bid do? Well, it brings multiplayer functionality to the entire ecosystem of nfTs. So you can buy or crowdfund to buy an NFT as a group. You can take actions together on chain to own and use these nfts and you can, of course, sell the nfts on popular marketplaces as well.
00:18:10.466 - 00:18:42.484, Speaker A: So basically it's a way for groups of any size to come together with a shared goal, as they say here, in order to do something on chain, specifically with nfts here, which I think is very, very cool because I remember this was being done to purchase. I can't remember if it was a crypto punk. I think it was a crypto punk. People would purchase it and then. And then it would get split up amongst them and they had their own tokens that would be able to have a claim on that. And I remember coming covering this on the refill and thinking it was really cool. And well, now with this new party bid, you can basically do this for anything, I don't believe.
00:18:42.484 - 00:19:09.402, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, for any NFT basically. And you can do it any, you can do it as a group or, you know, as a large group or a small group. So very, very cool to see this. And this thread has more information about what exactly this is and how this all works here and a few parties that have already been started. So if you're interested in that sort of stuff, definitely go check this out. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, so something I missed yesterday was a small update from fire here.
00:19:09.402 - 00:19:47.174, Speaker A: They now have Ens resolution live in the app. This was something that was bugging me for a little while I was using fire and I was like, okay, well I'd like to be able to see the enses because I feel like if you're trying to show what a transaction does, it makes sense to show the ens instead of the full Ethereum address. Because obviously the ENS is much easier to read, right, than the full Ethereum address and obviously much easier to verify as well. And you can do your extra verification. I'm pretty, I haven't tested it out myself, but I'm pretty sure you can hover over it and it'll show you the full Ethereum address too. So having both of those things there is obviously very important. But yeah, just generally, as I said, I have been using fire lately.
00:19:47.174 - 00:20:25.786, Speaker A: It's quite good. I think, I think I mentioned this before, but basically there are things that, that fire does that a little bit annoying at times, where it'll keep coming up with something keep coming up with, I guess a pop up for transactions that I do frequently, such as Uniswap trades, which I get why it does that, but still, I wish I could like have an option to mute things for a certain period of time. And also sometimes it doesn't automatically close after I submit the transaction using the metamask UI, which is a bit annoying, but those are just things that can get ironed out. Obviously fire right now is in very early stages, so I'm just nitpicking there. But it's a very great tool. I enjoy using it. I feel safer using it, to be honest.
00:20:25.786 - 00:20:52.048, Speaker A: Then, then, you know, then otherwise, because I can actually see what's happening. So yeah, very cool to say that this small update came out from them today, which is Ans resolution. I mean, they're calling it a small update, but I think it's a pretty big deal, at least personally. But yeah, you can go check out fire for yourself. I'll link this in the YouTube description below if you haven't yet. All right, finally here. I know I'm short on today's episode, but I've got something else I want to talk about after I mention this.
00:20:52.048 - 00:21:20.162, Speaker A: But finally, I announced yesterday on Twitter that I got my flights and accommodation booked for ETH Denver 2023, which is happening in early March. And I asked who's going to be there? This is my first ETH Denver since early 2020. So it's going to have been three years since I. Since I've gone to an ETH Denver here, obviously because of COVID I think it's my first. It is my first time in the US since then as well. And I'm so looking forward to it. I'm going to be there from February 27 to.
00:21:20.162 - 00:21:42.838, Speaker A: To March 8, I think it is when I fly back home. And I'm currently planning. I haven't booked it in yet, but I am planning and I am getting someone to help me with this. A daily Gwei meetup at a bar near the venue, probably before the conference starts. So the main conference days are like the Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I believe. So it'll be on the Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night. And we'll probably have capacity for about 100 people.
00:21:42.838 - 00:22:05.780, Speaker A: But I'll let you guys know more details about that once we confirm it. But, yeah, I'm just so excited. I'm so excited to see as many of you as possible there. I know there's a lot of you in the US that watch the show. So probably, you know, it's more likely you're going to be at East Denver, then maybe another conference that is further away. It's going to be at a new venue. As I've mentioned before, that's much, much bigger than the venues, than the venue that was.
00:22:05.780 - 00:22:25.596, Speaker A: That was done at previous East Denver's and I think it's going to be huge, honestly. I mean, I went to the East Denver in February 2020 when it was like deep Bear market. This was pre defy summer. This was pre, you know, COVID print money printing. This was pre stupid bull market. This was like the. Basically it was the end of the bear at that point, I think.
00:22:25.596 - 00:22:40.692, Speaker A: Right. Even though that a month later the COVID crash happened, it was the end of the bear. But in saying that, the place was packed, there were so many hackers everywhere. I judged the hackathon. There were so many people everywhere. It was crazy. I mean, the venue felt like it was over capacity at that point in time.
00:22:40.692 - 00:23:09.172, Speaker A: And then two years later, obviously, the, the, um, the was done again. And they had three venues this time. Uh, the sports castle, which is the main venue, was just like, absolutely overloaded. And of course, because that was still the, I guess, February 2022. I mean, it wasn't the bull market. It was like the end of the bull market, but still, I think that there are so many people still around, there are so many people that go to the east envelope that it's going to be such a packed event. So I'm very much looking forward to seeing, uh, people there.
00:23:09.172 - 00:23:32.156, Speaker A: If you're going to be there, let me know in the Discord channel. As I said, I'll let you know. Guys know more details once I confirm about that daily meetup. I want to try and get as many of you there as possible. It will be free to attend, but the drinks, you'll have to pay for yourself because just renting out the space is not cheap. I'm not going to pay for drinks for everyone. But, but, yeah, I mean, it's just to meet up to shoot this shit and meet as many of you as possible.
00:23:32.156 - 00:24:09.074, Speaker A: All right, so I got a few minutes left here. I'm going to talk about the markets for a sec. I don't do this often, as you guys know, but when I think it's relevant, I talk about it. So basically, we saw the latest, I guess, inflation numbers come out of the US yesterday and out of the UK today. But I'm going to, I'm just going to focus on the US. So the US numbers basically following the trend that they've been following for the last four to five months, that shows that core inflation has peaked. Now, I've talked about this before and about its effect on the market and how I think that the crypto market basically has front run this by, like, at least six months because, I mean, ETH bottomed in June.
00:24:09.074 - 00:24:35.306, Speaker A: I know bitcoin set a new bottom after the FTX collapse, but ETH bottomed in June, and I'm just going off ETH here. And bitcoin didn't really set, like, too much of a harsh bottom from where it was before. So where its previous bottom was. So generally, I would consider that capitulation event in June to be the bottom, at least at this point in time. So that's about six months ago now. Right. And then we saw that inflation went really high, above 9%, I believe, core inflation.
00:24:35.306 - 00:25:00.930, Speaker A: And then since then, it's been coming down. And if you adjust for an annualized inflation rate, it seems like it's even below the target of 2%. And of course, rates have gone up in that time as well. And people, people are like, okay, when's the Fed going to pivot? You know, when's rates going to stop going up? When are they going to come back down again? All these sorts of stuff. And you guys know that I don't really focus on the macro environment too much. Like, it's not something I really care to focus on. I mean, there's so many, so much bullshit out there, just kind of hard to sift through.
00:25:00.930 - 00:25:37.666, Speaker A: And it's not something that I really care to use my mental cycles on. But the reason I bring it up is because there is the trend of inflation going down. Signs point to it being less because of monetary inflation subsiding and more supply chain inflation. Supply chain related inflation subsiding because obviously because the COVID stuff has diminished or gone away completely for most of the world. The supply side is coming back and there's more. Supply is trickling in the more demand, and there's so many other factors that I could go into. But as I said, like, I was getting to the point here, the reason I bring it up is because of its effect on the markets.
00:25:37.666 - 00:25:56.530, Speaker A: And we saw a little, it wasn't even a big pump. We saw like a little pump on Ethan bitcoin once these numbers were announced. I. It's worth reiterating, these are short, really short term, medium term movements, guys. It doesn't really mean anything. It doesn't mean that the bull market's back on for crypto. It doesn't mean that, you know, necessarily the next year is going to be an amazing year.
00:25:56.530 - 00:26:33.166, Speaker A: It doesn't mean that. Yeah, if he's going to go back to all time high anytime soon or anything like that. But I think what people need to be very aware of is that there are people right now on Twitter pushing something called an echo bubble. Now, what they mean by this is that they think that we're going to have like a mini bubble that echoes parts of the last bull market. And the reason that they saying this is because of 2019, because in 2019 you can go look at what happened to BTC and ETH. They had, I guess you could call it an echo bubble where they both pumped and ETH basically came back down and retraced his entire pump. But BTC ended the year basically at two times what it was.
00:26:33.166 - 00:27:06.994, Speaker A: So if we get the same thing next year, right, you would expect ETH to settle around 2500, say, if ETH doesn't retrace its pump and follows what bitcoin did in 2019, and then I don't know what would happen with bitcoin. Honestly, I don't even pay attention to bitcoin that much. But I'm just talking about ETH here. But in saying that the people pushing this echo bubble narrative, they're looking for exit liquidity. If they're big players, they actually need much more exit liquidity than they have in the past because volumes and liquidity is generally down. And they're not going to hold these positions. They're not long term investors.
00:27:06.994 - 00:27:28.954, Speaker A: They are short term, medium term traders. So I just want to caution you guys against falling for the other side of the narrative, which is the bull narrative, right. Which is getting caught up in the bull narrative thinking that everything's awesome. You know, even if it goes back to above two k, there's. There's. That doesn't signal a start of a new bull market or anything like that. I've said you guys before that I would tell you when I felt like the new bull market was.
00:27:28.954 - 00:27:54.216, Speaker A: Was happening. And I feel like, and I'm gonna just wait till, like, pretty much the last minute until I say that. But I don't think eat going to two k, two five k is something that people should be like, oh, wow. Oh, my God, the bull market's back. You know, we're going back to all time high awesome. And then, you know, throw all your money at it and blow yourselves up. Just be very, very careful, generally, of narratives that are going to perpetuate, because I already see something, see a lot of this happening next year.
00:27:54.216 - 00:28:10.648, Speaker A: Inflation subsiding. It's a new year. People calling for this echo bubble with, you know, season seasonally. If you look at the chart, the beginning of the year is actually very good for crypto generally. Like the. I wouldn't say 100% of the time it happens like that. Like, most of the time it happens like that.
00:28:10.648 - 00:28:34.736, Speaker A: So I just caution against falling into these narrative traps, as I always do. Not to say I'm not bullish long term. Of course I am. But narratives traps in bull markets, sorry, in bear markets can trap. Can wreck you as much as they can wreck you in bull markets as well. So just keep that in mind and hopefully you'll be okay. As, I mean, the number one rule, as always, is that survive in these markets, whether it's bull or bear, just invest for the long term in.
00:28:34.736 - 00:28:57.072, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to invest in. Of course it's up to you. But investing for the long term, in my experience, has been, you know, much better strategy than short term stuff. But in saying that not everything you invest in is going to pay off. So you have to understand that as well. But anyway, none of that, of course, is investment advice. It's just me kind of looking back at my experience with these things, trying to share some of my wisdom with you guys.
00:28:57.072 - 00:29:13.736, Speaker A: And you can listen to me or tell me I'm full of shit. I don't really care, right? But I do want to just put that out there for anyone who wants to take that on board. But on that note, that's going to be it for today. So thank everyone for listening and watching.
