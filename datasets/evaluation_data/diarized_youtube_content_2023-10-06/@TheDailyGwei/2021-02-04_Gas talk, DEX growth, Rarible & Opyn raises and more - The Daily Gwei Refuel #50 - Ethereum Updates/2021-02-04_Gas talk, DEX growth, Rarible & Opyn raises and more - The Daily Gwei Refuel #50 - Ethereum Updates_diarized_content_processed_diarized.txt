00:00:00.520 - 00:00:31.440, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 4 February 2021. Right, everyone, let's get into it. So I think I'm going to start off this episode with a little bit of a rant here. I think, you know, we've all feeling the highest gas fees lately, and I understand it, but I do want to rant a little bit here. So just bear with me and I'll read out my tweet that kind of prompted this today. So I wrote, it really irks me that people act like the high fee issue on Ethereum isn't being solved.
00:00:31.440 - 00:01:06.448, Speaker A: More work is going into a scaling ethereum than ever before, and we have plenty of solutions that are live with more coming every day. We are still early adopters at this stage. Embrace it now, end quote. So the reason I put this out is because obviously the gas fees have been really persistently high lately. You know, every, anytime I really kind of tweet anything, I pretty much get like a few comments about the high gas fees and how, you know, theorem is going to fail and like this chains better and this is better. It's just, it's just really annoying. And this wasn't really directed at those people because I know those people are just like in there, you know, maybe they're just like shilling their bags or whatever.
00:01:06.448 - 00:01:35.008, Speaker A: I don't care about that. What I do care about is people within the ethereum ecosystem maybe not being aware of these things. And kind of that's my job as an educator, is to make them aware of this. So I guess I'll start with saying that, you know, obviously everyone feels the high fees. I feel the high fees, you know, it hurts, right? It's not fun going to uniswap wanting to do like a trade and having to spend $50 in fees, right? That's not fun. It doesn't even matter if you're trading like a few thousand dollars and you can just like eat the cost. It's still not fun.
00:01:35.008 - 00:01:58.100, Speaker A: It's still shocking whenever it happens because you don't expect it to be that high even if you've been around for a while. Right? You know, doing, I guess, head math. Gas fee calculation isn't exactly, you know, something that you normally do. So it's definitely a shock, and I understand that. So I definitely just wanted to start with that. But in saying that this isn't something that isn't being solved right. Like, I have spoken about L2 on the refuel a lot.
00:01:58.100 - 00:02:18.480, Speaker A: I've written about it a lot in the newsletter. Right. I talk about it a lot on Twitter. There are so many solutions going live, so many people working on this problem that, you know, it. I just don't understand, like, the short sightedness here. I really don't. I really don't understand how people, you know, can see all this stuff happening and still think, you know, it's going to fail or needs to hurry up, blah, blah, blah.
00:02:18.480 - 00:02:48.746, Speaker A: Sometimes I think to myself, where people, you know, back when there was dial up Internet, was everyone just saying, you know, and people were probably complaining about dial up Internet and how slow it was. And I get that. Right. But, you know, at the same time, were people basically saying the same things they're saying now, you know, that it's going to die. Let's just go move to a new Internet, right? What, can we. Can we do something better? Maybe they were. Maybe it's just history repeating itself here, but, you know, obviously we weren't stuck on dial up forever, right? We progressed.
00:02:48.746 - 00:03:26.074, Speaker A: The Internet got better and everything like that. And I think, and this goes back to a blog post that I read that actually has informed a lot of my thinking on this. The blog post is called the myth of the infrastructure phase. Now, you can go read it yourself. You just google it. But basically what it says is that infrastructure does not get built before there's demand for it, right? So you can see this play out in real life all the time. A road that is maybe one or two lanes doesn't get extra lanes added to it until it's actually just like, filled with traffic, right? And, you know, there's also the concept of induced demand where you add more lanes and people just fill up the lanes and you have to add another one and so on and so forth.
00:03:26.074 - 00:04:07.776, Speaker A: But the point is, is that no one just builds this kind of infrastructure before there's demand for it. And if you do that, you risk there not being demand for it. Right? So with, with Ethereum and with scaling, no one would be building L2 solutions. If the gas fees weren't high, if the gas fees were still ten way or under, no one would be focused on L2 because there wouldn't be any incentive to focus on L2. There would be no need to do it, right? So. And that what that blog post basically says, it's not about crypto, it's just general. But what it basically says is that the same thing played out with the Internet, right? The same thing plays out across basically all of society is that you do not build infrastructure for demand that you think is going to be there, right.
00:04:07.776 - 00:04:39.632, Speaker A: That's just not how it works. And people aren't incentivized to, people aren't motivated to. The money's not there, you know, to do it, right. So, you know, now that we've hit this kind of limit of Ethereum's kind of scalability and we're getting to a point where it is, you know, pretty ridiculous, right? At this point where the gas fees are so high all the time and we're pricing out so many users and things like that, we needed to do the L2 stuff and that's what we're doing. As I said, we've got so much L2 stuff going live that is live. You know, there's, there's still pain points. As I say on the tweet, we're still early adopters, right? I've said it.
00:04:39.632 - 00:05:35.784, Speaker A: I kind of, I think I've talked about this on the refuel before, how we are early adopters in the sense that there's a, there's an adoption curve. If you google like technology adoption curve or software adoption curve, you can actually see the four stages. So the very first stage is like, you know, I guess the people who come in and they're interested, it's like a hobby for them and, you know, the rest of the world considers it a toy, then you have the early adopters stage, which is the stage that I think we're in, and we're still going to be in for a little while here. And then you have the early majority, the late majority, and the laggards early majority will probably start, you know, kind of creeping in this cycle, I think, in terms of like this bull market cycle. But given that we have a lot of apps now within defi that can be used in bear or bull markets, I think even if we go into another bear market, there's still going to be users flooding in and using these things. So we're going to move into that kind of early from the early adopters to the early majority. But before we can get there, we need to build out this infrastructure.
00:05:35.784 - 00:06:11.408, Speaker A: The early majority cannot use Ethereum in its current state without the scaling solutions being live. So while you're in here now, you are an early adopter. You're not earlier majority if you're using it actively. If you're, you know, even if you're watching this, right, or listening to the refuel, you know, you're, you care enough about this, this tech, and you care enough about the entire ecosystem to pay attention to it. You're an early adopter, and as I've explained before, by being an early adopter, you get to reap all the benefits, right? You get to kind of like plant your flag, so to speak. You know, there's less competition for things. You get to invest in things earlier, right? You get to be at the forefront of stuff.
00:06:11.408 - 00:06:53.876, Speaker A: That's the benefits of being an early adopter. And, you know, think about all the early adopters of bitcoin and ETH, right, as an investment vehicle back in, I guess, you know, bitcoin probably pre, you know, 2015 or whatever, or maybe 2016. And Ethereum, you know, not in around the same kind of area there, right? Those early adopters have been, you know, handsomely rewarded if they held their kind of coins and tokens even till 2017, didn't have enough. Didn't even have to hold it till today. So from that perspective, you know, back then, even, you know, in 2017, we didn't have any of this for Ethereum, that, you know, there was still scalability issues back then because during icos, the gas fees would spike. They'd never go as high as they are now, but they'd spike a lot. And people would be like, this is crazy.
00:06:53.876 - 00:07:22.626, Speaker A: You know, Ethereum is going to buckle under the load. And obviously, we had the cryptokitty stuff and all that sort of stuff. But again, I think back then, you know, we were just in the kind of really early stages of the early adopters and coming out of that very first stage of, like, people just using it as kind of hobby and maybe a toy, so to speak. So from that point of view, I think we're fine. So that's a long winded way. Like, it's long winded way of me saying that. I think, you know, while you're an early adopter, it is.
00:07:22.626 - 00:07:44.984, Speaker A: It is kind of like something you have to deal with. It is not something that's going to be solved. If you want it to be solved, you can come back in a couple years when we solved it. But by that point, you're missing all the fun, right? You're missing all the opportunity, and I don't think that's worth it, personally. I mean, I obviously wouldn't do that, and I wouldn't encourage you to do that because you miss out on a lot of the fun. So, yeah, as I said on the tweet, we're still early adopters. Embrace it.
00:07:44.984 - 00:08:08.246, Speaker A: Make the most of it. And you know, the gas fees hurt, but they're temporary. I truly believe that. I truly believe that most users are going to be sitting on L2. You'll never have to kind of interact with layer one or maybe rarely, and you'll never have to pay those high fees again, because on L2, the fees, we've got much better scalability and the fees are much, much, much less. And we can do so many more things on there. So, yeah, it's coming.
00:08:08.246 - 00:08:28.718, Speaker A: I mean, it's live today, right. But obviously it's live in a limited capacity where you can go use loop rings exchange. Right. Or you can do like synthetic staking or at least the first phase of that. And optimism, very limited, but still there. And it's kind of like a glimpse into the future. So, yeah, definitely kind of, I guess keep an eye on all that's happening and I'll keep you guys updated on that.
00:08:28.718 - 00:09:05.428, Speaker A: And also to this point, Hayden Adams put out a really great tweet today where he said, this might be obvious, but becoming global financial infrastructure is a marathon, not a race. And then he corrected himself and said, not a sprint. So it's a marathon, not a sprint, which, I mean, as I was just saying, right, like, this stuff takes time to build out. This isn't going to just happen overnight and kind of like, we need to do it right. We can't just build this new financial infrastructure in a wrong way where we take shortcuts or we make it centralized or, you know, or we like sacrifice decentralization for scalability. That's why it's taking so long, because you want to do it right. We want to do it right the first time.
00:09:05.428 - 00:09:38.768, Speaker A: We don't want to rush into things. So I'm glad that Hayden put this out because it's great to see community leaders such as him, you know, putting this out and really kind of hitting this home because I think a lot of people expect this stuff to happen overnight and it's just not going to happen. Even in the other kind of competitor chains and competitor ecosystems, they're not going to get to this spot overnight either. They have their own issues to deal with. Yes, maybe they're quote unquote more scalable because they've done something usually sacrificing decentralization, but they have their own issues. They have to bootstrap liquidity. They have to get their network effects up.
00:09:38.768 - 00:09:58.578, Speaker A: They have to bootstrap. A community like that is even harder than what we have to do in Ethereum. So, you know, there is no silver bullet here. There is no one size fits all solution, and it is not happening overnight. I'm telling you right now, we've been working out. I mean, Ethereum has been working at this for six years so far, and it's going to keep, keep going. We're not going to solve this overnight.
00:09:58.578 - 00:10:21.414, Speaker A: So just something to keep in mind there. And on the high gas fee note, Eden from the block put out this tweet today. And I'm glad he put it out because I've been trying to beat the drum on this, basically. But he says, quote, a higher ETH price doesn't necessarily translate to a higher gas fee. Given similar demand, the gas price would likely drop to reflect the ETH price increase. So stop that fud. End quote.
00:10:21.414 - 00:10:59.472, Speaker A: Now, what this is basically saying is that I think a lot of people on the, if you look at gas fees on the surface level, you may think that, you know, the higher the ETH price, the higher the gas fees. That's not how the gas kind of market works or how the fee market works on Ethereum. So the way gas prices are set is that there's two parameters to it, right? There's the. There's GUI, which we all know and love, right? That kid, that is now why it's at 197, I can see on my extension here, right? And that's really expensive. And then you have the gas limit. So the gas limit is basically a limit that you set. And different apps and different interactions on chain require different gas limits because they use different amounts of gas.
00:10:59.472 - 00:12:05.382, Speaker A: So an ETH transfer, for example, only uses 21,000 gas, which is rather cheap, right? But then an interaction with a smart contract could cost 800,000 gas. So that would, you know, that would mean that that interaction is a lot more expensive, and that's why it's much more expensive to trade on uniswap than it is to just send an ETH transaction for an example here. So keeping that in mind now, 100 way, right? Say the gas is 100 kw and the price of ETH is $1,000, right? So that gas fee is going to be the same as if, you know, if the gas fee was 50 Gwei and the ETH price was $1,000 still, right? And the guay price is independent of the ETH price. It doesn't. If ETH goes to $10,000, it doesn't necessarily mean that guy has to go, you know, I guess, what is it from here? Like, not even like seven times or something from here, right? And it doesn't mean the GUI price is going to go up seven times. If, if 100, right? And ETH price is 1000. But then ETH price goes ten times and GUI is still at 100, then yes, the gas cost is going to be ten times more.
00:12:05.382 - 00:12:37.556, Speaker A: But it doesn't matter that the ETH price went up. All that matters is the GwEi price. Because if the great GwEi price was ten, right, but ETH was $10,000, then the transaction would be cheaper than. Sorry. It would be the same if I'm doing my math, then if it was at $1,000, for example. So keeping that in mind as well, I know I might be confusing a little bit here cause I'm trying to do a lot of explanations here very quickly. But what really sets the gray price on the Ethereum network is network demand.
00:12:37.556 - 00:13:30.752, Speaker A: That's it, right? The more people using the network, the more people using the network for more complex transactions like Uniswap trades or compound kind of positions or curve trades or whatever, right? The more the gas is used on the network, the higher the gate price grows because people are trying to outbid each other, right? Cause it's an auction mechanism and that's what kind of dictates the gas price. Now, in saying that the price of ETH obviously has an effect here, because if the price of ETH is in a bull market, if it's going up, right, and if it's volatile, the network usage is going up, especially with Defi, you might notice that every time there's a lot of volatility with the ETH price, gas prices spike really high. You know, they might even double, right? Or even triple. And this is for a few reasons. It's for, if it's going down, right. People are trying to cover their leverage positions that they have on chain. So they're basically getting scared.
00:13:30.752 - 00:14:12.170, Speaker A: And especially if it's going down, for going down really fast, they're getting scared they're going to get liquidated. So they're going to pay whatever they need to in gas fees to get that transaction in. Secondly is if the price is going up or down rapidly as well, there is what's called arbitrage bots between all the decentralized exchanges that will again pay high fees in order to get their arbitrage in because they're going to make a profit on that. On that arb. Now the ARB bots are actually willing to pay up to 99.99% of the entire transaction, right. Profit in fees because they're still making a profit, right? So those are the two main reasons why you see the gas fees spike so much with, with the ETH price kind of being volatile.
00:14:12.170 - 00:14:50.504, Speaker A: But again, that is a secondary effect. The primary effect is network demand. And network demand doesn't just have to be driven by an ETH price increase or decrease. Network demand is driven by so many different things, right? Too many things to even, to even name right now. You know, you could think of like icos back in 2017 as network demand, for example, right? And they did. They did cause the gas prices to spike. And an obvious example that I use with people is that in 2017, when ETH was between $1,000 and $1,400, the gas fees weren't anywhere near expensive as they are today, or were when ETH was at that price, you know, a couple weeks ago or even a week ago at this stage.
00:14:50.504 - 00:15:35.276, Speaker A: It's moving fast today, these days. But, yeah, so my main point is that, yes, the price of ETH has an effect on, on kind of like the demand for the network, but it's only one thing that has an effect. So the primary driver of the gas fees is network demand. And that can be ETH price moving and being volatile. That can be demand for maybe like some hot new ICO or some hot new yield farm or maybe some NFT stuff, right? Or maybe, you know, someone's doing a limited drop NFT like a celebrity, and people are just like rushing to get in. There's a million different ways that the Ethereum network can be used, and that means there's a million different ways that network demand can go up. So I wanted to clear that up for people that might be confused there.
00:15:35.276 - 00:16:34.894, Speaker A: And I think, you know, this, this plays into scaling as well, right, where there's actually ways you can scale things on chain so that the network demand on the main chain. So not L2, on layer one, so that you can actually reduce network demand. And one of those ways, and as Bantag says here, is that you can kind of like use yearn vaults, for an example. So the way this works is that with the yearn vaults, you basically pull the capital together. So it's this concept of pooled capital. And then from that pool, right, you have basically 1000 users that put their capital into that pool, and that pool can do single transactions, and basically all the thousand users get a benefit from that. So you can imagine it like, instead of 1000 users doing their own 1000 transactions to, say, yield farm, right, the yearn vault will take 1000 users capital and only use, and the vault becomes one user, and that one user does transactions for those thousand users.
00:16:34.894 - 00:17:06.690, Speaker A: Right. And that's how it's much, much cheaper because we're pulling all this capital together. That's actually a big part of how we're going to scale on layer one. And we're seeing this play out with not just yearn but balancer. As I explained yesterday with their v two, they're doing pooled capital. I have spoken about this capital efficiency kind of thing in the past where protocols can lend to each other, you know, and trust each other and do zero collateral loans. But the other benefit of that is that pooled capital concept where users can pull their capital to do anything essentially right, in a trustless way.
00:17:06.690 - 00:18:04.576, Speaker A: So I think that's going to be a very big way that we kind of scale as well and is a great way of like kind of pricing in users instead of pricing out users where they'll have access to these opportunities because they're using a pooled capital kind of aggregator instead of doing it on their own, where the gas fees are much, much, kind of more expensive for them. And then they kind of clog the chain as well if, you know, a thousand users are all doing it. So that's just another way that we scale here, which I thought was, was really good that Bantech brought up today. And on the topic of gas fees as well, I put out this tweet today about EIP 1559 going to be seriously changing the entire game for, not for gas fees in particular. I mean, it does, but more so just like the game is everything, right? The game is Ethereum. So I think that it's going to change Ethereum and the way people kind of think about Ethio asset as well. Now the reason I say this is because there's three core advantages to ERP 1559.
00:18:04.576 - 00:18:28.538, Speaker A: There's the UX improvement, right? So it basically makes the fee kind of user experience a lot better for end users. There is the, I mean, there's a side effect of that where it smoothens out the gas fees as well. It doesn't, it's not a scaling solution. Right? It doesn't. It won't reduce gas fees. It won't. It might have a limited effect on the kind of gas fees, but it won't reduce them.
00:18:28.538 - 00:19:13.954, Speaker A: You know, it's not, it's not like it's going to be like AIP 1559 goes in and everything solved. It's not that, right. And then another property is obviously the burning of the ETH, right? So every time there's a transaction, some amount of ETH is burned we, which is what most people are excited about. And then there's a third thing that it does where it can actually act as an on chain oracle gas oracle, which different apps can use to actually estimate how much gas that these apps need to use in the future, rather than trying to guess and outbid each other, which leads to more kind of efficiency on chain with gas. Now, the reason why I say it changes the game is because of those three reasons, like the fact that smart contracts and developers can have an on chain gas oracle is huge. Absolutely massive. That's going to be a big help there.
00:19:13.954 - 00:19:56.912, Speaker A: The UX improvement for end users is also massive. Like, I'm sure that you've all had to speed up a transaction or metamask or replace the nuns on a transaction because it got stuck or whatever, right? We hope that 1559 can help a lot with those issues and smoothen out those issues as well, because the gas prices will be more predictable, which I think is really cool. And then obviously the last thing is the burning of the ETH, right? So every time there is a transaction, the base fee component of ERP 1559 will get burned. So there's two components. The base fee will always get burnt. And then there's a tip on top of that. Once the base fee fills up, which goes to, which still goes to miners, and the tip reverts to, like, the normal mechanism that we have today.
00:19:56.912 - 00:20:37.540, Speaker A: But the base fee is a much better mechanism. It smooths things out. And it also, you know, burns the ethnic, which means that there's deflationary pressure on ETH. Now, that alone is a game changer, right? For me, for the value accrual narrative of ETH, right? Like people always say that ERp 1559 is huge for Ethereum's value accrual. I think it is. But I also think it's huge for the narrative around ETH as an asset, because now you have an asset that, one, you can stake with, right, on ETH. Two, and with that, you can earn protocol rewards and earn an ETH denominated reward and earn fees as well, from the tip, right? When EIp 1559 is implemented, you can use it as trustless collateral.
00:20:37.540 - 00:21:00.720, Speaker A: Within defi, it is the most trustless asset on Ethereum. It is the most liquid, it is the most widely accepted, and it is the safest asset to use on Ethereum. And then three, you have the burning of ETH. So making ETH net deflationary, potentially net deflationary. So from a value accrual perspective, that can't be beat. Right? Right. You can say that.
00:21:00.720 - 00:21:24.936, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. You know, I mean, obviously bitcoiners will say, you know, bitcoin's got a cap supply, it's incredibly scarce, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff. Right? And that's true, right. I mean, it does have a cap supply. It's scarce and everything that's fine. But what is better than a cap supply is a decreasing supply. So what I mean by net deflationary is that we could be burning so many fees one day with 1559 that in proof of stake.
00:21:24.936 - 00:22:05.400, Speaker A: So when we're in ETH two, when I guess ETH one is merging to ETH to get rid of proof of work, the actual protocol issuance is going to go negative. So we will burn more ETH than is issued to stakers each year. So that is better than a cap supply, right? Because that is effectively burning and taking out ETH out of exist, out of existence forever, and that can't be reversed. So that is a huge, huge improvement over, I think, a cap supply. And by doing that, we also guarantee protocol security because we're not relying on fees for protocol security. We're paying out block rewards to stakers in perpetuity. And people will say, oh, that means that ETH doesn't have a cap supply.
00:22:05.400 - 00:22:48.666, Speaker A: You know, it's unlimited inflation. Houses better than fiat, which is just such a surface level. Take that. It just like blows my mind that people still don't understand that with 1559, with the fee burning, with the incredibly low issuance, actually less than 1%, you know, probably on ETH two, we can get to a point where we have a negative issuance, which no one, nothing else can claim at this point in time. And I'm not going to pick on bitcoin or whatever, but I'm using it as an example because bitcoin has the cap supply, which is obviously a very, very big value driver for bitcoin. And it's part of their narrative. But I think once the market and once more people understand the narrative of this, of ethanol, we're going to have like some fireworks.
00:22:48.666 - 00:23:17.942, Speaker A: And I actually think at this point, the market is starting to price that in to some extent, because up until recently, right, ETH was not. I mean, if you actually look back, I think not even 60 days ago, ETH was dollar 700. And ETH's kind of narrative and value accrual was being kind of put out there by a lot of people. I mean, I've been talking about it for ages, but people don't buy it until the price is going up. They don't believe in it until the price is going up. At least most people don't. So I think we're seeing that play out right now, which I thought was.
00:23:17.942 - 00:23:46.162, Speaker A: Was pretty cool. But anyway, I think that's enough about gas for today. I think I'm gonna move on to other things. Actually, one more thing on gas, if you ever want to feel alive, go to fees. WTF? It'll show you the gas fees in dollars of how much you spent over your lifetime of your addresses. And it's quite depressing. So maybe don't go there if you don't want to be depressed by all the fees that you've been, that you've been doing, because you could have done a lot when ETH was $100.
00:23:46.162 - 00:24:22.420, Speaker A: And this will tell you kind of like, what, what it's worth now that ETH is $600, right, which is obviously 16 times more expensive. So it hurts. But anyway, I digress there. So decentralized exchanges had an absolutely massive month last month. I was looking at the Doona analytics dashboard just earlier, and I'll show you in a sec. But basically, decentralized exchange volume was $63 billion in January, and that was, that smashed the all time high of $29 billion set in September. Now, you'll remember that September was peak Defi summer, right? That was unreal.
00:24:22.420 - 00:24:49.294, Speaker A: Like, every defi token was going nuts. You know, there was so much going on on chain gas fees were ridiculous. There were yield farms everywhere, and we just smashed it by more than two times in January, which is, to me, incredibly healthy and just amazing that we've been able to do that. And you can see who here on Doon analytics. And this is one of my favorite dashboards and do not analytics, this Dex metrics dashboard. And I'll link it in the, in the YouTube description for you to check out. But basically, the volume here is intense.
00:24:49.294 - 00:25:09.914, Speaker A: And where I actually track for those, you can see, you can see here this, this does monthly Dex volume grouped by year. You can see that 2019 is not even visible. Right? It's in blue. You can barely see it. 2020, you know, half, the first half of 2020 is kind of like in green and not really doing much there. Then we had it obviously explode here. And now 2021 is in red.
00:25:09.914 - 00:25:26.562, Speaker A: And you can see it just dwarfs the rest of the activity here. And then even on the, on the left hand side, you can see it broken down by protocol. Right. It just dwarfs it again, which is just insane. Like, it's just crazy. Look at, look at this. It's just, it doesn't even, you know, and I think it's just going to keep growing.
00:25:26.562 - 00:26:12.452, Speaker A: Right? And I actually think I did some napkin math before this $63 billion of volume is half the volume that we did for the entire year in 2020, I think. So if we do another $60 billion this month in February, we will have done more volume than we did in the entire year of 2020. That is insane, right? Absolutely insane. And you can see here how they break it down by protocol, that 2021 was actually, sorry, January 2021 was a very big month for sushiswap. You can see pink here is Uniswap, which is obviously kept growing. But then you can also see the purple, which is sushiswap, which has grown a ton since, of, since even like December. So in December, I think Sushiswap did $3 billion of volume.
00:26:12.452 - 00:26:37.124, Speaker A: In January it did $12 billion of volume, which is a four x. Uniswap did 12 billion. Uniswap did 25 billion, which is just a two x. Right. So you can see that other protocols are now coming into it and adding a ton more volume here. And even something like, I think zero x is growing a lot curve as well. I mean, we have a very healthy ecosystem of decentralized exchanges right now, but it's just growing exponentially at this point.
00:26:37.124 - 00:27:04.776, Speaker A: So really, really cool to see that. I'll link this in the YouTube description, this doon analytics page. You can go check that out. So Rarible raised another $1.75 million today from one KX network, Parafy Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Coin Fund, Bollinger Investment Group and others. And for those who don't know, Rarible is an NFT marketplace platform that's been around for a little while now. They kind of got a lot of notoriety during Defi summer.
00:27:04.776 - 00:27:26.832, Speaker A: There was a lot of NFT stuff going on there, but they're picking up again now. They've got like a lot of stuff on there. You can sell, buy and sell a bunch of creators on there as well. So, yeah, really, really cool platform. But yeah, congrats to them on, on this race. I think, you know, I've spoken about power five before, how I thought they're a really great investor. One KX network is really great as well.
00:27:26.832 - 00:27:47.840, Speaker A: Coinbase Ventures, obviously Coin fund is really great. They're not typically a Defi investor. Coin fund focuses on nfts and like web3 stuff from what I've noticed. So it's great to see that sort of stuff. So yeah, congrats to rarible here. And in other investment news, open raised $6.7 million in a series a from paradigm.
00:27:47.840 - 00:28:18.674, Speaker A: I think it was led by paradigm, which means they got other investors on board as well, if I look here. So they had paradigm leading the round with participation from their existing investor, Dragonfly, as well as Synthetix's co founder Kane and Stani from Aave. I mean, they're in every round at this point. It's hilarious as kind of angel investors, but there they are. So, yeah, this is a big round, $6.7 million. I think at this point, it's pretty safe to assume that all of these DeFi protocols are going to be issuing a token sometime soon.
00:28:18.674 - 00:28:38.474, Speaker A: So I think this money will give open the Runway they need to get to, you know, maybe a token launch. This is just speculation. I don't know anything kind of privileged here. And, you know, rarible already has a token, so I didn't say anything about that then. But, yeah, open is one of the most popular defi protocols that doesn't have a token yet. So. Expecting that sometime soon, actually.
00:28:38.474 - 00:29:05.134, Speaker A: So we'll see how that goes there. So Alan put out this picture today of a grayscale investment report. So I actually got this in my inbox today. Grayscale put out this new valuing Ethereum report, and it is incredibly bullish. Absolutely incredibly bullish. And they actually lead with these three dot points about ETH. So ETH as money, ETH as a consumable community, or I think they may be supposed to say commodity.
00:29:05.134 - 00:29:28.532, Speaker A: They're probably a typo. And ETH as a cash generating asset. So I explained before, like, how I thought that there was, like, those three value accrual pillars for Ethan, trustless card or all staking and ERP 1559. But what falls into that as well is Ether's money. That's another value accrual kind of thing. ETH being used to denominate different things. Like the NFT ecosystem actually uses ETH as money more than any other ecosystem.
00:29:28.532 - 00:29:42.662, Speaker A: ETH as a consumable kind of asset. So not community there, but, like commodity. So as gas. Right? Which falls into ERP 1559. And ETH is a cash generating asset. So either trustless collateral or staking. Right? So.
00:29:42.662 - 00:30:12.248, Speaker A: And in this report, they go through all of that. They cite a bunch of different people and a bunch of different people within the community, which I thought was really cool. And for those who don't know, Grayscale is focused on institutional investors. So these are people that are typically pretty noob to the space and they're just getting their feet wet with bitcoin and now they're going to go into Ethereum as well. So, yeah, it's just really bullish to see something like this put out. I wouldn't have imagined to see this in, like, you know, 2018, 2019. I think they put out something similar in 2020.
00:30:12.248 - 00:30:52.358, Speaker A: But, yeah, seeing this kind of stuff just as, like, commonplace now where people saying ETH is money, you know, it's, it's a commodity and it's a cash generating asset is really, really bullish. So, yeah, good on grayscale for putting this out there. So the index co op put out their monthly update today. And what I found interesting about this was that the DeFI pulse index has, over the last three months, has actually outperformed both BTC and DeFi. Now, for those who don't know, the DeFI Pulse Index is an index of DeFi tokens, as the name suggests. And obviously, DeFi has done very, very well over the last few months and particularly the last three months from the bottom. So, yeah, it's really great to see that.
00:30:52.358 - 00:31:16.518, Speaker A: I mean, ETH is outperformed BTC, but then DPI has outperformed both, which kind of, like, fits in with, I guess, the trend that we've been seeing. And this is something that I kind of benchmark against. Right. So, you know, with DPI, I benchmark it against Ethan BTC, and if I'm not outperforming them with DPI, then there's really no reason for me to hold DPI. Right. And I'm talking, like, long term performance, not short term. So you should like for me.
00:31:16.518 - 00:31:39.626, Speaker A: I mean, I wouldn't. I'm not going to say that you should benchmark against BTC and ETH, but that's just what I do mentally. You know, you, for example, you could buy dpi and it could go up ten times in USD, but ETH could go up 20 times in USD. Are you really going to care? Right? Are you really going to care that you didn't buy ETH instead of DPI? Probably not. You go up ten times on your USD. Who cares? Or fiat in general. But still, it's really cool to see this.
00:31:39.626 - 00:32:17.346, Speaker A: And I just, that just kind of caught my eye there. So I'll link this in the YouTube description because there's a much more in this kind of report here that you can go check out as well. So lastly, I just wanted to end with this tweet that I put out today where I basically say this time we have earned it. Now, some of you may remember an infamous tweet from Vitalik back in 2017 when the total crypto market cap hit half a trillion dollars. He put out a thread asking if we had earned it, and he asked a bunch of different questions, and kind of people were just like, no, I don't think we've earned it at this point. All we had on Ethereum was icos. There was no Defi.
00:32:17.346 - 00:32:55.994, Speaker A: We weren't kind of banking the unbanked or you providing financial services to people that really needed them. We were just a massive kind of casino in 2017. With icos, there was no ETH two, right? ETH two was still a kind of distant kind of thing. And, you know, the ecosystem was very small. But this time, I think we have earned it. You know, I think with the ecosystem that we've built with DeFi, especially Defi, but like the daos that we have nfts, we have so many different things going on right now, like web3 stuff as well, that we have built an ecosystem that has lasting appeal, especially within Defi. It's not like these bull markets gonna end and Defy is gonna go away.
00:32:55.994 - 00:33:29.006, Speaker A: That's just. That's just not gonna happen. I actually have a theory that the. The market is gonna be kind of hard to tell what it's gonna do this time around because of the fact that people are gonna stay in Defi. I believe when you, quote, unquote, cash out or sell some of your investments, are you going to fear in a bank account and letting the bank, you know, either kind of charge you a negative interest rate or pay you like, 0.5% on your dollars? Right? Or are you staying in DeFi, where you can get 20% safe yield on your stable coins? I know where I'm staying. Right.
00:33:29.006 - 00:34:10.124, Speaker A: I'm not going to the. Going to my bank account anymore. I'm going there for taxes, don't get me wrong. But that's it, right? And maybe bills that I can't pay with my crypto, but, I mean, we saw yesterday the aave kind of card that's being teased, you know, we're going to get to a point where you don't need to leave the Defi ecosystem anymore for anything but taxes. And even then, I think, you know, there's some governments are in, I think there's one government, a state government in the US, that was accepting BTC and ETH for taxes. So even then, I think we're going to get to that point, and that's kind of like when I think we hit that kind of paradigm shift where, you know, we exit the old world, enter this new world, and it's kind of like the new world becomes the, the old world. Like, it's just, that is the world.
00:34:10.124 - 00:34:53.368, Speaker A: So, yeah, and that's why I put out this tweet about us earning it, because I was watching the prize gap and everything, and I remembered the Vitalik tweet and I was like, I really do feel like we've earned it this time. There's just not that kind of crazy disgustingness that we felt in 2017. Around icos, people are much more positive this time around. People realize that DeFi NFT, like, all those use cases, they have staying power, especially Defi. And people really do believe that DeFi is going to change the world and that it's going to be a lasting thing. So, yeah, I won't ramble to kind of rant on about that too much because I've gone over time here, but I just definitely wanted to kind of say that because I think, you know, not just myself, but a lot of you would be feeling the same way. So.
00:34:53.368 - 00:35:09.704, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, everyone, that's it for today's episode. Thank you again for listening and watching.
