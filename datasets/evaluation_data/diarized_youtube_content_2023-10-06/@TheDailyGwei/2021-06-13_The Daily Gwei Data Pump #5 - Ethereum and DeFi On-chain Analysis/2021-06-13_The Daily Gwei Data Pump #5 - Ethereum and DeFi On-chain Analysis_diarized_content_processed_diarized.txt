00:00:00.480 - 00:00:49.168, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to the fifth episode of the deli Wade data pump where I go through the various on chain Ethereum and defi metrics and do a detailed analysis on them. Today's episode will be covering the month of May, so let's get right into it. So the first thing I wanted to kind of look at today was east price for the month of May. And well, did it have a journey during May? That is for sure. So you can see here on the left side, we started May at about what price was it here? About 27 57. We went up to its new all time high of 4400 around abouts that at about 12 May. So you know, not too long after we, we had a pretty incredible run here and then obviously we had the great crypto crash where we went from essentially 4400 down to about, what was it, 1730 here.
00:00:49.168 - 00:01:22.754, Speaker A: So this is quite the drop you can see here. If I measure the drop from, from top to bottom, that was a 60% drop for ETH from, I guess this is 12 May till the 24 May. So over twelve days we had a 60% drop which was pretty brutal and brought us back to prices that we hadn't seen since the end of March. Yeah, basically end of March, beginning of April. Now of course we've come back up a little bit, but we're kind of like stuck in a bit of a range here. So you can see that we're back up at 23 70 at time of recording. But you know, it's been ranging a little bit and actually been trending down.
00:01:22.754 - 00:02:02.734, Speaker A: So you can see here, this is the four hour chart by the way, but you can see here that over the past few days we've been trending down. But this goes into June of course, and this episode is covering May. So I do just want to kind of like quickly give some thoughts about what happened here. Now obviously, you know, if I go to the daily chart, oops, that's the three days. If I go to the daily chart here and you can kind of see like the incredible run that ETH had. You know, I guess like over the last year or so since like March. I mean if we just take it from May, if we take like from the 1 May till the, the 1 may here in 2020 to I guess like what was it, the, the 1 May 2021 we were up 1100 percent.
00:02:02.734 - 00:02:25.542, Speaker A: And then at the top we were up, uh, what was it, two? 2000%. So we're up about 20 x from there. Now if we take it from the bottom, if you managed to catch the bottom uh, during, uh, the, the COVID dump in March. You are up 47 x in. In about 425 days, which is a pretty incredible return. But as you can see here, you know, it went up so much, and then it. And then it went up like a fair bit here.
00:02:25.542 - 00:02:54.448, Speaker A: It accelerated in this range here, similar to what happened here. But I think it was, it was a different time where, you know, end of December, early January, this was kind of just ETH getting back to its all time high. And the market was, was very, very bullish. We still had some pretty brutal drops during it, but we continued up. And this was kind of like, you know, ETH in my mind, ETH didn't go up that fast like you would expect to see. I mean, this is the log chart, but you would expect to see maybe, you know, a bit higher than this or something like that. I was thinking maybe we'd see six k before we came down.
00:02:54.448 - 00:03:30.056, Speaker A: But I think, you know, bitcoin had looked weak for a while. Ethereum obviously had already had an incredible run. And there are a bunch of other tokens out there, like the dog tokens, you know, a lot of you will be familiar with, and a lot of things like that that, you know, got, had a lot of money come into it. And then a lot of people came in, a lot of retail investors, a lot of newer investors, and they basically kind of, you know, lost a lot of money, made a lot of money, some of them, and then all the money kind of, I guess, ran out and we came down after that. So, yeah, was a pretty brutal drop here. And you won't see it in necessarily, in most of May's metrics. The metrics for May are quite insane.
00:03:30.056 - 00:04:05.438, Speaker A: The on chain metrics, which I'll go through in a sec, but you'll see it when I do next month's data, data pump and see like how quiet June is going to be comparatively. Because at the end of the day, the price and the market kind of like activity drives the on chain activity at this point in time. Because pretty much like most of the stuff that's happening is speculative. You know, all the defi stuff is speculative. No one's really using DeFi. At least majority of people aren't using DeFi for non speculative activities, which isn't a bad thing. But, you know, with the speculation is obviously higher during times of high kind of volatility and high market activity there.
00:04:05.438 - 00:04:46.906, Speaker A: So without further ado, let's get into the data metrics for the month of May. So you can see here, this is the number of active addresses. So if I just kind of get, like, I guess, like, if I just take from January and Zoom in here, and you can kind of see January to, to May, basically till today, June 12 here, you can see that the massive drop off here. So we peaked at about May 11, which was just before the. The crash happened, and then at 734,000 active addresses on Ethereum. And then we came down, obviously, over the next few days when, as the price crashed, we came down to 544,000. So we lost about, you know, just almost 200,000 active addresses.
00:04:46.906 - 00:05:30.636, Speaker A: And that's been trending down since currently at about 500,000, which is levels not seen by March. Now, if we kind of plot this against the price here, it's not like a one to one kind of thing, but you can see how, like, you know, as the price is going up, obviously, the active addresses are kind of, like, following it there. But it seems that the active addresses are actually a leading indicator where they start trending up before the price does. So I'm not saying that you could use this indicator as, like, something to, I guess, play in the markets with or anything like that, or kind of trade against. But, you know, even if we kind of, like, zoom out maybe a year or something like that, it's kind of hard to say. Right? Because here is like, you have like, a bunch of ups and downs, a bunch of ups and downs while the price was just kind of trending up steadily. But then, you know, and it depends what moving average use as well.
00:05:30.636 - 00:06:04.780, Speaker A: If you use like, a zero day becomes even, I guess, like, even more noisy. So I don't think this is an indicator that you can use, but it is one you can use for like, a macro pictures. Because if we scroll out to five years and just look at the last kind of cycle here, let me do a seven day moving average on this. You can see the same thing happened at the end of the last cycle. And I'm not saying that the cycle's over this time or anything like that, but generally, this is what you'll see. You'll see like a spike in active addresses, and then you'll see kind of a come down here. Now, I don't necessarily think you can compare what happened here to last time here, because these days there are a lot of different things you can do on chain.
00:06:04.780 - 00:06:44.448, Speaker A: Right back here, it was basically icos and kind of sending, I guess, ethan tokens to and from centralized exchanges. There wasn't any sort of defi back in the 2017 run, whereas kind of here, you still have people being active on the network, whether that's through yield farming. Yeah, I know the yields have dropped a fair bit lately, but still, that's through kind of like yield farming, doing different Defi actions, stuff like that. But also generally we, this is layer one and we, we've seen a few L2 solutions go online. There's polygon that's taken a lot of kind of activity, kind of offloaded from the Ethereum network, which is positive to see. And I'll go through some of the polygon stats later on. I've got them up here.
00:06:44.448 - 00:07:46.716, Speaker A: But I think generally there's going to be like a cap on the number of active addresses, and it might kind of like trend down over time, naturally, because most users will be at L2 instead of layer one, whereas layer one would just be a kind of settlement layer, where instead of looking at active addresses on the network, you look at the value settled on the network, which I'm going to go over in a little bit here. So, still good to see this. I think we're not at that point yet where most users are on L2. So this still has some signal in it, but I think as time goes on, it's definitely going to become more, more of a noisy chart rather than signal here. So the next one I wanted to look at was the net unrealized profit loss chart from glass node here, or the nupple. So I've gone over this on every data pump since the series began, and I've been watching this for quite a while, and I have been saying to you guys that if we trickled into the blue here, so you can see it trickled into the blue on the right hand side here, that means the market is getting, you know, very overheated. And essentially what this measures is it basically takes all of the addresses on chain measures, what kind of profit they're in on ETH and how, by how much.
00:07:46.716 - 00:08:23.004, Speaker A: So if this is in the blue, it means like, a lot of people are in profit by a lot of, um, a lot of percentage. And you might expect like a downturn soon. Now, comparing it to like a 2017, I compared it in previous data pumps where I said that even if we kind of go up to, I guess, um, go up to the blue, we can remain in there for, for quite a while this time. We briefly touched the blue and then kind of like went bank into to the green pretty, pretty quickly. And I think that's because of bitcoin, honestly. Bitcoin definitely led the way down because it was looking very weak for a little while there. And then Ethan, I checked, was actually down less than bitcoin from its peak.
00:08:23.004 - 00:08:46.844, Speaker A: And the ratio did go down a bit due to the El Salvador news, but generally has held up quite well. So if I look at the bitcoin nuptial here, I know this is ethereum stuff that I'm supposed to be covering, but the bitcoin one's pretty interesting. You can see it never actually went into the blue. It's. And it stayed in the green. It's actually come out of the green and into the yellow here this time. So a lot of, I guess, like, bitcoin has cooled down a lot, like, considerably here.
00:08:46.844 - 00:09:13.816, Speaker A: And this kind of, like, never just eyeing it here. This. This has kind of, like, never happened before. It had always gone into the blue area first, before coming down kind of into the green and then into the yellow again, whereas this time we didn't touch the blue area. And this is the seven day moving average. But even on the, I guess, like, zero day moving average, we didn't touch it either here. So I think when you look at this, and I guess there were some fundamental reasons why BTC's price came down as well.
00:09:13.816 - 00:09:34.882, Speaker A: There was the china mining kind of ban thud thing. There was the Elon Musk ESG stuff. You know, there was a lot of kind of things going on around there. That's, I think, why bitcoin came down, or at least in part, a big reason why. And maybecom was already looking weak, mind you, the institutional inflows had kind of stopped there. But this is actually quite healthy that it's in the yellow now. Now, you know, people were saying, well, we're going.
00:09:34.882 - 00:10:10.180, Speaker A: Some people are saying, oh, well, we're going into a long term bear market. And if that is the case, then BTC's price will keep falling, which means that this yellow will keep falling because people will be less in profit, there'll be less kind of holders in profit, and you eventually get to the orange zone and the red zone. Now, traditionally, in the red zone has been a pretty good bottom indicator for both BTC and ETH. On ETH, it's been absolutely kind of, like, amazing in terms of, like, just the price ranging. So you can see the price is the. Is the kind of gray line here. And you can see that basically during 2018 2019, if you had bought at any period during the red, you were doing very well.
00:10:10.180 - 00:10:30.796, Speaker A: Like, yes, you might. You may have kind of, like, lost. Like, if you bought up here, it was $200 and, you know, went down to, like, 80. Yes, you would have been down, but, you know, over the longer period of time, you would have been fine. So this kind of, like, also shows you how risky it is to buy at what price points? Because it gets to a point where there's just no. No sellers kind of left. Their sellers are completely exhausted because people are just, like, completely out of the money.
00:10:30.796 - 00:10:43.924, Speaker A: They don't want to sell at a loss. And, you know, the knuckle goes negative here. So that's what we've seen play out. And I think ethnople actually looks pretty healthy. I'm kind of glad to see that. It's just in the green store. And then there's still a lot of ETH holders that are in massive profits.
00:10:43.924 - 00:11:00.398, Speaker A: And I don't know if these holders are actually going to sell at this stage. Maybe they will. Maybe we will go down further. But. But when it. When it comes to ETH, you actually can't just look at things in a vacuum and can't compare it to bitcoin, because think about how many ETH holders are staking. Like, how many of those long term ETH holders put their Ethan to staking.
00:11:00.398 - 00:11:31.926, Speaker A: And you. And if you think about it, we had millions going to staking when ETH was below $1,000, I believe. Um, so if you kind of look at it from that point of view, that all those addresses are counting towards this. This kind of knuckle and all that, that ETH is counting towards this. And there's plenty of, um, you know, longer term investors out there using ETH in defi to borrow against and stuff like that. So I think you can't just look at Ethan bitcoins knuckle and compare them to each other. As you've seen as well, bitcoins is in the yellow, and bitcoins kind of like, I guess, had, like, a more violent drop from.
00:11:31.926 - 00:11:39.814, Speaker A: From. You can see there. But whereas with ETH, it's just. It's just pretty smooth. Yeah, it's been. It's been quite smooth. During the bull market, the bear market was pretty violent.
00:11:39.814 - 00:11:53.858, Speaker A: Don't get me wrong. It was more violent in the lows. But. But over time, ETH has been pretty healthy here. Now, you know, I don't obviously know this is investment advice. I don't know if it's going to go back into the yellow yarn and then the orange and the red or anything like that. I don't think so, personally.
00:11:53.858 - 00:12:25.942, Speaker A: But we'll have to see what. What plays out there. But again, it's definitely good to look at stuff like this and kind of like, I guess, get a feel for what's going on because essentially, I guess, like, we went into the blue on May 6 and we stay, and basically the dump was on, like, May 11. So we didn't stay in the blue for very long. We stayed in the blue for, for, I would have to say about ten days. And then we went pretty deep into the green here because of the crash and a lot of people didn't sell and all that sort of stuff there. But, yeah, so this indicator is one of my favorites to use still.
00:12:25.942 - 00:12:57.834, Speaker A: I think it still paints a pretty good picture, but we'll have to see how it plays out in next month's data recap. So this is the number of addresses with a balance of holding over 10,000 ETH. So for the month of May, this didn't really kind of change much in terms of, to the downside. So this is May here. So you can see that may, essentially the beginning of May there was about what I'd have to say, 1150 unique Ethereum addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH. That went up to about 1200. Just, I guess, like, you know, just before the big crash.
00:12:57.834 - 00:13:23.866, Speaker A: Sorry, during the big crash, like, it was still kind of up here then. And then it kind of, like, went down a little bit. Not too much went down by, like, ten addresses. And now it's back up to essentially where it was. So, you know, whales are still in the game. They're still accumulating. They're not kind of like selling off like they did back, I guess, like during the 2017, sorry, the 2018 2019 thing where you can see here where, I mean, it took a little bit of time.
00:13:23.866 - 00:14:03.682, Speaker A: I think in March of 2018, that's when it started going down again. And, like, you know, a lot of big holders kind of like, de risked here, but. And then during kind of 2019 into 2020 as well. I actually went through this on the last pump when I thought this was curious because I thought during this time, a lot of whales were chasing the bitcoin pump because the BTC out of institutional inflows coming in, there's a lot of hype around it. And then immediately, basically in November and December, he started recovering a little bit, like, especially in December and the, and the whales shot up here, but people are still accumulating. Like, whales have not really kind of risked here. Whereas you look at, if you look at other addresses with, like, you know, more than 1008th that's been coming down for quite a while.
00:14:03.682 - 00:14:20.890, Speaker A: More than 100 ETH has been coming down as well. More than ten ETH. Slightly less. More than one ETH has actually been going up, I think. Yeah, it's been going up, but that also can be because people are using ETH more, and they need ETH for gas fees, of course. So that's another thing you can't compare to bitcoin. And then 0.1
00:14:20.890 - 00:14:33.524, Speaker A: is going up as well. Gas fees, I would say. And then 0.01 has been going down a little bit here. I would consider 0.01, a lot of that to be maybe dust addresses, too. So you have to take that into consideration as well.
00:14:33.524 - 00:14:51.752, Speaker A: And addresses with more than a zero balance has also kind of, like, just been trending up over time, too. And you can see during May, you know, it kind of, like, plateaued. Right? Like, generally you'll. You'll see that, uh, it just goes up, like, linearly like this. And sometimes it'll kind of, like, slow down. But, you know, it's. It's kind of, like, plateaued here during the kind of, like.
00:14:51.752 - 00:15:08.656, Speaker A: And the price is against this. So you can kind of see that there. So, still good to see that, you know, the whales are in the game. You know, all these people panic selling their ETH, are probably selling them to whales. This is the way the game works. These whales have more money, and they're happy to kind of, like, take on, I guess, more riskier. So, yeah, still good to see that.
00:15:08.656 - 00:15:37.704, Speaker A: If I go to, like, the zero day moving average, it's probably. Yeah, I mean, based on the zero day moving average, it's pretty much at an all time high, which is pretty crazy when you look at it like that. But, yeah, that's another interesting kind of metric I like to pay attention to. So that's the same metric there I had that doubled up. Whoops. All right, onto the blocks data metrics now. So I was talking about before, when I was talking about active addresses, how when you look at active addresses, it's going to become less and less of a signal because of the fact that people are going to be moving to L2s.
00:15:37.704 - 00:16:03.340, Speaker A: And the. And the kind of, like, activity happening on layer one is going to be more kind of like high value activity, where it's. It's good to look at on chain adjust adjusted volume. So if you actually look at its on chain adjusted volume, it's been increasing over time. And this is especially because of defi. So in May alone, it was $666 billion that was settled on ethereum's layer one, that's a huge amount of money. Right? And then the previous month was in April's 1340.
00:16:03.340 - 00:16:32.734, Speaker A: 5 billion. But obviously in May, you know, even, even if the, the market was volatile. Sorry, the market was going down, there was still trading happening. It's only when the market's quiet, when it's ranging, when it's kind of like sideways and range bound, that's when you'll see kind of these volumes drop off. And I'll go over June next month, but you can see already we're in the first twelve days of June and it's only 117 billion. And I think, you know, we've got another 20, sorry, 18 days left here. So you can say that we've, we're basically going to be maybe the same as April, if that.
00:16:32.734 - 00:16:48.510, Speaker A: We might even be less than April here. So. And then you can go back and look at, like, the, all the previous times, which was very, very, very low. I mean, December 2019 was only 5.7 billion. I think that was the lowest, lowest for the last, like, three or four years here. But May was obviously huge.
00:16:48.510 - 00:17:20.174, Speaker A: So this is what's going to keep happening. You're just going to have, like, these very, very high value kind of transactions being settled on a theorem layer one. Well, especially because more and more users are going to move to L2 solutions or other scalability solutions out there as well. So this is another chart I like to keep, to keep track of. But I don't think it's like a leading indicator because you can't really know because at the end of the day, the price going up is just going to lead to more volatility. So the price is essentially and more kind of like on chain volume. So price is definitely the leading indicator rather than this, this metric here.
00:17:20.174 - 00:17:46.386, Speaker A: So the percentage of ETH supply and profit. So this is similar to the nuppel metric, which shows, I guess, the knuckle goes further than this and shows, like, by how much these addresses are in profit. But you can still see here, like, basically a lot of addresses, as was pointed out by the nuppo, are still in massive profits. You can see almost 80% of addresses are still in profit here. And, you know, that didn't really change. I mean, this, this kind of measures. Oh, wait, this goes back to 2020, actually.
00:17:46.386 - 00:18:12.126, Speaker A: I don't think this actually goes back to May. I think I was reading that wrong there. That's weird. Why didn't this go back? Why doesn't this go to may here? Maybe if I refresh the page, it might let's see what happens there if I refresh because I think that'll be a really interesting stat to take a look at and see if it's still at 80%. Let's see if this works here. No, that data doesn't want to come. And they're saying they're getting this data from glass node, but it doesn't link to what data they have here.
00:18:12.126 - 00:18:29.460, Speaker A: So yeah, I guess I'll just leave that for now. Unfortunately, I won't be able to show you guys that. But I think that the nuppool kind of like has it here. Actually, if I search percentage of ETH in profit. Yeah, okay. It's a tier three metric. I can't actually look at that, but I can see percent of the supply in profit, which I guess is the next best thing.
00:18:29.460 - 00:19:04.566, Speaker A: So let's just look at this from glass. Note if the blocks doesn't want to work here. So you can see that the percentage of supply in profit is still up massively. You can see, I guess like in the month of May it was at, I mean, obviously when it's at all time highs it's at 100%, but still, still, it's at about today it's at about 86%. And then, you know, by the end of May it was at 86% as well. So 86% of all the current e supply is still in profit. And as you can see here, you know, when you're in your in kind of like, I guess bear markets and stuff, this is obviously going to go down.
00:19:04.566 - 00:19:37.770, Speaker A: And this, this definitely follows price, obviously, right. You can see the price goes up, percentage of supply and profit goes up. So you can read this two, two ways. You can say, well, we have a long way down to go. You know, if you think the price is going to tank, we have a long way down to the bottom, but you can read it in another way where we could probably go down a bit more, but then, you know, go sideways for a bit and then trend back up again. So, you know, in the past, especially here, you can see a lot of people like to compare the June, July crash to this crash. You can see that it went down a lot.
00:19:37.770 - 00:20:09.454, Speaker A: Obviously, ETH went down from, I think 420 to 120 back then, but then spiked back up in kind of like the August, September went down a little bit, kind of like spiked back up again. So that could happen as well. I mean, it can go, it literally can grow either way. And this is not going to be predictive of anything. This is just going to show you that there's still a lot of people in profit. You could read that as there's still a lot of people that want to sell and can sell in profit and will take profits, or you can read it that people have diamond hands and don't want to sell their ETH yet and don't want to kind of, like, get out of their positions either way. Uh, this metric, I think, is just a cool one to kind of look at.
00:20:09.454 - 00:20:43.116, Speaker A: I don't think think it's one that. That has any predictive power, but still it's something to kind of, I guess, keep in mind. I guess, like, up here, they kind of, like, have a red and green kind of zone. And I guess, like, this pretty easily paints. I guess, like, the tops and bottoms you can see here, you know, when it's, like, firmly in the green zone here, it's pretty good buying opportunity and has been traditionally a very good buying opportunity always. And that paints, like, the bottom. So maybe if you think we're going to go into a long term bear market, you wait till we get down here to buy, because essentially every single time, if you had bought down here, you'd be fine.
00:20:43.116 - 00:21:34.284, Speaker A: Uh, you know, obviously, like, going up here after staying down here, uh, during, I guess, like, that mid 2019 pump here, you would have been in profit, but then you wouldn't have been as it went back down. But still, like, generally, over the long term, you're fine buying in these zones. So maybe that's a zone that you wait for when less than 30% of the supply is in profit, you kind of get out, and then up here, it's like, when more than 100%, no, more than, I guess, like, 95% ish of the supply is in profit, you. You kind of, like, start taking profits up here. Seems to be something that you would miss out on, though, because if you see here like this, the percentage of the supply that went into the red zone, it started going into the red zone at $733. So if you had sold as soon as it went into the red zone here, you would have missed ETH kind of run to $4,400. So, you know, and if you had kind of, like, bought when it went into the green zone here, it.
00:21:34.284 - 00:22:12.962, Speaker A: You actually don't miss much because the first time went into the green zone down here, I think, was like a. It went down to 80 and then came back up. Like, I don't buying, I think, like, during. When it's in the green zone is probably the better kind of way to go about it rather than selling up here because if you sell up here, you definitely lose out on, on a massive run, whereas buying in the green traditionally seems to have been a pretty good, uh, pretty good kind of like, not perspective pretty good kind of thing to do here. So, yeah, that, that's a very interesting metric, I think. Something to keep an eye on, for sure. So another thing that actually, I've been watching, and this isn't on chain for Ethereum or anything like that, but this is centralized exchange volume.
00:22:12.962 - 00:22:37.172, Speaker A: So ETH has actually been catching up to bitcoin on kind of like centralized exchange volume and closing the gap here. So as you can see, you know, year to date, I guess you could say BTC is actually in blue here and ETH is in red. I think it should be swapped, but that's just the way it is. You can see that. And this is based on the seven day moving average that the gap has been closing. Like, traditionally, the gap has been quite large. As you can see here.
00:22:37.172 - 00:23:46.680, Speaker A: BTC's trading volume on centralized exchanges was quite, quite large there. But then, as I guess, like April and May seems to have come along here, the gap closed considerably. And it closed a lot, I guess, around here during May, where, you know, BTC had $20 billion of kind of like volume here, ETH had 18 billion and it kept closing, and here was like 20 and 22 billion, and then it's kind of kept, kept up there. But I guess lately, you know, it's been kind of diverging again. But generally, the trend has been that ETH has been catching up to it, which I think is a very, very good trend because it means that ETH is probably less successful, less susceptible to BTC's kind of like price movements, because you'll see in the markets generally, people will say, oh, well, you know, if bitcoin's going down, then all everything else is going down, or if bitcoin's in a downtrend, that everything else is a downtrend. I hope to see as time goes on that that's not the case, because there is no reason, absolutely no reason outside of, like, pure speculative manias for BTC and ETH to be correlated, because they are very, very different things. If you're buying ETH as a fundamental investor, I'm not talking about traders or speculators.
00:23:46.680 - 00:24:24.464, Speaker A: If you're buying ETH as a fundamental investor, you are buying it for different reasons. As to buying BTC, same with a lot of these other assets, like DeFi, for example. If you're buying DeFi assets, you're buying them for completely different reasons as to why you would buy bitcoin. So why should they be correlated? Um, is it just because the fact that, I mean, I asked why they should be correlated, but I know because the liquidity profile, um, in bitcoin is much, is much higher. Like it has much higher, um, liquidity. Um, it's, it's kind of like a flight to safety asset and same with ETH, I think, these days. Um, and it's like kind of like a bridge asset for a lot of these things on centralized exchanges where you trade between BTC or ETH and these other kind of assets.
00:24:24.464 - 00:25:20.108, Speaker A: So that's like one reason. But I think generally as more fundamental investors come into this space over the longer term, we should see these correlations, you know, I guess like draw apart, but during a bear market, pretty much everything will be, will be quite correlated because people are just trying to get out of like everything, you know, BTC will fall less than ETH, ETH will fall less than the rest of the kind of things out there. Um, but generally, you know, you'll see that everything kind of trends down together and that, and that is fine. But I think on the way up you should see correlations kind of, I guess, like um, you know, split up there because of the fact that things, these things should be traded based on their own merits and, or like invested in based on their own merits, rather than being traded together as one big thing. So I'm hoping to see more kind of like market structure change there, but not an expert on markets. Just thought it was something interesting to point out here. So you can see here this, this is kind of like, I guess falls into what I was talking about before with active addresses.
00:25:20.108 - 00:25:57.936, Speaker A: This is the, and this is like the other kind of side of the coin, the transactions on the Ethereum network. So you can see these peaked as well at about 1.66 million transactions on the Ethereum network in one day. So these daily transactions based on the seven day moving average, that was an all time high, and now we're back down to 1.2 million. I don't think this is necessarily any, I don't think this necessarily gives us any kind of insight, and I think, I guess into price movements. And I also think that it's going to be affected just like active addresses are going to be affected where users are moving to L2s and scalability solutions and not doing as many transactions on layer one.
00:25:57.936 - 00:26:31.206, Speaker A: But the thing is, the transactions that are going to be on layer one are going to be of higher value. So you can think about like, I guess like the whales playing on layer one and the L2s posting their roll up security proofs to layer one and stuff like that. I think we're going to see more of that play out rather than, you know, this sort of stuff here. But I also, sorry. Rather than users kind of interacting with, with the network, the layer one network directly. But I do also want to point out is that the Ethereum network is artificially limited by its, its block size, by its gas limit. So you can imagine like, you know, in bitcoin, there's a 1 mb block size.
00:26:31.206 - 00:27:01.174, Speaker A: With Segwit, it's a bit higher. Or the block weight is different there. Within ethereum, our current gas limit is 15 million. So we have 15 million gas worth of space in each block, which means that we can only fit in a certain amount of transactions per block. So, you know, I always see people comparing Ethereum transactions per day to other networks. You know, some people compare it to polygon and things like that. I mean, the reason why Polygon can do more transactions per day is because it has bigger blocks at the end of the day.
00:27:01.174 - 00:27:32.498, Speaker A: That's as simple as that. It has a higher gas limit. It can fit, fit more transactions into that block. So I don't think comparing transactions between networks is even like something that you should do because each network has its own reason for the amount of transactions it can do. And you'll see here that I guess, like, you know, while the gas limit was at 12.5 million, it wasn't really spiking up because it couldn't, it could go up slightly, but it couldn't really do any massive growth because it was still being limited. But as soon as we raise that gas limit, you saw like a massive spike in transactions here.
00:27:32.498 - 00:28:19.116, Speaker A: And also, I guess, like, the market went pretty crazy too. So it's kind of hard to tell exactly how it's correlated here, but I think there definitely is a correlation there. And on that note as well, in terms of like the gas limit, if you take the gas limit today and take the transactions per second, that Ethereum can do, on average, ethereum is doing 14 transactions per second. Now, theoretically, if all the transactions on Ethereum were just ETH transfers could do probably like 50 transactions per second. This is because ETH transfers are the cheapest kind of transactions you can do on the network. They only take up 21,000 gas per ETH transfer, whereas complex things like smart contract interactions take up much more, such as trading on a Dex or whatever. So whatever the transactions are on the network, and depending on how much gas they take up, you'll be able to fit in less.
00:28:19.116 - 00:28:48.266, Speaker A: So, say, like, each transaction on the network is taking up, I guess, like, uh, sorry. Say, say you have, like, I guess, uh, a transaction that uses up a million gas, you can only fit 15 of those into. Into a block. So if there's like, 15 transactions in that block and blocks are every 14 seconds, then your transactions per second are. Isn't going to be 14 transactions per second, it's going to be much lower than that. So I think that's something to keep in mind when looking at this sort of stuff, is that, um, ethereum is. Has a.
00:28:48.266 - 00:29:15.234, Speaker A: Has a hard limit on how much transactions it can do per. Per kind of, like, day here. And that's based on the block gas limit as well there. So let's take a look into a bit of defi metrics now. So particularly around decentralized exchanges, and you guys will know that this is my favorite dashboard from doodle analytics here for tracking dexs. So let's take a look at what happened in May. So you can see here that May was basically the kind of highest volume on dexs ever.
00:29:15.234 - 00:29:57.370, Speaker A: Basically, like, it was $172 billion worth of volume on dexs just in the month of May alone. In April, that was only 82 billion. So, basically more than double here. And also, if you compare it to the previous year, to 2020, there was only a billion dollars done in May 2020, so that we had 172 x increase there. Now, if you look at the breakdown of which projects, you can see here on the left, Uniswap accounted for the vast majority of that, I think, for about 50% of the volume here, $81 billion worth. And then you had sushiswap coming in second at 24 billion, curve at 10 billion, sorry, zero x native at 10 billion, then curve at about 9.5 billion after that, and then a bunch of others there.
00:29:57.370 - 00:30:30.144, Speaker A: And you can see here, you know, how kind of, like, dramatic the drop off has been, too. And you can see that here as well, where June has only had $27 billion worth of volume so far. And June is probably going to be more in line with April, I would suspect about 82 billion, whereas May is just going to be like a massive outlier there. And you can also see from this kind of weekly Dex volume chart that Uniswap has actually been kind of still increasing its dominance, or at least staying as dominant as, um, you know, it has been. Traditionally, it accounts for 61.6% of the Dex market share. Whereas in the past it was less.
00:30:30.144 - 00:30:58.620, Speaker A: I mean, it, I think it was 60% back in, uh, in April as well. But you can see here it was much less, and it's just become more over time. And I think this, this is actually a good indicator of retail interest, because retail, uh, uh, retail investors aren't using Dex aggregators. You can see here that the share of kind of Dex aggregators, um, has only kind of like, uh, I guess, like started increasing during June. But I wish this went back further. I was looking at it in May and it was like hardly anything. It was like 90% direct.
00:30:58.620 - 00:31:13.884, Speaker A: And that's because of Uniswap. And most users only knew about uniswap. And things like the dog tokens and stuff like that were on Uniswap. So that's why you see that uniswap is such a dominant Dex here, and continues to be such a dominant Dex. I mean, look at that market share right there. Absolutely insane. Okay.
00:31:13.884 - 00:31:38.976, Speaker A: No, no, I was looking at the wrong, no. Was I looking at the right chart? Yes, sorry, I was looking at the right chart here. Um, so, yeah, I think that's actually a really good indicator of kind of like what retail interest is in, is in at any point, any given point in time. Because retail is not using, um, most of the other dexes out there. They're not using, you know, Bancor or balancer, like, as much as you want them to use those things. They're not doing it. They're just using uniswap because it is the most well known, uh, Dex out there.
00:31:38.976 - 00:32:20.286, Speaker A: It is super simple to use. It is integrated with everything. It has the brand awareness and everything like that has the liquidity, which is also very important. So I think that's something to keep an eye on as well, and might be a useful indicator going forward. So I'd be remiss if I didn't kind of talk about gas prices and what they were like during May and what they're like now. So you can see, I guess, like this, this gas dashboard here, and the medium gas price over the various weeks here, and how it's come down considerably. So you can see, I guess, on this chart here, the medium gas price since I guess, like January, February, March, April, may has, you know, 100 to, I guess, like 150 ish or something like that.
00:32:20.286 - 00:32:58.504, Speaker A: It's kind of like, kind of stayed between, but now it's kind of dropped off completely and come way down to 18. And, you know, right now, the rapid transaction gas price is ten, which is very, very low. And you can also see here the medium gas price by day, and you can see the spikes up and things like that. You know, this spike was obviously due to the crash on the chart here. And you can see cost of an ETH transfer for per day. But essentially you can see the trend here, right, where we basically had massive kind of spikes during, I guess, like May and even April, and we had higher gas prices, but they came down because market activity came down. So during, actually the.
00:32:58.504 - 00:33:28.832, Speaker A: The gas price for a few hours during the crash went up to like 2000, which is absolutely insane when you think about it right now, because we're at ten gwei right now. So 2000 way is a 200 times increase from where we are right now. And, you know, no one was doing transactions on the network at that point, except people that really needed to. Whether that was like decentralized exchange arbitrage opportunities or liquidating or saving your position from being liquidated, there was a lot of that stuff going on. But there's. There's many reasons why the gas price has gone down, Mark. The lower market activity is definitely one.
00:33:28.832 - 00:33:47.238, Speaker A: People have moved to other kind of scalability solutions, like L2s, like polygon, things like that. The gas limit went up. I mean, you can see here the. As I mentioned, the gas limit went up to 15 million from 12.5 million. And I think the market activity being quiet accounts for a lot of it. But there's definitely a lot of that stuff going on there.
00:33:47.238 - 00:34:13.112, Speaker A: So, yeah, the gas prices are definitely something that I guess, like, has been a topic of conversation for a very long time now. But now that we're in the lower gas prices, it seems to be, you know, not many people talking about it anymore. They're like, oh, my God, gas is so cheap. What transactions can I do right now? Which is, which is kind of funny. But another thing that gas prices affect is miner revenue. So you can see that during, I guess, the last few months, especially in May, there was about 50% of the miner revenue was gas fees. Right? Was transaction fees.
00:34:13.112 - 00:34:37.055, Speaker A: And I should. When I'm talking about miners, I should actually discuss the flashbots. So, the MEV extraction tool that basically takes transactions off the public Ethereum, mempool, and kind of goes around them and goes directly to miners. And that's played a big part in the transaction fees coming down as well. So. And, you know, binance have been taking advantage of that, and they started taking advantage of that April and May. But you can see the disparity here now in.
00:34:37.055 - 00:35:04.794, Speaker A: In June, you know, the the transact transaction fees are basically about, I would say, 20% now, or even less than that of the total miner revenue. Where before it was, it was about 50%. So that's come down considerably here, and I think that's going to remain that way for a little while. I think. I do think that gas prices aren't going to stay at this level for forever. They're going to definitely go back up again, but we're going to have L2s rolling out. We're going to have more and more people using other scalability solutions.
00:35:04.794 - 00:35:54.866, Speaker A: We're going to have flashbots still existing. We're going to have 1559 coming online, which doesn't, by itself, materially lower gas fees, but it does help smoothen out gas fees for users. So I think we definitely are, at least for the foreseeable future, for a little while here, entering a period of time, especially if the market remains quiet, where the gas fees are going to be low, and end users will be able to do a bunch of different things. So, in saying that, I guess, like, the takeaway from this is that if you have transactions that you want to do and you want to kind of get done while gas is cheap, do them now, because, you know, at any moment, the gas can start going up again, especially if the network heats up again. So it's good to get your transactions in now and then, you know, I guess, like, just enjoy the low gas prices while they kind of last year. All right, time to take a look at some ETH two network stats. So the validators kept increasing.
00:35:54.866 - 00:36:15.310, Speaker A: So you can see here, we're now at 164,000 validators. That's because we now have over 5.2 million ETH being staked here, which is really, really cool. You can see that the average validated balance has been going up over time, of course, as people earn more rewards. The average validator balance is at 32.9 ETH right now. So people have made a 0.9
00:36:15.310 - 00:36:45.382, Speaker A: of an ETH per validator since December 1, which is pretty cool to see there. And then you can kind of see, like, other things, like, the participation rate is still kind of trending, you know, pretty solid here. We got 98, over 98% participation rate, which is what we'd love to see here. And then what I like paying attention to is this ETH one deposit address pie chart, which shows you kind of the distribution of staking. So you can see here that Kraken accounts for 14% of the network. Right now. Binance is about 5.4%.
00:36:45.382 - 00:37:09.416, Speaker A: Whales are about 4.1%. I don't know why whales are in their own category, because whales are not a single kind of entity. There's multiple whales and I think they should be in the other section. But then there's a bunch of others like Huobi, bitcoin, Suisse and a bunch of other staking services. You know, everyone knows about Lido and stuff like that. And then you can see Defi here as well. And then others accounts for 62%, or almost 62%, which I really think is really cool.
00:37:09.416 - 00:37:41.792, Speaker A: But in saying that they haven't labeled Coinbase here, this. This kind of like, chart doesn't have Coinbase. Coinbase in my mind then, is in the other section or in the whale section. And I'd be curious to see kind of like what Coinbase looks like, because Coinbase could very easily be like 10% or something, which means that, you know, half of the network would be kind of like, I guess, being staked by. By big stakers here, rather than individual stakers, which I don't think is a death knell or anything like that. I don't think that kind of takes away from staking. I've written about this in the Daily Gray newsletter before.
00:37:41.792 - 00:38:10.404, Speaker A: Why? You know how I kind of like, learn to love exchange staking and staking service providers? I just think it's. It's not something to be too worried about. Um, but generally it's. It's good to see that it's more distributed than. Than, uh, than not, essentially, at the end of the day. So, yeah, that's a bit of like ETH two data there. There's not too much to go through unless I dive deeper into the technical stuff because of the fact that there's nothing really happening on the ETH two network besides, uh, the blocks being produced and validated by the proof of stake consensus mechanism.
00:38:10.404 - 00:38:37.584, Speaker A: Um, because there's no transactions or whatever happening on there. But still good to keep an eye on. Still good to see that the number of validators are increasing. And still good to see more ETH is getting sent into staking here. Alright, so here's a new addition for the data pump is the, I guess, polygon metric. So polygon scan came out the other day, so it's very easy for me to see various metrics of the polygon Pos chain network here. And as you can see, polygon has had an amazing amount of growth.
00:38:37.584 - 00:39:15.204, Speaker A: And I've got four key stats that I want to go through. But this first stat is the polygon Pos chain network utilization chart. So this shows how, you know, I guess like much, sorry, the average gas being used on the network and how kind of like full the network is in terms of like usage. And you can see it absolutely exploded in May and in June because in May the gas fees were very high. But in saying that people were also kind of like adopting polygon because more projects went over to polygon in May, you had a lot of different ones migrate there, like Aave and sushi and things like that. So there was things for people to use. So this is kind of like just showing the massive amount of growth there.
00:39:15.204 - 00:39:56.102, Speaker A: And I was mentioning before how I think that things like the polygon Pos chain, other L2s, have played a role in getting those gas fees down on Ethereum, which was exactly the role they were supposed to play, mind you. So that's really been positive to see the other kind of stat. Here is the daily transactions chart. Now I was explaining just before how when you look at the amount of transactions on different networks, you'll see more for the networks that have larger blocks and a larger block gas limit. And that's exactly what polygon has. The reason polygon can do, you know, sometimes do over 7 million transactions per day is because of that larger block size, whereas Ethereum kind of can't do that. And also the fees are much cheaper on polygon.
00:39:56.102 - 00:40:32.738, Speaker A: They're like subsent fees, so more activities become more profitable to do. So if you're, you're an arbitrage bot and you're doing different kind of arbitrage transactions on chain, um, say you want to do like an arbitrage and make $5 a profit. You can't do that. Oh, sorry. There's a $5 spread and you want to kind of like, um, kind of take advantage of that. You can't do that on ethereum layer one because you'd end up spending more in gas fees than you would make from a profit, whereas on the polygon pos chain you can do that. So that's why those transactions kind of like spike up there because you have like these lower value transactions being profitable for these actors, which I think is actually really, really cool.
00:40:32.738 - 00:40:53.802, Speaker A: This is the same thing we're going to see play out with L2s on Ethereum. Like arbitrum is hopefully going to be. I don't think I'll have data for arbitrary for next month's data pump, but for the month after I should. So that's going to be really interesting to see what that looks like. But generally, that's kind of like the reason you see this. But it's also because it just follows the trend of more and more users going over. I mean, there's plenty of kind of like users here.
00:40:53.802 - 00:41:22.164, Speaker A: And I've actually got a. A statistic here that shows the unique addresses that have gone into polygon. There is a ton that, you know, at the beginning of May here, you can see that it was 326,000 unique addresses on the polygon Pos chain. Now it's at 6 million. So obviously that you've seen a lot of use here and it spiked up quite, quite amazingly here. And you can see the network being, being used. And on that note, you can also see the active amount of addresses on the polygon chain.
00:41:22.164 - 00:42:01.074, Speaker A: So you can see that it's up to about, what is it, 110,000? Actually, you know, during May, it was probably less than that. I think it was about. During May it was much less than that. Actually, it was about 50,000 active, active addresses here. These, these are native addresses, I believe, that were created on polygon. Sorry, that, that didn't kind of like bridge over, I believe because if you go to the charts and stats here, they've actually got another address that shows the number of active addresses, the ERC 20 addresses. So these are ones that I think have bridged over, which, you know, paint a different picture here where you can see that basically it's a lot higher than then you'll see in kind of like these ones here.
00:42:01.074 - 00:42:39.112, Speaker A: So two different ways to kind of track this here. But still, I still think the best way to track it is the network utilization and the daily transactions chart here. But you'll see that on a website called crypto fees, that polygon fees and aggregate fees are very, very low. And that's simply because the fees are basically non existent now and then. You can't use that to kind of measure growth. And as I, as I pointed out, they're low because of the fact that the lower value kind of like transactions are profitable. So even though you might have more activity in terms of like daily transactions, the fees are not going to be very high because these daily transactions just low of lower value.
00:42:39.112 - 00:43:09.370, Speaker A: Whereas on Ethereum you have higher value transactions happening. And that means that the gas fees being paid are higher because people are comfortable paying that. Especially, you know, a lot of people are comfortable paying 100, 150 gwei because while the market was hot, yields were high, arbitrage opportunities were amazing. You know, all this stuff was going on. So people were very kind of happy to do that. So from that point of view, that's kind of like another distinction you should make between different kind of chains and different kind of like scalability solutions as well here. So, yeah, hopefully you've enjoyed the polygon stats here.
00:43:09.370 - 00:43:45.394, Speaker A: I definitely will add polygon as a regular kind of occurrence. I think it's really cool to just see it growing and I hope to be able to cover more of these L2s in the near future because I think that's going to be important to monitor going forward. So next up, we have defi pulse here. So we can see that the total value locked in USD obviously has come down during the, during the month of may because of the crash. So you can see here that it peaked at 86 billion, went down to 47 billion, and then, you know, these days is about at 57 billion. Now, this is simply because if you're tracking TVL and USD, it's obviously going to follow the price of the assets that's being tracked and the asset prices went down. So that went down.
00:43:45.394 - 00:44:21.802, Speaker A: The better measure for me is ETH. And you can see that the ETH measure actually went down as well. But it didn't start going down in May, started going down in April, and it just continued down in May. Now, I think there's a few reasons for this. One, as the price of ETH goes up, people pull collateral if they have collateral in because they're like, okay, well, I need less collateral to keep the same liquidation price right now, so I'm going to pull it. But also I think more people went to staking because yields on defi kind of went down and people were like, okay, well, I can get 7% on my ethan staking, or I can try and borrow against my ETH and like, nudge you out maybe 2%, 3% on stable coins. So less people did that.
00:44:21.802 - 00:44:57.784, Speaker A: There's less activity generally within DeFi, of course, because of the fact that the markets come down. So you would expect to see this flow out, but it's still not like something that's that slowed down at all. This general growth has still been up, essentially, and it's continuing back up, I guess, like lately. So while I monitor that and why, I think that's really cool, I think it makes sense, like, and this doesn't track staking as well. So I think it makes sense that this comes down and then you can see staking going up. And I think a lot of ETH that was in Defi actually went to staking. Like me personally, I took a lot of the ETH that I was using for to yield farm with.
00:44:57.784 - 00:45:16.998, Speaker A: And I put that into staking. I've just sent it across now. And that's simply because the yields went down and I'm just getting more of my ETH in staking. And because I never plant the salad in my ETH, it just makes sense for me, me to do that now. Yes, there's a trade off that the ethan staking is locked until, you know, the end of this year, early next year. But I'm fine with that as I. And I, you know, I don't know if, like, I'm fine with the.
00:45:16.998 - 00:45:38.948, Speaker A: The kind of like, uh, risk where, you know, maybe I risk that the yields kind of heat up again in the next few months and I miss out on. On some yield farming there. But I don't. I'm not too fussed about that, really. I think at this point in time, the risk reward is kind of a bit low there. So I just put my Ethan to staking, and I know a lot of other people that do the same thing. Now, if we look at BTC kind of locked as well, you can see that's kind of remained steady.
00:45:38.948 - 00:46:09.460, Speaker A: I think with BTC lock, they actually track a WBTC as well here. So I'm not sure if this is the. The best kind of tracking. But if we go to their BTC at work thing here, you can see actually the bitcoin at work has a bet, paints a better picture here. You can see that this has just been still just like, I guess, trending up. But this bitcoin at work is not measuring bitcoin in defi, as I mentioned, this just counts the amount of bitcoin that is on ethereum. So, you know, I said this before where I think that when once bitcoin comes to a theorem, it doesn't go back to bitcoin.
00:46:09.460 - 00:46:54.192, Speaker A: Because if you want to sell your WBTC or whatever, you just sell it on a theorem on a Dex, you don't actually have to bridge it back. And why would you pay the fees to bridge it back to vanilla bitcoin if you're planning to sell, just sell it on a Dex and then withdraw that money to like, an exchange, and then, you know, sorry, deposit that money into a centralized exchange cash to fiat, if that's what you want to do. So I don't expect this kind of like this to trend down at all. But again, this isn't tracking bitcoin and DeFi. This is tracking bitcoin in WBTC, HBTC, basically tokenized representations of bitcoin here. So the last thing I wanted to kind of go through today was this dashboard from token terminal. Now, this is the best dashboard I have ever come across for measuring various things like protocol revenue for different deFi apps and blockchains.
00:46:54.192 - 00:47:32.130, Speaker A: You can see here, sorry, for different deFi. Dapps, I should say, and blockchain protocol revenue, if it kind of loads here, I think, oh, I know this is by. You can sort it out, you can get rid of that and just put dapps here. Okay, get what's happening here. So if we kind of see the protocol revenue over the last 90 days for a lot of these protocols, they made a lot of money that the top was makerdao that made $33 million, metamask made $30 million. Little known fact that metamask actually makes a ton of money from their swap fees. So if you do the metamask swap and there's a fee attached to that of, I think, 0.8%,
00:47:32.130 - 00:48:02.256, Speaker A: and that's like a Dex aggregator. So metamask makes a lot of revenue from that. You can see here, sushi swap keeper Dao, perpetual protocol. Now, the reason why you won't see something like uniswap here is because this is protocol revenue for the actual treasury, for the actual protocol, not for the liquidity providers, not for the people. Kind of like providing capital to the system. It is just for the protocols themselves. And you can see, you know, I guess like over the last year, some of these have made a ton of money, which has been, which has been quite cool to see.
00:48:02.256 - 00:48:48.300, Speaker A: And then you can go down, I mean, you can, you can actually dive deeper into different projects and markets here. So if I was just to go to something like Alchemyx Finance here and kind of like, look at the project, you can kind of see everything. This will give you like TVL, it'll give you the price to sales ratio, price to earnings ratios. I'm not going to go through this. I just wanted to show off this kind of like, I guess this tool on the data pump today, because I think it's really, really important and a really, really cool tool to kind of like get these kind of things and compare different kind of tokens to their, to their network valuations, their price to sales ratios, their price to earnings. You can see here the price to sales ratio of ETH is about 41 x right now, based on its kind of fee revenue and its market cap, and same with something like Uniswap and bitcoin and sushi swap and things like that. So, yeah, and there's a lot here.
00:48:48.300 - 00:49:44.134, Speaker A: I mean, you know, you can go into like any of these projects, they're covering pretty much like most projects, and not just DeFi, they're covering different blockchain projects as well. And you can see here, you can, you can kind of plot things across the price to sales ratio against the market cap and stuff like that. The TvL kind of like uniswap TVL here, which I think I wrote about this in the Daily Way newsletter the other day, where I think that TVL these days is actually becoming kind of a kind of meh kind of metric because of the fact that there's a bunch of different ways to interpret TVL these days. And then there's like different dashboards for DeFi. You can kind of see like the top protocols in DeFi, what they've been doing, their market caps and things like that, and various metrics here, like total revenue and protocol revenue and things like that. So, as I said, not going to go through all of this on the data pump, but definitely go check this tool out. All the links to everything I've spoken about today will of course be in the YouTube description, but there's a lot of gold to be found here and there's a lot of ways to dive deeper into these data.
00:49:44.134 - 00:50:10.358, Speaker A: There's actually a lot of resources out there, too, besides my video. Like our network is a newsletter that's put together by Spencer noon. There's glass node does a newsletter, Coinmetrix does a newsletter, the block does in their research pieces. They do data breakdowns, do analytics, is amazing for tracking a bunch of different metrics around there. So if that's something you're interested in. Well, I think you are. If you're watching the data pump, then definitely go check out all of those things.
00:50:10.358 - 00:50:27.694, Speaker A: But I think that is it for today. So thank you, everyone for watching. I hope you enjoyed today's episode. The next one will be next month. That will cover the month of June. But if you haven't done so yet, be sure to subscribe to the YouTube channel, give the video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter and join the Discord channel, and I'll catch you all next month. Thanks everyone.
