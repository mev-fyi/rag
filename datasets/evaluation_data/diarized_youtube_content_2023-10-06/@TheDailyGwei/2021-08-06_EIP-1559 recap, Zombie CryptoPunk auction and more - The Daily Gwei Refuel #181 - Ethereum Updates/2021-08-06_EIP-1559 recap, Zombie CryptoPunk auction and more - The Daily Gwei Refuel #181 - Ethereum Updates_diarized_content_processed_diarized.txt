00:00:00.440 - 00:00:29.794, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the deli Gwei refuel, where I recap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cisano, and today's the 6 August 2021. All right, everyone, last 24 hours were absolutely crazy. EIP 1559 is obviously now live on the Ethereum mainnet. Today's refuel is probably going to be 1559 heavy. I have a bunch of tweets I want to go through, a bunch of things I want to talk about. I think it's really important that we talk about 1559, what's been happening over the last 24 hours, what to expect going forward.
00:00:29.794 - 00:00:56.034, Speaker A: Um, but, yeah, I mean, just like a little bit of color around, I guess. What, you know what my experience was, obviously, I was on the live stream with bankless. I hope a bunch of you had a chance to check that out. Uh, kind of, um, last night or yesterday, wherever you are in the world, whatever, whatever time it was for you, I think, was early, more very early morning for the US. Um, but that was really fun. Uh, we had, like, a bunch of cool people on that, on that live stream, and we watched it go live, and, I mean, everything went off without a hitch. Right? Like, it just, it worked perfectly.
00:00:56.034 - 00:01:25.044, Speaker A: There was no errors, there was no bugs or anything like that. And then we immediately started burning Ethan and, wow. Like, after, you know, two years of waiting for this kind of over two years of waiting for this day to happen, waiting for the burn to happen, it was just, I mean, the feeling was, was unbelievable. Honestly, I'd been talking about this for so long. I'd be monitoring it for so long. And, you know, it's funny because you go through different market cycles, too. I mean, when this was first proposed in, like, April of 2019, I'm pretty sure the ETH price was maybe around $200 or something like that.
00:01:25.044 - 00:01:43.586, Speaker A: Something, you know, very low compared to what it is today. And, you know, I remember thinking, wow, this is gonna, this is gonna be awesome, right? This is gonna fix the fee market. This is going to burn. ETH is going to be great. And then it took over two years to get here. So, yeah, it's just, it's just amazing to see it live. And I think the community was, was super, super excited about it.
00:01:43.586 - 00:02:01.832, Speaker A: Like, obviously, Twitter was flooded with it. The price kind of reacted to it, but not really. And, I mean, I I didn't really expect the price to do anything major around this launch. I mean, I think that in the long term, obviously, 1559 is incredibly bullish for ETH. But in the short term the markets are just silly generally. I think the markets are. Are a bit silly but yeah.
00:02:01.832 - 00:02:29.684, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess on that note as well, like just I guess around the launch here, there was a bit of. So I shouldn't say it went like 100% all good. There was a little bit of drama with the miners. Maybe not drama, but like a little bit of kind of like issues with the miners. Not all the mining pools. And the miners are not increasing their gas limit to 30 million, which they needed to do because what, Erp 1559 does, it effectively doubles the block size.
00:02:29.684 - 00:02:51.110, Speaker A: So. Well. Well it doesn't. Sorry, it doesn't double the block size or double the gas limit. It essentially makes it so blocks are only ever 50% full and then it uses the other 50% as a buffer for when the network gets congested and things like that. So what ended up happening was that the gas limit was 15 million prior to 1559 going live. And then once it went live, miners needed to change it to 30 million.
00:02:51.110 - 00:03:27.790, Speaker A: Now, this doesn't mean that we doubled the block size because. Or doubled the gas limit because as I said, it's elastic, which means that extra capacity is only used during kind of times of volatile fee markets. And, you know, and it's only used through 1559 transactions as well, because now there's two transaction types. There's the legacy and the 1559 transactions. And most of the transactions still happening on the network are legacy transactions because of the fact that most wallets don't support 1559 just yet. And I know my crypto does and a few others out there, but metamask doesn't for most people yet. I don't have the feature yet, which is a bit disappointing.
00:03:27.790 - 00:03:51.862, Speaker A: But that doesn't mean that it's not being burned. It just means that people will still be overpaying for fees. We won't get that smooth kind of like fee market that that has been promised from 1559 until we have more adoption there. So there's a few dashboards kind of like around that, tracking the adoption of that and everything. So that's really cool to see. But what ended up happening with the miners is a few of them didn't have it at 30 million. They had it at like 27 million or something like that, or something weird.
00:03:51.862 - 00:04:43.922, Speaker A: But then we got them to put it to 30 million. We, you know, we reached out to them and said, hey, you need to fix this. You need to put it to 30 million because that's kind of like how 1559 works, essentially, and you know, Vitalik put out a tweet today as well, saying he basically compared two different kind of pictures here where he said how full blocks are in a range of ERP 1559 blocks from today versus in a simulation from two months ago that assumes fairly uniform but random transaction activity and realistic block production. It actually looks pretty similar. So what this is showing, for those of you seeing on the screen, you can see this, this picture, it says on the, on the, on the y axis here, how many blocks? So, you know, what is almost 120 blocks here and then percent full on the x axis, up to like 100% full. And then you can see like, most of the blocks are almost 100% full or pretty much 100% full. And then there's basically randomization with, with the other kind of blocks here.
00:04:43.922 - 00:05:14.610, Speaker A: And that's how the, the 1559 mechanism works. And this is the, the real scenario what's happening on Mainnet. And this was the simulation which, you know, they're pretty close, which, which is really cool to see that. The simulation actually, you know, showed exactly what was going to happen on Mainnet there. So that was very cool to see. We also had our first deflationary block shortly after 1559 went live. And what this means is that basically more fees were burnt than was issued by the block reward as part of the block reward here.
00:05:14.610 - 00:05:39.814, Speaker A: So that was awesome because you can see here on the screenshot, like down the bottom, it says burnt fees, 2.07 ETH. And obviously each block reward is two ETH. So we burned more than we issued for that block. Obviously, it doesn't count for like the whole, the whole issuance. It's not like making Ethernet deflationary or anything like that for the whole kind of like, period, the whole year. But like on a per block basis, there's been a few of these now, which is, which is really awesome to see there.
00:05:39.814 - 00:05:58.010, Speaker A: The ultrasound money. Twitter account tweeted out this, this tweet today saying, e scarcity engines 6.5 million ETH staked in eight months. Defi, there's 9.5 million ETH in there in three years and eight months and burn 4.6k ETH in 24 hours. So, I mean, I think it's a bit more than that now.
00:05:58.010 - 00:06:24.738, Speaker A: I mean, it's been more than 24 hours, hours since 1559 went live. But we burn, you know, four point six K e, like 4600 ETH, which is really cool. And, you know, at time of recording, it's at 47 4776 ETH. I've got it here on my little iPad mini. I've got the, the ultrasound money website up monitoring the fees being burned there. So that's, that's really cool to see. But I think a lot of people were blindsided by this, to be honest, where they thought, wow, okay, I didn't realize that this much fee was, fees were going to be burned.
00:06:24.738 - 00:07:08.972, Speaker A: And to be fair, the network did get quite volatile. The gas fees did get quite volatile after the network, after the market activity picked up, after 155 net went live. And the, and the miners obviously had to adjust their gas limits, because by having their gas limit at like 27 million, that effectively means that the, the gas limit is, is essentially half of that, which means it was less than the 15 million that we had before. Um, you know, and that means that there's less transactions that can fit in a block and all that sort of stuff. And that's especially true because most people aren't using 1559 style transactions just yet. So we had a bit of a spike there and ETH being burned, but generally, I think that it's going to slow down in periods of just normal operation. But obviously, when the market volatility picks up, the fees pick up, and we see all that happening.
00:07:08.972 - 00:07:42.006, Speaker A: And what I'm really excited about as well is the fact that everyone doing MeV through flashbots and things like that now have to pay ETH. There's no more zero Gwei transactions on the network. You have to pay ETH as the base fee to the network, and that ETH gets burned. So we're even capturing a bit more value back from, from MeV there, which I think is super awesome. So, yeah, really, really cool to see that. And the ultrasound money account put out another tweet as well. Talking about Ultramark four here, which is Justin Drake's kind of like measure of how much we're burning compared to proof of stake issuance.
00:07:42.006 - 00:08:17.888, Speaker A: So you can see here, over the last 24 hours, we burned four times more than the proof of stake issuance. Now, obviously, we're not in proof of stake land just yet, like the beacon chain is, but the ETH one chain still exists. There's still the proof of work issuance, which is around 4.5% a year. And, you know, if we were to burn the same as we burnt today, it would be like, I think a 1% burn each year or something like that. So, probably more than that based on today's. But if you average it out, like, it's hard to, it's hard to tell because it hasn't been very long but essentially you can see here the 24 hours fee burn was, was 4500 ETH and the 24 hours proof of stake issuance was 1125 ETH.
00:08:17.888 - 00:09:01.244, Speaker A: And you know, that's just what once the merger goes through and this is why the merge is so bullish, right? Because we're going to be burning more than we're issuing and that's what is considered ultrasound money, right? So that's really cool to see. So super, super awesome tweet there from ultrasound money paradigm. Put together a really great thread of all the research pieces that Georgios and Haso have put. The Hasu have put together over the last couple years on ERP 1559. If you're still interested in digging into like how it all works at a deeper level and everything like that, you can go check out this thread. It'll be linked in the YouTube description. This is a lot of research that they did, you know, obviously long before 1559 went live and they were pretty, they were instrumental in like some of the top researchers working on this sort of stuff, which I thought was, was really, really awesome.
00:09:01.244 - 00:09:36.808, Speaker A: And you know, I don't know if they link it here, but they also had a piece where they argued that they, they thought that minors were going to, you know, remember all that drama, I guess like from a few months back where minors were saying, hey, you know, we hate 1559, we're going to do our own fork, we're going to push back against it. And I remember telling you all back then that it was just like a bluff and I'm calling their bluff and this is never going to happen. Well of course it didn't happen. Like they all came along with the fork. You know, miners don't control the chain. But you know, George Os and Hasu also put out a piece arguing that as well, saying that based on a game theoretic perspective, the best thing for miners to do would be just to accept the fork and go along with it. And they did.
00:09:36.808 - 00:10:09.974, Speaker A: I mean, and that is how it works. At the end of the day, they're just one group and you know, oh well, you know, you got a little bit of a pay cut. You still, you still have many revenue streams like including the block reward, obviously, and Mev and you know, the tip, the fee tip as well. So all those sorts of things are still going to miners and I don't think they're hurting too much. The hashrate, I mean it's funny because if you look at the hashrate, it only drops because the price dropped. So obviously the ETH price, you know, more than halved. And then the hash rate, you know, didn't, I don't think it hard, but it went down a lot and now it's trending back up because the price is going back up.
00:10:09.974 - 00:10:52.222, Speaker A: Hash rate follows price, as simple as that. And, you know, obviously, like the fee revenue was really high back in the day, but I think that they're getting lots from MeV at this point that that's making up for the lost fee revenue from the burnt ETH. So that's really, you know, the game theory was there for them to just kind of, kind of go along with it. And, you know, I'm glad that more people got to see that because I had a lot of people asking me. It's like, you know, what, the miners are against it, then how is going to happen? How is it going to work? You know, I remember saying this like, on the refuel, I'm like, guys like, the miners do not control the chain. They're such a small part of the chain and such a small part of the Ethereum governance process, and it's in their best interest to go along with the rest of the community for multiple reasons, which I won't rehash now. So, yeah, anyway, I'll link this thread in the YouTube description.
00:10:52.222 - 00:11:21.026, Speaker A: You can go check it out. Cain put out a really interesting tweet, not talking about the burn, but, but around 1559, where he said, I am less excited about 1559 being implemented than I am about the process that enabled it to happen. Rough consensus is fucking hard. And sometimes important things take years, but once they happen, the community tends to converge around them. That is Ethereum superpower. And I mean, this is it, right? I wrote about this in the deli Gray newsletter yesterday. But I think this speaks to the broader point as well.
00:11:21.026 - 00:12:07.850, Speaker A: So the first point that it speaks to is that Ethereum, the Ethereum community, is really aligned on getting these upgrades into Ethereum. Eventually, even though it takes a while, we stay the course. We get them in, we, we get it done, and, you know, achieving this kind of consensus is hard, but we stick to it and we get it all implemented. But the second thing, and what I think is actually more important from like a broader market ecosystem context, is that every successful, major upgrade that Ethereum does lessens the execution risk of Ethereum to the public, essentially. Now this you can trace this back to if you want to go back to the beacon chain, essentially. A lot of people thought that proof of stake for Ethereum would never work. Yes, a lot of people thought this, even though we had lots of testnets over the years, um, the, the, uh, the actual spec was, was formally verified and everything like that.
00:12:07.850 - 00:12:37.000, Speaker A: And, and it was, it was looked over by researchers and, and, you know, it was going to work like we knew it was going to work. Then we built it, did all the testnets, and the beacon chain went live on December 1, 2020, and it went live perfectly. Like, seriously, it didn't, there was no hiccups, there was nothing wrong with it. It was just like the most perfect launch ever. And that was, you know, obviously a huge, major upgrade, um, or, sorry, major launch. It wasn't an upgrade to ETH one, but it was a major launch. And, you know, we also had the minimum ETH required to bootstrap the chain being met as well on November 24.
00:12:37.000 - 00:13:19.080, Speaker A: So those two, those were two major things that happened that, like, lessen the execution risk. And then we had 1559 go live, which is, which is just as big because it shows that the Ethereum ecosystem can upgrade the Ethereum one chain and do these major upgrades and do them really smoothly and get them working and implement things that are, you know, for a $300 billion network. That's just absolutely incredible to me, to me, honestly. And I think that really does show the world, hey, like, yes, okay, there's execution risk with Ethereum because there's a lot of upgrades going on, but we can do these upgrades, we take our time, we do our research, we build these things, and, you know, we come together as a community and we get it done. As simple as that. Now the next major one coming is the merge, and that'll be the biggest one to date. That'll be bigger than the beacon chain launch.
00:13:19.080 - 00:14:02.090, Speaker A: That's going to be bigger than 1559. And if we get the merge done, man, like, I don't even like that de risks the entire platform so much for like, literally everyone because then, and that's the, you know, the biggest upgrade in Ethereum's history, I think, for the foreseeable future, done and dusted and, you know, and, you know, if it goes through perfectly, then, you know, I guess, like, people will look at that and be like, holy shit, like they did it sort of thing. So, I mean, that is Ethereum superpower. As Kane says here. I just couldn't be like, happier to be part of this community, honestly, after seeing this 1559 go live, you know, the Ethereum spirit is still alive and well, the culture's still there. We're still, you know, mostly all aligned on getting this stuff done. And you know, we're burning ETH.
00:14:02.090 - 00:14:45.270, Speaker A: Like, that's the most exciting thing I think, right now, is that we're finally burning ETH. And, uh, and the last tweet here about 1559. Cause I know I've gone on about it for a long time, uh, at this point. Um, but this came from Trent Van Epps, uh, who basically says, you know, it's serious. When we move to a screenshot, you may see people asking, uh, questions in relation to London 1559, such as wire gas prices high, why are priority fees higher than two way, et cetera? So he's got a kind of like breakdown here in his screenshot where he says, you know, why are base fees high? And these are a few of the reasons. There have been a few large NFT drops, which leads to congestion. Many services, such as exchanges, disable functions in, like, withdrawal functions, the deposit functions in a window around network upgrades.
00:14:45.270 - 00:15:17.976, Speaker A: So they'll be offline for a few hours. You probably got emails from your decentralized exchanges that you use. And this pent up demand is released once each platform is satisfied with the chain stability and turns those withdrawals and deposits back on. Some miners were setting the gas limit before 30 million, as I explained before, positive outcome from 1559 going live. Market volatility increase in gas prices, because obviously the market kind of like heated up around then and then. Fifth reason people are trying out the new 1559 features, sending transaction type two, sending their first burn transaction. So you might have some latent kind of like demand from that.
00:15:17.976 - 00:16:04.840, Speaker A: And then on the second part here, he says, why are priority fees higher than two nano ETH guy while interfaces are still rolling out? Obviously, most people aren't even sending 1559 transactions yet, so they can't adjust the priority fee. And gas APIs will need time to tune their algorithms for suggesting priority fees, aka tips. So, yeah, I mean, I love when Trent puts this stuff out. Like, for those of you who don't know Trent, like, I've spoken about him a lot in the past because he was behind the stateful works, 1559, NFT and the Beacon book and all that sort of stuff. But he works as an ecosystem person at the Ethereum foundation. And what that means is he's basically like a liaison between, I think, the core developers and, you know, the stuff that goes on at the EF and the community at large. And, you know, he does a really great job of just breaking all this stuff down.
00:16:04.840 - 00:16:24.198, Speaker A: So if you're not following him, definitely go follow him. He's one of my favorite people in this space. And, you know, this was just a great breakdown from him here to clear up some confusion. So. Yeah, great to see that from Trent. But, yeah, I think that's it for the 1559 talk today. You know, I think there wasn't, there actually wasn't that many updates other than 1559 that came out of the last 24 hours.
00:16:24.198 - 00:17:03.158, Speaker A: So I did want to give that a nice chunk of the refuel. But I'm going to move on to the next major thing that's being talked about over the last 24 hours, and that is regulation. Right. I'm sure you all saw this on Twitter and this just came out before, actually, but before I get into this tweet here that I've got in front of me, essentially with the regulations, what's happened is that there's two amendments to the bill to the infrastructure bill that I spoke about the other day. The First Amendment would basically exclude proof of work from the new regulations. So it would regulate proof of stake and kind of like all these other service providers like decentralized exchanges and other things like that. But it wouldn't regulate proof of work networks.
00:17:03.158 - 00:18:04.014, Speaker A: So that's obviously like, I guess, a really bad amendment because it's basically picking winners. And, and it doesn't really make sense that they would exclude proof of work from, from these kind of regulations. And the second one is from a different group of senators. The Second Amendment, amendment to the bill is from a different group of senators. And that is the, that is the positive one that we want to go through because it basically, the language is a lot better and, you know, and it's, and it's much fairer, basically. And then just before, about an hour ago from time of recording, Jeff Stein here from what was from the Washington Post, basically put out this scoop where he, where he said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been privately lobbying lawmakers against the widen Loomis Toomey crypto amendment, which is the amendment that we want as White House seeks to fend off push to limit new regulatory authorities per source is familiar. So essentially what she's doing is she's going and reaching out to these lawmakers and being like, hey, you know, you, you need to vote against this.
00:18:04.014 - 00:18:48.132, Speaker A: And I've been hearing things on my end as well that this is because they really want to squash defy before it takes off, which I think is extremely short sighted. I think it is the stupidest thing the US can do. I mean, I've spoken about this a lot on the refuel already. I think that this would be incredibly bad for DeFi if this kind of went through. And I just really think that I understand what they're doing by regulating a sector such as DeFi, because it's just, I mean, DeFi is not just only about decentralizing finance and taking power away from, from all these middlemen and big banks and things like that. It's also about just improving the financial system by like 100 x or a thousand x better than what it is today. And by the US heavily, heavily regulating it, they're going to miss out on all this economic growth that comes with Defi.
00:18:48.132 - 00:19:29.066, Speaker A: You know, if they, if they do squash it and do kind of like effectively outlaw it or basically make too many regulations, so it's hard for teams to comply. These teams are just moving. They're not going to stop building what they're building, like these entrepreneurs and these, and these founders and these teams, they want to build. They want to build Defi. So they're not just going to stick around if they can't do it in the US, they're just going to move and do it somewhere else and that economic activity is going to go away. So I think that's extremely short sighted. But the other side of this as well is that I want to kind of like, temper this by saying to that I think there was a lot of, a lot of kind of like the sky is falling rhetoric on Twitter over the last 24 hours, which I thought was a bit uncalled for.
00:19:29.066 - 00:19:57.862, Speaker A: Because if this amendment actually goes in, so let's say the bad one goes in, right? It doesn't actually go into law until 2023. So we still have like two years until this goes into law, which means that we can fight. Not we, but like, the relevant people. Sorry, not, not me. I'm obviously, I'm in Australia. I can't really do anything about this. But the relevant people can fight these, these regulations in court and they can get them amended again before it actually goes into law in 2023.
00:19:57.862 - 00:20:43.704, Speaker A: So even if this. I mean, and this is being voted on tomorrow, on Saturday, but even if this. Yeah, that does kind of go through in like the worst possible regulations, I don't know what, what's going to happen over the next two years, because essentially you're going to have every big crypto company in the US lobbying against this and basically lobbying to get it changed before it actually goes into law. Because they stand to lose a lot if it doesn't. Because could you imagine Coinbase, for example, having to end their staking services or having to do, like, extremely complex compliance on their staking services that end up costing them more than they're making from it. And they just give up on it, just like, oh, well, I mean, that's good for ethereum. It's really, really good that they can't stake on ethereum anymore because that means that we're going to have a better, decentralized staking ecosystem.
00:20:43.704 - 00:21:00.598, Speaker A: But they're not going to do that. I mean, it's not just ethereum, it's all the other networks they support as well. That is going to be a big revenue stream for Coinbase. So why would they give up on that? So. And then there's only one player. There's other players as well. There's those massive funds that have invested a ton of money into this space, like a 16 z and all the others.
00:21:00.598 - 00:21:22.500, Speaker A: They're not going to just sit idly by and let the US government put in these regulations that absolutely destroy defi. So there is light here. There is light in this tunnel, guys. Like, this isn't all doom and gloom. This doesn't mean that, you know, if this, if these bad regulation goes in on Saturday, crypto is banned. Everything's banned. You know, we're going to dump, we're going to the crypto, prices are going to crash, and we're all going to lose all our money.
00:21:22.500 - 00:21:49.994, Speaker A: That's, that's not what's going to happen. So I think just like a kind of, um, you know, tempering that, that rhetoric that I've been seeing on Twitter is important. But, yeah, I mean, I'm not even surprised that, that, uh, that, um, Yellen is doing this. Like, the incumbents are going to fight for what they're, what they're supposed to protect. Right? Like, and they're protecting the status quo. That. And then, and at the end of the day, you know, a lot of them have people paying, paying them or donating to them from like, different banking lobbies and things like that.
00:21:49.994 - 00:22:18.752, Speaker A: So I'm not going to get into the politics of it, but, yeah, I mean, this is nothing new. We've seen this plenty of times before. But I hope that the good amendment goes in rather than the bad one, because then it's just a lot easier for us to kind of like, work, you know, to get this kind of amended even further going, you know, over the next two years before it goes into law and stuff like that. So. Yeah, and then Jake Stravinsky, who I've been, I mean, talking about, he even said this. Yeah. He's like, you know, if we're taking this to court, if it passes, but don't forget, it starts to get through the house.
00:22:18.752 - 00:22:42.106, Speaker A: Even if we lose the battle this week, the war goes on. So, you know, I mean, the US isn't a dictatorship, right? Like, there's checks and balances everywhere. For things to actually pass into law, it takes quite a while. It has to go through multiple things. I mean, I'm not, I don't understand, like, the total process in the US of how things work and how they get into enshrined in law. But essentially, you can keep fighting this, you can keep fighting to change it, and if there's enough pressure put on from enough players, then it gets changed. As simple as that.
00:22:42.106 - 00:23:15.354, Speaker A: And I think that the crypto ecosystem is big enough now, and there are enough players incentivized to fight for the ecosystem to not be basically outlawed, that we're going to be okay. I really do believe that. I mean, even Jake said that, like, I remember seeing a tweet from him down before he went to bed last night, I think, where he says, don't worry, as bad as it looks, I'm pretty sure we're all going to make it. See you all tomorrow. To do this all over again. So, you know, I mean, rarely is the sky actually falling. Like, that's, that's what I like to say, especially when it comes to crypto, crypto, crypto regulations, because, you know, for all the reasons I outline and also because the US isn't the world.
00:23:15.354 - 00:23:34.178, Speaker A: Yes, it's a big chunk of crypto, big part of crypto. And yes, it has influence over other parts of the world, but at the same time, there's a lot of players in this game. It is not just a dictatorship where they can basically say, well, no, crypto is banned. That's it. You can't do anything about it. Um, you know, the US is a democracy. Uh, you know, whether, whether you believe that or not, I know some people say, oh, it's not really a democracy.
00:23:34.178 - 00:24:12.778, Speaker A: I mean, okay, whatever. Like, there are checks and balances, there are laws, you know, you have to follow and things like that. Um, you know, and, you know, if you have faith in, in the law, then, you know, you should feel better about this. But anyway, that's on the regulation front there. I've got a, I got three other things to talk about today besides this sort of stuff to round us out here, some, some more fun things to talk about. So, um, what launched? I think I covered this on, on the refuel the other day, but essentially what launched the other day was this thing called party bid. Now, the reason I'm on Zora here is because what ended up happening was that Zora were hosting an auction for a zombie crypto punk with a minimum, minimum reserve price of 500 ETH.
00:24:12.778 - 00:24:52.040, Speaker A: So essentially it wouldn't sell unless the 500 ETH reserve was met and anyone could bid on this. Now what ended up happening was that this party bid Dow essentially launched and said, hey, we're going to get all these people to bid on, on this NFT and, you know, pull their bids together and we're going to win this NFT and then we're going to fractionalize it. And every person who bidded and who put money in is going to get a piece of the zombie NFT. So we have like collective ownership of it. So what ended up happening was that party bid did end up winning. I can't remember exactly how much they spent on it, but, oh, here we go, 1144 ETH. So a lot of ETH, two and a half million dollars, something like that, if I'm doing my math correctly for this punk.
00:24:52.040 - 00:25:23.876, Speaker A: And then it immediately got fractionalized on the fractional platform. And then everyone who donate, who donated, who put money forward got a piece of the zombie punk. And technically they own, you know, the zombie punk. So. And there was like a collective kind of social contract around that saying that, you know, if you owned a piece of it, you can put it as your profile picture on, on Twitter, for example, and you can say like, I own a piece of this zombie punk. It's like a form of collective ownership, which I thought was, was just really awesome. I mean, this is something very, very unique to crypto and very awesome about crypto.
00:25:23.876 - 00:26:00.148, Speaker A: But on top of that, the party bid kind of like auction as well, was really fascinating. The final hours of it were really cool because essentially what happened, and maybe I can go to the party bid kind of website here, if I, if I search. Yeah, the party down managers party bid. But essentially what happened was that when you go on the site, you can see here in my screenshot, see all the little like icons here with the little cursors. You can see like there's an orange one, a green one, a pink one. They're all real users, like on the site at the same time as you. So essentially what happened was in the final hours, or, you know, final minutes of, um, the zombie punk bid, everyone was on there.
00:26:00.148 - 00:26:38.674, Speaker A: You could see all their curses everywhere. And people were sending messages, like setting messages on their cursor so you can like talk to each other and things like that. And it felt very like, um, it felt like you were in person, like at an auction instead of just being online. So it kind of like brought more human, um, humanness, I guess you could say, or at least, uh, more humanity to this, uh, kind of like auction process, um, to an online auction, which I thought was really, really cool as well. So, I mean, this is just awesome. I wrote a bit more about in the Daily Gwen newsletter today and a bit more about things like how web3 is just getting started and this falls into that. I think nfts, you know, blow the fall into web3 when you look at platforms like Mirror the, the blogging platform.
00:26:38.674 - 00:27:25.650, Speaker A: And there's another platform called Glass, which is a video streaming platform, which I actually might be putting the daily on refuel videos on soon. So keep an eye out for that. I'll talk more about that in the future. But essentially it allows creators to decentralize their content from these massive entities like YouTube and things like that have permanence around it because they're stored on decentralized data blockchains like Arweave and also monetized in different ways where they can issue nfts or they can basically have people owning a part of the content if they want to auction off rights to do stuff. I mean, there's so much here. The world is really our oyster here. But yeah, I thought this was just a really cool outcome where the party, party Dow participle, party bid participants won this NFT and were able to kind of claim collective ownership over it, which I thought was cool.
00:27:25.650 - 00:28:07.336, Speaker A: And on top of that, cave on from foundation here, the CEO and co founder of foundation put out this really great tweet yesterday that I actually missed until today, where he said it's increasingly clear that big temp, big temp, big tech will attempt to co op, co opt the term metaverse. In my opinion, we should fight for the integrity of the word. What defines a metaverse? Well, your digital objects belong to you. Your digital objects are portable, and your digital objects hold value. Nfts are the building blocks of the metaverse. There's no metaverse without nfts. This is something that I think I've talked about on the refiller before, how not only is big tech trying to co opt, co opt in the metaverse and things like nfts, but also some other quote unquote blockchains.
00:28:07.336 - 00:28:27.172, Speaker A: Now I'm not a fan, and I've spoken about how I'm not a fan of the flow blockchain because I don't actually consider it to be blockchain. I don't consider what they have on there to be nfts because it's centralized. There's Kyc. It's not an open platform. They don't, the kind of nfts don't truly belong to you. They're not portable. You can't send them to other kind of platforms or any apps.
00:28:27.172 - 00:28:48.210, Speaker A: You can't bridge them or whatever. And a lot of them don't really hold their value very well, to be honest. So contrast that to something like a crypto punk, which that truly belongs to you, right? It's on ethereum, so it's totally open, totally portable. You can fractionalize it if you want. As I just discussed, you can put into liquidity pool, you can trade it whenever you want. You can do anything you want. No Kyc, nothing, just straight from your ethereum wallet.
00:28:48.210 - 00:29:09.396, Speaker A: And it holds value very, very well. I mean, obviously a lot of nfts aren't going to hold value because they're just bad nfts, but, but it's something like a crypto punk does. And I think a lot of its value is definitely tied to the network that it's on. I, you know, it's part of Ethereum's culture. It's ingrained in it. And I actually know a lot of ETH rich people who have bought punks recently, and they bought it because they're like, well, you know, I'm ETH rich. This is what you do.
00:29:09.396 - 00:29:43.378, Speaker A: You buy a punk. And yes, some, some people might, may think that's like silly or gratuitous or, you know, whatever, but like, that's just the reality of the situation. Like, if you're like a hardcore ethereum, if you want to call them ETH maxis, and you have a lot of ETH and, you know, that's appreciated over time. Well, I think the punk floor is what, 54 ETH right now was like less than that, you know, just a couple days ago. It's worth you spending that money because now you own a core piece of Ethereum culture and, you know, there's not many of them. It's very, very scarce. And even if you, if you find one that looks like you, you can change it to your profile picture and show it off and things like that.
00:29:43.378 - 00:30:09.718, Speaker A: So there's so much cool stuff going on there. I mean, honestly, totally amazing. And, and I really love how Kayvon put this here. So, yeah, I really enjoyed this, this tweet from him. All right, finally. I didn't notice this just yet, but token terminal, one of my favorite websites to kind of monitor for kind of different blockchain metrics and, and things like that, also has a way to monitor governance forum activity. So you can see here that they're showing off the, the, the index car pr.
00:30:09.718 - 00:30:44.480, Speaker A: Maybe if I maximize it, you'll be able to see it. No, I think that just filled up my whole thing. But essentially you can see kind of like the activity here on, on the index co op where essentially the governance forum, you know, in the chart here and like see like, you know, the post on the side and things like that. It's a bit hard to see here. You can go on token terminal and see it for yourself. But I think this is cool because this is basically tracking something that's not on chain metric related, but is related to obviously something orthogonal to it, like a governance forum. And I think that's actually a very good thing to look at if you're kind of like trying to evaluate a project.
00:30:44.480 - 00:31:12.368, Speaker A: Because at the end of the day, a lot of these kind of projects, they may have like really good metrics on chain because of liquidity mining or something like that, where they're just paying out with token incentives, but their actual community might be non existent. So you could actually tell that by looking at these sorts of metrics. So I thought this is a really cool feature from token terminal. But yeah, that's. I think that's it for today, everyone. Just a final note, actually there is an AMA tomorrow in the daily grade Discord channel. So definitely join that.
00:31:12.368 - 00:31:28.062, Speaker A: And if you want, you can attend the AMA. It's at 11:00 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time. Whatever time that is for you guys. Be sure to ask your questions in the AMA series channel. I wasn't originally going to do it on Saturday, but. But unfortunately all my plans got cancelled because Melbourne is in another lockdown.
00:31:28.062 - 00:31:42.726, Speaker A: So I'm doing it tomorrow, like Saturday night, 11:00 p.m. You can find all the details in the Discord channel, so join that. Um, but yeah, I'm hoping to see you all there. If not, it'll be recorded, uploaded to YouTube as usual. Uh, but that is it. So thank you everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
00:31:42.726 - 00:31:48.094, Speaker A: If you haven't yet, give the video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord Channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone.
