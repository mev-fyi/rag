00:00:00.280 - 00:00:41.646, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the deliberate Way refuel, where I cap the latest news, the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host and this is the 18 December 2023 alright everyone, let's get into it. So just a friendly reminder about this competition that is currently going on that I am participating in with the Etherfi team here. I spoke about this the other day, but basically you can read all about it in this thread, which I'll link in the YouTube description below. But you have until December 24 to get your submissions in here to win some prizes. So basically the submissions include things like Twitter threads and videos where you describe why you love Ethereum, why decentralization is important for the health of the network, and what your person, what you've personally done to support it. And winners will be chosen, I believe, and announced by December 26 here.
00:00:41.646 - 00:01:18.894, Speaker A: So if you haven't participated in this yet, be sure to do so. As I said, like there are some prizes like DAP nodes, staked ETH hardware wallets and more up for grabs here. So you can go check this out. I'll link it in the thread below, in the three, in the YouTube description below. All right, so I think most of today's episode is going to focus on L2s and ethereum usage generally, and a bunch of dispelling of bad Ethereum narratives. Because I did an episode on Saturday, obviously the only news I have to cover today is from Sunday. So I figured that I would cover basically all of the stuff that I, that I saw around L2s, L2 growth, and also a thread that I did on this topic.
00:01:18.894 - 00:01:56.750, Speaker A: Because as we've seen on crypto Twitter lately, especially over the last two to three months, the narrative around Ethereum has been pretty bad. And as you guys know, I don't think narratives really mean anything for the long term narratives of narratives. Reality is reality and reality always catches up. But at the same time, reality doesn't need to catch up when it comes to ethereum growth. Reality is already here, and I've showed a lot of these metrics on the refuel before, but I just wanted to highlight this thread for you guys because it was just a basic thread that I put together highlighting the fact that all of the metrics that we use to track activity and none of these metrics are perfect. You guys know that I actually don't really like taking any of the metrics that we use in a vacuum. Like I like taking them holistically and together.
00:01:56.750 - 00:02:32.042, Speaker A: And there's obviously lots of nuance teach these metrics but if we look at every one of these metrics, we can actually see that they're all at all time highs. So I posted this thread and I basically said, you know, let's look at all of the metrics that we can track. And a lot of these came from websites like grow the pie, l two beats, ultrasound money and the Beacon chain website. But basically ethereum, Mainnet and L2 daily active addresses are at all time highs. Ethereum, Mainnet and l two transaction count all time highs. Layer two stable coin market cap all time highs L2 tvl all time highs fees paid from L2 to layer one. You know, well into all time highs.
00:02:32.042 - 00:02:56.184, Speaker A: Layer two tps and activity is at all time highs. The amount of ETH staked is at all time highs. Each supply is at its lowest level since the merge and only continuing to go down. And this kind of flies in the face of that narrative that people were pushing, saying that, oh, once activity on l two s picks up, it means that l one activity is going to go down. And that hasn't been the case at all. Activity has just picked up across the board. And you can see all the data sources that I used, I've linked them in the, in the thread as well here.
00:02:56.184 - 00:03:58.216, Speaker A: But really what I wanted to focus on was not any particular metric here, but more so the fact that different things grow for different reasons, right? And there's been this kind of meme for a few months that are, people are only using l two s because they want an airdrop or something or, or they're getting paid tokens to use it or whatever, whatever other kind of, you know, reason you want to come up with. But the funny thing about that is that even if it is true, right, which a lot of it is true, of course there's a lot of this stuff going on. It doesn't just happen on the l two s, it happens on every chain, right. Most of the use of these chains today, speculation, and there's nothing wrong with that, but to say that people are using the l two s and a farming and airdrop and a speculating, but they're using this other l one to do serious business. And not speculating is ridiculous to me because they're using the chains all the same way, basically, to speculate, right? Whether it's speculating on, on farming an airdrop, whether it's speculating on some meme coin, whether it's trying to, to essentially trade other coins on there, whether they be meme coins or others, right. You know, existing projects that have coins that you believe to be undervalued, all that sorts of stuff. It's all speculation.
00:03:58.216 - 00:04:51.398, Speaker A: And as I said, there's nothing wrong with that. And the financial system is speculative by nature in the, you know, the existing financial system and also the crypto financial system. Um, but then don't, you know, I just, I take a big issue with the fact that people will kind of try and Fud l two s and Fud Ethereum, saying that it's only a vehicle for speculation. It's like, well, everything in crypto is a vehicle for speculation, um, in the same way. And there is there's not really a distinction here, but that shouldn't be something that we look at negatively, and I don't look at it negatively at all. I've always said for a long time now, even back in the into the ether days when I was doing that podcast with Eric Connor, we always said that people who find speculation in crypto gross just don't understand that. Speculation is the main growth driver of crypto, and it always has been and probably always will be, because when it comes to ain't really anything even outside of crypto speculation or not, there's always some kind of, like, carrot or, you know, on a stick, basically.
00:04:51.398 - 00:05:19.440, Speaker A: There's always some kind of motivation that someone has, or I guess, like, incentive that someone has to do something in the financial system. There are so many teaser offers, for example, from banks, you know, so let's say you have a mortgage. The banks are all going to give you teaser offers. Like, I'll come join with our bank, you know, refinance with us, refinance your mortgage, and you'll get a better rate. Right? I know in the US, it's. It's a bit different because the US is predominantly fixed rates. But in Australia, we have variable rates, which is the predominant way people get mortgages.
00:05:19.440 - 00:05:49.136, Speaker A: So if you come up and you've, you know, maybe you locked in a fixed rate for, like, two years, and then it's expired, and then you're. You go to a variable rate, but the bank is offering you a worse rate than some other bank. Well, then you're going to another bank because they're offering you a better rate, right? There is an incentive there. And then there are also things like credit card points, right? That people, you know, people use credit cards because they get points. There's airline miles. You know, there's all these kind of different things that really do start to look like tokens, if you. I mean, they're not tokens in the sense that they're not freely tradable and freely speculative on a global market.
00:05:49.136 - 00:06:09.472, Speaker A: You can't speculate them on a global market, but at the end of the day, they act the same way. There are this kind of incentive that people want to farm. You know, people, people are literally, like, if you want to use the same terminology, people literally farm credit card points. They farm airline miles. Right. And the more they get, obviously, the more they can do with it. And obviously, because it's not trading, there's no, there's no real speculative value attached to it.
00:06:09.472 - 00:06:31.538, Speaker A: For the most part, there is some kind of isolated speculative value here. But then you can look at stuff outside of that as well. Like, look at all the hyped up sneaker drops, for example. Right? When, if you want to compare it to nfts, a lot of people will buy these sneakers and resell them for many multiples. It's the same thing that what happens in crypto, you get, uh, you know, you found these tokens and you try to sell them for many multiples. You speculate on them. So this exists everywhere.
00:06:31.538 - 00:07:17.066, Speaker A: And I, obviously, this is not something that's, um, but is a secret, and that needs to be, I guess, like, explained in plain English, like I am. But I think it's worth adding the context to what I'm talking about here is the fact that, like, all of these systems that we use within crypto, most of the reason people, people use them, especially new people, is the fact that they're able to speculate. They're able to buy into things that could potentially make them money. Now, speculation doesn't imply that you're always going to win, and actually, most of the time, you will lose speculating. I mean, that's just the way the game works. But, yeah, that bad narrative that I've seen perpetuated around Ethereum and l two is people saying, you know, it's just people farming airdrops, is ridiculous to me. And the other bad narrative that I see also that gets perpetuated is that people saying that Altoos aren't Ethereum, which is completely wrong and makes zero sense to me.
00:07:17.066 - 00:07:49.200, Speaker A: L two s are, of course, Ethereum. Yes. Okay. Like, admittedly, most of them are centralized today, right? Most of them have centralized sequences that have multi sigs that, you know, they're, they're permissioned fraud proving and stuff like that. But unless you believe that, that's always going to be the case, which I don't believe at all, obviously. And unless you believe that, like, that, those controls are never getting removed, then that. You can't really say that it's not Ethereum because even if those controls are in place forever, it's the same as if a smart contract on Ethereum for a Defi app had an admin key behind it.
00:07:49.200 - 00:08:11.244, Speaker A: Like, are you going to say that's not on Ethereum? Right. It just, it boggles the mind, the narratives people come up with in order to basically fight Ethereum with. So that's another one. That's another really bad one that I've seen when it comes to l two s. And also people just saying, like, oh, you know, l two suck. We should have scaled the l one. It's like, okay, if you have that opinion, like, you can go and join other ecosystems that are trying to scale an l one.
00:08:11.244 - 00:08:58.499, Speaker A: Like, it doesn't matter if about my opinion on whether this is wrong or right way to do it. Doesn't matter if it's, you know, there's obviously monolithic versus modular. It doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong here. If you don't agree with Ethereum's modular roadmap and it's l two, roll up centric roadmap, then go to another ecosystem, you know, you don't have to stay on Ethereum, right? You don't have to stay within the Ethereum ecosystem, but you do because, I mean, there's not that many other ecosystems out there that will let you speculate at the end of the day. Like, that goes back to our saying before about how the main use case of a lot of this stuff is still very speculative. And the last thing I want to. Wanted to bring up with regards to, I guess, like bad narratives that I've seen with regards to ethereum and l two s is the bad narrative around, or I guess, like the false equivalents that people do where they compare, you know, their favorite l one to Ethereum l one.
00:08:58.499 - 00:09:29.970, Speaker A: Like, for example, I've always been annoyed at the comparison between Solana and Ethereum l one because Solana is optimizing to be an execution layer, right? So when you're an Ethereum l one is not optimizing for that at all. It's actually abandoned most of the, I guess, like upgrades that would make it a better execution layer. And it has pushed those out many years. If they're going to do any upgrades, like, let's just say adding parallelization to the evm on l one and adding local fee markets, right. Those kind of things. It's all being pushed up to l two. That's part of the Ethereum roadmap.
00:09:29.970 - 00:10:03.778, Speaker A: So realistically, you shouldn't compare Solana to a theorem l one. You should compare it to the l two s. And people do this with the gas fee comparison. They're like, oh, it cost me dollar 50 to swap a token on a theorem, which it doesn't actually cost that most of the time, but people will say that, right? There's like a $50 to do on ethereum l one, but it cost me like a, you know, a penny or less on, on Solana. It's like, okay, that that's fine, but, like, at least to a fair comparison here, at least compare it to l two s. And yes, l two s are still more expensive than, than Solana is, right, for various different reasons. But it's a massive false equivalence to compare it to ethereum l one.
00:10:03.778 - 00:10:36.342, Speaker A: When ethereum l one is not trying to be that, right? It's so dumb. Like, I don't understand, like, whether these people don't understand that that's the wrong comparison to make, or they're just trying to fight Ethereum with whatever narrative they can come up with. That's always something that's really annoyed me, is that people making that comparison there, because they're not the same thing. You're not doing an apples to apples comparison here, and you're really watering down the discourse by doing this, because it means that people get confused. They don't know what to think, and the bad narratives just, just perpetuate. But as I've shown in this thread here, that I'll link in the YouTube description below, the narratives are the narratives, and reality is reality. People are still using the l two s.
00:10:36.342 - 00:10:57.438, Speaker A: They still using l one. There's still a lot of demand for Ethereum. There's still a lot of demand for ETH as an asset. Obviously, ETH as an asset is really big. So it hasn't performed as well as other assets into over the last, you know, maybe let's say six months or something like that. But these other assets also went down a lot more than ETH did during the bear market. And that's another thing that people miss a lot when they compare ETH to other assets.
00:10:57.438 - 00:11:41.672, Speaker A: It's like, okay, if you actually look at the chart, I actually did this comparison that in the daily gray Discord channel the other day because I was looking at everyone saying, oh, you know, Seoul has performed better than ETH, blah, blah, blah. But the thing is, it depends on where you buy these assets right now. I went, I went over this on Saturday. It depends on where you buy these assets. So people saying that again, it's just a really bad narrative because unless you bought the bottoms and sold the top and, you know, the best trader ever and you know, out trading everyone and having 100% hit rate on your trades, you most likely didn't outperform. And that I guess like sets a bad narrative for people who are chasing these things thinking that they're gods, thinking that they can, they can outperform, thinking that they can outsmart everyone, when in reality you can't. And I actually mentioned a few days ago I was watching the markets.
00:11:41.672 - 00:12:05.218, Speaker A: Like, I usually don't, don't speculate too much on short term markets stuff because short term market stuff's obviously not my wheelhouse and not something that I play. I'm not a trader. But I said like, I think three days ago in the daily way discord channel that I was looking at all the craziness going on. I'm like, guys, like, I feel like this craziness is unsustainable at this point. I feel like the market's due for a bit of. A, bit of a cool off here. And it has, it's cooled off over the last two to three days, especially today, it's cooled off a little bit.
00:12:05.218 - 00:12:27.390, Speaker A: But that's a short term thing, like a long term thing. I still think the bull market is definitely intact. You know, there's no end of the bull market here or anything like that. But I mean, that's market stalking. If I, if I start talking about that again, it's probably going to go, be going on tangents there. But yeah, hopefully that gives you some extra context around the bad narratives around Ethereum and l two s and how they're really just all narratives, they're all crap. It doesn't really match with reality.
00:12:27.390 - 00:12:59.716, Speaker A: But you can go check out this thread, I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But there are a bunch of other things I want to talk about with regards to l two s as well. And one of them was the fact that we have another l one becoming an l two using zksync stack. So a Zk sync stack, that's hard to say. So the l one network kronos chain, uh, so which is supported by crypto.com, is embracing Zkstack and joining the Zksync hyperchain network on Ethereum. Uh, apparently they've got more than $350 million in Defi TvL, um, which obviously isn't big, but it's still something.
00:12:59.716 - 00:13:56.584, Speaker A: And the fact that they're converting from an l one to an l two just continues that trend of all of these l one s, basically capitulating and saying, well, we think we can work better as an l two, so we're going to become an l two. And that's, you know, that's exactly what's happening here on the, the long tail of l one s. As I've said before, I think that most of the, if not all of the bigger l ones, the ones that have, like, more rabid, I guess, like, invisible communities and the ones that have, like, bigger market caps are not going to become an l two anytime soon. And those would include something like Solana, obviously, avalanche, Cardano, Polkadot to an extent, and, you know, a few others out there. But other than that, the long tail of the l one s, I mean, if they want to survive at all, if they want to get any attention or traction at all, then, yeah, I feel like it really makes sense for them to move across to an, to an l two here. But anyway, you can check out Zksync's tweet about this. I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you to do so.
00:13:56.584 - 00:14:26.676, Speaker A: All right. So over the last few days, inscriptions have really, I guess, like, exploded on evm chains. Now, for those of you who don't know, inscriptions started on bitcoin. It's basically a way to create nfts on bitcoin, really, and create tokens on bitcoin. It is a really dirty way to do it. It is not in any way superior or even on par with how it's done on, I guess, like native smart contract chains, like Ethereum. But obviously, because you can't do that on bitcoin, people are doing it through inscriptions.
00:14:26.676 - 00:14:52.510, Speaker A: And there was a whole kind of speculative mania around it. But as I said, lately, people have been doing it on EVM chains, which is totally pointless. It makes absolutely no sense to do this because you don't need to do it. You can just do it with smart contracts natively on the chain, but because there's a lot of hype around it, because there's a lot of, a lot of money potentially to be made here. And there's a, there's a strong narrative around that people, people are doing this. So inscriptions hit a lot of chains over the weekend. It hit arbitrum one really hard.
00:14:52.510 - 00:15:31.286, Speaker A: And actually, as I think I explained this on Saturday, arbitrum one ended up going offline briefly because of it. The sequencer went offline at least because of it. They also hit Zksync error, which I believe stayed up through all of it. But both of these chains ended up peaking at a couple hundred, I think, TPS, and doing processing all of these inscriptions transactions. But it really, I mean, I said on Saturday that people were spamming the chain with inscriptions transactions, and I didn't mean to say that it's spam. It's just that like, they were hitting the chain with a lot of these transactions, right? And it wasn't just like one chain, it was many EVM chains. And as I said, because there's a lot of speculative mania behind this.
00:15:31.286 - 00:15:55.454, Speaker A: And also, I mean, it's kind of really pointless to do because of the fact that you're much better off just doing it natively using the smart contracts here. But you can see Saiga's tweet thread about this. It's actually a really, really great tweet thread. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But essentially, if you don't know what inscriptions are, the tweet here explains this saying. The concept of inscriptions started with bitcoins, ordinals. Ordinals allow data to be inscribed directly on chain.
00:15:55.454 - 00:16:28.840, Speaker A: This can be text, images, videos, et cetera. This is the only way for bitcoin to add support for nfts and other tokens, since it doesn't support smart contracts. And then of course, people realize they could do the same thing on Ethereum and other EVM based chains instead of inscribing data on individual sats. Or I guess the individual bitcoin sats. EVM inscriptions inscribed data in transaction call data and call data is actually what's used by l two s as well, to put their data on l one. And you can see here, core data is optional data that can be sent in a transaction most of the time. This data is used when passing inputs to smart contracts.
00:16:28.840 - 00:17:00.834, Speaker A: It's also used for roll up data. Coredata is read only and cheap to use, especially when compared to storing data in smart contract state. Now, of course, we have 4844 coming as well, which is going to add blobs. And I think I mentioned this on, on Saturday's episode as well, that I think inscriptions are going to hit blobs too, which is sad because it means that at least over the short term, blobs are going to get really expensive, I would imagine, right? Because people are going to be, I guess, hitting them with inscriptions and then people are going to be speculating on it. But at the end of the day, the l two s are still going to be buying that blob space. They can afford it. They can.
00:17:00.834 - 00:17:32.064, Speaker A: They can probably pay a higher gas fee than any of the people doing the inscription stuff can. But it's. It's sad because there's actually no way to really prevent this, just the way the roll ups work. You couldn't prevent someone from doing inscriptions on. On core data, and you can't prevent them from doing it on blobs. But at the end of the day, it's an economic thing where essentially, the l two or the roll up will have a lot more money to spend because they're aggregating, um, you know, uh, lots of users transactions together, and charging users for that, they'll have a lot more money to spend to outbid anyone for the blobs. And we do have that blob sharing protocol as well.
00:17:32.064 - 00:17:55.476, Speaker A: And then with the l two s as well, because they're. The way they post their data to l one is done in an automated fashion. It's, you know, it can be done at whatever time they want to do it at. Essentially what can happen is that the. The roll ups and the l two s can essentially, if they want to wait for cheaper blobs, essentially, they could. They can do it on the off hours, basically, when the humans aren't online and stuff like that. So there's a lot of that stuff at play there.
00:17:55.476 - 00:18:21.162, Speaker A: But I'm curious to see what happens there with. With blobs now that inscriptions has become a thing. But as I said, like, it's. It's kind of hilarious because there's literally no benefit of doing this on EVM chains, you know, because you can do it natively already. The only real benefit is. Is a very short term benefit where. Because there's so much speculation around these things, because the word inscriptions, because the word ordinals has led to speculative mania, this is the reason people are doing it.
00:18:21.162 - 00:18:51.506, Speaker A: And honestly, if I had to kind of guess here, this may be the end of the speculative mania here, because this is just ridiculous. You know, usually when you say ridiculous stuff happening, that makes absolutely no sense, like meme coins pumping 100% or 200% in a day or something. When you see stuff like that, it tends to be like a local top on these kind of things. Because what happens is that you end up tapping into all of the available liquidity and all of the available speculative kind of energy, and you bring it all forward. It's like taking on a debt from the future, essentially, and you bring it all forward. Now that debt needs to be paid. Back one way or another.
00:18:51.506 - 00:19:20.336, Speaker A: And the way it's usually paid back is that things get sold off. Right. You know, the very popular meme coin bonk that, that had gone up a lot is down like 45% in three days, I think. So if you had bought the top, you're down almost half of your money in three days. So this is what I mean by it takes from the future, basically, and brings all that speculation forward. But because, and this is how markets work generally. This is why bull markets have blow off tops, usually because it just brings all of it forward and then it's unsustainable.
00:19:20.336 - 00:19:45.704, Speaker A: And then we kind of like sell off and, you know, you guys know the rest of what happens there. But anyway, as I said, go read this thread from saiga. It is a really, really great explanation of what has been going on with inscriptions on EVM chains. All right? And actually, this is also about inscriptions. Hunter here from off chain labs shared that arbitram one hit an all time high of 4.3 million transactions during this inscriptions event. But cooler numbers.
00:19:45.704 - 00:20:23.604, Speaker A: But, but he says the cooler numbers was the incredible support that came from the other l two s and L1 S for the arbitrary community, obviously because their sequencer went offline or briefly went offline because it basically suffered a DOS attack, essentially. So there will be a post mortem here. But what I'm speculating on is that the sigma so just got hit all of a sudden with a flood of transactions from inscriptions. It couldn't handle it. It fell over and then just came back online shortly after and then was able to process the transactions and has been processing them just fine since then. As I said, the post mortem will probably be out this week, but that's what I'm speculating that it was. But, yeah, cool to see that they were able to process the transactions once they came back online here.
00:20:23.604 - 00:21:09.780, Speaker A: All right. Data always posted a nice little graphic here where they captioned that with the most important ethereum flipping from this year, if ethereum is successful, long term users won't be sending ETH on mainnet. Now, the chart here, or the graph shows that the amount of l one ETH transfers versus l two total usage. And obviously this is the kind of, I guess like, this is the thesis here is that most people, in terms of, like, number of, I guess, numbers of activity that's happening, number of ETH transfers, stuff like that that's happening, will happen, will be done on l two s rather than l one. L1 will be reserved for the large kind of scale operations, the large scale kind of transactions, stuff like that. And l two will be everything else, basically. But l two will also be the large scale stuff.
00:21:09.780 - 00:21:47.956, Speaker A: Like, for example, if you have like $100 million on l two as a whale, you can move it just the same and play around with it just the same as you can on l one. But because l two s are still relatively new, they've got a lot less liquidity and a lot less TvL generally, and obviously are still quite centralized. The big players tend to stay on l one still because they can afford the gas fees. I mean, if you, if you're playing with, with even like a million dollars, right, you can afford the gas fees. Like, it's completely fine. Um, but at the end of the day, like, if, if l two has enough activity on her and l two has enough liquidity and enough, uh, stuff to do on it, the people will move across anyway. But, yeah, generally.
00:21:47.956 - 00:22:25.362, Speaker A: I mean, the long term thesis is that l one will be a settlement layer for high value transfers, high value transactions, high value kind of settlement, whatever it is. And a lot of that will be l two related. But it could be really anything of high value. Because really, if fees are going to be perpetually, not perpetually, like at the same kind of like fee level, but if they're gonna be like always high relative to what most of users can afford, and that really is not that high. I mean, if you want to take the, in the entire globe, like, mo, most people couldn't even afford even, even like a few $0.01 fees or anything like that. Like when you really take the whole globe and you want to appeal to, like, every, every person, you have to kind of look at that.
00:22:25.362 - 00:22:43.178, Speaker A: And most people wouldn't be able to afford that. That's why I've said that the future of l two fees is actually free, because that's how you appeal to the, to the whole world here. But l one is never going to be free. It's never going to be anywhere near free, right? That's just the way the l one works. And that's just the way a theorem, l one works, I should say. Other l ones may try and do it. You know, good luck to them.
00:22:43.178 - 00:23:14.998, Speaker A: But the l two s, the, the main goal, at least for some of them, will, will be to be, you know, very, very cheap and near free in the short term, because maybe they put their data off chain. It's not on Ethereum, l one, but then there'll be other l two s that are like, you know, the main defi chains and stuff like that. That may be a bit more expensive because they don't want to sacrifice anything. They want to have all their data on Ethereum, l one, which will be a little bit more expensive, but then maybe in a few years when we roll out full dank sharding, it becomes even cheaper. And it isn't expensive anymore. It isn't like a little bit more expensive anymore. It basically becomes free as well.
00:23:14.998 - 00:23:54.814, Speaker A: So we'll have to see how that kind of pans out there. But yeah, I just thought this was an interesting chart that I figured was worth highlighting on the refuel here and you can go check this out for yourself. I don't know if there's a blog post to back this up, um, but they have a substack at data always dot substack.com that has a lot of really, really great insights here that you can actually go and subscribe to. So they put out a lot of, a little, a lot of good data based insights based on a wide range of things, you know, such as restaking proof of stake generally, you know, l two stuff and so on and so forth. Not regularly posted, but definitely whenever they post it is a really, really great, really, really great read. So you should definitely go check that out.
00:23:54.814 - 00:24:27.562, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you to do so. So Ericsson here today has unveiled something called Ether GPT. So essentially what this is is that a custom chat GPT with knowledge scraped from various Ethereum research forums. And you can go check this out, I'll link in the YouTube description below. But you can basically, I guess, like ask this, this bot or ask this AI anything you want about Ethereum and it will answer it for you. Now, of course it's not going to be 100% accurate yet, depends on the data that it's been trained on. And it will always of course, get better over time, hopefully.
00:24:27.562 - 00:25:05.888, Speaker A: But yeah, if you're curious about anything that Ericsson has kind of listed here, such as L2s, sharding economics, proof of stake, ZK stocks and snarks, then this chat GPT is actually crawled the e three search forum for all these things and you can go and ask it questions here. So yeah, I'll link this in the YouTube description below for you to go ask the questions if you have some. And yeah, I mean, maybe I, maybe I should ask a question live here. So what is Mev is one of my favorite questions to ask these bots. For some reason I always just default to that. Yep, straight away MeV stands for minor extractable value, such and so on and so forth. So, I mean, this is an easy kind of question to answer, I think, for, for the AI here.
00:25:05.888 - 00:25:39.554, Speaker A: But yeah, you can see how it's just answering it for me here, going through everything, this is the kind of stuff that I love, that I love seeing, because obviously I want to see more education within the ethereum ecosystem. And a lot of the formal stuff is definitely buried in research forums. So if we can scrape those and just have a chat bot that you can talk to about these things, then obviously that's going to be a huge benefit here. But as I said, like, there's not just Ericsson's, there's also buddhas, which I talked about, I think, last week. There's also one for here from Varun, which is linked in the replies here to the, to the tweet. You can go check that out for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description for you to do so.
00:25:39.554 - 00:25:56.970, Speaker A: But I think on that note, that's going to be for today. I know it's a bit of a shorter episode, but as I said, because I didn't episode Saturday, there wasn't much news to cover, obviously, because I'm only really covering Sunday today. But yeah.

00:25:56.970 - 00:25:58.634, Speaker A: Thanks everyone. Bye.
