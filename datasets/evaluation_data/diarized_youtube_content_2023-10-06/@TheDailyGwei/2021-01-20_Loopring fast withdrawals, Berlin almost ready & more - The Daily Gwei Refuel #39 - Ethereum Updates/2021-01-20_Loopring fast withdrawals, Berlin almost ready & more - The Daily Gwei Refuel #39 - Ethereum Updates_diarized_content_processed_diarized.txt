00:00:00.520 - 00:00:22.678, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gray Refuel, where I recap the latest news neo theorem ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cesano, and today's the 20 January 2021. All right, everyone, let's get into it for today. So just a quick shout out here. We crossed 1000 subscribers on the Daily Grey YouTube channel. So thank you to all of you who have subscribed. If you haven't yet, be sure to hit that subscribe button.
00:00:22.678 - 00:00:35.466, Speaker A: It's really humbling, you know, 1000. I started this a few weeks ago. It's really great. All the comments coming in. I love reading them. I love getting all the feedback. You know, you can always feel free to dm me on Twitter and give me any feedback that you, that you want there.
00:00:35.466 - 00:00:57.022, Speaker A: But yeah, I have big plans for the channel. Obviously, I'll keep doing the daily refuels. I'm going to be doing the daily grade data pumps as well. I'm not doing this month's, for various reasons. I'm going to do next month, which covers December and January. But the first episode that I did in December is actually out and you can go watch that. You can find it on the channel.
00:00:57.022 - 00:01:18.462, Speaker A: And that just basically does like on chain analysis on Ethereum and within Defi. So I'm going to be doing one in February that goes over December and January, which were big months. You know, we had ETH two go live. So I'm going to be looking into that. But that's going to be really exciting. So be sure to subscribe so you don't miss that, of course. And yeah, I've got a bunch of other videos that I have planned as well, just finding the time to make them.
00:01:18.462 - 00:02:06.586, Speaker A: I really want to make some, some noob friendly videos for the, basically everything in Ethereum, I think, you know, I was looking through YouTube and there doesn't seem to be a very good, what is Ethereum video? A lot of them are dated. A lot of them kind of like use old terminology. A lot of them don't even talk about Defi. So I really just want to make, you know, these videos where I basically sit here like I do on the refuels. I go through like a slide deck and I just, you know, kind of give a lecture, I guess you could call it on, on these sorts of things. I also want to do video Ama's on discord as well, where we can all just join, you can join a call, you can ask, you know, ask me anything you want and I'll be happy to answer it. And then we can all kind of learn together, because the whole point of the daily Gwei and everything that I do, even at ETH Hub, is to educate, and I want to do as much of that as possible.
00:02:06.586 - 00:02:39.814, Speaker A: So, yeah, definitely look forward to seeing more of that on. On the channel within the discord with, you know, on Twitter, of course, and everything like that. So be sure that you join the Discord channel, too, so you don't miss that. And you can ask me questions in there anytime you want as well. All right, so saddle finance launched today, and this actually caused quite a stir within the community because what saddle is, it's a new amm specialized for pegged value crypto assets, assets like tokenized bitcoin and stablecoins. Essentially, it is like curve. Pretty much exactly like curve.
00:02:39.814 - 00:03:21.754, Speaker A: So much like curve that they actually, I think, copied a lot of the code over. You can see Michael here, the founder of Curve, asking them why they copied the math one to one and exploring the limits of IP laws when you could just derive the math for the same outcome. And, yeah, I mean, there was a bit of drama here. Julian also works for the curve team. He kind of had a go at Matt Lungo, who's of an advisor to saddle finance here. So, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, we've had this discussion before on the refuel, and I wrote about it in the newsletter with the Sushiswap Uniswap drama where you can't copy something that's open source. I know that some parts of curve's code is not, like, totally open source.
00:03:21.754 - 00:03:40.750, Speaker A: You know, compounds code is copyrighted. So that. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about, like, actual open source stuff. Now, I think what Michael is implying here is that saddle didn't actually copy the parts that are copyrighted or, like, under those kind of ip law protection. They. They, you know, they're pushing the limits of that.
00:03:40.750 - 00:04:02.382, Speaker A: But basically, the design is very similar. They're launching something that already kind of exists. So people are kind of questioning, you know, why. Why does this have to exist? Like, why do we need this when we already have. Have curve, which does the exact same thing? And I get that. I mean, you know, there's always room for more. It's like asking, you know, why does sushi swap exist when we have uniswap? Well, you know, I've already.
00:04:02.382 - 00:04:27.154, Speaker A: I've talked about this in the past. You know, sushi swap is doing different things. They're innovating in different areas. They're taking a different approach. Right? They, they're taking a community first approach, whereas Uniswap's taking a more like, you know, team first approach where they build a lot of the things in private, then release certain sort of stuff like that. So, you know, there's always room for more. But at the same time, it just, I mean, curve is huge, right? And it's loved by a lot of people.
00:04:27.154 - 00:04:46.540, Speaker A: It's already being used so massively. They're innovating rapidly. So, yeah, there was a question kind of around that for sure. And then here you can see that they had a lot of top tier investors as well. So, you know, all these people tagged here are investors and there's angels too. It's just crazy. Like, look at the amount of people here.
00:04:46.540 - 00:05:16.520, Speaker A: Like high frame. I mean, framework ventures, very popular defi investor, polychain, very, very popular investor in crypto, in general Electric capital, same thing. And then there's a bunch of angels in here. You know, you have, I mean, other funds like Alameda research is part of FTX, Coinbase, right? Dragonfly Cap. I mean, you basically got the who's who of funds and then you have the who who's who of angels. Like Kane from Synthetix. You have Linda, Linda Shay, which part of Scala Capital, actually, so that's a fund.
00:05:16.520 - 00:05:43.108, Speaker A: You have Robert Leshner through Robot Ventures, which is his fund. Spencer Noon, Andrew Kang. I mean, the list goes on, right? Like there are so many kind of people here now. I think actually I might be getting a little bit confused. I don't know if they're tagging them in there to kind of bring attention to this new app or, or if they're actually investors. Maybe they're not all investors, but I'm fairly certain that all these funds are investors or advisors. You know, here's Matt Longo here.
00:05:43.108 - 00:06:14.294, Speaker A: He's, he's an advisor. So, you know, they have the who's who of like the american crypto crowd on, on board here. And that's another red flag for people. You know, some people were calling it basically a heavily, you know, VC kind of version of curve, which, I mean, maybe, but curve also has VC's and did an investment round before they went live and, and all that stuff. So I don't know, it gets messy, right? People obviously don't like VC's in crypto for one reason or another. Not everyone. I have nothing against VC's.
00:06:14.294 - 00:06:44.954, Speaker A: I mean, I do angel investing myself as well. Like, you know, I have nothing against that sort of stuff. But, you know, there are certain ways you can do it, which feels better than other ways. Obviously, the community doesn't resonate with projects that come out of the gate, right. Copying another project, essentially, and raising money from, like, you know, the who's who of funds within the space without, you know, having a product live, doing a community kind of led thing. And this is going to be a very powerful narrative going forward. I mean, sushiswap is succeeding, and he's.
00:06:44.954 - 00:07:25.342, Speaker A: And he's growing so quickly because of the fact that it's community first. And, you know, maybe this doesn't matter in the end because, you know, community is an important part, but it's not the only part of a product. But at the end of the day, you know, you kind of got to expect this backlash if you do this sort of stuff. And I'm not trying to say that the project's bad or it's not going to succeed or anything, but I totally sympathize with this, like, 100%, because no one wants their project to get forked or copied. Right. And especially by, you know, maybe, I guess they view this as kind of like a syndicate of like, all these investors just jumping on the train to make some money. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but that's what, you know, some people think that they are doing or what it feels like.
00:07:25.342 - 00:07:57.052, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's all about how you frame this sort of stuff. You can frame it in a positive light, a negative light. I'm sure if this went live, right, the app was out there, it had use for a while, blah, blah, blah. And then they said they raised money and they announced the raise, and then they gave tokens to the community, everything. It would have gone down completely differently, but because it's so closed off and no one knew about this project till today, right. It wasn't public till today. People feel kind of like blindsided by it, and they also feel kind of like, well, I like curve, and this project feels like insider.
00:07:57.052 - 00:08:25.898, Speaker A: I don't really want to support it. So there's a lot of that. And then on top of that, there was actually something that happened with the contract. It wasn't an exploit. I think there wasn't enough liquidity in their Amm exchange. So what ended up happening was that some, some savvy trader ended up arbing this and made, I think they made a profit of, what, $148,000 here. I think from what I can see here, from what I'm understanding, yeah, I don't think that was.
00:08:25.898 - 00:08:55.558, Speaker A: It was an exploit, but I think that it was obviously not something that they implemented correctly on the product. So that just added kind of fuel to the fire. Right. As well. So, yeah, I mean, I woke up to this and I was trying to follow along and there was just so much drama. And then a couple hours later, people stopped talking about it and I was like, okay, and then we're on to the next thing. There's a bit of drama around EIP 1559 and miners, as I discussed yesterday on yesterday's refuel, I won't rehash it here, but there was a lot going on there.
00:08:55.558 - 00:09:23.104, Speaker A: So never a dull day in crypto, right. This is just really, really funny to see how it all plays out. Right. You know, being an observer in crypto and not getting involved in the debates, like all the debates, is actually quite entertaining, for better or worse, because there's just always something new going on. So, yeah, there's, that's, that's subtle finance. You know, maybe they, you know, they, they succeed, they get volume, they get liquidity. We'll see how it goes.
00:09:23.104 - 00:10:05.436, Speaker A: But obviously a very, you know, dramatic launch, I guess you could say. So Spencer noon put out this really great tweet thread today. He puts these out from time to time, but he basically starts it with eleven signs ETH is going to blow past its all time high. And he has basically eleven tweets here with different ethereum metrics and how, you know, how rapidly it's been growing. Now, I'm not going to go through them all, but basically you can see here that Ethereum is basically the network that settles the most transaction fees, which we've spoken about on the refill before. The hashrate is at an all time high. The miners are confident, even though that, I guess, like we're going off proof of work soon.
00:10:05.436 - 00:10:35.602, Speaker A: This is because miners follow the money. As I explained yesterday, they're pure service providers, you know, profit maximalist because they have to be because they've got costs to cover. So of course they're going to come into the network when the ETH price is going up and the fees are like ridiculous, like the fee revenue. Um, there are more than 1.25 million DeFi users. I do want to clarify this is, and I've mentioned this on the refill before, but this is what I was talking about when I said there was 1.25 million addresses that had interacted with DeFi protocols.
00:10:35.602 - 00:10:56.642, Speaker A: And this doesn't cover every single defi protocol, but it covers the major ones, so it gives you a pretty good idea. But as I've said before, people have multiple addresses, right? You have to basically halve this, right. And then you can probably have it again and get to like 250 or something like that. Or 300,000 defi users. So still incredibly tiny there. And then. Yeah, a bunch of other stats here.
00:10:56.642 - 00:11:24.496, Speaker A: Monthly Dex volumes at all time highs. I'll go through that later on, actually. Yeah, and a bunch more here. I'll link this thread for you to check out. And you can also subscribe to Spencer's newsletter called our network, which publishes a weekly kind of newsletter with a bunch of different projects and on chain analytics going on there and all these sorts of things so you don't miss them. Um, but yeah, we'll uh, we'll, we'll see how it goes there. And there's this funny comment that I just, I just read here.
00:11:24.496 - 00:11:50.628, Speaker A: This all gets negated if BTC decides to dump, which sucks. And that's exactly what, what happened today. BTC decided to dump and, and ease decided to dump with it. Uh, but I mean, that, that's a short term kind of stuff. This is looking at the macro scale of things and like east fundamentals and the Ethereum networks fundamentals that are going to mean that Ethereum keeps growing and ETH keeps going up in price. So really great thread from Spencer here. If you're not following him, go give him a follow.
00:11:50.628 - 00:12:31.114, Speaker A: He's, he's really great. He's been around the ecosystem for quite a while. And definitely go subscribe to the, our network and newsletter. So James Hancock, the ETH one hard fork coordinator, is part of the core dev team put out that the Berlin network upgrade coming for Ethereum, the next network upgrade is almost ready. You can see it here that all the eips going in are pretty much finished for every, every major client except EIP 29 30 for Geth, which I am assuming that. Oh well, and there was a correction here that 20 718 hasn't been merged for Geth either. So yeah, two green checks, which I'm assuming are going to be done promptly.
00:12:31.114 - 00:13:31.218, Speaker A: And what this means is that the clients are ready to do the network upgrade. So we should see this go live within a matter of over the next maybe, you know, I guess normally, you know, it's a, it's probably like a couple of months because, or like a few weeks because you got to give people notice, right, to upgrade their clients, you got to make sure that everyone changes over and kind of update so that we can have this network upgrade go through. Because it is a hard fork, but I tend to not like using the term hard fork because in crypto it basically means contentious network split because we all saw what happened with bitcoin and bitcoin cash, then bitcoin, bitcoin sv, there's been a bunch of other forks that go on and a hard fork is normally negative. So that's why I call it a network upgrade, because this is not contentious. This is bringing in aips that kind of like improve the network, make things better for both developers and users and the health of the network. So yeah, really great to see that we're almost there. This is the, you know, we were supposed to do Ethereum network upgrades every six months, but it's been over a year now I think since the last one.
00:13:31.218 - 00:14:03.232, Speaker A: So we definitely want to get this in. And the reason why it's been, it's taken longer is because as I've said before, the ethereum network has grown larger. You know, it's securing much more value. We need to move slower now. We can't move as fast as we once did with ETH one. You know, ETH two still moving incredibly quickly, but that's okay. I think, you know, I think this and then, you know, AIP 1559 and then maybe one more network upgrade after this will be it for ETH one and then we'll just do the merge and then, you know, ETH one's kind of process will become part of ETH two.
00:14:03.232 - 00:15:07.228, Speaker A: But you know, as a standalone ETH one, I think we've got two more network upgrades, well three more, including a IP 1559 left and then that's kind of it. I don't see another one going in before the merge. I think the merge, if it needs to, maybe, maybe there are critical things that need to go in before the merge happens and maybe I'm wrong there, but yeah, I'm not expecting the kind of rapid development iteration on ETH one's protocol level that we've seen in the past, just, you know, for the reasons I outlined. So Jorgeos Constant Constantinopolis here put out a summary thread of Sigma Prime's post that they, they published just a few hours ago. So I was just talking about the ETH one to ETH two merger. And Georgios explains here that he's very excited about the merger because it's basically replacing gets or go Ethereum ETH hash consensus engine, which is the proof of work engine with one that's controlled by the beacon chains validators, which is the, the proof of stake kind of architecture there. And he think I mean, for those who don't know who George Rose is, he's one of the best researchers in the space.
00:15:07.228 - 00:15:54.976, Speaker A: He currently works at Paradigm, which is a probably the best crypto asset investment firm in the entire space. They have a kickstarter that kickstart a kick ass team there. So he knows what he's talking about when it comes to this sort of stuff, and then he kind of gives a high level change here. So, yeah, the consensus engine change there, there's going to allow the beacon chain to trigger realgs according to the ETH two rules. This is getting quite technical, but, you know, the peer to peer layer would be discarded and use the beacon chain peer to peer. The only caveat is that e two validators will have to one run ETH one full nodes, which they are already doing anyway because that was part of the setup process if you were setting up an ETH two validator. So basically, yeah, this is, this is the merge, right? And this is already being worked on by all the teams in ETH two.
00:15:54.976 - 00:16:35.944, Speaker A: And it is of the highest priority to get this done because we want to get off proof of work as soon as possible for a multitude of reasons. Right. We want to lower that issuance to under 1% of ETH issuance. We want to get off, you know, what the Ethereum community considers to be an extremely wasteful proof of work. It's kind of consensus mechanism because of all the energy that it uses. And also, you know, there's a lot of kind of hostility from the miners towards the Ethereum community now over, over certain things in terms of like, you know, network upgrades and they're trying to veto things like AIP 1559 and stuff like that because, you know, that's them taking a pay car. And it's just weird to me because they knew this stuff was coming for a long time.
00:16:35.944 - 00:17:38.211, Speaker A: I mean, 1559 is almost three years old probably at this point. They've known that proof of stake was always on the roadmap since Genesis. So they should have forecasted this into, you know, if they were going to mine on the ethereum network, they should know, you know, okay, once, once ETH one gets merged into ETH two and it switches to proof of stake, are we going to just mine a different chain? If we can, you know, how profitable will that be? Are they going to maybe do their own fork? Right, because there's a lot of, because there's a lot of money riding on the line here. I actually think that there's a decent chance and that there will be a fork once the merger goes through and the miners will continue the ETH one chain, right, as like a separate chain, as a proof of work chain, and then try to get some exchanges to list this new kind of coin that they've created to make some money from it. I think there's a pretty decent chance of that happening just because of how much money is on the line with miners and just because they can do that if they want to. So, yeah, we'll have to see how that shakes out. But I don't think it really affects Ethereum at all.
00:17:38.211 - 00:18:30.154, Speaker A: It just means that you would get, you know, this new, you know, maybe, I don't know, Ethereum classic, classic coin or something like that that you could sell for more ethics. That's a bonus. But it would cause a bit of drama, I think, short term drama, but it wouldn't cause any disruption to the Ethereum network because the actual Ethereum network and what is Ethereum, right, is going to be, you know, ETH two, with ETH one merged into it. But we'll have to keep an eye on it. I know, I know I've bashed miners a lot lately, and I, this isn't supposed to be personal against miners or anything like that. I respect them for what they are, but I've harped on a lot about it and I feel very strongly about this, is that when you are a service provider and you're being paid for your services to the network, right, you don't get to cry poor, you don't get to veto network upgrades because you know it's going to hurt your bottom line. Like, I'm sorry, but you, you're making like, miners are making more money than anyone in this ecosystem right now.
00:18:30.154 - 00:19:02.174, Speaker A: I don't get paid for, you know, from the network. Ethereum core developers don't get paid from the network. Ethereum community members don't get paid from the network unless they're miners, right? The miner group is, is the only group that in Ethereum that gets paid by the network directly to provide a service. And because of that they are fairly compensated. I do not think that they should wield, you know, outsized power because of that. And they will, you know, the game theory says that they will follow where the rest of the community goes. And, you know, if they fork off, it's going to be a minority fork.
00:19:02.174 - 00:19:31.058, Speaker A: It's going to be worth, you know, basically nothing. If no exchanges list it. And if some exchanges list it, it might be worth a little bit for some time, then it'll drift off to nothing. Like, you cannot have a chain without community support. Basically, miners do not control the network. Doesn't matter how centralized mining becomes that the miners themselves don't control the network from a game theory perspective, but, you know, decentralization of mining is a concern for nation states and stuff like that. But in terms of miners, they're just going to do what gives them the most money.
00:19:31.058 - 00:20:02.068, Speaker A: They are profit maximalist to their core. They have operating expenditures that they have to deal with. They are going to mine what's profitable. They are not going to kick themselves off a profitable network, right. Just because they're making a little bit less money than they were before, they're still going to mine it. So that's kind of like a summary of the, of the debates that I'm seeing happen everywhere. And, yeah, I just think that, um, I mean, I get it, you know, if someone was to say to you, oh, I'm going to cut your pay, you know, even if it's just 10%, they come up to you and say, I'm going to cut your pay by 10%.
00:20:02.068 - 00:20:40.384, Speaker A: Right. Um, because it's healthier for the company. Right. Of course you're going to push back against that. But the thing is, is that usually when someone says that to you in a company, it's like kind of bullshit, right? Whereas with Ethereum and the network, EIP 1559, the benefits of that vastly outweigh the quote unquote pay cut that miners are going to take. And in addition to that, miners are making too much money already, right? They're already making, you know, way more than they ever thought they would because of the fee revenue, which actually, if you go back to the Ethereum white paper, you can see that the fee revenue is just about, is just supposed to be a bonus. The miners are paid by the block rewards, and anything over that is a bonus.
00:20:40.384 - 00:21:11.812, Speaker A: So really, when you forecast your expenditures, when you're a miner, you shouldn't take fees into account at all because fees fluctuate. You don't know what the fees are. Whereas the ethereum kind of block rewards, at least, you know, from, for most of the time remain the same. There have been reductions there, but that's because the price has gone up. So you need to forecast out, you know, just in case there's a, there's a block reward reduction and the ETH price. And you also need to take out the fees from that. You cannot include fees in a forecast because you don't know what the fees are going to be.
00:21:11.812 - 00:21:48.624, Speaker A: No one knew that the fees were going to blow up this much. So at this point, any of them crying poor is just, you know, obviously complaining because they're going to take a little bit of a pay cut. So we'll see how that shakes out. I think 1559 is going to go in with no issues. This is just mine is trying to, trying to get some people to feel sorry for them, I think, which, you know, it is what it is. All right, onto some set v two protocol update. So I set has been building v two for quite a while now, and today they added a Sushi swap trade adapter, a Uniswap trade adapter and chain link oracles for band hedge and cover.
00:21:48.624 - 00:22:26.254, Speaker A: This means that set managers can now trade using sushi and Uniswap liquidity and use these new chain link oracles to issue new sets, basically. So this is really cool. I mean, we've been working on this for a while at set this v two rollout, so it's really cool to see that we've got these trade adapters out there for people to use. So if you're a developer, you can go use these right now. And as it says here, if you're a set manager, you can use these. But the set managers really right now are just, you know, I mean, any developers that want to get set something up, the index co op controls or manages the Defi pulse index as well. So like a set manager for that.
00:22:26.254 - 00:22:56.816, Speaker A: So that's kind of what we mean by managers. But yeah, you can go build your own kind of set and issue it and then, you know, use set protocols, infrastructure to do these sorts of things. So really cool to see that from, from set today or from, from my team today. I was really excited to see this go live. So this flew under the radar today and I don't know why. Loop ring introduced a new feature called fast withdrawals for their L2 exchange. You, you can, can go from L2 to layer one in 30 seconds.
00:22:56.816 - 00:23:24.422, Speaker A: 30 seconds. Like, ah, that's so amazing. Why aren't people making more noise about this? Like, 30 seconds of a withdrawal from L2 to layer one is like, is insane, right? That's like two ethereum blocks. You know, this just makes the user experience so seamless for this. And this is exactly what we need to get more user adoption. No one wants to wait an hour for withdrawals, right? No one wants to wait a long time. And the fact that you can do it within 30 seconds and it's still secure and it's.
00:23:24.422 - 00:23:49.920, Speaker A: And it just feels so seamless is incredible. I mean, I love what loop ring is doing lately. They're just doing so much pioneering work here, and I just wish more people were talking about it and putting kind of, like, attention on this, because these guys are killing it right now, you know, and kind of. I didn't see this till later in the day, and I'm like, why haven't I seen this yet? Like, why aren't the people talking about this? Ah. So I shared it with a few of my friends. I'm like, guys, like, this is, this is amazing. Like, let's, let's.
00:23:49.920 - 00:24:12.364, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. And, you know, I got them a little bit excited, too. So, yeah, I mean, so I'm getting, like, too giddy right now, but this is the kind of stuff that I just love to see. This is the innovation that I love to see within Ethereum. You know, solving these fundamental issues. Right. Slow withdrawal times from L2 to layer one have been one of the biggest drawbacks that people have noted for different implementations.
00:24:12.364 - 00:24:51.274, Speaker A: And now you can do it within 30 seconds, which is nothing, right. You know, we're already used to waiting, you know, maybe one, two, three ethereum blocks for our transactions to confirm, which is, you know, an Ethereum blocks 15 seconds on average. So basically two Ethereum blocks 30 seconds. You know, we're used to kind of to waiting this, and this is to go from L2 to layer one. Right. You only need to do this when you want to interact with layer one protocols or do something on layer one, whereas when you live in L2, you know, I imagine eventually people will live in L2 and just stay there for most of the time. So the fact that you can go to layer one whenever you want in 30 seconds, even though you're going to stay in L2 for most of the time, is just like the cherry on top here.
00:24:51.274 - 00:25:20.954, Speaker A: We're solving the fundamental scaling issues of Ethereum in real time, and I can't think of anything more exciting right now than what's happening in the L2 space, because this is what's going to enable us to scale to the world. It's what's going to enable us to grow DeFi to trillions of dollars in locked. Right. Trillions of dollars of liquidity, basically take over everything, and Ethereum becomes the global settlement layer for all of finance. I just cannot understate how important this is to getting us to that vision. We need L2s. They are coming.
00:25:20.954 - 00:25:36.906, Speaker A: They here, they're. They're getting better every day, and I just love that loop ring is doing this. So go try this out yourself. Go try the exchange on looping if you haven't yet. If you do anything today, I want you to do this. There's some homework for you guys. Go to loop rings exchange.
00:25:36.906 - 00:26:04.082, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description. Give it a try, give it a whirl. Their onboarding experience is pretty straightforward, not totally new friendly, but it's definitely there. For people who have used Defi before, you'll understand what's going on. Yeah, definitely. Highly recommend going and checking that out. So brave has integrated ipfs so the Internet interplanetary file system into their browser so that now they natively support it.
00:26:04.082 - 00:26:40.160, Speaker A: So for any of you who use brave, you can actually access ipfs links from the browser without having to install any extra extensions or anything like that, which is really, really cool. I mean, for those who don't know, IPFS is like this decentralized kind of web hosting service that's been around for quite a while. The IPFS team is actually the one who built the ones who built Filecoin as well. So a lot of websites, or a lot of, I guess, Ethereum websites and dapps, they go into ipfs to decentralize their front end. So now you can access those with brave, which is really cool. I mean, I don't use brave. I'm using chrome.
00:26:40.160 - 00:27:03.524, Speaker A: I just used the chrome, but I have brave. I mean, I use brave for some other things. I do have it open. It's a really great browser in general. It's got like the inbuilt ad blocker, right? You can tip bat tokens to publishers and stuff like that. So, yeah, I mean, if you haven't downloaded brave, give it a, give it a try. As a browser, it's pretty quick, pretty snappy, and now you can access ipfs links seamlessly through the app, which is, which is really, really cool.
00:27:03.524 - 00:27:40.984, Speaker A: So another tweet from Spencer noon today that actually got me thinking, and I'll read out the whole tweet here because it's a dense one. So I have no idea how to value ETH. What I do know is that it's an unprecedented asset that secures an unprecedented network and unlocks unprecedented use cases. Don't fall for superficial historical analogs from experts. It's false precision. Get comfortable with the uncertainty, end quote, on that tweet. So this got me thinking, because you don't want to be able to value ETH, because once you can put a fundamental value on ETH, you can put a cap on its on, its kind of, you know, value accrual.
00:27:40.984 - 00:28:14.826, Speaker A: You can put a cap on how high it can go. We don't want that, right? And I don't think we will be able to ever fundamentally value ETH because of the fact that the Ethereum network is so expressive, it's so generalized, and the ETH asset is so powerful that people will keep coming up with new use cases, new innovative use cases for the network and for ETH for decades to come. You know, we're not. The next killer app could come in ten years, right? We could be like, taking over the world. Ethereum could be the global settlement layer. Defi could be running the entire financial system. Maybe it doesn't happen in ten years, but you get what I'm saying.
00:28:14.826 - 00:28:46.708, Speaker A: And then a few years later, some young dev comes along and kind of does something that we never even thought was possible, right? So there's no way to value ETH. There's really no way to value it. All you can value is that. Do you think this thing's going to change the world? Yes. Do you think ETH is going to capture this value? Yes. Staking 1559 trustless collateral, right? We have those three core pillars of ETH, value accrual. Do you think that there's going to be new use cases, going to be extreme demand for Ethereum going forward? Yes.
00:28:46.708 - 00:29:40.458, Speaker A: Because the total addressable market of finance, right, is the entire world. And Ethereum is more than finance, more than DeFi. It is a human coordination mechanism, the best one we've ever had. Right? So, I mean, I don't know how you cannot be bullish on ETH at this point. I mean, like, I mean, I know I'm an ETH perma ball, but like, come on, like, if you see what's happening on Ethereum right now, and you're not bullish on ETH, on the network, on the various defi tokens that are capturing this value, then you just, you just, I mean, a lot of people like to just be ignorant to this sort of stuff. They're blind. And, you know, I know pretty much all of you watching this probably, you know, don't fall into that camp, because you're watching me rabble on about Ethereum all the time, right? So you're obsessed with it, as I am, but basically you, you, you know, need to kind of, I guess, maybe shift your mental model from it's so, you know, high now and like, it can't go much higher than this.
00:29:40.458 - 00:29:58.738, Speaker A: Or like, the market cap is like, bigger than this, bigger than that to, well, this is a brand new thing that we've never had before. It's literally revolutionary. No one knows how to value this stuff. I'll just ride the wave. Now, that's not investment advice. That's not me telling you to never sell. Right? That's not me telling you to wait for like $100,000 ETH and then sell.
00:29:58.738 - 00:30:25.370, Speaker A: That's me saying to you that we're going to have, you know, these waves, we're going to have bull and bear cycles. That's going to keep happening. But the long term value of ETH, and I truly believe this is going to be in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. And long term, I'm talking decades, right? I'm not talking like a few months. That's why I gave my $10,000 ETH price target. Right. And, you know, and that's why I said it was actually my conservative target.
00:30:25.370 - 00:30:51.748, Speaker A: If Ethereum succeeds and fulfills everything that it's doing, because ETH is just such an amazing asset, and the Ethereum network is such an amazing platform that is going to change the entire world. And it really will. I really, truly believe that. And I have believed that for a long time now. So I've dedicated my life to this stuff. So if you want to be along for the ride, you can buy ETH, of course, right. Or you can get involved in the ethereum ecosystem in a number of different ways.
00:30:51.748 - 00:31:15.416, Speaker A: And I encourage you to do so even if you can't go full time. Do it part time. Do something, anything. You don't, you don't have to do, you know, anything big. I started by doing a weekly crypto newsletter when I wasn't working in crypto in early 2018, in the depths of the, you know, not the depths of the bear market, but, like, the start of a two year bear market. And that was just a basic newsletter. Right.
00:31:15.416 - 00:31:42.432, Speaker A: I wasn't anything fancy. You know, it only took me a few hours to put together each week. But, you know, that's what got me started on my journey and kind of like, I am where I am now because of that and because I stuck to it and I believed in it. And I'm sure a lot of you believe in it, too. So if you have the time, you know, maybe instead of sitting down watching Netflix, you know, you do something in the Ethereum community, it doesn't matter what it is. You can write a blog post, you can make a video, you can start a podcast. It doesn't matter.
00:31:42.432 - 00:32:05.400, Speaker A: You just need to stick to it. Like, you know, take it from me, the first, when I did my newsletter for a few months, I only had a couple hundred subscribers, right? But I kept at it because I believed in something. I believed in something greater than myself. I believed that I was adding value to people. And as long as you're adding value to people, that's all that matters in my eyes. So, yeah, encourage you to get involved in any way you can make memes. Right? Memes are cool.
00:32:05.400 - 00:32:15.862, Speaker A: Memes are important. People love memes. I love the Ethereum memes account. You know, I've mentioned them before. They're adding tons of value, right? Then they're bringing joy to people. That's. That's what counts.
00:32:15.862 - 00:32:40.760, Speaker A: So, you know, as long as you're creating value, you know, you're cool in my book. So, really interesting tweet from Justin Drake today when ETH was actually, you know, not at 1200 or $1,300 that it is right now. When it was at like, $1400, there was $3.8 billion worth of ETH two. Worth of ETH in ETH two. And that has been deposited over 76 days on average. That's been $50 million a day.
00:32:40.760 - 00:33:04.312, Speaker A: It's 2.3% of the ETH supply. The makeup of it is one third of it is individuals, one third of it is exchanges, and one third of it is pools and whales. There's currently a 17 day activation queue, which hasn't gone to zero so far. That means it's going to take. If you deposited ETH into ETH two today, it would take 17 days to activate your validators. And Coinbase, Gemini and bit stamp have yet to enable deposits.
00:33:04.312 - 00:33:22.100, Speaker A: So this is huge, right? ETH two is huge. We all know it's huge. It's just growing every day, last I checked. I mean, there's 2.8 million ethan there. I expect that to grow up to 5 million over the next few months, especially as these exchanges come online. Decentralized staking comes online, all this sort of stuff.
00:33:22.100 - 00:33:31.140, Speaker A: So. Yeah. And e two's chugging along. I know I don't talk about e to that much on this, on this, on the refuel. And that's literally because it's. It's going fine. It's chugging along just fine.
00:33:31.140 - 00:33:46.550, Speaker A: There's no major incidents. Research and development is happening behind the scenes. You know, there's no deliverables yet because it's a lot of development still going on. But, yeah, the. The developments there, it's. It's chugging along. And we'll have more releases, I think, this year.
00:33:46.550 - 00:34:13.572, Speaker A: You know, I'm hoping that we get phase one this year and the merger next year, but we'll have to see. Maybe I'm being a bit too optimistic there, but it's only January, so we can, we can see what happens there. All right, last thing to talk about, because this is getting a bit long now. It's at 35 minutes, almost 34 minutes. So basically, the centralized exchange volume for January is currently at $37.3 billion, which is a monthly all time high by far. So those of you watching the video can see the chart here.
00:34:13.572 - 00:34:44.892, Speaker A: Right? I mean, the last all time high month was in September, I think. Yep. September, which is the height of, like, defy mania. And it kind of went down after that a little bit, but has trended back up. And now in January, we have smashed through the records and, you know, the exchanges kind of making the most volume here, a uniswap curve and sushi swap, from what I can see. And zero x is actually kind of inching up there as well, which is really cool to see. And there's twelve days left of January still right there.
00:34:44.892 - 00:35:12.778, Speaker A: This 33.37.3 billion is probably going to be 50 billion by the time January is finished, especially if we keep having this price action and volatility and all this sort of stuff going on. So this is just incredible. I mean, decentralized exchange growth is the most incredible thing I think, Ethereum has ever produced up until this point. They, they're basically used by everyone. They have an extremely strong product market fit. They have so many benefits over centralized exchanges.
00:35:12.778 - 00:35:37.002, Speaker A: Yes, the fees are high, I get that. But, I mean, loop ring has their exchange. You can go try that, right? That uniswap is going to go to L2. There's going to be all this stuff happening, and it just offers such a better experience. Right? No KYC, no waiting for your deposit to credit into a centralized exchange. No, you know, exorbitant fees, minimum withdrawals. Just do it from your own metamask wallet or whatever, right? From your ledger.
00:35:37.002 - 00:35:55.870, Speaker A: It's just I, you know, I can't, like, kind of explain how incredible it is. And you can see it in the chart. Look at the chart. Look at 2019, right? It just, it was nothing. And now 2020, we're just, we're doing more volume than centralized exchanges. This is the power of Ethereum. And this is what I was going on about before about, you can't value Ethereum.
00:35:55.870 - 00:36:22.150, Speaker A: You can't value it. It's impossible, right? No one saw this coming and no one's going to see the future coming. We're all bullish, right? We're all really bullish. But we're going to keep getting blown away. And that's the most exciting thing about Ethereum, is that we're going to keep getting blown away day in, day out, and nothing is going to take that away. No one can stop the Ethereum network, no one can take over it, right? Well, they can technically, but it's very, very hard to do that. Right, and we're marching forward to this massive upgrade in ETH two.
00:36:22.150 - 00:36:41.694, Speaker A: You know, the first version's live. All this is coming. It's just so hard not to be bullish. I'm just so bullish today because we hit all time high yesterday and I've been on a high all day, even though the price has come down a bit. I don't care. I am just on such a high and I want to share that joy with all of you. And I hope that you're all as excited as I am, because this year is just going to be.
00:36:41.694 - 00:36:58.484, Speaker A: Is going to be amazing. I think we're going to see so much happen on Ethereum, and I'm just so pumped for it. I will digress. I have gone very long with this refuel, but I hope you enjoyed it special. I guess like after all time high episode. But yeah. Thank you everyone, for watching and listening.
