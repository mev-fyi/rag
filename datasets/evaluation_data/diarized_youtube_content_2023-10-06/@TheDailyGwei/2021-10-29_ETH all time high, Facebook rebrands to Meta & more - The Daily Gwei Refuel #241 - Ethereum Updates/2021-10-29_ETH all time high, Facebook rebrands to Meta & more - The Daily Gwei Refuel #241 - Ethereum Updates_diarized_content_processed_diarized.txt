00:00:00.280 - 00:00:30.222, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Deadly Grey refuel, where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Cesano, and today's the 29 October 2021. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So all time high day for ETH today we went to, I think 4400. So finally broke through the old all time high of around 4375. 4380 there. We did touch it the other day, then came, came back off, it went under 4k, but now, you know, know, it kind of went back up to 4400 and right now it's 4324.
00:00:30.222 - 00:00:57.270, Speaker A: So again, we've come down a little bit here. But I mean, you know, I woke up to this. Actually, it was pretty funny because I usually wake up at like 11:00 a.m. Most mornings and I kind of like woke up later today because there were kind of really, really strong winds last night that kind of kept me up. So I just slept in a little bit and I kind of checked the price and I'm like, okay, we're almost at all time high. This is amazing. So I tweeted out this picture gm with like the happy kind of WoJack here.
00:00:57.270 - 00:01:20.854, Speaker A: Then it got to my pc and as I sat down on my pc, I was kind of just looking at the chart. I was like, wow, okay, yes, yes. And we went to all time high and I was like, oh yeah, finally we finally broke through it. And it's funny because I've been saying to some friends for quite a while that I thought we were going to get to all time high in October. And they were saying to me, no, no, it's going to be November. Like, you know, and they'll, you know, obviously doing their ta and get the charts. I'm like, no, guys, I feel like it's going to be October.
00:01:20.854 - 00:01:54.598, Speaker A: And then when we hit it the other day that, you know, I didn't really get credited with it because we, we only hit it on some exchanges. We didn't break through it. So I was like, oh, okay, fair enough. But, you know, I kind of counted it. But then today we clearly kind of broke through it. And, you know, it's, it's funny, like, I don't know, kind of like, what's gonna happen from here? Are we gonna break through it again? Like when you, when you guys are watching this or kind of like over the next few days, we seem to be just hanging around the all time high, which is, which is fine, I think. But it goes back to what I was saying yesterday about how, you know, we had that kind of, like, massive shib pump, and everyone was like, oh, this is a top signal where we're gonna crash.
00:01:54.598 - 00:02:13.680, Speaker A: Like, we're gonna go into a bear market again. This is ridiculous. And I kind of said that I don't think that's gonna happen at all. I think there's just too many kind of, like, tailwinds behind ETH right now that's keeping me really bullish. And we're going to talk about some of them on the, on the refill, of course. But, yeah, I mean, it was just really great to wake up to another ETH all time high. Even though we've come down a bit, it's, it's kind of, like a little bit annoying.
00:02:13.680 - 00:02:59.796, Speaker A: I, you know, the thing that I pay attention to a lot these days is kind of like the funding rates, and what the funding rates show you is basically how much are people paying to be long a certain asset. Now, if the funding rates are high, that generally means that there's a lot of leverage in the system. And it's kind of like, it means that there could be kind of like, you know, if the price was to go down, there could be a bunch of liquidations that push, this is the price down even further, and we could have one of those sell offs that we all kind of, like, know and love, right? So I kind of watched that, and I saw that going up, like, rapidly as we kind of blew through all time high. And I was like, oh, God, why these apes, like, leveraging up already? Like, come on, guys, like, relax for a little bit. Let us go a bit higher than the all time high before you start leveraging up. But I guess people love to do that, right? Love to get greedy, love to long the all time high. So I don't know.
00:02:59.796 - 00:03:34.584, Speaker A: And, you know, I think the other thing worth mentioning as well is that ETH is basically, I mean, it's still basically at its all time high, and bitcoin is not even near it. I think bitcoins, what, 61k right now? I think its new all time high was like 67 or sixty eight k. And I mean, it just keeps gaining. And I'm not surprised by this at all, given how many tailwinds are behind ETH right now. And I just, I mean, obviously I'm biased because, like, I'm really into Ethereum and I, and you guys know I don't hold any bit, any bitcoin. But, I mean, there's a reason I don't hold any is because I just don't see the point of bitcoin in the world that we're in. I don't see the point of bitcoin going forward, really.
00:03:34.584 - 00:03:57.144, Speaker A: And I know some people do. And so, sorry, not, not just some people, a lot of people do. And a lot of people kind of like, see it as a story of value. Digital gold has its place, and that's fine, but that's like a niche to me. Like, I don't see that as being a massive kind of growth vehicle for it. I see it kind of putting a cap on how high bitcoin can go. And then I look at ETH and I kind of look at all the kind of not just the tailwinds, but all the value accrual mechanisms for ETH as an asset.
00:03:57.144 - 00:04:25.504, Speaker A: And I'm like, I just, I'm so much more bullish on ETH. I'm so much more bullish on the ethereum ecosystem and what's happening there. You know, everything, like all the popular stuff that we always talk about, like Defi and NFTs and kind of like Daos and metaverse stuff, which I'm going to talk about in a sec. And, you know, I just can't help but be really, really bullish on Ethereum. So. So, yeah, I think that's just, I mean, it's also funny to say this is like breaking precedent, too. Usually it's bitcoin that goes into price discovery first, which technically it did.
00:04:25.504 - 00:05:29.716, Speaker A: I mean, like, you know, when it went to its all time high the other day, but it's come back down and kind of got rejected while ETH has just kept trending up, especially against bitcoin, like on the ratio as well. So from that point of view, I don't know, it feels like the winds have changed. I've personally felt the winds have, that the winds have changed for a long time now, pretty much since like, I guess Defi summer, or at least the start of it, like June 2020, I think, when the comp token launched as part of compound and then we had like the kickoff of DeFi summer, that really changed everything in my mind. That basically got Ethereum to like the forefront of many people's minds and basically opened the door to a lot of people kind of like coming into Ethereum from other ecosystems when we had a massive migration of BTC come over to Ethereum from the bitcoin network to participate in DeFi. And since then, I felt like ethereum has really just taken, taken hold of the entire crypto space and been the main focus of it since June of 2020. And I mean, it's shown in the price as well, like it's output. I mean, yes, bitcoin has gone up as well, but it's outperformed bitcoin since, since March, since the bottom last year, it's outperformed bitcoin.
00:05:29.716 - 00:06:05.900, Speaker A: It continues to, and, you know, now it's kind of in its hit, its all time high and kind of like, wants to go into price discovery before bitcoin as well. So, yeah, it's just, it's very different to what kind of, like, the ecosystem is used to. And I don't know how many people actually realize that. I don't know how many people have come to terms with that yet. There is definitely, I think the markets are confused as well, where they're like, you know, is, you know, what the hell's going on. Like, ETH is actually doing something that people aren't expecting because ETH is usually weak in q four against bitcoin, but right now it's not. Obviously, there's still two months left of q four, and everything can reverse from here.
00:06:05.900 - 00:06:27.456, Speaker A: But I don't know, I'm not, I'm not feeling that. But we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens over the next few months. I mean, these sorts of things is not really anything to worry about if you're a long term person, you know, I'm a long term guy as well. You guys know that. But essentially, I just like, kind of looking at these sorts of things because for me, I'm in this ecosystem. To see Ethereum continue to win and dominate, continue to basically be the substrate for everything to run on.
00:06:27.456 - 00:06:55.346, Speaker A: Um, and, you know, I want Ethereum to be number one. I don't think bitcoin deserves to be number one. I think that it's, it's value and it's kind of like, I guess it's spot at number one, is, is there because of the fact that it's been around for much longer. Um, and it obviously has, like, a more institutional adoption, uh, to an extent, and kind of like a massive network effect, but so does Ethereum. And I think Ethereum has caught up to bitcoin and everything except market cap at this point. So we'll see how that plays out. But, yeah, enough about price.
00:06:55.346 - 00:07:26.682, Speaker A: Got a bunch of other updates to get through. So Diva, the Devcon unicorn put out a update tweet today about when Devcon six is going to be taking place. And another event, apparently, that it might be, that looks to be taking place in South Africa. Which is pretty cool. So basically, Defcon six will be happening in fall of 2022. Now, I really hate when people use seasons to refer to the time of the year because, I'm sorry, the northern hemisphere is not the only hemisphere. Right? Like, I'm in the southern hemisphere and so are a lot of people.
00:07:26.682 - 00:08:01.716, Speaker A: We do not have the same kind of like seasons as the northern hemisphere. Obviously, it's reversed. So I would rather people just say, like, you know, give a quarter, like a q one, Q two, or like late this year, early this year. And that's what they did with their follow up tweet, because people were confused and they basically said DEFcon six is coming in late 2022. So basically fall for the northern hemisphere, even though DEFcon six is being hosted in Bugatti, Columbia, which is in the southern hemisphere. So it's just kind of funny how that worked out there. But yeah, I mean, I do plan to get out to these Devcons six.
00:08:01.716 - 00:08:23.616, Speaker A: I mean, Devcons are the biggest ethereum conferences there. You know, I've only been to one, funny enough. I went to the one in Osaka that was my first and only Devcon, and I unfortunately hadn't gone to the previous four. But it was amazing. I loved it. I loved kind of like, you know, how many people were there, everything that went on there. It's obviously the most ethereum, kind of like aligned conference, and it's the only conference that the Ethereum foundation holds.
00:08:23.616 - 00:08:51.122, Speaker A: So it's a pretty big one. So I'm hoping to get out there at the late 2022 here. And then apparently they're teasing another kind of like conference in early 2022 in South Africa. I don't know where it's going to be in maybe not just South Africa. It seems like the map here is teasing, like, Africa, the whole continent, but I'm just assuming it's South Africa. So could be Cape Town or Lagos or somewhere like that. I've never been, so I would love to go to that as well, but we'll have to see.
00:08:51.122 - 00:09:23.228, Speaker A: And, you know, I kind of like mentioned on Twitter the other day that I think the first conference I'm going to be going to is, is going to be ETH, Denver in February. I definitely want to get out to that. The dates were actually announced for that. It's pretty much the normal dates, like the 17th to the 21 February. So I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of people there as well. I'm definitely wanting to get out to that one. But yeah, these are the dates I guess for Defcon six, which has got delayed because of COVID it was supposed to happen in 2020, obviously isn't going to happen this year, and now it's going to happen in late 2022.
00:09:23.228 - 00:09:54.804, Speaker A: So I'm very much looking forward to that. But there are a bunch of other conferences in 2022 that I'll be going to as well, and hope to see all of you there. All right, so the biggest piece of news of the last 24 hours is Facebook renaming themselves to meta in reference to the metaverse. So they say here that they're helping to build the metaverse, a place where people will play and connect in 3d. Welcome to the next chapter of social connection. Now, there's a lot to unpack here. I'm not going to go through everything in extreme detail, but the first thing I want to say is I hate the logo.
00:09:54.804 - 00:10:12.528, Speaker A: I really, I just, I look at this logo and I'm like, I get what you're doing. It's kind of like a play on a game controller. It's a play on a VR headset. But I just don't like it. Just, I don't know, it looks weird to me. It doesn't look like a good logo, but anyway, I mean, that's subjective. What, what I should focus on is kind of like what this means for the ecosystem.
00:10:12.528 - 00:10:55.786, Speaker A: This is actually pretty huge. Like, no matter what you think of Facebook as a company, there's no denying that. I mean, they, they're, they're huge, right? They have billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, all their other kind of like things like Oculus and, and stuff like that. And, uh, you know, everyone knows about them. For them to rename themselves to meta and to put their full weight behind, uh, kind of like turning into a metaverse company and kind of like using the term metaverse for that, for all their kind of like existing users to see, is a huge endorsement and validation of what we've been building within the crypto Ethereum ecosystems. Now, of course, you know, we don't need their endorsement. We don't want, you know, we don't want these centralized parties to kind of like encroach on what we're trying to build in a decentralized way.
00:10:55.786 - 00:11:36.398, Speaker A: But what this does is basically incepts the idea of a metaverse into people's heads. So when they come and get onboarded into like Ethereum, into kind of like the L2s, like immutable x and stuff like that, that are building these NFT metaverse products, they're already going to have exposure to the term. It's not going to be a brand new thing to them. They're going to be like, oh, that's like that thing that Facebook's doing, you know, and a lot of people will kind of look to that and be like that. This must be legit, right? Because as much hate as Facebook gets there, you know, there are still like billions of people that use it. So just because people hate it doesn't mean they aren't using it, and it doesn't mean that everyone hates it. There are plenty of people out there who love using it, love using, you know, obviously Instagram and WhatsApp and, and Oculus and things like that.
00:11:36.398 - 00:12:10.520, Speaker A: I mean, I have an oculus as well. I don't really use any of these apps. I use Facebook messenger sometimes, but I don't really use the other apps or anything like that. But I think that this is just like a huge onboarding vehicle now, obviously, meta or Facebook or whatever aren't going to build a decentralized metaverse. They're going to build a closed, closed kind of like garden, a closed platform. It's not going to be open. Facebook has a history of basically building completely centralized and closed things and actually kicking developers off of their APIs and basically making developers lives really hard to build anything on top of Facebook.
00:12:10.520 - 00:12:48.224, Speaker A: So I don't expect this to be much different from that. But from that point of view, this is kind of like where crypto and ethereum's opportunity lies, where Ethereum is the complete opposite. It is open, permissionless, decentralized, you can build whatever you want on there. There's no central party that can remove it from the Ethereum network. And if you build it in a truly decentralized way, the users of your, whatever you've built, you can't take their assets or kind of like their, their things away from them. And, you know, obviously the Ethereum, the underlying platform is decentralized, so it can't unilaterally take away anyone's kind of assets either. So that's what kind of like, I guess, meta and Facebook and everything are contending with.
00:12:48.224 - 00:13:36.698, Speaker A: But at the same time, they have a massive head start due to the fact that they have a massive user base. But they also have headwinds, they have regulatory headwinds which they suffered during trying to launch Facebook Libra, which became diem, which I now think is called Nova. And I don't know, kind of like what the status is there, but they've gone through like a ton of, of headwinds there with that. So I think they're gonna, they're gonna see that come out here as well. And also the fact that because it's gonna be closed off, then in my mind, it's just not gonna attract the right kinds of people that you wanna be attracting to build out a metaverse platform, to build out something that's exciting and something that people, developers are gonna get excited about, especially because users are one thing, but without developers building things, it doesn't really mean anything. It doesn't matter how many users you have. If developers aren't building new and innovative stuff on your platform, then the users are going to go elsewhere.
00:13:36.698 - 00:14:15.416, Speaker A: And that's exactly why Facebook has this thing where they like to acquire massive kind of like applications and other companies in order to kind of eat the users, but also not have to basically build it themselves. So, you know, Facebook acquired Instagram for a billion dollars. And at the time that was actually viewed as like a very expensive acquisition, but it obviously played out very nicely for them. And then they acquired WhatsApp for, I think it was like 20 something billion dollars, some, some ridiculous amount of money. And then they acquired Oculus as well for, for a large amount of money. They, they tried to acquire Snapchat, but Snapchat turned them down. And I'm sure they've made like a bunch of other acquisitions as well.
00:14:15.416 - 00:14:41.654, Speaker A: They, but the thing is, they can't acquire Ethereum, right? They can't buy a theory and what they can do is join Ethereum, but they can't buy Ethereum. There is no one to buy it from. From like they can become a validator if they want. They can become many validators, but they cannot buy Ethereum. Make it part of like the meta, you know, group of companies, and basically do whatever they want with it. That's not happening. Yes, they can, quote unquote, acquire companies that are building on top of Ethereum if they're centralized companies.
00:14:41.654 - 00:15:35.302, Speaker A: But even still, if there are, if there are developers building decentralized products, there's no way for, for them to be acquired either. Like you can do maybe a token swap where the community comes together and says, okay, well, you know, we're happy to get bought out, here's our tokens. And we kind of just like, we'll get our money for our tokens. But even still, I just don't see that happening. And I think that is the best defense Ethereum has against something like this and even an offense, because we, we, being Ethereum, get to get all the really innovative developers coming into the ecosystem that want to build on this sort of stuff and don't want to kind of like build on Facebook's closed off ecosystem or where there is a high chance that if you build something that Facebook doesn't like or that meta doesn't like, it's going to get removed. It's just going to get deleted. That's not going to happen to you on Ethereum, and that's not going to happen to you on a lot of the plat, the things building on Ethereum either, which I think is really, really cool.
00:15:35.302 - 00:16:10.018, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean, I wrote a bit more about this in the Daily Gray newsletter today, but those are just my general thoughts there on what's happening. We'll have to see how this plays out over the coming years. But I think Brendan put it actually best here where he basically put out a tweet where he said, so basically it's Ethereum versus Facebook in a race to create a compelling metaverse. Open versus closed, transparent versus opaque, permissionless versus permissioned, community owned versus Zuck owned. My better place. Let's build a better future together. So obviously, I mean, Brendan is the co founder and COO of Dharma, so obviously his bets are on Ethereum and so are mine, even more obviously.
00:16:10.018 - 00:16:44.164, Speaker A: And I'm sure a lot of you guys are betting on, on ethereum as well. And I don't know, you know what the funny thing is? Like, meta can actually build whatever they want to build on Ethereum. They can just build it as a roll up. Like imagine if that actually happened. Like I had a friend today message me about it and say, imagine if meta built themselves as a roll up on Ethereum. How huge would that be? And it would be. And you know what, I actually don't think it's far fetched to say that they will be doing something like that because they get to tap into an already kind of like existing user base that is used to kind of like nfts, metaverse, crypto gaming and stuff like that, and get to kind of, you know, build their own thing.
00:16:44.164 - 00:17:39.566, Speaker A: Like their roll up can be centralized, doesn't have to be a decentralized roll up, but you know, and they can still kind of maintain, maintain complete control over it, but they get the interoperability of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. So, you know, I'm, I'm actually sure, you know, I'm actually not going to be surprised if that happens either. And you know, I'm just seeing a comment here that Novi, which is what Libra into DM into Novi is actually Pax now, which is, which is an Arc 20 on Ethereum. So funny enough, Facebook has already ended up on Ethereum with one of their products, so we'll have to see how that plays out. But interesting times ahead for the metaverse and for centralized versus decentralized, kind of like products and services. So bankless had a really great newsletter today where they basically went through Ethereum's Q three results and compared Q 320 21 to Q 320 20. So you can see in this table here, I don't want, I can't maximize it because my camera is blocking it.
00:17:39.566 - 00:17:54.212, Speaker A: There you go. You can see it there. Um, the, they've got a bunch of different metrics here. They compare between Q 320 20 and 2021. Q 320 21. And compare the growth network revenue is up from 321 billion to 1.9 trillion.
00:17:54.212 - 00:18:16.460, Speaker A: Uh, which is, which is quite crazy if I'm reading that. No, no, no, sorry, sorry. Uh, network revenue is not value settled. I was reading that wrong. So it's up from 321 million to 1.9 billion, which is still a growth of like five x, which is insane. Value settled went from $107 billion to $536 billion, up about forex there.
00:18:16.460 - 00:18:38.340, Speaker A: ETH staked went from zero because the beacon chain wasn't live to. It's pretty much, it's at 8 million ETH now, which is obviously a growth of infinity percent. The issuance rate of ETH has actually dropped by 30% thanks to ETH being burned. We didn't have 1559 last q three, which means that value of ETH burned was zero. Now it's $1.3 billion. I think it's more than that, to be honest.
00:18:38.340 - 00:19:25.442, Speaker A: I think this number is, is off here. Um, daily active addresses went up 24%, which I actually think daily active addresses, as I've explained before, is a kind of like, uh, I would say an inferior metric for layer one because a lot of users are moving to L2. Um, so I expect daily active addresses to either just remain flat or go down from here, because as time goes on, the most active addresses on Ethereum will just be whales and the L2s posting their proofs and stuff like that instead of end users. So, yeah, I don't expect that to kind of like, uh, grow much further from here because people are just going to move to L2. Defi TvL is up twelve x to 123 billion from 10 billion. The decentralized exchange volume is at 48 billion in q 320 20. Now it's at 189 billion in q 320 21.
00:19:25.442 - 00:19:45.142, Speaker A: And as you can see. I mean, you can go down the list here. The, I mean, the growth in general has just been absolutely insane. I think the most insane growth is open sea sales, $5 million. In Q 320 20. In Q 320 21, it was $6.7 billion, a growth of 141,847%.
00:19:45.142 - 00:20:05.666, Speaker A: That's insane, right? Absolutely insane. And l two tvl as well, went from 8.4 million to 2.5 billion, which is a growth of almost 30,000%. So, as you can see, ethereum's growth over the last year has been completely insane. ETH is still undervalued because at the end of q three last year, that would be September, I think, if I'm doing it right in my head. October, November.
00:20:05.666 - 00:20:35.446, Speaker A: Yeah, September. Um, I don't remember what exactly what the ETH price was, but I'm pretty sure it was like $400 or might maybe not even $400. I think it was around $400. Um, and ETH is only up ten x from there. Uh, I just, I mean, and given, like, the growth that Ethereum has kind of, like, gone through, especially because we have the issuance being reduced due to the burn and also the, the tailwinds that are coming for, for ETH, I would say right now, ETH is just extremely undervalued. I just don't. And it's undervalued because people don't understand it.
00:20:35.446 - 00:20:54.382, Speaker A: People don't understand, like, this sort of stuff and don't understand, like, how, how fast Ethereum is still growing. And the fact of the matter is, we're still early. Like, super, super early. Like, think about it for a sec. Defi itself is, like, still very insular. It's still very crypto native. It hasn't actually penetrated into the real world in any real way yet.
00:20:54.382 - 00:21:30.866, Speaker A: Could you imagine the entire world's financial system running on Ethereum in, like, the late stage of adoption? Imagine how much growth there still is to have here. There is, you know, I mean, I'm just gonna spit random numbers here. There is, like, tens of thousands of times more growth left in everything that we're doing here. And that's gonna translate to, obviously, ETH being burned, value flowing, to eat for things like staking, and also uses collateral and stuff like that within defi. I don't know, girl. Guys, this is, again, goes back to my thesis, around $100,000 ETH over the next kind of like five to ten years. I just don't see a world where that doesn't happen.
00:21:30.866 - 00:22:03.420, Speaker A: Given that Ethereum is just growing so quickly. I don't see Ethereum losing its market share to, to anyone, really. I know that, you know, people say, oh, Ethereum has already lost its market share because TVL has gone to other networks instead of Ethereum. But the theorems, TVL is still growing. It's just the pie is getting bigger. So from that point of view, yes, maybe Ethereum's overall market share, if you're measuring a TVL, will go down, but Ethereum itself is still growing at a really rapid pace, and Ethereum's altu ecosystem is just now starting off, and that will grow at a rapid pace as well. So really cool metrics here from, from bankless.
00:22:03.420 - 00:22:31.694, Speaker A: As you're just giving this a read, I'm going to power through this because I'm realizing I'm at 22 minutes already. So. And just on the, on the fee burn as well. The ultrasound money account tweeted out, over the last three days, the eat supply has actually been decreasing due to the fee burn, as I explained yesterday. Now, when you. I haven't actually looked at it like this before, when you actually put the numbers here, this is crazy. October 26, we had 117,757,635 ETH.
00:22:31.694 - 00:23:08.822, Speaker A: On October 27, we had 117,757,327 ETH. So we burned more than we issued. And then again on October 28, we burned more than we issued again by about 2000 ETH, which is crazy. I mean, this is a net deflationary ETH right here. Now, this is during proof of work and proof of stake as well. Uh, both networks issuing new ETH, once the merge happens, every single day will be a deflationary ETH day by a lot. And, you know, if we maintain the current fee revenue, but at that point, I think it's 2% right now, a reduction in supply each year.
00:23:08.822 - 00:24:01.574, Speaker A: So 2% each year over the next ten years, that's a 20% reduction in the, in the ETH supply. And that's assuming that the kind of, like, fee revenue doesn't go up, which for all intents, and sorry, from all the signals that I'm seeing, I do definitely think it's going to keep going up over the years. So you could say, like, there's a 20% reduction in the ETH supply from here, which would get us to probably under 100 million ETH, which is crazy, right? And this is coming from, like, the, the active supplies. This is not just coming from cold storage, because the ETH being burned is coming from the active supply that people are using to pay fees. And then also the fact that we're dropping issuance by about 85% with the merge that's also active ETH that usually gets sold to cover running costs. So yeah, putting it like this and being able to see it and kind of like putting the hard numbers is crazy. And I don't think people appreciate the craziness of a deflationary ETH.
00:24:01.574 - 00:24:35.910, Speaker A: So, phone ondao has introduced themselves today. They said running phonon here, and they said, say hello to a whole new approach to scaling and privacy for the entire blockchain ecosystem. And phonon describes themselves as a community owned protocol enabling off chain transfer of digital assets using secure hardware. Turn all crypto into peer to peer cash, private, fast and free. Now, this is coming out of the grid team. You guys will know about grid and their lattice one hardware wallet product that I have talked about before. This is obviously a phone runner is obviously going to be an integral part of that.
00:24:35.910 - 00:25:00.520, Speaker A: You can kind of read this blog post for kind of more details on that. But this is really exciting. I mean, as I've said before, I think privacy is something that the Ethereum ecosystem is still lacking in a big way. And this is another team kind of like tackling it in a, in a way. And this team is also very experienced. Like if you've used the lattice one or looked into the specs of the lattice one hardware wallet, it is the most secure hardware wallet on the market. Like, by far.
00:25:00.520 - 00:25:36.360, Speaker A: It has protections that no other hardware wallet can even dream of. So if there's one team that I would actually trust to build something like, like this, like a secure hardware enforced private payment system, it is the grid team. So I'm looking forward to phone on. I think this looks really cool. I'm looking forward to seeing it more in the wild and actually using it myself. Uh, and I'm just really, really glad that we get to see more of these privacy kind of like protocols coming to market. And speaking of that as well, uh, John Woo from aztec network put out a thread about, uh, what aztec connect is going to enable for, for, I guess, ethereum.
00:25:36.360 - 00:26:29.420, Speaker A: And it's going to enable private swaps and limit orders on uniswap, making a private on chain order book possible for the first time. This site kind of stuff is, is kind of mind blowing, right? Because we're going beyond payments and we're going to swaps and doing private kind of, kind of swaps, but on uniswap. So he kind of put out this thread, which I suggest reading, but essentially he starts off the thread by saying, you know, some background on Aztec connects. Kinect is Aztec's L2 to layer one privacy bridge. So, meaning you'll be able to take shielded assets from the aztec network, which is a roll up that lives on top of Ethereum and instantly, sorry. Interact directly with any l one smart contract, accessing l one liquidity with full privacy. So essentially, you can kind of, like, go from L2 to layer one in a very private way, do private trades, private transfers, all that sort of stuff, and also kind of like, obviously reducing gas costs because it's on a layer, too.
00:26:29.420 - 00:26:56.868, Speaker A: Now, Aztecs L2 is actually called a Zk Zk roll up. It's not. It's not like a ZK roll up on top of a Zk roll up, but it is privacy within a ZK roll up, which I think is really awesome. So highly recommend giving this kind of, like, thread a read here. It's very interesting, but as I said, very, very bullish on. On privacy protocols going forward. So a lot of you will have seen this crypto punk that sold for $532 million today, which wasn't a real sale.
00:26:56.868 - 00:27:42.424, Speaker A: What ended up happening was that, as Mariano explains here, someone flash loaned this money, listed their punk for sale for an insane amount, bought it, got the ETH back from the other account, and repaid the flash loan. And Robert Miller put out a tweet with a closer look here, how it worked and why people would do this. And he basically explained that, why would people do this? Why would someone do this? It doesn't make any sense. They didn't make any money. You know, what are they trying to prove here? Robert basically says, you know, as this wasn't a real sale, it wasn't an exploit, no one made any money. But they probably did this to generate a bunch of buzz about it on Twitter and troll a bit, which is kind of funny, right? Like, I mean, anyone can do this, right? Like flash loans. I mean, the way flash loans work is that it literally gives anyone the ability to.
00:27:42.424 - 00:28:12.736, Speaker A: To borrow, you know, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, or as many, as much money as they can get out of these protocols that allow you to do flash loans. And as long as you repay it back in the same block, you're able to kind of, like, do whatever you want with the money, which is. Which is pretty, pretty cool. I mean, a flash loans are still one of the most cool, one of the coolest things in the ethereum ecosystem to me. So. So, yeah, but I thought this was just a little funny thing to point out. So immutable x or immutable isn't continuing their dominance within the NFT ecosystem here.
00:28:12.736 - 00:28:52.274, Speaker A: They announced yesterday that they have partnered with ESL Gaming, which is a, the world's leading esports company. And if any of have into gaming or esports, you know, just how big ESL is. And they have partnered with them to kind of like have cs go nfts issued on the immutable x L2 network on top of Ethereum. I mean, this is amazing. Immutable. Their business development department must be insane because they are landing so many big partnerships right now, which is just really crazy to see. Obviously their technology is powered by starkware and they're not a ZK roll up, they're a validium, but they allow massive scalability for ethereum and for NFT, sorry, I should say.
00:28:52.274 - 00:29:19.984, Speaker A: And you know, they, they aren't charging any, any fees either. They're covering the fees right now. So great to see them land a huge partnership here and a disclosure. I'm an investor in immutable and I should have disclosed other things as well. Like I'm an investor in kind of like a few other things along here. I got to get that website out that um, that has some of my disclosures on there so I don't have to keep bringing it up. I know I've talked about that for a while, but, but yeah, anyway, cool to see this partnership here and I'm looking forward to seeing what ESL does on immutable x.
00:29:19.984 - 00:30:05.504, Speaker A: Speaking of Starkware, Starknet Alpha three is now live on Testnet. So they're saying here they continue to prepare for the alpha deployment on Mainnet and to improve stocknet based on user feedback in this release is improved, an improved testing framework, improved compilation time and syntax for short strings, which means this is a pretty much a developer focused kind of release. And I saw someone comment about this, someone from stock where I think comment that stocknet will actually be deployed in Alpha to Mainnet end of November. It's going to come like late November instead of early or mid. So something to keep in mind there as well. Just getting through the rest of these updates quickly. So Alchemy, blockchain infrastructure provider, announced that they have raised a massive $250 million Series C at a valuation of $3.5
00:30:05.504 - 00:30:33.396, Speaker A: billion. And this round was led by a 16 z. Now, for those of you who don't know what alchemy is, it's because it sits in the background. You will probably have used alchemy if you have used any of the apps that use it to kind of, like, offer you services. It's kind of similar to infuria, where they basically offer infrastructure for blockchain, such as nodes and, like, archive nodes, full nodes, all that sort of stuff. And obviously, this is very, very valuable for the ecosystem going forward. So this is incredible growth.
00:30:33.396 - 00:31:02.124, Speaker A: I mean. Sorry, incredible raise, and obviously incredible growth, too, because of the fact that they've been powering some of the biggest apps out there, such as Opensea, Aave, DyDx. I mean, we've all used these apps before, and they're also. They obviously support Ethereum, but they also are going to be supporting other networks, like Polygon, arbitrum, optimism and more. So, yeah, congrats on the raise to alchemy here. This is a huge raise, right? It's one of the biggest in the ecosystem, $3.5 billion valuation.
00:31:02.124 - 00:31:36.722, Speaker A: Funny thing is, is that, like, you know, I think is a token coming, isn't it? Coming? I would actually put my money on a token coming, but I don't know how you would farm the airdrop for alchemy. Like, are they just gonna air drop their token to everyone who used one of the alchemy powered apps? Maybe. Are they even gonna do a token? I don't know, but if I'm speculating and I'm kind of, like, thinking that they will. Well, yeah, I mean, will they even do an airdrop? I don't know. Like, you never. You don't really usually see a series C raise in thing. In projects that do tokens, they usually stop at series B, and most of them stop at, like, the series A or seed phase.
00:31:36.722 - 00:32:09.890, Speaker A: They don't go to a series C if they're going to do a token. So that's why I'm kind of, like, on the fence if they'll do one or not, they may just kind of, like, go public in the normal kind of way and have, like, a public equity in shares that you can. That you can purchase. But if they do do a token, they do an airdrop. I would say that there's no real way to farm it other than using the apps that they're powering, which is pretty much like a lot of apps out there. So something to keep in mind, for sure. All right, last up here is a shout out to Scott here, who basically announced a collab between ETH University and Hacklodge, which is.
00:32:09.890 - 00:32:48.776, Speaker A: And what they're kind of, like, got here is a web3 edition of Hacklodge. So what this is, is a web3 focused hacker house for undergraduates during the winter break of January 8 to 16th in the Bay Area. So if that applies to applies to you, you can apply now to Hacklodge here. The link will be linked in the YouTube description, of course. But yeah, if you're a developer or someone who wants to get involved with this sort of stuff, definitely check that out. And my pet peeve comes back to it to annoy me again by, I guess, referring to times in with seasons like winter break. It's hilarious because when I say winter break, I'm like, well, that's like July, right? Because it's winter here in July.
00:32:48.776 - 00:33:03.722, Speaker A: But no, it's January 8 to 16th, 2022, I assume. So. Definitely go check this out if that fits you. But on that note, I think I'm going to end it there. And but a quick reminder, there's an AMA tomorrow in the Discord channel. Definitely go check that out. Ask your questions in the AMA series channel.
00:33:03.722 - 00:33:22.082, Speaker A: If you can't make it, all the details are in discord in the kind of like calendar channel. So definitely go check that out. But on that note, I'm going to end it there. Thank you everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give that video a thumbs up. Subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord Channel and I'll catch you all on the AMA or on next week's refuel.
00:33:22.082 - 00:33:22.554, Speaker A: See everyone.
