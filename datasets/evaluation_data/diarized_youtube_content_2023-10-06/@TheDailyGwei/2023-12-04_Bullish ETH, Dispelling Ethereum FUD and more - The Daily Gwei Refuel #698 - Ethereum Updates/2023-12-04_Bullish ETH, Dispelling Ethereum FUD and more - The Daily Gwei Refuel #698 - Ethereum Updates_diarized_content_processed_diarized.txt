00:00:00.320 - 00:00:18.846, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of the deliberate refuel where I recap the latest news in Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Sosano. It's the 4 December 2023. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So the, it's a rare occasion today I have an ETH chart open in front of me. You guys know that I don't talk about kind of like market dynamics too much on the refuel.
00:00:18.846 - 00:00:57.598, Speaker A: I do obviously talk about ETH and why I'm bullish on it. But really, for me to have a chart up means that something special has happened. And that special thing that has happened is that ETH is finally above its range, that it has been in its crowd range that it's been in for a very long time now. And we are at the highest ETH price at time of recording, 22, 65 since. Yeah, since may of 2022. And as you can see, obviously back then we were heading down instead of up and it's kind of like the opposite right now. Now, of course, this is a huge milestone because if we take the amount of days it has been since then to today, it has been 574 days, which is a very, very long time.
00:00:57.598 - 00:01:27.258, Speaker A: Right. But I've always said to you guys that I, I thought that we'd, you know, we'd crab between one and $2,000 for quite a while. And I did say towards the end of this year, I think, I thought it would happen. I think that it got brought forward by about three ish months, especially on BTC, because of the ETF stuff. But generally, yeah, I mean, I remember saying to you guys at the start of this year that we would just crab between one and two k. And you can see here from basically the start of this year, where is it, January to basically, I guess like November. We did that.
00:01:27.258 - 00:01:45.194, Speaker A: You know, we were at like, what is it? 1200 to 2.1k. So we basically stuck in that range. And we actually spent most of the time actually between 1502.1k. So a pretty tight range there. But, you know, generally that was the range. That was the crab range there. Now, of course, we've broken above it.
00:01:45.194 - 00:02:00.882, Speaker A: BTC has also been really, really strong lately. That's obviously because of the ETF stuff that's been going on. I mean, BTT is at like 42k right now. Uh, you know, and it's kind of hard to know where it's going to go from here. Right. Because everyone's thinking, obviously the bull market is, is back on. We're in the early stages still.
00:02:00.882 - 00:02:25.202, Speaker A: But at the same time, things are getting really overheated right now. I mean, I think BTC is quite overheated right now. I wouldn't be surprised to see a big dump there and a flush out. We should obviously take the rest of the market with it. And that wouldn't be necessarily bearish. It would just mean that the market really needs to test out what, you know, what's going on and test out the liquidity and make sure that the, you know, people that are leveraged up too much get liquidated so that we can continue up. You know, there's a lot of different market dynamics at play here.
00:02:25.202 - 00:03:06.408, Speaker A: But generally when you see what you see on, on things like BTC, which right now it's on its 8th green weekly candle in a row, which is pretty crazy, right? It screams pretty overheated to me. And then you see like all this money plowing into BTC from other assets. It just screams like a Fomo trade to me. And the same happens to ETH. The same happens to pretty much like every asset, I think that gets like a bid, like not every asset in crypto, but like every asset that gets a bid like that where it's just outperforming the rest of the market and everyone's fomoing into it because they're like, oh, I gotta catch this train, you know, before it keeps going without me. And they wait until the last minute to do that because what ends up happening is that people would have seen BTC at like thirty two k and, okay, it's not going to break out there. Then it broke out, right.
00:03:06.408 - 00:04:11.272, Speaker A: I went to like thirty five k and they're like, okay, what's going to go back to 32k? Then I'll buy, right? And then it goes to like thirty eight k and they're like, oh, okay, it's going to go back down and then I'll buy, right? And then it gets to a point where they're like, you know, screw it, I'm going to buy now, whether they're in fiat or in another asset, because the other assets are obviously lagging BTC, they're like, oh, well, I'm going to sell my BTC, sorry, sell my other assets and go into BTC now. And that's usually where you see things kind of top out because you basically tap into the available pool of liquidity and available pool of money. You get all these people fomoing in, and then the earlier buyers see this and the more sophisticated buyers see this and they're like, you know, what? I'm going to take some profits here. I'm going to exit here, and I'm going to go into another asset. And that's why you see rotations happen between different assets where BTC will pump for a while and then ETH will pump for a while and then other assets will pump for a while and it'll just ping pong off of each other. And that's the reason why I've said to you guys a lot of times that, you know, one of my main bull market tips is not to chase pumps on other assets because you end up just whittling away your stack because it's very, very hard to, to trade that. And I think that most people who try to trade it will definitely lose.
00:04:11.272 - 00:04:37.647, Speaker A: And, you know, obviously we don't have insight into who's winning and who's losing. All we see is what's happening in the markets. And some people will post their p and l screenshots to Twitter. But I mean, noise, really. We don't have access to like a global p and l kind of spreadsheet or scoreboard where we can see who won on this trade or who lost on that trade. But I am fairly confident that most people lose trading, to be honest. Like on net, because it's very hard to trade.
00:04:37.647 - 00:05:30.134, Speaker A: It's very hard to trade not only crypto markets, but all markets, but crypto in particular there. So yeah, I'm definitely not bearish, but at the same time, I always like, look at what's happening in the, in the broader market. I'm like, okay, if is getting pretty overheated right now, it's getting pretty hot right now. And as I said to you guys, I can, I can imagine a thing where, you know, we've pumped up to where we are now, especially with BTC, it goes down, maybe it goes back down to like thirty five k and wrecks everyone and then just spikes up from there and then BTC hangs around going sideways for, for a little while, right? That can easily happen. And a little while could be three to six months still, right? It just depends because I do think a lot of the bid is definitely in anticipation of the ETF, the ETF itself. I mean, like there's always the sell the news event stuff that people talk about and trading around that is really hard. I'm sure there's going to be a ton of volatility around it once it does eventually get approved, stuff like that.
00:05:30.134 - 00:06:05.580, Speaker A: But generally, if you're a longer term investor, which I'm sure a lot of you guys are. And if you've kind of listened to what I've said over the past couple of years, at least, I mean, on the show, I've been, I've been singing the same tune where it's basically, you know, we're in this four year cycle that I think has been brought forward a little bit now because of the ETF stuff. It may just be like a 3.5 year cycle, right, instead of a four year cycle. But we're in this long term cycle where essentially that, you know, you buy during the crabs and you sell when things get, like, really, really hot. And, you know, saying it out loud like that makes it sound easy, but it's not easy. And I think that it's much easier to actually buy in a crab than it is to sell, um, during the tops.
00:06:05.580 - 00:06:47.114, Speaker A: Because if you actually go back and look at how much time you actually have to sell, you don't have that much time. And, you know, you can look at how violent it is during the 2021, uh, in particular kind of, uh, uh, bull market and how, you know, the craziness, obviously, of that new all time high that we hit. But I've said before about how I thought this was just all driven by leverage. But if you go back and actually look at previous cycles, so not the 2020, 2021 cycle, you look at the 2017 cycle here, you don't have very long to sell the top. I mean, you can, if I scroll in here and actually, I show you guys what I mean here. So these are weekly candles. If you actually look at all of the price that ETH spent above, I guess, 700, how long did ETH spend above 700? Because ETH obviously went to 1420.
00:06:47.114 - 00:07:06.762, Speaker A: So how long did it spend above 700 before it kind of came down? It only spent 70 days above, above that price. Right. So if you wanted to sell anywhere close to the top, you had 70 days to do it. And if you were talking about doing it on the way up, you had less time than that. You had like two weeks, three weeks to do it. Right. You had like 21 days to do it.
00:07:06.762 - 00:07:38.514, Speaker A: Um, and then you obviously from, from there, there are bounces here and there, but generally it just continues down. Um, you know, and we're going to a bear market now. If we look at the crab market and how long you actually have to buy between the defined crab range of 103 hundred for ETH back in 2019, right. You basically, or in 2018, you basically have from here to here to buy between one and $300. That's, that's the whole range you had there, that's 616 days. That is way more. Way more than what you had to sell.
00:07:38.514 - 00:07:57.614, Speaker A: Right? And, of course, you know, different. There's different price points. You can. You can buy and sell here between one and $300, obviously. But if you bought at $200 as an average buy price there, you had 600 plus days to do it. Whereas if you want to sell anywhere near the top, you have maybe a month to do it. Right? You know, maybe.
00:07:57.614 - 00:08:21.190, Speaker A: Maybe six weeks or something like that. You have a very, very short period of time to do it. And that's why I'm saying to you guys that it is very hard to time any, any of this stuff. But at the same time, it's much, much harder to time things on the way up than it is to time things on, you know, during the crab market, on the way down. It's also pretty brutal because, like, you buy because things have gone down 50%, you're like, oh, it's not going to go down more, more than that. Well, hello. Yes, it does.
00:08:21.190 - 00:08:47.478, Speaker A: I mean, if we just look at the last cycle, what happened, you can go to the top, which was 4900 for ETH here, right? And then it's gone down 50%. And we're at what? We're at 2400, and you're like, okay, I'll buy here. Then ETH goes to dollar 880, right? So, like, you're buying 50% down, you're thinking you're getting a bargain. But then you buy here, and then it goes to 880, and it goes down another 64%. So, again, like, buying in. In bear markets is brutal. Buy.
00:08:47.478 - 00:09:10.700, Speaker A: Selling in bull markets is brutal. It's just very, very hard to. To be able to time anywhere close to the top. That's why I've always been an advocate of, like, DCA ing in and DCA ing out. But at least in the crab market, as you can see here, you have just such a long period of time to stack between a defined range. And that has been true for every single cycle in crypto so far. I mean, if you go to BTC, actually, I'll bring up the.
00:09:10.700 - 00:09:29.240, Speaker A: The all time BTC chart. You can see this play out basically, like, every single time, it's the same story. Right? You see the spikes. Very, you know, very quick spikes. But then you see, like, the crab market, and kind of the recovery takes much longer there. So, yeah, anyway, something to. To keep in mind there and something to keep track of there.
00:09:29.240 - 00:09:54.230, Speaker A: But, yeah, enough on the. On the price talk. Just great to see that ETH has broken out of that range there. And yeah, I think that ETH will definitely continue up from here, but there will be turbulence. Guys, like, do not expect a nice little run up. And honestly, like, as I've been saying this, I just looked at my other charts that I've got another screen and like the market is actually already selling off. BTC sold off a bit, but like the rest of the market is selling off pretty hard right now.
00:09:54.230 - 00:10:13.634, Speaker A: I mean, I'm looking at Coingecko. Some things are down like 510 percent. Like, literally, as I said, guys, I was watching BTC go to 42K just before and I was saying to some friends, I'm like, we're about to see a nuke. And I mean, sure enough, you know, maybe we're seeing the beginnings of a nuke right now. But again, as I said, this is short term stuff. This is not long term stuff. It doesn't mean anything for the bull market.
00:10:13.634 - 00:10:34.930, Speaker A: It is really just like a healthy test of kind of liquidity. It's a healthy flush out of just like over leveraged speculation. And then from then on, we continue up. And honestly, it might be the thing that gets ETH moving again because I know that ETH has been lagging BTC. It might be the thing that people, where people are like, okay, well, BTC had its run. It's cooling off now. It's going to go sideways for a bit.
00:10:34.930 - 00:11:06.388, Speaker A: I'm going to jump into Ethan basically, so we could see that as well. But again, I'm not trying to kind of make any short term predictions here, but really, it always, it always, it's always pretty obvious to me when I see that things that, you know, things raging up really, really hard and then people like fomoing in me being like, okay, that doesn't look very healthy right now and I'm expecting a kind of pullback there, but we'll see how it goes. Maybe by the end of the episode things are going to go and go down even more. Maybe by the time you've, you're watching this episode, it's down even more or it's up even more. I don't know. But as I said, like a time of recording. That's kind of what's happening here.
00:11:06.388 - 00:11:29.892, Speaker A: Anyway, moving on from that to some non price related stuff. Well, I guess this is a little bit price related. This is about the BTC ETF. So James, Sci-Fi confirmed that the official window is Jan. Fifth to January 10, as I mentioned last week. But realistically it will happen on January 8, Jan. 9th or January 10, and it being the approval of the BTC spot ETF's and because those are weekdays.
00:11:29.892 - 00:12:02.614, Speaker A: Now, if you were a betting person, which we all are, because we're all buying crypto, you would say that it would happen on Jan 8th, right? On Monday, Jan 8th, because it's the start of the week. So I'm going to say that, right? I mean, maybe if it happens, maybe it happens sooner than that, but if I had to pick a date between Jan. 8th, 9th and 10th, I would pick Jan. 8th. So Monday, January 8, it might happen there. And you know, it's funny because like that is, as I've said in the past, the perfect time for it to happen. You have ETF hype into halvening hype into proper bull market.
00:12:02.614 - 00:12:24.630, Speaker A: Like, yeah, I don't know, I feel like the stars aligned for this, basically. But yeah, that's the window we've got Jan. 8th, 9th or 10th. We'll see how it plays out. And obviously I'll keep you guys updated on all of that. All right, so Proto Lambda posted this tweet last week that I shared with you guys of his testing of a bunch of wallets within the Ethereum ecosystem. And it was quite a long tweet, actually.
00:12:24.630 - 00:13:01.852, Speaker A: He went through the pros and cons of different wallets and what he likes and what he doesn't like about them. And today or not today, I think yesterday, he has started development on his own wallet called Grug Wallet. So Grug is a self aware and he is not a web3 wallet dev and is going to build it differently. So you can go check out what this actually is and kind of what the rationale is here. It's quite extensive, actually, what proto Lambda has been able to, has been able to, has been able to put together here. But yeah, I mean, this is something to keep an eye on because I think that he has a really, really great kind of view of the wallet landscape right now, and he's basically being the change he wants to see in the world. So yeah, definitely go check this out.
00:13:01.852 - 00:13:32.052, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But I didn't want to spend too much time talking about the specific wallet in general. I did want to spend a little bit of time talking about just wallets generally and how I think that there's going to be a massive consolidation of the wallet space over the next few years. There's not going to be hundreds of wallets, guys. Like, I really don't think there's going to be hundreds of wallets like, it doesn't make sense for there to be hundreds of wallets. I mean, there's going to be hundreds of wallets in that they'll exist, but I'm talking like market share. I think that there is only going to be a small handful that will have the majority of the market share here.
00:13:32.052 - 00:14:12.920, Speaker A: I really don't think we're going to have 100 wallets that all have huge market share. And I think the best wallets are once again going to be the ones that abstract away the most amount of stuff and make it the easiest way possible for people to interact with on chain products. And that's what I've been saying obviously, for many months now, where we need to get it down to like two or three clicks to do anything, the wallets that do that are the winners because that's how you on board the average user. Like right now. All your, the people that you're onboarding to your wallets right now are the more sophisticated users. Even if your wallet is like really easy to use, you're basically onboarding the users who are willing to put in the work to actually understand what's going on. Now, the masses aren't going to do that.
00:14:12.920 - 00:14:45.416, Speaker A: The vast majority of people are not going to do that. They're not going to spend the effort doing that. So to onboard them, you need to essentially simplify everything down to two or three clicks. And that's why I'm saying that the wallet that does that will be the big winner because that'll be the one that people use and recommend to their friends and family. And we'll get a critical mass because it'll be so easy to do anything. And of course, you know, there's always going to be ways for more advanced users to do more advanced things. Like, that's the beauty of the crypto ecosystem, I guess, like, the beauty of technology really is that you can go as deep as you want to go, as advanced as you want to go.
00:14:45.416 - 00:15:26.100, Speaker A: I should say open source technology because obviously with certain ecosystems, you can't, like, for example, you're very limited in what you can do in the Apple ecosystem compared to the Android ecosystem. But with ethereum generally, it's open permissionless, you know, open source. So you can do anything you want. You can use the really, really simplified wallet, or you can use the really, really complex wallet, or you can, you know, use a wallet at all and basically, um, interact with it on the command line, right? So there's always different kind of ways to interact with this stuff. And I, but as I said like, the masses are never going to do that. Like just think about the masses using Linux desktop, right? That's not going to happen. I mean even the enthusiasts don't really use Linux, Linux desktop, right, or even the command line generally.
00:15:26.100 - 00:16:22.332, Speaker A: So that, that's how I think about it today, where we have these wallets, which are not simple, they require additional knowledge, they require people to put in the work to do anything. But opportunity lies in that, right? I mean, like think about how many people have made lots of money from like airdrops, things like that, from just being involved with ecosystems, even though it's clunky, even though it's expensive because of gas fees, even though it's just not a simplified experience. But over the long term, you know, ten plus years, there is going to be a small handful of wallets and they're going to be ones that have just simplified everything down. And you know, ideally some of them give the user the ability to do whatever they want, still like, you know, advanced user, but there are going to be some that, that looks very, look like a very locked in experience just from I guess like a pure monetization perspective. But yeah, that's my general view on how the wallet space is going to play out over the long term. And I'm not going to say what my favorite wallet is right now, to be honest, because I don't want to play favorites or pick favorites here. I will say that I enjoy using a bunch of different wallets.
00:16:22.332 - 00:16:50.194, Speaker A: I mean, I've been testing them out. I don't really enjoy using metamask. I should say that first, it is definitely like very behind the competition in terms of feature set and in terms of like usability just for the average person. But I will say that I've really enjoyed Rabi, I've enjoyed Tahoe, Rainbow Wallet and Coinbase wallet. Those are the main ones that I've been testing around and they've been pretty smooth and pretty cool. But again, they're still nowhere near simple enough for the average user. And it'll get there.
00:16:50.194 - 00:17:13.406, Speaker A: It'll get there, but yeah, it's not there right now. Anyway, enough on that topic. Moving on to the next thing I wanted to talk about, which was something that came across called ZKE email. So they've introduced their audited ZKe email v one SDK. So their solution powers ZKP two P, which is a project I've talked about before. And emailwallet.org bridge bring bridging off chain data with on chain actions.
00:17:13.406 - 00:17:59.788, Speaker A: We've only begun to explore innovative, trust free web two to web3 interfaces. And I mean, that's the key here, right? We've only begun to explore this. Cause I've said to you guys before that ZK tech is really cool for scaling, but ZK tech is way cooler for privacy, and it enables way more action like way more kind of use cases in the privacy realm than it does in the scaling realm, in my opinion. Because with ZK in the privacy realm, you get things like this. You get ZK email, you get ZK p two p. You are able to essentially verify things that are true without needing people's information, right. You're able to do decentralized KYC and AML, and you're able to essentially not collect data and just collect the ZK proof.
00:17:59.788 - 00:18:41.414, Speaker A: So there is a whole world here of things outside of scaling when it comes to ZK in the world of privacy. And they unlock huge amounts of non financial use cases, which, as I've said in the past plenty of times, I want to see more of. And they also unlock a huge amount of potential for mixing those use cases with the scalability gains as well. Because a lot of these things obviously going to be done off chain, but they can be done off chain at L2, because L2 is technically, I mean, it is taking it off chain, right. And then put the proof on chain so that you have those security guarantees. You have that proof on Ethereum, layer one to basically guarantee that. And that alone opens up, like just a massive world of non financial use cases that I'm super excited about.
00:18:41.414 - 00:19:35.620, Speaker A: So if you're as excited about that as I am, you can go check out Zke email for yourself. But also, you know, you guys should check out ZkP two P, which is a trustless fiat on ramp, which, as I've said in the past, and I remember saying that I thought that we couldn't do a decentralized fiat on an off ramp, but we are able to do a trustless fiat on an off ramp. And what I mean by this is that obviously in the fiat world, everything is centralized, and ZK p two P uses Venmo, which is centralized, and any USD that's being sent over Venmo is part of the tradfi centralized system. But the thing is, is that we can merge ZK tech into that and basically make it trustless, because now we generate a ZK proof for that onboarding, and we basically create a marketplace of on ramping and off ramping. And you basically use a ZK proof to make it a trustless marketplace. So there's no need to trust your counterparty. You know, that they're telling the truth and what they're doing is right, because you're using a ZK proof to prove that.
00:19:35.620 - 00:19:50.458, Speaker A: Right. So, yeah, trustless fiat on an off ramping, I think, is probably the best we're gonna get. We're not going to get decentralized fiat on and off ramping because fiat is not issued in a decentralized fashion. It is a centralized world. Right. Tradfi is a centralized world, but that's fine. I don't think that's a big deal.
00:19:50.458 - 00:20:24.354, Speaker A: I think having trustless fiat on and off ramps is a big deal. So you could definitely go check out ZkP two p as well, if you haven't yet. All right, so obviously, over the last few weeks in particular, there's been a lot of FUD about Ethereum guys. Like, a lot of fuD. And, you know, this is, I guess, like nothing new for me. I've been putting up with this Fud about Ethereum for many years now, but I put out a tweet over the weekend where I said, seeing a lot of Ethereum hate and fud lately, that frankly makes me sad because it is diminishing the hard work of all the builders. So to all the Ethereum builders out there, keep going, keep building, keep innovating, and keep delivering real value to real people.
00:20:24.354 - 00:21:09.970, Speaker A: And the reason I put this out there is because I don't necessarily think too many builders pay much attention to crypto Twitter or pay attention to the narrative of the week. But at the same time, it's hard not to get down about things when you literally have people on crypto Twitter trashing all the work that you're doing, whether it's building L2s, whether it's building Defi, whether it's building Ethereum core protocol stuff. You know, it's hard to not get down when someone is out there just trashing your work, especially if they're trashing it with FUD, which is literally not based in reality, which is literally not based in truth. And I always try to stick to the truth. Like, I. I mean, over the weekend, I was caught a propaganda machine, which I thought was hilarious, because I'm like, how am I a propaganda machine? Like, I don't think that I spread lies or misinformation about anything, really, even about other ecosystems. I try my hardest to stick to the truth.
00:21:09.970 - 00:21:32.186, Speaker A: And if I ever get something wrong, I admit it. At least I think I do. Maybe I'm going crazy and taking crazy pills here. But generally, I think when you look at all the fud that's been going on, all the hate that's been going on, it's just followed the price, right? ETH has obviously, as an asset, hasn't gone up as much as other things have over the past few months and other ecosystems. And then everyone starts saying, oh, ETH is dead. You know, this is going to flip. ETH.
00:21:32.186 - 00:21:52.960, Speaker A: ETH is lagging. Ethereum tech is shit. And I really hate these, these types of people who do this, because when, when they do this, it's just literally following the price. They're just pumping bags like it's not based in any kind of reality. It's basically them being like, oh, this thing pumped. And I made a bit of money here and I wanted to pump more. So I'm just going to come up with total bullshit about Ethereum because it's good for my bags.
00:21:52.960 - 00:22:27.394, Speaker A: Like, doesn't make any sense. I mean, it makes sense if you look at it from that perspective. But like the fud itself and the hate itself is just stupid, it's just noise. And that's why, you know, I said just before, I don't think the builders necessarily pay too much attention to this, but it still would get them down, I believe. And you know, as a segue from, from this tweet here, I came across another interesting tweet from, from DC investor, uh, today, or today I guess, a couple of days ago, where he said people thought Ethereum would never have real working apps, but then it did. They thought people would never show up to use Ethereum, but then they did. They thought it would never implement Erp 1559, but then it did.
00:22:27.394 - 00:23:11.186, Speaker A: They thought it would never implement proof of stake and turn off proof of work, but then it did. And they thought staking wouldn't be enough to secure the network, but then it is. Now they are saying Ethereum will never fully decentralize its l two s. But then it will. Like the amount of milestones the Ethereum ecosystem has hit over the years and the amount of FUD that we've been able to squash with real deliverables and the amount of people that have been proven wrong time and time again about Ethereum is astronomical at this point. And they still continue down this road of doubting the Ethereum ecosystem. And at this point, like, I think that it's never going to stop because there's competing financial incentives here, of course, but really, like in the face of all of the stuff that's happened in the past and all the stuff that Ethereum has delivered and all of the people that Ethereum has proven wrong.
00:23:11.186 - 00:24:11.376, Speaker A: Do you really think that saying something like Ethereum's l two s were never decentralized isn't is a deal you really want to die on? Because from where I'm sitting it's not. I truly believe that the l two s will decentralize and obviously they're on their own journeys. They have different milestones to meet depending on which l two it is, and they will get to the decentralized state at different times. But to say that they're never going to decentralize and to say that they're always going to be centralized is to me an insane thing to say. And to me it just screams that either you're uninformed and haven't done your research, or you're just saying that because you want to make Ethereum look bad because it really is the new narrative that people have pivoted to. Remember when I said to you guys that, you know, once l two s start growing more, they're gonna come up with some batshit insane narratives to justify hating the l two s? Because originally they said the l two s wouldn't work at all and then they said that the l two s wouldn't actually get any usage. And then they did, they did work and they did get usage and now they're saying that, okay, well, you know, l two s did get usage and they do work, but they're never gonna decentralize.
00:24:11.376 - 00:24:40.802, Speaker A: And it's just like, okay, you just shift in the goal posts again, but like we'll just prove you wrong again. But then as soon as we prove them wrong again we what do you think's gonna happen? They're gonna say something else. They're gonna be like, oh, you know, you know, it still sucks because of fragmented liquidity. Like they're saying that right now, but again, like this isn't based in any sort of reality, at least from where I'm sitting, at least from where I am, because I'm obviously very plugged in. And if they're uninformed, then fair enough. But go inform yourself before spouting off nonsense like that, I guess. Publicly especially.
00:24:40.802 - 00:25:13.630, Speaker A: But yeah, anyway, I'm gonna digress on that point there. Cause I realize I'm already at 25 minutes here and I wanna cover the bunch of other things that I had that I wanted to cover, which is actually segue from this. And you'll notice that it's not Twitter tabs that I've got up here, it's actually tabs of various different altimetric tracking sites. And the reason I have this up is because I was just talking about how people are doubting the ethereum ecosystem still, and they're doubting the l two s. I want to show you guys something. Now, none of these metrics are perfect. They can all be gamed, right? They all have their own flaws, but taken holistically, it paints a picture here.
00:25:13.630 - 00:25:24.150, Speaker A: So let's look on l two b.com. Comma. You see that TVL for l two s is at all time highs. Hmm. Okay. I thought l two s weren't working. I thought l two s weren't getting usage.
00:25:24.150 - 00:25:41.944, Speaker A: I thought people didn't like l two s because of fragmented liquidity or because they weren't decentralized, or this, that and the other. Well, it seems like people love l two s because the TVL is at all time high. Then we can go to the activity tab and we'll see what's in there. Right. This includes ETH mainnet in the blue, but if we go to the red, what does it look like? Well, it looks pretty healthy to me. This is TPS. Looks pretty healthy to me.
00:25:41.944 - 00:25:57.464, Speaker A: Looks like it's been going up slowly over time. And as I said, like none of these metrics are perfect, but looks pretty good to me. Then we can go to daily active addresses for Altoos and Ethereum. Well, would you look at that? It's up. Only we take away Ethereum. The altars are up. Only got a transaction count.
00:25:57.464 - 00:26:27.644, Speaker A: Take away Ethereum because takeaway Ethereum, layer one, I should say. And look at the transaction count. Looks pretty healthy to me. You can smooth this, I mean, this is, I think, smooth over seven days, but you can smooth it even more because obviously there's going to be peaks and stuff, but it looks really healthy to me there. All right, so that's Ethereum and its l two s. But what about Ethereum itself? Well, I mean, Ethereum itself is doing just fine if you want to look at any metric in Ethereum, whether it's active addresses or transaction count, which you can see here. And transaction count is kind of has a ceiling, obviously, because of the gas limit.
00:26:27.644 - 00:26:53.642, Speaker A: And then daily active addresses, Ethereum is doing just fine. But then let's go to the more things that can't really be faked or are impossible or expensive to fake or impossible and expensive to game. And that thing is Ethereum fee revenue. Right? And I've always said this, but let's go ultrasound money website. Hmm. What's that? Well, since the merge, we've been deflationary for a very long time. Actually, since January of this year, the entire year, we've been net deflationary.
00:26:53.642 - 00:27:06.268, Speaker A: Since the merge, we've burned over a million ETH. Right. Which is more than we've issued. We only issued 866,000 ETH. Okay. If we go into a shorter time frame, let's do over the last, even 30 days. Right? We're deflationary.
00:27:06.268 - 00:27:25.812, Speaker A: ETH is burning there. And then if we scroll down and we go to some of the kind of, like, USD values. Here we go. Over the last 30 days, just because I can't select anything longer than that, except the merge, which is a bit long. Let's look at USD value. So we've burned $217 million worth of fees. I think it's about 70% to 80% of all fees paid on the network.
00:27:25.812 - 00:27:34.872, Speaker A: All right, then look. Let's look at the burn leaderboard. What is it? Well, it's the usual suspects. It's uniswap. It's ETH transfers, stable coins. But then look down here. There's l two s here.
00:27:34.872 - 00:27:50.904, Speaker A: Arbitrum, over the last 30 days, has paid $4.5 million to Ethereum l one in order to be a roll up on top of ethereum there. And you can scroll down, you'll see other l two s that paid. A little bit less optimism. It's 2.7 million. You keep scrolling down, you'll see more base at 1.4
00:27:50.904 - 00:28:14.036, Speaker A: million. Hmm. Seems like Ethereum l one is still doing amazingly even in the face of the l two s growing. But I was told that l two s would take all the activity off of l one. I was told that the l one gas prices would be single digits again, which is hilarious fight, considering people were fighting the fact that they were high. But gas prices have been high for quite a while now. The last 30 days have been above the ultrasound barrier for most of it.
00:28:14.036 - 00:28:27.650, Speaker A: We go since the merge, and you can actually see that, you know, we've. We've been above it for. For a little while, and we've been far above it. I mean, again, go to the last 30 days. How. How far above it have we been? The ultrasound barrier is currently at 22 Guaya. We've been way higher than that.
00:28:27.650 - 00:28:54.382, Speaker A: But I was told that no one uses the l two s. I was told that they're crap and they fragment liquidity, and I was told that even if people did use them, it would suck everything up from layer one, and then layer one, ethereum would suffer. But if we actually look at the facts, none of that is true, guys. Like, I'm shocked. I know I'm being a smart ass, but you see my point here. None of the reality matches with the narrative, like, at all. Like, the narrative is total crap.
00:28:54.382 - 00:29:25.038, Speaker A: It literally is a fugazi. It is completely made up. And the fact that people believe these narratives and latch onto them like they're actually true without just looking at the very obvious metrics that we have that show that they're not true is mind blowing to me. And the only reason that people do this, in my opinion, the only reason, is because they have bags in other ecosystems, they have investments in other ecosystems, and they have no interest in the truth. They have no interest in reality. They want their bags to go up. They want to make money.
00:29:25.038 - 00:29:50.390, Speaker A: There's nothing wrong with making money. There's nothing wrong with wanting your bags to go up. But if you're fighting Ethereum and if you're spreading all this nonsense just because that's your goal, then I don't respect you. Right? I don't respect it. I don't respect that at all. And I think that it's incredibly damaging to the space overall because you just keep that toxicity circle going, because then the Ethereum people hit back, and they're just like, this is not true. And then everything just gets toxic, and it just becomes a mess.
00:29:50.390 - 00:30:26.744, Speaker A: So at the end of the day, I know all of you listening and watching to the refuel don't need to be told this, but maybe you can tell other people at the end of the day, the narrative may be more powerful than the reality over the short term, but you can't escape reality. And the reality is that ethereum layer one and L2 is still growing. It's still growing more than the other ecosystems. There is still people using layer one, even though they're using L2s as well. And each layer caters to different audiences. And we are burning ETH during all of that l two s burn ETH because they settled down to l one. L1 activity burns ETH.
00:30:26.744 - 00:30:46.000, Speaker A: It makes ETH a stronger asset. It makes ETH go up. It makes it so the ethereum ecosystem has more money to play with, and it makes Ethereum overall more and more likely to succeed into the future and more and more likely to keep growing. Anyway, enough. That's a. That's a rant I just realized. I ranted for a while there, but you guys know I'm very passionate about these things.
00:30:46.000 - 00:31:09.904, Speaker A: And hopefully I was able to kind of like, I don't know, squash some concerns you may have from some of the stuff that you're reading on crypto Twitter lately or elsewhere of people fighting ethereum. I can confidently say the ethereum has never been in a better place. Right from every angle that you look at it. And the reality doesn't lie here. It's not just the narrative, it is reality. But on that note, that's going to be it for today. So thank everyone for listening and watching.
