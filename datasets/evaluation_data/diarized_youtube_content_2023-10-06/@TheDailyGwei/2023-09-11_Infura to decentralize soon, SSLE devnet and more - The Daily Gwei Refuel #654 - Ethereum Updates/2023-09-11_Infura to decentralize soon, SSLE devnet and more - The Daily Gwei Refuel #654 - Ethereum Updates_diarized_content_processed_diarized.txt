00:00:00.160 - 00:01:00.726, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the deliberate refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Sozano, and today's the 11 September 2023. All right, everyone, let's get into it. So first off today we have a bit of, I guess, regulatory related stuff to talk through. So Bill Hughes here, who is a lawyer at consensus and formerly actually worked at the Department of Justice and a bunch of other kind of places like the White House and such, put together a tweet today, I mean today over the weekend, that's quite long, talking about how consensus submitted a letter in response to the July 11 letter from the Senate Finance Committee leaders requesting input to address the uncertain tax treatment of digital assets. Now, of course, this has been a big topic of discussion for people in the US because we obviously want crypto related tax things to be treated fairly and, and basically on, on par with how I guess, like generally investments are treated for tax purposes. But also be mindful of the fact that crypto has various different intricacies to it when it comes to tax.
00:01:00.726 - 00:01:36.154, Speaker A: Like for example, going from ETH to wrapped ETH shouldn't be considered a taxable event because of the fact that Ethan wrapped ether basically the same asset, right? That for all intents and purposes, they are the same asset. The only reason why you go from ETH to wrap deeth is so that you can use your ETH within defi because wrapdeeth is an Arc 20 token and it's just much easier integrate with that than it is to integrate with naked ETH. And same for things like, you know, staked ETH tokens, stuff like that. There is definitely nuances to crypto when it comes to to tax related things. They need to be ironed out here. But you can go give Bill's whole tweet a read. I'll link it in the YouTube description below.
00:01:36.154 - 00:02:20.786, Speaker A: But the TLDR is that he said here, Congress needs to be careful not to impose a tax regime on digital assets that make blockchain ecosystems unusable for Americans. There are many targeted improvements to the tax code that could bring clarity and a sensible taxing policy to digital assets and to a large extent put them on par with other assets. But this regime absolutely cannot make using and building blockchain protocols a practical impossibility for Americans. And he continues, this technology is intended to be used, not just a number go up investment scheme. The tax law should encourage the former rather than ensuring the latter. Also, while these issues are important, the finance committee needs to closely watch the treasury and IR's rulemaking around broker dealer reporting requirements. New legislation may be required to avoid potential catastrophic damage to us development and use of blockchain protocols.
00:02:20.786 - 00:03:20.026, Speaker A: So this is basically what I was saying before about how there's a lot of intricacies when it comes to different blockchain networks, digital assets, crypto generally that isn't currently legislated on and there's not really any great guidance on a lot of. It is a gray area right now, especially these things around broker dealer reporting requirements and who is a money transmitter and who isn't, you know, who needs to report things to the tax authorities. For example, in some of the wording that I've seen on some of the proposed regulations, which aren't kind of, I guess, like a part of the regulations yet they just proposed would be that Uniswap labs would have to basically kind of get everyone's data somehow, or everyone that uses the Uniswap protocols data and basically pass that on to the Treasury Department, something like that. Or the IR's. It, you know, it's really just impossible recording reporting requirements. And Bill Hughes's whole point here is basically that we need to avoid, well, the US needs to avoid falling into that and needs to actually put together sensible regulations and legislation around this. But yeah, as I said, you can go give this a full read for yourself.
00:03:20.026 - 00:03:48.778, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, we have the latest all core devs recap here from Christine Kim. So def devnet nine. So the ERP 4844 den kun Devnet nine launch is expected on Tuesday, September 12, which of course is tomorrow. The decision on the target slash max blob count is pending more 48 44 testing. So that hasn't been decided on yet, but that is a very simple thing to decide upon. It is not going to really lead to any kind of delays or anything.
00:03:48.778 - 00:04:33.314, Speaker A: But yeah, they obviously want to keep testing it. And decision on DAP lions proposal to limit validator churn is also pending, will be discussed on the next all core devs call. So I did go over DAP lions tweet from the other day about this new EIP that would propose, sorry, that would set a validator churn limits, and that limit would be twelve validators per epoch. And that was obviously done because there was some, some concerns around the validator set growing too quickly before it could be, I guess, addressed with other upgrades. Now, I did mention last week when I covered this that I don't think it's really urgent at this state. And I really think that there's no need to put this churn limit in place. But I guess we'll see on the next all core devs call what they kind of decide on based on community input because I've already seen a bunch of community members talking about this and it's going to be an interesting call, that's for sure.
00:04:33.314 - 00:04:53.742, Speaker A: But yeah, Devnet nine launching tomorrow, big deal. As I said, I expect there to be, you know, probably Devnet nine, Devnet ten and maybe eleven. And obviously we have the whole ski testnet also launching this week on, on the 15th, which is day wise, I think it's Friday. Yeah, Friday. Friday the 15th. Friday the 15th would. No, that's Friday the 13th.
00:04:53.742 - 00:05:09.706, Speaker A: I'm getting mixed up there. Friday the 15th, one year since the, the merger. Obviously it's going to be the merge anniversary, but that's when the whole ski testnet is launching. And then after that. Yeah. It just remains to be seen what the timing is around getting Den Koon onto these test nets. Obviously sepolia girly as well.
00:05:09.706 - 00:05:36.664, Speaker A: I don't know if girly is being shut down. I don't think it is being shut down straight away when Holski launches. So I wonder if they're going to fork that and then shut it down. Kind of like what they did with the, the, was it the Ropston testnet back in the day? I think they forked that to like the merge and then ended up shutting it down or something like that, if I remember incorrectly there. But yeah, it remains to be seen how that shakes out there. But I'm sure we'll get more information on that on the next all core devs call, which is coming up soon here. But you can go give this full recap a read.
00:05:36.664 - 00:06:37.010, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you to do so. All right, Tim Baiko put together a little mini thread in response to essentially John here pointing out that on token terminals website they had listed that ETH holders own and govern the Ethereum protocol, which obviously isn't true considering that Ethereum doesn't have on chain governance and ETH holders have no say over, I guess, what happens on the protocol in a direct way. Obviously as ETH holders you are like a community member, you can participate in off chain governance and all that stuff there. But Tim Biker put together a little mini thread talking about how I guess Ethereum governance works and how the Ethereum protocol rules are enforced. So he says the rules of the Ethereum protocol are enforced by nodes on the network. These can be modified by network upgrades, which both validator and full nodes must explicitly opt in by updating their software, nodes will only connect to peers sharing their protocol rules. In the case of competing forks, all stakeholders, from users to applications and infrastructure, must socially coordinate on which one to treat as canonical.
00:06:37.010 - 00:07:11.434, Speaker A: And then he goes on and gives a little bit of history here, saying, historically, most network upgrades have not been contentious and have happened smoothly. In 2016, a contentious upgrade led to the creation of Ethereum classic. In 2022, Ethereum's transition to proof of stake led to a short lived minority proof of work fork. So, yeah, I mean, he's basically going over what the kind of Ethereum governance process is like, as well as how Ethereum enforces protocol rules. It's obviously very similar to bitcoin, except bitcoin doesn't really have hard forks or upgrades or anything like that. So Ethereum is very different in that way. But in terms of the rules being enforced, it's just enforced by nodes on the network.
00:07:11.434 - 00:08:05.380, Speaker A: And then if there needs to be a change, such as a network upgrade, the community comes together and agrees and has to opt in to, to that upgrade, or they can fork off if they want, like what happened with the Dow and what happened with this kind of minority proof of work fork. But I think the circumstances around both of those forks are very different. Right? The Dow happened from an ideological sense, where people disagree with the fact that the, I guess like the community agree, or most of the community agreed to reverse the Dow hack and basically, well, not technically reverse because the chain wasn't rolled back, but to basically return the funds to the Dow participants and take them away from the exploiter. And then in 2022, the minority proof of work fork was literally just done for profit reasons. There was no ideology here or anything like that. It was literally just done as a money grab. So two very, very different circumstances, but both led to the same outcome of the forks themselves just dying off.
00:08:05.380 - 00:08:58.224, Speaker A: Ethereum classic has obviously been irrelevant for many years now, and ETH pal, as it was known, is completely irrelevant. I mean, it was about basically a month after it launched. No one cares about it, even from a money make money, make money making perspective there. But the reason why I bring this little thread up is because it's a good reminder that Ethereum does not have on chain governance. I know there are certain people out there that try to push this narrative that because Ethereum is proof of stake it has on chain governance, that is not true at all. As I said, ETH token holders or anyone that holds ETH has absolutely no direct say over the changes that happen in the protocol and over the governance of the protocol, because it's not like we do a kind of binding votes with ETH. So let's say you have a smart contract on chain or something that, or basically it's built into the Ethereum protocol that says, okay, while the majority of ETH vote one way, then, sorry, if the majority of ETH vote one way, well, then that's the way we're going.
00:08:58.224 - 00:09:37.230, Speaker A: That's not how it works at all. It relies on basically all stakeholders, whether they own ETH or not, to explicitly upgrade, and it relies on the super majority of them in order for the network to continue on as it is now. Governance, of course, is very messy. Even, even with on chain governance, ultimately, it can always be forked, right? You could, for example, there's a few chains out there that have on chain governance where essentially the token holders vote, and then that's binding in the end, and then the network upgrades because of that. But if people disagree with that and want to change that, they ultimately could. Like, let's just say, for example, one of these networks had the majority of the, of the community of them say, okay, well, we don't want on chain governance anymore. We want to actually fork that out.
00:09:37.230 - 00:10:12.542, Speaker A: They could, they just have to fork the chain. And then if the majority agree with that, that would become the new chain and that chain wouldn't have on chain governance anymore. So realistically, ultimately, it's still all off chain governance in the end. Right? You can have on chain governance, but, uh, but the ultimate form of governance is always off chain. It's always the people that run the actual nodes, run the validators and all that stuff that surrounds that there. So, no, no, Ethereum does not have any form of binding on chain governance, any form of coin holder governance at all. You could always do like soft votes where you say there is actually a service for this.
00:10:12.542 - 00:11:00.190, Speaker A: I don't know if it's still live, but it was traditionally used more in the, in the past called queen vote, where essentially as an ETH altar, you could go there and vote with your coins and it wouldn't be binding or anything. It's literally just like a poll. Essentially, it has the same power as a pole, but you could make your voice heard like that. But obviously, the reason why that is not something desirable. I mean, there's many different reasons, but the top reason is because we don't want the people with the most ETH, aka, the most money dictating the direction of the protocol, because then it just turns into a plutocracy and it really just goes against exactly what Ethereum wants to be. So yeah, hopefully that's a nice little refresher for you guys on that one, but I'll link Tim's tweet thread in the YouTube description below for you to check out. All right, so some exciting news about the single secret leader election, or SSLE feature upgrade that is planned for one of Ethereum's hard forks here.
00:11:00.190 - 00:11:37.734, Speaker A: So Dap lion shared that there is a stable Devnet running with a proof of concept of SSLe on a fork of lighthouse and get and geth. So he says here, this is an important milestone in Ethereum's roadmap, protecting proposers from targeted DOS or denial of service attacks that could kill liveness. Now, I have talked about single secret leader election before. It's basically the concept of being able to hide who the, I guess like block proposes are going to be ahead of time. Because right now, you know who 32 of the block proposers are going to be ahead of time. Now the. Yeah, the whole idea around it is to hide this so that you can prevent things like DOS attacks.
00:11:37.734 - 00:12:31.346, Speaker A: Because, for example, if you knew ahead of time that Coinbase was going to propose the next block, right, you could dos Coinbase as validators and essentially send them offline, which would obviously have a negative impact on the network. But then the reason why you would do that is so that you can actually be the block proposer. So, for example, if you, if at least this is how I believe it works, if the block proposal is missed, the next one will still go to the block proposal that was listed to begin with. So let's say that Coinbase is set to propose block number ten and your, your validator is set to propose block number eleven. And let's say that you are, you think you can gain some kind of like massive mev opportunity from that block. You essentially kill Coinbase's opportunity to propose that block and you take it for yourself. So it's more of the kind of like edge case attack vector, but it is definitely something that we want to address and that's all we're addressing with, with SSLE here.
00:12:31.346 - 00:13:01.394, Speaker A: And I believe SSLE is actually a requirement or a pre requirement to getting PBS into the network. So it's great to see that there's already a Devnet running here and there's actually a block explorer that you can go check out as well, which I'll link in the YouTube description below. But yeah, I didn't expect to see a devnet up this early for SSLE because realistically I think SSLE won't make it into the network till probably 2023. Five, maybe 2025 sounds. Sounds right to me. I definitely don't think it's gonna make it to the network next year. But yeah, 2025.
00:13:01.394 - 00:13:16.310, Speaker A: It just depends. It's. It's too hard to tell really, but yeah, I don't think it would happen next year. But regardless, the fact that we already have devnets for these things is really, really great to see. So you can go check this out for yourself. We'll link it in the YouTube description below. Alright.
00:13:16.310 - 00:14:07.628, Speaker A: Hill Toby put out a really interesting tweet over the weekend where he said this Ens or this Ethereum address. Jared from subway E has now spent 37,000 ETH or $70 million on gas, which is the most of any address on Ethereum. Now the reason why this is crazy is because you can see who the rest of the addresses are on this list. So you have number one being Jared from subway. And then the rest of them centralized exchanges, which is what you expect, right? Because obviously centralized exchanges are going to spend the most gas because they handle the. The user withdrawals, right? And they obviously move a lot of stuff around on chain for them, for themselves too. But the reason why this is crazy is because for those of you who don't know, Jared from Subway is an MEV bot, right? That, that's why they've got the name Jared from Subway, because it's referencing subway sandwiches, which is referencing sandwich attacks in the MEV context.
00:14:07.628 - 00:14:30.012, Speaker A: And there's a little bit of a meme going on there. But this account has spent of all of all gas ever spent on the network, if I'm reading this correctly, 0.46%, 0.46%, one address. It probably isn't one person, it's probably a team. But they have spent $70 million on gas. And the reason why have they have done that is because they want to extract meV.
00:14:30.012 - 00:14:57.528, Speaker A: And me. And the MEV profits were more than the $70 million they extracted. And I think Hill Dobby is actually working on a dashboard or working on a way to get the data to see how much profit that this Jared from subway account made from all. From spending all of these gas. So I'll keep an eye out for that for you guys. And then he also has another tweet here saying that over the past six months, Jared from subway spent 5% of all gas in the last six months, which is so much more than the next address. I mean, the next address is 2%.
00:14:57.528 - 00:15:15.720, Speaker A: It's not labeled here. So he spent 3% more than the next highest address. And you can see his transaction count as well, is just absolutely mind boggling. It's 1.2 million here for the last six months. But if you look at his transaction count in the context of against, like the other higher gas spenders, like centralized exchanges, he has 1.2 million.
00:15:15.720 - 00:15:48.206, Speaker A: But then the exchanges obviously have a lot more, right? Like Binance here has 7.7 million on one of their addresses, and they have on the other dresses, they have 7.6 million. But you expect that because they handle a lot of deposits and withdrawals every single day, and they've been around for quite a while now. So for here, for Jared from subway to have 1.2 million transactions in, I think this is like the last six months, to be honest, is absolutely insane. Right? Especially because those transactions, I believe pretty much all of them, or the vast majority of them, would be related to extracting meV.
00:15:48.206 - 00:16:29.158, Speaker A: And this, again, is why we are working to eliminate as much Mev as possible, because it's very toxic. All the money that, well, most of the money that Jared would have made, especially if he's doing sandwich attacks, is from basically wrecking people. And I wouldn't call it theft, but really just wrecking people who don't know any better to protect themselves from things like this. But, yeah, just a cool, interesting stat that I figured was worth highlighting for you guys. All right, so, speaking of PBS, before I came across this little basic animation from dmars, who shows you what it actually looks like. So what the, I guess, life of proposal builder separation looks like in this GIF here. So you can't really see it on my screen because it's a bit small, but you can see on the left hand side, searches.
00:16:29.158 - 00:17:09.030, Speaker A: And then they pass blocks to, sorry, transactions to builders, who then build the blocks, and then those builders will pass it to a relayer, which will then pass it to a validator. So the searches here, and the builders, a lot of the time, they can go hand in hand, right, where they're the same entity, and then the builder passing into validators. So the validators, entities like, obviously, rocker pool and lido and coinbase and individual validators. Sorry, not validators. Relay is first. So the relays I've talked about before, like ultrasound money and flashbots and all, and all those other relays there, and then those relays will then pass that on to the validators ultimately, and then the validators will propose the block. So this is the lifecycle of a block, really.
00:17:09.030 - 00:17:53.516, Speaker A: It goes from searcher to builder to relay to validator. Now the whole point of in protocol, PBS or EPBS is to eliminate the relayer role, basically, and to have it so that there's just like search a builder to validator, because the relay role is a centralizing vector, as we've seen, and it leads to censorship, as we've seen as well. And the whole kind of notion around it on top of that is that builders are going to always be centralized because it's a specialized role. But that's okay because as long as the validators are decentralized, that's all that matters. At the end of the day, that's all that matters for censorship, resistance, for security, for liveness and all that stuff. So it's okay for the builders to be centralized. Obviously, we would like there to be as many builders as possible.
00:17:53.516 - 00:18:33.064, Speaker A: But generally, you know, the future is probably just a handful of people, of builders building blocks. But we might get to a point like far into the future where we even like remove that as well. And I think Justin Drake has talked a lot about this in the past, where he talks about the, the, the Sci-Fi roadmap of Ethereum. And I think that this is something that bankers did a podcast on recently. But essentially it's these things that are like 10, 15, 20 years out that could lead to a dramatically improved Ethereum protocol and could make it so decentralized, sensory, persistent and unstoppable that you wouldn't have really any centralization vectors. It would just be maximally decentralized. Now, of course, there's still a lot of open questions around that.
00:18:33.064 - 00:19:03.674, Speaker A: As I said, it is potentially decades away. So while we wait for that to happen, or if it even materializes, if it even ever materializes, we work on these other upgrades in kind of like conjunction here. So yeah, anyway, you can go check out this GiF for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, so we have some news out of the block. So consensus owned infura. So you guys know what Infuria is, and you should know that consensus owns it by now, but they have announced plans to start decentralizing by the end of 2023.
00:19:03.674 - 00:19:49.354, Speaker A: So I did mention when this news first came out that infuria, like a little while ago, that inferior was planning to decentralize. Well, they're planning to do it by, or to start doing it by the end of 2023. Now what does this mean? Like, does it mean there's a token coming? Is it going to look like a dow? Well, they have said that it's going to look like a dow, and they're moving towards a Dow model, which in my mind kind of means that there's going to be a token. I don't know what that's going to look like. I don't know what the distribution is going to be or anything like that. But I am pleased to see that inferior is decentralizing because it has been one of those centralization vectors that people have rightly pointed to in the past where essentially if you're a metamask user and you haven't changed your default RPC on the Ethereum mainnet, on layer one, you are using inferior because metamask is also a consensus owned product. They obviously want people using, you know, all of their own products.
00:19:49.354 - 00:20:39.290, Speaker A: And the reason why it is, I guess, kind of a concern to use any centralized RPC, not just infuria, is because they have control over what over your access to the network. So essentially they can't do anything, they can't steal your funds or anything, but what they can do is censor you. So for example, if you send the transaction via infura and to tornado cash, and Infuria wanted to start enforcing censorship on that, your transaction wouldn't go through because you're using Infuria's infrastructure, using their full node, essentially, to relay your transaction to the network. You can easily get around this by running your own full node or just switching to a different RPC. It's not a hard thing to do. But I guess, like the whole point is that we want to make sure that we can decentralize this infrastructure as well so that we can have every part of the stack decentralized. So I'm really glad to see that infuria is going to start this journey by the end of 2023.
00:20:39.290 - 00:21:21.924, Speaker A: But I mean, to me it screams that a token is coming, but as I said, I don't know what that looks like, and I do wonder how they're going to do distributions on that, like if there's going to be an airdrop, anything like that, but something to keep an eye on for all of you keen airdrop farmers out there. All right, so espresso systems have shared their work integrating the op stack. So they said here op stack developers can start leveraging the decentralization speed and scale of the espresso shared sequencer network. This integration is part of their latest testnet released called Quotador. So I think I've covered Quotado before on the refuel. But this is, I believe the third testnet that they've released here, which enables the op stack developers to access this shared sequencer network. So you can go check this out for yourself.
00:21:21.924 - 00:22:13.918, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But I'm curious to see how these shared sequencer networks actually going to kind of develop here. Like is it going to be something that a lot of the roll ups opt into, a lot of the il two s opt into, or are they going to go down their own road of using their own sequencer networks or their own kind of like sequencer infrastructure? I'm sure we're going to see both shake out, but it's going to be really interesting to see which one wins in the end. Like in the end being like 510 years from now, right? Because at the end of the day, like sequencer decentralization isn't like a huge deal. And it is kind of like one of those things where it's a, I wouldn't say it's a nice to have, it's definitely a must have, but it's like not the top of the list of must haves, that's for sure. Because you want it for liveness, you want it for things like fair mev distribution on l two s, and you want it for censorship resistance. But in terms of decentralization, you don't strictly need it because l two s.
00:22:13.918 - 00:22:59.372, Speaker A: Specifically, roll ups are a one of n trust assumption where you only ever need one sequencer to be trustworthy to process your transaction in order for it to go through. So even if like there were 100 sequences and 99 of them were censoring you, you only need one. And that one can just process the transaction and then it gets batched and put onto l one, and that's fine. You don't need the majority of the network, like 66% of it, say, or 51% of it in order for your transaction to go through or anything like that. So it's a kind of one of n trust assumption there. And for liveness as well, you don't need that, say 99 of the sequences went offline and only one was online, that'd still be fine. You might see some degraded performance because maybe that sequencer is running on crappy infrastructure and it takes them longer to process things.
00:22:59.372 - 00:23:41.776, Speaker A: But generally that's why we set to one of n kind of a trust assumption here and one of n for liveness and things like that. But yeah, I'm curious to see what that actually ends up looking like. Are we going to get a shared sequencer network being the dominant thing or is it going to be like single sequences per chain or are people going to roll their own sequences? It depends. We'll have to see. We'll monitor that as time goes on. But I don't think we're going to have our answer there for at least five years on that front anyway. All right, so onto some market talk because I know the market has been extra shitty lately, which should not be a surprise to any of you, by the way, because I have been saying for months now that I expected the remainder of this year to just be sideways down only stuck in that kind of range.
00:23:41.776 - 00:24:16.654, Speaker A: Not, maybe not down only, but like stuck in that range that we've been stuck in for quite a while now. And the range being like one to two k, you know, 1500 to two k, that, that kind of, that kind of range there. So I've said that for a while, so it shouldn't surprise you. But, but I think what I want to talk about is something that I kind of came across recently and discovered recently, which further reinforces the four year cycle thesis. And I'm going to look at the chart in a sec to show you what I mean here. But I put out a tweet yesterday where I said the next few months will be where most people get shaken out. These brave souls sacrificed themselves to start a new bull so that a new bull market can finally begin.
00:24:16.654 - 00:24:43.910, Speaker A: And I truly believe this. I think that as I've been saying for months now, the next few months, just going to keep shaking people out. They're going to panic, sell, they're going to try and trade it. They're going to try and catch the bottom. They're like, haha, I'm not going to buy now. I'm going to buy when the bottom comes in. And then the problem is, is that like nine out of ten people are not going to do any of that, right? And they're going to wreck themselves and then they're going to, they're going to become fuel for the next bull market where essentially what happens is that eventually all those pumps that we see get sold down, we have seen got sold down all of this year.
00:24:43.910 - 00:25:10.214, Speaker A: They stop getting sold down and now the pumps actually continue and they keep going up. And then we start climbing that wall of warrior that I've discussed before. Then those people who missed buying lower and are waiting for lower to buy again start foaming fomoing in, in a real way, and then that becomes like that fuel for the. For the bull market. So that's definitely going to happen in my mind at some point. But this brings me to my kind of four year cycle thing that I've been talking to you guys about. So I've got the BTC chart up here.
00:25:10.214 - 00:25:32.236, Speaker A: So this is the BLX, which is a. An index that the brave new coin team have created that basically looks at the weekly closes of BTC going back to pretty much the start of BTC. This chart goes all the way back to, I believe. What date is this? It's like 2010 or something like that. Yeah. So it's July 2010. So it goes back to when BTC was like $0.05.
00:25:32.236 - 00:25:55.800, Speaker A: Right. But what I want to focus on is the previous two cycles and compare it to this current cycle. So you look at my. You'll see on my chart here, actually, if I bring it up here, so my camera is not. Not kind of blocking it. We look at the 2013 to, I guess, like 2017, or I guess, like we look from 2013 to 2017 here. When it comes to measuring from top to top.
00:25:55.800 - 00:26:25.006, Speaker A: Now, what I'm measuring here is the 2013 all time high, or the time, but between the 2013 all time high and when we broke that all time high in 2017, this is on BTC, that took 1127 days. Right. That is not four years, but that's. That's how long it took. And we'll get back to that in a sec. Then I measured bottom to bottom. So I measured the bottom from January 2015, when BTC bottomed in January 2015, to when BTC bottomed in December of 2018.
00:26:25.006 - 00:26:47.182, Speaker A: So from cycle to cycle here, that was 1428 days, which roughly translate to 3.91 years, which basically rounds up to four years. I mean, it's pretty much four years there. So that's the four year cycle. That's what we mean when we say that there is a four year cycle in crypto. It's measured from bottom to bottom. It is not measured from all time high to breaking the all time high.
00:26:47.182 - 00:27:08.194, Speaker A: So from previous all time high to breaking the new all time high. Right. It is from bottom to bottom. Now, the really curious thing about this is that I measured it again from the December 2018 bottom to the November 2022 bottom on BTC. And the days worked out to pretty much exactly the same. I don't know if I've measured it correctly here. I think that.
00:27:08.194 - 00:28:07.198, Speaker A: I think I have measured it correctly. But essentially, the days round out to 1428 days, which, again, is four years okay, we now have two data points saying that there's been a four year cycle both times right from bottom to bottom. And then I've gone and extrapolated that out on the current cycle. And as you can see here, if the four year cycle holds, October 2026 will be the next bottom. And then the, when I'm measuring from previous all time high to breaking the previous all time high, it again is very similar, 1127 days for the first cycle here. And that I'm measuring the second cycle, 1092 days. And then I've kind of extrapolated, extrapolated that out and said, okay, well, 1092 days into the future gets us to November 2024 as the, as breaking the previous all time high on BTC, which again, falls into what I've been saying about the second half or late second half of 2024 being when we probably see the new all time highs on, on BTC.
00:28:07.198 - 00:28:57.124, Speaker A: Now, I actually went further back and I haven't got, I haven't gotten on the chart here, but this bottom to bottom four year cycle actually exists from day one of bitcoin and day one, I mean, January of 2009. So if I measure it here, if I go from this bottom, which was the bottom in November 20 eleven, and I measure this to this bottom of January 2015, it is 1148 days. Right? So that is very similar to 1128. It's what, like 300 days difference or something like that. But the thing is, is that the cycles are very different here because, I mean, 2011, there was barely anywhere to trade BTC, but still the near four year cycle kind of holds here. It goes to what? Like three years or something like that. So, so three years.
00:28:57.124 - 00:29:42.500, Speaker A: But the thing is, you can take it from, from basically, from basically here as well, and go, go here and then it keeps going up. Right? So three to four years there. So the first one was, was three years. I mean, it's kind of hard to kind of, like, know here because these cycles weren't really, I guess, like, relevant to bitcoin at the time. Right. So that if you look at it like that from that perspective, you can say, okay, well, the four year cycle hadn't formed yet, but it was still kind of getting there, right? It was still like three years, which is still kind of long term here. Then you can take it from, like, I can't do it on the chart, but you can go from like January 3, 2009, which is on bit when bitcoin first launched, and go to the first, the first bottom here, which would be November 20 eleven, and you can extrapolate that out.
00:29:42.500 - 00:30:26.698, Speaker A: And from memory, it rounded up to, like, I think, very similar to what this bottom to this bottom rounded up to like 1100 days. So the first two cycles were extremely similar, and then the next two cycles were similar but stretched out by about, you know, 300 days because that's when the four year cycle meme really started. Right. But the whole point of me showing you guys this is not to say that it's guaranteed that the four year cycle is going to play out again. It's just to show you just how uncanny it is that it has played out so many times so far, and it has played out in very similar circumstances. And also to show you that BTC's return profile has actually come down over time. And that's only natural for an asset as it grows in market cap for it to come down over time.
00:30:26.698 - 00:30:44.706, Speaker A: And the reason why I'm focusing on BTC here is because ETH does not have enough data to look at. I mean, ETH launched for trading in July 2015, which was pretty much like, you know, what it would have been. July 2015 would have been around. Around here. Wait, sorry, I'm going back. Yeah. Which is like the middle of the crab market.
00:30:44.706 - 00:31:01.800, Speaker A: Right. It wasn't even the. It was, I mean, August 2015, BTC almost set a new low, right? So a new low for that cycle. So it was kind of, it's kind of irrelevant to look at ETH because you don't have enough data. That's why I'm looking at BTC. But it still follows those four year cycles because the whole market still follows BTC. Right.
00:31:01.800 - 00:31:39.642, Speaker A: So when you look at it from now, you take a holistic approach here and you, and you extrapolate it out, as I said, you would expect their new all time high to be November 2024, or around about that, and then the new low to be October 2026. That's the four year cycle there. Now, if this doesn't play out, that kind of breaks a lot of precedent, of course, but I am personally betting that it just plays out again. I haven't seen anything that happens this cycle that's different to last cycle. We had BTC and ETH go up to new all time highs. They came down. They came down, you know, 85%, I think, at their bottoms, actually, ETH went down more than BTC.
00:31:39.642 - 00:31:54.306, Speaker A: But BTC went down. It didn't even go down 80%. BTC from top to bottom went down around 77%. Right. So diminished to what it went down last time? I think it went down last. Last cycle, like 85% or something like that, but everything else went down 90 plus percent. Right.
00:31:54.306 - 00:32:36.048, Speaker A: And this year, we saw a kind of, I guess people were calling an echo bubble, where we kind of pumped up off the bottom by about two times on BTC and ETH. And then since the top there, we've just been bleeding out. The same happened in 2019 here, where you can see that in 2019, BTC went up a lot. It went up a lot more than two x, went up like three x. But I've explained before how, like, the plus token Ponzi influenced that, and then it went down and bled out and then started pumping again in 2020. And looking at the 2015 cycle is a bit different because it actually didn't really pump during the first half of 2015. Then it bottomed in August 2015 and actually pumped after that and didn't stop until the top of December 2017 here.
00:32:36.048 - 00:33:13.944, Speaker A: So, you know, the cycles don't exactly repeat, but they do rhyme. And all I'm interested in is looking at the general trends, the general trends of the crab market. And as I said before, the crab market only finishes when the crab market range is broken. And even back in 2015, crab market, or I guess, like the last that cycle, crab market, the crab wasn't broken until May 2016. Right. You can see here that that's when BTC went above, I guess, like 504 500, which is like, when it's crab range and didn't come back. And then you can see the same thing happened in 2019 where it broke out of its crab range.
00:33:13.944 - 00:33:58.242, Speaker A: But as I said before, that's like the plus token thing. But it didn't actually properly break out of it and continue on from that kind of crab range until, like, August 2020 or something like that, July 2020. So if we extrapolate that out again, we can say that. Okay, well, Q two, next year is when the crab will break, or q three next year is when the crab will break. So you can do the extrapolations. But as someone, I used to say, I used to watch a lot, I said a lot of times, this is just dubious speculation. This is just me kind of trying to, I guess, illustrate to you why I still believe in, like, the four year cycle, why I'm still a long term investor, why I still think that we're on track here, and why these day to day movements that we've been seeing lately, especially to the downside, are largely irrelevant.
00:33:58.242 - 00:34:25.389, Speaker A: Because if you look at what we started the beginning of the year at with, sorry, what, what each started, the sorry, what BTC started the beginning of 2020 at. To what it ended 2020. At. At the beginning of 2020, BTC started at 7.1k. By the end of 2020, BTC was at 25, no, sorry, 35k by the end of 2020. Right. So when you look at it like that, things can move very, very quickly.
00:34:25.389 - 00:34:47.285, Speaker A: I believe ETH was like 130 at the beginning of 2020 and went to like 900 or 800 by the end of it. So really, when things get going, they really get going. Things can change very, very quickly in a short period of time. So just because. And that was after a brutal crab year, by the way, right? That was after 2019 crab year. And that being like, very, very brutal, especially for ETH. And then it just moved.
00:34:47.285 - 00:35:06.856, Speaker A: And that was also after the whole COVID dump, too. So when you take that holistic approach, take that long term approach, you're gonna extrapolate this stuff out and see all the different points on the time here. But anyway, I'm gonna end that there because I've talked about the markets way longer than I intended to. But yeah. So thank you, everyone, for listening and watching.
