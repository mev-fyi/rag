00:00:00.240 - 00:00:27.974, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Today I've got another special episode for you with a guest, Hal Press from North Rock Digital. Now, all of you will know who Hal is. I think by now he's been very active within the ethereum ecosystem, especially over the last few months and especially around this merge trade that he's bet his fund on, basically. So I had a really great conversation with him about all things the merge, proof of work, forks, tokens, and everything in between goes for about an hour. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the conversation. Hey, Hal, how you going today?
00:00:28.554 - 00:00:30.570, Speaker B: All good. All good. Thanks for having me on.
00:00:30.722 - 00:01:10.772, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think this is going to be a really interesting conversation. We've been wanting to do this for a little while now, and what better, I guess, timing than three weeks, I think, before the merge here. So exciting times. You know, it's funny because I first came across you and your work through the Bankless podcast that you did, and I remember I shared it on twitter saying that I've been a mega ethball for a very long time, but you just, it just made me even more bullish, which I thought was impossible at that point. I was like, how can I be more bullish on ETH? And I think that's because you came at it from a completely different perspective to what we've seen in the past. Crypto tends to be very inside baseball. We don't really think outside the box in terms of outside of crypto.
00:01:10.772 - 00:01:39.536, Speaker A: We don't think in traditional finance terms. We reinvent things within crypto that have already existed in tradfi. And then we learn the lessons again, for some reason. It's just this whole thing, whereas you come from a traditional finance kind of like, standpoint and background there where. And that's why I think you got me so bullish on, on that bankless podcast you did, because you started talking about a concept that I hadn't really put together in my head, and that was the concept of structural flows. Right. And how that changes in crypto and how there hasn't really been a positive kind of like, structural flow for an asset, except maybe B and B.
00:01:39.536 - 00:01:55.304, Speaker A: I think I saw you argue there. I think that's what got, like, got me so excited. But, uh, you know, how is that just kind of like something that everyone looks at in traditional finance and that we were just missing within crypto? Like, it seems like we were just missing it for so long, and then you came and put the pieces together.
00:01:56.564 - 00:02:36.084, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a couple of things. You know, first of all, that's just kind of I, that's kind of my philosophy and process as an investor is to go very first principles on things. And I find myself, you know, I don't really read too many other people's works and kind of listen to too many of other people's views. I do, just to kind of get a sense of what's going on. But I try to kind of form all my own opinions from ground up first principles. And that's really how I came to those views and why I think, you know, sometimes I can come at things from different perspectives. But in regards to the structural flows, it's actually not really something that's discussed that much in traditional finance.
00:02:36.084 - 00:03:19.196, Speaker B: I think in traditional finance, it's something that people miss as well. And it goes back to this idea of what I wrote about this a little bit recently, but this idea of what I'd call time harvesting. Anything that has positive net income, it doesn't actually need to grow in order for the price to appreciate. All that needs to happen is for time to pass. And I think that's a very underappreciated concept, even in traditional finance. People forecast these companies all the time, and they're so worried about growth and the multiple expanding, and they don't sometimes realize that you actually don't even need either of those things for the stock price to go up. All you actually need is the time to pass, as long as they're accruing cash flows.
00:03:19.196 - 00:03:49.184, Speaker B: And I think that's why the equity market is such a consistent performer, is because it's very positive net income. And obviously, over time, time passes, and they accrue that earnings, and it goes to the holders. And that's what's going to happen with ethics after the merge is they will start to generate positive net income, and so time will flip from being a headwind to a tailwind. And that's really what I think is so powerful. And that's the foundation for the structural flows. The structural flows are able to exist because there is that positive net income, and it's used as a buy flow.
00:03:50.244 - 00:04:14.984, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense to me. And I think if we're talking about time, I think crypto is probably more attuned to that because of bitcoin harvestings. Right. This has been a popular narrative forever in crypto. It's like the bitcoin harvesting happens, and then sometime later, the price goes up because of that. Now, obviously, it's very hard to quantify that. Does the price just go up because we have more participants in the industry anyway, and it naturally just flows up over time.
00:04:14.984 - 00:04:46.412, Speaker A: It's hard to quantify that I found in the past. But I mean, it's the same kind of concept. You have less flow, you have less supply coming to market, you have the same demand, and if not more demand. And the price should naturally go up from there, at least over time. As you were saying, I think some people view this trade, or I guess the merge trade or, or what's happening with the merge is like an immediate thing where it's like as soon as the merge happens, the price is going to go astronomical. Like, I don't think that's going to happen at all. Like, as bullish as I am, I think it's definitely a function of time.
00:04:46.412 - 00:05:35.338, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's kind of a double whammy, I think, for ETH, because not only do we have this supply shock coming, because a supply shock in of itself or reducing supply doesn't really mean anything without the demand to match it. Like if the, if the supply is one and there's like no demand, then it's not worth anything, right. It's just, it's always worth as much as someone's willing to kind of pay for it. But I think the beautiful thing about ETH is not only do we have all that structural kind of sell pressure going to be evaporating, essentially, we also have the demand drivers. Like for me, I don't want to kind of like crap on bitcoin here, but for me, I always struggled with the, where's the demand for BTC going to come from? I know what narratives they have. They have like the sound money thing, they have the story value thing and all this other, you know, stuff that surrounds it. But personally, I never really bought into it because I'm more of a technologist and I was like, okay, while looking at Ethereum, the demand for ETH is huge.
00:05:35.338 - 00:06:12.458, Speaker A: I mean, ETH is used as defi collateral. It's going to be used in staking, it's used as a store of value, as a money within the NFT ecosystem and all the stuff, and obviously to pay gas fees. So for me it's like, yes, there's this supply shock coming, but we have the demand to match it. And the demand is a function of time too. We have these cycles, these kind of bull and bear cycles which dictate a lot of the demand for ETH as an asset. But I think with that supply shock, with the demand remaining the same and then growing over time as we all expected to do, its such a perfect cocktail of things coming together. And thats at least what makes me so bullish.
00:06:12.458 - 00:06:59.614, Speaker A: But I think, as I said, for me, you put the puzzle pieces together in a different way. I hadnt thought about, especially around that dynamic where as the price goes up, if the flows remain the same, then the USD denominated flows are going up and you need more USD denominated demands to match that. It doesn't matter if kind of like if the ETH denominated is the same, it gets astronomically worse as time goes up. But now we have like the reverse effect happening post merge where, I mean, for six to twelve months it drops to zero in USD denominated terms. And then the demand for ETH is also, I mean, we believe it's going to be there to match that as well. So that, that's what really kind of, when I was listening to that, I remember like, it just clicked in my head straight away.
00:07:00.194 - 00:07:48.508, Speaker B: Yeah, there's two things I'd say on that. Like one is, yeah, I totally agree with the, it's very important to think about it in USD DNam versus ETH dynam, where like the problem with the current proof of work situation is as prices go up, it creates this reflexive sell pressure that gets larger and larger and larger in USD terms, pushing prices down because the miners sell 10,000 tokens a day, whether it's $100 or $10,000. And so obviously at $100, that's like $100,000 or it's a million dollars, but then at like $5,000, it's $50 million. Right. So that sell pressure increases linearly with price. And the problem is that the buy pressure doesn't. Right, because we're all paid in dollars in everything that we do.
00:07:48.508 - 00:08:44.066, Speaker B: So when we have like dcas and buy programs, it's just that it's a dollar denominated by pressure and ETH denominated sell pressure. And so like, that's the core reason that I think crypto is so cyclical. Or one of the core reasons that it's so cyclical in the way that it is, is because the very structure of the asset class is that when it goes up, it actually creates its own downfall because it creates this recurring structural cell pressure that's much larger at that point and ends up pushing it back down. And then obviously when you push it back down, then that's true. Cell pressure alleviates and it allows it to create a new bottom, et cetera. And then to go to the other point about the demand, well, one other thing that I think is maybe a little bit nuanced and underappreciated about that. I'll try not to get too in the weeds and too sort of like nitty gritty, but, like, if you think about, and this is one of the things I think is so powerful about ETH, and this, like, this structural change that's going to occur is we've built seven years of behavior now, like, we've existed under this system for so long.
00:08:44.066 - 00:09:26.470, Speaker B: So even if nothing new happens to generate demand, we've basically sort of cultivated and ingrained this behavior in this set of buyers such that they buy ETH every day. Right. And ETH has come down to a price where that's the case because they must buy ETH every day because the miners are selling it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be at an equilibrium. Basically, if we weren't at a price where there were buyers of those 10,000 tokens a day, it would go lower and lower and lower and lower until it found a price where there were buyers at the 10,000 tokens a day. And so we found this equilibrium over that time. And by doing such, we've created this base of buyers that does buy ETH every day.
00:09:26.470 - 00:09:56.976, Speaker B: And there's a lot of people that just dci ETH, just a portion of their paycheck goes into ETH every day, regardless of what's going on. And that's because it's needed to, because they couldn't find an equilibrium otherwise because of the miners. Once you strip the miners away, those buyers are still going to be there. They're still going to be buying because nothing's changed for them. But the person that's been selling them the tokens every day is going to be gone. So I actually disagree a little bit that you don't actually even need new demand. Your point was the supply reduction is one thing, but you need new demand or doesn't mean anything.
00:09:56.976 - 00:10:18.004, Speaker B: I think the demand has already existed. We've cultivated that behavior over seven years such that the demand must exist, or else we wouldn't be at an equilibrium, simply removing the supply. The supply should actually be enough to create the price movement on its own without the demand. I obviously agree that there should be other new sort of demand drivers, but you shouldn't actually even need it because we found an equilibrium under current situation.
00:10:19.224 - 00:10:39.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree with that. I think. I don't think we need net new demand at all. I think if we stay at the current levels, then, yeah, I mean, logically, the price should trend up, considering that we're getting rid of so much supply. So, yeah, definitely, definitely agree with that, that framing. And I think that's what a lot of people miss. A lot of people don't think in those terms where they.
00:10:39.730 - 00:10:54.546, Speaker A: And I guess, like, it's very kind of a crypto thing not to think in those terms, because there's a lot of tribalism, I think, that attributes to this. And people say, oh, no, no one's buying ETH. They only buy it in bull markets. It's like, well, if no one was buying ETH, then the ETH price would be so much lower than it is.
00:10:54.610 - 00:10:54.882, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:54.938 - 00:11:12.500, Speaker A: And the popular narrative of ETH bleeding against bitcoin has obviously been incorrect in a bear market has obviously been incorrect at this point. Uh, so I think that there is a lot of bad information put out there, and people just don't make these connections, that there is actually natural ETH buyers that buy all the time. I mean, I am one of them. Like, I buy ETH whenever I can. Right.
00:11:12.612 - 00:11:17.548, Speaker B: So, like, you're actually the example that I referenced in my first thesis.
00:11:17.676 - 00:11:31.572, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I remember reading that. I was like, oh, that's. That's fun. Um, but, you know, obviously, just looking at me is. Is funny because, like, I am one of the biggest ETH balls, but it's not just me. Like, there are a lot of quiet people out there who are just buying Eric.
00:11:31.588 - 00:11:40.102, Speaker B: I know a lot of those people that just say, like, 2% of my paycheck, every paycheck, is just going to eat for the rest of my life, and that's just how I do it.
00:11:40.238 - 00:12:11.310, Speaker A: Yep. Yep, exactly. So I definitely think that not many people have really thought about that seven year base that you're talking about that has built up over time. And it's kind of, when you think about the move from proof of work to proof of stake, it really is a regime change. Right? Like a very positive regime change. I mean, positive to us. Obviously, there are people who believe that it's not a positive, but I think the ethereum ecosystem at large believes it's a very, very big positive, and it's a regime change that should lead to, I guess, like that feedback loop, right? It's not just the supplier reduction, but it's the move to proof of stake.
00:12:11.310 - 00:12:52.734, Speaker A: It's the energy narratives, the bad energy narratives going away for Ethereum, and we're not having to worry about it anymore. It's the fact that you can basically own a yield on staking your ETH, not only on the block rewards, but now the fee revenue, so you can have a share in the network. It's all this sort of stuff coming together. I think that if, unless you're deep in the weeds, it's kind of hard to make those connections. And I understand that. That's why I always say that I don't think the merge is priced in because, I mean, if people within the ecosystem, if people like me, who has been bullish for so long, is still learning new ways to be bullish, then I think it just points to the fact that the merge can't be priced in, at least in my mind. But actually, I'm curious for your thoughts around the price in terminology.
00:12:52.734 - 00:12:58.688, Speaker A: Do you think people get that wrong a lot of the time? Do you think people don't have the right definition of what priced in means?
00:12:58.776 - 00:13:43.784, Speaker B: It's a really, it's a really tricky and deep question. I would say, like, it's not binary, right? Like, it's not. It is priced in or isn't priced in. It's kind of like how priced in is it? It's not black and white. And I think also, I mean, I made this point in my article, and it depends on your timeframe, too, right? It really depends on your timeframe. Like long term, I think that it's impossible for it to be priced in because to price it in, if you just think about the flows, what would need to happen is approximately 10,000 ETH is 10,000 fury is going to be sold every day post merge. So that's right now equates to about $15 million.
00:13:43.784 - 00:14:15.864, Speaker B: So what would need to happen is for the last seven years, someone would have needed to be buying $15 million a beat every single day for seven years. And then for the next seven years after the merge, they would have to be planning to sell that $15 million every day. That's how you would price it in. And so obviously, like, no one's been doing, and even if someone did do that, that would only price it in for seven years. After the seven years, it would no longer be priced in anymore. So depending on if your time horizon is long enough, by definition, it can't be priced in. And then also, obviously, nobody's doing that.
00:14:15.864 - 00:15:10.116, Speaker B: So it's not priced in over the long term. But when you think about the short term and the medium term, it becomes much more of a legitimate question. Because if there's a billion dollars, or let's say, let's just make the numbers really high to make the argument, if there's $20 billion that bought ETH for the merge that plans to sell after the merge. It's going to take a very long time for that supply to chew through the 20 billion, assuming there's zero buyers after the merge is successful. Now, I don't think that's the case, but you can certainly, it's not impossible for it to be priced in in the short term. And so the way that I, my personal view is that it is still not priced in even on the short term, but I think it is more priced in than it was six weeks ago. Like when, when we were at the lows in June, and I would tell people like, you know, the merge is coming in September, they would be like, oh, no, it's not.
00:15:10.116 - 00:15:37.292, Speaker B: It gets pushed every time. Like, maybe it'll happen in 2023, like early 2023. And right now, like today we got the main net merge announcement, right? So, like, that's clearly, the perception has clearly changed and people's positions have clearly changed with it. There's a lot of people talking about the merge now. Six weeks ago, no one was really talking about it. Everyone was just like in shell shock about how bad the contagion of the luna and three ac blow up was. So I think we're certainly more priced in than that.
00:15:37.292 - 00:16:14.166, Speaker B: And if you look like the best way to at understand, like, has there been anything priced in is to just look at traditional relationships, right? Like ETH is up still even after this latest correction, like 80% off the low bitcoins up like zero. Solana's up like zero. Avalanche is up like 20%. Like cosmos is up like 50% or something. Like all the high beta alt l one s that usually have a pretty strong, like, just traditional beta relationship to ETH. So when ETH goes up, they go up more. When ETH goes down, they go down more.
00:16:14.166 - 00:16:40.546, Speaker B: They're all up less than ETH from the lows. Which tells you, like, this is a pretty, and it's not like one of them. Like, you could look at a basket of ten of them. They're all pretty much up less than ETH. And obviously bitcoin is like not moved at all. So this move off the lows has really been a very east led move, which tells you that the market is pricing something in for the merge. So it's indisputable that something is priced in now, which by definition means it's more pricing than before.
00:16:40.546 - 00:17:11.864, Speaker B: However, with that said, I still think there's a lot of people fighting the move, and I don't think all the people that are going to buy ETH for the merge have bought ETH for the merge yet. And then obviously I think there's a whole contingent of people that are kind of skeptical that it will occur successfully and will buy ethnic the day it occurs successfully, when they see that it's actually happened and they didn't want to take the execution risk. So I don't think it's priced in in the short term, per se, but I definitely think, like, it's kind of hard to argue that it's not more priced in than it was.
00:17:12.884 - 00:17:25.956, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good way of thinking about it. Timeframes are the most important thing, I think, when it comes to, like, debating that, that that is it priced in or not? Because whenever I say I don't think it's priced in, well, I'm, I'm operating on very long timeframes here.
00:17:25.980 - 00:17:30.464, Speaker B: Like, I'm not, it's not priced in over the next ten. Like, it's impossible.
00:17:30.804 - 00:17:49.436, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. And I think it's funny because when you think about the price thin stuff around people actually believing the merge is going to happen or not, I can actually forgive people for believing it's not going to happen. Maybe not now, but over the last few months because I don't think you were around in 2017, but no, but I hear you.
00:17:49.460 - 00:17:52.580, Speaker B: It's been pushed so many times. It's been six months away for four years.
00:17:52.692 - 00:18:21.612, Speaker A: Yes. The whole ecosystem was convinced that proof of stake was coming in 2017 like you had. I think even Vitalik saying as much. So I can forgive people for that. But at the same time, as you've said plenty of times, if you pay attention to the core dev calls and the consensus layer calls and pay attention to the testnets, you knew it was coming and you knew that the actual roadmap quite a while ago now actually to get to mainnet. But yeah, there's still a lot of people who are skeptical. There's still a lot of people who get fed the wrong information depending on who they follow.
00:18:21.612 - 00:18:46.740, Speaker A: And then they think that information is the truth and they're like, oh, it's not going to happen. They're just lying. It's all, that's all a marketing stunt. And then when it actually happens and you can no longer deny reality, you look at it and then you're like, oh, crap, like, do I buy? Should I buy? And you kind of get those FOMo people kind of coming in. But how much that counts for is another thing because, like short to medium term, it's very hard. So I don't know how much you think that accounts for.
00:18:46.932 - 00:19:20.008, Speaker B: I mean, there's another thing, too, which is like, you know, it is actually a big task and a big undertaking, and it is not without risk. I think that there could be some issues with the merge. I don't think that there will be. I don't think it's the highest probability scenario, but I think it's non zero, and I think that. So there should be some risk premium priced in. And also, I think it will be, like, a pretty big deal if and when they pull it off successfully. I think it should give people confidence in the dev team.
00:19:20.008 - 00:20:05.964, Speaker B: Like, I think it should be a fundamental catalyst in addition to everything else. So I think it should matter. You should have more than just like the FOMO people. I think there should be, you know, reasonable people that buy it that. That day when they see everything happening successfully, it should be a vote of confidence. So, I mean, we'll see. But I do think that it's a fairly significant event, and I think also this is one of the ways that it differs from a bitcoin having is that bitcoin having is a flow event now, albeit it goes from structural supply to less structural supply, but still structural supply, whereas ETH goes from very severe structural supply to actual structural demand.
00:20:05.964 - 00:20:39.834, Speaker B: So it's certainly even bigger on the flow perspective. But a bitcoin having event is actually a negative fundamental event. Like bitcoin security actually reduces the moment that having occurs. So it's like a negative fundamental event about a positive flows event. And because, as I say, a lot of the time, and it's not rocket science, crypto prices move on flows, not fundamentals. So bitcoin tends to go up even though the fundamentals have gone down, because flow ends up ruling the day. But for ETH, it's a flows catalyst, but it's also a fundamental positive catalyst.
00:20:39.834 - 00:21:00.794, Speaker B: Right. Like the network actually becomes more secure the day the merge occurs, and the network becomes greener the day the merge secures and people become more confident in its security that the merge occurs. Right. So you have all these fundamental positives in addition to the flow positives. So it's kind of a bigger deal in that sense than a having.
00:21:01.734 - 00:21:20.542, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think that's, again, a different way to look at things that people don't traditionally look at because they always think, you know, bitcoin hardenings are bullish because the supply harbors, but they don't look at the network security, security going with that, because they assume that the price is just going to go up to match that, the price just going to double, and then we back to the same securities. And I think that I even have.
00:21:20.558 - 00:21:32.310, Speaker B: A problem with that, which is that a network that's twice as big needs twice as much security. So yes, you can get to the same USD denom security, but it's not actually as secure because relative to market cap, you haven't actually changed anything.
00:21:32.462 - 00:21:51.504, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I think that's very, very important and something that people don't think about very often, but in that kind of sense of negative catalyst or negative kind of fundamentals, like, because this is topical right now, do you think the OFAC stuff has overshadowed the merge trade at all, or do you think it's like, inconsequential?
00:21:52.924 - 00:22:33.366, Speaker B: I certainly think it's been relevant. I don't think it's inconsequential. I think it has caused some legitimate concerns. It hasn't concerned me particularly much because, well, first of all, I mean, there's a few reasons, but like, to answer the first question bluntly. Yes, I do think it's been a conservative. I think it's overshadowed the merge, not entirely, but I think it's been a negative on people's minds marginally. And then the reason that I think it doesn't concern me too much is, well, first of all, there's absolutely zero indication that anyone is going to try to censor anything in any immediate time frame.
00:22:33.366 - 00:23:03.138, Speaker B: And I don't think it would be very intelligent for the US government to try to do any sort of censorship via stakers. So I think it's a very low probability event. But even if they were to do it, there's actually plenty of defense mechanisms. Like you've already had the largest staking operator come out and say that they would first shut down their staking operation before complying with that. Right. So that's one thing. And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around social slashing, which is another option.
00:23:03.138 - 00:23:50.354, Speaker B: And I think ultimately what will happen is if any of these threats are credible, like the staking organizations will just move overseas. Like, it's no different than these same vectors of attack are there with proof of work. It's just that the miners aren't all us based, but there's no reason that the stakers can't move over overseas. And I think they would, and I think for that very reason, because, like, any rational, logical person can see that that will be the course of effect if they try to go down this path. This path will never be gone down because the government, like, maybe people don't like that, but they're not actually that stupid. So they wouldn't do something like this because they know that it's not actually going to accomplish the desired effect. And all it's going to do is just push these organizations offshore, which they don't want.
00:23:51.494 - 00:24:27.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's an important point because the government, the OFAC sanctions is all about controlling, I guess, like, the flows of money or controlling what North Korea has access to. I think that was the main purpose of it, tonocash. But then you kind of expand that out and say, well, okay, what if the US government ordered stakers to censor certain things? It's like, okay, well, where does that stop? Right? Does it stop a tornado cash, or does it keep going? And then what's the limit here? You have to have community buy in on a chain. You have to have people buying in onto a chain. Like, no one's going to buy into OFAC chain if that happens. Right. They're going to, like, it doesn't matter about the value of a coin.
00:24:27.594 - 00:24:46.506, Speaker A: People are going to, the community is going to come together and say, no, we're going to reject this OFAC chain even though there are these powerful centralized entities in support of it. Like, we're just, we're going to reject it. We're going to social slash them. We're going to go and do our own thing. None of the core devs are going to work on OFAC chain. Right. And like, none of the, most of the app developers are not going to work on OFAC chain.
00:24:46.506 - 00:24:56.274, Speaker A: So, so where. So I think that's the balancing act, as you were kind of alluding to where the US government can do certain things, but if they go too far, then they lose power to do anything, and that's not what they want.
00:24:56.314 - 00:25:20.776, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. And I think that, I think there's enough people advising the government that they would tell them that that's not a very good idea, don't do that. And I don't think that they will do that. But it's certainly an interesting thing. And I think in crypto it's not good enough to say, oh, it's unlikely to happen, so we don't have to worry about it. You should be prepared for all edge cases, regardless of whether I think it's likely or not.
00:25:20.776 - 00:25:30.854, Speaker B: And so I think it's good that we are preparing for this potential scenario. But just as an investor myself, I don't attribute a very high probability to it. So it doesn't cause me to lose too much sleep.
00:25:31.474 - 00:25:39.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so as well. I mean, I think it definitely, on the narrative front, overshadowed the merge a little bit. But on the fundamental side, it overshadows.
00:25:39.858 - 00:25:56.754, Speaker B: It for like four days. Right. No one's talking about ofac fork anymore, right. There's always like a fud thing that comes up. Like I'm sure that, I promise you between now and September 15, there will be at least two more of these things that come up. Like there just will be like, I don't know what they'll be like, but there'll be something.
00:25:57.694 - 00:25:58.350, Speaker A: That's the thing.
00:25:58.382 - 00:26:06.646, Speaker B: And there's always, and they'll last for four days. And all the people that want to see ETH lower will publicize them and then it'll get fatigue and they'll move on to the next one. That's it.
00:26:06.670 - 00:26:34.794, Speaker A: And there's always something. That's the shifting narratives, the shifting goal posts, especially when something goes successful. Like, I mean, I've noticed that with the bitcoin maximalist who for very long time said that Ethereum would never move to proof of stake, and then it's undeniable that we are going to move to proof of stake. Well, now they've shifted the goal post, right? They've shifted something else. Like, so the haters are always going to find something to hate Ethereum about. It's just more filtering through that noise and realizing what's an actual fundamental concern and what is just news of the day, as you said.
00:26:35.454 - 00:27:31.392, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's fair. And I think also, you know, just in the interest of like, being fully fair and transparent and depicting both sides, like, I think there are certain things that have changed since my initial thesis that have gotten more bearish too in regards to the merge catalyst. Certainly when I wrote the initial piece, we were doing $40 million a day of USD DNAM fees and thats demand that has to be absorbed every day. And obviously now those numbers have come way down. So I still think that the merge is a very bullish catalyst because of the supply reduction. But I think its probably not quite as bullish as if we had been doing the same fee levels as we were six months ago today. So I think theres goal post moving on the bear case side, but I think we also do have to be honest about the facts that change on the bullish side of things as well.
00:27:31.392 - 00:28:01.620, Speaker B: And I think the reality is, yes, activity is lower now and that is negative. The price is also a lot lower. And I think a lot of thats priced in, and I think the supply reduction is plenty enough of a catalyst and a regime shift to change things anyway. But I don't think that you can ignore those things either. Yeah, like, I updated my staking yield. I was projecting a 10% staking yield originally. Then that's just not going to be the staking yield now.
00:28:01.620 - 00:28:03.784, Speaker B: Like post merge. I think it's going to be five.
00:28:04.204 - 00:28:16.654, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I think so. I think it's funny because the high phase lasted for so long. I think some people fell into this false sense of security that we'd never go back down to single digit way. I think I sometimes fell into that.
00:28:16.954 - 00:28:20.250, Speaker B: But at the same time, you go ahead first.
00:28:20.362 - 00:28:26.894, Speaker A: I was just going to say I think it's reflexive. I think as soon as the bull market starts coming back, the gas prices are just going to go up again.
00:28:27.514 - 00:28:50.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's an interesting question. I don't know the answer. You might know better than me. I mean, I think certainly there's been a lot of discussion about, okay, ETH will be deflationary. Well, actually, ETH won't be deflationary. If the merge happens right now, it'll be roughly flat supply, which is still extremely good, but it probably won't be deflationary. So that's one thing that people should just understand in terms of expectations.
00:28:50.664 - 00:29:23.636, Speaker B: And then regarding the fees, I do tend to agree there should be that reflexive force. I think the problem is this rally has been so eccentric and not broad based. It hasn't actually occurred at the same time as, like, an activity pickup. There really hasn't been that pickup. Right. Like, price is up 80% and ethanol fees haven't moved. So it's an interesting dynamic.
00:29:23.636 - 00:29:33.424, Speaker B: I mean, hopefully it's just with a lag and things will pick up as we get towards the merge and around the merge. But, like, just, again, in the interest of being intellectually honest, we haven't seen it yet.
00:29:34.184 - 00:30:13.240, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that's a consequence of just, like, just buying and selling Ethan just ETH going up. It's not going to add that much fear revenue to the base layer, because a lot of the fear revenue comes from, you know, the actual activity on defi, for example, especially around trading different tokens. And if you're so bullish on ETH and there's such a catalyst around it, then there's not really that much of a reason to go into different tokens. It's like you buy ETH sort of thing, but in saying that, you have been very vocal about certain tokens that you think have a higher beta to ETH that I'd love to touch on. Um, I personally, uh, just for disclosure here, I own a bit of RPL and LDR, which is two of the tokens that you've spoken about. But I mean, I don't own them in any, you know, sizable quantity.
00:30:13.240 - 00:30:24.844, Speaker A: I just buy ETH. Uh, but you know, when it comes to these other tokens, are you playing them off the merge trade alone, or do you think some of them actually have, you know, the properties to outperform ETH over the long term?
00:30:26.024 - 00:31:11.054, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting question. Um, I'd say primarily it's around the merge event and the merge regime shift. I think that's not because I don't believe in them long term. It has more to do with my kind of investment philosophy. My investment philosophy is, your goal as an investor is to do nothing 90% of the time and pass on all sort of medium and low conviction ideas. And then when the high conviction ones come around, really take advantage of them and only really express risk around those periods of sort of max conviction and Max Alpha. And I think that that period is around the merge, especially for the liquid staking derivative tokens.
00:31:11.054 - 00:31:53.194, Speaker B: And so it's. So for me, it's more about maximizing that period of max conviction, and then after that, finding the next thing that I have Max conviction on. Because I might think that these are good tokens that will outfrom ETH over the long term, but it's a very marginal view after the merge, for me, it's less investable under my framework. I'd say that's probably why I look at it more as a trade. But I do think that there will be big long term businesses built here, so thats not to diminish their long term potential.
00:31:54.294 - 00:32:32.176, Speaker A: I think we have very similar investment strategies and investment kind of like thesis when it comes to these things. I understand the bull case for some of them. I know that particularly rocket pool has been very, very vocal. Their community, I should say, not the rocket pool cord, as the community has been very vocal about their bull case for RPL. And I actually agree with it. But when you, depending on your timeframe, it becomes very hard to outperform ETH just based on the prior kind of like history and the prior data. Not to say it can't, but it's kind of like, if you're trying to say you're buying a liquid staking token, it can be RPL or something else.
00:32:32.176 - 00:32:42.084, Speaker A: For five years and you're buying ETH for five years. It's pretty much impossible to have any certainty around that token. Outperforming ETH, it's extremely hard.
00:32:42.444 - 00:32:54.700, Speaker B: I agree. And it's sort of marginal. And that's why for me it falls in that medium to low conviction bucket, which is like, you know, those, those things might work and they may be positive ev, but it's just not within my framework as an investor. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:32:54.732 - 00:33:13.700, Speaker A: And my framework is outperforming ETH. Maybe other people's isn't. Maybe they're happy just outperforming USD and they want to support the community. They want to have a stake in the community. Because obviously when you buy a token, even subconsciously, your, you know, stake in that community goes up. Right. You pay more attention to it, you're more invested in it, literally and non literally.
00:33:13.700 - 00:33:42.714, Speaker A: Uh, so I think if people doing it for that, that's, that's, that that's fine as well. But for me personally, I just want to, you know, stack ETH, right. I don't want to give up, right. The give up ETH for something else. But I understand people who do that and maybe they are doing it as a short to medium term thing as well. Like not everything has to be a long term investment. Uh, you know, the huddle culture of crypto has kind of poisoned the well a bit where it's like everything needs to be a long term thing when, no, you can do short to medium term, Betsy, but you have your long term stack as well.
00:33:42.714 - 00:33:51.454, Speaker A: I mean, people, I mean, obviously you and as an investor would do this where you kind of have percentages of your portfolio in different things based on different timeframes. Right.
00:33:51.834 - 00:34:09.356, Speaker B: And I, yeah, for sure. And I try to be kind of very open and upfront about all these things so as to avoid like misconceptions. Like I say this all the time, right? Like I am a self self proclaimed profit maximalist. Like, I will never say otherwise. Like, it just is what it is. I'm an investor. That's my job.
00:34:09.356 - 00:34:53.383, Speaker B: My job is to maximize dollars, not like be married to any ethos. So like, you know, that doesn't mean that I don't care about these things. It's just, it just shouldn't be my priority because that wouldn't be honestly fair to my investors whose money I manage. Right? So, like I try to be very open and upfront about these things and as a result, like that, like I said before, like it's just theres a million different things you can look at, but im always trying to find the few things that Im highest conviction on. And so I end up, I think this is just generally true in crypto and its kind of interesting. Theres a million different pumps you can chase. Theres 10,000 opportunities at all times.
00:34:53.383 - 00:35:40.364, Speaker B: Ill have people pitch me ideas and ill be like, thats a good idea. I think itll work, but I'm not going to participate in it because I just don't have the time. And I know that if I try to do that, I will just be spread too thin such that it will take away from everything else I'm trying to do. I think that's important in crypto is managing that bandwidth where it's like if you try to chase every pump, you will end up catching no pumps. But if you just focus on a very few high conviction things and you do the diligence and you build the conviction in them, you have a much better chance of capturing them and monetizing them appropriately. And I think in crypto, like, it's so volatile, this actually takes on an added importance because it's very easy to get shaken out of positions if you haven't done. And I've learned this right.
00:35:40.364 - 00:36:25.544, Speaker B: And this is another thing I say all the time. Like, the best lessons you learn in an investing period are from losing money. And, like, when I got started in crypto, like, I made this mistake a few times, which is like, you try to chase things without doing, like, full diligence and having full conviction in the idea. And inevitably, what will happen is crypto is volatile, and as soon as that thing underperforms, like 5% and it has some big seller, you lose your conviction. You start to doubt yourself, and you panic, and that's going to happen in anything that you own. Like, there's always going to be that volatility. And so if you haven't gone through the process of kind of building the conviction to hold through those periods where things don't look as good as you think they should look, you are destined to fail because those periods will come.
00:36:25.544 - 00:36:47.192, Speaker B: And so I think it's very important in that context in crypto to really, like, understand that you don't have to chase everything and the things that you do chase. You should really have built a strong view in just that you're not very fickle and fragile in your holdings, and you will hold through your thesis unless the facts change.
00:36:47.388 - 00:37:12.200, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it speaks to what I always say. And I always tell people it's like, you need at least two cycles to understand crypto because the conviction point is very true. Like, you can have so much conviction on an asset and think it's the most bullish thing in the world, but it can still go down 80, 90%. I mean, ETH literally went down, like 85% from its all time high with all of those fundamentals, with that high fee revenue with the merge coming.
00:37:12.200 - 00:37:28.924, Speaker A: So it doesn't matter, you know, how much conviction you have on something in crypto, and it even doesn't matter how bullish it is. It's, it's, it's so volatile. Like, it's still extremely volatile because there will be volatility. Yes. There's, there's no trading halts, right? There's, there's. It's very unregulated still. There's so much leverage in the system.
00:37:28.924 - 00:37:51.662, Speaker A: There's. I mean, we saw it go down because of all that contagion. Like, people thought, oh, no, we're never going to have, like, a big crash again, because there's not that contagion. Like, what are you talking about? Like, terror blew up, then 3 hours capital blow up, then this blew up, and this blew up, and all these people are, like, insolvent now. And then you had these four sellers, which just pushed the price down even more. So I think people in crypto, you have to be in a couple of cycles to realize that it's always the same kind of thing. Like, too much leverage.
00:37:51.662 - 00:38:27.486, Speaker A: And doesn't matter how bullish you get on something, it can go way higher than you think it can, but can also go way lower than you think it can in a span of a few months. So I definitely agree with that. And I also think that on the, like, the positioning thing, where you try to chase, like, ten different things and you end up losing on all of them, it's an attention thing. At the end of the day, like, we're humans. We don't have the ability to pay attention to ten different things individually. We have to have a team for that. That's why the big investors and big gun investment firms, they have hundreds, thousands of people looking at this sort of stuff to just inch out that extra alpha and to beat, like, indexes.
00:38:27.590 - 00:39:12.566, Speaker B: And I actually think, like, even at the investor level, though, that's a common mistake. Like, I, like, anytime I speak to a hedge fund like crypto or equity fund, that's like, you know, we hold 50 longs and 40 shorts and we have a diversified book, I'm just like, good luck. Yeah, like, like, it's just, I just don't have a lot of faith that strategies like that can actually generate alpha, especially after all the execution cost and the slippers that you incur. Like, I'm much more of the opinion that you want to have a very concentrated book. You need to learn how to risk manage with concentration, because that's the obvious, like, kind of sacrifice that you have. And so we will never, ever be greater than 100%, net long or net short. I don't think.
00:39:12.566 - 00:39:23.754, Speaker B: That's just not something that we would do. But I do think that having those concentrated positions opens up a lot more potential for alpha generation long term.
00:39:24.054 - 00:39:38.422, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. And I mean, the leverage thing, it's literally the position killer. Doesn't matter how small or big you are. Like, it's the same thing. I mean, it's actually just still crazy to me that three AC took on so much leverage and just blew themselves up.
00:39:38.478 - 00:39:40.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, they were like even.
00:39:40.702 - 00:40:22.504, Speaker A: The worst, kind of like one of the, probably one of the worst, like, altcoin investors and lost like 90% of their money. They still did better than three AC because they didn't lose 100%. But, um, I think that's, that's something that gets a lot of new, new people off guard, too, because they come in with not very much money and they're like, well, how do I maximize my returns here? Oh, you know, the exchanges, like, here's leverage, you know, like binance especially, which is obviously very popular in FTX, they're like, here's leverage. And, you know, there's no real risk disclaimers around that. There's no, like, uh, you know, this can, this is a high chance you're going to blow up. It's like, here's a way to make outsized returns and, and obviously outsized losses. But I think a lot of new people are attracted to that and they get wrecked.
00:40:22.504 - 00:40:35.764, Speaker A: And that's why, again, I go back to, you need to experience a couple of these cycles. You need to be in the weed, you need to be paying attention to actually get the wisdom to be a better investor. And I think that's true for all investing, not just in crypto, right?
00:40:36.344 - 00:40:39.592, Speaker B: Hopefully only one cycle. Otherwise I'm going to have to get burned by another one.
00:40:39.688 - 00:40:43.072, Speaker A: Well, you have prior experience, right? From other markets?
00:40:43.208 - 00:41:02.202, Speaker B: In other markets, yeah. But I certainly learned a lot this, like, past six months. Like, I think, you know, when I launched the fund, it was December 1. It's funny, actually. You know, we launched the fund basically at the Picotop, and we had a pretty. We had a pretty large. We had a pretty large ETH allocation, like, very large.
00:41:02.202 - 00:41:13.180, Speaker B: We launched the fund at 4650. So there was a lot of. There was a lot of lessons learned. We've done. Okay. But. But there was a lot of lessons learned.
00:41:13.180 - 00:41:53.184, Speaker B: And then I think one other thing in this context, I don't know if you want to talk about it, but there's another potential set of tokens that I think is interesting through the merge that I haven't talked about as much, which is all of basically the arbitrum ecosystem tokens. I think the timing of the Arbitrum odyssey aligns particularly well with the merge, and it's kind of one of those stars align situations that makes for another pretty interesting way to kind of try to outperform eat. So I don't know if you want to talk about that one, but that's another one that we could discuss.
00:41:53.764 - 00:42:13.688, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, definitely. And there's also the proof of work kind of forks and the tokens around that as well that we could talk about. We can talk about the arbitrum thing first, or I guess, like, just the timing there. I mean, personally, I avoid talking about app layer tokens because they're just so hard to invest in. Like, it's just so.
00:42:13.736 - 00:42:15.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we don't even have to name names.
00:42:15.784 - 00:42:21.364, Speaker A: Yeah. They'd be interested in your. In your. In your thinking around it, for sure. I think the listeners would as well.
00:42:21.704 - 00:43:00.164, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, like I said, we don't even have to name names about, like, specific tokens, but I think. Well, first of all, I think we are based. We're pretty firmly entering l two season like optimism and arbitram are gaining real traction to the point where they're actually getting more activity than some all bell one s. Like, they. The l two thesis is actually playing out, and they are actually cool, interesting things going on on l two chains. So that's kind of like a backdrop, but with arbitrage specifically, there is this.
00:43:00.164 - 00:43:52.790, Speaker B: I don't know what you want to call it, this thing called the Odyssey, which is going to restart after nitro launches on August 31. They haven't given an exact date, but the assumption is that it will start very shortly after nitro restarts on the 31st. Call it sometime in the first or second week of September, which is exactly in the lead up to the merge on September 15. And the. My assumption, and I'll just talk about this from my assumption, so we can just, like, none of this is factual. These are just my assumptions, is that the Odyssey will restart then. And the way that the Odyssey works is basically the point of the Odyssey is all these users have to go through and complete all these different tasks within the arbitrage arbitrum ecosystem to get these nfTs, which are markers of their having, like, they're kind of like popes, like, for having done these, these actions.
00:43:52.790 - 00:44:19.968, Speaker B: And the assumption of the community, and my assumption as well, is that there will be some relation between completing those tasks and getting the arbitrum token airdrop. I don't know the exact connection, but there will likely be some connection. So as a result, there's a very large amount of very interested users in the Odyssey. So I think the Odyssey already had its beginning, and it started as like the first week. It goes week by week. The first week was a bridge weekend. I think Hop was the most used bridge.
00:44:19.968 - 00:45:34.564, Speaker B: But they put hundreds of thousands of users through hop to get their Odyssey NFT. This Odyssey is going to restart, and it's basically going to direct hundreds of thousands of users through various arbitrum app layer protocols in exchange for probably giving them some future benefit with arbitrum Airdrop. And so you're going to have all these people that are just like fervently going through this Odyssey using all like, being effectively forced through these different application layers, these different applications, and just from like a mind share perspective and also a TVL and activity perspective, that's obviously a very powerful dynamic. So I think if you can try to look into which protocols you think are going to be part of the odyssey, and therefore you can predict basically in advance, okay, this product is going to get hundreds of thousands of new users and hundreds of thousands or not hundreds of thousands, but tons of new attention on social media and tons of people talking about it. And it's not rocket science then to figure out that, okay, maybe this token will perform well over that period of time. And it just so happens that period of time directly aligns with the lead up to the merge.
00:45:35.464 - 00:46:22.070, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I think I agree with your overall thinking and assumptions there. I've been very bullish on Altoo's for a long time, but I think your kind of, I guess, think thesis or thinking around the l two thesis actually playing out is true now. I mean, up until this point, there hasn't been that much activity, but now that it seems to be growing and it's kind of feeding off of itself. And it's funny because the Odyssey stuff, they paused it because they hit their limits too much activity. Yeah, it's too much activity on the network. So with nitro I think they're going to ten x the amount that they can handle. I wonder if that's enough sometimes because the demand seems to be going up and also because like you give people more block space, they're going to use it at the end of the day, like developers are going to use it, they're going to create more, more heavier applications that, that take advantage of this extra scalability.
00:46:22.070 - 00:46:31.238, Speaker A: So I do wonder what that's going to look like. But I agree with you that it's just another attention sink there, right. Especially post merge where people are like okay, what do we focus on now? You know, the merge.
00:46:31.286 - 00:46:37.494, Speaker B: I definitely agree with that. Like I definitely think post merge you could get a rotation into l two s and l two ecosystems.
00:46:37.654 - 00:47:26.488, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah exactly. So it's going to be interesting to see, to see that play out for sure. And obviously as an ETH maxi, I love seeing l two s eight into the l one market share. I think the l one stuff is kind of funny because it was such a huge thing late last year, like I guess like the six months of last year probably, and it was such a huge trade. But even just like with the fact that it's like as an investor you look at the tokens that are available to you and maybe you look at ETH and other l one s and you're like okay, well ETH is going to zero new supply entering the market in the next six to twelve months. And you have these alt al ones where theres a lot of supply overhang, especially from early investors and potentially team. And the way I look at it is like well then why would any investor really want to pile into these l ones, especially because theyre losing market share to l two s as well.
00:47:26.488 - 00:48:16.310, Speaker A: So I dont know, its kind of when people come to me and like oh im bullish on this l one, im like but why the token doesnt have any value accrual and then its competing with ETH and its competing with l two s and its like so and people call me an ETH maxi for having that view. It's like I'm just looking at the facts at the end of the day, like the facts are that ETH has going to have a much more positive, I guess as you put a structural supply kind of tokenomics broadly. Yeah, tokenomics I guess is the right term there broadly than something like an old tail one, but something like a lot of the tokens like not just all tail ones. A lot of tokens have these overhangs and they don't have the demand drivers that ETH does. They don't have the product market fit that ethereum does as a network. And that's kind of my whole view, and I always come back to ETH because of that. But I know one other thing I wanted to kind of talk about as well with regards to the merge trade was proof of work forks.
00:48:16.310 - 00:48:28.194, Speaker A: Like, do you think that they're going to be something that people take advantage of through, I guess there's this trade spot ETH long, spot ETH short, I guess like futures ETH or do you think it's kind of.
00:48:28.894 - 00:48:34.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I love people doing that trade. Yeah, I love to take the other side of it.
00:48:34.222 - 00:48:36.714, Speaker A: Explain why. I'd love to hear your thinking around that.
00:48:38.494 - 00:49:33.384, Speaker B: Well, firstly, broadly, I mean, there's some context on the fork. I don't think that the fork is going to be a very successful or viable long term project. I think that Ethereum classic already exists and fills most of this void and already has existed for a while, and it's going to have much better tokenomics than this other fork. It kind of fills everything that this other fork will do already. So there'll be this competition between this new fork and Ethereum classic anyway. And the bigger thing is just every holder of ETH is going to get three tokens that they can dump for free money and they're all going to die. So initially this fork is going to get just absolutely wrecked, I think.
00:49:33.384 - 00:50:23.516, Speaker B: I think it will just be nothing but sellers until it gets to a very depressed valuation. So there's people paying 3% to buy the fork right now, which is basically a $6 billion market cap. I think most ETH holders would very happily sell this at 6 billion. So why you would step in front of that to buy the fork in advance doesn't make a lot of sense to me because you can just wait till like the day the merge occurs successfully and you'll be able to buy the fork at well below that valuation, I would imagine, because literally every holder is going to be trying to dump on you. So, like, I don't really understand the need to go and buy the fork in advance when you know there's going to be this absolute rush of sellers. So that's the first thing I'd say. And I also don't really believe in the long term viability of it.
00:50:23.516 - 00:51:25.936, Speaker B: However, I do think there's a potential for it to catch a narrative. So I would imagine that the trajectory of the token follows similarly to a lot of other airdrops, where it launches at a price, gets completely wrecked for multiple days, and then everybody ends up selling it at depressed valuations. And then at that point, it's pretty washed out and it has like a squeeze on thin liquidity, makes new highs, and then just bleeds out into, like, eternity. So it's not to say that I don't think the fork will ever have a run. It's just that I don't think it makes any sense to pre buy your fork in front of massive known cell pressure. So, for me, I'm actually doing the opposite, which is I'm selling all my forks in advance because I'd like to sell before everyone else sells. So the way that I do that is I just swap my spot ETH position for the futures contract that everyone else is selling to try to get the fork.
00:51:25.936 - 00:52:00.578, Speaker B: So basically, I swap my spot position for the DEC future, which trades $30 below the spot ETH and should have some backwardation after. So you're probably capturing like $35. And before, when I was doing most of it, it was even higher. It was at $40. So I'm basically taking in $40 of free money in exchange for giving up my right to receive the fork. So, in essence, I'm selling my fork for $40 before it even happens. So, for me, that seems like a pretty easy and successful trade.
00:52:00.578 - 00:52:15.494, Speaker B: Even if I'm wrong and the fork is higher, I'm happy to take my 3%. Like, if I give up a couple percent, it is what it is. But my guess, my strong belief is that should I want to buy the fork, I'll be able to do so on day one at significantly cheaper prices.
00:52:16.474 - 00:52:41.484, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it's funny when you think, like, thinking about that, because there isn't just one of these forks. From what I've seen, there is, like two or three of them, and it's like, okay, well, this is just fragmenting attention even further. So if there is like two or three that go up, and then people are like, okay, what? Which one do I buy? Right? And then everyone's trying to sell every single fork. It's kind of like, where's that? As you're saying, where's that buying going to come from? Maybe when the dust settles and everything's calmed down.
00:52:41.524 - 00:53:12.984, Speaker B: I mean, to maintain this market cap, right? Like, all the tokens are distributed day one. So if you really think that this is going to have $6 billion market cap, let's just assume that half the people sell their forks, which I think is probably light. It's probably greater than that. But let's just assume half. If it's going to maintain a $6 billion market cap, you're literally going to need to find $3 billion to buy it. There is no chance. There's $3 billion of money ready to buy an ETH fork the day after the merge.
00:53:12.984 - 00:53:21.804, Speaker B: There's simply no chance. I mean, I don't believe in any, I don't believe ever in absolute certainty. So we'll not say there's no chance, but there's very low chance.
00:53:22.424 - 00:53:37.022, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I think so. And I got the same kind of, like, thinking around that as well. I just, yeah, I don't know who these buyers are going to be, especially in that size. There's probably going to be some buyers, maybe some people who don't understand the dynamics around it, but, yeah, I think.
00:53:37.038 - 00:54:03.184, Speaker B: There will be buyers at very depressed prices. If the fork goes to $500 million market cap, I'll buy some, and I think other people will buy some there. And at that price, you only need 250 million of buying power to absorb half the supply. So I think that's a potential scenario. You know, there probably is 250 demand for this kind of fork. And so I think something like that is what will end up happening. It probably won't ever reach 250.
00:54:03.184 - 00:54:21.462, Speaker B: It'll probably be like, I could see it going to, like one or 2 billion and kind of like, absorbing a billion dollars of sell pressure there. I think that that seems reasonable to me. But, so if I can sell it at 6 billion and I think it's going to go to two, it's like, it's a pretty positive ev decision.
00:54:21.648 - 00:54:39.402, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah, no, I think so. And it's, it's kind of like, I mean, I think it will just fade away over the, the longer term. I don't think it's going to have any longevity at all, especially because, like, I don't see anyone wanting to build on it. Everything's just going to blow up, and it's just going to have, like, a really bad start from all the dumping. So I think the long term prospects.
00:54:39.418 - 00:54:46.998, Speaker B: I'm certainly not a believer in. Yeah, like, just talking about, like, the further, like, the short term pumponomics is another question.
00:54:47.186 - 00:55:22.024, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I think so. And I think it, there will be some, some of that because it's funny, because, like, even if people are in the know, like, like you, you're still going to take that because you're counting on other people like just being speculators as well at the end of the day, and you're like, well, you know, if I can be a smarter speculator than them, then I'm going to take that, that trade and it makes perfect sense. And I think that's why people get caught off guard by a lot of the just absolute trash pumping in crypto. It's like, well, it's pumping because there's kind of this self fulfilling prophecy of all these speculators coming in, right? And then you just need to be smarter than the other speculator and get out before they do to win.
00:55:22.644 - 00:56:06.044, Speaker B: There's a lot of PvP games being played here, I think that's right. And like I said, I am a self became profit maximist. So whether I believe this fork has any long term value or not is completely irrelevant to the decision to buy it at 500 million market cap, because I think other people will pay me three times that at some point in the future. You have to be able, you have to, you have to be able to separate those things as an investor, especially in the space where the fundamentals are so opaque or otherwise, you just will fail. And then the other interesting trade, this one is a little bit more nuanced. I'm happy to talk about it, even though I don't have my full position on yet, because it's like so few people are set up to actually do it. I don't think that it'll move the price, it's more of just an interesting one.
00:56:06.044 - 00:57:29.322, Speaker B: But there's a pretty reasonable dislocation, in my opinion, between good, the Sep and de future points where I think it seems to me that, and I'm curious to get your take on this, but it seems like the market is pricing in a pretty sizable scenario that the merge gets pushed past September 30, which in my opinion is extremely low probability. But basically the September futures point trades about $15 above the December's future point. And it doesn't really make any sense to me because the March futures point is above the December's futures point. So the rest of the curve is implying what's called contango in the futures market. So like an upward slope that's specifically the SEPD's point is backward dated because I think they're pricing in some chance that the merge gets pushed past September, in which case the September point would go back to spot and the December point wouldn't. If you believe that, if you believe that the curve will be contango from SEp to DS after it's pricing in like, almost 50% chance of delay, which to me is just an absurd mispricing. I think the scenario is probably closer to, like 2%, if that.
00:57:29.322 - 00:58:12.046, Speaker B: But I guess I'm curious, though, like, you probably don't think about this too much, but do you have any views about what the shape of the futures curve will look like after the merge? Because it's an interesting question, actually, because on the one hand, ETH will be a yielding asset now. But saying that ETH is already a yielding asset, not much is changing. If it gives you 4% yield today, I think it will give you 5% yield post merge. Now, yes, the 4% today is not a real yield, and the 5% after the yield after the merge is a real yield. So it's a pretty big deal, even though that nominal shift is small. But as far as the futures market is concerned, they don't care about real yield versus nominal yield. It's just prices and nominal yield.
00:58:12.046 - 00:58:50.734, Speaker B: So, like. But anyway, post merge, there will be a 5% yield. So you could make an argument that the curve should have backwardation, meaning like, the futures trade below the spot, because otherwise you could sell the future above the spot, buy the spot, stake the spot, and get the yield and collect on both legs. But typically that's not what happens, which is, and what happens is that the futures actually do trade above spot because people are willing to pay a lot for the ability to get leverage and not actually have to put up all the collateral to buy the spot. But I'm curious if you have any views. It doesn't matter if you don't, but I'm curious if any views on how that futures curve will look like after the verge.
00:58:51.594 - 00:59:19.582, Speaker A: Probably not. Any views on the futures curve itself? It's definitely not something I pay that much attention to. Um, and you're obviously more versed in it than I am. But in terms of, like, the probabilities of the merge going past September 30, I mean, it's always a possibility, but, like, I just, I don't know how anyone could, could think that. And unless, unless, okay, say the merge doesn't get delayed and we don't push it back ourselves, and for some reason, TTD hash rate could move. Hash rate, yeah, exactly. So you're more betting bitcoin would have.
00:59:19.598 - 00:59:27.594, Speaker B: To move by so much at this point. Yeah, so much. It would have to, have to have.
00:59:27.894 - 00:59:30.038, Speaker A: Yeah, it would have to go down considerably. Yeah, yeah.
00:59:30.086 - 00:59:36.118, Speaker B: But I did have 50% today and remain 50% through the end of September. Yeah.
00:59:36.166 - 00:59:43.166, Speaker A: With a potentially and highly likely rising ETH price, which means the rewards are going up. Right. For miners. Right. Miners are still earning the reward.
00:59:43.230 - 00:59:54.028, Speaker B: And Hashrate has been stable for an extremely long time now, even with the merge coming. So I think that's like a 1%, probably less. It's a sub 1% probability scenario. Exactly.
00:59:54.076 - 00:59:56.052, Speaker A: So I don't understand that.
00:59:56.228 - 01:00:12.784, Speaker B: So I've put this trade on and I'm probably going to continue to put it on because I think that the merger will happen then. And I think basically once it happens, the seven points will pretty much trade in line with each other. But that's like another example of how you can kind of take advantage of people pricing in these forks.
01:00:13.114 - 01:00:22.178, Speaker A: I think it's probably an information asymmetry thing where a lot of people are just getting the wrong information about the merge and how it all works. Because to be honest, I hope so.
01:00:22.226 - 01:00:29.698, Speaker B: I hope I'm not missing something about the shape of the curve. I've done a lot of diligence on it and I can't seem to find any reason why I'm missing something.
01:00:29.826 - 01:00:53.752, Speaker A: I can't think of it either. I mean, maybe it really is just the complexities of how it's going to happen. Right. The TTD is not something simple to understand and how it actually activates the fact that the merge has been coming for six months, the next six months in perpetuity. It could be just all of that confluencing to cause this rather than anything else. But I don't study the curves really, ever.
01:00:53.848 - 01:01:08.814, Speaker B: My honest sense. My honest sense just to close the loop is that I think people are extremely short. The December point as the most common point to try to capture the fork. So I think it's just artificially depressed, but we'll see.
01:01:09.194 - 01:01:11.954, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I guess that would make the most sense probably there.
01:01:11.994 - 01:01:18.034, Speaker B: I think it's just. I think it's just positioning. But we'll see. We'll know. We'll know on September 15.
01:01:18.194 - 01:01:33.514, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. All right, well, that might be a perfect place to end it today, unless you've got anything else that you thought we should touch on. But I think we touched on a lot and I think it's going to be. This will be great. I think people are going to definitely enjoy the whole talk here. But, yeah.
01:01:33.514 - 01:01:36.458, Speaker A: Thank you for. For coming on and talking to me. How. This is great.
01:01:36.506 - 01:01:38.002, Speaker B: I appreciate you taking the time.
01:01:38.138 - 01:01:50.294, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. And I think, you know, we're all obviously very excited for the merge, looking forward to it at time of recording. It's only about three weeks away, so. Yeah. Good merging, I guess. Is that a thing we say these days? I don't know, but good merging.
01:01:50.634 - 01:01:55.266, Speaker B: I'm good with it. Today was the official mainnet announcement, so it's a good day for it.
01:01:55.370 - 01:01:58.694, Speaker A: Perfect day. Exactly. Well, thanks again and I'll see you later.
01:01:59.354 - 01:01:59.834, Speaker B: Thanks, man.
