00:00:00.520 - 00:00:45.926, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today is the 23 December 2020. Alright, let's get into the news. So a bit of more news regarding the kind of ripple drama from the last, I guess, 48 hours or so. So it came out yesterday that the SEC is not only charging Ripple and ripple the company, but also the two executives, two of the top executives at the company being the CEO, Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen, which is one of the company's co founders and the former CEO. So this is pretty, a pretty big deal. They're charging them with conducting a $1.3
00:00:45.926 - 00:01:33.854, Speaker A: billion unregistered securities offering. And as I said, they're not only charging Ripple the company, but they're charging the executives in an individual and personal capacity as well, which is quite a, quite of a bigger deal than just charging the company. I'm not going to claim to be a legal expert here. I know what the outcome of this is going to be. I mean, I kind of spoke about it a bit yesterday, how ripple and XRP have been, you know, under scrutiny for a very long time. A lot, a lot more information came out about this as well. Basically, the Larson and Garlinghouse basically sold $600 million worth of XRP for their personal gains, which is, you know, if this is an unregistered securities offering, they've obviously broken a bunch of laws here by doing this and they've enriched themselves on the back of this.
00:01:33.854 - 00:02:00.442, Speaker A: But basically, there's a really great thread from Stephen Paley here that I suggest you go and read. It's, it'll be linked in the show notes, of course. And he basically goes through the key points here. And basically, you know, why this is such a big deal and things like that. You know what they're actually charging them with how much they actually sold of XRP to the public. So you can actually see this table here for those watching. If I click in here, you can probably see it better.
00:02:00.442 - 00:02:45.748, Speaker A: So there's a table here that basically shows that Ripple sold XRP to both the open market and to institutional kind of investors as well. So they actually ended up selling more on the open market during 2017, 2018 and 2019 than they did to institutional investors, which, I mean, it makes sense, I guess, like 2017, especially right where there was a lot of, you know, feverish kind of people in the market, right? XRP went up to, I think, like $3.50 or something like that. So, yeah, it just shows that they've actually been selling this, not just institutions, but also to a lot of retail investors as well. So they basically netted a total of almost $1.4 billion here. They've even been selling during 2020 as well.
00:02:45.748 - 00:03:37.078, Speaker A: They, they sold $115 million worth to institutional investors there as well. I'm not sure how happy those institutional investors are right now if they've held onto it. But, yeah, just a little table there. If we click out of that, we can basically see here that they also paid money to exchanges to get listed. Now, this isn't unheard of, right? Everyone knows that certain exchanges will charge a listing fee, and if you pay it, you'll obviously get listed. But apparently Ripple was very aggressive about this, and it was one of their mandates to get XRP onto, like, every exchange that they could, which makes sense from a kind of liquidity point of view where they wanted to build up liquidity for the token or for the coin or whatever you want to call it. And as highlighted here in this picture, it says, larson and his wife personally netted approximately $450 million from these XRP sales.
00:03:37.078 - 00:04:11.706, Speaker A: So the common narrative from Ripple has been they're selling XRP in order to fund the developments of Ripple, but in reality, and what everyone knew already was that they're selling it to enrich themselves, essentially. Right. It's not really helping the company. It's not doing much on that front. So, yeah, I don't want to spend too long on this today because there's a bunch of exciting ethereum stuff to get into. But I think this is, this is big news because as you can actually see in the markets right now, XRP is dropping a lot and it's actually dragging the rest of the market down with it. And that's simply because, you know, XRP is one of the biggest coins.
00:04:11.706 - 00:04:47.708, Speaker A: Like, it's third. There's a lot of bots that trade against, you know, the bigger coins on exchanges. And, and now the markets are just reacting to that and it's kind of caused the chain reaction here. So ripples, this lawsuit against ripple is, is a big deal for, I guess, like the wider market as well, just in terms of perception and things like that. You know, people are now saying, well, if XRP is an unregistered security, then so all these defi tokens. So, you know, without further clarity from these regulators, we can't actually know what, what is actually going to be a security and what, what isn't going to be a security. So it's very hard to tell.
00:04:47.708 - 00:05:30.984, Speaker A: But I think with ripple they're just like the biggest, right? And they've obviously done a lot of shady things in the past with XRP, so it makes sense for this to happen. But yeah, I'm very curious to see how this plays out. Do they pay a fine and get away with it? Do they're not gonna go to jail or anything like that? Right. But do they go to court, try to fight it and then eventually settle? You know, from what I've seen, apparently they've been trying to fight it and they don't want to settle. So maybe this year we'll make it all the way to court and they'll have to sit in there and they'll have to kind of like convince a jury that they didn't do this thing and if they lose, that's even worse for them. Um, so yeah, we'll see what happens with this. I'll keep you guys updated and let's move on to some more exciting things.
00:05:30.984 - 00:06:03.118, Speaker A: So Defi Pulse released their new bitcoin at work section today. So there's a thread here that explains it, but you can basically see it here. So this is a page on Defi pulse that's dedicated to bitcoin within Ethereum Defi. Now I mean it shows bitcoin on Ethereum Defi, but basically it's just showing the tokenized BTC. So you can see here that each of the tokenized BTC versions are listed. Obviously wrapped bitcoin is the largest. Then you have Ren BTC, HBTC and a bunch of others.
00:06:03.118 - 00:06:20.390, Speaker A: Right. There's a ton now. So if we click through here to WBTC, we can see that it's growth over time. But it doesn't actually show where this BTC is. Right. Or where this WBTC is. Doesn't show that it's in uniswap or compound or whatever like that.
00:06:20.390 - 00:06:48.234, Speaker A: It just shows that it's been growing. And you can see the growth has actually been quite amazing here. If you go to one year, right, it was basically non existent at the start of this year, wrapped bitcoin. And then as yield farming heated up in June when compounds kind of yield farming kicked off, you know, we saw that explosion, right? And it's kind of like gone down a little bit and stalled out here over the last few weeks. So yeah, I mean, I'm glad they've got a dedicated section for this. I wonder if it's still on the homepage. Let me have a look here.
00:06:48.234 - 00:07:19.286, Speaker A: No, I don't think it is actually, WBTC used to be up here. It doesn't seem it is. And yeah, if we just do that, it seems that they're tracking BTC in. Okay, so they are tracking the BTC in these apps on the main page, but on the actual dedicated bitcoin page they're tracking like the tokenized versions, which makes sense. So yeah, this is, this is quite, quite cool, I think. You know, I don't know if there's a cap to how much BTC comes onto Ethereum. I think it only comes for a reason.
00:07:19.286 - 00:07:47.428, Speaker A: As you can see from this chart, there's literally no reason to bring your bitcoin over to Ethereum unless you're going to use it to do something right there. You know, if you're just bringing it over and holding it in your wallet. I mean, to me, I mean, maybe you can make the argument that you're doing it so that it's kind of like all your bitcoins within. Sorry. All your assets are in like one home, right? Just have them in like your, your ethereum address and you don't have to worry about multiple addresses. But again, routes. Bitcoin is custodial.
00:07:47.428 - 00:08:10.708, Speaker A: I wouldn't like, if I was holding bitcoin, I wouldn't want to obviously give it over to a custodian essentially, and put it on Ethereum. Like I'd just keep it on bitcoin unless I'm doing something with it, unless I'm yield. Farming with it or something like that. So. Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't make much sense unless the, you know, unless you're using it in Defi. I don't expect this to go back down to the levels that we saw over here, you know, earlier on. I expect it to stay up here at a.
00:08:10.708 - 00:08:24.784, Speaker A: You know, and maybe it'll come down a bit more. It could maybe even go down a lot from here. Just depends. Right? I doubt it because Defi is going to keep growing and BTC is a. Is a pretty, I guess like great collateral because it's liquid. Right. It's, it's very.
00:08:24.784 - 00:08:54.792, Speaker A: Has a very high mark cap. There's a lot of holders and things like that. Right. So I expect that to just not fall too much here and maybe it starts growing again. Um, you know, I've got another thing here I'm going to talk about later about ETH locked in Defi, and I want to explain a bit there, but WBTC or BTC locking Defi in general seems to have slowed down for now. You can see here right across the board, it's kind of, you know, petered out here. This is taking into consideration WBTC and all the other tokenized BTCs as well.
00:08:54.792 - 00:09:28.600, Speaker A: But the reason I focus on WBTC is because it has much more than even a second. Like Ren BTC has 14K, WBTC has 115k. So it's basically not really too comparable right now. It's kind of like a winner takes almost everything market in the tokenized BTC space, but we'll see how it plays out. So, yeah, I just thought I'd show you guys that because I thought that was quite interesting. All right, so for those who don't know, there is an ethereum developer called Virgil Griffith. He has been around for quite a while.
00:09:28.600 - 00:10:01.266, Speaker A: The reason why you probably haven't heard of him over the last few months is because he literally can't use technology because he is facing charges over, I guess, conspiracy, like conspiring with North Korea or attempting to conspire with North Korea. So there's. The updates are scarce on this. I think he's getting fair representation. I think he has a really good lawyer from memory. He has the same lawyer that Eos had when they defended themselves against the ACC and only had to pay a $24 million fine, as I spoke about yesterday, for their token offering. So.
00:10:01.266 - 00:10:25.658, Speaker A: And from what I know, that lawyer is actually very good in general. Not just for crypto stuff, but in general. So he's got a very, very good lawyer. So there was this news that came out today that he will. That Virgil's likely going to face a trial next September. So, I mean, this is like, as a sidebar for a sec, this just shows how slow the legal process is. I'm pretty sure he was arrested like late last year from memory.
00:10:25.658 - 00:11:03.566, Speaker A: And now his trial won't be till next September. So it'll be almost two years from, like arrest to trial for. For Virgil. And I wonder if he's going to be able to access kind of like the Internet or like Twitter or anything before that happens. I don't know how it works, but basically, yeah, he's being charged by the US government and they want to argue that Virgil helped North Koreans better understand how crypto could be used to bypass financial sanctions on the nation. Now, I'm not going to opine too much on this, but I will say one thing. The information that they're saying that Virgil kind of gave to north, the North Koreans is freely available on the Internet.
00:11:03.566 - 00:11:35.478, Speaker A: Right. Even if Virgil taught them how to use aetherium, taught them how to use metamask, taught them how to basically go through tornado cash even like that, that sort of stuff. Virgil isn't like, it's not closed knowledge. Like he's not the only person in the world that knows how to do this. It's all freely available on the Internet. So just don't see like why that's such a huge deal. But at the same time, like obviously, you know, we don't want to be giving, I mean the US doesn't want people giving knowledge and over to like the north korean government and things like that.
00:11:35.478 - 00:12:01.502, Speaker A: And I totally understand that. But at the same time, if they're charging Virgil with basically teaching them how to do things when that knowledge is already available online and they don't even have to use Virgil or whatever, then I think it's kind of a weak argument. But I'm not a lawyer. You know, the US government is a lot bigger than I am, of course. I mean, I don't even have to say that, right? It's obvious. But I just feel bad because I, I mean, Virgil's a friend of mine. I met him at a couple conferences.
00:12:01.502 - 00:12:44.612, Speaker A: Uh, he, you know, we, we got along really well. He's obviously very loved within the community. Uh, if you've seen the things on Twitter about him, I just think that this is some overreach and I really hope that what happens here isn't similar to what happened to Ross Ulbricht with the Silk Road case where he got like a ridiculous sentence for the alleged crimes. I think he got like three or four lifetime sentences, something ridiculous. It was definitely like he'd be in there for life sort of thing, which was basically a very harsh sentence to kind of send a message and, and, you know, to, I guess like anyone else who wanted to run one of these dark net markets, I really hope they don't do this with Virgil. I think that would be incredibly unfair. But we won't know, I guess, until now.
00:12:44.612 - 00:13:01.336, Speaker A: Next September now. So still another 9910 months out, unfortunately. So, yeah. Virgil, I know you're not watching this, but you know where we're thinking of you, you know, we hope that you get through this. All right. All right. An update out of the Ethereum cat herders this week.
00:13:01.336 - 00:13:57.812, Speaker A: Well, I guess yesterday. So for those who don't know, the Ethereum cat herders is basically this little group of a few people that keeps up to date with what's going on in ETH one land and kind of blurring into ETH two land. Now they try to make sure that things are kept on top of that, the community is updated with what's going on because there's a lot going on within ETH one protocol development and ETH two as well. So yeah, they always post these updates I think once a week or something or maybe once every two weeks. But they're really great, I love them. You can see here that they've got like a really nice summary at the top. So talking about Yolov three, which is one of the testnets for ETH one for the next network upgrade code named Berlin, they talk about ETH one client updates, ETH two mainnet updates, client updates in general for ETH two, the 1559 implementers meetings, the EIP IP meetings, community updates and more.
00:13:57.812 - 00:14:28.952, Speaker A: Right. So it's a, it's quite a lengthy read here. I'm not going to go through it now, but if you want to stay on top of a theorem one dot or development with a bit of a theorem two.org stuff like protocol work, I would highly suggest following this medium page is where they kind of where they, where they publish this stuff in the Ethereum cat herders medium page. I will link it in the description of course. But yeah, this is, this is the best resource. I think there's a lot of things that get scattered around, especially on like the ETH research forum and like YouTube and Twitter and everything.
00:14:28.952 - 00:15:10.718, Speaker A: And it's kind of hard to keep track of. And these, you know, the cat herders do an amazing job here of this. So definitely suggest going to checking this out for yourself. But yeah, there's a lot happening in ETH one right now. I think from what I know we're aiming to have the next network upgrade code named Berlin to go in Q one next year, probably early Q one hopefully. And then there's a bunch of other kind of, I guess network upgrades that we need to get in as well, or at least eips that we want to get in before 1559 can go in. And I actually think when 1559 goes in that might be the last network upgrade that happens on ETH one before the ETH two merger.
00:15:10.718 - 00:15:51.906, Speaker A: So the ETH one to ETH two merger happens. So that's going to be a big milestone as well. But yeah, if you want to learn more go click on this in the description and check out this link for yourself. Also, out of the cat herders today was a kind of blog post describing the new Ethereum improvement process. So basically for those who don't know aips, I mean it stands for Ethereum improvement proposals. And these are kind of things that are required to kind of like be reviewed and go through a process in order to get them into the Ethereum mainnet. So every network upgrade on Ethereum contains one or more aips that go in.
00:15:51.906 - 00:16:24.554, Speaker A: So AIP 1559, for example, is, is an EIP and the number is basically just like sequential from kind of like when it started number one all the way up to, I think it's in the two thousands at this point, or maybe even the three thousands. There's a lot there. Not every AIP actually goes into the Ethereum mainnet. Some of them never do. Famously AIP 999 kind of died. And what that AIP was, was to rescue the frozen parity multisig funds, which with the majority belonging to the parity team. So that was a famous one that died.
00:16:24.554 - 00:17:10.226, Speaker A: And there's many others, right, that people, you know, anyone can propose these things and submit them on GitHub, and then it's up to kind of the core developers, the community, everyone else kind of in the ecosystem to decide if they want it or not or they want it to go in. Is it going to benefit the Ethereum network? No. Well then it's not going in sort of thing. So this is basically an update to that process because that process has basically been defined in EIP one, but that was published a long time ago, so we want to update that process and make it more streamlined. So I think what they have done here, they've added a bunch of new statuses here. So during the EIP lifecycle there'll be statuses assigned to each EIP. So it starts off as a draft, it goes to a review now.
00:17:10.226 - 00:17:40.032, Speaker A: So review is basically the, one of the new statuses. It goes through our last call to kind of review and then final, and then it goes from living to stagnant to withdrawn. So that doesn't have to, I mean it doesn't have to go into every status, for example. So if it's a living status, I mean, I think they define them down here. Yeah, living is a renaming of for the previous status, active. So if an EIP is active, then it's alive. If it's stagnant, it means that, I think eips have gone stale.
00:17:40.032 - 00:18:07.908, Speaker A: Obviously. If it's withdrawn it means that the original author has been, has formally removed it or I think, I don't think it has to be the author. Yeah, I think it does have to be. The author has removed it and said, you know, I don't want to do this anymore, don't worry about it, basically. So yeah, there's a bunch of statuses here that get assigned to the aips. Now this is an incredibly important process and this is how we kind of like do this decentralized governance and come to consensus on things. So you want this to be as robust as possible.
00:18:07.908 - 00:18:38.668, Speaker A: So I'm really glad to see the cat herders taking a stab here and making sure that they kind of define this properly and getting everyone on the same page, the core developers, the community, you know, everyone else in the ecosystem, like exchanges, infrastructure providers, you know, app developers, all this sort of stuff. You want to make sure everyone understands the process, and that's what the cathoders are doing here. So again, another shout out to the cat herders. They're doing great work here. I'll link this in the description. You can go check it out for yourself. A teaser from Parsec Finance.
00:18:38.668 - 00:19:31.528, Speaker A: Parsec finance was, was published yesterday. So for those who don't know, Parsec is the, I guess, trying to be the Bloomberg of Defi or of ethereum, where they're going to have this whole dashboard, as you can see on the screen right in front of me, the screenshot where you can have different widgets and you can go kind of like trade do things in Defi, monitor prices all from one dashboard. Now, as you can see in front of me in the middle there, they've got like a chart of uni versus USD. So you can keep an eye on the price there. On the right hand side, they have a trending kind of little box there that you can keep an eye on which assets are actually trending on the certain day and you know how much they've gone up by what their price is, that sort of stuff. Bottom right, you have like a market cap table where you can see the differences and the changes in different assets based on their market cap. You can see the trades down the bottom, uni against ETH.
00:19:31.528 - 00:20:02.140, Speaker A: I mean, on the left hand side you can see kind of like the Defi fire hose, as they call it, where they, where that's like monitoring different trades and things like that. So these aren't the only kind of elements that are going to be on here. There's a lot more coming. I've actually used this app myself and it's quite fun to use. So I think this is going to appeal to people who are frequently trading the most because that's what the Bloomberg terminal kind of appeals to. And from memory. There's also a news section that pulls news and kind of like pulls it up there.
00:20:02.140 - 00:20:25.920, Speaker A: So it really is exactly like a Bloomberg terminal. Now, you've probably, I don't know if you, if you have seen a Bloomberg terminal before, but it looks similar to this. But it's mainly, I mean, I think it cost $5,000 a month to, to have a Bloomberg terminal, so. And you don't need it unless you're like actively trading. So most people would not have seen it. But if you just google it, you'll be able to see what it looks like. But this is really cool.
00:20:25.920 - 00:20:40.540, Speaker A: They're saying that next month they're going to be releasing this to the public. So I've been using the beta version and it's been quite good. So yeah, go follow them and def. I'm not even following them. Whoops. Go follow them. And definitely, you know, keep your eyes peeled for this.
00:20:40.540 - 00:21:14.194, Speaker A: I think it's gonna be really cool, especially if you're a really active trader or someone really active within defi. You definitely want this tool in your kind of like, tool belt, for sure. All right, an announcement out of a yam today. So they launched their official collaboration with UmA protocol called degenerative. Degenerative finance. You know, it's funny, one of my friends said the other day that they listened to another podcast I did on ethub and I struggled saying the word degenerative and he kind of linked me to the Google pronunciation of it. I was like, I was like, okay.
00:21:14.194 - 00:21:37.114, Speaker A: And you guys, you called it degenerate finance. I'm like, yeah, because that's what everyone says, right? But the degenerative finance, that's how you, that's how you say it. But enough of that. Basically what this is is that it's kind of a home for this cutting edge defi derivatives, they call it. So it's built by yam, built on Umay, and built for Djen. So see, there you go, it says DJ. And so I can call it DJ finance.
00:21:37.114 - 00:22:08.902, Speaker A: So this, this is really cool. I think this isn't, you know, I spoken about the collaboration between Yam and Uma before, but they've launched like an official site here. So if we actually click through here, you can connect your wallet and you can start minting their Ugas token, which actually is tracking the Ethereum gas prices over time. You can deposit, you can redeem, withdraw and LP liquidity, provide and trade. So this is great. I really love this. I think that we need more of these collaborations within the ecosystem.
00:22:08.902 - 00:22:55.692, Speaker A: I mean, I know a couple weeks ago I spoke about the Wyoming ecosystem and how they're doing a lot of different collaborations with different protocols. They called them mergers, but as I said, I thought they were partnerships, collaborations, and that's exactly what Yam and your may are doing here. And there's a bunch of other protocols just like kind of teaming up and making sure that, like, they can share resources because there's no point being a closed ecosystem. You know, having all these expertise and in an open source world and just keeping it close to your chest, that's not the spirit of Defi, it's not the spirit of Ethereum, and that's not how we can basically make these products better. So I'm really glad to see Yam and YoMay do this. I hope that, you know, more teams do this. I hope that, you know, Yam in particular teams up with other teams because I think Yam in particular is really well positioned for this.
00:22:55.692 - 00:23:26.240, Speaker A: And I've spoken about this before. I know I talk about Yam a lot here, but I actually think that they've got an amazing community. They've got a really, really great treasury to kind of like pay out this community. And this treasury isn't just in yam tokens, it's in other things as well. They have USD in the form of YusD. They have the defi pulse index, they have a bit of ETH, they have index tokens, they have a mixture there. So they have like this strong treasure that they can build over time and they can partner up with projects and like, you know, fund different things and get stuff built.
00:23:26.240 - 00:24:13.944, Speaker A: So I think that's, that's basically Yam's kind of like innovation here and it's strong suit. And I'm really curious to see where this goes. But yeah, go check this out. You can meet you guys tokens if you want, if that's something you're interested in as well. As I said, you can just do it here, but this will be linked in the description for you to check out. All right, last thing, a tweet from DC investor today where he basically says that he and I, and I quote, he says, and I quote, sorry, this is the most important chart for the emerging ethereum based economy, and it's ticking back up again after the cool off period from Defi mania of Q two, Q three and the subsequent launch of the ETH two beacon chain. So this chart that he's talking about for those who are listening in is the ETH locked in Defi chart.
00:24:13.944 - 00:24:38.122, Speaker A: So he's got a screenshot of it here. But I'm going to go back to Defi Pulse and I'm going to click here and bring it up for all you to see here. So if I go to. I guess I should go to all here, or if I go to one year, it's probably easier to see. Yeah. So you can see on the screen here that basically during Defi summer, ETH locked in Defi peaked at about 9.3 million ethics, and then it dropped off after that.
00:24:38.122 - 00:25:13.472, Speaker A: I spoken about how the major drop off that you see here actually was from Uniswap. So what ended up happening was that Uniswap's uni mining rewards kind of ended, and then people kind of obviously withdraw their ETH from Uniswap that they were using to farm, and they didn't put it back into Defi. The majority didn't go back into Defi. What I actually do think happened is that a lot of it went to ETH two. Because if you think about it, there's a kind of, like, overlap between the Uniswap community and the people who wanted uni tokens and the people who are farming, the people who have ETH already. Right. And wanted to farm with it and, you know, putting it into ETH, too.
00:25:13.472 - 00:25:32.766, Speaker A: So it's actually quite, quite funny, because if you look at the amount locked in Defi right now, it's 7.3 million. Do you know how much ETH is in ETH two? Right now it's 2 million. What was the peak in Defi summer? 9.3 million. I haven't done the on chain analysis here, but I'm willing to bet that a lot of this ETH went into ETH two. It's probably not 100% of it.
00:25:32.766 - 00:25:50.558, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely not 100% of it, but it seems a lot went into it. So if you actually put ETH two here, it would come up right under maker. It would be maker ETH two compound Uniswap. Right. So technically, we haven't actually fallen from 9.3 locked in Defi. It's just that ETH two isn't classified as Defi.
00:25:50.558 - 00:26:15.118, Speaker A: It's just gone elsewhere. And you can actually see that after the kind of dropped to, I guess, 6.7 million ETH locked on November 25, which is funny, I think it was like a day after the kind of deadline for getting your ETH in to ETH two. After that, we see an uptick here from 6.7 million back up to 7.3 million, almost. And it's ticking back up.
00:26:15.118 - 00:26:30.138, Speaker A: So people are getting back into Defi. This could be new people coming in, right. We had those people going to ETH two. That's kind of like at 2 million. I mean, I don't expect it to go too much higher. And now people are going back into Defi with their ETH. So this was really cool.
00:26:30.138 - 00:26:57.286, Speaker A: I thought, you know, it was great for DC investor to point this out. I really want to do some on chain analysis on this. I want to know how much ETH went from, you know, particularly went from farming uni on Uniswap to ETH two. And, I mean, I don't have the tools to do that. I don't think it's like an easy job either. You have to basically have all the data in front of you and dig through it. But, you know, if, I mean, if anyone listening or watching knows how to, how to do that or knows an easy way to do that or has someone who can do that for me, please reach out to me.
00:26:57.286 - 00:27:20.320, Speaker A: Just dm me on Twitter because I'm very curious to see how that played out. So, you know, as I said, if we include ETH two in this, we're at 9.3 million ETH. We're basically at all time high. I don't usually include ETH two in this because it's technically not Defi, but the kind of definition has been blurred as well. You know, locked in Defi isn't really kind of like, accurate because, you know, it's. Most of it isn't locked.
00:27:20.320 - 00:27:40.208, Speaker A: You know what, it's ironic because what, because what's actually locked is the Ethan ETH two, but that's not considered locked ETH in defy. Right. So it's quite ironic there. But I just call this, like, ethan Defi. Right. Not locked because it's definitely not locked. Any one of these kind of people that have deposited their ETH into these different apps can withdraw at any time.
00:27:40.208 - 00:28:02.254, Speaker A: Hardly any of them are locked. I think the only ones that it's. I know of that are locked is like Nexus mutual. So if you buy X and M with ETH and then you stake the XM, it gets locked. So you can't go back and get your ETH straight away. I think maybe a few of the others here, depending on what you do on these apps, will lock your ETH two. But it's not very long either.
00:28:02.254 - 00:28:19.284, Speaker A: It's definitely not something that's locked for black. It is with ETH two for one, two years. It's. It's very, very short. I think the longest is definitely Nexus mutual. I think that's a three month thing. But again, that's just not locking the ETH specifically, it's locking the NXM that you've bought with ETH sort of thing.
00:28:19.284 - 00:28:36.262, Speaker A: But yeah. Anyway, I think this is a really interesting to start to keep an eye on. And the fact that it's ticking back up again is really great because obviously that was that brutal drop off. But I guess it kind of makes sense because of the uniswap rewards. I definitely makes sense. I think, you know, if. Even if I click into uniswap here, you'll be able to see it, right? Look at that.
00:28:36.262 - 00:28:59.526, Speaker A: Right? If I click ETH, look at that, 3.2 million ETH down to like 1.2 or something, right? That's 2 million ETH. It's just, it's matching up too perfectly for me to think this is a coincidence that 2 million ETH fell out of Uniswap, didn't go back into Defi, but ETH two has 2 million ETH in it now. I don't know, I just. I find that really funny. But maybe it's just a coincidence, but it's quite funny to look at.
00:28:59.526 - 00:29:06.746, Speaker A: But anyway, I digress. I will. I will end the episode here. So. Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for watching listening. Subscribe to the YouTube channel.
