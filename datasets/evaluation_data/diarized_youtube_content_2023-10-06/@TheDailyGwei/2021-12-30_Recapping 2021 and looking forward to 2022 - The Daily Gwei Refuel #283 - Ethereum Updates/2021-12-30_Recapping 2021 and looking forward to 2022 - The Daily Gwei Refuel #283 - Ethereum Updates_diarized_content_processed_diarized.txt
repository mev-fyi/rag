00:00:00.280 - 00:00:35.258, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Deadly Way refuel, where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Sosano, and today's the 30 december 2021. Alright, everyone, so today is going to be a special episode of the refuel. I don't have any news in front of me, it's just me on the camera. And I mentioned yesterday that I'm going to be recapping the year of 2021 as this will be the last refuel I do for this year. So we'll be starting off by kind of like, you know, obviously starting from January of this year, going all throughout this year, I'm just going to give my thoughts on what happened. You know, you know, all the, all the big things in the ethereum ecosystem, but also in the crypto space more widely and also going into next year, what I expect to happen as well.
00:00:35.258 - 00:01:01.066, Speaker A: So, yeah, let's, let's start from the beginning. You know, 2021 has been a funny year. I think overall, really, I think most people got things wrong, like with their predictions. There are a lot of things that people thought, okay, well, this was going to happen or this was going to happen, and it ended up being like completely wrong. And I think one of the major things of that was basically around the market. Everyone expected, you know, we'd have like a massive bull market all throughout 2021. We'd have a blow off top towards the end and then we'd go into a bear market again.
00:01:01.066 - 00:01:29.774, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think everyone expected that. It's just like, that was the consensus that I saw kind of play out in the Twitter sphere and in other places as well. So I guess in January 8 started off in a pretty weird place. I mean, it was still dollar 700. Like, can you believe that? I think on January 1, 2021, ETH was dollar 730. And only a few weeks prior to that it was, it had been like 400 or something. So nothing obviously to scoff at or, sorry, nothing to kind of like write home about, of course.
00:01:29.774 - 00:02:21.206, Speaker A: But then it ended the month at $1400, almost all time high there, which was crazy. I mean, I'm pretty sure it, yeah, it did reach all time high in January, or it broke its old all time high in January, which was like three years after it had, um, it had, uh, broken the all time high, uh, in January of 2018. So that was obviously a really big deal. But it's just funny, like how quickly it moved. I mean, we came off 2020 where it was all about Defi and all about kind of like bitcoin because, uh, you know, there was institutions kind of piling into it, and ETH kind of like, took a backseat, and people were, like, really bearish on ethics. And then ETH just kind of, like, teleported to its old all time high in January. And then obviously over the next few months, it went into a crazy bull market and ended, you know, in May of 2021, ended up at $4,400 and then came back down to 1700, then went back up and, you know, it's been a crazy, been like a yo yo, essentially.
00:02:21.206 - 00:02:56.294, Speaker A: And what, the price is 3700 right now or something like that, 3800. So it really has been just a massive, kind of like yo yo for the price. But price obviously wasn't the only thing that happened in 2021. I think the other massive narrative that played out that I think a lot of people didn't see coming was the alternative l one s. Obviously, there are a lot of people who thought that they would kind of, like, fail and fail to get any traction, that Ethereum was fine, that Ethereum would scale before any of these things could get traction. And to be honest, I was one of those people with L2. I understand why it's taken longer than everyone kind of thought it would, but it definitely has.
00:02:56.294 - 00:03:35.238, Speaker A: You know, the fact that it's taken longer has also given rise to these alternative l one s because they've kind of, like, played with the narrative and the marketing of, oh, you know, Ethereum can't scale. The fees are really high. Come use us. We're cheap. But as I mentioned yesterday, I actually think that regardless of Ethereum's high fees, these other l one s basically would have taken off because of the fact that they used the tried and tested playbook of liquidity mining, which came from 2020, where everyone kind of saw, well, if you put token incentives on something and you do it right, you can get lots of liquidity really, really quickly, and it can lead to price rise for the asset, for your native asset. That's got to do with the project or the chain or whatever. And it's really good marketing and even business development as well, from that perspective.
00:03:35.238 - 00:04:15.398, Speaker A: So I think that playbook has kind of, like, been refined to be an art at this point where everyone's just basically copying everyone else and being like, okay, well, this is how we do it. This is how we grow. And as I mentioned yesterday, I think that l two should be focusing on this going into 2022. But, yeah, that was a big theme of 2021 that certainly most people didn't see playing out and I think it was because a lot of the people that were around earlier this year and kind of like later year, they weren't new. They were like people that had been around since the last bull market and they'd seen the other l one s and like how much, how much traction they didn't get. For example, all of them. All of them, basically even the biggest one, like eos from the 2017 2018 era, didn't go anywhere.
00:04:15.398 - 00:04:39.194, Speaker A: And so I think there's a lot of hangover from that. People were like, okay, well, they failed. There's nothing that, you know, none of these l one s can succeed. It's all a theory and let's just focus all our efforts there. Obviously, you know, I still believe that it's mostly ethereum, you know, over the long term. But these other l one s have really worked to kind of like capture the mind share of a certain group of certain communities, like, especially as the asset goes up in price. You really do build a community quite nicely because of that.
00:04:39.194 - 00:05:09.504, Speaker A: So that's, that's one theme. I think the second theme that most people didn't see of 2021 was nfts. They took off massively, right? Like we, we not, we didn't only have like one NFT mania, we had many. And I think we're kind of, kind of like going into one right now, to be honest. Like NFT volumes are spiking up again. It's just, it really feels like the NFT market seems to kind of like play a bull and bear market much, much faster than the normal crypto markets. Like, you could argue that since May ETH has been, it hasn't been in a bear market, but it's been in a sideways market.
00:05:09.504 - 00:05:31.280, Speaker A: Right. It's just kind of neutral. It's not really doing anything. I mean, yes, it went to a new all time high of 4900, but that wasn't really much higher than the old one. And then it came back down again. And we've just been in this range from like 3000 to 5000 for, for a while now. Um, and, you know, as I mentioned plenty of times now, I think January and Q one is going to be really, really good for the overall market in general and for crypto.
00:05:31.280 - 00:06:03.922, Speaker A: But yeah, since may ETH just hasn't really done much in terms of like price price movement. And, you know, I'm used to it as, as I've been in this ecosystem for a long time now. But a lot of people out there see this sideways move and then they see all these other assets kind of pumping up and they're like, oh, my God, why am I, you know, sitting in either could be chasing these other things. That's a whole obviously different discussion that's got to do with, you know, how to. How to make investments and how to do investing there. But I think that the NFT mania is definitely something that most people didn't see coming. I knew NFts were going to be kind of like a big deal, but no way did I think that they were going to grow as fast as they did.
00:06:03.922 - 00:06:30.420, Speaker A: And I also didn't see a lot of the Fud coming either. Like, people legitimately think nfts are scams. Like, not the actual scammy nfts. I think all nFts are scams. There was a lot of concern about the environmental impact of nfts. Some of the l one s, like Tezos, are hopped on about that, and we're actually able to get a bit of traction in the NFT ecosystem by doing that. Don't think it really helped their asset price too much, though, which is, which is funny when you kind of like, compare tezos to some of the other alternative l ones and how kind of the market treats them.
00:06:30.420 - 00:07:12.240, Speaker A: It's definitely a funny beast there, but they did succeed in getting a lot of people to go there who are environmentally conscious because taylor is obviously a proof of stake blockchain and not a proof of work one. And then, you know, you had basically what happened with NFTs reminded me of what happened with ICOs in 2017, where people were doing the kind of like gas wars in order to get into these NFTs, to get into the mint, in order to immediately resell it on the secondary market for like two, three x or more profit. I mean, sometimes it was much more than that. There were some that kind of like, went ten x instantly. And it reminded me very much of icos in 2017 where people were doing the same thing. They were having kind of like gas wars getting into the ICO and then waiting for it to be listed on an exchange. Because there wasn't actually really any dexs back then.
00:07:12.240 - 00:07:30.184, Speaker A: There was no uniswap or anything. There was ether Delta, but that was an on chain order book exchange that was really cumbersome to use. It required people to kind of, you know, actively manage their liquidity and things like that. So it was a lot harder. But still, people did it right. You would, you would hope for a centralized exchange listing and then you could flip it. And it worked for a little bit.
00:07:30.184 - 00:08:00.022, Speaker A: But then obviously the mania subsides the money runs out and, you know, the market kind of crashes from there, and icos crashed really, really hard. I mean, a lot of them went down 90%. You know, many of them went down 99%. It's just a, none of, most of them haven't even recovered. So, you know, pretty much like a lot of wasted money there, really. And I think the same thing happened with nfts. There are a lot of profile picture nfts that kind of, I guess, like, started coming out after the success of crypto punks and bored apes and things like that.
00:08:00.022 - 00:09:03.622, Speaker A: And I think nfts, I mean, I think it's been a good thing for nfts that they've had these manias because it brings a lot more attention, brings a lot more people into the ecosystem. And as I've mentioned plenty of times, I do believe nfts are going to be the best onboarding vehicle, or at least one of the best onboarding vehicles that we have throughout 20, not 2022, but, like pretty much throughout the adoption cycle of crypto. Now, other than nfts, I think the next biggest theme, if I was to pick one, is basically how many people got things wrong? Cause I think that's actually a theme because there were at the, if you compare the start of the year and what people thought would, how 2021 would play out and to kind of like where we are today, most people got it wrong. And I think the biggest thing that people got wrong was around DeFi and how DeFi tokens would perform at the start of 20, 1720, sorry, 2017. At the start of 2021, everyone was bullish on DeFi tokens except a select few. I know Degen Spartans being kind of like bearish on them for a while, but everyone was really, really bullish on them. The logic was, okay, Defi tokens had a really awesome run in 2020 through DeFi summer.
00:09:03.622 - 00:09:38.872, Speaker A: Now they're cooling off a bit, but they're just getting ready for their next kind of like leg up. All these institutions and traditional finance investors are going to come in, they're going to buy up these DeFi tokens, and it's all going to be well and good. And then what happened was most DeFi tokens, not all of them, but most of them, especially the ones that people thought were safe, kind of blue chips like Aave and SNX and Wifi and all that sort of stuff, they got wrecked, like absolutely wrecked against USD, and they got even more wrecked against ETH. They've severely underperformed ETH. I think Aave from the top is down 80% against ETH or something crazy. And I pick Aave because that's, you know, quote unquote blue chip. Nothing to say of the project.
00:09:38.872 - 00:10:14.920, Speaker A: Right. The project is awesome. Just the token price has suffered majorly across, like, all of these assets, not just Aave, but a lot of the different DeFi assets. So that was definitely a big thing that people got wrong in 2021. And people are betting now that 2022 DeFi is going to kind of have a renaissance, and there's going to be lots of people bidding it up because it's just so undervalued. I actually think that there will be some of that, but it's going to be very hard to pick a winner because there's so many assets in crypto now, not just on Ethereum, but on other blockchains, that. That it just becomes so incredibly hard for an investor to kind of, like, put their money in something and have conviction on it.
00:10:14.920 - 00:11:04.744, Speaker A: Like, for example, if you are completely new to crypto, you come in, you're like, okay, well, I want to invest in something. And then you kind of. How, how are you going to evaluate that? Like, what do, what do you use? You, like, for traditional investors, you typically use price to sales, price to earnings ratios, which DeFi has a lot of. You can go to token terminals, website, and you can actually see all the DeFi coins measured against each other. Um, and then there's other things. Kind of like, if you're a meme based investor, which a lot of people are these days, thanks to Wall street bets, you would kind of, like, place a bet on what the, what the thing is that you believe to be, like, have the best memes or kind of like, have the best attention and will continue to have the best attention or the most attention going into 2022. Um, but other than that, uh, it's very, very hard to pick something to, to invest in, especially with all the information asymmetry that exists within crypto, all the misinformation, everyone's shilling their own bags, everyone trying to justify things.
00:11:04.744 - 00:11:53.000, Speaker A: I mean, the amount of things that people kind of like Shield through 2021 that went nowhere because it's just like no one bought into. It was crazy. And speaking of kind of like a meme based investing, I think another thing in 2021 that played out was the dog tokens, right? Not just the dog tokens is the theme, but really the rise of kind of like, meme based investing wasn't just sorry, it wasn't just kind of, like, limited to crypto. It also happened in the traditional markets with uh, with GME and kind of like a few other, a few other stocks out there, but then it translated into crypto with dogecoin and Shiba and a few others out there like safemoon and stuff like that. That stuff happens typically like late stage of a market and it, and it basically preceded the massive dump in May. That's because everyone felt like really rich. There was a lot of funny money coming in, people had stimulus checks, all that sort of stuff there.
00:11:53.000 - 00:12:19.470, Speaker A: And that was all coming in. And that lead to the, led to this kind of like meme based pumping going on in many different tokens. That was another big thing of, of 2021. Now, I think that covers most things in terms of like the higher level themes. Maybe I'm forgetting things. I think, like daos have definitely come further in 2021 than they were last year, but they still got a long way to go. Social tokens had a little bit of attention, but they've still got further to go.
00:12:19.470 - 00:13:08.478, Speaker A: I think Altoo was obviously a big theme, actually. How can I forget about Altoos? I think Altoos was a huge theme of this year, but only in probably the latter half of the year, not so much the former half. I think, you know, albatrum going live, optimism going live after saying they were going to go live in March and then delaying until like July when uniswap v three went live on optimism and then not removing their whitelist until like two one to two weeks ago, I think it was. And then you had arbitrum going live too, but then like this and the ZK stuff obviously, you know, slowly coming out and none of the kind of like l two s have done tokens yet or anything like that. So it's been a bit of like a soft launch for these l two s, but they've still been a big theme. Like, I guess, like scalability in general has been a huge theme for Ethereum in 2021. It's been basically what everyone's been focused on due to the high gas fees.
00:13:08.478 - 00:13:36.610, Speaker A: And as I've said before, I think 2022 is going to be a really good year for L2. I think all these l two s are going to get tokens. I think they're going to do much better in the marketing and bd departments because of it. And there's going to be a lot more opportunities to make money on there. A lot more apps kind of get onboarded onto there, which is going to be really, really cool to see play out as well. And I think related to that, we also had the rise of Polygon. As you guys know, I'm an advisor to Polygon, not just trying to show my bags here, but Polygon pos chain Rose like really rapidly.
00:13:36.610 - 00:14:15.900, Speaker A: I mean, it's funny because Matic came from a position where it was known as this scaling thing, but no one really knew what they did, right, until they rebranded to Polygon. They were working on plasma. They've been around since like 2018, I believe, or maybe even earlier than that. Then they rebranded to Polygon. They spun up this pos chain and it basically acted as a nice, I mean, people call it sidechain, some people call it L2, but basically a nice environment for people to go in and experience the EVM without the high fees. And that's what really kind of like kickstarted all these other alternative l one s to kind of like copy Polygon's Playbook. Because they saw, okay, well, they did liquidity mining, they got all this kind of liquidity over and their token went absolutely bananas.
00:14:15.900 - 00:14:45.670, Speaker A: I mean, I think Matic's token price was something like two cent at the beginning of the year. Now it's like $2.50. So I think the L1's more so copied Polygon's playbook than DeFi summers playbook. But I think Defi summers playbook kind of like set the stage in terms of liquidity mining and, and all that sort of stuff for everything else to kind of like copy it from there. And it works as a really good kind of like tool. Right, because we've seen the rise of Polygon and obviously Polygon has done a lot more than that. They don't actually have native Matic rewards in any kind of like aggressive fashion anymore.
00:14:45.670 - 00:15:49.956, Speaker A: It's really just like their business development and their marketing and kind of like acquiring these other ZK teams and stuff like that, that has been really, really good for them. So that's, that was another big theme of 2021. And I think if I had to kind of like summarize the whole year, you know, taking into account all these high level themes, taking into account the price action, what the market's done in 2021, I would say that 2021 was the year that crypto basically jumped the chasm and we've jumped from basically this early stage nerdy technology that only a few people paid attention to, to the early kind of like adopters going on to mass adoption, which isn't, you know, here yet, but we're basically in the early adopter phase where this technology went from being, okay, well, maybe this will work. Out to, okay, you know, this is going to change the world. That's 2021 to me. Doesn't matter how many things people got wrong, how many things people got right, doesn't matter about all the other themes that I spoke about. What matters to me is, like, the overall kind of, I think, and the most important thing, and that, that that is the fact that we've kind of, like, not gone mainstream, but we've crossed over to the, to a point of no return where it's basically like, crypto is going to succeed.
00:15:49.956 - 00:16:32.278, Speaker A: A lot of people believe that, and there's no going back from there. So I had a lot of fun this year. I actually think 2020 was a better year for me than 2021. I mean, personally, I think 2021 was a bit more of a comedown year for me, especially in the second half where it was kind of like, okay, well, you know, I've come a long way in my journey within crypto. I made, I made all this money from investing in ETH early on, and then kind of like, I guess after ETH finished hitting its all time high and came back down, it's kind of felt like just, I've been cruising right. I've been kind of, like, doing the refill, still doing the newsletters, still keeping up with everything happening in the ecosystem. But I feel like we're in this kind of, like, holding pattern right now where it's kind of getting ready for the next leg up from here.
00:16:32.278 - 00:17:06.174, Speaker A: So, and not just in the market, but in terms of, like, adoption as well. And it feels like so many things are coming at once, and 2022 is going to be big, I think. And actually, now that I think about it as well, I just reminded myself another big theme of 2021, not the overall theme, but another big theme that I forgot to mention, by the way, I'm doing this all off the cuff. I haven't actually got any notes prepared for this. I'm literally just speaking as things come to me. So apologies if I, like, repeat myself or I forget things, but I'm just doing it because I feel like my videos are better when I just kind of, like, do it from stream of consciousness. But the other big theme was regulation.
00:17:06.174 - 00:17:43.930, Speaker A: There was the first time that crypto was on the kind of, like, world stage in terms of regulation, and that was no more clearer than it was around the infrastructure bill that happened in the US, where the crypto provisions were actually holding up the infrastructure bill from going forward. And we made ourselves known. We made our presence known. And this falls into my, my kind of like overall theme about how 2021 was the year that crypto kind of like crossed the point of no return. Where we've gone, haven't gone mainstream, but we've gone into kind of like the early adopter phase. We've gone in, you know, we've gone geopolitical, obviously, outside of the kind of like ethereum land. We had bitcoin with El Salvador, making it legal tender.
00:17:43.930 - 00:18:13.212, Speaker A: That was obviously a huge theme as well. But that I think fits into kind of like the government regulation, nation state stuff that's been going on all year. And there's been tons of regulatory talk. Obviously. They've been kind of like the SEC, you know, yelling at people, you know, yelling at teams, yelling at projects, just doing their, you know, the absolutely worst job ever, not protecting anyone. And then you had like the Congress kind of like debating the infrastructure bill and the crypto revisions, holding it up. So that's been a very, very big theme in 2021 as well.
00:18:13.212 - 00:18:46.662, Speaker A: And I expect that to continue to be a big theme. When you cross over the point of no return, when you go from being a little plaything that people can just ignore to people realizing that this isn't going away, that this is actually going to be a big deal, it's going to disrupt industries, it's going to change the world. You, you definitely are met with force, right? You're met with kind of like, um, resistance from the incumbents, and they are going to resist. They're going to resist harder than what they are now. They're going to be countries around the world. That's not that they probably won't ban crypto, but they're going to come down hard on it. They're going to do things like ban you from, or at least requiring KYC for you to withdraw crypto from an exchange to your address.
00:18:46.662 - 00:19:27.770, Speaker A: This was floated in the US, didn't pass, but I believe some other countries are in the process of implementing these policies. That's all coming. And that's why I've said before my two main kind of like things that I'm most interested within the crypto ecosystem in terms of like, investment opportunities, especially L2 technologies and privacy technologies. But I'm not so bullish on privacy technologies such as like Zcash or Monero, like standalone blockchains. I'm more bullish on privacy tech that built on a blockchain, like a smart contract blockchain like Ethereum that is able to kind of like enhance the experience, not be the sole product. I don't think, I don't think the privacy blockchains are going to accrue any long term value. We've already seen the price of Zec.
00:19:27.770 - 00:19:52.928, Speaker A: It's just done nothing. Manero I'm not even sure it is, but I'm sure it hasn't done much either. I think that there are privacy things you can invest in on Ethereum. There's a overlap between l two s and privacy as well, as I've discussed before. But I think that's going to become more and more prevalent as these regulations start ramping up, which, unfortunately, is the reality that we have to have to be met with. I mean, the Internet went through this, too. Like, you may think that a lot of the Internet kind of, like, just was adopted by everyone.
00:19:52.928 - 00:20:15.278, Speaker A: The governments were happy with it, and nothing, you know, nothing bad ever happened then. Nothing was ever kind of, like, banned or censored. But that's couldn't be further from the truth. There was a lot of clamping down on what you could do with the Internet. I mean, look at piracy, for example. Obviously, you know, pirating copyright materials is, is illegal, right? And, you know, you're literally breaking the law if you're doing that. But the way they went about regulating it was, was kind of crazy.
00:20:15.278 - 00:20:43.202, Speaker A: They, they literally started, like, banning these websites. Even if the websites didn't host the content, they just kind of, like, pointed to it. They would do that. And then there was the whole net neutrality thing in the US. And basically, there's a lot of kind of, like, censorship going on as well. And, I mean, craziness, especially around when Trump was president, on social media, like, people saying, you know, how can he say this? Like, this is ridiculous, like, it goes against your policies. And social media didn't want to ban, obviously ban the president, things like that because of the repercussions.
00:20:43.202 - 00:21:24.478, Speaker A: So there's a lot of stuff that's gone on with the Internet as well. And it's just natural for any technology that's, that allows people to do whatever they want with it. There's going to be pushback, there's going to be heavier regulation than otherwise, and there's going to be a lot of resistance. So I think that's what I'm going to be looking for going into 2022 as well, is that level of kind of, like, resistance that we're going to be facing, especially as regulations ramp up around the world? Not so much. Maybe the US, because the US is a very big place. They seem to be, I guess, like, okay, right now, I think we've got a few people in politics on our side at this point, which is, which is cool to see, but I think we're bribing the right people this way. It's bribing, sorry, sorry, I should say donating to the right people and lobbying.
00:21:24.478 - 00:21:57.680, Speaker A: Right. I think I'm seeing that play out there, but that's definitely going to be a big theme going into 2022, which, as I'm coming up on the 30 minutes mark here, I do want to segue into some of my not so much predictions for 2022, but more just an outlook of what I see happening and why. I think 2022 is going to be a super exciting year. So there's three main things I'm kind of like, looking forward to. One is I think the market is going to do kind of like, very well in 2022. I think that we've been kind of like, in this range of being. We've been especially, I mean, when it comes to ETH, I don't know about most other assets, but when it comes to ETH, I think it's going to do very well.
00:21:57.680 - 00:22:45.902, Speaker A: I think there's going to be a mania around l two s and the l two tokens. I think l two s are going to take off in a really big way in 2022. And I think that the merge is, as I've mentioned plenty of times before, going to lead to a very, very big narrative shift for Ethereum on multiple fronts. The first front is that we're going to have a deflationary ETH all the time, as long as the gray price is like ten or 20 gwei or something like that. Last time I worked it out, it's going to be more deflationary than bitcoin, which is going to be a narrative talking point, especially for normies and stuff like that. It's going to get Ethereum off proof of work and go into proof of stake, which is obviously a huge deal. It's going to significantly de risk Ethereum for the more traditional investors because they're going to be like, okay, well, this major upgrade is actually out of the way now, and it's done and it was successful, so, you know, but now it's safer to invest.
00:22:45.902 - 00:23:16.710, Speaker A: And, you know, that may seem crazy to you, but a lot of people think like this because they have to. I mean, there's a lot of traditional investors are regulated. They can't just, like, throw money into anything. They have to be careful about what they throw money into, and they have to weigh up all the risks, and that's how they size things. So it's going to be a significant de risking event there. Um, and, you know, I mentioned the l two s as another, uh, another thing there. And also I think that, um, towards the end of 2022, the, I'm hoping maybe, I don't think like, I'm hoping the narrative changes around ethereum scalability.
00:23:16.710 - 00:23:44.550, Speaker A: I mean, I'm hoping this happens in the first half of 2022, but I, I think in the second half, because I think the first half we're going to have a lot of these l two s doing tokens. There's going to be a lot of rapid growth of these l two s. Are people going to use them? A lot of people are going to be really happy with them and they're going to offer cheap fees. But then I actually think that we run the risk of them hitting their limits because a lot of these things are still very limited. They're not anywhere near their full capacity. They have training wheels on. A lot of them are still centralized.
00:23:44.550 - 00:24:41.796, Speaker A: And I think that's going to be a counter narrative to ethereum scalability because people are going to hit those limits and be like, what the hell? Like, I thought this was going to be cheaper. You know what, why is it kind of getting expensive again? Blah, blah, blah. Then I think what's going to happen is the l two s are going to basically take their limits off or take their training rules off or improve, and then the second half of 2022 will be, I think, like the steady state of people, like, okay, while Ethereum can scale now, a lot of the new users aren't going to be going into Ethereum l one. We're going to have lots of, we're going to hopefully have lots of centralized exchanges being, having bridges into these l two s, and that's all going to be well and good. So I really do think 2022 is going to be the year of the l two. L two. If it's not, I fear that ethereum, I mean, I think worst case scenario, if the l two s fail to gain traction in 2022, if people just aren't interested in using them, if they don't actually play it right, if they don't do the marketing right, they don't do the business development right, if they don't do tokens, I actually fear that Ethereum has a very real chance of losing its kind of like lead here.
00:24:41.796 - 00:25:07.188, Speaker A: I mean, it really does hinge. I know, I know. I'm not really kind of like a bearish on Ethereum in general, but I think that the alt two s. It's not enough just to, I mentioned this yesterday, it's not enough to just build it. Like you need to incentivize people to go there. Go look at literally any TVL chart for any chain. It spikes as soon as there's liquidity mining rewards to be had or as soon as there's token incentives there and it's obvious why people want to make money.
00:25:07.188 - 00:25:35.468, Speaker A: They're going to go there, they're going to make their money and there's going to be some sticky liquidity. It's the best marketing tool ever. A token is amazing. I mean, obviously there's the downside to a token when it's not performing amazingly. It can kind of like make your community sour. It can make people not want to obviously purchase it anymore and it can make your liquidity mining program not be as lucrative. But just generally, when a token is done right and people have skin in the game, when there are rewards to be had, when they can use the products, it's just the best marketing tool ever.
00:25:35.468 - 00:26:04.316, Speaker A: And as on flow of that, it's the best business development tool as well. So I really do think that if we don't get our ass into gear in 2022 in terms of like the l two s actually scaling ethereum, we stand a very real risk of kind of like completely losing the narrative. And people just kind of like getting sick of us saying, you know, the l two s are coming, they're coming and they're coming and then kind of like just using the other chains and kind of like ethereum losing its moat there. I think there's a very, very low chance of that happening. I think it's basically 0% chance. But that is the worst case scenario. And that's why I'm pushing so hard.
00:26:04.316 - 00:26:36.644, Speaker A: I keep pushing the l two teams, like trying to signal to them, do tokens, guys like, I know that you'd want to focus on building, but doing a token is part of building. Like that's what it is in crypto. It's not like if you're a company in the traditional space, like a non crypto space, and you wait like seven years to ipo, it's not like that. Because when you ipo, you're not doing liquidity mining for your products. It means, you know, if you go, if you get to an ipo, most of the time, your product has actually already got a lot of traction. And the reason you're ipoing is because you know, it's got a lot of traction and your investors like, oh, well, you know, it's time to go public, right. We want an exit.
00:26:36.644 - 00:26:54.044, Speaker A: Tokens are the, are a big part of the product within crypto. They're a big part of building. So, you know, don't think of it as kind of like a speculative vehicle. Don't think of it as just, oh, we have to do a token because our investors want us to do it, or because people want to, want to dj and speculate on it. They want to do that. Yes. And that's what a lot of crypto currently is.
00:26:54.044 - 00:27:12.282, Speaker A: But it's still the best marketing tool ever. It's the best way to build a community. It's the best way to get traction of things. So I really, really hope to see that play out into 2022, and I think it will. I mean, honestly, ZK sync arbitrum I'm sure. Optimism. They've all done the starkware.
00:27:12.282 - 00:27:25.074, Speaker A: They've done the series b's at this point. I think Starkware did a series C as well. I don't imagine them going much further than that. I think the tokens are coming. I think they're coming very, very soon. Zksyncted, that's coming very, very soon. As I said, three to six month.
00:27:25.074 - 00:27:44.550, Speaker A: I think they're all going to have a token. There's already some with tokens, right? Like Metis. Um, there's, uh, there's a few other kind of like forks out there, and there's obviously Polygon as well with Matic and stuff like that. And there's a bunch of other bridge tokens too. That's another thing. Going into 2022, I think, is going to be a big deal. Bridges, because of the fact that l two s, if, you know, when they take off, bridges are going to be even more important.
00:27:44.550 - 00:28:10.828, Speaker A: They're already pretty important, but they're going to, they're going to kind of like tag along for the ride as well. So that's another big thing going into 2022 as well. But, yeah, that's my thoughts, guys. I think, I think I'm coming up on time here. So that's my thoughts on kind of like just recapping briefly 2021, all the major themes, what I expect going into 2022. I really do think it's going to be a great year for Ethereum, the network, and ETH, the asset. I think that we're going to get to $10,000 at least in 2022.
00:28:10.828 - 00:28:46.816, Speaker A: I think we can go much further than that, but I think that's finally going to be the year where we finally gets the $10,000 that I've been kind of, like, calling for since, I think, early 2019. So it's going to be a good, like three years probably, since, since that's happened there. But I think the most important thing for Ethereum is getting that merge done. Obviously, that's going to be probably the biggest event of the year in terms of a singular, singular event for Ethereum. And I think the, the, obviously, the other biggest things are the l two stuff. But price, if price is going up, everything becomes a big, big deal. I'm sure you've all noticed that, like, whenever the price is going up of an asset, everything a chain does or anything an ecosystem does is amazing.
00:28:46.816 - 00:29:19.470, Speaker A: You can do no wrong. It's all good, guys. Like, everything's bullish, but then when the price is going down, it's kind of like the opposite thing there. And this was especially felt in, like, 2018 and 2019, where everyone was fighting because it was a bear market and everyone was, like, depressed and sad, and then the bull market came roaring back and everyone's like, oh, my God, like, this is awesome. Like, we have so much money. And then actually, I think the last six months has been back to basically what we were like in the bear market because sideways is probably the worst. I think sideways price action is worse than a bear market because at least in a bear market, you know that the price is going down and you know that that's probably going to continue like that for a while.
00:29:19.470 - 00:29:32.870, Speaker A: In a sideways market, you got no idea what's going on. You're like, oh, is it gonna go up now? Oh, no, no, it's going back down again. Oh, wait, no, it's going back up. Oh, wait. No, it's going down. It's just this constant kind of like, yo yo. And it just, it's really nauseating and it's really, really frustrating.
00:29:32.870 - 00:29:59.272, Speaker A: I think that's what leads to a lot of toxicity as well. People just get super frustrated and they take it out on whoever they can as well there. But, but, yeah, I think that's going to be it for this special episode of the refuel, the last one of the year. I hope all of you had a great 2021. I know a few of you have reached out before and said to me that you really enjoyed the, enjoy the refuel, really enjoy my newsletter, and that it's changed your lives, actually. So really humbled to hear that this young and obviously keep doing the refuel into 2022. No plans on stopping it there.
00:29:59.272 - 00:30:32.608, Speaker A: I'm gonna try and do more standalone videos, too. I really, really want to do more standalone videos because I still think that there's so much things out there that people have no idea about. I mean, people still think the merge is going to lower gas fees. I really, really want to kill that, that, um, that narrative before it kind of like bites us in the ass once the merge happens and fees don't go down because I can already picture it in my head the amount of FUD that there's going to be. Regardless of what, what anyone says, there's just going to be heaps of FUD that that happens after that, unfortunately. But I hope the l two s are in full swing by then so people don't even care that much at that point, but we'll have to see. But yeah, so I guess like Happy New year.
00:30:32.608 - 00:31:00.430, Speaker A: I'll see you all in the new year for a big 2022. Hope you guys have something fun planned for your news. Eve, I'm not sure what I am doing yet, but I'm definitely going to be taking some time tomorrow night just off, so there won't be a refuel tomorrow, obviously, or anything like that. There won't be a newsletter either, but there will be on Monday. So yeah. Thanks everyone for tuning in this year and I'll catch you all next year. Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet, give the video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord Channel, and I'll catch you all next year.
00:31:00.430 - 00:31:02.134, Speaker A: Thanks everyone. Bye.
