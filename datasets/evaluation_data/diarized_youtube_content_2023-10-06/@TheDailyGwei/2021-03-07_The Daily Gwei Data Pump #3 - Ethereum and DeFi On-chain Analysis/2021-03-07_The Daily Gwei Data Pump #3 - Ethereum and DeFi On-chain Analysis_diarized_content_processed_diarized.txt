00:00:00.600 - 00:00:32.510, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the third episode of the dailyguay data pump. In these episodes, I go through the various on chain metrics of both the Ethereum network and Defi as a whole and give an analysis on them. For today's episode, I'll be going through the month of February and everything that happened then, there's been a lot of growth. So let's get right into it. So let's start off with the price action for February. So I've got the four hour chart open here, and right on the left hand side of the screen here, you can see that we started February at about, it was like $1,300, and February was a very big month for its price. Right.
00:00:32.510 - 00:01:03.078, Speaker A: We went all the way up to 20, $40 on February 20. And then, of course, we had that massive kind of dump towards the end of the month and kind of, like, basically ended the month essentially where we started. I think we went to 1291. So just under where we started the month at. So very interesting, right? We had such a huge price move and then just erased all those gains within a few days. And it kind of just looks like a massive, I guess, not really a head and shoulders pattern, but just like a really kind of massive, just mountain. Right.
00:01:03.078 - 00:01:17.926, Speaker A: That we've kind of come down on now. It's interesting because we've started moving back up in March. Of course. I think March generally is going to be a pretty good month for Ethereum and everything like that. But, yeah, I'm not sure what happened with February. Right. I mean, we were pretty healthy up until then.
00:01:17.926 - 00:01:52.458, Speaker A: I mean, if we scroll out even more, we can kind of see that ETH was just like kind of bunny hopping up, right, all the way back in kind of like January here, you know, up. And then we had, like, a bit of a crash here, but it wasn't like, I guess, like, you know, it wasn't like, as bad as kind of what happened here. Right, where we erased all of February's gains. This crash here came, like, only a few days after, and then we kind of, like, recovered in January. So, yeah, you know, you can see the bunny hop, and then the bunny hop, and then the bunny hop, and then we just kept going up and up, and then, you know, obviously we can't go up forever, but just a bit of a weird kind of thing that happened. Here we go. Kind of kind of erased all of February's gains here.
00:01:52.458 - 00:02:21.656, Speaker A: Right. You know, and then came down again and just erased further gains as well. And we've started going back up which is really positive. But yeah, not, don't want to talk too much about the price, but I think it's good to contextualize it because the price action is very closely tied to the different on chain kind of action, especially like gas fees and stuff like that. Like if the market's more volatile, there's going to be more activity on the network, there's going to be more gas fees, there's going to be more defi activity. So we're going to see that kind of play out in all these metrics. That February was a really, really big month across various metrics.
00:02:21.656 - 00:02:57.860, Speaker A: So, you know, let's jump into the metrics. So I kind of show this chart on, on every data pump episode, and it's basically the number of addresses holding with a balance of more than 10,000 ETH, right. And it's been growing since, as I mentioned on last, on kind of last episode since October, it's been growing pretty quickly. And, you know, I think it grew from about 1000 and kind of like 27 addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH to 1127. So about 100 new kind of whale addresses here. Now, you can see here that, I mean, this is in March, but like, it's come down a little bit. But for all of February, it kind of like just went straight up.
00:02:57.860 - 00:03:31.904, Speaker A: Right? I mean, you can see here we started at about, I guess you could say 1100, and then we went right out to 1128. So that's another, you know, 28 addresses holding 10,000 ETH each. So it's almost 300,000 kind of ETH moved into these new addresses here. But as you can see here, we've come down a little bit, and that's only natural with the price going down, I think we've lost about maybe six or seven or eight kind of like addresses here. So that, of holding 10,000 ETH or more. That doesn't mean that necessarily that they sold their ETH or it went to exchanges or anything. And I'll actually show exchanges exchange balances in a bit because that's, um, that's pretty important to look at as well.
00:03:31.904 - 00:04:05.324, Speaker A: But yeah, it does show that the, the kind of like, I guess, parabolic growth kind of like broke a little bit here. We did have some downtrends a little bit here, but nothing as kind of like steep as we've seen here since, I guess, like even here back in December. It's, it's, it's a bit steeper than that. Or it seems to be a bit steeper than that. But I don't think there's anything to worry about here. I think, you know, the market's still quite strong going into March, and I think, you know, whales are still basically accumulating at this point, I think. So I'm curious to see what this is going to be like, kind of like at the end of this month, but we'll have to kind of wait and see there.
00:04:05.324 - 00:04:21.538, Speaker A: So next metric is the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network. So this is basically the last year's worth of active addresses. And, you know, it's kind of followed the price. Right. It's like Bunny hopped up with the price. Obviously. You know, whenever the price has, like a downside movement, there's going to be less activity on the network.
00:04:21.538 - 00:04:50.882, Speaker A: And that's kind of what we saw back here. Right. I mean, August, September last year wasn't great for the price, and then we kind of had the activity coming, kind of coming down here. But what's really curious is that it seems like the number of active addresses was basically a leading indicator here because the price didn't start dropping until the number of active addresses had already dropped by a fair bit. So the blue line actually shows the number of active addresses. So you can, and the gray line shows the price. So you can actually see as I'm scrolling down, the blue line fell like pretty rapidly.
00:04:50.882 - 00:05:23.004, Speaker A: Right. And then the price kind of like actually went, went sideways and then up, but then it came back down. So you could say that the active addresses here kind of acted as a bit of a leading indicator and. But that's not always the case because as you can see here, there's kind of like these just, I guess you can call them bunny hills or steps where, you know, the price is just like going up pretty slowly and the active addresses are just like up and down, up and down, up and down. And then obviously, you know, you have a big spike when the price goes up. But yeah, this metric in general, I just look at for overall health of the network. I don't really use it as a trading signal or anything like that because it's just, it's, it's kind of noisy.
00:05:23.004 - 00:05:52.686, Speaker A: Right. And there are a lot of things that can happen on the Ethereum network that have nothing to do with ETH's price movement. So there could be some new, you know, hot new defi thing that everyone wants, wants to get in on. You know, for example, there could be the uni airdrop where lots of people were kind of like claiming that, but they weren't exactly buying ETH or anything. So it didn't really affect, you know, the ETH price, for example. So that's why this metric, I think, isn't probably as relevant for Ethereum as it is for something like bitcoin, but it still, you know, shows overall health. And if we scroll out to, like the, the all time kind of chart here, the trend is really just up.
00:05:52.686 - 00:06:14.634, Speaker A: It doesn't matter about like these zigzags here. The trend is really continuing up here. And obviously, as you would expect with the price going down over the past couple of weeks, you know, the active addresses have come down a bit, but it doesn't seem like that's like directly correlated. But, yeah, we'll have to see from there. But I think that it wasn't just ETH that went down. Right. There's a lot of defi activity, too, a lot of defi tokens.
00:06:14.634 - 00:06:50.776, Speaker A: Volumes are down a bit. Market is picking back up now. But yeah, towards the end of February there, the market got pretty spooked by such a large drop. I think ETH dropped like 35% or something like that from kind of local top to bottom there, which was a pretty steep drop normally in a bull market, but, but pretty steep for people who had just seen it going up for the last few months. So definitely a metric that I like to keep track of, but not something that I use it as an active trading signal. So Ethereum's grayscale inflow. So for those who don't know, grayscale runs a bunch of different funds where basically people can buy into these funds and get taxes kind of advantages for doing so.
00:06:50.776 - 00:07:11.888, Speaker A: They had a very, very big February, as you can see here. They had a ton of inflows, right, coming into the fund. But then the inflows kind of like tapered off. Right. Just about when the price came down because you can see the kind of like price in the, in the gray. So, you know, it tapered off, like maybe, I guess, like three, four, four days before the price really went down. Right.
00:07:11.888 - 00:07:31.144, Speaker A: Was that a leading indicator? Maybe? I don't know. I don't think there's enough data here to kind of like, tell. But that is definitely interesting to see. And as you can see, the, the inflows have actually gone down completely. Right. There's only about, I think, 500 ETH going in a day now when at peak it was about 15,000 or more ETH going in. So quite a drastic change there.
00:07:31.144 - 00:07:59.752, Speaker A: And because of this, there's actually a thing called the premium on the ETH. Fund and the GBTC grayscale fund where they were trading at like a massive premium because there was so much demand through the product and there's no kind of like redemption function and there's like lock in on these, all these funds. So there was no way to close that kind of um, I guess like premium until a certain amount of time. I think for six months you have to wait for ETH, twelve months for, for bitcoin. Um, but because of that, the premium got away. But it's actually trading at a discount now. So there's no premium.
00:07:59.752 - 00:08:36.660, Speaker A: I think GBTC is trading at like a 10% discount to BTC spot price. Uh, so if you were to go buy GPTC, you'd buy it at a 10% discount to what BTC is actually trading at on market. So I think that's the, the biggest kind of um, discount in history there. And it makes sense because, you know, the BTC inflows looks the same as the ETH inflows here. And you know, the market kind of like, I guess people get spooked, right? Like especially a lot. A lot of people buying this product are basically not really into crypto, I would, I would assume right there they're definitely more just like trying to get exposure to ETH because they heard about it or something like that. So they definitely will get spooked by such a large kind of drawdown.
00:08:36.660 - 00:09:10.302, Speaker A: I mean, 2000 to 1300 in a matter of like a few days. I think it was like a week is a steep drop. And you know, I think that scared a little bit of people off. But I think as we keep having this positive price movement that we've been seeing, we're probably going to see these inflows tick up again. So pretty interesting thing to watch. But you know, there's also, and I'll go through this in a sec, there's also a kind of an ETF that got spun up as well where not, not, I don't. I think it's one for ETH, but more so for bitcoin, where the bitcoin ETF's is actually a better product to get tax advantage exposure to bitcoin.
00:09:10.302 - 00:09:41.800, Speaker A: And I think I've got it up here. Yeah, you can see here, this is an ETF not in the US, it's in Canada where, you know, it only launched basically on the 25th of Feb. Right. And you can see here that the inflows for, for grayscale here, kind of like really kind of, I guess like just before that, not, you know, maybe a few days before that ETF launch. But since then, you know, it's kind of been on a downtrend here. So, you know, that's interesting to see. And if we go to bitcoin, actually, we can see their, their flows, right? I mean, you know, this, this tapered off, like earlier than ETH did, for example.
00:09:41.800 - 00:10:10.060, Speaker A: But still, could the ETF be playing a part here? Because this ETF is extremely popular. You can see here how many kind of bitcoins it's sucking up. I mean, that's like 10,000 on March 5 here, or 11,000 BTC in just one day on this ETF because it's a better vehicle than the grayscale funds. And I think that might be also affecting the inflows into grayscale here. So again, Grace, these ETF's are canadian. They're not us EtF's. But I feel like an ETF in the US is coming, like, very soon.
00:10:10.060 - 00:10:51.348, Speaker A: It's. It's just so weird that that doesn't exist yet, especially for something like bitcoin. I feel like bitcoin will get, you know, a bunch of them first, then it's going to be shortly after. But at this point, the US is lagging and they need to do it right. They've gotten to a point now where they're actually a king maker that the SEC of approving because there's so many different companies that want to have their ETF approved, and there's so much demand for it that whatever company gets there's approved is going to have, like, massive inflows. So I think they're going to approve a bunch of them at once, and then we're going to see ETH ones approved as well. And that's just going to be like a huge thing because there is really, like, potentially hundreds of billions of, you know, fresh capital waiting to come into these, these products that may not go into Grayscale's kind of funds anymore.
00:10:51.348 - 00:11:15.290, Speaker A: So gonna have to see how that plays out. You know, maybe it's not bearish that grayscale isn't getting inflows because it's going into these ETF's instead. We'll see. We'll see how that plays out over the next, I guess, like month or so. So this is another metric that I've been keeping an eye on. It's called the net unrealized profit, slash lost, or an shortened as a nuple. What this basically measures is how much of, I guess, like the network is in profit.
00:11:15.290 - 00:11:40.066, Speaker A: So how many ETH holders are in profit and by how much. Now, you can see here we're basically in the green zone right now. You know, if you're in the blue zone, you're basically. It's basically saying that, like, the, you know, so many of the ETH holders are in so much profit right now, they've made so much money that it's getting, like, really overheated. And they kind of, like, call this the euphoria slash greed stage. So, yeah, we're not there just yet. We're just in the green.
00:11:40.066 - 00:12:13.804, Speaker A: We're trending up towards the blue. But because we had that kind of, like, downturn, we've kind of gone down here. And if I zoom into just like the last year, you can kind of see it, you know, better here. Now, if this goes into the blue, I would expect us to, you know, we can stay there for quite a while. I mean, as you can see, in 2017, you know, we stayed in the blue here from April of 2017 until basically July of 2017, where we stayed in the blue. And, you know, during that time, ETH had, like, a kind of, like, pretty wild swing here. I mean, it went from $50 to 420.
00:12:13.804 - 00:12:41.904, Speaker A: I think it peaked at, and then it came back down into 240 before going back into the green. Now, I'm not saying that you should sell every time it goes into the blue, but every time it has gone into the blue, it is a pretty good signal that the market is extremely overheated. A lot of people have made a lot of money, and it's a high chance that these people are going to be cashing out. Right. This is the way it goes. And you can see here it works both ways. I mean, the red is basically, I guess, like the, you know how many people have basically underwater, essentially.
00:12:41.904 - 00:13:10.010, Speaker A: And you know how many people would be selling at a loss if they sold. Now, usually this is, you know, where you want to buy, right, because you're. But you're basically buying the blood, which is always a good kind of time, as you can see. You know, in the long run, it pays off. Like, maybe you bought kind of like down here, you know, when this was basically the end of the, not the end of the bear market, but this is the first time ETH went to, like, $80. And then you can see that was really kind of, like, extreme. And if you bought there, ETH didn't really revisit kind of like $80 until black Thursday.
00:13:10.010 - 00:13:37.224, Speaker A: And, and even then, it was like a blip. And I think it only got to, like, $90. So you know, buying down here was like the buy of a lifetime for ETH. And that's when, you know, this metric was basically showing so much of the network was underwater here that they're probably just not even going to cut their losses anymore. They're just going to not sell, which is a pretty good kind of, like, metric there. But generally over the last kind of like, I guess February was basically all green. You know, we almost headed into blue, but, you know, we had a cool down before we did that.
00:13:37.224 - 00:13:53.440, Speaker A: And I'm curious to see if that actually happened at any point in the past. It did. It didn't really. Like when we were in the green in the past. In 2017, we actually went into the blue. And I think that's because ETH had such a rapid price rise. Right? Like, if you see the beginning of 2017, eight was about $10.
00:13:53.440 - 00:14:06.376, Speaker A: And then, you know, by the time I got to the blue, it was $50. So that was a five x. This measures based on not on price, but based on, like, gains. So that's a five x for anyone who's held since January. In March. Right. That's over just two or three months.
00:14:06.376 - 00:15:01.256, Speaker A: You had a five times your money, whereas this green started in November of 20, of 2020, ETH was about, you know, say, 550 and then peaked at, like, you know, kind of like, I guess, 2000, which is kind of less than a four times. So not as drastic of a move. Like all pretty much, you know, still a pretty, pretty good move, but not enough to push us into the blue zone still, though, like, you know, in green, like, as you, as you can see here, like, sometimes green can, like, kind of go sideways for a bit and then kind of like, you know, go into the blue and then dump down. Yeah, it's just funny that we kind of didn't go into the blue here, but I guess we didn't move up fast enough for this kind of metric to show that. And also, it doesn't mean, as I said, because it measures kind of how many people are in profit and by how much. I think a lot of people got blindsided by each move towards kind of the end of December here. I think what ended up happening is a lot of people bought in around here, right the end of December because, you know, BTC was, was going up and ETH.
00:15:01.256 - 00:15:29.814, Speaker A: BTC was bleeding and not, and many people were underexposed to kind of like ETH. So I think what happened is that a lot of people jumped in here at around the $700 mark. And that's why we didn't go into blue because 700 to 2000 is only, you know, about a three x. Right. So if we went to something like 3000, then I fully expect even 2500, I fully expect that this would have started going into the blue and we would have been like really overheated. But it's actually really healthy that we didn't. It's healthy that we stayed in the green because we're in a, in a relatively safe zone.
00:15:29.814 - 00:15:58.860, Speaker A: You know, ideally you want to stay in the kind of yellow if you, if you want like a healthy, healthy price, right, where we just like slowly grind up. But markets don't work like that. But, yeah, this is one of my favorite metrics to watch. Not so much as a, you should sell right now when it goes into the blue because as I said, it can stay in the blue for a while because it stayed in the blue from like, you know, April to June here sort of thing, or at least like even to like July. Whereas, you know, sometimes doesn't stay that long. Right. Sometimes it's only about a month or so.
00:15:58.860 - 00:16:28.682, Speaker A: You know, it's just hard. So I guess, like any time in the green or even in the kind of like in the blues is probably like an ideal time to take some profits based on the risk metric. But again, you know, it can go another two or three times and still be kind of like in the blue and still not be the market top. So you always have to be comfortable with that. I actually prefer this metric for just buying kind of like, I guess market bottoms. Like, I loved buying in the red here, basically. You know, this was like the $100 to $200 mark is where the red was.
00:16:28.682 - 00:17:07.608, Speaker A: That was the best time to buy ETH, like hands down. And you had so long to do that, right? You had like multiple times during 2018, 2019 to buy there. And now you're sitting on like a, I mean, at this price, what is it, $1700 right now you're sitting on like an, kind of like over an eight x from, from 200 here. And then if you bought it like the, you're sitting on a 17 x, which is crazy returns for, for kind of like a year or even less than a year here. So, yeah, I don't really like to use these for bull markets because bull markets are just way too frothy and, you know, it can go like so much higher than what you think it can. And kind of like bear markets is, you know, a lot of the bear market just seems to be ranging. Right.
00:17:07.608 - 00:17:35.326, Speaker A: Bull markets don't really kind of like do this range. They kind of like do way more violent moves where they go up really quickly, then dump 30% and then keep going up, right. You just, you just don't know. So generally, this metric I like to just look at in more of a kind of bear market context, but still a very good metric. I'll have this all linked in the YouTube description, by the way, so you can go check them out for yourself. You can sort the moving averages, right, by like zero days here. I mean, if you sort by zero days, you can see that we like, literally almost got into the blue.
00:17:35.326 - 00:18:15.814, Speaker A: And then if you sort by like, kind of like the 90 day moving average, right. It's just like, it gives you a smoother picture, but it's, it's more of a long term kind of outlook, not a short term. But you can go play with all this. It'll be linked in the YouTube description. So as I said before, we'd be looking at the kind of exchange balances for ETH now. Now this is basically, I guess, like you can see since kind of like August last year, it's kind of been going down, like really, really rapidly, right? If we were to just kind of like Zoom in more and maybe take January to, to march here, we can see that January, you know, I think it started off at 20, maybe 22,000,022.3 million ETH and then down to about like 20.9.
00:18:15.814 - 00:18:36.274, Speaker A: So, you know, about 1.3 million ETH kind of came out of exchanges here. Basically came out of exchange reserves. And this is all exchange wallets, I think, including cold wallets, which is pretty healthy. Right. And then, and then if we can kind of like, I guess, like Zoom back out, we can kind of like, see. How do I zoom out here? I think you have to kind of like reset the chart somewhere here.
00:18:36.274 - 00:19:04.332, Speaker A: Oh, man. This isn't very intuitive right now. Oh, well, I'll just refresh the page. Maybe that's easier. But, um, yeah, I mean, this is just really healthy to see all the kind of like, I guess, like reserves coming out of exchanges. I mean, this is, as I said, measuring kind of cold wallets as well. I think glass node kind of has like a metric for this, too, where you go exchange balance kind of like percentage here, which I think just counts, like maybe hot wallets too.
00:19:04.332 - 00:19:36.600, Speaker A: You can see this has been coming down as well, right, during kind of like the later months of last year and like recently, and it's still going down, I think, you know, 13.8% of all, almost 14% of all ETH. Is probably, but it's probably about the same, actually, 2020 something million ETH. But I think I like the percentage better because it kind of gives you a better picture that it's only 14% of all ETH on exchanges, whereas, you know, there's a, there's Ethel in a lot of other places, rather, Ethan defy. There's Ethan kind of, like, in ETH two. There's. There's ETH in people's wallets just holding it there.
00:19:36.600 - 00:20:02.372, Speaker A: I mean, there's ETH everywhere right now. And, you know, especially in Defi, there's Ethan, like, liquidity pools as uses collateral. So, yeah, I think it's just really cool to see, you know, eat coming off centralized exchanges and going into other places because it's very healthy for, I guess, the decentralization of the network. Right. But, yeah, really cool metric to kind of keep a, keep an eye on here as well. So the block has a bunch of different metrics. And, you know, I actually just want to have a look at all of them today on all of them.
00:20:02.372 - 00:20:31.664, Speaker A: But, like, go over, like, an overview of, of what they have here. And this is cool because a lot of these data is actually normally behind a paywall, but the block is kind of offering it to people for free here. So you can see kind of like the, you know, metrics, like the transactions on the Ethereum network, but, like, that sort of stuff's usually given for free. There's a kind of a couple of deeper metrics here, like, adjusted on chain volume, which absolutely exploded. And this is just ETH. This isn't, this isn't including, like, all the tokens. So this is basically just ETH moving on chain.
00:20:31.664 - 00:21:03.240, Speaker A: And you can see that February was a record month where $271 billion worth of ETH moved on chain. And this, you know, basically dwarfs what we saw at the top of the last market in January of 2018, when it was $152 billion. And what's even more impressive about this is that, you know, back in January of 2018, we didn't have stable coins on the market, which take up a lot of the, the on chain kind of volume here. So to see that ETH is just, like, still being used very strongly here is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. So there's that metric. Obviously, minor revenue is.
00:21:03.240 - 00:21:19.014, Speaker A: Was huge in February, as you can see here on this chart. Like, they made a crap ton from fees. I think they made more in fees than they did from the block reward for what it looks like. Yeah, they did. They made $644 million from the block. Reward and $722 million from the fees. Absolutely insane.
00:21:19.014 - 00:21:50.072, Speaker A: And you can see why miners don't want EIP 1559 to come in, which is funny because, you know, and I'll talk about this a little bit later, actually, I'll leave a discussion till I talk about, like, the gas prices and how that plays into this. But still funny to see that, you know, the ethereum kind of hash rate is at an all time high here. Almost 400 tera hashes. You know, that's like, I think, pretty much almost double the last bull market, which is. Which is some incredible growth there. You know, you scroll down here, you can go. To go the hash rate by pool, you know, is obviously, there's a bunch of different pools that dominate here.
00:21:50.072 - 00:22:12.788, Speaker A: Spark pool, ether mine. And I think, what's this pool here? The blue one? It's just others. Yeah, they kind of, like, dominate the network here. We scroll down a bit more. You know, you can see the transaction fees obviously, were very big in February. Have come down lately because the market kind of actions down. And they also have a metric for, like, ethereum addresses with balance over dollar amount.
00:22:12.788 - 00:22:28.164, Speaker A: So this metric, I think I went through it kind of like, last. On the last episode. But basically, you can see that there's over, you know, 1000. There's over 1.6 million addresses with over $1,000 in them, which is. Which is really cool. And you can see how much this is spiked.
00:22:28.164 - 00:22:50.284, Speaker A: I think this is a function of having, you know, to have ethan, your wallet for gas fees, though, because if the gas fees are really high, you know, maybe after, like, 20 or 30 transactions, you've spent thousand dollars. Right. So I think that's a big reason why. But also the fact that the ETH price went up too, right. Is correlated to that. And you can see the percentage of the ETH supply that's active here. So, you know, the basically shows like that.
00:22:50.284 - 00:23:10.160, Speaker A: I mean, the five year thing is pretty cool. Like, you can see that, you know, for five years. Um, I think 3.3% of the supplier hasn't been active for more than five years, which is. Which is pretty crazy, right? Five years. I mean, the ethereum networks only been around for six years. So I think that's like, you know, a lot of our original ICO addresses that didn't kind of claim their genesis kind of Ethan stuff like that.
00:23:10.160 - 00:23:37.746, Speaker A: But, yeah, you should go check out this. I mean, this isn't just, like, their blocks dashboard isn't just a theory. And they've got, like, obviously, bitcoin. They have defi stuff here. They have nfts. I mean, I think this NFT section is quite new. And, you know, actually, I was going to talk about NFT stuff, so I'm going to move this over here when I talk about the NFT volumes, because there's one more thing I wanted to talk about with regards to just Ethereum on chain, and that's basically this metric from into the block that measures Twitter sentiment, which I thought was pretty cool because it's not, obviously, the Ethereum network on chain.
00:23:37.746 - 00:24:09.144, Speaker A: It's just sentiment in general. And they kind of classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative, and they follow the price here. So as you can see here, during February, we were pretty heavy on the positive tweets. You know, there was about 33% positive, 63% neutral, and only 4% negative. But then as we moved throughout, I guess, like, the month and towards the end of the month. Right, you know, the positive tweets came down a little bit, and the negative tweets kind of, like, went up. So you can see here the positive tweets at, I guess, like, oh, God, even if you go, like, down, maybe, I think here.
00:24:09.144 - 00:24:36.400, Speaker A: I think this was, like, I guess, like the bottom, basically, or almost the bottom, actually. If we follow the price, we can go to the bottom. The negative tweets basically spiked up to, like, 6%, I think, around here, or over 6%. Positive tweets kind of dropped by about the same. And then, yeah, we've kind of, like, had a, I guess, like, a resurgence here as the price has been going up. So, yeah, it's funny because a lot of the tweets are classified as neutral, so you don't exactly know kind of like. And I don't know if you can use.
00:24:36.400 - 00:25:00.302, Speaker A: Use this as a trading signal, but it's just fun to see that, like, a lot of the tweets are positive here, and I'm curious to see how far back their data goes. Yeah, it actually goes back to, like, kind of 2019 here. And 2019 was a very neutral year for Ethan. You can see. Neutral was, like, the majority of the sentiment, because 2019, nothing kind of happened, faith. It started the year like, 130, ended the year at 130. So, you know, people weren't neither kind of, like, positive or negative on it.
00:25:00.302 - 00:25:38.032, Speaker A: They were just like, yeah, okay, eats a stable coin, right? But then towards the end of defy summer, we had, like, the, you know, I mean, like, coming into defi summer, we had kind of compound liquidity mine launch, and then all of that kind of stuff happened, and the positive tweets kind of, you know, exploded. Right. And then we've kind of been positive ever since. I think, you know, there are a lot of neutral tweets, of course, but, you know, overall positive here. So as I said, I wanted to talk about the NFT growth during the last month. So I think February really was the month of nfTs, right. You can see that over just, I guess this site shows just the volume over the last seven days, which, in which, you know, includes a bit of march, of course.
00:25:38.032 - 00:26:03.166, Speaker A: But basically over the last seven days, crypto punks did $14 million with a volume Sora, which is a, I think a collectible kind of like trading card game for like soccer. Did 6 million, super rare. Did 5.6, hash mask almost 5 million. I mean, this is just the last seven days. You can see all time volume. I mean, crypto punks has done $100 million worth of all time volume, 25 million from sorare, 25 million from super rare.
00:26:03.166 - 00:26:43.372, Speaker A: I mean, if I sort this actually here, you can see actually hash marks is down 52 million, decentraland 42 million. I mean, this is some good numbers here, right, just for nfts. And, and I think the block has more data here, you know, with the trade volume. I mean, look at this, like basically, I mean, NFTs weren't really a thing until recently, right? Look at, look at this trade volume in just January and February here. I mean, if we kind of like just go to the last three months, you can see that February was a breakout month where basically crypto punks and I guess like NBA top shot, I mean, this might be controversial, but I don't consider NBA top shot to really be an NFT. They're kind of like a centralized thing where you have to KYC and everything. To me, NBA top shots more like a digital collectible rather than NFT.
00:26:43.372 - 00:27:18.566, Speaker A: So I wouldn't really count it here. So if we remove kind of them from it and just look at like, you know, the rest of them, you can kind of see that the growth is still kind of amazing. And a lot of it was actually crypto punks, which is quite funny. And you can see the weekly kind of users of different NFT platforms, you know, again, excluding NBA top shot from here, you know, you have like kind of axie Infinity leading the charge here on a lot of it. But if we do include NBA top shot, I mean, you know, as I said, like there, it's very centralized, right? There's been withdrawal issues. You can't really do anything with it. It's not built on Ethereum, it's Kyc.
00:27:18.566 - 00:27:51.818, Speaker A: But this works, right, because centralization is easier than decentralization. Obviously, the NBA is extremely popular, so they've got, you know, a ton of users into kind of like this platform here. But again, I would, I just don't classify them as like a true NFT. And maybe that sounds like maximalist me thinking that NFTs can only live on Ethereum. That's not it. It's more about the fact that, like, if it's just like behind a centralized kind of, I guess, paywall, if it's like a, well, uh, not paywall, but like a centralized ecosystem, it's like a walled guard, and you can't withdraw your assets to and do whatever you want with them. It's not really in the spirit of nfTs.
00:27:51.818 - 00:28:06.106, Speaker A: Right. So, yeah, I wouldn't really count that, count that here. But, you know, taking, I mean, definitely they have the growth. Like, I'm not going to deny that. Right. But I think that they shouldn't be classified as nfts. But anyway, I mean, outside of that, everything else has been growing.
00:28:06.106 - 00:28:30.812, Speaker A: You know what's funny? Cryptokitties is still here in terms of like transaction volume and then the average price of a sale. I mean, crypto punks is definitely leading the charge. I mean, a lot of you would have seen the million dollar crypto punks, right, and stuff like that. And I think the floor on crypto punks is like 30,000 right now. I think it was like 50,000 at one point where kind of like the cheapest crypto punk is 30,000. So that's pretty crazy as well. But yeah, a big month for nfts here.
00:28:30.812 - 00:28:52.250, Speaker A: Big month for NFT platforms as well. Opensea did $5 million worth of sales in February, I think, like, oh, this was back in February 2. So even at the start of the month and think, wait, when was this? When did they post this? February 4. I don't know if they've got an update here. Maybe they do if I click through here. No, it doesn't look like it. But yeah, that was back at the beginning of February.
00:28:52.250 - 00:29:31.062, Speaker A: I think they've done a lot more than that at this point because opensea is a very, very great, very, very good platform full of like a lot of the trading activity going on. So, yeah, big month for nfTs. I think I'm gonna try and find some more like, metrics for NFTs for next data pump, the next data pump episode, because only recently have people, people started putting together stuff. I mean, this, the dashboard from the block is very new, I think. And they've kind of like backfilling data here, but still really cool kind of new, I guess, area to keep an eye on. So defi, of course, had a very big February as well. I mean, looking at the TVL growth you, we had, we started the month at, I think it was what, 20, 30 billion.
00:29:31.062 - 00:30:01.256, Speaker A: You know, we went all the way up to 45 billion came down because the price went down. And we're kind of at, you know, $40 billion now, in terms of ETH locked, that actually went up quite a bit. We had like 7.8 million ETH at the end of January, up to like, I guess, like the end of Feb was about 8.7. So almost a million more ETH went into Defi, which is really, really positive to see because if you go like the all time chart, we're still not all time high here. I think the all time high was about 9.7 or 9.8.
00:30:01.256 - 00:30:21.024, Speaker A: And I explained on last, I guess, the last refill episode that I think a lot of that ETH went into ETH two. Right. And I'll talk about ETH two in a bit. But basically, I think, you know, a lot of that stopped now. So people are going back into Defi with their ETH. TvL, of course, like a lot of platforms had a lot of growth. I mean, make a doubt especially had still had a lot of growth.
00:30:21.024 - 00:30:39.184, Speaker A: You can see here that since the beginning of Feb, they had 4.6 billion locked and now they have about .3 billion. So they've been a big beneficiary here. They peaked at like 7.16, you know, because a lot of their TVL is ETH. So, you know, as ETH goes down, they go down.
00:30:39.184 - 00:30:59.036, Speaker A: But in terms of ETH going into it, you know, it's still going up very fast. Right. The end of, I guess, like the beginning of Feb was 2.8 million ETH and then the kind of like end of Feb was 3 million. So, yeah, I mean, 2.83 million, that's like 300,000 ETH just going to make a Dow alone. So, yeah, been a beneficiary of that for sure.
00:30:59.036 - 00:31:22.876, Speaker A: The dye supply is of course, at all time high. Almost 3 billion Dai is supplied right now. A lot of that is drawn from ETH, Nick. See, $1.3 billion is coming from the ETH a vault. And then you have some coming from, I guess, like other things like bat, USDC, WBTC accounts for a lot counts for $250 million worth of Dai. You know, they've got a bunch of tokens here now.
00:31:22.876 - 00:31:38.422, Speaker A: I mean, you can just keep scrolling down and find them all on the, on the left hand side here. I think it's WBtC ETH link as well. $34 million with, from link. That's $27 million from. From Dai. Yeah. So I mean, maker is just like got growing.
00:31:38.422 - 00:32:18.942, Speaker A: I mean, it's funny because the MKR price is not really doing much, but the maker platform itself is just growing exponentially. The make a burn in terms of like the token, you can kind of see like the make a burn site where it basically shows you the kind of like the amount of MKR that's going to be burned and the MKR that has been burned based on the stability fees that are owed. So there's $60 million with a stability fees owed, which means that the annual maker burn right now will be 42,000 MkR. So 4%, or over 4% of the supply is going to be burned each year based on the stability fees that are owed to the system. So that's pretty crazy, right? I mean, that's, that's huge. That's. And the MKR price is doing not much.
00:32:18.942 - 00:33:02.292, Speaker A: So I think that the market doesn't really understand. MKR doesn't understand like how it's going to be valuable in the future. This is an investment advice, but I actually think MKR is one of those things that you can just buy and hold for like a while and it'll just go up slowly over time based on this buy pressure from the stability fees. But I think, you know, a lot of people in the ecosystem prefers the staking mechanism where you stake your tokens and you get like a dividend, whereas this is basically, instead of doing that, you know, the stability fees go and buy maker off the market and burn it. But yeah, I mean, it doesn't really do much to pump the price, but it's fundamentally pretty strong. So definitely keep an eye on that. So L2 had a really big month in February, especially loop ring, due to the high gas fees.
00:33:02.292 - 00:33:30.164, Speaker A: You can see here that I guess even just during January, they had a big month of liquidity flowing in. The loop ring wallet kind of sign ups was pretty good as well. You know, they had, I guess, like almost a thousand kind of signups here. You can see here, like all the metrics, I guess the total trading volume is going up to almost a billion. You can see the exchange balance for, for their looping v 3.6 obviously spiked up a lot during February. And you know, all their metrics are kind of like up and to the right here.
00:33:30.164 - 00:34:05.286, Speaker A: One metric that I really liked about loopering was something that Matt Feinstein posted here, that because they're a layer to exchange, they pay Ethereum's layer one for security. So basically this is the, the cost that's being paid to, to layer one. And you can see that it's in red and it's actually kind of like, I guess, being hidden by the green here. But that's all the kind of amount in USD that just lay, just loop rigs. Layer two is paying to aetherium to secure itself. And this is a lot of money, right? I mean, look, look at that. Like that's thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars in February being paid to, to the l one.
00:34:05.286 - 00:34:44.809, Speaker A: And that's all being paid by l two fee income as well. So very, very kind of healthy growth there and kind of like healthy security paid to loop ring because they're paying for it from, you know, the Ethereum main chain here. Speaking of decentralized exchanges, they had an absolutely massive February. If I scroll down here, you'll be able to see why that was. It was the record month for decentralized exchange volume at 75 billion. And I actually think that both January and February, if you add these up together, account for more volume than we saw in the total of 2020. Yeah, that's, that's crazy, right? Two months in 2021 account for more volume than the whole year of 2020, which is just absolutely insane growth here.
00:34:44.809 - 00:35:07.584, Speaker A: You do not see this growth anywhere else in the world right now. Not in fintech, not in tech startups. This is just absolutely incredible in crypto for growth here on dexs. I mean, and we're like firmly over the $1 billion of kind of like volume over 24 hours. Even in markets where it's quiet, it's still over a billion dollars here. I mean, we did over $11 billion over the last seven days. Right? Absolutely crazy growth.
00:35:07.584 - 00:35:53.784, Speaker A: And a lot of that's coming obviously from Uniswap, sushiswap curve zero x, you know, all of your favorites. And there's actually a new chart here that they added recently where it shows like how much volume is coming from aggregators and how much is coming from direct centralized exchanges. So aggregators are taking out about, I guess, like you could say maybe on average 20% of the pie with direct taking up 80%. I actually would have thought aggregators are more, but it seems a lot of people are just going directly to things like Uniswap and sushiswap instead of going to aggregators, which, which was surprising. But yeah, very big month for, for dexs here. So this dashboard shows the gas prices on the network over time. So as you can see, you know, gas prices, I mean if you scroll down here you'll be able to see you know, January, February kind of like they spiked up and were like pretty high during February but have come down lately.
00:35:53.784 - 00:36:29.796, Speaker A: And you know I'm sure you've all noticed how much the gas prices have come down like over 50% I think from their peaks here. And this also shows you like the gas limit of the network which is basically the block size, the median gas, you know, cumulative gas prices. I mean we all know, you know, the gas prices are very high right now. But for me it's just interesting to see kind of this chart here on the left, the medium gas price by day over the last 90 days. We had like obviously a big spike during February and then a really big spike when the price was coming down. And then you know we've kind of taped it off and the market's kind of gone quiet and the gas markets gone quiet as well. You can kind of see that play out here.
00:36:29.796 - 00:37:02.076, Speaker A: This is gasnow.org comma which is basically a site that shows you I guess the current gas price and they also have historical gas prices and like when the best time to get your transactions in. You know I think the, this is I guess march over the last week or so you know we're seeing seventies again. Like I can't remember the last time I saw seventies and I've been seeing sixties lately as well. This is for rapid if you just go to fast I think yeah rapid is like the fastest and fast is the second kind of fastest. You can see the sixties right? I mean that's, that's pretty crazy. After going through February where it was like consistently in the high 100s or 200s.
00:37:02.076 - 00:37:31.840, Speaker A: We've come down a bit here but this is really good because you can see, you know, what time in, I think this is in UTC time. That is best to kind of like put your transactions in. Obviously if you're sleeping it's not great. I think this is actually when the US is sleeping or at least the US and Europe are sleeping because that would make a lot of sense. And then you can see the worst times around here which is like peak times to get your transaction in. So something to keep an eye on for sure is this sort of stuff. But yeah interesting to see, the gas prices have come down.
00:37:31.840 - 00:38:06.702, Speaker A: And actually, I was talking about this before and I mentioned how I, how, like, the, the miners were kind of like, fighting back against the IP 1559, which was, which was approved last week for inclusion in a hard fork because they're saying their revenue is going to drop. And the, the biggest estimates I think I've seen, or at least the best estimates I've seen on how many fees are going to be burned with ERp 1559 is between 20 and 35%. And so that would burn 20 and 35% of current minor revenue. But they just got like a massive pay cut. Right. Because the gas fees went down by over 50%. So I don't hear them complaining about, like, the gas fees coming down.
00:38:06.702 - 00:38:32.524, Speaker A: Right. And this just goes to the core point that gas fees are very volatile. It's highly dependent on network activity, highly dependent on market activity. Now, hot the market is. So no one can really kind of tell what's going to happen. So fee kind of revenue is variable, and miners should just rely on the block reward, not the fees, because the fees are, you know, going to vary wildly from time to time, as we've seen. So that's just a very interesting thing to note as well.
00:38:32.524 - 00:38:59.382, Speaker A: But, yeah, definitely go check out this site. There's actually a chrome extension you can get as well that'll basically show you rapid, fast, you know, standard and slow prices for your transactions and will help you get your transactions into the next block a lot faster than just, like, trying to guess it, I guess, on your own. So this is, as I was saying, fees. This is the total transaction fees. And you can see they've come off a kind of cliff here. Right. I mean, if I zoom into like a year, I guess, or maybe like the last six months would be better.
00:38:59.382 - 00:39:15.046, Speaker A: Look at that. Right? The fees spiked to, I think, $32 million, you know, on, I guess, February 23 24th, which was like, when the ETH price was coming down a lot. Right. And then it's just kind of like falling off a cliff due to the market volatility going down. It's. It's more than half. Right.
00:39:15.046 - 00:39:28.922, Speaker A: It's more down more than 50% here. And that's, that's pretty crazy to see. Right. This is minor revenue, as I was just saying, getting half just based on market activity. So. Yeah, very interesting there. But, you know, we're still at kind of like all time kind of highs here.
00:39:28.922 - 00:39:45.766, Speaker A: I mean, this is, I think, a linear chart, so it looks a bit more pronounced. I wonder if I can actually change it to, like, a log chart. Actually, I can. Yeah. And I get rid of the price here, I think, as well. Yeah, it doesn't look as pronounced if you look at a. Look at it in log, because it's still up a lot and we're still near all time highs.
00:39:45.766 - 00:40:25.554, Speaker A: And I do expect the fees to go back up again when the market heats up again. So. Yeah, interesting kind of thing to keep an eye on here. So, ETH two. The funny thing happened with ETH two over the last week or so is that the validator queue emptied, which means that there's no more pending validators, which means that the ETH going to the deposit contract flatlined. So it seems that we've reached equilibrium where all the people who wanted to be ETH stakers in the current setup were, are ETH stakers. And now they're either waiting, the people who are on the sidelines, that are either waiting for centralized kind of solutions or decentralized solutions, like coinbase is staking and rocket pool and things like that, to stake the wreath.
00:40:25.554 - 00:40:42.396, Speaker A: And you can see here, I mean. Sorry, it's up here on this chart on the left here, you can see it flatlined. Right. There's just not much happening here. And also the AP, that means the APY at the current staked ETH is 8.5%, or around 8.5%. So all eight stakers are currently still earning 8.5%.
00:40:42.396 - 00:41:24.706, Speaker A: As more it comes in, obviously that'll go down, but it seems like we've flatlined until maybe Coinbase sets up their staking, and then we're probably going to see, like, a massive inflow. I guess I've kind of eaten to the staking contract here, but, yeah, fun, fun to kind of keep an eye on this, I think, you know, as we kind of, like, get these centralized kind of, like, solutions coming on board. And not just that, I think decentralized solutions like rocket pool, more of these staking services coming on board, there's going to be just more ETH going in. But I don't expect, like, anything major, you know, unless it's like a exchange like Coinbase, you know, I could see Coinbase putting in a million, million ETH at once. Right. You know, we'll have to see how that plays out. That'll obviously collapse the APY a bit, because if we go and add a million to 3.4
00:41:24.706 - 00:41:46.372, Speaker A: million ETH and go to 4.4 million, that'll be just 7.5% instead of 8.5%, you know, which isn't too bad. But, you know, you can imagine if we get to the point where like 10 million ETH is staked, it goes down to 4.9%. You know, that I mean, it depends on, on kind of like how much risk you want to take and how much gains you want, because you can get much more than that in Defi right now with your ETH. But, you know, Defi is riskier.
00:41:46.372 - 00:42:10.088, Speaker A: Usually have to take leverage to get that, so. Yeah, but interesting to see where it kind of like, I guess, like tapered out at. But I feel like we haven't seen the last of this, and I feel like we're going to see more ETH kind of come in over the coming days and weeks, so. Yeah, definitely keep an eye on that one.
