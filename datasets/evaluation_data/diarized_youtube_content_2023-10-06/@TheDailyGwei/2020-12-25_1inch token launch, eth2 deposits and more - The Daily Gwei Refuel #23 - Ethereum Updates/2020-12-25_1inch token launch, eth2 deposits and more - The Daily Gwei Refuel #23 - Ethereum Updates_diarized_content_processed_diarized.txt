00:00:00.440 - 00:00:21.286, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way Refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today is the 25 December 2020. Alright everyone, well, merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it. Today is of course Christmas for most of you. I am recording this basically at 11:00 p.m. My time. So my Christmas is over.
00:00:21.286 - 00:00:55.260, Speaker A: But I had a lot of fun, ate a lot of food, and also I got a Christmas present that I'm sure a lot of you got as well. The one inch token. It kind of went live today, and just like with the uniswap token, a few other ones like that, it was airdropped to people who use the protocol, and it wasn't like an airdrop that was only worth like $10 or something. It ended up being worth a lot. Right. Depending on how much you kind of use the protocol and depending on how many addresses you used it with, you could have ended up with a lot of these tokens. They're currently trading at, I think, a $4 billion fully diluted market cap.
00:00:55.260 - 00:01:23.654, Speaker A: So it is not negligible at all what you can get for these tokens. So yeah, I mean, outside of that, the one inch token has been a long time coming. People knew it was coming. They have their decentralized exchange called muni swap as well, where you could liquidity provide and you could earn even more tokens. So a few people did that. But even if you just kind of interacted with one inch, like did a few trades, I think if you did like one trade, you got a bit. If you did four trades, you got more.
00:01:23.654 - 00:02:11.086, Speaker A: And I think it was maybe based on volume as well of trading. So, yeah, I mean, from what I saw, there was over 10,000 wallets that basically got some one inch tokens, or have claimed it so far, I'm sure there's a bunch of others as well over time. So yeah, another one of these, I guess, universal basic token airdrops or whatever you want to call it, where basically like free money, right, for people here. So yeah, outside of that, I think that the one inch token model is actually quite, quite thought through. I actually think they did a really great job of breaking it down in this blog post here. I'm not going to go through it now, you can read, it will be in the show notes. But basically they've got an idea of why they created this token, what it's going to do outside of governance, how it's going to kind of have cash flows going to it.
00:02:11.086 - 00:02:56.114, Speaker A: Someone did an analysis and said that basically, even if there's like a tiny fee on the amount of volume that one inch is doing, there would be like $50 million going to token holders. So, yeah, it's not, not a negligible amount of fees. There's a bunch of other mechanisms that they've got in here that you can go in and read for yourself to check out as well. I did want to talk about, I guess, like this broader point and I guess this broader topic of projects, you know, that don't have tokens and that have live apps, then giving their tokens out to their users. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of this. I think it's really great. It's a really great way to reward your early users and encourage them to stay loyal users to you since you gave them free money, basically.
00:02:56.114 - 00:03:25.884, Speaker A: But I also think there's diminishing returns to this. Now, the first big project that we saw do this was obviously uniswap, right? And that was huge. That was probably the biggest thing that happened in crypto in a pretty long time. Even though we had Defi summer, I think that Uniswap Airdrop was just like that thing that, you know, touched so many different people because so many people had traded on Uniswap. And, you know, the valuation was really high. A lot of people had multiple addresses that they traded with. So they got even more than the 400 uni.
00:03:25.884 - 00:04:22.364, Speaker A: And, you know, Uni ended up trading at almost, I think, $10 at one point. So it's definitely a lot of money for a lot of people. More so than one inch. I think Uniswap has a ton more users, or at least ethereum addresses that touched it than one inch. And the thing about Uniswap's distribution is that it was unique and it was first right in that since Uniswap's kind of done their distribution, everyone's thinking to themselves, oh, well, what are the projects that don't have tokens yet? And now these projects are basically going to be giving tokens out. So how do we kind of like, game that? Or how do we, you know, make sure that we maximize our profits now with one inch, all you had to do was create like a bunch of Ethereum addresses and exchange and do some trades on through one inch, and you would have been eligible for these tokens. So, I mean, I think there's, that there would have been a, I mean, I wasn't like, smart enough to, or like, switched on enough or I didn't even think about this at the time to do this, I should have done this, but it was also not clear how one inch was going to do this distribution of their token.
00:04:22.364 - 00:04:51.096, Speaker A: So you were kind of stabbing in the dark, but, you know, creating multiple addresses, doing a bunch of trades. I think you have to do like a minimum of $20 trades or something like that. I think down here it says what it is. Yeah. So if you had done at least one trade before September 15, or at least four trades in total, or trades for a total of at least $20, you are eligible for tokens. Now, obviously, September 15 was a while ago. I think that might have even been before the Uniswap airdrop happened.
00:04:51.096 - 00:05:22.100, Speaker A: So maybe that's why I. That's why they did it that way, because then it's like less game able for people. So, yeah, I didn't even realize that that was the snapshot date there. So maybe what I was saying didn't isn't really relevant, I guess. But, you know, I mean, at the same time, not every protocol is going to have this luxury. There's going to be protocols that go out later with, with a token, and they're not going to be able to have a snapshot from. From basically September or before the uniswap kind of distribution went, because it's just, it's too far, too far back.
00:05:22.100 - 00:06:01.374, Speaker A: And a lot of people will have used their projects or their apps since then, and we'll miss out if they do that. So there's a bunch of projects now that, that people are kind of eyeing. You know, DyDx is one of them. If you go on Defi pulse, you can kind of see the list of which projects, you know, people even saying kind of like, set protocol. The one, the project I work for as well, because we don't have a token and it's just all speculation, right. You don't know if and when these projects are going to have tokens or if, you know, if they're even going to have a token and you don't know how they're going to distribute it. You just know that, you know, the trend seems to be that if you interact with one of these apps, you'll get some tokens.
00:06:01.374 - 00:06:50.508, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot more innovation that can be done on these distribution mechanisms as well. I think, you know, just giving them out to people who have used your protocol is fine and it's like, great for, like, broad reach, but I feel like there should be something else that people should have to do, to obtain these tokens as well, you know, obviously, as they're going to be doing a liquidity mining program. But I mean, we've seen this stuff before. I just, I just wish there was more innovation here in general. And it's not a knock on one inch or anything like that, or on uniswap or whatever, but I think that we have such a versatile network that we can do things with, that we should be innovating wherever we can. But obviously, the easy kind of solution is just to like, kind of scatter out these tokens, give them to people, let the markets form naturally. You know, you get a lot of free press for your, for your project.
00:06:50.508 - 00:07:25.770, Speaker A: So there's not really a negative to doing this. But I do hope other projects innovate this, innovate on this into the future, because I think there's a lot that can be done here, particularly with projects that kind of have been live for a long time and haven't launched a token yet. I think they have a lot more wiggle room than they assume that they do. And there's a few of them now. I mean, people even speculating, you know, about metamask having a token. I know I put a tweet out a couple weeks ago, or maybe a week ago at this point where I said that I think that it's a high chance that Metamask will issue a token. I mean, I do, like, within the next twelve months.
00:07:25.770 - 00:08:13.684, Speaker A: I do still think it's a high chance, but I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't happen. I mean, I think it's a high chance just because it just, it makes sense to me now that Metamask is generating revenue through their swap kind of a feature on, on the extension on the app as well. It makes sense if they want to decide decentralized, you know, the whole kind of thing out decentralized, the governance have like fee capture and like staking and all these sorts of things. But at the same time, Metamask can't easily distribute their token to their users because metamask doesn't actually know which addresses are metamask addresses and which are normal ethereum addresses. There's no distinction there. So people are speculating on how they're going to do their distribution, right. They can't really do it based on, I guess, you know, how many transactions that you've done with that address through metamask.
00:08:13.684 - 00:08:58.048, Speaker A: Maybe there's a way to have it, like, so that people can submit their addresses in some way, and then it can, and then metamask, via the extension, can verify that that address has done all these transactions through metamask. I think that's a way. But also, you know, you'd have to kind of, like, make sure there's no way to game that. And it might be complicated. I don't know the technical details here, but I do know that if they wanted to, do, you know, a distribution similar to Uniswap in one inch, they would have to go a lot, a lot further to make it sure it's fair and make sure that they actually account for the right things. Because there's not, like, as I explained, there's no way to basically tell what a metamask address is and what a normal address is, you know, and outside of that, there's other big projects. I think, like, you know, even people speculating about infuria.
00:08:58.048 - 00:09:36.052, Speaker A: Right? Is infuria going to do a token? Are they going to basically do what the graph did and have, like, a tokenized network for infrastructure provider maybe? You know, you know, we've all used infura, but again, right. Do you basically just say, okay, every ethereum address that is interacted with every app that has used infura, we're going to give them tokens. Right? And that's why I say that I think we need more innovative ways to send tokens to people when. When these. When these kind of apps create tokens. And that's not to say that I. That metamask or infuria will necessarily create one, but if they do, I feel like they're best positioned to do an innovative kind of airdrop rather than just, you know, I guess what we've seen in the past.
00:09:36.052 - 00:10:05.284, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm looking forward to that, to see if that kind of plays out. But back on the topic of one inch in particular, there's a few stats here out of Nansen. They've got a nice dashboard on their pro version here. So if you can see the screen here and you can see the screenshot, basically, someone called token millionaire was able to get almost 10,000,001 inch tokens at time of recording. I think one inch's price is $2.82.8. So $2.80. Sorry.
00:10:05.284 - 00:10:24.604, Speaker A: Which would mean that this airdrop, for them, is worth, like, you know, what, $28 million or something like that, which is quite insane. Then there's a few other whales in here with 1.3 million tokens. There's a few underneath that. So basically, this. This kind of shows the top claimed amount. Could you imagine being that number one there, token millionaire.
00:10:24.604 - 00:10:42.410, Speaker A: I think people have speculated that it's a fund, but from what I've heard, it's. It's not a fund, it's. It's. It's. It's an individual. I don't know who it is, of course, but, you know, could you imagine being that person and being like, wow, I just, you know, I just got airdropped $28 million. And the funny thing is that this person can't actually cash this out yet.
00:10:42.410 - 00:11:21.348, Speaker A: There's nowhere near enough liquidity, even for the other ones as well. One inch has, like, a pool to an incentivized pool, going live in three days for their one inch token, so maybe there's more liquidity there, but still, cashing out $28 million worth is going to be hard as well. So that's another kind of issue there for these whales. You know, I say. I guess I say issue like it's a bad thing, but it is an issue. When you've got this much kind of tokens to liquidate, you have to either do it over time and probably over a longer period of time, or find some OTC buyers or something like that, sell at a discount, which I'm sure, you know, if you get this kind of money for free, you're not averse to doing, so. Yeah.
00:11:21.348 - 00:11:47.404, Speaker A: Cool to see this out of one inch. And then this person here, boxer, created a doon analytics dashboard that's basically tracking a bunch of stats here. So I bring this dashboard up, you can see that 16,600 wallets have claimed one inch. This was actually 10,000 just a few hours ago, I think. So it seems that Europe's awake now because one inch token launched when Europe was. Was asleep. So, yeah, we're seeing that come in now.
00:11:47.404 - 00:12:10.626, Speaker A: There has been 55,000,001 inch tokens claimed so far out of the 1.5 billion total supply. And there's some nice charts here that show one inch number of holders over time. And as you can, as I said, like, there's 16,000 kind of holders now. And there's a bunch of other metrics here, token allocation. So where it's going, all this sort of stuff. So this is a great dashboard.
00:12:10.626 - 00:12:33.208, Speaker A: I'll link this in the YouTube description, but, yeah, that was the biggest news from today, the. The one inch launch. I did say yesterday that I thought it would be a slow news day, given it was Christmas Eve slash Christmas. It was. Besides the one inch stuff, I got a few other things I want to talk about, but, yeah, one inch stole the show. And I guess they're forever going to be associated with giving everyone a Christmas present, basically, in. In this airdrop.
00:12:33.208 - 00:13:04.742, Speaker A: So very smart marketing on their behalf, I think. So Etherscan published this little chart here today. Basically, they're doing a 2020 roundup of, I guess, like, different stats on Ethereum. And this is like a team. So they've got a live labeled chart of ETH two depositors. So if we go here and we check out here, we can actually see which entities have deposited ETH, and, you know, how much of the inter two and how much of the network they kind of account for. So you can see here that 47.84%
00:13:04.742 - 00:13:22.952, Speaker A: is currently labeled as null. So that means either unknown or individuals. You can see here that Kraken accounts for 12.4% of the ethnic finance, 11% bitcoin Swiss, 6.6% steak, fish, almost 4%. Steak us again, almost 4%. Hobby, 3%.
00:13:22.952 - 00:13:41.216, Speaker A: And then we get, like, a bit, you know, a bit more here. Basically, you got Vitalik here, and then, yeah, it just spirals down from there. I'm just looking at the names here. You know, you got a bunch of name things. You're like Cane from synthetix, tetra notes, famous whale on Twitter if you've seen him. So, yeah, this is. This is really cool.
00:13:41.216 - 00:14:08.900, Speaker A: I really like watching this because I think obviously, we want. We, you know, we want to make sure that it's. It's as decentralized as possible within ETH two currently. It's maybe not as essentialized as I would like, because Kraken owns, you know, and Kraken and Binance together are in a pretty large portion of the network. I think that's 25% if I'm doing my head. Yeah, exactly 25% of the network. So in order to cause disruption on the network, you would only need 33%, I think, to cause censorship.
00:14:08.900 - 00:14:46.286, Speaker A: So if they were able to get 25% plus 8% down here, they, you know, if they were able to get steak, fish and steak us to collude with them, they could do some censorship attacks. Now, again, this sort of stuff is risky, right? They're risking customer deposits. They're risking their reputations. I mean, I'm sure they're not going to do this, but at the same time, I wrote about this, actually, a few days ago in daily GWei newsletter. It doesn't matter that the entities themselves won't do it. What matters is if some nation state goes and maybe forces them to do certain things on ETH two. So in general, we want much greater decentralization here in terms of deposits.
00:14:46.286 - 00:15:15.210, Speaker A: But it's still early, right? Still deposits flowing in. There's not that many offerings just yet. You know, Coinbase is offering is going live in the new year. So maybe they'll, they'll counterbalance here as well. A bunch of other things going live like rocket pool for decentralized staking and things like that. So I'm glad Etherscan put this together because this is going to be really interesting to keep an eye on as we go into 2021 especially. So there's a bit of news today from digital currency group.
00:15:15.210 - 00:15:49.062, Speaker A: So they're planning to launch a new wealth management subsidiary. So for those of you who don't know, digital currency group is a massive kind of crypto conglomerate that owns a bunch of different kind of things. Like they own coindesk, they've invested in a ton of different companies. They own grayscale, as I've spoken about before. Um, the, the kind of like company, the, the asset management company that lets you buy ETH and BTC with your retirement account. And, you know, they've been a kind of big story in 2020. So, yeah, they're basically planning to kind of launch this new wealth management subsidiary, um, which I thought was interesting.
00:15:49.062 - 00:16:42.286, Speaker A: Unfortunately, this article is paywalled here. But I did want to bring this up just because, um, it's interesting to me because I, I couldn't think of a kind of company that's better positioned to do this in terms of like, crypto wealth management, considering their host of experience with Grayscale. They have a lot of connections with traditional finance, especially this group itself. You know, they have coindesk as like a media outlet and things like that. So this is very interesting for them to be doing this. I think this is the kind of like, as I've explained on the, on the show before, this is kind of what I expect to see more of in 2021, this, this maturation of this asset class, you know, wealth management for traditional finance people, more traditional finance companies coming into the space and offering crypto related things. So this is all a trend that I am looking at in 2021 and that I think you should be too, not just with bitcoin, but with Ethereum and DeFi as well.
00:16:42.286 - 00:17:26.359, Speaker A: Like, obviously, we've all seen, you know, these billionaires saying, oh, we're going to buy bitcoin, you know, these companies saying, we're going to put it on our balance sheets. And they have. And that's one part of the story, I think the other part of the story also includes Ethereum and Defi and, you know, the traditional finance system starting to kind of like, I guess, merge or like, you know, collide with, with these systems that we've built and either, you know, adopt them and become part of them or get, like, usurped by them. So that's going to be a big theme, I think, in 2021 as well. So that's something I'm going to be watching for sure. All right, last thing to talk about was that 2020 saw over $3 billion in crypto venture funding and over $690 million in mergers and acquisition activity. This doesn't really come as a surprise to me.
00:17:26.359 - 00:17:51.316, Speaker A: 2020 was obviously a year where a lot of people made a lot of money because it was the start of the bull market. You know, each started the year at $130. That $630 BTC started the year, I think. Oh, I don't know from memory. I think it was like 6000, 7000 or something like that, dollars. And now it's up at, you know, 24,000 if I'm looking at the chart just there. So, yeah, obviously.
00:17:51.316 - 00:18:21.154, Speaker A: And then through Defi summer, we had a lot of people making money, too. So there's, there's money going around. People want to reinvest, right? They want to compound their gains. There's, and, you know, in 2019 and 2018, I think we, especially in 2019, we saw a lot less funding because of the bear market. But now that things have picked up where we're seeing all this funding going on here, so this is, I mean, pretty obvious to see. For me, I think in general, we're going to keep seeing this in 2021. You know, as the prices go up, people are going to have more money, invest more.
00:18:21.154 - 00:18:48.744, Speaker A: But it's not just having more money. It's the fact that these ideas and these companies people are building have a bigger, totally addressable market now. Right. I think Defi went from being dismissed as a toy in 2019 by most people except, like, the hardcore people in the ecosystem to being like, an inevitability in 2020. Right. People are no longer debating whether decentralized exchanges and amms are going to succeed. They're debating about which ones are going to succeed and which model is going to work.
00:18:48.744 - 00:19:12.220, Speaker A: You know, there's still some skeptics, and that's fine. You know, there always is. But, you know, it's not just that as well. It's like on chain lending, money markets, stable coins, all this sort of stuff. This was all, believe it or not, in 2019, still regarded as a toy. No one outside of the hardcore Ethereum community actually believed in this stuff. So we've come a long way, and that's why I think we're seeing a lot of this funding happen.
00:19:12.220 - 00:20:00.070, Speaker A: Because if you actually look at where a lot of the money has gone, I think it's gone into a lot of depot projects for sure. And I think a lot of institutional and traditional finance kind of activity as well. So if I was, I guess, defined 2020 in two narratives, I would say that it was the Ethereum Defi. Yeah, right. The year of DeFi, the year of DeFi on Ethereum and also on the other side of the fence in bitcoin land. It was the year of institutional adoption for bitcoin and starting to get comfortable with crypto, which is now bleeding into Ethereum because, you know, it took institutions a very long time to get comfortable with bitcoin, right. 1011 years to get to that point where they're like, okay, this asset is de risked enough that we can now invest in it and feel like it's not a risky investment anymore.
00:20:00.070 - 00:20:33.038, Speaker A: And that's why they invested at 20k, right, or some of them a little bit earlier, but still very late to the game. And we're actually going to see that take a lot less time for that to flow over into Ethereum and Defi, I think, right, because of the fact that they're already comfortable with bitcoin, they'll go looking for something else. And Ethereum is typically always kind of next to bitcoin these days. So I think we're going to see a lot of that happen in 2021 as well. So main narratives I'm looking for in 2021 is increased institutional and traditional finance adoption of Ethereum and defi. Right. Obviously, bitcoin is still going to get that.
00:20:33.038 - 00:21:23.174, Speaker A: You know, that's, that's probably a surety at this point, but for Ethereum and Defi, especially, and I also expect a lot of defi kind of apps to go live that compete with the existing apps because, you know, some of them have like, I guess you could call it a monopoly in that they have like the majority market share because they were first. But I'm curious to see how many flippenings we see with each of these apps. You know, some of them are making strategic decisions that a lot of people don't agree with the existing apps. So they want to either fork it or do it better, and they'll probably raise money on that narrative everyone's looking for, then, you know, the next big thing. And if you have a really strong narrative saying you know, we're gonna compete with this product because we can do it better because of this, this and this reason. I think that's gonna be a big theme going into 2021 for sure. So, yeah, we're almost there, a few days away, so it's gonna be interesting.
00:21:23.174 - 00:22:00.326, Speaker A: January, I think, as well. You know, I'll be the over the next week, it's gonna be quiet because everyone's holidaying and stuff, but then January, people are gonna come back refreshed, and, you know, everyone feels good because it's a new year. They feel like they've left 2020 behind. And, you know, I mean, if, even if it's accurate or not accurate, I don't think it's accurate. But, like, to say that, you know, 2020 was the year of COVID and now in 2021, we're fine because we have, you know, the vaccines coming, and it's going to be a better year. I do think it will be, but I think sometimes people forget that just because it's a new year doesn't mean that all the world's issues go away. Like, you know, the concept of time is a human thing.
00:22:00.326 - 00:22:51.060, Speaker A: You know, the world doesn't care about that. But I think from a psychological point of view, you know, the new year comes in, everyone's like, okay, it's time to start fresh, right? And I think that's going to flow into, to crypto. People are going to feel more positive, you know, especially, I think, as the vaccines get rolled out as well. That's one thing that I think has spurred a lot of activity in the markets as well, is that, you know, there's more certainty now. There's no uncertainty about, like, when are we getting the vaccine? Like, when are we going to be able to do things? Yes, cases are still rising everywhere for COVID, especially in the US and Europe. But I think, you know, that's less of a concern for people now in investing because they see a vaccine there, right? They see a bunch of different vaccines, and they're like, okay, these things are going to work. They probably think COVID is going to be a distant memory this time next year because we'll have rolled out the vaccines, and then, and then we basically have kind of immunity to it across, across all of the population.
00:22:51.060 - 00:23:33.548, Speaker A: Now, I'm not a virologist, so, you know, take that with a grain of salt, but that's just my reading from speaking to different investors, speaking to different people that are kind of, like, involved with this sort of stuff. And that's the kind of feel that I'm getting, I mean, that's, that's how I personally feel as well. I like to, in my own personal investments, and this is an investment advice, but I always like to make sure that, you know, there's at least some certainty on the horizon. You don't want to invest, you know, knowing that the world could end in a month, right. Or like, there's like a high percent chance of that happening. Because if you, if you think back to why we had that big crash in March of not just crypto but the stock market as well, is because of the fact that there was just extreme uncertainty. There was this new global virus, you know, it was spreading like crazy.
00:23:33.548 - 00:24:06.296, Speaker A: You had all this stuff coming out of China where everyone was talking about, you know, thousands of thousands of people dying every day and no one knew what was going on. Right. And then you saw it spreading and, and all these cases popping up and, and no one knew what it was. But then after that, right, we slowly kind of, like over the next couple months after March, we kind of came to terms with that and people accepted that it was a thing. They knew what it was. They knew how kind of how easy it was to spread, like what the death rate was, you know, the fact that it mostly affected the elderly and things like that. And then that flows into the markets.
00:24:06.296 - 00:24:44.366, Speaker A: That's why we saw such a big uptrend, or one of the reasons why we saw such a big uptrend after that dump. And of course, we had all the stimulus happening, right, all the money being printed, so money's actually worth less than it was, you know, the US dollar, I monitor the australian dollar to us dollar pair all the time. The US dollar is incredibly weak right now. The australian dollar actually ended up, you know, crashing during March, but then going right back up and is like, up at levels not seen in quite a while now. So, you know, there's that happening, too. There's just so much happening. And, I mean, I was speaking to a friend the other day and I basically said I have no reason to be bearish right now for in crypto in general.
00:24:44.366 - 00:25:18.762, Speaker A: Like, I just, I don't see a particular reason to think that, you know, there's going to be a massive crash and, like, ETH going back to like $200 and BTC is going back to ten k or whatever. I don't see that happening. All I see on the horizon is incredible growth. I see, you know, big money coming into the ecosystem, you know, not just bitcoin into Ethereum and Defi as well. I see Defi being finally accepted as an inevitability and something that's going to change the world and something that's going to, you know, improve a lot of the things that we're doing. I see a lot of the Ethereum skeptics come over to Ethereum. You know, only the hardcore, I guess, like bitcoin maximalists still hate Ethereum.
00:25:18.762 - 00:25:46.558, Speaker A: There's a lot of moderate bitcoin is that have accepted that Ethereum is, is awesome. You know, it does, it does something very different to bitcoin and it's a distinct thing. You know, I just, I just, I mean, I, and I, and I feel like 2020 has showed the world that, you know, crypto is not dead. Right. Bitcoin's back over all time high. Ethereum's, you know, obviously not at all time high yet, but still performing a lot better than a lot of the naysayers thought it would. And then we have obviously the Defi tokens as well, you know, actually proving that they're worth something.
00:25:46.558 - 00:26:07.462, Speaker A: You know, people are willing to buy it. I could go on for a long time. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go on too much here. But yeah, just in general, I don't see a reason to be bearish about the market going forward. I think 2021 is going to be a spectacular year. I'm hoping we see at all time highs sooner rather than later, you know, maybe January, February. It can actually happen that fast.
00:26:07.462 - 00:26:35.176, Speaker A: You saw bitcoin do it that fast, right? It doesn't take much, it just takes a shift in sentiment. You know, soon as Eid starts moving up very fast, everyone's going to be like, oh my God. And fomoing in, right, and trying to chase that. So I really like, I would like to see it in, you know, January, February to set us up for a very nice maybe, you know, strong bull market in 2021. So hold on to your butts is the saying. I guess. I think the next twelve months is going to be quite insane.
00:26:35.176 - 00:26:51.224, Speaker A: So, yeah, I will digress for now. Thank you everyone, for watching another episode of the Daily Grey refuel.
