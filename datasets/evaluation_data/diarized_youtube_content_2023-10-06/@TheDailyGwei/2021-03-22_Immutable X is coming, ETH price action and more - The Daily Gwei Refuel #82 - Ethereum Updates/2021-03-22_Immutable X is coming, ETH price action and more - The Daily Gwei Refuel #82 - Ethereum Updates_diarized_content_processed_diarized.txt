00:00:00.480 - 00:00:28.366, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Dailyguay refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 22 March 2021. Alright everyone, let's get into the news from the weekend. And actually, before we do that, I'm going to remind you all that it's only a few days left. Actually, I think maybe three or four days left to donate on Gitcoin grants as part of this matching round. So if you haven't done so already, be sure to go on here and donate to all of your favorite projects. There's still, there's obviously plenty to choose from.
00:00:28.366 - 00:00:45.542, Speaker A: Obviously, you know, the Daily Gwei is included in that. And I big thank you to everyone that has kind of donated so far to, to the Daily Gwei. I really appreciate it, it's really great. But definitely don't forget to donate to all the other projects on here as well. But I'll leave it at that. It'll be linked in the description. Of course, you can go check it out.
00:00:45.542 - 00:01:09.608, Speaker A: Be sure to get it done. You know, you only got, you know, three or four days left, I think. So don't, don't dawdle. Do it as soon as you can. Alright, so I don't talk about price too much on the refill, at least I try to avoid talking about price too much. But I've been getting so many comments and questions lately about kind of like where ETH is headed and what ETH is doing that I feel like I need to address this and I won't spend too long, too long on this. But I did want to talk about it.
00:01:09.608 - 00:02:16.870, Speaker A: So basically people are complaining right now and I see a lot of this on Twitter and elsewhere, that ETH is like a stable coin, right? It hasn't really moved. It's been going sideways since guess, the 9 March, which is, which isn't very long, right? It's like 13 days or maybe actually like you could say like the 8th year on the chart, you know, about 14 days. But then if you, if you really go back and go to like the 12th of Feb, you know, where, where it was back then it was at about dollar 1800 and today it's at about dollar 800 or at least that time of recording. So yeah, basically, I guess, you know, five or almost six weeks now of kind of like this sideways movement where we had like a, but you know, we did have that crash down to like a below 1300 after all time high. But then we've gone back up and I kind of wanted to zoom out here. I always tell people you got to zoom out when you're looking at these things and, you know, things going sideways is actually completely normal in, in a, in a bull market. You know, a lot of the time, a lot of the action happens in a very short period of time and then it might feel like it's going sideways because after it goes up a lot, it obviously comes down a bit after that and you have to kind of deal with that and consolidate and then move back up.
00:02:16.870 - 00:02:55.522, Speaker A: So this is the daily chart since Black Thursday, right on the left here since March. You know, we had obviously had that massive dump and then we've been going up ever since then. Now you'll see and you'll notice that, like, there's multiple periods. And as I said, this is the daily chart, but there's multiple long periods of time where each price basically goes kind of like sideways right before heading back up again. So, you know, we could stop down here and say that, you know, ETH went sideways for, like, I mean, I can use the tool to measure it here. So, you know, ETH went sideways for like eleven days there, right. Then if you measure it from here, it went sideways for a good 28 days and then from here went sideways for 53 days.
00:02:55.522 - 00:03:19.968, Speaker A: Right, which is longer than what we've been and doing now. And this is actually sideways, right. You can see there wasn't any, like, massive pump or dump between here. It was like actually sideways for a long time. And then, you know, ETH exploded up. So we went sideways around $240 all the way to here over almost two months. And then ETH went from like 240 to what was it, like 4480 in like 42 days.
00:03:19.968 - 00:03:56.920, Speaker A: Right. So in a very short period of time there and then obviously it came back down. We had like a bit of like upwards slash, sideways movement and then continued up. But if you count this whole range here as like a sideways movement, right, all the way to here, 95 days or three months. Over three months. Or about three months, I guess, of kind of like movement where we did go up, but we came back down and then we kind of like, took about three months before we started heading back up again. Now, you know, if we compare this to what's happening right now, like, what happened back here, you know, it looks similar, right, where we had like, this massive kind of run up and then we had like, this kind of crash back down.
00:03:56.920 - 00:04:20.502, Speaker A: And then we've kind of like, recovered a little bit and we're going sideways again. So this can go sideways. I mean, right now it's been, as I said, like, from, if we take it from like here and we go all the way here, it's been about 37 days. So this can go on for another one or two months and we'd still be fine, right? We'd still be bullish. It wouldn't be bearish at all. And we could still go up from that. You know, if you remember back in 2017, actually, you know, we can go all the way back to 2017 here.
00:04:20.502 - 00:04:52.648, Speaker A: And like, ETH did very similar things then as well. And I remember ETH being like, it stuck at $300 for quite a while. I mean, here you can basically see that if you count basically, you know, August to right over here before it started moving back up. It's the same kind of deal as I just showed you, three months, right, of movement before ETH, you know, went up a lot over the next two months from about dollar 300 to what is it here, like 1420, the last all time high sort of thing. So this is not unprecedented. It happens a lot, you know, during bears and bull markets. Especially during bear markets, right.
00:04:52.648 - 00:05:31.210, Speaker A: The bear market is just basically like one big sideways movement. I mean, if we look at the whole bear market here and kind of like measure it, you know, as, like all of this being sideways, right, from like, you know, basically, I guess you could say, from here to here, you know, all of that took like 716 days, right? That's, that's, that's a long time. That's almost two years. Like underneath this kind of like, price range here where we peaked and came back down before it went, went back up again. So, yeah, I mean, we don't, obviously don't want that. I don't think that's going to happen. I do think that the price is generally just consolidating around here.
00:05:31.210 - 00:05:53.434, Speaker A: Obviously still very bullish. I mean, there's nothing kind of bearish. I think right now the macro environment doesn't look too bad. You know, people are getting back into, into work, into the economy, right? Vaccines are rolling out for, for COVID and all that stuff. And, you know, that's the macro kind of real world picture. But in terms of, like, what's coming for Ethereum, I mean, we have so much bullish things coming for Ethereum. Like L2 is, is going live.
00:05:53.434 - 00:06:10.856, Speaker A: You know, it's rolling out. There's tons of solutions imminently coming to mainnet ERP 1559 in July. Right. You know, ETH two rollout is continuing. The first hard fork happening mid year. The merger is being sped up. I think at this point for the ETH one to ETH two merger, continued growth of defi of NFTs.
00:06:10.856 - 00:06:36.502, Speaker A: I mean, you know, we've been through this a lot on the refuel tons of times. No need for me to rehash the whole thing here. And obviously, this is an investment advice, but basically, I just don't see any real reasons to be bearish right now. It's actually, you know, typically when you, when you kind of range like this and go sideways and consolidate around a certain price level, it's actually, actually quite bullish because it means that, you know, sellers are pretty much exhausted. There's no one, like, itching to sell, right. But at the same time, there's no one, like, itching to buy. Right.
00:06:36.502 - 00:07:06.380, Speaker A: So essentially you're waiting for, like, some influx of new demand for whatever reason to come in, whether that be new buyers or existing kind of traders just waiting. Cause trading this market is actually very, very difficult and very stressful because it's just sideways. It's just choppy. Right. There's no clear trend here. So traders always look for a clear trend, and you can't see it here. You know, you may have, you may know that it's gonna go up at one point in the future, but if you're a trader, you know, attempting to trade this whole, there's not much here for you to trade, right.
00:07:06.380 - 00:07:54.392, Speaker A: The price moves up from, you know, 17, I guess, like, it bottoms at like, 1720 ish, moves up to like, 1920 ish and then hangs around in that range, you know, trying to trade that is just not very fun. So, yeah, for those who, you know, are feeling impatient or I guess, like, feeling like, you know, he hasn't done much in the last, you know, six weeks and you've bought between that period. I mean, you know, there's a lot of us who sat through the entire bear market and we can tell you we feel your pain, but, like, six weeks is nothing. You know, this could go on for another two months. Like, you just got to be prepared for that. And, you know, the worst thing is, is that I see a lot of people just capitulate and be like, okay, well, I'm just gonna sell and go and do something else. And then, you know, if likes to do this thing where it punishes those people and just starts running up and then people fomo in, you know, this is why I always say that longer term investing is the best approach.
00:07:54.392 - 00:08:31.792, Speaker A: Like year investing, like, have a five plus year outlook on this sort of stuff. Don't invest in the short term unless you're a trader. I mean, even then, you know, it's, it, there's higher risk there. But yeah, again, not investment advice, just general kind of advice with these markets that a long term outlook is much better than the short term outlook. And speaking of that, I put out like this funny little indicator here about how during every bitcoin grants matching round, and we're right, we're in run right now since black Thursday or the crypto black Thursday in March, the market has gone sideways for ETH. And then shortly after it started moving up. I don't know if this is gonna hold again.
00:08:31.792 - 00:09:20.228, Speaker A: You know, it's just a silly little indicator that I saw and like, it kind of mapped to what I was thinking, which is pretty funny. But if this plays out again, it'll be even funnier because there's, I mean, there's only five data points here. It's not like it's a, you know, a lot of different, a lot of different data points, but it still be funny to see it kind of validated and we'll see how that plays out, basically. So L2 is heating up more than ever. I know I talk about it all the time, and I'm gonna keep talking about it, but basically, just before Starkware posted this little teaser here saying that they minted 600,000 nfts on their L2 with a single stark proof. So minting an NFT costs less than ten gas, much less than a penny, and immutable X Alpha will be on main net imminently, which is using star quest technology. So I've spoken about immutable X before.
00:09:20.228 - 00:09:45.420, Speaker A: It's the kind of decentralized exchange on L2 for nfts, and that's, yeah, releasing any day now, I think, from what I've heard. But yeah. So I want to put this in kind of, like, context here. And Eli did a good job, actually here. Mincing an NFT directly on Ethereum's layer one is like minimum $40, right? It's definitely more than that, a lot of the time. And minting a NFT on stockx is 0.3 cents.
00:09:45.420 - 00:10:15.832, Speaker A: Right. It's not even a cent to do it, which is 13,333 times cheaper than Ethereum mainnet, which is a huge improvement, right? Absolutely. Massive improvement. And to put this in even further context, you know, the cheapest thing you can do on Ethereum is sending an ETH transaction, and right now that still costs $4 because it costs 21,000 gas. So the fact that each of these NFT mints only costs ten gas, right. Is incredible. I mean this is the power of stark technology.
00:10:15.832 - 00:10:59.158, Speaker A: This is the power of the L2 scaling technology, harnessing this for roll ups. This is just absolutely incredible. I mean, you know, I think people need context and I'm glad Elia put this out because, you know, a lot of people don't, don't know how the gas market works too. And for those of you who want a quick refresher here, there's two parts to the gas gas market, or at least the fee market on Ethereum. There's the gas limit or the gas usage. So you know, an ethereum transaction, for example, uses 21,000 gas and then the gas limit that you set basically says, okay, well I'm not going to spend more than, you know, 21,000 gas on this transaction because that's how much it's going to cost for an ETH transaction to go through. And there's different gas limits depending on what you're doing.
00:10:59.158 - 00:11:38.174, Speaker A: But basically that's, that's a cost and then it's like multiplied by the guay price that you use and that's how you get the transaction fee at the end of the day. So that's a quick refresher there. So no transactions cost this much gas on, on Mainnet. Like as I said, ethereum transaction is the cheapest thing you can do. Um, so basically what, what I guess these roll ups do is they literally roll up the transactions into this stock proof and then they put this stock proof on mainnet and within that stark proof is the 600,000 NFT minting transactions. And in aggregate they cost ten gas, which is absolutely incredible. I mean this is coming very soon.
00:11:38.174 - 00:12:13.390, Speaker A: This is not like theoretical, this is not testnet sort of stuff, this is main net stuff. And, and this is uh, this is going to be coming. And you'll be able to do things like trading your gods unchained cards because immutable builds gods unchained. And there's a bunch of other NFT projects building on immutable as well. This is going to absolutely change the game. People still don't know what's coming. And on that note, actually gods unchained announced today that there you can actually link your wallet if you've got gods unchained cards to, to immutable x now, which means that they're basically, I mean, I'm expecting them to go live any day at this point, right? Like it could even happen this week.
00:12:13.390 - 00:12:47.394, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know, but I mean, the way they're kind of acting right now and the fact that starkware put out this announcement to kind of signals to me that they imminent, you know, mainland launch, which is, which is pretty, pretty, pretty exciting right now. Because at the end of the day, I can tell you guys how awesome L2 is and how awesome, you know, stark proofs on optimistic roll ups and zk rops and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, unless you use it yourself, you're probably not going to believe me or you're probably going to be like, okay, well, when is it going to be on main? And I want to use it now. It's no good to me, you just talking about it. I want to save money on fees now. It's coming. It's coming, it's coming.
00:12:47.394 - 00:13:05.914, Speaker A: That's all I can say. It's. It's not very far away now. And your patience will definitely pay off, I think. So Nick Chong from power five put out a really great Ethereum ecosystem map here. And I mean, this doesn't cover every project in Ethereum, obviously. And my head is blocking off like the NFT section in the bottom left here.
00:13:05.914 - 00:13:42.274, Speaker A: But you kind of get the idea, right? There are so many different kind of projects working within the Ethereum ecosystem right now. Obviously, Defi dominates the entire system, right. You know, there's a lot of data analytics platforms as well now, you know, active investors in this space, right? I mean, a lot of these investors do invest in other areas, but they have a heavy focus on, on defi infrastructure, you know, scaling. Obviously, there's a ton of scaling solutions out now, which is really, really exciting. And nfts in the bottom left, you can't see it here, but you can see it on the picture. If I don't zoom in, there's a ton of NFT projects spinning up now. And as I said, this doesn't cover everything.
00:13:42.274 - 00:14:15.642, Speaker A: I would say that there's like thousands of projects building on Ethereum right now, some really big, some really small, but it doesn't matter. There's. There's just so many projects building. And I found it funny because Nick actually put this together as a reply to the cardano ecosystem map that Charles Hodgkins can put together. And as you guys know, Cardano doesn't have smart contracts, so it doesn't have any of this kind of stuff. A lot of what they had. And I don't know if it's, if it's here, I don't have it up the ecosystem map that they had, but a lot of what they had was just like, quote unquote partnerships, right? And we've all seen like, what happens when people, you know, drum up partnerships.
00:14:15.642 - 00:14:43.520, Speaker A: A lot of the time they're nothing burgers. It doesn't really matter. You know, show us the maintenance implementation, show us the app, show us the users, and then we'll care. So I think this is a really great way to show us that. Right? Like, look at all the apps, right? All of these apps have a lot of users, especially the ones at the top, because they're the biggest ones. And, and yeah, I just think it's really, really cool to see these kind of ecosystem maps and to guess, you know, remind ourselves about how big this ecosystem is and how much it's growing. And, you know, not everyone can keep track of it anymore.
00:14:43.520 - 00:15:16.600, Speaker A: I can't even keep track of all of it anymore, which is, you know, even more exciting. So, yeah, really great map from Nick here. So I'm put out this tweet because I think, and full disclosure here, I'm an investor and advisor and M stable, but I think people are kind of sleeping on what's, what's happening with, with M stable right now. So basically there's a bunch of upgrades going live over the next few weeks that are all public. This is not like me having any, you know, insider information or anything like that. This is all very public. Aimstable makes a point to make sure that everything that we do as like, as like a protocol is made public.
00:15:16.600 - 00:16:06.702, Speaker A: So, you know, the major features are a buyback and make for the MTA token. And some of you may be familiar with this, but for those who aren't, the way this works is that instead of a buyback and burn like what you see, I guess like Maker do where they use system revenue to buy back MKR and burn it, it uses the system revenue or M stable will use the system revenue to buy back MTA tokens from the market and, and then put them in liquidity pools to market make. So essentially you have guaranteed liquidity from the M stable treasury. For the MTA pair. There's also going to be an upgraded amm going live for MUSD, which is detailed here in this post. You can read it in the description below. Basically, this newly upgraded bonding curve is more flexible than the existing kind of curve that we've got going on and it guarantees minimum amounts of liquidity with max.
00:16:06.702 - 00:16:38.932, Speaker A: Kind of like max weights for different stable coins in the basket, which is really cool. Greatly improved tokenomics for MTA coming. Of course, there's going to be new liquidity mining programs that better align incentives with vesting and all that sort of good stuff and feeder pools that are going to greatly boost m stable asset growth. So that's another thing to look forward to. So yeah, if you've been sleeping on M stable, I definitely go check, I recommend checking it out. These guys are just really heads down building. Like I would know because I talk to them a lot and you know, I think that the features that they're coming out with is really, really positive.
00:16:38.932 - 00:17:21.694, Speaker A: So if you've got some stable coins and you're looking for some yield, definitely go, go check out m stable here. And of course I'm biased because I work closely with them, but I wouldn't be kind of telling you guys about this if I didn't think it was, it was worth your time to check it out. So Spencer noon and Zack, yeah, Zach Chow here put together a, basically a table on, on Google sheets. Oh, sorry, yeah, Google sheet, not Google sheets, sorry. Google Docs. Basically comparing all the different NFT platforms and how you can get started on all of them, what their kind of fees are like, what the royalties are like and who pays the gas fees and stuff like that. So yeah, if you're someone who is interested in creating an NFT or just like comparing the different platforms, definitely go check out this, this table.
00:17:21.694 - 00:17:54.630, Speaker A: It'll be linked in the YouTube description, of course. And I found it interesting that pretty much all of the, I guess, like projects, except makers place in Nifty gateway, get the user to pay the gas fees. So, you know, Nifty gateway has no gas fee at all. Makers place will cover all the gas fees by the platform until further notice. But they will take, I think, fees on the primary sales, of course, so does everyone else. But like, you know, they pretty much all take primary sales fees. Some of them take secondaries, some of them take royalties, I think, as well.
00:17:54.630 - 00:18:20.384, Speaker A: If you mint through them. And then, yeah, I mean, they've all got a bunch of different ways of going about it. Some of them are geared towards different things. Like I think Nifty Gateway is very popular for their open editions, super Rare is very popular for art foundation, I think is more art focused as well. Open seas is generalized. Zora is definitely art based. Makersplace is more about limited edition kind of, and like very highly curated.
00:18:20.384 - 00:18:46.632, Speaker A: And rarible is also more, more of a general marketplace. So they all serve their own purpose. I don't know how many long term winners there's going to be in this. You know, this is still very early days. I don't know which of these are going to be the long term winners at this point. I think the generalized marketplaces are really good, but I also think that the, the highly curated stuff actually has its purpose. And, you know, this is just like highly curated art museums in real life and art shows, like, so like, they weren't bust or anything like that, right? They're still very, very profitable.
00:18:46.632 - 00:19:20.044, Speaker A: So, yeah, it'd be interesting to see how the NFT marketplace ecosystem evolves over the next, I guess, few years. So DC investor put out an interesting tweet here where he basically says, you know, nothing to see here. It's just ETH on its way to becoming the most important programmable reserve asset of all time. It's going to be fun watching everyone else fomo into this narrative in the coming years, claiming they understood it early. Just remember who told you first. I really, I find a funny DC's approach. Yeah, he's always, I wouldn't call it passive aggressive, but he's always like, guys, like, ETH is such an amazing asset.
00:19:20.044 - 00:19:44.080, Speaker A: Like, if you're sleeping on it, if you're bearish on it, then you know you're wrong, essentially, which I always find funny. But he links an image here to back up his claim, where ETH being locked in Defi is trending on up. Right. It's at 9.3 million ETH right now, locked in Defi, and it's basically up from $7 million in January. And you'll remember it actually came down a lot after the uni liquidity mining incentives ended. But then a lot of that went into ETH two.
00:19:44.080 - 00:19:56.974, Speaker A: So ETH two is like 3.6 million ETH kind of in there right now. So if you count, you know, 9.3 million in Defi, 3.6 million in, in ETH two. Sorry. You can get to like 12.9
00:19:56.974 - 00:20:33.356, Speaker A: million or something like that if I'm doing, doing my math right there, of ETH basically across Defi and, and, and ETH two, which is a huge percentage. I think that is about 10% of the, the total ETH supply in, you know, locked in Defi or locked in e two, which means that, that ETH is being a productive asset. He's doing something. A lot of the ETH in Defi is, of course, on maker, which is acting as collateral for Dai. A lot of it is in uniswap and sushiswap, which is acting as a trading pair for a lot of the other tokens and things like that. And in ETH two, of course, it's acting as a security bond, essentially, for the different validators. So.
00:20:33.356 - 00:21:05.480, Speaker A: Yeah, and this number just keeps going up. I mean, it's going up on ETH two as well. It's going up on in Defi, you know, people are hungry for ETH and can't get enough of it. So this is really, really amazing. I mean, I mean, obviously, like, I've been going on a lot about how I think, you know, ETH is an asset, has so many different use cases, it's impossible not to be bullish on it. Couple that with the fact that eats, you know, a big use case for ETH is its uses to pay fees. And in, in July, when AIP 1559 goes live, you know, a lot of that, that fee revenue is going to be burned as well, putting deflationary pressure on ETH.
00:21:05.480 - 00:21:26.388, Speaker A: I mean, there's so many catalysts for ETH as an asset right now. It's very hard not to, not to be bullish here. As I explained earlier and this sideways movement, I mean, we're gonna, I think there's gonna come a day sooner rather than later where, you know, ETH will go from where it is now. Eighteen hundred dollars to much higher, and people are gonna regret it. They're gonna be like, oh, my God, I could have bought it. Dollar 800. And now it's at this price.
00:21:26.388 - 00:22:10.412, Speaker A: Wow, what was I doing? And I think, you know, people love following momentum, and that's why, you know, when, when you see the momentum in either direction, that's kind of why you see the price, I guess, going down or up based on the momentum, is that a lot of people don't want to be follow, don't want to be leaders, right. They want to be followers where they want the momentum to be there to confirm that they can actually jump into this position and buy before they buy. But to me, that's just not a really great way of going about things unless you're a trader and doing short term kind of swings. If you're a long term investor, I mean, accumulating wherever you can is great. I mean, obviously, depending on, like, how frothy the market is, you may, like, take a pause and say, okay, maybe I shouldn't be accumulating more here because the market's, like, extremely frothy. You know, I'm expecting a kind of dump. It's always hard to tell.
00:22:10.412 - 00:22:26.468, Speaker A: Like, don't get me wrong, but in general, you know, accumulating ETH during 2018, 2019 during a bear market was the best time. Second best time was during 2020. Maybe the third best time is now. I don't know. I mean, as I've said before, a lot of times on the refuel, I buy 8th. Regardless of the price. I don't care.
00:22:26.468 - 00:22:59.520, Speaker A: I really don't care what, what the price is. I mean, I remember buying ETH at the end of 2018 at like $220, thinking it was the, the bottom of the bear market was like October or something. And then ETH proceeded to dump to $80 in December. Then we had 2019, which was like, you know, a bunch of fake breakouts. And then we ended at like 120 and then in 20, and then in 2020, we went up right, we went past 220, but then we went back down because of the COVID dump. And then we finally went back up above 220 in like July of 2020. So I held onto that position, right, for, for a very long time.
00:22:59.520 - 00:23:48.716, Speaker A: And I honestly, I didn't really feel fazed by it because I knew that ETH was going to go up one day. I believed in what, like, was going on with the ethereum ecosystem, and there's a lot of people like me as well who kind of bought down there, too. So, yeah, long term investing, investing is always kind of my jam. And this is exactly why, because I is continuing to basically play out the thesis that I've had for it for years now. And that's a big part of that thesis is its usability and its usability within DeFi, obviously within staking and so many other things. So, yeah, definitely keeping an eye on this. So I went on, so speaking of being bullish on ETH, I actually went on bankless with David Hoffman over the weekend, and we basically had a live stream where we just talked a lot about, I guess, ETH and his ultrasound money meme that he's been popularizing that was originally coined by Justin Drake.
00:23:48.716 - 00:24:19.092, Speaker A: So if you want to learn more about that and I guess a bit of L2 stuff towards the end of that video, go check it out. But we're actually going to be doing it once a week as like a daily way slash bankless live stream. You know, I think for a lot of the world, or at least for the US, it's, it's evening time Friday. For, for me, it's like morning on Saturday. So that's going to be happening every week from now on. And we don't really have any genders with this video. We're just going to be talking about whatever comes to mind, whatever's hot for the, for the week, I guess, and talking for about an hour.
00:24:19.092 - 00:24:39.904, Speaker A: You know, we might end up taking questions from the audience as well if you're watching, you know, on YouTube or whatever. But if you want to watch a recap of the episode over the weekend, definitely go check this out. It'll be in the YouTube description. And, yeah, it was. It was really fun, actually. We talked about a lot of stuff, especially around ETH as an asset and what ETH as ultrasound money means for ETH as an asset. So definitely go check that out.
00:24:39.904 - 00:24:58.200, Speaker A: So, Hayden. Oh, man, I love. I love Hayden. I really do. He basically put out this tweet over the weekend where he said, if I have to go another week without publicly announcing details of uniswap v three, I might go insane. And I replied, here. I haven't been teased this much since high school, so.
00:24:58.200 - 00:25:27.852, Speaker A: But, like, yeah, seriously, though, like, the hype behind v three is just insane. Sorry. Intense. And you might have seen a meme that I created over the weekend of uniswap v three and how, like, Hayden is hyping it up. But I think it's very, very, very close at this point. I think if I had to go out in a limb and say, I think v three is ready, what I think they're waiting for is optimism, because I think they want to simultaneously launch v three on layer one and L2. Now, optimism is.
00:25:27.852 - 00:25:53.580, Speaker A: Has obviously been quiet for most of March, right after hyping up their launch. I hope they're still launching in March. I wouldn't blame them if they had to delay it for some reason, to April, because of whatever reason, like, this tech is hard. It's bleeding edge, right? You want to make sure things are right because you're dealing with real money. But I actually think that that's what's happening. So if I had to guess, I would put it, you know, kind of likely, you know, maybe. I guess, like, there's a 50% chance we see it launched this week, uni v three with.
00:25:53.580 - 00:26:31.418, Speaker A: With optimism. But I would definitely expect it to go live probably the following week. If I had to say, just from reading between the lines, I don't have any special knowledge here, or maybe that's just me with the hopium hoping it goes live then. But I think at least the next two to three weeks is gonna be pretty fun in terms of, like, things going live and announcements and all that sort of stuff. But I'm pretty confident that at this stage, you know, the audits are pretty much done for uniswap v three, the you know, everything's done, everything's built out. They're just waiting for. For optimism because they want to do this big launch and, you know, if that's not the case, then whatever, maybe I don't want to, like, kind of hype that up and say that that's definitely going to be the case.
00:26:31.418 - 00:27:09.292, Speaker A: Maybe they just launch v three on layer one and do L2 later. But I've said that my dream scenario right now is basically going from getting, like, uni of the three. Sorry, on layer one and L2 and, you know, optimism going live at the same time as well, to show the world that Ethereum can scale in a big way. Because Uniswap is obviously the most used up on Ethereum and, you know, quell all those kind of like, bad narratives and also just get v three out there, right? I mean, a uni token holder, of course. I would love to see v three launched, but, you know, the amount of teasing that's been going on is just too much at this stage. Just launch it, please. Soon.
00:27:09.292 - 00:27:31.660, Speaker A: I mean, I'll be talking about it on the refuel when it's launched, of course, and we'll finally get there. But, yeah, really, really funny tweet from, from Hayden here and, you know, he's probably going to tweet more about this during the week if it doesn't launch this week, but he's hoping it does, so. Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that for sure. All right, everyone, that's it for today. Thank you again for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to that channel.
