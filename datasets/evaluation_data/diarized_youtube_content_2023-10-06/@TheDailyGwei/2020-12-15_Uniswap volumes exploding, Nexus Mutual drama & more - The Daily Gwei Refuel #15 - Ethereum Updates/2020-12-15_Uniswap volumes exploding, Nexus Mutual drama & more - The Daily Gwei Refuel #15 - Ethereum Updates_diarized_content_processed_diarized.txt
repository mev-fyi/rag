00:00:00.560 - 00:00:35.102, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the daily Refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cesano, and today's the 15 December 2020. Right. Let's get into it, everyone. So I think the biggest news of the last 24 hours was the news that Nexus Mutual's kind of founder, Hugh Karp, was unfortunately attacked and had his kind of Ethereum address full of the NXM token drained. Now, this was quite a sophisticated attack, actually, something that was targeted towards Hugh. So it wasn't just like some random attack.
00:00:35.102 - 00:01:25.638, Speaker A: It was specifically targeted towards him. It basically targeted his flow of how he accesses these funds. So you can see here on the tweet that basically Hugh was using a hardware wallet. The attacker managed to gain remote access to Hugh's computer and modified his metamask extension, which tricked him into signing a different transaction, which transferred funds to the attacker, the attacker's own address. Now, this is something that can happen to anyone, and, you know, it's very hard to tell, basically, if this is happening to you or not. So, for example, when you, you know, I mean, everyone's probably familiar when you use metamask, you. You go, you know, you do a transaction and you have to press confirm on it, right? That's what's called kind of signing the transaction, and that's signing it with your private key to kind of tell the ethereum network that, yes, you have permission to spend these funds or do this interaction or whatever.
00:01:25.638 - 00:02:02.236, Speaker A: Now, if someone can replace your metamask extension or modify it with a malicious one, they can make it look like everything's normal, but you'll end up signing a transaction that you didn't mean to sign. Now, it's exactly what happened with hue. Very unfortunate, very scary kind of attack here. There's not really much you can do here, especially with metamask, because it doesn't really show you exactly what the transaction is doing. And even if it did, it probably just show you the code of it. It wouldn't show you the actual, like, human readable kind of things to basically say, you know, okay, funds are being sent from. From here to here through.
00:02:02.236 - 00:02:26.868, Speaker A: Through this smart contract or doing this, this and this. Right? So, yeah, it's. It's an attack that anyone could fall victim to. Even, you know, experts in this field, even people building DeFi products, for example, like you. But even like, coders and programmers and smart contract developers would fall for this. So, very sophisticated attack. They managed to drain $8 million worth of NXM, the transaction is basically here.
00:02:26.868 - 00:02:53.954, Speaker A: So if I load this up here, you'll be able to see, I think, it's worth less now. Yes, I guess, like, it was worth $8.3 million. And that went to basically their account. So they basically transferred from hue to their account, and then from there, they went on to basically, I guess, wash it through a bunch of different addresses, cash it out to e through one inch and things like that. So they were pretty quick about it. They didn't dawdle or anything like that.
00:02:53.954 - 00:03:16.318, Speaker A: I guess, you know, there was a lot of conversations around this for me. I kind of thought to myself, why was $8 million worth of NXM secured just by one key? Right. I would have figured it would be under multi key security. Obviously, it wasn't. That would have prevented this attack. Right. Because you need multiple signatures to execute transactions in a multi key setup.
00:03:16.318 - 00:03:57.246, Speaker A: So if you had, like, a two of three, it would have required another person to sign the transaction as well as hue in order for it to go through. And they could have spotted it and be like, hey, are you meaning to send, you know, $8 million worth of NXM to this random address? So that would have prevented it, but unfortunately, you know, that wasn't in place, and then this attack happened. Now, Hugh kind of put out a tweet, basically saying to the attacker, very nice trick, definitely next level stuff, but you'll have trouble cashing out that much NXM. If you return the NXM in full, we will drop all investigations and. And he will grant you a $300,000 bounty. So it's kind of like a bug bounty, right? I mean, I. I don't know.
00:03:57.246 - 00:04:27.050, Speaker A: I don't think the attack has taken this deal. He seems to have just cashed out, like, a bunch of NXM, I think probably more than 300,000 at this point to ETH and some other coins as well, I think. And then from there, they're probably going to wash it through tornado cash or something. I haven't followed the trail, but this is what I would do, know. I'd wash it through tornado cash and then go to an exchange to cash to fiat or something. But, you know, given that Defi is so kind of advanced now, you don't even need to leave the ecosystem. You could cash out to a stable coin, you know, even die if you.
00:04:27.050 - 00:04:56.778, Speaker A: If you didn't want to run the risk of your funds being frozen, like if it was in USDC or if it was in another centralized stable coin, you go to dai. Right, and be fine. Go to ETH and be fine. You can kind of live off that sort of stuff. This, you know, there's a lot of credit cards now that let you basically load it with these stable coins, things like that. So it's going to become easier and easier for attackers to basically get access to these funds that they end up stealing, which for, you know, I mean, that just comes with the territory. But it doesn't mean everyone else gets easy access to this stuff.
00:04:56.778 - 00:05:17.564, Speaker A: But, yeah, it means that the attackers do as well. So, you know, unfortunate event here who is a great guy. You know, he's building a lot of really cool stuff with Nexus mutual. He's been in ethereum for a long time. I feel really bad that this happened to him. I hope that, you know, he doesn't kind of, like, get too disheartened by this. I don't think anyone blames him for this.
00:05:17.564 - 00:05:50.038, Speaker A: And as I said, anyone can fall for this kind of attack. This is not unique to, to Hugh. I mean, if you're targeted and if the attacker is, you know, is determined enough, there's not much you can do to prevent this, unless you're kind of, like, checking, you know, every transaction that you sign and, like, verifying absolutely everything that you're doing yourself. And that takes some technical skill to do, and we can't expect people to do this. There are some solutions in the works, like, outside of metamask. Like, I saw a grid talking about their lattice one. I saw gnosis talking about their.
00:05:50.038 - 00:06:13.664, Speaker A: Their basically their wallet that they've got the. The gnosis kind of multisig wallet. So. And, I mean, in general, this would have been prevented by having a multisig. But obviously, most people don't have multi sig accounts for their main accounts because it slows things down and things like that. So you can understand why that's not a great defense mechanism for most people. But, yeah, just something to keep in mind when you're kind of transacting on Ethereum.
00:06:13.664 - 00:06:40.568, Speaker A: You know, make sure that you, you know, you maybe you have antivirus protection, things like that. Make sure that, you know, your, your metamask extension isn't, like, doing anything weird or malicious. I mean, it's. It's. It's hard, right? I mean, it's very hard because these attacks are normally done in quite quietly where there's not, you know, it's bit not obvious that an attack has happened. So I a hope we can solve this because it is definitely an ecosystem issue. I think we can.
00:06:40.568 - 00:07:32.906, Speaker A: But just something to keep in mind when you're kind of transacting on Ethereum. Right. Towards more positive news here. So a guy named James Fickle put out this kind of blog post today called towards long term incentives on Ethereum. And basically what this is, it's basically a new kind of grants, I guess, tool that allows you to stream kind of, you know, Ethan tokens to a cohort of people over time, and you can kind of select how much money you want to send them, how long you want to stream it for, things like that. So what kind of James has done is he's basically created a 3600 ETH payment stream that pays out over three years and points to an open grant titled ETH two development as of December 2020. So this basically, as I said, it streams over three years.
00:07:32.906 - 00:07:51.810, Speaker A: So it's like a vesting over three years of 3600 ETH, which is worth a fair bit of money today. I don't know if the top of my head, I think. I think it's worth one. If I do quick math here, I think it's $2 million, something like that. Almost $2 million, probably. Yeah, probably around that. So that's a fair chunk of change there.
00:07:51.810 - 00:08:22.310, Speaker A: And then he kind of breaks down here. What? You know, what the money, which team, the teams the money is going to. I think this is. This is pretty cool here, right? I mean, he gives his rationale as to how he basically came to the allocation percentages for each of these teams. And he says they were roughly determined by estimating the entities impact and quality of work, minus their existing level of funding. So he says that taeku was omitted because the project is well funded by consensus. So things like that.
00:08:22.310 - 00:08:49.428, Speaker A: Right. So if we scroll down here, we can actually see the breakdown. Most of the funds is going towards Sigma prime that are building the lighthouse client. And, you know, I mean, according to James's research, they must have got less funding than prismatic previous funding because prismatic is also building an ETH two client and pretty much has, I guess, like a 50 50 split with Sigma here. So that's. That's what's happening there. Danny Ryan is getting the third largest chunk at 8.4%
00:08:49.428 - 00:09:18.730, Speaker A: of that. I think that is warranted because, I mean, for those who don't know, Danny Ryan is like the lead coordinator of the ETH two effort. Without him leading this effort, ETH two would have been a much slower process and it would have been a lot more chaotic than what it is. He has definitely done some of the most amazing work and no one even knows who he is. I always laugh. I mean, no one, I guess, like outside of the ecosystem. But I always laugh because, you know, you have like people that kind of like Deride Ethereum saying, oh, you, you know, it centralized around Vitalik.
00:09:18.730 - 00:09:51.132, Speaker A: Whatever Vitalik says goes, blah, blah. And these same people don't even know about Danny Ryan, the actual coordinator of these things. Not to say that Danny Ryan, you know, that ethereum is centralized around Danny, but, you know, Vitalik has way less input in the ETH, two kind of like coordination than Danny Ryan does, for instance. So it's always funny when I see that. So great to see him getting a big share there. Nimbus and chainsafe also building ETH. Two clients got the, the fourth biggest share equally, proto Lambda, which is another researcher within e two.
00:09:51.132 - 00:10:11.980, Speaker A: He got a lot here as well. So good to see that. And then there's a bunch of unnamed researchers here that are also getting their remainder. If I had to guess who these people are, they'll be the core researchers, probably minus Vitalik, since he's already caught a lot of ETH. Right. I would say it was Justin Drake, Shao Wang. There's people that I'm missing off the top of my head.
00:10:11.980 - 00:10:33.576, Speaker A: Right. Right now, obviously, Danny Ryan's already covered there. And then a bunch of other researchers that are less public getting, getting, you know, funding for their efforts, too. So this is great. And this isn't just limited to James doing this. Like, anyone can create these kind of streams and stream them to these people over time as well. So, yeah, I suggest going to check this out.
00:10:33.576 - 00:10:56.896, Speaker A: It'll be linked in the show notes. But really cool thing, that didn't get enough coverage today, I think that I, that I just wanted to cover, cover. So kudos to James for setting this up. And I'm not sure if that 3600 ETH was kind of his ETH or if it was like a, basically a pool that he was able to gather together. But if it is his ETH, then, you know, kudos to him. That's a lot of money to be, to be paying out. You know, that.
00:10:56.896 - 00:11:25.988, Speaker A: That's very, very nice of James. So really great to see him giving back here. All right, interesting tweet from Santiago Santos from parafy capital today. So basically, he tweeted out that circle is launched, launching a high yield dollar savings account with 8.5 to 10.75% apy or yield. And he's basically described asking, you know, where does the high yield come from? And he goes on to say that the funds, the borrower, USDC, pay 8.5%
00:11:25.988 - 00:12:06.566, Speaker A: to circle and then they deposit into yn or Aave to earn 15% and capture the spread. This off to on chain ARb will be a liquidity vortex for DeFi protocols. So basically, this kind of, I mean, Arb opportunity and spread opportunity allows USDC, sorry, circle, to offer these yields to, I guess, like subsidized yields to, you know, I guess, traditional retail customers, basically, that aren't in the weeds of DeFi or anything. And this is like a centralized solution sitting on top of DeFi. This is going to be a big thing going forward. I've spoken about it before, but basically I think that we're going to see a lot of centralized services and exchanges. Tap into liquidity.
00:12:06.566 - 00:12:32.518, Speaker A: Sorry, tap into DeFi, because it really is a liquidity vortex. It sucks in liquidity from everywhere and anywhere, from any asset that is tokenized on Ethereum. And if it's not tokenized on Ethereum, someone will tokenize it. Right? You know, bitcoin on Ethereum wasn't a thing in 2019. We had tokenized versions, but the liquidity was very low. But then this year, we've seen an explosion in that. Now there's a, I think, $2 billion worth of BTC on Ethereum.
00:12:32.518 - 00:13:07.914, Speaker A: Last time I checked, something like 130,000 BTC. So, you know, these are also centralized BTC solutions like WBTC and stuff like that. But it's just more liquidity within the ecosystem, and that's what companies like Circle and other centralized players are going to tap into. So we're going to have this kind of hybrid, you know, as he says, off to on chain kind of ecosystem, but also centralized to decentralized, uh, you know, ecosystem as well. So really cool to see that. I wrote more about this in the Daily Gwen newsletter. So you should go check that out for today as well, if you want to see, uh, you want to hear my deeper thoughts on this as well.
00:13:07.914 - 00:13:47.944, Speaker A: All right. A really interesting tweet from Linda Shea today. So, basically the tweet reads, it makes me so happy that in a dao with the community treasury, anyone can step up to contribute significantly to the project and get compensated for it. If voted on by the community, it can even turn into a full time role. This accessibility is part of why I love the crypto space. I mean, this is, this is great, right? We've seen this kind of play out with so many communities over the last few months, the obvious one being wire, where they basically have a full kind of full time team on the payroll that is decentralized, that wasn't coordinated, it wasn't centrally planned or anything like that. They didn't raise vc money.
00:13:47.944 - 00:14:31.450, Speaker A: They just came into this project and they loved what they were doing, offered their services, getting paid for it. And, you know, I mean, they're probably the biggest example, but they're not the only one, you know, at set. I'm working with them on the index co op, which is basically a Dao that manages different index products and things like that. This is the same thing. We have a bunch of community members contributing really, really valuable content and they're getting paid in index tokens so that the native token of the index co op. And they're very motivated by this because you know, that they obviously, by getting paid in these tokens, they get a stake in the network as well. I don't think anyone that we can, that we, that is being sorry, that is being compensated is full time with index co op yet.
00:14:31.450 - 00:15:01.942, Speaker A: So it's like a side hustle for them, but it's not like a lower, a low amount of money either. Some of them are earning up to $4,000 worth of index a month for their work. And this is part time workouts out of their full time role. And they're holding these index tokens too, because they want a voice in governance. They want to capture the upside to, you know, the future upside because they believe that the index cop is going to go far and things like that. Full disclaimer here, obviously I'm biased with how I'm talking about it because I'm involved with the project. I'm also, you know, a holder of index tokens, too.
00:15:01.942 - 00:15:36.156, Speaker A: But, you know, obviously I have a lot of experience with this because of index co op. So I figured I'd talk to that. But as I said, it doesn't just, you know, it's not just limited to one dow like wine or index copy. Pretty much like every dao can do this. You know, the compound dao, the maker dao, Uniswap Dao. Like, I mean, every single one can, can do this and reward contributors and basically build an army. This is not new, but something that I think that not enough people appreciate that you can now kind of work for crypto as long as you kind of, I guess, put in the effort, right.
00:15:36.156 - 00:16:07.044, Speaker A: And you don't have to be a smart contract developer or anything. You can basically be anyone. Like, you can do marketing, you can do community management, you can do memes, right? You can do general art like front end work. You don't have to be a back end smart contract developer. So there's kind of a role for everyone. So yeah, if you're looking for like a break in crypto, maybe it's, it's probably best for you to go through the different projects, see the kind of like compensation programs they're running and see how you can contribute because it's a good foot in the door for sure. I think.
00:16:07.044 - 00:16:55.370, Speaker A: I think, you know, putting this on your resume when applying to crypto companies is actually going to be, you know, make you shine as part of the candidates because you've already got experience within crypto. I know from working with different teams to recruit new people on board. A lot of people come into this ecosystem, but they don't understand crypto or defi, right. They're not crypto or defi natives and that's what a lot of companies are looking for. They, I mean these people might have like the really great skills, but they're missing a lot of the context which makes them less, the less than ideal candidate that these teams are looking for. So, you know, if you're already in crypto, you already know what you're doing, you're a defi native, definitely just go contribute to these projects to bolster I guess like a resume for when you do want to kind of go into crypto full time in whatever role you choose. Alright, so this is, this is funny.
00:16:55.370 - 00:17:30.716, Speaker A: Finally, Coinbase is listing Aave and SNX. They're also listing b and t, b and t here. But I think ARVN SNX has been basically, I mean, so the communities of these tokens and Defi community in general have been begging Kana Coinbase to list these because it's like, you know, why don't you have these Defi tokens on there? They have all the other bigger ones on there and they finally did it today. So, you know, it's funny to see everyone talking about this finally. But at the same time this got me thinking, Aave and SNX, I mean Aave is over a billion dollar market cap. I think snx is close to that. Right.
00:17:30.716 - 00:18:15.024, Speaker A: In terms of like fully diluted cap. They both grew to that through Defi mainly, right. They're on other centralized exchanges, I mean, binance as well. But a lot of this growth has come from Defi. And I actually don't think that these tokens really need centralized exchanges to grow anymore because of Defi, because of decentralized exchanges. But you know, it's always good to see these tokens listed on there because they actually give people a way to kind of, you know, on ramp or off ramp with fiat, for example, and also on ramp and off ramp, you know, to their bank accounts and things like that, rather than like a stable coin and allows people that don't really care to go into Defi or whatever to buy these things. And obviously people are holding these tokens, you know, enjoy that, for example.
00:18:15.024 - 00:18:38.494, Speaker A: So, yeah, good to see Coinbase doing this. Coinbase is normally pretty supportive of Defi, so that, that's why it was weird they hadn't listed these two kind of blue chip defi tokens. So, you know, finally they have, you know, a couple more weeks left of the year, maybe, you know, maybe they'll. They'll lose some more things. I'm curious to see how, how that goes there. But yeah, kudos to Coinbase for. For finally listing these tokens.
00:18:38.494 - 00:19:03.548, Speaker A: You know, I know that I'm not really focusing on b and t here and that's because, I mean, I don't really think there's a large b and t community. I don't see them. I don't see them like kind of begging exchanges to list tokens or whatever. And, you know, it does, it's not considered like a blue chip of defi, for example. So yeah, I think Ava and SNX, definitely the standout news here on Coinbase for sure. All right. Some really cool news out of catnip.
00:19:03.548 - 00:19:53.430, Speaker A: So for those who don't know what catnip is or catnip exchange is, it's basically a front end that looks like Uniswap, that is built on auger and balancer that lets you basically trade different tokens specifically kind of like prediction market tokens. So this was used a lot during the, I guess, prediction market kind of like boom during the US election, right. We had a lot of activity happening there. Now what they've released today is basically you can buy prediction market shares directly on Twitter using Zero X's API and Uniswap with mass book backed by August Oracle. So there's a lot of composability and money legos going on here. And if I play through the video, you'll be able to see they're scrolling through here. You know, they click on the, the ticker and then you can kind of click swap and then you can buy these shares.
00:19:53.430 - 00:20:20.290, Speaker A: Now this is part of Maskbook. That's what enables this. So mask book is, is the app and it's a chrome extension that enables this. So once you've got it installed, you can click on the ticker, and then you can actually do what the video is showing, where it's like you can trade directly without leaving Twitter, which is really, really cool. I mean, I don't think I have it installed at the moment. Yeah, if I click through, it's just gonna bring me to the normal thing. But if I did, it would come up with this little pop up.
00:20:20.290 - 00:20:44.370, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's really, really cool. I think we're going to be seeing more and more of this. I actually wrote about this in the Daily Gwei. Now that I think about it, I call it seamless finance. Right, where finance is going to be directly embedded into everything that we do online. Because of Defi, right. Because of these open kind of infrastructure on Ethereum, it's so much easier for apps and stuff to plug into it.
00:20:44.370 - 00:20:57.650, Speaker A: To plug into, like, a bank's back end, and things like that is much harder. Banks don't really talk to each other. It's slow. You know, it's. It's just built on these old rails, and it's like band Aids everywhere. So this is kind of. I mean, this is Defi.
00:20:57.650 - 00:21:30.838, Speaker A: I guess the main draw of Defi for me and always has been, is this thing of basically money, legos and composability, and it's why it's so powerful. So, yeah. Very interesting release from Catnip today. All right, speaking of, I guess, Defi composability and all that. Hayden Adams from Uniswap tweeted out today that uniswap passed $50 billion in all time volume last week, which is split across 26,000 unique trading pairs. And he says, we just need to do this 19 more times to hit $1 trillion total volume. This is insane.
00:21:30.838 - 00:21:54.026, Speaker A: $50 billion, all on chain, on Ethereum. Remember how I spoke about the total value transacted on Ethereum yesterday? And it's over a trillion dollars, while Uniswap accounts for 5% of that alone. You know, that's not including. You know, obviously, there's. There's other things that happen, but the fact that Uniswap accounts for such a big part of this is. Is massive. So I think, you know, it was a slow grind up.
00:21:54.026 - 00:22:25.304, Speaker A: Like, Uniswap has been out since 2018. We saw it slowly, slowly growing and growing. Then if you look at the charts, it kind of exploded in 2020, as everyone knows. And that's what kind of, like, I guess, this $50 billion volume has come from. And then in a follow up tweet, Hayden says, when will uniswap hit $1 trillion cumulative volume? Most people voted for 2021 and so did I. I mean, I think so. It's going to be a bit, it's going to be a bit hard in 2021 unless we have another defi boom.
00:22:25.304 - 00:23:02.926, Speaker A: I think we will. But when you think about it, right, even if you think about all the volume that was done on Uniswap this year, you know, say $50 billion was done on Uniswap this year alone in 2020, you kind of need to like ten x 20 x that to in 2021 for it to get to 1 trillion, you know, dollars of cumulative volume. But maybe, you know, he doesn't mention it here, but like, Uniswap's obviously coming out with Uniswap v three. That's going to come out with a lot of new features and maybe a L2 implementation as well. So if there is a L2 implementation, you're going to have a lot more trading going on on Uniswap. So that's going to be counted as well. So maybe we can get to a trillion dollars.
00:23:02.926 - 00:23:22.206, Speaker A: I think that'd be really cool if we did. I'm looking forward to seeing if we do. I think 2021 is actually going to be a pretty, pretty eventful year for Ethereum and Defi again, just as 2020 was. So looking forward to seeing that play out. All right, that's it for today's episode, everyone. Thank you again for watching and listening. Subscribe to the YouTube channel.
