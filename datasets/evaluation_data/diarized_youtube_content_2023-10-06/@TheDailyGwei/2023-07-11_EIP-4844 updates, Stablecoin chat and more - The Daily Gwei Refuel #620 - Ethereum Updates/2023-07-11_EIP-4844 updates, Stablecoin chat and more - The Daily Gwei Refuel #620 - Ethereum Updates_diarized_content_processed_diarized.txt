00:00:00.120 - 00:00:32.990, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the deliberate refuel, where I recap the latest news in Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Isisano, and today's 11 July 2023. Right everyone, let's get into it. So another update here from Terence on the latest EIP 4844 implementers call. So today's highlights included the status of Devnet Seven, Devnet eight, planning beacon API updates, and blob gossip parameters. So I guess the main takeaway is that Devnet Seven has been chugging along nicely. They've been spamming the Devnet with blobs with around 2000 submitted in the past days.
00:00:32.990 - 00:01:24.598, Speaker A: However, Taryn says here we've encountered issues like client splits and chains not being followed. That's what Devnet is for, to find and fix bugs. And you can check out the client tracking notes document here, which I'll link in the YouTube description below to see, you know, to see which clients are actually able to stay synced to the head are attesting and proposing, it seems. I guess most of the issues are centered around errand on the execution layer side of things, not being able to talk to the consensus layer side of things. You can see all the red crosses here. I don't know if that's because they haven't basically tried yet or haven't built the, haven't built the spec into their client yet, but it seems most of the other client combos are going okay. There are some things here and there where you can see here that geth and prism aren't attesting or proposing and nethermine and nimbus aren't proposing.
00:01:24.598 - 00:02:04.178, Speaker A: So not obviously picking on errand here, but just glancing at the chart and seeing where the crosses are, where the ticks are, and where their question marks are here. Now, as Terrence said, you know, this is what you expect from, from Devnet. This is why we do the Devnet before we do the test nets. Test nets to iron out as many bugs as possible. They could be very simple bugs, guys. By the way, like the thing with building, you know, clients and engineering clients is that the bugs can be as simple as one line of code being changed, right, because someone did a typo somewhere or someone named a variable, you know, or referred to the wrong variable somewhere. These don't necessarily have to be like major critical things that are show stoppers that take weeks to fix.
00:02:04.178 - 00:02:38.826, Speaker A: Now, I mean, sometimes there might be some stuff like that, but usually it is small things, especially because the spec is basically done. From my understanding, the research is basically done so we know based on the spec and in theory that it works. It's just that we obviously need to get the clients to the point where it actually works on a live network without there being chain splits or anything like that. And that's exactly what these devnets are for. So Devnet Seven is tracking along nicely with Devnet eight already on the horizon. The spec is out, but the launch date is still to be determined. Keep in mind that this devnet will start from capella Genesis.
00:02:38.826 - 00:03:20.550, Speaker A: So you can check out the notes document around Devnet eight here. As was said, there isn't a date yet for when this will be going live, but I'm sure this will be going live rather soon. And there's also a Devnet nine planned as well. So, yeah, I mean, pretty fast moving here. These devnets aren't meant to be long lived. They're just meant to be out there for testing purposes, to find those bugs, squash those bugs, so that we can eventually move on to some test nets and then obviously main nets. Nothing I've seen, as I've, as I usually say here, has signaled to me that 48, 44, or I guess like Den Kun generally as a network upgrade is being pushed back or anything like that, there isn't any date for it.
00:03:20.550 - 00:03:43.260, Speaker A: There's obviously just that estimate of, I guess my own personal estimate of like October. November, more likely November. But I haven't seen any dates or estimates really given by the core devs themselves. It's. It's really just based on the fact that they've said they wanted to maintain a six month release cadence and the last release obviously was in April. So six months from then would be around November or something like that. October, November.
00:03:43.260 - 00:04:10.748, Speaker A: So yeah, that's, that's still my prediction, but we'll see how things chug along there. But you can check out the latest thread here from Terence. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, you guys know that the Ethereum staking deposit queue has been quite full for quite a while now. I mean it has actually dipped to about, I think, 82,000 last time I checked down from the 90,000 that it has been persistent at. And I'll just bring up the Beacon chain website here. So I've got it in front of me.
00:04:10.748 - 00:05:03.474, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's at 82,554 now, of course the exit Q is still at zero, but yeah, it seems that we're coming down from where we were just a couple of weeks ago when we're at like what, 95,000 pending or something like that. But we're also coming down faster because recently, as Tom Wan highlights here, that because Ethereum hit the 655,360 active validator milestone, the churn limit has increased from nine to ten per epoch, which means that instead of 2025 validators being let in each day, it's 2250 validators each, each day. So we're letting in an extra 125 validators here. If I'm doing my math correctly. No, it's more than 125, isn't it? Wow, my math sucks. 225. 225 validators per day, which is obviously clearing out that queue faster.
00:05:03.474 - 00:05:42.798, Speaker A: But it seems that people joining ETH staking or Ethereum staking has slowed down a bit. Now, it could have slowed down for a number of different reasons, just from a bit of anecdotal, I guess, reasoning here that I've come across, there are a lot of people that I know that are waiting for the queue to come down in order to stake. Now, this may seem counterproductive in that you may as well just stake now, because the longer you wait, you, you would have waited. Let's just say you wait that, you know, the six weeks for the queue to come down and then you deposit. Well, you've basically waited the same amount of time. And if the queue goes up during that wait period anyway, then you've waited longer than just joining the queue earlier. Right.
00:05:42.798 - 00:06:25.140, Speaker A: But, but things do change when you consider the LST's. So I have some friends that basically what they do is that they've bought these lsts, whether they be, you know, Steth or Rethy, um, more so st ETH, because you get that immediate kind of upfront yields, but they've bought that and they've get, they're getting that immediate upfront yield so they don't miss out on any yield. And then once the deposit queue clears, they're going to spin up a solo validator. So it's kind of funny how LST is influencing that. I don't know if it's really worth the risk for what, an extra six weeks worth of yield. I believe that actually, I believe the deposit queue, because of this increased churn limit, is actually down to like 35 days or something like that. It's, it's, it's, it's very, it's, it's much shorter than it has been.
00:06:25.140 - 00:06:49.584, Speaker A: So just over a month now is the increased risk. And, you know, is it, is it worth it? Like, maybe if some people it is. But for me personally, every time I've spun up a solo validator, I've done it irrespective of the queue. I did one recently, actually, when the queue was over 90,000. And honestly, I don't care that I'm still in the queue. I don't really care. I'm, I'm looking at that and I'm being like, you know what? I don't care about missing out on four to five weeks or whatever it was.
00:06:49.584 - 00:07:19.254, Speaker A: Six weeks worth of yield here. It is not that big of a deal. And, you know, obviously there is a chance of proposing a block in though those six weeks that I could have proposed if I didn't wait, and then I could have gotten an extra, extra yield from that or a big block reward. But the chances of that happening are quite low. So I'm happy just waiting around. But I know people that just aren't, you know, they're both. I mean, they're waiting until the queue clears, but they're also staking with other services like Lido that are, that front the yield for you because they don't want to miss out on the yield.
00:07:19.254 - 00:07:45.932, Speaker A: So that's just a bit of anecdotal kind of stuff that I've come across personally. But it's great to see that the trend limit has increased. This is built into the protocol, by the way, guys. It keeps going up, the more validators that come onto the network. And you can see this nifty little chart here from Tom, Tom Wan showing you where it actually did lift. So you can see each portion of where it lifted. It lifted in April and then before then it lifted last time in February, and then before that in October of last year.
00:07:45.932 - 00:08:09.148, Speaker A: And you can see the speed at which it's lifted. Actually, it lifted, or it went from nine to ten much faster than it went from eight to nine here, which is, which is pretty cool to see. And Tom also has some more tweets in this thread with more information about this. Actually, a lot more information about this. Wow, I didn't realize this thread was that long. That's really cool. So shout out to Tom for putting together this thread here about this, but you can go check that out for yourself.
00:08:09.148 - 00:08:32.304, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below. Uh, but yeah, it seems that this queue might. It's kind of hard to know where this will go, right? Like, is it going to go to zero anytime soon? Is that bearish? I don't think it's bearish. I think some people have been saying, oh, the queue going down is bearish. I mean, what do you mean it's bearish? Right. Like, we just hit 20% of the total ETH supply staked. Um, you know, we're still deflationary.
00:08:32.304 - 00:08:52.220, Speaker A: ETH is in such a great position as an asset right now. I don't know. People just like to bring up these bearish things, and, you know, it's kind of funny because people love to bring up bearish narratives, no matter what it is. Like, people are even bringing up bearish narratives around the bitcoin ETF. They're like, oh, yeah, okay, if the ETF gets approved. But, you know, it's still bearish because of such and such reason. It's like, oh, my God, guys.
00:08:52.220 - 00:09:10.192, Speaker A: Like, don't you get exhausted being a bear? Right? I mean, unless you've got, like, an active short on and you're trying to profit from it, maybe that's. That makes it less exhausting for you. But I feel like being a bull is just, like, so much more fun and so much less exhausting. Yeah. Okay. Being a bull during bear periods can be frustrating. You have to wait.
00:09:10.192 - 00:09:29.128, Speaker A: You know, I've talked. I've talked about that time based capitulation before, but I don't know. Being a bull is just much more fun to me than being a bear. And I guess, like, it depends on the asset, too. Obviously, I'm bullish on ETH, but I'm bearish on a lot of other assets out there. You know, a lot of tokens that are. That are pretty much going to zero for one reason or another.
00:09:29.128 - 00:09:55.260, Speaker A: NFTs generally, I think a lot of NFTs are falling into the same bucket as tokens. They're just going to fade away. But that's just the healthy market cycle. So I think that I'm talking specifically about Ethan and maybe even BTC here. It just strikes me as weird and it strikes me as cope, and it strikes me as when I. What I said, I think it was a couple of weeks ago where I said the market needs to be convinced that it's changed from bear to a bull market. And the last people to be convinced are usually those.
00:09:55.260 - 00:10:12.568, Speaker A: Those holdouts, right? Those people who are finding reasons to be bearish on everything, no matter how bullish it is, no matter how much pain there's already been. Those people, the ones that need to be convinced, and eventually they will. Eventually, they'll flip. They'll flip bullish for whatever reason, and they'll join us in the. The bull pool as it. As it's. As it.
00:10:12.568 - 00:10:30.896, Speaker A: As it's called there. But, yeah. Anyway, back on topic here. You can check out Tom's thread. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But yeah, expect this to this, this validator queue to churn out more quickly as time goes on because of this. All right, a new project that I came across today, Defi project called Oku Trade.
00:10:30.896 - 00:10:55.140, Speaker A: I think that's how you say it on Twitter. They're calling themselves the most advanced defi trading platform powered by uniswap V three. From my understanding, it seems that they want to make lp'ing on uniswap v three much easier, and they also want to bring limit orders to uniswap V three. Now you can check this out for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. I'm not vouching for this protocol or anything. I don't know this protocol very well.
00:10:55.140 - 00:11:31.644, Speaker A: I only came across it today, you know, and there's obviously always risk involved with. Interacting with new protocols. Uh, but I think it's pretty cool for when people build, like, interfaces on top of the existing protocols and try to just make it a more streamlined and simple process for people while enabling new products or kind of like new use cases, like limit orders on top of. On top of existing protocols, like Uniswap V three. So, yeah, I'm just basically highlighting it because I like highlighting new things within defi. Obviously, there are a lot of things in Defi that have been around for quite a while now. Obviously, there are a lot of things that haven't worked in the past and.
00:11:31.644 - 00:12:00.566, Speaker A: But are still working now. Uniswap, obviously is the king of things that have worked in the past and are still working now. Many of you don't know. Sorry, not many of you. Many of you probably do know this, but many people generally don't know that Uniswap has been around since 2019. And, you know, even before that, in 2018, I believe there were kind of like, early iterations of this. You know, if you want to go back to the earliest iteration of amms, um, at least that were launched on Ethereum and that were live on Ethereum.
00:12:00.566 - 00:12:42.918, Speaker A: I think Bancor was one of the early iterations, but might have only come a little bit earlier than Uniswap. I don't know if they hit mainnet before Uniswap did, but Uniswap specifically has been around since 2019. Obviously, they've got version four, which is going to go live shortly after Den Coon, which is coming up relatively soon. And, yeah, they've just gone through bull and bear periods, continuing to grow. And I think that just speaks to basically what the main use case is for blockchains right now, obviously is speculation. But it's not just speculation, right? Because we can't just call everything or every trade that someone does speculation. Because you know what? If you want to trade between stable coins for whatever reason, you're not exactly speculating.
00:12:42.918 - 00:13:26.022, Speaker A: I mean, maybe you are if the stable coins de pegging or something like that, but let's just assume that they're at peg and you're swapping between USDC and USDT. Maybe it's because your counterparty only wants to accept USDT. Or maybe you've lost faith in USDC and you want to protect yourself in USDT, for example. I'm only using these as examples here. So, I mean, obviously a lot of uniswap trading is speculative, but it doesn't always have to be. And if you look at the traditional finance markets, a lot of currency trading is speculative to begin with. You know, it's not like the majority of the currency trading taking place is people going to a country as a tourist and saying, okay, well, I'm going to trade my US dollars for such and such currency, whatever currency it is.
00:13:26.022 - 00:14:04.870, Speaker A: That also influences, obviously, the speculative markets, because it's the. The brokers doing the trading, obviously trade on the speculative markets and have to have to hedge their bets and things like that and do futures trading. It's a very complex market, but most currency trading is speculative in nature. And it's funny because I remember Mike Novogratz, he was a currency trader for a long time, and this was an interview he did a long time ago. But the reason why I remember this is because it was funny to me. He said that he had like a 20 year career in currency trading. And really you couldn't make much money from it because a lot of the currencies didn't really trade in a very volatile way.
00:14:04.870 - 00:14:39.314, Speaker A: It was a very fine art. It was very. The volatility just wasn't there, whereas in crypto, the volatility is insane because you obviously not just trading between currencies, you're trading between different assets. Whether some of them are currencies, some of them are not. But that really stuck with me because I'm just like, you know what, it's kind of funny because here's this guy for 20 years in the currency markets, trying to speculate on currencies and trying to make a profit from them. And then he comes to crypto and it's just a completely different world. But the reason why it stuck with me was because that was when I kind, and this was a interview from a long time ago, but that's when I finally understood.
00:14:39.314 - 00:15:19.116, Speaker A: I don't know why I had this kind of epiphany or I'm just like, you know what? It's all speculative. It doesn't matter if it's in traditional finance or in crypto or wherever else. It's all speculative. And the more you think about it, so many things in life are speculative. So when people say to me, oh, it's only speculation, I'm like, but what do you mean it's only speculation? Like, everyone speculates in one way or another about some things. You know, you could even argue that when you're looking for a job and you're looking at the salaries, right, and then you're thinking to yourself, oh, what could I negotiate this salary to? You're speculating on what you can negotiate this salary to. So, I mean, I know it might sound like a little bit of a stretch sometimes, but you can actually reason it like that.
00:15:19.116 - 00:15:50.324, Speaker A: And there's just like, it's obviously a spectrum and there's varying levels here, but yeah, that's a little bit of a rant about speculation, I guess. But generally, I think that's why Uniswap has worked. It appeals in both bull and bear markets. Why Uniswap has worked for such a long time is it appeals to that speculative nature, but also provides a valuable end product to valuable product to end users through both of those market conditions there. And products like Oku trade that are built on top, I think are really important and really do add a lot of value. So you can check out this for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below.
00:15:50.324 - 00:16:22.710, Speaker A: All right, so it looks like Aave is getting set to launch the go or Gho stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet. So voting for this opens in, well, 24 hours as of 20 something hours ago. So voting for this open soon. You can check this out for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. But yeah, you may have forgotten all what go is or gho is. It's basically a new decentralized, multicolateral stablecoin that is being launched by the Aave protocol, the AavE project here, the Aave ecosystem.
00:16:22.710 - 00:17:43.638, Speaker A: And you can go ahead here and check out, check it out for yourself. Check out the simple summary, the motivation, things like that, and check out how this is all going to be specced out on the documentation. But I'm pretty excited for this because I've said before that I don't think, I don't think like a fiat, like pegged stablecoin or can be, can, can fit all the criteria and become like a truly decentralized, scalable and stable stablecoin. But I don't think that we have to get to a point where every stable coin has to be massive, right? Because I think when people look at the holy grail of stable coins, they think, oh, can we create a fiat pegged stablecoin that is big enough to service the world? It's like, but, but why? I should say a decentralized fiat peg stable coin that is big enough to service the world? It's like, but, but why would we want to do that? The whole point of cryptocurrency, with one of its founding principles was that we were creating new kinds of money that were, weren't tied to a nation state in any way. Obviously that started with BTC, moved on to things like ETH. And, you know, and then obviously we have stable coins, both centralized and decentralized, both pegged to us dollars and euro and other currencies. But if we want to create a truly decentralized stable coin, then it shouldn't be pegged to fiat.
00:17:43.638 - 00:18:28.512, Speaker A: Because if you're pegged to fiat, then you can't be truly decentralized, right? And then people have brought up other things like, oh, well, we can peg it to a basket of fiat or a basket of real world assets, things like that. It's like, yeah, we could, but you're still running into the same issue. So for me, a truly decentralized stablecoin is not pegged to any kind of fiat, it's really just ETH. Because if we can grow ETH to such a large market cap where it is stable relative to everything else, then it's fine. Because I think when people think about stable coins, they think about it all wrong. If you look at the US dollar, or just think about stability, generally, if you look at the US dollar, it's stable relative to itself. One USD because one USD, right? But we all know that the US dollar loses value over time for various different reasons.
00:18:28.512 - 00:19:21.748, Speaker A: Now, if you compare the US dollar to ETH over the last whatever many years or since ETH has been around, it's lost a lot of value. Right? But that's, that's a speculative thing. That's a speculative asset that it's lost value to. Same with the stock market, same with property, things like that. Right? But let's compare it to things that you spend your us dollars on every day, like bills and groceries. The US dollar has lost value against bills and groceries, right? So when comparing things, whether they be stable against themselves or stable against other things, that's the context that you should be running with. So if we can grow ETH to a point where obviously it's stable against itself, one ETH equals one ETH, but it is still relatively stable and accepted widely for payments and is deeply liquid and is accepted as a currency worldwide, then ETH becomes the truly decentralized stablecoin because ETH is the only truly decentralized asset that exists on ethereum.
00:19:21.748 - 00:20:11.420, Speaker A: So in my mind, we're never going to get a truly decentralized, scalable, serviceable to the world stablecoin that is pegged to fiat. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to have peg to fiat. Stablecoins exist within the ethereum ecosystem and the ethereum economy that service users who need them, because we still need these stable coins. People still want us dollars, right? But if we really want to up the ante and go to the next level, then what we need is a truly decentralized, stable coin that is not pentafere. And as I, as I explained, that would be something like f or ETH or, and maybe even like staked ETH. But staked ETH is a bit different because depending on which protocol you go with, it's, it's not as decentralized as ETH, right? Like Steth and Reth and CB E. I mean, I shouldn't even include cb ETH, maybe even not ste in this, but rocket pool ETH.
00:20:11.420 - 00:20:48.454, Speaker A: Let's just say as the most decentralized LSD right now, you would, you're still adding more risk on top of that. And it's obviously never going to be as liquid as vanilla ETH or probably won't be ever as liquid as vanilla ETH. So when you're looking at these sorts of things, I think you need to contextualize that as well. But yeah, for me, a truly decentralized, scalable to the world stable coin is something like ETH. But I think that things like go should exist, at least for the short to medium term, to service the needs of everyone that needs those us pegged stable coins here. So yeah, anyway, that's a little bit of a rant about stable coins, but you can go check out this proposal. I'll link it in the YouTube description below.
00:20:48.454 - 00:21:26.812, Speaker A: All right, so an interesting little initiative that I came across on Twitter today was that someone or some people are trying to get the word on chain or one word added to the official Miriam Webster dictionary here. So they've got a website where it's on chain is a word.com, but there's dashes instead of spaces there. And they're basically trying to raise money in order to. Or you can mint basically an NFT that just says on chain in order to put a billboard in front of Merriam Webster's hq that says on chain is a new word. Now this is on chain without the hyphen. It's just on chain as all one word.
00:21:26.812 - 00:21:52.212, Speaker A: And the reason why I bring this up is because it really is a new word. And I think that this word is going to keep getting used more and more. It's obviously taken from online. Could you imagine if we typed out online like on dash line? It would look weird, right? And on dash chain really has been used for quite a while now, but simplifying it to just be on chain, they drop the hyphen. Right. It's cooler, I think is a better way of doing things. And I think that this term is going to be used more and more.
00:21:52.212 - 00:22:18.020, Speaker A: I think that eventually, instead of people saying like crypto or blockchain or web3, we might just be using on chain. I actually had high hopes for web3, to be honest, but I feel like that term has been tainted now. Everyone hates it outside of crypto. Even in crypto, people just meme it and kind of like make a joke about it. So I think on chain is a relatively neutral term that we can use. Hopefully it doesn't become corrupted like blockchain and crypto and web3 have become. Crypto is generally okay.
00:22:18.020 - 00:22:41.084, Speaker A: Still. I think just the terms web3 and blockchain have become pretty corrupted. But on chain, yeah, I really like it. I really like the term and I think that if we keep pushing with it, we could make it a thing. And getting it added to the dictionary is definitely something that is one of those steps to do that. So you can check out this website for yourself and possibly meet one of these NFTs if you would like. I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you to do so.
00:22:41.084 - 00:23:18.484, Speaker A: All right, to round out today's episode, I have two things I want to talk about. The first thing was a tweet that I put out today where I said the things that drive most of the positive long term impact slash change in the crypto ecosystem are usually quote unquote, boring. Most people won't pay attention to them unless someone slaps an exciting narrative on it and drops a token. Many such cases. So this is pretty obvious, right? Like, most of the things that people get excited about in crypto have a token attached to them or have the potential to have a token attached to them. And that's only natural because people want to speculate. As I was saying before, speculation is not bad, but this, you know, and not all speculation is good either.
00:23:18.484 - 00:24:04.890, Speaker A: Don't get me wrong. I mean, I truly believe that gambling, like true gambling, is a net negative for society, to be honest. And I don't think I would ban it outright, but I don't see any other way where you could control it in a way that was not net negative for society. There is. I think, you know, gambling is, is probably just as bad as, as hardcore drugs is for people to be honest, because it's an addiction, right? And obviously people can get addicted to anything, but it's all about what the addiction is and what the negative externalities are with gambling. You know, if you're addicted to gambling, you're losing all of your money, right? Like that is affecting absolutely everything in your life with, with, with, you know, with being addicted to drugs, right? And being addicted to hardcore drugs, you are losing all of your money and you're using and you're also losing your livelihood and you end up homeless. Things like that.
00:24:04.890 - 00:24:28.534, Speaker A: So I think with gambling, it can lead to the same outcome because you're losing all of your money. If you can't pay your mortgage, you can't pay your rent, you're gonna end up homeless, too. So. And I just think that, that gambling as well. Just staying on this topic for a second here, and people can disagree with me, feel free to disagree with me. But everyone knows, even the problem gamblers, I think they, deep down, they still know that it's rigged. The house is not going to lose on net.
00:24:28.534 - 00:24:57.598, Speaker A: They're always going to win on net. The slot machines are literally rigged, right? Like they're rigged to the fact that they won't pay out after until a certain amount of money has been put into them. And that's all obviously done on purpose because you're not going to run a casino. You're not going to own slot machines if you're paying out more than what's going in. And you're always going to rig it in your favor, you're always going to rig the game in your favor. And even if you're able to beat the game in some way, the casino is just going to kick you out because they're a private business and they are allowed to do that. So.
00:24:57.598 - 00:25:33.990, Speaker A: And there's lots of cases of this. So I just truly believe that, you know, gambling is net negative for society, but generally that's a, that's an aside there. Back to my tweet here for a second. So the things that I'm talking about here, when it's boring, let's look at Ethereum core development. Most people don't pay any attention to Ethereum core development and research, but it's what's driving everything. Without the Ethereum core developers doing what they're doing and research is doing what they're doing to build out all of this infrastructure, you wouldn't be able to have all this stuff that people speculate on because there wouldn't be that infrastructure there. Same with L2 teams, right? Same with everyone building out the core defi infrastructure.
00:25:33.990 - 00:26:09.074, Speaker A: That is not super exciting, like all these sorts of things and all these foundations are being laid so people can speculate, people can get excited about things with narratives and tokens and stuff like that. But at the end of the day, like, people are just focusing on the wrong thing. A lot of the time. In my mind, it's fine to speculate, but you should be focusing on more of these substantial things, even if you want to speculate, because there's usually alpha in that, too. But this is genders generally, what people focus on. And the same is true for every industry, to be fair. But I figured I'd just put like crypto here, obviously, because it's relevant to my twitter following and obviously relevant to you guys on the refuel.
00:26:09.074 - 00:26:40.890, Speaker A: But yeah, I think on the refuel you guys are definitely in it for the tech. I don't think you'd be watching me rant on about Ethereum every day for 30 minutes if you weren't in it for the tech in a bear market. And you guys obviously are very interested in core development. I talked to you about it on the Delaware discord, but the vast majority of participants aren't. And that's not a bad thing. But it's kind of funny how, like, the things that drive the most impact are the things that most people don't pay attention to because they consider them to be boring. But anyway, that's just a little bit of a topic that I wanted to discuss.
00:26:40.890 - 00:27:11.276, Speaker A: But to round out today's episode, I'm going to have an ETH chart in front of me for the first time in quite a while. I never really have the chart in front of me. I don't really talk about price too much but this is not talking about price specifically. This is talking about kind of markets generally and how price is dictated by very kind of like short term moves or kind of like short moves. So when you look at this chart, what, you know, what do you see? Like, I'll bring up. My camera's in front of it right now. So this is the year to date chart.
00:27:11.276 - 00:27:30.784, Speaker A: This is from the 1 January this year to the 17th or, sorry, the 11 July this year. The ETH price started the year at what? Around $1200. It is up to 1870 at at time of recording. But look at it really closely. You might notice something, you might not. I'm going to explain it to you. Don't worry, it's not a pop quiz.
00:27:30.784 - 00:27:54.060, Speaker A: But like how many days. This is the daily chart. How many days has ETH actually had positive price movements that resulted in a new yearly high? Well, let's count them, right. You can look here. In January ETH went up from 1200 to around. Oh, I guess you could say, yeah, it's about. Let's go to the highest part of January.
00:27:54.060 - 00:28:10.444, Speaker A: It's about here, right. To 1675. So in 21 days in January ETH went from 1200 to 1675. Right. And then the next time it broke that price in earnest. I mean it went up a little bit to like 1740 in Feb. But let's say in earnest.
00:28:10.444 - 00:28:34.714, Speaker A: Right. It broke above that and kind of like went up to around, well 18 1870. So. And that's after it had dumped back down to 1360 here and then went back to 1870. So from, from where we were here in January it had maybe like another two, three days of positive price movement. Right. And then you can, you can see again another couple of days here of positive price movement and then another three days here.
00:28:34.714 - 00:28:56.332, Speaker A: So you got five days. You add them all together, you get like seven, seven or eight days here. And then from. From there on ETH has not set a new yearly high. It went to 21 50. And since then ETH has not set a new yearly high. So what does this tell you? Well, it tells you that out of the six and a half months of this year so far less than a month's worth of price action has dictated the yearly highs.
00:28:56.332 - 00:29:12.976, Speaker A: Right. And why I'm bringing this up is because usually the big moves happen in short bursts and the rest of the time we're just ranging. This is true for crypto, this is true for the stock market. This is true in bull markets. This is true in bear markets. Right. You can see in the bull market.
00:29:12.976 - 00:29:24.872, Speaker A: Uh, like if you want to go to 2020. Uh, let's have a look here. 2020 slash 2020, 2021. Right in. It's the same kind of thing. This, as I said, this is the daily chart. This is the same kind of thing.
00:29:24.872 - 00:29:43.832, Speaker A: You have a lot of sideways where you have, like, these big steps up and then sideways. You have the big step up, sideways, sideways, sideways. And before you get up, like, to the previous big step up price, it can take a little while to do that. Obviously, in a bear market, it takes longer, but it still happens in. In either markets. Uh, and it doesn't just happen in ETH or crypto. It happens in all sorts of markets.
00:29:43.832 - 00:30:14.304, Speaker A: And you'll see this pattern repeated out time and time again. Now, you may be wondering why this happens. I'm not an expert on why this happens. I have a few theories about this. I think my number one theory is that the price goes up, right? And then it finds a level where there's an equilibrium where people start taking profits, right? People start selling into it, and they're like, oh, okay, the price is up a lot, because if you look here, right from the 1 January to the 21st, ETH went up around 40% after. We're basically being, you know, very down, only for. For.
00:30:14.304 - 00:30:40.782, Speaker A: For a lot of 2022. Right? Like, you can see the massive drop offs here. People start taking profits. Um, and then the same is true for, like, a lot of the other moves, I think. And then you end up just having more sellers than buyers, right. Just supply and demand at the end of the day. Uh, and then you have to kind of climb that, what they call wall of worry during a bear market, during a crab market, where you have to convince, as I've said before, you have to convince those bears that the bull market is back, that the price is going up again, that what ends up happening less and less.
00:30:40.782 - 00:31:10.778, Speaker A: People want to sell, right, because they convinced that it's a bull market. So they keep waiting and waiting and waiting for prices to go higher. And prices do go higher because you have that feedback loop. But then eventually it reaches an equilibrium again where there's more sellers than buyers, right? There's more people taking profit than there are people buying in. And then we have the bear market again, right? We have the big drop offs and we have the big dumps, and obviously, leverage blow ups, things like that. But usually those things, again, happen in short bursts. So really, what I'm trying to tell you is that day trading is just a brutal game.
00:31:10.778 - 00:31:47.798, Speaker A: It is not a game that I think most people can profit from long term investing is also brutal. If you're looking at the price every day, like, if you're literally waking up every day and checking the ETH price, and you're very sensitive to the ETH price because you are relying on it going up for whatever, then most days is going to be boring. Most days either going to be neutral or down on the price. It was, you know, a couple months back or something like that. Even if you look at it right now, ETH is at 1870. It was at 1980, like a week and a half ago, and it was at 21 50 back in April. So if you're sitting at this price, you'd be like, oh, my God, ETH hasn't done anything since like April.
00:31:47.798 - 00:32:03.458, Speaker A: I mean, okay, yeah, no, it hasn't. But why are you looking at day to day price movements? Right. You can switch to the weekly chart. It's still going to show a, a similar picture here, but it's going to give you more up than, than sideways. It's going to look a little bit healthier. Switch to the monthly chart. It even looks healthier.
00:32:03.458 - 00:32:18.802, Speaker A: Look at this. I looked at this other day, the monthly chart. You wouldn't know this, but it had six green monthly candles in a row. And this month isn't over yet. This month is currently red, but there's still 20 days left of this month. So this could turn green as well. So zoom out, guys.
00:32:18.802 - 00:32:44.622, Speaker A: Don't look at day to day movements, only look at them if it's out of curiosity or if it's out of some kind of like longer term analysis. But generally it's not going to tell you much. A lot of it is noise. The price kind of is not made on the daily chart. It's made on the weekly and monthly, especially the monthly. That's where the kind of, the marginal price is set in terms of like the time ranges here. But yeah, anyway, I just wanted to hide that for you guys.
00:32:44.622 - 00:32:59.156, Speaker A: Walk you through it. Walk you through how I think about it, but I've gone over time here. I thought today's episode was actually going to be shorter, but it turned out to be longer because I went on a few rants today. But I hope you enjoyed them. But that is for, is it for today?
