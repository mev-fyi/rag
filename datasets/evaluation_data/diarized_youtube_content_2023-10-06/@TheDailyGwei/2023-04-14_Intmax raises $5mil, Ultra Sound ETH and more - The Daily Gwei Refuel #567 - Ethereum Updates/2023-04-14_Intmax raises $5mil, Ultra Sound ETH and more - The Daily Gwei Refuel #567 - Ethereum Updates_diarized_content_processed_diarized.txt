00:00:00.200 - 00:00:42.902, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Deli Grey refuel, where we recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Dan Denise Asano, and today's the 14 April 2023. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So the first all core devs call post shapala has, has happened here. And you can see the agenda and link to the stream that Tim Baiko linked here, as well as a summary of what was discussed on the call. Now, of course on the agenda you can see that there are a bunch of things discussed discussed, such as a recap of Chappella Cancun updates and a bunch of other technical things which, as I said, there's a screenshot of the wreak of a recap that Tim gave in discord here. So basically, I guess, like I can read through some of the things here, there was a debrief on Chappella TLdr.
00:00:42.902 - 00:01:16.606, Speaker A: Things went relatively smoothly. We saw a huge number of withdrawal credential changes, which caused, caused some initial networking issues. Now, I experienced this myself across some of my validators where my effectiveness went down. But it's back up today and it's back up to normal today, which is really great to see. Prism also had that bug, obviously, Lighthouse had their bug as well, where the high cpu issues that I talked about yesterday. There's a bunch of other things here that you can read that are obviously outside of Chappelle now that that's behind us. So I'll link this in the YouTube description below for you to check out.
00:01:16.606 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker A: As I said, you can check out both the agenda and the stream. All right, so just a few more things about Ethereum proof of stake and I guess like Shapala related things that I came across today that I felt was worth sharing. So data always has a good thread here with a bit of their thoughts on withdrawals so far, with data to back up their thoughts here. Now, I pretty sure they've put out a couple of posts on their substack about withdrawals before they went live, and they had a bunch of analysis that they did. So this is basically a post mortem of, of that using the relevant data to that, to what they're talking to here. So you can go check out this thread for yourself. Of course, I'll link it in the YouTube description below, but it's really cool to see, I guess like all the data surrounding this.
00:01:59.330 - 00:02:31.260, Speaker A: As I said post Chappelle, we would need to wait like a few weeks to see the data of things happening in a few months to see data around the great reshuffling that I've been talking about. And also, not everyone has enabled withdrawals yet. I believe Binance is still a few days out from enabling withdrawals. Obviously Lido isn't going to be doing it until next month. And this is full withdrawals. The partial withdrawals, as long as the credentials have been changed from zero x zero zero to zero x zero one, they're being automatically processed. But for full withdrawals, Binance still hasn't activated it.
00:02:31.260 - 00:03:01.932, Speaker A: Lido still hasn't activated it. I'm not sure about some of the smaller ones. I know Coinbase has. Obviously Kraken has, because we've seen a lot of unstaking from Kraken due to that regulatory action that was taken against them. But generally, yeah, those are the two biggest players left, Lido and Binance, which account for, I think, over 40% of validators on the network. So they are pretty big players. But at the same time, I don't know, just given the rest of the network, pretty much as we've seen, most of the exited validators came from Kraken.
00:03:01.932 - 00:03:36.086, Speaker A: I don't think there's going to be anything to really talk about once those withdrawals are enabled there. And you can actually exit both Lido staking and binance staking right now via their LSD, which isn't really trading at a discount. I mean, I think there's a very, very small discount which doesn't actually impact too much, obviously it, depending on your size, you know, if your size is size and you sell a bunch on the open market, it can lead to a steeper discount because of liquidity issues. But generally I think it should be okay for a lot of people. But yeah, anyway, you can go check out data. Always is thread recap here. I'll just link it in the YouTube description below.
00:03:36.086 - 00:04:04.740, Speaker A: It's not long. And then you can also check out their sub stack, which has a bunch of great analysis around this sorts of stuff. And I'm sure they're going to be doing a post shapala post pretty soon. All right, so I put out a tweet and I was just talking about the kraken unstaking. I put out a tweet where I said it's absolutely hilarious. At the most staked ETH being withdrawn by far is coming from Kraken, who is literally being forced by the SEC to unstake this ETH. Everyone else is just chilling and we have a net inflow of ETH interstaking right now.
00:04:04.740 - 00:04:56.502, Speaker A: Bears must be on life support. So the reason why I put this, this tweet out, because I was like looking at the withdrawal queue and I was, I was on raider.net work and I was looking at the, at the entities withdrawing and it was like 90% kraken. I'm like, okay, this is quite funny because if the only, I guess like big staker or I guess like big entity that is unstaking is the one that's literally being forced to do it by the US government, then I thought that was, was pretty hilarious. And as I just said, obviously binance and Lido haven't enabled full staking withdrawals yet, but you can exit those positions via, via selling their LSD's. So it's not even, I mean, I don't think it's going to make much of a difference, right. So just thinking about this and really putting it into perspective that for months and months and months people were saying, oh, you know, withdrawals is going to be extremely bearish for ETH.
00:04:56.502 - 00:05:29.248, Speaker A: Everyone's going to unstake. It's going to be a massive unstaking event. And then I look at the data and when I put this tweet out, we actually had a net inflow of ETH stake. And if you discount the fact that Kraken is unstaking, right. If you just remove them from the unstaking pool, then we have way more ETH going into staking than exiting staking. Because, and I think Kraken is just an outlier and it's an outlier that you're something that you should include in your analysis. But, but at the same time, I don't think that it's, it's providing much signal because I think a lot of those kraken stakers are just going to restake their ETH anyway.
00:05:29.248 - 00:05:55.318, Speaker A: Now, the new ETH state going in could be exactly that. So it's kind of balancing itself out there. But it's still funny to see that after the months and months of Fud and just the absolute stupidity of a lot of the fud that I saw, we basically did the complete opposite. We played the Uno reverse card on the bears. And as I said, they must be on life support at this point. Like, I don't know. I know that, you know, obviously the price has gone up and of course the price can go back down, um, from here.
00:05:55.318 - 00:06:23.172, Speaker A: Uh, but the funny thing is, is, is that I think we proved the bears wrong. We proved all the people that were fighting wrong. And I don't know, I just thought it was. Was quite funny. So that's why I put that tweet out there. Uh, and there was also another tweet that I put out, uh, with regards to Ethereum staking, uh, which was a coin, a term that was actually coined, uh, I believe, on the bankless episode by Ryan Sean Adams. And I put, I put a tweet out with this term by saying squad staking will be a big theme for ETH staking going forward.
00:06:23.172 - 00:06:47.364, Speaker A: Of course, the term, the term that was coined was, was squad staking. To individuals with. With less than 32 ETH, each can pull their assets together and run distributed validator technology on their own hardware in order to become a full validator. Decentralized staking takes many forms. Now, you guys know that I've been teasing a bunch of stuff around. Oh, boy. Which is obviously a decentralized validator, uh, technology are offering.
00:06:47.364 - 00:07:52.396, Speaker A: I've been playing around with that, uh, and I've been teasing about what I've been doing with them. I believe there's an announcement going out on Monday about that, and I'll be tweeting exactly what I've been teasing about, which you've probably already worked it out anyway, but it'll be out by then. Um, but generally what this kind of stuff enables is so it's not, it's not just. I mean, squad staking can take many forms as well. It's not just DVT, but I think that if you want to be a solo staker, but you don't have the necessary ETH to do that, obviously, 32 ETH is a large requirement. And say you have, like, three other friends and you all want to be solo stakers, but you've only got eight ETH each, or a bit more than eight ETH each, and you want to stake it, you can pull it together, and then each of you run the software on your own hardware, and then all of that software will talk to each other and become one full Ethereum validator. Now, this does not only allow you to squad stake with, with less than 32 ETH each year, obviously it still has to be 32 ETH to collateralize the validator, but it's, it's the culmination of all of your ETH.
00:07:52.396 - 00:08:30.256, Speaker A: You also get resiliency and redundancy here, because if, say, there's four of you doing it and one of the nodes goes offline, the other three are still going to be online, which means that you're still going to be attesting and proposing blocks. And that's why DVT is such an exciting technology because it allows for that extra resiliency and security. And if enough people adopted on the network and enough services adopted on the network, we're going to have a really, really resilient network, and it's going to hopefully lead to more solo staking. I would consider four friends running, you know, DVT with ETH pulled together as solo staking. Like, I mean, it's. It's called squad. Like I saying, it's.
00:08:30.256 - 00:08:56.551, Speaker A: It's squad staking here, but I would say it falls into the solo staking bucket. Now, of course, there are other ways of doing this as well. For example, with stakewise v three with their volts product, I could set up a vault called the daily gray community vault, or something like that, right? And I could say, hey, guys, you can stake your ETH with me. I'll run the validators. I'll run all the necessary software. I'll make sure, you know, it's all up and running. And all you have to do is deposit your ETH non custodially.
00:08:56.551 - 00:09:18.582, Speaker A: I don't have control over that ETH under the stakewise v three model. And then you can begin earning rewards like that. And you don't have to have 32 ETH for that either. You can do basically any amount of ETH. I don't know if there's a minimum with the v 3 volts, but I'm sure if there is, it's not very large, and you could do that as well. Now, would I consider this solo staking? No, I don't think so. Could it be considered squad staking? Yeah.
00:09:18.582 - 00:09:32.990, Speaker A: Yeah, to an extent. Right. But I think that when I think about, like, true squad staking, it's each of the members of the. The squad running the validator software, right? That's what DVT does. Whereas with the stakewise V three vault, you're not running the validator software. Only. I am.
00:09:32.990 - 00:09:59.378, Speaker A: If you. If you stake with me, if you pull with me, only I'm running it now. Of course, you can run it as a DVT cluster as well, right? You can. You can do the same thing here where essentially you have, like, I don't know, five people running it, and then people can pull together, or you make it a private vault, and you say to everyone that wants to stake with, stake their ETH, say, hey, you know, I'm creating this. This. This v three vault. Let's all run the software, and let's pull out ETH together, and we can run x amount of validators.
00:09:59.378 - 00:10:26.608, Speaker A: So as I said in my tweet, decentralized staking is, it takes many forms and obviously solo staking is the gold standard. But even solo staking is being kind of, kind of changed up a bit here with, with squad staking. So that's what I'm very excited about going forward. I know I've talked about DVT a bunch on the refuel already for, for a long time now. I've talked about oval network a lot. I mean, disclosure, you guys know I'm an investor in oval network. There's SSV, the secret shared validators network.
00:10:26.608 - 00:10:42.082, Speaker A: There's a couple of others. The names are kind of like escaping me right now. But this technology, as I've said before, is not theoretical. It's real. It's on main net right now and on testnet. So it's not like something that's going to come in a year's time. It's here.
00:10:42.082 - 00:11:29.270, Speaker A: And now that withdrawals are enabled, it's going to make it a lot easier people to get started doing this and to begin their squad staking journey. So I just thought this was really cool and it really helps the health of the beacon chain and the decentralization of the Ethereum network. All right, so superfuse shared a new website today that I hadn't seen before, all about the execution layer client diversity. So you can see here at execution diversity dot in Fo that they're tracking a bunch of different staking services and what execution clients that they are running. So this is quite fresh. I believe they're still indexing data here, but you can see the different services listed with the clients that they're running. So at the top here we have ETH pool, who apparently is 100% nevermind.
00:11:29.270 - 00:12:03.680, Speaker A: Then we have rocker pool, which is about 54% geth, 13% nevermind, 6.4% besuit and 26% unknown. As I said, some of the data is still being indexed here. Drop down to Lido, you've got like 88% geth and then a bunch of others as the minority, and then the rest of them you can see pretty much all 100% geth. Now of course, as we all know, Geth is still the dominant execution client on the network. It's not as dominant as it once was. It's come down from 90% dominance to around 60%, which is good because we're below that critical threshold of 66%, which is what we want to see.
00:12:03.680 - 00:12:40.120, Speaker A: But obviously we want to get that down even more. We want to get it down to basically the same that we see on the consensus layer side, where none of the consensus layer clients have more than 40%. Right now, if we can get to that, that'd be really cool. But to do that, we need to push these staking services to change now with the execution layer side of things, because a lot of them, like the execution clients such as Nethermine, Basil, and Aragon, haven't been as stable and resilient as Geth in the past. People are, I guess, like, not in a rush to change, so to speak. But in saying that, I have been talking about how I run, never mind. And it works.
00:12:40.120 - 00:12:58.586, Speaker A: Works fine for me. I've tried Basil and Aragon. They work fine, too. But I know people have had issues with them. So I think we're going to see more of a slow change here. But it is going to happen. And I would like to see even just these services here, that the ones that are all 100% geth, you know, just go to 50% geth and 50% nethermind or something like that.
00:12:58.586 - 00:13:36.736, Speaker A: Or go to, like, 80% geth and 20% nethermind. Right? So when I see this, I kind of, I think to myself, look, it's okay, because I understand why people do this, and I understand why steak and services are doing this, but we need to do better here, honestly, we need to do better for the resiliency and the security of the network. So I'm very glad that this website exists. As I said, I hadn't seen it before, so I'm not sure if it's, if it's new or not, but I believe it is. But, yeah, you can check this out for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, so I haven't spoken about the ultrasound money website in a little while now.
00:13:36.736 - 00:14:04.796, Speaker A: I actually realized this yesterday when I put this tweet out. I was like, wow, I haven't actually talked about the ETH burn in a while. And the thing is, is that, I mean, there's two reasons for that. One reason is because I think there's a lot of people already talking about it, and I kind of felt it was redundant for me to bring it up again. And two, ETH has been deflationary, and the ETH supply has been down only since January 16. So almost, almost three months now. And because of that, I kind of figured that it wasn't really news to talk about how ETH was net deflationary.
00:14:04.796 - 00:14:43.092, Speaker A: Now, I'm going to bring up the ultrasound money website here to get some real stat, uh, real real time data for you. So my screenshot shows that since January 16, ETH has been down only. The EId supply has been down only, obviously not, not the ETH price, but the heat supply. Um, and then like, it's just straight down, right? Like, uh, and then if you sort by since the merge, even like since the merge, it hasn't really inflated very much. We briefly went under and then came back up, but this is because we're basically above the ultrasound barrier at all times, which is quite incredible considering that it is still technically a kind of bear market. Right. There's not really much or any new people coming in.
00:14:43.092 - 00:15:18.684, Speaker A: So the fact that we, and we haven't reduced the scalability of layer one, ethereum, it's not like we've reduced the gas limit, which makes fees kind of go up, because there's the same amount of demand. It really is just demand continuing to go up naturally for layer one, even though we have these L2 solutions online right now, which are growing really quickly as well. I mean, I was looking at crypto fees dot in fo just before, and both arbitrarium and optimism are doing a crap ton of daily fees. Arbitrum is pretty high up there. I mean, if I get the actual. Should get the crypto fees dot in fo website up as well. So I can show you what I mean.
00:15:18.684 - 00:15:54.050, Speaker A: So look here, arbitrum one and optimism. So arbitram one is doing $225,000 of daily fees. The average over the last seven days is about one hundred eighty k, and optimism is 158k over the last day and 128k over the last seven days. Now, of course, this is also influenced by layer one ethereum fees because of that core data cost and that proof cost, obviously. But people are still paying to use these networks even though the fees aren't like super ultra cheap. Right. So that is a testament to the fact that there is a lot of demand right now from existing people in the ecosystem, which is obviously very, very awesome to see.
00:15:54.050 - 00:16:21.454, Speaker A: And you can actually go here and see what it's like over a longer timeframe. So if I go from the 1 January to today on arbitrum, actually, it seems to have bugged out here. But if we go back to, it's the 1 January, was it arbitrary? One fees were about twelve k. Right now we're what, three and a half months into the year? And arbitram one's daily fees are over 200k. That is a huge improvement. That is, that is almost a 20 x. Right.
00:16:21.454 - 00:16:38.010, Speaker A: So these things are growing and that means a theorem. Layer one is growing. I mean, we've. As you can see here, the ultrasound barrier has just been so. Sorry, the ultrasound barrier chart, where was it? I think. I'm sure that's the ultrasound barrier chart there. No, they must have changed it.
00:16:38.010 - 00:16:51.242, Speaker A: I think they're doing upgrades or something to the. Yeah, they're. They're doing upgrades for the fisherpala steel. But anyway, I. We've been mostly over the ultrasound barrier for. For most of the time here. And you can see the gas burners over the last seven days.
00:16:51.242 - 00:17:11.600, Speaker A: There's nothing new in here. These are all the same gas burners that we've been seeing for a while now. There's uniswap ETH transfers, opensea stable coins. Right. Last 30 days, and you can see arbitrum is actually in the top, top ten over the last 30 days. Its sequencer inbox, which is pretty bloody awesome to see. And optimism is not far behind there either.
00:17:11.600 - 00:17:37.444, Speaker A: And then if you do since the merge, you can see it still looks the same. Right, last day, still the same. So it's not like we have introduced a new ponzi onto the. Onto the chain or there's some demand coming for some particular app all of a sudden. No, this is real, sustainable, lasting demand that has lasted through the brutalities of the bear market. Still lasting to this day. And even.
00:17:37.444 - 00:17:59.764, Speaker A: And he still lasted on layer one, even though L2s are absorbing a lot of the users now, because they're like, the layer one fees, obviously, even at 20 Gwei, is very unaffordable for a lot of people. A uniswap trade at 20 guys, not cheap, right? I don't know the exact numbers off the top of my head right now, but it's. Even if it. Even if it's $5, right? Even if it's $10, that's not cheap. Like, that's. That's expensive. People are still paying it, of course.
00:17:59.764 - 00:18:36.254, Speaker A: But if you go to l two, actually, I can actually go to l two fees. Dot in fo here, which is a website that shows this sorts of stuff. You can actually see that a swap on Ethereum is $6 right now. Right on theorem l one on optimism and arbitrum, it's less than $0.30. So that's a pretty big reduction in fees. Obviously, it's not as cheap as it can be. And we'll get 48, 44, and further improvements to, um, these L2 networks, obviously, as time goes on, but people are still paying these layer one fees, and then the people who can't afford these fees or don't want to pay these fees because it's quite, quite ridiculous to pay them if you're just a regular user.
00:18:36.254 - 00:18:58.378, Speaker A: You're at L2. So Ethereum as a whole ecosystem has just been growing so much, especially over the last, I don't know, six months, which is just insane to me. So that's why I brought up this. ETH supply has been down only for three months now, because it just really signals all that natural demand for Ethereum. Because you can't fake this. You can't. This is real money being burnt.
00:18:58.378 - 00:19:46.374, Speaker A: As you guys know, 80%, 70% to 80% of all fair revenue is burnt. It's gone, it's never coming back. So to fake this, you would have to be a really, really, really deep pocketed person who for some reason wanted to spend upwards of many millions of dollars a day to fake this activity for what exactly? Maybe you think it's going to be bullish for Ethan. It'll pump your ETH bags, but you're burning ETH to pump your ETH back. So it doesn't make sense, right? I'm just trying to walk through the logic here because it doesn't make any sense at all. So from that perspective, that's why I always say that fear of a new, especially fair revenue that's burnt is the best metric to look at for natural demand. And now I say when burnt, because obviously, if the fear revenue isn't being burnt, it can be manipulated.
00:19:46.374 - 00:20:27.696, Speaker A: Let's say that you are on a dpos network and you're colluding with a bunch of other validators to say, hey, let's fake some activity, I'll pay the fee. And then once you collect the fee, you just kick it back to me. You just send it back to me. Right? And I'm sure this has happened on some of the, some networks in the past, but that is a possibility to happen all the time. But from that perspective, just looking at the fact that on Ethereum layer, 180 percent is burnt, there's, there's no faking going on here because it's just stupidly expensive to fake this. Like, you would run out of money extremely quickly, even if you were a billionaire, you would run out of money very quickly trying to fake this, this. And all you would be doing, I guess, as a public service to ETH holders, basically.
00:20:27.696 - 00:20:53.950, Speaker A: And you'd be like pushing like, public goods to eat holders, I guess, if you could call it that. But yeah, that's why I brought, brought all about this up and tweeted this out. But anyway, good to see the sustainable growth here. Sustainable, provable growth, not bullshit growth like tps and the amount of transactions on a network. I always thought they were crappy metrics. Active addresses, not great metrics. As I said, the best metric is fair value.
00:20:53.950 - 00:21:27.898, Speaker A: And nothing even comes close to ethereum. You can see here on cryptofees dot in fo. The next closest thing that's generating fear revenue is uniswap, or the next closest blockchain is bitcoin, and bitcoin is at 767,000 over the last seven over the last day, whereas Ethereum is at 7 million over the last day. So almost ten x more than bitcoin. And then the next is BNB, which is slightly below bitcoin here. So ethereum is leading by ten x, and the next after that is arbitrary and optimism. And then after that is avalanche, with only fifty five k of daily fear revenue.
00:21:27.898 - 00:21:46.864, Speaker A: Right, it's. And these are all EVM chains, still polygon Pos chain. Then you get the Solana at 43k over the last 24 hours. And that's it, like after. It's just hilarious how ahead of the pack ethereum is from this metric. And the fact that the l two S also very ahead of the pack as well, is great. But anyway, gonna leave that one at that.
00:21:46.864 - 00:22:34.770, Speaker A: I've got a bunch of other updates to get through here. So Rockerpool announced today that the Atlas smart contracts have been successfully verified and merged ahead of next week's launch. This means that they are now eligible for the immunifi bug bounty program, with rewards of up to $250,000 available. So if you are someone who wants to get into the code and wants to have a look at the new code as part of the Atlas upgrade and think you can find a bug, well, if you find a critical bug and you can produce a proof of concept here, you can stand to make up to $250,000. So I'll link this in the YouTube description below for you to go check out if this is up your, up your alley. But if you don't manage to find a critical bug and you still find a medium or a high level bug, you can get between five and $25,000 here. So, yeah, go check that out.
00:22:34.770 - 00:23:13.094, Speaker A: Atlas is going live in the next few days. So I guess I think this bug bounty lasts even after Atlas goes live. I'm not 100% sure on that, but I believe it does. So, yeah, it's not like a rush or anything like that. But if you do get it, if you do catch it before it goes live, I'm sure you'll get even more props for doing that. All right, so int Max, a project that I mentioned, I think a few weeks ago on the refuel, they partnered with scroll, when I mentioned them, have announced that they have raised a $5 million seed funding round to build their stateless ZK roll up. Now, of course I participated in this round and I say of course because I love funding.
00:23:13.094 - 00:23:34.138, Speaker A: Layer two things. I love being involved with everything. Layer twos. And Int. Max is actually building something that's novel and I haven't seen before. So what they're trying to build is a kind of roll up plasma hybrid. Now, for those of you who don't know what plasma is, this was a construction that basically came before rollups and was mostly abandoned in favor of rollups.
00:23:34.138 - 00:24:05.274, Speaker A: But the exploration of taking the, what was good about plasma and applying it to ZK rollups hasn't been done before. And that's exactly what Int Max is trying to do here, which obviously I see, you know, innovative things happening in the L2 space. I have to get all, I have to get all amongst her. I have to get all about it. So yeah, I guess congrats on the raise to them here. It's really great. They have a bunch of great people on board, such as Justin Drake here and Scott Moore from Gitcoin and a bunch of really great investors as well there.
00:24:05.274 - 00:24:26.994, Speaker A: And you can see all of them listed here. But if you want to learn more about InT. Max, you can go to their website. But also they've got an ETH research forum post that they've linked to on their Twitter page for back in October that explains exactly what they're trying to build here and what they're trying to do. So you can go check that out as well. It is quite technical, but as I said, this is kind of bleeding edge stuff. This is very innovative stuff here.
00:24:26.994 - 00:25:09.234, Speaker A: And it's reusing old ideas that just didn't work at the time but, but do work when you apply them to, to ZK roll ups here. So super, super exciting to see this. I'm a very happy investor in int Max here because I would really, I really would love to see this kind of in the wild and see people building on top of it and seeing what, how the builders and developers take advantage this new technology that's being deployed here. But as I said, you can go check out int Max for yourself. There is a medium post announcing the raise. Of course with relevant links to other things that you can go check out, such as the website here, which is at int Max IO. As you can see here, they've got information about what they are, what they're trying to do with a bunch of graphics and tables and things like that.
00:25:09.234 - 00:25:33.190, Speaker A: So. Yeah, and a roadmap, of course. So you can go check that out. I'll link that in the YouTube description below. All right, so Uniswap's mobile wallet is actually out of Apple jail. So you remember when Uniswap launched this a couple of months ago, they said that Apple wouldn't approve the Uniswap wallet for the App Store and you could only access it via testflight. So there's only, there was a 10,000 person limit on testflight.
00:25:33.190 - 00:26:15.008, Speaker A: I got access to it because I was in ethanva when they announced the wallet and they had access, they were giving out access there. But now anyone can access it from the App Store. So if you have an iOS device, you can go to the App Store and download this wallet for yourself and this can become possibly your new wallet. Now, I have discussed their wallet before, and right now it is very similar to Rainbow Wallet and very similar to Coinbase wallet. But I think that they want to make this kind of the premier wallet that people use, especially for swapping on Uniswap. And for, it's not, it's not necessarily targeted at crypto natives, it's definitely more targeted at crypto newbies, the ones who literally, you know, a very new to on chain stuff. And their first foray is probably something like uniswap.
00:26:15.008 - 00:26:38.964, Speaker A: And when they see something like uniswap wallet, they probably think to themselves, okay, Uniswap, trusted brand. I know that I'm gonna download the wallet. And then they greeted with like a pretty nice interface where they can see their nfts and stuff like that. And it's a trusted brand, obviously in Uniswap. I think this is gonna be very popular with them. So yeah, as I said, it is now live on the iOS App Store and you can go check it out for yourself. I'll link it in the YouTube description below.
00:26:38.964 - 00:27:20.272, Speaker A: All right, biconomy has a big announcement today. They have released their account abstraction kind of SDK here, or by con, sorry. They have released the account abstraction part of their biconomy SDK. So now developers can deploy gas efficient 4337 compliant smart contract accounts, set up verifying paymasters on Mainnet, and start sending user ops to biconomies bundlers via the SDK so this is a full account abstraction stack that developers can plug into. Now, this isn't just for Ethereum Mainnet. This is for pretty much like so many different EVM chains, whether they be layer ones or L2. And you can see the list of them here in the tweet.
00:27:20.272 - 00:27:43.604, Speaker A: There's obviously optimism and arbitram and this Polygon ZK EVM. There's even like other l ones, as I said, like Avalanche and BNB chain and the zksync. I mean, the full list is here. You can go check that out for yourself. But if you're a developer and you're interested in account abstraction, well, this is where I would be looking, that's for sure. Biocontamy is a very trusted name in the ecosystem and they're really great at what they do. So definitely go check this out for yourself.
00:27:43.604 - 00:28:06.984, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description below. All right, last up here is just a video that I saw from ETH Global of the ETH Tokyo hacker house. So look at all these people. Look at all these hackers. This is crazy, right? There's no bear market. What's a bear market to Ethereum? We've transcended bear markets. Remember me saying that after I came back from ETH Denver? We've definitely transcended them in my view.
00:28:06.984 - 00:28:27.134, Speaker A: But yeah, look at all these people. I'm just going through the video. This is crazy. And it's giving me crazy fomo because I absolutely love Japan. Last time I was there in 2019 for Defcon Osaka, I actually traveled around Japan. I went to Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. And as you guys know, I'm really into my, like, anime and figurines and, like, retro gaming consoles and things like that, as you can see behind me.
00:28:27.134 - 00:28:53.286, Speaker A: And that that hobby actually started in 2019 when I went to Tokyo and started buying my first figurines there. And then from there, it's just become an obsession. So I'm getting extreme fomo over the fact that there is an ETH conference in Tokyo and that I know that I could be in Tokyo and after the conference go and buy more figurines. Right. So anyway, I'm not going to go on about that too much there. But if you're there in, in Edith Tokyo right now, uh, do enjoy yourself. I mean, Japan is amazing.
00:28:53.286 - 00:29:18.626, Speaker A: Honestly, I love Japan. That's why it's probably, I think Japan as a whole was my favorite place that I've ever visited, to be honest. And I, I've said this to people before, but, uh, out of all the places I've visited, Japan is probably the only place I would consider ever living in. Uh, the other places that I've gone to, I didn't get the kind of vibe, and I was like, eh, I couldn't really live here. It's. Even if it's a nice place, I couldn't feel myself living there. But with Japan, especially Tokyo, I definitely did.
00:29:18.626 - 00:29:39.210, Speaker A: And it's funny because Tokyo is very, very different to. To Melbourne. It is much more fast paced than Melbourne, much more densely packed. It's extremely different. Not just obviously, the cultural and language barriers, but just a bunch of different things are very different to where I am right now. But I can still see myself living there. But anyway, as I said, I'm not going to go on about that for too much there.
00:29:39.210 - 00:29:49.284, Speaker A: I think I'm going to end it on that note for today. So thank everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
