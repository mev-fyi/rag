00:00:00.400 - 00:00:38.214, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cisano, and today's the 11 August 2021. Right, everyone, let's get into it. So the, I guess, like, infrastructure bill that we've been covering over, I guess last week or so, finally went to the Senate for a vote and they voted 69 to 30 to pass the bill with the original crypto tax provision intact, which you can kind of like see below in this link here. That'll be, this will be linked in the YouTube description. You can go check that out. And next up, the bill is going to go to the House, which is in recess until September 20, and we don't know yet if we'll have a chance to make amendments there to be TBD.
00:00:38.214 - 00:01:07.714, Speaker A: So this was Jake Chavinsky putting this out. He's been following this and I've been, you know, talking about his tweets on the refill a lot lately. This is the end of the road until September 20. You know, we're going to see how the, how the House shakes out there. But really, I mean, the house is going to pass this thing. It's just if we're going to be able to get amendments in before they do so for this crypto tax provision, then if that doesn't work, I think we're just going to have to battle it out in the courts for quite a while to see if we can get the language changed. But the original language was, was still really, really shitty.
00:01:07.714 - 00:01:35.866, Speaker A: Like, it was, it wasn't as bad as one of the amendments, but it was, it was really crappy. And that's why there were these amendments. Right. Um, but in general, it feels like people have just shrugged this off and being like, okay, well, if you guys are going to, you know, treat us like this, then screw you, we're going to outbuild you. We're going to keep, we're going to keep innovating here and keep building. The market doesn't really care. And I think people wisened up and we're like, okay, well, this doesn't go into effect for two years anyway, or till 2023 anyway, and there is still a chance that we can change this.
00:01:35.866 - 00:02:12.852, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, a lot of this is unenforceable anyway. So even if, like, the agencies wanted to take enforcement action against certain actors, it pretty much kind of, it wouldn't hold up in a court of law because it's just, it's, it's impossible to enforce. There's just no, um, you know, uh, a real way to do this enforcement and basically follow the language of this bill here. So I think, yeah, I mean, yes, there was a lot of noise made about it. Yes, it was good that people called their senators and everything like that. But generally, uh, I'm of the opinion that this is not going to be anything that, like, kills crypto or anything like that. And I feel like there is hope in the house and there is hope in the courts if we have to go there to get these amendments through.
00:02:12.852 - 00:02:38.914, Speaker A: Uh, so, yeah, don't lose kind of like hope here. Uh, the, the. I always look at the markets as kind of like the barometer of this sort of stuff. And if the markets don't care too much, it just seems like, uh, really, at the end of the day, most people are brushing this off. I think, you know, people aren't panic selling, and the markets have been really, really bullish throughout all of these, so it's been great to see that. But, yeah, that's, this is going to be, I guess, like the, probably the final word on this until September 20. So I'll be covering it next month when we get some movement on this.
00:02:38.914 - 00:03:11.866, Speaker A: But yeah, for now, it's kind of on ice, I think. So there was a hack, or an exploit, or whatever you want to call it, that went on last night, and it was the biggest kind of like, exploit in, I think, defi history, and I don't even think I would call it a defi hack. So what ended up happening was that this thing called poly network, so not polygon, poly network. It was like a cross chain kind of, I guess, bridge protocol, something like that. Or it had something to do with cross chain bridging. And I think there's about $611 million stolen in this, in this hack. So that was obviously very, very big.
00:03:11.866 - 00:03:40.182, Speaker A: You know, people were watching kind of like this play out in real time on chain where you could actually see what the hacker was doing, kind of where they were sending the funds to. They sent some to curve, and then they were kind of like the USDT that they had got frozen, and someone actually sent a message to them saying, hey, your USDT's frozen. Stop trying to, trying to move it. And then the hacker actually sent this person 1.337 8th yes, which was, which was quite funny. Sorry, 13.37 ETH, which is, which is quite a lot of money there.
00:03:40.182 - 00:04:06.866, Speaker A: It's like 40 grand or something like that. And then that person ended up sending like 1.37 ETH to Vitalik or something, or all of, I don't know, something, something funny. Like, it was just weird watching this all play out. But in terms of what happened with the actual exploit itself, there's this great thread here from Calvin Fichter, who I believe works with optimism, but he basically explained how the hack work. Now, the TLDR here is that, I mean, obviously the code, the code was not correct. It was done in an insecure way.
00:04:06.866 - 00:04:40.196, Speaker A: And what ended up happening was that this attacker was able to, where was it here. Basically, without compromising the private key, they were able to craft the right data and just hijack the contract. So essentially, I guess like change the keys in the contract and give them controls over it and able to kind of like steal the funds. Now I, you know, I'm probably like butchering that explanation there. But this thread goes into detail about it and technical detail as well. Um, but yeah, essentially this was like quite a big hack. And then in the end it was funny because like, uh, the attacker has started to return the funds now to, uh, you know, to, to poly network.
00:04:40.196 - 00:05:11.130, Speaker A: And I think so far they have returned, I think it was something like $40 million worth of the funds or something like that. This story just keeps getting updated. I've seen it updated a few times. Um, but yeah, they're returning the funds. But also what ended up happening was that this attacker actually got identified. Uh, you know, some, one of the accounts, uh, I can't remember which account it was, but one account I saw on Twitter twitted out saying, you know, we've identified this person, we know their IP address, whatever, blah, blah, blah. And I think that caused the attacker to basically panic and be like, oh crap, like, you know, basically they found this exploit, but they were really amateur about their Opsec.
00:05:11.130 - 00:05:57.538, Speaker A: Apparently they had sent funds from a centralized exchange, which, which they had Kyc on to the address that they perform the exploit with and we're moving funds to. So this whole thing was just like complete amateur hour. Um, and what was hilarious as well, at least, I mean, not hilarious, people lost money, but was hilarious to me, is that no one had heard of this project on Twitter, like poly network or o three whatever. Apparently it was part of the neo ecosystem and like the ontology ecosystem and things like that, but no one that I know had ever heard of this. Like, I talked to heaps of people about this. Everyone's like, how did this project have so many, so many, so much funds in it? And it actually spoke to the East west divide that we're seeing in crypto, and this project was based in Asia, like, and a lot of the users were based there and were kind of like either from China or other parts of Asia, kind of interacting with this. And that's where all the money came from.
00:05:57.538 - 00:06:39.460, Speaker A: And it really just shows, like, how big of a divide there still is between those markets. Now, whether that's because of the language barrier or the cultural barrier, I think it's a bit of both. But it's just insane to me that literally no one that I spoke to who pretty much all of them, I guess, like, were based, based in the US or Europe, some of them are in Southeast Asia, but things like that. But I think this was like, heavily heavy, had heavy chinese users in there, but essentially, like, none of them had heard of this ever. And it's just weird that there was, like, this much money in there and people hadn't heard of it. And so this whole thing was just like, very, very weird. But I guess, like, good that the attack is returning the funds here, but I, I don't think that's going to spare them from any kind of repercussions.
00:06:39.460 - 00:07:19.512, Speaker A: If they actually are kind of like doxxed. If they are known and they have been found out, well, then they're definitely going to face repercussions here, whether that be through the legal system or kind of like, you know, someone just kind of doxing them publicly and basically, you know, they'll be on the run for the rest of their life or something like that. Something crazy. It's just this whole thing has just been wild to witness. And I wrote a bit more about this in the Deli Gwei newsletter today, where I basically explained that these things are like real time heists, right? Where as soon as the first announcement is made on Twitter that a hack has happened, everyone in the world can automatically see it and follow it. Like, you could go on Etherscan, follow along with transactions, you know, follow along in any messages being sent. And there's people updating it.
00:07:19.512 - 00:07:44.160, Speaker A: I mean, the blocks really fast here. They update that. They put the story out and they update it. Then there's people breaking down what the, what exploit actually happened and everything like that. And this is all done within a few hours. Whereas if you were to try and do try to monitor something like this in a traditional finance system, you wouldn't even hear about it for a couple of years because it would be completely opaque. You know, it would be an internal thing where everyone would be kind of internally would be trying to fix this.
00:07:44.160 - 00:08:35.814, Speaker A: And you'd never kind of like, hear about it until the end, where maybe someone got fined or, look, there was a slap on the wrist or maybe someone went to jail or something like that, and you really have no idea. Whereas within hours, you just basically have a full diagnosis and analysis of what happened during one of these kind of like hacks or exploits or, or rug pulls, whatever you want to call them, which I think is just absolutely, really cool about crypto. I just think it's, it's awesome that we can, we can learn from these hacks and learn from these exploits really quickly and, and essentially, um, be able to kind of like, piece together an analysis in just like, such record time. I mean, I think within a couple of hours, there were already early preliminary analysis on, on these sorts of, on this kind of like, exploit here, which I thought was pretty cool. But yeah, I think that's like the TRDR there on everything. The block has probably some of the best coverage on this, so you should definitely go check out their coverage on it. But, yeah, I'm going to live it at that for now.
00:08:35.814 - 00:09:23.986, Speaker A: And I'll probably talk about this more if there's any kind of like, updates on this throughout the week. So Frank Chaparro from the block put out a tweet today saying that Coinbase has confirmed that he's been working with Elon Musk, SpaceX and Tesla. And as part of their Q two earnings, the firm said that it counts ten out of the top 100 hedge funds as its clients. Dan Loeb's third point is a client, according to the firm as well. And you go, you can see the actual release here on the block. It's basically a kind of like news release here from frank detailing this in a bit more kind of like detail there. And on top of that, I think here, John Ginty posted here from, from coinmetrics saying that the, the percentage of ETH traded on Coinbase was actually more than the percentage of ETH traded for Q two, I believe, of 2020, 2021.
00:09:23.986 - 00:09:57.872, Speaker A: You can see here, ETH accounted for 26%, bitcoin accounted for 24%, which. And I, you know, I commented here saying, you know, this is just another flipping under eats belt, because at this point in time, Ethan Ethereum has flipped bitcoin in pretty much every conceivable metric. I mean, if you really think about it, the only thing left is market cap. And I think that's coming sooner rather than later for a variety of reasons, obviously. I obviously, truly believe in the flip winning and stuff like that, but it's just insane to see, like, how far this has come. Like, no longer is ETH the underdog to bitcoin. I think bitcoin is pretty much becoming the underdog to Ethereum.
00:09:57.872 - 00:10:34.850, Speaker A: And, and at the end of the day, it has no chance of kind of catching up with it. There's no kind of, like, innovation happening there. And if there is, it takes lots and lots of time to even just innovate on small things. Like, for example, I'm pretty sure taproot had been in development and research for as long as 1559, if not longer. And taproot really didn't do anything big for the bitcoin network. It was more of a smaller upgrade, and it took, you know, about the same amount of time, if not longer, than 1559, to be implemented, whereas 1559 actually did, you know, a huge thing for the right. It started, but it's working to fix the ethereum fee market.
00:10:34.850 - 00:11:04.588, Speaker A: And also it's. It started burning ETH, drove direct value back to ETH holders. So just, like, contrasting the two, there is a pretty big deal, I think, but, yeah, I mean, just pretty insane to see, like, how far ETH has come. I mean, you can see here the percentage, like, has been catching up over time. You can see in Q two of 2020, which is just a year ago, bitcoin accounted for 57% of the trading volume on coinbase, and with Ethereum only counting for 15%, and now, like, it's much bigger. And also, the other crypto assets category has. Has ballooned to 50%.
00:11:04.588 - 00:11:41.518, Speaker A: But that's been constant, I guess, over the last few months. But generally, you know, that's the thing you want to watch, like, who's the king of these kind of markets? And I've been noticing this as well, like, watching the markets and things like that. I mean, I'm not a trader, but I do kind of like to watch the volumes and stuff like that because that, that definitely tells a story about, like, what assets people are interested in trading. And I think just more people are interested in trading ethics, you know, buying ETH, like investing in Ethan. A lot of people are buying ETH because they need that to do things on the Ethereum network. And now that we're burning this ETH, we're literally removing ETH from the active floating supply because people have to buy ETH from the floating supply to use as gas fees. And then most of that, it gets burned.
00:11:41.518 - 00:12:25.730, Speaker A: It's just quite amazing to see how that's been playing out. And I guess, like, on the 1559 note, as well, the ultrasound money website has now been updated. You have a 1 hour burn leaderboard, two extra burn leaderboard rows, fee burn time ranges, 1 hour, 24 hours, et cetera, and burn rate in ETH per minute here. So this is quite cool that they're still updating it here. And another tweet from ultrasound money they put out today was that there was a new burn records. 50 ETH, or almost 50 ETH was burnt in a single block, which I like to call an ultrasound block, because obviously we burn more. Ethan, we issued, because only two ETH is issued per block, and there was 624 ETH burned in five minutes as well.
00:12:25.730 - 00:13:16.336, Speaker A: Because when that up, what ended up happening? That there was this NFT drop today from voxels or something like that. And obviously people, like, tried to fomo in and whatever, and a lot of it got burned because of that. So now, as I've been saying, like, for before 1559 went live, I was like, you know, I hope these NFT projects just wait till it's live because then we can just burn ETH and, you know, we can basically have, like, positive externality from the gas fees skyrocketing in price here. But, yeah, I mean, and then they said ultramark 150, which means that it was, like, extremely deflationary for that period of time, which was, which was quite cool to see. There's more 1559 stuff I wanted to talk about. Yes. So here from Alex from Nansen said that around half of all newly issued ETH since 1559 was rolled out has already been burned, which is crazy, right? I mean, you can see here, new issued ETH was 50,000 and the burn was 25,000.
00:13:16.336 - 00:13:54.636, Speaker A: So essentially the burn is accounting for 50% of the total issuance, which means we've already dropped issuance. We basically did a bitcoin halvening. Right, like where whenever the bitcoin halving happens, it drops issuance by 50% from the block reward. But we've essentially done it by not reducing the block reward but reducing the total kind of like supply going to miners because we're burning that in fee revenue. But also, like, as I've been talking about a lot, you know, over the past few refills with, when the merge happens, we're going to be doing three of these bad boys plus 1559. And I, and I put out a tweet today saying 1559 was the appetizer. The merge is the main course.
00:13:54.636 - 00:14:20.736, Speaker A: That is what all of this is working towards, and we're going to be dropping it by 90%. Issue. It's dropping issuance by 90% and having a triple harvesting here. So at this point in time, ETH is already net deflationary if you account for like, the proof of stake issuance and not the proof of work issuance. Uh, so yeah, just really, really cool to see that as well. And then also, this blew my mind today. Like, I had already known that, uh, that Ethereum was doing much more fee revenue than bitcoin was doing.
00:14:20.736 - 00:14:49.076, Speaker A: But when I compared these numbers like this, it absolutely blew my mind. So I put out this tweet where I said, the Ethereum network has burned $80 million worth of ETH fee revenue over the last six days. So it's been six days since 1559 went live. And the bitcoin network has only generated $3.6 million worth of fees over the same time period with no BTC being burned. So that fee revenue doesn't really mean anything, right? That's just going to miners to be dumped. Whereas Ethereum burned $80 million with the fee revenue.
00:14:49.076 - 00:15:31.668, Speaker A: But there was still another kind of, I guess like 30% or more of that, or 25%, maybe more that was still went to miners. Right. So we probably had over $100 million worth of fee revenue over the last six days, of which 75% of it was burned, which is just insane to me. Like, it just, it's so crazy to me that bitcoin relies on fee revenue for its security, whereas Ethereum is not going to, because it's going to have a perpetual, perpetual block reward in, even under proof of stake. But the bitcoin network just really isn't being used at all. I think the 24 hours fees for bitcoin, the bitcoin network is $600,000, whereas for Ethereum today it was $25 million. So it's just absolutely insane to see the difference here.
00:15:31.668 - 00:16:07.924, Speaker A: And, you know, this difference over the last six days is a 22 times difference. So Ethereum is, is burning 22 times more fee revenue than the bitcoin network is actually generating in that kind of like, same period of time there. So really, I mean, as Eric says here, it's almost as if trying to improve the protocol instead of reading it as a sacred text is beneficial. And that's what Ethereum has always been about. We're not like, okay, well, this was the monetary policy at the start, we're going to keep it that way forever because that's the right way to do it. No, we're going to keep iterating, we're going to keep improving, which I think is really, really positive, obviously. And I just think it's mind blowing when you put these things side by side.
00:16:07.924 - 00:16:34.806, Speaker A: And, I mean, I don't like to compare ethereum to bitcoin too much because I really do think it's, it really is comparing apples and oranges. But at the end of the day, I think Ethereum is going to be much bigger than bitcoin anyway. And bitcoin is just like one stepping stone on Ethereum's dominance, dominance metrics. Because I think I've been saying for a while that once Ethereum flips bitcoin, the narratives are going to change substantially. And that's it. Like, I don't actually think a lot of Ethereum people are going to talk about bitcoin anymore, really. I think it just becomes not.
00:16:34.806 - 00:17:09.522, Speaker A: Not to bash it too much, but I really just didn't think it becomes irrelevant. Like, what does? Like, if bitcoin's no longer number one, like, why would people want to buy? Like, I'm not going to get into it. Like, but I just don't understand, like, if you say bitcoin is number two, then all these narratives kind of like, fall apart. Like, you know, bitcoin being the best, you know, stack sats are out, you lose, like, everything else. Like, trading altcoins is stupid or whatever, you lose money. Like, all these narratives just completely fall apart and become just like, like anyone spouting them off just becomes viewed as being insane. And I think a lot of people kind of like, who are on, you know, in the camp of saying, you know, bitcoin can never be dethroned.
00:17:09.522 - 00:17:20.842, Speaker A: Well, they're going to have like, a coming to Jesus moment. Like, I think. But anyway, I'm going to. I'm going to leave it at that for now. I wonder if I have anything else. No, that was it, about 1559. So there's a few more project updates to get through.
00:17:20.842 - 00:18:21.432, Speaker A: Lemonade Alpha, who is basically an index co op community member, put out today that in 2021, index index co ops unincentivized TvL as an under management that are not taking advantage of incentive programs, aka liquidity mining, has grown from 11 million to 257,000,047% of total Tvl to 93%. So I love this metric. So I've spoken about this on the refill before, but what this metric tracks is basically, say you have a protocol that's doing liquidity mining and say 90% of the liquidity in there is only in there because it's mining those token rewards. Well, then you can have relative certainty that if those mining, if those liquidity mining rewards go away, most of that liquidity is also going away. Now the beautiful thing about the index co op is that they've been really focused on this unincentivized TVL metric, which essentially says, which essentially is at 93% now. So 93% of the total TVL as part of the index co op is not farming, is not part of any liquidity mining programs. There is no incentives in there.
00:18:21.432 - 00:19:19.084, Speaker A: It's literally just people buying the product or investing in the product because they actually want to do it, not because they're getting some kind of token out of it, which I think is the metric that every project should be tracking. I don't think this should just be exclusive to index cop. I think we should be ranking every project based on their unincentivized TVL. Because it's very, very easy if you're, if you're a defi project to issue a token or to do liquidity mining incentives and say you have all this TVL, but really as soon as those incentives dry up, you'll take a lot of the time that most of that TVL is gonna leave. And it really just doesn't, doesn't help anyone for you to kind of like, I guess say you have all this TVL because you have a token sort of thing. So, yeah, I just wanted to kind of point that metric out again. I think it's one of the best that we have for measuring kind of like actual total value, you know, real, you know, organic total value locked in these protocols, rather than something that essentially is only there to earn some, some kind of like tokens, you know, farm and dump and then kind of like leave the protocol.
00:19:19.084 - 00:20:05.390, Speaker A: So hop protocol announced a kind of another feature for their bridge today, where you can now withdraw matic tokens instantly from polygon to Ethereum or XDai without having to wait seven days. So this is a first for the matic token, as they're saying here. And this is a light litmus test for hop to access demand for fast exit. So I guess they're trying to, they're trying to two prong that approach here. They're trying to see like how much demand there actually is for instant withdrawals of something, of tokens from polygon to ethereum or xdai, and also testing it for the manic token and then kind of like extrapolating it from there and saying, okay, well, let's, let's add other tokens to this and we can do instant withdrawals to, with this as well. So this is really cool. And you know, I was just talking about liquidity mining.
00:20:05.390 - 00:20:33.000, Speaker A: Well, I think it. Okay, so maybe I'll take a step back with liquidity mining. I don't want to say that liquidity mining is a bad thing. I think it can actually help to bootstrap liquidity for things that kind of like need bootstrapping. For example, a bridge protocol, like hop protocol needs to bootstrap liquidity for these, these pools in order to offer those instant exits. Because the way hop works is essentially it has a pool called hmatic and matic on the amm. And what ends up happening is that hmatic is stands for hotmatic.
00:20:33.000 - 00:21:05.966, Speaker A: And that's like a token that the liquidity providers take on instead of like the matic. And then the end user gets the matic. And at the end, after the seven day withdrawal period is done, the liquidity providers get that matic and they swap the h matic for it and whatever. So that's the only way that you can kind of like get around that is basically someone else takes on the risk of this kind of seven day withdrawal period or whatever. But in order to boost up liquidity there, you need to put liquidity mining on there. And that's what they've done. They're going to be distributing $400,000 worth of matic to attract and sustain deep liquidity in that pool.
00:21:05.966 - 00:21:47.626, Speaker A: And I think this is the proper way to use it. You shouldn't use it as a way to attract liquidity just for the sake of attracting liquidity. You should have a goal in mind about what you want to do. And, you know, I worked with the index cop early on because I was working at set early on. And we actually had a targeted approach here where we said, we're going to revisit the liquidity mining program once a month, and we're going to make sure that it's only for the, for the DeFi pulse index originally. We're going to make sure that we're only incentivizing it enough and then slowly wean people off it and we can see who actually wants to be in there and who actually wants to hold the DeFI pulse index rather than who's just there for farming. And it was just a way to bootstrap liquidity for the DPI as well, which I thought was a pretty good way of doing it.
00:21:47.626 - 00:22:32.788, Speaker A: And it's the same thing with a hot protocol, is doing it here. So yeah, I love seeing kind of stuff like that, and I love seeing these bridges go live. I mean, speaking of bridges, like biconomy also put out a bridge yesterday. They announced hyphen, which is, which is they're calling instant cross chain transfers, which is what I'm calling a bridge. And starting with USDC and USDT, you can now transfer between Ethereum and Polygon in seconds by using this tool. So I mean, how many bridges do we have now? Right? Like Connext, hot protocol seller network, biconomy, Starkware announced a bridge the other day. I'm sure there's others that I'm forgetting off the top of my head, but like we now have at least five bridges between, I mean they're all doing between like Ethereum and Polygon, but, but pretty soon they're all going to be adding these l two s, like optimism and arbitrary and things like that as well.
00:22:32.788 - 00:23:04.240, Speaker A: So, um, you know, we just have so many options now. It's just amazing. People were kind of like talking about, oh, all the liquidity is going to get fragmented because of like l two s and cross chain stuff. Like, um, it's going to be a bad user experience. But there's already all of these solutions coming to life and basically, um, already live and, and letting people kind of like transfer the assets to actually care about transferring quickly. Because really at the end of the day, you don't really care too much about transferring every asset quickly in and out. Because on a lot of these L2s, you'll have ways to trade in and out of them.
00:23:04.240 - 00:23:59.334, Speaker A: So say you have some random ERC 20 token and you want to trade it for ETH or some stablecoin. Well, you'll be able to do that on the L2 and then you'll say to yourself, okay, well, I want to get these funds out of L2 and onto a centralized exchange or to cash to fiat, or I want to go to layer one to do something else that I can't do on L2 right now. Well, most of the time people are only going to care about transferring out stable coins and ETH. So that's, that's why a lot of these projects are starting with ETH and stable coins first rather than all these other random ESA 20 tokens. And as I said, the way a lot of these bridges work, or pretty much all of them work, is that they have liquidity pools that sit in the middle between these chains. And basically they have people taking on the risk or liquidity providers taking on the risk in there. So, you know, bootstrapping that for like pretty much every token is going to be very, very hard, whereas doing it for USDT or doing it for stable coins and ETH and other popular assets, like maybe wrapped bitcoin and things like that, would, is the, is the kind of right approach, I think so.
00:23:59.334 - 00:24:18.750, Speaker A: I'm really glad to see all this playing out. I mean, I'm, I'm super excited. Like, when arbitrum goes live, I think it's going to be a real test of, of these bridges, too, because they're all going to add arbitrum support. I mean, I think the bridges are already getting a lot of usage with polygon because polygon is heavily used. Uh, we already have, like, a single bridge as well. Like, um, Ronin going to axie, um, infinity. Uh, sorry, sorry.
00:24:18.750 - 00:24:45.554, Speaker A: Axie Infinity's bridge going from ethereum to, to Ronin. They call it the Ronin bridge because Ronin. Ronin is their side chain that's getting heavy, heavy usage. I mean, that's one of the top ETH burners. That's how you can kind of tell it's getting heavy usage. So, yeah, I mean, the bridge ecosystem is growing, and it's going to be, like, mature before we even have probably most of the l two s mature, which is quite amazing to see. And I'm really glad to see that the infrastructure is kind of coming to life much faster than I think a lot of people thought it would.
00:24:45.554 - 00:25:33.454, Speaker A: So this new project that launched yesterday, paperclip Dow, caught my interest because what they're trying to do, from my understanding, is they're trying to trade up this DAO is trying to trade themselves up to a rare NFT or like, a really expensive NFT. Now, the reason why they called paperclip Dow is because some of you may not have heard of this story. I don't know if this story is true or not, but there was a story, if you search, like, paperclip trading up to a house or something like that, you'll probably be able to read it. But the TLDR is that apparently some guy started off with a paperclip, right? And he trade, kept trading that paperclip for father. Sorry. He traded that paperclip for another item, and then he traded that item for another one, and he kept trading for more and more valuable items until eventually he got to a house. So the story goes that he traded out from a paperclip to a house by doing this.
00:25:33.454 - 00:26:31.970, Speaker A: Now, that's where paperclip Dow comes in, where they basically say, oh, okay, let's start with, like a really kind of, I guess, like valueless kind of NFT. And then let's trade ourselves up to, like, a really valuable one while going through the motions here, which I think is pretty cool, right? Like, I think this is a cool concept. And there's also, like, these things of, of clip tokens here that anyone who successfully trades with the paperclip Dao gets clip tokens so they can actually join the DAO and continue to create the story. So essentially, it works as like a two pronged approach here where people can trade into these NFTs or kind of like into the dao by going to sudo swap, which is like a trade matching kind of engine, and they can also join paperclipdao by doing these trades. Right. So it's like a two pronged approach to get more people involved. And the more people involved in the Dow, the more trades that go on, you know, the more chance there is of trading themselves up to a better kind of like better NfT and a rare NFT.
00:26:31.970 - 00:26:58.398, Speaker A: And, you know, you could imagine the logical conclusion here. Imagine if the pay per clip dial gets so big that they trade themselves up to a alien crypto punk, like $100 million or something like that. I mean, who knows if it's going to get that, that wild. But I think bringing that story that I just told you guys about to Ethereum is really interesting. And that's why this kind of caught my eye here. And I mean, also, like the link artwork, I mean, I love Zelda, so I'm a sucker for, for that kind of artwork. It just draws me in.
00:26:58.398 - 00:27:15.834, Speaker A: But, yeah, cool to see this project. I'm going to be following along with it. Maybe I'll join the Dao as well. I haven't done a trade with them yet, but I might join the Dao here as well. It seems like a very, very cool, cool project. So super Rare is teasing their token. They say that they have exciting news coming Thursday, which is tomorrow.
00:27:15.834 - 00:27:48.086, Speaker A: I mean, I've been telling you guys for a while, every single project that he's got anything to do with crypto is going to have a token eventually. We just saw Dy DX the other day, announced their token. Super Rare is now teasing their token. I mean, I, you know, open, I've said opens. Like, all these NFT platforms are going to have tokens like Opensea and, and, you know, make his place and foundation and all those sorts of things. They're all going to eventually have tokens, but super Rare is one of the older, I think, NFT platforms. They definitely, they focused on art, so they're focused on, like curating art pieces rather than being an open marketplace like something like Opensea.
00:27:48.086 - 00:28:35.746, Speaker A: But it's pretty cool that they're going to basically have a token as well. I think generally I'm very pro token because I think tokens are a great coordination mechanism and I think they're going to have like an airdrop as well. I mean, at this point in time, if you don't have an airdrop to your early users, at least you kind of like shoot yourself in the foot. I don't think people, I think people lose interest if you don't airdrop them a token if they were an early user of your platform, because they're basically like, well, I got rugged. I deserve tokens. I mean, there's a little bit of entitled, a little bit of entitlement there, but I think it's deserved because if you really did, like help bootstrap the platform early on, you know, whether that's kind of like buying and selling nfts on there or becoming an artist on there, you really should get, you know, a share of, I guess, like the pie when they decide to tokenize. And I think a lot of projects get this, and a lot of projects are doing these airdrops.
00:28:35.746 - 00:29:22.938, Speaker A: So I would expect super rare to be doing an airdrop now, that's not to say that you can go on super rare right now, start buying and selling nfts in anticipation of this airdrop. I'm pretty sure they would have already taken the snapshot before they announced that they have a token coming. So yeah, you might get rugged if you try to do it. Now, if you're just trying to buy and sell nfts on there in order to get this token. So I'm not suggesting you do that, but for those of you who have done this kind of like previously, I mean, I've bought an artwork on there, so, you know, I'm looking forward to getting a bit of tokens as well. But you'll probably get tokens, but we'll have to see, you know, I'll be reporting on this on, I guess, like Thursday, maybe Thursday, maybe Friday's refuel and seeing what they have in store for us at super rare. All right, last up here, just a quick shout out to ETH Global, who have announced their biggest event of the year, which is ETH online.
00:29:22.938 - 00:29:59.074, Speaker A: So any hackers or any developers that want to get involved with this hackathon, you'll be able to join all your fellow hackers from around the world from September 17 to October 15 to compete for over $150,000 worth of prizes and build the future of web3. You can sign up now at online dot ETH global.com. I know that sounded like a little bit like an advertisement, but I am not paid by ETH Global or anything like that. But I am a judge. I have been a judge multiple times on ETH global hackathons, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be a judge at ETH online as well. So I'm really excited for this. And really, I mean, this is the best way to get your project in front of people that you would really love to get it in front of.
00:29:59.074 - 00:30:23.884, Speaker A: The judges that they have. The speakers that they have are just like awesome, you know, some of the most amazing ethereum community members and you, and you'll get some of the best mentoring as well while kind of like participating in this. So if you're a dev or want to be a devil, we just want to build something cool online dot it quote s global.com sign up there. And as I said, it starts on September 17. So you still got a bit of time. About a month out, maybe five weeks out from here, but yeah, go sign up if you're interested in that.
00:30:23.884 - 00:30:34.084, Speaker A: But I think that's it for today. So thank you everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
