00:00:00.240 - 00:00:34.166, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Deli Gwei refuel, where recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Zosano, and today's the 30 May 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So I just wanted to talk through something that I kind of saw over the weekend, which was kind of like a bear thesis for ETH. Posted by Andrew Kang, who works at Mechanism Capital here, a fund in the crypto space. Now he's got kind of like a screenshot of a bunch of dot points here that he posted to Twitter, kind of giving his, I guess, bear case for Ethan. He starts by saying ETH has major, has a major flows imbalance.
00:00:34.166 - 00:01:20.894, Speaker A: Now what I want to do is kind of run through each of these points and kind of like teach you guys how I go through these sorts of things and how I reason about it and how I can kind of really quickly kind of like come up with the conclusion that it's basically fud. And you know, funny enough, he actually posted this kind of like at the bottom of kind of like ETH, like the 1700 bottom that we just had. Like, I don't know if that's going to hold, but he posted and then we started going up again. So I was like, you know, this is hilarious that the timing here, but, but basically I want to go through each of these points. So what he, what he kind of like means by a major flows imbalance here is he means that there's more people, well, he believes that there's a lot more people selling than buying. And he kind of starts by saying, you know, these are the people that kind of like a buying ETH right now. And he says short term scalpers because round numbers, fading sentiment, et cetera, aka the short term traders.
00:01:20.894 - 00:01:53.646, Speaker A: Right? And then the second point is no one else because all other ETH believers deployed their dip capital in previous 1000 dips. Now look, he's literally just kind of like given two points with no data to back it up at all. He's just like said things. So that's the first thing that, that always kind of goes off my head. It's like, okay, well, anyone can say whatever they want, but is there actual data backing this up? Is there actually kind of like a thesis behind there? Is there actually kind of like any reasoning behind it at all? And really there isn't. So kind of like when, when he, when he said this, I was just like, okay, this doesn't really make much sense. Like there's no data backing this up.
00:01:53.646 - 00:02:38.186, Speaker A: Like, what are you even trying to say here? And then he goes on, you know, who are the people selling? And this is even worse. Like he says, institutions that realize ETH market opportunity is below expectations. The fundamentals are deteriorating, such as network activity and fees and growth inverting. Okay? So, like, when I see something like this, I just, I'm puzzled, because if you baseline, I guess, like network activity across every single network right now, you know, in crypto, whether it be ethereum, bitcoin, any other network out there, then you look at what the kind of market is in. Like we're in a bear market, obviously, and you baseline it to that. Then obviously network activity is going to be down. Like, the less people that are in the ecosystem, the less activity that's going to be on chain, the less fees Ethereum is going to be generating, as an example here.
00:02:38.186 - 00:03:10.220, Speaker A: And then that's kind of like what's going to happen, right? Their network is just going to kind of be used less. So network activity goes down, but you got to baseline it to the market that we're in. If Ethereum's network activity was going down during a bull market, then I would say that Andrew has a point, but it's not. It's going down in line with general market sentiment, general market activity. So, and then, you know, just the broader point of saying fundamentals deteriorating. But what do you mean? Like, what do you mean fundamentals deteriorating? Nothing has fundamentally changed for Ethereum at all. Like, the roadmap hasn't changed just because the price went down.
00:03:10.220 - 00:03:38.382, Speaker A: The merge timeline hasn't time, maybe not timeline. I'm gonna talk about the merge in a bit. But, like, the merge hasn't changed. Like, it's still happening, right? The L2 ecosystem still kind of like happening. Like, like when I see these sorts of things, I just get so puzzled. I'm like, what fundamentals are you talking about? Network activity and fees? Well, yeah, they go down or up, depending on what the market is doing. Like, that's just what happens because these networks are economic, financial networks, less new money coming in, or I guess like less market activity, less activity on the chain.
00:03:38.382 - 00:03:59.066, Speaker A: I don't know why this is hard for some people to kind of like, get. And then, you know, he says, growth inverting. I mean, we had lots of growth and now we have a bear market. So let's baseline it. Are we over the long term higher than what we were? We are, right? The growth is still there. The network activity is still there. Ethereum is still generating millions of dollars a day in kind of like fear revenue at layer one, L2s are still growing.
00:03:59.066 - 00:04:38.148, Speaker A: Yeah. So I just don't think that's a point at all, really. And then he goes on to say other people selling include institutions that got wrecked by Luna and other assets need to reduce risk and all getting net outflows from LP redemptions. Now if you don't know, kind of like how the fund and VC kind of like world works. He's got a point here, but I think this is not really a point towards ETH. This is a point towards just like crypto in general. So, for example, if there were funds where there were a fair few funds that got wrecked on Luna and got lost money on Luna or UST, they may have LP's which are called limited partners, basically people who invest in the, in kind of like the fund saying, oh, well, I want to pull my money out now.
00:04:38.148 - 00:04:59.890, Speaker A: Right. And if that money is not in like a stable coin or is not in fiat, well, then the fund has to sell off other assets. And I think we saw, we actually saw a bit of that. I think that's why ETH went to, went to 1700 and why BTC went to, went down as well. I think that we just saw, you know, broad selling from that. But the thing is, is that like, that's not a long term thing, that's a short term thing. And for every seller, there's a buyer.
00:04:59.890 - 00:05:23.786, Speaker A: So these funds and whatever can be offloading, but people are buying this up. Right. So I, and I don't think that's a permanent thing at all. That's just going to be a short to, I don't think it's gonna be a medium term thing. I think it's just gonna be a short term thing. And I, and I would assume that a lot of them have already kind of like not, maybe not finished selling, but like a lot of them have sold the bulk of what they probably wanted to sell at this point. But that point there, I think is the strongest one out of all of his points.
00:05:23.786 - 00:05:59.092, Speaker A: But at the same time, it doesn't just apply to ETH, it applies to literally like every asset that these funds were kind of like holding that they needed to sell off. And in all honesty, the funds, they're probably gonna sell off the assets that they're least bullish on and, and they're probably going to be least bullish on some of the other like, crap out there that we've seen fall so much. And they're probably going to sell that first rather than their ETH. Right. And then his next point go, Andrew says retail that sell because prices go down and they are bleeding in multiple directions. I mean, yes, but again, this doesn't apply to just ETH, like retail. If retail investors are panicking and just selling everything, they're going to sell everything that they hold.
00:05:59.092 - 00:06:27.766, Speaker A: And a lot of them don't just hold ETH. They hold multiple cryptos, like, including bitcoin, including a lot of the other tokens and stuff like that. But, you know, even still on nets, they're probably going to sell BTC and ETH less than they're going to sell their other assets just by virtue of the fact that B, two C, and ETH are going down less. Like, could you imagine someone holding an asset that's down, you know, I guess, like 50% in a week or something versus Ethel BTC. Right. Like, they're probably going to sell off that asset rather than that. It depends on what they have conviction on and things like that.
00:06:27.766 - 00:06:47.912, Speaker A: But again, this is not unique to ETH. So I don't know how this can even be put on here as, like, an ETH kind of like bear case. Like, that's a crypto bear case, right? That's not an ETH bear case. So again, just a weird point there. And then he's last. Not his last point. He's got another point here where he said project treasuries are selling because they realize their Runway is shrinking by the minute.
00:06:47.912 - 00:07:20.802, Speaker A: Hearing many projects have had poor Runway playing and actually kept most proceeds in ETH. Okay, to a certain extent, yes. But at the same time, what project treasuries, people will point out are there's some NFT treasuries that brought, raised in Ethan, and then he just held to kind of, like, get Runway. Like, fair enough. But that's nowhere near the amount of eat that was raised by something like icos. Right? The reason, the major reason why ETH went up in 2017 was icos. A major reason why it went down in 2018 was icos, because the icos had these massive ETH treasuries that they kept selling during 2018 and that drove the price down.
00:07:20.802 - 00:07:45.526, Speaker A: The NFT treasuries in ETH, they're nowhere near as big as what the icos were not. It's not within the same league. I don't, I don't even think it's worth comparing the two because it's just so different. And on top of that, in 2018, like, there was a lot of arguments to be made that there was no reason to hold ETH. Like there were, like, you know, Ethereum was dead, the ETH wasn't going to cruel any value and even like some of the biggest ETH bulls. But I believed, like, you know, what's next? Faith sort of thing. So there's that to consider as well.
00:07:45.526 - 00:08:16.538, Speaker A: So even if these NFT treasuries are starting the ETH, one, they don't have anywhere near amount of the amount of ETH that ICO treasuries had. And two, there's so many other, so many more reasons to hold Ethan than they were in 2018. So comparing the two, I think is a bit weird. Andrew didn't compare the two in his, in his kind of like, tweet here, but I've seen other people do it. So I just kind of like, wanted to, um, wanted to kind of like, uh, uh, speak to that. And then he says, short sellers, I mean, okay, but short sellers are selling everything, again, doesn't just apply to ETH. And they're short term speculators, they're not long term.
00:08:16.538 - 00:08:35.254, Speaker A: Kind of like investors, uh, miners. Yeah, okay, fair enough. But again, same applies to something like bitcoin. And the thing is, he actually inadvertently gave a bull case here. But that minus sell pressure is disappearing in a very short period of time. Like, in the next few months, it's gone completely forever within ethereum. So I don't even think that that's a good bear case at all.
00:08:35.254 - 00:09:13.340, Speaker A: Right? And then lastly, people that wanted to sell earlier but wanted a bounce, again, fair enough, but that, like, is not unique to ETH. So when I. And this is kind of like how I run through it, and I'm just like, is I asked two major questions. I'm like, is this unique to ETH? And does this actually have any data backing it up? Right. And pretty much none of his points here are unique to ETH, and none of them really have something to back it up besides maybe the institution selling off assets. But again, that's not unique to eat. So, you know, when I say stuff like this, I just feel like people believe it at face value because it looks like it's been presented in kind of like a logical way and kind of like, you.
00:09:13.340 - 00:09:38.680, Speaker A: You like when the price is going down, you kind of, like, give more credit to bear the, to the bearish outlook. Not, not. Maybe not you guys, but, like, people in general just give more credit to the bear thesis because the price is going down. Which, again, is just like a really weird thing that people do. But just generally, I just thought this was like pretty trash, like for a bear thesis, right? Like, and I feel like he put this together kind of. Cause the price was going down. It was just like very, very weird.
00:09:38.680 - 00:10:16.444, Speaker A: So that's kind of like how I run through it all. I hope that was kind of like a bit educational for you guys there on just like how I think through these things, but it becomes second nature eventually. And honestly, like it's always good to test your own thesis, test your own kind of like bull thesis, especially on things. And it's fine to do that, but you need to test it with like reasoning. You can't just test it with a few dot points and, you know, people just saying things. Like if you took what Andrew was saying here at face value and believed it without doing any of your own research, without reasoning about any of these points, then okay, for sure you would believe that that was like a really, really bearish case for Ethan. But I just went through and kind of like systematically debunked each of these kind of like points.
00:10:16.444 - 00:10:51.792, Speaker A: You know, I mean, I could go into more detail, but I don't, obviously don't have unlimited time. But you know, I just kind of like when I look at these sorts of things, I just, I can't help but laugh because it's like, where was this like when ETH was over 4000? Like why is it, is it suddenly, um, suddenly a bear case now? And the, the most hilarious thing is still to me reading that, like he, he, one of his bad kind of like uh, cases was that network activity and fees are down. It's like, of course they are, bro. Like, the market is quiet. Like, I don't understand how this is. Like, I don't even understand how he put that out there without reasoning about it himself. Like it just puzzled me really, really bad.
00:10:51.792 - 00:11:24.908, Speaker A: So I just wanted to kind of like go over that with you guys. But anyway, I'm going to move on to some, some kind of like, I guess more exciting news from the weekend and that was stuff around the merge and particularly around merge timing and the difficulty bomb. So you can read this tweet thread here from Tim Baiko which goes through the all core devs call that happened on Friday night here. Or I guess like Friday night for me. Friday, whatever for you, for you guys. But basically the TLDR I'm not going to read through the whole thread, obviously. The TLDR is that like the core devs has basically, have basically agreed to delay the difficulty bomb to August.
00:11:24.908 - 00:11:39.828, Speaker A: So from June to August. Now for those of you who may not have been paying attention. The difficulty bomb has already kicked in, and I'll show you how you can. How you can find this. I'm just going to bring up the chart here. I forgot to get it up before. So the difficulty bombs kicked in, which means block times have actually started going up already.
00:11:39.828 - 00:11:56.780, Speaker A: So if I bring this chart over here for you guys, if I put it here, you can see this is the average block time chart. Now, those spikes, they'll give you one guess what those spikes are in the chart. You guessed it. Difficulty bomb. Right. So we had this one here, which lasted a while back in 2017. Block times went up to 30 seconds.
00:11:56.780 - 00:12:09.788, Speaker A: Now, normal block times back then were about 14.5 seconds. Today, the normal block times are 13 seconds. But that was kind of like a big spike there. Then again, a big spike here. Right. And then again, another big spike here.
00:12:09.788 - 00:12:26.646, Speaker A: Well, I mean, bigger than the normal case. Right. Of a spike here for the difficulty bomb there. Then difficulty bomb was delayed until kind of, like, basically today. And now we can see that, you know, we have block times of around 13.3 seconds, and now they're up to about 13.8 seconds.
00:12:26.646 - 00:13:04.778, Speaker A: So the difficulty bomb has begun to be kind of, like, kicked in here and, you know, that's going to keep going unless we kind of, like, delay it. Now, I did say to you guys that I think block times would have gotten up to about 20 seconds in August, which would have been five, I guess, like 6.5 seconds more than you, than normal here. And users may have started filling it because essentially, if the block times are going up, that means there's kind of like, I guess, like, less space for. Oh, sorry. That means the kind of, like, scalability goes down, so to speak, because the blocks coming in slower, fees probably going to go up because people want to do, you know, do things quicker than the other people, and then the people outbid each other. And we have the normal kind of, like, fee market.
00:13:04.778 - 00:13:36.100, Speaker A: Right. So that's the chart that kind of shows that. But, yeah, the TL doctor is that the difficulty bomb is going to be delayed until August, and the merge is still being targeted for August. But given that they have to now do a difficulty bomb delay, which isn't a difficult thing to do, guys, like, it's very, very easy for them to do, I guess, like, the most difficult thing is just coordination. But given that they're going to have to do that, that's going to take a little bit of time away from everything got to do with the merge that's going to lead to a bit of kind of, like, coordination overhead. The. The merge may push into September because of that.
00:13:36.100 - 00:14:14.030, Speaker A: Now, I did say that I was highly confident that August would happen, but I did say that if the difficulty bomb was to be delayed, then I would expect the merge to also be kind of, like, pushed back a little bit. Now, that's not to say that the merge still can't happen in August. It could. It could happen on, like, late August. I would rule out, like, early or mid August given that this kind of, they've decided to delay the difficulty bomb. And I actually think that delaying the difficulty bomb is, is the correct choice because I think the problem is, is that, as I said, like, the block times would get, like, to 20 seconds or 2025, you know, depending on how long it would take, it'll go 20 plus seconds. And that would kind of, like, slow the chain down and users would start feeling that.
00:14:14.030 - 00:14:35.056, Speaker A: So, you know, given the fact that it's very easy to delay it, why not just delay it? And if it. And if it kind of, like, results in a one to two week kind of, I guess, pushback of. Of the merge, then, I mean, it's. It's kind of, like, worth it. And I do think so. So at this point in time, I would say that late August is still a possibility, but. But it's more likely to be early September in my eye, in my mind, just given this reality.
00:14:35.056 - 00:15:03.022, Speaker A: And now again, we have shadow fork six happening tomorrow, I believe the 31 may. And we have Ropsten going ahead on June 8. The shadow fork, I expect to go through smoothly. I don't expect any kind of, like, trouble with that or any kind of, like, surprises there. Ropston, again, I'm not expecting any surprises, but that's going to be kind of like the big test. Like, if Robson goes through really smoothly, we obviously will move on to the next test nets like Sepolia and Girly. And if those all go through smoothly, then I think, yeah, early September could be.
00:15:03.022 - 00:15:28.470, Speaker A: Could be kind of like the target there. I was still pretty set on August. Like, if those things went smoothly, if it wasn't for this difficulty bomb delay, and I remember I said this, like, if the difficulty bomb wants to be delayed, then I would expect the merge, merge timing to be pushed back. But this is my estimations, again, guys, like, this is not the estimations of anyone, of anyone else. This is my own personal ones. But I would err on the side of kind of like early September. But again, it's not like it's it's much longer.
00:15:28.470 - 00:15:59.454, Speaker A: Like, really? I mean, would you like, are we really going to feel like a mid to late August? Sorry, early September rather than mid to late August? I don't think so. So definitely just keep that in mind. I know you guys are probably not kind of like trading around the merge. Maybe some of you are, but I think most of you are long term investors. So either way, that's not really not going to kind of like, I guess hurt your positioning here at all, but just kind of like from a knowledge point of view, I would. Yeah, I would definitely bet on early September over. Over kind of like late August at this point in time, but we'll have to see.
00:15:59.454 - 00:16:31.974, Speaker A: Maybe they can do it by August. You know, maybe they'll surprise me and kind of like, they can coordinate around August, but I think they definitely want to give everyone in the ecosystem enough time to be ready for it. So probably a month at least, which, you know, for the merge. And, you know, given the fact that they're being ultra conservative about this sort of stuff. Yeah, I would say early September is more likely here, but you can read Tim Bico's kind of like core dev, all core devs call kind of like thread breakdown. For more details about this, I'll also link this chart in the YouTube description below. You can go check this out if you want to as well.
00:16:31.974 - 00:17:06.418, Speaker A: All right, so I spoke about that seven block Reorg that happened on the Beacon chain last week, and I kind of, like, went through a high level of overview of what happened. But Barnaby from the Ethereum foundation here has put together an absolutely amazing blog post visualizing that reorg and going into detail about exactly what happened, how it happened. Well, you know what? Why it probably won't happen again in the future. And the fixes that are kind of, like in place for this, I. So I just wanted to kind of, like, highlight this and say that I highly, highly recommend you go give this a read. It's very, very simple to follow. I think, like, it is technical.
00:17:06.418 - 00:17:22.540, Speaker A: It does go into a lot of things that you may not hear about often. But the thing is, is that it does that because, I mean, this is inherently technical stuff. Like, it's protocol level stuff. But I think Barnaby did an absolutely amazing job explaining all of this. And visually as well. Like, these are, these are gifs here. So this top one is a gift.
00:17:22.540 - 00:18:11.554, Speaker A: So it'll actually animate exactly what happened. But as I kind of, like, discussed last week, this isn't something that will result in any delay of the merge or has any effect on the merge, it's already a solved kind of like issue. It was just the kind of thing where the nodes hadn't upgraded and that, you know, they needed to upgrade. But essentially everything's, you know, everything's fine. It's not a big deal, but definitely read Barnaby's blog post for a full breakdown on that. All right, so superfears posted on Twitter today a Reddit comments from Space Insider who, who's kind of like, said the validator acceptance rate has increased from 1125 per day to 1350 per day. Now, as you guys know, this is because that as more validators are kind of like accepted into the beacon chain up to a certain amount, once it reaches a certain amount, we can add even more validators to the network at a time.
00:18:11.554 - 00:18:41.404, Speaker A: So it started off at 900 per day, then it went to 1125 per day. Now it's at 1350 per day, which is really, really awesome to see. The validator queue, I believe is under 1000 right now. I think what ended up happening was that a lot of the inflows from Lido stopped coming in because the steth peg kind of like de pegged there. So essentially what happens now if you stake with Lido, if you put ETH into Lido and then get Steth out, you immediately take a loss. You take a 0.2 or 0.3,
00:18:41.404 - 00:19:08.484, Speaker A: sorry, 0.02 or 0.03 kind of like ETH loss or two to 3% loss because of the fact that the ste kind of like peg is still, it's still kind of like at, I think 0.97.98. So it's not, it's kind of like not one for one still. So people stopped kind of like staking with Lido for now. But I mean, I'm not going to argue about whether that's a good or bad thing. I know there's a lot of discussion going on with Lido right now and I, and I will cover more on that in the future.
00:19:08.484 - 00:19:45.060, Speaker A: I think once this governance proposal with Lido goes through about them limiting themselves on the network, I want to see the outcome of that and I'll probably discuss it then. But very, very, very cool to see that the validator churn, kind of maximum validator kind of like that can be entered into the beacon chain has increased. The next increase will happen when there's 458, 700, 458,752 validators and it'll increase from 1350 to 1575. So cool to see this. I think there's going to be a lot of validators coming in through a few other kind of, like, services. I know that rocket pool is doing a lot of good work stakewise. I think the swell network's going live soon.
00:19:45.060 - 00:20:33.128, Speaker A: You know, I wouldn't count, like, the validator queue being kind of, like, almost empty now as any sign of the future. I think it's a sign of basically lighter inflow slowing down, but probably not inflows more generally. And as the market heats up again, I expect inflows to kind of, like, pick up again as well. So we'll just have to kind of wait and see what happens there. But very, very cool to see that the acceptance rate was increased again today. So I often get asked why the minimum required ETH amount to stake is 32. And people say, you know, was this an arbitrary kind of, like, amount picked? Was it picked because of the price of ETH? Like, you know, the price of ETH was much lower when it was picked, you know, or was it picked for such and such reason? Well, no, the actual reason why the 32 ETH requirement exists has got nothing to do with the amount of ETH.
00:20:33.128 - 00:21:02.644, Speaker A: It's got to do with the amount of validators the beacon chain can handle. And this is due to two key properties. So the beacon chain can only handle a certain amount of validators before it starts becoming unstable. Because what all the validators need to do is they need to stay in sync with each other, right? They need to kind of, like, vote on the same things. They need to kind of, you know, stay at the, what, what's called the. The head of the chain. Now, the two things to consider when considering how many validators can be active on the network at any one time is signature aggregation and networking related things.
00:21:02.644 - 00:21:43.296, Speaker A: Now, these are very technical things. You can actually read about this in the spec, in the annotated spec as well from Ben Edgington. But essentially, as hardware gets better and as we get better at doing signature aggregation and networking on the beacon chain, we could actually lower that 32 ETH requirement. And the goal is to actually lower that to something like 16 ETH or eight ETH or maybe even four ETH one day. We definitely don't want it to be, you know, obviously too high, but we definitely need to keep it high enough to, you know, based on the validator count to make sure that the chain remains stable. So in the. Maybe in a year, maybe in a couple years or something, it could be reduced to 16 ETH.
00:21:43.296 - 00:22:09.300, Speaker A: By virtue of the fact that hardware has gotten better. We've optimized better on the client side and thing, and kind of like the, the core developers and core researchers feel safe knowing, you know, being able to admit more validators to the network here. And that would obviously open up participation to more people. But the thing is. Okay, so the thing is, is that, like, even if. Let me pose a scenario, too. I think people bring this up all the time because they're like, you know, 32 ETH is out of reach of most people.
00:22:09.300 - 00:22:35.142, Speaker A: You know, how can people solo stake if 32 ETH costs, what is it, whatever it is today to that? If ETH is $2,000, $64,000, I get that. Right. But let's, let me, let me pose a scenario to you guys. Let's say the minimum ETH requirement was dropped to four e. Now, this is probably going to be a while before it drops to Fort E, because it require, it would require a lot of improvements. But let's say in five years, the minimum 8th amount required drops to. Drops to four ETH.
00:22:35.142 - 00:22:46.624, Speaker A: All right. For ETH at $2,000. But that's eight grand. Eight grand. Right. I think, you know, most middle class people could. Could spare that, right? Like, in first world countries, that's fine.
00:22:46.624 - 00:23:04.284, Speaker A: Well, not spare that, but like, that would make the investment. Right? Okay, that's either 2000. Like, if ETH is at 2000, in five years, something is wrong. So let's take the bear case of what it would be in five years, and I think that would be 10,000. I think it's probably gonna be higher than that. But that's my own personal belief. But let's just take the bear case.
00:23:04.284 - 00:23:32.746, Speaker A: So for either $10,000 is $40,000. Okay, there goes most people that can solo stake again. Right. So the solution, in my mind, is not to lower. I mean, okay, one of the solutions, yeah, is to lower the minimum ETH, kind of like required amount. But it's not the only solution because of the fact that you can lower it as much as you want. But the thing is, if Ethereum succeeds, the ETH price, what it's trying to do, and if Ethereum keeps growing, which we all think it will, the ETH price is just going to keep going up and up and up.
00:23:32.746 - 00:24:11.276, Speaker A: So in saying that you need the, I mean, you need to work towards lowering the minimum amount required, but you also need to make it easy for people to kind of like solo stake in other ways, such as with decentralized staking pools. So something like rocket pool, right. We need to encourage those solutions as much as we need to kind of like look at lowering the minimum ETH required amount. And in saying that as well, lowering the minimum ETH required amount to stake would also lower the required amount for something like rocker pool as well, which would, you know, it would have downstream effects, which would be really cool too. So just some things to consider. But there's this thread from toegroll here going over this and going over this in more detail and more technicality. So I highly recommend giving this a read.
00:24:11.276 - 00:24:54.434, Speaker A: I'll link it in the YouTube description, but those are all the things to kind of like consider there. So yeah, I just kind of like wanted to highlight this thread from, from togroll and kind of like explain it in my words as well. All right, so another great thread from Bartech here about how rollouts put transaction data on the l one chain. And you know, this is costly obviously right now, but post 4844, which is proto dank sharding fees, will go down. But let's see what can go wrong if data is not posted on chain. And it's exactly what Bartech kind of like goes through in this thread. So I highly recommend giving this a kind of like, read here to understand that if data is not posted on the same kind of like chain that the proofs are being posted to, if data is kind of like posted elsewhere.
00:24:54.434 - 00:25:26.534, Speaker A: So if it's not settling on Ethereum, it's settling some, it's getting posted somewhere else, then it is not a roll up anymore, it is a validium or it is an optimistic chain, and bad things can happen. So I think from, from my understanding, one of the worst things that could happen was that your funds can't be stolen. But if the data is not available. So for some reason, if the data is off chain and you can't get access to that data because the nodes are offline, then your funds essentially become frozen. So you wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds. No one can steal your funds, but you wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds. So I mean, it's kind of like useless.
00:25:26.534 - 00:26:06.026, Speaker A: Who cares if no one can steal your funds if you can't even withdraw them, right? So that's why I am personally very kind of like strict about not referring to things that don't post data on chain as a roll up because they're not like, they shouldn't be equated with those things from a security perspective. But Bartech does a better job than me explaining it in this thread. So I'll link it in the YouTube description and you can go check it out. All right, so I put out this tweet today where I said inside me there are two wolves. One that is hyper giga bullish on ETH and can't stop buying it whenever possible, and one that is hyper giga bearish on 99% of tokens and coins and wonders how anyone can be redacted enough to buy them. Redacted is like a meme on Twitter. Not to say the other, the other r word.
00:26:06.026 - 00:26:29.484, Speaker A: But basically it's kind of like, funny trying to reconcile these two points because I think, like, I mean, obviously I'm really, really bullish on ETH. I've gone through the bull case for ETH many, many times before. I'm not going to rehash it then. But I am so bearish on so many coins and tokens, I think that the majority of them should literally be worth zero. I don't know why they're not worth zero. Not. I mean, it's hilarious.
00:26:29.484 - 00:26:58.348, Speaker A: Like, even something like terra classic is not worth zero anymore. It's worth like 900 million or something. It's just crazy. Like these, these things just, just play out, right? But the thing is, is that when I kind of look at the rest of the ecosystem, I'm just kind of like, well, I don't think these things are going to drag ETH down with them, but, like, there are people holding these things. There are people who have a thesis on them. There are people who think that these things are going to, you know, outperform USD and outperform Ethan. Like, no, like, as I've explained to you guys before, most things will not outperform either.
00:26:58.348 - 00:27:20.164, Speaker A: The long term. Even the things that people were, like, really, really bullish on for like a month or two, and then, you know, and then it kind of, like, goes down only from there. I remember one of the kind of, like, things that people were really bullish on, especially during Defi summer, was, was uni. Now, Uniswap is obviously an amazing project. Keeps growing. Unitoken doesn't uni. Token has been down only against ETH and even against USD.
00:27:20.164 - 00:27:44.194, Speaker A: Right. And then you can kind of look at ens, another hyped up token projects, amazing tokens not doing too well. Dy DX again, project really good, token not doing too well. There's plenty of examples of this. So even the most hyped up things that people were, like, really excited about for maybe a month, maybe two months, or even three months, they've just failed to outperform ETH. And obviously, like, now it's a bear market. But the thing is, is that uni came out the end of 2020.
00:27:44.194 - 00:28:05.182, Speaker A: It went through the whole bull market, went up in USD, but still underperformed ETH. And now in a bear market, it's going down more than ETH. So it's underperforming even more. And then on the recovery, it's going to recover, if it does recover much slower than something like 8th would. So I'm not saying I'm bearish. I'm just using Uni as an example. I'm not saying I'm bearish on uni particularly.
00:28:05.182 - 00:28:25.484, Speaker A: I'm just really, really bearish on so much stuff out there that isn't even part of a successful project. Uni's token title is a successful project and that we all kind of like, believe will be successful into the future. I know there are some people who don't think Uniswap is going to be successful. I'm just using it as an example. Please, please don't kind of like take that as. It's kind of like anything. It's just an example to illustrate my point here.
00:28:25.484 - 00:28:53.776, Speaker A: But there are like plenty of projects out there that have tokens associated with them. But the project's going nowhere and those tokens will be down only forever. They'll be overshadowed by other tokens and other projects and everyone will just lose money on it, basically. Or unless they kind of like sell, maybe they can make some money or whatever. But essentially that's kind of like what happens with most tokens. And you can, if you need proof, you can just go look back at 2017 and 2018 and see what were the most hyped up tokens back then. Like, I can think of plenty off the top of my head.
00:28:53.776 - 00:29:26.012, Speaker A: Like Gollum, for example, was, was very hyped up. Go look at Gollum today. There was status, which is a really hyped up ICO. I mean, even just on the NFT side, cryptokitties, right? All that sort of sorts of stuff. It's all pretty much dead now and, but the thing is, the status project still going, believe the Golem project still going, cryptokitties, I mean, the creators of that created their own blockchain and then did some, a bunch of weird things. But you know, there are still things kind of like going, but the tokens are just dead, right, for one reason or another. But you can go look and kind of look for yourself as well.
00:29:26.012 - 00:30:12.566, Speaker A: What you can do is you can actually go to coinmarketcap and they have like a historical snapshot feature where you can look at what this, what the kind of like top ten or top 20 or top whatever looked like in say you want to do the high of the last bull market, do like November or December of 2017 and kind of like look at what was there and then look at it today and look at it against USD and look at it against ETH. Most of those things are not doing too hot, so that's just an exercise if you guys want to go do that. But anyway, I'm going to power through the rest of these updates because I'm up on the 30 minutes mark here. Actually, this is something that I probably can't power through because I had a few thoughts about this, but has a quote tweeted our token terminal here which has like a picture of how it started versus how it's going for r there. So are there. The application started on ethereum. Now the application is on various EVM chains and L2s.
00:30:12.566 - 00:30:41.276, Speaker A: And then Hazu quote tweeted this and said sometime in the next one to two years there will be a flipping from fat protocol thesis to fat application thesis. The space is way over invested in l one copycats. I totally agree with this. I think that too many people piled into the l one trade and at the expense of applications. I think that there are a few application tokens out there that are undervalued. I'm not going to name them because I don't want to give any investment advice, but I do think there are some out there that are undervalued. I haven't bought any of those or anything like that.
00:30:41.276 - 00:31:24.064, Speaker A: But in contrast to these l one s, which just are so overvalued, there needs to be kind of like a flipping here. And there was some great discussion in the, in the kind of replies here into Hazu's thread that has his tweet that I would recommend you go look at. But the TLDR of my thoughts on this is that applications are king makers for chains. The change of the best applications on them are the ones that are going to win. There are too many chains, you guys know, I think this already too many l one chains. There's probably going to be too many l two chains eventually, but at some point, but eventually I think that we're just going to coalesce around, you know, one settlement layout which I believe is going to be ethereum, and a bunch of l two s that are going to settle to Ethereum. There will be application specific l two s that do well, you know, here and there.
00:31:24.064 - 00:31:51.678, Speaker A: But I think the juggernauts of the industry will be ethereum as the settlement layer and the L2s as the execution layers and all that sort of stuff there. And there will be other chains, like enterprise chains and bespoke chains and. And these other sorts of things that all exist. But if we're talking about, like, what accrues the most kind of, like, activity and value, I do think it's just gonna be a theorem and a small handful of kind of, like, l two s. Like, the l one trade in my eyes. Like, not just because I'm an ETH maxi, but just, it was, it was just silly. I.
00:31:51.678 - 00:32:02.882, Speaker A: You can look at in the prices, like, how silly it is. Like, a lot of these things are just down, only, like, I mean, phantom. I went through phantom, I think, a few weeks ago. It's. It's just wrecked. Absolutely wrecked. Like, not just the price, but its ecosystem is dead.
00:32:02.882 - 00:32:40.380, Speaker A: Harmony, the same thing. I don't hear anyone talking about Harmony anymore. Avalanche actually did an interesting thing recently where they cannibalize their own activity, because what ended up happening was that an avalanche project called Crabdara or Crabada or something, it was some crab game moved off of the avalanche sea chain, which is the EVM chain, to its own subnets. And basically the avalanche sea chain activity collapsed overnight. It went down by more than 50%. I think there was a study that was done that showed that, that the crab game accounted for 50% just on its own, but that was just its own contracts. That wasn't including all the other contracts that it was interacting with, such as the dexs and things like that.
00:32:40.380 - 00:33:07.166, Speaker A: So what ended up happening was that game moved to a subnet, and all that activity moved off. So now the avax on chain activity on the C chain. So the avalanche seachain activity is really, really low, and this subnet basically has the activity. But the thing about subnets is that they don't pay the C chain for their security. They're not like l two s. They're essentially separate blockchains that use kind of, like, validators from the C chain or the C chain. Validators can opt in to validate on these subnets, and these subnets can have their own tokens.
00:33:07.166 - 00:33:28.370, Speaker A: So, like, there's just kind of, like, weird stuff going on in these other l one s that just the tokens, like, make me so bearish on their tokens. Like, I was, I was already bearish on their tokens. But, like, it's even worse now. And it remains to be seen what the l two tokens are going to look like, right? Like, I got no idea. And it remains to be seen what happens with the matic token. Obviously, it's, it's tied to the Polygon pos chain right now, but they're going to have l two s coming out. So I don't know what's going to happen with that.
00:33:28.370 - 00:34:13.830, Speaker A: And I don't want to comment on things like the Matic token because, you guys know, I'm an advisor the Polygon and I get compensated in tokens, so I don't want to, I don't like talking about things that I kind of like, have a heavy, heavy vested interest in besides ETH, of course. But you know, it remains to be seen how the l two tokens are going to fare. I don't know. There are already some out there like, like dy DX, which I actually consider more to be a defi token than an l two token, even though they're on their own l two loop ring, I consider to be probably more defi than l two, even though they have like a whole l two ecosystem. It's kind of like weird how people kind of like bucket these things, but it remains to be seen what the tokens like optimism and arbitram do. By the way, I feel like optimism is going to launch their token this week. I just, I have a feeling, you guys know I'm an investor in optimism, but I haven't like, heard anything.
00:34:13.830 - 00:34:37.778, Speaker A: This is not me giving you guys like any privileged information. I just feel like from what I've seen, the information that I've seen publicly, like, this public information kind of feels like it's going to launch this week. So we'll see. Maybe that's going to be kind of like what kind of like ignites maybe the next phase of the bull market. I don't know, we'll have to see there. But yeah, just some, some of my thoughts there and just the last few things before I wrap up for today. I just wanted to hide that immutable protocol fees are now live.
00:34:37.778 - 00:35:00.396, Speaker A: Now immutable for immutable x. They have a really cool model for their protocol fees that I suggest you go, guys, go and read about. I've talked about fees before and how they're going to work on l two s versus l one's and how, you know, we can prevent spam and all that sort of stuff there. So I highly recommend going giving this blog post to read on the fees. I'll link it in YouTube description. I'm not going to go over it now because I'm out of time. Just wanted to kind of highlight that there and then.
00:35:00.396 - 00:35:25.756, Speaker A: Also, immutable has put forward a proposal to the apecoinda. So the bought ape stuff to get the, I guess like bought apes to move to a L2 on Ethereum, basically to move to immutable instead of to another chain. So you can go read this proposal. It's really, really great. I like it. It makes a lot of sense. I think it would be beneficial to everyone if they if the board ape ecosystem move to an l two instead of another chain, obviously, because it keeps it in the Ethereum family.
00:35:25.756 - 00:35:57.396, Speaker A: So definitely go check out this proposal. And last up here, I just wanted to shout out the Ethereum foundation is currently searching for a hiring coordinator to help find great people for their community of teams and projects. So if that's something that you may be interested in or something you think you have experience in the past or you think that you could be a good fit for, you can go check this out. I'll link this job in the YouTube description below and then you can go check out all the requirements and everything and maybe even apply if that's something you think that you could do. But I think on that note, that's going to be it for today. So thank everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
