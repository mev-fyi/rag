00:00:00.480 - 00:00:29.094, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 21 April 2021. Alright, let's get into the news, everyone. So the market's quite hot right now, and what's even hotter is the value that Ethereum is settling. So you can see this tweet here from Ryan Watkins from Massari. We basically tweeted out that ethereum has settled $1.5 trillion of value in Q 120 21.
00:00:29.094 - 00:01:21.056, Speaker A: So just the first three months, January, February, March of 2021, 2021, we have settled one point. I mean, the Ethereum network, I should say, has settled $1.5 trillion worth of value, which is more than its previous seven quarters combined, which means it is more than all of 2019 and all of 2020 combined, which is just absolutely insane, right? I mean, you know, I've written a lot about this and I've talked a lot about this on the refuel, about how I believe Ethereum is going to become the world sediment layer. It is well on its way to doing so. I think I saw a tweet before that. It's already settling more value than PayPal, which is absolutely insane when you think about it, right? And, you know, in general, like, the value that's being settled is also like any kind of asset, right? There are, there are stable coins on there. There's obviously ETH, there's lots of different kind of like, governance tokens or just like, you know, utility tokens or whatever.
00:01:21.056 - 00:01:53.410, Speaker A: And there's nfts. I mean, there is so much value being centered on Ethereum. And because, as I wrote about yesterday and talked about yesterday, Ethereum is a credibly neutral platform. You know, anyone can just spin up their own asset on there for whatever they want and they have like, no fear of it being removed or being taken down because the network's decentralized. So from that point of view, that's always kind of been my, my bull case for Ethereum as a settlement layer is that there's just going to be, you know, infinite amounts of assets deployed to Ethereum. And they don't have to be just stable coins. They don't have to be just governance tokens.
00:01:53.410 - 00:02:15.170, Speaker A: You know, there's just like a world of nfts going on and things like that as well. So, yeah, really, really great to see this, man. I mean, this blew away my expectations, too. I was thinking, you know, okay, maybe we get to a trillion in Q one. That'd be really cool to see, but the fact that we're at 1.5 trillion in Q one is just incredible. And I also saw before I was looking at, like, the Ethereum fees paid.
00:02:15.170 - 00:02:55.766, Speaker A: I think we set a new record over the last 24 hours of $50 million of fees paid. I think we did one of those days in February, but I think we actually ended up doing more over the last 24 hours. And the only, you know, I guess, like, sad thing about that is that ERP 1559 isn't implemented yet. So all of those fees went to miners, which means, you know, inevitably some of it will be getting dumped on the market instead of burned. But still, this free revenue, even in the face of, like, I guess, quote unquote, competitors and other ecosystems starting to get usage, the fee revenue is still as high as it's, as it's been over the last few months. So I don't think that's going away anytime soon. The demand to use Ethereum is just absolutely incredible.
00:02:55.766 - 00:03:27.716, Speaker A: Even when the market's kind of quiet way was still around 100, right, which is 2020, $5 million a day in fees on average, if way is around 100. So from that perspective, you know, people might say, oh, well, it's only because the market's hot. It's like, okay, well, you know, even when the market's quiet, it's hotter than what it is during a bear market. But that's not the point. The point is that ethereum as a platform is going to, I guess, like, you know, exist through bet bulls and bear markets. And Ethereum as a platform has usage, has use cases, sorry, I should say, during bear markets as well. We have DeFi, we have yield farming.
00:03:27.716 - 00:03:50.260, Speaker A: Yes, the yields will be lower, but it's still going to be better than getting 0.5% in your bank account. Like, where are you going to go? Right? You go to cash. Where are you going to go? Are you going to go to stocks? You can do that on Ethereum. You don't need to go to the traditional finance system to do that. You're going to get into a high yield savings account. Well, I mean, you're going to get percent at best, at least in the west, so you're not going to go there.
00:03:50.260 - 00:04:25.126, Speaker A: So of course you're going to go to stables. And even if you're only yet, even if the yields dropped to like 2%, that's still better than just sitting in cash, right? So from that perspective, the network is always going to be being used. And with 1559 implemented, that means fees are always going to be being, going to get burned as well. Like, think about that for a sec. Doesn't matter what part of the market cycle we are in, whether it's a bull market or a bear market, and every single block is going to burn a portion of fees in perpetuity forever. This doesn't stop 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, forever. Right.
00:04:25.126 - 00:05:21.564, Speaker A: Until the Ethereum network stops running, which, you know, it's going to run for a very long time, like decades, centuries, depending on, you know, no one can tell the future, but, you know, decades at least, the Ethereum network is going to be running, I believe, uninterrupted. And that means fees are going to be being burned there. And, yeah, I mean, this, I'm going to talk a little bit more about this because I've got a bunch of ERP 1559 stuff lined up here, and I also did write about it in the Daily Way newsletter, so you can go check that out. But I'll leave that for a bit later in the refuel here. Another bit of bullish news that came out today was that those canadian ETF's that I spoke about, the ETH ETF's went live. And the first day of trading volume here, Eric tweeted out here where he said that ETH X, which is Galaxy's ETF, did $21 million a volume, and ETH H, which is from purpose, is 19 million and ETH R from evolve is 3 million. Now, these figures are obviously quite low compared to centralized exchange or decentralized exchange volumes, but this is day one of a brand new product.
00:05:21.564 - 00:05:52.674, Speaker A: And you know, as Eric notes here, this is about one fifth of what the bitcoin ETF did on day one. And that makes sense considering that eats market cap, is around one fifth of bitcoin. But obviously, ETH is much less known than bitcoin as well, I believe. But this is still very positive. And he, Eric also notes here that on day one, the volume is largely buying, so most of it will convert to assets. So I'm going to keep an eye on this, see how this goes. See kind of like what, what shakes out here and kind of like what volumes we see.
00:05:52.674 - 00:06:36.628, Speaker A: I think this is just going to inevitably increase. But it's really great to see that, you know, if he's kind of like being put into these ETF's in Canada, and I'm hoping that us, you know, I wouldn't say this year for the US, I think bitcoin might get an ETF in the US this year. Maybe towards the end of the year, but I believe that ETH will get an ETF, ETF next year in the US if bitcoin gets one this year, so, still very bullish there as well. But, yeah, good. Good to see Canada kind of being on the forefront here and approving this. So Bitfinex announced today that they're supporting deposits and withdrawals of USDT to the Hermes L2 network on Ethereum, which is a ZK roll up L2 implementation here. Really cool to see, you know, centralized exchanges supporting some L2s here.
00:06:36.628 - 00:07:12.104, Speaker A: I hope to see more of this. I mean, I've been harping on about this for months now that, you know, the way to really get this adoption of L2 on Ethereum to, you know, to speed it up is to get these kind of centralized services offering these bridges in and out. We already saw this play out with BSC. You know, without binance being a bridge into BSc, I don't think it would have gotten anywhere near the amount of traction it has. And that's the same goes for L2s, I think, you know, I was thinking about it as well. Like, there's going to be multiple ways to enter into a L2 because you could theoretically have, like, binance withdraw to BSc and then a BSc bridge to L2 on Ethereum. Like that could be done.
00:07:12.104 - 00:08:06.664, Speaker A: And it's going to be interesting to see if, you know, binance allows that to happen, because by allowing someone to deploy a bridge on BSc to go to Ethereum's L2, you basically, like by proxy, are allowing people to go to your competitor. So we'll see what happens there. But anyway, you know, I don't want to dawdle too much on that one, but I think that more centralized exchanges, more centralized services, and more of. More of these kind of platforms should be doing a kind of like, L2 integration here. And, you know, USDT is obviously a stable coin, so it makes sense for them to be on a L2 solution because stablecoin transfers at least USD USDT from mostly done for arbitrage transactions between, like, layer one, ethereum, and different centralized exchanges and stuff like that. So, yeah, I mean, we're going to see, like an, like, a world of arbitrage open up on L2 as well. So I think tether's getting ahead of the game here by supporting this early on.
00:08:06.664 - 00:08:47.876, Speaker A: So an interesting tweet here from. From Andre of yearn finance. He basically said, back in my law days, we had a saying, contracts are there for the bad times and not the good times. I feel the same way about decentralization. Now, this goes back to, I think, you know, when you think about, like, insurance, right? You don't take out insurance because you, you know, because everything's going good, right? You don't take out insurance for the good times. You take out insurance so that if something goes wrong, you're covered. That's Andre's point here, with contracts, right? Like, if you, when you write up a contract with someone, it's not because that, you know, you think something's going to go bad or, you know, something's going to go bad and you're not doing it, you know, and everything might be good, but you're not doing it because everything's good.
00:08:47.876 - 00:09:32.880, Speaker A: You're doing it because you're protecting yourself from the, you know, the chance. Because there's a non zero chance that something goes wrong and you want to have it on a legal document that is enforceable, um, that, you know, by, I guess, like the legal system, uh, so that you can kind of have that protection. Now, the same goes for decentralization where, you know, you may not care about it or you may not want it, you know, while everything's running smoothly, but you want it there for when things aren't running smoothly. So, you know, you want to be protected from the, the perils of centralization, where, you know, you could get censored. Or your app, if you deploy an app, can get removed because it doesn't fit into, you know, what. What is, um, I guess, like, what the operator wants it to. Law enforcement can come after these platforms and get them to do something right, get them to remove something or whatever.
00:09:32.880 - 00:09:59.642, Speaker A: So decentralization is obviously incredibly valuable, but it's not readily kind of, like, apparent why it's valuable when things are good. It's only when things go pear shaped that you really care about it. And I think this, this goes for not just like, platforms like Ethereum or layer one blockchains in general. It goes for the apps built on top as well. Right. I know a lot of Defi apps right now on Ethereum still have admin keys, right. And that's by design, and I don't think we should fault apps for that.
00:09:59.642 - 00:10:53.388, Speaker A: But I think the base layer needs to be, you know, as decentralized as it can be from very early on, before you can even, like, kind of trust building on it. Because if it's something like BSC, where it's completely centralized, then, you know, inevitably one day that's just going to lead to some pitfalls. There might be some kind of law enforcement action, or there might be some kind of, like, action that happens on there from the operators, which, you know, is due to that kind of centralization there. So, yeah, I thought this was just really great and really well put by Andre and really kind of, like, succinctly put as well. There's not many times when you can get something so succinctly put in the crypto space, since everything's so complex. But Andre did a really great job here, so kudos to him on that one. So, you know, I'm sure we've all seen lately a lot of the, I guess, kind of like gambling going on in the crypto space, a lot of the casino esque stuff happening, a lot of the scams, you know, kind of happening across the space.
00:10:53.388 - 00:11:41.234, Speaker A: And today, you know, watching kind of like those safe moon and kind of like ass tokens and stuff on BSC, I kind of thought to myself about this tweet from Mateo Liebowitz in July of 2020. He basically said, what is the role of an analyst in a market where fundamentals don't matter? Now, the reason I think about this a lot is because, you know, I know, like, I'm a fundamentals based investor, of course. I mean, you all know that about me. I will definitely only buy things that I am comfortable holding over the long term because I believe in the fundamentals of it, obviously, you know, I hold a lot of ETH, and, you know, I've been stacking ETH for years because I truly believe in ETH fundamentals. I have. There's no doubt in my mind that that Ethereum has, you know, the best fundamentals out of any blockchain system. And ETH, as an asset has the best fundamentals out of any layer one asset out there and maybe any asset in crypto.
00:11:41.234 - 00:12:07.406, Speaker A: And yes, I'm talking even more than bitcoin. But then you look at kind of like, all these other things that pump up, and let's use dogecoin as an example. If you look at the performance of Dogecoin over the last kind of like, few years, even, it has outperformed both bitcoin and ETH. Right. And a lot of the other stuff out there. So you think. So you probably think to yourself, you know, why did I bother doing fundamentals investing when I could have just thrown money into doge and been better off? Well, look, that's the wrong way to think about it.
00:12:07.406 - 00:12:37.506, Speaker A: I think there's a reason you didn't buy Doge and you bought ETH, and all, you bought BTC, right? You didn't buy doge because it really literally is a joke coin. It does nothing. It is a meme, and that's not a bad thing. But you didn't believe, and you didn't have conviction on this as an asset. So if you were to buy a doge a few years ago, you would have had to have the thesis that, okay, while the doge meme is not going anywhere, right. If another bull market comes around and we get more new people coming in, you know, maybe they're gonna. They're gonna like doge because of the meme, you know, and it's cheap as well.
00:12:37.506 - 00:12:56.018, Speaker A: Like, the unit. I mean, it's not cheap by market cap, but, like, the unit price is cheap and that attracts noobs. And then you would have had to pick, like, the TikTok mania. You would have had to pick, like, Robin Hood, the GME stuff that happened, which kind of, I think, inspired dogecoin as well. You would have had to pick Elon Musk kind of tweeting about it. It's impossible. You wouldn't have been able to pick that.
00:12:56.018 - 00:13:32.682, Speaker A: And, you know, even if you bought it back then, you wouldn't have held it to today, like, most people do not hold that long because you just don't have that same conviction. So from that point of view, the role of an animal analyst in a market where fundamentals don't seem to matter, at least in the short term, is that you're basically investing comfortably rather than gambling. Like, I don't think investing in things that you have no conviction in is actually investing. I think it is gambling because if you had conviction in it, then you probably wouldn't. Sorry. If you didn't have conviction in it, then you're not, like, doing a fundamental investment, so to speak. And I guess we could kind of debate about, like, the semantics of what that means.
00:13:32.682 - 00:14:11.780, Speaker A: But to me, an investment is something that you actually believe in and that you actually invest in based on fundamentals. If you are buying something because you believe it's going to go up in value due to all these different things, not. Not anything to do with fundamentals, but just due to all these things that might happen by chance, well, then it's gambling to me. And then I basically said, you know, the answer to Mateo's question here is that ignore the noise, right? Focus on the long term, educate newcomers, create lasting value, and build strong networks and friendships. That's exactly what I've been trying to do over the last few years. And I think, you know, I've succeeded to some extent with. With all of the stuff that I do, obviously, with the Daily Gwei and stuff like that, and focusing on the long term.
00:14:11.780 - 00:14:31.128, Speaker A: I mean, I've just been stacking ETH since early 2017. Obviously, I hold some Defi tokens as well. I recently trimmed a lot of my portfolio, actually, because it was getting a bit out of hand. I trimmed it down just to a few assets, but assets that I definitely, you know, believe in and invest in based on fundamentals. And I just ignore the noise. Like, yeah, I watch it. Yeah, I pay attention to it.
00:14:31.128 - 00:15:02.392, Speaker A: And just out of curiosity, but I don't let it get to me. I don't let it kind of, like, cloud my kind of, like, investing judgment where I'm like, okay, well, maybe I should have bought these kind of, like, scams or doge and I would have made more money. At the end of the day, money is a means to an end, right? I mean, you know, you've probably seen, like, people putting, like, $200 into something and making millions off it. That's. That's just, again, it's just gambling. Because when you think about it, it's the same concept as a lottery, where you might have people putting, like, in, you know, $100 into a. Into a lottery, and then someone wins the jackpot of, like, $20 million.
00:15:02.392 - 00:15:40.842, Speaker A: Well, I mean, yeah, one person won that out of how many people that played, right? Probably potentially millions of people that played. So from that point of view, you know, I mean, I'm not to say that fundamentals based investing can't have, like, gambling aspects to it as well because, you know, maybe in the short term, something pumps up because people are just, you know, aping into it or whatever. But I think, as I said here, chasing every pump and dump is just gambling. And fundamentals do matter over the long term, which they do, because if you look at a lot over the long term and you look through bear markets, you know, all this stuff gets obliterated. Absolutely obliterated. And the more quality stuff goes down as well. But it doesn't go down as much.
00:15:40.842 - 00:16:08.068, Speaker A: So from that point of view, I think over the longer term, you're fine, but short term, during manias, people don't care. People don't like, I mean, some people do, but most people just don't. The new entrants don't know what to look for in terms of fundamentals, yet. They just see crypto as a way to make some quick money, and that's. And that's fine. I mean, a lot of us may be started like that, but that's why during the down markets and during the quieter markets is when the fundamentals really shine and separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. So, yeah, I'll leave it at that for now.
00:16:08.068 - 00:16:35.904, Speaker A: But yeah, just, just something I think about a lot from, you know, from time to time and just something I think that all of you maybe, maybe we've been thinking about as well and just, just some color there. So Ryan Berkman's here. Said. Well, announced today that Heman and a few other people have put together a PDF report aimed at bankers and fund managers called Ethereum, a store of value with cash flow. And the report is available at ethereum cashflow.com dot. You can kind of view it yet.
00:16:35.904 - 00:17:03.022, Speaker A: It's only a four page report. It's very simple. It basically outlines the very simple bull case for ETH as an asset and Ethereum as a network. Now, I'm not going to read the whole thing for you. You can go read it. It'll be linked in the YouTube description here. But I think this is a very nice kind of way to relay the value prop of ethnic Ethereum to these investors that don't spend every waking moment in the ecosystem and don't watch my refuels and don't read my newsletters when they should because they would know all of this like months in advance.
00:17:03.022 - 00:17:27.182, Speaker A: But I don't think they're going to do that. Right. I think that these newer investors need a very high level, kind of like a guide to Ethereum and ETH and what gives it value. And they also need it to be kind of like articulated to them in words and terms that they are used through, which is what this report does. So highly recommend going giving this report a read. As I said, it's only four pages here, not much text to go through. And, you know, you might learn something as well.
00:17:27.182 - 00:17:54.950, Speaker A: Maybe you already know all this. I mean, I obviously already knew all this, but it doesn't matter. I think reading through it and kind of like reinforcing your knowledge is really important. So yeah, definitely go check this one out. So Synthetix have announced that they're going to be releasing new synths on Synthetix protocol, including s Facebook, s Amazon, s Apple s Netflix and S Goog. So as I was saying before, where are you going to go when you cash out of crypto? You're going to go buy some stocks. Well, I mean, here you go.
00:17:54.950 - 00:18:24.224, Speaker A: You can buy some stocks in Synthetix's platform, you don't have to go to traditional finance. You don't have to leave the crypto ecosystem. So these will be live on April 22 at midnight UTC here. And I think they're also going to be adding new cryptocurrency since, as I mentioned here, such as S s scRv, s rune, and s one inch. And there's no expected downtime for this as well. This is really, really awesome. I think that for me, if I want to buy stocks, which I don't right now, but when I eventually do, I'm definitely going to be using a synthetic stock here.
00:18:24.224 - 00:18:47.472, Speaker A: I'm not going to tradfi. I mean, I wouldn't even know where to start. I've never bought a stock myself. All of my investing has been done in the crypto ecosystem where I've just bought crypto assets. And, you know, I guess, like, the stocks that I own are through, like, my retirement account, which I don't even manage. It's like, you know, someone else manages that, another company does. But, you know, if I was to go to stocks, I would do it through synthetix here.
00:18:47.472 - 00:19:12.346, Speaker A: I know there's other platforms as well, like off Ethereum or, like on Ethereum, but, like, running on a different platform. Like, I know there's the terra ecosystem with Mira, and you can use that as well. But for me, you know, I'm an SNX holder. I really love the Synthetix platform. I want to support them. So I would just buy these kind of like synthetic assets here if I was going to buy stocks. And, you know, these are very popular ones, right? Like, you know, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google.
00:19:12.346 - 00:19:37.552, Speaker A: And I think they already have Tesla maybe. But yeah, I mean, if you were going to buy stocks, I would do it through Synthetix because it's much easier too. Right? It means you can basically, I'm sure you'll be able to lp with this sort of stuff, too. So it's not just like a dead asset in your account. You can hold it in your own wallet. You know, it is a synthetic asset at the end of the day as well. So it's like basically just a price fee that you're getting exposure to, but it's still going to give you exposure to the asset.
00:19:37.552 - 00:20:12.576, Speaker A: So. Yeah. Really cool to see this from Synthetix here. So loopring announced something really exciting today, and for some reason my Twitter feed didn't want to show me this until later in the day, even though this is, like, really exciting. I hate when Twitter does that. But anyway, what they announced today is something they're calling Ethan port, which is loopring solution to solve composability between l one, l two and centralized exchanges while greatly reducing l one fees. So the key takeaways here is that loopring Zk roll up users can interact with layer one dapps directly from L2 by utilizing the power of batching and zero knowledge proofs.
00:20:12.576 - 00:20:54.252, Speaker A: I've talked about batching before in the context of Starkware's Zk roll up Caspian, a kind of amm design. I spoke about that on a few refuels back there. Loopring now will now support cheap and capital efficient cross l two to l two transfers. Awesome, right? I mean, I've been discussing how Connext has been doing this and hot protocol is going to be doing this, but now we have another entrant in loop ring. Really glad to see more entrants here. Centralized exchanges can now easily support withdrawing directly to loopring ZK rollup using standard l one functionality while still reaping the gap, the cost savings of l two. It's also much easier for centralized exchanges to allow users to deposit to a centralized exchange using cheaper again, I've gone on about this for months now.
00:20:54.252 - 00:21:25.682, Speaker A: We know we need centralized exchanges to kind of bridge into Altoos and the Altus need to make it as easy as possible for them to do this and by using the same l one functionality. This is what loopring has done here. All of this is expected to be available in May of 2021 as part of the loop Ring 3.7 release. May is just a month away, right? They don't give a date here, but at most it's going to be six weeks till the end of maybe. That's coming really, really quickly and I'm just like super excited to see this. Now, if you want the full details, they have a blog post here which you can go read.
00:21:25.682 - 00:21:45.804, Speaker A: You know, you can see how it works and kind of like what's under the hood here. It'll be linked in the YouTube description. I won't go through it. I got a lot more to get through and I'm at the 20 minutes mark already. But yeah, this is just super exciting. Solely needed and loopring once again killing the game on the l two front. All right, now we get to some of the fun stuff that I wanted to talk about.
00:21:45.804 - 00:22:28.640, Speaker A: Got to do with EIP 1559 and like the ETH two merge and all that's good stuff. All right, I did write about this in the Daily Gray newsletter as well, so definitely go check that out because it was quite a bullish piece. And with ETH moving up in price, I just felt really bullish today. So I was just like, okay, I'm going to write something like really bullish that I've been sitting on for quite a while. But anyway, I'm going to explain it for you today. Let's go. So Lamboshi put out this really great tweet where he said if 1559 and the merge were active today, there would have been 839 new ETH issued and 15,120 ETH burnt validators would have received 6480 ETH in transaction fees, which, when annualized, works out to 69% APR for staking.
00:22:28.640 - 00:22:54.756, Speaker A: So to put this into perspective, currently, when you stake on ETH two, you are only getting the block rewards, which is, you know, I guess, like six, 7% right now. You're not getting fees, obviously, because there's no activity on the ETH two network right now. But once the merger is done, fees will be going to stakers. Right. The fees that aren't burned. Like, you know, AIP 1559 is going to burn most of the fees. And I think Lembelshi here is assuming a 70% fee burn.
00:22:54.756 - 00:23:26.070, Speaker A: So those 30% fees that aren't burned are going directly to stakers. Now, that greatly increases the staking APR, and it would work out to 69% annualized here. Now, what do you think's going to happen when people see that you can get 69% on your ethnicity? They're going to put more ETH into staking. Right. And I spoke about this, and this, and this actually speaks to Cyrus's tweet here. And I called this the ETH super cycle in my newsletter. Now, basically, the way the super cycle goes is that you will have ETH is staked to secure the beacon chain.
00:23:26.070 - 00:23:38.062, Speaker A: Right. This. This is. I should step back. Sorry, this is in a post ERP 15 and post ETH one to ETH two merge world. This is when both, you know that both of those kind of upgrades are done. So this is how the super cycle goes.
00:23:38.062 - 00:24:17.680, Speaker A: Step one, ETH is staked to secure the beacon chain. Step two, staked ETH earns rewards via a block reward, right? The. The block issuance, that's the new ETH issued every block fees generated by the network and Mev minor extractable value generated by the network as well. And in addition to this, value is driven to ETH via burn fees with 1559. Right. Third step, the beacon chain staking API is high because of these value drivers that I just described. Fourth, more ETH is staked to capture this high apr, right? And fifth, the ETH price naturally goes up over the long term due to this fee burn and due to more ETH being locked in, staking.
00:24:17.680 - 00:24:43.438, Speaker A: And then step six. Well, step six is repeat steps one to five. Right. Now, obviously, over time, all of these steps will have diminishing returns where, you know, there won't be as much ETH staked each time and the APR is going to come down. But. But, you know, as kind of like, as some of you may know, there is actually a soft limit on how much ETH can be staked as well, based on the validator count, which is around 30 million right now. But 30 million ETH staked is absolutely massive.
00:24:43.438 - 00:25:09.580, Speaker A: For context, currently what's staked is 4 million. So if we get to, like, the limit, the soft limit, so to speak. Cause I think more ETH can be staked, but just more. More validators can't come online. So you basically go into a queue where you have to wait for other validators to exit and you can enter. But essentially 30 million ETH right now is like 27% of the total supply or something like that. A crazy amount of ETH, right, which is like tens of billions of dollars of ETH being staked.
00:25:09.580 - 00:25:48.920, Speaker A: And if we reach that limit, right, we basically have, like pretty much 30 million ETH locked in perpetuity, in staking. We have all these fees being burned, you know, because of the Ethereum network activity, so high. And then because of that, we also have ETH price naturally going up over the long term because of that constant kind of like demand for ETH as an asset. Now, this is on top of all the other ETH use cases. This is on top of each use case in DeFi, right, which is already at 11 million ETH in there and growing. It is on top of institutions buying East ETH, which they haven't really even started doing yet. It's on top of each use as money within Ethereum, especially within the NFT economy.
00:25:48.920 - 00:26:06.726, Speaker A: It's on top of people using ETH as a store of value asset, right, just holding it in cold storage. And it's on top of people using ETH as an inflation hedge. Right. And any other kind of use cases or whatever we come up with in the future. Now, I haven't been shy about my price prediction for ETH. $10,000. I've been saying that for a while.
00:26:06.726 - 00:26:35.108, Speaker A: I said it back in 2019, in depth, the depths of the bear market. ETH was like 100 and something dollars and I said, you know, if all of this happens, if 1559 happens, if the if staking happens, which I did believe it would, right. This is going back to my fundamentals based investing. If all of that happens, then ETH will be worth 10,000, which is a $1.1 trillion market cap, which is BTC's current market cap. So we already have precedent for that. Now, that was before all of this came to light that I just explained to you.
00:26:35.108 - 00:26:56.742, Speaker A: Now, I think $10,000 is a bearish target. And this is not investment advice. Don't get me wrong. I'm not telling you that this is 100% going to happen, but I have very strong conviction on this, and it is a major reason why I don't plan to sell any of my ETH ever. I don't. I just don't want to give it up. I don't care if ETH goes to, then drops back to, you know, five k, and I could have sold and bought in cheaper.
00:26:56.742 - 00:27:20.280, Speaker A: I'm not a trader. I don't plan to time that. I. I'm talking long term, like decades. I just don't want to sell my ETH. I want to stake most of my ETH once the merger goes through, and I want to use some of it in DeFi as well. Now, in saying that, I said in my newsletter today that I think that if all of this pans out for ETH and Ethereum, then I see no reason why ETH can't be worth $10 trillion plus, which is gold's current market cap.
00:27:20.280 - 00:27:38.268, Speaker A: Gold does nothing. It is an unproductive asset. It literally just has value because it has value. It's men. You know, bitcoin being digital, gold can probably be argued it's the same thing. And from that point of view, why can gold be worth $10 trillion as an. As an unproductive asset, right.
00:27:38.268 - 00:28:17.010, Speaker A: That doesn't have a fee burn, or I guess like a burn on it, right? For example, and Ethereum and ETH can't be worth that. So if ETH is worth $10 trillion plus, you know, or more, that would give ETH a price of near $100,000. And I don't even think that's far fetched. I don't think that's crazy, because what's crazy is gold being worth $10 trillion. So if gold keeps losing its value, which I think it will, because if you've seen gold performance over the last year when it was supposed to perform at its best as an inflation hedge or as, like, the world going to shith. It didn't, it didn't perform at all. All that value, I think, flowed into crypto already, right? Or at least a lot of that.
00:28:17.010 - 00:28:48.886, Speaker A: So as value continues to bleed from these old traditional assets, like gold, like silver, and all this sort of stuff, right, that have very minimal utility. I know gold has some utility, but, you know, if it was actually rated based on its utility value, sorry, valued based on its utility value, it would be very small, it wouldn't be 10 trillion. So anyway, if we take that thesis as well, then there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that ETH can be worth $10,000,000,000,000.01 day. It's not going to happen tomorrow, it's not going to happen next month, it's not going to happen next year. But maybe it happens in ten years, right? And that's not even a long time. Like, I'm.
00:28:48.886 - 00:29:14.106, Speaker A: I'm 29, I can wait ten years. You know, depending on, like, your, your age, you know, ten years might be longer to you, but for me, I mean, that's not a long time to me. And at the same time, you don't just have to hold your ETH and do nothing with it. It is the most productive asset on the planet. You could do whatever you want with it, right? And as long as you keep, like, as I discussed yesterday, like a safe liquidation price, you. You can even borrow stable coins against it in yield farm. And if you just want to play it really safe, you just chuck it in staking.
00:29:14.106 - 00:30:03.718, Speaker A: You might just get, like, once the merger goes through, you know, maybe you're only getting ten to 15%. And I say only because maybe there's more lucrative opportunities in Defi, but that's 1015 percent on an asset that over the long term, you know, you believe is going to appreciate. So you just keep stacking ETH, right? Just keep stacking it. I'm not even talking about how, like, when the merger goes through, the ETH issuance drops by 90% to what it is now. And stakers aren't forced to sell like miners are, because stakers don't have giant ongoing costs like mining, hardware, maintenance, and electricity. So when you consider all of this together, it is extremely, extremely hard to imagine a reality where ETH isn't worth at least $1 trillion or a $10,000 ETH. And even in the, in the, in the most bullish case, or maybe even not in the most bullish case, but in a really bullish case, ETH being worth $100,000 per coin.
00:30:03.718 - 00:30:33.818, Speaker A: Right. Anyway, I'm going to stop there because I've gone over time. There's a few other things I want to kind of go through here, but that is the ultimate bull case for Ethereum, for ETH. If you aren't bought into that right after I just explained that whole bull case there, then maybe you will in the future, or maybe you're just not going to make it, as I like to say. But I'm not telling you to go, like, put your life savings into ETH, right? This is not investment advice. This is just how I approach Ethan as an asset and ethereum as a network. So I hope that has helped you.
00:30:33.818 - 00:31:44.312, Speaker A: I'm going to move on to the next stuff here and trying to get through this because I've gone over time and yeah, I mean, I put out this funny tweet today when I said, you know, you know that episode of South park when Cartman literally freezes himself because he couldn't handle waiting three weeks for the Nintendo Wii to be released. I mean, yeah, that's exactly how I feel about waiting for Erp 1559, even though it's only about three months away. But this is, I mean, just everything that I just explained to you is the reason why I can't wait for 1559 and then the merger, hopefully, you know, q one next year is even, is the next thing that I'm just going to be like, sitting around being like, oh God, I need it to happen sort of thing? So, yeah, just, just wanted to kind of like, cover how that had to do with what I just kind of spoke about there. So instadapp today released a l one to l two refinancing bridge between Ethereum and Polygon here. So essentially what this allows you to do is automatically migrate your l one positions or debt positions on Aaver to, to polygon in a single click and at fractions of a penny. This is what we need, right? We need these solutions for people to kind of migrate from layer one to L2 in a really easy way. Now, polygons first, I'm sure instead app is going to do this for the other L2 solutions when they come online, like the generalized ones.
00:31:44.312 - 00:32:15.564, Speaker A: But this is exactly what we need here. If you want to learn how it works, the blog post is here. I'll link it in the YouTube description, but I'm going to, going to move on because I'm running out of time here. Dharma announced today that you can now go from dollars to Defi in all 50 states in the US. So if you are based in the US, you can deposit up to $25,000 per week, no matter the state that you're in, directly from your bank account into a bunch of Defi apps including Uniswap, Compound, Aave, Yearn and pull together. Amazing work here from Dharma to get more people on boarded into DeFi. Really, really great to see this.
00:32:15.564 - 00:32:49.690, Speaker A: I'm not using it because obviously I'm not in the US and I think this is more for many of the normies within, within Defi rather than us power users. But still, this is what we need to get more people into this ecosystem. A big release here from a new platform called Crystal. So Crystal Defi here, basically what this is, this is an app that's one platform for all of Defi. I think this is like basically Kyber networks, I guess like go at what Dharma's building. So great to see some, some competition here. It allows you to like swap tokens on uniswap and things like that.
00:32:49.690 - 00:33:27.896, Speaker A: Allows you to earn with one click deposits to earn interest on compound and aave and stuff like that. And it's like a referral program. Anyway, I'll link this so you can get more details in it in the YouTube description below because I think this is really, really exciting. Finally, here we have a really great blog post from Barnaby who describes the road to Ethereum. Ethereum being, you know, the ETH one to ETH two merge. Visualizing emerged data sharded, roll up centric future for Ethereum, these words just make me buzz because when you understand what these words mean and what they mean for Ethereum, you can get pretty excited about it. I definitely recommend going and giving this a full read through.
00:33:27.896 - 00:33:55.524, Speaker A: It gives you a really great recap of how, you know, the ETH one to ETH two merge is going to go through what a roll up centric kind of like world looks like for Ethereum, what the difference is between the Ethereum execution layer and application layer and all this sort of stuff. So yeah, definitely go check that out if you haven't yet, and I will leave it at that. Thank you everyone for listening and watching.
