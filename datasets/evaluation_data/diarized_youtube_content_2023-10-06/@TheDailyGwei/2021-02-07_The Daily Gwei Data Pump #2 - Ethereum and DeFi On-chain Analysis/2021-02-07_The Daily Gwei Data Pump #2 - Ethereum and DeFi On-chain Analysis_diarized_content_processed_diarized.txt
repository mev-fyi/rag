00:00:00.560 - 00:00:31.236, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the second episode of the Dailyguide data pump. In these episodes, I give an analysis of the different Ethereum on chain metrics as well as the Defi on chain metrics. The last time I did one of these episodes was December 15. So we're going to be going over the data from December 15 to February 7. So let's jump right into it, everyone. So, obviously, a lot has happened since December 15, both on chain and off chain. I did want to give a quick recap on the price, since, as I guess it's not exactly on chain, but it has a lot to do with the on chain metrics.
00:00:31.236 - 00:00:47.092, Speaker A: And I'm going to show you what I mean by that. But basically, if we go back to December 15, which is. What about here? You can see it if I scroll across here. So December 15, we're at about dollar 600 around that, and then since then, we've obviously gone up to over $1,600.
00:00:47.148 - 00:00:47.388, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:47.436 - 00:01:01.138, Speaker A: So it's been a pretty crazy ride in just a couple of months. Not even a couple of months. So, yeah, it's been really wild to see that. And, of course, if I zoom out here onto the one week chart, we can kind of see, just, like, how insane this kind of growth has been.
00:01:01.186 - 00:01:01.442, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:01.498 - 00:01:22.482, Speaker A: Like, this is. This is the chart from Kraken. So it shows. Kraken's chart shows basically the entire price history of Ethereum, basically from when it first went live, because they were the first exchange to list Ethereum, I'm pretty sure. And you can just see, like, this is crazy. I mean, you know, this whole kind of, like, bear market that we just went through kind of just looks like nothing now that we're up here.
00:01:22.538 - 00:01:23.150, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:23.322 - 00:01:28.590, Speaker A: So really, really cool to see that now, that's obviously played a lot into the different on chain metrics we've been seeing.
00:01:28.702 - 00:01:29.046, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:29.110 - 00:01:35.406, Speaker A: Price movements and price volatility on the Ethereum network lead to a lot more usage because there's decentralized exchanges.
00:01:35.510 - 00:01:35.966, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:36.070 - 00:01:51.978, Speaker A: There's different defi apps. Like, we have, like, even more complex defi apps coming online now. So, yeah, I'm gonna be going through all that. Of course I'm gonna be going through stuff. Got to do with the gas fees as well, and kind of like the growth around that and. And metrics around that, too. So, yeah, that's enough on the price.
00:01:51.978 - 00:02:21.384, Speaker A: Let's jump right into the metrics. So the first metric I've got here is one that I went through last time. So this is basically a correlation between the BTC and ETH price. So you can see here that during bear markets, the correlation is quite high. And that's because, like, everything tends to fall together, right? Bitcoin falls less than ETH, ETH falls less than other coins, but they all tend to fall together. Now, you can see that you, you know, during September, October, November, December, the correlation broke down pretty heavily. Now, I guess, you know, to the end.
00:02:21.384 - 00:02:25.472, Speaker A: Towards the end of December, Ethereum was bleeding against bitcoin pretty, pretty brutally.
00:02:25.528 - 00:02:25.744, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:25.784 - 00:02:46.140, Speaker A: It wasn't doing very well. You know, the ratio, I think, went to 0.022 or something like that. Something crazy, right? It wasn't doing very well at all. And then Ethereum kind of sprang to life in January, and the correlation kind of started going back up a little bit. So not too much of an update there. I think I definitely went through this metric on the last data pump.
00:02:46.140 - 00:03:16.502, Speaker A: But, yeah, this is something that I like to keep an eye on because it's just really, really interesting to see how the correlations kind of change over time. So this is a really cool metric I like to keep an eye on as well. It's from into the block. And what this shows is how many ethereum addresses on chain are in or out of the money with ETH. So basically, if they're in profit on their ETH buy or not, now, 99% of all addresses are currently in profit because we kind of hit, I think, you know, over 1700. Then we've come back down a bit. You know, current price is 1630.
00:03:16.502 - 00:03:57.062, Speaker A: So there were some buyers up above this current price. But, you know, the other day it was actually 100% of all on chain addresses were in profit, which was pretty cool. But even it's still really cool that 99% of addresses are in profit, right? Like, just imagine you bought ETH in January 2018 at $1,400, right? You only had to wait like a, I mean, it is kind of a long time. It gets us like three years. But, I mean, in, we're spoiled in crypto, I think, you know, three years is not that long in the traditional finance space, but in crypto, it feels like, you know, an eternity. But, you know, after three years, you were basically back in the money, right? Back over fourteen hundred dollars. And I'm sure, you know, anyone who bought at that price probably sold.
00:03:57.062 - 00:04:28.268, Speaker A: So it's kind of an irrelevant thing there, but still kind of fun to see that all the people that bought in all these price ranges, right, are pretty much like, sitting in profit right now. Now, of course, you know, we don't know where the price is going to go from here. So could go back to $1,000, could go to 2000. Who knows, right? I mean, you know, it just depends on what the market wants to do. And then obviously if it went to under $1,000, you know, or about $1,000, some people will be in loss, some people will still be in profit, and then that percentage will go down. So I really like this, this metric. And they have a bunch of different ways of showing it here.
00:04:28.268 - 00:05:35.050, Speaker A: So they have like this, this stacked chart here and you can kind of see like, you know, all this red is just like pain, right? All these addresses that hold ETH that is underwater. And then, you know, as time goes on, we kind of get this. You know, it goes from pain to joy and happiness, right. You know, I bet a lot of these people actually forgot that they had ETH, right? Because when you buy it at such a high price and then, like, the price goes down and maybe you didn't put too much money into it, you're just like, oh, whatever, it's, you know, it's, it's lost money. Who cares, right? So, yeah, but this, this also illustrates why bear markets are so brutal and why it takes so long for the price to kind of, like, continue going up, right? You need to kind of flush out, I guess, like everyone that wants to sell, essentially, so, and the market has to regain confidence. So we obviously had, like a really major blow off top in the markets in kind of late 2017, early 2018, where it crashed really hard, bounced up again, as it usually does, and then kind of bled out from there. And then you kind of have to have this long accumulation period where things are, like, bleeding and you're waiting for people to kind of like, you know, finally just get flushed out and then slowly you can start moving back up again.
00:05:35.050 - 00:06:09.628, Speaker A: And it works both ways. Like, it's this concept of, like, reflexivity, right, where the price is reflexive in both ways and, you know, betting against, you know, the momentum is very hard. So, you know, and there's people that kind of bought during this bear market to its specific price points that were underwater for a period of time. You know, for example, I bought ETH. I think it was like towards the end of 2018, it was October, and I think the price was around $220 and I bought a bunch of ETH there. I'm like, you know what? This, this feels like the bottom. You know, let's just buy some ETH here.
00:06:09.628 - 00:06:27.848, Speaker A: Now, obviously that wasn't the bottom, right? The bottom was $80. And that only happened, you know, that only ended up happening like in December, but it's very hard to peak bottom. So I obviously I didn't regret that purchase. You know, I, I bought a 220 because I figured it would go back up to all time high and beyond one day. So there's a lot of people like me, I have a lot of friends who do the same thing.
00:06:27.896 - 00:06:28.296, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:28.400 - 00:06:46.298, Speaker A: I don't know. I know one person that actually bought the exact bottom one. Out of all my ethereum friends, only one person that I know bought the bottom. And, you know, that was obviously an amazing trade. But yeah, that, that, besides that, most people I know bought on the way down. So you also have to account for that.
00:06:46.346 - 00:06:46.578, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:46.626 - 00:07:14.866, Speaker A: Where the people buying on the way down, you know, depending on where they bought, maybe they bought at $700 on the way down. You know, as time goes on, they may capitulate and be like, oh, well, I'm just going to write off this buy, right. Because in the depths of a bear market, you just don't know, you know, you don't know when the bull market's coming back. It's a completely different thing. You have faith, but, you know, if you need the money, you're just going to sell. So I guess that's kind of like why these cycles take a long time and this is a great way of visualizing it. So, yeah, enough about that.
00:07:14.866 - 00:07:33.768, Speaker A: Let's move on to Defi growth now. So DeFi growth has absolutely exploded. It's actually gone more than double since my last data pump video here, I think. So December 15, we had $13.8 billion locked in Defi. We're now up to 34 billion at time of recording for this video. So obviously more than half here.
00:07:33.768 - 00:07:44.704, Speaker A: Sorry, more than double the growth here. The ETH growth as well has been very interesting. So December 15, we had, what was it, 7 million ETH in there. Now we have 7.5 million.
00:07:44.824 - 00:07:45.512, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:45.688 - 00:08:20.092, Speaker A: I've explained before how we had even more than that back in November, where it was 9 million ETH in Defi and we dropped because the uniswap liquidity mining finished and ETH two launched. So a lot of that ETH went into ETH two, which I'm going to go through in this video. I've got a bunch of ETH two metrics I want to look at. But, yeah, so it's remained kind of steady. It kind of fell a little bit here, but then it's been, it's been trending back up, which is cool to see here. And of course, BTC locked in DeFi has also been a pretty huge thing. And Defy pulse actually has an entirely different section here now called BTC at work where they basically show what the trend has been like here.
00:08:20.092 - 00:08:21.740, Speaker A: And it's been. It's been pretty crazy.
00:08:21.772 - 00:08:21.940, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:21.972 - 00:08:42.632, Speaker A: You can see basically, you know, 2020, I mean, during, I guess, Defi summer is when we saw all the growth here. So, yeah, pretty crazy growth here. And it's continued growing. There's 166,000 bitcoin on a theorem right now, which I think is worth, what, $6.5 billion, which is a crazy amount. And a lot of that has gone into projects like Badger Dao. I'm not sure if.
00:08:42.632 - 00:08:51.804, Speaker A: If. Oh, yeah, they do. They track Badger dow here on. On defi pulse here. So Badger Dao is actually 8th in TVL. And a lot of that TVL is. Is bitcoin.
00:08:51.804 - 00:08:59.428, Speaker A: Badgerdao is for those who don't know, it's basically a Defi app that has a lot of. I guess, like, it's targeted towards bitcoin.
00:08:59.476 - 00:08:59.612, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:59.628 - 00:09:23.182, Speaker A: It has a lot of bitcoin kind of opportunities to earn yield on your bitcoin and things like that. So, yeah, that's been the growth there. But we have a few new entrants as well up here. You know, Alpha Homora is definitely a kind of, like, standout here. So you can actually see, last time I did this video, I don't even think I talked about it was only 100 million locked in it. Now it's up to a billion. So we've had a ten times growth in less than two months on Alpha here.
00:09:23.182 - 00:09:41.166, Speaker A: We can go back and we can see a bunch of them in here. I mean, you know, everyone's favorites are still up here. You know, Maker is still number one. I think Maker dropped to number two, or Ava and compound got number one at one point. But maker seems to be firmly in the lead now with $5.8 billion locked, you know, ETH, 2.9 million ETH.
00:09:41.166 - 00:09:59.220, Speaker A: So that's by far the most amount of ETH locked in. In Defi. You know, compound is a distant second at 1.3 million ETH locked, and then unisops close there at 1 million. So, yeah, maker is still number one there. And there's a bunch here, others here, like cream finance, harvest finance, you know, I mean, yearn's been there. Everyone's favorites are kind of.
00:09:59.220 - 00:10:07.148, Speaker A: Kind of in here now. But one. One trend that obviously is playing out here is that we're seeing a lot of projects just get more overall TVL.
00:10:07.236 - 00:10:07.460, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:07.492 - 00:10:23.250, Speaker A: So if you go. If you go just maker as like, the example here. If we go here, right? And you go to December 15, last time I did this, the last video, it was $2.6 billion locked. Now it's, you know, 5.8 billion just two months later. So we've kind of, like, doubled the growth across the board of all these different apps.
00:10:23.250 - 00:10:46.926, Speaker A: And, you know, the ceiling, I guess, or at least like the kind of maximum amount of value locked is kind of getting higher and higher. And we're seeing other projects kind of enter this as well. So, yeah, there's so many projects here now. I mean, it's pretty crazy to see how many. There are 64 kind of projects here right now. So, yeah, really, really great to see the Defi growth. And, yeah, I think bitcoin on ethereum is also a standout thing here.
00:10:46.926 - 00:11:14.748, Speaker A: The fact that it's still going up, you know, like this so fast, I mean, it's. It's pretty crazy. I mean, it did dip for a little bit, but it's definitely going back up. And I think that's due to badger Dow, if I'm being honest, because I think Badger Dow launched around here. So, yeah, just, I guess, like, shows, like, what the power of incentives will do, right. People are going to come over, they're going to do different things within Badger, you know, and the top kind of tokenized BTC is wrapped. Bitcoin, second is actually hobby BTC, which is surprising there.
00:11:14.748 - 00:11:49.702, Speaker A: And then you have Ren BTC as a third here. So, yeah, really great to see the growth in defi here. All right, onto Dex metrics. So this dashboard I've gone through plenty of times on the refuel, but I love this dashboard from doing analytics that tracks decentralized exchange metrics, I basically visit this, like, almost every day, pretty much. It's such a great dashboard now, obviously, you know, decentralized exchanges have grown a lot lately. You know, I think in particular, not just, like uniswap, but other Dexes are now kind of gaining market share here. And you can see the volume is absolutely insane, right? $1.7
00:11:49.702 - 00:12:26.946, Speaker A: billion in the last 24 hours, $14 billion over the last seven days, and 55 billion over the last 30 days. And if we scroll down a bit here and we can actually scroll down to the charts that show the monthly trends. The monthly trend here was crazy, right? Like, this was January. We did $63 billion of volume in January, which smashed the last all time high record in September of $29 billion. And obviously in September of 2020, it was the middle of defi summer, right? So we just smashed that. We've gone more than double kind of there. And I'm noticing kind of a theme here, right, that we've more than doubled across all these metrics in a couple of months, which is really, really cool.
00:12:26.946 - 00:13:03.860, Speaker A: We're seven days into February right now. We've already done $15 billion. You know, if we keep going at this pace, we should kind of overtake what we did in 2020, which is, which is quite insane, right? So, I mean, I think the January 2020 volume, 2021 volume, is actually half that of the whole 2020 volume. So if we do the same amount in February, we will have done more volume in two months, in 2021 than the whole of 2020. So that's quite, quite insane to see. And over the last twelve months alone, we've done almost $200 billion, and there's been 1.2 million total unique trading addresses.
00:13:03.860 - 00:13:31.176, Speaker A: I've gone through how trading addresses aren't, you know, one to one to people before, right, where people can have multiple addresses. So I would say maybe there's like three or 400,000 kind of unique people here. And even that might be being generous, but it's always hard to kind of measure that. And as I said, you know, there's been kind of different dexes gaining different market share here. So you can see the kind of the volume by kind of market here or by app. So Uniswap, of course, is number one. It's on the left side here.
00:13:31.176 - 00:13:57.554, Speaker A: I'm just looking at. So Sushiswap is number two, which is actually caught up a lot. So sushiswap was, I think the last time I did the video was kind of like $200 million locked and, like, kind of thought of to be dead and all that sort of stuff. But since then, it's come a long way, obviously. And they're, you know, they're doing a lot of volume. It's uniswap still doing 51% of the volume, but Sushiswap is now doing 24%. Zero X has actually been a standout over the past couple months as well.
00:13:57.554 - 00:14:04.466, Speaker A: They're now doing over a billion volume. They weren't even really on this chart before. They were pretty low here. Curve continues to do good volumes.
00:14:04.530 - 00:14:04.754, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:04.794 - 00:14:24.580, Speaker A: A billion dollars here. And then you have, like, kind of this balance, almost 500 million over the last seven days. DYDX at 241 million. And DyDX has grown a lot recently, too. Then a bunch of the other ones here. So, yeah, it's, it's funny, because you can actually go here and see the historical thing where uniswap kind of dominated.
00:14:24.612 - 00:14:24.804, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:24.844 - 00:14:42.100, Speaker A: You can see pink on the, on the left chart here. Pink is uniswap and purple is sushiswap. And you can actually see sushiswap kind of like, I guess towards the end of last year, you know, it had volume, but it was kind of like stagnant. It wasn't growing. And now in January of 2021, you can see that sushiswap grew a lot.
00:14:42.172 - 00:14:42.572, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:42.668 - 00:15:12.498, Speaker A: Curve grew some more here. Curve is in brown and then zero x is in, is in kind of gray down the bottom. So we had like this kind of, I guess diversification happen within these different decentralized exchanges, which has been really, really cool to see. One thing you'll notice here, that one inch isn't here. Obviously, one inch kind of sits on top of all of these kind of protocols. So, you know, I think there's a separate dashboard for one inch. I haven't got that up right now, but you can see that on the right hand side here they have a dashboard or they have a table.
00:15:12.498 - 00:15:29.064, Speaker A: Sorry, that shows number of traders for the last seven days or one inch is leading by a lot, right, sorry. Uniswap is leading by a lot, but one inch is actually second. So I would say that one inch is one of the top kind of like volume dexes here. But you know, one inch is a Dex aggregator, so it's not a Dex itself.
00:15:29.184 - 00:15:29.728, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:29.856 - 00:16:05.516, Speaker A: They do have their own Dex called mini swap, which is number eleven down here if you actually see on the left hand side. But yeah, I think there's a, there's a different dashboard that splits out their volume there. So all in all, a very, very big month for decentralized exchanges, as I'm sure you're all aware if you've been paying attention. And yeah, I mean, it's just crazy that we're consistently over a billion dollars of 24 hours volume when less than a year ago, you know, Uniswap in May of 2020 was only doing $10 million of 24 hours volume. Now it's doing over a billion dollars. So really, really impressive growth there. So on to the metrics from glass node here.
00:16:05.516 - 00:16:31.830, Speaker A: So glass node is actually one of my favorite websites to go on to track different metrics here. You should definitely check them out. But basically what this metric is showing is the number of Ethereum addresses with a balance of more than 10,000 ETH. Now you can see that the growth here has actually been quite, quite crazy. Right from, I guess, like the end of December. And as I explained before, the ETH BTC ratio was falling towards the end of December, so people weren't really stockpiling ETH. Then the momentum shift shifted.
00:16:31.862 - 00:16:32.030, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:32.062 - 00:17:02.148, Speaker A: And the ratio went up and ETH started kind of like, exploding. I mean, towards the kind of end of December, ETH basically teleported through the late hundreds and went into, like, the thousands very, very quickly. So you can see here that it bottomed at December 28 where there was 1059 addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH. Now there's 1086 addresses. So that might not sound like a big jump, but that's like 35 new addresses or I think I'm doing my math correctly there. You know, probably more than that. Or that are holding more than 10,000 ETH.
00:17:02.196 - 00:17:02.596, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:02.700 - 00:17:13.300, Speaker A: And if you do the math, that's over 350,000 ethics going to kind of these addresses. But that's much more than that because this isn't just like 10,000 ETH. This is 10,000 ETH and above.
00:17:13.412 - 00:17:13.804, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:13.884 - 00:17:32.108, Speaker A: So it could be someone holding, you know, 20,000 ETH or 30,000. So the growth here has been really cool. And this just, this is just showing kind of December to, I guess it's just showing to January 10. Yeah, I think there's might maybe a delay or maybe I was playing with the chart before. Okay, I reset the chart here. We can zoom out a little bit, actually. So to today, it's actually more.
00:17:32.108 - 00:17:47.714, Speaker A: It's 1101. Okay. So, so I had the chart messed up there. So I think that's what, since December 28, you know, it's another kind of 60, 60 or 50. Another 50 kind of addresses there. 40 or 50. So that's even more.
00:17:47.794 - 00:17:48.178, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:48.266 - 00:17:52.170, Speaker A: And then if we actually go down to where it bottomed in kind of September on October.
00:17:52.322 - 00:17:52.754, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:52.834 - 00:18:07.616, Speaker A: It, you know, it's about 80 or 70 new addresses here. I'm failing my math today. So. Yeah. And this tracks it all the way kind of back to, I guess, where does it track it? Yeah. When the Ethereum network launched. And you can actually see how this has evolved over time.
00:18:07.680 - 00:18:08.240, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:08.392 - 00:18:41.936, Speaker A: And throughout January 2017, or, sorry. Throughout 2017, it kept increasing and then it kind of sp, it kind of peaked in, in March of 2018 at a 1127 addresses holding it here. It dropped very, very rapidly throughout. I guess 2018 dropped by about 80 and then it went up again through 2019. If you don't, if you guys remember, the price went up through 2019 as well to about $380. So back up to 1020 here, 1120, sorry. And then, yeah, we just trended down since then.
00:18:41.936 - 00:18:51.272, Speaker A: And now we're seeing this kind of, like, spike again, right, in whales kind of collecting Ethan and buying up the ETH, which is a very positive sign, as you can see.
00:18:51.328 - 00:18:51.664, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:51.744 - 00:19:08.014, Speaker A: They usually kind of follow price, it seems, you know, so you can see here in 2017 was actually a very positive sign that this was happening. And then 2018, obviously, bear market, you know, whales that kind of getting out. What's interesting is whales kind of weren't stacking e through kind of 2020 here.
00:19:08.054 - 00:19:08.374, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:08.454 - 00:19:40.570, Speaker A: They kind of, like, offloaded maybe, because they stacked during 2019. But then we can see that they've started stacking it again here. So really positive kind of growth there. And, you know, glass node doesn't just show a 10,000 ethan above here, they actually show 1000 Ethan above. So you can kind of see what's happening here that seems to be going down, which is, which is curious. You know, maybe this is people, you know, going into the 10,000 or more kind of ETH category. Maybe they're offloading and they're going into, like, the 100 or ETH, 100 ETH or more category.
00:19:40.642 - 00:19:40.826, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:40.850 - 00:19:49.650, Speaker A: There's a. There's a number of reasons here. What I like to look at is, like, the smaller units here. So you can see the addresses with a balance of more than one ETH has been going up very steadily.
00:19:49.722 - 00:19:50.146, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:50.250 - 00:19:59.324, Speaker A: Kind of fell off a cliff here a little bit. I wonder why that was. Maybe that's an error with the data. But, yeah, generally the trend has been. Has been up no matter what the price is doing.
00:19:59.404 - 00:19:59.956, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:00.100 - 00:20:22.592, Speaker A: And then addresses with a balance of more than ten ETH has been going up steadily as well. Again, we're seeing a little bit of a drop off here. I'm not sure why that is, but basically, yeah, a bit of a drop off here, but generally kind of up here. And then it just is with a balance of 0.1 or more ETH, which is actually not a small amount today. It's like $160 right at time of recording. And this is generally trending up as well.
00:20:22.592 - 00:20:29.296, Speaker A: But I think, you know, it might be trending up, too, because $160 is like a couple of Uniswap chase these days.
00:20:29.360 - 00:20:29.752, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:29.848 - 00:20:49.002, Speaker A: So. And you need ETH for gas. So definitely that's playing a part into it. And then addresses with a balance of more than 0.01 ETH, which, you know, at current prices is $16 is going up, too. But at the same time, you know, there might be a lot of addresses that have kind of 0.01 ETH stuck in it because of the gas fees, too.
00:20:49.002 - 00:21:17.754, Speaker A: I don't think it costs $16 to send ETH unless the gas is really high. But in general, I can see that playing a part. But again, this is going up to right here. Now, there is another metric where you can actually see the dollar amounts, but this is part of the t three, tier three kind of data here on glass node, which you have to pay extra money for, which I don't have. So I can only see the data from a year ago. So there's not really any point kind of looking at this data, unfortunately. But, yeah, there is that option there, if you do pay for that kind of service that.
00:21:17.754 - 00:21:41.766, Speaker A: So this is another kind of metric from glass note here that shows the ethereum balance on exchanges or the ETH balance on exchanges. So if I reset the kind of timeframe here to an all time kind of stacked thing, you can kind of see, you know, how it's. How it's changed over the years. So during 2017, the balance, or 2016 and 2017, the balance of Ethan exchanges kind of dropped dramatically.
00:21:41.830 - 00:21:42.198, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:42.286 - 00:22:04.092, Speaker A: I think at peak. Peaked at. What was it? What's the total here? I don't think there's a total. I can see here on the left here. Yeah, it peaked at about 20, what, 1 million, which was actually a large chunk of the supply in 2016. I think the supply was maybe 80 million ETH back then. And then, you know, you can see it kind of dramatically falling right up until the end or right up until, like, February 2018 here.
00:22:04.092 - 00:22:48.856, Speaker A: And it fell to about five point, what? Or 6 million here. Just eyeballing it. And then, you know, it kind of, like, skyrocketed kind of back up, I guess, like, during 2018 and 2019 and even 2020, all the way back up to about, you know, I guess 18 million ETH. And then when the kind of bull market really kicked off in August of 2020, we've seen, like, a dramatic amount of ETH come up, come off exchanges. I think we peaked up here just eyeballing it, maybe 18 million ETH in exchanges, and then we've gone down and it's like, what, 14, 14 million ETH, I would say. So 4 million ETH has come off exchanges here. And I think, you know, with ETH, it's funny because when ETH gets off exchanges, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going into cold storage.
00:22:48.920 - 00:22:49.096, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:49.120 - 00:23:13.010, Speaker A: Or to someone's kind of wallet. It could also mean that it's going into Defi and there's a chart that I kind of posted to Twitter a little while ago. I don't think I have it up here now, but I can get it up. It basically shows that the kind of like ETH in smart contracts versus the ETH in, uh, in centralized exchanges. Now, if I check here, let me check quickly. I don't think I've got. No, I don't think I've got it there.
00:23:13.010 - 00:23:44.458, Speaker A: But if I go to compare it here and I'll actually show you what this looks like. So this is actually neat. With glass node, you can compare different metrics. And I know I'm showing glass node a lot here, and I'm not paid to do that or anything like that. I just really enjoy this website. So if I go to exchange balance percent, right, and then I change the second metric to ethereum, and I put in here smart contract balance supply and smart contracts, right? And I always like to do the moving averages just to smoothen the data out. So I have a 14 day moving average and a 14 day.
00:23:44.458 - 00:24:25.218, Speaker A: So you can see here, right on this chart, the pink line is the Ethereum balance or the ETH balance on exchanges. And the green line is the ETH balance in smart contracts. Now, you might notice this giant kind of spike on the left hand side here, where kind of like, I think my camera is covering it, but basically, the Ethan smart contracts was 4%, and then it spiked all the way to 25% or 23.4%. Now, the astute observer and someone who's been around for a while, we know exactly what happened here. But for those who don't, if anyone remembers the DaO, right, the first ICO on Ethereum, or the first big ICO on Ethereum, and it got a lot of ETH onto kind of like the smart contract here. You know, it raised a lot of ETH. And then we had the dow hack kind of happen.
00:24:25.218 - 00:25:03.528, Speaker A: Right, unfortunately. And then that ETH kind of came right out of that contract, but we did kind of finish up higher than what we were. And then during 2017, it's funny because you would have expected during 2017, during ICO mania, Ethan smart contracts to kind of go up here. But actually, if I remember correctly, in 2017, a lot of kind of like icos were done with just like, externally owned accounts or just normal Ethereum address addresses or Ethereum accounts, not smart contract accounts. So that's why you don't kind of see a spike here. But then, you know, during 2019, it went down even more. I think 2019 was pretty brutal in terms of the bull, the bear market.
00:25:03.528 - 00:25:28.988, Speaker A: And people were kind of like exiting, you know, where they had their ETH. We had maker during kind of 2019. And I think people might, maybe got liquidated and stuff like that because of the bear market. And then, though, you can see in 2020 that we've had this massive kind of, like, rise of Ethan smart contracts. I think it bottomed out in June at about at least 11%. Now it's up to kind of 18%. And in the same time, we've seen ETH kind of on exchanges, drop off kind of dramatically, too.
00:25:28.988 - 00:25:44.772, Speaker A: You can kind of see the green and the pink lines diverge here. Now, this is really cool because that means that this ETH, and I can kind of zoom in here, that ETH is going from centralized exchanges to smart contracts. Not all of it, but. But some of it, right. Which. Which I thought was. Was really interesting.
00:25:44.772 - 00:25:48.870, Speaker A: And I've posted this to Twitter a few times, and it kind of speaks what we're trying to do in ethereum.
00:25:48.902 - 00:25:49.022, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:49.038 - 00:25:50.070, Speaker A: We're trying to go bankless.
00:25:50.142 - 00:25:50.374, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:50.414 - 00:26:08.598, Speaker A: We're trying to get off these centralized exchanges and get our ETH off there and put them into smart contracts. So I thought that was really cool. And, yeah, this. The kind of balance of ethan exchanges now is only 13.5% out of a 112 $113 million supply. So 13. Kind of 113 million supply, not dollar supply.
00:26:08.598 - 00:26:18.658, Speaker A: Sorry. Which means that, you know, I guess 13% of that napkin math is maybe 12 million or something. 13, 14 million. Ethics on exchanges still, which isn't too much.
00:26:18.706 - 00:26:18.890, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:18.922 - 00:26:51.886, Speaker A: And I think we're seeing more and more kind of get out of exchanges as time goes on, as this bull market goes on, as more people kind of like, buy Ethan, wanna take it off exchanges and kind of just keep it in cold storage or put it into deFi. Right, which I think is very, very positive. Next metric here is obviously the total transaction fees paid on the network. So that's been like a sore spot, I guess, for a lot of people lately. The gas fees have been incredibly high. Now, what this chart is showing is gas fees as. As measured in ETH, right? So denominated in ETH, not denominated in USD.
00:26:51.886 - 00:27:00.998, Speaker A: And it's only showing 2020. So if I actually zoom out here to all time, you can see that even though it's just transaction fees denominated in ETH.
00:27:01.046 - 00:27:01.254, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:01.294 - 00:27:06.278, Speaker A: It's still, like a lot of ETH, which is. Which is quite crazy. And it's been going up pretty, pretty crazily.
00:27:06.326 - 00:27:06.822, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:06.958 - 00:27:16.612, Speaker A: But then you can go to denominated in USD. And if we, once we load this, you can see that growth makes 2017, like, the end of the 2017 bull market look like nothing.
00:27:16.718 - 00:27:17.176, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:17.280 - 00:27:34.888, Speaker A: And we actually kind of have, have done $22 million of fees over the last 24 hours or so, I think, which is, which is crazy. I think, you know, that that's more than kind of like bitcoins all time record sort of thing. So. And, and obviously, the gas fees have been going up even, even higher than that.
00:27:34.936 - 00:27:35.524, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:35.944 - 00:28:19.172, Speaker A: It's pretty crazy because, like, now the kind of gas fees up to where the price kind of is. And, and I think, like, I mean, it's, it's just, I don't, I hate to say it, but I don't expect this to kind of, like, go down while there's a bull market happening, while there's volatility happening. Because I've mentioned this before, and I actually saw Hayden Adams recently tweet about this and confirm it, that a lot of the transaction activity on the Ethereum main net is arbitrage bots. Now, what these bots do is they basically arbitrage between different liquidity pools on Ethereum. So for an example here, the arbitrage between sushiswap and Uniswap, right? If there's an ETH USD pair on uniswap and there's an ETH USD pair on sushiswap, they'll do an arbitrage when there's an arbitrage opportunity open there, and these bots will just outbid each other.
00:28:19.228 - 00:28:19.420, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:19.452 - 00:28:24.180, Speaker A: No one, when you're doing Arb, you don't actually care too much because it's basically free money besides the fees.
00:28:24.252 - 00:28:24.868, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:25.036 - 00:29:22.578, Speaker A: So, and I mean, for those of you who don't understand what an arbitrage transaction is, it's basically, you know, you can buy something cheaper somewhere else and sell it for more on another exchange. And this has been happening within the centralized exchange space for a while. And if you ever wondered why all the prices stay together and why they don't actually get too ahead of each other on different exchanges, this is why there's arbitrage bots that kind of close the loop, so to speak, here. So when price gets really, really volatile, you know, say, ETH just spikes up like 5% in an hour or whatever, the bots just go into overdrive, right? They have to close all these arbitrage opportunities, and that obviously pushes up the gas price because all the bots are trying to outbid each other, and it gets quite crazy. So that's one of the reasons why the gas fees spike during volatility. Another reason is because people, if it's going down, if the price is going down, people are trying to cover their leverage positions right, where they might have borrowed some funds and the price is going down really rapidly. And they're in like, oh, no mode.
00:29:22.626 - 00:29:23.538, Speaker B: Right, where they're like, oh, I got.
00:29:23.546 - 00:29:53.380, Speaker A: To close my position before I get liquidated. So there's that. And then there's also liquidator bots, right, that liquidate people and will also kind of like do kind of like a gas wall will bid up the gas because they don't care because they're about to kind of earn some, some nice money. So there, there's a lot of that stuff that goes on. So, you know, as we go through this bull market, the fees are going to definitely, I think, keep going up because of that. Definitely. But, you know, hopefully as we progress, you know, there are kind of pauses here.
00:29:53.380 - 00:30:18.562, Speaker A: I think right now it would be kind of a pause. I can see here the gas price is what, 100 way right now for, you know, 138 for rapid, 123 for fast. You know, that was over 200 for the last couple days. So we have some relief but still not ideal. And, you know, not ideal for end users but ideal for the network. I mean, this is, this has been insane. This growth is just crazy, right? And this has been sustained for a few days now or at least.
00:30:18.562 - 00:30:54.974, Speaker A: I mean, this spike here has been sustained for about a week. And the high fees in general have sustained since the start of Defi summer. You know, it's funny, like the, the historical way price, I think you can actually see it on gasnow.org. You can go back and see that even just like early last year, early 2020, we were blessed with like low double digit way. And now, you know, you'd be very, you know, kind of lucky to get double digit guy on most days, so. And that's high double digit guy. So, yeah, it's been very interesting to see the kind of gas kind of prices evolve here and how that's been going.
00:30:54.974 - 00:30:56.630, Speaker A: You know, maybe one day this is a blip.
00:30:56.662 - 00:30:57.010, Speaker B: Right? Right.
00:30:57.042 - 00:31:04.282, Speaker A: I don't know how high these prices can go before it becomes unsustainable as, you know, it's sustainable as long as kind of people are willing to pay the price.
00:31:04.378 - 00:31:04.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:04.994 - 00:31:23.916, Speaker A: And maybe it goes, you know, way higher than this. Maybe towards the end of the bull market we see like $1,000 or above just because there's so much volatility, right. There's so much craziness going on, you know, and you have to, when you're talking about these arbitrage things, it's not just between the ETH USD pair, it's between literally every token pair.
00:31:23.980 - 00:31:24.252, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:24.308 - 00:31:31.364, Speaker A: That has a liquidity pool within different exchanges. So that could be balance uniswap or sushi swap or Mooney swap or zero x.
00:31:31.404 - 00:31:31.748, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:31.836 - 00:31:53.944, Speaker A: There are so many different liquidity pools now. So, and then you just have you, you, you kind of like put on normal user usage on that, right? You put on smart contract deployment, which takes up a lot of block space. It just, it gets insane. So I wouldn't be surprised to see sustained four digit guy towards the end of the bull market as we get into like the crash crazy stage. But I don't, I don't suspect that to sustain itself.
00:31:54.024 - 00:31:54.312, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:54.368 - 00:32:16.084, Speaker A: Because like, for very long, because that's insane. I think, you know, at a thousand way, I think a normal Ethereum transaction would cost maybe $50, which is one of the cheapest things you can do on Ethereum. So if that me, if that's happening, then I think smart contract kind of interactions would be in the thousands of dollars. Some of them already are, but I would say that most of them would be in the mid thousands of dollars, which is obviously unsustainable.
00:32:16.184 - 00:32:16.636, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:16.740 - 00:32:42.774, Speaker A: There's only so much money people have to spend on these fees. But still, in general, I think that, you know, hopefully by that point we have EIP 1559 on the network so that some of these fees are burned. But we'll have to, we'll have to wait and see for sure. So speaking of kind of like, I guess like gas usage and kind of ethereum network usage, this, that's really cool. It basically shows. And I think I have to refresh it here. Yes, I have to refresh it here.
00:32:42.774 - 00:33:12.558, Speaker A: Let me get that, let me get that up. Oops. Let me refresh the page here to get the latest data. Basically what it shows is the number of smart contract calls, basically the number of people interacting with smart contracts, and how this has kind of gone up over time. Now, you can see that during kind of 2017, it went up a little bit, kind of plateaued during 2018, right. We had a bit more of use in 2019 and then just an explosion during 2020. And we've kind of plateaued lately, I think in terms of smart contract calls.
00:33:12.558 - 00:33:53.592, Speaker A: But a lot of this has got to do with DeFi, a lot of DeFi growth happening during specifically, I mean, a little bit in 2019, but specifically in 2020. I mean, you can see here, January kind of 29th, 2020 was, what, 321,000 calls kind of a day. And then up to here now we have like 741,000. So there's a lot of different kind of calls happening here. And this tracks the gas price, too, right. If you were to do a comparison between this and kind of the fees, you would see that the fees are going up with these smart contract kind of interactions. And these interactions are both people and bots and anyone kind of using the network and kind of, I guess, like the same reasons that I kind of explained before about why the gas prices are going up.
00:33:53.592 - 00:34:14.544, Speaker A: Like with the r bots and stuff. They also do this, right? They interact with smart contracts and they call them and stuff like that. So I thought this was a really interesting stat here. We actually hit an all time high in 2020 of, what, 790,000. And we've come down since then. But I expect we're probably going to go back up there and kind of like maybe go to a million over 24 hours. We'll have to see what happens there.
00:34:15.844 - 00:34:16.284, Speaker B: All right.
00:34:16.324 - 00:34:47.518, Speaker A: Onto the ETH two metrics. So I promised last episode that I would do some ETH two related metrics here, and I think this is a good starting point. So this basically shows the cumulative east sent to the deposit contract over time. Now, you can see here that, you know, we had like a very slow kind of start during November, right? The deposit contract was deployed November 3. And then you can kind of see the grind up here. Now, remember, if you remember correctly, 524,000 ETH was needed to bootstrap the chain. And people were kind of worried that we wouldn't get to that.
00:34:47.518 - 00:35:16.750, Speaker A: But you can see here, as we progress, we got to, like, I guess by November 20, we're at 148,000. And then it just grew exponentially right up to November 24, where we had 700,000. November 24 was the deadline for getting this kind of ethanol. And a lot of people were just waiting because there was no rush to get your ethan right, because there was no benefit for being early, essentially. So we got that. We, it happened, right. And then since then, we've seen this steady kind of growth, right? It's been, it's been quite steady with spikes here and there.
00:35:16.750 - 00:36:05.428, Speaker A: And we're almost at 3 million kind of ETH now in there, which I think is really, really cool. And this is before, like, a lot of the other solutions have gone live like rocket pool and, you know, coinbase with their staking and stuff like that. There are some, some centralized exchanges in here but a lot of it is, is yet to come, I think so, yeah. Almost 3 million, which last time I checked, you know, if we, if we go off the price, I think it's about $4 billion worth of ETH or something like that, which is kind of crazy, right? $4 billion worth of ETH locked in this kind of deposit contract that's, that's in ETH two staking and validating the chain, which I thought was, was really cool. So the participation rate is something that I like to keep an eye on for ETH two. Now, for those of you who don't know what this means, I'll quickly explain. Basically in ETH two, there are validators that people run per 32 ETH stake that they have.
00:36:05.428 - 00:36:42.410, Speaker A: So if you have 64 ether stake, you will run two validators, essentially. Now, what the participation rate measure measures is what kind of percentage of these validators are actually online attesting to blocks and proposing blocks. Now, you can see here, right when that, when the chain kind of launched on December 1, you know, while it was coming online, we kind of like went from, I think, what, 86% up, up and up and up. And then by basically a week in, we had 98, 99% participation, which is absolutely amazing. And there is some variance here. You can see, like sometimes there's a bit of a drop off down, a bit of a drop off down. But I think the lowest point we've fallen for fallen to is about 95%.
00:36:42.410 - 00:37:14.986, Speaker A: So we've basically maintained 95% or greater network wide participation since launch. And that's basically perfect. I mean, you're never going to get 100% for one reason or another, right. But you're going to get like a high 98, 99% as long as the network is running fine. And that's what the kind of researchers and developers wanted to see, and that is absolutely fine. If participation rate drops too low, I think if it drops below 66%, the network can kind of halt. So, yeah, we want to see this as high as it can be, and it's really cool to see that.
00:37:14.986 - 00:37:18.930, Speaker A: You know, basically since it launched, it hasn't dipped below 95%.
00:37:19.002 - 00:37:19.234, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:19.274 - 00:37:45.824, Speaker A: It's been quite steady. We have some dips here and there, and I would actually like to investigate why we have these sudden dips for one reason or another. Maybe we have these dips when there are client upgrades released. You know, prism releases a client upgrade every kind of few weeks, I think. And maybe when everyone is like upgrading at once and they have to restart their nodes or restart their validators, we kind of see these drop here, but I have to check in with that. I don't know. I'm just speculating for now, but still a very, very cool kind of stat to see here.
00:37:45.824 - 00:38:12.004, Speaker A: And you can see the balance distribution here as well. So on the. On the left hand side here, you can see the number of validators that have kind of, I guess, 32 ETH in them and then more than 32 ETH because, you know, obviously, as people are staking, right. Their balance increases because they're getting rewarded for staking. So you can actually see how many validators have been rewarded by. By kind of, like, how much. And this is very lucky validator here.
00:38:12.004 - 00:38:16.732, Speaker A: That is basically way ahead of the pack, and it's gotten a lot more in rewards than the other ones.
00:38:16.828 - 00:38:17.348, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:17.476 - 00:38:38.002, Speaker A: And then over here, you can see that some of the validators actually have more than 32 ethan them. I don't. I'm not sure why this is. It might be just. It might just be someone has kind of, like, maybe messed this up or a few people have messed this up, but, yeah, interesting to see that there. But basically, this is what you really should pay attention to. And it's nice to say that most validators are around kind of the same thing here.
00:38:38.002 - 00:38:45.718, Speaker A: There's, like, a nice distribution. But, yeah, this. This single validator that has gotten much more rewards than everyone else is, uh, he's pretty lucky.
00:38:45.766 - 00:38:46.142, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:46.238 - 00:39:02.766, Speaker A: So this is another really cool chart to keep an eye on. This one as well. ETH one deposit addresses. So this shows kind of, like, where the ETH came from. So you can see one address here where 13.65% of the ETH currently validating came from. These aren't labeled, but I'm pretty sure this is kraken.
00:39:02.766 - 00:39:16.648, Speaker A: And then there's a bunch of other kind of whales here. I think binance is in there. Lido staking is in there. Celsius is in there. I don't know what. Which ones they are here, but I'm pretty sure they're in there. And then the rest of them are just, like, probably individual whales or other companies that we.
00:39:16.648 - 00:39:42.388, Speaker A: That I. That I don't know of. Like, I think there's bitcoin Suisse as well, and then the majority of it is actually quote unquote others. So this is actually really great for decentralization, where basically the others category owns way more than 51% of the. The kind of network here or validates way more than 51% of the network. And, you know, even if all these kind of entities banded together, I think just eyeballing it here. I don't think they have enough to do any kind of attack.
00:39:42.388 - 00:40:00.484, Speaker A: Maybe they have enough to do kind of censorship attacks because I think you only need 33% for that. But they would have to definitely all band together and then I think if someone finds out that they're doing this, they're going to get slashed as well. So. And you know, I don't imagine Kraken with 13% of the, the kind of ETH in here, I don't imagine they want to get slashed.
00:40:00.524 - 00:40:01.186, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:01.380 - 00:40:33.464, Speaker A: So definitely not too big of a worry here with that, but good to see this distribution nonetheless. So last thing here from the ETH two side is a graffiti word cloud. Now for those who don't know each validator that you have, you can actually assign a bit of graffiti to it. And every time you propose a block, that graffiti kind of gets, puts up on this board, gets put up into like the, the ETH two kind of network. And then the beacon chain website here basically shows it in this word cloud. So this is the word cloud of the 25 most occurring graffiti's now welcome to the new beginning. Is the biggest here.
00:40:33.464 - 00:40:59.954, Speaker A: That's actually part of a staking pool. And as I mentioned before, bitcoin Suisse is kind of staking here. This is actually a cool way to see all the, all the people that are like the majority stake on the network because they're the ones going to be proposing the blocks the most of the time. So cream here, staker, you have like a bunch of other ones like lighthouse. This is the default kind of, I mean you can see the clients here, right. This is the default graffiti on a lot of them but yeah, really cool to see. I think there's like a pool here as well.
00:40:59.954 - 00:41:07.754, Speaker A: I validating from DaP node. Okay well that's a default from Dap node as well. So yeah, this is, this is really cool to see. And then a pop as well here.
00:41:07.834 - 00:41:08.242, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:08.338 - 00:41:35.746, Speaker A: So yeah, this is just really, really cool. I thought that it was a really good way to visualize like what kind of participants are on the network. And yeah, as I said, anyone can put their graffiti here but if you wanted to put up, if you want it to be shown in the word cloud, you, you would need it to be the 25 most reoccurring graffiti's. And to do that you need to be one of the biggest stakers. So yeah, to get in here you'd have to be basically a whale or like a staking pool or something like that. But still you can actually, look at your graffiti on here. You just have to kind of sift through.
00:41:35.746 - 00:42:00.594, Speaker A: It won't show up in the word cloud, it'll show up in the other kind of metrics that this website tracks. So, yeah, definitely go give. Give that a look if you're interested in that. And as always, all the, all the links from today's video will be in the description. So you can go check out all this stuff for yourself and, you know, play around with the different metrics and things like that, which I think would be a really cool, cool thing to do. All right, onto data from the block. So this is the grayscale data.
00:42:00.594 - 00:42:28.130, Speaker A: So for those who don't know, Grayscale is a company that offers kind of tax advantage products. And they have a BTC product called GBTC, they have an ETH product called ETH E. And people buy into this because they want kind of like tax free trading of Ethan BTC and their retirement accounts or whatever. And this is a product that's available to them because there's no ETF for ETH or BTC yet. And you can see here that the ETH holdings in Grayscale's Ethereum trust has absolutely exploded.
00:42:28.202 - 00:42:28.602, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:28.698 - 00:42:52.104, Speaker A: I mean, kind of like throughout 2020, it went from, what was it, essentially 500,000 ETH to now almost 3 million. So that's a seven times increase. And you can see it kind of, like, flattened out here. And that's because they had to close the fund for a little bit. And they reopened it recently. And if I go to, like, the one month here, I can actually see when they reopened it. And they've since reopening it just a few days ago, they've added another 400,000 ETH.
00:42:52.104 - 00:43:10.530, Speaker A: Sorry, 40. 40,000 ETH. My bad. Not 400,000, which is pretty cool as well. But since I did last video on December 15, they seem to have added, what was it, about 500,000? But, yeah, as I said, I think they paused. Yeah, I think they actually paused it after I did that video. It looks like.
00:43:10.530 - 00:43:35.590, Speaker A: But there was also, and I explained this in another video, the kind of premium coming into fruition where the way these products work is that the ETH locked in here is a six month kind of. Sorry. The ETH in here has a six month lock where the price of it can get way ahead of the actual ETH price. So I think it got like ten times ahead of the actual ETH price, and then arbitrages will actually close that loop there. So, yeah, that was really, really good.
00:43:35.742 - 00:43:35.982, Speaker B: Cool.
00:43:35.998 - 00:43:45.098, Speaker A: To see that more kind of ETH is being sucked up here. There's more institutional demand, more demand from people who want kind of, I guess, exposure to. To ETH.
00:43:45.146 - 00:43:45.810, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:46.002 - 00:43:50.642, Speaker A: And this is currently worth 4.71. No, over $5 billion.
00:43:50.698 - 00:43:50.962, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:51.018 - 00:44:01.498, Speaker A: Of Ethan here. And this is actually a chunky amount of the supply. I mean, 3,000,008th if he's like 2.5% of the supply or something like that. Or. And that's as much ETH as in ETH two.
00:44:01.586 - 00:44:01.930, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:02.002 - 00:44:19.710, Speaker A: So we have these ethos just being locked up in so many different places. I mean, it's quite bullish. And you can see, I mean, these metrics all popped off. Popped off after defi summer, basically, for ETH here. So. Yeah, and as I was talking about, the premium got really ahead of itself and then closed. I mean, the premium was even more of ahead of itself in 2018 here.
00:44:19.710 - 00:44:37.658, Speaker A: But recently, it kind of got ahead of itself a bit, too. And then it kind of collapsed. And the premium is not very high. But as you can see, the premium goes up and down, up and down. And I expect it to keep going up, especially during a bull market where there's lots of demand for these products, essentially. So another chart here that I went through before. On glass.
00:44:37.658 - 00:44:55.794, Speaker A: No, but this is another way to view it here, because on glass note, I said that I couldn't see the dollar amounts of how much ETH addresses with the balance of over x amount in dollars. So you can actually see here that the balance of over 1000 kind of dollars worth of ETH is skyrocketing.
00:44:55.874 - 00:44:56.234, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:56.314 - 00:45:06.654, Speaker A: There's 1.62 million addresses with over $1,000 of ETH in them. And that's because the price has been going up, too. So you can see, like, it's. It skyrocketed after the price basically doubled.
00:45:06.694 - 00:45:06.870, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:06.902 - 00:45:16.886, Speaker A: In a few days. And then the. And then wallets with over a 10,000 worth of ETH in them as well, right here. Over a million, kind of. I guess you can see it if I do.
00:45:16.910 - 00:45:17.022, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:17.038 - 00:45:21.886, Speaker A: If I click through, you can actually see the growth over a million dollars has actually skyrocketed as well.
00:45:21.950 - 00:45:22.534, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:22.694 - 00:45:53.132, Speaker A: And then over $10 million has started to kind of. I guess if I do this skyrocketed as well. But, yeah, it's because it's collapsed. But, yeah, as you keep going down, there's not that many addresses with $10 million of Ethan. That's 1.721, 720 kind of addresses with more than 10 million Ethernet. So, yeah, but, yeah, I particularly like this metric where there's you can see like you know, a $1000 more than a $1,000 in it is really great because it means kind of like more and more people are kind of you know, have ETH or have more value in Ethan we have.
00:45:53.132 - 00:46:05.066, Speaker A: That means we have more economic bandwidth for the Ethereum network. So I think that's really cool. And also the more than $$10,000 worth of ETH as well because that's not actually that much as you know, that's less than ten er, these days.
00:46:05.130 - 00:46:05.786, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:05.970 - 00:46:29.586, Speaker A: So I think a lot of people who bought ETH during obviously the bear market have held on to it and now it's you know, they're going into kind of like these, these addresses here. So another really cool metric from the block here, percentage of the Ethereum supply that is active. This, this one's really, really awesome as well. So you can actually see that basically 96% of the supply has been active within the last five years.
00:46:29.650 - 00:46:30.282, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:30.458 - 00:47:04.910, Speaker A: But then as you keep going you can see that less and less are active as you keep going on. So only 87% has been active in the last three years. In the last year, 66% has been active in the last 90 days, 50%. And then the last seven days kind of 28% of the supply has been active. Now I think it's funny, like if I, I can't really zoom in too much here. I don't think if I go to the three months, you know, you might be able to see a noticeable kind of I guess like spike in the active supply around ETH two. Because there are a lot of ETH two holders that were waiting.
00:47:04.910 - 00:47:07.566, Speaker A: You can actually see a noticeable spike here.
00:47:07.630 - 00:47:08.046, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:08.150 - 00:47:17.438, Speaker A: Percentage of supply that was active in the last kind of 90 days in the last one year. And then I guess in the last three years, not really.
00:47:17.526 - 00:47:17.990, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:18.102 - 00:47:46.830, Speaker A: So yeah, I guess in the last one year people were holding it and waiting for staking. You can see kind of a, I guess on the 24 November it going up a little bit here or towards that date it going up there. So that might be one explanation. But yeah, I think looking at kind of like I mean there's a, there's a chart on glass node that shows this as well. Actually if I bring that chart up I can show you it's huddle waves. It actually does a really good job of kind of showing it as well where it shows like the percent of the active supply if wants to load here. Yeah.
00:47:46.830 - 00:48:25.468, Speaker A: So you can. Sorry. Percent of the supply that hasn't been active. So you can see here that, you know, I guess for, for the last five to seven years, 4.5% of the supply hasn't been active in the kind of this, like, you know, for that long, which means that supply hasn't been active since Ethereum's genesis because the theorems only, I think, five or six years old at this point, which is, which is really cool here. And then you can go down a list here, you can see on the right, right hand side and see, you know, how much of the ETH has been active when and things like that. So it's actually really fascinating to see that, you know, a large chunk of the supply hasn't been active for longer than a year.
00:48:25.556 - 00:48:25.972, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:26.068 - 00:48:33.636, Speaker A: You can see 1516 is 31%, 49% plus five, over 50% of the supply hasn't been active for more than a year.
00:48:33.740 - 00:48:34.100, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:34.172 - 00:49:08.966, Speaker A: So it's either sitting in cold storage or maybe it's sitting in kind of a maker vault or something, right, sitting on another defi app or it's like sitting in ETH two at this point. So, yeah, really, really cool to see these stats here and cool to see the block have a dashboard for it as well. So the transactions on the Ethereum network have obviously been going wild lately, right, because a lot of people are doing a lot of different transactions. And it's funny because we were actually had an all time high back in. I think this is the end of, this was literally the exact end of the bull market. I think. 10 January 2018, we had 1.24
00:49:08.966 - 00:49:33.020, Speaker A: million active Ethereum addresses based on the seven day moving average. Now, we spiked up to more than that, I think. Wait, was this one point, what, 24 million? This is 1.24 million. So we basically broke the record again on the 13th of or 14 August, which I think was the peak of Defi summer. Then we came down and we've been slowly creeping back up and we're pretty much like above all time high now, I think. Yeah, we are.
00:49:33.020 - 00:49:58.996, Speaker A: So basically at all time high of kind of like active, daily. Active Ethereum addresses. Now this for me, sorry, daily daily transactions for Ethereum. This, for me is one of the most bullish metrics, because the more activity on the network, right. The more transactions going through means that people are doing more, especially at high gas prices, means people are doing more economic kind of activity that's worth more to them, which means that I think the market is more bullish.
00:49:59.060 - 00:49:59.428, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:59.516 - 00:50:25.470, Speaker A: You can see during 2018, basically there was a period where like, it just plateaued and then like towards the, the end. End here, like when, you know, when, I guess, like, we really hit the bear market when went to like $80 towards the end of 2018, and we had like a kind of, it fell off a cliff. Yeah. And then kind of went back up with the price. I mean, I wish there was a way to overlay the price here, but basically the price went up to like $380 here, then came down again. And then all through 2020, we saw the price go up.
00:50:25.502 - 00:50:25.886, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:25.990 - 00:50:29.454, Speaker A: Then the price came down again and the price has been going up. So it does follow price.
00:50:29.534 - 00:50:29.942, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:30.038 - 00:51:08.414, Speaker A: And I wouldn't say it's like causation, where the daily, the daily transactions kind of show tells you that the price is going to go up. I'd say that, like, they go up together. But if we keep seeing it kind of, like, trending up, I think that's a very positive sign for the network in general. So not nothing, you know, bearish there, basically. And this shows the monthly overlay of the transactions on the Ethereum network, not just a seven day moving average. So this gives you a bit of a, more of a macro picture of how it kind of works out. And again, like, if you, if you were to overlay price here, you would see price spikes up, you know, go down, had a little mini bull market in 2019, go down again, and then up throughout 2020 as well.
00:51:08.414 - 00:51:19.082, Speaker A: All right, last metric is the Ethereum hash rate here. So obviously, as the price of ETH goes up and as more fees are paid to miners, the profitability of mining goes up.
00:51:19.138 - 00:51:19.546, Speaker B: Right.
00:51:19.650 - 00:51:49.648, Speaker A: Now, you can see here that during the bear market, I guess, like, eats hash rate was kind of flat, trending up a little bit, but very flat. Whereas bitcoin's hash rate was actually going up. Right, because its price was going up more than ETH and things like that. But, you know, since we saw kind of, like, ETH come back since the mid 2020, we've just spiked up, like, crazily. I think this is, we're at all time highs right now. And it's not just because of the ETH price, it's because of the fees paid as well, which actually, if I get out of this. And I think the block has a kind of has a chart for this.
00:51:49.648 - 00:52:08.776, Speaker A: Yeah, they have a minor revenue chart. So if I. If I kind of bring this up here, if it wants to work. Oh, yeah, there we go. So you can see the miner revenue, the block subsidy in blue, which is aka the block rewards. So every ethereum block that's produced produces two ETH per block for miners. And then the transaction fees in this kind of, like, red color here.
00:52:08.776 - 00:52:15.336, Speaker A: Now, you can see that the transaction fees are actually taking up a large part of the kind of money that miners are making.
00:52:15.400 - 00:52:15.888, Speaker B: Right?
00:52:16.016 - 00:52:34.572, Speaker A: And we saw this kind of start playing out in defy summer, and it kind of, like, became, I guess, like a quarter of the revenue they were making. Now, it's, you know, I think this was maybe just eyeballing it here, maybe like 40% as of this month. And it's only been seven days so far. I think the transaction fees are more than 50% of the miner revenue so far.
00:52:34.668 - 00:52:35.164, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:35.284 - 00:53:07.592, Speaker A: And this is actually not a good thing. This is actually security concern because it leads to mine, it leads to instability with, with miners. So this is one big reason why we want ERP 1559 is in as well, because the fees paid to miners is actually meant to be a bonus. It's not meant to be the way Ethereum is secured. Ethereum is secured by block rewards in, aka, the subsidy in ETH two. It will be secured by block rewards and the subsidy because ETH two has perpetual issuance, but very low perpetual issuance. And the transaction fees are just gravy on top of that.
00:53:07.592 - 00:53:17.540, Speaker A: So we need ERP 1559 implemented to burn most of these transaction fees, or at least a portion of them. And the miners will still get paid fees, but it won't be like the whole fee.
00:53:17.612 - 00:53:17.988, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:18.076 - 00:53:28.180, Speaker A: And that kind of leads to better incentives for the network and doesn't, and kind of like, fixes that instability, or at least makes it a lot better. But it's still very interesting to see, you know, why the ethereum hash rate is going up.
00:53:28.212 - 00:53:28.860, Speaker B: Right?
00:53:29.052 - 00:53:50.162, Speaker A: Why? You may have seen miners kind of, like, fighting against EIP 1559 on, on Twitter, but at the same time, these miners are making it absolute killing, right? In, in this month here, they basically, the kind of, like, subsidy and the transaction fees total to $830 million in January. Right, of minor revenue. That's absolute, absolute killing.
00:53:50.218 - 00:53:50.626, Speaker B: Right?
00:53:50.730 - 00:54:01.786, Speaker A: And you know, this ETH as well, if they're stockpiling it, they'll be able to be big stakers within ETH, too. So, I mean, they're making as much money as they were as ever right now, especially from the fees.
00:54:01.930 - 00:54:02.690, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:02.882 - 00:54:26.270, Speaker A: You know, actually, the subsidy in January of 2018 was more than it is today. It was three ETH per block back then, I'm pretty sure, whereas it's only two ETH per block today. And they're still making a lot. Right, from the subsidy and the fees basically. So, yeah, if you account for all of that, miners are making a lot of money here. I'm not going to go on a rant about miners, of course, but, yeah, it's interesting to see why they would be fighting what is essentially a pay cut.
00:54:26.342 - 00:54:26.694, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:26.774 - 00:54:55.240, Speaker A: But at the same time, the pay cut wouldn't be all of the fees. It would maybe be like, I think at best, a third of the fees maybe. I haven't, I've seen numbers as low as 20% thrown around as well. So like a fifth of the fees would only be burned and the rest of them would still be paid to miners. So, yeah, that kind of explains why you've been seeing that kind of play out within, I guess, the ecosystem and within like the Twitterati or the Twitter sphere as well. That's it for today, everyone. Thank you for watching the latest daily grade data pump.
00:54:55.240 - 00:55:12.852, Speaker A: I hope you got a lot of value out of that. As I said, I will link all these in the YouTube description. You can go check out these charts and metrics for yourself. You can play around with them, you can do comparisons between them. I love on chain data. I look at a lot of it. I mean, there's so much more I could have gone through, but I didn't want to, you know, make this video go for like 5 hours, basically.
00:55:12.852 - 00:55:48.106, Speaker A: But there is data for everything these days. And if you dig right, and if you look, if you basically pay attention to the data, you can make some informed kind of decisions around investments. You know, not just the data got to do with Ethereum network, but the data got to do with DeFi as well. So there's a lot of different DeFi metrics you can look at. And, you know, I'll go through that in the next daily grade data pump. Actually, I'll focus more on kind of the DeFi metrics, but there's, you know, for the specific apps, there's a lot of things you can look at, and it's a way to inform your investment decision. And as an example here, if you had looked at sushi swaps, kind of, um, you know, metrics back when I think the price was like 60, $0.60
00:55:48.106 - 00:56:11.090, Speaker A: or something like that, you would have been able to spot that their metrics were still, you know, we're flat but growing a little bit, right. You know, everyone thought they were dead, but they weren't. They still had $200 million locked in there. They were still doing decent volume. They had plans, you know, to, to kind of like introduce new liquidity mining and stuff like that which they did. And now sushi swap is rivaling kind of uniswap with volumes. You know, it's grown a lot, right? And total value locked.
00:56:11.090 - 00:56:17.266, Speaker A: So, yeah, these kind of insights can be drawn directly from on chain data. And not a lot of people are looking at it.
00:56:17.290 - 00:56:17.738, Speaker B: Right.
00:56:17.866 - 00:56:37.208, Speaker A: More people are looking at it now than were maybe a year ago. But it's still like a superpower. It's still a very nice way to kind of like, get ahead of the pack. So I definitely recommend going and checking out all these sites.
