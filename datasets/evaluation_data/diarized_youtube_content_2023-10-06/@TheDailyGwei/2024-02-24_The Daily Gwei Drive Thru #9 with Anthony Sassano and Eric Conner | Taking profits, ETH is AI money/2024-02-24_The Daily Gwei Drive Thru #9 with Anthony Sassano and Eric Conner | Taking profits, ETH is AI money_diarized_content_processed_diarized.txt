00:00:00.520 - 00:00:08.914, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the datagrade drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Dasano, and I'm here today with Eric Conner to talk about all things Ethereum. Hey, Eric, how you going?
00:00:09.414 - 00:00:21.234, Speaker B: Hey. Doing good. I mean, good to be back. I think it was only a two week hiatus, so we haven't rugged too hard, but I mean, obviously markets are heating up. It's a good time to be in east, so I'm excited to talk.
00:00:21.574 - 00:00:38.674, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's actually only been a week. I think our last episode came out last week, but we did it on like the Tuesday and then it came out on the Saturday. So people are spoiled for content right now, that's for sure. But, yeah, I mean, eat that three k, right? Like, when's the last time was that three k? Like almost two years ago now, I think when we were crashing because of the terror kind of implosion.
00:00:39.174 - 00:01:03.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I think everything was kind of starting to blow up. I actually, oddly did the math of how many times I didn't even tweet this. I just did it myself. This is how lame I get at times, just for my own interest. But Ethan has only closed 30 weekly candles above or 30 daily candles? 30 weekly candles above 3000. And wait, let me. Now I'm doubting myself.
00:01:03.254 - 00:01:42.294, Speaker B: I think it's 30 weekly candles above 3000, but only four above 4000. So we're, like, in uncharted territory is my general point here. So, like, as I was saying on Twitter the other day, kind of breaking through 3000 to me is almost like price discovery for ETH, right? Like, we're in this totally uncharted. Like, most of my ETH livelihood has been between, you know, zero and 2000, I feel like. And then 2500 became a meme in that whole, like, 1500 to 2500 area. So we're embarking on a little bit of uncharted territory, which always feels nice as that ETH holder.
00:01:42.874 - 00:01:56.706, Speaker A: Yeah. And it kind of feels like 3000 is the new 300. Right. I remember back in the last cycle, actually, the cycle before, like, in 2020, once ETH broke 300, I think we were all like, oh, my God. Yeah, it's on. Finally. The bull market's on.
00:01:56.706 - 00:02:20.138, Speaker A: Like, it's probably. It's coming. It's back. And it was much more brutal last time, I think, for ETH holders because we obviously had to put up, like, deal with a 94% draw down in 2018 and then 2019 ETH BTC kept going down, like, a lot and then ended up down, like over 90% as well. But, yeah, in 2020, once ETH broke 300. I remember distinctly, people got very excited. And I think the same is true with, with 3000 right now.
00:02:20.138 - 00:02:54.082, Speaker A: And it's still like hovering around 3000. It's just like those nice round numbers that traders like to take advantage of where they're like, oh, I'm going to sell this because everyone's going to sell here. And it's, I mean, it's kind of a short term thing, I think. But I think the more interesting story is maybe ETH BTC as well. Because you mentioned last time, I think last week, that we thought that ETH BTC had really bottomed because of all the nice tailwinds that are coming towards each way, not just the ETF, but a bunch of other things like restaking and so on and so forth. And it has so far. I mean, again, I don't want to curse us here, but eight BTC has gone up since then and it seems to have refused to go below that 0.05
00:02:54.082 - 00:03:14.570, Speaker A: mark, which is really promising. Right. And really good to see that ETH is starting to outperform. And I think that, you know, the law, for about three months of last year, I think the last three months of 2023, everyone was kind of like, oh, well, you know, the bull market's going to skip ETH. You know, ETH has lagged so much. This is shit coin. And then, as per usual, like me and you and a few others were just like, well, we've heard this before.
00:03:14.570 - 00:03:46.994, Speaker A: We know what's going to happen when it starts moving. And of course, a lot of the things that had outperformed against Ethan are getting crushed against it, right? Because everyone's like, oh, my God, I don't have ETH. I need to get into ETH. Right? So these things just kind of tend to work in cycles. Um, but I think that's actually a perfect kind of segue into the first topic of today's episode, which is all about, I guess, a general kind of not not trend, I should say, like a general kind of thing, of like how to take profits in crypto. Because last week we obviously spoke a lot about the bull case for ETH. What we think ETH is going to this cycle and beyond, you know, in the decades to come.
00:03:46.994 - 00:04:41.970, Speaker A: But that doesn't mean that you should just like hold ETH and not sell ever sort of thing, or hold other assets and not sell ever. Like, taking profits, I think, is the absolute hardest thing for any crypto native to do, uh, with investing. Like, it's, it's, it's relatively easy to buy, I think, um, you know, especially during like the quieter periods. But taking profits is extremely hard because there are so many kind of different, uh, uh, things happening when you're wanting to take profits because that's obviously going to be a bull market when you ideally take profits and there's so many different kinds of narratives being shield. There's so much, you get caught up in them. You get caught up in making all this money really quickly and thinking, oh, it's going to be up only, right, super cycle, all those sorts of things. But I wanted to start with you, Eric, because you honestly like the person, like at least from my point of view, the person I know best who has managed to play these market cycles really well, managed to take profits and then buy back in and increase your kind of overall stack without just being like just holding.
00:04:41.970 - 00:05:00.694, Speaker A: Right. The holding's fine. And we're not talking about buying and selling on the day to day basis or anything like that. Were talking about basically going through a whole macro crypto cycle of like what, the four year cycle, right. Like buying when its quiet, selling when its hot and kind of having strategies around that. So yeah, Eric, id love to get your take on all of that and kind of what your strategy has typically been.
00:05:01.234 - 00:05:37.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think first, like it takes experience, right. Like early on and Ive talked about this a lot between us and on the podcast and stuff, like early bitcoin days I thought I knew I was doing and like leverage trading and thinking it was up only and lost a lot of bitcoin. Right. And ive got now gone through four crypto cycles pretty much this is embarking on the fourth. And I think what I've realized most is most importantly, you can always rebuy the next bottom. Right? That's what mentally I've come to realize. And I think my top prediction of the last market of 2500, we went on bank lists.
00:05:37.754 - 00:05:59.672, Speaker B: You and I talked about this a lot. It became a meme on Twitter. People kind of bust my balls for that. But at the same time, like it wasn't that far off. Right. And like that's what I think of when I'm like trying to like buy and sell bottoms and tops. Like if you can be like somewhat in that ballpark, um, you're going to do pretty well.
00:05:59.672 - 00:06:34.748, Speaker B: So I think that's kind of my first advice. Like if you're in that range, you will probably do well. Like don't obsess with actually calling a top and selling and actually calling a bottom and buying. And of course like this also goes to like your personal situation, right? Like me personally, I've been in crypto now over a decade, right? And I'm probably earlier than most people listening to this podcast and that's not like, that's truly not a flash. Like I'm just trying to explain like my part of the cycle. Like if you've been in it over ten years and you haven't sold anything, it's probably time to sell like a little bit. I would, I would think.
00:06:34.748 - 00:07:20.612, Speaker B: And if you're just getting into it maybe you can like write it out a little bit more. But like it's more about like just understanding the mania of cycles. And I think we're like early bowl like quarter of this cycle. Like things are starting to heat up. But like pick a number to you as an investor and as like someone that's in crypto that sounds nice to you as someone that you would want to sell at and like start setting your sell prices there. So like Anthony, you know this because we talk a lot but offline. But like I always pick a bull market target for myself and last cycle that was 2500, um, funny enough in the first east cycle.
00:07:20.612 - 00:07:45.588, Speaker B: So for those that don't know, I was in like the presale. So my first ETH was under a dollar and I was buying everywhere from $0.30 all the way up to $10. Like I was just buying relentless dips. And then I said to myself if this thing goes to 1400, I'm going to sell some. What's really funny is 1400 was the top. Now ironically my, my sell orders, I said every $10 from 1400 up to like 2000.
00:07:45.588 - 00:08:28.452, Speaker B: At that point only two of those hit, right because we only went to 1420 and I kind of like reassessed on the way down and I wanted to get some out. So I kind of like I said okay, I missed that. And I sold some at 1000 and went all the way down and I bought a bunch at 80 and at that cycle I said okay, well my top is 2500 now. I sold a pretty decent chunk at between 2000 503,000, which wasn't the top, which that's fine. I never go a day where I'm like oh God, I missed 4900, right? And then I had some drop powder to buy on the dip here in the last like two years. And now my target for ETH is like 20,000. I'll probably honestly start stacking cells like 15 to 25.
00:08:28.452 - 00:09:15.178, Speaker B: But again, this isn't like my whole stack, right? Like I think one of the things people don't understand in crypto a lot is like, if someone says they're selling, it doesn't have to be like, all their ETH, right? I haven't sold all my Ethan, I've been in this over a decade. You can, like, sell a little bit and be happy, buy something for your family, buy a house, whatever, right. As things go up and then set some cash aside and when things go down, rebuy, right? Like, we know these cycles happen and it's very important to be a part of that cycle. Like you're going to be. Most people, like, imagine just me from, like, buying at 80, selling at 2500. People, like, busted my balls for not selling at 4000. But at the same time, I mean, I made great money and then I was able to rebuy at the bottom.
00:09:15.178 - 00:09:42.744, Speaker B: And now, sure, I'm maybe my target sounds crazy at 15,000 to 20,000, but I don't know if it doesn't hit it, I'm still doing fine, right. So it's just more about, like, being in that range and having that mindset of, I don't have to be, like, all in on crypto, right? Like, I, it doesn't have to consume me forever. And, like, this is a great asset. It's doing well, and it's good to just, like, kind of think about these things so that that's personally how I've always approached it.
00:09:43.224 - 00:10:10.080, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that we have definitely similar approaches here. And maybe my approach has been influenced, actually, I would say definitely has been influenced with talking to you over the years. I remember a lot of our conversations early on when I only got into Ethereum in 2017 and I had a pretty small bankroll for the next three years after that. Whereas with you, obviously, you got in a lot earlier, so you were on a different kind of, I guess, position to where I was. But what helped me was I wasn't comparing myself to you or anyone else.
00:10:10.080 - 00:10:48.602, Speaker A: I was like, I'm running my own race. I've got my own money invested, and I'm doing whatever I can to increase the amount of money I have to both invest and the amount of money I have I can make from, from this thing. And I have gone on record multiple times saying I haven't sold any of my ETH, but I sold other things for ETH. You know, I've increased my eat stack by taking profits from other things. And that's another thing that I think a lot of people, you were talking about people thinking, you know, in a binary sense, about this, where it's like, you don't have to be all in, you don't have to be all out, and you don't have to just trade it for cash. You can actually just, like, use these other assets and trade them into ETH. When you think that these other assets have become overheated against ETH and knowing when it becomes overheated is quite difficult, theres a lot that goes into that.
00:10:48.602 - 00:11:41.202, Speaker A: Thats generally how I think about that. But the two things I think of, when I think of, okay, when am I going to sell these things and when am I going to take profits here? The number one thing is, what am I actually selling it for? Am I selling it for cash? Okay, what am I buying with this cash? Do I want to go buy myself a new house? Do I want to buy a new car? Do I want to help my family? Those sorts of things. What are you actually using that cash for? Because thats number one. And number number two. One is if I'm selling and I'm going to cash, like, am I going to buy back in with this? Like, do I have a plan to buy back into ETH or some other asset, am I going to reinvest this? And those two things have helped me a lot because in 2021 was the first time I actually took substantial profits out of crypto. Uh, that, that was my first cycle where I was actually able to take substantial profits out. And I took out enough, basically to, uh, buy, you know, get my house and, and get myself a, you know, a few nice things here and there, buy some more figurines, as we all know I like to do, right.
00:11:41.202 - 00:12:08.022, Speaker A: Those sorts of things. Um, you know, help, uh, help friends and family out and stuff like that, where I could. Uh, but then I was like, you know what? Like, I've, I've done that, but now I've got all this cash that I'm sitting on, what am I going to do? Well, I'm like, okay, I'm going to reinvest it. Like, obviously, I'm going to re, I'm not going to just hold it in cash, especially at the time when the rates were, like pretty much 0% for a lot of that time, you weren't even getting much on your cash, right. So I did that, and I reinvested it in, uh, I mean, angel investments. I do a bunch of that. But also I bought a lot of ETH, uh, you know, around the bottom.
00:12:08.022 - 00:12:32.014, Speaker A: Like, I think I got a bit at the exact bottom, but that, it happened so quickly. I bought a lot around 1000. Um, because I was like, you know what, this is ridiculous. You know, I feel like this is a good, good place to buy based on a bunch of different reasons. But that's kind of like how I, how I view it here now. I think for a lot of people the main mistake that they make is not thinking about that at all. What they do is they basically say, okay, I want to make a million dollars, right, or some, some kind of number.
00:12:32.014 - 00:13:09.670, Speaker A: Like I want to make a million dollars and then let's say their portfolio goes up to 500,000 and that's it. That's all it goes to. Well, if you've got in your head that you want to make a million dollars, then you're most likely not going to sell if you've only made 500,000 because you've got this imaginary number that you've just come up with that you want to sell out. This happen to so many people, they set this, this number and then they don't sell and they write it back down and have to wait a whole nother cycle just for the chance of getting to that point again. So the best thing to do is never do that. Never set like I want a million dollars here. What you should do is you could, you should basically look at, okay, well, as you were explaining, Eric, what are the actual prices of the assets that I'm going to sell at based on a bunch of things.
00:13:09.670 - 00:13:41.790, Speaker A: Like we explained last week how our 15 to 20k price target for ETH is based on a bunch of different reasons. And then as you go down the risk curve, it's actually a lot harder because you have to now like speculate on these very early stage projects that may die in this cycle and never come back. Like a lot of projects from last cycle are never coming back. Right. So you have to kind of look at the prices that you're going to be selling these things and when you're going to be taking profits. And the last thing is you mentioned that where it's extremely important not to try and time the bottom and time the top because you're never going to do that successfully. Right.
00:13:41.790 - 00:14:18.650, Speaker A: Like most people will never ever get the exact bottom, exact top. You want to do it within a range. And I've actually spoken about this on my refuel show where I said that you have much longer to sell in a bear, sorry, to buy in a bear crab market in the defined range than you do to sell because you mentioned before how you said that 2500 was your kind of top target and you had made fun of, but the thing is, is that we went from 2500 to 4400 and then within a span of a week it went down to 1700. Right. So you sold that like the, right, you sold like the middle ground there and you stuck to that target. And that's the most important thing too, is actually sticking to that target. Like you had a target that you set and you stuck to it.
00:14:18.650 - 00:15:10.286, Speaker A: So it doesn't matter that you didn't catch the exact top or whatever, whatever. Your chances of even catching that are really small because you would have had to catch it within a very short period of time. You said it at the start where you're like, ether's only been above 4k for like four weeks or something like that out of the whole kind of cycle there. So yeah, setting, I guess, like to recap on my side of things, you know, coming, knowing the reasons that you're selling is a big, big motivator too. It's like, are you selling to cash because you want to buy a reinvest later because you think the market's too hot? You're going to reinvest later. Selling to cash because you want to buy things, you know, house, car, whatever, selling into or taking profits into ETH because you think that it's this thing has just pumped too hard against ETH and you want to take profits into ETH, right? And then depends what you want to do with that ETH. Either you, you hold that as a long term stack or you take profits on that and then also not setting portfolio goals as your sell target, setting price goals of the assets as your sell target.
00:15:10.286 - 00:15:42.872, Speaker A: Because like, seriously, I think that's actually the worst thing you can do is set a portfolio goal. Because I've done this before and I was basing my portfolio goal on what I wanted, not what was actually achievable, not even the long term future and like the future of a cycle. You know, I think in 2013 when I first got into crypto, I did the same thing as you. Like, I traded away a lot of bitcoin on stupid stuff. Like I think I, back then I put like 1000 or $2,000 into the market. I was pretty much like broke after that. I didn't have much money at the time because I was young and I was working here and there, but I didn't really have much savings.
00:15:42.872 - 00:16:18.124, Speaker A: And I put it in and I'm like, damn it, if I want to make like 100 grand, my goal at the time was like 100 grand. If I want to make 100 grand out of $2,000 I'm not going to do it with bitcoin. Bitcoins already pumped a lot, its already worth a lot. Im not going to do with bitcoin. So of course I went down the risk curve and I traded litecoin and dogecoin and Clark coins. Its random coins, I traded all these things and of course I ended up with less than I had and then I kind of exited crypto in 2014. So I think thats a key point as well is that once youre setting portfolio goals like that, your kind of like objectivity goes out the window and now you start chasing that and it becomes very, very hard to sell in that environment.
00:16:18.724 - 00:17:02.698, Speaker B: Yeah I like that last point. Like setting portfolio goals in USD can be a little dangerous, right? Like it's, I think a lot of people probably listening to this should be setting portfolio goals ETH, which means maybe sell a little at the top and rebuy at the bottom, right. And get more ETH. Like if you, if you truly believe, this is one of the lessons I wish I knew a long time ago, if you truly believe in the future of crypto, try to accumulate more crypto. Right. And that's like one of the things that I don't like about people saying, oh, just hodl no, I think you can see these cycles of boom and bust, greed and fear. If you can read those a little bit, you can probably add to your crypto stack.
00:17:02.698 - 00:17:47.754, Speaker B: Now of course taxes get involved and that gets all weird, but if you can time a little bit of a top and a bottom and you can afford to sell a little of that, I mean a minimum, you can add to your e stack. And I think that's like, if I could go back to myself back in 2013 or whatever, I think that's the one lesson I would probably teach myself. I will finish this thought up on my end here. But crypto is not the first market that experiences all this stuff. If you go back, I would suggest people read the book devil take the hindmost. It talks about financial markets throughout time, starting at the tulip craze all the way through like.com, all the way till today.
00:17:47.754 - 00:18:34.464, Speaker B: And you'll realize that these markets are just human psychology more than anything. And of course, the asset itself has to be something that offers something to society, community at that time. But the basic point of the book is most of this is human emotion. I think crypto, of all markets in the history of mankind, has been able to bring out human emotion the most because we've been able to bring in the entire world to this. At the same time, it's 24/7 anybody in the world. And you see this emotion that charts played out more than you ever have in the past. And I think history books are obviously going to be rewritten when it comes to crypto and investing.
00:18:34.464 - 00:19:22.420, Speaker B: But at the same time, this stuff has happened in the past. And if you can kind of capture the essence of human emotion in the charts and kind of see that as much as I think east someday is going to, like, mil and a beyond, like, don't quote me on that. Like, tomorrow. Like, this is, I've said more than anybody, this is a multi decade play that's maybe 50 years down the road. That doesn't mean, like, you can't take profits and ride the wave down of human emotion and rebuy and add to your e stack, right? So I think if you're curious in that kind of stuff, like I said, that book I just mentioned, devil take the highmost, there's lots of books out there about just general market human emotion, but I think that it plays out in crypto almost more than any other market in human history. Mm hmm.
00:19:22.532 - 00:20:00.184, Speaker A: Definitely. Definitely. And I think the one note I want to make about all of the stuff that we're saying as well is that doing this strategy is really, really difficult, and most people actually fail even if they've got this strategy in mind. So I feel like some people, like, oh, well, if these more experienced people tell me what to do, then I'll be a better trader or be a better investor. It doesn't work like that, unfortunately, because I can tell anyone, or you can tell anyone, whatever our experiences we've had, whatever they should do and shouldn't do. But at the end of the day, I've given not investment advice, but, like, just general advice or just tell people what I do generally. And, like, most of those people do not listen to me, like, at all.
00:20:00.184 - 00:20:38.484, Speaker A: Like, they. They actually think they know better than me and they go and do their own thing. Now, I think that it just depends on the type of person you are. Like, if you've got a big ego, you're obviously not going to be listening to other people, right? If you, you know, think that I'm some kind of washed up boomer doesn't understand the current meta of crypto investing because I'm, you know, I'm just buying Ethan instead of meme coins, then of course you're going to be like, oh, this guy is not in it anymore. You know, he's, he's washed up, so that's fine. Like, I don't care if people think that about me, but the problem becomes is that if you're, like, a first cycler, an inexperienced investor, you're going to get burnt, like, 100% of the time. Like, I actually would love to know if there's any first cyclers kind of out there that hasn't been burnt in a way by just being inexperienced.
00:20:38.484 - 00:21:11.388, Speaker A: And I'm not talking about, like, first cycles just within crypto. I'm just, like, in general with investing, like, you, when you go first, go into investing as, like, you can read all the books you want and you can actually get all that really great knowledge, but it comes down to your actions at the end of the day. Like, no one can control what you do. And if you've got an ego, as typically, younger investors do have a very big ego because they think that they know better. And, I mean, I was one of them, definitely when I was, I was younger, especially in my early twenties, you know, I feel like I'm, you know, I've got. I've got all the time in the world because I wasn't, you know, tied down by anything, didn't have any responsibility. So I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to use all this money to invest.
00:21:11.388 - 00:21:34.668, Speaker A: I'm going to make, you know, all this money. I'm going to buy lambos and all that. Right? So a lot of people think like that, and that's the trap that they fall into. So it doesn't matter how much other kind of stuff that they can read that tells them not to do that. I think the best lesson is learned, but through experience and experiencing that yourself. And that's why I think the most successful investors I know within crypto, um, and there's not that many of them, honestly, but there is. There is a handful of them that have won really, really big over the last ten years.
00:21:34.668 - 00:21:54.656, Speaker A: They have, uh, one because of experience. They've stuck in the game. You know, they've stayed in the game. They've learned from their own mistakes. They haven't just learned from other people, and they haven't had an ego about it. I mean, we saw the people with egos blow up in 2022. Like, literally every single one of them blew up, right? The three arrows capital guys do, Kwon, SBF, Alex Machinsky from Celsius.
00:21:54.656 - 00:22:14.624, Speaker A: Like, they all blew up. And I think a large part was due to their ego. They just thought that the, you know, it was going to keep going. It was going to, it was going to keep going up only super cycle. I mean, even the ogs like Barry Silbert have completely ruined themselves too. Like he was in since what, 2013, 2012 or something. You think he should be a mega billionaire from being so early into crypto and being a part of things.
00:22:14.624 - 00:23:00.670, Speaker A: And he was at one point, maybe it still is technically on paper because of the businesses that he owns. But he's like, if, I don't know if people have seen like just how bad what he's done seems to be, like he's accused of all this fraud that's happened, you know, all this other stuff that's, that's been happening in the background there. So at the end of the day, yeah, I think you need to keep that in check. You need to keep your ego in check, you need to keep learning, you need to experience it for yourself in order to become a successful investor. And the last thing I'll say on that as well is it's kind of funny that, you know, we stayed pretty low for a little while there where ETH was I think between 1000 and 1500 for like six to eight months or something like that. And BTC was in its range as well, like around 25k or below 25k or something like that for a while. And people would still be like, well no, this wasn't the bottom.
00:23:00.670 - 00:23:21.776, Speaker A: The FTX class wasn't the bottom. There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out and then we're going to keep selling off the macros ruined, blah, blah, so on and so forth. But what people don't understand is the markets are forward looking, markets will price things in. I know it's a meme. People say it's not priced in. I'm like, guys, like a lot of the time it actually is priced in like that. That's the thing you mean about it, but it's not obvious that it's priced in until maybe a little bit of time has passed.
00:23:21.776 - 00:23:52.136, Speaker A: And then you're like, in hindsight you're like, oh my God. Okay, it was, it was priced in and I got wrecked because I thought it wasn't. Because if people were paying attention. Inflation in the US peaked June 2022. That was the ETH bottom. And then the BTC bottom was the FTX collapse, right? So yes, there were other things that collapsed and other people got washed out. And obviously like the, the macro environment narrative, the narrative was that it was going to all implode and there was wars and stuff as well, like the Ukraine war and there was the, the recent one with Israel and Gaza and stuff like that.
00:23:52.136 - 00:24:20.980, Speaker A: Right. But the point is, is that, like, you get sidelined by thinking like this, by falling into this trap of listening to all these people who are just like, yeah, it's going down, it's going. And then it just keeps going up. And then the reason it keeps going up is because all these sideline people are suddenly like, oh, my God, I need to buy in now. But then what happens is you're fomoing it. And that, that's even more dangerous, I think. So I think that's good for people to keep in mind because I've had this conversation with a lot of people in the daily Gwei discord channel where I said to them, like, guys, like, I'm not, not trying to give you investment advice here, but you're all falling for this, like, propaganda.
00:24:20.980 - 00:24:43.914, Speaker A: Like, like this, this, this duma bear propaganda. Like, there are people that have actually made the big short, the movie the big short, their entire personality, where they think that they've, there's some kind of like, murky underground of the markets that's going to bubble up and it's going to blow up and everything's going to go to shit. That did happen in crypto, but it happened in 2022. Like, the thing is, it had already happened. And people are like, oh, no, there's still more to come. You know, still more. It's like, guys, like, we already went through this.
00:24:43.914 - 00:24:57.334, Speaker A: Like, there's no need to keep speculating here. And the history book you spoke about, devil take the highmos, I haven't read it yet, but I think that that speaks to that point, right where this has happened in history. And if you learn from that, you can position yourself better going forward.
00:24:58.294 - 00:25:52.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the general human intuition these days with media and social media is to expect the worst soon, which I think is a great thing for crypto, honestly, because I think people just want to dump it. And if you can hang in there, it's going to look good in the long run. So, yeah, when it comes to investing, invest in ETH, if that's what you believe in and just have some conviction about it, just stick around. I've been in ETH for a long time now because I actually believe in it. I truly, truly think that it's going to become the programmable money in the future. I truly think eventually companies and banks and nation states are going to all transact on Ethereum. I actually think that all arts going to happen here.
00:25:52.520 - 00:26:21.540, Speaker B: I think all gaming is going to happen here through L2. Like, you know, I. This is my actual conviction and investment thesis. So I think, first and foremost, make sure you have that. Don't just be chasing something you don't truly believe in, right? Like, I think this is. You know, it's funny for me to even say world computer. Like I've been thinking recently, right? Like this world computer meme we used to all hate because bitcoin maxis will, like, hammer that in on us and say, you guys don't have a monetary policy.
00:26:21.540 - 00:26:48.968, Speaker B: It's not a money. It's a world computer. It's digital oil. But now that I think back to that, to me, that is the vision for Ethereum at this point with L2s. Now that we have a sound money policy, this idea of a world computer and programmable money, I think maybe one of the questions that we might talk about is ETH is AI money. But I think this all plays into you. You have to have this investment thesis.
00:26:48.968 - 00:27:42.372, Speaker B: You have to disgustingly believe in ETH to stick around and make money, right? Like, you and I have survived because we are obsessed with the idea of Ethereum, right? We haven't wavered. And I think that's what some people don't truly get. If you don't have this true conviction, this obsession in your investment, you're going to get shaken out early. If I didn't really, really believe in Ethereum, I would have got shaken out at $10, right? People always say, oh, I would just bought Ethan $1. That'd be great. I'm like, no, it had to be mentally retarded. So I think as much as we could talk about buying bottoms, selling tops, you also have to just truly believe this is the future.
00:27:42.372 - 00:27:53.064, Speaker B: And if you don't, that's fine. And if you're in it for that, okay, like, for the hot money. But that does have to kind of, like, back up your thesis at the end of the day.
00:27:53.804 - 00:28:28.586, Speaker A: And I think that's what's probably one of the hard bits about investing in crypto as well, is that there's not many assets that you can actually have that kind of conviction on, right? Like, I can only think of two, and it's BTC and ETH. Like, I I can't actually look at anything else right now and have that same conviction that I do on. On ETH. Like BTC, I don't really have that conviction on, but I understand why other people do, of course. But when it comes to ETH, I'm the same as you, right? Like, I. I'm still holding my ETH like I'm staking it all, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm not planning to sell it. So, like I, and I've made my whole kind of like, I guess, life about Ethereum because I just believe in it so much and I believe in everything that Ethereum is doing.
00:28:28.586 - 00:28:56.242, Speaker A: And that makes it easier to hold ETH, of course, for me. And it makes it easier to keep buying more. I think for me, holding it's fine, but like even buying even more that then, you know, of something that I don't even plan to sell. So for me, it's like a kind of thing of, well, I just want more ETH, right? I want more ETH because I love ETH. I have a lot of confidence in it and so on and so forth. But then I think people fall into this trap of misdirecting that energy to other assets where theyre like, okay, Im really bullish on ETH. I believe in Ethereum, but ive got to hedge my bets.
00:28:56.242 - 00:29:32.144, Speaker A: Ive got to buy these other things to hedge my bets. And theres nothing wrong with doing that, mind you. And the thing is, if you do it successfully, you would basically buy it at the start of the bull market, sell it towards the end, and then youd probably make money because just everything goes up in a bull market, Preston. But what a lot of people tend to do is that they mistake their, their confidence in the asset for the asset actually doing well, because Ether has gone down multiple times, like a huge chunk. It went down 94% in 2018. Even so, you could have believed in ETH and Ethereum all you wanted, but you still, if you bought it at, you know, even if you bought it at $1,000, you lost a lot of money, uh, doing that, right, or a lot on paper at least. If you, if you held it, you obviously are up now.
00:29:32.144 - 00:29:59.842, Speaker A: But, you know, on paper, you lost a kind of a lot of money there. So I think that conviction is, is, is like most of the equation here, but like misdirecting that towards an asset that doesn't deserve it and that ends up just being like a dud and never comes back and just permanently 95 plus percent down. And you just keep holding it right and you don't actually cut your losses. That can affect your other investment decisions because then you start revenge trading where you're like, oh, I lost money here. I need to make up for this. I'm down. I need to make up.
00:29:59.842 - 00:30:31.756, Speaker A: So you start getting even more emotional about your investments, and that usually leads to ruin and I've seen this ruin multiple people over the years. So I think that, uh, you, you know, you could have an investment thesis on something, but if you really have a thesis on something, it has to be long, long term within crypto because short term stuff. You can't have an investment thesis of twelve months like you. Your investment thesis of twelve months is not an investment thesis, the trade thesis. Like, I wouldn't consider that to be an investment. It's, it's a trade. Right, where it's basically, it would basically boil down to, well, I think the bull market's coming back.
00:30:31.756 - 00:30:47.284, Speaker A: Everything's going to pump. This narrative's hot right now. So I'm going to buy this asset and then I'm going to sell it at this point. And that's fine. You do that. You know, that's if you can do that success successfully, you can rotate the profits into ETH. And a lot of people I know do this, but then people would normally mistake this and say, oh, well, this is my new long term investment.
00:30:47.284 - 00:31:13.674, Speaker A: I have a lot of, a lot of conviction on this. You know, this is going to kill Ethereum. You know, this is going to be great for like a five plus year hold and, and 99% of the time it's not. Ethereum is, is a very unique asset with not just within crypto but just generally there are not many assets that return so much over so, such a long period of time per cycle. Right. Because you have like BTC that's obviously done it from day one. ETH has done it from day one.
00:31:13.674 - 00:31:48.592, Speaker A: And if, you know, if it goes to 20k, that's like more than 20 x from, from its, from its bottom. And I guess last cycle it did like a 50 x or 60 x, I think from its bottom of $80 there. And then the previous cycle from its bottom, I think it bottom to like what, $5 in 2016? I think after the Dow exploded, $6, it went to 1400. So like each cycle, yeah, there's diminishing returns, but it's still returning a massive amount. But then you go and look at all the other popular assets from back then, right? They probably went up once in 2017 and then that's it. They just went down and that was it. They're not in the picture anymore, right.
00:31:48.592 - 00:32:18.850, Speaker A: Or maybe at the tail end of the last bull market or the previous one, they basically went up a little bit and they didn't get to their new all time highs and they just sold off. But it depends what you're benchmarking against. Too like, are you looking at against USD? Are you looking at against ETH? Because against ETH. Honestly, guys, I don't suggest looking at many charts against ETH. It's disgusting. It's really bad. Like, you think it looks bad against USD and then you look at it against ETH and you're like, hmm, okay, I've seen some charts, like, down 99% against ETH.
00:32:18.850 - 00:32:45.366, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, that's, that's kind of like another, I guess, thing there as well. But I mean, unless you've got anything left to add there, Eric, hopefully that answers a lot of people's questions on that. I mean, we could talk about this for ages, but we have a bunch of other stuff we want to get through. I did want to move into that thing you mentioned about ETH being AI money. Now, it's funny because people think that this might be like a new narrative or something that's just being shield because it's trendy and you've made the argument on Twitter that it's not.
00:32:45.366 - 00:32:49.554, Speaker A: So I'd love for you to kind of outline why ETH is AI money and what that even means. Really?
00:32:50.254 - 00:33:24.020, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like people cringe maybe because the new buzzwords are AI, but in all reality, AI is the next tech boom. We're seeing that around chat, GPT, and I mean, Google and everyone. Twitter is releasing their own AI. And I mean, Apple's apparently releasing their new AI and the new iOS update AI is going to be the next tech boom. There's no doubt about it. I mean, Nvidia stocks going through the moon because of the chip maker for all this stuff, I think it's best just to not buy into that.
00:33:24.020 - 00:34:06.684, Speaker B: This is a buzzword narrative. I think we should just. The reality is AI is next. If we just center ourselves there and think about that main narrative, or best narrative to me has always been programmable money. If you think about AI's, they get asked to do tasks and blows whatever. If someone asks them to, like, send money or create some kind of concept on money, where is that going to be? Ethereum is front and center for that, right? Ethereum is literally a programmable money that an AI could interact with. Right? And I could literally be like, oh, yeah, I want to write this smart contract, or I want to interact with Aave.
00:34:06.684 - 00:34:49.852, Speaker B: Oh, you said you wanted to borrow $2,000 versus $500 or versus your 5000 in collateral. Let's go do that on Ethereum. Right? We are greatly positioned to do that. And I don't think the narrative of ETH is AI. Money is like capturing on buzzwords. I think it's a branch off of ETH is programmable money, right? And if you think about, like, AI's now are closed, which this brings in an interesting debate, right? So it's most every AI to this point has been closed source. My personal opinion is the end state of AI will have to be open source because we've seen a lot of weird things around, like rules and stuff.
00:34:49.852 - 00:35:55.822, Speaker B: I don't want to get in all that, but these companies can program their own intelligence rules into these systems. I think humanity is going to demand open source eventually. Now imagine we eventually get open source AI. Then that AI is going to want to use open source free software blockchains like Ethereum. And I'm not talking, like, putting AI on Ethereum. I'm literally just talking about AI interacting with the Ethereum blockchain in itself as money, right? Because if you said to an AI right now, like, write me an app on Paypal and like, send $50 to Anthony on PayPal, that would require PayPal to create a plugin to that AI specifically and us both to install that plugin on our app, and then that has to happen. If you said that to any AI today on Ethereum and said, hey, send $50 to zazzle ETH from Eric ETH right now, it would do it.
00:35:55.822 - 00:36:45.352, Speaker B: It doesn't require anything. So I think people get, like, so caught up in this buzzword, oh, why are you saying AI money? No, like, ETH is programmable money. It always has been. And this AI narrative, like, I'm not saying tomorrow Google is going to, or chat DPT or any of those are going to, like, enable this feature per se, but I think you can basically get there already. I don't think you can, like, sign transactions yet on them, but it's very close. I've used it to, like, if I have a very complex, like, I was just doing my taxes the other day, like, you know, my tax transactions, I use GPT to load either scan up and tell me what was happening in one of my transactions because I kind of like, forgot what was happening and it, it broke it all down. Like, it.
00:36:45.352 - 00:37:05.284, Speaker B: This is a public ledger that it can understand, right? And it has free use to interact and use it, too. And I think people just. Programmable money was like an early narrative, right? And if we're going to start talking, like, AI and robots using it, like, I mean, it's front and center, right? There's, there's no one that can beat it.
00:37:06.624 - 00:37:30.160, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the perfect kind of point on this and perfect example of this to kind of hit this whole thing home is that the Ethereum blockchain today is mostly used by machines, right? It's not used by humans. Like, who do people think are kind of paying the gas fees on layer one? It's not. It's not. And paying them, like, constantly. I mean, it's human sometimes. And most of the time, it's the mev bots, right? Like the, the ones keeping the market prices in check.
00:37:30.160 - 00:38:12.234, Speaker A: The ones kind of doing their, you know, sandwich attacks and stuff like the negative meV. But still, it's. It's bots, right? Yes, the bots have been programmed by humans, and yes, they aren't technically what you would consider to be AI, but there's no reason for them not to be. And I'm pretty sure that there's probably some mev bots that are either already incorporating AI into them or will eventually just be, like, full blown, completely autonomous. The humans won't have any interaction with them anymore. It'll just be like the kind of thing where the human says, hey, go find me the most profitable on chain mev strategies and send all the profits to my ens, basically. Right? Um, and then from there, essentially what you have is a bunch of AI's just competing with each other, which is kind of hilarious, because right now we have humans writing the bots, competing with each other.
00:38:12.234 - 00:38:43.134, Speaker A: But then when the bots can learn for themselves and kind of adapt, uh, it's going to be kind of wild to see how that looks like and what that looks like on chain. And because there's a lot of financial kind of motivations behind this, it starts to get really, really crazy. Um, I think that, yeah, people, anyone doubting that, uh, ETH is AI money, uh, even, and saying, that's just the kind of buzzword the AI might, you know, word might be a buzzword at this point, but the kind of, uh, the, the fact that. The fact is, as you said, it is programmable money. That's real. That's been real since day one. That is really the kind of thing that enables everything on top of Ethereum.
00:38:43.134 - 00:39:10.958, Speaker A: I've said this before, where ETH, Ethereum is such a powerful network because ETH is such a powerful money. Like, we have the money and now we can have anything. I mean, I put out a tweet the other day that the total value of, of ethics that staked is approaching $100 billion, and that's bigger than every other layer one chain, like every other smart contract. Layer one chain by double. I think the next closest one was maybe Solana, like 50 billion or something. And that's the entire market cap of Solana. But that's not their staked market, that's the entire market cap.
00:39:10.958 - 00:39:38.078, Speaker A: So just the, what, 27%, 28% of eat that he staked is worth $100 billion. So it's already bigger there. So ETH is just such a strong programmable money already. And then you throw AI into the mix and you throw all the demand that brings with it. Yeah, it's very bullish, I think, for ETH. And it makes total sense that ETH can be considered AI money because you can't program like bitcoin, for example, like BTC. They're doing some stuff there now, trying to make some stuff happen, but it's very different.
00:39:38.078 - 00:40:08.196, Speaker A: You can't program it the same way that you can eat and tokens on Ethereum as well to interact with that and smart contracts. So that, that all makes perfect sense since to me, and I think that people are going to just call it out as a buzzword, but doesn't change the fact that it's real. It's not just kind of marketing, marketing gimme. It's real. It's been real for a long time. People can go see these for themselves, or you can just go to the ultrasound money website, actually, and you can actually see who the top gas guzzlers are and the top burners. It's all the uni swaps and other kind of contracts like that.
00:40:08.196 - 00:40:44.780, Speaker A: And who do you think is interacting with those contracts? It's the MEV bots and their bots. And then the machines, they're not humans. Humans aren't manually sitting there doing kind of MEV transactions. That would be silly because humans are way slower than machines at that. And then I think that at this stage is probably MeV bots that have already incorporated AI into their models in order to get better and become more profitable. Uh, and that's just the, that's just scratching the service, like, as you said, like there's always other use cases where humans can use it and say, you know, do such and such for me on chain and monitor the position for me. And if I fall, you know, to this price and I'm going to get liquidated, uh, close out my position for me, take money, you know, from wherever you can get it sort of thing.
00:40:44.780 - 00:40:48.144, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's kind of crazy when you think about it like that, I think.
00:40:49.484 - 00:41:21.600, Speaker B: Yeah, I like your point about just thinking about bots are already the ones competing. Like even going to other all layer ones, most all transactions are like mev bots. It's funny to me, they don't realize that MeV is happening, but it is. If you have block space that's worth money, bots are filling those in. So I mean at the end of the day, it's just going to be creating more efficient markets. Arbitrage will get smaller and smaller, MEV will get smaller and smaller. That is just the end state.
00:41:21.600 - 00:41:47.734, Speaker B: And just be able to say to an AI, hey, write me this bot, or like write me, and like it'll be become a race for what AI can write, the better trading engine or MEV bot or R bot or whatever it is. But yeah, I mean it's just, I mean these are programmable systems, right? And like, so it makes sense that like the computers themselves, as crazy as it sounds, are going to be the ones that write the best code, right?
00:41:48.514 - 00:42:05.754, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I mean, I think you mentioned earlier as well about, about L2s and how that kind of fits into the whole picture. I mean, I think with, as I said before, because ETH is such a strong money, it exports all of this to L2. So the same thing is going to happen on the L2s. It already does with Mev. Right.
00:42:05.754 - 00:42:52.042, Speaker A: And the same thing is going to happen that ETH is going to be used as, by these AI's as money at the L2s. But I guess while we're on the topic of L2s as well, there is something I think that you wanted, that you mentioned, mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about earlier, about how Ethereum has kind of exploded over the last couple of years with L2s. Essentially. Theres been so many of them that have been created, theres so many more thats set to come. There are these kind of L2 frameworks now where you can basically deploy a L2 like you would deploy any other smart contract on ethereum. So people are kind of asking, whats this all going to look like? Right? Like theres fragmentation right now? Whats it all going to look like? How are we going to kind of defragment this and how can re kind of like reunify ethereum as an ecosystem? And my answer to that is that it's just going to be a network effect game. Most of these l two s are not going to get much of a network effect.
00:42:52.042 - 00:43:26.916, Speaker A: They're going to basically just be failed experiments, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. And the liquidity is basically going to concentrate as a power law effect. But at the same time, what I like about it is that it just gets us a lot of experimentation as well. It gets us a lot of rapid experimentation on Ethereum on both scalability and using different virtual machines that we otherwise don't have at layer one because layer one is so limited, given that it's very slow to change because you have to go through the entire layer one governance process. And that takes forever. I mean, it took two and a half years to get AIP 1559 into the network, which is the most popular EIP, I think, of all time.
00:43:26.916 - 00:43:40.944, Speaker A: So just to give people a kind of context around that. But yeah, Eric, I mean, I've given my thoughts on these heaps of times to my audience on the daily gray here. I'd love to get your thoughts on the whole L2 landscape as it exists today and what you kind of see the future being like.
00:43:42.024 - 00:44:17.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'll start on the tech side and I'll wrap up on the investment side. So on the tech side, Ethereum as a community kind of took this approach to agnostic to L2s. Right? Like we're going to kind of perfect layer one. And like with blobs coming soon, we're going to give the best possible, I mean, there's a few tweaks we would still make, but we're going to get the best possible option to any L2 to create their best L2. And that obviously, I mean, Ethereum itself is worth, what are we at, like 300 billion bitcoin?
00:44:17.364 - 00:44:23.268, Speaker A: 350 billion, yeah, 54 billion since we went up to three k. Yeah, exactly.
00:44:23.316 - 00:44:51.564, Speaker B: So like that, I mean, that's a lot of value capture that L2s could try to come in and also take for themselves. Right. So of course you're gonna get this like proliferation of L2s. And I think we're seeing that like big bang effect of L2s. And I, I don't like name any names, but there are some ones that seem ahead of others. That doesn't really even matter to me. I think, like you said, network effects and liquidity are going to be the big ones.
00:44:51.564 - 00:45:40.828, Speaker B: So I see two strategies happening amongst the L2 competition right now, and I appreciate both of them. I see some going after apps and saying, hey, can we create unique apps to come in and hope we capture users and liquidity. And I see some going after like the best tech and like the best, like what stage are they in as far as decentralization? Goes, and I appreciate both of those. Right? And there was a very unique Twitter exchange I saw a couple of days ago, or maybe just yesterday, whereas, like, someone was talking about, like, blast L2, which is kind of like trying to. It's one of the up and coming L2s that are trying to capture, like, apps. And then one of the arbitrum founders was in this, like, Twitter reply. I was like, hey, we have the most TVL.
00:45:40.828 - 00:46:31.304, Speaker B: Like, why don't you think we're going to be, like, worth this? I'm paraphrasing this by far, but, like, these are these two different approaches, right? Like, early TVL, like, doing it right, and then, like, capturing app layer. And I'm not saying, like, one of these is wrong. Um, but at the end of the day, I think we will settle on only a few L2s. Like, there's not going to be 50 of them. Um, I don't really think the UX is as bad as people make it out to be for the main ones. Now, I will say I had a decent starknet airdrop because I was a genesis validator and stuff, and that was a little painful to go bridge off. And they made it easy because you were able to claim for free and then bridge off.
00:46:31.304 - 00:46:47.810, Speaker B: But just finding bridges, the bridging is tough, but I think the main ones, Coinbase, is kind of like, accepted, like, base arbitrage, polygon, optimism. And there's one or two others on there right now.
00:46:47.842 - 00:46:49.814, Speaker A: I think they do stocknet now as well.
00:46:50.114 - 00:46:51.570, Speaker B: Oh, do they add stocknet?
00:46:51.642 - 00:46:53.014, Speaker A: I think they added it. Yeah.
00:46:53.394 - 00:46:54.682, Speaker B: I should have known that before I.
00:46:54.698 - 00:46:55.762, Speaker A: Did mine the other day.
00:46:55.858 - 00:47:41.650, Speaker B: I would have been a day before that, but that's like, I think the UX will be solved. By the way, this is a topic we talked about, like, five years ago, but exchange is being able to send your ETH to an exchange and then just off an exchange. And I get so many Twitter replies from, like, the funniest is, I get it from, like, Solana manlets, and it's like, oh, you're trusting an exchange to, like, bridge the L2. I'm like, dude, you don't even. You're just trusting, like, your state growth and your verification, everything with no one you know about. I don't think it's the worst to be able to send ETH to an exchange and off to a L2 for your UX, right? Maybe that's not the ultimate principle of decentralization, but we will get there. But for now, if I want to just go to base.
00:47:41.650 - 00:48:17.274, Speaker B: I just send the coinbase and send the base and it takes like five minutes and very little fees. Right. So I think we will, long story short, consolidate on just a, I would say three to four L2s. I've had to guess long term. And those will all just be kind of solved through wallet and exchange Ux because I think even the bridging can be hidden in wallet ux. You just say oh, I'm going to send from whatever it is base to arbitrum and your wallet just says okay, and atomic transactions, all that stuff. Right.
00:48:17.274 - 00:49:09.776, Speaker B: The bridge transaction was $2 and your final transaction was ten cents. And that just all happened at once. And I think we're getting close to this whole atomic wallet transaction thing in general. And there's a few eips actually. I don't want to bust any news, but I'm going to be championing a new EIP soon around because one of my biggest pet peeves at this point is approvals when it comes to EOAs like accounts on Ethereum. But I think we can do a lot of ux improvements around wallets and smart contract wallets and stuff like that to anybody that's been listening for a while, I don't think that's a surprise to them. But a lot of wallets can just hide this stuff and I think we dont really care what L2s were transacting on.
00:49:09.776 - 00:49:17.284, Speaker B: And ten years from now. But for now, yeah its a little messy but I think well just settle on a few of them at the end of the day.
00:49:18.104 - 00:49:44.832, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean I definitely agree that the UX is not where its going to be like in the future. Its going to get a lot better, its going to get a lot easier. Its a bit messy today. I really dont understand peoples point when they say, oh, you have to bridge from a centralized exchange. Im sorry guys, but where do you think your bridge from for any chain, like the vast majority of people, doesn't matter what chain you're using, they're buying the funds on a centralized exchange and then they're withdrawing it to a chain. Like this has been going on from basically day one.
00:49:44.888 - 00:49:49.552, Speaker B: So where are you, where's your money even coming from? Like you gotta get money in and out anyway.
00:49:49.648 - 00:50:08.392, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. I mean, yeah okay, you can get paid in crypto and then have like a full circular on chain economy. But we're not there right now. Right? Most people aren't there. Most people aren't getting paid in crypto on chain. Um, hopefully they will in the future, that's the whole point of what we're building. But the vast majority of people get paid in fiat into a bank account, and then if they want to come into crypto, they only have really one choice.
00:50:08.392 - 00:50:53.952, Speaker A: They have to go via fiat into a centralized exchange or into some like, uh, I guess, third party payment processor that uses a centralized exchange in the backend or uses some kind of centralized intermediary in the background to get you into crypto. Um, or you can do peer to peer transactions which have a number of issues with them. The, the biggest one being like safety as an issue, right. You're not going to carry around with thousands of dollars of cash and go pay. Like, it's, it's not great, right? So there's that point to it as well. But what I find funny about people complaining about these ux things is that it's just hilarious how much the narrative changed over the last couple of years. Like if you actually go back to 2021, the main narrative back then was that the future was going to be multichain and it would multi chain in the sense of like we'd have multiple l one s and like they'd all succeed and we'd all be using multiple l ones.
00:50:53.952 - 00:51:18.968, Speaker A: And then the same questions were arising at the time around ux and liquidity fragmentation, but no one cared. No one was shilling that, no one was paying attention to that. It's just like, nah, it's going to be multi chain. Like, you can't just all be ethereum. And now the ethereum ecosystem is saying that, but being like, well, yeah, okay, it's going to be multi chain, but it's going to be l two s instead of l one s. Suddenly everyone's like, oh, well, what is this? This is broken ux liquidity fragmentation everywhere. We only need everything to happen on one layer.
00:51:18.968 - 00:52:08.444, Speaker A: You know, so it's kind of just ridiculous how much the narrative has changed in just the last couple of years, but I think it's also a maturation too. I like that it changed like that because it means that youve got two sets of people now. Youve got the ones who think that everyone should be done on one layer, which I obviously disagree with because I dont like the monolithic approach to blockchains at all. And then youve got this modular approach, which is the one thats actually winning right now and I believe to be winning long term, where yes, there is fragmentation right now, but there are multiple different ways to actually solve this and more being worked on. And eventually itll all just be very abstracted away from the users. And I think that the narrative doesnt match with the reality. And the narratives are just being by people who don't want the ethereum roll up roadmap to succeed, because if it does succeed, it kind of kills their favorite thing.
00:52:08.444 - 00:52:29.740, Speaker A: Right. Which is true, I think. I don't think that's anything not to be worried about because, yeah, this is a very competitive environment, right. If you're a layer one, you are competing, like, so if you're a monolithic layer one, I consider you to be competing with L2s on ethereum. I don't consider you to be competing with Ethereum layer one. I think the only competition to ethereum layer one is bitcoin layer one. And that competition isn't that great to begin with.
00:52:29.740 - 00:52:49.968, Speaker A: So, um. But yeah, and I think that's. That's why these people kind of show those narratives, because they're like, oh, wow, okay. You know, we need to make sure people understand that, you know, this is broken because of fragmented liquidity. But it's like, okay, well, what is multiple l one s, guys? Like, it's the same thing. And it's less secure, too, because it's very hard to secure those bridges. Those bridges are not canonical bridges.
00:52:49.968 - 00:53:09.166, Speaker A: They're they're actually just iou bridges. And they get hacked all the time. You know, it is completely different security profile. So, yeah, the narratives change over time, but the reality is the reality. And I think that the reality is this stuffs going to get solved. Like, I always bet on the ethereum ecosystem to solve hard problems, and I haven't, you know, we haven't been wrong yet. We both make this bet, and we've been right, I think, up until this.
00:53:09.190 - 00:53:49.058, Speaker B: Point, haven't been wrong yet. I think what you just said is, to me, the narrative of this bull market is this layer, this fine line, bold line between Ethan bitcoin and the rest of crypto, right? I think everyone's starting to realize, like, the investment thesis of the moneyness of Ethan bitcoin. And I 1000% agree with you. There's no, these are all L2s, right? Like, even I don't know what name names, but, like, the top all layer ones right now, they're going to pivot to become Ethereum L2s at some point. There's just no doubt about it, a.
00:53:49.066 - 00:53:53.202, Speaker A: Bunch of them already. A bunch of them already did. But they were more, I guess, like the dead ones.
00:53:53.378 - 00:54:36.894, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Dead. For now. The other ones that are lively are going to become dead and they're going to become L2s. But we're clearly seeing this important around importance around one of our next topics, by the way, should be this idea of small block blockchains and why that's important. So maybe next one in the next couple episodes, we could talk about that. But just the soundness of money that comes from that and the ETF verification and like this investment thesis from tech companies that are now investing cash and they're picking Ethan bitcoin together now, there's a clear line being drawn, and I think that line.
00:54:36.894 - 00:55:02.594, Speaker B: And then you put L2s underneath ETH, and that is the true competition to these all layer ones. And that's what's most important. So you look at this list of L2s. Arbitrum, optimism, Starknet, base, zksync, immutable. Like all of these, right? Like Polygon, Zkevm. I mean, whatever. There's, there's so many of them.
00:55:02.594 - 00:55:50.606, Speaker B: They're not, they're like an additive to ethereum, right? They are just, people want to think about them as like a detriment, but they're not. Like, these are your alt layer ones, but they're additive to ethereum. They're using e to settle. They're using ethos currency, they're using ethos money. And, you know, long term, the UX stuff is so minor. I mean, people complain about UX stuff forever in crypto. I mean, remember, like miss days and like, just going back to early wallet days, and that stuff is so easy to figure out, like the tech and the money ness of the base asset layer and all this stuff that, that's the stuff that takes a long time to get right.
00:55:50.606 - 00:55:54.990, Speaker B: Like the wallet ux is. I mean, I'm not worried about whatsoever.
00:55:55.182 - 00:56:24.410, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I'm in the same boat. I think wallets have gotten a lot better as well, and they continue to get a lot better. But, yeah, I guess, like, because we're. I don't know, we're probably like almost an hour into the pod right now. There are a bunch of questions that the daily grade community had asked both of us. Now, sorry, to anyone's question that I'm going to miss because there's a lot of questions and we're probably not going to have time to get through all of them. So I'm actually just on the channel that the questions were asked in, and I'm just going to go through the ones that I think are the most relevant for us to answer for now, at least.
00:56:24.410 - 00:57:00.226, Speaker A: Got to do with the discussions we were just having. Um, but people actually asked this question and this is related to uh, what we're talking about in the uM, at the start of the pod with like investing and taking profits. And it's all about like unlocks of tokens of projects that have like vc backing. And I think this is a discussion that has no clear answer to because it's like done on a case by case basis. But I want to give some context for people what, what this is actually about. So essentially a lot of projects these days, or most projects or pretty much like all of them, they don't do icos anymore, right? They can't sell tokens to the public anymore. So what they do is, and that's because of the regulations.
00:57:00.226 - 00:57:40.002, Speaker A: Like the SEC has made it very clear that they think any kind of token sale at all is a securities offering. And you're going to get screwed by the SEC if you try to do that. Right. And that has just led to a lot of negative externalities for us people, of course, that I can talk to as well. But, but really what's happened for the vast majority of projects now is that they take VC money, right, money from accredited investors so that its not a securities offering, its basically just like a sale to accredited investors, which is covered by different laws and regulations, I believe. Now because of this, it means that these early participants, both VC's and angel investors, like us, were both angel investors. We both benefit from this get preferential kind of entry into these things.
00:57:40.002 - 00:58:52.564, Speaker A: So lets say theres a new project, hot new project, a L2, and theyre going to raise money at $100 million valuation. So they go out there and they find the VC's, they find the lead investor, they get the angels on board and they announce their raise like okay, we raised $20 million or $10 million from such and such. We have a hundred million at 100 million dollar valuation. Now of course, the majority of these, they have what's called safes, which is a simple agreement for future equity and a safe t or a saft, which is a simple agreement for future tokens, which basically means that you invest initially, you get like equity, and then you convert that to a token once they do a token generation event or a TG, and then you get the token at whatever the fully diluted value ends up being and whatever dilution happens between funding rounds and all that and so on and so forth now and then what that means is that these tokens that you're getting vested over some period of time, so for example, I think the standard for a lot of the projects these days is at least like two to four years of vesting. Some projects will do a thing where that's like one year, Cliff, which means that they'll lock the tokens for a year from when it actually goes public, and then they'll start unlocking the tokens at the year mark. Both optimism and arbitrum have done this, and then theyll just to use them as an example, they vest for three years after that. So you get linear vesting after that.
00:58:52.564 - 00:59:41.802, Speaker A: Now, because of this, theres become a big kind of issue where when the token first launches, really the only circulating supply is the airdrop that they do, which is usually up to what, 10% of the total supply. And then theres a bit of tokens for market makers where they basically loan these tokens out to market makers and say, hey, we need you to make the market for the token, obviously, so that people can be, so theres liquidity there, there. So that's really what you see most of the time. It's like 1015 percent of the token circulating from day one. So then people will look at the vesting schedules and the unlock schedules and say, okay, well, when are these tokens unlocking? How much is unlocking and what's the actual impact on the price going to be? Because the market cap can be like, I'll use arbitrary as an example because they have a big unlock coming up in March. But Albatrum might have like a two $3 billion market cap or something like that, but it's fully diluted. Valuation will be $20 billion.
00:59:41.802 - 01:00:32.550, Speaker A: And that's because it's counting the valuation when all the tokens of all the tokens put together, right, the total supply. Now people will go, okay, well, in March, arbitrary is having a big unlock. 25% of all investor and team tokens are unlocking in March. And I know this because I'm part of this unlock, but it's also stipulated on their website, on the Docs website there. So that I believe accounts for basically the entire market cap of arbitrum. Not the fully diluted value, but the entire market cap of arbitrum unlocking, or at least a large chunk of that unlocking. So then the question becomes, okay, well, what's the price going to do? Do like is it going to go down? Because are these investors going to sell because they're up so much in their investment right from the last round? Are they going to hold, you know, what's the impact going to be? And this is where it becomes extremely difficult to know and is done on a case by case basis where essentially, I think mostly it depends on market conditions, right.
01:00:32.550 - 01:00:57.804, Speaker A: And if it's like a bear market where the token is really depressed and the, I guess ROI on the, on the investment is relatively low, you're going to find that most investors aren't going to sell. They're going to be like, oh, I'm just going to hold because I know the bull market's going to come back eventually. And also theyre very confident in the project, the projects doing well. Im bullish on the project, so on and so forth. Im going to hold here. And theres also different types of investors. Vcs are very different to angels because vcs take outside capital.
01:00:57.804 - 01:01:35.666, Speaker A: Angel investors usually dont. So you have that kind of playing out there. And then if its a hot market, right, like it is right now and where arbitrary is worth a lot and the investors are up a lot, up like 100 x or whatever, the question becomes like, okay, well, theyre going to sell because theyre already up 100 x. That's where it actually becomes more difficult because you're like, okay, again, it depends on the investor. It depends on if they think there's even more upside to come. Like do they think arbitrary is going to $100 billion fooled at value like a five x from here? Do they think that's going to happen? Because the bull market's still in the early stages, so it, and it's very, very hard to know when they're going to sell here. But because of this, because there's this overhang and I'm only using arbitrary as an example, every project has this these days.
01:01:35.666 - 01:02:06.162, Speaker A: But because there's this overhang, it's very hard for a lot of these things to actually be long, good long term investments because what happens is they may go up in the bull market because no one cares, because so many demand coming in, no one cares about unlocks as much. They just buy things and it's like, oh, bullish unlock. This is like a meme that gets perpetuated. But then when the market cools off, these things are definitely the first things to get sold off, especially if they've got these massive overhang because everyone's just like, oh, I'm going to get dumped on if I don't sell this thing. You know, it's a bear market. There's just all these unlocks coming. So that is a kind of huge thing there.
01:02:06.162 - 01:02:38.914, Speaker A: So that's how I think about like the unlocks and trying to go around them. But it is very hard. It is the case by case basis and it really, I think, does depend on what the market is doing at the time and kind of like what the unrealized gains for these investors. And how heavy is it? Like is it heavy vc? Is it heavy angel sort of thing? It's so many different things. And I've rambled for a bit here, but I feel, I feel like I need to give context, people who don't understand how all this works. It's not a pretty thing. And I hate that the SEC has forced these companies to go the private route and not be able to do a public token sale because I do believe icos were fucking awesome.
01:02:38.914 - 01:03:12.546, Speaker A: Yes, okay, 90 plus percent of them, or even more than that were dog shit and went to zero and whatever, whatever. But that's the same with anything. Like most businesses. Like 90 plus percent of businesses fail, but at least people had the opportunity to invest in these things, right? Opportunity to invest in these things without preferential treatment going to, you know, insiders like VC's and angels and stuff like that. So that's my kind of rant there. But Eric, I'd love to get your thoughts on the whole kind of like vesting unlocks kind of thing, how it affects token prices. And I guess the last thing I'll say as well as the ETH has none of this because that ETH had the open ICO and it has no unlocks.
01:03:12.546 - 01:03:18.578, Speaker A: Like the entire supply is out there except for any new supply that we mint, which is known obviously ahead of time as well.
01:03:18.706 - 01:03:35.618, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. The beauty of ETH is it was all out there. Anybody could have got in. Right? And I think I'll go back to, I fully agree. Thinking back to the ICO days, people only got upset and like why regulations happened because a lot of these companies were scams. It wasn't because of how they raised the capital. Right.
01:03:35.618 - 01:04:29.824, Speaker B: And like, I wish we could still do that because we have a fair platform that we could actually do this on until the SEC changes or we get a new SeC head or administration change, whatever. I mean, that's going to take a long time to kind of change those rules. So we have what we have now, right? And I actually think, I think people will be shocked by my take here. I actually think people over obsess about this. So if we look at like a lot of the top 50 coins and let's take like Solana for example, because I think they're like kind of one of the ultimate examples here, they were like, I don't know the exact numbers, but I think they were like 90 plus VC owned early on like that, right? And we had the famous SBF quote of, sell me all your salon at $3, I'll buy it all and fuck off. Right? Like, and like, because that was the bullet. Like, this was a big narrative.
01:04:29.824 - 01:05:37.550, Speaker B: Four years ago or three years ago, whatever it was, three, four years ago, Solana had like a huge unlock coming. There are all these, like, graphs, and Solana was like a dollar two. There are all these graphs of like this, this unlock wave. And I was even myself, like, oh, this thing's going to zero, this huge unlock. Well, I mean, it's like over $100 these days, right? And I'm not the biggest fan of Solana, but like, that VC unlock didn't matter because of the stage of the market we were in and the narrative that they captured. Right? So I think, and you hit on this, of course, but whether we're in a bull market, whatever that narrative is, that matters more than VC dump unlocks coming, right? And a lot of people investing in these, and I know you were commenting on the ones that you have, but youre a very, very small percentage of these larger firms that were invested millions and millions of dollars in these. And these larger firms are going to just dump this thing to zero for a five x ten x gain.
01:05:37.550 - 01:06:14.540, Speaker B: They probably want to write it out. And I just, just, I think the market overemphasizes this. And like, we recently saw this, of course, with the stark token, right? Like a large percent of that was owned by the team or wasn't unlocked, and they had a token generation event that they, like, kicked off two years ago, even though the token just launched. And so that unlocks coming up. But I just, it very depend, very much depends. Like, if you're like, oh, we have a huge unlock coming. And by the way, we're in a huge bear market and everything's down 90%, then your token may go to zero.
01:06:14.540 - 01:06:51.942, Speaker B: But if you're like a L2 when east pumping and everyone's like, oh, yeah, L2 is the shit and things are going up. And there's a small amount of your token out there, like, there's only 5% circulating at this moment. Well, it might set a fire. Right? So it's something to definitely be, like, wary about as an investor. But I wouldn't say, I mean, I set aside like 5% of my portfolio maybe for like, like other investments and like L2s and stuff. I mean, I'm literally like all ETH or like personal stuff, real estate, whatever. But as far as crypto goes, almost 100% ETH.
01:06:51.942 - 01:07:32.864, Speaker B: I do have a little dabble in like L2s and some other alts, but I really don't think about it, to be honest. I just, I mean, I'm with you. I, I wish we could live in this alternate universe where we had this like fair, anybody hop in. Ico of thing. But I think in general, if we're in a bull market and there's larger investors involved, they're not going to just totally shit on you and dump on you, right? Maybe some of their really small investors who maybe want to get a five x out of it, ten x out of it and just need the money at the time. Maybe they will. But these markets are huge.
01:07:32.864 - 01:08:16.072, Speaker B: Just for fun. I mean, I'm talking about ETH now, which is obviously a much larger asset. But just for fun, last night I was like, what would it take me to buy ETH up to 3000? We were like 29, 65, and I was on matcha just like messing around for fun. It takes like $100 million on ETH to move it up like $50. And that's just on a Dax. Now, of course, if you properly spread $100 million over all exchanges, you wouldn't even move it up like a couple of bucks. But I mean, with the market making you mentioned and the money involved in a bull market, like buying up L2s and some of these unlocks, I, I don't really, I just don't worry about it.
01:08:16.072 - 01:08:44.444, Speaker B: That's kind of my like, thought at the end of the day. And just to be clear, I'm in a, I think two layer, two early investments, IMX and Zksync, were like my personal investments. So ZK sync isn't even, they don't even have a token right now. And IMX, I mean, it's doing pretty well. So it's not like I'm like trying to dump on everybody that I'm talking to. And those are very minor investments when it comes to my portfolio. So.
01:08:44.444 - 01:08:49.524, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just not something I like, think people should obsess about as much as they are.
01:08:50.144 - 01:09:24.609, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And I think I wanted to go back to your kind of Solana example that you brought up because I think that's like the perfect example of this playing out over multiple cycles because you're right. Like back in, I think it was like the end of 2020, December 2020. I think it was that massive unlock you were talking about. And I remember this being farted to death, right? Like, yeah, Sol was like, $3 and the SPF quote and all that, right? But then after that, Sol went to, I think, $260 or something in 2021, right? So it went up massively. Now, of course, a lot of that was SPF bidding it up on his own with using customer funds. But there were real buyers there, too, right? There wasn't just SPF.
01:09:24.609 - 01:09:48.589, Speaker A: There were people buying it for solon for whatever reason. So, like, this unlock had zero meaning because of the fact that it was a bull market. But then. Then the unlock actually did have meaning because we saw what happened to Solana in the bear market. It went down to, like, $7 or something, right? It had a brutal corner crash. So that's what I was saying before. I'm like, in a bull market, these things tend to not matter too much because you have so much demand coming in that it's offsetting any of the kind of.
01:09:48.589 - 01:10:16.654, Speaker A: Even if there is selling from these players, it's offsetting that. And then it plays out later because these, as I said, these things are the first things that start to sell off once the market cools down. One, they're riskier than other assets as well, like Ethan, BTC. They're way riskier. And the narratives are like, their narratives fall apart when the price isn't going up. And, yeah, there's those that is that overhang that people start selling and whoever was holding it as inventory and things like that. Right? Because what ends up happening is you pass it to weak hands, essentially, right? And these weak hands would just, like, dump it straight away.
01:10:16.654 - 01:10:29.546, Speaker A: So there's. That plays out. But then, as you said, like, Sol came back from that. They're out like a $100 now. They went to seven, then back up to 100. But that played out over a long cycle. That was like a kind of a four year thing there or whatever it was three four year thing there.
01:10:29.546 - 01:10:55.626, Speaker A: It was like a whole cycle. So what could happen is that these other tokens that have unlocks could go up such and such percent from here, even though they're worth a lot already. Then they crash really spectacularly in the bear market. But then the really successful ones will come back later, right, and go up, go up, go up later. But then the question becomes, like, are they going to go up against ETH, or is it just going to be against us dollars? Like. And it becomes infinitely harder from there. Like, if you're trying to.
01:10:55.626 - 01:11:28.444, Speaker A: Trying to play that game and trying to do everything from that perspective. But, yeah, I agree with you generally that the. Yeah, people will just over index on these things, especially in bull markets. Like it just, it actually paralyzes you from buying them and then, you know, you just like stuck there like, fuck, I missed the opportunity for buying it and kind of like playing this, this trade off. But again, it does depend on the projects too. Like if theyre bigger projects like L2s, theyre probably going to get more demand than something like an app that no ones really heard of before because its all about attention as well when it comes to investing. But yeah, I think in a bull market it doesnt matter that much.
01:11:28.444 - 01:12:07.188, Speaker A: And I mean, as I said before, Im an, Im a recipient and so are you in some of these things. Like we stand to gain from these things. And Im not saying to go or like buy my bags or whatever or anything like that, but I'm just trying to like give my honest kind of take that I think in a bull market, what you think matters is not going to matter because of the fact that there's just so much noise, there's so much demand coming in, so much new money coming in, but then it does play out later on. So I honestly can't recommend to anyone that they should hold any of these things except ETH for the long term. Like, I can't, I just, I don't think any of these things are good investments long term. But short term term, sure. For one cycle, like one bull market, if you binds out the right time, you can probably make some money.
01:12:07.188 - 01:12:11.504, Speaker A: But long term, yeah, no, I don't, I don't think so. Especially not against ETH either.
01:12:12.084 - 01:12:20.548, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think like there's so many, well, it matters what you invested and how well that app does in that founding team.
01:12:20.596 - 01:12:20.780, Speaker A: Right.
01:12:20.812 - 01:13:06.034, Speaker B: Like that, that's the number one. Like what did you actually invest in? And I think like IMX is a good example, right. That thing ran up to like $8, dumped to like $0.30, back to $3. Like that's a huge volatile swing and everyone was worried about those unlocks, right. Um, and it's bounced back after like, but was that like bear market or was it unlocks? And I think one thing to realize is this cycle is to me, I'm mainly staying in ETH and not getting a L2 game because I think the L2 games very diluted. Um, we're going to have 30, 40 L2s competing for capital and theyre competing for that same kind of non ETH capital thats trying to invest to them.
01:13:06.034 - 01:13:36.364, Speaker B: To me, thats why my thesis is hyperbole, ETH and bitcoin to extend, of course, too, because the ETF and that line im talking about between these assets. But I think L2s are going to be fine. But I think that L2, like, rule that's happening of all these, you know, 30, 40 L2s out there, by the way, I'm including all layer ones in there, too. They're all competing for the same capital. I mean, it's just going to get messy.
01:13:36.744 - 01:13:52.008, Speaker A: Definitely. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. All right, we'll move on to the next question. But thanks to Maj 80 ETH for that one and a few, I think a couple other people also kind of wanted to know about that. But the next one I wanted to talk about was one from lucid eyes. And I think this is one that you'll be able to answer a lot better than me.
01:13:52.008 - 01:14:16.044, Speaker A: So he asks what's, what has been some of your methods on maintaining your mental health during bare and bull periods? I know Eric took three months off. In general, how do you guys approach this now? As I said, you're better at answering this than me because I've traditionally been not great at managing this, whereas you just somehow are able to disconnect and take those breaks when you need them. So I. Yeah, I'd love to hear it from you, Eric. Like, what do you do to keep sane in crypto?
01:14:16.464 - 01:15:03.866, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think this is the best question I've ever got, to be honest with you. This is one thing I assess over these days, and I will say, early in crypto, I was very mentally unhealthy. Like, I think the first five or six years I was in it. I mean, so I remember I'll walk back a little bit. I don't want to tell too long a story here, but, like, when I was trading bitcoin back in the day, I remember going to bed and I had, like, leverage trades open. I had my laptop open next to me, and I would fall asleep, and I had dreams of the bitcoin grant. That's how bad it was, right? And, like, I lost that money, and, like, I moved on in life, met my wife, invested in ETH, and, like, yeah, I trade a little ETH, but, like, I kind of left that behind me.
01:15:03.866 - 01:15:43.214, Speaker B: Right? And so that was, that was, like, very unhealthy. Like, that level of obsession of, like, dreaming about crafts. Um, and, like, early ETH days, of course, were kind of stressful as well. But I think the one thing I've realized at this point is, like, like, it doesn't have to be all encompassing. Like, if you kind of step back and read, like, some of these books I've talked about in the past, or we were just recently talking about, like, devil the hindmost, you realize that these markets are just repeating themselves over human history. And, like, this is actually nothing that new. Like, we love the asset itself, but, like, these boom and bust cycles, they're.
01:15:43.214 - 01:16:13.910, Speaker B: They're. They're not going anywhere. And if you. You picture them as, like, four year cycles, you can, like, take breaks, especially in the bear, right? And that's the thing I've taught myself. Like, and Twitter is all encompassing, and you don't need to be there, like, 24/7 so the one thing that's helped me the most is, like, I mean, golfing to me is my number one thing. And cooking, I've picked up cooking. So, like, if anybody wants advice, like, my number one thing over the last four years that I've always golfed my whole life.
01:16:13.910 - 01:16:28.346, Speaker B: But cooking has been my number one hobby to pick up. I just put on music. I put my computer away. I put Twitter away, and I just, like, cook for multiple hours a day. I, like, I have a young daughter, a wife. I cook breakfast. I cook lunch, I cook dinner.
01:16:28.346 - 01:17:03.054, Speaker B: And that's, like, my thing, right? And I kind of step away. And I think every, like, bear market, especially taking, like, six to eight month hiatuses, and I do that, like, early on, I was, like, so addicted. I'm like, oh, man, no one's gonna, like, follow me when I get back. But you know what? I did it. I came back and everyone was still there. And I just, you know, I put all my devices and I just kind of, like, relaxed and read and watched movies, and it was nice. So I think just realizing that, like, everyone's going to be here at the end of the day, like, anthony, you're still here.
01:17:03.054 - 01:17:47.562, Speaker B: All my friends are still here. Right? And, like, realizing east not going anywhere and picking up a hobby is good because I have been truly, like, addicted and obsessed and, like, in a. Not. Not in, like, a bad place, but not in, like, a great place when it comes to, like, bear markets and just being, like, fighting with people on Twitter and stuff. So I do think this is something that heads home with me, honestly. And maybe everyone sees my gray, my gray hair adding to this at a point. But, yeah, I guess I'll wrap it up by just saying, pick up a hobby, cooking in golf or mine, and don't be afraid just to walk away and just, like, you don't even need to like, go on vacation or anything.
01:17:47.562 - 01:18:02.698, Speaker B: Just like, I delete Twitter, I delete discord every, like, couple weeks and just, like, take a couple day break and I just reinstall them. And you know what? All my, all my crypto buddies, the graphs are still there. He's still there. All my friends are still there. So, yeah.
01:18:02.746 - 01:18:34.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's something that I've always struggled with is that disconnect, because you say, you know people, I'll pick up a hobby, but it's more about, I guess, like, you're getting the hobby that's away from, like, crypto and it's away from a computer because I have plenty of hobbies, but, like, most of them are in this room. Like, my figurines is in this room. Like, if I'm building my figure, that's near my computer. So I'm still looking at my computer, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then if I'm, like, playing a game, it's on my computer. If I'm watching a movie, I usually do it on my tv, which is, like, in this room over.
01:18:34.594 - 01:18:54.790, Speaker A: Over there, right? If I'm watching. So it's all still in the same kind of, like, realm room. And that's what I've always struggled with is, like, disconnecting from that and doing something different. And I've been trying to do more of that lately. I mean, me and some of my, um, my friends, real life friends, actually, recently had a, um, a night where we all just kind of went to my friend's house. No computers. I mean, we had our phones, of course, but no computers, no screens.
01:18:54.790 - 01:19:12.950, Speaker A: Uh, and they, there was three, three of them and me. So they were painting the little Warhammer kind of, um, soldier things. I don't. People know about the Warhammer hobby. Like, you paint them, and I was making a gundam. Uh, like, uh, this, this thing that comes flat plastic plaque. Then you kind of, like, um, snap, sniper them off, and then you build the gundam kind of character.
01:19:12.950 - 01:19:34.806, Speaker A: So I was doing that, and there's the first time I'd done that, and the first time, I think, some of my friends had paint in there. But the thing is, is that it was completely different to what we usually do. Like, sometimes we'll play, like, Mario Kart or something like that, but that's still in front of a screen, right? Or they're in, you know, they're into crypto as well. So we'll talk about crypto. But we really just sat there. And a lot of it was, like, pretty much silent where we were. Just kind of working on our own thing, just like enjoying each other's company.
01:19:34.806 - 01:20:16.104, Speaker A: And it was very, very different, and it was very relaxing compared to the other stuff. So I think that those sorts of things critically important for people to do is like, just disconnect, as you say. You don't have to go, like, take long ass breaks, you don't have to go on, like, holidays or whatever, but even doing things like getting away from the screen and going to, going on a walk, going like an hour long walk or something like that, and not listening to podcasts, like crypto podcasts and stuff, you know, I mean, I'm fighting the podcast right now because people probably on their walk listening to this right now. But, like, if you want to actually disconnect, you have to disconnect. It's not, you know, oh, I'm not doing crypto stuff today, but I'm still around the same environment that I do crypto stuff in. No, you have to actually change your environment, and that's where you get the proper break from. That's where what I've struggled with, but I'm doing more lately.
01:20:16.104 - 01:20:36.004, Speaker A: But, yeah, it seems like, Eric, that's what you've been able to do really well, and it's obviously helped you a lot. I mean, you got the grays, but, man, so do I. You can't see them on the stream, but on my beard, I've got the grace, too. And I'm, I'm not, you know, I'm not that much younger. So, uh, it comes to, it comes for us all, unfortunately. You still got your hair. I don't have any hair on my head, so you'd be lucky.
01:20:36.304 - 01:21:19.888, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Comes days. Yeah. And like, I think, uh, the important thing to think about is ethereum is, and David Hoffman interviewed me two years ago about just life and crypto and stuff. And one thing we talked about was how much Ethereum is all encompassing. It's a lot of our careers, it's our friends, it's our investments, it's everything that becomes mentally wearing after a point, maybe if you're only in a couple years, like, it doesn't matter, but after, like 5678, 910 years longer, like, your, your entire life is everything. Your friends, family, investment, blah, blah, blah, is all encompassing.
01:21:19.888 - 01:21:38.024, Speaker B: Ethereum, like that, that does become mentally wearing, and it truly is important. Like, try to step away from it every once in a while. Right? So I really like this question, and I think it's an important topic that not many people in the crypto community talk about at all. So, yeah, I appreciate it.
01:21:38.184 - 01:22:06.472, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And I think, like, it depends on age as well. I feel like if you're younger, like, maybe in your early, mid twenties, you recover faster from, like, being addicted to something, or at least you can deal with it better. But definitely, as I kind of entered my thirties, like, I mean, I started in my early twenties, and then the bulk of what I did was between 25 and 30. 30, I would say the bulk of my crypto, kind of. But then as I entered my thirties, I mean, I'm 32 this year, like, I felt, like, physically drained, mentally drained.
01:22:06.472 - 01:22:38.798, Speaker A: And I'm like, you know, I mean, I'm not old, but, like, I've done this for so long that I feel, what? Much mentally older than what I am because I've just obsessed about it so much because it tends to, like, age you mentally. And I think that you went through that as well. That's why I think you needed to take that long break, is that you'd been just as obsessed as I am, and you had your daughter and everything as well, so you wanted to, obviously, spend more time with her and your family, which makes total sense. Maybe I'll end up doing that one day. But, um, I think, yeah, taking breaks, important. But also. Yeah, the most important thing from what I've done for myself is, yeah, disconnecting and changing your environment.
01:22:38.798 - 01:22:51.878, Speaker A: Not just, like, saying, oh, I'm not doing crypto stuff, but I'm still on my computer doing other things. Yeah, that's not that your brain is not disconnecting in that. In that kind of environment. There. All right, I think maybe got time for one more. Eric, if you've got time for one more question.
01:22:51.966 - 01:22:53.110, Speaker B: Yep, yep, yep.
01:22:53.142 - 01:23:22.070, Speaker A: Sweet. One more. And then, uh, for any of the questions that we missed, guys, I will answer them next kind of drive through that we do. So just keep answering questions every drive through from now on that people have, but just for the sake of time, I'll just have this last one here. So, this one is from rocket, and it's talking generally about the risks associated with restaking and the risks associated with leverage restaking. So, essentially, people do this with. I mean, leverage is like something everyone, that not everyone does, but like a lot of people do within crypto, they do it in various different ways.
01:23:22.070 - 01:23:49.742, Speaker A: But first of all, we have, like, eat stake looping with leverage, where essentially, if you wanted to kind of, like, get more exposure to e staking, you would loop your stake. So you'd basically stake with Lido, get Steth, and then put that steth into a money market, borrow against it, and then go restake loop. And you could do this like three or four times, I think, quote, unquote, safely. I don't consider any leverage to be safe, but people are like, oh, you can do it three or four times and it's safe. Yeah. Okay. But that's what we will tend to do.
01:23:49.742 - 01:24:30.198, Speaker A: And now there's this, obviously, with restaking, you can do, like, restake looping. So you can do the same thing just with a restaking token instead. And people obviously want to do this because you can farm, like, points, and points can potentially become airdrops, and you can earn more money, so on and so forth. Um, I do want to start off my answer to, to, to my thoughts on this, but by saying that generally, I've always avoided leverage. I think leverage is like, the killer for most people. Doesn't matter if you're leveraging, you know, ETH, leveraging stables or, you know, doing leverage trading or leverage restaking or staking any form of leverage is incredibly risky. I think, uh, for, for you as a, personally, as a, as an investor or as a trader, whatever it is, uh, you have a very big risk associated with, with that.
01:24:30.198 - 01:25:00.288, Speaker A: But outside of that rocket was more alluding to, I guess, the risks to the Ethereum protocol and the risks to each of these products. For example, they mentioned in 2022, we had the Steth deep because terror blew up and the market was crashing and everyone was spewing their steth, and there wasn't withdrawals on the beacon chain. So you couldn't actually do that arbitrage. So I believe Steve ended up trading at 0.9, I think, on secondary markets, which means that you could buy 0.9% in Steve and trade it for one ETH. No, sorry, withdraw one ETH from the beacon chain.
01:25:00.288 - 01:25:41.392, Speaker A: If you were able to withdraw at the time, which you weren't, or you could wait for the price to go back up and obviously, and make a profit there. So, yeah, the concern is that if we have so much looping going on and so much restaking looping going on, does it negatively affect ethereum as a network? Doesn't negatively impact the beacon chain. It can and it can't. I think the worst that would probably happen is that thered be mass withdrawals from the beacon chain, right. From people arbitraging, people wanting to get out of their position without taking a massive haircut. For example, if you hold an LST or an LRT and youre selling it into the secondary market, but the secondary market is 1015 percent off of its fair value. Youre probably thinking to yourself, well thats not worth it for me.
01:25:41.392 - 01:26:13.242, Speaker A: Im not going to do that. Im going to just take it from the beacon chain. But then if you do that, the problem becomes that you get stuck in an exit queue. And lets just say the exit queue is, is like two weeks because everyone's trying to exit by the time you exit the fiat value. So the USD value of the ETH is down a lot. So if you wanted to sell that ETH to cover your positions, you couldn't do that. So what ends up happening is that you have like this, I wouldn't call it a death spiral, but you have like this spiral of like liquidations that can happen because everyone's trying to get out and they're shitting themselves because like oh my God, I've got so much debt, I need to pay this down, right, I'm going to get liquidated, so on and so forth.
01:26:13.242 - 01:26:33.314, Speaker A: So I think that those are the risks that I really see associated with that. But when it comes to the risk to Ethereum as a network and the beacon chain itself, I don't think there's much risk there because we have the queues. You can't withdraw the majority of the ETH at once. You have to go through the queue. Right. So I think that the beacon chain and Ethereum would be fine. ETH as an asset would probably take a hit from this, definitely.
01:26:33.314 - 01:27:00.966, Speaker A: Like from all the fear and everything. This, honestly, if this is going to happen, it's going to happen during a macro crypto sell off, basically, when everything's crashing and there's just leverage blowing up everywhere. But yeah, ETH would be negatively impacted. The LRT's and LST definitely will, and those are the main risks associated there. But in terms of its effect on Ethereum and the, the beacon chain, I think that it would be fine. But Eigen layer as well remains to be seen how they would handle this because obviously they have a lot more exposure to this than other protocols would. But we're going to have to see how that plays out there.
01:27:00.966 - 01:27:06.394, Speaker A: But yeah, I generally think that the Ethereum network from a security standpoint would be completely fine in this situation.
01:27:07.054 - 01:27:32.566, Speaker B: Yeah, fully agree. I think it's important to realize restaking itself is not a form of leverage. Think about just taking, in general, we're securing the base of theorem network. Restaking is taking that concept and securing other protocols. Right. And you can get incentivized to do that. Now that that does not mean you're like, leveraging your eric.
01:27:32.566 - 01:28:16.440, Speaker B: So I fully agree with you, and I think this is one of the things we're probably going to run into as a community. We should probably start, like, thinking about this narrative wise and just education wise, because I think we're going to see a big boom in restaking. And I think people are going to start budding it fast and they're going to be like, oh, ETH restaking is leverage over and over. It's not inherently. Right now, if, like, defi protocols come around, you can like, take your e three staking token and then like, leverage that up and blah, blah, blah, and like, trade this and like, if that starts getting a little complicated, sure. But like, inherently, like, eigen layer and these others, the pure ETH restaking is not a form of leverage. Right.
01:28:16.440 - 01:29:10.058, Speaker B: And like, I agree with you, stay away from leverage in general. I'm not scared about pure restaking. Just kind of like, using this trust layer for other applications is pretty genius. And like, eigen layers getting into data, data availability layers and stuff as well. But I'm not personally worried on the surface about restaking being like some kind of like, leverage eventual unwinding event if, like, weird derivatives come out or like, weird defi things come out for this. And, like, you're staking, like, I haven't even thought this far, but if you're like, staking or you're like, trading or pooling staked ETH versus, like, staked ETH for like, leveraging those, like, then that's going to get, like, kind of weird. But, like, natively.
01:29:10.058 - 01:29:14.534, Speaker B: No, I'm not. It's just not leverage as far as I'm concerned.
01:29:15.194 - 01:29:33.450, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And yeah, I mean, I do think we're going to see, as you said, like a big boom in Bostia. It's going to be a massive. I mean, there already has been like, what is Eigen layers tv on there? Like $10 billion or something like that. It's massive. Right? But it's true, like, people have been talking about this recently. It's true that usually these things will boom and bust.
01:29:33.450 - 01:30:05.850, Speaker A: Like, especially when it's something new. Like, I think Eigen layer is going to get really, really big, and just restaking generally is going to get really, really big. And then I I, I wouldn't say that Eigen layer itself is going to, like, crash or kind of like have a bug or anything like that. But I think when it comes to all this leverage that gets built up, not from the restaking, but from all the extra products built on top, as you were just talking about. That's what's going to lead to a lot of the negatives, because what ends up happening is what I described earlier, where you have all of this kind of like, oh, shit. Moment, which is what we saw. We actually saw this in that.
01:30:05.850 - 01:30:26.826, Speaker A: I mentioned earlier how ETH went from 4400 to 1700 in a week in 2022. We saw this when terror unwound. When the winter collapsed, the entire market was in oh, shit mode. And basically like, I need to get out now. And then ETH went down only for eleven weeks straight. There was eleven red weekly candles on the chart. If you go and look at that in 2022, it was crazy.
01:30:26.826 - 01:31:08.446, Speaker A: I remember talking to you about this being like, dude, what the hell? Like, this is insane. But that's what happens during these unwinding events, right? Because the lower the price goes, the more people get liquidated, the more 8th gets so old, the more people shit themselves. Because, like, oh, my God, like, this is just going to go keep going down, the more people sell, you know? And it just. It does get into this spiral. Not a death spiral, so to speak, but it gets into the spiral that will stop eventually, but you don't know where it's going to stop. Like, no one I know, actually, maybe there was like, maybe one person I know was saying that ETH would go below a on off that, right? Everyone else was like, oh, yeah, we'll probably, like, worst case scenario will bottom at, like, the old all time high of 14, 1420. That was the worst, worst case scenario.
01:31:08.446 - 01:31:27.950, Speaker A: But then, of course, we went to 880, which was a lot further down than 1420. And no one thought that. I think I know. I think there's one person I know of that actually thought that was going to happen. So the same thing would happen this time where, you know, let's say we go up to everyone's like, oh, my God, 20k. This is awesome. Like, and then at that point, the more experienced investors will be like, okay, well, we're at 20k now.
01:31:27.950 - 01:31:48.982, Speaker A: Like, that's. That's a huge kind of run up. We're probably going to sell off. But then I reckon what's going to happen is all this stuff's going to blow up. Like this leverage that's built up on top of restaking, not restaking itself, but this leverage that's built up. And then we may end up going down further than people think we do. Maybe people will say, oh, no, $5,000 is going to be the bottom, because it was the old all time high, and then we go to like 3500 or 4k or something.
01:31:48.982 - 01:32:06.460, Speaker A: Right. So I can see that playing out again, and I can see that happening very, very quickly again as well. So these things typically take a while to build up, but then to unwind, it happens within like, maybe three months or something. Not even. Right. It will unwind very, very quickly. But again, restaking, as you said, is not leveraged leverage on its own.
01:32:06.460 - 01:32:32.646, Speaker A: It's. It can be leveraged just like any other kind of financial primitive. But yeah, when it does inevitably blow up and when people do end up getting liquidated from this, that's on them for taking that risk. But you also need to understand that this could negatively impact you as well. Because if you're holding these LSTs or LRT's and you want to get out during this volatile period, you're either going to have to take a haircut on secondary markets or you're going to have to get stuck in that exit queue. So that's something to keep in mind. That's actually one risk, if we're talking about this, that's one risk.
01:32:32.646 - 01:33:02.218, Speaker A: People don't really mention too much when it comes to staking as a solo staker or as a liquid restake. As a solo staker, you still would have to go through the exit queue, but you're not exposed to Lst risk at all. Right? Yes, you don't get the benefits of it, but you're not exposed to this risk. So as a solar staker, you would sit there comfy because you'd be like, oh, well, ETH is going down in USD, but like, hey, block rewards from all the gas fees spiking probably in this environment. And hey, I'm still earning ETH and my ETH is still ETH. Like one ETH is still ETH for me. It's not like one Steve, 0.9
01:33:02.218 - 01:33:34.760, Speaker A: ETH, or whatever it is, right? So when you kind of look at it like. Like that, I think that that's an underappreciated aspect of solo staking, too, and home staking generally, and just staking outside of lsts. But yeah, I definitely think we're going to see something like that. Maybe in, I don't know if we have a bull market into 2025 and then maybe in late 2025, early 2026, we see this kind of thing just like we saw last time. Timelines elude me here. I mean, I can't put a timeline on it, but I think if anything we can guarantee is that leverage always wrecks crypto markets. The leverage that gets built up during the bull market.
01:33:34.760 - 01:33:45.760, Speaker A: I mean, it destroyed everyone in 2022, right? Like, that's actually what destroyed everyone, the leverage that they took. So our rule of thumb generally, I think, is to people with that, if you need to take leverage, understand what you're doing and understand that you can blow yourself up.
01:33:45.792 - 01:34:12.100, Speaker B: Otherwise, steer clear 100%. Greed and fear, that defines every single cycle that's ever existed in markets. So that same thing, right? Greed's leverage, and everyone gets all amped up on it. But the same thing happens on the fear side, right? People get leveraged up short and, you know, us normies just sitting on, like, plain ETH, we survive and that surviving in advance is all that matters.
01:34:12.292 - 01:34:30.584, Speaker A: Yep, exactly. I mean, I've never really taken leverage. I think I borrowed against my ETH once upon a time, like three years ago, but it wasn't to buy more more ETH. It was actually to do an angel investment. I remember doing that, but I paid that down very, very quickly because I was scared, even though my liquidation price was really low. I was like, nah, I hate this. I'm just anxious.
01:34:30.584 - 01:34:41.484, Speaker A: Leverage just made me anxious. So, yeah, definitely agree with that. But, yeah, I think on that note, that's probably going to be it for this week's episode. So. Yeah, Eric, unless you've got anything to add, I'll wrap us up here.
01:34:41.984 - 01:34:47.768, Speaker B: No, no, that's good. I enjoyed the conversation. I like the questions you got from your discord and stuff. So, good times.
01:34:47.816 - 01:35:06.048, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Well, yeah, once again, thanks to everyone who post questions. Sorry if we didn't get to yours this week, but we will hopefully on the next episode. And yeah, you can keep asking questions if you want, guys, in the delegate Discord channel, in the AMA series channel there. And I'll just keep, like, taking note of them and answering the ones that I think are most relevant for the episodes, uh, that we kind of do.
01:35:06.048 - 01:35:23.184, Speaker A: Uh, uh, hopefully, you know, uh, not, uh, not rugging you guys for another four months again on that one. But yeah, that's going to be it for, for this episode. So thank everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give it a, a thumbs up.
