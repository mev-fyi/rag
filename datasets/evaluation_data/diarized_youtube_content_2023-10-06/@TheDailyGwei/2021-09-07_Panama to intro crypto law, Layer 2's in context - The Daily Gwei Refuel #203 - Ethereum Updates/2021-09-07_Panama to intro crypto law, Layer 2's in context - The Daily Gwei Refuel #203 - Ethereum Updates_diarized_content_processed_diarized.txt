00:00:00.520 - 00:00:34.710, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Daily Wave refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Cisano, and today's the 7 September 2021. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So basically I put out this tweet today because I was looking at the crypto markets and I was thinking to myself, wow, there's a lot of crap pumping in the crypto markets right now. And as I said, as is tradition in bull markets. And you know, then I went on to say long term bear markets over two years, decent at separating the crap from the legit projects, but for the most part, I guess I don't think we're going to experience one of those for a while now.
00:00:34.710 - 00:01:03.940, Speaker A: And I went on to kind of like explain a bit more about this in my, in my other tweets here. But what I wanted to kind of focus on was kind of what I was looking at today was essentially I was going down the list on coingecko. Coingecko. And I was like, what the hell is going on? Like why does the top 30 still look absolutely atrocious? I mean, Tron is still in the top 30, it's number 28. It's just crazy. I was just looking at it, I'm like, okay, there's Tron, there's XRP at number six. There's, I'm just scrolling through the list now because I can't remember them all.
00:01:03.940 - 00:01:35.218, Speaker A: Obviously. There's Ethereum Classic at 24 with a $10 billion market cap. I'm just like, like what is this? Like this, it's just absolutely crazy to me. And then there's a bunch of others like EOS at number 32 still with like a $5.5 billion market cap. They're just dead kind of like zombie projects, right? They're not going anywhere, they're not doing anything like, and it just doesn't really make much sense. And the only reason why they have such inflated valuations is because we're in a bull market where kind of a rising tide lifts all boats, right? Like a $10 billion market cap may sound like a lot for etc.
00:01:35.218 - 00:01:58.524, Speaker A: For Ethereum Classic, but the total crypto market cap is 2.4 trillion. So really it's a still a small part of it, but still, I mean, it's just, it's just really, really bizarre to me. There's plenty of other assets that should be ranked much higher than that. The top ten is still a bit of a disaster with, you know, XRP being in there. I mean, dogecoin, I guess, is like, I don't know what people think of dogecoin, right. Cardano being number three.
00:01:58.524 - 00:02:17.716, Speaker A: And then, I mean, it's funny because, like, I didn't notice that litecoin had been pushed so far down at number 14, but it's still number 14. It doesn't, doesn't really do anything right. And maybe this is subjective. Maybe this is just me kind of like, I don't know what I'm kind of, like, bearish on, but this is what bull markets do. They just make absolute crap pump. And it's not just these. There's plenty of other things out there that are pumping.
00:02:17.716 - 00:02:51.030, Speaker A: And then during, like, the long term bear markets, is when you actually get a flushing out of things. Because if you go and look at basically all the assets that were popular, at least most of them that were popular in the 2017 bull market, through the bear market, they got absolutely slaughtered against USD and specifically against ETH. And then they've just been kind of like, trending down against ETH as ether continued its ascent up. Things like eos and Nio and QteM and all these other kind of competitors from back then. But it's not just those sorts of things. It's just all these zombie change. It's just ridiculous, the fact that they're kind of, like, in their ranks so highly.
00:02:51.030 - 00:03:12.454, Speaker A: But then, you know, in my thread, I went on to say, like, how do you play this? Well, I mean, you can ride the waves. If, if you, if you want to take on that risk, you can kind of, like, buy into these things, trade them back, and try and ride these short term waves is very risky. It's really only something a trader would do. It's not something that an investor would do. Um, but it's definitely something that newer investors like to do. Right. They buy into narratives, they buy into surface level stuff because they don't have the extra context.
00:03:12.454 - 00:03:52.134, Speaker A: They haven't done a deep dive. They're kind of, like, behind on, on, on various different things here, but they're going to kind of get up to speed with that. And then, and I went on to say that this is the first crypto bull market where nfts have actually really taken off. We've never seen this before. There was a small blip of this with the cryptokitties mania in end of, at the end of 2017, but it was absolutely nothing compared to what we see today. And this is like a different dynamic to what we see in, I guess, like the token markets where it's much easier to get wrecked on nfts than it is on tokens, because with nfts, the floor can collapse very, very, very quickly. Like, it can literally fall 90% in a day, whereas a lot of these tokens, they can fall pretty quickly as well.
00:03:52.134 - 00:04:15.422, Speaker A: But 90% in a day is usually only seen when there's, like, a rug pull or an exploit or the team kind of like, gets hit with like an SEC notice or something like that. It's not generally something that happens that quickly. Like, 90, you know, 90% kind of fall in a day, so. And also, you still have liquidity after that. Like I'm saying, you know, if nfts fall 90%, the floor falls. It doesn't mean anyone's there to buy it. It could keep falling from there.
00:04:15.422 - 00:04:42.845, Speaker A: So nfts really do have a different dynamic to them. Um, but, but, but on the plus side, even if they kind of, like, collapse in value, you still have the jpeg, right? You still have the image, and for a lot of people, that's enough for them. Like, oh, wow, I lost some money here, but at least I still have something to show for it. Whereas with a token, a lot of the time it just burns a hole in your wallet unless you sell it, or unless you kind of, like, send it to, like, a burn address if it's just completely worthless to you. So there's definitely that, that dynamic. And, you know, then I went on to say, I don't think any of this speculation is bad. Um, it's the lifeblood of crypto, after all.
00:04:42.845 - 00:05:27.392, Speaker A: It's the reason why pretty much, you know, all of us are here, all of us came into crypto. Um, I would say, like, 95% plus is speculation, which is fine. Speculation can lead to net positive effects, as I discussed in yesterday's Deli Gwei newsletter, if you want to go read that. And I think it's also net positive for the entire ecosystem if you just want, like, one clear example of this, the higher the ETH price goes, the more kind of money the ethereum ecosystem has, the more stuff gets built. Like, that is literally the most basic example I can kind of give, but this has a massive onflow effect to the rest of the ecosystem, so nothing wrong with speculation. And short term games are fun to play in bull markets because you can make all this, quote, unquote, easy money, but it's only easy money if you cash out. If you just hold it, then it's just paper profits that you can potentially have.
00:05:27.392 - 00:05:58.852, Speaker A: But if you don't sell anything, then it's really not something you should be measuring in your portfolio. The way I actually kind of think about my portfolio is I look at it and everything that's not ETH, I just look at, and I'm like, okay, well, that can go to zero. Don't look at what the price is now because that's all worthless because I haven't sold it. And the reason why I don't look at ETH, because I don't plan to sell my ETH. But everything else I kind of look at, I'm like, yeah, who cares? Like, the only thing that matters is what the price is when I sell it. And that might not work for you, but that kind of, like, works for me to keep me sane, because these things can go up enormously. Like, they can go up, like, ten x.
00:05:58.852 - 00:06:23.362, Speaker A: Ten x in, in a month or less, some of these things that I hold, but then they could fall much, you know, just as fast. And I, you know, I didn't plan to cash out, sort of thing. And maybe I kind of, like, was waiting for a different time to cash out, or I still wanted to hold for a variety of reasons, right? Like, I don't sell every top. I don't buy every bottom. I mean, I'm not a trader. I'm an investor. Um, but generally, I try not to count my chickens before they hatch, for lack of a better term there.
00:06:23.362 - 00:06:41.594, Speaker A: And all this isn't to say that I'm bearish or anything like that. I know we had a bit of a sell off in the markets over the last few hours. That's all short term noise. I'm definitely not bearish. Far from it, actually. Like, I'm still very, very bullish on the ecosystem. And as I said at the start of this tweet thread, I don't expect a two year plus bear market for a while, if ever.
00:06:41.594 - 00:07:07.490, Speaker A: Like, I don't know if I can imagine another kind of like two years plus, where essentially the world just basically goes to sleep on crypto and then basically forgets about it, stops using it. I just don't see that happening, especially with the advent of stuff like NFTs and Defi. I really don't see that happening. But I could be wrong, of course. Maybe we go so crazy with a pump. Maybe. Maybe the whole market pumps so crazily within, like, six months, it goes to valuations that none of us saw coming.
00:07:07.490 - 00:07:31.340, Speaker A: And then because of that, there's just a lot of people are sitting on paper profits. They decide to cash out, and we crash back down. Right. And then the crash is so brutal that we go into kind of like a long term bear market. But the funny thing is, is that the crash was pretty brutal during May and June, right. We fell ETH fell like 60% in like a week. And we know we stayed around the 1700 to 2000 level, kind of where we bottomed out at for a little while.
00:07:31.340 - 00:08:01.962, Speaker A: And now we're back at almost hit 4k. You know, we've come down a little bit now. I think at time of recording we're at like 3000, 803,800 or something like that. So, yeah, it's been quite a quick recovery there. And I think I, you know, I may have said this on the refuel, but my whole thesis was like, I just don't see any reason to be long term bearish right now because there's still tons of people pouring into this ecosystem. There was only a very brief period of time during, I guess like that downtrend of like one to two weeks where it felt like everyone had kind of like gone off crypto Twitter. The, the, you know, the markets were very quiet.
00:08:01.962 - 00:08:30.304, Speaker A: The ethereum chain was very quiet. Like we had prices in the single gray prices in the single digits again, which I never thought we would see. But that didn't last very long at all. I think, you know, as soon as the NFT mania started picking up just a little bit, we had people flooding back into this ecosystem, a bunch of money coming back in. We had 1559 go live, of course, and the price went to. Now we have so much other stuff coming along with the l two stuff, which I'm gonna talk about in a sec. So, yeah, I mean, it's really impossible for me to be long term bearish on anything right now.
00:08:30.304 - 00:09:00.868, Speaker A: Maybe that'll change in the future if I see things getting way out of hand. But from what? From where I sit right now, I don't see kind of like that being the case. I just see lots and lots of adoption, lots and lots of growth, lots and lots of money being thrown around to fund these sorts of things. So, yeah, that's kind of like my whole view right now. So I guess to end this tweet thread, I said, enjoy the short term games, play around with different things, ape into things if you want to, but always try to minimize your risk as much as possible and don't get stuck holding the bag in the end. That's always very important. But of course, none of that is investment advice.
00:09:00.868 - 00:09:23.822, Speaker A: That is just kind of like my general thoughts on, I guess, the state of the market right now, state of the crypto ecosystem. And, and where I think we're going, you know, over, I guess, like the short to medium term. And, you know, who knows? Maybe we go crazy and then there's a long term bear market that hits us. But that's not to say that there won't be, like, short or medium term bear markets either. That that's just the way markets kind of, kind of tend to work. But the amount of adoption that we're seeing, I just don't know. I don't know.
00:09:23.822 - 00:09:52.350, Speaker A: I don't know if I see this kind of, like, happening anytime soon. And speaking of adoption, moving on to the next piece of news here, Panama announced a crypto law so similar to what El Salvador has done. And you can see in this tweet here, I mean, most of it is in. Is in kind of like spam, so I can't read it unless I click Google Translate, which is a neat feature. I've always found that amazing. Right? The fact that we have a button we can just press to translate any language in the world, and if it's not on Twitter, it's on, like, Google Translate. Just think about like that, to me, always blows my mind.
00:09:52.350 - 00:10:09.930, Speaker A: The fact that we can do that and think about just like, 20 years ago, none of that was possible. Even ten years ago, a lot of that wasn't possible. So, yeah, just as an aside there. But anyway, if I translate this tweet from Gabrielle Silva here, who I assume is the president of Panama. I don't know. I don't know the politics of Panama. I don't even know what kind of, like, democracy they have.
00:10:09.930 - 00:10:48.440, Speaker A: But anyway, Gabrielle says here today we present the crypto law. We seek to make Panama a country compatible with the blockchain, crypto assets and the Internet. This has the potential to create thousands of jobs, attract investment, and make the government transparent. You can see this project here and this links to a PDF which describes all of this. It is in Spanish, so you have to translate it if you don't speak Spanish. And then he, you know, he's got a tweet thread here which basically has a bunch of, I guess, like, nice little images and stuff like that. And then kind of like the benefits here, I think, you know, why is the crypto law important to Panama? Job creation, new ventures, governmental transparency, supports innovation, decentralized, expand the offer of financial services and products and much more.
00:10:48.440 - 00:11:11.522, Speaker A: And then kind of like, finishes off the tweet here. Kind of like saying Panama should not be left behind. You know, let's let's do this sort of thing. This is really cool. I think this is cooler than the El Salvador stuff because El Salvador is basically forcing bitcoin on their citizens, which I really don't like. And I've called this out before, I think, on the refuel and elsewhere, where they've basically made BTC legal tender. And if you don't, you can't refuse to accept it.
00:11:11.522 - 00:11:27.122, Speaker A: You have to accept it as legal tender in the country. So it's kind of like, I guess, very similar to fiat, whereas by decree, and it's. You're being coerced into using it. I really hated that. So I don't know the exact details of what the Panama crypto law is going to look like. I hope it doesn't look like that. But they've also.
00:11:27.122 - 00:12:09.652, Speaker A: Whoops. They've also expanded it out to, I guess, not just bitcoin, but also crypto, like more generally. And they actually mention ethereum in the, in the PDF if you open it up there. And what's really cool is, when you think about this right now, ethereum l two s are ready for kind of like countries of this size because Panama is obviously a small country. A lot of the south american countries are small. And the l two s that for payments such as CK sync and some of the slackware stuff, they can already do thousands of transactions per second. That's more than enough for a small country, because if you think about it, visa globally, the last time I checked, does what, 40, 50,000 transactions per second? That's a global network that's integrated with all of finance.
00:12:09.652 - 00:12:36.468, Speaker A: So just a couple thousand transactions per second for one small country would be more than enough to service them. And over time, that'll obviously get better. We'll get more tps and more scalability out of our layout two ecosystem. But I mean, just thinking about that from a higher level, it's already ready. And that's amazing. And it's funny because El Salvador wants to use the lightning network, but they have to do so in like, such a weird way. They have to basically have these centralization vectors and all these kind of intermediaries sitting in between.
00:12:36.468 - 00:13:05.726, Speaker A: And apparently the app already broke today for some reason. There's all this kind of crap, whereas with something like Zksync or a stockware based kind of payments, l two, they could definitely service this demand and this need. And, you know, maybe they will. Maybe they will get in contact with the Panama government here and try to help them, which I'm really looking forward to. But anyway, you can read this whole kind of announcement in this PDF. It'll be linked in the YouTube description, as I said in Spanish. But you can of course use Google Translate to translate it.
00:13:05.726 - 00:13:37.980, Speaker A: All right, so speaking of L2s, I think I'm going to go through a few L2 things now. I just want to move this here. So essentially Uri kind of announced today, or I guess like said today, that Starkx Uri, for those who don't know, he's the co founder and CEO at Stockware. He said the Stockx cumulative trading volume trading is now at 20 billion. It was 10 billion less than two weeks ago. And then he goes, and wait till you hear about warp Nethermines progress on the EVM to Cairo compiler, which I spoke about on a refuel, I think a week or two ago. But anyway, this is, this is awesome.
00:13:37.980 - 00:14:10.628, Speaker A: I mean, Stockx is powering things like DyDX and diversify and I believe immutable X, maybe I'm wrong there, but essentially it's, I mean, you can see here so rare as well, and immutable. Oh yeah, he lists them all here. Dy DX diversify, so rare and immutable. But all the action is mostly minting, not yet trading there. So it's mostly dy DX and diversify, which is really, really awesome to see. So this, I mean, this growth here is just going to keep going like exponential on these l two s. Like, I don't think people realize how much demand there is for these networks.
00:14:10.628 - 00:14:50.996, Speaker A: And I mean, it's funny the fact that people don't realize this is always funny to me because think about how high the gas fees are on Ethereum and people are still willing to pay those gas fees to get their transactions in. Now, layer one, ethereum throughput is limited to 15 transactions per second, which means it's roughly limited per day. I mean, anywhere from one to 1.5 million transactions per day. And because it depends on how much gas is used per transaction. So it's kind of like hard to tell, but on average, you could say 15 tps, right? These L2s, like optimism and arbitrary are limited as well, right? Now, arbitrary is limited to the same scalability as layer one, and optimism, I think, is even less than that. 100,000 transactions per day, a limit there.
00:14:50.996 - 00:15:25.276, Speaker A: But they're going to keep increasing their limits over time and they're going to get to a point where, where they're offering thousands of transactions per second and that's going to get filled. Like people are going to fill up that capacity. There's just so much demand for these sorts of things. And, you know, you may have seen, and this is probably a perfect segue into the next thing I want to talk about. You may have seen this site from David Mihal here, his latest kind of crypto, sorry, dot in fo site called l two fees. Dot in fo, which shows you the cost of the different kind of like things you can do on l two. So here you can see a simple transfer of ETH on each of these l two s is a, you know, $0.40
00:15:25.276 - 00:15:41.092, Speaker A: on loop ring, $0.40 on Hermes is $0.83 on Zk sync, and then $2.75 on Albatrum one, and $5.83 on optimism. Now, you may be thinking, wow, Anthony, like, these costs are much higher than I thought that would be, especially on arbitrum and optimism here. I thought l two s were going to bring costs significantly down.
00:15:41.092 - 00:16:15.266, Speaker A: And it's like, okay, well, technically, I mean, this is already significantly down from l one, but you need to understand the way l two s work. And I've explained this before, but I really want to reiterate this point, l two s work of economies of scale. So the more transactions that they process, the cheaper that they get up to the limit that they have. So if arbitrary has like a thousand transaction per second limit and they hit that limit. Well, of course the fees are going to increase from there because everyone's trying to outbid each other. But everything under that is basically just paying the normal kind of fees that you would pay. And essentially the fees are basically being.
00:16:15.266 - 00:16:46.764, Speaker A: Are there to kind of. I guess, I mean, a few reasons prevent spam, of course, but also pay for the l one batch transactions that these l two s need to do. So the perfect example here, at least the simplest example I can give, is that imagine that each l one. Sorry. Each batch transaction from these l two s to l one is $500, and say they're doing this once an hour. So this $500 is split between all the transactions on the network within that hour. If there's only 100 transactions for that hour, then each transaction will pay dollar five in fees to kind of like make up for that minimum.
00:16:46.764 - 00:17:10.544, Speaker A: Because there's obviously more than just the batch costs. And you, you know, you kind of don't know what the batch costs are going to be like in the future. You can have like a kind of, kind of estimate there, but you don't know exactly. So I'm kind of giving a very, very simplistic example here, just for illustrative purposes. But then imagine that there's 1000 transactions in that hour instead of, instead of 100. Well, the fees per transaction should go to $0.50, right? As a simplistic case here.
00:17:10.544 - 00:17:40.469, Speaker A: And then 10,000 transactions, $0.05, you get, you get what I'm saying here, right? So, and up to the kind of like limit that they have. So this is, this is kind of like how l two s work opposite to l one in that on l one, the more transactions you process, the kind of like fees get higher. Without two s, the more you process. Up to a certain point, there's like a Goldilocks zone. I guess the, the kind of fees become cheaper for everyone because they have spread out over basically all these different individual transactions. So that's why you see this here.
00:17:40.469 - 00:18:00.774, Speaker A: And as you know, as I said, arbitraryment optimism also do put limited right now. So they can't do more than what they're limited to in terms of transactions. As I said, arbitrary means is limited to l one capacity. Optimism is even more limited than that. So that's why these fees are currently kind of like high here. And this is just for transferring it. You can see here, swap tokens is a bit higher on each of these sorts of things.
00:18:00.774 - 00:18:33.846, Speaker A: But again, economies of scale and already significantly cheaper than ethereum while still inheriting ethereum security and guarantees there, which is really, really cool. But I thought that was just kind of like an important thing to note there because at the end of the day, l two scaling is a marathon, not a sprint. We're not going to get to the point where transactions are super cheap and everything is like super scalable and we're onboarding the world next week. That's not going to happen. This is a multi year rollout thing. And I said at the beginning of this year that it would be the year of L2. And what I meant would be the year of L2.
00:18:33.846 - 00:18:52.752, Speaker A: That rolling in the mail. I should have specified that that's the year that we actually get these things to mainnet, which it has been so far and continues to be, but it is not the year that we onboard the world to these L2s. Um, they're not ready for that. They're definitely very far away from that. And none of the solutions are right. None of the other chains are ready to do this. Stuff like scaling is only one part of it.
00:18:52.752 - 00:19:35.254, Speaker A: You have the UI and Ux stuff, you have kind of like the, the education around it. You have the onboarding tools from different places. It's just, it's going to be like a longer term process here. So I mean, don't get kind of like caught up in the short term noise. Don't believe people fighting this and kind of posting screenshots of this on Twitter saying, haha, these fees are already really high, eats a scam, blah, blah, blah. I mean, I hate seeing that because it's just surface level, you know, smooth brain takes on these sorts of things. If you really dig below the surface and know what you're talking about, you can clearly see the advantage of Zaval two and how it works and the fact that we already have this massive kind of advantage with the lower costs here, given that, you know, their throughput limited is still really, really cool to see.
00:19:35.254 - 00:20:08.690, Speaker A: So, yeah, and I love this site because this is, as I said, these costs are going to come down over time. We'll be able to kind of show that and it's going to be really, really great to see. I hope that there's a graph here, or at least a chart that shows the fees over time because I would love to see, you know, it's starting like really high, not really high, but starting high and then going down over time because the network gets more activity and then posting that in Twitter and say like, here's the L2 economies of scale in action. Here's how it actually works. And I think that'd be a really cool thing to share there. But anyway, moving on from that to a, to a related tweet from optimism. They tweeted out to say, we found some nice l two gas cost reduction techniques.
00:20:08.690 - 00:20:35.550, Speaker A: Aiming to roll them out in the next system upgrade will get us much closer to optimal, get hype, and the next upgrade is we will get ready. So it might be coming soon, which is really cool. And I said, you know, I'm very hype already for this, but essentially this is another kind of facet to scaling via Altoos. We can keep making them better over time. It's not like we roll it out and there's no roadmap and there's kind of like no improvements coming. We're going to keep making them better. There's going to be plenty of other constructions coming to life.
00:20:35.550 - 00:21:20.428, Speaker A: Optimistic roll ups and ZC rops are just two of them. There's also validium and kind of like ZK Porter from Zksync that have different trust assumptions. But it's still, you know, for all intents and purposes, considered an l two. For example, Valydian keeps data off chain instead of putting it on chain, which means that, you know, and the way they keep it off chain is part of like, kind of a data availability committee, which is basically a bunch of nodes kind of keeping this data alive for you. But the downside is that if the nodes decide to withhold the data from you, or if they delete it, or if they kind of like, you know, lose it or whatever, then it could lead to a potential loss of funds, or it could lead to censoring because they're withholding the data from you. That's just a trade off you take to achieve more scale. But at the same time, these are just like a handful of solutions, a handful of constructions.
00:21:20.428 - 00:21:49.388, Speaker A: We, there's so much money pouring into this kind of, like, ecosystem. I mean, the other day, arbitram raised $120 million. Polygon obviously merged with the Hermes team to do zero knowledge stuff. They committed a billion dollars plus to that. I'm sure these other l two teams are either already raising already have a ton of interest to raise, like, optimism. ZK sync I mean, Starquare raised what, like $80 million a couple months ago or something like that. And, you know, when they do do their tokens, which they will, like, you guys keep.
00:21:49.388 - 00:22:11.920, Speaker A: I mean, not you, all of you guys, but some of you guys keep pushing back on, on me on that. Like, oh, you know, it doesn't make sense that they do a token, guys, like, it actually does make sense. And some of them have already announced that they're doing a token zone. ZK sync have said that they're doing a token. Like, it's not, it's not a secret. And these other ones, you know, they may say they don't have a token right now, but they will probably have one in the future. And that's not me having any special knowledge or anything like that.
00:22:11.920 - 00:22:57.364, Speaker A: But it's just the way I see it is that a token is needed for. For staking, because you need to stake the token so that you can decentralize out the sequences or the block producers, essentially, of the L2s, so you can get more censorship resistance, and then you can also kind of like, have a more of a self sustaining ecosystem as well. And yeah, and there are different users here. Maybe there's governance as well, these L2s and stuff like that. I know that's a meme, but it could be that, right? So from that perspective, definitely expect that. But anyway, I'm really excited to see all of the kind of like, L2 innovation that's going to keep happening. Over the coming years and the fact that we get to kind of like, do this while preserving Ethereum security decentralization is what makes me most excited about, about this ecosystem at the end of the day.
00:22:57.364 - 00:23:43.626, Speaker A: So Frank Chaparral shared a article from the block today saying that Standard Charted, which is one of Britain's banking giants, apparently I'd never heard of this bank before, is more bullish on Ethan bitcoin. They have a $35,000 price prediction for ETH now. Really? Who, like, I mean, realistically, who really cares what the banks think at the end of the day, I certainly don't. But I think this just sends a signal out to all the tradfi people and all the, like, legacy system that, hey, this bank's giving this kind of price prediction here. You know, kind of like, let's take this. Some people take this literally and say, oh, my God, I better like buy ETH or I better buy bitcoin or whatever. Because they also gave a kind of bitcoin price prediction where they said bitcoin could increase up to three times from current levels while it sees ETH going up to ten times from current levels.
00:23:43.626 - 00:24:16.842, Speaker A: I'm sure they have their own internal valuation kind of like, kind of like report they put together for this that they've circulating to all the institutional and stuff like that. At the end of the day, people just pump their bags, right? Like we all do it and, and this is just sending a signal out. I mean, I don't think $35,000 is out of, out of kind of like the question at all. Like, you guys know that my longer term price prediction for Ethereum is $100,000. And I'm talking long, long term, like, you know, 510 years sort of thing. Not tomorrow. Come, like, guys, don't quote me on, on that and say, hey, you know, Saskatchewan predicted $100,000 tomorrow.
00:24:16.842 - 00:24:46.696, Speaker A: Like, no, no, short to medium term, I could definitely see $10,000 happening. Um, about $100,000. I expect to happen on a more longer term timescale here. But people will often say, like, these are crazy price predictions. How could you say that? It's like, guys, like, we're not building something like a hobby project here. We're building the future of the financial system. And if that is not worth $10 trillion market cap, then what are we doing? Like, if once it really takes over the world and really gets integrated with all of kind of like the world's financial system and becomes the world's financial system, it becomes ubiquitous.
00:24:46.696 - 00:25:36.234, Speaker A: There's no reason in my mind that ETH can't be worth $100,000 or a $10 trillion market cap or a bit, I guess more than a $10 trillion market cap, depending on the supply at the time due to the fee burn. And also we have all the kind of like value accrual mechanisms to eat because of the fee burn, because of staking, because of defi collateral, because of like everything else, like money ETH being used as money within NFT, the NFT economy and elsewhere. So, yeah, I mean, these price predictions may be superficial, whatever. It just sends a signal out to the ecosystem that, hey, these banks saying this and these tradfi people in institutions may be like, oh, we better buy, or whatever. That's just how this kind of works, I think. So Chainlink God put out a good tweet today reiterating my stance about EIP 1559 not being the cause for the high gas prices right now. So he says, no, AIP 1559 did not raise gas prices.
00:25:36.234 - 00:26:00.420, Speaker A: It stabilized gas fees and helped prevent users from overpaying. On average, ethereum gas prices are higher because of NFT maniacs increased demand for block space, which has gone absolutely exponential. Correlation is not causation. Now, I think I've mentioned this on the refill before, that it's just a pretty freaky coincidence that NfT mania started at the same time. 1559, I kind of like went live. So people are kind of saying, oh, well, 1559 increased gas fees. No, that's not the case.
00:26:00.420 - 00:26:48.096, Speaker A: And there's a few charts here you should be made aware of. This is the chart that shows what the gas fees kind of look like prior to 1559 and what they look like post 1559. So you can see that they were a lot more erratic on the left hand side, you know, prior to 1559 going live, and a lot more kind of like smoothed out on the, on the right hand side and a lot more predictable over time, which is really cool. And then there's another chart here showing kind of like, I think this was the one that Nick, Nick Johnson put out. I can't remember exactly what, what this show, but I think it just showed that like, kind of like the baseline that people were paying kind of came down over time. Came down with 1559, essentially, or, sorry, the overspend, I believe so that the amount people were overspending on fees came down. And it came down exactly when 1559 went live in one sharp drop on August 5 or 6th, depending where you were.
00:26:48.096 - 00:27:16.986, Speaker A: And then you can see here, look at the open sea monthly volume for August. Like this is clearly incredible network demand because of nfts. Like, there is no clearer explanation to this than nfts increasing network demand. And then you can see here the gas guzzlers open season number one, right? I mean, axiom infinity as well is number five here. And that is also available on the ultrasound money website. In their little table that they have, it's very clear to me that nfts are the things that that cause gas prices to go up. 1559 is not the cause there.
00:27:16.986 - 00:27:51.190, Speaker A: Anyone saying so is either misinformed or just trying to spread fud at the end of the day. So Synthaman, kind of, quote, tweeted this tweet from Liam here, teasing this decentralized Bitmex on L2, which is basically Quinta, which is leveraging Synthetix's protocol here. They're going to be offering, I guess, futures on optimism's L2 protocol here. Permissionless and available both in the US and China as well. So that's pretty cool. They're not limiting this to people outside of the US, which a lot of these kind of defi protocols seem to be doing these days. So looking forward to seeing this go live.
00:27:51.190 - 00:28:23.062, Speaker A: Just another, I guess, kind of like app. And another thing to do on the optimism network. And speaking of things to do on L2 networks, mech Dex here announced that they are fully live on arbitrary mining, and transaction mining is starting next week. So stay tuned for that. But if you want to play around with mech Dex, which is a perpetuals trading, perpetual swap protocol on arbitrary and on L2, experience the lower fees. You can go do so now at at Mech Dex IO and switch to the arbitrary network, obviously to interact with that. And as I said, their liquidity mining and transaction mining programs are starting next week.
00:28:23.062 - 00:28:35.114, Speaker A: But I think on that note, I'm going to end it for today. So thank you everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
