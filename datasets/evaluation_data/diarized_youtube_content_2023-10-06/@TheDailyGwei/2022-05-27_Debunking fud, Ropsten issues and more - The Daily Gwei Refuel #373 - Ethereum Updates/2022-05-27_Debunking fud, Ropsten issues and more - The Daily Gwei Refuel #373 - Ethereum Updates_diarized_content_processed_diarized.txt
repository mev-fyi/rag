00:00:00.240 - 00:00:30.286, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the deliberate refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Sassano, and today's 27 May 2022. Alright, everyone, let's get into it. So I had crazy 24 hours in the crypto ecosystem, a lot of Fud around Ethereum, a lot of fud that I'm probably gonna have to spend a bit of time debunking here. And I made a kind of like list kind of here that I'm gonna go through. But basically I put out a tweet today where I say, you know, holy shit, the amount of Fud being thrown into Ethereum today is just too much. The worst part is that the Fud is so misinformed that I feel like I'm back in 2018.
00:00:30.286 - 00:01:08.054, Speaker A: I encourage all of you not to just read random tweets and take them as fact. And then I listed out some of the fud here. People brought more fud to my attention that I didn't, that I kind of like didn't remember. Basically the beacon chain, real fud from people who don't understand it. Now, I've spoke about this yesterday, so I'm not going to rehash this here, but there was a good tweet thread here from Martin, Martin Koppelman, the person who put the out the original tweet thread. I highly, highly recommend going and giving this a read because it basically describes exactly what happened and why it is unlikely to happen in the future and what, you know, what fixes are in place and things like that. But the TLT are just for those who didn't, maybe didn't kind of like understand my explanation yesterday.
00:01:08.054 - 00:01:56.764, Speaker A: Basically what happened was that one set of clients had one kind of like fork choice rule that they were kind of adhering to. And what if the fork choice rule means is basically when kind of like validators are building kind of like blocks and building on a chain there, the fork choice will kind of like dictates kind of what happens and kind of like what chain to build on, what chain? Kind of like that, where the head is. So if you don't understand kind of like that terminology, this is just kind of like fundamental blockchain stuff. But essentially what happened is like half of them had the kind of like proposal boost feature and half of them didn't, which meant that, I mean, there wasn't a kind of like a failure of consensus, but it meant that one of them was kind of like working far so one set of validators working faster than the others. And then there was a kind of like that reel that happened. But I highly recommend giving Martin's thread a read here, as it explains it much better than I can. And it was a really, really great thread.
00:01:56.764 - 00:02:31.418, Speaker A: So that that kind of like fud is pretty much debunked at this point, but I still saw people spreading it. It's just really silly fud. And then the second one was, some people are saying that the beacon chain doesn't have finality, which I was like, what the fuck? Yes it does. It has finality every twelve minutes, every two epic. So an epic is six minutes. And then every two epics we have economic finality, which means two thirds of the staked ETH basically puts its weight behind everything up until that point, not being able to be kind of like, kind of like real basically, or kind of like a changed. And if it does attempt to be changed, well, then that two thirds of ETH would kind of like get slashed.
00:02:31.418 - 00:02:57.346, Speaker A: We have those in protocol mechanisms. I think there were some people who said, well, what we really meant was instead of finality, we meant fast finality, which is what something like tendermint has. And a theorem is working towards faster finality. But the thing is, is the reason why we didn't do fast finalities. Because with fast finality, you're limited to the amount of validators you can have on the network. And Ethereum obviously wanted to optimize for as many validators as possible. And that's why they went from kind of like that twelve minute finality instead of fast finality, which is usually much quicker than that.
00:02:57.346 - 00:03:47.994, Speaker A: But there are upgrades coming that would, that would kind of like put that into Ethereum or make finality faster. But Ethereum, the beacon chain, does have finality, right? It's just not the kind of like fast finality that you may see in some other chains that have kind of like made that other trade off of having less validators, but kind of like faster finality there and then third here, which is about Ropsten. So people are saying that because some miners through more hash at Ropston, it means the merge on mainnet is super risky. So what happened with Ropston? Basically, there's a few threads here that I want to kind of, kind of highlight. Not, not this one. Where's this one? What? This one here from Preston Van Loon, who kind of like put a screenshot out showing that Ropston's hash rate actually spiked. Now, as you guys know, Ropston is going through the merge transition on June 8, and it had a TTD value kind of like given to it, which basically meant, like once it reaches this kind of like difficulty, you'll turn it to the merge.
00:03:47.994 - 00:04:15.786, Speaker A: Now, some miners basically trolled Ropston through their hash rate behind it and sped up TTD, which meant TDD actually happened yesterday, I think, or today, like earlier today. And, you know, that's just been, that's just been kind of like reconfigured, so it'll happen later. It happened at the kind of like the original time, but essentially it was just a troll attack from, I mean, I don't know, call it an attack. It's just like a troll from miners. And this can't happen on Mainnet, so it doesn't even matter. This is literally a waste of time for. For core devs.
00:04:15.786 - 00:04:44.546, Speaker A: Now they have to kind of like deal with this because this is impossible to happen on Main net. Well, I mean, not impossible, but extremely unlikely. Because to do this on main net, you would need to buy like a shit ton of miners, right, and point a shit ton of hash out Ethereum, which is infeasible. And. And basically there's a couple of threads about the Ropston issue, one here from Tomas, which has a detailed description of the Rops and TTD issue that you can go and check out. But also kind of one here from Doug, who says why the Rops and TTD attack is not feasible for the merge on Ethereum. Mainnet explains it.
00:04:44.546 - 00:05:28.014, Speaker A: I'm just hiding these threads because I want you guys to kind of, kind of give those kind of a read there. And then there's one here from Lawrence who kind of like gave more context at what happened with rops than here. But yeah, essentially what happened was, I guess the Tldr of TlDrs is that miners, some miners put hash behind Robson. They sped up the kind of like timeline to getting to TTD. TTD was reached and then kind of like the cordova's like, well, we obviously don't want it to reach now because the Rops and beacon chain isn't even live, right? Like the robust and beacon chain doesn't go after the 30 may, so there's no merge going to happen. But as I said, it's just been kind of like a waste of time for core devs because I don't have to deal with this. And as I said, it's more of a troll than an attack because it doesn't really attack anything.
00:05:28.014 - 00:05:52.280, Speaker A: This is not a feasible thing to do on main net. So it's not going to affect the main net merge at all. And it's just like a waste of core devs time to kind of, like, deal with this now. So that was that kind of, like, fud there. Then there was some, some more fud around. Where is it? I'm going through my tabs here. I mean, someone put this out as a joke saying that there was a massive eight year vesting unlock from the ETH ICO that started yesterday.
00:05:52.280 - 00:06:10.200, Speaker A: And I was like, what? Like. And then they said, oh, I'm just joking. But, like, the thing is, a lot of people believed this. It wasn't just a joke. And there was someone on a podcast, I think, Scott Malka with you. Kind of, like, a bunch of people talking about this as if it was fact. And I was like, what the fuck is going on? Like, sorry for the f bombs lately, guys.
00:06:10.200 - 00:06:31.682, Speaker A: But, like, my mind, like, right now is just. Anyway, what happened was this person put out the tweet and then someone ran with it, and then people kind of, like, believed it. Guys, the Ethereum Ico had no vesting. There are no tokens unlocking. Everyone that got their ETH from the ICO either is still holding it or has sold. Like, there's no vet. There's no more east to unlock, especially not after eight years.
00:06:31.682 - 00:06:50.952, Speaker A: Like, what the. Like, I just don't know what. What's going on. Like, why do people believe this to begin with? But anyway, this is totally false. Not true at all. Just wanted to kind of, like, cover that as another bit of Fud that I've seen. And I'm sure there's other bits and pieces here that I've kind of, like, that I've kind of, like, missed or kind of can't think of right now.
00:06:50.952 - 00:07:06.832, Speaker A: But that was it for the last 24 hours in Fud land, guys. Like, I am. I'm just, like, so puzzled. Like, I have to be honest with you. Like, as I said, I haven't seen this amount of just, like, stupid fud since the 2018 bottom. And I don't know if the markets are going to bottom here. I'm actually going to talk about the markets in a sec.
00:07:06.832 - 00:07:31.500, Speaker A: But, like, I don't know if the markets are going to bottom here. I don't know if it's gonna go lower than what it is now. I don't know any of that sort of stuff. Right? You guys know, I'm a long term investor. I don't really care about the short term stuff. But in saying that there is a saying narrative is dictated by kind of, like, price. Where were all these people fighting ETH when it was at a higher price? Like, when waste with three k plus, where was all this fud? It didn't exist.
00:07:31.500 - 00:07:52.248, Speaker A: Right. And now that ETH is like, I guess, 1800, whatever it is, right now, people are now saying things like, oh, the merge is, like, super risky. We have to risk off ETH because it's, like, super technically risky. Look at the beacon chain. Look at the reorg that happened there, or the etheps don't know what they're doing, blah, blah, blah. You know, all this kind of, like, just fud coming out. No, because the price went down.
00:07:52.248 - 00:08:22.286, Speaker A: Right. So I put out a tweet where I. Where I basically said, until you realize that narrative follows price and not the other way around, you're not going to make it. Pay attention to how many people are now coming out of the woodwork to be bearish on ETH based on some narratives, to just because it went down in price. So if someone is literally just changing their opinion on an asset because it goes up or down in price, that someone is not worth listening to, in my eyes, yes, you can have a thesis that doesn't play out, and then you can kind of, like, admit, okay, well, I had this thesis. I was bullish on it. It hasn't played out, you know? But you're not changing your thesis just because the price went down.
00:08:22.286 - 00:08:32.699, Speaker A: You're changing it because the fundamentals changed. Right. There's a very, very different thing there. So. So that's that there. But there was this tweet here from Joseph Lubin that I thought of today, and this is one of the most legendary tweets. I love this one.
00:08:32.699 - 00:08:53.823, Speaker A: He put this out on December 22, 2018. This was six days after ETH bottom. That $80 in 2018. He said, I am calling the crypto bottom of 2018. This bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt from our friends in the fourth and crypto fifth estates. Now, he has a little thread here, but that's, like, kind of the gist of it there. So he called the bottom pretty, pretty spot on here, but pay attention to that.
00:08:53.823 - 00:09:14.640, Speaker A: This bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. That's what I felt over the last 48 hours. An epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Now, what I really want to highlight for you guys is the replies here. This is just chef's kiss. The replies are very similar to what we're seeing today. This person here, with all due respect, the bottom isn't in.
00:09:14.640 - 00:09:28.320, Speaker A: However, I am holding BTC, and Ethan wouldn't sell any of it because they're both going to make new all times highs in next. In the next five years. Right. So they obviously got the second part right there. But, like, the bottom isn't in. Right? Like, so confidently, with all due respect, the bottom isn't in. Right.
00:09:28.320 - 00:09:37.470, Speaker A: Um, and then you. There's. There's a bunch of these kind of, like, replies here. There's. There's. I'm just kind of, like, scrolling through them here. I should have saved them before, but basically, you know, I'll call the bottom.
00:09:37.470 - 00:09:44.342, Speaker A: When. When you particular capitulate. Hell no. Yeah, this isn't. This isn't the kind of, like, the bottom. The bottom. Where else is.
00:09:44.342 - 00:09:57.778, Speaker A: There's a. There's a bunch more here. Crypt doesn't have a bottom. I'm calling the bottom, you know, oblivious, blah, blah. There's this one tweet that I really wanted to highlight for you guys. I should have kind of, like, brought it up before. Before I kind of, um.
00:09:57.778 - 00:10:23.530, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. From tadpole. He said, crypto has never experienced a true bear market in the overall economy. I don't think we can call bottom until we see a bottom in the stock market. We're in uncharted waters for crypto. You could take this tweet, which was put out December 22, 2018, and literally repost it today, May 27, 2022, and it would sound exactly the same and it would mean exactly the same as it meant back then. There are the same people saying this today.
00:10:23.530 - 00:10:34.248, Speaker A: Well, not same people there. There are the similar. There are similar things being said today. Oh, you know, crypto can't bottom because the. The overall economy is in the shits. Like, crypto has to go, sorry, the stock market has to bottom first. All these sorts of stuff.
00:10:34.248 - 00:11:04.464, Speaker A: Right? Like, it's just crazy. Like, I really like going back and learning from history because it never changed. Like, humans don't change. Right? Like, where? I mean, Tim Shaughnessy, I think Tim Shawn or Tom Shaughnessy, someone. I can't remember his name right now on bankless, hasn't do a podcast recently on there, but he said that we all run human Os, and humanos doesn't get an upgrade for thousands, tens of thousands of years because human evolution takes much longer. So think about financial markets over the last 100 years. Humans haven't changed at all.
00:11:04.464 - 00:11:21.484, Speaker A: So you can go back 100 years and humans will have been the same back then as they are today in their reactions to markets. And just going back and learning from that history can actually help you and help you stay grounded. So I just wanted to highlight these kind of like replies. You can keep. You can keep going. It's like, I think apathy will mark the bottom. Commodities can grind sideways for years.
00:11:21.484 - 00:11:41.324, Speaker A: Those who know it best love at least because they have been disappointed. Most many projects don't need a token as part of their architecture. Again, take this tweet, post it today. It's the same. It's the same thing, right? Like, ETH is a dead coin. Um, ETH is going to have dumped to 50 USD in a week, right? Look, guys, I'm. As I said, I'm not saying that right now, is the bottom like, or 1700 is the bottom.
00:11:41.324 - 00:12:02.894, Speaker A: I don't know where the bottom is, but just reading the replies to this tweet when ETH had already bottomed, mind you, it had been six days since ETH hit $80. I think Joe put this out when it was about 95 a $100. So Ethan already bottomed, but people didn't believe it because people were like, really bearish. It works both ways. On the way up, guys. Like, on the way up, people were calling for a 20K ETH, right? I know. I was saying it could possibly go there.
00:12:02.894 - 00:12:25.788, Speaker A: I, you know, who knows, right? And it's a bull market. But. But the thing is, like, okay, that's a bull market. Now we're in a bear market, and the people calling for things like triple digit ETH, doesn't that sound the same as someone calling for 20K ETH in terms of kind of like the greediness. So bears get greedy too, right? They might. They may have, like, shorts open that they don't want to close yet, or they may be sitting in cash and they want to buy in at the cheapest possible price. They're going to say, whatever.
00:12:25.788 - 00:12:53.236, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, no one has a crystal ball. No one has any idea what the price is going to do in the short, medium, even the long term. You make your bets, you place your bets. There's never 100% certainty in anything in investing, ever. And that's the cardinal sin of investing, is thinking that it's a sure thing. Right? As bullish as I am on ETH, there is no way in hell that I would ever say that our ETH is 100% guaranteed to do this or 100% guaranteed to do that. Because I can't guarantee that I can't tell the future.
00:12:53.236 - 00:13:02.060, Speaker A: If I could, it'd be a lot easier to invest. But alas, I'm not. What's that character from back to the future? Right. That kind of. I had the sports almanac. I'm not him. Can't do that.
00:13:02.060 - 00:13:25.044, Speaker A: So when you're looking at the markets, when you're looking at the public commentary on Twitter, when you're looking at kind of like fud. When you're looking at people, kind of like calling for, like, ridiculous prices, either way, I'm not just talking about down, I'm talking about up as well. Just remember that no one knows. Everyone's giving an opinion. There's not a fact. So just do not listen to them as if they're saying something. That's a fact.
00:13:25.044 - 00:13:41.524, Speaker A: You have to position yourself for what suits you best. You buy when you want to buy, or you feel like is the time to buy. Maybe you're using a guy. Maybe there's someone you follow that has, like, a really great model for buying bottoms and selling tops. You can follow that. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. There's no guarantee that it's going to work, but you're free to do what you want.
00:13:41.524 - 00:14:02.848, Speaker A: But what I'm saying in general is that you need to just, like, understand that narrative follows price. People say shit about price all the time. Everyone talks about out of their ass, basically, about price. No one knows where it's gonna go. And you. And as long as you kind of, like, come to terms with that, I think you'll do well over. Over kind of like, the longer terms there.
00:14:02.848 - 00:14:17.564, Speaker A: But I think that might be it for another daily rant here. But, yeah, I just. All these kind of, like, tweets and everything will be linked in the YouTube description. You can go check out for yourself. But, I mean, the fight around Robson was super hilarious to me. It's like, guys, it's a freaking test net. Like.
00:14:17.564 - 00:14:40.824, Speaker A: Like, why are you fighting? And, like, it has nothing to do with mainnet either. It's not like this is going to impact the main net merge and all that sorts of stuff. And then the continued beacon chain fart. It's like, oh, my God. You know, seven block reorg is catastrophic. I mean, to be fair, a seven block reorg, if the. If it was post merge and there was a lot of activity in the blocks and things like that, would have probably hurt some users because of the mev implications.
00:14:40.824 - 00:15:09.018, Speaker A: But the thing is, people are acting like it's the end of a theorem. They're acting like it's a fundamental issue with a theorem proof of stake when it isn't ethereum proof of stake works fine. If 100% of the clients were running the proposal boost, this would never have happened. And now I'm sure a lot of more clients have updated. As I said, they're going to be forced up there anyway as part of the hard fork that's coming for the merge related fork for the beacon chain. And even Martin said in his thread that he doesn't expect there to be reorg like this on post merge at all. And I don't expect that either.
00:15:09.018 - 00:15:41.768, Speaker A: Like it's just, it's just funny when you kind of like look at this sort of stuff because it's just, it's so, it's not complex. Like there are, there are kind of like threads out there explaining it like you're five. I'm trying to explain it to you guys as best as I can. You know, there are smart people telling you that guys like this is not the issue that everyone is making it out to be. Right? But as I said, worst case scenario is if something like this happened post merge, there would be mev consequences here and users would probably lose money in that sense. But I mean, it just depends, right? Depends what happened in those seven blocks, obviously. So, yeah, anyway, I'm gonna move on from that now.
00:15:41.768 - 00:16:11.294, Speaker A: Got some other things to get through, but I'll link all of these tweets in the YouTube description for you to check out. Alright, so John here from Adelphi Digital put out what I truly do believe is that the definitive deep dive on Ethereum's roadmap. So it's called the hitchhiker's Guide to Ethereum. It is long and dense. Guys like this is not light weekend reading. This is sitting down, removing all distractions and reading it and taking it all in. Because you can see, I'll scroll through it here.
00:16:11.294 - 00:16:50.104, Speaker A: It's very, very long and very dense and lots of technical jargon. And this is basically everything you need to know about a theorem's roadmap all in one piece. And there's chapters, you can go through it if you don't want to read about certain things, but this is deep. So if you're interested in being as up to date on the Ethereum roadmap as possible from a technical level as well, then this is the guide to read. I just think this is absolutely awesome. Like the fact that someone has put this together is great because I'm going to link this to everyone from now on and be like, hey, this might be a bit technical, but if you really care about what's coming for Ethereum, Ethereum's roadmap in general. This is what you should be reading.
00:16:50.104 - 00:17:04.342, Speaker A: And I actually haven't read it yet. Like, I mean, I haven't had time to read this today. I only saw it today and it's like, it's really, really long. But as I said, not light reading. Sit down with a coffee, cup of tea, whatever you drink, maybe a beer. Right? On the weekend. I mean, the weekend's tomorrow.
00:17:04.342 - 00:17:14.502, Speaker A: At least it is for me. Oh, no, it is for everyone. Right? Like, my weekend's much closer. It's like 11:30 p.m. Right now. But, um. And just read it, right? Just read through it, take it all in.
00:17:14.502 - 00:17:37.354, Speaker A: Don't kind of like feel bad if you don't get it the first read through. As I said, it's technical, but if you do want to kind of like get really up to speed with everything, you can do it. And you can see at the top here, it's a 52 minutes read. Maybe it takes you an hour to read, it takes you a bit longer, but it's a good Saturday afternoon or something read. I think I'm definitely going to try and read it over the weekend, that's for sure. But yeah, just wanted to highlight that. And thanks to John for putting this together.
00:17:37.354 - 00:18:09.040, Speaker A: Amazing work here. All right, so speaking of great work, Sudo Theos has put out another tweet thread all about the layer three paradigm shift in blockchain scaling. So obviously we'll link this thread in the YouTube description below for you to go check out. But I've mentioned layer three scaling before. It's something that starkware has been talking a lot about. And I've said in the past that I think that the terminology, like, I don't know, like I'm going to capitulate and just start using this terminology, the layer three terminology, because people are just like more and more using it. But like, we love to confuse people in crypto, that's for sure.
00:18:09.040 - 00:18:54.990, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, like, the mass adoption and end users aren't really going to care about terminology like this. They're not going to be talking about layer one, L2, layer three, layer four, whatever. They're just going to be like using the apps basically. Right? So I wouldn't worry too much about that. So, but if you do want to learn about what layer three is from one of the kind of like best Twitter accounts that I follow, sudo theos, which you should be following, by the way, definitely kind of like check out this, this Twitter thread for a kind of like a little breakdown here and then links to more information about this obviously mutable x being built with starkware technology is using this. Starcode has been pushing it. And really, I mean, from what I've read and from the people I respect as well, it really is a paradigm shift in blockchain scaling where layer three will still settle down to Ethereum layer one, but it goes through L2 to get down to layer one.
00:18:54.990 - 00:19:26.322, Speaker A: And it just gives us what I think people are calling fractal scaling, which I think pioneer had a thread about the other day. I mean, of course they had a thread about it, but you can go check out their kind of like Twitter feed for, um, for that thread. I don't have it handy right now. Uh, but yeah, I just wanted to kind of like highlight this thread from pseudotheos for you to go check out. All right, so another update from immutable today. They've launched metamask mobile app support on the immutable X protocol. So if you are using the immutable X kind of like protocol here, the L2 network, you can now use it with Metamask's mobile wallet app.
00:19:26.322 - 00:19:59.774, Speaker A: So if you're using the mobile wallet app or metamask, well then you can deposit, withdraw ETH and a bunch of other tokens, purchase and sell nfts, and manage your nfts. And you can try it now at this link, which of course I'll link in the YouTube description. I love seeing this. You know, we obviously need support from all wallets, mobile, desktop hardware, whatever it is, for these L2 networks, because that's the future of Ethereum, as you all well know. I don't have to, like, I'm preaching to the choir by saying that, but it is, and I'm just glad to see more kind of like updates coming out of the immutable ecosystem here. And they had a bunch of updates yesterday, there more today. They're really kind of like, I think, getting into their stride now.
00:19:59.774 - 00:20:34.054, Speaker A: I'm boarding up a bunch of kind of, I guess some, sorry, I'm boarding a bunch of teams doing a lot of business development behind the scenes, scaling more, right. Working with starkware to scale even a bit more with layer threes and stuff like that, doing the interoperability, interoperable liquidity for nfts. Like they're killing it. I think at the moment, I'm really excited for the, for the future of immutable here. I mean, I'm gonna, I should disclose that I'm an investor in immutable, but I'm an investor because I was bullish on the project. Right. I think a lot of people seem to think sometimes that people kind of, like, talk about their investments because they want to shield them or they only invested in something because.
00:20:34.054 - 00:20:47.674, Speaker A: Because they got access to it and they want to shill it. Like, and they're not really bullish on it. Like, no, guys, like, I'm bullish on it. Like, anything. Any project that I've kind of, like, invested in, I kind of, like, I'm definitely bullish on, right. Like, I invest in because I have a thesis on it. I want to see it kind of, like, grow.
00:20:47.674 - 00:21:08.034, Speaker A: I want to see it succeed. But I just disclosed for you guys because I just, what I do on the show, right. I always disclose my, these things here. So I just wanted to get that out there. But I mean, again, go check out this from immutable. I think it's a really cool little feature. All right, finally here we have some, I guess, dramatic news, or I guess, like, dramatic kind of, like, events happening right now.
00:21:08.034 - 00:21:43.220, Speaker A: So Layton here from pull together put out a tweet thread by. Started by saying, as some of you know, I'm currently being sued personally in a putative. Is that supposed to be punitive? Punitive, I don't know. Punitive class action lawsuit. I can't speak about it publicly because the litigation is ongoing, but I want to share some context and ask for your help. So essentially what the lawsuit is, is it's come from, I think, someone who is an ex staffer of Elizabeth Warren. They deposited, like, $10 into pull together or something, and now they've kind of, like, lobbied a lawsuit against Layton personally for pull together.
00:21:43.220 - 00:22:11.264, Speaker A: Now, obviously, Layton can't talk about the details of kind of, like, the case and everything like that. So we don't have many kind of, like, details to go on here. But I think if you read between the lines and kind of, like, get underneath it, you will realize that this isn't just a kind of, like, attack on pull together. This is an attack on all of Defi, because it's. It's a baseless lawsuit. Like, it makes no sense, especially to go after something like pull together, which is probably the least Degen. It's not even degen, like, defi protocol in existence.
00:22:11.264 - 00:22:34.242, Speaker A: And it's just ridiculous that, like, someone would go after them. But I think there's ulterior motives here. There's definitely kind of, like, an underscore of. Of the wider defi ecosystem here. Um, but the reason why this was brought up was also because Layton's raising funds by kind of like selling nfts in order to cover his legal expenses. They've already, I think, spent a considerable amount of money on this. I'm not sure exactly how much.
00:22:34.242 - 00:23:20.186, Speaker A: I don't know if the number was actually named and it's probably going to cost them a considerable amount more. I'm only learning this recently as well because I'm not familiar with the US legal system, but apparently anyone can sue anyone for any reason in the US, which I find incredibly bizarre and backwards. But it is what it is. And obviously kind of like legal help is not cheap, right. So I think it's going to run into the millions of dollars from, from what I can tell in terms of legal costs to, for Layden to advise, defend himself against this. And as I said, it's actually, you know, the thing is, even if you don't like pull together for whatever reason, I mean, like it's kind of weird if you don't like pull together even if you don't like Layden. I mean, I don't know the guy personally, but for whatever, like you, in my mind, you should still like mint an NFT or make a donation disclosure.
00:23:20.186 - 00:24:00.338, Speaker A: I minted an NFT, one of the 0.18 ones, but you should still do it to support his fight in order to protect defy more broadly. Because if this person was to win their case against pool together, it's just a very bad precedent and very bad kind of like kind of like future, I guess, like precedent for the rest of Defi. So we don't want Layton to lose this both, obviously. I don't want him to lose it because it's a personal kind of like lawsuit and kind of like I don't want him to be kind of like hurt by that, but also because of the kind of like wider implications for the Defi space. So anyway, I'm just gonna recommend, not recommend, but just like suggest. If you guys do want to donate, definitely go kind of like donate and mint an NFT or whatever.
00:24:00.338 - 00:24:27.732, Speaker A: And you can do that. But basically from kind of kind of like from there, other things you can do to support is kind of like retweet this, share this, talk about it, make sure that people know that this is a baseless, kind of like lawsuit from, from what you, from what we can tell. And it doesn't actually make much sense at all. Now, I don't know who's going to win here. I don't know if Layton's going to win. I don't know if this other person's going to win. But yeah, we definitely need to be defending ourselves against attacks like this because they're going to keep coming.
00:24:27.732 - 00:25:19.986, Speaker A: As I said, guys, like regulation is going to ramp up, especially in the wake of the terror collapse. It's coming like, I mean maybe we haven't heard much about over the last few weeks, but trust me guys, it's coming like it's, it's not like they're just going to let that kind of like slide and people aren't, and things aren't going to be regulated now. It's coming, unfortunately. But the best thing we can do is, I mean the first best thing we can do obviously, is build truly decentralized applications that can't be stopped. Now that won't protect against people getting kind of like getting sued personally, but it will protect the actual protocol. Second best thing we can do is basically prepare for these kinds of things, right. And kind of like come to terms with them, but also educate regulators and educate lawmakers and educate politicians to make sure that the regulation isn't too onerous or isn't too kind of like harsh or anything like that and actually make sense because whether you guys like it or not, doesn't matter what regulation it is.
00:25:19.986 - 00:26:15.266, Speaker A: It's coming like there is going to be some regulation of this industry. Now the places that they're going to regulate are, as I've mentioned in the, in the past, the, the kind of like the, as a paths of least resistance, stable coins, the fiat on ramps, you know, centralized exchanges generally they're all just going to kind of like get regulated to shit basically. Now there's good regulation in terms of kind of like stuff that doesn't hurt the industry. And by that, as much as I hate them, like Kyc AML, I think is really dangerous in its own right, but that sort of stuff doesn't hurt the wider industry, I don't think. Right. But what, what would hurt the wider industry is if exchanges were forced to not allow people to withdraw from the exchange to their own kind of like Ethereum address, for example. That would definitely hurt the industry in a really, really big way and would be very, very bearish, at least in the short to medium term for anything got to do with on chain stuff, especially if that kind of regulation came from a country like the US.
00:26:15.266 - 00:26:45.524, Speaker A: So we don't want that happening. But these other sorts of things like maybe, you know, requiring exchanges to report more stuff, blah, blah, I mean that's already happening. Maybe they just make it stricter whatever. Like you, you kind of like understand these things. Once you use a centralized exchange that this is all happening. And that's, as I said, that doesn't affect really the broader, I like bull case for crypto because centralized exchanges have always been regulated like this. But something like banning, you know, or I guess like clamping down on stable coins so that only whitelisted addresses can use stable coins on chain, that, again, would hurt the ecosystem.
00:26:45.524 - 00:27:16.776, Speaker A: So we have to be mindful of that. We have to kind of like fight against that sort of stuff. But in general, there's just, you're naive to think that there's not going to be regulations there for sure is just need to make sure that they aren't too onerous or harsh on the wider ecosystem there. But it definitely goes support Layton, if you want to, I'll link this in the YouTube description below. I got a couple minutes left here. There was one thing from the market talk that I didn't touch on, that I just wanted to quickly touch on here. Guys, I've seen some of you talk about leverage in, in the Discord channel again, look, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money.
00:27:16.776 - 00:27:38.354, Speaker A: I'm not going to give you investment advice, but please understand what you're doing when you get on leverage. Like, I don't know, like maybe I, maybe I warn about this too much. Maybe I just sound like kind of like angry parent. Not an angry parent, but like an overly concerned parent at this, at this point. Right. I have seen too many people blow themselves up and then spiral into a depression. I don't want that happening to you guys.
00:27:38.354 - 00:28:00.842, Speaker A: Do what you want with your money. Not investment advice, just general kind of advice of be careful with leverage, especially in markets like this, where no one knows where it's gonna go. No one knows if it's the bottom. No one knows if we're gonna bounce from here. You know, no one knows. It's actually like, like, if you're gonna use leverage, like, this would probably be one of the worst times to use it. And I don't think there's any good time to use leverage, really.
00:28:00.842 - 00:28:22.730, Speaker A: But like, this is probably be like one of the worst, in my opinion. But again, like non investment advice, guys, please don't take it as that. Just take it as general. Be careful. Like, it's super risky. You can blow yourself up. And the worst thing, as I've said plenty of times, the worst thing in investing in crypt, especially in crypto, is blowing yourself up and then having to sit on the sidelines while everything just pumps and gets ahead of you.
00:28:22.730 - 00:28:40.336, Speaker A: Especially if you've been in it for a while, for years and you just destroy your position before a new bull market starts. I've seen this happen to multiple people. It's not good. Anyway, I'm going to end it on that for today, so thank everyone for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give the video a thumbs up. Subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord Channel, and I'll catch you all next week.
00:28:40.336 - 00:28:41.904, Speaker A: Thanks everyone. Bye.
