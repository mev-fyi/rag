00:00:00.840 - 00:00:29.518, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Dailyguay refuel. I'm your host, Anthony Susano. And today is the 30 November 2020. So for today's episode, we'll be going through the events of the weekend and also the events from Friday as well. So let's get into it. So as we can see over the, I guess the weekend, we had some really, really positive kind of like price appreciation with ETH and a bunch of other cryptos after that, that brutal dump we saw last week. Right.
00:00:29.518 - 00:00:59.424, Speaker A: We ETH touched about, I think it was 490, probably lower than that. Yeah. If we scroll out here, you can see that ETH went down to about $480. Kind of bounced off that, and then kind of retested the lows over here with 490. And then since then, we've just kind of done, you know, this march back up, and it's pretty cool to see because we, we fell from about dollar 620 down to what it is here. And we're almost back up there. We got $586 at time of recording.
00:00:59.424 - 00:01:23.830, Speaker A: Hopefully it's higher by the time, you know, you guys see this video. But yet I think this is really strong. You know, you really only see these kind of bounces during a bull market. You know, if this was a classical thing where, you know, it was a bear market and then you had like this, this kind of dump, and then you had a bounce, it wouldn't continue. It would actually just like, kind of like a pebble on water. It would just like, keep going, keep going down. Right.
00:01:23.830 - 00:01:47.902, Speaker A: And you just bleed out over time to find a bottom. And that's what bear markets usually are. But, yeah, we haven't seen that this time where we're just seeing so much strength. And, you know, obviously, I mean, it's pretty easy to say now that the bull market's back. We're just in the early stages here. So that's what's, you know, that's what's being signaled to me from the markets as well. And, you know, on top of that, I think December is going to be a really healthy month for Ethereum.
00:01:47.902 - 00:02:01.866, Speaker A: Right. We have ETH two going live tomorrow, basically. ETH two, phase zero, the beacon chain, genesis happening tomorrow. That's a huge catalyst. Right. We've, we've had more ETH flood into the deposit contract. It's over 800,000 the last time I checked.
00:02:01.866 - 00:02:47.988, Speaker A: You know, we have DeFi growing still. We have such a strong narrative around Ethereum going into 2021 that I think, yeah, December is going to be a big month. And then during 2021, it's just going to be, you know, even even bigger, I think, you know, and not just for Ethereum, I guess, for crypto in general. I mean, we can't ignore the fact that bitcoin is quite bullish as well, right? I mean, these charts are pretty similar, right? You can see it there. Bitcoin has, as people like to say, the macro narrative behind it, which I agree with. But I always say that once you're in crypto, it's all about Ethereum, right? Everything interesting is happening on Ethereum. So you might buy bitcoin and just hold it and whatever, but if you actually come into the ecosystem and see what's happening outside of bitcoin, then you're going to see what's happening in Ethereum and within defi specifically.
00:02:47.988 - 00:03:14.792, Speaker A: And speaking of DeFi, we have the DeFi pulse index here. I think I need to adjust the chart here for a sec. Yeah, I mean, it also went to some lows. I think there's like a bug in the chart here. But, you know, it's bouncing as well. I think DeFi hasn't bounced as much because kind of ETH still moving. So the way I look at it is that, you know, if ETH stops moving so much and goes kind of sideways for a little bit, probably see DeFi recover from, from that and have some outperformance too.
00:03:14.792 - 00:04:06.894, Speaker A: At the end of the day, it's all cycles in these markets. So I definitely think that we're currently in the BTC ETH cycle with ETH, you know, more, more primed for like more dominance, and then it'll move to Defi. And, you know, we also saw a bunch of the other kind of like large cap coins, like ripple and stellar kind of pump last week. But that's, that's fleeting, I think. You know, I actually think it was like a bunch of traders in Wales kind of front running and being like, oh, you know, all this new retail is going to come in, these retail investors are going to come in and what are they going to buy? Oh, we think they're going to buy, you know, XRP and things like that. So I think that's what we saw last week, but, yeah, interesting to keep an eye on that. So we spoke about the plus token kind of Ponzi last week and how there was some news that came out around it, basically that the government had, the chinese government had seized all this crypto.
00:04:06.894 - 00:04:41.624, Speaker A: You know, it was about a huge amount of BTC, was 1% of all BTC. It was about 0.7% of all ETH and things like that. And then David, David Puhl here, he's an on chain analyst for bitcoin specifically, he basically has this thread here that says that the news is just. The news is about six months old, and a lot of this selling and, sorry, a lot of the crypto that was seized has already been sold. Specifically, the bitcoin has already been sold. You know, there's not going to be this massive amount of bitcoin coming onto the market, as was speculated last week.
00:04:41.624 - 00:05:02.804, Speaker A: So, yeah, he has this thread here. I'll link it in, the show notes and everything for you to go check it out. But basically it runs through, you know, where these coins moved from. You know, a lot of them went to Huobi, the korean based exchange. I think it's based in Korea. Anyway, one of the asian exchanges for sure. And the sell off, you know, he stipulates, started in the middle of 2019.
00:05:02.804 - 00:05:27.948, Speaker A: So you know how last week I told you that a lot of people thought that the reason why Ethan BTC ran up during 2019, at least like, during Q two, was because of this plus token Ponzi. And then, of course, it wasn't sustained buying or anything like that. So when they started selling and when they, you know, when the plus token Ponzi kind of shut down and was. And the. The operators were caught, the buying pressure kind of, like, evaporated. And that's why we saw that pretty brutal drawdown after that. And.
00:05:27.948 - 00:05:47.670, Speaker A: And everyone's kind of hopes were, like, shattered. Right? It's like, leading up to it, everyone was like, oh, wow, is the bull market back already? And. No, that way. That definitely wasn't the case at the time. So, yeah, I'll link this thread in the show notes and the YouTube description. You can go check it out and read in some more detail here. So Andre, put out this sneak peek.
00:05:47.670 - 00:06:10.498, Speaker A: Yes, sorry. A couple of days ago, of the core lending money markets integrated into yearn. This is pretty interesting, I think. I mean, yearn had a couple more acquisitions slash mergers, you know, slash partnerships over the weekend happen as well. They did one with. With COVID protocol, which is an insurance protocol. They did it with cream, which I spoke about, obviously, last week.
00:06:10.498 - 00:06:29.890, Speaker A: And cream is a money market. Right. So I think what they're doing is they're trying to get the talent from these projects to help them with what they want to do within the yearn ecosystem, which has basically become more than just yield farming. Right. They want to do yield farming. They want to do money markets. They want to do insurance, you know, it seems like they want to do things with options as well.
00:06:29.890 - 00:07:11.994, Speaker A: So the yearn ecosystem is definitely growing. And I'm a bit confused though, like, where the value is going to flow to because a lot of these projects that they're absorbing still have their token. Right? As I said last week, Cream still has its token, pickle stars, its token cover still has its token, and of course, yearn has its own token called Wifi or wifey or whatever you want to call it. So is the value going to flow to that? Right? Are these other tokens just going to bleed out because there's no love put on them? Because the yearn ecosystem is basically all about that wifi token. I'm not sure. Don't know what's happening here. Actually, Andre put out a blog post that I don't have up here, so if I go to his profile, I might be able to find it here.
00:07:11.994 - 00:07:50.144, Speaker A: Unless he didn't share it on here. There's a blog post on his medium about it when he goes through. Actually, let me bring it up here so you guys can see. He basically, I think, you know, he saw that people were confused about what the terms merger and acquisition means. So here it is, basically. So this blog post, what it does is he goes through and defines the nomenclature that he's been using. And he's like, he asked the question, like, what? What does this actually mean? Right? So he defines them and then he goes on to basically say, what does this mean in the crypto context? And he finishes the piece by saying that he doesn't really have an answer for this.
00:07:50.144 - 00:08:14.934, Speaker A: And I mean, I agree with that. But at the same time, if. Maybe if you don't have the answer, don't call him like a merger, acquisition or partnership or whatever. I think collaboration is the better term here for what they've been doing, because as I mentioned last week, these projects still have their tokens. So it's not an acquisition, it's not really a merger, not really a partnership. Right. It's like a collaboration between these teams.
00:08:14.934 - 00:08:41.974, Speaker A: But, you know, on top of that, these teams have actually been absorbed as well. So, you know, maybe there's another term that you can use, but I think it's very important to, to define these things. And I'm glad Andre posted this because a lot of people were confused. You know, these terms have very specific meanings, right? But when you, when you kind of, like, put them in an open source world or in a crypto native world, it kind of like, blurs the lines. Right. And you need to. You need to define these things.
00:08:41.974 - 00:08:58.798, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'll include this in the show notes. Of course, you can go give it a read there as well. All right. We had an ETH two quick update from Danny Ryan over the weekend. This was a super quick update. Basically just reminding people that the ETH two genesis is happening on December 1. Be sure to set up your nodes.
00:08:58.798 - 00:09:22.866, Speaker A: I have my little guy right over here on this other. On my other pc over here, all ready to go. It's exciting, right? We're finally here, like, tomorrow, basically, we're gonna have the Genesis go live at 12:00 p.m.. UTC. I'm not sure what that is in whatever time zone you're in, but I know what time it is. In my time zone, it's about 11:00 p.m. Australian time or eastern australian time.
00:09:22.866 - 00:09:38.074, Speaker A: So actually, not bad for me. Usually I expect these things to go live during, when I'm sleeping, like, to 03:00 a.m. But this time, actually, in the US, I do know what time it is in Pacific time. It's. I think it's 04:00 a.m. Pacific time. So in the, in the US, it's definitely screwing.
00:09:38.074 - 00:09:57.762, Speaker A: Screwing some people there, but that's. That's the time that it's going live. And honestly, you know, waking up, you know, in the middle of the night or staying up to witness this kind of historic event is so worth it. I mean, even if it was 02:00 a.m. 03:00 a.m. For me, I would have definitely stayed up for it. So, yeah, if you haven't done it yet, I implore you to.
00:09:57.762 - 00:10:32.264, Speaker A: And you have, like, Ethan, the deposit contract. Please, please, please set up your validator, like, now we should, you know, the earlier the better, because you don't want to get, you know, run into problems and then have to try and ask people when. When, you know, all this craziness is happening, especially leading up to the launch and, you know, immediately after the launch. So definitely go set it up now. That's why I did mine earlier, of course. And, you know, I think the biggest risk is that the ETH two beacon chain doesn't start because not enough people have booted up their validators. I don't think that's gonna happen, you know, because you'll lose money if you.
00:10:32.264 - 00:10:50.728, Speaker A: If you don't do it. It's not like the test nets where there was nothing at stake. So I think that we'll definitely launch at the. At the time that we're gonna. We've set for Genesis. But, yeah, always good as a staker to be prepared for this stuff. All right, so there was a post here from.
00:10:50.728 - 00:11:03.158, Speaker A: From dankred, feist. I think I said his name right here. Um, about your. Your validator. So keeping your validators, uh, sorry, your nodes. Time while in sync is. Is critical here.
00:11:03.158 - 00:11:28.972, Speaker A: So for those who. Who may be aware on the medalla testnet or the Medasha testnet, there was a critical bug in the prism client where the clocks weren't in sync. So the network just basically, you know, the validator, like a mass kind of. A lot of validators dropped off the network. I think it was like 70% of the network dropped off because they were. They were all running prism. So you really want to make sure that your time is synced correctly.
00:11:28.972 - 00:11:57.230, Speaker A: And he goes through here about, like, attack vectors and things like that. This is all the technical stuff. But in general, make sure that your time on your kind of, like, the hardware that you're running this stuff on is correct, so it's in sync. I. You know, I think there's a. There's a few kind of, like, things here. If you're running Ubuntu and, like, how to do it and how to set it and everything with windows, and I'm fairly certain you can just go to the calendar and time settings and kind of set it there.
00:11:57.230 - 00:12:28.764, Speaker A: So. Yeah, just one thing to keep in mind if you're running a validator. All right, so I put this tweet out over the weekend. I was looking at one of my favorite dashboards from doing analytics here. Decentralized exchange dashboard. Basically, you know, it shows you the health of decentralized exchanges over the last kind of, like 24 hours, seven days, 30 days, and even further than that, if you scroll down here. Now, what this chart shows is basically the growth of decentralized exchanges each month since January 2019.
00:12:28.764 - 00:12:51.304, Speaker A: And as you can see, or for those of you listening in and not watching, the. I mean, the explosion happened in 2020, basically, around DeFi summer. So we had. It was kind of. Kind of flat for 2019. It was growing, but it was kind of flat. Right? And then we had this kind of explosion when the compound liquidity mining launch, because then we went into defi summer, and we've.
00:12:51.304 - 00:13:19.980, Speaker A: And we've just been, you know, we grew a lot. We peaked, and then it's been coming down a bit, but the volume is still much higher than it was before that. Right. So for November, it was about $15 billion. And then if we actually do a, do a calculation, we can say that there's been almost $90 billion worth of trading volume has happened across decentralized exchanges on Ethereum over the last twelve months. Just the last twelve months and not the beginning of this chart or anything. And most of it happened during defy summer, of course.
00:13:19.980 - 00:14:00.144, Speaker A: But that's, that's crazy, right? $90 billion on Ethereum on decentralized exchanges with the majority happening on Uniswap and curve, the stable coin exchange and sushi swaps there as well as a big player too. So. And there's a bunch of others here, like colors, I guess they're a bit hard to see. But yeah, I mean uniswap dominates, right? As you can see for those who can't say uniswap is, but basically half of the, half of the volume, if not more here. So yeah, I mean that's, that's insane. And we all saw the reports of Uniswap doing more volume some days than like Coinbase, for example. And you know, it's always good to take stock here as well.
00:14:00.144 - 00:14:51.476, Speaker A: And to think about the fact that, you know, Ethereum is still expensive to use at layer one and still kind of like, doesn't scale very well and yet this volume is, this kind of, is kind of happening within Defi should. So it just shows the, the intense kind of like usage of these protocols regardless of cost or speed or whatever. People want to do this. People want to play in Defi, they want to trade on decentralized exchanges, you know, even if it costs a little bit more because you get all the other benefits, right? No KYC, no AML, you get, you don't have to, you know, you can remain pseudo anonymous. You can also not have to deal with centralized exchange risk in general self custody of assets. There's so many benefits, right. And it's just this chart to me shows that and it shows as well that the incentive mechanisms that teams are using, like liquidity mining, work very well.
00:14:51.476 - 00:15:23.528, Speaker A: So it remains to be seen, you know, in the future how this growth continues. But it's also worth keeping in mind this, this only tracks, I think this only tracks layer one. I mean it's got loop ring there. So I'm not sure if it tracks L2 as well. But I think going over the next year as we get more L2 protocols live, we're going to see more of an explosion there as well. Speaking of metrics, within DeFi, Token Terminal released their new, the new version of Token Terminal this week. I really like this site.
00:15:23.528 - 00:15:54.960, Speaker A: So what token terminal is trying to do is it's trying to bring kind of traditional metrics from the real world into defi. So things like PE, so PE P's volume to market cap and then obviously the crypto native things like TVL. But then they're trying to generate things like revenue. For those listening in, I'm just showing it on the screen here on the Token terminal website. So if you want to check it out, it's at terminal dot tokenterminal.com. But yeah, this is super cool. There's so many metrics here that you can look at.
00:15:54.960 - 00:16:37.630, Speaker A: I mean you can actually base your investment decisions on this, right? If you have a project that you're interested in, let's say Zero X, click here and then you can see all of Zero X's metrics over time and how healthy they are. So you can see here kind of like the market cap and kind of like the defi average and how it's performing against DeFi. You can see kind of like the price to sales ratio here if that's growing or not, the revenue as calculated by token terminal here. So if you see that going up, right, maybe you want to buy the token to get exposure to this. And it's not just defi either. They've also got like some other chains here. They have like decred and I think bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum of course here.
00:16:37.630 - 00:17:11.338, Speaker A: And then they have like an insight section too where you can basically subscribe to their newsletter, which I highly recommend you do because they basically run through how to read these things, right. And how to interpret them. So really cool. From token terminal. I mean I personally use it. I think as more of the traditional players come into this ecosystem from traditional finance, they're going to want these things to evaluate these tokens. Know, they're not just like, like us that like quote unquote ape into things, right? They, they definitely take their time to research and do things.
00:17:11.338 - 00:17:59.340, Speaker A: So I think that's where we should move towards. I don't think we should just be, you know, blind speculating on these things because that's how you end up with, you know, 90% drawdowns on these tokens. A quick update from Yam over the weekend as well. So Yam's a project that I think, I mean it's gotten a lot of hate, but they've, they've just been, been building like crazy still, right? You know last week they, they came out with the, a new project called the Umbrella Protocol, which is basically like an insurance slash kind of coverage project similar to Nexus mutual and cover and things like that. And then you know, apart from that they've been building a bunch of other different things. So this, this roadmap update gives kind of an update on what they've been up to. So on the protocol level, they've been doing some, some, I guess like with the treasury.
00:17:59.340 - 00:18:53.384, Speaker A: They've been basically acquiring assets for the treasury. So you can see here that they purchased $250,000 worth of ETH and $250,000 with the Defi pulse index to, to farm the index token with it. So for those who don't know, you can actually farm the index token, which is part of the index co op, by providing liquidity on Uniswap to the ETH DPI pair. And that's what they did with their treasury, which is really cool because the yam token holders got to vote on whether they wanted to do this or not. They've also been doing a bit of sushi things as well, a bit of sushi farming on the product side. They, they've got umbrella protocol nearing the testing phase, as I mentioned before, a few governance updates, you know, and I think these are the kind of like, I mean in progress kind of like proposals for yam as well. So yeah, go give this, sorry, go give this a read.
00:18:53.384 - 00:19:19.604, Speaker A: I'll link it in the show notes, of course. And yeah, I just think that what Yammy's doing is really, really cool in general. I mean I don't hold any yam tokens or anything like that. And it is a very risky token to hold because it's a rebase token. And what that means is that it's extremely reflexive up and down. So it can go up really high and then it can go down really high, you know, depending on how many people are buying in or selling, of course. But it's, it's more pronounced than a typical token.
00:19:19.604 - 00:19:58.938, Speaker A: I won't go into it now, but for those who know what rebase tokens are, you'll, you'll be familiar with that too. So yeah, I definitely suggest like you don't have to buy the token to be involved with this project. I think what they're doing is really cool. You know, they're giving their treasury funds to get coin as well, to donate to grants and things like that. So I just think of yam as like a neat little ethereum aligned ecosystem rather than something to speculate on. And that's not to say that you can't if you, if you want to, you know, the treasury comes from the speculation. So for those who don't know the treasury, the, the money that goes into the treasury comes from a portion of the rebase.
00:19:58.938 - 00:20:32.522, Speaker A: So you know, without people speculating on the token, there wouldn't really be much of a treasury. But in saying that what they're doing with the treasury is they're trying to increase the value of it without that as well. So that's what they're doing with the, with the index farming too, right. And then sushi farming and things like that, which I think is really cool. So active treasury management is definitely something that I would look at going forward, especially into 2021. I think a lot more projects going to be doing this because they need to set up Dallas for this sort of stuff to, you know, one, to avoid regulatory kind of scrutiny and two, to let their token holders vote on this. Right.
00:20:32.522 - 00:21:14.194, Speaker A: And to encourage people to hold the token as well. All right, we, I mentioned this last week as well, but last week the, the total Ethereum nodes hadn't flipped the total bitcoin nodes yet, but this week they have. So total Ethereum nodes is over, over 11,000. Total bitcoin nodes is about 11,000. And this is I think one of the first times this has happened. I don't know, I don't know if it's happened in the past, but I don't remember it in recent kind of history it happening. But this is huge, right? And as I mentioned last week, this is obviously due to people having to set up an ETH one node without having to, but being encouraged to set up an ETH one node when they're doing their ETH two staking.
00:21:14.194 - 00:21:35.806, Speaker A: So that's why I've seen an explosion here. I think just a few weeks ago it was 8000 nodes or something. So we've had over 3000 nodes join, which makes sense. And I mean, if you look at unique depositors, it's at about 3000. You know, it's not a one to one mapping there because some unique depositors are actually not unique. But it's always good to see more ethereum nodes coming online. Ethereum full nodes.
00:21:35.806 - 00:22:00.642, Speaker A: We need to stop relying so much on infuria and things like that. We need people to run their own nodes and be self sovereign. You know, my east to validate is connected to my open Ethereum node. You know, as I discussed last week, you want to make sure that you're running a minority ETH one node as well. So like open Ethereum, nevermind Besu not geth not. Nothing against Geth as a client, but, you know, you want to support the decentralization of the clients as well. So.
00:22:00.642 - 00:22:35.376, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. Really cool to see this start. A little bit of a drama that I kind of, like, tweeted about. I think I should give some context around this tweet for people that saw it. So I basically said, belittling six years worth of work by arguing over semantics is a new low for CT, for crypto Twitter. And, you know, this, this stemmed from. I was scrolling, I woke up this morning and I was scrolling through my Twitter feed and I'm like, why are people arguing about, is ETH two launching or not? Like, what is this? And it goes back to ETH two, you know, phase zero, the beacon chain launching tomorrow is not the full ETH two suite.
00:22:35.376 - 00:23:13.242, Speaker A: Right? It is a staking chain. It is. There's no sharding, there's no smart contracts, there's none of that. You can't even, you know, know, move your ETH, right? You can't do any, anything like that. And people have taken this and being like, oh, well, if you can't do anything with it, then is ETH two really launching? And it's just like such a silly thing to argue about. And it's so semantic based that I don't even want to entertain this argument, but for the sake of kind of educating everyone listening in or watching, watching this, this, this recap here, basically, I don't think it's right to say that ETH two isn't launching tomorrow, right? That, you know, it's not the full e two suite. And anyone in Ethereum knows that.
00:23:13.242 - 00:23:56.726, Speaker A: And it's very easy to, to Google, you know, east to roadmap and see that the ethereum.org website does not state that what's going live on December 1 is the full ETH two suite. No one in Ethereum will state that, right? You know, there might be some people out there saying ETH two is going live. And, and people might look at that and be like, well, no, technically it's not ETH two going live. It's phase zero and beacon chain and all that, but semantics, right? I just, I just, I don't like these semantic arguments. They are, they are such a distraction. And as I said, they also belittle the work that the teams have put in over the years, six years worth of work from the researchers and the client implementers to get to this point where we finally launch this thing, a novel proof of stake consensus mechanism that if it works.
00:23:56.726 - 00:24:26.706, Speaker A: Will be the most decentralized consensus mechanism on the planet, basically. And you know, in kind of like the terminal state will be more decentralized than bitcoin then bitcoin's proof of work consensus mechanism. So that is a huge achievement in of itself. And I think that it's fine to say ETH two is launching on December 1. As long as, you know, if you're talking to maybe a new person to a theorem, you caveat it. We say, you know, it's the first phase of ETH two, but that doesn't make mean. It's kind of like belittled.
00:24:26.706 - 00:24:53.294, Speaker A: And it's a huge milestone. You know, it's as big as, as each, I mean each milestone is huge, right? Getting phase one in with sharding and then doing the merger and things like that. So it's not right to say that. It's just, you know, this proof of stake chain doesn't really mean anything. That just is not right. And, you know, I'll fight back against that as much as I can, but in general, I don't want to entertain these arguments too much. You know, I'll just put out like a snide comment here and there.
00:24:53.294 - 00:25:12.190, Speaker A: I just think it's, it's just, you know, it's quite pointless to harp on about this. And it's also confusing to new users. Right. If you're trying to avoid confusing new people, then you're not, by arguing semantics. Right. You're just, you're contributing to that confusion. So I was really sad to see that.
00:25:12.190 - 00:25:42.192, Speaker A: But in general, it's like it, that doesn't, that doesn't, doesn't really matter. Everyone's still really excited. People don't really care about these semantic arguments. You know, who, whoever wants to be at the forefront of this thing and actually be on the right side of this thing knows what this is and what it, you know, what it, what it means and what it shows that the, that, you know, the clients and developers, client developers and researchers have done over the years. So, yeah, just a little note on that. I probably won't bring it up again because it's such a silly argument. Really cool.
00:25:42.192 - 00:26:15.264, Speaker A: Out of chain link as well over the weekend. So they're going to be participating in Gitcoin grants round eight as a kind of like a matching provider. So they're going to basically put up a bunch of funds to become a matching partner. For those who don't know, you know, these bitcoin grant rounds basically are based on what's called quadratic funding. A bunch of organizations will put up a bunch of money. Last round I think it was like half a million dollars or something like that. I think this round they want to go for a million dollars and this will get spread out to their grants on Gitcoin based on individual donations.
00:26:15.264 - 00:26:45.766, Speaker A: And you know, the more individual donors you have and the more smaller donors you have to your grant, the more matching you get. And that comes from these partners basically. So yeah, this is going to be huge. This is going live this week as well. I think the second or the 4 December or something like that, the round eight goes live. I can't remember the exact date, but perfect timing, right? Straight after the ETH two genesis event happens and a lot of great projects are going to be, going to be in need of funding as well. So I'll talk about this more once it goes live and everything like that.
00:26:45.766 - 00:27:22.542, Speaker A: I definitely want everyone, you know, listening to this to participate if they can donate to a few projects that they like and everything like that. So yeah, I'll cover it more in a future refuel episode probably later this week. Another really positive thing coming out. I guess this is more of a long term thing over the next two years. But I basically put this tweet out that said ethereums get to celebrate so many major milestones with ETH two, right? So we saw last week that we all got to celebrate the deposit contract, minimum ETH required being reached. That was a huge celebration, right? You saw it on Twitter, everyone was talking about it. Everyone was super excited.
00:27:22.542 - 00:27:54.002, Speaker A: People who were like, I would never reach the minimum were just like, wow, this is like an impressive showing of support from the Ethereum community for this new, new thing that we're launching. So we've already achieved that. Right. Next up is the beacon chain, Genesis. We're achieving that tomorrow. You know, I mean there's a, there's a small chance maybe it doesn't go live for whatever reason, but you know, it's, it's, it's pretty much 100% that we're going to go live with that. Sharding implemented is coming, you know, hopefully next year, if not 2020, like early 2022 EIP 1559 on both ETH one and ETH two.
00:27:54.002 - 00:28:27.652, Speaker A: So the, the EIP to basically improve the fee market and to introduce burning on ETH on, on the ETH fees being paid. That's, you know, I don't want to give any dates here, but maybe end of 2021, early 2022 ETH one to ETH two merger, same kind of deal. There that's. That's huge, right. In of itself, I think that's self explanatory. That's probably going to go live end of 2021, early 2022, we hope, right? I'd actually say 2022 for the merger, to be honest. That's a very complicated thing.
00:28:27.652 - 00:28:50.590, Speaker A: And you want that to go right? You. You can't screw that up. And then the final thing was rich sharding. So this might be confusing to some people, but what I mean by this is that the shards going live as part of, like, the first phase of phase one aren't rich shards. Right. They're data shards. So they can't actually do kind of smart contracts or state execution or anything like that.
00:28:50.590 - 00:29:29.270, Speaker A: What they can do is they can host data, which can be used at L2 to do these things. So, yeah, rich sharding is basically introducing that, which is commonly referred to as phase two, which is execution on the shards and smart contracts and things like that. That's still very much an open research kind of thing, and it'll probably evolve over the years. I wouldn't expect that until maybe late 2022. Early 2023. But we don't need that for ETH two to basically be a full kind of, like, on, you know, parity with ETH one. I think that's going to happen either late next year or early 2022 with sharding and the merger and these L2 technologies going, going live.
00:29:29.270 - 00:29:58.984, Speaker A: So lots to be excited about there, for sure. All right, last thing before you wrap it up for today. So there's going to be a Genesis live stream party put together by ETH hub. So myself and Eric Connor bankless, David Hoffman and Ryan, Sean Adams and Defi dad, as you, as a lot of you would probably know him from. From Zappa and also from his own YouTube channel, where he explains a lot of defi things. So, yeah, this live stream is gonna go a lot. Gonna start at 06:30 a.m.
00:29:58.984 - 00:30:16.248, Speaker A: Eastern time, eastern standard Time in the US. And that's about half an hour, I think, before the genesis is slotted to go live. So the links will be on Twitter for that. Definitely keep an eye out. We'd love you to join us. There'll be a chat on the YouTube stream and everything like that. So you can.
00:30:16.248 - 00:30:31.946, Speaker A: You can talk to us in there and, yeah, let's watch this thing go live. This. I think there's gonna be more than just obviously, our genesis stream. Like, eight hubs. One, there's going to be. I think ETH staker is doing it. I think there's going to be an official one from like the Ethereum official, quote unquote official from like the Ethereum Foundation.
00:30:31.946 - 00:31:03.952, Speaker A: I think there's going to be a few of them around. Right. But we'd love for you to join our one. If you want to watch multiple, you can, you just have to have like a bunch of monitors or, you know, one big monitor and put them everywhere so you can try that as well. But yeah, definitely. I mean, this is going to be huge, right? The next refuel tomorrow will probably come out just before the, the chain goes live, and then the one after that will be when I kind of do my recap on everything that's happened there. So an exciting two, three days week for Ethereum, as I said, Gitcoin grants matching round eight going live as well this week.
00:31:03.952 - 00:31:50.764, Speaker A: I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of other things happening, as there always is in the Ethereum ecosystem. So yeah, keep an eye out and if you want to keep updated with it, you maybe don't have the time, maybe too many real life commitments and you don't live in Ethereum like I do. You can, you know, subscribe to the YouTube channel, subscribe to the Daily Gwei newsletter, you know, follow us on, on Twitter, join the discord, all that good stuff to keep up to date with everything that I'm doing at the Daily Gwei, and, you know, keep up to date with ethub as well. We also have a weekly newsletter that goes out with ETH Hub that covers Ethereum, and we also have a weekly podcast where Eric and I talk through, kind of like recapping the previous week. So always good to get Eric's perspective on things. I really, you know, I really think highly of his opinions on things. He's got some great context there.
00:31:50.764 - 00:32:05.484, Speaker A: So different to what I do with the daily, the daily refuels. So, yeah, that's it for today, I think. Everyone, thank you for watching, listening, wherever you are. I hope you have a great week and I'll catch you for tomorrow's episode. Thanks everyone.
