00:00:00.440 - 00:00:36.170, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gui refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Susano, and today's the 26 February 2021. Alright everyone, let's get into the news from the last 24 hours. So bit of price action, a bit, I guess, depressing price action over the last kind of, I guess, couple of days now, right? You can see on the chart here that we've just been trending down and, you know, we seem to be struggling to get back up. You know, this is the hour chart. We visited the 13 hundreds the other day and, you know, we seem to have bottomed at about 1400 again, I think a few hours ago, a few hours ago before bouncing off. Now.
00:00:36.170 - 00:01:26.386, Speaker A: Now I didn't want to talk about the price. I also wanted to talk about like the outlook of what's going on right now and why, you know, the price is the way it is and like basically give my opinion on the current state of the market. Now, you guys know that, like, I'm always bullish and perma bullish. So, you know, I'm not going to say that I'm not bullish because I always am. But, but I think what's important to consider here is that the markets in the short term can go, you know, any number of ways for any number of reasons. Now you might have seen on Twitter people talking about the macro environment right now, the macro economic environment where ten year treasury bond yields are up and, you know, the tech stocks are down and just, you know, the stock market in general is not, not too hot right now. Now that has an onflow to crypto because crypto is becoming kind of an asset class that is being traded kind of, I guess, in, in line with the rest of the markets, right? Yes.
00:01:26.386 - 00:01:53.746, Speaker A: Over the longer term, they may be uncorrelated. They may, you know, they'll outperform those markets because just, that's just how crypto is. But during downturns, you know, market wide downturns, especially when the macro environment looks kind of like bearish for, for risk on assets, they're going to kind of be correlated here. And I think that's what we've seen here. You know, I see some people saying, you know, it's a market cycle top, you know, we're going back down to a bear market. I don't get that. I don't get why people are saying that.
00:01:53.746 - 00:02:23.078, Speaker A: Like, it doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't fit in with any of the precedents of the previous kind of crypto cycles. And I just don't have a reason to be bearish right now. I mean, and this is what I mean by wanting to kind of give some context around this. If you look at the wider kind of developments, specifically within Ethereum that are coming over the next few months, there really is no reason to be bearish. Like if we just look at next month, you know, March, look at everything going live in terms of scaling, we have optimism going live, which is huge. I spoke about that yesterday, right.
00:02:23.078 - 00:02:52.478, Speaker A: There are other scaling technologies that I know going live as well that have been teasing themselves. Right. You know, and then as we, we've got, like in April, we've got the Berlin network upgrade going live for Ethereum. Then we have the London network upgrade going live probably July or August or something like that, which is going to include, well, maybe, I mean, most likely going to include AIP 1559, right? Which, which is, again, is very bullish. We have institutional adoption increasing. Right. And still coming in.
00:02:52.478 - 00:03:33.436, Speaker A: We have obviously, staking services like Coinbase coming online for ETH staking. So people will be able to get much easier exposure, which is going to lock up more ETH. So there's all these bullish catalysts coming, right? And I'm not even, I haven't even mentioned like all the things coming to all the different apps, right? All the upgrades to the different apps and things like that that are just going to add more fundamental value to Ethereum, all the new apps coming out, all this sort of stuff. So, you know, in terms of like, the fundamentals for Ethereum specifically, they have never been stronger, ever. Right. And, you know, for that reason alone, I'm bullish. But also I think that in the short term, yeah, okay, the macroeconomic environment is a bit bearish right now, but you got to look at the long term always.
00:03:33.436 - 00:04:26.686, Speaker A: Like, I just, I don't like looking at short term moves because you can't really infer much from it. I mean, I wrote about it, about it in the Daily GwEi newsletter the other day where I said that the short term belongs to traders and speculators, right. Because they are the ones, you know, providing, I guess, like the day to day moves and trading, trading against them, trading against the trend or with the trend or whatever. But the long term belongs to the investors, right? They are the ones who come in, buy up supply, take supply off the market by, by buying and holding and really putting pressure on the price upwards. Right, over the long term. So I mean, if you even just look at the one week chart for ETH here, right? You can, you'll see, like, we came out of the bear market, you know, the long, long bear market here right after the really bullish kind of bull market last time where, you know, ETH went from like $10 at the beginning of 2017 to a top, top of about 1400. Right? We all know this story.
00:04:26.686 - 00:05:12.362, Speaker A: I don't have to kind of rehash what happened with the price. But if you look at the trend here and you just zoom out, like, it's still pretty bullish, right? And, you know, I see people looking at this and, and they look at this red candle here, this weekly red candle, and they look over here and they, and they kind of say, oh, you know, it's a cycle top, right? We're going back into a bear market. But, you know, I hate it when I see that because it's like, well, I mean, this weekly candle can be, can be here, right? Or it can be here or it can be here. Like, it doesn't have to be at the end. And also, markets aren't just going to play out exactly the same way. They've always kind of sorry that they've played out in the past, right? So, I mean, this is an investment advice, but just looking at it, right, and even looking at like the monthly candles and things like that as well, I mean, you know, it just, I just don't see it. I really don't see that being the cycle top.
00:05:12.362 - 00:05:45.032, Speaker A: I'm not convinced at this point because previous bull markets lasted a lot longer than this. I mean, this is the Coinbase chart and Kraken has the best chart here for kind of like what's going on. So, like in previous bull markets, you also have a recovery during 2016 into 2017. And it's actually better to look at the bitcoin chart here because there's more price data. So if we look at kind of like 2016 here on the monthly chart, right, throughout 2016, bitcoin was going up and up and up, recovering, right. And coming back to its previous all time high. And in 2017, it went up there.
00:05:45.032 - 00:06:18.328, Speaker A: That's exactly the same thing we've seen here. Where during 2020, right? I mean, prior to the COVID dump, I believe that if there wasn't for COVID, bitcoin would have skyrocketed still, right. We wouldn't have had these kind of red candles here, but kind of like that doesn't even matter because we trended back up. But you can see in 2020, the trend is still up and up and up and then 2021, you know, really up. So it's still fitting in with previous trends. And I know that I just said, like, not, it's not going to be the same every time, but it's, you know, it's just funny because I just don't believe that, you know, ETH is going to top at $2,000. Right.
00:06:18.328 - 00:06:35.644, Speaker A: Right. When its last all time high was, like, 1.4k. You know, bitcoin, admittedly, is pretty hot. Right. It. It's been hot for a while. And, you know, I typically kind of like, like to look at, you know, bitcoin and ethereum and the other assets, like, separately because they do have their own cycles.
00:06:35.644 - 00:06:54.430, Speaker A: So maybe, you know, bitcoin is in, like, what's called a local top, right, where it just trends sideways for a while. And that gives room to a theory, I mean, the other coins to kind of catch up. Maybe we see that. I mean, this is how it play out in 2017. I'm not sure. But regardless of what the price action is doing, what the, you know, the charts are saying the. The fundamentals for Ethereum have never been stronger.
00:06:54.430 - 00:07:19.146, Speaker A: So, yeah, if you're worried about things, you know, I'm not saying we're not going to go. There's no chance we go into another bear market. Maybe there is. Like, I don't know, I can't tell the future, obviously. But at the same time, if you, like, take a long term outlook, like I like to do, these kind of moves are easier to deal with. And also, it's always very good to make sure that you're not over invested as well. Because if you're invested to the point where, you know, you're seeing kind of your net worth go away and you.
00:07:19.146 - 00:07:30.866, Speaker A: And you're thinking to yourself, well, I have to cash out now. I'm not going to be able to, like, survive. Right. You're over invested. Just straight up, you're too invested. Right. You need to be able to separate, you know, your cash position, your living expenses position.
00:07:30.866 - 00:07:45.444, Speaker A: Right. All of that. Your income from the crypto markets. Yes, I know you can earn income via yield farming and stuff like that. And I do that. You know, I support myself a lot through that as well. But, you know, you need to kind of think to yourself, like, could I survive a 90% drawdown? Right.
00:07:45.444 - 00:08:12.316, Speaker A: Just the worst possible scenario you can think of. Could I survive a 90% drawdown in bitcoin and ETH? Right. Would I be fine? You know, and if you work within crypto, does your company kind of, like, have Runway to survive a bear market, things like that. These are the critical things you have to think about. And if you're fine, then these moves really shouldn't affect you. Yes, it sucks to watch your net worth kind of evaporate overnight, right? But at the end of the day, it's paper gains. Like, unless you have cashed out, you have not realized those gains.
00:08:12.316 - 00:08:28.796, Speaker A: So any of the money that you thought that you had, you actually didn't have. Right. It was in limbo, basically. It is not actually yours until you realize it into a stable coin or into, like, some other stable asset. So that's also good to keep in mind. But again, none of that is investment advice. But that's just how I think about it.
00:08:28.796 - 00:08:56.508, Speaker A: And always really good not to be over invested because I've been there, I've been overinvested. Right. And it just, it hurts because you see it going down and you're just like, you know, you feel that kind of sickness in your stomach, and there's like a pit in your stomach where you're just like, uh, you know, what's gonna happen now? You know, this is gonna be crazy. So. And best. And just not look at the prices day to day. I mean, I try not to talk about it too much on here, only during, like, I guess, massive swings, you know, to the downside or to the upside, because I think it's relevant then.
00:08:56.508 - 00:09:25.710, Speaker A: But really best not to just stare at the charts every day. Unless you're a trader, then it's different. But as an investor, you know, obsessively checking your portfolio, obsessively checking the charts isn't great for your mental health, for sure. I mean, I'm guilty of doing this. I'm not going to say, like, I'm following my own advice here, but, you know, if you are having trouble with it, just step away from the charts. That's what I, you know, I do sometimes if I, I'm looking at it and I'm kind of, like, feeling depressed about it, you know, I kind of, like, step away from it. So always good to keep that in mind as well.
00:09:25.710 - 00:09:48.304, Speaker A: But, oh, I'll stop there on the price talk. There's a lot of fundamental talk to get to today, so I'm going to jump right into that. Actually, before I jump into that, I did want to give a quick shout out to cryptocurrency jobs on Twitter. You can follow them at jobs in crypto. They've got a website that basically lets you browse through, like, thousands of different crypto jobs. And they've got a weekly newsletter as well. So definitely go sign up for that.
00:09:48.304 - 00:10:41.882, Speaker A: This isn't a sponsored thing or anything, but cryptocurrency jobs has been a partner for to Ethub for quite a while now, where we have their jobs kind of listed in the EtHub newsletter each week. And that's like completely free. You know, we don't have any kind of deal on that. But the reason I bring it up is because I have a lot of people messaging me about crypto jobs. They're like, you know, how do I get started in crypto? How do I get a job in crypto? How do I do this? How do I do that? I would say the first thing to do is to check this website, see what's out there, see what you want to do, see what's available. Right? And then, you know, kind of like, if there is a company you like working for, this is a bit of a kind of an alpha leak here. If there is a company that you want to work for in, or like a, like a kind of community that you want to work for within crypto, and they have a community discord or something like that, go join it and start kind of like adding value to it, right? Because when you start adding value like that, yes, it's not paid or anything like that.
00:10:41.882 - 00:11:17.870, Speaker A: But you are showing that, you know, you're very interested in this, right? You want to work in this. And then it's just a kind of like, I guess you could call it resume booster, because, I mean, I'm not really a fan of resumes. Like my, the way I look at things and when I kind of, you know, look at, look at what people's work like, I look at people's work, what they've done, you know, what they've contributed to the community and things like that, rather than like, just a straight up resume. Because I think crypto is a bit different in that there's so many different ways you can contribute and so many different communities you can be a part of that. It's just like, there's so much opportunity out there right now. But definitely start at the cryptocurrency jobs website. Go follow them here.
00:11:17.870 - 00:11:49.984, Speaker A: Go sign up to the newsletter so you can keep on top of things as well. So there is going to possibly be the world's first Ethereum ETF launching soon that I think is going to be launching in Canada. So there is actually a bitcoin ETF in Canada right now. I think it's gobbled up about 10,000 BTC, and it's only been live for a couple weeks, not even. So, yeah, I think this ETF is actually going to be run by Galaxy Digital, which is Mike Novogratz's firm. So it's not just like something small, actually. So if it's approved, it'll be on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which is.
00:11:49.984 - 00:12:11.838, Speaker A: Which is huge. Right? I mean, this is what I was talking about before in terms of institutional adoption for ETH as an asset. And I've spoken about this on the refuel a lot, where the jump from non crypto to BTC for institutions is huge. It took them, like ten years to get there. Right. But the jump from BTC to ETH is significantly less. And I think it's actually like months, not even years.
00:12:11.838 - 00:12:32.306, Speaker A: Right, from, from. From them, to be interested in ETH, because once you're already in crypto, once you buy bitcoin, getting to Ethan other assets is much easier, I mean, even on an individual basis. Like, a lot of us would have started with bitcoin. I know I did, right. Bought bitcoin first, and then I, you know, went down the rabbit hole. Um, because so once you're in the ecosystem, it's very hard to get out. I mean, it's pretty much impossible to get out.
00:12:32.306 - 00:13:11.192, Speaker A: Like, let's be honest, you know, you try to kind of get out and it pulls you back in, so to speak. So, you know, this is very bullish. Uh, I'm glad that they're kind of doing it with Galaxy digital from, from Mike Novogratz. I mean, he's been in the space for quite a while now, and he's from the traditional finance world, so he understands that whole world, and he'll get people kind of, like, interested in this product as well, which is, which is going to be really great since it is their product, of course. But also, you know, he can articulate kind of the Ethereum use case to kind of a different audience, and, like, the Ethereum value prop, so really, really excited to see that. So sushiswap launched their onsen round two recently. So there's a bunch of updates here.
00:13:11.192 - 00:13:35.974, Speaker A: Basically, the Onsen program is a liquidity mining program where they pay out sushi rewards to a bunch of different pairs. And you can see here they've got a bunch of new pairs that they're paying out now. Paying out to now. There's so many pairs here. I mean, look at this. Like, there's. There's, there's MBTC ETH, you know, GRT ETH, you know, all these different coins like Premier ETH, I mean, these are all like, some of these are very new coins as well.
00:13:35.974 - 00:14:18.024, Speaker A: So you can get sushi rewards for providing liquidity here. And they've also supported NFTX funds as well. So you can actually get sushi, sushi swap rewards for providing liquidity to the different kind of like punk NFTX funds and the hash mask NFTNs funds as well. NFTX funds as well, which I thought was really cool. So yeah, if you're someone who likes the liquidity provide, definitely sushiswap is really great right now because it pays you those really nice rewards in sushi tokens. And I actually think, I mean, I hold sushi tokens and there's a reason because they give you, you can stake your tokens and basically get a yield on it, which I think is really, really cool as well. So, yeah, it's not like you're getting like a token that you might just immediately sell.
00:14:18.024 - 00:14:58.804, Speaker A: You can actually restake those tokens, you know, and kind of earn rewards. There is a caveat there with what, where two thirds of them are vested over six months, so you only get one third upfront. But I still think it's cool, right? I still think. I actually think the vesting models better because we've seen it play out with synthetix where the s and x rewards are vested over time, or at least like there, there's like a year lockup on them from when you claim them. Which I think is a big reason why our synthetix has had so much success is because they've been able to build a community like that. So I really, I'm a really big fan of this kind of vesting programs here, but definitely go check this out if you're a liquidity provider. So Kyber Network.
00:14:58.804 - 00:15:37.704, Speaker A: Kyber Network's co founder, sorry, announced a new paper called the dynamic market making, or DMM, kind of like a mechanism here. And this paper basically dives into what the DMM is, and the TL doctor is that it allows kind of users, or allows for the creation of highly optimized pools with high capital efficiency and improved profits for LP's. And, and as he says here, our hope is that DMM opens up an entirely new line of research to innovate on existing amms. Now this is the paper here. You know, it's quite lengthy, as you, as you can imagine. As for a new paper, it's a lot, it's a lot of technical stuff, a lot of math. So if that's your thing.
00:15:37.704 - 00:15:56.344, Speaker A: Definitely. Go give it a read. But this is cool. I think the Amm space in general has just so much more to be explored here. You know, there's so much more we can do rather than just like the normal kind of uniswap model. Right. And there's already experimentation happening not just within Kyber, but you know, curve, you know, has their own kind of model.
00:15:56.344 - 00:16:29.188, Speaker A: Dodo, I think that has their own model. I think maybe one inch also has their own model for their amm. So there are different ones out here. I know M stable has one as well with their, with their max weights and stuff like that. So yeah, this is just another entry into here, but I won't kind of like dive deep into it on here because I haven't read the paper myself yet. But I think, you know, to get a good grasp of how it works, you really should either read this thread, which, which is a TLDR thread, or read the paper because I think, you know, the Kyber team is really great. They're really great at kind of like they've been around for a while.
00:16:29.188 - 00:16:54.358, Speaker A: They deliver really great products, they execute well. And you know, if anyone can pull off a new kind of amm, it's probably them. So I think that's really cool. And you can see here, actually a little bit of a summary. There's a dynamic market maker, allows for dynamic fees, programmable curves and permission less liquidity contribution as well. So that's, that's super cool. I mean, balancer obviously also has their model where there's dynamic fees and kind of things like that as well.
00:16:54.358 - 00:17:21.086, Speaker A: And you can do different weights and stuff. So yeah, there's so much experimentation happening in the amm space right now. I just think it's really cool. So yeah, definitely go check out this, this paper. So Slingshot finance or Slingshot crypto, I guess it's a decentralized kind of exchange aggregator and just its disclosure here. I'm an investor in Slingshot, so not trying to shield here. I just thought that it was cool that they're, they launched basically a game to enter their closed beta.
00:17:21.086 - 00:17:56.120, Speaker A: So you can play this game at games, Slingshot dot Finance, and you can basically get beta access or go on the waitlist to get beta access. So I thought that was really cool. You know, I think, I mean, I got beta access to it before because obviously I'm an investor, but I think, you know, the fact that it's open up to more people now is really cool. And I think that the way they did this with the game was, was also really cool because, you know, just signing up for a beta list that with an email address is kind of boring. You want to like get the community more involved here and get them hyped about something. And I really like the trailers as well. And I thought this was cool.
00:17:56.120 - 00:18:17.672, Speaker A: Like this little, this little kind of logo here. Not, you know, it's unrestricted trading, non custodial, decentralized on Ethereum. So yeah. As for the product itself, as I said, it is a new decentralized exchange aggregator. Not entirely new. It's just a rebrand of Dex Ag that was around for a while. One of the first Dex aggregators actually that was around for a long time.
00:18:17.672 - 00:18:48.956, Speaker A: But yeah, slingshot is kind of like the rebrand of that and not to kind of discredit it. That's more than a rebrand. It's like an entirely kind of new, new system here. You can see kind of like in the GiF here, a bit of a preview of it. But basically, yeah, I don't want to show it too much since I'm an investor, but if this is something that you're interested in, you know, you're looking for your next favorite kind of decentralized exchange aggregator. Definitely kind of check this out and you know, participate in this beta. So loopring added a bunch more tokens to their L2 AMM exchange.
00:18:48.956 - 00:19:21.542, Speaker A: There's heaps here, there's Ray, there's SNX, there's RGT, there's mask, there's badger, you know, and this, you know, as they point out here they are, the biggest feedback they get is there's not enough tokens on there. I think the second biggest feedback they get is there's not enough liquidity either. But this takes time. I mean, I've spoken about this on the refuel a lot of times that it takes time for network effects to build. And you know, I think loop rig is doing an amazing job in building those network effects with liquidity mining programs, with adding more assets. Right. With kind of growing their trading volumes, which they are.
00:19:21.542 - 00:20:03.878, Speaker A: I think they're up at almost $30,000,000.24 hours trading volume now. And it was like $10 million just two weeks ago, I think. So some really nice growth there. And the fact that they're adding more pairs here means more growth because the really special thing about decentralized exchanges, especially something like uniswap, is that they service the long tail of assets. Now what this means is it basically means all these assets that aren't on centralized exchanges yet, because when you issue a new token to get it on a centralized exchange, you either have to have investors that were part of like the centralized exchange, you have to do some kind of like insider backdoor stuff, right. Or you have to like basically wait until they kind of sign off on you not being a security.
00:20:03.878 - 00:20:35.886, Speaker A: Right. And your token not being a security. And then going through all their checklists to get on a centralized exchange, at least one with volume on it, like, you know, coinbase or Gemini. You know, binance is a bit looser. But, but at the same time, I've recently only seen binance listing tokens that they have a vested interest in. So, you know, it's good that we have these alternatives within Ethereum now and these decentralized alternatives where, you know, anyone can kind of list tokens on them, whereas with loopring right now, the reason they have to add more tokens is because it's on their, on their l two. I don't think there's the ability to add kind of your own tokens to it yet.
00:20:35.886 - 00:21:10.178, Speaker A: They have to kind of whitelist it. I think it's just for safety reasons, which makes sense. But you know, as they add more assets and more liquidity comes into it, there'll be more trading volume there. So, yeah, got no, I got no kind of like reservations there. Just really cool to see loopring kind of uh, you know, bringing these, these new tokens to their exchange. So block Native released a new platform called the Block Native Gas platform, which allows for a new and accurate price feed for pricing, ethereum transaction fees. And they claim here that it will help you get your transactions into the next block without overpaying.
00:21:10.178 - 00:21:53.896, Speaker A: So I've spoken about block native a bunch of different times before. They're basically, you know, they call themselves masters of the, the mempool. So basically masters of the pool where all the transactions go before they're included in a block. And I've spoken about that in the past, so I won't rehash, rehash it there. But yeah, as I, as kind of, like they say in their tweet, what this does is it allows for, you know, more accurate gas price estimation for different kind of apps and things like that. So I think, yeah, this is more, yeah, this is definitely geared towards builders and traders, not so much like everyday users, because the builders can integrate this within their app and give their users more accurate gas kind of estimations, which is obviously sorely needed. So if you're a developer of an app or if you have an app that you would like this integrated in.
00:21:53.896 - 00:22:42.636, Speaker A: Definitely go kind of like ping them about it and bug them about it. Because, yeah, I mean, I really do think Block native is the kind of, you know, best kind of team we have out there, best product we have out there for mastering the mempool. And, you know, I think this is going to be really cool, especially, you know, and like, I know ERP 15 nine is supposed to suit smoother Nat transactions as well. But, you know, this just adds another kind of layer to that too, for app developers to tap into, which I thought was really cool. So definitely go check that out after if you're interested in that. So I think the biggest news actually from the last 24 hours with that was that Coinbase filed their s one and Larry did a really great thread here of the notes from it. So basically, what this is, it's coinbases, I guess, financial statements, you know, internal company documents, things like that, because they're filing to go public.
00:22:42.636 - 00:23:07.844, Speaker A: They have to kind of put these metrics out there now into the public. And this is the first time we actually get to see this. So, you know, as Larry notes here, you know, they had $3.4 billion in total revenue until 2020, mostly from transaction fees. So obviously from like, volume on their exchange, they have 43 million verified users and 2.8 million, I think, is a typo, yet supposed to say 2.8 million monthly transacting users.
00:23:07.844 - 00:23:42.042, Speaker A: So, you know, this, I guess, is our best kind of measure about how many people are actually in crypto, because at least in the US especially, and like maybe the western nations, because they are the ones who use Coinbase. I know there's other exchanges, but I think this is a really accurate kind of measure. So only 2.8 million monthly active users here, right? That's not very much when you think about it. I mean, you know, the world population in terms of the western countries is in the. Is in the billions, right? So once you kind of take that into account, this is a really, really small percentage of that. Like, this is like 0.28%,
00:23:42.042 - 00:24:12.790, Speaker A: if I'm doing my math, right, of a billion. So we still have a long way to go at the same time. And, you know, even if you take it that most people, you know, maybe some people don't, aren't monthly active users. They just kind of buy and hold on an exchange. There's 43 million users on Coinbase after, like, I think almost ten years of operation or nine or eight years of Coinbase being out there. So that's a small number, too, right? Yes. It's much bigger than the monthly kind of transacting users, but a lot of these users would have verified themselves during the 2017 bull market and probably went away since then.
00:24:12.790 - 00:24:41.470, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think that was really, just really interesting. A bunch of other things here that were interesting as well is that Coinbase holds crypto on their balance sheet. So they hold $130 million worth of BTC, $24 million worth of ETH, and $34 million of other. Now, that might seem like a small number to you, which I actually think it is, but at the same time, they're a crypto exchange. They already got a lot of exposure to crypto and a lot of the risk from it. So it probably doesn't make sense for them to hold the assets themselves on their balance sheet. Right.
00:24:41.470 - 00:24:58.372, Speaker A: But still, the fact that they do is really cool here. There's a bunch of other. I mean, I'll link this in the YouTube description. There's a bunch of other really cool stuff here. But basically they've got 90 billion assets on the platform, which I thought was really cool. If you look at the total crypto market cap, I think it's like 1.5 trillion.
00:24:58.372 - 00:25:18.574, Speaker A: So Coinbase essentially has like 7% of all, the whole crypto market cap on their. Their platform in custody, which is. Which is pretty insane, right? When you think about it, there's more info here. I mean, based. There's more info on acquisitions, on the shares, the cap table. Right. Kind of, you know, who's got what, like how much shares people have.
00:25:18.574 - 00:25:34.894, Speaker A: Obviously, Brian has a lot. And, you know, as Larry notes here, like, Brian is balling the. The fuck out after the stock gets liquid. I mean, he's going to essentially be an instant billionaire because the. The. I guess, what is it? The. The valuation for Coinbase is about $100 billion right now on secondary markets.
00:25:34.894 - 00:25:52.700, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's probably going to be that or above. And there's a bunch of interesting notes here. I think Coinbase had a view on Defi. They're bullish on it, but cautious about the risks. And then. Yeah, I mean, that was kind of like the end of the thread there from Larry. He did post some other stuff around this that I don't have handy right now.
00:25:52.700 - 00:26:39.428, Speaker A: But I think one of them was that most of the capital coming into the space right now is non retail. I think there's only 30% of retail capital on Coinbase, or at least volume on Coinbase, which means a lot of that is institutional. Right? So again, institutions are coming and they here and retail is just not here in a big way yet. And that's another reason why I don't think we're at a kind of cycle top, right? Possibly at a local top, but yeah, I mean, retail is what determines cycle tops. Because the retail investors, you know, most of them plow in towards the end, right? Because they hear about this mania and they fomo in and then we have like the crash because, you know, this, there's a lot of money coming in, but it's for a short period of time and then, you know, you can't kind of sustain that. So, yeah, I think, I think that's really bullish. I think it's bullish that Coinbase is going public.
00:26:39.428 - 00:27:09.962, Speaker A: It's going to bring in a lot new, a lot of new people into the space, a lot of new eyeballs. It's going to legitimize the space some more. So, yeah, really, really cool to see that playing out. So Etherscan introduced a new feature which I thought was really cool called the pending transaction queue. Now you can see on the image here there's a little bar that's added to each transaction now. And what this bar represents is it's a transactions queued position relative to others in the transaction pool. So you can basically, as Etherscan says here, it's a quick way to gauge how far off your transaction is from getting confirmed.
00:27:09.962 - 00:27:49.240, Speaker A: So, I mean, etherscan always loves to add these little features and I love them for it. I mean, there's so many little features on either scan that make it just like such a sticky platform to use. I mean, you know, even if you look at a transaction like a transaction hash and go through all the information that it gives you, there's just so much there. And, you know, and the thing is though, they add information and they, they don't even advertise it sometimes you just kind of find that and you're like, holy crap, this is awesome. So this is, you know, just another one of those really awesome features that, you know, they didn't have to add, but they do because like they want to add as many features as possible for their users. So, you know, ether scan, we don't deserve etherscan and Ethereum. They just, they're, they're too good, right? It's, it's free.
00:27:49.240 - 00:28:06.830, Speaker A: Like, there are ads on the platform, but, you know, you don't have to pay for this kind of thing. And getting this data yourself and doing all this yourself is basically impossible. You need so much infrastructure for this. You need to like, kind of like have a full time team and everything to do this. Right. So I think it's just really cool that it's still free. Right.
00:28:06.830 - 00:28:27.830, Speaker A: And I don't expect them to go to a paid model. I think they do make enough from ads and probably some other kind of business kind of verticals there. So yeah, really cool to see these from Etherscan. So Matthew Feinstein from loopring actually kind of put out this really cool tweet today, basically saying the cold hard truth ETH killers will not kill ethereum. They will not even scathe Ethereum. L two. S.
00:28:27.830 - 00:28:40.906, Speaker A: A single. L two. The loop ring ZK roll up is earning more in fees each day that eks do in a week or month and paying those fees to Ethereum for security. So a little bit of background here. L1. Sorry. L two.
00:28:40.906 - 00:29:19.398, Speaker A: Right. Can either choose to do like no fees at all or like tiny fees, right. If you've used loop ring, you'll notice that they take a very small fee of like two cent per trade. Now these fees go to the looper and kind of validators, right? Like they would in, you know, like how fees go to Ethereum miners and they're actually used to post, I guess, like the security kind of transactions or like the data to the Ethereum main chain to make these L2 solutions work. And as you can see here, loop rings had some amazing growth recently and that's come with amazing fee growth. And they're doing more fees than the Ethereum killers do in a week or a month. And they have just as much scalability as these Ethereum killers claim to have.
00:29:19.398 - 00:30:04.640, Speaker A: Right. So it's just, it's just crazy because I was looking, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but I was looking the other day at Coingecko and I was looking at all the market caps of different kind of Ethereum killers and then the market cap of Ethereum. And I was like, holy crap. Like some of these are like one fifth of Ethereum's value and they literally do nothing. You know, I know I talk about Cardano a lot and I call them out a lot and for good reason, because Cardano for some reason has like a 30 million, a $30 billion market cap or something. Ethereum has like a 170 or $180 billion market cap at this point, right? So the market is saying that it's valuing a platform, that one has no transactions on it except for staking transactions and arbitrage between exchanges. Two does not have smart contracts.
00:30:04.640 - 00:30:37.344, Speaker A: Right? So nothing's on there. Three, I haven't seen anyone ever say to me that they want to build on Cardano. Like, not once have I ever heard anyone say they want to build on Cardano. Right? So taking all that into account, the fact that it's even worth 30 billion, while Ethereum is only worth 170 or 180 billion, just screams to me that Ethereum is undervalued, right? Or Cardano is extremely overvalued. I actually think both are true. I think Cardano and all the other Ethereum killers at this point are extremely overvalued for what they are in terms of usage. And I think Ethereum is extremely undervalued for what it is.
00:30:37.344 - 00:30:53.184, Speaker A: But at the same time, the space runs on narratives, right? The narratives of other Ethereum platform. Sorry, of the Ethereum killers is that they're more scalable. You know, they have gas free transactions. Like, they don't have high gas fees. Right. All this sort of stuff. And this space loves narratives at the end of the day.
00:30:53.184 - 00:31:24.844, Speaker A: So unfortunately, Ethereum might be losing the narrative war short term because we do have the high fees, right. And we still need to scale, which we will, I'm promising you, we're scaling in the next few months. But during that time, I think we're still gonna have to deal with like, the narratives being against us, which is unfortunate, but just the reality of it right now. So. Yeah, but anyway, really cool to see this from loop ring and I really appreciate Matt for posting this out there. So I spoke about the EIP 1559 drama and about how some of the miners are against it recently. Right.
00:31:24.844 - 00:31:52.960, Speaker A: And you know, I won't rehash my thoughts on, on that and why I think that, you know, they're not going to do anything to stop Erp 1559. But not every miner, and not every mining pool is against it, as you can see here. F two pool is actually for 1559. And they pinned a blog post basically kind of saying why, why they are. And like, there's a bit of a history here and like, because they've been around for a while, they kind of deeply understand this. And then. Yeah, why we support 1559 here, basically TLdr is that they believe it's a.
00:31:52.960 - 00:32:24.558, Speaker A: An amazing upgrade for Ethereum and it brings out all these benefits. So why kind of wouldn't they support it? But you can go read the full blog post on this. I think it's getting very heated now with, with this sort of stuff because we now have over 50% of the hashrate saying that they do not support 1559. But I'm still sticking to my kind of thoughts that the game theory will hold for this. I basically am calling out miners every time now. I called out Sparkpool because they said they were opposing 1559. And I basically said, talk is cheap.
00:32:24.558 - 00:32:56.280, Speaker A: We'll see where their hashrate goes when the fork happens. And I said, spoiler alert, the hashrate is going to go to the 1559 chain. I mean, there might be like a fork where the miners try to kind of, I guess, continue on with like, some, some weird non 1559 chain. I expect that to be extremely short lived, and I expect that to die because there's no one gonna be sticking with it. As I showed you yesterday, Trenton van Epps put together a list of all the apps that are gonna be kind of like in support of 1559. It's all the major ones. And then, as I said, we'll get the exchanges.
00:32:56.280 - 00:33:17.448, Speaker A: Once the upgrades plan, we have a date for it, the exchanges will weigh in. And I don't see the exchanges saying no when they know the rest of the ecosystem wants it, except miners. Right? And it's actually funny because the binance pool mining pool is 41559. So bit funny there. But yeah. Anyway, really great to see these from f two pool. Go read the blog post if you haven't, haven't yet.
00:33:17.448 - 00:33:42.028, Speaker A: And I thank them. As I said in my reply here, I thank them for being on the right side of history because the Ethereum community will not forget who was it for and who was against the, you know, 1559. All right, that's it for today, everyone. Thank you again for listening and watching. If you haven't done so, be sure to subscribe to the channel. If give you the video a thumbs up, join the Discord Channel, subscribe to the Daily Gray newsletter, and I'll catch you all next week. Have a great weekend, everyone.
00:33:42.028 - 00:33:42.284, Speaker A: Thanks.
