00:00:00.840 - 00:00:11.794, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and I'm here today with Eric Conner and special guest David Hoffman to discuss all things ethereum. Hey, guys, what's going on?
00:00:12.454 - 00:00:13.274, Speaker B: Yo.
00:00:14.214 - 00:00:39.314, Speaker A: Hey, you know, it's funny, david, me and you, like, I don't know, 12 hours ago, my time did a, did a live stream, and now we're with Eric. So we already talked a lot about a lot of stuff, but I think I was thinking about topics during the week to discuss with Eric. And I was like, you know what? Eric's been tweeting a lot about these meme coins. And I, like, I've got no idea going on in that world because I'm just not paying attention to it. So, Eric, I want you to start us off. Like, why are you so bullish on meme coins all of a sudden?
00:00:40.694 - 00:01:02.480, Speaker C: All right, let me. I guess I'll start from stage one here. So, to be fair, like, when defi mining kind of started, I feel like I was one of the. Obviously not the first, but I feel like I was early in that space where people were like, what is it? Like, what is defi farming? Blah, blah, blah. These coins, we don't need these coins. Blah, blah. Now, I'm not saying meme coins are going to be the next defi.
00:01:02.480 - 00:01:27.644, Speaker C: I maybe slightly would say that meme coins might be the next narrative, but yeah, I guess, long story short, I started just seeing people talk about this. Obviously, the markets have been kind of dead. We've been at between. Obviously we just had a huge dump. But let's just say we've been between 1518 hundred for what, multiple months now. I get a little bored. I like to explore just in my nature.
00:01:27.644 - 00:01:47.624, Speaker C: And I saw people just talking about this stuff. So actually, what originally got me into it, a lot of people were talking about unibot. And I was like, I faded it for a while. I dove in. It's actually pretty cool. Now, don't go put your, like, your cold wallet at unibot because there's questions around, like, key management. They launched like, a cloud key management, all this stuff.
00:01:47.624 - 00:02:27.000, Speaker C: But they have these, like, I don't know, people are just launching pairs. People are calling it like, on chain summer on chain trading, right? And these meme coins have started. And it kind of started with Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic ten, Inu, which actually has been sitting out there for multiple years at like zero. And I guess whales, whoever picked it up, it's this old, like, meme, right? Have you guys seen, like, the knockoff backpack and, like. And it's pumped to $200 million. And I, you know, I just got to thinking. I got to thinking, okay, doge shib.
00:02:27.000 - 00:02:44.984, Speaker C: Like, people just accept these as multi billion dollar coins. Why can't these memes pump right? So, I don't know. I just dove in. This is not financial advice. I'm a degenerate. Like, I'm not gonna lie. I've kind of made it so I can afford to lose money if I need to.
00:02:44.984 - 00:03:03.552, Speaker C: So I'll put that out there. But I hopped in a few, you know, the big ones now, which I are. I'm not in. I'm not in. Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, to be completely clear. Everybody started making derivatives off of these. So they did, like, their ticker is bitcoin, like, written out, right? And their meme is like, we're going to flip bitcoin.
00:03:03.552 - 00:03:16.104, Speaker C: Bitcoin's a meme. We're a meme. We're going to flip bitcoin. So then everyone started just doing derivatives on that. So the next big one is like XRP, which is like Harry Potter, Pac man. It's just funny to even say this.
00:03:16.184 - 00:03:18.472, Speaker A: Just trying to say. It is just stupid.
00:03:18.528 - 00:03:33.776, Speaker C: I'm addicted to the memes, though. Go to these Twitter handles. I'm not even saying buy it. Just go look at the memes. So, like, left curve. Ridiculous. And then, yeah, I know I've been tweeting about Nick Cage, waluigi, elmo.
00:03:33.776 - 00:03:57.776, Speaker C: I got that one. But, like, you know, I've dove in. I've dove in these communities. I'm trying to, like, learn lessons, right? I think one of the lessons I've learned is they're getting an insane amount of activity. Users, community. And, like, some of them, the one I'm in, like, is not charging a tax, but some of these are even charging, like, 5% trading taxes, and people are like, okay with it. Um, so there were some tweets out there the other day.
00:03:57.776 - 00:04:49.004, Speaker C: I think, David, you're involved in the thread, but, like, can we apply some of this knowledge to, like, public goods or, like, protocol funding and stuff? And I think every meta that pops up, every, like, new meme, new narrative that comes around, I think from, like, an ethereum protocol perspective, we can, like, learn things, right? Like, why are people pushing meme coins to 200 million in doge and shibs case, like, billions of dollars? So, I mean, I've been dabbling, but there's some stuff to learn here. I mean, I think I've been deeper than both of you, but I'm sure you guys have seen it, you know, popping on Twitter and stuff, curious to get your thoughts. But, like, really what I've, you know, this is just something I'm dabbling in. And at some point, I'm sure, I mean, I don't think they're going to fade away. I really do kind of see this as a new crypto meta, but, like, can we learn things from this? I guess that's the real thing I'm trying to take away from it myself.
00:04:50.304 - 00:05:12.056, Speaker B: I don't think we should really ever doubt the power of memes in this industry. Like Anthony said, we have doge. We have. Or, no, Eric said we have doge. We have shib. So we know that memes work, and memes come in all shorts and shapes and spectra, shapes and spectrums, and we have a meme. It's called ultrasound money, and that's a different kind of meme.
00:05:12.056 - 00:05:44.806, Speaker B: And so it's memes of all types and flavors. And I think as crypto develops, it's, like, civilization side of things. Like, there's very, just, like, robust, like, stable cornerstones of crypto that are high trafficked, that are just totally safe that it's going to be like, the civilization of crypto. The weird frontier of crypto has gotten even further, and this is just, like, the furthest, weirdest frontier of the corner of crypto. There's always going to be there. It's always going to be, there's always going to be this weird section of crypto that just, like, right. Like, rears its head every now and then.
00:05:44.990 - 00:06:27.014, Speaker A: Mm hmm. I think on Eric's point about, like, the public goods stuff and potentially using it for public goods funding, this is actually something that I was thinking about. It's kind of creating these meme coins and then generating, like, a lot of hype around it. Right. A lot of marketing around it and being pretty explicit that it's a meme coin, but then also just having, like, all the trading fees going to the protocol guild, like, automatically, there is no intermediary. It's just like, hey, the inbuilt smart contract trading fee just automatically redirects the fees to the protocol guild and never touches the creator wallet or anything like that. Um, and that alone, you know, if you really think about it, could actually end up funding public goods with more money than years worth of Gitcoin grants rounds.
00:06:27.014 - 00:07:21.470, Speaker A: Even though I love Gitcoin grants, I think the memetic kind of side of things is just so powerful and if you applied it to the Harry Potter coin, whatever, I don't even know how much trading, um, fees that they kind of accrued, but it would probably be in the many millions at this stage, and that would quickly dwarf everything that has gone to the protocol guild. The protocol guild has been able to attract a sizable chunk at point, I think it's 1015 million or something like that. But could you imagine that getting just dwarfed within, like, a few weeks during a bull market where everyone's just crazy trading these things? And it's that concept of turning, like, that degeneracy into regeneracy, where essentially, people are going to do this anyway, so let's redirect that energy into something that actually benefits the ecosystem, and we do it with the ETH burn, right? Like, everything. Every time a transaction happens on the network, ETH gets burned. And that is, I guess, a roundabout way of doing it, where essentially, obviously, no one is getting the ETH that's burned. Burned. It's just burned.
00:07:21.470 - 00:07:44.918, Speaker A: But it kind of makes the value of ETH more resilient. We've seen that play out during the bear market, how ETH has held up much better against bitcoin than it did last bear market, which I think is really the story to tell there when it comes to that stuff. And that's the thing that interests me most. And I think people miss that because they just see the meme coins, and they just like, oh, this is a scam, blah, blah. I'm like, yeah, okay. I mean, some of them are probably. A lot of them are scams, right? A lot of them are just get rich quick schemes and everything like that.
00:07:44.918 - 00:08:19.202, Speaker A: But I think if you be explicit about what it is, it's just a meme coin. It's just something you can gamble on. It's literally the same as going to the casino and playing the slot machine, right? Maybe you pick the one that actually pays out. Maybe you pick the one that doesn't pay out, and it's just the way the game goes. But I think, yeah, people's main concern, or, like, my main concern with it, usually is when it's marketed as something that it isn't. And a lot of these things do do that because they know that once one narrative runs out, they have to come up with another one. But if it's really just like a meme coin game or a gambling kind of casino game, I don't consider anything to be wrong with it, to be honest.
00:08:19.398 - 00:08:49.176, Speaker B: So there's a project that did the whole tax on transaction fees. The whole cult dow thing is that. And so it's a whole, like, you just, we are a shitcoin army. We're going to meme this thing. It's going to be a meme. Everyone's going to talk about Colt and all the transaction volume is going to put 5% tax into the treasury. But I do wonder if just like, the actual commitment to public goods is like an anti shelling point for degeneracy in crypto, as in like, oh, they're about public goods.
00:08:49.176 - 00:08:55.384, Speaker B: Well, that's not bullish. I'm going to go off into the weird Harry Potter Obama coin, right?
00:08:55.464 - 00:09:29.158, Speaker C: I mean, the one thing I've realized is I don't know if a lot of the NFT space moved over to these or what it is, but people. So there's a couple of tools that you can plug the contract in, like token sniffer. So there's like three checkpoints. So if anybody's even thinking about doing this, first there's three main checkpoints. Is the LP burned? So, like, if like, the dev provides the original LP, you got to make sure it's burned or they can rug pull the whole thing. Does the contract have an owner? That's a big one. Because if it has an owner, like, they can rug pull it and then is there tax on it? Now, a lot of these have like two, three, four, 5% tax.
00:09:29.158 - 00:10:07.084, Speaker C: I, I prefer to, if I'm looking at them, 0% because I'm over time, I don't think the tax thing is very sustainable. But what I've realized in just like, being these communities is no one really looks at the contracts or knows how to look at the contracts right now. So what if somehow you started a narrative of, hey, you know, what if it was cool to like, hide the 1% tax in there to go to public goods? You know, like, you don't know, like, it could. That could be a thing. People aren't even looking at it. And from that, the biggest lesson I've learned is if people are making money, they don't care what the tax trading fees, anything is. If they're making money, they don't care.
00:10:07.084 - 00:10:48.716, Speaker C: Anthony, you and I have talked about this a lot in the past about layer one fees, right? Everybody in a bear market talks about, everybody in a bull market doesn't care because they're making a ton of money right now, of course, we have L2s. And one of the most interesting things I've seen actually are some of these are branching out to L2. So they're starting to bridge over because most people are only doing like $5000 trades like the Nick Cage Ellen one. They're like arbitrum base, I think, like Polygon, but that's cool, right? Like, we wanted this to happen. We wanted L2s to be a playground for stuff like this. Like, we, you can't do that. This isn't.
00:10:48.716 - 00:11:05.612, Speaker C: We don't. We're going to bring in users this way. Right. Whether we like it or not, whether we think it's stupid or not, most people are going to come in to silly stuff like memes, like nfts. In reality, they're not. They didn't really come in for Defi, they're going to come in for silly stuff. And we want to be able to onboard that on L2.
00:11:05.612 - 00:11:34.834, Speaker C: So I do think that's a cool thing to see. When I first saw these trading on layer one, I'm like, this just doesn't make sense to me. How is that even sustainable? If we hit a bull market and people were trying to buy $50 meme points for, I think, uniswap trade fees at $80 yesterday or whatever, everything dumped a day and a half ago, maybe this will be some kind of push for L2. I thought it was going to be NFTs, to be completely honest with you, but we haven't seen that migration of NFTs for whatever reason yet.
00:11:35.184 - 00:12:00.064, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah. I think the NFT thing's always funny because I think what NFTs did is that they front ran like years worth of price discovery because they just went so crazy in 2021 and now, like, no one wants to touch them because it's all just the same money right now. Right. It's not new money coming in that hasn't been burned by nfts or hasn't already played with them. Whereas these meme coin things, a lot of people haven't played with them before. Like, I haven't played with them yet.
00:12:00.064 - 00:12:47.080, Speaker A: Right. And I mean, you know, I'm in this industry every day, but a lot of people, yeah, like you, Eric, that have just maybe bought with the usual stuff going on on the market side of things are thinking, well, I'm going to go and just degen into these kind of meme coins. And as you said, like, l two s are starting to unlock more of these people because there's kind of like the long tail of people who don't want to, you know, bet with more than, like $50 on one of these meme coins because obviously, like, uh, you know, there's a high chance you're going to lose money on it. Um, because a lot of them do just end up rugging or going to zero or whatever. So obviously, if you have to spend, uh, extra money on gas fees and stuff, it just kind of, uh, makes your bankroll go. Go lower and lower, and then it just doesn't become, become worth it. And, yeah, it's funny that, like, base started off with this kind of meme coin before they were even live with bold token.
00:12:47.112 - 00:12:47.328, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:47.376 - 00:13:04.000, Speaker A: And what ended up happening was exactly what you said. The LP was, was rugged, basically. And then the whole thing about a employee. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was that one. That was a different one. Yeah. The bold one apparently was some guy called Milky on Twitter or something.
00:13:04.000 - 00:13:23.840, Speaker A: I saw someone kind of track down talking about bald. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was bold there. But yeah, generally that's the kind of stuff, stuff you want to look out for. But it's also interesting with the, with the l two s and how Defi plays into it. Like, Defi is the thing that enables all of this to happen. Right? Like, without defi, you wouldn't be able to trade these things like this.
00:13:23.840 - 00:14:01.848, Speaker A: Like, there were me, like, things that I guess look like meme coins in the past on centralized exchanges that you could trade. But the problem is, is that the centralized exchanges are always going to be way slower to list anything, right? They're not going to list things instantly, whereas if you create a coin and you add liquidity to it, you have created a market for it instantly yourself. You can do it within the same block, even. Really? So when you think about it like that, that's why I think the meme coins really only work on, on chain, because they're just like, they're just kind of like the infinite casino where someone spins up a new one, you're placing a bet on it. Nine times out of ten it goes nowhere, or 9.9 times out of ten it goes nowhere. But you're betting on that, that 0.1
00:14:01.848 - 00:14:26.864, Speaker A: time where it's essentially like, oh, wow, I actually made like 100 x on this. So you put $50 in, you make 100 x. But that's the game, right? That's the game you play. But as I said, I'm fine with that. I'm not fine with projects that have meme coins saying that they're more than that and trying to be more than that. And that's actually bearish for the coin, because now you have fundamentals. And for a meme coin, fundamentals are not bullish because you rely on a narrative.
00:14:26.864 - 00:14:45.838, Speaker A: If there's a reality, then. And then everyone kind of sees the reality and like, okay, this is bearish now. It's like what happened with Cardano. Cardano was a meme coin until they did smart contracts. Now people are, like, taking it more seriously where they're like, oh, smart contracts were delivered and Cardona didn't actually get much adoption or any adoption, really. And then Ada kind of fell pretty, pretty hard. Right.
00:14:45.838 - 00:14:52.870, Speaker A: So I think, yeah, fundamentals are not bullish for meme coins, but maybe. I don't know, Eric, if you've got a different view on that, but that's kind of my view.
00:14:53.062 - 00:15:11.826, Speaker C: I 100% agree with you. I do, in a way. Ethereum's hit with that, if I'm being completely honest. Like, bitcoin is literally just a meme coin and it delivers and has narratives. And not that it gets hit for that, obviously, we're doing just fine. But I think bitcoin doesn't trade at a stupid multiple. Right? Yeah.
00:15:11.826 - 00:15:40.634, Speaker C: Right. And Bitcoin has just decided, hey, we're never going to, like, promise to deliver on anything and, you know, it's worked out for them. But I mean, one of the funny things I've thought about too in this is like, all this stuff is kind of just repackaging the same thing. Like, in a way, nfts were just meme coins with, like, art attached, right. And in a way, Defi was. Defi was not meme coins or nfts. Like, obviously there's a lot more building there, but there were also, I mean, like, 95% of Defi protocols are down like 90 plus percent.
00:15:40.714 - 00:15:40.978, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:41.026 - 00:16:06.598, Speaker C: So in a way, like, all this stuff is oddly just repackaged. I agree with you, Anthony. Like, gambling casinos, right. But, you know, I think we had a tweet thread back and forth that we should talk about this on the pod. And I kind of started with, like, I'm hyper bullish eat because it is the world's casino. This is where people come to gamble, speculate, everything. And I think early on, ethereum community didn't embrace that.
00:16:06.598 - 00:16:19.870, Speaker C: I'm starting to see it more and more. But as an ETH holder, purely staker, that's the most bullish narrative I could pretty much ever think of, that we are the platform for where people come and speculate and do this stuff, Trey.
00:16:19.942 - 00:16:45.742, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the main criticism of that has been that because of the way block space bidding works, what ends up happening is that the speculative use cases price out everything else. At layer one, right. And this is where L2s come in and start fixing these things. Because obviously you can't build a payment network on layer one, right. You can't build like peer to peer payments and micro payments or whatever on layer one. You can build it on L2, but there's still kind of some issues there.
00:16:45.742 - 00:17:17.725, Speaker A: And honestly, I think that L2 fees are going to be very cheap after 4844 goes live. But it's still the same kind of thing where it's like a bidding war basically, and it depends on the speculative stuff. So then you start building other things, even at higher layers, like layer threes for example, where you can just have like a payments layer three. And then you can do everything that you wanted on that layer. And then you don't have to kind of like share the block space, so to speak. And I know there's other ways to deal with this with kind of having different, um, different kind of fee markets for, for different kind of types of transactions. That's exactly what ERP 4844 is.
00:17:17.725 - 00:18:09.076, Speaker A: But the, the problem becomes is that like the speculative stuff is always going to out price everything else just simply by virtue of if you stand to make like a $1,000 from a transaction, uh, especially if you're like an MEV bot, you're going to spend $999 on a fee because like if you're doing that a thousand times a day, you're making some, some good profits, like from an automated bot. And that's exactly what happens with MeV. That's why, uh, the prices, uh, sorry, the gas fee end up kind of spiking very high is because if there's money on the table, you're willing to spend whatever it takes to get that, to inch out that profit. And yeah, that's what's happened at layer one. The gas fees are high because of speculative stuff, the higher value stuff, prices at the lower value stuff. But I think we solve that with L2s and higher layers based on there. But that's not to say that the meme coins, as we were discussing, won't be on L2s and stuff like that, but it makes it so that you dont have to be priced out by that.
00:18:09.076 - 00:18:15.196, Speaker A: At layer one, which I am generally very bullish on. And the whole roll up centric roadmap obviously falls into that.
00:18:15.260 - 00:18:31.868, Speaker B: Preston, I dont know how sustainable this particular iteration of meme coins are. Erica theres four or five of them and you cant even name the names of them. And thats part of the meme thats part of the bit.
00:18:31.956 - 00:18:36.864, Speaker A: Preston. The ticker is bitcoin. You dont say Harry Potter sonic, you say the ticker is bitcoin.
00:18:38.764 - 00:19:07.652, Speaker B: But like as a meme, it violates the. One of the major laws of memes is that you're supposed to be recognizable and easy to digest and easy to pass along. Like you're supposed to be viral. And I kind of see this as just like there's this corner of the Internet and they're kind of weird and they buy weird stuff and it's funny and it's a joke, and then they buy the next joke and each thing that they buy is a joke. Like, I would categorize milady's in this category as well. It's like it's part of that weird corner of the Internet and they just rotate. And this is like the next iteration.
00:19:07.652 - 00:19:26.864, Speaker B: It's like these weirdly long spelled childhood memory meme coins with, with like actual crypto as their ticker. But like it'll be something else. And I think just like the. It'll eventually iterate onto like new styles of degeneracy and it'll like create all the economics that Anthony was just talking about on the L2s.
00:19:27.364 - 00:19:53.748, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, isn't this the beauty of ethereum though? Anybody in the world can spin up their own economy in like 2 seconds and we just can do weird shit with it. Like, I feel like humanity has needed this. Like, humanity loves speculating and like crazy markets, and it's just the perfect platform for it. I think I'll use this. One thing I've noticed is you guys, I'm sure know this better than me, but one thing I've noticed is, like, the pain points of bridging and like so arbitrary. I would give a shout out to arbitrum. Like they have.
00:19:53.748 - 00:20:12.738, Speaker C: If you go to their bridge, you can plug in a custom token address and like bridge over very easily. Base has like lock theirs down. They have four assets. I think it's like ETH Coinbase wrapped ETH. Like I think Lido ETH. And I want to say dai was the fourth one. USDC, yeah, maybe USDC, yeah.
00:20:12.738 - 00:20:41.496, Speaker C: That would make sense. With no custom bridging. Bridging out, of course, takes like seven days. But one of the biggest things I've seen, I don't know if you guys have seen any progress in this, but the concept of shared liquidity pools across L2s and layer one. So basically what's happening is let's just use meme coins because it's a conversation of the day. They start on Ethereum, they burn their lp. They say, hey, we want to go to L2.
00:20:41.496 - 00:21:06.624, Speaker C: So they bridge over dev launches a L2 LP, probably for a lot less money, which is great. But now there's ten x. The liquidity on layer one versus the L2. And this applies for Defi. I've seen all kinds of coins like this, a lot smaller lp's on L2s. Do you guys know of or think we can get to a point where we can have shared liquidity pools across all of these L2s?
00:21:07.844 - 00:21:58.214, Speaker B: I think this taps into the world of just the off chain Mev. And just like this verticalization of market making and MEV arbitrageurs, they are the shared liquidity. One of the biggest fuds about Ethereum is that the liquidity is all fractured across all the different chains. Well, we are one mev bought away from arbing liquidity across Uniswap pools, across chains. And the swap from Uniswap order routing on chain order routing to Uniswap X, which is a combination of dutch auctions plus an intent, which is a new style of packaging up a trade. MEV bots will select the bridge, make the trade, and swap your chain for you all in a single transaction. And from the end users perspective, it'll be instant, because they will also just take the seven day wait time by managing their liquidity and their positions.
00:21:58.214 - 00:22:16.594, Speaker B: And so it's a combination of mev bots and market making as an activity that's in one single. One single stack, and it just obfuscates so many bridges, almost basically every bridge for any end user. And so I think that whole world of bridging around Ethereum is actually totally going to change.
00:22:17.414 - 00:22:48.002, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I was going to say that as well. There's kind of like the maybe two core parts of this, I guess. Like there's the normal bridges that everyone uses, like hot protocol and Connext and stuff like that, right, to bridge across chains. And that's distinctly different, I think, to shared liquidity, because you're literally bridging your tokens from one chain to another. Like, as a user, obviously, the market makers and stuff can do this as well. And then there are liquidity pools that sit there, too, that kind of a shared. So that they take on the risk of that seven day withdrawal period in order to provide liquidity for you.
00:22:48.002 - 00:23:11.682, Speaker A: They take a fee. But then the other big part of it was what David was saying about these kind of like off chain orders and stuff like that, that happens. Now, cowswap obviously pioneered this, and Uniswap X has come along and kind of iterated on this. But essentially the magical thing about that is that the, I guess like searches, bundles, whatever you want to call them, off chain order matches, they pull liquidity from literally anywhere. It doesn't even have to be a L2, it can be another layer one. Wherever they can get liquidity.
00:23:11.778 - 00:23:13.146, Speaker B: Earth. Planet Earth.
00:23:13.250 - 00:23:26.946, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Wherever they can get that to fill your order. Um, and they take on the risk, right. They take on that. Any other risk. That's the bridging risk, the withdrawal risk, whatever it is, they take on that risk, but they just go search everywhere. That's supported by these protocols.
00:23:26.946 - 00:24:26.250, Speaker A: And the way it works on cowswap is that they make these people put up a bond so that if they do fill the order, but it's like a failed transaction or kind of like some toxic mev, they actually get kind of slashed in a sense right from their bond. So it's a way to protect the users as well from being taken advantage of. But that's, you know, there's problems with that as well, where people say, well, if all of the good order flow goes to these off chain orders, and then what's left for the LP's on chain? It's just the bad order flow, the toxic order flow, as they call it. Thats one issue with this as well. So while its really cool that you can pull liquidity from anywhere, and theres different ways to mitigate the toxic stuff that goes on there, it does pose questions for the normal LP's on chain, like what does their order flow look like? And thats a whole other discussion thats been going on in the mev community, in the cowswap uniswap communities. And I think that there are various solutions there, but generally theres those sorts of things. But then theres also the stuff that the L2s can do themselves.
00:24:26.250 - 00:25:03.786, Speaker A: Like obviously, optimism has this whole super chain thing that theyre doing where they can have and shared liquidity with all the chains that connect to that as part of the op stack, and then with ZK proofs and with the zero knowledge roll ups. If they're constructed in a correct way, they can actually talk to each other and communicate with each other via the l one and have shared liquidity. This sort of stuff, I think, is that technical hurdle. It's not really something that can't be solved, but it's also demand. Is there enough demand to justify building this thing right now? I think that with the liquidity concerns, it's not really a big concern. I don't really see people complaining about it. And bridging is relatively easy.
00:25:03.786 - 00:25:19.458, Speaker A: Um, yeah, maybe you have to wait a few minutes, but no one really cares if you have to wait a few minutes. Right. Uh, and, and all the concerns around the seven day withdrawal period, I don't think really anyone, any regular user is, is actually going through the normal seven day withdrawal kind of thing. Because for them it's like, you know, if it's a big amount of money.
00:25:19.506 - 00:25:20.498, Speaker B: I've never done that.
00:25:20.626 - 00:25:51.998, Speaker A: No, I haven't done that. I mean, I don't have a lot of money on l two s right now. Um, and I've said this on, on, on my, my show a lot where I basically said that I can't trust a lot of money on there right now just because a lot of them still have their training wheels on. But if I was to have like 50% of my net worth on an l two, I'm probably not going to go through the bridges and eat the fee unless I really need to. I would go through the seven day withdrawal period, but most users aren't doing that. They're just like, you know, I'll eat the fee, who cares? Because it's worth. Their expected value is more because they're bridging to somewhere where they think they're going to earn more money.
00:25:51.998 - 00:26:10.438, Speaker A: So they're paying that fee and that's where obviously the LP's come in and they fill that hole and they take on the risk and stuff. But yeah, the seven day withdrawal period was so overblown. I'm sure you guys remember how much fighter there was about that and how it's like, it's going to be the kill lot of optimistic follow ups. Like, and now no one even talks about it. We talk about it, but like, I've seen no one else talking about it.
00:26:10.606 - 00:26:15.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the whole, like the cross, sorry, go ahead, go ahead.
00:26:15.118 - 00:26:16.114, Speaker C: Now you go, David.
00:26:16.574 - 00:26:39.754, Speaker B: I think the whole just like cross chain ux issues, cross chain liquidity, synchronization, like time across bridges, like there's no silver bullet here. It's just a problem that will be like killed by the, death by a thousand cuts, right? We're going to find ten different ways to make this whole system better and then all of a sudden the whole system is going to become invisible.
00:26:40.774 - 00:27:13.172, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's one of the cool things about like maybe we can joke about NFTs meme coins, defi, whatever one of the cool things about the experimentation that happens is testing these systems. Right? Like, in a way, the meme coin mania might give us great examples of where the holes are in, like, user experience when it comes to L2. Right? Does bridging off on base, all my tokens are stuck. I can't even use the bridge for it. There's no Ui for it. Maybe people don't realize that until they get there. I know a lot of people don't realize there's a seven day wait.
00:27:13.172 - 00:27:55.542, Speaker C: And we know hot protocol, we know connects, we know these options. But a normie who coinbase onboards on to base, and then they buy a token, and now what say you're like, okay, well, actually, the LP looks way better on Ethereum. I want to move this over. Ethereum, either a, they're one of the four approved tokens in the UI, or, I mean, you can go through the contracts, but I mean, there's just. It's a disaster, right? No one is ever going to figure that out. So there are some, like, pain points, right, that I think everyone's still realizing, but, yeah, the seven day thing and, you know, instantly, like, hot protocol and all these figured out, you know, just using pools and whatnot. But there's, there's still a lot.
00:27:55.542 - 00:28:28.572, Speaker C: The cross chain trading and, and liquidity pool stuff across chain would be a big breakthrough, I think, because fragmented liquidity does suck for the end user. The best price for now is always going to be on Ethereum if you're trading in size, because there's a couple coins that are arbitrum only. That's actually another thing I've learned in this. There are actually people that live on a L2, and that's it. There's people that live on Arbitrum and refuse to touch Ethereum. They don't refuse, but they're just like, you know, the fees aren't worth it.
00:28:28.588 - 00:28:29.436, Speaker B: Why do I need to bridge.
00:28:29.460 - 00:28:47.836, Speaker C: Fees aren't worth it. Yeah, exactly. So they're like, oh, this coin launched on Arbitrum, I'm going to trade it because it's something new, right. And I wasn't able to, like, trade it on Ethereum. So there's all these worlds out there. I mean, Andy, this is something you and I talked about a long time ago. When NFTs launched, it's like ETH went from just like ETH and trading to now you had nfts, all these silos.
00:28:47.836 - 00:28:58.496, Speaker C: I feel like now there's, you know, I know you guys are still doing this full time, like, tracing and all on the podcast and stuff. But there's like 15 silos. I feel like at this point.
00:28:58.660 - 00:28:59.384, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
00:28:59.504 - 00:29:13.576, Speaker A: There is. And it's. It's very hard to keep up with everything, even though, like, I try to keep up with as much as I can. Like, the NfT stuff was just kind of crazy for me. And it's still. It still is. Like, I look at it, and I know you, both of you spent more time in it than I did.
00:29:13.576 - 00:29:24.204, Speaker A: I know, Eric, you were pretty big on nfts generally. But I look at it from the outside looking in, and I'm like, God, it just looks like tokens with. With pictures, as Kobe said once upon a time. Like, all coins with pictures, right?
00:29:24.784 - 00:29:27.208, Speaker B: It just looks like that ones are those.
00:29:27.376 - 00:29:51.328, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then I look at that, I'm like, you know what? I've done this so many times before. I've played this game. This is just not interesting to me at this point in my life. But I get why people are interested in it. I get why people get attached to it more than a token. You know, there's that whole concept of marrying the bag, like, marrying your nfts even more, I guess, like, is even stronger because it's a picture, right? You can relate to it, like, as a human.
00:29:51.328 - 00:30:22.804, Speaker A: Like, you've got an emotional attachment to it, especially if it's your profile picture. It's an even bigger emotional attachment. So I understand why NfT people are pretty rabid about their own collections, like the purple picture collections, and about how they, you know, them going down is like, they feel like a personal kind of attack on themselves when someone is, like, selling those pfps. Like, I know the whole blur thing where Blur was provide was enabling liquidity for these things, and people were like, oh, my God, it's Blur's fault. People are just farming the tokens. I'm like, look at the day. It's a market.
00:30:22.804 - 00:30:30.204, Speaker A: And if there was more demand for these things, then they wouldn't be going down. It's the same thing as any, any thing. And. And I get the whole token argument.
00:30:30.284 - 00:30:35.716, Speaker C: Blur just created, created an efficient market. That's all they did. They just sped up. They just sped up the downtrend.
00:30:35.820 - 00:31:04.708, Speaker A: Yeah. And by saying that it's blur's fault, you're essentially admitting that the market, the only reason why your things went up. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like, you're just admitting that that whole thing. But I understand the frustration because, as I said, people get really attached to these things, and I understand attachments to things that you identify with. Like, I'm very attached to ethereum. And when I see someone fighting Ethereum, like, I, I sometimes feel like it's a personal attack on me, even though it isn't just because I'm so emotionally involved with it.
00:31:04.708 - 00:31:38.408, Speaker A: But I don't think people generally felt that for a lot of tokens, because there are certain people that do the l one s especially, we've seen it play out, people get really attached to the l one s, but generally a lot of other tokens, people don't get emotionally attached to them as much as they do with nfts. And I think that's where a lot of the toxic stuff has come out of it. But at the end of the day, there are still collections out there that are worth a lot. Like crypto punks have actually held their value quite well. And that falls back to what we were talking about before. We were talking about punks doesn't have a roadmap. Punks is like the bitcoin of nfts where there's no roadmap, there's no expectations.
00:31:38.536 - 00:31:40.168, Speaker B: It's just work, right?
00:31:40.256 - 00:32:07.144, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's, it's just the punk. And I think when what, what failed with or what ended up happening with bored apes is that they attached a roadmap to it. They attached all these products to it, they attached expectations to it. And then people were like, well, if it's not executing on the roadmap, that's bearish for, for the board ape kind of pfps, and they sell them, whereas with punks, it's like, they're just punks, man. You know, you buy a punk that looks like you make your profile picture. Uh, so that's, that's me looking the outside looking in.
00:32:07.144 - 00:32:28.044, Speaker A: But like, I'm sure, uh, you guys have your own opinions on this, but, uh, generally, yeah, I don't spend too much time in the NFT. Anytime I talk about NFTs as well, people kind of like, comment me and like, you don't spend any time in our ecosystem. How can you have opinions on this? I'm like, well, because I know what markets are like, and markets, it doesn't matter what asset it is they have, it's the same thing. It's exactly the same thing every time.
00:32:28.924 - 00:33:10.038, Speaker B: I mean, people buy nfts for what they represent, right? Every single, like, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course. But like, you know, each different NFT tribe is a community, and it's attracted a certain set of people who express certain sets of ideas. And if you vibe with those ideas, maybe you want to buy one of those nfTs, right? It's like there are sneaker heads, there are watch people, and there are NFT people. And why did I buy a crypto punk? Oh, because someday one day on Twitter, I saw somebody give a take that crypto punks are for ETH maxis, who bought ether really early. I'm like, and like, I don't have a milady and I don't, I don't really vibe with a lady. I don't get the joke. So I don't have one.
00:33:10.038 - 00:33:11.354, Speaker B: And that's just the deal.
00:33:12.174 - 00:33:13.062, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:33:13.078 - 00:33:41.200, Speaker C: I definitely think a lot. I think long term, but nfTs. So I actually have a theory on NFTs that the next cycle will be around one of, one part. So I think PFPs was like the meme, meme coin launched NFTs, right? And it got ridiculous. And then I 100% agree. Every single NfT that had a roadmap got destroyed. I mean, the ultimate examples, of course, being like bored apes, moonbirds, doodles, they all have these big promises, roadmaps.
00:33:41.312 - 00:33:43.684, Speaker B: And huggy penguins is the exception.
00:33:44.144 - 00:33:54.160, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. They're still up there a little bit. Yeah. But a lot of these, and they even delivered on a lot of the roadmaps and still got absolutely destroyed. So I think they're pretty good.
00:33:54.192 - 00:33:56.728, Speaker B: I think they're like four or six. Four or five ETH. I think they're doing.
00:33:56.776 - 00:33:58.112, Speaker C: Yeah, they're stopped. There they are.
00:33:58.128 - 00:34:08.724, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even the other ones that delivered got destroyed as well. And I think what I was saying before about the destroying of that kind of like fantasy, narrative illusion, which is more powerful than the reality. Right.
00:34:09.184 - 00:34:58.144, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think, like, what everybody missed in the first NFT mania is the true benefit potential of nfts is from an artist's perspective, being able to launch your own brand and market from anywhere in the world and launch on foundation or, you know, whatever it might be, and cut out the middleman. That is like art galleries and the struggle of being an artist in India and reaching American people to show your art, to me, that is the true benefit of NFTs and this technology. I don't think people have really realized that yet because we got so obsessed with pfps pumping. I don't think that's where that space is going to end up. Maybe not five years. I mean, honestly, it could be a long play, 10, 20, 30 years.
00:34:58.144 - 00:35:09.524, Speaker C: Like art traditionally, hundreds of years to go through, like, changes and renaissance is and whatnot. I think we'll see that whole narrative shift from pfps to one of one art, for sure.
00:35:10.584 - 00:35:44.618, Speaker A: And, yeah, and I think it's, the pfps is one of one. And then there's also the collections as well of, like, artists like DC. Investor speaks a lot about this on Twitter, where he's got these collections that he has, has acquired and he's acquired the pieces that he believes are grails, as they, as they call them. And it's all about, I guess, like, the mimetics of it. Like, do enough people think that these things are cool? Collections are valuable collections like vibe with the artist, they vibe with the culture of it. And it's kind of, as you said, like it's in the eye of the beholder at the end of the day, whether these things succeed or die. But that can change over time.
00:35:44.618 - 00:36:15.178, Speaker A: Like, there are, you know, there is obviously with, with Vincent van Gogh, a lot of his paintings were considered crap when he was alive and then he died. And then over the, over time, they became some of the most valuable art pieces in the world. And I think that the same is going to happen to a lot of the stuff within, within NFT. It's probably not going to be pfps, as you said. It's definitely going to be like, these, one of ones, or they maybe these more curated art collections because they withstand the test of time. Again, they don't have a roadmap, right? They don't have products delivered. That is the art, is it, right.
00:36:15.178 - 00:36:35.946, Speaker A: Like I was saying before, punks, that's it. It's a punk. You buy it, you don't. You vibe with it, you don't. And those are the things that will typically probably last, as you said, hundreds and hundreds of years instead of fading away because they don't have any expectations they can survive on their own. They're a kind of self contained ecosystem rather than relying on external parties to drive. To kind of drive value to it.
00:36:35.946 - 00:36:46.458, Speaker A: But I mean, generally, I'm not someone who's into the art scene, so to speak. I mean, I am in a different way. Like, obviously, I collect my figurines, as we all know. Right. And that's a, that's a form of art.
00:36:46.506 - 00:36:49.018, Speaker C: What are those back there? Oh, yeah. Do I see them? Oh, yeah.
00:36:49.066 - 00:36:50.306, Speaker B: Do you have a few of those?
00:36:50.450 - 00:37:11.262, Speaker A: Yeah, just a few. Right. Um, but I think, yeah, that definitely, when it comes to, like, that, the, the, that kind of art, it's just not something that has traditionally vibed with me, but I understand, and for other people, why it does. And as you said, it's very subjective. I have the beholder sorts of things. So. So, yeah, but it's going to be interesting to see, like, the timescale as well, because crypto makes everything faster.
00:37:11.262 - 00:37:18.994, Speaker A: Like, will it make this faster? Like. Or will this just be another thing that takes a hundred years to play out? Like. Like traditionally art has?
00:37:19.654 - 00:37:27.806, Speaker B: There's a certain amount of irony of Anthony Cesano saying, I don't know. I'm not nfts. They're not really for me with an army of figurines behind him.
00:37:27.870 - 00:37:42.666, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think I've explained before that, like, it's more about. It's more about the vibe, like, the physical collectibles being around me. And like, that. That's a vibe. Like, I don't have anywhere to display my digital collectibles in the same way. Right? Like, maybe.
00:37:42.810 - 00:37:44.874, Speaker B: Sorry, on Twitter, man.
00:37:44.994 - 00:38:02.918, Speaker A: Yeah, but the thing is, is that it's like, there's, like, a separation from. From there. Like, I exist as a person in the physical world, right? My figurines exist with me on the same plane of existence with the digital collectibles. They exist in the digital world. I don't exist there yet, right? I don't have, like, full ar integration and VR integration. I'm not in that space all the time.
00:38:02.926 - 00:38:04.390, Speaker B: You're pretty plugged in, bro.
00:38:04.542 - 00:38:30.712, Speaker A: I am, but it's still. I'm looking at a screen, right? It's not, like, plugged into me. It's a weird kind of thing. I can't really describe it, but until that happens, I think if you live in a virtual world, I think it's different. But there have been digital collectibles or things that I've collected in the past. Like, when I was playing World of Warcraft, a lot. Like, I would get really excited about getting, like, a unique mount or a unique item or something, and I would get attached to that.
00:38:30.712 - 00:38:35.688, Speaker A: But that's because I could show it off in a world, in a virtual world that I spent a lot of time in, and it would be.
00:38:35.736 - 00:38:37.512, Speaker B: Virtual world is the Internet, dude.
00:38:37.568 - 00:38:58.704, Speaker A: Yes, but there's not. But there's not a central place. Besides maybe putting, like, a punk as my profile picture, there's not really that central kind of place that a lot of people kind of gather around, I think. You know, you say the Internet, but, like, the Internet is so many different places. I'm talking about, like, a defined actual space. Like. Like, you know what I mean? Like, there's a defined space in the physical world for art.
00:38:58.704 - 00:39:17.160, Speaker A: It's an art gallery, right? You go there and it's like a defined space for those things. Whereas the Internet is so many different, different areas, right? If I go and try to display my nfts on Reddit, they're gonna fucking destroy me. They're like, who are you? Like, why? You're a scammer, right? Fuck nfts. Whatever. If I do it on my own, nftars.
00:39:17.352 - 00:39:18.936, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:18.960 - 00:39:47.268, Speaker A: But I'm talking Reddit generally, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm talking about Reddit generally, though. If I go on Twitter, on crypto Twitter with my punk profile picture, people, you know, people will like that. But if I go to normal Twitter, they'll be like, ah, this guy's got a NFT profile picture, like the blue check thing. You go to Twitter that hates Elon and they're like, ah, blue check. Your opinion means nothing because you're paying Elon for Twitter, right? It's, it's, it's just, it depends on the community that you're in. And no one gave a shit about my unique wow items in like Runescape, for example, or in like guild wars.
00:39:47.268 - 00:40:13.370, Speaker A: They only cared about it in wow. So that's the way that's my kind of view on things is like, unless there's a defined actual virtual space, like, I guess bored apes tried to do it with their game that they're making where you can go there and you can be your bored ape character and stuff like that. It just doesn't vibe with me and how I view these things. I know other people are different, but that's just how I generally view it. But the physical figurines just vibes with me. I don't know, I just like being around. I like organizing them and everything.
00:40:13.370 - 00:40:15.250, Speaker A: So, yeah, definitely.
00:40:15.322 - 00:40:21.754, Speaker C: I get it. I do get it. I think, I do think. Well, metaverse got overly hyped and we're probably still a long way away from whatever.
00:40:21.794 - 00:40:26.134, Speaker A: I didn't even use that word, but that literally was, I was literally describing that the entire time.
00:40:26.914 - 00:41:05.532, Speaker C: I mean, once we get there, and that does represent kind of your identity in that space. I do think that would be a huge boom for nfts because you can prove ownership, they're rare and stuff like that. So I do get that, like right now. I mean, the Twitter implementing nft thing was huge, right? Like, people do want to display those. And if you see like, like an account with a punk, but it's not, you know, the hexagon, you're kind of, like, eh, like, it does actually mean a lot. Right? Um, so I do think having that, like, digital proof of, like, you could print out your punk and put in your house and stuff, and, like, if you ripped someone else's punk off and put it on your wall, it'd be kind of douchey. So, like, you know, people probably believe that you actually own it.
00:41:05.532 - 00:41:32.744, Speaker C: But of course, there is, like, a boom in, like, nft led displays, which I do think is pretty cool. You can, like, load up your wallet and to cycle through. So we're getting there. But, yeah, I totally agree. I mean, so I will say one thing. I don't want to trash PFPs too hard, because I do think some will bounce back. And one thing I'm seeing is just them being used for, like, brand identity for communities like that.
00:41:32.744 - 00:42:13.394, Speaker C: That's a big one, right? Whether, like, a project launches them themselves and everyone kind of rallies behind that, or just, hey, I'm a crypto punk, or, hey, I'm a lady, or, hey, I'm whatever that really brings people together on Twitter and kind of identifies you. And I think that can still be a really big boom for pfps. I'm not saying all pfps are going to zero. I'm still hyper bullish punks. I still have my punks, in my opinion, still going up, and they've held value. Well, just like, crypto 95% might go to zero, but there'll still be a place for pfps. And I think one of the big things is around that kind of, like, identity, community identity thing.
00:42:14.014 - 00:42:45.030, Speaker B: I think you guys are both totally underselling how much we already live in the metaverse anyways. And just, like, the raw significance of the PFP across all Internet rooms. Like, you can take your punk and you can put it on as your PFP on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Reddit, on, I don't know, give me something else. Pinterest, right? Like LinkedIn, the Pf, LinkedIn. I have my punk as my PFP on LinkedIn. I think Eric does, too. The PFP is huge.
00:42:45.030 - 00:43:01.670, Speaker B: And, like, why do people wear rolexes to flex? Do you have so much flex surface area as the PFP? It's like I. And like, Anthony, I know you're like, yeah, you need a dedicated spot. I don't think you do, bro. It's like, that's the Internet, man. Like, we're on the Internet. That is the spot.
00:43:01.742 - 00:43:02.406, Speaker A: It is the place.
00:43:02.470 - 00:43:03.518, Speaker B: That is the first.
00:43:03.646 - 00:43:38.222, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I don't disagree with you, but at the same time, like, yeah, I spend a lot of time online, so to speak, right? And on the Internet and things like that. But I still don't, like, physically feel, like, connected to that space, like I do to my space around me. Right? Like, it's a subjective thing. It's not going to be different for everyone, right? And maybe it's a generational thing, too. Maybe people that are, like, younger than us, like. Like, in their teens right now, maybe they feel a much stronger connection to the digital world, right? Because it's like they've grown up with it from literally when they were born, basically. Like, I think for millennials, it's a bit different, like, for us.
00:43:38.222 - 00:43:40.418, Speaker A: David, are you a millennial? Eric? I don't even know.
00:43:40.466 - 00:43:40.866, Speaker B: I don't.
00:43:40.930 - 00:43:41.866, Speaker A: I think you are.
00:43:42.010 - 00:43:43.454, Speaker B: He's an elder millennial.
00:43:44.234 - 00:43:46.506, Speaker C: We're younger millennial, whatever the hell that is.
00:43:46.570 - 00:43:51.114, Speaker A: You know that much older than. Yeah, you know that much older than us. You're, like, five years older than me.
00:43:51.154 - 00:43:53.770, Speaker C: But I think 36 in crypto is.
00:43:53.802 - 00:43:56.370, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you're a boomer.
00:43:56.402 - 00:43:56.874, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:56.994 - 00:44:16.084, Speaker A: But I think there's that kind of thing of, like, we came in, like, halfway, right? The Internet was, like, booming when we were teenagers, whereas for these people that are now teenagers, it was always there. There was always online. Like, Wi Fi is everywhere for them. You know, they don't even call it the Internet. They call it Wi Fi a lot of the time, right. Because it's just there. Yeah, man.
00:44:16.084 - 00:44:26.876, Speaker A: The young people I've spoken to, they don't call it the Internet. They say, do you have Wi Fi? Or. I'm on the Wi Fi or whatever. Right. It's just. It's a whole thing for them, right? So they grew up with that. They grew up with tech.
00:44:26.876 - 00:44:55.442, Speaker A: They grew up with, like, iPads and phones in their hand from a young age. So I think for them, their connection to it, because it's. It's formulated in their formative years, will be a lot stronger. But for me, being, like, in the halfway point, I spend a lot of time online. I do have connections in some worlds, but the physical space is still, I don't know, something that I vibe with a lot stronger. And that's why I have a study with figurines in it everywhere and other such collectibles, so. And from that perspective, I mean, I wear watches as well.
00:44:55.442 - 00:45:07.794, Speaker A: I wear nice watches as well. I mean, you said it was the flex. I do it for not really flexing purpose. I do it because I love, love. I love watches. But that's another physical thing at the same time. So I think you gotta, you gotta look at it from that perspective as well.
00:45:07.794 - 00:45:21.178, Speaker A: But it's also very subjective. So my opinion is gonna be very different to yours. Someone else's. Some people are never gonna vibe with it. Like, my parents are probably never gonna vibe with that at all, even though they're online a lot of the time as well. They're a different type of online. My dad's online.
00:45:21.178 - 00:45:38.926, Speaker A: Cause he's watching his, uh, AFL, which is, um, australian rules football games. Right. He's only, he's doing that all the time on his phone and stuff like that. He's watching like clips of people talking about the players and things like that. That, whereas, like, I never do that. But he's never going to go into the NFT stuff. He's never going to go into crypto, Twitter or anything like that.
00:45:38.926 - 00:45:50.314, Speaker A: So there's different communities. That's why I say staying the Internet, it just doesn't really define anything. Like, it's just, it's too big. Right. And there's defined areas in the Internet for different types of people.
00:45:51.774 - 00:46:33.208, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I definitely think it'll be the younger generations that adopt NFts in the long term for what they. For what you're both saying, like, you guys are kind of saying the same thing. David's saying it's already a digital identity to me, Anthony, you're saying you don't quite feel that yet, but you get it. I think we'll get there. It's more being able to prove across, like, right now, anybody can upload a PFP to LinkedIn and claim it's them, right? So getting these platforms to kind of unite around that will take a long time. I do want to say, though, I think we grew up in one of the coolest generations because early in life we didn't have the Internet, we didn't really have computers. And we got to see that world and we got to see the transition to, I feel like growing up now.
00:46:33.208 - 00:46:44.512, Speaker C: This is like the most boomer thing ever to say, though. Like, growing up only knowing, like, how the world is today with the Internet and media. Like, I'm glad I had those early years of not having that.
00:46:44.568 - 00:46:44.808, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:44.856 - 00:46:49.880, Speaker C: Like, actually playing outside and not like, being attached to a phone and stuff like that.
00:46:49.912 - 00:46:53.104, Speaker B: I think we had trading shibu inu, Obama sonic coin.
00:46:53.184 - 00:46:58.284, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Somehow I ended up that there at 36. Go figure.
00:46:59.254 - 00:47:03.434, Speaker A: Well, that's the thing you've shown that even boomers can get with the cool kids. Right?
00:47:04.294 - 00:47:04.830, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:47:04.862 - 00:47:33.438, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's the thing. Like, it's always going to be the same thing for anything, really. There's always the generational divides and splits for various different reasons. And I think the world just routes around that and people just pay attention and do things that they want to do. But there are. Yeah, there are those transition periods, right? There's those big transition periods that happen and it takes decades to happen, but then it snowballs pretty quickly and it becomes just a way of life for people. You know, there are people hundreds of years ago that didn't have anything close to what we have today.
00:47:33.438 - 00:48:17.994, Speaker A: You know, it's funny, there are, there's kind of like something that I read where people say even like, the poorest person in a first world country lives better than a lot of people, you know, that were considered middle class, I guess you could call them like 100 years ago or something like that, right? Just because of the stuff that we have access to and things like that. Like there are, there are literally like homeless people who have phones and the Internet. They have access to the same Internet that we do, right? They have access to those same kind of services there, and they're living better because of that, if you, if you really want to put it in that frame of mind than people did back in, you know, even just 100 years ago. So I think society routes around those things and evolves. But there are growing pains, for sure. And the growing pains take many, many, many forms. But yeah, it's going to be interesting.
00:48:17.994 - 00:48:34.690, Speaker A: I would say that overall, I'm not bearish on NFTs as a category, obviously, but it's, it's the same with anything. Like, I'm not bearish on tokens, but I'm bearish on 99% of tokens, right, of like, arc 20 tokens because they're not good investments. But the concept of a token strike.
00:48:34.782 - 00:48:53.014, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's probably like some very small subset of NFTs are going to come back, like 5% or less. And the ones that do are going to be bangers. And you have your safe ones, like crypto punks. Like, I don't think anyone's betting against crypto punks, but the ones that are dead, better than dead, some might come back.
00:48:53.514 - 00:49:01.014, Speaker A: Punks can become a thing where it's like a generational thing where you hand down your punk to your kid. That's where the value really shines, right? Where it becomes across generations.
00:49:02.274 - 00:49:06.810, Speaker C: That's my plan. Like, that is my plan. Like, you hit it, you hit the nail on the head.
00:49:06.842 - 00:49:08.854, Speaker B: Like to me, family air punk.
00:49:09.154 - 00:49:11.954, Speaker C: Yeah, Van Gogh or whatever.
00:49:12.034 - 00:49:12.322, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:12.378 - 00:49:20.334, Speaker C: So I mean, there's, there's a few things that, you know, are gonna stay and be big. And to me, punks is there's just no doubt about it.
00:49:20.714 - 00:49:21.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:49:21.514 - 00:49:27.414, Speaker B: And family that's just known to own a punk. Oh, the Connor family, they own a punk.
00:49:27.954 - 00:49:57.254, Speaker C: Yeah, it's the family alerting things about that. One of the more interesting things about that is how you can't lose. Well, you can lose them, of course, but like a lot of famous art has been just destroyed over time. Right. But one of the more interesting things when it comes to punks or like famous NFT art is that can't happen. Not sure if bullish or bearish. I mean, if you're an actual holder that kept like onto a good piece of art and kept it nice, that would be bullish for you in the past if people lost it.
00:49:57.794 - 00:50:20.170, Speaker A: Yeah. The different quality of things, right. Like can determine their value and that's the thing. Yeah, I mean, the trading card things, something that I spend a lot of time in and yeah, there's like a massive jump in price between like something that's rated a nine and something that's rated at ten. And it depends on the supply and how many of those things are available. But I guess with NFTs as the quality issue doesn't exist. That's more of like the traits people look at.
00:50:20.170 - 00:50:39.288, Speaker A: Right. And there's like how rare is this trait and stuff like that. But using punks as the example. Right. Is the perfect example there. The rarest punks are the ones that have like the apes and the aliens, you know, but the quality thing is not, that doesn't exist. I mean, you could, you could program that in at the smart contract level where like quality would degrade over time.
00:50:39.288 - 00:50:59.616, Speaker A: If your address does something, you know, does an action or your address has a failed transaction, okay. The quality of your NFT is now degraded because of that. I don't know, I'm thinking of the top of my head, but generally I don't think anyone's really going to do that. So, yeah, the quality remains the same. Awesome. Awesome. Well, yeah, I think on that note, we can end it there for today.
00:50:59.616 - 00:51:04.184, Speaker A: So, yeah, thank you both for, for joining. Thank you, David, for joining as a special guest for today.
00:51:04.304 - 00:51:05.538, Speaker B: Thanks for inviting me, guys.
00:51:05.666 - 00:51:08.466, Speaker A: Yeah, we've done a lot of content over the last few days together.
00:51:08.650 - 00:51:17.458, Speaker B: Yeah, I've done many podcasts, multiple podcasts inside of the same day. But I've never done multiple podcasts with the same person in the same day. So that's a new record for me.
00:51:17.626 - 00:51:27.842, Speaker A: Bullish. Bullish, my friends. All right, well, thank you, everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet. Give it a thumbs up and we'll be back next time. Maybe with David, maybe not. I don't know.
00:51:27.842 - 00:51:31.314, Speaker A: Uh, we'll see. We'll see you next time. But, yeah, thanks, everyone. Cheers, guys.
