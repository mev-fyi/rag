00:00:00.760 - 00:00:08.994, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the deli Gray drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Susano. I'm here today with Eric Conner to talk about all things crypto. Hey, Eric, how you going?
00:00:09.774 - 00:00:23.942, Speaker B: Good, good, yeah. We're getting in a groove here, right? I think we had to take a little bit of a break for some travel we were both doing, but we're not rugging. I think this is fourth now. Last one, I guess, was with David, but we seem to be in a good groove here.
00:00:24.118 - 00:00:33.318, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we are. We're doing good, which is great. I think David's too busy fighting people on Twitter to join us today. But no, no, he's all good. He's all good.
00:00:33.406 - 00:00:35.350, Speaker B: Or burning man, maybe.
00:00:35.502 - 00:00:38.070, Speaker A: Yeah, he did go to Burning man. Yeah.
00:00:38.102 - 00:00:38.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:38.302 - 00:01:19.598, Speaker A: So I think that since the last time we spoke, there's been a lot of movements, I guess, like with the ETF stuff, which was kind of the first thing I wanted to. Want to talk about and wanted to cover for people who haven't followed along with, I guess, the latest in that world. I mean, I think we obviously had that big win. You know, Grayscale won their lawsuit against the SEC for the SEC to basically take another look at Grayscale's conversion of their existing trust, the GBTC trust, to a spot BTC ETF, we've obviously had after that, the ETF's that are existing, the existing ETF applications be delayed, which was to be expected. Of course. No one expected those things to be approved. And for those of you who don't know, the final approval dates for those things are in March.
00:01:19.598 - 00:01:44.846, Speaker A: For most of them, there is one that has an approval date in January, but it's march for the vast majority of them. The next approval deadline is October. So we might see a delay there as well. Love to see how that shakes out. But also in, I guess, like non BTC ETF news. We also had van Eck and Mark recently filed their ETH spot ETF applications, which, I mean, to me it wasn't surprising. We've always said that BTC and ETH are both going to get ETF's.
00:01:44.846 - 00:02:29.234, Speaker A: It's just a matter of time. I personally think the odds of the BTC ETF getting approved approaching 100% for next year. This year, it's kind of a coin toss, like it could happen this year, but it feels like it's more likely to happen next year. And a fun thing about that is that if it happens in, like, March of next year, where they all get approved, that's like one month before the bitcoin halvening, which is just pretty amazing coincidence considering that a lot of people think that the harbinging leads to the start of a new bull market. And traditionally that has been the case with this four year cycle. But I think I wanted to hit on both of those topics. But generally with the ETF stuff, what do you think? What kind of odds did you put on ETF's this year versus next year? And do you agree that theyre inevitable?
00:02:30.294 - 00:03:06.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I think im basically at the 95% that they're going to happen this year. I mean, there's a lot of like tailwinds with some legal wins. Right. And like, I'm not an expert in this stuff, but we had the XRP win against the SEC a few months back. We recently had like the grayscale win against them a few weeks ago where basically they can, and I don't know all this like legal language, but they can basically like convert their, they won the lawsuit saying they wanted to convert their trust to an ETF or something like that. But it almost doesn't matter to me. Right.
00:03:06.500 - 00:03:37.348, Speaker B: Like the fact that we're winning. I'm saying we like crypto community is winning. Lawsuits against the US government is just bullish in general. And I think at this point it's just gotten so crypto, like when we were first talking about ETF's like on our podcast four years ago, right. We didn't have much support in Congress and the US government, like crypto, was still very nascent and young. And now it's become a bipartisan, it's become a partisan issue. Right.
00:03:37.348 - 00:04:16.096, Speaker B: So you're seeing like, not every Republican, not every Democrat is on one way or the other, but in general, you're kind of seeing the Democrats right now be a bit anti crypto and heavy on the regulation side. You're seeing the Republicans in the US kind of pushing more pro crypto stance. It has become an issue. I mean, the president of the United States has stood up there in press conferences and speeches and called out like crypto, like whatever, tax evaders or something, and they were just talking about like wash training. Right. But it has become a political issue. And anytime that happens, but it's good for us because now you're going to have one side fighting for you.
00:04:16.096 - 00:04:18.200, Speaker B: And this is just how us politics works.
00:04:18.232 - 00:04:18.400, Speaker A: Right?
00:04:18.432 - 00:05:01.504, Speaker B: We have two parties. One side says, oh, we like this. The other side says, okay, since you like it, we hate it, which is just mind blowingly stupid and I hate it. But that just is how us politics work. And since we kind of have this talking point now of crypto and other countries kind of pushing it forward and saying, okay, you can do ETF's. Like Canada, for example, has crypto ETF's. I think it's just becoming almost ridiculous, I think is the right word for the US to be so behind now and just adopting this, I hate using the comparison and the meme of what if the US heavily regulated the Internet back in the day, but I do think it's pretty relevant.
00:05:01.504 - 00:05:41.118, Speaker B: The US economy today is in a huge boom and has been for the last decades because we were very open to the Internet and adoption of anything that was built on the Internet. And all the companies that came along and were still seeing that today. Right. Everyone talks about fang stocks and all these tech companies at a point I think the US will realize, hey, we cant let this is real. We cant let these other countries take our talent and our money from us and theyll have to wake up. The partisan issue of crypto is that first stage of that. I think we're there.
00:05:41.118 - 00:05:59.734, Speaker B: Gensler's lost too many battles now in court. And at this point, come on. The old excuse was the market can be easily manipulated. That was the old ETf rejection three, four years ago. That's just not the case anymore. No one can go manipulate the bitcoin market by themselves. That's impossible.
00:05:59.734 - 00:06:22.326, Speaker B: Liquidity is too high. Trading is too high. It's everywhere. So I just don't know what their excuse would be now. That was the old excuse I dont think would hold up anymore. And now if they reject them, youre going to have like 50% of Congress saying, ok, what the hell is going on? Which that wasnt the case back in the day. So, I mean, long story short, to sum it up, I think the tailwinds are too strong.
00:06:22.326 - 00:06:29.834, Speaker B: I think theyre going through, and I think the market has severely underpriced the impact of them.
00:06:30.654 - 00:07:20.900, Speaker A: Trey? Yeah, I mean, I totally agree with the market impact, which I think well get to. But the other kind of important point here, I think, over what were saying about how the SEC has traditionally denied these things due to market manipulation concerns. The important point, I think, for people to realize here is a lot of the trading volumes of crypto is actually coming back to the US now and back to the more regulated and legitimate markets rather than on offshore exchanges. Obviously, we had the collapse of FTX where, I mean, their trading volume obviously went to zero. And then binance is actually facing a lot of headwinds in the world, not just within the US but also in Europe. Theyve had a lot of their licenses revoked or not approved and a lot of their market share is going down. So I think that should definitely appease the SEC for them to say, okay, well, a lot of this trading is actually happening on heavily regulated us based platforms.
00:07:20.900 - 00:08:23.404, Speaker A: A lot of the volumes are there, a lot of the liquidity is there. So if they were to deny it based on market manipulation concerns, again, they would then have to defend that position if challenged in court and basically say, well, we think that the market is not big enough and it's being manipulated on us regulated exchanges, which just opens another whole can of worms here. So I think that if you take that perspective and look at it from, from that kind of point of view, you start to realize that the SEC really doesn't have any legs left to stand on to deny these things when it's, specifically when it comes to the BTC ETF, obviously with the ETH one, it's a bit merle murky because Gary Gensler has gone on record and said that he thinks everything except BTC is a security. But I honestly think that he's going to lose that fight and continue to lose that fight as he has been in court. Obviously, the XRP win was a big signal there, but ETH generally, I mean, I feel like it's, it's basically impossible for them to prove in any which way that ETH is a security. Even if they wanted to prove that the crowd sale was a investment contract, it would be extremely difficult because I mean, the crowd sale was not done in the US, right? It was done extra us. It was a long time ago now.
00:08:23.404 - 00:09:01.852, Speaker A: And I don't think they'd be able to find any people that bought the ethic ICO that felt hard done by or wronged by the ethic ICO. So it would, it would be difficult in my mind to, to kind of go after that. But on the, on the market impact front, I mean, I mean, I think a lot of people are confused by this. I actually have watched a few of these kind of traders lately on YouTube just to get the vibe check from them. And they obviously look at all the different levels on the chart and the technical analysis that they do and everything, and all of them are like, wow, okay, we had this grayscale win. The price went up a lot, but then it went not a lot, but the price spiked, right. But then it sold down and actually ended up lower than before the win.
00:09:01.852 - 00:09:26.174, Speaker A: And they're all confused. They're all like, this should have pushed us higher. I'm like, but the thing is that the reason it didnt is because the liquidity right now in the ecosystem is very low. Theres no new money coming in. It is the same traders playing against each other. It is what people like to call a PvP or player versus player environment, where everyone knows the game, everyone knows theres no new money coming in. So everyones too sophisticated and just playing against each other for scraps, basically.
00:09:26.174 - 00:10:02.126, Speaker A: So if you want to play against each other in a player versus environment game and you want to play that out, you need new money coming in. And I think that the new money is not going to come in until next year, at least in my mind. Um, I think that plays into the four year cycle that everyone talks about. And this is the next topic that I wanted to cover, leading on from the ETF stuff, where there has been this four year cycle based on the bitcoin harvening for as long as bitcoin has existed. If you go look at the charts, it actually plays out quite perfectly. The 20 2012, um, uh, kind of, uh, crap, uh, start of a bull market into 2013. Um, that and the 20 2012 was the harvesting year.
00:10:02.126 - 00:10:42.762, Speaker A: 2016 harvening year into the 2017 bull market, 2020 harvening into the 2021 bull market. And now we're having 2024 halvening into a potential 2025 bull market. Right, but the bull market tends to start in the harvening year and then just go crazy in the following year. But that's what you need for the new money to come in for those kind of cycles to play out, for it to become a self fulfilling prophecy. Because even the people who don't believe in the four year cycle will still probably buy as a hedge to be like, maybe I'm wrong, right? So I'm going to buy anyway. And then what ends up happening is that you break these kind of ranges that the price has been stuck in for quite a while. So there's these kind of crab market ranges.
00:10:42.762 - 00:11:12.402, Speaker A: For ETH, it's like one to two k. For BTC, it's like 20 to. If you sustainably break above that, it becomes a kind of snowball effect from there. And then all the narratives obviously come into play, and we get the bull market again. So I think that right now, that's what kind of everyone's waiting for and waiting to play out. It's like that harbinging four year cycle. But I'm curious, Eric, if you are like, a pro four year cycle guy? Or do you think that it's not going to play out like that this time because of maybe macroeconomic factors, which is something that people bring up? I'm just curious for your thoughts there.
00:11:12.402 - 00:11:17.094, Speaker A: And just to be clear, I actually believe in the four year cycle still. I think it's going to play out exactly the same way.
00:11:17.994 - 00:12:16.562, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's become so, I think, I don't like when people like, take charts and they're like, oh, this happened in the past, so this is going to exactly happen like that. I think if you step back and take the larger four year cycle view, I actually do think it will play out this time. I don't know if it'll happen next time just because like, everything has to perfectly align, kind of like you were saying, right? Like macro environment has to kind of line up. You have to have like a lull at year two, three that like, goes like macros pumping in year four. Like, you're not going to, for example, let's say, like, next time, like not this cycle, next four year cycle, like, right as we're going into like this point, like, or this could happen this time, I guess. But there's like a huge, like, ebola outbreak or something, like, or like World War three starts, right? Like the four year cycle isn't that strong. Um, but I think right now, in years, whatever we are, three and a half of this cycle, um, everything is aligning perfectly enough to where it's going to become a self fulfilling prophecy.
00:12:16.562 - 00:12:54.706, Speaker B: And a lot of like, ta on graphs or like, memes like this are just self fulfilling. Like you're saying, like, people are like, they just start believing it, and then everyone in crypto is talking about it. And then, like, your neighbor starts talking about the four year cycle, and then everyone starts buying. You're like, oh, four year cycle work. But really it's because, I mean, it's a meme at the end of the day, right? But like, memes run this entire market, but it does make sense. And the habiting is kind of, as much as I hate the habiting, and so zero IQ, but zero IQ works. I'd rather be left or right, curve nowhere in the middle and the middle would say, oh, the habit doesn't really have any impact, blah, blah, blah.
00:12:54.706 - 00:13:35.554, Speaker B: And I'll tweet this all the time. No one's actually thinking about security policy, but that's not what mainstream is thinking of. They're thinking, oh, there's less bitcoin being made. And my bitcoin is going to be more valuable at this point in time to left curve that for sure, which I think the entire bitcoin community is left curving everything these days. But I think it will be a catalyst. Im not too worried about macro. I mean, yeah, theres some weird stuff going on in the markets around rates and debt and is inflation really going to go away? And I think the average American is working a lot more hours and making a lot less money.
00:13:35.554 - 00:14:11.444, Speaker B: Theres a lot of weird things. But at the end of the day, and I say this all the time to friends offline, the stock market will lead and that'll lead crypto. And where do people have to put their money? It's either in housing or the stock market. Where else are you going to put it these days? Maybe savings, but I feel like everyone's just over earning a small and straight. We're in this new stage of markets where people want to chase things. You know, the age of information moving so fast. Like, not many people are just like putting money in a 4% savings account anymore, right.
00:14:11.444 - 00:14:44.716, Speaker B: Theyre trying to find the next Gamestop or the next ETH or the next bitcoin. And I think every time you look back at a crypto cycle, like, I was just looking at the ETH chart right around when we started pumping last, we had like the double dump. We had like the Defi collapse that we had, the COVID collapse both went to like $80. It started like kind of going up. And if you look at that graph, there were multiple times where we kind of just like black this stuff out, right. But we had gone up to like 300, 400. We were about to break out and like went back down and kind of went all the way back to like 200.
00:14:44.716 - 00:15:16.804, Speaker B: Multiple weeks of like lull and sideways and people kind of forget. That always happens before the next cycle begins. It's like the final shakeout. Like everyone was to kind of get that final bargain price on the buyer side, and you're kind of shaking out those final, like non believers. And I truly believe that's what's happening with price now. Like, I guess I'll caveat. This was saying, like, if we're war III breaks out or something like that tomorrow, that will nuke any of these thesis thesi, but I think we're good.
00:15:16.804 - 00:15:44.524, Speaker B: It's when it'll actually happen. So I love Labor Day as a trader and as a crypto holder, because in the US, that marks the, I guess for anybody not in the US, Labor Day just happened on Monday. Kind of marks the end of summer for most people in the United States. And I think most people return to their caves and start trading crypto again. They're back online. They come inside. I think that always aligns pretty well.
00:15:44.524 - 00:16:18.544, Speaker B: I've seen monthly trends for crypto and I think most of the bullish months are usually in the winter. The US winter. I know you're an upside down land over there, but which is funny, we were just talking about this before we started recording, but at least in the US winter, I think most of the months between, I want to say it's November and March or some of the most bullish on average, something like that. I could be totally off there. Yeah, I think the meme is real. I think 1650 at the end of the day is still a pretty good price for ETH. We would have taken that for sure years ago.
00:16:18.544 - 00:16:28.784, Speaker B: But I'll say it again, I think 15k is in play for me for the top on this next cycle, the exact day it starts. I don't know, but I think it's coming.
00:16:29.964 - 00:17:06.098, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the meme point is super interesting, where essentially people dont realize that a meme is really just an encapsulation of attention. So if you have attention on something, its more than likely when it comes to markets, that thing is going to go up in price. We see this play out even in the bear market and the crab market with these meme coins that we spoke about last time with David Hoffman on the show. These meme coins are just attention games. At the end of the day, can you get attention on your coin? The more attention you get, the more money you get and the higher the token goes. I think when it comes to things outside of meme coins, just a general crypto cycle.
00:17:06.098 - 00:17:52.226, Speaker A: The reason why it falls into a four year cycle, I think. I think theres maybe a couple of different reasons. But the major reason is obviously the harvening thats an attention sink that gets everyones attention because its a meme that says, okay, well, theres going to be less bitcoin to buy now. And then people think, okay, well logically the price is going to go up because of that, which obviously isnt a guaranteed thing, but it is a self fulfilling prophecy if enough people believe that. And then if it happens every time, which it has happened, more and more people believe that its going to happen again. And as I said, it becomes that self fulfilling thing. And then of course, as the BTC price goes up, you get more and more people in because starts sustainably going up and then when it hits all time high, media frenzy begins, bull market goes, goes crazy and then you get everything else kind of going crazy as well because the attention is squarely on crypto right now in the crab market, the stocks markets going up.
00:17:52.226 - 00:18:20.586, Speaker A: So where do you think the attention is in markets right now? It's in stocks, right? It's not in crypto. Like right now, crypto is just too dead for people to care about. Even though ironically it's the best, probably the best time to be buying. Most people are not looking at crypto right now. The attention is on stocks. And I actually think I mentioned this on one of our previous episodes. But if you look at what the stock market was doing in like 2019, 2020, while BTC and ETH was still range bound in their crab market range, the aspects was going to new all time highs for the better part of like twelve months.
00:18:20.586 - 00:18:55.378, Speaker A: Right. So if you look at that and look at what crypto is doing now and look at what the SP's XPX is doing, is basically on the verge of breaking through a new all time high soon. And it could happen towards the end of the year while crypto still stays in its low. But then what happens is that crypto starts going up, right? We break out of the crab ranges and then the attention shifts back and people start thinking, oh, wow, crypto is back, crypto is not dead. And they start hearing about people making overnight millions and stuff like that, and they plow in thinking theyre going to do that. And thats when you get the proper bull market that pumps everything. So I think that at the end of the day, the meme is just a conduit for attention.
00:18:55.378 - 00:19:25.074, Speaker A: And attention is the most scarce resource when it comes to markets. And if youre able to capture the attention, youre able to capture the market action. I think thats the four year. Thats just the cycle playing out in any markets. But I think people are confused right now about that, where they think, oh, the stocks going up, why isnt crypto going up? Because no ones paying attention. The crypto right now, no one wants to buy. So I think for a lot of people, if they buy ETH right now and then you tell them, well, it's probably going to be a little while before you make a return on that.
00:19:25.074 - 00:19:56.384, Speaker A: They're not going to want that. They want to see something going up. They want quick gains, they want quick turnaround, especially in, as you mentioned, this high paced, always online society that we're in. And crypto lends itself really well to that when it actually is doing that, because crypto moves extremely quickly when it's in a bull market. But I just think it's going to be a time thing. And I think you're right about the US summer, the european, so I guess like northern hemisphere summer, I should say, being pretty good time for Mark, sorry, winter being a pretty good time for markets and the summer being a pretty bad time. We actually see that reflected.
00:19:56.384 - 00:20:20.188, Speaker A: There's a kind of graphic that I saw which measures all the monthly performance of BTC since basically inception. And September is usually like a lull month where it's basically sideways. I mean, it could go negative 5% or up 5%. But what people need to realize is that that measures the beginning of the month to the end of the month. Inside that month, the price can go down like 20% and then come back up. Right. And still end the month mutually.
00:20:20.188 - 00:21:03.828, Speaker A: So I think looking at month on month returns is only maybe good for a kind of longer term thing where you take the months together, not looking at them individually. But yeah, if you take the kind of winter months together or the colder months together, its definitely more bullish, especially at the start of the year. The start of the year is actually bullish most of the time for really any kind of asset class as long as the asset class isnt kind of already in a bull market towards the end of the previous year, going into a bear market. So if youre talking just like normal kind of market conditions and regular kind of stuff there on a longer time horizon, thats kind of what happens. And I think the new year stuff is also a kind of phenomenon where a new year happens and people feel like more hope for the year, right. Because theyre like, Im washing away the old. Yeah.
00:21:03.828 - 00:21:41.242, Speaker A: You know, its a new year now. I have all these hopes and dreams and that happens just psychologically and I think that that makes people more prone to taking on more risk. Theyre like, oh, Im going to buy crypto because this year is my year. Crypto is going to go, going to go nuts, whatever it is. So, yeah, and when it comes back to like the four year cycle, if you just look at the charts, it's playing out exactly the same. 2023 is basically a mirror of 2019, just with less volatility. People don't remember this, but in 2019, the reason why BTC and ETH went up so much was because of this ponzi called plus token, which was a massive ponzi run out of China that sucked in billions and billions of new money, right.
00:21:41.242 - 00:22:22.878, Speaker A: New money came in billions of billions of new money into dollars worth of new money into BTC. See, in ETH, these people ended up being arrested that were running plus token and those assets seized. So, of course, once the Ponzi shut down, the market came off of that. And 2019 was also one of those kind of like, recovery years after the brutal 2018 bear market. But the plus token Ponzi just sent us a lot higher than it would, and that resulted in BTC basically dumping 50% towards the end of the year. ETH retraced its entire pump that year, which is pretty brutal. But, yeah, that just spoke to the fact that there was new money coming in, but it was concentrated in this plus token thing, which means that it was just basically sold down once that happened like that.
00:22:22.878 - 00:23:19.418, Speaker A: So I think even though that happened in 2019 and not in 2023, just from pure market sentiment and the way the markets have acted in 2023, it just very much the same as 2019. So if that's playing out again, you make the prediction. Okay, well, history doesn't repeat exactly, but it does rhyme. So is 2024 going to be a repeat of 2020 where maybe we won't have a COVID dump? Because that's like a black swan thing, unless another kind of thing like that happens? I don't think that's going to happen. So do we have, like, just an uptrending year in 2024 where we climb that wall of worry where we start breaking out of those long term ranges where ETH goes back to three k? I mean, ETH hasn't been at three k since April of last year. So if it doesn't get back to three k until, I don't know, second half of next year, that's like, over two years of range being broken, and that becomes a very powerful kind of moving force to the upside. And I think then the bull market kind of kicks off from there.
00:23:19.418 - 00:23:23.774, Speaker A: But, yeah, that's my general kind of view on the four year cycle and how it all plays into things.
00:23:24.394 - 00:23:31.778, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, the funniest thing that people always say is, like, what's going to be the next catalyst for bull? Right. The reality is just price going up. Price goes up.
00:23:31.826 - 00:23:33.594, Speaker A: Exactly. It's like a circular thing.
00:23:33.634 - 00:23:50.424, Speaker B: Right, exactly. Yeah. You get media coverage and, like, the ultimate meme to me always has been are, like, family or friends texting me about crypto and the second. So right now, I don't think I've got a single text about crypto in, like, 18 months.
00:23:50.504 - 00:23:50.816, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:50.880 - 00:24:13.604, Speaker B: So you just know you're in the same. Yeah. Yeah, right. It's crazy. And then like at the same time, that's what, that's a signal to buy because, you know, at some point that's changing. And then like, as it goes up, I got like a few like family friend that are pretty good at it. Like as it starts to heat up, right? They're like text and be like, oh, I'm thinking about getting back in and they're still kind of early.
00:24:13.604 - 00:24:47.048, Speaker B: And then there's the mid tier where you're like, okay, things are like build text and it's getting a little overheated. And then you got like the top textures right where you're like, okay, we got to fucking sell everything. We got to get out. And it's funny because that last cycle played out in nfts too, where all of a sudden people were texting about nfts and no one has texted me about nfts in forever. But it's, if you turn on like CNBC right now, you probably get much crypto coverage. And it just, I mean, you were talking about the stock market. Everything is there right now.
00:24:47.048 - 00:25:29.874, Speaker B: And historically, like you can go on Tradingview and compare SPX to ether to bitcoin or whatever and you're right. Like there is usually a lead up spread where like stocks take off. And the reason for this, right, is crypto is a risk on assets. So you're just really never going to see crypto lead stocks. Well, maybe decades in the future if how we think it would play out, crypto becomes a bigger asset class in stocks. But for now, youre not really going to see crypto lead stocks on a big cycle. Whats funny though is even if stocks lead, which is happening right now, which is great, anytime I see stocks green and leading, im fine.
00:25:29.874 - 00:25:55.814, Speaker B: I know people get frustrated because theyre like, hey, cryptos not moving, but stocks are, trust me, its way better than the other way around. You do not want stocks going down because cryptos not going to go up. Stocks are going down. But whats funny is crypto gets the multiplier higher 100 x of what some of these stocks go up. So were seeing a bit of a, I mean, it came back but now stocks are bouncing. But crypto hasnt caught up. And that gap always catches up.
00:25:55.814 - 00:26:16.154, Speaker B: It always does because people are going to take profits in stocks. What are they going to do with it? They want to get risky. Theyre going to go chase crypto. Maybe they chase crypto and they do well. And then like last second we saw, then they chase nfts right and then maybe they do well on nfts and then they chase meme coins. Like there's always something lower. Right.
00:26:16.154 - 00:26:56.114, Speaker B: And I think the reason we're seeing this, like, longer time gap right now and SPX versus, and you said SPX. I say it for people that don't know S and P 500. SPX is kind of the index, right. You would use to kind of like, get a gauge on american stocks in general and the stock markets across the world in general. Is people still a little cautious with inflation and just some weirdness going on? Right. It's not the same market we had pre COVID, where stocks started pumping and then crypto kind of was falling right away. I think people are still a little cautiously optimistic, which is probably fair.
00:26:56.114 - 00:27:46.718, Speaker B: There's still some oddities out there that we didn't see in the last few cycles, but I think most of that's going to be shaken off and eventually crypto catches up and that that gap will be closed. All of a sudden, your neighbor will be texting you when he said 15k, hey, should I buy Solana? Should I buy Charles Hoskin coin, whatever it is, and then you're going to get NFT text, and then you're like, okay, I should definitely sell. That's when you sell, by the way. It's always on point. If you take that last ridiculous tax where it's like, oh, hey, I know you told me about ETH, but I bought shitcoin x instead because someone told me if it goes to a dollar, it's going to be worth like a trillion dollars. Give it like a week or two after that sell, and it's pretty much guaranteed to be the top. Yeah.
00:27:46.766 - 00:28:18.014, Speaker A: Yeah, that has definitely been my experience. And I think a lot of people's experience with things, especially if you're, if you have a lot of people you surround yourself with that aren't in crypto. Um, I mean, obviously, most of the people that I surround myself with are in crypto these days, but I still obviously have friends and family outside of that. And, yeah, it is a pretty much like a hundred percent hit rate, which is kind of scary, but it makes sense because it's the attention game, as I said. Why are these people paying attention to crypto? Well, because it's gone up a lot. That's the only reason. And if they're doing it like that, then, yeah, the top is now, so to speak.
00:28:18.014 - 00:28:57.150, Speaker A: And it's worked kind of wonders in the past. But I think the final kind of leg of this discussion is just generally the macro stuff. And I think that when it comes to the macro, I don't really think about it in the context of my crypto investing decisions because for me, it kind of is irrelevant. I think crypto is still way too small to really be affected too much by the macro. As you said, it is a very risk on asset class. It's basically where you go once you've kind of made money in the stock market and you want to, you know, you want to do something more risky, or it's where you go when you're fomoing into, into things and you don't really have an investment thesis on anything. Like, for example, people will buy a stock to buy Apple or Microsoft because they're like, oh, Apple is selling lots of products or Microsoft is selling lots of products and they're beating the revenue estimates, blah, blah.
00:28:57.150 - 00:29:21.966, Speaker A: But when it comes to crypto, most people are not doing that when they're coming into crypto. They're just buying indiscriminately based on some youtuber has told them to buy some coin. As you said, maybe it's a cheap coin and they're buying it because they think it's going to go to a dollar, or maybe they're buying it just because it's been going up. There's not really much fundamental analysis going on there. And I think it's just because crypto is very small. It's very misunderstood as an industry. The products and services aren't as obvious as they are in the stock market.
00:29:21.966 - 00:30:06.862, Speaker A: So it becomes a game of just attention, pure attention. It's got nothing to do with anything else, just a pure attention thing and number go up is the best form of attention there. But the macro stuff generally, I think even if you think to yourself, well, the Fed is not going to cut rates again until 2025, 2026, for example, okay, if you believe that and it doesn't happen until then, it doesn't mean that the crypto market can't go up because the crypto markets can just front run it. Because if there's enough of a belief and enough of a narrative that, okay, inflation has come down a lot, the Fed's going to pause, rate rises. Maybe they won't cut rates for another two years. As long as that belief exists, crypto will front run it. And what will ironically end up happening potentially, is that the Fed starts cutting rates in 2026.
00:30:06.862 - 00:30:45.690, Speaker A: And by that point, we're in another bear market and crypto just going down and everyone starts saying, oh, look, the Fed's cutting rates and crypto can't even pump during it. You know, crypto is dead, right. And there actually has been years where crypto has gone down during years where the Fed has cut rates or where rates have been really low. And I think that's just in the context of crypto just being too small to be largely affected by it. But also crypto being a lot faster as a market just front running these things. Because if you look at where crypto bottoms, I mean, especially ETH, ETH bottomed in June of 2022, and that was when inflation was at its peak. And then inflation started trickling down over the next kind of, I guess, like, year since then.
00:30:45.690 - 00:31:03.810, Speaker A: And ETH has not gone to a new low since then. ETH kind of like, seemed to have priced that in a lot more quickly. And the same is true for most assets in crypto. I think BTC was the only one. That's not the only one, but like, BTC set a new low in November, but it wasn't like a big new low. And that was obviously because of an outside external force in FTX. Right.
00:31:03.810 - 00:31:35.858, Speaker A: That was definitely related to FTX. Other than that, crypto has seemed to front run that sort of stuff there and then to the upside. I think, as you say, crypto lags because there's more risk on it, lags, spx and stuff like that. But it will definitely front run any kind of rate cuts. I definitely think that we could be in another bear market when the rate cuts actually start happening, which will eventually just be fuel for the next bull market. But yeah, because crypto is 24/7 because it moves a lot faster. Because there is like a four year cycle rather than like a ten year cycle, which is what the stock market tends to play out as.
00:31:35.858 - 00:32:03.378, Speaker A: Um, I think that it's, in crypto, it also doubles because it's halved that the cycle is basically half what it is in the stock market. But then it's double as fast, right? It's half as half as fast and double as fast as well. So if you look at it from that perspective, I think that, that, that matters like that. But as I said, like, I don't generally pay much attention to the macro environment. Um, because it's, I mean, honestly, it's, it's two reasons. I don't think crypto is big enough. And if I'm investing in crypto, I don't really care to look at the macro stuff.
00:32:03.378 - 00:32:44.876, Speaker A: But two, if you look at the macro stuff, you overload yourself because the macro thing is so much bigger. Than any individual. It's so huge that you literally as an individual have no power over it at all. You have no power to change it. The only thing that you could probably have a little bit of power over is the, is changing the president in the US when you go to vote or changing the Senate or the House, that's the only real power you have. But that is influenced by so much more than the markets and the macro environment that is influenced by a million different things, the social side of things as well when it comes to social rights, things like that, like things that are outside of the financial purview that plays a huge part in it. So, yeah, just generally, I mean, we don't have control over it.
00:32:44.876 - 00:33:03.524, Speaker A: So there's no use getting kind of upset about it. You can base your trades and investment on it. But for me, if I based my trades and investment on in crypto on the macro, I would not have bought ETH in June of last year, right. I would have been like, oh my God, the macro is so bad. Inflation is going to keep going up. Everything's going to go to shit. And I would have missed out on buying ETH in triple digits again.
00:33:03.524 - 00:33:06.384, Speaker A: So. So im glad I didnt didnt follow the macro stuff.
00:33:06.844 - 00:33:48.648, Speaker B: Trey. Yeah. The issue with following the macro stuff like the macro doomers and stuff like that is if you just zoom out on charts, theyre forever wrong. Just zoom out on an all time stock graph, right, and all time just us economy, world economy graph, theyre just wrong. And it always comes down to the point, I was just saying earlier at the end of the day, where people going to put their money like in the US, at least in general, people that are working and they have paychecks coming in, they're like very directed to put their money into the stock market, right. You got 401 ks. Like, you know, you kind of like get these financial advisors, every one of them wants you to just pump money into stocks, right.
00:33:48.648 - 00:34:42.662, Speaker B: And like, that's the reason I never will believe the macro bearishness, stock bearishness, because like, I mean, what, is everyone just going to put their money under their covers, under their mattress for years? Yeah, maybe that happened in zero eight for two years. But even then, that was an all time buying opportunity on stocks. The world, literally, people thought the world was coming to an end with the housing crisis. And in all reality, that was just an all time buying opportunity. Three years later, everything rebounded and people were making money again. Yeah, I get some of the stuff on, like maybe some numbers or metrics don't look great right now, but in all reality, like, you just have to kind of zoom out on these charts and realize what history has done and it's just not going to like go to zero. It's just not going to happen.
00:34:42.662 - 00:35:25.196, Speaker B: And the main reason is people just keep making money and they got to put it somewhere. Like that's just the reality of the situation. So, and I'm with you. Like, I never really base crypto decisions. I mean, for crypto, for me these days, it's like a little easier, I guess, because I'm just, I just have my e staked and I'm just chilling and, you know, earning interest and restaking it and that's just my play for the next, until I die, basically, to be completely honest. Yeah, every once in a while, like on a big dip, I'll throw some money at it, but other than that, like, I'm not making too many bigger decisions. But if I step back, like when I first was investing in Ethan, stuff like that, it never was a factor for me.
00:35:25.196 - 00:36:50.870, Speaker B: Like I never listened or read, listened to like macro podcasts or read macro like newsletters or anything like that because I mean, when it's such like a nascent industry that you think, and I've said since day one of us doing podcasts forever ago, and I know you have too, like, this is a multi decade play and you got to realize we're still early, like for ETH, we're still in the first decade, like decade zero, I guess you would call it, or whatever, I guess decade one technically. But like we're still in the first ten years and like this stuff is still going to be kind of getting built, like maybe even well beyond, like our years, right, of doing this stuff. And it's not like overnight cryptos is going to take over. And if you realize that the day to day movements shouldn't really matter to you because, like, and people get so caught up on this and you see it, right? And like, it's why like, people chase nfts and why people chasing meme coins and why people chase alt layer ones and why they chased all this stuff they want, like, the day to day profits. And the best investment is always going to be something that you or the best, like investment thesis is always going to be something you truly believe in that's going to like transform the world and you find just chilling in it. And like if ETH goes from, I mean, originally for me from a dollar to dollar 23 and down to $5 and then up to 1420 and back to 80. Like, it doesn't matter, right.
00:36:50.870 - 00:37:17.864, Speaker B: Because you just, you believe in it and you're not. I mean, yeah, points, I was over invested, I guess, but, like, that's also part of, like, really believing in a movement. Right. But you're not going to, like, try to trade yourself out of it because something moves or someone tells you the stock market's crashing, you're not going to, like, reinvent your thesis for why you think east going to trade, like, change the global economy. Right. And change people's lives for decades to come. So I'm with you.
00:37:17.864 - 00:37:42.164, Speaker B: I don't bother myself too much with that stuff. Even when the stock market's crashing. I'm just chilling. I always have been, always gives a good day to read by ETH because I'm sure ETH crash on those days, too. But like I said, if you zoom out on stocks, it's up. Only I don't really see a point in my lifetime that stocks won't be up. Only I don't see a thesis where it wouldn't be.
00:37:42.844 - 00:37:43.460, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:37:43.532 - 00:37:43.764, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:43.804 - 00:38:29.252, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think on that kind of multi decade kind of approach that we've always taken to this industry fits nicely into some of the regulatory stuff with crypto as well. I think people end up fighting themselves out of their bags, so to speak, because they worry about the regulatory side. And, yes, okay, we've seen a lot of hostile, kind of, like, regulatory stuff towards crypto, but a lot of it has got to do with the fact that, um, there's, crypto's new, there's not a lot of laws and regulations that have been tailor made for crypto. So some of these agencies are literally just applying the law. And if they don't do that, then they risk losing funding as well, because they obviously need to prove to Congress that they're doing their job. Then you also have people that have a vendetta, like Gary Gensler seems to have against crypto, where he just wants to take a very hostile approach and he ends up just losing in the courts anyway.
00:38:29.252 - 00:39:09.484, Speaker A: But I think generally, the regulatory stuff, because it moves so slow, will play out during those kind of multi decade things where countries around the world, not just the US, but every country around the world, will have their own legislation around this, their own regulations that are tailor made for crypto so that we can actually keep building these things out. And I know people will say, oh, it's so bearish. You know, they're trying to kill crypto in the US, blah, blah. It's like if they were really trying to kill crypto in the US guys, like, they would have just banned it. I mean, they would have made it so hard to interact with it. They would have basically shut down the exchanges, said that they were basically illegal money transmitters or dumb whatever. Like they, they could, they being the government, could have put their weight behind this to, to kill crypto.
00:39:09.484 - 00:39:34.760, Speaker A: But, but they don't want to do that. They don't want to kill crypto. I think what's happening is that there's just too much bureaucracy. There's not enough guidance on the legit, on the regulatory front and especially within the law that we just get this hodgepodge of kind of crap happening. But that's all temporary in my mind, I think that's going to get ironed out. I think that the industry is going to mature a lot, especially with these tradfi players now, like Blackrock getting involved. They're going to push the maturation forward.
00:39:34.760 - 00:39:53.952, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know how many people are paying attention to the tradfi world right now, but they fucking love crypto right now. Like, they love crypto. Especially these etf's. They're all about it. They're like, holy shit, ETF's. Because for them it's like we can now access all of this retirement account money. We can funnel it into these ETF's and we can make a shit ton of money off of fees doing it for an asset class.
00:39:54.088 - 00:39:55.560, Speaker B: Fees exactly.
00:39:55.712 - 00:40:24.492, Speaker A: For an asset class that hasn't been saturated yet because it hasn't, hasn't traditionally had access to that money. So they're just looking at the trillions of dollars that they manage and saying, well, we've, even if we put a small percentage of that into these crypto products, the crypto market is just going to grow so large and we're going to be able to take those fees and repackage these products to our, you know, boomer clients. Right. All this old money that's, that's hanging around. So for them, they're like, and they're doing it at the right time too, where they're like, everything's quiet right now. We can get our foot in the door. We can start getting these products on boarded.
00:40:24.492 - 00:40:44.972, Speaker A: So I think people really need to be paying attention to that because these tradfi institutions, they aren't worried about regulatory stuff because they know the game. They know that it's going to get ironed out. They know that it's not a hard blocker for adoption of crypto. It's just, it's, it's a thing that takes time to play out. It might stall some things for a little bit, but eventually it's going to come. That then that goes back to what we're talking earlier about. The ETF.
00:40:44.972 - 00:41:02.724, Speaker A: ETF's, the tradfi players. They know the ETF's are now inevitable. That's why they're all filing for it, because they're like, I want my ETF. I want to be able to take fees off of it. I want to be able to, to get this money in. And they're all going to be competing each other with each other for it. I mean, fidelity recently published last month a report on the Ethereum investment thesis.
00:41:02.724 - 00:41:31.958, Speaker A: So not only are they looking at bitcoin, they're looking at Ethereum as well to basically shield to their clients who have a lot of money. But what people don't understand is that crypto money is fucking nothing compared to tradfi money. We are literally a fly to be swatted away. That's how irrelevant we are right now to crypto, to, to tradfi. The money in tradfi just absolutely dwarfs crypto. And when we start unlocking that money and bringing it into crypto and allowing it to play in crypto and invest in crypto assets, that's going to unlock the next leg for the industry. And that's, that's coming.
00:41:31.958 - 00:42:00.254, Speaker A: I mean, people, as I was saying earlier, people, you know, especially traders, are just like, ah, you know, the ETF news did nothing for the price, blah, blah. That's because as you said earlier, Eric, the market is severely underpricing the impact of this because they just don't understand it right now. They don't understand and what this is going to unlock, and they will, they'll will over time, but by the time they understand, we're probably in another bull market and then that they just send us higher. Right. They just bring that money in. But yeah, that's kind of generally how I view the regulatory stuff, is that it's a temporary hiccup at best.
00:42:00.874 - 00:42:38.842, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, I think you made some great points. I'm glad you kind of circled back to what I said earlier. People are severely underestimating the ETF stuff. And so what you said, I think is vitally important is fees. Right? And like these, these institutions, whether fidelity, Blackrock, E trade, everyone, to say they're going to push this so hard because they just see money, right? And like the bottom line for them is they have shareholders and they need to find new revenue and. Are you kidding me? Like bringing in crypto ETF's and pushing it to their customers and taking a cut of everybody that trades on these ETF's. I mean, they're going to be pumping this like none other.
00:42:38.842 - 00:43:20.032, Speaker B: Like, it's a totally new thing. Like, I mean, if you look back at like, the gold ETF too, and like, what gold's done since then and like, oh, basically every industry that's gotten an ETF and what happened after the fact and like, I personally. So why am I. So why do I think most people are severely underestimating the impact of ETS? It's because I personally know a lot of people that are still scared to not. Well, scared is probably the right word. Still, like, shy scared to use coinbase. Like, and I know that sounds weird, maybe to, like, a lot of our listeners, especially like, younger listeners, it just exists.
00:43:20.032 - 00:44:05.324, Speaker B: Like, people don't really get like, okay, who's like, so coin, it's gotten a little better since they became publicly traded. But like, are they regulated? Like, people are so used to FDIC insurance in the US. Like, do they have FDIC insurance? Like, what happens if they get, like, hacked or they go under? Like, these are all actually very legit questions, right? And like, do I need to, like, know my crypto keys? You throw that on fidelity who, like, people have used for years, boomers love, and they're just like, oh, buy bitcoin that you have no idea how many people are sitting out there ready to do that and it's right in front of them. And also, they can do it in their 401 ks, they can do it in their investment accounts. It's just, they don't have to think about private keys. They don't have to think about Coinbase. They don't have to log in and see wallets.
00:44:05.324 - 00:44:47.098, Speaker B: There's a lot of money sitting out there waiting for this. And I think people are grossly underestimating how much money is actually sitting out there for it. And even money that maybe doesn't know, there's a lot of people that still just don't really know about crypto. Like, yeah, sure, they've heard, like, bitcoin and ETH, but like, if their brokerage or their, you know, their financial advisor starts saying, hey, did you hear about this new bitcoin and ETH ETF, you should check it out. You can buy it through me. It's going to open a whole new boom. It just really is because right now the reality is you have to go on Coinbase you have to, like, I know people that are scared to wire from their bank to Coinbase because they think their banks are going to like, blacklist them.
00:44:47.098 - 00:45:14.910, Speaker B: And like, that just is. I get it. Even I maybe think my bank will see something weird more. Back in the day before Coinbase wasn't legitimized through their IPO or whatever you want to call it. But I think a majority of people are waiting for this to get into crypto and I think the market's just severely underpricing it. Yeah, yeah.
00:45:14.942 - 00:45:44.598, Speaker A: And I mean, yeah, I totally agree with that. And I think, as you said, like, people are generally scared of new things, especially the older folks who have the money, by the way. Like a lot of people really don't, I think still don't understand that most of the wealth is concentrated with the older folks. And it doesn't have to be just cash that they're sitting on. It can be coming out of other assets. Maybe they want to rebalance their retirement account and say, okay, I'm going to allocate like 1% to crypto for now. And if enough people do that, that's a lot of money coming in that's being rebalanced out of other asset classes into, into crypto.
00:45:44.598 - 00:46:28.168, Speaker A: And as I mentioned before, for, as you said as well, crypto is new to these people and it may not be new to us because they've been around for so long now, but it's new to these people. They're going to buy based on what these institutions tell them as well, because fidelity will put out a report or Blackrock will put out a report saying bitcoin is digital gold and that's what these people are going to buy based on. They'll put out a report about Ethereum being this new tech or whatever, and then people will play and invest with it because it's a tech play for them or something. Because they're like, oh, I know, tech, like Apple and Microsoft and blah, blah. And they look at that and they're like, holy crap, tech's been the biggest winner over the last 20 years or whatever it is, 1015 years especially. They're going to invest in that. And then also they can kind of give the Ethereum investment case from a store of value perspective as well there.
00:46:28.168 - 00:47:04.118, Speaker A: But yeah, I think that's all going to happen and I think it's going to be very bullish. But I guess on that bullish note, we're probably out of time for today, but I hope that everyone is feeling a lot more bullish after that it's funny, some people made some comments that the episodes that we do focus more on the market side of things than I usually do in my, in my daily episodes. And I think that's probably a better kind of fit for what we talk about here because the market stuff is something that I generally do pay a lot of attention to. But don't talk about too much on, on my show daily. But I think, yeah. You, both, you and I have a lot of attention paid to it and have a lot of things to say about it. So I'm glad that we get to get to do these episodes.
00:47:04.118 - 00:47:07.934, Speaker A: So. So, yeah. Thanks again, Eric, for being on. And, yeah, I hope everyone's feeling bullish.
