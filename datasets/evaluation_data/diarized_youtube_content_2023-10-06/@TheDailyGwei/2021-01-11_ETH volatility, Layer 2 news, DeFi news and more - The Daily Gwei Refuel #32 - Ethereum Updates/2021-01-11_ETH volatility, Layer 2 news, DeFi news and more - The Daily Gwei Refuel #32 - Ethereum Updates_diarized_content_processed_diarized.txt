00:00:00.440 - 00:00:22.446, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the daily Refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today is the 11 January 2021. Alright, everyone, a bit of volatility in the markets overnight. I'm sure you all felt it. I think it's been going on for the last 24 hours or so. It's a pretty brutal drawdown. You can see here on the chart.
00:00:22.446 - 00:00:56.714, Speaker A: This is the daily chart. You know, how much of a kind of drawdown it's been since, you know, ETH was about 1350, went down to 1000, which is about a 35% drop. If I was to say, if I'm doing my math correctly here, if I look at it here. No, I was doing my math incorrectly, sorry, 25%. So, yeah, pretty, pretty brutal drop there. After going up for a period of, you know, quite a while, you can see here we went up pretty quickly and then, you know, topped at around 1350 and all time highs around 1420. So unfortunately, I won't be tweeting again anytime soon.
00:00:56.714 - 00:01:47.040, Speaker A: It looks like, you know, I spoke about that the other day, how I made this, how I made this promise where I wouldn't tweet again until ETH was at all time high. I, of course, expected ETH to go to all time high around, you know, around here because it was already at 1300 when I tweeted that. And I was like, you know, 1420 isn't very far away, but alas, the markets are a cruel beast and they will, you know, punish you when you least expect it. So, yeah, I didn't expect a dump this big, but I'm no trader. I don't actively trade any of these markets. So, I mean, I think that's a good thing because I not very good at calling, you know, tops or bottoms on these sorts of things. But in general, I mean, if you're looking at this and thinking, you know, is the bull market over? Is, you know, is it all going to crash again? Are we kind of like at the end of 2017, early 2018 in the cycle? I mean, I don't think so.
00:01:47.040 - 00:02:15.486, Speaker A: I think this was just like the flush out that we needed. You can see, you know, how long we went up for without a proper flush out. We did have some dumps here. You can see on the, on the candles here, the wicks go down pretty badly, but it wasn't anything, you know, too serious because it got bought back up straight away on the daily candle, whereas these, this seems to be a pretty, pretty brutal dump. And it doesn't seem to have ended yet. You know, as I'm recording, it's still going down, so we'll see how that goes. But I don't want to focus too much on the price here.
00:02:15.486 - 00:02:45.104, Speaker A: Just wanted to point that out for those who maybe might be worrying or might be feeling a bit disheartened. I think, you know, you can get addicted to the gains, right? You can get addicted to how fast you're going up and. And it kind of becomes euphoric, and then when you go down, it's like, you go down very fast. It can become pretty depressing. But, you know, you look here, we're basically back at the price we're at on the 5 January. That's like basically not even a week ago. So, you know, crypto prices can move fast in either direction, and I think that's always important to remember.
00:02:45.104 - 00:03:18.854, Speaker A: And Larry Stonec from the blog put out a tweet the other day, basically saying, you know, ethereum has a bunch of different all time highs on different exchanges. You can see here that Kraken actually recorded its all time high at about 15.95, which is, which is quite, quite a lot higher than the rest of them. The rest of them seem to be between 1420 and 1440. I, for the sake of my tweet and the all time high that I've been going off in general is 1420. That's from Coinbase, bitstamp and Gemini, Bittrex and Hobby, Polyneux, Bitfinex. They're all around that.
00:03:18.854 - 00:03:41.866, Speaker A: Right? 1424 here, binance was 1440. But I think 1420 is the all time high that everyone seems to have agreed upon, or at least most people have from what I've seen. So, you know, hopefully we get up to that. I don't even mind if we go there and then crash off that. I just want my tweeting ability back. I think, you know, some of you might have seen on Twitter today, all the memes and everything. I mean, I'm enjoying it.
00:03:41.866 - 00:03:57.314, Speaker A: It's, it's quite fun to see all that. But as a, as a passive kind of viewer, it's, it's quite, it's quite funny. You get people messaging me, you know, asking me how I'm going and stuff like that. I mean, obviously I'm fine. It's not, it's not a huge deal. It's just funny seeing all the memes. So keep the memes coming for sure.
00:03:57.314 - 00:04:24.910, Speaker A: And for people who say that I'm cheating by retweeting things, I'm not cheating. I retweet things because they're funny or because I want to update my followers on what's going on or I'm excited about something. And I also use it as reminders for what to talk about with, with all of you. I usually talk about what I've retweeted on the daily grey refuel. So, yeah, I don't think that's cheating. And tweeting and retweeting are a bit different, I think so, yeah. Well, um, we'll see how we go over the next few days with regards to price.
00:04:24.910 - 00:04:55.504, Speaker A: I do think that, you know, we might see another kind of dump down just to basically reset the market and then continue up from there. But as I said, I'm not like a trader or anything like that. I'm just following on kind of what I've seen, how I, how I've experienced, like, previous bear mark bull market. Sorry. And this is basically normal, previous bull markets. I mean, in 2017, you had 35% to 40% drawdowns, I think, six or seven times during that year for BTC specifically. So this isn't out of the ordinary.
00:04:55.504 - 00:05:17.184, Speaker A: This isn't something that hasn't happened before. So, yeah, always be kind of like ready for this sort of stuff. And it can, it can basically snap back as fast as it goes down. Like, you know, we could be at 1300 by tomorrow, for example. Not saying it's going to happen. It's probably unlikely that it happened, that it will happen, but, you know, that's how fast crypto moves. And I'm sure a lot of you have been in the industry for quite a while, will be well aware of that.
00:05:17.184 - 00:05:43.882, Speaker A: But for maybe for newer people, this is literally normal. This is nothing out of the ordinary. And a 25% dump is actually not that bad compared to, you know, what we've seen in the past. So, yeah, just keep that in mind. So, into the block. Put out an interesting tweet just before about addresses that are currently in profit across different blockchains. So what I actually found quite funny was that there are more addresses in profit on ETH than in bitcoin right now.
00:05:43.882 - 00:06:23.080, Speaker A: And this is simply because bitcoin basically went to, what, 442 thousand dollars. It's, if I'm looking at the chart right now, it's back at $34,000 now. So you can imagine how many people bought BTC between 34,040 2000 because it actually hung around there for a little bit and basically are now underwater on those purchases. Right. If they didn't of course, obviously, if they didn't sell, whereas for ETH, I imagine, you know, we didn't stay at the price levels that we were at for too long, and we kind of, like, dumped down from there. So, you know, you can see that basically 92% of all people that bought ETH are in the money, so they're in profit. And then you can see the other blockchains here.
00:06:23.080 - 00:06:47.104, Speaker A: You know, most of them seem to be, like, highly in the money. What actually struck me as a bit of an outlier was bitcoin cash here. But then I thought about it, and I'm like, you know, there's probably a lot of bitcoin cash that isn't actually or hasn't actually been claimed yet. So all the addresses where the bitcoin cash is sitting, or at least most of them people didn't even bother to claim it. So it's just sitting there. So it hasn't moved at all. So it's sat there since the.
00:06:47.104 - 00:07:21.056, Speaker A: The airdrop, essentially, or basically since the fork, sorry, in 2017. So that makes sense. And then vet here, which is ve chain, also stood out to me, being 90% in profit. I mean, I don't know much about this project at all. I do know that it was a big project during 2017, so it's interesting that it's still 90% of addresses are in profit, even though it was one of the bigger, I think, pumps and then later dumps in 2017. Not to say that the project is a pump and dump, but it definitely went up and up pretty highly and down, I guess, from there. So that was interesting to see.
00:07:21.056 - 00:07:53.184, Speaker A: But this is one metric I love to look at. I believe that, you know, if most of the addresses are in profit, then, you know, the selling pressures will be. Will be less, simply because people are less inclined to sell when they're in profits, right? If you're losing money and it's. And it keeps going down, eventually you get to a point where you're like, well, I better sell, right? Cut my losses. But if you're in the money, you know, you kind of get. You know, I mean, everyone does it, right? You get a little bit greedy. You think, you know, I'll just wait for it to go a bit higher because I'm in profit.
00:07:53.184 - 00:08:28.338, Speaker A: It's all profit at this point. You know, you might take off the table, your original investment, you might take some profits, but most of it you let ride. You know, I have some friends doing that. They take five to 10% of profits around these prices, and then they let the rest ride because up to a certain price point because that, you know, it's pure profit from that point of view. So this is something that I like to watch to see, you know, which kind of coins are going to have, you know, extreme selling pressure as we move up. Which, which, which coins won't, you know, generally something that, where people, most people are out of the money. I think it will sit in what's called a accumulation phase for a while.
00:08:28.338 - 00:09:00.734, Speaker A: And we saw this with, I guess, ETH for two years, right? When ETH basically sat between one and one and $300 for two years, most of the time it oscillated around, I think, 150 and $250. And that means it was basically in a re, an accumulation slash distribution phase where people that were, that thought it was the bottom and it kind of was because it was like a massive range. They were accumulating, right. They were buying but they weren't in profit yet. Right. So they were still counted as addresses. Not in profit, but at all that time, you know, people were capitulating.
00:09:00.734 - 00:09:29.462, Speaker A: We're selling, you know, they're getting out of the markets because they're like, I'm gonna cut my losses. This thing's never recovering. And that's why we get those long phases where you have that two year, maybe even a three year accumulation phase. And then from then on, all the people that the kind of metric says aren't in profit, right, or underwater. They are not people who bought at a $1,000 anymore, right. They become people who bought it like $200. So they earn immediately in profit when the price goes back up.
00:09:29.462 - 00:09:56.750, Speaker A: So that's, this is why. This is one metric that I really love to look at, to see that there's a bunch of others you can look at as well. But this is great for spotting when something's been an accumulation for quite a while and, you know, eventually it will go back up. So yeah, I mean, I think you have to pay to access this, maybe, but it's on into the blocks website. You can go check it out. I'll link it in the YouTube description, of course. But yeah, I think it is paid.
00:09:56.750 - 00:10:27.418, Speaker A: But yeah, you can go check it, check it out and pay for it if you so wish. Interesting tweet from Mark Zeller here just before actually he was replying to someone who said that they sold their lend after ICO for a mere three times when they could have made it 600 times. And then Mark was basically saying, you know, we will always welcome you back to the Aave fam. They still have a lot to build. 2020 was the tutorial. The real deal starts now. And I'm looking at the future with a lot of optimism, he says.
00:10:27.418 - 00:11:01.846, Speaker A: So obviously he's referencing optimism as in the optimistic roll up company. So the company building the scaling technology that you've probably heard about, synthetix is going to be using them. Uniswap is going to be using them. Even chain link, I think, as well, is going to be using them. From the teasers that I've seen, everyone was wondering, you know, what L2 is. Are they going to use? Will they use optimism? Will they use ZK roll ups? Will they use a sidechain? You know, what are they using? And I honestly haven't heard much about this at this point. So this is why this tweet kind of struck a, I guess, like my curiosity, because he said optimism.
00:11:01.846 - 00:11:38.862, Speaker A: Now, Mark is. Is part of the product team, I think, or at least the core team at Aaver. So this is not some random saying this, but he might be trolling, right? He might be trying to do some misdirection here, but I don't think so. I think it makes sense for Aave to be on optimism with other protocols like Synthetix from a pure, I guess, like opposability and liquidity standpoint. And I wouldn't be surprised at all if they actually ended up being on optimism. I guess we'll find out soon because of the fact that optimism soft mainnet is launching on January 15 with. With Synthetix, so it's only four days away.
00:11:38.862 - 00:12:05.734, Speaker A: I'm sure once that goes off without a hitch or once that's out there, they're going to want to hype up the next projects that are going live. And, you know, as I say, Uniswap's already been announced because they logo is basically on optimism's blog posts. Same with Chainlink. I think Aave is probably the next one. So, yeah, great to see Mark put this out there as a little bit of a teaser. I hope he's not trolling, because I would really love to see are there on optimism. I think it makes a lot of sense.
00:12:05.734 - 00:12:28.234, Speaker A: I think, you know, L2 is just going to keep getting hotter and hotter this year, as I've said many times. And, you know, I'm looking very much looking forward to January 15, to seeing how the soft main net launch with. For optimism goes with. With synthetix. So, yeah, really looking forward to that. So Dy DX crossed a huge milestone over the weekend. So they did a three.
00:12:28.234 - 00:13:00.652, Speaker A: They've they've done, sorry, accumulative $3 billion in transaction volume on DyDX since launch. And they're saying they're just getting started with L2 coming soon. Now, for those who don't know, Dy DX is launching a L2 using Starkware's ZK roll up technology. So not optimism. So, yeah, as I've noted before, there are two leading kind of technologies right now and kind of companies leading it here with ZK rollups and optimistic roll ups. And there's a few key differences between those. And we don't know who the quote unquote winner is going to be yet.
00:13:00.652 - 00:13:34.946, Speaker A: We just know that those are the leading technologies and they are getting a lot of traction. There's a big defi projects are looking at them. So, yeah, we're going to see that come to fruition here. And, you know, starkware, quote, tweeted this and said that basically dy DX's perpetual contracts will be live on the stock X ZK roll up engine on Ethereum, Maine, in a few short weeks. So this is all coming very, very quickly. I, I feel, you know, we're going to get synthetics on January 15. With optimism, we will probably get, I mean, within, I should say, within the next two to three months.
00:13:34.946 - 00:14:17.120, Speaker A: We're going to get, I think, Synthetix on, on Mainnet optimism. We're going to get dy DX on, on ZK roll ups. We're going to see the continued growth of loop rings, Zk roll up technology as well as long along with diversify, the curve is on Zksync, which is from the Mata labs. We're going to see a uniswap layer to go live, which I think is going to completely change the game and basically give a lot of people their first taste of L2. So there's just within the next two to three months, it's just going to be L2. Every, pretty much every week, I think, of new projects going there. We're going to see incredible adoption across the board here because the gas fees have gotten to the point where a lot of people are just so sick of it.
00:14:17.120 - 00:14:49.892, Speaker A: Right. Every time the price moves, the gas fees spike up. I mean, today or during this kind of dump, the gas fees spiked up to 600 gray again. And for those wondering why this actually happens, there's a few reasons. So the number one reason is because the bots working on chain to arbitrage between different liquidity pools on chain. So say uniswaps liquidity pools, sushi swaps, curves, all these sorts of things. The bots don't care how much they pay in fees as long as they're making a profit.
00:14:49.892 - 00:15:13.172, Speaker A: So what they'll do is they'll do an arbitrage between, you know, multiple kind of areas. Maybe they'll even use rv for flash loans, whatever. But all they care about is that they make profit net of fees. So they will pay 99.99% of the transaction in fees as long as they make 0.01% profit. So they don't give a, you know, give a damn how high the gas fees are.
00:15:13.172 - 00:16:12.202, Speaker A: They will pay that as long as they know that they're going to make a profit at the other end, which they do in terms of high vol, in terms of high volatility, because the arbitrage opportunities are so great because the prices get so far away from, from one another. And the second reason is that people who have on chain leverage positions open are scrambling to close those. You know, you can imagine that you're seeing the price fall from 1300 on ETH to 1100, and you have a position that's going to get liquidated at $1,050, right. You're scrambling to cover that position. So you either you're paying down your, your loan with freshly purchased capital, such as like stable coins, or you're, you know, closing out your position by selling off your other assets as fast as you can and getting the money into, you know, aave or whatever, or compound and paying down your debt. So that's the second reason that it happens. And third reason, and that's a bit more technical, is that, and I'm not sure how much of an impact this has, but I think it does have actually a, quite a large impact, is front running.
00:16:12.202 - 00:16:57.298, Speaker A: Front running bots and Mev in general. So basically bots that try to front run other bots or people's transactions to basically do their transaction before they can do it to make the profit. So that's another thing there. And they obviously will bid higher than the person they're trying to front run in terms of gas fees to get their transaction included. First, Mev, minor extractable value falls into that, basically trying to outrun the other transactions. And for those who maybe don't know how this works, basically when you submit a transaction to the Ethereum, mempool it, depending on the gas fee that you paid, you can get the transaction confirmed within one block or multiple blocks. So if you're doing it within one block, it's 15 seconds.
00:16:57.298 - 00:17:29.958, Speaker A: So all the transactions that have paid the right. Fee that are included that in that 15 seconds will get included in a block. But during those 15 seconds, pretty much everyone can see those transactions, and if someone wants to, they can front run it. Now, what that means is that say you have a transaction, an arbitrage from uniswap to sushiswap, where you're going to make $100 in profit, as an example. Right. A front running bot can see that and say, okay, well, this is going to make dollar 100 in profit for this person. I want that profit.
00:17:29.958 - 00:18:02.394, Speaker A: Okay, well, this person paid this much of a fee. I'm going to pay more than them to guarantee that my transaction actually gets included before theirs. So I actually. They're not stealing anything, but they're basically, you know, copying that, that transaction and taking away the opportunity for that original person to profit from it or bot or whatever. A lot of this activity is actually automated. So that person has actually, personal bot has actually taken that opportunity away from the original owner. And that's called minor extractable value.
00:18:02.394 - 00:18:25.754, Speaker A: And that is actually something that happens a lot. You don't see it. This is what people talk about when they talk about the dark forest of the mempool. You've probably seen the blog post written about this. At this point. There's been a few of them, and this is like an active research topic for some very smart people right now. They're researching on how to basically stop this from happening, or at least have it happen where it's fair for everyone.
00:18:25.754 - 00:18:54.298, Speaker A: But, yeah, I'm not gonna dive too deep into that. But that's another reason why, or at least one of the big reasons why the gas fees can spike so high. Because, you know, as I said, as long as you come out with profit at the other end, people don't care how much in fees they have to pay. And that's why you've seen it come down as well so quickly. Like a few hours ago, it was 600, now it's 117. Right. They don't stay up persistent, persistently for that long, because volatility doesn't last that long.
00:18:54.298 - 00:19:05.662, Speaker A: Right. The dumps will happen very, very quickly. They're not going to just persist. Like, we're not just going to have ETH four from 1300 to 1000 to 700 to 400. Right. Within a day. That's just, that's not how it works.
00:19:05.662 - 00:19:30.236, Speaker A: So that means volatility goes down and gas fees go down with that. So, yeah, just a bit of an explanation for you guys. So also over the weekend, I think it's less than this now. But Alexander Fisher here posted that the ETH two deposit contract surpassed $3 billion worth of value locked, or 2.35 million ether. Now, this is obviously worth less than $3 billion. Now, I think it is $2.7
00:19:30.236 - 00:20:00.416, Speaker A: billion at current prices. So, I mean, it's still close enough, right? I mean, it's still a huge milestone. 2.35 million ETH is about 2% of the total ETH supply. So, yeah, it's, it's, it's really great to see that ETH is still flooding in. You know, as the ether price goes up, the more value is locked, the more value is being secured. I mean, I wrote a bit about this in the Daily Gray newsletter today, but basically you can think of the ETH two network, since it's a separate network, to eat one right now as just another blockchain.
00:20:00.416 - 00:20:45.682, Speaker A: Right. And if you look at all the other layer, one smart contract blockchains and measure them by market cap, pretty much all of them have a, have a lower market cap than ETH two does, except for Polkadot and Cardano. So you could just say that ETH two is just like killing all these other kind of chains off. And it's just, it's just hilarious because even if you subtract the 3 billion USD market cap that ETH two has from the ETH one market cap, e one, still way ahead of everything else. So, yeah, it's funny to look at when you, when you, when you look at that and think about that, and I think it really shows, that shows the incredible strength of the Ethereum community here that we've rallied around this and we've actually put in so much ethan, to this. It's really great. I mean, I love looking at my validators and seeing them humming along.
00:20:45.682 - 00:21:00.578, Speaker A: It's always really, really nice to see that. And I'm sure a lot of people get a lot of. You have got validators as well. You probably know what one of the feeling I'm talking about, it just, it just feels good. Right. But yeah, I wrote a bit more about this in the Daily Gray newsletter for today. So definitely go check that out.
00:21:00.578 - 00:21:19.908, Speaker A: It's in the description. So Raphael from Glass node tweeted out this picture today. And I've spoken about this before. Not today, sorry, yesterday or. Yeah, yesterday. So I've spoken about this before. But basically Ethereum has flipped bitcoin in total network fees paid in 2020.
00:21:19.908 - 00:22:02.042, Speaker A: So basically, I think Ethereum doubled the amount of network fees paid in 2020 as opposed to bitcoin. No, 83% more than bitcoin so almost double. So it was about $600 million in fees on Ethereum. And, you know, I've spoken about how ethereum settled more value than bitcoin in 2020 as well. Settled about a trillion dollars of value or something like that. So to see that it's also beating it in total fees paid is quite, is quite. It's quite a nice sight because you can see on the chart here that in 2017, or actually my camera is covering it, but basically, you can see on the small chart in 2016, Ethereum basically didn't even register.
00:22:02.042 - 00:22:32.256, Speaker A: Right. Bitcoin was quite small still in terms of fees paid, but Ethereum didn't even register then. You look at 2017, bitcoin has a huge lead. It was at like 550 million fees paid in 2017, whereas Ethereum was about 30, 40 million here. Move on to 2018, obviously, bear market. So, you know, the prices were down, which means that the USD value of the fees were down, but bitcoin was still ahead. But now it wasn't ahead by that massive lead it had in 2017.
00:22:32.256 - 00:23:00.076, Speaker A: It was only ahead by about double, I think. So if ether had, what, 150 million, bitcoin had almost 300 million fees paid, then 2019, obviously, prices were lower. Again, it was the depths of the bear market. But bitcoin. And bitcoin actually got ahead at this point because I think during 2019, it was actually quite a. Quite a bad year for Ethereum and ETH in terms of sentiment and usage and all these sorts of stuff. But you can see here that bitcoin was at 150 million fees pay.
00:23:00.076 - 00:23:36.512, Speaker A: Ether was back to the 2017 levels, actually lower than the 2017 levels. But then you had 2020, which was obviously the explosion of DeFi and everything you can do with DeFi and obviously the high gas fees on Ethereum. And you can see that bitcoin basically, you know, increased as well, but basically only did a bit more than the fees it did in 2018. Whereas Ethereum basically went from only doing 30 or 40 million fees in 2019 to, you know, $600 million in fees in 2020. So a massive gain there, an obvious gain. Like anyone who's used the Ethereum network knows how painful fees are. The high fees are, you know, we've all paid them.
00:23:36.512 - 00:24:26.000, Speaker A: I just spoke about the reasons why they're high. But yeah, this, this is insane. And the number one reason why this is insane to me is that bitcoin security long term relies on network fees because of the fact that the block rewards halves every four years. So as that block reward halves, the miners get less bitcoin and you know, unless the bitcoin price is going up, they're actually making less money. So obviously, every four years now, the bitcoin price has gone up, right? Or at least like after the harvesting, the bitcoin price has trended up, but that's only happened a few times. Like, there isn't enough data to say this is going to happen into the future. And eventually bitcoin is not going to go up enough to basically make up for the fact that the block subsidy is very small and it's not going to take, like, you know, 100 years for, to this point.
00:24:26.000 - 00:25:14.736, Speaker A: I think it can happen within the next 1020 years. So what that means is that bitcoin needs to rely on network fees to secure itself. And I don't think long term it's going to be able to, because I don't think that there's enough demand just to move bitcoin around on the bitcoin network to pay all these fees. Whereas on Ethereum, right, you're not just moving ETH around, you're doing Defi, you're moving stable coins, you know, you're moving other tokens, you're doing nfts, daos, whatever you, you're doing so many different things. And people are willing to pay those things because those are high value transactions, especially DeFi. So Ethereum is actually beating bitcoin at its own security game. And the funniest thing is, is that in ETH two, Ethereum doesn't need to rely on network fees for security because ETH two has perpetual issuance to stakers, which is less than 1%, so very low perpetual issuance.
00:25:14.736 - 00:26:00.144, Speaker A: And we will also have fee burning. So in turn, we may get to a point where ETH issuance goes negative because more fees is being burned that ETH generated a year per year, which creates this, what I like to call symbiotic relationship. And this is actually, I guess, my bull case for Ethereum and ETH is that I believe this model for network security is better than this model of capped supply halving every four years and hoping that the fees paid on the network can actually make up for that dwindling block reward. So, yeah, I mean, this is, and this is proving to be true, right? This isn't like a fantasy. This isn't a narrative. This isn't like fiction, this isn't like a prediction. This is actually happening right now.
00:26:00.144 - 00:26:43.082, Speaker A: You know, and I, and I think that, you know, bitcoins, hash rate and everything's at all time high. Fair enough. Right. But that's because the price is going up. I'm curious to see, you know, when the price stops going up and when it dampens, at least what's going to happen, right? Is the bitcoin network going to become insecure? Is hash rate going to go down and perpetually go down? Because it just becomes unprofitable for miners to just live off transaction fees. And the block reward isn't sustainable because the price has stopped going up and it doesn't make up for the fact the block reward halves every four years. So that's not fart on bitcoin or anything, but it is definitely something that not enough people talk about and actually consider it to be a fundamental flaw in the bitcoin protocol.
00:26:43.082 - 00:27:21.660, Speaker A: Now, long term, I actually, and this might be an unpopular opinion, I actually think that the bitcoin community will either vote to add perpetual issuance, which I know right now is very hard to believe because everyone rallies around the 21 million cap and that's what gives it value in all this sort of stuff. But I think ETH has proved that at this point at least, that you don't need a capped supply for something to have value, right. ETH has no capped supply and never will eat, will have infinite supply. But there's nuance to that, as I just explained. But at the same time, ETH is only, what, one 6th of bitcoin's market cap, right? That's huge. It's. It's a.
00:27:21.660 - 00:27:46.234, Speaker A: I think it's $120 billion. Bitcoin's like 700 billion or 650 billion or something like that. And, you know, it's living, and bitcoin's obviously older. It's living off this kind of meme, whereas ETH has managed to attain this massive market cap. And it did it basically like, you know, almost before ETH two staking went live as well. So we only had ETH, as I guess people call it, just gas, right? Or as a. And then people using it as a store of value.
00:27:46.234 - 00:28:30.218, Speaker A: Obviously, people were using it as gas because the fees being paid. So I think you don't need a capped supply, right? You just need demand. And that's what Ethereum has and what Eve has. It has so much demand. So, yeah, I won't harp too much more on about this, but it's just another thing that Ethereum has flipped bitcoin in, right? We flipped it in total settlement volume, flipped it in usage, you know, in total usage across the board, whether that being defi or anything like that. You know, I just think that the market cap flipping, I know, it seems a little far away at this point, but I think it's just a matter of time. You know, I get why people like bitcoin and why people are bullish on it, but I just, when you look at it and look at all the nuance behind Ethereum, what Ethereum is trying to do and.
00:28:30.218 - 00:29:12.244, Speaker A: And ETH as an asset, you just quickly realize, or at least I do, and a lot of my fellow perma ETH bulls do, that. ETH is just such a magical asset, and it's just so different to bitcoin and can stand on its own that that's what makes me the most bullish on it, basically. All right, last up here, we had an interesting tweet from Santiago from a couple days ago. So Santiago is a partner at Parafy Capital, which is a very active defi investor and user. So what he tweeted out was, quote, was just on the phone with one of the largest global hedge funds. They've been interested in crypto for years, but haven't allocated. Their biggest surprise was hearing about DeFi protocols cranking out cash flow.
00:29:12.244 - 00:29:44.540, Speaker A: With record low rates, DeFi productive assets become too hard to ignore, end quote. I thought this was awesome because this is exactly what I've been seeing as well, with anyone that's in the traditional finance space, like my accountant, people that my, my parents know that I've spoken to and stuff like that, they all kind of think about the same thing. They're like, how are you getting 10% plus yield on your dollars, basically? And I'm like, well, there's this thing called Defi. It's on Ethereum. It's outside of the banking system. It's completely open to anyone to use. There's no Kyc.
00:29:44.540 - 00:30:16.414, Speaker A: You don't have to do any of that. And their minds are absolutely blown, like, seriously, we take this stuff for granted because we're so in the. In the weeds of this, but they are blown away by this, and not just because of the. The rates and the fact that you can buy tokens that give you cash flows as well, and do this all on Defi outside of the traditional banking system. They're also surprised that they haven't heard about it. They're like, how have I not heard about this when it's just so amazing? Like, well, because we're so early. We're so, so, so early.
00:30:16.414 - 00:30:50.100, Speaker A: You think about the. I mean, if you even look at the cumulative addresses, not people addresses that have interacted with various defray protocols, it's like, at 1.2 million or something like that, 1.2 million addresses. So I will tell you right now, there are pretty much so many people using multiple addresses that that 1.2 million can easily be taken down to 500,000. And I would take that down even further to maybe two to 300,000, in terms of actual defi users, people that have used a DeFi app at least once, unique people, not multiple addresses or whatever.
00:30:50.100 - 00:31:31.594, Speaker A: So when you think about that two to 300,000 people right now, the population of the planet is 7 billion, or over 7 billion. I think it's approaching 8 billion at this point. And we have two to 300,000 using DeFi when the total addressable market of finance is the entire world. Right? Like, this is, this is why people get so bullish on DeFi, on Ethereum, on all this sort of stuff, is because we have just not even begun to see the inflows of people that are going to be coming once they figure out how much better this system is. And, you know, obviously, there's lots of growing pains now, and I like to call us that are in the ecosystem today pioneers, because that's what we are. We are pioneering this technology. We are so early.
00:31:31.594 - 00:32:12.396, Speaker A: We are the ones who will deal with the high gas fees and so, and develop the technology and keep building and investing so that the people that come after us don't have to deal with that. And your reward for dealing with that is the fact that you get to buy stuff early. You get to buy tokens early before they go up. You had the opportunity to buy ETH. You know, if it was 2016, at $10, if it was 2018 and 19, between 100 and $200, those people coming in later aren't going to be given these opportunities because they are the late majority or the, or the late stage adopters. We need them, obviously, to realize the goals that we have for this technology. But, you know, that's why I always kind of, when I see people complaining about gas fees, I'm like, guys like, you are at the forefront of this stuff.
00:32:12.396 - 00:32:29.252, Speaker A: Enjoy it. You know, make the most of it while it lasts, because it's not going to last forever. You know, these high rates aren't going to last forever. Things are going to get more efficient. Things are going to come down. The gains are going to come down. You're not going to be able to buy tokens of projects that are going to change the world at, you know, less than $100 million market cap.
00:32:29.252 - 00:33:05.024, Speaker A: These things are going to $100 billion plus market cap if they're successful, that's what fintech companies are at in the traditional world. So the crypto space loves to compare the market caps of crypto to itself, which is fair enough. I like that's relative valuations within its own asset class. But when you look outside and look at, you know, the possibilities, I mean, to me, owning ETH is like owning a share of the Internet, right? You are, you can't own a share of the Internet, so you buy the companies on top, add all those companies together. Right. In a kind of crude kind of way, and you maybe get the potential market cap for ETH. Right, right.
00:33:05.024 - 00:33:26.056, Speaker A: And that would be in the many trillions of dollars. And then you look at the apps themselves and compare them to their traditional finance counterparts. We're replacing banks. Banks have market caps of hundreds of billions of dollars. We're replacing fintech, we're replacing payment apps. We're replacing all this sort of stuff, or at least trying to. And the upside there is just massive.
00:33:26.056 - 00:34:01.106, Speaker A: Absolutely massive, especially because this is global. So I can't stress it enough about how early we are, even though it doesn't feel early to some of us because we've been here so long. We are so, so early. You'll know when we're no longer early, when people aren't just talking to you about, you know, buying tokens on centralized exchanges and speculating all that, but when they're actually using these apps in their everyday lives during bear markets, that's when you know that we are no longer early. So, yeah, really exciting stuff happening across the board. I will digress there because this has been a long, deadly gray refuel. But yeah.
00:34:01.106 - 00:34:13.234, Speaker A: So thank you everyone, for listening and watching. I hope you enjoyed it. Subscribe to the YouTube channel. If you did give the video a thumbs up. Subscribe to the daily weight newsletter, join the discord and I will see you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone.
