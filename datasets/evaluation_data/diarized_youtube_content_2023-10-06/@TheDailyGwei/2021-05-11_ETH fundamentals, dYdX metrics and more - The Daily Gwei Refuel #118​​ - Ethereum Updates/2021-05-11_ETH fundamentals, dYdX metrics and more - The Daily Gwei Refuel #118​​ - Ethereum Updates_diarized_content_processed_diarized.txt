00:00:00.320 - 00:00:41.566, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gui refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cisano, and today's the 11 may 2021. Alright, everyone, let's get into it. So bit of craziness going on lately, right in the crypto kind of markets here. And I did want to kind of give an overview and give some thoughts around this because I'm sure you've all seen it by now, but essentially it's these dog coins that seem to be going up a lot. And even Shiba coin is trending right now in Australia on Twitter, which is, which is insane. But anyway, Larry Cermak from the block put out this tweet showing that some of the top pairs on uniswap by volume are these dog coins.
00:00:41.566 - 00:01:06.960, Speaker A: You can see here, Shib against ETH has $1 billion of volume. Leash ETH 212 10 million. Akita, kiss you 100 million. Elon 34 million. So, you know, obviously a lot of volume flowing through these, the biggest being shib. And you may have seen some tweets, I put some out about people putting in, like, you know, basically nothing into these things and making tens of millions of dollars off of them. And, you know, you might think that's not real, but it is real.
00:01:06.960 - 00:01:33.898, Speaker A: It is real. Like, Shib, for example, was worth basically nothing up until, like, late last year. For some reason, it started. It started getting more activity on it and people started buying it. But for most, I think, like, for most of its life, I think it started in August, or at least for a lot of its life, August to, like, later last year, uh, it sat at, like, basically no volume was being traded on it. And its market cap must have been, like, super small. Like, I'm talking less than $100,000 or something like that.
00:01:33.898 - 00:01:58.988, Speaker A: Today, its market cap is, like, $30 billion, fully diluted. So you can imagine just chucking in, like, $100 back then and holding it to today. That obviously turns into a lot of money now. There's not a lot of people that did that. It's more akin to winning a lottery ticket than investing. Um, there's not, you know, obviously, most people wouldn't have held it until today. There would have been like, you know, even if they made, like, maybe a hundred thousand dollars, something like that really quickly, they would have been like, oh, well, I'm gonna sell now.
00:01:58.988 - 00:02:17.660, Speaker A: This is insane, right? Because it is insane. These things don't do anything. They are not, you know, they're not tied to any kind of like, defi protocol. They're not money. They're not like, they're just. I mean, some of them are actually just scams, if I'm, if I'm being honest. But, like, whenever people ask me about them, and a lot of people have asked me about them, I say the same thing I always say.
00:02:17.660 - 00:02:40.186, Speaker A: It's like, I'm not gonna give you investment advice. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. I'm not going to tell you that you should buy it or not. I will say if I think it's a scam or not. But even still, you know, it's funny because in crypto, and this is why it's very hard to even kind of tell people what they shouldn't be in, because if you say to someone, this is a scam, so I don't think you should put your money into this. Right. Even though you're not saying it as investment advice, you're saying it to protect them.
00:02:40.186 - 00:03:27.520, Speaker A: Well, I mean, what if it goes like 100 x? Because for some reason, scams pump the hardest in crypto, and then they're going to come back to you and be like, hey, man, you told me this was a scam, but it's up 100 x because apparently, like, a price rise means that the project's no longer a scam, which, you know, doesn't really make sense. But I know a lot of people are kind of like, you know, their minds are breaking when they look at this sort of stuff and they look at the ridiculous gains that some people made and stuff like that. Like that. And, yeah, it really doesn't make much sense. And there's a lot of transactions, actually, that Larry was tweeting about in another thread where people were actually spending more in gas fees than they were to buy the token. So they might have spent like a $100 on gas fees to, to buy $50 worth of the token because they actually expect the token to go up another hundred x. So they don't even care that they're spending more on gas fees, which is just like, what I don't understand.
00:03:27.520 - 00:04:12.896, Speaker A: And it's just, it's confusing, right. And, you know, it could also be some, some wash trading, some spam activity, which is really expensive wash trading. But if you're like the mastermind of this, if these things are like, legit scams and you're the mastermind and you own a lot of the supply, you can just basically do a quick calculation and say, okay, well, if I do some wash trading here, it's going to cost me x amount and gas fees then. But how much profit do I make from the coin going up, for example? So a lot of this stuff's going on. A lot of it definitely makes you question your sanity sometimes and question your own investments and be like, well, you know, we all should have just put $100 into the shib coin, like last year, and we would have been fine. It's like, well, you could have put dollar 100 into another thing that you thought was just like a dead coin, but you were just gambling on it and then it didn't go up. I mean, there's a lot of these things.
00:04:12.896 - 00:04:43.348, Speaker A: There's literally like probably millions at this point of tokens on Ethereum of Erc, 20 tokens that are just dead and no one's interested in them. I think shib, for some reason, got a following. I mean, I wouldn't say for some reason. I think a lot of it's definitely got to do with dogecoin. Everyone's doing the relative dogecoin trade and buying other dog coins because of it. And then, you know, and when people see that, it becomes like a kind of, I guess, a self fulfilling prophecy where everyone's like, oh, well, this dog coin is going to pump because this other one pumped and it's dog coin season. And then, you know, self fulfilling prophecy.
00:04:43.348 - 00:04:56.868, Speaker A: Everything gets beat up. It's the same for everything. It's not just for this. Like when people say, you know, defi season and Defi starts going up and people like, oh, my God, it's defi season. I got to buy Defi. See what I mean? Right? It just becomes a self fulfilling thing. No one's really buying it based on fundamentals.
00:04:56.868 - 00:05:21.234, Speaker A: They're buying it because it's quote unquote defi season and because the, the prevalent narrative is that it's defi season. So narratives play the biggest part in kind of like this time type of investing. And I would say short to medium term, long term. When I say long term, I'm talking years. That definitely plays out on a more fundamental level. But I mean, during bull markets, short to medium term is all narratives marketing. I mean, there's not much fundamentals going on there.
00:05:21.234 - 00:05:43.762, Speaker A: You know, for most assets. Like, I believe that ETH is definitely getting priced in based on fundamentals, but it also has a very, very strong narrative behind it right now with ERP 1559 and the merger, right? Everyone knows about that now. So that narrative is pushing people to buy because they're like, holy shit, I have to buy. I have to buy. Because, you know, 1559 is coming and the merge is coming. So you see how, like, just. It reinforces itself.
00:05:43.762 - 00:06:01.370, Speaker A: So from that perspective, there's no. It doesn't. You know, it doesn't surprise me that all these dog coins are pumping, but there are diminishing returns to this. You know, the money is not infinite. The money runs out. Eventually the interest runs out. You know, every new dog coin or every new fork of a dog coin gets less and less people interested.
00:06:01.370 - 00:06:24.530, Speaker A: And then eventually you have this kind of thing, and I don't know if you. You guys have seen it, but you can google it. This thing called the euthanasia roller coaster, where it's like a picture of a roller coaster that goes up and it's like a really big loop de loop. Then it's a smaller one and a smaller one and smaller, and it gets, like, smaller over time. That's exactly what these dog things are like. The biggest one is shib, and then the rest of them are just the smaller ones. And then eventually get to the end, and then it peters out and people lose interest.
00:06:24.530 - 00:06:58.898, Speaker A: That's what happened in defi season two. In the first one, where all these, like, scams were popping up, all these food farms and things like that, and each one that popped up was just, like, smaller than the last. There was some outliers, like sushi and yam, you know, but. But most of them were pretty small. And then it just became like this ridiculous game of, like, everyone knew it was a game. You'd get in, farm as much as you can, dump it, and get out. And then eventually everyone clues into the game and the fresh money runs out, and you have, you know, what we had after Defi sun, which was a massive defi bear market and only lasted for about a month, but it was still like a brutal kind of drop.
00:06:58.898 - 00:07:17.810, Speaker A: I wouldn't even call it a bear market. It was just a brutal drop. So, yeah, I guess, like, the TLDR here, really, or the summary of my points here is that don't look at these things as investments. Don't compare them to your investments. These are casino coins. These are not investments. These are gambles.
00:07:17.810 - 00:07:55.326, Speaker A: You do not invest in dog coins based on anything except your belief that someone is going to invest in it because of some narrative or some marketing or. Or like the dog kit, the dog coin kind of narrative and stuff like that. And that brings me to my final point, which that I can't. Which is that I currently believe there's two distinct markets in crypto, and this is very different to 2017, I believe. So the two distinct markets are, one, you have the casino coins, as I like to call them. They are literally just gambling coins. Like, most people buying them are either very new to crypto and just throwing like $50 in, like, just like you would throw $50 at a casino or something.
00:07:55.326 - 00:08:25.114, Speaker A: Put it all in black. Right. They're just doing that in hopes that they're gonna make some money. And then there's other participants, including, like, you know, traders and things like that, who are just opportunistic and making, and trying to make money here, which is all well and good, but no one is really investing this. There might be some people that, like, just are very, very new to the space, completely uneducated, and think that these things are investments. But I would say most people are literally just like, you know, gambling here. And the second distinct, the second market, I would say, is the fundamentals based market.
00:08:25.114 - 00:09:09.440, Speaker A: I would say that there's very few coins and tokens that fall into this. I would say that BTC and ETH are obviously the top two. I'm not going to say what others I believe they are because that might be considered an investment advice. I don't want to say anything about that. But obviously, Defi tokens, I think, are very valuable and stuff like that. But the reason why I say that is because think about it, when people take profits from these dog coins, right, where they're going to go, they're going to go to cash or they're going to go to the assets that they actually want to hold, and they actually believe in long term, and they're actually investments and, you know, are actually fundamentally sound. Those the only two assets that I can think of right now that have the liquidity to support that as well for bigger traders is BTC and ETH.
00:09:09.440 - 00:09:33.736, Speaker A: That's why you've seen after every single time that Dogecoin has pumped, ETH has also pumped, right? You can go look at the chart. Every big dogecoin pump has led to an ETH pump. And I'm not going to say that it's, you know, totally correlated, but there is a correlation there of money being made and profits rolling into ETH. This is why you see seasons play out and cycles play out. Once ETH stops going up, I expect defi to start moving again. Right. We don't know when that's going to be.
00:09:33.736 - 00:10:02.136, Speaker A: Like, no one can tell you. Maybe it's happening right now. I saw Wifi was up today. Um, some, some good amount there, but it's the same with, like, BTC, when BTC is really going up, right, ETH is going up on USD, but it is falling on the ratio, and the rest of the market is really falling. And, like, all of it sucking into BTC, then the profits flow to Ethan, to other things. And right now, you know, ETH has the spotlight, so the profits aren't flowing anywhere but ETH. And, and I think that's a distinct market to the casino stuff.
00:10:02.136 - 00:10:23.898, Speaker A: And I think that these kind of other coins and stuff like that, these, these dog coins and stuff, they're bringing in more new people than we could ever even get through normal means. Right? Dogecoin brought in millions of new people. These other dog coins are going to bring in millions more. They're going to use uniswap. They're going to learn how to set up their metamask. They're going to learn about ETH. They're going to have to buy ETH to pay gas fees.
00:10:23.898 - 00:11:40.918, Speaker A: They're not all going to leave. Like, a lot of them probably don't really care about this stuff and will leave, but there'll be a decent chunk, potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people that will stay and do other things, not just with their kind of money and not just, like, gambling or betting on tokens, but actually looking into the technology and getting involved in the ecosystem. This is really how we attract people in these manias in these bull markets. That's how the crypto ecosystem grows. So, to me, you know, I'm very curious to see what Metamask's numbers are like the next time they do an update, because I know that they have 5 million monthly active users, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that double, given how many new people are coming into this ecosystem and installing metamask, not just for Ethereum based kind of casino coins, but also stuff on BSC, because there's a lot of that going on there. And I'm actually surprised that this didn't take off on BSC, but it took off on ETH because the really high gas fees, like, as I said, people are paying these ridiculous gas fees for an investment of $50. So, anyway, I think I spent enough of the episode talking about all that, but I just thought it was very important to kind of go over that, because I've been getting a ton of questions about this from people, and, and I've been getting, like I've been seeing on Twitter, a lot of confusion around a lot of people's minds literally breaking, then they can't accept this reality and at the end of the day, I just look at it as it's a it gamble, it's casino.
00:11:40.918 - 00:11:59.214, Speaker A: It's, it's, it's like a casino. It is not something that I would have ever put money into and held, you know, up until making that much money. And the chances of you finding the right one that pumps that much is very slim. Right. And putting money in at the right time. Just think about it. Like, just think about why you bought the assets that you hold you a lot of the time.
00:11:59.214 - 00:12:25.234, Speaker A: You know, you buy them because you believe in them. Fundamentally, if you're more of a trader or you want to make some quote unquote yellow bets, then yeah, you'll put some into these casino coins, but there's so many of them. Picking the right one is really hard and that's why it's gambling. But anyway, I'll leave it at that for now. I want to move on to some other stuff here. So token terminal put out an update today. They've got a new dashboard for Dy DX, including the latest l two trading data here.
00:12:25.234 - 00:13:04.550, Speaker A: So this is great. I'm really excited to see this. DyDx actually put out an update yesterday as well, going over some new stats where they've got almost a billion dollars in volume traded since launch, 151,000 trade settled, $21 million in open interest, almost 10,000 unique users and 28 mil Tvl with ten markets launched and more coming soon. Really bullish for L2 here. Really, really liking that. But I think why I'm interested in token terminals dashboard here is that I get to have some real time tracking of all these data because DyDx didn't have a dashboard like this before and I was just going to the website and checking out the volume manually, which is kind of annoying because. But now they do.
00:13:04.550 - 00:13:42.230, Speaker A: Token terminal is great, by the way, if you're not using it, I highly recommend going and checking it out. They have a bunch of fundamental metrics for different cryptos, especially defi tokens and things like that. They measure things based on profits to earnings or profits to sales ratios, and kind of show you what's undervalued versus what's overvalued, just based on fundamentals alone. So definitely go check token terminal out, but really, really glad they released this dashboard. This is going to make my life so much easier and make it much easier for me to track these things and presenting information to you guys. So thank you to Toko terminal for that one. So I put out this tweet today with a with a table saying y'all aren't ready for a $2.1
00:13:42.230 - 00:14:19.678, Speaker A: million ETH. Now, this table comes from a spreadsheet that Justin Drake put together here called valuing ETH. Now, what this basically does is it takes the long term fees, assumes a fee burn percentage, right, at each, at each kind of like interval here. Um, you know, takes in the long term ETH supply, the pa ratio, um, and the monetary premium factor, and gives a price. Now, I think $2.1 million is the most optimistic case for ETH. It's if everything goes right, and it's if ETH has a monetary premium factor of 16, which is quite high, I'm pretty sure he's just multiplying this, my number by 16.
00:14:19.678 - 00:14:40.132, Speaker A: Yeah, he is. So if we just look at this chart, though, and we actually see kind of like the best guess section here, right? Long term daily EVM fees of $100 million. We've had that over the last 24 hours. So we've already got that right. Now, this is average fees. I think we're going to get there. I mean, I've said before, I think we're going to get to billions of dollars in fees one day, but I think we're going to get there.
00:14:40.132 - 00:15:20.276, Speaker A: 70% fee burn, right, which is like an assumed fee burn, which I think is the widely agreed upon fee burn percentage. So we pretty safe there. Long term ETH supply of 100 million. At the moment it's 115 million or something like that. So it's, it's saying that like, as long as we're getting the supply down to that much by burning lots of fees, then it's gonna get to 100 million here, the p ratio of 50. So basically measuring Ethereum's price to earnings ratio here, and a monetary premium factor of four. So that would give a long term ETH valuation without a monetary premium of 13k, but a long term ETH valuation with a monetary premium of 51k.
00:15:20.276 - 00:16:07.734, Speaker A: Now, I actually think the monetary premium is bigger than four here. I would actually say it's a lot bigger than that simply because these things, as I said just before, are valued a lot on narratives, beliefs, and kind of like shared, shared narratives especially, too, and kind of hype and, and all that sort of stuff. And ETH is not only going to get value from its, I guess, like fee burn, it's going to be locked in, staking is going to be defy, it's going to be all this good stuff, right? So I would factor that all into a monetary premium factor, and I would probably change this to at least ten or something like that. So if I change that to ten and apply that to this, that would get a price target of 130,000 here. And I've said before that I believe it is going to $100,000 plus based on everything that I just mentioned. So I don't think it's too far fetched to say that. Right.
00:16:07.734 - 00:16:35.102, Speaker A: So I think, yeah, this best guess works for all of. All of kind of these in these rows. But I would change this to ten. I can't edit this sheet, but basically it would mean 130 here. Now, people might be wondering, you know, how can this fee revenue sustain itself? Well, I've explained it before on the refuel, and I've talked about how the fee revenue in the future is just going to be paid by L2s and whales. It's not going to be paid by end users. End users are going to have, like, a blissful time on L2.
00:16:35.102 - 00:17:00.146, Speaker A: You know, near free transactions, instant transactions. It's all going to be well and good. But L2 still wants to pay Ethereum for its security, which it will be doing and will be happy to pay, you know, millions of dollars for. And lots of people will be happy to pay millions of dollars if they're making money from the network as well. There's lots of whales and even, like, doesn't have to be whales. Right. I mean, as I said, we're already at $100 million over the last 24 hours.
00:17:00.146 - 00:17:44.700, Speaker A: That is obviously not long term sustainable. But if you average it out and kind of say, okay, well, some days will be 20, sorry, some days will be 50 mil, some days will be 100, you know, some days will be higher and things like that, we can get to a point where I do believe, truly believe one day we can get to a point that there's billions of dollars of revenue. But if we're just taking like, a conservative guess here of $100 million, which I actually think is conservative, he's got. He's got columns here where he says this is conservative, but I don't think that is $25 million is basically the baseline fee revenue these days. Even when the fees were cheaper, like at like, even 30, 40 guys, we were still doing like 15, 20 million. So, you know, that, I think is probably just baseline there. And as I said, we've done 100 mil over the last 24 hours.
00:17:44.700 - 00:18:27.188, Speaker A: So, yeah, if we take all those into account and this is just based on fee burn and with a monetary premium factor of ten, because you want to factor in its use as collateral in Defi and it's staking use and all that good stuff. You get to 130,000 just based on this. And I think it's going to go higher than that in the long term. You know, if Ethereum takes over the world, it's definitely going to be higher than that. I do think that. I know it's a bit risky to say this, but I do think that long term, long, long term, like ten years plus, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but ten years plus ETH could get to a $1 million plus price just based on all this stuff that's going on with it and stuff that we can't even foresee. So from that perspective, this is one of the major reasons why I'm not selling my ETH.
00:18:27.188 - 00:18:44.302, Speaker A: But I did discuss yesterday about how not everyone should do that. You should take profits when you need to take profits and want to take them. Do not wait for a $1 million ETH. Do not wait for $100,000 ETH, because it's going to be a long term thing. It is not going to be a short term thing. And, you know, we're going to have bear markets in between. It's.
00:18:44.302 - 00:19:14.116, Speaker A: It's not, you know, and it's not even guaranteed. It's just like my best guess and, you know, my kind of like, sorry, best guess based on the fundamentals and based on a lot of assumptions, too. I'm assuming a lot of things here, even though I believe in them, there's still assumptions and they can still not play out. I'm assuming that daily fee revenue is going to be in the billions of dollars. I'm assuming that Ethereum is going to be the backbone of the entire financial system, and I'm assuming that. That the network is actually going to be in demand that much. Right.
00:19:14.116 - 00:19:44.922, Speaker A: And it's actually going to be used by that many people. So, yeah, I'll leave it at that for now. But really cool spreadsheet, which I'll link in the YouTube description. You can go check it out for yourself there. Actually, you know, I'm not living it at that. Apparently, I had this tweet here that I wanted to go over, so I basically saw these kind of like almost $100 million worth of fees over the last 24 hours. And I'm like, okay, if 1559 was active, how much ETH would we have burned over the last 24 hours? Well, we would have burned 16,100 ETH, which is $63 million worth.
00:19:44.922 - 00:20:11.368, Speaker A: If we assume a 70% fee burn over the last 24 hours. That's a shit ton of ETH, right? The current ETH issuance rate is 4.5%. To miners, this would annualize to a 5% annual burn, as state ETH says here. This is insane, right? Because. And it's not going to always be like this for the. For now. I mean, maybe in the future it is where we do $100 million in fee revenue a day.
00:20:11.368 - 00:20:38.444, Speaker A: But the current ETH insurance rate is 4.5%, and post merge it is 0.5%. Even if it goes up to 1%, that's whatever. So if we annualize it out and we have 5% fee burn each year and we have 1% issuance, and that's actually 1%. Issuance requires a lot of east to be staked for us to get there. So if we have that, we are net deflationary 4%. So we're burning 4% more than we.
00:20:38.444 - 00:21:13.264, Speaker A: Sorry. We're issuing 1%, we're burning 5%, which means we're negative 4%, you know, deflationary. This is ultrasound money. That's insane. That's truly insane. Like, these numbers always surprised me. I always think to myself, like, where did $100 million come from to pay the fees? Right? Because not only are these people paying the fees, they are also buying something or doing something or doing some transaction of value on the network, whether that's buying a dog coin or doing like, or liquidating a position or opening a new position or taking a loan or putting like, or LP ing or taking out whatever all this stuff is going on now.
00:21:13.264 - 00:21:39.034, Speaker A: Just imagine that getting burned every day. That's. That's just ridiculous, right? This is why I think that if all of these assumptions hold and. And everything that I just went through while going over that spreadsheet hold, it is not crazy to say that ETH is going to 100k plus. And it is not crazy to say it could go to a million plus one day if all these things pan out. Because this is seriously just based on fundamental value drivers. This isn't even based on speculative stuff.
00:21:39.034 - 00:22:40.492, Speaker A: Monetary premium does have an element of speculation in there, but I would say that that definitely can get trumped by the fundamental stuff and is what drives a lot of that speculative narrative is the. That kind of those fundamental narratives of 1559 and the merge and staking and all that good stuff. And I'm not even including here the fact that if 30% of the fees go to stakers, the staking APY is going to be really high as well, which just encourages more people to stake, which encourages more ETH to be locked up. I mean, where's the ETH going to be? Like, how much ease is there really going to be for people to buy once all these happens? But yeah, I'm going to leave it at that. I've spoken about price a lot on this, on today's refuel, but that's like your, basically your um, I guess monthly dose of hopium. That's a lot of hopium there. But uh, I think, um, when you, when, when this starts kicking in and 1559 is live and we're actually burning this, instead of me saying if it was live we would burn this, it's going to hit people and it's going to hit people hard, I think I'm going to be tweeting about it all the time, like just fair warning.
00:22:40.492 - 00:23:30.000, Speaker A: So, um, yeah, but moving on from that for now. So an interesting tweet from James Wang today where he basically said Sushiswap has returned more cash to token holders in its one year history than Amazon has returned cash to shareholders in its 27 year history. Now while its comparison is fun and while it works to kind of like feed into the defi narrative, I think that we have to kind of put some nuance here. Amazon doesn't return cash to its shareholders because it reinvests all that money into its ecosystem to grow the Amazon ecosystem and grow, grow the value of the business, which obviously grows the share price. If you go look at the Amazon share price, I don't think shareholders care about not getting cash or not getting a yield or not getting a dividend on their shares. They are very happy holding Amazon shares. If they've been holding it for ten years, they're doing very well.
00:23:30.000 - 00:24:08.262, Speaker A: Right. But what I think this speaks to is what I wrote about in the Daily gray newsletter today about efficient markets and how the entire crypto ecosystem is an incredibly inefficient market. And I've spoken about this before, but a clear example of this when it comes to DeFi is not particularly sushi swap. I think that's one example. But like an obvious and clear example is maker doubt maker has pure protocol revenue. So $150 million annualized going to most, most of that going to buy and burn MKR tokens. Now, the MKR price, if you go look at the chart, stayed flat for a very long time.
00:24:08.262 - 00:24:27.244, Speaker A: For some reason, investors just ignored it. Right. Most people just ignored it. It stayed flat against USD and it crated against ETH for a long time, even though the fundamentals were right in everyone's faces and everyone that I knew was saying, holy crap. Like, how is MKR so undervalued? This is ridiculous. It is a staple of Defi. It is the number one Defi app.
00:24:27.244 - 00:24:57.938, Speaker A: The DaI supply keeps growing. The fee revenue, the protocol revenue keeps growing, and it's actually going to token holders. It's not like uniswap fee revenue that gets generated but goes to liquidity providers. It doesn't go to token holders. Right? Doesn't go to unit token holders. So I would say Uniswap is more like Amazon, where it doesn't return any kind of cash to token holders, but they are definitely reinvesting their war chest into certain things. Not as much as they should be, but they are reinvesting it and they're still building it out and they're still driving value to Uniswap.
00:24:57.938 - 00:25:38.894, Speaker A: So from that point of view, from like an efficient market point of view, I think that the markets in crypto are just not efficient at all. There is so much alpha to be had. You can basically buy things, and if you have conviction on them and you've done your research years ahead of people actually pricing it in. And the clearest and best example of that is ETH. I went through it the other day, or yesterday, actually, on my piece where I wrote about ETH one to ETH two, merge, dropping that issuance less than 1%. I've spoken about how AIP 1559 was known since April of 2019, and that was pure public alpha that you could have had access to if you had just gone looking for it, if you weren't around. And fair enough.
00:25:38.894 - 00:26:23.404, Speaker A: But if you were in the ecosystem and you missed that, I mean, you don't blame yourself really, but or maybe you act, you just didn't come across it. You know, sometimes that happens. But on that note, I would say that you had ample opportunity to buy ETH between one and $300 with the knowledge of all this stuff and with the knowledge of defi coming and growing and things like that. But on that note, I would say that picking the alpha and finding the alpha is just one step. It's just one part of the journey. You need to have the conviction and you need to have the belief and you need to have the diamond hands to hold and to hold on for dear life. Hodl right, because I'll give you a clear example here of something that can go ori the end of 2018, I bought ETH.
00:26:23.404 - 00:26:45.134, Speaker A: I bought $10,000 Aud worth of ETH at $220 usually. So I put ten k in. And at the time, that's all I had left to put in. I was like, I think $220 is the bottom. You know, we just came off a massive kind of crash, and it kind of settled around there. I was like, yeah, that's the bottom. Then 8th dumped to $80, like, two months later.
00:26:45.134 - 00:27:52.240, Speaker A: And actually, I believe as soon as I bought it dumped and it kept dumping after that, I wasn't back in clear profit until July of 2021, in terms of, like, actually well above 220, I think, if I'm remembering correctly. So what caused me to hold and to keep stacking? I stacked through 2019 as well, and 2020. But what caused that was my conviction and belief and my understanding of Ethereum's fundamentals. Because if you don't have that, it doesn't matter how much alpha you found if you sell, because the market is being inefficient and hasn't priced it in yet, and then a year later, the thing goes ten x. Well, it doesn't really matter because you missed out on that, right? So this is why investing is really hard, right? Generally, like in a bull market, I mean, sure, you can put money into anything and things are gonna go up and, well, maybe not anything, but most things, but true investing, like actually investing and actually making, like life changing money, is investing in the things that people ignore but still have the very strong fundamentals, right. The things that are underpriced or not priced correctly relative to the rest of the market. A lot of that is done during bear markets.
00:27:52.240 - 00:28:13.368, Speaker A: The opportunities of a lifetime are done during bear markets. I mean, you had so much time, as I said, to buy ETH between 100 and $300. If you had put all your money that you could spare into that, you'd be very happy today. If you bought it 100, you'd be up 40 x, right. If you bought it 300, you'd still be up a lot there, you know, 15 x or something like that. So. And that, you know, ETH isn't the only one.
00:28:13.368 - 00:28:34.946, Speaker A: There's a lot of defi stuff as well, you know, I mean, Ave Ave, like, in early 2019 was like five to $10 million market cap. Now it's like 5 billion. You made a thousand x if you bought it 5 million. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that for now. I think I'm gonna go over time here if I go on too much longer. I just thought that was something to, to kind of talk about as well. I know this, this episode's actually been very heavy on the price of fundamental side.
00:28:34.946 - 00:29:10.518, Speaker A: But I think it's important during this current bull market to kind of keep your head on, you know, know, the difference between like a gamble or a bet and an investment, and, you know, kind of like, size accordingly based on that sort of stuff as well. But again, non investment advice, just general advice for what I kind of like, follow and what I do. Everyone's situation is different, so definitely only do things for your own situation. Don't do things just because other people are doing them. Don't compare yourself to other people. Because at the end of the day, if your friend makes, you know, a million bucks off something, how does that affect your life at all? Unless they're going to give you some money. Maybe they're a really nice friend.
00:29:10.518 - 00:29:35.730, Speaker A: But in general, that friend's not gonna buy a house for you, right? That friend's not gonna pay your mortgage. That friend's money's not gonna buy you a car, whatever, you know, or it doesn't even have to be a friend. It just has to be someone, you know. So there's no point comparing yourself to someone else. And I think a lot of people do that and they kind of make bad investment decisions based on that, too. But anyway, I'll leave it at that for now. So there was this project I saw yesterday that kind of flew under the radar a bit called magnet.
00:29:35.730 - 00:30:19.192, Speaker A: So their beta launched. And what essentially, what magnet is, it's a workflow tool that makes it easy, I mean, as I described it here, it makes it easy for a nurse to safe multisig, to create and view compensation packages, which means you can vest via yearn vesting escrow, you can stream via Sableye, or you can give grant bonuses via y gift. So what magnet is essentially doing, as the name suggests, it's pulling together all of these kind of services for contributors. Now, I use Sableye for a lot of different things. I get paid out Sableye tokens and Sableye streams and things like that. And I know it's kind of hard to manage in the Sable era in this. Sorry, I managed Sableye and, urn, escrow and y gift, you know, all across the ecosystem.
00:30:19.192 - 00:30:42.204, Speaker A: And kind of like, you don't have like one kind of inbuilt thing and you don't have a integration with no ssafe multi sig some of the time as well. So that's what magnet does here, brings it all together under one. One. Under one umbrella here, and makes it really easy for contributors to, to kind of get started here. And, you know, I just saw a comment here. It looks like the domino's logo. It it's even got the red and blue in the right places.
00:30:42.204 - 00:31:26.036, Speaker A: That's funny. But anyway, go check this out. If you're someone who, you know, does a lot of this stuff, whether you're a receiver or a mint or a sender of different streams, definitely go check out magnet here. So Sam on Twitter put out this interesting tweet thread, and I'll just read the first tweet here. He basically said, if Ethereum accomplishes its mission of becoming the base layer of all the value transactions, it wouldn't be surprising that it would lead to wealth transfer at the magnitude and speed that we haven't ever witnessed. So again, this is really price heavy episode, but I think this is important. What I get from this and what I was talking to a friend about earlier today is that this wealth transfer is happening because people don't even know what's happening.
00:31:26.036 - 00:31:51.664, Speaker A: Think about how many people have no idea about crypto, still bad Ethereum, about the gains that are happening, about Defi, about all this stuff. A lot of them are the people that already have the wealth. And I've discussed this before, the boomers, right? Boomers have a lot of wealth. You can see this in all the metrics. They have most of the wealth. They have no idea all of this is going on. So by the time this wealth transfers from them to the younger people, they're not going to.
00:31:51.664 - 00:32:48.468, Speaker A: And by the time it's done, and by the time they realize it's gonna be too late, all of it's gonna be done, and they're gonna be like, where did all my assets go? Like, where did all the, um, where did all the money go? Like, why did all these people make so much money? And my kind of, like, share is less. And it's because younger people generally are more open to new technologies, right? Much more open, understand them natively because they grew up with it and are much more comfortable investing in these things directly rather than going to a brokerage firm must, you know, and then they're much more, much less risk averse, because obviously, when you get older and you have wealth, you want to protect it. So you go into wealth preservation rather than wealth accumulation. Young people are in wealth accumulation mode for like, ten years, from 20 to 30 at least, and I think well into their thirties, depending on your situation. If you have kids in a family and stuff, you have to be, you know, more conservative and all that, as I said, depends on your personal situation. But I think to, to Sam's point here about this being very, very quick, quick, very quick wealth transfer. It will.
00:32:48.468 - 00:33:21.592, Speaker A: It already is. I mean, think about how many new millionaires, you know, Deca millionaires and billionaires even that have been minted from crypto at this stage that are going to reinvest this money into places and things that they want to see happen. Like I saw a tweet from a meme today talking about his ETH billionaire friends looking into life extension research and wanting to accelerate that. Vitalik's already done that. He donated $10 million to a life extension research facility a couple of years ago. And I'm sure he has other donations and funding stuff that he's done there. But that's the kind of stuff that people that are young are interested in.
00:33:21.592 - 00:33:44.276, Speaker A: They want to extend their life right, as much as they can. Um, and things like that. They want to fund world changing tech, they want to fund like all these sorts of things. They want to fund space related stuff. So when you think about that, wealth transfers are not only good for people that, you know, obviously, you know, some people want to buy lambos and things like that, but wealth transfers are society transfers. They are society. I guess paradigm shifts.
00:33:44.276 - 00:34:33.890, Speaker A: It's when you basically go from, because, you know, he who controls the wealth controls the universe, because essentially the things that get funded and the things that get built and the things that get researched and developed are heavily reliant on massive funding. And when the young people don't have the money, they can't fund the things that they want to see happen. So by, and they can't affect change through that. So by transferring the wealth to the younger people, they can affect change and make the world and mold it into their vision rather than the vision of generations that have gone past and are really happy with things not changing too much because they're either retired, they're just enjoying their retired life and they don't really care about changing things too much. They want things to say that just to stay conservative, whereas the younger people are starry eyed. Big dreams, dreaming bigger dreams, as I like to say. So they're definitely more interested in, in doing that sort of stuff.
00:34:33.890 - 00:35:07.184, Speaker A: But anyway, I'll leave it at that for now when I go over the last announcement here from Alchemyx, who announced today that they're going to be integrating chainlink oracles for the upcoming releases of their Al ETH, Al BTC, Al and Al USD as well. So this is really cool. I think chain link obviously is the best oracle provider on Ethereum. And, you know, pretty much any network at this stage. And I think, you know, the more oracles, the better. So kudos to Alchemyx when, as I've said before, one of my favorite projects in this space, integrating with Chainlink here. I really like that.
00:35:07.184 - 00:35:26.764, Speaker A: And definitely they get a lot of support from the, from, obviously, the chain link community and the wider defi community for doing this, as chain link secures a lot of Defi as well. So I think that's it for today's episode. Thank you again, everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel. If you haven't yet, give that video a thumbs up.
