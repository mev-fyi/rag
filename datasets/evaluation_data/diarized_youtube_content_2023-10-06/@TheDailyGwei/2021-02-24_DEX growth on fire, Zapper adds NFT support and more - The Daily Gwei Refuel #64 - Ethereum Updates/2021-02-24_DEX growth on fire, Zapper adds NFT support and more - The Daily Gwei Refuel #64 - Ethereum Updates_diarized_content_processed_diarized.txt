00:00:00.520 - 00:00:34.704, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way Refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 24 February 2021. Alright, everyone, let's get into the news from the last 24 hours. So quick update, I guess, on the price here. So we actually had a very nice kind of bounce, I guess, since yesterday's refuel here. After going down a lot, right. We went down to below the previous all time high, down to about 1354 here, kind of bounced back up to around the 1700 level, which is really, really awesome to see.
00:00:34.704 - 00:01:02.008, Speaker A: I think after such a brutal dump, it scared a lot of people, of course. But I think that, you know, we're back up here. I think that we're obviously still bullish. I mean, I'm always bullish. So what, for what, for whatever that's worth me saying I'm bullish, I think, you know, it doesn't really mean much, but yeah, I think we're all good here. But I just wanted to, you know, quickly kind of point that out. I think obviously we all kind of watch the charts religiously, so I'm probably not pointing at anything new, but it's really healthy to see this.
00:01:02.008 - 00:01:27.646, Speaker A: I am, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm feeling good. I'm not feeling bad about things. You know, March is usually a pretty good month for ETH during bull markets, you know. So yeah, we'll see what March brings us. We're only about a week out and maybe we finish February up nice and strong. So I'm really looking forward to seeing how the rest of, I guess, the month plays out on the price front here. So today I put out a tweet, basically just a very simple tweet saying the ethereum economy never sleeps.
00:01:27.646 - 00:01:51.842, Speaker A: And I wrote a daily GwEi newsletter about this. It's actually today's newsletter. You can go check that out if you want some more long form thoughts there. But I'll quickly break down kind of like what I mean by this. I mean, obviously it's a very short tweet, doesn't really say much, but if you kind of dig into it, it says a lot. Right? I was thinking about this and I was just like sitting down, I was playing with like different DeFi tools and I'm like, wow, it's like 09:00 p.m. At night, right? I don't have to ask anyone's permission to do this.
00:01:51.842 - 00:02:38.804, Speaker A: I'm just playing around with an entire financial system from my kind of metamask wallet, doing whatever I want, whenever I want. And I was just like, for some reason, like, it just, just kind of, like, hit me all at once, and I was like, okay, this is crazy. We've never had an economy before that operates 24/7 literally never sleeps, right? Never goes offline. The Ethereum network uptime is near 100%. I think there were, there's been, like, I actually think, actually, no, I think it's, it's pretty much 100%. Like, even accounting for what happened with the Dow and the Shanghai Dos attacks, I'm pretty sure it's 100%, but I don't want to say exactly 100% just in case I'm wrong there, but, you know, it's close enough, so. And because of that, right, you or me or anyone, we can do transactions on the network whenever we want, right? We don't have, as I said, we don't have to ask anyone's permission.
00:02:38.804 - 00:03:09.338, Speaker A: We don't have to wait for, like, the trading to start again or, like, um, you know, something to open, right? It's always open. It's just like an entire world or a tire economy that is always open, ready to take our transactions now. Yes. You know, it's clunky, right? It's slow sometimes. The fees are obviously very high, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still available. Ethereum's availability is insane. And I know that the world computer kind of term that's used to describe Ethereum is kind of a meme at this point, but I still think it fits.
00:03:09.338 - 00:03:42.984, Speaker A: I mean, a world computer doesn't mean that it has to be, like, a fast computer, right? It doesn't have to be like, a cheap computer. A computer is basically just like a piece of kind of hardware and with software on it that kind of executes arbitrary, I guess, not transactions, but, like, instructions, you know? So the Ethereum kind of network does the same thing with the Ethereum virtual machine instead. We call them transactions, right. So whenever you kind of talk to the Ethereum network, you're issuing a transaction or multiple transactions. Um, and. And those are being processed by this kind of computing network that is worldwide, right? There's nodes everywhere. There's miners everywhere.
00:03:42.984 - 00:04:31.850, Speaker A: So when you kind of, like, think about it like that, Ethereum really is a world computer. At the end of the day, it's a world computer that never sleeps and processes any transaction you want. And it doesn't even have to be a financial transaction. It can be anything you want to do on here. Right? So from that perspective, I think, you know, it requires a little bit of a kind of change of thinking as well because, you know, not only are we rebuilding the financial system, right, like, we're basically replacing the old financial system rails with new rails, we are going far beyond that. And we're kind of like, changing what it means to have a financial system because there are so many products within Defi and on Ethereum that could not exist in the traditional finance system because we do not have composability, we don't do not have money legos, we do not have a truly permissionless, neutral platform to build these things on. And that's what ethereum gives us.
00:04:31.850 - 00:06:12.438, Speaker A: So, you know, from that perspective, I mean, the ethereum economy, economy, never sleeping is just the tip of the iceberg. Then you have everything else underneath that, that kind of powers this entire economy here. So, yeah, I mean, you really just got to, like, sit down, you know, get rid of distractions and think about this really deeply to kind of really understand exactly what we're building here, because it's easy to get caught up in, like, the hype, right, and the speculation, the trading tokens and, you know, watching charts and all that sort of stuff. But if you really look at it and really dig down into the technology, you will see that, you know, it's not just kind of changing. So rebuilding the financial system, it's changing it fundamentally from the ground up with new and exciting kind of products and things that people are going to get a lot of benefits out of and already are getting a lot of benefits out of. And I use another example, I guess, in, in the newsletter today where I said that it's also a kind of autonomous economy, right, where it's truly passive income, where, you know, there are other vehicles where you can get passive income from, but they require a lot of trust, right? Where, say you have, like a rental property, you have a property that you've bought and you're renting it out, right? There are so many intermediaries in that transaction and so many things you have to trust, right? So yes, it's passive income, but there's still all sorts of things that can go wrong with it, of course, right? Whereas on Ethereum, like, you can become, for example, a uniswap liquidity provider and no one can take that away from you, you know, unless the entire network, you know, was to clued against you essentially, like, but then we'd have more stuff to worry about than that. But basically, Uniswap can't take that away from you, right? No one can take away your liquidity provider tokens unless they hack you or whatever.
00:06:12.438 - 00:06:36.590, Speaker A: So. And you are earning kind of trading fees on that liquidity by being an LP, which is essentially passive income. So we've never had this autonomous 24/7 passive income system like we do with Ethereum. And, you know, Uniswap's just the tip of the iceberg as well. You have like all the stable coin farms, you know, things like that. But I use Uniswap because it is truly decentralized. All these other protocols still have admin keys because they're young and stuff like that.
00:06:36.590 - 00:06:59.238, Speaker A: So that's why I like to use Uniswap. But that is enabled by the fact that the Ethereum economy never goes to sleep, right. It's always on autonomous, accessible from anywhere in the world. And it's just like really, really amazing once you think about it. So I won't ramble too much here, but I mean, I could go on about this forever. Like, this is the stuff that kind of gets me going. I mean, like this is just what's most exciting for me.
00:06:59.238 - 00:07:37.500, Speaker A: And, you know, I'm mostly excited by things that kind of push the boundaries of like the technology that we have today and kind of like do innovative and new things. And I'll talk about Aave and balancer teaming up in a little bit. They've done something really cool here that I think people miss today. But yeah, I mean, just really think about it because it really is game changing here. And also another thing that I don't think many people are kind of realizing is how amazing it is to have a spokesperson like Mark Cuban. Kind of like being a supporter of Ethereum. Now I, this was prompted because I was listening to the Bankless podcast with Mark Cuban on it, and I had listened to the Defiant podcast as well.
00:07:37.500 - 00:08:06.822, Speaker A: And I spoken about this before. He has more domain knowledge of Ethereum and defi than 99% of people in this space. I mean, I'll just straight up say it's, he is so well, kind of like versed in how this technology works and he can articulate himself very, very cleanly. And he's even learning solidity right now. I mean, he's going beyond what I'm even doing. Like I haven't learned solidity yet and I don't really plan to because I'm not a developer, but neither is Mark Cuban, and he's just doing it right. And he is not like a crypto native guy.
00:08:06.822 - 00:08:49.480, Speaker A: He's a billionaire who has, like, all these other businesses. You know, he runs kind of like shark tank. He's very into his sports and stuff, like, but he's doing all of this with all of that. So if you're in, you know, spending kind of, like, all your time in the ecosystem and, like, you know, I see lots of people do this and they have, like, all these, like, weird takes and, like, what I consider to be bad takes on certain things. I just amazed that Mark can kind of, kind of follow along with this stuff, given how busy he normally is. And the reason why I say he's an amazing spokesperson is because of that domain knowledge, but also because he reaches a completely different audience to what myself, you know, bankless, the defiant Defi dad, you know, all those sorts of things completely different to what they reach. Right.
00:08:49.480 - 00:09:36.660, Speaker A: Because we reach kind of like crypto natives and people coming into crypto or already in crypto, right. Mark is reaching people that have never even thought of crypto before and never even thought about anything got to do with, like, a theory. I'm right. They might have heard of bitcoin, but probably never even heard of aetherium, of defy, of nfts. Like, he's a big fan of nfts, so he's bringing in all these new people, and he's, he's, he's just like the greatest person for that because he has fans across, like, many different domains, right? He has fans from people from his early kind of Internet days, right, where people kind of looked up to him and he was like an early Internet kind of entrepreneur and pioneer there. He has fans that are kind of like sports fans, right? Because he's big into his sports. He's basically a celebrity within the US because of his shark tank stuff and, and because of the sports stuff.
00:09:36.660 - 00:10:20.362, Speaker A: I mean, and he doesn't just have a younger crowd either. He has an older crowd, too, which is even better because obviously crypto skews young, but we want to get this technology in everyone's hands. So, I mean, just thinking about that and realizing that, you know, he's not just a talking head, he actually knows what he's talking about is incredibly bullish. And, you know, I get, I said it just before and, like, it's hard for me to be more bullish on ethereum and ETH, but I definitely, whenever I hear someone that, you know, you think is just going to be like, talking head, right, actually articulate himself really well, you know, I didn't know anything about Mark Cuban, right. I just thought, like, I mean, he's not really a celebrity in Australia. He's a us centric celebrity for sure. But, you know, I kind of, like, asked my friends, like, you know, who is this guy? What has he done? They kind of explain it to me.
00:10:20.362 - 00:10:58.940, Speaker A: I'm like, okay, I get it, blah, blah. Then I listened to the Defiant podcast and I was like, holy shit, like, where did this come from? How is this guy so well versed? So, yeah, I'm not, I won't gush over him too much here, but I just think that if more people were like him, right, we would be in a much better place. And I think ETH would already be at ten k, if I'm being honest, because the information asymmetry in this space is insane, right? The. The amount of kind of false info going around, the misleading marketing, the bad takes. Like, it's so bad, and I've spent the last four years trying to correct it, and it's still bad. Like, in bull markets is even worse because people don't even care, right? They're making money, whatever. It's a bull market.
00:10:58.940 - 00:11:17.140, Speaker A: But, um, the fact that he kind of, like, looks past that and kind of gets down to what actually matters is incredibly positive. So, yeah, kudos to him. I don't think he watches the deli gwei refuel, unfortunately. Maybe he does. Maybe he'll see this. If you, if you, if you want, you can tag him in it. It'll be fun to see if he, he sees this.
00:11:17.140 - 00:11:46.484, Speaker A: But basically, yeah, I just, like, want to thank him and kind of like, thank anyone that does this, because, I mean, I have an audience, obviously, but my audience isn't like, you know, anywhere near as big as Mark's. I'm nowhere near as known as Mark. And same with, like, all the other media outlets within Ethereum. So we need more of these people, and not just because I want them to kind of like, be a marketing vehicle for Ethereum. I want them to actually be proper spokespeople that understand the technology. And Mark is a shining example of that. And someone that should be emulated, I think.
00:11:46.484 - 00:12:28.856, Speaker A: So an update from Umbra cash here. So Umbra, for those who don't know, is a kind of privacy protocol that's been, that, that's working to kind of enable the sending of stealth payments on Ethereum. So I spoke about yesterday about aztec protocol and how they're doing zero knowledge, kind of wrapping around different, I guess, like assets on Ethereum, like die and stuff like that. And Umbra is taking, I think, a different approach here, but doing the same kind of thing they want to do, like private payments. Right? And they reached the phase one on of their road to mainnet right now, which means they're on the Rinkeby testnet. So you can actually go test this out right now, test their technology, which I think is really cool. And they've got, like, a kind of detailed post here about, like, what's coming, you know, what.
00:12:28.856 - 00:12:55.650, Speaker A: What phase one has been and how it's complete now and how phase two is in progress and then the audits and everything like that. So, yeah, if you haven't heard of this project yet, I suggest going to checking this out. You'll be able to get a quick recap of what it is, how it works, and you can go play with it. Or rinkeby, which I always love. Right. So definitely go check this out if you've got some time. So Dune analytics posted this tweet that over the last 24 hours, there was $4.2
00:12:55.650 - 00:13:18.368, Speaker A: billion of decentralized exchange trading volume. And the total trading volume of DEXs for 2019 was only 3 billion. Holy shit. Right? We did more volume in one day than we did in all of 2019 through dexs. This is the exponential growth of Defi. People are still underestimating how quickly this can keep growing, even with the high fees. It doesn't matter.
00:13:18.368 - 00:13:36.648, Speaker A: There is so much capital coming into this system right now. So much capital entering. We've got L2 growing, too. Like, there is just money flying absolutely everywhere. And people are hungry for this technology. They're hungry to get involved. They're hungry to, like, liquidity, provide, and provide more liquidity to the system so that these traders can get better kind of deals and less slippage.
00:13:36.648 - 00:13:53.912, Speaker A: And, you know, Dex. Dex are competing with. With centralized exchanges and doing more volume than them. Absolutely insane. Right. Um, I mean, I can't wait till we do, like, more volume than we did in 2020 because 2020 was really the breakout year for Dexs. So I can't wait till we do more volume in one day than we did in the whole year.
00:13:53.912 - 00:14:10.624, Speaker A: That's when it gets, like, really amazing. Because 2019 was, like, obviously $3 billion for the whole year isn't very much, and. And that was, like, when, I guess, defined. Dexs were still in their infancy. Infancy. But the fact that we've done more in one day by a lot, not just by a little bit. 4.2
00:14:10.624 - 00:14:34.290, Speaker A: billion is, like, a lot more than 3 billion is incredible to me. And, I mean, you know, even if we look at the Dexs here, like, on the chart, most of these weren't even out in 2019, too, to be fair. I mean, there was really just uniswap. I don't even know if Bancor was really functional back then. Just looking down the list here, I don't think synthetix was really live in any, any great capacity there. They. I think they were, but it was a very limited kind of thing.
00:14:34.290 - 00:14:49.430, Speaker A: Curve wasn't live. Right. Kyber was. Oasis was. It was. I think it was called ETH to die back then. And I think Dy, DX might have been, and zero x, of course, but basically, like, there was a lot of them that weren't like, Sushiswap is doing a lot of volume.
00:14:49.430 - 00:15:05.462, Speaker A: It wasn't live back then. Right. Curve, as I said, wasn't live back then. Zero X was, but it wasn't doing too much volume. But just like, the volumes across the board weren't great. So, yeah, this is a huge, huge kind of, like, statistic here. I am really impressed by it.
00:15:05.462 - 00:15:26.116, Speaker A: I mean, you know, and we even broke record on the amount of fees paid to. I think there was like $50 million worth of fees paid within 24 hours. And, you know, I am a big proponent of that. Like this. The reason why I like, kind of like the fee revenue is because it's a very hard metric to gain, right? Because it costs a lot. So it shows how much usage the Ethereum network has. That's why I like that.
00:15:26.116 - 00:15:53.038, Speaker A: But at the same time, we just paid miners $50 million when we could have burned that with EIP 1559. Not all of it, but, like some of it, right? So I just can't wait till 1559 comes in and I can't wait to have a website where we're tracking the ETH burn. Then we can actually see that going down. It's just going to be absolutely incredible because then we'll have something even more to celebrate that. We did $50 million in fees, but all this ETH got burned because of it as well. So I can't wait for that. I'm really pumped to see.
00:15:53.038 - 00:16:09.044, Speaker A: To see that be implemented, obviously. Right. 1559 is like one of my favorite things in the world coming to Ethereum. So we're really looking forward to that. So a walkie from gitcoin posted that grants. Gitcoin grants matching round nine is coming soon. As I mentioned on one of the refills, I think last week.
00:16:09.044 - 00:16:36.870, Speaker A: It's coming on March 10. It's going to be running from 10th to the 25th. You can donate to your favorite projects, get your donations matched and currently there is a $500,000 matching pool. I think that's going to increase as we get closer. It's still about two weeks out from the Gitcoin grants matching round that I reckon that'll definitely get to a million plus. And if you, if you are someone interested in being a matching partner, definitely contact or wiki or gitcoin in general, you can reach out to me and I'll put you in contact. I have a line of communication there.
00:16:36.870 - 00:17:21.880, Speaker A: But for those who don't know what this matching round is, basically it's to find open source kind of software and open source media. And what happens is people can donate and get their donations matched by this matching pool quadratically. So what that means is if you donate one dai to the Daily Gui, that could potentially be matched up to like 200 times. So the matching funds would put in 200 die and you for your one die, which is just amazing because it means like your money goes much further than it would previously. And it means you don't have to kind of like struggle to donate and pick between different projects. You can donate to like 20 different projects, give them ten each if that's all you can kind of spare, and that'll get matched a lot as well. And the more individual contributors to each grant, the more matching that grant will get as well.
00:17:21.880 - 00:18:00.960, Speaker A: So really, really awesome. If you, yeah, if you are interested in being a matching partner, definitely DM or wiki, Gitcoin or myself, and I'll put you in contact. So the Ethereum name service runs these finance reports that they do every so often. And I think this is really great because this is really great transparency from a team that is much loved within the Ethereum ecosystem. Right? We all have our own ens names that we love to kind of like use. But basically what this report does is kind of break down, you know, what their income was, what their expenses are, kind of what the balance is, and you know, how they're, how they're basically using the money essentially, which I thought was really, really cool. And I've seen this come from other projects as well.
00:18:00.960 - 00:18:27.470, Speaker A: I think Sushiswap and yearn have done something like this before. I would like more projects to be doing this. It's really nice to see like a breakdown of what's happening with the funds being kind of used, especially funds that may have been raised in like a sale or whatever. And I think it gives more confidence to kind of token holders as well. Not that EnS has a token, but I mean, the fact that they're doing this and they don't have a token is really professional. So you can go read the report. It'll be linked in the YouTube description as usual.
00:18:27.470 - 00:19:19.790, Speaker A: But yeah, kudos to Ens for getting this report out there. All right, here we are with the Balancer x aver news that I wanted to talk about. So what balancer is doing with their new v two asset manager tech is they're going to allow idle assets in their version two pools to earn yield on Aave without increased gas costs for swaps either. So what this means is, and the paragraph here pretty much explains it, on balancer V two, all tokens are held in a single protocol vault. Now, any pool can, however, use their deposited tokens in the vault through an asset manager, which means that this would put the capital to work when it is not being used as swap liquidity. So this is, I mean, to fully realize why this is so mind blowing, and I'm probably going to butcher the explanation here. You have to kind of like break down why composability is so mind blowing.
00:19:19.790 - 00:20:07.408, Speaker A: And I've spoken about this before about how there is so much capital trapped in Defi right now that's doing nothing that we can put to work, right? Think about the amount of ETH in maker that is just sitting there, right, backing Dai. But most of the time it's doing nothing. The only time it really matters is when there's liquidations going on and things like that, right? And, and yes, it manages to back up the whole system. And if people want to kind of burn their diet to get their ETH back, but most of the time, most of that capital is sitting idle doing nothing. What happens when we harness it? Right? What happens when we can harness that capital? That's exactly what balancer and Aaver are doing here. Aave is going to be harnessing balancer kind of like the protocol vaults capital to do all kind of like fancy things here. So basically, I mean, there's going to be a lot of yield farming and going on, I imagine as well with this, a lot of different things going on.
00:20:07.408 - 00:20:43.086, Speaker A: I think they gave an example here. If I, if I go here, they're basically, they're working with the curve team as well. I think to kind of do this with compound and yearn. I mean, like all these teams are working together. I think this is just an example of like how it's really efficient on the gas price side as well. So as gas prices continue to soar, you know, gas efficiency is paramount importance for amms unless the amounts are very large, the transactions become, you know, very costly. And unfortunately, like doing what their example here above here costs like over $240, which is, which is quite expensive, right.
00:20:43.086 - 00:21:00.306, Speaker A: Their solution is the v two asset managers here. And I won't go into it because, as I said, I'm probably going to butcher the explanation trying to. Trying to go through this. But you can read through this blog post and get. Get the kind of idea of what's happening here. But this image kind of shows it as well, right? There's like a token pool. There's like a kind of like.
00:21:00.306 - 00:21:30.218, Speaker A: It takes the idle assets in that token pool and routes them to ave. To generate additional yields. Now, the, what, the reason why some assets are kind of idle is because in a pool, unless the. I mean, it's a bit. It's a bit hard to explain. Yard, like an LP, like a pool of assets for like a liquidity kind of pool on an amm, most of the time, most of the assets are just sitting there and waiting for, like, the price to either go up or go down, right? Because, you know, if you're. If the price of ETH is going up, then people are signing their ETH for die.
00:21:30.218 - 00:21:53.618, Speaker A: If the price of ETH is going down, and then they're selling their, their die for ETH, right? They're buying more ETH, essentially on the way down. Um, and because of that, like, unless you go to like, the bottom, which is impossible, right. There's a. There's always like, um, assets that are kind of like sitting idle, right? Like, say the price drops 10%. All the assets under that price drop are not doing anything. They're kind of like sitting idle. It's a bit hard to kind of conceptualize.
00:21:53.618 - 00:22:23.072, Speaker A: And I. As I said, I'm probably butchering the explanation here, but you can see it in the visualization, right? There's like an active amount of capital at the top, and then there's like a stable amount of capital. And you probably can't see it from the, from the video, but there's like a line in between. And that takes that and puts it into like, what's called a cash amount, which I guess is, which is part of like, the swaps, and then takes the other kind of idle capital, puts it into the invested amount, and the invested amount is going into our. There to earn additional yield here. So. Very cool.
00:22:23.072 - 00:22:43.304, Speaker A: Go read the full blog post. I'm not gonna kind of butcher it anymore, but, yeah, definitely really cool. So Defi Pulse added a new feature to their site. Today called the crypto dollars page. Now, as you might have inferred, the crypto dollars page is tracking stable coins, or crypto dollars, as they've known on aetherium. You can see them all here, right. There's a dedicated page.
00:22:43.304 - 00:23:17.946, Speaker A: You're probably familiar with the interface. You can see all the stable coins listed here, right? USDT, USDC, DAI, and all that with them, TVL, or market cap, as it's known, which I thought was really, really cool, because what's funny is that USDT on it, I mean, a lot of it is actually on other networks right now, too. I think on tron, there's like $15 billion worth of USDT, so. But this is only measuring what's on Ethereum. And it's really cool to see on Ethereum that USDC is almost 50% of USDT. So USDT is 20 billion, USDC is 8 billion, and DAI is at 2.2 billion.
00:23:17.946 - 00:23:51.716, Speaker A: Then you have BUSD, which is binance's stable coin, at 2.1 billion. And then there's a bunch of others below here as well. So this is going to be really interesting to keep track of what's happening with stable coins. I really want to see USDC flip USDt. I know that we had news yesterday about the tether news, which I actually should have covered, and I haven't got in my tabs here, but I'll quickly cover it. Now, there was the news that tether kind of, the organization settled with the New York attorney general's office, or the NYAG, as you might have seen, and they had to pay like a, I think it was like a $18 million fine or something like that.
00:23:51.716 - 00:24:28.508, Speaker A: It was quite a small fine and just not operating New York anymore. But basically it kind of like, I guess, ended the tether Fud, right, where people were saying it's not backed. Apparently in the report, it said that at one point it wasn't exactly like one to one back, but now it is. And, you know, a lot of the Fud was centered around this investigation. But, you know, apparently, you know, they were, they were just able to settle with a fine and admit no wrongdoing as well, so. But in saying that I trust, I don't. Okay, I don't really trust any centralized stable coins, but if I had to pick one out of USDT and USDC, I would still pick us DC because it's much more transparent than tether.
00:24:28.508 - 00:24:51.828, Speaker A: Right. It has like, you know, it's based in the US, right. It has full kind of like regulations of the US on it because it's issued by circle and Coinbase, it has regular auditing by third parties. It's just much more safe. Now, obviously, ideally I want to be using DAi, right, instead of these other ones. But I'm just saying, if I had to choose between the center stable coins, I would. I would, you know, choose USDC for sure here.
00:24:51.828 - 00:25:14.128, Speaker A: But anyway, this page is really cool. I mean, I've kind of like been yearning for like a go to stablecoin page for a while. There are some other tools you can use, but they're not as good. And this one's pretty good. I mean, you can see the stable coin kind of growth here. And as I've said before on the refuel, I think we can get to a trillion dollars by end of the year total. And this is, as I said, this isn't including the USDT on TroN.
00:25:14.128 - 00:25:46.226, Speaker A: So you can add another 15 billion here, which means about 50 billion, probably more than that at this point of stable coins. I think we can 20 x that this year. We'll see how we go. But yeah, it's going to be cool to kind of like, keep an eye on that for sure. So Zappify has added a NFT kind of feature to their portfolio tracker. Now, full disclosure here, I'm an investor in Zappa. So not just kind of shilling it for the sake of it, but what you can do now is you can track your and all of your nfts in the Zappa interface, which I thought was really, really cool.
00:25:46.226 - 00:26:00.282, Speaker A: I mean, I have a lot of addresses. I don't know which nfts I've bought and hold and where they are. Zappa is really good at that. Zappa is amazing at finding the assets that you don't know where they are. Right. And what address they're in. So really cool to see this from them here.
00:26:00.282 - 00:26:21.240, Speaker A: And there's actually a toggle as well. So you can just toggle this on and off if you don't really want to see your nfts. The only issue with this is that it shows you a price. But because nfts are inherently non fungible, their price is not exactly accurate. Right. Just because someone bought an NFT for a certain price, like once upon a time, doesn't mean that they're going to buy. Someone's going to buy the NFT for that same price.
00:26:21.240 - 00:26:48.202, Speaker A: Now, I think this is the function of we don't have very liquid markets for these things yet, and that will improve with time. But. So, yeah, if you do see prices on there for your nfts. Don't get your hopes up because it's most likely you won't be able to get those prices, especially if they're like the lesser known random nfts and not things like crypto punks or whatever. Right. So, yeah, definitely go check this out if you haven't yet. So the next rebalance for the Defi pulse index is coming up.
00:26:48.202 - 00:27:21.688, Speaker A: It happens once a month, and they've posted kind of what the rebalancing and weights will be. What's really interesting is that it's going to be purchasing another $8.3 million of sushi, which is 0.44% of the total supply of sushi, which I thought was really cool. Right. I mean, this is, I mean, and the rebalancing here is based on kind of like the market cap and the weight of, of the market cap within the index. So I think it's going to be selling some aave for, for sushi here or some other ones for sushi as well, which I thought was, was pretty interesting.
00:27:21.688 - 00:27:37.628, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, that's a lot of sushi, $8.3 million. Right. And this is quite a large rebalance because the, the total market cap of the DPI, I think, is over $150 million now. So this is some of the biggest kind of rebalancing within Defi today. So, yeah, I mean, and plus 0.44% of the supply.
00:27:37.628 - 00:28:02.738, Speaker A: That's huge. Right. And this plays into meta governance as well, where eventually, not, not currently, because to participate in governance, you have to stake sushi, I'm pretty sure. But eventually there'll be a way to kind of do meta governance here with sushi, I imagine. And that'll be play into it as well, where index token holders can actually use those tokens to vote on proposals within the sushi ecosystem. And holding 0.4% of the total supply is a pretty healthy chunk of the vote, I think.
00:28:02.738 - 00:28:37.088, Speaker A: So, yeah. Really cool to see that. All right, finally from the block, they posted a kind of news piece here saying, I guess the SEC commissioner, Hester Pearce, has actually called for legal clarity and the freedom to experiment for DeFi. Now, there's a choice quote in the article here, and I'll read it out to you. So Hester says here that regulators need to provide both legal clarity and the freedom to experiment so that DeFi can compete with CFI to offer investors financial services. I read that again. So that DeFi can compete with c five.
00:28:37.088 - 00:28:45.806, Speaker A: I love this. Right. This is it. This is what we want to do. Right. And if you can kind of, like, blow up the regulatory hurdles to doing this, especially in the US. Right.
00:28:45.806 - 00:29:13.618, Speaker A: This is going to become, like, much easier for entrepreneurs to build new tools. I think we're still kind of hamstrung by that. I know a lot of us based teams are definitely hamstrung by that and they can't do what they want. So if we create like, a regulatory sandbox for this sort of stuff, we can have some amazing experimentation going on within DeFi for us based teams. And, you know, a lot of countries around the world. World follow the US regulations as well. So that's going to kind of like, have domino effects there, too, which I, which I kind of really like.
00:29:13.618 - 00:29:37.156, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, it's just great to have someone like Hester, who's pro crypto, you know, as the SEC commissioner, and, you know, influencing kind of like, the politics around this here, which I thought was really cool. And, yeah, I mean, that quote just there just says it all, right. I don't really have to say much more than that. I think, you know, she. What else is she saying? There's a quote here about, like, the anti Wall street sentiments. I mean, this is a. Is a pretty healthy piece.
00:29:37.156 - 00:30:21.844, Speaker A: Yes. You can go read it in the YouTube description, but I mean, just generally, any kind of positive regulatory news is great. I just, I. One thing I do kind of fear, I mean, I don't fear it too much, but I think one thing that can kind of, like, put a pause on the ecosystem is very harsh regulations. Now, I don't think that's going to happen, but if for some reason someone kind of got in and said, I hate crypto, right. I want to regulate the crap out of it, they could, they could choke the fiat on ramps, they could choke the innovation in the US, and it would take a little while, but the US would lose this innovation to other kind of like countries and other places around the world because crypto is global. But it would put a bit of a dampener on Defi because the US accounts for a lot of the, I guess, activity within defi.
00:30:21.844 - 00:30:40.308, Speaker A: Right. The US dollar still dominates, kind of like the stable coin arena. So, yeah, I hope that more friendly regulatory kind of news is coming out. You know, I think the tether news was huge. I think this is just, you know, this is big as well. I think hopefully we'll get more positive news going into the future. But anyway, I digress for now.
