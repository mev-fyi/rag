00:00:00.800 - 00:00:09.514, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Delegate drive thru. I'm your host, Anthony Zosano, and I'm here with Eric Conner today to talk about all things ethereum. Hey, Eric, how you going?
00:00:09.894 - 00:00:29.474, Speaker B: Yo, we back, we back, we back four months later. Yeah, exactly. I had someone comment on the. I tweeted like two days ago, I was doing this with you and someone commented like they liked the randomness and not knowing what we're going to do. This is kind of funny, but yeah, we're definitely random at it. But hey, we're still going. We haven't fully ruck pulled yet.
00:00:29.964 - 00:01:03.760, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I think, like, we do these episodes probably at like, the most relevant and right times to do them. Uh, you know, I did tease on Twitter that we'd be talking, or farcaster, actually, that we would, we'd be talking about kind of our price target for ETH this cycle and how we kind of arrived at that number. And I remember doing these episodes with, like, uh, DC investor and, um, Cyrus uNEsc back in the day, like on bankless, like back last cycle. And, like, going back and re watching. That was hilarious because, like, you were really bearish, I guess, compared to us. You were saying, oh, 2500, right.
00:01:03.760 - 00:01:28.824, Speaker A: And then, like, DC, I remember, was like super bullish. It was like ten k plus or something. And, like, it just landed in like the middle, I guess, at like five k. But I think that this time around, we have something different. We have the ETF's, right? Like, and I think that's going to play a huge part in how this cycle plays out, has already played a huge part in it. And I think that that's the first thing I wanted to talk about today with regards to kind of this meme of the four year cycle. Right.
00:01:28.824 - 00:01:50.200, Speaker A: And I think that when we've you actually broken out of that at this point, like, BTC hit, like 50k today. I mean, for those of you who are listening, listening to this, we're recording this on like, the, what's my 13th? Uh, the Tuesday. And this is probably going to go out on the Saturday. So it's probably going to be a few days. But BTC hit 50k today. And I think that that has broken, like, the traditional four year cycle. It's accelerated it by at least three to six months or something.
00:01:50.200 - 00:02:26.232, Speaker A: Uh, because usually you would wait until, like, the halving and then the halving would happen and then BTC would go up, like, after that, and then it would hit all time highs. But it kind of feels like the momentum right now means that we could see all time highs in Q two. Like, that's how, I mean, frothy things up. And the thing is, I think it's a kind of justified froth to an extent, because we were just discussing this a little bit off air. Uh, basically, people just completely misread the ETF stuff. Like, I think a lot of crypto natives just do not understand how tradfi works and do not understand how ETF's work. And they figured that, oh, it'll be a sell the news event, which I guess it was for a little bit of time, but, you know, it's a sell the news event.
00:02:26.232 - 00:02:57.368, Speaker A: Grayscale has, like, these GPTC outflows, whatever, and so on and so forth. And then the reality was that these ETF's that went live, some of the biggest ETF launches in ETF history. Right? Like, in terms of the volumes that they've brought in. So I think, yeah, there's just, like, I've been a massive amount of people sidelined, and now the FOMO is really kicking in. Since BTC has gone to 50k, ETH is moving as well. Of course it's lagged a little bit, but we'll get into that. But, yeah, I mean, Eric, I've mentioned this tons of times when we've done podcasts before, but you have the, you know, typical trad five background before you got into crypto.
00:02:57.368 - 00:03:06.084, Speaker A: You're definitely more plugged into that world than most, I would think. Like, what's your view on. On all of that? Like, did people, you know, severely underestimate things? Like, I kind of assume they did?
00:03:06.824 - 00:03:36.724, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's funny to even have this conversation going back, I mean, gosh, what, six years now, if you go back to, like, into the ether episodes where we were kind of predicting this would happen around now. And I think. I think the people. What people miss most, and I agree with you, I think a shockingly amount, a large amount of people are sidelined right now. Like, even, like, kind of hardcore crypto people on Twitter. I just get the vibe that they're not like 100% in, maybe they're like 30% not their 100% allocation. And I think where people fumbled this bag was.
00:03:36.724 - 00:04:29.878, Speaker B: Everyone in crypto is used to the typical memes of sell the news, buy the rumor, sell the news, and that just becomes this Twitter narrative when Twitter narratives take off in crypto and a small community we have, or I would say we had. Sure, that's what everybody starts buying into this starts snowballing and you see it in baron and bull cycles and all the emotion of crypto, Twitter, and just in the graphs, everything snowballs and people start believing it's almost self fulfilling. So everyone was like, oh, it's clearly a sell the news event that was self fulfilling for, like, three weeks. But I was kind of hammering it on Twitter, kind of joking about it, like, oh, great, you guys are smart for, like, a couple of weeks, but you're going to be wrong. And the reason they're wrong is we just invited a whole new audience of people and capital into the crypto markets with this ETF stuff, right? We. We've. And you and I have hit on this so much in the past.
00:04:29.878 - 00:05:05.894, Speaker B: It's like, we're comfortable investing in Coinbase. We're comfortable self custodying our own wallets. We're comfortable in uniswap and onboarding off Coinbase, uniswap and doing all this stuff. A lot of people want their financial investor to tell them it's now safe to buy crypto, or they want to buy it through e trade or fidelity or whatever it might be. And ETF's open that up, right? And a lot of people have 401K funds that they weren't able to buy crypto with. I mean, you could, you could buy, like, futures and stuff. But in general, people were kind of waiting, like, I know we don't like this in crypto, but they're kind of waiting for this, like, stamp of approval from, like, higher beings in the financial world.
00:05:05.894 - 00:05:32.498, Speaker B: Right? And I think people just grossly underestimate how much buying power is there. Now, we've tapped into this. I mean, it's trillions of dollars with the capital that we had previously tapped into, that can be, like, buying now. And I think it was no coincidence. We're recording this on my Monday at 08:30 p.m. But, like, when the markets open for me this morning at 06:30 a.m. Here on the west coast, all of a sudden, bitcoin and ETH took off, right.
00:05:32.498 - 00:05:59.774, Speaker B: And bitcoin led. But there's no coincidence that the bidding is happening now during market hours, which is kind of funny. Like, we're kind of dead now. Like, in the middle of the night us time and on the weekends. There's a lot of money trickling in now. A lot of institutions, I think, are, like, getting more in now and stuff because they're seeing all this happen. But I think where the crypto community missed is, like, our little memes and our little echo chamber of Twitter and Al Farcaster.
00:05:59.774 - 00:06:39.434, Speaker B: That stuff is kind of being overtaken by the bigger allocations of funds, like, whether it's the institutions or just the combined capital of retail normies kind of buying in their 401 ks or buying in their brokerage portfolios now. And that stuff adds up, right? And, like, can you imagine these guys telling their friends and neighbors, like, I bought the bitcoin ETF, like, today, and it's up 7%. I mean, 7% to these people is, like, crazy. And I don't mean like these people, but it is like Normie finance, right? Like seven to 10% is, like, what you kind of hope for in the entire year. And I think we're going to see that snowball. Like, that. Access to crypto now is going to be a total game changer for people.
00:06:40.574 - 00:07:21.470, Speaker A: It's funny because, like, the people who have the most money are, like, the most conservative, right? Like, they're the ones who want to protect their capital, but that's where a lot of the wealth is concentrated. And as you said, these people don't move unless their financial advisor tells them to move, especially into things that are considered super risky, like crypto assets, which is hilarious to me because bitcoin is worth a trillion dollars right now, right? It's a trillion dollar market cap. Like, it's bigger than most stocks in terms of market cap. So for people to kind of still think that bitcoin is risky is more of a perception thing. And that's what the ETF's have really done is it's changed the perception around BTC. And in the future, it's going to change it around ETH as well, where it's where people go, oh, wow, okay. Blackrock is putting their weight behind this thing.
00:07:21.470 - 00:07:51.782, Speaker A: You know, it must be legit, right? It must be here to stay. I got to get in. And as you said, like, because crypto still moves, you know, pretty, pretty, I guess, like violently or is pretty volatile even. BTC and ETH, this, this is, again, a selling point for people that have never had exposure before because they're suddenly looking at this asset that they bought. You know, as you said, they're going up a few percentage points in a day and they're like, oh, my God. Wow, what the hell? Like, what the hell is going on? Right? So it is a kind of self fulfilling thing. And I think that BTC obviously has, has gotten such a bid from it.
00:07:51.782 - 00:08:23.546, Speaker A: I mean, if you go back to June last year when Blackrock first filed for it, like, BTC was at 25K, so if you bought then and then just held for the last, like six, seven months or whatever it is, you'd be up like double your money on the safest asset in crypto, arguably, right? And you'd be up on ETH. You'd be up on a lot, a lot of things, to be honest. But as you said, like, it just seems like so many crypto natives is so sidelined right now. They're like, coping that we're going up. They're like, oh, no, this is going to sell back down. BTC is going to, then I'll buy there. It's like, guys like the ETF's, they're not going to, they're not waiting for this.
00:08:23.546 - 00:09:06.914, Speaker A: They're passively flow, passive flow vehicles, right? Like, they're not going to wait to buy the dip and things like that. Like, the crypto natives are. They're basically going to be like, okay, well, I'm allocating 1% of my portfolio to this BTC ETF right now, and 1% of the money that's in tradfi that the boomers have especially is a lot of money. People don't realize that it's a lot of money. So that alone will just kind of keep the, you know, keep the price kind of up and keep, keep things going very nicely. And I think that we're just, like, generally entering, you know, the, I guess, soon to be kind of frothy phase of the bull market, the normal bull market that we see in crypto. So it's going to be very interesting to see what the dynamic is like because, you know, BTC has its ETF, as I said before, I, you know, it's going to get its ETF's relatively soon.
00:09:06.914 - 00:09:32.092, Speaker A: I do believe it's actually going to happen in May, to be honest. Like May 2030 is that first deadline there. We can touch on that in a sec. But it's going to be interesting to see what happens to the other assets because people are already fading, the other assets saying, oh, none of this is going to trickle down because, you know, the boomers can't access these assets. They can only buy BTC and then ETH. It's like, what do you mean? Like, who do you think owns all the BTC and ETH right now? It's the crypto natives. And what do you think they're going to do when they start suddenly come into all this new money? They're going to go down the risk curve like they typically do.
00:09:32.092 - 00:10:06.284, Speaker A: So people kind of trying to fade the other things as well. It's just hilarious to me because it's like BTC Max is just like yelling, oh, it's just BTC, you know, just by, it's like, yeah, okay, maybe that works over long term, but people are still going to gamble, people are still going to speculate. Like, crypto natives are still crypto natives. And we've even been seeing this play out over just the last few months. A lot of people who were in BTC made a lot of money because of the ETF kind of speculation, and then they've rolled that into other things. So I think that people really need to be aware of the fact that there's always going to be that pool of money. It's got, I guess it's that hot ball of money, as they call it, that's just still going to rotate through things.
00:10:06.284 - 00:10:18.220, Speaker A: But over the longer term, obviously, like, you're not going to keep most of your portfolio in these things, right? You keep it in the safer assets, or at least the assets that you consider to be safer. But that's my kind of general view on things. Clay. Yeah.
00:10:18.252 - 00:11:06.904, Speaker B: I think one important thing that you said is a lot of the financial wealth, especially in the boomer generation, or just even in our generation, I don't think much of that is allocated to crypto at all. I have some non crypto family and friends that do have a decent crypto allocation now, but even that's like, I don't know, 5% of their total portfolio. And I have a lot of people that have said to me, oh, yeah, like my financial advisor doesn't recommend it yet, but how much would you recommend investing? And they sell like 0%, but they want to like get to five to 10%. Like, I think people don't realize how under invested people really are to this asset class. When you look at like, the world as a whole. Yeah. Like a lot of us might be like mentally ill and have 100% of our net worth.
00:11:06.904 - 00:11:27.540, Speaker B: Like, that's not the normal person out there. Right. And I think this ETF, ETF is like the stamp of legitimacy to that. Um, and I think what's going to be interesting is, will be the. I agree with you. I think ETH will get approved. Um, I mean, first of all, like Larry Finks behind it, he's like 564 and one in ETF approvals.
00:11:27.540 - 00:12:29.744, Speaker B: Like everybody, like uh, like Franklin Templeton or whatever, filed for it today. Like, there's a lot of reputable institutions now where I think this starts to get really interesting is so theres two parts of this. I want to talk about your part about this trickling down, which I agree with you. But first, are we drawing a line in the sand of ETF approved crypto assets? And lets say thats bitcoin and ETH. Theres a clear line not just in market cap at that point, but just in globally accepted. I dont want to say the government has to give it stamp of approval, but I think it play, it speaks to bitcoin and east drive to become money and become decentralized and have smaller blocks and don't become centralized and truly become money and have a low issuance policy or even a deflationary policy. I think all this is important and I don't think there's a single crypto that will ever exist in the future.
00:12:29.744 - 00:13:34.356, Speaker B: This isn't me being an ETH max, but that will exist, that will have the same kind of reputation and traits as bitcoin and ethwood to that point. And that's not to say another cryptos not going to get an ETF approval, but I think in the short term bitcoin and ETF and then theres going to be this line drawn to other assets and that doesnt mean those assets arent going to go up. But when people look at those two, theyre going to think of them in the same league. And thats important for ETH is why as a community weve been hitting on decentralization and money aspects and money traits and low inflation and sound monetary policy. Those things are all paying off. Right. And so im with you, I think it will come in May and if it does, thats a very interesting dynamic now for the crypto community and of course well then flow down now if e starts getting a bid like BTC is, I mean thats going to get interesting right because we all know the perspective of, oh, bitcoins 60,000 and ETH is only 2600.
00:13:34.356 - 00:13:49.036, Speaker B: Like normies kind of think like this right. They don't think about market cap, oh, it's cheaper. It could go up more. And these are like the two assets they're looking at. That gap's going to start to close in my opinion right. Just because of those like very simple things. Like I'm, I've been a proponent that we should 1001 split ETH.
00:13:49.036 - 00:14:04.252, Speaker B: I know it's going to like wreck smart contracts. We don't actually do it. But if either went down to like $2 tomorrow or the same market cap, it would get bit up like crazy. That's just how people think. So now you kind of got this like newer assets that's approved for ETF. It's not just bitcoin anymore. Kind of this shiny new toy for people.
00:14:04.252 - 00:14:33.266, Speaker B: To them it's quote unquote cheaper. I guess from a market perspective, market caps perspective it is. I mean if you get that bid on ETH, things could get crazy, right? Um, I don't, I don't want to go like too nuts with my predictions. I know I was under last but to me 20k seems very like achievable. I put out a tweet a couple of weeks ago. If you take BTC is multiple. I always think east like one cycle behind every cycle you hear multiplier from bottom tops can get less, right? Because it's harder to move up with market cap.
00:14:33.266 - 00:15:03.666, Speaker B: If you take BTC's multiplier from last cycle, I think it was 22 x which would put I think bottom at 890. It puts us at like, I think right below 20k. Like 19,300 or something and blow through. And I know people think fifty k, one hundred k, who knows? I shoot on the downside usually. I mean 20k would be great and that's a mean line it pushes through. But I think just that like that line that could get drawn in the sand for crypto is very interesting. Will money flow down then? Of course.
00:15:03.666 - 00:15:27.530, Speaker B: Right? We always see that. And I don't think the fund really starts to all time highs or blown through. I know this like is the start of a bull market. But the real fun of a bull market is ETH goes past 4900 and BTC goes past 69,000 and we're in price discovery and then shit just gets crazy. I mean you don't know where it's going. Random shit coins are pumping 300% on the day. That's when it gets fun.
00:15:27.530 - 00:15:45.104, Speaker B: But I'm curious your thoughts. Do you see that same kind of line being drawn after ETH gets approved for the next few years? Do you think those are just going to be the two to you? How important is that from a money flow bid and that perspective from investors?
00:15:46.084 - 00:16:25.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think even outside of the ETF's the line has been drawn for a long time. Because if you look at BTC and Eats combined market cap right now, if im going to Coingecko and I look at it, its like 1.3 trillion, right? The total market cap is one point or 2 trillion takeaway stablecoins 1.8. So you have $500 billion in like other assets. Most of that is concentrated in things like BNB and XRP, which is just crazy to me and a few others there. But if you actually look at, you were talking about market caps, if you actually look at the long tail of crypto assets, like Im talking about things that are outside of the top ten, theyre all under $10 billion market cap, right. They are all extremely small compared to big.
00:16:25.814 - 00:16:42.680, Speaker A: Thats 1% of bitcoins market cap, by the way, for people kind of tracking at home, thats 1%. A $10 billion market cap is 1%, um, of ETH. It's, you know, it's, I guess like, uh, what is it, four, 5% or something like that. Right. I'm just doing rough math. Top of my head. These things are incredibly small compared to Ethan BTC.
00:16:42.680 - 00:17:10.632, Speaker A: So it does, as you said, take a lot more money to move ethan BTC and a lot less money to move other things. Does that mean these other things are going to be good long term investments? No, because it works both ways. Like, if these things are just going up because it's a crypto bull market and everything's pumping, then they're going to be the first things that get sold off once the bear market hits, because no one actually wants to hold them. They're just gambling on them, basically. Right. So, uh, again, that, that line in the sand has been drawn, I think, before the ETF's. And I think the ETF's are just going to exacerbate that because as I said before, the ETF's are a passive vehicle.
00:17:10.632 - 00:17:36.596, Speaker A: Right. There's going to be a lot of people just putting money in, like every paycheck as part of their retirement account. Right. Um, every paycheck going in there passively over time. They're not going to wait to try and, like, time the crypto cycles, like crypto natives have traditionally done. They, they're definitely just going to be like this passive buyer of these assets. And that, again, is going to concentrate a lot more market cap, I believe, in BTC and ETH, uh, and a lot less than these other things, uh, you know, outside of bull markets, obviously.
00:17:36.596 - 00:18:01.282, Speaker A: Like, as you said, like, once you get past all time high, things get really crazy. Everything just starts going up, you know, indiscriminately. But I'm looking at it from like a. I don't know if I was stick a five year window. That's what I'm kind of looking at it in. I'm not looking at it in a kind of one year peak bull market window or six to twelve months peak bull market window, because if you look at that, then of course, you can go, oh, doge outperformed everything. I was like, yeah, for like, three months, right? Like, it doesn't count because if you caught the bottom and top, good on you.
00:18:01.282 - 00:18:49.076, Speaker A: But most people didn't. So I think I look at it from, like, a five year window, and I'm, okay, what's Ethan BTSE going to be like in five years in terms of market cap? What's the other thing's going to be like and how they performed against BTC and ETH? I think their performance is going to get a lot worse over these kind of longer periods because of those, those ETF's bringing in that money. And as you said, it's a fresh, untapped pool of money. Like, almost all of this money has never touched crypto before, I would, I would wager. Right? So it's definitely a fresh, untapped pool. And I think we needed it, honestly, to get to the next level because I feel like we had, we hadn't tapped everything, but a lot of the money that was coming into crypto, I think, came in in 2020, 2021 from the normal retail users already, especially in places like the US and Europe, where they already had easy access to this stuff. And we needed this next step in order to get us to the next level here, in order to get these market caps into the trillions of dollars.
00:18:49.076 - 00:19:20.516, Speaker A: But as you said earlier, we were talking about this a long time ago on the into the ether episodes. I mean, I'd love to find the episode where I do distinctly remember you saying or talking about ETF, saying that you don't expect it to happen for a while, but eventually it will happen. And we're basically there right now. Right. We're basically kind of there in 2024, which did take a while, but we're there now. It kind of accelerates from here. And I guess the last thing on the ETF stuff as well, before we move on to how we get to 20K ETH this cycle, is that people are kind of meming that these other assets are going to get ETF's.
00:19:20.516 - 00:19:43.290, Speaker A: Like, maybe eventually they do. But the timeline for this happening is, like, from what I've seen, minimum three years. Minimum three years for any other assets even think about getting an ETF. And it's not because these other assets are securities or the SSE is trying to label them as securities. It's not because we're ETH maxis and we think that all the other assets are trash. It's the simple reason that there is a very defined path to getting an ETF. You have to have a CME futures market.
00:19:43.290 - 00:20:08.392, Speaker A: That's literally the bare minimum. There are no other CME futures markets except BTC and ETH right now for crypto assets, as far as I know. I don't think there are. So until you actually see another asset get that futures market, its chances of getting an ETF is 0%. And then once they actually get that market, you need to wait like, two, three years before the SEC would be comfortable actually approving these things. So, again, that's why I say minimum three years before you see any of the other assets. So, Ethan, BTSC will stand alone here.
00:20:08.392 - 00:20:35.746, Speaker A: Do I like that? That's the case? I mean, from a kind of, like, competition perspective? Not necessarily. But at the same time, like, I'm, you know, I can't control this. It's not me. It's. It's. It's the way these things work, right? It's the way trad five works. And honestly, if I'm putting my kind of, I guess, biased hat on here, I wouldn't want to be putting dog shit assets in front of, like, people that have, like, retirement accounts and they're putting them into, like, you know what I mean? Like, there is some level of kind of responsibility, I think, as well, of.
00:20:35.746 - 00:21:02.222, Speaker A: Of kind of. I wouldn't say protecting people from themselves, but, man, like, the amount of, like, low education that would exist. And if you start put giving legitimacy to these assets that really, like, a lot of them are just borderline scams to me and you like, and they borderline not. Not great from a. Not just investment perspective, but just from a kind of, like, perspective of this space getting like, a bad name, as it usually does. But at the end of the day, people can invest in whatever they want. They still have access to these assets on other platforms if they really want to buy them.
00:21:02.222 - 00:21:22.194, Speaker A: But, yeah, it's kind of a thing where that's how the SEC is going to be thinking about it. That's how the regulators are going to be thinking about it as well. And that's the kind of final thing on that one. But unless you have anything left to add on the ETF stuff, I want to get into how ETH is going to 20k because I think people are like, they hear this number and like, okay, 20k, that's like moon math, but, like, how are we getting there? So if you want to move on to that, we can.
00:21:22.494 - 00:21:51.274, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds good to me. I think the only thing I'll say on that is like, I agree. Like, we're not, I would never cheer for an ETF rejection for another crypto, but I do think it's important that the process is kind of like followed. And I, I think even though maybe the SEC is frustrating and these approvals have been frustrating at the same time, like it seems like the proper path, like for bitcoin to just recently get one for eat to be next, there be like a little break and let's like see who maybe is up next legitimacy wise. But like it kind of seems like it's playing out fine to me so far.
00:21:51.734 - 00:22:16.654, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And the funny thing is some people might be disappointed that XRP might be the next one to get an ETF simply because they won a court case against the SEC. Right. So some people might be just like be careful what you wish for. I mean, unless you're holding XRP, then you're going to be happy. But regardless of that. So how are we getting to 20k? So I want to make clear that my kind of quote unquote official prediction for this cycle is like 15 to 20k.
00:22:16.654 - 00:22:43.264, Speaker A: Like I don't know if we're going to get to 20k. Like as you said, there are these kind of like diminishing returns with the multipliers and stuff like that. And then if everyone's expecting 20k, right, it might just kind of settle at 15k because everyone's expecting it and so on and so forth. ETF's throw a wrench into this though. Like we don't know how that's going to act, of course. But yeah, I do think that its path to like 15 to 20k is pretty, pretty clear from here for a number of different reasons. And I think the obvious, most, the most obvious reason is obviously the ETF.
00:22:43.264 - 00:23:24.762, Speaker A: Like if you believe the ethics are going to get approved this year, particularly in May, which is the first deadlines, our first final deadlines, I should say, then that is a huge catalyst and we probably could even be up at like 4k or something by the time that happens, right? Similar to what happened with BTC where the market just basically priced it in. We come down a bit after that and then we can kind of continue up to all time highs sort of thing. You know, it could play out in a similar way. But that's like the, the, I think the, the biggest catalyst to be honest, like I can't think of anything bigger than that in terms of just bringing in fresh new money to get us to those levels. But then there are so many other things that are going on within crypto that. Crypto native things, ethereum native things, right? There's the restaking thing happening, which we never had before. Like this is brand new stuff right now, right? There's the fact that it continues to be deflationary.
00:23:24.762 - 00:24:03.918, Speaker A: There's the fact that like a lot of the execution risk of Ethereum is basically gone because we did the merge, right? We did it in a bear market, we got staking withdrawals done. And now way more people are staking now because of restaking and things like that, right? We have a very defined Ethereum roadmap at this point, which is very, which is something that the ETF issuers can actually break down for their clients and say, hey, you know, Ethereum is this kind of like roadmap, it's executing on it, blah, blah, so on and so forth. We have all these kind of material here. We have the L2s that are now available for people to use, and we're improving them all the time. Right. Then they've got direct integrations with centralized exchanges. All these new users are going to be funneled into things like base, because Coinbase has a vested interest in base doing well.
00:24:03.918 - 00:24:36.092, Speaker A: They're going to be funneled into arbitrum and they're going to and polygon, all these other l two ecosystems, they're going to be funneled into there instead of l one main net. Again, they're not going to have to pay the high fees. They can enjoy the cheaper fees there. And that obviously reinforces ETH as money gets ETH into more people's hands, because ETH is used to pay the little fees on the network, it's used as money on the network, so on and so forth. So there are all just these massive catalysts that we haven't had before, really. They're kind of brand new, especially restaking, like restaking in the ETF's, I think, are the two main ones because they're the brand new ones that haven't happened before. So from a fundamental perspective, it's very strong.
00:24:36.092 - 00:25:03.048, Speaker A: But then a narrative perspective as well. It's very strong, right. Because the narrative is typically more powerful than the reality over the short to medium term, especially during crypto bull markets where people start kind of shilling these things as being like the thing that's over bullets, right? The things that are going to solve everything. It's going to be amazing and awesome, so on and so forth. And it's not until the bear market that you see the reality kind of set in. So I think that it's going to be a massive driver going forward for ETH value accrual. And I also think that we're going to see a trend start soon.
00:25:03.048 - 00:25:41.774, Speaker A: I put a tweet out about this with projects airdropping their tokens to eat stakers. And we already have a lot of liquid restaking projects that have confirmed they're doing tokens, etherfy, puffer and swell the ones at the top. Off the top of my head, they have already confirmed that they're doing tokens. They've got airdrop or kind of like points farming thing going on right now. And they're liquid risk taking protocols, which means that they're going to airdrop to a stakers that stake with them. And then, you know, they have a choice to airdrop to solo stakers as well, which I think that they might. So there's going to be a lot of kind of airdrops going towards ETH stakers, which is going to increase the demand for ETH because you got, you have to obviously, purchase Ethan order to stake it, right.
00:25:41.774 - 00:26:00.806, Speaker A: So there's just all these kind of flywheel effect drivers happening that are all going to feed off of each other. And then if we're in a crypto bull market, these airdrops are going to be. End up, be worth a lot, right. Because there's a lot of capital ready to just bid these things and to just kind of keep the market caps high from. From the kind of fomo. And then those airdrops end up being huge. Absolutely massive.
00:26:00.806 - 00:26:24.918, Speaker A: And that brings in more capital. So, like, I guess, like, the point is, is that there is just so many demand drivers on ETH right now, and there's not that much ETH on the market, especially because we're deflationary, too. So it's just less and less ETH on the market. People like to use ETH as a store of value and as a money. We're going to have the fresh capital coming in from the ETH ETF's. Like, I'm actually amazed that ETH is still at whatever it is, 26 50 right now. Like, I actually think that it's crazy that ETH is this low.
00:26:24.918 - 00:26:37.634, Speaker A: And we're actually going to talk about ETH BTC as well after I get your thoughts on ETH USD. But that's kind of my view on the path to 15 to think. Obviously, you probably have, like, a similar view here as well on all of this, but I'd love to get your kind of take on that side of things.
00:26:38.094 - 00:26:58.730, Speaker B: Yeah. I honestly think we're about to see a slingshot for many reasons. I think people had been kind of harping on the wrong narratives out there in the crypto community for the last few months. And I think I want to call this bull market. The theme is the Larry Fink supply shrink. So basically, you hit on most of that, right, but Larry Fink, that's great. I love that.
00:26:58.762 - 00:27:03.082, Speaker A: Larry Frink supplies. That should be a meme on. On Twitter or something.
00:27:03.258 - 00:27:21.466, Speaker B: Yeah, let's meme that up. I want to make a couple images. I'll put them out there. But, you know, we got Larry Fink on the ETF side and all the trad. Five guys trying to buy up Ethan. And, like, one thing I think I saw, I think Blackrock alone owns, like, and their ETF owns, like, 1% of all BTC. I think, like, one to 3% of all BTC.
00:27:21.490 - 00:27:27.334, Speaker A: I think. Yeah, it was almost like 300,000 BTC or something's already in the ETF's. Like, something crazy, right?
00:27:27.754 - 00:28:09.342, Speaker B: So, like, think about that. Like, that's ETH that potentially is going to get swallowed up by ETF's and that's growing every day. And then to your points with, like, the restaking and just staking in general, and especially if airdrops start happening as stakers, people want to stake more, like. And you have deflationary ETH, which is happening already, like, early in the bear bull market. Imagine, like, if all this airdrop farming starts happening and eats going up, like, eats going to be very deflationary, the supply shrink is crazy. And you have this demand on the ETF side and just general bull market side, I mean, it's just, like, waiting to be lit on fire. Right? And I know 20K maybe sounds crazy to people, but at the same time, that's less than ten x from here.
00:28:09.342 - 00:28:15.434, Speaker B: Right. And we've already been. What are we already up from bottom already? Three x from bottom?
00:28:15.554 - 00:28:23.730, Speaker A: Yeah, about three x, yeah, yeah, three x, I think over three x now. 880, I think, was the bottom. Yeah. So we just over three x. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:28:23.802 - 00:28:49.570, Speaker B: I mean, it's less than ten x to go to know, like we've said, I want to be very clear. As market cap gets bigger, it's harder to do at ten x. Right. We're no longer at $80 and that's only 800 freeze. But, you know, I think with all these things about to happen, it's. Doesn't seem too hard to me. I mean, shit, ten k is less than four x from here, right? So, I mean, we're not far from these numbers, even though they sound huge.
00:28:49.570 - 00:29:30.032, Speaker B: And I think the tailwinds and the narratives that are about to take place for ETH, I mean, like I said, Larry thinks supply strength. Like, you combine these things, this, and people are going to start thinking, oh, man, eats like deflationary. And there's restaking, and people are staking and locking things up for airdrops and ETF demand, and then it starts clicking in people's head, right? And I think we always see this early in bull cycles, this narrative focus from most of crypto Twitter around fast, large block blockchains. And we've been through this three or four times. I don't even want to get into names and blah, blah, blah. We've had this conversation so many times. But this is always the narrative early on, low fees, fast blockchains.
00:29:30.032 - 00:30:12.892, Speaker B: And then people start to think, okay, what's the long term investment thesis here? What's the inflation rate of this asset? Do I really need a lot of it to use this network? Inflationary? Is it deflationary? Is it a money? Is it not? Does it have an ETF? Does it not? Like, all these things start to add up from an investor standpoint, sure, maybe the users, whatever. I don't even want to go into it. But then you start thinking about, like, L2. They're all launching. We have the ETH upgrade soon, come in with blobs. It's going to make L2 a lot cheaper for users to use. I personally think the UX, like you mentioned, remember, by the way, we were doing podcasts well before Coinbase and exchanges allowed you to withdraw for free to L2.
00:30:12.892 - 00:30:37.854, Speaker B: And we were saying, like, a Ux holy grail will be when Coinbase lets you withdraw all these L2s. We have that now. I think, in general, the ETH L2 ex disaster talk is totally fud, pretty much made up exclusively by people that hate ethereum. Can it be better? Of course any of this can be better. We all know metamask can be better. Layer two UX can be better. Is it fine? Yeah, like, you could.
00:30:37.854 - 00:30:44.670, Speaker B: If you want to get on arbitrum, it's very easy to get on there pretty much for free, right? And use it. Um, fragmentation.
00:30:44.702 - 00:30:44.822, Speaker A: All.
00:30:44.838 - 00:31:12.666, Speaker B: That's a totally different debate. But all this starts to add up, and, like, people slowly think, like, okay, well, what asset am I actually investing in? Um, and I think ETH starts to become a lot more attractive as it happens. Now, what's funny is, right. Like, as price goes up, of course, it becomes more attractive people. Oh, now it's going up, right. It looks great, but I think one, I just quickly want to hit on airdropping to solo stickers. I'm a little surprised this hasn't happened yet.
00:31:12.666 - 00:31:53.886, Speaker B: And I think when it does happen, it's going to start a waterfall effect of this, because if you are a new project or a L2 or whatever that's doing an airdrop, like that seems like a great user base to drop to, right? Like, these people are clearly invested in ETH. Like they've learned how to solo stake. They're probably still staking if you're doing an airdrop to them. Um, like that seems like the crowd you would want to give, like part of your airdrop to, right? Like it seems like a crowd that's not going to just take it probably and instantly dump it or like fudd it or like weird things like that. Right. So I think that's a pretty cool thing to see. I'll be interested to see how it's done, how many projects do it.
00:31:53.886 - 00:32:30.918, Speaker B: Um, I would probably think, like L2s, like I mentioned, would be like kind of the first to try it out, um, for multiple reasons, but yeah. And then we get into the whole restaking thing, which that I think I personally haven't staked in layer yet, just cause, I don't know, I'm pretty risk averse at this point to my ETH. But, um, I know a lot of people are, there's a lot of ETH in there. They're going to be worth billions of dollars. A lot of people are going to make a lot of money there. Um, and just kind of more importantly, like, the use cases, the data availability layer, they're going to be doing to kind of make things cheaper in general for users. I mean, the mind share is still an ease.
00:32:30.918 - 00:32:57.270, Speaker B: I know, like, people get distracted by all this chain launch. It's cheaper. But if you actually think about the innovation and mind share that's out there, you always want to follow that. BTC had this first mover and they lowered the iq of their narrative, which to them has worked for them. Digital gold. We're going to keep it simple. We're going to claim we're always going to have zero issue, or eventually zero issue.
00:32:57.270 - 00:33:33.334, Speaker B: It's low inflation. ETH has fallen in this weird middle ground where it's like, we're going to be innovative, we're going to try things, but it's going to take time. And then you kind of have these competitors that have come in on the other side say that promise all these crazy things. But when you really break it down and really think about the asset you're investing in, I mean, it's hard to beat ETH, right? But those narratives are complex and can take a while for people to digest. And I think that's just what we're seeing. But once this fire gets lit under ETH, and once the ETF comes and the supply shrink, I mean, in my opinion, it's going to blow up. That's personally why I see it going to beyond.
00:33:34.014 - 00:33:57.398, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And I think, like, the competitors kind of discussion is an interesting one, and it's probably something that a lot of people think about. Like, as you said, like, this has been the same thing every cycle, really, for ETH. And I mean, even for bitcoin. Like, people don't remember, but bitcoin used to have, like, competitors. I mean, if you were in the know, you knew that they weren't really competitors, but, like, people kind of shield them as competitors. You know, people would say, oh, ripples are competitive.
00:33:57.398 - 00:34:03.446, Speaker A: Bitcoin, bit to bitcoin back in 2013. Litecoin as well. And, like, some, all these other forks at the time. And then people were saying, you know.
00:34:03.510 - 00:34:05.592, Speaker B: Bitcoin cash flow to Ethan.
00:34:05.608 - 00:34:31.509, Speaker A: Yeah, well, yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then you would say, ethereum is a competitor to Bitcoin as well. And, I mean, I still believe ETH is a competitor. BTC to be money and to be a store of value and all that. But there's always going to be, like, competitors, there's always going to be other projects that try to get the limelight by attacking the kind of tallest tree, right? Because what happens is that if you're an underdog project or your new project, the number one thing that you need to get is attention. Right? That's the number one thing you need to.
00:34:31.509 - 00:34:55.189, Speaker A: You need to be part of the conversation in whether that's on crypto, Twitter, or elsewhere, you need to be part of that conversation. And that's why, if you look at the actual crypto assets that are the most valuable by market cap, outside of BTC and ETH, they are the ones with the most attention. Not necessarily the most investable assets, but they're the ones with the most attention. And we can go down the list. BNB binance. Right. Binance is one of the top exchanges still in the world.
00:34:55.189 - 00:35:21.036, Speaker A: Sol for Solana. Solana is very kind of loud. Right? There's a lot of fans of Solana, of people loud about them. XRP, self explanatory. They have a huge army, right? Cardano, Charles Hoskinson has, like, an army of people behind him. Right? So I'm not going to go down the list of all of them, but really, it's, it's an attention game, right? Chain links there. I mean, how many, like, link marines are there? So at the end of the day, like, the projects see this and like, okay, well, the only way I can get attention is by being loud.
00:35:21.036 - 00:36:04.740, Speaker A: And how do you kind of, like, uh, be loud? Well, you start kind of replying to the, the maxis of other chains on Twitter because then you get them riled up and they reply to you, and then suddenly you have all this visibility from someone who has, like, 200,000 followers kind of replying to you and saying, hey, like, you know, what you said was wrong. They know what's wrong. They don't care, because now you've just given them free attention, right? So when you think about it from that perspective, the competitors have to do this in order to compete. That's, like, literally a thing that they don't have a choice here. If they don't do it, they're just not going to get the attention. And because of that, it means that a lot of the things that they say are going to be completely false, and they're going to be things that may not be immediately false. May take a couple of years to actually be proven out by the market, proven out by the fundamentals, but eventually reality catches up.
00:36:04.740 - 00:36:42.480, Speaker A: Like, it's free to spin narratives, right? It costs nothing to send a tweet out or anything like that, but reality has a massive cost to it. You can't ignore reality forever, and reality will eventually catch up. So I think when it comes to competitors for ethereum, the l two roadmap has taken a while to play out, right? And it's still playing out. There's a lot of issues with it. As you said, solved some issues, and there are more issues that remain. We're going to solve them, but they're going to take longer to solve than some other competitor coming along and saying, hey, we can do all of this today, but in reality, maybe they can do it today for a short period of time. And then if they start getting usage or start getting kind of, like, more eyeballs on it, the cracks begin to show and then the promises and the narratives begin to break down.
00:36:42.480 - 00:37:34.800, Speaker A: Reality sets in and everyone's like, oh, okay, I guess I could better walk back that narrative now because it's not you know, people can see it's not true anymore and they start to spin the narrative again, they start to change the narrative again. So we've both seen this many, many times over the years, competitors come and go, but I think what I love most about Ethereum is that Ethereum has gone through this, mind you. I mean, we expected proof of stake to be out in 2017, right? Like Ethereum has definitely gone through this period of kind of change over the years and narratives changing and so on and so forth, especially around ETH as an asset, like going from just a pure gas token to being money, being a store of value. We've seen this all evolve. But now Ethereum, at least over the last couple of years, especially, has this very defined roadmap, both for layer one and for scaling via L2s. And this is a roadmap that the entire Ethereum community, or at least the, almost the entire Ethereum community is aligned around, which is the most important thing, because if you have alignment around it, that means you can execute on it. And that's what we're seeing.
00:37:34.800 - 00:38:11.568, Speaker A: We're seeing it executed on very, very nicely, but there's still a lot of work left to do. But yeah, that's why I've always been such a huge fan of Ethereum. And my conviction on Ethereum has just grown over time is because Ethereum is executing very, very nicely on a roadmap. After pivoting a bunch of times, mind you. I mean, we abandoned execution sharding, right, we completely changed the design of proof of stake Ethereum. We may change it again in the future, who knows? But what I like is that we have the smartest people working on Ethereum, we have the defined roadmaps, we have the willingness and the ability to adapt and not just stay in one spot, which has always been my bull case for Ethereum generally. So that's my take on the competitive side of things.
00:38:11.568 - 00:38:34.520, Speaker A: And at the end of the day there's also like when it comes to investing, people want to play the new thing, right? They like buying the new thing because it's like, ah, you know, it's new and exciting, I'm going to play it, maybe I know that it's all bullshit, but hey, I'm going to hold it for a little bit and then trade it back to ETH. And we see that play out because ETH outperforms most things over the long term. And that brings me to ETH BTC, which we'll talk about after. If you wanted to give like a take on what I just said there about the competitors.
00:38:34.552 - 00:39:03.316, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the most important thing you said is, like, we've always dealt with competitors. Bitcoin's always dealt with competitors. Like, it's always going to be there. You're not going to just not have them, right, because there's too much money to be had. And at the same time, ETH has learned some things from competitors. Cosmos is probably a good example. We've learned some things there, and maybe they're not a direct competitor, but to me, in the long run, and we're both long term minds, and I get it.
00:39:03.316 - 00:39:43.642, Speaker B: I've given up some money on the short term. I could be chasing these things and trying to trade out of them. But whats going to matter most is the investability of the underlying asset. The chains themselves might have all these promises, but whats the actual asset underneath going to be worth in 10, 20, 30 years, even if the chain is somewhat successful? This is what bitcoiners used to always hit on Ethereum about. Okay, Ethan inflating at a time, five, six, 7%. It was going to do that for a while. I do look back and enjoy that bitcoiners challenge the Ethereum community a little bit to think of this, because I think it pushed us to think of how ETH should be money.
00:39:43.642 - 00:40:10.498, Speaker B: And even if these competitors are going to be good for a couple of years or whatever, how investible is that asset underneath it in the long term? And I think thats where people, especially with this line, were talking about being drawn. Bitcoin, ETF's that line, and then the assets below that. And just the money ness of BTC and ETH, to me, thats what will speak volume. Right. And in the longer terms of things, yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:40:10.546 - 00:40:23.890, Speaker A: And I mean, as you said, like it is a long term game. It's like decades long game. It's not short term. And I think most people, by the way. Exactly. Exactly. And most people just do not think on those timeframes.
00:40:23.890 - 00:40:43.660, Speaker A: And I get it. If you're a first cycler, if you're new to crypto, you're not thinking about like a decade hour, you'll think, especially if you're young, it's like you're, you're in your early twenties, you're thinking, I'm going to make money right now. Like I want to be rich. Because it's your first experience in the markets. You've got no idea what's happening in crypto because there's just so much stuff happening and everyone's trying to get your attention, and you don't know how to evaluate these things. So I get it. Like, I get it.
00:40:43.660 - 00:41:06.244, Speaker A: I mean, it's annoying for us having to deal with it because we, I guess, quote unquote, know better because we're more experienced. But we were there once upon a time. I remember when I got into bitcoin in 2013, I was a total noob. I got wrecked on every shitcoin that was out back then. It wasn't. There wasn't that many, but I got wrecked because I thought I knew better. But, oh, yeah, feather coin, quark coin, doge was the big one that I got wrecked on back then.
00:41:06.244 - 00:41:27.392, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So just so many of those kind of things happening back then. But I learned my lesson and I took that with me, and I think that's the main thing. Right. But so I think the next thing I want to talk about, which still on the topic of markets, is ETH BTC. So basically eats performance against BTC, because this is something that I think too many people pay too much attention to, especially over the, over the shorter term.
00:41:27.392 - 00:41:57.624, Speaker A: And, I mean, I'm guilty of it myself. I do kind of pay attention to it because I like to think that, you know, ETH is competing with BTC. And obviously, as ETH BTc goes up, it means ETH is more valuable against bitcoin. But I think what people pay attention to is the actual ETH BTC BTC chart itself, which is extremely noisy. I don't think the ETH BTC chart has any real bearing on anything except the, I guess, like, price action of BTC and ETH. Like, I don't really think anyone's necessarily trading ETH BTC. They're just trading BTC things and eat things.
00:41:57.624 - 00:42:28.716, Speaker A: Now, obviously, over the last, it's probably like eight months now. Eat BTC has pretty much been down only. And I think that the major reason for that is just the ETF stuff. Right. Because think about it. If you were trying to be in crypto and you were going to be in crypto from June of last year, which was, you know, crypto went up a little bit from the bottom, but it was still kind of a bear crab market, and you were thinking, okay, I'm going to get back into the market. What are you going to do? Are you going to go and bid on, like, ethan, the other kind of assets out there, or are you going to bid on the thing that blackrock just filed an ETF for? Right.
00:42:28.716 - 00:43:01.374, Speaker A: Are you going to long the thing that Blackrock just filed an ETF for. And this bid kept increasing as time went on, as the market became more and more confident that these ETF's are going to get approved. So just a very easy trade for people to take. Very easy shelling point for people to take here. And of course, yes, I think in November, Blackrock filed for the ETH ETF, but the trade was still on BTC because people said, ok, well, I can just wait, I can just keep beating BTC, I'll just keep trading that. And then when the narrative heats up around ETH getting an ETF, then I'll trade that, which I think is going to happen relatively soon. And I think it maybe is in the process of happening right now.
00:43:01.374 - 00:43:28.714, Speaker A: But that is first and foremost the reason why ETH BTC has gone down because of that bid there. I don't think it's necessarily got to do a lot with the quote unquote competitors to Ethereum getting a bid. Right. I think that that's just kind of some hot ball of money that's just going back and forth. It's not, there's not that much long term investor capital in there. So I do think it's definitely the ETF stuff. Now, in saying that if you actually compare ETH BTCs performance, this bear market to last bear market, it is significantly better.
00:43:28.714 - 00:43:45.674, Speaker A: I dont think people realize that last bear market ETH went down 90% against BTC from top to bottom, I think. And this bear market, it went down, I think, 50% or something like that. Or at its deepest retrace, maybe a bit less than that. Probably not even. I havent actually looked at it, but definitely not that much.
00:43:45.794 - 00:43:52.154, Speaker B: I dont even think that much because I think it went from .085 like point. What was the low recently?
00:43:52.234 - 00:44:07.962, Speaker A: Like it was around 40 45%, I think. Yeah. So not quite 50%, but yeah, about 40 45%. Right. So which is completely different to down 90%. Like the numbers may seem relatively close, but they're not. Like, percentages don't work that way on kind of like on the way down there.
00:44:07.962 - 00:44:29.302, Speaker A: So, like, if you look at it from that perspective, ETH has already performed significantly better. And this was during a bear and crab market. Right. This was. And this was during like a period of time where BTC had all the attention due to the ETF stuff. Stuff. So from here on out, like, I'm not going to say that this is like the pico bottom of ETH BTC, but from here on out, you can make the strong case that ETH should outperform BTC, right.
00:44:29.302 - 00:45:14.734, Speaker A: Because ETH has all of the stuff that we just talked about on the USD side of things, but that also applies to ETH BTC, because if ETH USD is going up and EThUSD is performing very strongly, then it logically follows that it's going to be performing more strong, strongly than BTC. Because BTC already had its main catalyst kind of trade play out, right? Yes, it's got these passive flows coming in, but this kind of hot ball of money within crypto, this crypto native money hasn't really bid ETH yet, right? They've been in BTC and they've been in all these other things down the risk curve. They're kind of underexposed to eat to an extent. Right. So I think that there is a strong case to be made that from here on out, ETH should outperform BTC. And historically, during bull markets, ETH has outperformed BTC. And then if the ETF's get approved in May, ETH will be on equal footing as BTC in terms of the actual money it has access to.
00:45:14.734 - 00:45:34.974, Speaker A: So, like, if I was personally, I mean, this is not investment advice, but if I was holding BTC right now, I'd be swapping it for ETH. Right? Yes, it's a bit risky because ETH BTC could go down more from here and maybe you could get a better entry. But like, I couldn't think of a better setup right now for ETH to outperform BTC here. At least that's my kind of view on ETH BTC. Maybe you've got a different view or something to complement that.
00:45:35.394 - 00:46:14.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think we're getting to that pivot point. It's hard to this point because you said they had the tailwinds of the ETF news for a long time, like a year, and then the ETF approval, and now BTC has that constant bid of inflows, right, from more retail money, investor 401K money coming in that ETH doesnt have yet. And I truly do think people are grossly on the sideline of ETH. I think a lot of people have been BTC because of the ETF stuff and ETH competitors thinking that theyre going to strongly outperform ETH. Were getting potentially three months away from an ETF approval. And I dont think a lot of people think its going to happen.
00:46:14.114 - 00:46:47.944, Speaker B: I think polymarket has it at like 50 50 polymarkets, a prediction market. But I think that's like smarter money. I think if you like polled true crypto, Twitter, they think it's probably less. I think it's way higher than that. That's not just me being in the 8th bowl. I just think if you read the tea leaves and thinks record on ETF approvals, it seems more obvious to me we might not see that. I mean we had a nice bounce on the ratio today and it's kind of been bottoming around like this like 0.05
00:46:47.944 - 00:47:14.904, Speaker B: level for a while. I think like a few months now I think we'll start to see the, I think people start to realize it's going to happen a month out, something like that. But I think people are starting to think about it, right. And I think we saw that today for the first time. What's funny is the day bitcoin got approved for the ETF, ETH rallied like crazy on the ratio. I think it was up like 15 20% on the ratio or something like that. And a single candle.
00:47:15.064 - 00:47:18.232, Speaker A: But then that's that hot ball of money right, that I was talking about.
00:47:18.288 - 00:47:42.344, Speaker B: Yeah exactly. They started chasing it but then people were like oh no, let's sell the news. And then of course because ETH is a little more risky asset on the downside, it always kind of underperforms a little bit. Right. And it kind of went back to where it was. But yeah that hotball money will start chasing it before the headlines like eventually. And as these like alts slash ETH trades cool off, I think it's going to be a race in, right.
00:47:42.344 - 00:48:09.606, Speaker B: And I think these narratives that weve talked about everything is coming together at once. Lets not forget we also have the bitcoin habiting narrative in there which will just help crypto in general. Now I personally think thats a low IQ narrative but you know what low IQ narratives work, right? Its worked great for bitcoin. There will be less sell pressure. I think just once again its funny. Almost four years to the date, everythings perfectly aligning. EBTF in May, bitcoin happening.
00:48:09.606 - 00:48:39.064, Speaker B: I I think it's in July, end of June, something like that. It's kind of a bit of a moving target but it's somewhere around then and all these things are going to start to align. We've been, let's see, three years ish since the last top. Is that right? And we've been saying bull markets coming. I think we've been pretty spot on with it's going to take some time. This is the most bullish I've personally been in three, four years. And what's great is I don't see much froth in the market.
00:48:39.064 - 00:49:07.514, Speaker B: If you look at like, but open interest on ETH, it's very, very low. Like as far as like leverage trading, I've had not a single random friend or family member text me about crypto. I think all of retail is underexposed to ETH. I mean, if, unless the world blows up, we go into world war three, there's always a black swan event that could happen, right? If everything kind of stays on this path, I don't see a reason he doesn't go to 20k. That's just how I feel right now.
00:49:08.454 - 00:49:34.592, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that like, even for the macro people out there, the people who follow the macro tradfi kind of side of things, you know, over the last 1218 months, they were like Max Duma. They were like, the world's gonna end, rates are going to this, you know, there's too much debt, blah, blah. And a lot of these people don't actually understand how things work at all. It was always hilarious reading these takes and being like, guys like, you have absolutely no idea how it works. Like they're like, oh, the US has so much debt, needs to pay it back. And like guys like the US has aircraft carriers, they dont care about their debt.
00:49:34.592 - 00:49:59.680, Speaker A: Whos going to come collect the debt? I just think a lot of people just dont realize how things actually work. They see these numbers and theyre just like, oh my God, everythings going to go down and its going to collapse. And inflation is really high. And then, of course, we saw inflation come down. The rates went up. Yes, fine. But ETH actually bottomed in June of 2022, and that was the peak of inflation in the US back then.
00:49:59.680 - 00:50:17.950, Speaker A: And then since then its been down only. And now we're on the verge of the rates being cut. Now, of course, markets are always forward looking. They're not just going to wait for this to happen. They've been pricing this in for months now. And then you've got like the ETF stuff, which falls into the positive macro stuff as well. So even if you wanted to just follow along with the macro stuff, like, there is a very bullish case to be made there.
00:50:17.950 - 00:50:50.554, Speaker A: But I've always generally made the point that crypto, at least until recently, has been relatively too small to really care too much about the macro, or at least follow it too closely. It usually lags, to be honest, because stocks will go to all time highs first. I mean, the SPX just hit the all time high, right recently. It'll go to all time high first, and then crypto will follow because it's just a riskier asset class, which is traditionally what's happened with the ETF's that might change things going forward as well, and it might kind of suppress these four year cycles that we've been seeing. I mean, it already has to an extent. Um, but, yeah, I mean, I don't know what the bear case is right now. As you said, like, there's the black swan.
00:50:50.554 - 00:51:15.866, Speaker A: That could happen. I mean, I don't even know if, like, a, like, a large scale war would stop this train. Right? Like, I mean, it depends on. On what the wall looks like, too. Um, and, you know, I guess if we get another pandemic, I don't think we're going to have the same thing because it's not a black swan. Everyone be like, oh, it's another pandemic, right? They're just going to be like, oh, well, you know, COVID didn't, like, I was actually good for the market, so let's just beat everything up. Right? So who knows? The whole point of a black swan is that you can't predict it, obviously.
00:51:15.866 - 00:51:40.268, Speaker A: Um, so we'll have to see kind of, if anything like that happens. But, yeah, I'm struggling really hard to find any reason to be bearish right now, uh, to be honest. Like, there are just so many reasons to be. To be bullish on things, uh, especially ETH. And as you said, like, there's not much froth yet in the crypto markets. Like, yeah, okay, BTC has done a really big move, and some of the other things have done big moves, but people don't remember what it was like in 2021 or late 2020, how. Just how frothy it got back then.
00:51:40.268 - 00:52:00.834, Speaker A: Like, when you start seeing that level of froth again, start seeing people like Elon Musk go on SNL and Shield dogecoin, like, that's. That's peak froth, right? And shit. Like those random nfts just going up, like, massively that we saw in 2021. Like, that sort of stuff. Stuff is, is froth. What we've been seeing is not froth. It's just like the same money rotating around like the same hot ball of money rotating around.
00:52:00.834 - 00:52:25.342, Speaker A: Um, and it's really just crypto natives just pvping each other, as they say. Uh, so even that case, yeah, there's just not much of a bearish case, uh, to be made there, uh, in. In my opinion. And I think that, uh, one. One thing that a lot of people forget as well, is that BTC actually didn't break 30k until October. Right. The ETF was filed in June by Blackrock, but then BTC, I think went to, then went back down 25k because everyone was kind of fading.
00:52:25.342 - 00:52:54.500, Speaker A: It saying, oh, this is just going to get like rejected again because every other ETF got rejected. And then slowly but surely, you know, the confidence started building. And then when Grayscale won their case against the SEC, everyone was like, okay, well, now the SEC hand is forced. They're going to approve this ETF. And that's when you saw that massive run from thirty k to like 45k leading up to the ETF, which is a huge run for BTC because as you said, the market cap is so, so large. That's a, that's an absolutely massive run. So I think the same thing is happening with the ETH right now where the confidence is very low.
00:52:54.500 - 00:53:32.534, Speaker A: As you said, prediction market, 50 50 crypto native is probably even less than that. But as we see more of these kind of issuers go back and forth with the SEC. Like, as you mentioned, Franklin Templeton today just submitted their application, but there's been other back and forth with other issuers. As we see more and more of that happening over the coming weeks, we're going to see the confidence build, and that confidence is going to build into the price, and then the price is going to beget the price and then the price is going to go up because, you know, stop Fomo and so on and so forth. Right. And then the market will become peak confident if it does get approved in May. And as I said earlier, we may see a similar kind of thing where it's like, I'll sell the news, quote unquote, rest for a little bit and then continue up from there.
00:53:32.534 - 00:54:00.778, Speaker A: But like, yeah, that's in May and that's after the harvening. As you said, the harvesting is another big narrative in April. Right. So we just have like this bullish narrative on bullish narrative and bullish narrative that, in my opinion, has not been priced in for ETH at all yet. Really? I mean, a little bit, maybe recently, but, but not really. And I think once you see BTC really outperforming, that's when you can probably have confidence that it's beginning to be priced in. I think ETH USD is not enough because ETH USDA is typically been following BTC USD up until you start seeing ETH BTc outperform.
00:54:00.778 - 00:54:13.934, Speaker A: That's when you'll know that people are actually now bidding on ETH, ETF being approved, that's the kind of signal to me, at least. And then after that, as we said, there's so many other catalysts, but then we go into probably a full blown bull market and it just gets crazy from there.
00:54:14.654 - 00:54:57.430, Speaker B: Pure chaos at that point. I think the last point I want to make is people being bearish as ETF approval. Like, I see a lot of people think it's the government's decision, which is, it's nice to think that, but in all reality, these financial institutions own these government officials, right. Either through donations or whatever it is, right. They're the ones with the real influence. There's a reason Larry thinks, like, whatever I said, 478 and one in ETF approvals, right? Like, Blackrock makes a lot of money off ETF's and there's a lot of, it's not corruption, but there's a lot of backhanded agreements, right. In Washington.
00:54:57.430 - 00:55:39.924, Speaker B: And the more, like you said, the more financial institutions that have power that apply for this ETF, the more likely it is. Because if they all want it, if they all want a slice of the pie and they're all seeing dollar signs because of the fees they're going to make off this thing, it's going to happen, right? Like Gensler can claim and cry all he wants that it's not going to happen. At the end of the day, if you've got every large asset manager knocking on your door in Washington telling you that you better approve this or whatever, it's going to happen. Right. And I think that's the real sign. The more applications we see, the more push we see from these larger asset managers and financial institutions. I think that's all that you really need to know.
00:55:40.694 - 00:55:47.446, Speaker A: And it's an election year, right. And the dems need every good bit of goodwill they can get at this point.
00:55:47.630 - 00:56:11.174, Speaker B: Well, by the way, that's another, like, I mean, that's not until November. And I don't want to, like, take any sides here, but like, that, that could, like, change markets up, too. Right. And I think we're seeing, you know, like we didn't talk about, but you just mentioned s and p 500 all time high election year. Like, there's a lot of catalysts that are coming for markets or that are already here. Right. It's going to, it's going to be a wild next twelve months.
00:56:11.174 - 00:56:33.038, Speaker B: Um, but, yeah, I don't, I just don't see the bare narrative. Like, who's sitting here is thinking they're going to dump ETH and rebuy at a thousand right now. Right. I just don't see it. Um, so I'm personally excited for the next twelve months. I think we've deserved it, um, for sure, as the ETH community. And it's funny that people just like ETH just executes and things happen and people move on and forget.
00:56:33.038 - 00:56:49.094, Speaker B: Like, it's even funny that proof of stake and emerge happen and like people just are like, oh man, that's been perfect. Let's take it for granted. So, I mean, I think if any asset at this point deserves a nice little rally. I know I'm biased, but I think east that one.
00:56:49.874 - 00:57:26.246, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think Ethan Ethereum is just always suffering from success, right? It's just so successful and it does everything so well that it kind of becomes boring for people because people expect Ethereum to do the right thing, so to speak, or to like be boring and not have drama and not have downtime and things like that. If you want to kind of take that view on things, right. And that is not maybe something that could be traded upon. And I think that traders get very frustrated with ETH because of that. Because ETH probably trades more like a long term investment than just like a hot bowl trade that they could take. Because at the end of the day, crypto native traders, they don't want to just sit in assets for long periods of time.
00:57:26.246 - 00:58:04.714, Speaker A: They want to trade based on the weekly, maybe a month, monthly kind of timeframe, not like years, especially not decades or anything like that. So for them, it's a kind of a thing of, okay, well, what does the ETH chart look like? Okay, well, I can't trade this because the ETH chart doesn't look like anything good, because it doesn't, I mean, I've watched some trader videos and they all get very frustrated with ETH because they're like, you know, this doesn't look like anything. I can't trade this. It's, it's noise. It's like, yeah, because I think ETH is treated more as a long term investment than it is as a trade, whereas all these other assets, they just don't, they don't long term investments for most people, they've got very clearly defined, like, like meme lines or trend lines you can draw on a chart. They've got very defined narratives. You can point to things like that.
00:58:04.714 - 00:58:34.098, Speaker A: Most of the people trading the asset are just short term traders. Then of course they're going to be able to dictate where the direction goes rather than the investors here. And that's why you see one of the reasons why I see so much volatility on these other assets compared to Ethan BTC as well. But it's funny when you look at it from that Ethereum and ETH suffered from success a bit. But if you just take the longer term view, ETH has been such a strong asset for such a long period of time now. Uh, and. And, you know, it hasn't even been that long, really.
00:58:34.098 - 00:58:55.770, Speaker A: I mean, like, we were at $80 back in what, 2020? Like, if you really want to take it from, like, the COVID dump, a hundred. I mean, we're at a $100 for a couple of weeks after the COVID dump. Um, and that was not that long ago. You know, it's four years ago or something. Now it's, uh, you know, it's not decades or anything like that. And if you go back a decade to 2014, that was the ethic ICo. So, like, either has performed, like, magically for a very long time.
00:58:55.770 - 00:59:17.474, Speaker A: Um, so I think people just need to take a longer term mindset when it comes to ETH. Like, ETH is not a trade. Like, it is not something that you can, you know, you're not going to make a hundred x off ETH. You're not going to dj and gamble on ETH. You're not going to be able to trade ETH very successfully unless you're using leverage. But then again, you're going to blow yourself up using leverage probably most of the time. Right? So that's what I try to get through to people is that, like, ETH is more of, like, your long term thing.
00:59:17.474 - 00:59:42.060, Speaker A: Have a dj and stack, you know, play with that. Go do whatever you need to get it out of your system, because I know a lot of people get. They get fomo, right? They need to do it. They're like, I need to gamble. It's like, okay, that's fine, go do that. But, like, don't use your entire stash to do that because it just means you're going to end up with nothing. So it's like a typical thing of, okay, 90% in, like ethan, other long term investments, 10% djen stack, whatever way you want to kind of weigh it there.
00:59:42.060 - 01:00:00.594, Speaker A: People can do that. But, yeah, I definitely think that people need to just really understand that ETH is not a degen play. It is a very long term investment that will go up over time, slowly, but it's not going to give you 100 x over a couple of months like meme coins will. But it also has none of the risk of meme coins. Right, right, exactly.
01:00:00.634 - 01:00:18.024, Speaker B: No, I think that's a good point. I mean, not to throw out the typical not financial advice, but if you're not in it for a long term play, ETH is the long term play. I mean, BTC is to a point, but BTC is like the safer, boring long term play. I would say east. Like the, oh, crypto could be massive.
01:00:18.104 - 01:00:23.136, Speaker A: Like more and more involved, too. Right. Because you can do more things with your ETH and get exposure to other things as well.
01:00:23.240 - 01:00:46.560, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, 100%. But it's not like we're not saying, like, go buy ETH tomorrow and it's going to be 20k tomorrow or in two days. Right. Like it's going to still take a little bit of time, but, like, anybody that I want, anybody that invests me to, like, truly kind of believe in the community and the vision and the execution. Right. Because I think that has been important for Ethan and I think it's a great perspective.
01:00:46.560 - 01:01:03.200, Speaker B: You just put out there. Like, only four years ago we were at $100. Only nine years ago we were at a dollar. We're at 2600 now. That's not a lot. Tell someone they could make 2600 x in ten years, people would just freak out. It's easily forgotten.
01:01:03.200 - 01:01:19.644, Speaker B: Like we said, even from bottom, we're up four x or whatever it is. It's crazy how fast we forget, like, how successful crypto returns can be. But, yeah, definitely. I mean, if you want to be an ETH, just, just hold on. Trust me, everything's going to be fine.
01:01:20.064 - 01:01:39.322, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's it. And I think, like a lot of people, at least a lot of the more plugged in people, from what I've seen, what they tend to do is they use their dj and stack, but then they just roll the profits into ETH. Right. They don't want to go to cash for very long, like, unless it's like a, they expect the whole market to crash or like, for us to go to another crypto bear market. They dont really want to go to cash. Theyll pay their taxes, whatever.
01:01:39.322 - 01:02:09.002, Speaker A: But outside of that, they want to go into crypto again. So what are they going to go into? Theyre not going to go into something even more degen. Theyre going to take a lot of that into ETH and into BTC as well and add that to their long term stash and then maybe they go degen some more. But as you increase your capital pool, you become more and more conservative because youre like okay, ive made all this money, now I dont want to lose it. Maybe ill reduce the percentage that im putting into this D gen stuff because now the percentage is a lot higher in dollar terms, so. And I've got a lot of friends who do this and a lot of people who have done this. I've personally done this.
01:02:09.002 - 01:02:35.332, Speaker A: Like, I was a lot more dj and last cycle than I am now. I mean, I'm not even, I'm not even degenerate at all now. I think the most djing thing I do is angel investments, right. Um, which, I mean, depending on how you look at it can be pretty de gen, but that's, that's kind of my degen stash, so to speak. I'm not doing airdrop farming, I'm not speculating on meme coins, I'm not doing any of that. But I was in 2020, like during DeFi some, I mean, we both were like the food farms and everything, right. Um, but that's when we, our bankrolls were like, you know, a lot less and we, we kind of like increased it over time.
01:02:35.332 - 01:03:07.260, Speaker A: We became more conservative and now we're just like, you know, I'm happy with what we've got and we're happy to just keep it in ETH because we want to obviously not be in cash because cash is trash, as they say. Right? To an extent. Um, and then just buy, buy ETH dips and things like that when we've got some spare capital on the side as well. Um, more of those macro ETH dips, like those big ones where like 880 or stuff like that. Like below one k kind of at the end of the, the bear market sort of thing. But everyone has their own kind of ways of going about it. But yeah, as you said, ETH is definitely a long term thing, it's not a short term thing.
01:03:07.260 - 01:03:14.004, Speaker A: And I think people just have bad expectations when it comes to ETH still, which just puzzles me because ETH is such a large market cap.
01:03:14.084 - 01:03:47.764, Speaker B: But yeah, I think one important thing is always, when things get frothy, take a little off the table just to set aside to buy that 60% dip at some point, right. Even if you buy it a little early, at 50%, its always nice to set some aside to rebuy. Because when things get frothy, yeah, you might sell a little early, but its always going to go lower at some point than that. Right. If you could sell the absolute top and buy the absolute bottom, yeah, that would be wonderful. Right. But when things get really, really frothy its always good to take a little off the table and just set aside to rebuy that bottom.
01:03:47.764 - 01:04:00.704, Speaker B: And you always want to buy the bottom sooner than it actually is. I feel like if you wait that two year period, thats the sweet spot. But yeah, the more cycles you go through, the more you realize actually how simple this market actually is.
01:04:01.164 - 01:04:28.268, Speaker A: Exactly. And it just comes with experience. You know, like, we can tell people whatever, but like they most of the time they're probably not going to listen to us because they have to experience it for themselves, especially if they're younger, have a bit of an ego about them, haven't had an experience with markets before. They're definitely not going to listen most of the time. And that's just the natural order of things, I think, and the way things have to go. And I actually do recommend people get wrecked, you know, once or twice with their whole stash or anything like that. But, like, lose some money because that is the best lesson because then you become humbled.
01:04:28.268 - 01:04:50.670, Speaker A: You're like, okay, well, maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was because, you know, crypto bull markets tend to, like, inflate your ego and inflate your confidence because everything's going up and you think you're like the best investor ever. I mean, I still felt this in 2017 where I bought some stuff and I was just like, oh, my God, it went up. I'm a genius. But then I quickly kind of caught myself and it's like, no, I don't think so. Like, everything's going up together. Like, I've been, I've been through this before. It's not, it's not that I'm a genius.
01:04:50.670 - 01:05:15.776, Speaker A: I'm just, like, in the right place at the right time right now. Um, and, yeah, I think not falling into that trap is critically important, uh, for kind of investing. But, you know, it comes with time, comes with experience. And I think that, uh, I don't know. I mean, I think that the Daily Gwei listeners, you know, and viewers, a lot of them are probably like second cyclers, but there's a few first cyclers in there as well. So it just depends. I think some, maybe some third cyclers, but I think by your second cycle, you start to get the hang of things.
01:05:15.776 - 01:05:20.944, Speaker A: But first cycle is. Yeah, it's messy. You learn the hardest lessons in the first cycle.
01:05:21.244 - 01:05:37.284, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a shit show. I had a lot of bitcoin in early 2013 that I felt a genius about and lost it all, leverage trading. And I'm like, okay. I'm actually going to be a value investor now. That's when I found ease, so I'm never going back to those days. But, yeah, you got to learn those lessons. There's no doubt about that.
01:05:37.444 - 01:05:55.568, Speaker A: Yep. Yep. Exactly. All right, well, we've gone for over an hour, I think, so I think that's might be the perfect time to kind of finish it up there for today. I think if, if people aren't sufficiently bullish after that episode on ETH, then I don't know what's going to help you. And I hope that we can, like, revisit this episode in, like, a year's time. Not saying that we're going to go a year without doing another episode.
01:05:55.568 - 01:06:27.888, Speaker A: Hopefully we don't do that. Um, but, like, in a year's time and see, like, how right or wrong we were on things and, like, where we actually top out at, because I'm going to laugh if we top out, like, below 15k or something and that we're just like, we're both, like, very wrong. Um, but at the same time, like, just the general trend, regardless of price targets, I think the general trend from here is very, very bullish for, for ETH, just generally internally and the crypto space as a whole. And I think we obviously both agree on that and I think that a lot of listeners will agree on that. But, yeah, just don't blow yourself up, guys. That's the number one piece of advice I always give people. I don't give investment advice.
01:06:27.888 - 01:06:41.564, Speaker A: I give advice on don't blow yourself up. That's just general life advice, I think. Because if you do that and you get sidelined and you don't have capital put back in and the market gets ahead of you, it's the absolute worst feeling. And you're just going to exit crypto and hate crypto because of it.
01:06:42.764 - 01:06:44.464, Speaker B: Yep. Survive in advance.
01:06:44.924 - 01:06:59.988, Speaker A: Exactly. That's it. All right. Well, yeah, thanks, everyone, for listening and watching.

01:06:59.988 - 01:07:11.124, Speaker A: We'll see. We tried to do that at two week cadence originally, but we didn't stick to that. But we'll see when we're back. It's just going to be a random kind of thing on the drive through here. But, yeah, glad you enjoyed the episode and, yeah, thanks, Eric, for joining me today.
