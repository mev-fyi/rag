00:00:00.480 - 00:00:30.678, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gui refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Susano, and today's the 23 April 2021. Alright everyone, what a crazy 24 hours it has been. We had a new all time high for ETH, peaking at about 26, 44 here. I think maybe just above that 47 or something like that. And then inevitably we came crashing back down to about 2060, and now we're at like 22, 64. So it's been a while, 24 hours, that's for sure.
00:00:30.678 - 00:01:26.378, Speaker A: It's been a euphoric 24 hours. And, you know, I woke up this morning and I checked the price. I was like, wait, what? Why are we back at like 2200 or something like that? And, you know, I checked Twitter, I checked the news, and it was basically, I mean, you know, some people are debating against this, but like, from what I could see, it was because of some new kind of proposed tax plan in the US under the Biden administration, where basically the top bracket of capital gains tax would be doubled. So anyone earning over a million dollars, essentially, you know, after that million dollars, anything earned after that, you'd be taxed at, I think it was like 40% federal, or almost 40% federal. And then in some states, like the high tax states like California, your effective kind of capital gains tax could go up to 57% for that bracket there. So obviously, you know, people were kind of blaming that and saying that, you know, higher taxes are bad for capital markets, so that's why they've been selling off and things like that. You know, I can see that for sure.
00:01:26.378 - 00:02:02.356, Speaker A: I have, you know, I've debated with people about this and I can see the other side of it as well that, you know, that the charts were saying that, you know, the market was too overheated and we were due to kind of correct here. But I do think that maybe both of the things can be true. Right? I think that maybe the market needed to correct after going up so quickly, but maybe the correction was deeper than it would have been because of the news, so to speak. Now, this dump, I actually think would have been much worse if there was more leverage in the system. So if you see the other day, there was a lot of liquidations that went on. There was about $10 billion in 4 hours of liquidations that happened. This time around, I think it was about $3 billion.
00:02:02.356 - 00:02:38.550, Speaker A: So it's actually really healthy that we cleared out all that leverage from the other day's dump, like this dump over here essentially, from what was it? Like 20, the old, I guess, like the old all time high, you know, down to around like, what, 19 or $2,000 or something like that. So it's very healthy. This is the 1 hour chart, by the way. So this only goes back about a week, or actually a week here to the last all time high. But anyway, and I did have some kind of questions and people were confused about, like, all these terms that people use on Twitter, like liquidations and leverage and all this sort of stuff. So just, I wanted to give, like, a quick kind of rundown there. Essentially what happens as the market moves in either direction.
00:02:38.550 - 00:03:25.476, Speaker A: But, you know, we'll just use going up for an, as an example here. So when the market's moving up, you know, people, especially traders, right, day traders and things like that. Not even necessarily day traders, but just traders in general, or, or people that want to basically make a bet that the price is going to keep going up, but they don't have any spare cash. So what they do is they leverage their existing assets. That's why it's called leverage, to borrow against it, to essentially buy more of the asset they're bullish on. So, for example, if I have $1,000 worth of ETH, right, and I want to borrow against that to buy more ETH, say I borrow a few hundred dollars, I go buy ETH with it, and then I've used my existing ETH as collateral, right, to basically get leverage against. Now, if the price keeps going up, say, the price, you know, doubles, right? Just as an easy example.
00:03:25.476 - 00:04:09.384, Speaker A: And I sell the kind of ETH that I bought with the borrowed funds, I pay down the debt to unlock my original ETH, and then I pocket the difference as profit. Simple kind of strategy, right? Simple on the surface, complex underneath. So essentially what ends up happening is that when you borrow funds against your collateral, you have a liquidation price. So you, if you don't pay the, if you don't pay the debt down in time, what will end up happening is that your position will be liquidated. Your assets that have been put up as collateral will be sold off to cover that debt that you have, and then you'll get back whatever. Whatever remains, essentially. Now, the reason why you see a lot of these liquidations happen in these kind of, like, downward moves happening here, right, is because as the market's heating up, obviously people are opening up more leverage.
00:04:09.384 - 00:04:39.698, Speaker A: And, you know, a lot of people like to play it risky. Like, it's as simple as that. A lot of people like to just gamble with it. You know, play play with fire, essentially have liquidation prices that are very close to the current market price. So what ends up happening is if, say you open a position at $2,500, right? And you say, okay, well, I'm super bullish on ETH right now. I'm going to lever up as much as I can, and my liquidation price is going to be like $2,400 or something. So you lever up and then you're all euphoric because the price has gone up to like 26, 50 or whatever, and then you haven't closed your position or anything like that.
00:04:39.698 - 00:05:12.192, Speaker A: You haven't sold off because you're like, you know, this is going higher. But then what ends up happening is that this quick dump happens. Like, this is, this is basically 4 hours. In 4 hours, it goes to $2,400. Now, if you're not monitoring your position, right, you're going to get liquidated by that. If you haven't, if you haven't paid it down, you're going to get liquidated. And what ends up happening is that because the asset you bought was at 2500 and it goes under, that you can't sell as much of the asset that you bought, so you can't actually get back what you, what you paid for it, and then you have to basically find money to pay it back elsewhere or you get liquidated.
00:05:12.192 - 00:05:59.278, Speaker A: Right. So that's like the gist of it, the high level of what's happened, what happens there. And, you know, this market cycle is very different to 2017 because of leverage, I think, you know, in 2017, we didn't have easy ways for kind of like, retail investors to get access to leverage. Binance only launched mid 2017. A lot of the other exchanges, like BitMex and things like that were really, you know, they were popular, but they were nowhere near as liquid or as popular as they are today, especially with retail traders. So when you kind of like, look at, look at what's happening in the markets now and the rise of, like, Binance, which gave retail investors and defi, mind you, retail investors, like, really easy access to leverage. Like, you can set up a binance account and have access to leverage, like, you know, within the net within a day sort of thing, right? Or you can kind of like, go on Defi and have access to leverage immediately.
00:05:59.278 - 00:06:13.932, Speaker A: Just get some ETH from an exchange, go put it in maker, borrow, die. That's your leverage. Right. So from that point of view, the market is just like constantly, you know, much more leveraged than it, than it used to. Be in either direction. Right. You can do what I just said about going, it's called going long.
00:06:13.932 - 00:06:35.940, Speaker A: You can do that going short. So where you would borrow the asset, sell it and then buy it back cheaper and then pocket the difference. Right. Just works in reverse there. But essentially this is basically the reason why we see such violent moves some of the time. And I actually think it's healthy. I think the market is healthier for it in the longer term because what ends up happening is that you can quickly kind of reset the market, essentially.
00:06:35.940 - 00:06:59.156, Speaker A: So what ends up happening is you basically clear the leverage out and then like after that there's just like, you know, people want to obviously buy again. Want to, want to buy the dip, so to speak. Investors buy the dip, right. And then traders will also buy it and then, you know, you naturally start moving back up again. It doesn't happen immediately or anything like that. And you can see on the chart now, I mean we've tried to move back up a little bit, but come back down and, you know, this might get choppy around here. It might just go back up.
00:06:59.156 - 00:07:46.558, Speaker A: You don't really know at this stage. But essentially, you know, that's, that's kind of like the gist of what happens there. So this is why unless you're a trader, there is literally no sense in paying attention to short term moves at all. I mean, that's why I stopped kind of like giving market updates on every refuel episode a long time ago is that like I try to position the refuel as like a place for like long term alliance, Alliant, Ethereum people to come and kind of like get updates on the ecosystem and all that good stuff there. But if you, if you are a trader or if you're trying to be one, I would suggest learning about all this stuff before you're doing it. I suspect that there's a lot of people who will play with leverage and not understand it and then they'll probably get liquidated or something and they'll be like, wow, how did I get liquidated? And they'll go back and they'll check and like, wow, you know, I was playing with fire essentially. Maybe it's good to learn by, by, by, you know, being burnt.
00:07:46.558 - 00:08:07.634, Speaker A: But I guess in general, just like a bit of advice there, just kind of learn what you're doing. And that goes for anything, not just trading but investing as well. But anyway, I'll as leave it at that. We'll see what the kind of price does over, over the coming kind of like days. I guess and see if we, we're back at an all time high. We'll just stick around sideways for a bit. I mean, you guys know me, long term, bullish always, but short term, got no idea what's going to happen.
00:08:07.634 - 00:08:45.760, Speaker A: At the end of the day, absolutely no idea what's going to happen in the short term. Anyone who say, says that they do have any idea or any kind of certainty is lying to you, essentially. So, yeah, play, play long term games and you, and you should be okay. Just on that note as well, about that kind of like proposed kind of tax hike, DC investor put together a great thread here and for a bit of background here, DC investor worked in kind of like the government arena for 15 years. So you know how this all kind of works here. But essentially he says there's a near zero chance the tax bill passes as proposed. It's common for us presidents to articulate, articulate crazy stuff in these proposals as a negotiation tactic.
00:08:45.760 - 00:09:21.238, Speaker A: This is especially true for tax bills. When the bill goes to bipartisan committee, it gets nerfed hard. Either he goes on in a couple more tweets, but I won't read those. It just basically reinforces his point here. So essentially, you know, this is what people call fud, right? This is kind of stuff that is just so weird for the market to dump on, but people love to do this. Or at least like traders and whales love to kind of do this because it's, it's, it lets them buy in cheaper, right? Lets them kind of, I guess, like dump the market, get, you know, wreck all the noobs, right? Wreck all the over leveraged apes, as they're called, and kind of buy back in cheaper. So that's why you kind of see that stuff happening there.
00:09:21.238 - 00:09:49.902, Speaker A: But I agree with DC here. I mean, I'm not an expert on us politics. I wouldn't even say, like, I have really any window into us politics. But normally, I guess politics in general is a game of negotiation, right? Like you start, I mean, in general, when you start a negotiation, you want to start like, you know, with your crazy demands and then work your way down. You don't want to start like with the, with the tempered demands and then work your way up. It's just, that's, that's not a great negotiation tactic. So if you're trying to pass a, you know, tax hike, you go as high as you can, right.
00:09:49.902 - 00:10:15.104, Speaker A: And then from there, you, you know, you kind of go down from there, essentially, and, you know, you kind of land on something that you all agree on. Ideally, I don't know what's going to happen with, with the bill. I don't know what it's going to end up looking like. And I would like to remind people that the crypto market is global. It's not just the US. The US is obviously a big part of it. And I would also like to remind people that this tax hike would be for just people making over a million dollars here, right in the million dollar plus tax bracket.
00:10:15.104 - 00:10:45.962, Speaker A: So, you know, from that perspective, when you, when you kind of look at it like that, I think only 0.35% of americans kind of earn that much or have reported that much in income in the last kind of financial year. So it wouldn't affect too many people. But again, it's all about the capital, because what ends up happening is that taxes go up, people need to sell more to cover the additional taxes. Right. So, and, you know, in general, it's just not great for, for kind of like capital markets. But in saying that, Rick Burton had a great tweet today where he said, rich people never sell their capital.
00:10:45.962 - 00:11:17.406, Speaker A: They borrow against it to avoid capital gains tax. This is something very few people seem to understand. And he's right. Like, you know, I mean, if you really think about it, you, like, this is the way the world works. Like, people who have assets, especially people who have assets that they're bullish on still and don't want to get rid of, like my ETH, for example, or your ETH, for example, you just borrow against it if you need the cash, right? And you'll keep like a safe liquidation price. I mean, you know, non, you could, you don't even have to keep a safe liquidation price. If you're rich enough, you can just basically, I mean, you don't have to be that rich.
00:11:17.406 - 00:11:41.670, Speaker A: You just go to a bank or something and say, hey, I want to borrow money against, like, this is collateral, right? And they'll just give it to you and you'll get it like a really cheap rate, essentially, and you'll get like a really good deal depending on how much money you have. But this is not possible for most people. Right. But, but again, most people aren't. Are making over a million dollars, kind of like in that tax bracket, essentially. Right. Maybe asking crypto, maybe we're closer to it than most.
00:11:41.670 - 00:11:58.114, Speaker A: But I think in general, that's a lot of money for most people. And, you know, as Rick notes here. Right. You know, it can be easy for people to do this, you know, do this essentially, like borrow to avoid capital gains tax by leveraging something like makerdao. And that's. That's true. Right.
00:11:58.114 - 00:12:23.184, Speaker A: But. But, like, essentially, if you're trying to avoid, I guess, like, that higher bracket, that doesn't apply to most people. But anyway, I. I'll leave it at that for now. I just wanted to kind of COVID that because that was all over my timeline today. But, yeah, it was definitely very weird fud. And then on top of that, I saw some random twitter account tweet out that, you know, Janet Yellen was gonna, um, was gonna put in an 80% crypto tax, like, crypto specific tax.
00:12:23.184 - 00:12:41.412, Speaker A: I was like, what the hell? And it was a jerk. It actually cited, like, heard on the street. Right? As in, like, just, like, it was just a complete meme and a joke, but people fell for it, apparently. I was like, what? Like, this is just super weird. Like, what do you. What do you. Like, how can you fall for this? Like, but anyway, you know, if you just see it and you have no context, maybe.
00:12:41.412 - 00:12:59.374, Speaker A: But I don't know, maybe the market sold off because of that. I don't buy it. I buy that the market did sell off deeper than it maybe would have due to. Due to the Biden kind of like, tax thing there, but, yeah. And anyway, enough on the. On the price stuff for today. I just felt it was very important to go over it because I had a lot of people asking me about it.
00:12:59.374 - 00:13:21.888, Speaker A: So Alchemyx put out a growth update here. And, boy, are they growing. They have 350 million Dai deposited into their Alchemix platform, which is 10% of the total Dai supply. They are on track to repay over 40 million in LUSD debt over the course of a year. And Alcx ETH is one of the most liquid pairs on Sushiswap. I was looking at it the other day. It's actually incredibly liquid.
00:13:21.888 - 00:13:43.080, Speaker A: You know, to move the price 2%, you would have to make a $2.2 million purchase or sale, which is. Which is quite deep. And LUSD is also one of the most liquid stable coins. Now, Alchemyx is one of my favorite projects in the space. I do hold ALCX tokens, so just some disclosures there. But I think this is like a really great kind of, like, growth trajectory.
00:13:43.080 - 00:14:20.150, Speaker A: They've only been out for a few months, not even essentially. And they're offering a product that a lot of people are getting a lot out of because essentially you can basically. I mean, not only does your debt pay itself back using the yield by depositing your dai in here, but you can also borrow against it without al USD and do whatever you want with that. And because it's one of the most liquid stable coins now, it's even better because it means that you have like this entry and exit liquidity whenever you kind of need it, which is incredibly important for stable coins. So, yeah, really, really great to see Alchemyx's growth here. And they've also got v two coming as well soon, which is going to enable a bunch of different stuff. They're going to add more than just stable coins.
00:14:20.150 - 00:14:47.178, Speaker A: They're going to add other assets that you can kind of do this with. You know, they spoke specifically about ETH as well. Basically being able to stack more ETH by borrowing against your ETH. Like, it's just there's some crazy stuff coming to this project, so if you're not paying attention to it, you definitely should be. But I've spoken about them a bunch of times, so I'm sure a lot of you are already paying attention to Alchemyx here. So 4 million ETH is now in the ETH two deposit contracts, which meant. Which means it is now staking on ETH.
00:14:47.178 - 00:15:00.234, Speaker A: And at current prices, this is what, $8 billion or something like that? Probably more than that. You know, it was $10 billion the other day, I think, when ETH was like 2500. So I think it's closer to nine. But, yeah, 4,000,008th. That's. That's crazy. It's a crazy amount of ETH.
00:15:00.234 - 00:15:17.964, Speaker A: It's. I would say it's maybe three, 3.5% of all ETH or something like that in the e three deposit contract. And obviously we still have ETH locked in defi going up. That's at about 11 million. But it's really cool to say that 4 million is in there. Given that, I think ETH two staking being like one way bridge dissuades people.
00:15:17.964 - 00:15:35.632, Speaker A: There aren't like, Coinbase is still very early stages of their staking kind of service. There's definitely not a lot of people kind of staking right now with. With Coinbase at least. And it's still. I mean, I wouldn't say it's complex, but it's. It's, you know, it's still kind of something that is not like totally noob friendly. Right.
00:15:35.632 - 00:15:54.960, Speaker A: Where it's just like a one click thing. Setting up and staking on your own does take a little bit of time. Right. And there's a lot of kind of, like, there's a bit of a learning curve there for sure. So. Yeah, but yeah, cool to still see this 4 million ETH locked in the deposit contract. You know, I remember back to November where people were saying, you know, we're not even going to reach the minimum ETH, which was 524,000 and we reached the minimum.
00:15:54.960 - 00:16:24.314, Speaker A: We smashed past it. Right. And now we're at 4 million, which is incredibly healthy to see. So really great to see that. I hope to see more kind of trend more going into the deposit contract over time. So seller Network has launched their L2 finance initiative on the Ethereum main net, which they say is taking on two of the biggest challenges in DeFi, high cost and complexity of use. So you can now use Aaver Compound and curve through app l two finance completely for free here.
00:16:24.314 - 00:17:01.504, Speaker A: So if you want to learn more about how this works, you can, you can go check out their launch blog post here. But for those who don't know, seller network is a L2 scaling solution that's been around for quite a while, doesn't get talked about as much. I mean, I know I don't talk about them kind of like as much, but they are using roll up technology. They did start off with state channels here, but yeah, it's just really cool to see just yet another L2 solution going live on Mainnet here. Right. I mean, I talk about L2 ad nauseam. Like I don't have to quite kind of like talk about it again and like how bullish it is, but it's really cool that we're seeing this L2 kind of like ecosystem just flourish, you know, permissionlessly on its own.
00:17:01.504 - 00:17:30.442, Speaker A: No one's kind of, there's no like centralization of development here. There are so many different teams working on it, you know, at least ten plus teams more than that working on it. And like more are going to come into the fray. I think people haven't realized just how big of an opportunity L2 is. And the leaders right now in the space are already kind of like doing a lot of volumes. I mean, you know, DyDX built on star Quest technology, immutable X, like all this sort of stuff. I mean, you know, immutable X here has already saved a lot of gas for, for their users, essentially.
00:17:30.442 - 00:17:46.554, Speaker A: And dy, DX is doing, I think I checked it before, it was like $40 million they did over the last 24 hours of volume. So that's growing day on day, some really steady growth there. And yeah, as I've said before, I expect that to continue happening. But yeah, so congrats. To seller on getting this out there. Really exciting to see. Go read this post.
00:17:46.554 - 00:18:23.376, Speaker A: It'll be linked in the YouTube description below. So, as I was just saying, immutable posted an update today saying that they have saved their users $2.4 million in gas costs so far. Now, I wrote about this in the Daily Grain newsletter today and about how I, how I look at this metric. So the way you can kind of look at this metric is that if all the transactions that were done on immutable X were done on the Ethereum main chain instead, based on an average gas price, which I'm sure they calculated it would have cost users $2.4 million. Now, the exciting thing here, and I guess, like the special thing about this, is that would these users have paid $2.4
00:18:23.376 - 00:19:06.668, Speaker A: million worth of fees to do these transactions? I would bet most of them wouldn't, because immutable X is an NFT exchange, trading like low value cards, right? Most of them being low value that are worth less than the fees paid. So essentially what immutable has done here is that they've unlocked $2.4 million worth of gas of demand by moving it to L2. So this is demand that just, like, wouldn't exist on the main chain, essentially. But if it did, it would account for $2.4 million of gas on the main chain. This is really, really bullish, right? This means that not only is immutable x saving users the high gas costs here, but they're also unlocking that potential and basically letting users do this kind of stuff for free.
00:19:06.668 - 00:19:50.674, Speaker A: Because fees are kind of free right now on the immutable x chain here on the L2 chain, which is really, really cool. And the other thing that I mentioned in my newsletter today was that as we progress through the L2 kind of world, it's going to become, you know, hard to track the growth. I think over time, some of the metrics will be a bit kind of like, useless. One of the metrics that I used as an example was trading volumes. So if you think about it, if, you know, gas is like, free or like, basically free, what's to stop, stop someone from spoofing trading volumes, right? And they can do that. But at the same time, when you think about it, each of each individual app is going to have their own fees, like not gas fees, but just like, you know, app fees. So, for example, if uniswap is on L2, they're still going to have 0.3%
00:19:50.674 - 00:20:28.404, Speaker A: kind of like fees. So, you know, if you try to kind of fake volume, then you're going to end up paying those fees. But you can get around that. If you were to start your own liquidity pool with a dummy token and kind of like trade back and back and forth with your own liquidity, right, I don't know why you would do that, but maybe you want to spam the chain or spam the metrics or whatever. So from that perspective, we're going to have to have metrics that kind of like, look at that and look at the nuances and look for different heuristics to kind of measure that growth there. But anyway, really cool to see this from immutable. As I said, this is just like a bunch of value that's just been unlocked for people here and great to see their growth, their growth continuing on L2.
00:20:28.404 - 00:21:06.642, Speaker A: So Argent have teased this new update that they're bringing to their next week called the Argent vault. So essentially they're selling this as multi sig security when you need it, not when you don't. And the highlights include multi factor authentication for self custody, lines of code on the app, cut by 60%, cheaper gas for DeFi by 30%, and cheaper transfers by 40%. So a massive kind of upgrade across the board here. Quality of life improvements, obviously cost improvements here. Simplicity improvements. So if you use Argent, you're definitely going to be looking forward to this coming out next week here.
00:21:06.642 - 00:21:49.642, Speaker A: So if you want to learn like all the details about it, definitely check out their blog post here. It gives, it gives a great kind of summary and like essentially kind of, I guess that goes over the benefits that are coming to end users here. So Nexus Mutual is evolving. So the Christopher here put out a tweet saying that they are launching not, not Nexus mutual, but like one KX, which is, which is who Christopher works for. He's a co founder, sorry, of one KX here. He's basically put out a forum post saying that he's launched something called Operation War Turtle, which is, which has the goal of sunsetting the legal entity behind Nexus Mutual, which will remove the requirement for K of to KyC. For NXM token holders.
00:21:49.642 - 00:22:19.450, Speaker A: This is big, right? Anything that removes KYC in any kind of app, you know, because nexus mutual I think was hammered, but hampered by this KYC is a very big deal because no one wants to KYC when they, you know, doing stuff in defi. That's the whole point. So if you remove the legal entity that controls Nexus mutual and you make it an actual kind of dow, then you can do this right. You can remove that KYC. So really, really encouraging to see here. They've got like a whole forum post up here on the Nexus mutual farm. Of course you can go read through.
00:22:19.450 - 00:22:57.440, Speaker A: There's a bunch of kind of like comments discussing it here and basically gives a full overview of what, what happens here. And I like the branding operation War turtle because it means that, like, Nexus Mutual is currently squirtle and it's going to be evolving once it gets to war turtle. I'm curious to see what blastoise looks like, you know, in the end. But yeah, really, really cool to see this out of Nexus mutual. And kudos to them for actually pushing here and making sure that they can basically sunset that legal entity and remove the KYC. So a very interesting yet puzzling announcement from Coinbase today. They have announced that they are supporting USDT transfer.
00:22:57.440 - 00:23:36.700, Speaker A: So essentially the USDT token on their exchange and only for the Ethereum based USDT. So for those of you who know that USDT is on a bunch of different chains, the biggest one besides Ethereum is Tron. And then there's like a bunch of smaller ones. But the reason why this is interesting is for a few different reasons. Now, the first reason is because Coinbase is heavily involved in USDC, right? Their own stable coin that they teamed up with circle for. So why are they supporting USDT, which is a direct competitor? Like, and I saw some kind of thoughts about this on Twitter. And essentially the reasoning was because they just have so much demand for it that by not supporting it, they're leaving money on the table.
00:23:36.700 - 00:24:10.902, Speaker A: Um, secondly, there was kind of like regulatory guidance given when that, um, that case with the, the New York attorney general's office would set was settled. I think it was like a couple months ago now. Um, and, and thirdly, uh, you know, because it's leaving money on the table, they're going to get new customers by, by supporting USDT here. I think all those reasons make sense, but I think an even weird and even more interesting thing here is that they're only supporting ethereum. USDT transfers. Yeah, I think that's for two reasons. One, because they don't support Tron as a network, right? So they couldn't support Tron transfers.
00:24:10.902 - 00:24:38.614, Speaker A: And two, when you think about it, I wrote about Ethereum being a credibly neutral platform the other day. So in, from that point of view, Coinbase is comfortable supporting Ethereum. Maybe they're not so comfortable supporting TrON because they know Tron is an incredibly neutral platform. They know Tron is quite centralized. Right. They know, you know, Tron is seen as like a scammy project within the ecosystem. So from that point of view, them supporting Tron in any capacity would probably be bad from a regulatory point of view.
00:24:38.614 - 00:25:27.898, Speaker A: So, yeah, I guess, like Ethereum's credible neutrality, neutrality wins again. But yeah, this is, this is, this is very interesting. I'm gonna see how, I want to see how this, how this kind of grows here. I want to see kind of like what Coinbase is, USDT kind of holdings look like in a few weeks, I think, you know, they're gonna balloon because this is just another avenue for, I guess, like traders to arbitrage between different exchanges, for kind of like people to use USDT to kind of exit and exit. So exit and enter through or whatever, whatever they want to do with it. So, yeah, this was probably the most interesting announcement of the last 24 hours, I would say. Just because no one saw this coming, I mean, even if you kind of like, read the comments, it's kind of funny to see this, like, will you be supporting the tether that's not backed by any reserves or only the backed kind? You know, some shit posting going on here, people saying this is a terrible idea.
00:25:27.898 - 00:25:49.930, Speaker A: You know, this really did confuse a lot of people across the ecosystem. I think there were like people for and against it. There are still lots of people who think tether is incredibly shady. I think it is somewhat shady. I think a lot of the shadiness has gone away at this point, considering that they're now doing transparency reports and stuff like that. But I'm not going to say that I'm ever going to use tether. I actually specifically avoid tether.
00:25:49.930 - 00:26:11.194, Speaker A: I, if I have to use a centralized, stable coin, I'm just using USDC. See, it's just as liquid for me. Right. I don't, I don't really see the big deal. And if I, I prefer to use Dai, of course, but, but USDC is definitely, you know, what I use if I have to use a centralized, stable coin here. But anyway, very interesting news. Curious to see what kind of growth this spurs for Coinbase here.
00:26:11.194 - 00:26:38.670, Speaker A: All right, finally, we have the Ethereum gas limit that I discussed the other day. Effectively, Ethereum's block size is now at 15 million, which represents a 20% increase from what it was just a few, a couple of days ago, which was twelve point 412.5 million. Now, I said 25% increase here. I just like, screwed up the math. So it is just a 20% increase. And as David Hoffman notes here, we can now burn more ETH, right when EIP 1559 is implemented.
00:26:38.670 - 00:26:58.990, Speaker A: Implemented. And this is because the Ethereum chain now has more capacity for more transactions. So, you know, because it's a, it's an effective block size. It kind of like, caps the amount of transactions that can be done at any given time. And by increasing it, we can do more transactions. And, you know, I don't expect any kind of, like, fee relief here. I mean, if you look at it today, the fees are back to 100 way.
00:26:58.990 - 00:27:26.458, Speaker A: But that's just because I think that the market cooled down a little bit. And, like, 100 gray has just been the norm for, like, the past, I guess, couple of weeks. And we did spike a bit there. But I don't think this gap are these gas limit increases had any kind of, like, major implications here. And, and it is definitely not a long term solution. It's definitely not something that we want to be raising willy nilly. As I explained the other day, it increases, like, a bunch of different kind of problems, like uncool block risk, dos attack risk.
00:27:26.458 - 00:28:07.622, Speaker A: And, I mean, I can quickly go over that. What essentially that means is that, you know, a DOS risk is when the chain can be attacked, or at least clients can be attacked with a denial of service attack and potentially put them, send them offline. And the uncool block risk is essentially that when, when miners mine a block, they can either mine a block that is part of the main chain, or sometimes they'll mine what's called an uncle block or an Omar block, which is essentially a stale block. It was not included in the main chain. They still get rewarded for this, but it's not included. Now, if you have too many uncle blocks, it can lead to instability of the chain. And as you raise the gas limit, more uncle blocks could potentially be formed because it's based on the blocks propagating through the network.
00:28:07.622 - 00:28:40.778, Speaker A: So if a block takes too long to propagate through the network, you know, to all full nodes, to all miners, because the gas limit is too high and the block is too large, then you have uncle block risk there. So that's, those are the two major risks of increasing the gas limit. The third, I mean, I wouldn't say it's maybe a risk, but the third, negative externality, as you. That you increase the state size of Ethereum, which makes it harder to sink a full node and makes a full node larger in size. And obviously, we don't want that to happen. So conservatively, we've raised the 15 million. Maybe we'll go higher in the future.
00:28:40.778 - 00:29:07.352, Speaker A: There's open research into making a theorem, a stateless kind of system, which would mean that we could increase the gas limit much higher. But that's still a research problem. It is not something that is definitely going to happen. We don't know for 100% if it can work in any kind of, like, ideal way. Very smart people are working on it. But yeah, it's not something that's going to happen anytime soon. I think it's part of the ETH two effort, or the wider effort, like of ETH two, but it's not something we should rely on.
00:29:07.352 - 00:29:36.116, Speaker A: So we shouldn't just increase the gas limit to 100 million and be like, oh, it's okay, stateless Ethereum is going to fix that, you know, in a year, because we don't know. So better to play a conservative here scale via L2 for now. And then, you know, if stateless ethereum has shown to work very well and work in an ideal way, then we can look at kind of like raising this gas limit to much higher levels here. But yeah, that's basically the rundown of that. And I think that's it for today. So thank you again, everyone, for listening and watching. Be sure to subscribe to the channel.
