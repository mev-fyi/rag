00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.862, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a very special episode of the Daily Gwei. Today I have with me a longtime Ethereum community member and a very good friend of mine. And a lot of you will already know who this person is. Eric Connor. He was part of Ethub. You know, me and him, we did Ethub during the last bear market, and we were doing a podcast called into the ether as part of that initiative right up until May of last year. So it's been over a year since we did our last podcast.
00:00:25.862 - 00:00:47.294, Speaker A: We actually kind of rugged. We didn't give a farewell podcast or anything like that. We kind of just stopped doing it. But we're back, and this new kind of series may become a regular thing. We don't know the cadence yet on it, and we're not going to make any promises, but we definitely want to get back into the swing of things via the Daily Gwei. Just talking about all the things we used to talk about on the. Into the ether podcast, obviously everything Ethereum.
00:00:47.294 - 00:01:02.260, Speaker A: But I think it's. It's awesome to have, like, for me personally, to have someone to just bounce stuff. Back off, uh, back off of, uh. Like I used to on the podcast with Eric, because these days I obviously do the refuel. It's on my own a lot of the time. But. But I'm excited to have a conversation with Eric today because he has a lot of unique insights.
00:01:02.260 - 00:01:18.024, Speaker A: He disagrees with me on things, which is great, because then we can just bounce off each other and see where we land there. Um, but Eric, I'll let you give, like a short intro of yourself. People who aren't familiar with you may not have listened to into the ether or paid attention to ether, maybe their first cyclers. Uh, so, yeah, go. Go ahead.
00:01:18.364 - 00:01:52.604, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. First, Anthony, thanks for having me on. I mean, obviously we go way back, I think four, maybe five years at this point ago, we started ETH hub and into the ether podcast. But yeah, for those that don't know me, um, Eric Hunter, I've been around Ethereum since before the launch 2014, before you could even get ethan your hands and trade it. So it's almost been ten years now, which is kind of crazy. I've been living and breathing, I guess, what feels like my whole life over the last ten years. You can probably see some gray hairs on the side of my head at this point because of ETH and Ethereum.
00:01:52.604 - 00:02:30.104, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, Anthony and I started Ethub four years ago, did a podcast for a while, and like you said, we did kind of rug our listeners, and there's been a couple angry people on Twitter about that. But you know what? I think it was on theme for crypto, right? The devs were cooking and the devs disappeared, and now the devs are back creating something new. So, yeah, I hit Anthony back up a few weeks ago and said, hey, what do you think about doing something again? And you've got this great thing going with Daily Gwei. So I'd be honored to hop on here every once in a while and hopefully this becomes a thing. But I guess let's see if we've got our mojo still going on this first one back.
00:02:30.624 - 00:03:05.960, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. We might just do one episode and then rug people again. I don't want to make any promises on that front, but, man, so much has happened since we did the last into the ether kind of podcast there. I mean, obviously the biggest thing being the merge, and then we recently had staking withdrawals. But it's funny because you mentioned kind of like the market downturn there, right? How basically we had the craziness of 2021, where it was actually even crazier than previous bull markets. I think because of that double top that we had, where everyone thought that May was like it, you know, May 2021, it was over. And then for some reason, I think the reason became obvious after the fact.
00:03:05.960 - 00:03:36.432, Speaker A: Um, there was a lot of leverage injected into the ecosystem, which gave us that kind of second top into the FTX collapse. And then from there, everything unwound, and it was just a crazy amount of leverage unwinding, and, and lots and lots of. Of money just got. Got burnt and lots of people got blown up, obviously. Um, but, but yeah, I think you mentioned, like, the builders. I think what I'm noticing within Ethereum, especially over the last six months, is that the builders are so energized and they're so kind of focused on the mission. We have this defined Ethereum roadmap now, and we're actually executing on it.
00:03:36.432 - 00:03:56.404, Speaker A: We actually delivered the merge, and I think everyone is just really kind of excited to keep delivering on that, especially with the l two s and things like that. So I'm curious to get your perspective overall on, I guess, like the last 18 months, because it is almost 18 months into this, I guess, bear market now. And to see kind of where you stand with that and what you think about the whole kind of ecosystem today.
00:03:56.864 - 00:04:47.048, Speaker B: Yeah, I think where we left off on the last podcast, I think you just mentioned it was just over like a year ago, and so we were just what six, eight months into this bear market stance at the time was like, I didn't really believe it was a bear market. I thought we were going to kind of like go sideways for a little bit, but not like have depths of a bear. But to be fair, that was before the whole SPF and FTX thing, right? So I think what we learned was there was a lot of illegitimate liquidity in the market, a lot of pumping happening. That was fraud, I guess we could say at this point. And we paid for it. ETH bottomed out at what, like 850 or something like that, which wasn't as bad off the top as previous highs to lows for ETH. But we've talked a lot in the past, and I agree, every cycle is going to get less and less as far as top to bottom.
00:04:47.048 - 00:05:24.074, Speaker B: So I think it was like 94% back in 2018, 2019. I don't know the exact method, but I want to say it was around like 80%, something like that, this cycle. And I think just as liquidity enters the market and more entrants and now you consider like, staking and 1559 with fee burn like that, that top to bottom is going to get less and less. So we've had to deal with our sins, I guess, as an overall crypto market, as we always do, it gets frothy. People right now on crypto Twitter and stuff are pretty bearish. But I don't know. You look at the graph, we're over double off the lows.
00:05:24.074 - 00:06:04.518, Speaker B: The global economies are a little weird still, but the S and P 500 looks like it's about to break up and doesn't look as bad as it did at least a few weeks ago when we had regional bank failure failures. Yeah, maybe some sideways chop and who knows? But I look at the graph and we're kind of past that. We've always talked about these long term cycles. We've dealt with this for 18 months now. Unless we have some weird black swan, why would we go back and retest 850, for example? I think we're kind of in this. People got into the meme coins and got burnt on nfts. We're in the shakeout period, and this always happens.
00:06:04.518 - 00:06:41.214, Speaker B: Crypto, Twitter gets dead, people get scared and bored, but the real believers stick around, around. But to your point, like, the building community has never been stronger. I mean, it's unbelievable. Like, we've got like, what, five e, two clients just ticking along and strong development teams on both of all five of those, we've got like two, maybe three execution layer clients which in the past, we only had, like, one. And there's no fear of, like, the EF, like, not being able to fund people, like we had back in 2018, 2019. You know, there's money to go around for grants and stuff like that. So, I mean, from.
00:06:41.214 - 00:07:00.154, Speaker B: From a fundamental side. I mean, gosh, we can withdraw ETH 1559s in. It's hard to be bearish there. I do think there's a lot of toxicity with meme coins and stuff that needs to be shooken out, but I think we're past that bear cycle, and now we're in that no man's land.
00:07:01.094 - 00:07:37.326, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely in the no man's land. And I think something that a lot of people have taken notice of is the real story of, I guess, the bear market and the crab market, as they call it, is the strength in ETH against bitcoin. Because if people were, remember, from the last bear market, ETH BTC, the ratio nuked like 90% or something from. From its high, which was very demoralizing back then. And it was very, very bad for Ethereum because the sentiment was just. Was just terrible. We came off the icos and then we obviously, you know, there was a narrative of the flipping in 2017 and that didn't materialize and then eat just completely created against BTC, and no one wanted to hold ETH.
00:07:37.326 - 00:08:08.166, Speaker A: Right. We had all these people just selling it, and there really was only a few of us true believers who were just stacking and still, you know, held the faith and. And made sure people were aware of why ETH was actually valuable and why it was going to become more valuable. But this bear market, it seems like there are not really any people doubting the value of ETH, besides some bitcoin maxis, who obviously are never going to change their mind on it. But I think that just generally, if you look at the chart, as you said, especially for ETH BTC, we've been pretty much flat against. Against BTC. ETH has been pretty much flat against BTC since the start.
00:08:08.166 - 00:08:52.774, Speaker A: We had that massive dip, I think, in June of last year because three ac was blowing up and all this ETH was just getting vomited onto the market. But once that cleared up, we bounced back from there, and we've been in this kind of, like, range for a long time now. So I think that overall speaks to the strength of Ethereum as a network and ETH as an asset. Now, where the market basically says, well, in a bear market, we flee not only to BTC and obviously USD, but we flee to ETH as well. ETH is like a safe haven asset for people. And obviously with the advent of staking, which happened quite a while ago, but a lot of people are only paying attention to it now because of the merge and withdrawals, there's a lot more ETH being staked. It's increasing the view of ETH as like a, of value and that kind of monetary asset within the ecosystem.
00:08:52.774 - 00:09:42.070, Speaker A: So you have this very strong ETH BTC and that's what I try to tell people when they say, oh, we have the Berm ETH deflationary, we have this massive issuance reduction. Why isn't ETH going up? It's like, well, wait a second, wait a second. ETH USD value is still relatively strong and ETH against other assets is very, very strong. So really what that's all done, especially in a low demand environment that we're in right now, it's basically set a, I wouldn't say floor for ETH price, but it's really kind of put a nice, nice of a foundation underneath ETH as an asset that allows it to continue to accrue that value and basically take value that would have gone to BTC. But instead of going to ETH during this bear market, and I think ultimately when demand comes back and we see another bull market, thats going to play out really, really positively for ETH as an asset which is just going to feed on itself. Trey.
00:09:42.102 - 00:10:17.804, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thats actually a point I wanted to hit on too. I think you nailed on the head because I see a lot like I'll tweet about 1559 or staking like a lot of eats and stake and fee burns working and people are like, well, why hasn't the ratio held up? Well, it actually has held up like amazingly well versus past bear cycles. Right. And so we have this like higher launching pad now and then in both cycles, ETH always leads, right. The excitements around ETH, like let's say defi summer, nfts, whatever's next. Like people kind of come in because of that and there's higher demand for ETH. People want to use Ethereum, they want to buy ETH.
00:10:17.804 - 00:10:50.442, Speaker B: Now you have this higher launching pad for the next bull market, which who knows when the next bull market will be. But once it's there, that ratio is way higher. And at this point, I don't want to try to predict the flipping or anything like that. But if you look at that ratio chart in bear markets, it looks pretty good for ETH right now, one of the things that I tweeted out the other day, too. You and I used to always talk about. We were early in this, and I think we just take for granted how these things have already happened. The three pillars of ETH, value accrual that's going on.
00:10:50.442 - 00:11:14.226, Speaker B: We always talked about when Defi summer was happening. The first was trust is collateral for defi. If you want to really use defi as your trustless bank, you want to use ETH. Or maybe dai, or Dai is debatable these days, maybe, whatever. But USDC, maybe you don't want to use because that could be C's. ETH is truly a trustless collateral. You could put in DeFi, earn on it, borrow against it, whatever.
00:11:14.226 - 00:12:06.010, Speaker B: The second and the third we didn't have at the time when we were talking, and that was like staking returns, like stake your ETH for network security and get a return and fee burn based on network usage. And this is all happening. So these are things, and I know, way throwback. I always say multi decade play, and we're almost a decade in. It takes a long time to realize this. And I think one of the catalysts that's happening is a lot, at least here in America, and I'm sure in Australia and I know the UK, with inflation happening and people being forced to understand this now and how money printing works and where money come from, how it's backed, people are now having to be forced to understand these concepts. And when they understand how fucked fiat currency probably is in the long term, they're going to look at crypto.
00:12:06.010 - 00:12:42.872, Speaker B: And now this pitch is there for ethics. It's complicated, even for, like, ETH heads to, like, really understand. Like, we, we get, we get it. Um, so it's going to take people a long time to, like, truly realize this, but I just. Is there really a better asset out there, period, when it comes to, like, being able to not only invest in something for upside, but use it and earn on it, and, you know, as it gets used and adopted, you also gain value by people in the network. So I think that narrative is really rounded out. Even just whenever we did our last podcast over a year ago, we didn't have withdraws.
00:12:42.872 - 00:13:07.964, Speaker B: We barely had fee burn. I think 1559 had been in for, whatever, six to twelve months, if that, and staking returns, we were still trying to figure out how much ETH would be staked because we didn't know. Withdrawals has really opened that up. And I'm sure one of the things we should talk about is this whole narrative that was happening around. Once withdrawals get enabled, we're going to see a death spiral. Well, it's completely gone the other way. And as a solo staker, I'm pissed because my yield keeps going down.
00:13:07.964 - 00:13:36.324, Speaker B: In long term, it probably is almost better for ETH value. So it like offsets. But you know, if you're, if you're an e sticker right now, you're, you're in like, I'm probably earning about with Mev on six and a half ish percent, something like that. I haven't really done the calc in the last couple of weeks with more validators coming online. But that was a funny narrative, huh? And I just, I mean, we knew it would blow up in people's face, but isn't it crazy how these things just spiral and then people start believing them even though like the people in the know are saying, look, this isn't going to happen.
00:13:37.414 - 00:14:32.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I do want to talk about that, but just to round off what you were saying about I guess the inflation point you made, I think you made an interesting point there that I haven't really seen anyone articulate, is that the fact that we have this high inflation has definitely forced people to learn about the economy, the monetary systems, how governments manage it, how central banks manage it, and fiat currency generally, which is definitely a driving force for crypto. It drives people into other assets. And I think for a lot of young people, they're going to be looking at assets that speak to them, which are be ones that kind of forward looking, the ones that are based on technology rather than old world stuff, because young people are more, much more in tune with technology and what's happening there. Obviously, we have the AI boom right now. That's a huge narrative and huge thing. But crypto is always there as well. And I think crypto definitely fits into both the tech and monetary kind of topic that people would be talking about and thinking about today.
00:14:32.598 - 00:15:08.990, Speaker A: So, yeah, that was an interesting point. And I think that's going to play out as time goes on, especially as the book, as when bull market happens. But yeah, on the front around staking, I think this is the next kind of thing we want to talk about broadly is Ethereum staking. And I've talked about this a lot on my show, but there's always more interesting stuff to talk about when it comes to it. But that withdrawal death spiral was the stupidest piece of fud that I think I've ever come across in about Ethereum. We've had some dumb fud right like over the years. But that one was so prevalent and so completely just doesn't, didn't make any sense to me that besides people saying the merge wouldn't happen.
00:15:08.990 - 00:15:33.358, Speaker A: Right. That was dumb as well. I mean, you know what? It's actually pretty, pretty easy to find some these dumb narratives. But yeah, the withdrawals kind of leading to a death spiral because one, people just had no idea how Ethereum staking works to begin with. And two, they didn't realize that people actually want to stake their eat. They don't want to sell their ETH just because the price is down a little bit from what it is. They're staking to earn more ETH because they think that the ETH price is going to go up.
00:15:33.358 - 00:15:53.238, Speaker A: So. And there's a lot of other things that feed into that. But, but yeah, when I was seeing that on crypto, Twitter and elsewhere, I always thought, you know, this is so dumb. This, this makes absolutely no sense. It's not going to play out like these people think it is. And yeah, the deposit queues, what, 77,000 pending validators right now, which is like 40 days of a queue. That's the longest the queue has ever been by far.
00:15:53.238 - 00:15:57.074, Speaker A: And it's just crazy to see just how wrong those people were. Right?
00:15:58.934 - 00:16:27.574, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just funny. Like, it was so obvious. Like, obviously a lot of people didn't want to lock their either without knowing for sure they could withdraw it, right? And like, most of us had faith that it would happen, but something could have went wrong. There was a non zero chance that withdrawals would be messed up and that was locked away forever and that whatever it was at the time, 15 million ETH or something was gone or we would have to. I doubt we would have forked for that amount. But, um, so, like, I do get it. And people just kind of like blindside, ignore that.
00:16:27.574 - 00:17:08.626, Speaker B: Um, and, you know, the only withdrawals that really happen, right, were like crack and force withdrawals because of like, um, the issues they had with sec or whatever it was. Um, but it's just like, opened the gates now for people to stake. And I do think we're seeing debates now. And I think this is a topic we, we definitely should go into around. So there's multiple ways to stake, right? There's staking as a service, which I think we could take that out. The two big ones right now are liquid staking derivatives or lsd and solo staking. Solo staking is if you have 32 ETH or more multiples of that, you can run your own hardware, you can run your own clients.
00:17:08.626 - 00:17:28.668, Speaker B: You can stake it yourself. There are benefits to that. You're in custody of your funds. You probably are getting a higher return depending on how many validators you run. But if you're running, like, mev and stuff, you know, you're. You're probably getting equal to or better return than most liquid staking derivatives can offer. If you're patient, sometimes it takes a while to get a block.
00:17:28.668 - 00:17:49.276, Speaker B: Um, so that. That's the benefit there, right? The downfalls are complications, stuff. We can dive into that a little bit. Um, on the flip side, liquid staking derivatives, within a second, you can click a button, you're staked, you're earning. Um, you don't have to do the queue. So, like, personally, I'm. I'm trying to constantly compound my ETH right into more staking.
00:17:49.276 - 00:18:06.464, Speaker B: So the second withdraw is enabled. I put my zero x one address in. I withdrew. Yes, it's a tax hit. But I think compounding this and earning more ETH is going to pay off more for me in the long run. Create more validators, put more. Ethan and I just want to keep doing that over time.
00:18:06.464 - 00:18:46.104, Speaker B: On liquid staking derivatives, you can do that pretty easily, too, because for lido, they have this thing where it just constantly. You can wrap or you can stake. And rocket pool has the same thing. I don't want to go too deeply into each one, because I know people, like, I like, tweet about liquid signatures, and there's so many, like, just shills right away, like rocket pool or lido, whatever. But so there's pros and cons to each, right? And, like, the debate in the community right now, there's two big ones. There's, if you are a solo staker, client diversity. So, like, we don't want more than 33% of people using a certain client, because if something goes wrong on the network, there could be a mass slashing event.
00:18:46.104 - 00:19:15.716, Speaker B: So we're getting. Getting there. I think Lighthouse and prism are both at, like, 36, 37. So if you are running one of those and you're interested in helping switch out to tecu or something like that, the other one is now becoming a big issue, which is, like, on liquid staking derivatives, there's a lot of e staked, for example, with Lido, and there's a lot of issues there. A. It's still centralized. They could just, like, pretty much run away with the ETH.
00:19:15.716 - 00:19:57.824, Speaker B: I don't want to misspeak a little bit. I know they've been putting some more governance controls in, but just having a lot of ETH in one area is just not good, because if they mess up their hardware or their functionality, there could be mass slashing there and all this stuff, or ETH could be lost. There could be a lot of things that could happen. So diversifying that on the liquid staking derivative side. So I know you have opinions here, and I think we can eventually get into solo staking stuff, but I'd be curious to see what you think just on. I guess my question would be, do you think the client diversity on the solo staking side or the liquid staking diversity is more of a pressing issue for the community right now?
00:19:58.644 - 00:20:30.986, Speaker A: Definitely the liquid staking issue. I think client diversity is mostly a solved thing. The critical threshold where it becomes an actual issue is 66% for client diversity, and that's on CL and El. I think the geth is still above that from some measures, but there's work to get that kind of fixed there. But yeah, I would say the client diversity, it's not like solved, but it's not like a critical issue in my eyes. Whereas the LSD stuff, it might not be at the critical point yet, but it could get there. And I think you mentioned Lido.
00:20:30.986 - 00:21:09.142, Speaker A: Obviously, Lido is always the one people mention because they have the most stake. The thing with Lido is that there is, I guess a saving grace there, that the stake is actually distributed to different operators all around the world. But the main concern I think people have is that you have the Steth token, which is just its own token. It's its own universal token. It doesn't matter if you're ETH staked with one provider over another. With Lido, the steth is still connected and part of that sole ecosystem. Then people worry about, okay, what kind of governance influence can the lido as an ecosystem have over Ethereum itself? Because obviously there's the LDO token, which governs the lido ecosystem.
00:21:09.142 - 00:22:05.402, Speaker A: But can that actually translate into governance for the Ethereum protocol because they have such a large share? I would argue not really, because yes, they have a large share of stake, but it's more about what their voice is. What share of the voice do they have? And I don't think it's that big. I think that they obviously involved with conversations when it comes to core protocol stuff at some level. Obviously they follow along with the work being done because they need to make sure Lido can keep up with it. Like withdrawals, for example, Lido enabled their own withdrawals a month after withdrawals went live. So I think that what people really get concerned about is, as you said, like, you don't want too much stake with, with one entity because it leads to all these downstream issues, particularly around governance and social issues, and compromising on credible neutrality, because it's also a bad narrative when people say, oh, look, lido controls over 30% of the network, and then if you take Lido and a few centralized exchanges, they could collude to do some damage. I'm like, yeah, okay, yes, theoretically, they can always collude to do some damage.
00:22:05.402 - 00:22:31.914, Speaker A: But I think what people forget is that there are a lot of mechanisms in place to both prevent the collusion to begin with and then deal with it if it does actually happen. Yes, some of them aren't clean. Like, social slashing is like a nuclear option. It is not something we ever actually want to do. It wouldn't be clean, but it is there. But I think the community wants to focus on making sure that the risk of us ever using that nuclear option stays as close to 0%. The chance, I should say, stays as close to 0% as possible.
00:22:31.914 - 00:23:11.278, Speaker A: And the way we do that is by getting stake away from any one provider too much stake away from any one provider, like Lido, for example, and going to, going to someone else. And I think generally, besides Lido, the beacon chain actually looks quite healthy. None of the other providers have too much share, but I guess that doesn't really mean much. We definitely need to make sure that Lido, I mean, maybe, maybe doesn't go down from here, but at least stops growing. I think that's what people are trying to do at this point, trying to direct stake to other places. And as you mentioned as well, with solo staking, you've been talking something you wanted to talk about and something that I want to talk about as well. You've been talking a lot on Twitter about how solid staking is still really hard from a technical perspective.
00:23:11.278 - 00:23:30.710, Speaker A: And it definitely is. Like, there's no sugar coating that I think. I, I mean, I run a lot of different staking setups, but I come at it from a technical background. I, you know, I've been, I've done it courses, computer science courses, things like that. And I've. I've taught myself a lot of this stuff. But you come from a different background, right? You, you weren't really into that stuff early on, before you got into Ethereum, uh, and started staking.
00:23:30.710 - 00:23:43.422, Speaker A: So my view of it might be different to yours because of that as well. But I'm curious on your kind of experience with it. Like, you. You say on Twitter a lot that it's very difficult. Uh, it's. It's scary at times. Cause you think you did something wrong and.
00:23:43.422 - 00:23:50.350, Speaker A: Yeah, you. You're encouraging people to build better ux UI kind of stuff for solo staking. So. So, yeah, I'm curious on your thoughts on that one.
00:23:50.502 - 00:24:04.238, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's a great topic. First, the last thing I'll say on Lido is the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is they put, like, a governance vote up to ask if they wanted to, like, cap and, like, come on. Like, it's way more centralized than that.
00:24:04.326 - 00:24:16.934, Speaker A: Like, it's not like, yeah, that. That whole thing. I've had people, like, I've given my opinions about that a lot, but I don't think people like it when I say that. I don't think they're going to self limit because they're a for profit business and why would they self limit?
00:24:16.974 - 00:24:52.762, Speaker B: Right, exactly. Yeah. So that was kind of like a weird, like, I don't want to say farce, but, like, a weird way to say, oh, look, we don't want to self limit because the token voters said, like, they could if they really wanted to, but, yeah, so I think solo staking is a great topic. I actually think it's not talked about enough, the user experience behind it. So if there was one thing I would say right now as a community, or maybe the EF could fund it. I don't like falling back on the app, but I actually think this would be a good thing for them to do. It would be to, like, do I come from, like, a product management background? Do, like, a user study on who are the people solo staking.
00:24:52.858 - 00:24:53.306, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:53.410 - 00:25:16.014, Speaker B: Like, what is their background? Who are they? What's the average amount of ETH people have? Like, are solo stakers? Do they have one validator on average, or do they have 20? Do they have 100? Like, I. I really don't know. And it's hard to gauge on Twitter. So I've kind of slowly become, like, people are kind of championing different things. Things, right. Like, people are championing client diversity now. We have, like, the LSD diversification.
00:25:16.014 - 00:25:51.030, Speaker B: I don't see a lot of talk to me personally. I think one of the bigger issues is the UX around solo staking. And why I say that is because, I mean, I'm pretty techy. Like, I've been around this stuff for ten years now, crypto in general, but I use a Mac on a day to day basis, and you just like, and I've used GitHub terminal Linux when I have to. But in reality to become a solo staker you have to have an air gapped Linux machine. We talk about just private key management in general. You have to do that.
00:25:51.030 - 00:26:10.094, Speaker B: And some the prompt will be like, oh, this is your index zero. You start at zero. So your second one is actually index one. It gets complicated and you have to walk through and make sure you do it right. And then you generate this data offline. You move it off in the air gap machine. You send the deposit data.
00:26:10.094 - 00:26:55.638, Speaker B: Then you have to like weigh and understand the queue and then like why you're not activated. Then once you're activated you got to like load your key stores in and there's a password for your key stores and there's like, you know, there's your like withdrawal keys and there's just like your validating keys. It's just for those of us that have been around it for a long time, it makes sense. But if I'm someone that bought 1000 ETH five years ago, which isn't crazy, right, you put 510 grand into ETH, something like that and you've just sat on it and you're like, oh, I would like to make five, 6% on it. What are the odds that these people really understand that if you're not like really in the game, right? And you're just like, oh, staking is enabled. I want to use it. They're probably going to Coinbase or Lido because they don't want to do this shit, dude.
00:26:55.638 - 00:27:05.222, Speaker B: Once like the withdrawals happen. I had to like remember what I did four years ago because it was like December 19. I think it had been like almost three years.
00:27:05.318 - 00:27:10.230, Speaker A: 2020. December 2020. Yeah, yeah, it's still a while ago. I mean, it feels, it feels, it feels very long.
00:27:10.262 - 00:27:27.240, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels forever ago. So yeah, you're right. So it was like 20 something months. And I'm like, I had to like, I knew where my keys were. Of course I put them together and I just had to like recreate everything. Okay, wait. I had to like know my validator indices, like what numbers they were.
00:27:27.240 - 00:27:53.922, Speaker B: And I had to like understand this withdrawal credential change from zero x zero to zero X one. There's a lot. And I've since switched to, I used to run, I think I used to talk on about it on into the ether, but I used to run a Mac mini I run on DAP node now on a intel nuc like using their Linux distribution. And it's a lot easier. Like huge shout out to Dap node. We've been fans of DAP node since literally like the day they launched, I think. But I mean, they've made it a lot easier.
00:27:53.922 - 00:28:14.722, Speaker B: There's this like key manager they have. You can plug and play into different things. They have slashing protection, so it has gotten easier. But I think something like DaP node should be like funded a lot more. I know gnosis has done a lot there. Champion like that kind of. And Tim Biko is in my replies yesterday and he's great and I'm sure he's taking notes and I think things will happen here.
00:28:14.722 - 00:28:30.058, Speaker B: Um, but I do think we really underestimate the amount of people that might be sitting on a decent amount of ETH that are saying, you know what, this is way too complicated for me. Like, I'm just going to throw it in and, you know, they're probably like, oh, what's the most popular LSD? Oh, Lido click. Right, right. Like, they're not.
00:28:30.186 - 00:28:30.498, Speaker A: If.
00:28:30.546 - 00:28:47.410, Speaker B: If people trust their money with them, I'm going to trust it too. And that's just like human nature. Right. And you kind of. I think rocket pool is doing great things. Um, if I use an lsd, I would use them, but they. Their site's a little more kind of like techie and like talking about decentralization.
00:28:47.410 - 00:29:04.002, Speaker B: It's just Lido kind of has that like just enticing, like one click feel. I don't. I don't know how to explain it, but they do. And that. I think solving solo staking would help a little bit. A lot bit, I think. But of course, there's still people from.
00:29:04.002 - 00:29:29.894, Speaker B: I mean, the two solutions that probably will never happen. But could one of them? I don't think technically is possible, but you basically pay less rewards to liquid staking derivatives. But that's almost impossible because you could split them among so many keys that you couldn't figure it out. The second would be to lower the 32 e threshold, which I don't know if there's been discussion around that or not, but that could potentially be one, too. But, yeah, that's my rant on solo staking.
00:29:30.634 - 00:29:57.714, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's. There's a lot that goes into this, right. I mean, I think just to hit on your last point there, the. The last time I heard people talking about lower, lowering the 32 ETH requirement was quite a while ago now. And I've spoken about this on the refuel a lot where I basically say that in the long term, I don't know how much it actually makes an impact, because I think that the number one barrier, even if we were to solve the technical stuff right now, the number one barrier to solo staking is that capital requirement.
00:29:57.714 - 00:30:18.412, Speaker A: Right. That 30 tweet requirement for. For at least newer people to the ecosystem, because most new people aren't going to drop enough money to buy 32 ETH and then go straight into solo staking or anything like that. So I think that's the biggest thing. But the thing is that we all expect ETH to go up in price, right? So today, 32 ETH is worth such and such dollars. But what if ETH goes to ten k? That's. That's 320 grand.
00:30:18.412 - 00:30:25.636, Speaker A: Okay, let's lower it to 16 ETH. Well, that's still 160 grand. Okay, let's go to 80th. It's still 80 grand. Right. So you can lower it. Right.
00:30:25.636 - 00:31:00.652, Speaker A: You can even lower it to one ETH. But if ETH goes to, like, 1020 grand, that is still out of the, I guess, out of reach for a lot of people. So I think that lowering it probably isn't the best idea. I think creating lsds or just, like, liquid kind of pools that people can stake with that are decentralized and that can kind of be done in a smaller capacity. So rocket pool obviously exists, but then there are things like stakewise. V three has their vaults coming out, which basically allows you to create a vault and then have people essentially delegate their stake to you, I guess. And then you run the validator software and manage it for them like that.
00:31:00.652 - 00:31:44.844, Speaker A: So if we have thousands of those people doing that, that would be much better than, obviously, what we have today. So there are different kinds of solutions. There's DVT technology from, like, oval labs being able to do squad staking and basically split the keys up so you can all run a validator, and you can all just throw in, like, eight each if there's four of you. Right. So that kind of stuff is what. What I'm paying most attention to. But I think the thing that people disagree with me on this, but as an opinion I have, I think that there's always going to be some level of technical competency needed to be a solo stake or to run the software to be a solo staker to begin with, because so, like staking, generally, you can abstract away everything, but there are still things that you're going to need to know how to do, especially if things go wrong.
00:31:44.844 - 00:32:14.186, Speaker A: Like, for example, if you are not attesting for whatever reason, you need to diagnose that you need to know why. Yes, you can build software that tells you, here's a list of reasons why. But let's say for some reason you don't open your port and you're not attesting to such and such blocks because your peer connectivity is crappy, then you got to go learn what opening a port is because no one's going to do that for you. Right. You have to actually do that yourself. And I had a lot of experience with this, with video games, and a lot of people did, and they learned it because it was just a necessity. So there is always going to be some level, I think, of technical competency needed.
00:32:14.186 - 00:33:13.882, Speaker A: Even if we make it as simple as possible, which is okay, because if we make it so simple that people don't know how to fix their setups when something goes wrong, then what ends up happening is that we have validators on the network that are duds and that brings overall network effectiveness down and actually harms ethereum more than it benefits from having more solo stakers on the network. So that's where I fundamentally think that we shouldn't dumb solo staking down to the point where people can't actually fix something if it goes wrong. We should obviously help people. As I said, have a list of things that people and can look at. Hey, you know, if you're not attesting to blocks, it might be because your Internet's offline or such and such happened, or this happened, or, you know, in the worst case scenario, you got slashed and you can explain to them this is why you got slashed, because you were trying to run the same software on two different machines, those sorts of things. Right. And that that's kind of how I generally view it because I know having staked for a long time, having multiple setups for different kind of reasons, and being technical as I am, like, there's a lot of issues that I've run into that I've had to diagnose and fix.
00:33:13.882 - 00:33:45.854, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people wouldn't, wouldn't have done that if it was so dumbed down where they were just like one click into the staking, they wouldn't have known how to do that and they would have gotten frustrated and probably just like said, screw it, and then got leaked out eventually when it happened, and then their validator just exited. But as I said, that would bring down network kind of effectiveness and in my view, not be too healthy for the network. But I agree with all of your points around just making solace, thinking easier than it is today, because today it is still shocking. Dap node is awesome. But other than dap node. Yeah, most other solutions are still pretty shocking.
00:33:46.634 - 00:34:11.334, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And if you go to, like, the ethereum.org side, it just directs you to the most complicated path. Like, maybe we just need, like, hey, if you don't really have a ton of technical expertise, this is still pretty complicated, but you should go down this path. It's like Dap node or whatever other solution, and we don't want to put all our eggs in DAP node, right. Because they have the ability to, like, update and like, you don't have to do the updates, but you just kind of like, trust them to do it. Like, if that was to get compromised, what happens there? Of course.
00:34:11.334 - 00:34:47.554, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, we talked a lot about this in the past. Like when bitcoin maxis were coming after staking, they're like, oh, it's free money. It's not free money, right? It shouldn't be free money. It's definitely not. Like a couple of weeks ago when we had the network hiccups and people thought Ethereum went down, blah, blah, blah, bankless thought Ethereum went down. I had to throw that in there whenever we didn't have finality for a little bit of time. People didn't realize that if you were staking, your funds were at risk, especially if you're on a majority client that was going down and stuff.
00:34:47.554 - 00:35:45.678, Speaker B: There was a time where you're like, okay, this network back, I'm sorry, you know, that the leak was going to be bigger and bigger on my ETH that I have stake, and I do think there is a technical debt for sure to staking too, that you do need to. And I've learned a lot about things in my staking days, but I do think we run the risk of in general right now, humans take like, the easy, lazy path and like, if as a whole, as a community, as a network, we fall into that. I do worry that lsds could take over. To your point, I agree with you earlier, Lido having a certain stake, and I think it's a very good topic, too. What is the problem? If Lido has a large stake, they don't have a better say in government. This is why we've always argued against token governance on Ethereum itself, because we do have this loose governance. We don't really know what to call it.
00:35:45.678 - 00:36:25.742, Speaker B: But just because Lido has 20 30% of e stake doesn't mean they get more say in, like, how what happens with the network or like what forks happen and all this, our network upgrades, whatever you want to call them and that's the beauty of Ethereum, right. But I don't want us to get to a point where it's like ETH goes to ten k, we still haven't improved solo staking. So the barrier to entry is huge, the barrier, the technical barrier to entry is huge and we just default to LSD's. So that I think that's my biggest concern. And this is why I would love to see this like survey, right, of Ethereum stakers. And maybe like the e staking community has done it. I mean they're a great community.
00:36:25.742 - 00:36:50.754, Speaker B: Maybe I missed it kind of in some of my time off but this like overall it's hard to do because like how do you prove like maybe you could have people like sign and say hey this is my address and you can see this is the ETH I'm staking. But like are most stakers staking like one ETH through LSDs or most people do, they have 1000 ETH and they're solo staking. Like it would be cool to at least like kind of understand that and then be able to better attack the problem.
00:36:51.774 - 00:37:22.160, Speaker A: I think there was a survey done I can't remember who did it if it was like eats stake or the EF but it was done a while ago now so I don't have it handy to bring up to see. But there was also a recent report from rated.net work. I don't know if you saw that around stakers and they said that 6.5% of the Ethereum network right now is solo stakers. Now this includes rocket pool operators as well like the node operators which is fine I think because rocker pool mini pool operators are as close to solo staking as you can get besides being a solo staker. So yeah 6.5%
00:37:22.160 - 00:38:11.120, Speaker A: which is actually like pretty, pretty good I think given that capital requirement as I said I do still think that's the number one barrier which as I said there are solutions that can bring that down. But yet to your point if we don't make it easier people will just go to these LSD's in droves. But I think that can also be alleviated by making the LSD's just better, making them more distributed as I mentioned with stakewise with their vaults and doing stuff like oval. Like the LSD isnt necessarily bad, its just obviously bad when they have centralizing forces behind them. And that, that actually has a lot to do with liquidity, I think where Steth, as a token, has pretty deep liquidity. Whales feel comfortable staking with lido over something else because they get that liquidity premium, essentially. But I think that over time thatll definitely come down because therell be more liquidity injected into other tokens.
00:38:11.120 - 00:38:32.420, Speaker A: Therell be things like incentives for people to provide liquidity and all that sorts of stuff. And thats what my tweet was actually about. My long rant on Twitter was about, you know, these other providers and these other people building these solutions. You need to be competitive. Like, Lido, honestly is as dominant as it is because it is a good product. They have done a lot of marketing, a lot of business development. They, they're out there grinding, right.
00:38:32.420 - 00:38:56.308, Speaker A: And that, and then they're, they're kind of like getting the fruits of their labor today. So I think less, maybe less coping about lighter's dominance and more doing was my kind of message there. And some people pushed back on it saying the social layer is important. I'm like, yes, of course it's important. I never said it wasn't important. But the social layer without action is, is rather useless, right? Because if there's nothing being done to change things, then you can scream into the void as much as you want. It's still not going to change anything.
00:38:56.308 - 00:39:23.630, Speaker A: So yeah, I think overall we're still in a decent place when it comes to Ethereum staking, but we can get a lot better, and I think we will. It's a long term game too. I mean, just by virtue of the staking queue and the exit queue limiting how many people can enter an exit per day, you're not going to see massive changes in market share because of that. It's not like you're going to see Lido drop 10% market share in a day. That's impossible. It can't actually happen because they can't exit 10% of their validators in a day. So it's going to take years for this to play out.
00:39:23.630 - 00:39:36.874, Speaker A: But I think people want to start the conversations now and start pushing now so that it can actually play out. Because if we start them in like one to two years from now where the problem's gotten worse, then, yeah, we're starting from like a shittier position than we could be starting from today.
00:39:37.734 - 00:40:06.576, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And like, it comes down to if, if you are staking with an LSD and you are staked in a more centralized, like larger LSD, like, you have to take that risk into account. But at the end of the day, like, the market is the market. People are saying, I'm staking with Lido. I don't know why. They do have, like, slightly higher rewards, I guess. But, you know, that just is what it is like if a competitor, competitors will come along, right? There's a lot of ones coming online now.
00:40:06.576 - 00:40:37.750, Speaker B: And to your point, like, we might not even see the full effect of withdrawals from someone like Lido for a while. And, like, I don't want to just, like, shit on Lido. Like you said, they put a great product, like, they were one of the first to market. They've done a great job at what they're doing. But as a community, it's healthy to talk about this stuff. So it's interesting on the solo staking, too. That percentage is probably about where I would hope, maybe a little higher than I thought, but hopefully that doesn't shrink towards 1% someday.
00:40:37.750 - 00:40:49.318, Speaker B: But I 100% agree with you. The capital requirement and will only get bigger if ETH goes to ten k, you know? Yeah, exactly. You're talking 320K just to run one validator, right?
00:40:49.366 - 00:40:49.670, Speaker A: So.
00:40:49.742 - 00:40:55.126, Speaker B: Or three hundred twenty k. I had it right. It's a little late where I am.
00:40:55.270 - 00:40:56.754, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you got the math right.
00:40:58.014 - 00:41:46.544, Speaker B: Second guessing myself for a little bit there, but yeah, I mean, I guess just to switch a little bit. One thing we were kind of talking early on before we started recording, and we've talked now about, like, this narrative of inflation coming across the world. Like, one of the most fascinating things to me is when we first started talking about Ethereum, you and I, probably even before we started recording podcasts and as we were recording them, like, what would east narrative be like, why would ETH win? And we always knew in the back of our head, just as a strong money. And we've been talking about with now Feedburn and staking and all that, it's gotten stronger. But we always focused on Defi and the next cases. We had a lot of cases that maybe haven't worked out yet. And of course, we had, like, a wild time with Defi.
00:41:46.544 - 00:42:12.634, Speaker B: And that's cooled off, but we'll come back. I find it fascinating. Now, I'm curious to hear your take. What will bounce back? Like, what will be the next big narrative for ETH? Like, now that NFTs have cooled off, Defi had cooled off, maybe coming back, but Ethan's just like a money might be, which is funny, right? Because that was our initial, like, ETH is money, meme, everything. Is that what's going to drive the next cycle?
00:42:13.814 - 00:42:44.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that we actually said this on the podcast around Defi in particular, where Defi Summer was kind of the thing that kicked it all off and kind of brought it into the mainstream view, but was more of an anomaly. And I remember us saying that we thought Defi was going to be big, but it was going to be boring and it was going to be something that happened in the background. It wasn't going to be something that most people would pay attention to, but it would keep getting bigger and bigger. And it has, right? It definitely has. I mean, I'm not just talking about TVL, I'm talking about volumes like uniswap trading volumes, stuff like that. Right? It's. It's very big.
00:42:44.094 - 00:43:04.566, Speaker A: And there are more and more defi protocols going online all the time. There are real world asset protocols now coming online that are growing. So that's all happening. But it's. It's boring. People don't care about that over something like nfts. They want to go trade some jpegs, right? So that that kind of stuff is, is more at the surface, but the, the defi stuff is underneath the surface and it's where a lot of the action is happening.
00:43:04.566 - 00:43:49.430, Speaker A: But in terms of what the next kind of big catalyst for, I guess, ethereum is going to be, I actually think it's going to be l two s. Even though l two s have been alive for a while, obviously arbitrary and optimism have a lot of activity on them. I think that there is a confluence happening where at the end of this year, 4844 should go live, which will dramatically reduce the costs for these roll ups, the end user costs for rollups. Then we're going to have Coinbase launch their base main net, I think probably either before or after that happens, they're going to onboard a lot of new people into the on chain world, basically. And then next year, I feel like the market's going to be better than it is this year. It's a feeling totally based on fact. It's more of a kind of an intuition, right.
00:43:49.430 - 00:44:26.432, Speaker A: Just based on experience. So I feel like there's a confluence of those things happening where you're essentially going to have ultra cheap block space on these l two s for new users to use. You're going to have like all of these protocols going live, like defi apps, stuff like that. You're going to have base, you're going to have the narrative shifting. You're going to have just generally, I think, prices going up across the board, which obviously always is good for a positive narrative. And I do really think that those l two s are going to lead to an actual l two summer where we get a ton of activity on them. Everyone starts complaining because maybe we get so much activity that the fees actually start going up to levels that people just don't want to pay them anymore.
00:44:26.432 - 00:44:47.604, Speaker A: And then maybe there's some tokens go nuts, whether they be l two tokens or app tokens, whatever it is. But I do strongly believe that there is a pretty good chance and a pretty good confluence, probably beginning next year or even towards the end of this year, that l two s are going to lead us into a new kind of, maybe not total bull market, but something similar we saw with Defi. Some are.
00:44:48.464 - 00:45:07.044, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a good point. I definitely agree with you. I mean, it's funny because L2 has always become in demand, like, during a bull market. Right? Like, but it's a great time to build. Layer two is when no one's talking about them and they're there. Like, usage on arbitram for sure. Like, during the whole meme coin mania was like through the roof.
00:45:07.044 - 00:45:53.902, Speaker B: And this will be, you know, it's funny now as like a staker, like, as a greedy staker, like, for the network, I don't want it to be the case, but as a greedy staker, like, I'm anxious for the bull market where, like, fees are really high because, like, the income will be crazy. But, you know, as a long term ETH believer, I think it's better, obviously, to like, onboard people to L2s and keep fees lower. It's always that, like, where is that threshold? Right? We kind of saw during like, the whole like, pepe thing and meme coins. Like, you know, I think we settled. We were like at like 150 to 200 base fee for like a while, like a couple weeks. And that stuff still is traded on Mainnet. Like, I'll see people, like, I'll look through blocks randomly and people are trading like $5 worth of pepe and paying like $50.
00:45:53.902 - 00:46:00.394, Speaker B: I'm like, I don't know. Like, is the iq just that low of the general user?
00:46:02.654 - 00:46:09.726, Speaker A: I think people who are gambling on meme coins, I think they just throw their brain out. I don't think they have an iq left when they're doing that.
00:46:09.870 - 00:46:39.990, Speaker B: Click. Oh, wait. Oh, my, he's gone. Oh, well, yeah. Cause you paid it all on fees. I mean, we're literally seeing people like, just send ETH to influencers. So it's a weird time, like, in the market, but I think as, like, apps themselves, defi, like NFT apps, gaming apps, eventually, like things, like Magic we've talked about in the past, like, those are all living over on arbitrum eventually, like optimism, like, as people land there, like you said, like, Coinbase will directly bridge people to these L2s.
00:46:39.990 - 00:46:55.074, Speaker B: I think that is going to be when we see it, and I think it's happening and will happen for sure in a bull market. It's like the user doesn't really know that they got on a L2. They're just like, oh, fees are cheap. This is great. It's a $0.01 fee. I'm just going to use this.
00:46:55.074 - 00:46:59.074, Speaker B: That'll be the breakthrough, I think, into L2.
00:47:00.654 - 00:47:39.054, Speaker A: It's very similar, I think, to why Defi Summer happened in that in 2018 2019, all the groundwork for Defi summer was being laid. All the defi apps are going live. We had stable coins coming to Ethereum, coming online, all that sorts of stuff, and then we had DeFi summer because of that. The same is true for what I believe is going to be an actual l two summer, because we're laying all the groundwork, all the apps are deploying there. There's activity there. We have the big upgrade with 4844 coming, which, as I said, will dramatically reduce costs or should dramatically reduce costs. So that's why I'm saying there's just so many things that I feel like are going to kind of come together towards the end of this year and next year that it could definitely lead to that.
00:47:39.054 - 00:48:26.990, Speaker A: I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but I don't know feeling. And I like to work off my feelings and intuition sometimes and not just look at the hard facts. Because I think when it comes to crypto and especially markets generally, a lot of the best kind of investors in the world, from what I've seen, are the ones who really don't just look at the hard facts, but also go off their own experience and intuition. Because at the end of the day, there's that saying of, right, history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes and it's been memed to death. But it's so true, right? There are so many things that play out in very, very similar ways. It may not be exactly the same, but if you really just break it down and watch and see what happens, they play out very similarly, especially when it comes to markets, because humans basically default to herd behavior in markets where they basically just all follow each other. And it's kind of like a hive mind that goes on we saw that, I mean play out with the meme coin.
00:48:26.990 - 00:48:49.106, Speaker A: Like everyone just suddenly jumped onto Pepe and then like oh my God, meme coins now. Right. It's like a two to three week phenomenon, but during an actual crypto bull market it becomes like a potentially year, like twelve to 18 month thing. And picking where, where I guess the herd is going to go is what makes you I guess a good investor. And then also picking when the herd is going to leave is probably more important than picking where theyre going to go. Robert.
00:48:49.130 - 00:49:16.770, Speaker B: Yeah, no doubt. I mean honestly, thats been my investment thesis for a long time. The first stock I ever heavily went into was Apple back in I was in college, 2007, 2008 because I bought the first iPhone. Im like this is unbelievable. And then I bought a MacBook and I was in, right and I just lived it. And then I would buy stocks just based on my experience. Like I love Chipotle at the time, which is funny to talk about now because it's so mainstream.
00:49:16.770 - 00:49:38.094, Speaker B: But there were only a couple Chipotle's. I grew up on the west coast, right. And there were only like a few of them. I've done that my whole life. So I totally agree. That is the investment thesis and believe in what you invest in, live it. We've always done that with Ethereum and I think if you can just hold on and not chase these things, it's not even about making a bad trade.
00:49:38.094 - 00:50:05.412, Speaker B: It's just like just sit in ETH and watch other people. Yeah, you'll see on Twitter, like, oh yeah, I'm up like 5000% in Pepe. Well I guarantee that they either lost previously or after that or like, you know, aren't telling the truth. Right. And I think just chasing these things is not the way to win. But just to kind of wrap up my thoughts here too. Like, I like what you said around the groundwork being laid.
00:50:05.412 - 00:50:37.750, Speaker B: So even if you look back to nfts, right, punks and cryptokitties 2017, it was like, oh, what is this stuff? Like it's clogging the network. This is stupid. And then two or three years later, but the groundwork had been laid. The standard was there, the NFT standard with the 721 and people had talked about, they experienced it and then all of a sudden it blew up. So I do agree with their thesis around L2. Because of that, the groundwork's there. People know about it.
00:50:37.750 - 00:51:14.894, Speaker B: You know, you can use it. But it's always like early on, people don't even go back to like the original iPhone people are like, okay, this thing's cool, but, like, is this really going to be, like, it seems too expensive and, like, you know, it's too rudimentary and too early. Well, like, the thing didn't even have an App Store yet. It took three or four years for it to get apps on it. And then, like, for high speed, like, sell your service to come to it. And to me, that's a good analogy for L2s. I mean, they're there and they're improving every day, but you gotta, like, see these things early on and kind of anticipate them to, like, really make big.
00:51:16.074 - 00:51:39.514, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I think people just often forget that they are still quite early. I know, again, that's been memed to death by crypto, Twitter, the, you know, your early meme. But it's true, because if you just actually look at who's used on chain products, I'm not talking about people holding crypto on a centralized exchange. That, that is just not crypto to me. Crypto to me is using your actual on chain products. Maybe there's a few million at most that have done that.
00:51:39.514 - 00:52:21.456, Speaker A: And if you're talking about active users, people who do that maybe even at least once a month, and I don't know if once a month can be considered very active, but still, it would be very, very low compared to what it can be one day. We want it to be in the billions of people, and that's the opportunity. That's the opportunity of getting in early to things, getting on the ground floor. But obviously, there's a lot of risk involved, too, which I think a lot of people don't really like taking. You know, they'd rather stay safe and comfy, which is fine, too. There are, there are safe assets or safer assets, and then there are really risky ones. You know, there's meme coins you can gamble on, or there is ETH that you can hold the different risk profiles, different reward profiles, and it's just what suits, I guess, your individual own bias and what you're interested in doing.
00:52:21.456 - 00:52:43.264, Speaker A: But, but, yeah, I think that's a great way to look at it, for sure. Dope. All right, well, I guess we can, we can wrap it up there for today. I do definitely want to continue these regularly. I don't want to rug people. I don't want to rug ourselves, because these are always fun. And as I said at the beginning, Eric, you always bring interesting perspectives and things that I haven't thought of before.
00:52:43.264 - 00:52:51.964, Speaker A: And it's always great to bounce back and forth someone, rather than just me talking to the camera. So, thank you for coming on, and. Yeah, I really hope we can do this regularly.
00:52:52.344 - 00:52:59.960, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Thanks for having me, first and foremost. But, yeah, we can't just. That was too much fun to do. One and done. So we'll have to come up with some kind of cadence here. Yeah.
00:52:59.992 - 00:53:06.034, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Cool, man. All right, well, till next time. Thanks, everyone, for listening and watching, and I'll see you next time. Bye.
