00:00:01.400 - 00:00:26.168, Speaker A: Because there's not that much funds. Okay, everyone, just note before we get started, please put yourself on mute, unless you're talking, obviously. And if you've got voice activation on, make sure you're on mute, because that'll activate it. All right. All right, cool. Welcome, everyone, to the first deli, gwei Ama. Yeah, so I decided, you know, a few days ago that I really wanted to.
00:00:26.168 - 00:01:03.864, Speaker A: To start doing weekly or probably bi weekly or every couple of weeks. Ama's just so that you guys can ask me questions, anything about Ethereum. It doesn't have to be just me answering it. If anyone else wants to chime in and answer or anything like that, I think that'd be really cool, because I always see tons of questions in the Discord channel, and I figured, why not just jump on a call and you guys can ask me whatever you want, and I'll try and answer as best I can. So, yeah, I mean, there's no real kind of structure to it. Like, feel free to just speak up if you kind of, like, have a question or want to. I want to ask something, but just be courteous and try not to talk over other people or anything like that.
00:01:03.864 - 00:01:08.924, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, without further ado, feel free to, you know, ask away.
00:01:11.864 - 00:01:26.116, Speaker B: I have a question about the AMA. Will it be on stuff, like. Like, for the daily guy, or can we ask stuff about, like, ethereum and other eRc twenty s and stuff like that?
00:01:26.300 - 00:01:35.144, Speaker A: Yeah, anything got to do with Ethereum or even crypto in general. It's. It's pretty free flowing. So, yeah, feel free to ask anything. It doesn't have to be about the daily or anything like that.
00:01:39.364 - 00:01:43.048, Speaker B: I have a question about Elon's tweet.
00:01:43.236 - 00:01:43.824, Speaker C: Mm hmm.
00:01:43.904 - 00:01:44.804, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:01:47.064 - 00:02:07.524, Speaker B: Do you think, like, other high net worth people will follow Elon's? Like, I think. I feel like it's virtue signaling at this point because it's been. There's been a lot of debunking for the environment argument. But do you think, like, whales will follow that virtue signaling and decide to get out of bitcoin?
00:02:08.384 - 00:02:14.168, Speaker A: That's a. That is a question. That's for sure. Elon is a. Is a funny person. He's. He's a.
00:02:14.168 - 00:02:45.608, Speaker A: He's eccentric, right? Like. Like your classic eccentric billionaire who. Who basically does a lot of stuff that may seem, you know, crazy or weird to the outside world and makes maybe a little bit more sense when. When you dive into it. His recent comments about bitcoin's energy use, while on the surface, you might think you know, it's surprising that he would be saying this after buying BTC. And he. I remember he put out a tweet where he replied to Jack, the Twitter CEO, you know, and Jack had tweeted out, bitcoin encourages renewable energy production.
00:02:45.608 - 00:03:21.016, Speaker A: And then Elon Musk said, true. So, you know, there was some speculation that he put these comments out because he's trying to protect Tesla and make sure Tesla can stay in ESG friendly. Kind of like portfolios, the actual stock, the Tesla stock. But in terms of, like, him as a signal, I mean, I've written about it before. I do think he's a pretty powerful signal among a lot of people. I'm not sure how powerful he is among other billionaires or other kind of like, whales or anything like that, but among, like, the kind of, I guess you could call it general tech population, people who are really into tech and. And all this sort of stuff, they.
00:03:21.016 - 00:03:43.532, Speaker A: There seems to be a cult around. Around Elon from. From those types of people. From what I've seen, and don't get me wrong, I really like Elon as well. I love what, you know, what he's done with Tesla and SpaceX and all that sort of stuff, but I don't know, I just feel like it's always hard to tell what people are going to do and what way the market's going to move. I'm surprised that he can still have such an effect on the market, uh, which is, I mean, only in the. I guess, in the short term.
00:03:43.532 - 00:04:14.234, Speaker A: So, I don't know. I. I wouldn't expect other bitcoin whales to really, I don't know, sell off because of that. I think that, you know, we've been seeing bitcoin sell off into ETH lately anyway, so I don't know if. If that's going to be a part of that. Right where we see this continued sell off, people. People buy ETH with their bitcoin or, you know, I listened to a podcast the other day on bankless with Suzu and Kyle Davies and Sue basically said that, you know, people are flying to their cold storage bunkers to unlock their bitcoin to trade it for ETH.
00:04:14.234 - 00:04:47.730, Speaker A: Now, you know, I don't know if he was just, like, saying that. I don't know, like, how much truth there is to that, but, I mean, that was happening before Elon's tweets. So I think that there's a lot more to it than just one person's kind of, like, tweets and signaling for these people to make moves with. With their money, and I, you know, I've always considered being bitcoin's energy kind of usage a really bad narrative for bitcoin, whether it's true or not that it uses too much energy or whatever. I don't necessarily think that matters. And I've spoken about this on the refuel, of course, but essentially what really matters is the. Is the narrative that takes hold.
00:04:47.730 - 00:05:02.022, Speaker A: Right. And what everyone else wants to kind of, like, believe about this sort of stuff. Um, so, yeah, hopefully that answers your question. I don't think there is a straight answer for it. I think that you have to consider the whole and. And how different rational actors will. Will act.
00:05:02.022 - 00:05:07.394, Speaker A: Um, but I'm. Yeah, I'm not sure if. If Elon's comments are going to influence that too much.
00:05:09.054 - 00:05:11.214, Speaker B: Yep. That's a great answer. Thank you.
00:05:11.374 - 00:05:21.594, Speaker A: No worries. I just noticed my camera died. Oh, there it is. Cool. Yeah. Feel. Anyone, feel free to ask anything or chime in, I guess, like, to what I was just talking about.
00:05:21.594 - 00:05:49.734, Speaker A: Maybe someone else has a different opinion to me. I'd love to hear other people's opinions on the energy use debate. I think that's, like, you know, pretty hot right now and definitely going to get hotter as time goes on. I've kind of, like, I guess, said that for a while that I thought that that would be something that it's going to be hard for bitcoin to defend against, but, yeah. Curious to hear anyone else's thoughts that have done deeper research into this.
00:05:55.494 - 00:06:44.058, Speaker B: I mean, I was asking about it because it seems like from Anthony Pompliano's, like, substack, he put out some, like, reassurance that the wallets, the, like, mid tier wallets are increasing. But he did mention that the, like, the super high net worth while it's, are decreasing. But I think you're right in that there is the effect of, you know, people just switching into ETH just for the. Riding the wave up on EIP 1559 and the merger. So you can't really differentiate between Elon's tweet and that effect. And so. Yeah, that's my thoughts.
00:06:44.186 - 00:07:03.082, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah, there's. There's so much going on, and there's so many. Yeah. Different reasons why people sell and what they sell into, um, you know, and. And what part of the cycle it is. I did see something about, like, you know, uh, large bitcoin wallets kind of getting, you know, reducing in size, but again, that could be because the price went up so much and.
00:07:03.082 - 00:07:40.930, Speaker A: Or they, you know, they could be trading it for ETH. I mean, ETH has had a pretty amazing price movement, especially on the ratio for, for quite a while now against bitcoin. So, yeah, it could be for a number of reasons. But I do think that Elon bringing, you know, more attention to the energy debate is, you know, it's accelerating. What I thought about, you know, what I thought was inevitable debate anyway. And it's, you know, bitcoiners are doing like a pretty good job of, of, you know, putting together information and trying to defend against this. But at the end of the day, I don't know how much luck, how much luck they're going to have because, you know, if you really think about it, climate change is pretty, pretty much, I think, the number one threat facing humanity.
00:07:40.930 - 00:08:43.108, Speaker A: Right? So, you know, whether people actually listen to, to other people's reasoning behind this or just take a hard approach and say, well, you know, if we can, you know, if we can reduce our energy consumption, then we should. And I know there's moral arguments about this and all that sort of stuff, but I guess for me, it really comes down to how complex it is to explain these things. It's really complex for bitcoin, is to explain to people things like, you know, how much energy is bitcoin using? How much is it of it is renewables? Does it actually encourage more renewable energy rather than something like Ethereum or Ethereum? People saying, well, we don't even have proof of work anymore. We have proof of stake, right? And we don't even use this energy anymore once that, once the merger happens. And that's just a much simpler thing to do than try to convince, you know, swathes of people. Like if you, if you look at what happened with the nfTs, and I don't know if some of you saw it on Twitter, there were literally, you know, thousands and thousands of thousands of people who were just like, you know, completely against nfts because of their energy use. And they, they didn't listen to reason.
00:08:43.108 - 00:09:29.948, Speaker A: A lot of their arguments were, you know, were pretty, pretty stupid, if I'm being honest. I saw a lot of them. But, but the thing is about, with a lot of this is that the narrative is always more powerful than the reality and the narrative of cryptocurrencies and the energy that they use, specifically bitcoin. Right. I know ethereum is, is, is pretty, pretty bad here as well, but that narrative is just so powerful. And I don't think any kind of, like, you know, debate is gonna, is gonna help with that in the long run, I just think that it's gonna be so hard to win that narrative wall. Feel free to, I guess, anyone else who wants to ask about anything, anything ethereum, anything.
00:09:29.948 - 00:09:39.584, Speaker A: Anything crypto, anything you're wondering about. Maybe you want some clarity on what happens with the merge or with 1559, all that sort of stuff, feel free to ask.
00:09:40.324 - 00:10:19.734, Speaker C: Do I have a question? But that's not related to the energy thingy. It's actually related to the fact that a lot of it, there's a lot of talk about institutions buying bitcoin, and then there's a lot of talk about institutions buying Ethereum, and mainly that they're on the sidelines. But is there a possibility that corporations and institutions are not interested in buying bitcoin or ethereum, that are going straight into maybe UCDC, the stable coin of, what's it called, Coinbase. So they're probably circumventing, buying bitcoin or Ethereum. They're inside the crypto ecosystem, but it has no effect on the price itself because they're into stablecoins and they just circumvented the ethereum, cryptocurrencies and others.
00:10:20.434 - 00:11:14.726, Speaker A: Yeah, I think definitely. But I think even if you look at how institutions play these things, I mean, there was a tweet the other day from Starney that said that they're working with some institutions in some private pool to intro them, to defy. So even if they are only playing in stable coins or buying USDC or whatever other stable coin it is to maybe, you know, yield farm, or maybe they want to, you know, basically use it as collateral and borrow against using these protocols or whatever. I still think the magic of Ethereum is that that's actually positive because that's adding more usage to the ethereum chain. And then post EIP 1559, it means that ETH is getting burnt every time these institutions, institutions make transactions, just like everyone else making a transaction. So in a roundabout way, it's actually good that they're buying stable coins anyway for ETH value. And I think that institutions are going to get a lot more use out of Ethereum than they will out of bitcoin.
00:11:14.726 - 00:12:27.358, Speaker A: And I was actually thinking about this the other day. What if institutions stockpile like ETH and have to buy ETH? Because they're like, well, we're doing all these transactions and we know that we have to pay, you know, fees to do so. So we need to buy some ethos, like operational expenditures, and then they buy the ETH, and then they use it and they burn it. So effectively, not only are they putting, you know, buy pressure on, on ETH because they need it for transaction fees, but they're also removing most of it from the, that they've bought from the supplier once they use it. So yeah, they can definitely skip, skip the assets, but the beauty of Ethereum post 1559 is that they have to use ETH anyway to pay fees and they have to contribute to ETH's economic value, which I think is pretty cool. And I guess like on that note too, now that I think about it, like, I actually think a lot of businesses will want to get into staking whether that be as a treasury kind of diversification, where they buy some ETH and they stake it as like what bankless likes to call the Internet bond and stuff like that, I do think that that can happen too. But yeah, institutions have just much more options with Ethereum, like with bitcoin, all they could do is pipe BTC and put it on their balance sheet.
00:12:27.358 - 00:12:53.914, Speaker A: And, you know, they're doing that for different reasons as they, as they, as for why they would buy ETH. Like, they're doing it as a, you know, they say they're doing it as an inflation hedge and a diversification strategy for their treasury. But I think buying, you know, buying ETH is, there's so many more reasons to buy it and to use it and to do whatever you want with it on the network. So from that perspective. Yeah, I just, I don't know. I think institutions coming to Ethereum is much more bullish than them doing stuff with bitcoin at the end of the day.
00:12:55.814 - 00:13:15.354, Speaker C: Do you also think that when the institutions finally come and they're buying their stablecoins, do you think that there will be a market for other stablecoins than the dollars, like for example, the australian dollar or the euro? Because there's a couple of pools and other projects that want to introduce non USD stable coins, but they're not really getting off the ground. It's like, there's not really a market for it just yet.
00:13:15.774 - 00:13:48.754, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that's something that obviously I really would love to happen, obviously, because I'm in Australia. I do think that's just a function of the size of the market right now. Very, very small. Like, I know that Ethereum has been growing like rapidly over the last few months, but in terms of the people using it, it's still very small. It's still very, I think, americanized. There are definitely people in Australia using it, and I know of a couple of projects working on non USD stable coins like handle finance and DVX or DFX, something like that I remember seeing on Twitter.
00:13:48.754 - 00:14:16.150, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, you know, if there's australian institutions and they want to play in. In Defi, well, then they're going to need an AOD stable coin. And, you know, I've spoken to the handle finance, one of the founders at handle finance, and he was saying the same thing. He's just like, yeah, this is just a pain point for these sorts of, you know, institutions or even individuals at the end of the day. So I think it's going to happen. But, you know, I think there are some euro stable coins right now that have some traction. Not.
00:14:16.150 - 00:14:36.404, Speaker A: Not really that much, but I think it's just a function of, like, liquidity begets liquidity. The USD stable coin was the first one, like, with tether, you know, things like that. So, yeah, I think that it'll happen over time. I'm just not sure how quickly. I would have figured it would happen quicker, to be honest. But maybe everyone's just fine holding USD right now.
00:14:40.944 - 00:14:48.744, Speaker D: So why can't they use something like Dai, which is just Ethereum based? So, like, Commonwealth bank, they couldn't like.
00:14:48.784 - 00:15:25.434, Speaker A: Set up a dive vaults or something, you know, as a backend to them, but to their front end users, just combine cap and they're getting 5%, 10%, whatever interest. I mean, they certainly could, but I would argue that there's still a lot of risks with a lot of this stuff. There's still a lot of things that can go wrong. Obviously, there's still liquidity issues. If you think about it, these banks have trillions of dollars collectively in deposits. And if they start moving that amount of capital in, you know, it might cause some kind of. Maybe not instability, but it will cause like, maybe.
00:15:25.434 - 00:15:56.390, Speaker A: Maybe die, goes off pay because they buy too much of it. Right. I think Dai has inherent risks where it can deep pretty, you know, quite easily depending on supply and demand dynamics and things like that. But yeah, long term, they're all going to play. I just think that we're not big enough for them yet to do that sort of stuff, considering how much capital they have under management. But, I mean, I would even think that they could just, like, they're not gonna do this, but they could just like, have a. Have a portal in where users can deposit their own funds in and do whatever they want.
00:15:56.390 - 00:16:19.730, Speaker A: I don't think they're gonna do that, and I don't think they need to do that because we have no nate crypto native or a theorem native, apps that do that. But, but yeah, I see that happening long term for sure. I mean, that's the whole point of defies to like, you know, replace the existing financial system. But we're still like so small. You know, total value locked is what, 80 billion right now. That is literally a rounding error for the traditional finance system like that. That means nothing to them.
00:16:19.730 - 00:16:49.946, Speaker A: You know, the volume on decentralized exchanges is really promising and things like that. But you know, still, for a global system, it can still be a lot higher and the liquidity can still be a lot higher. So I think once, once that happens, then institutions can start moving in in a bigger way. But, you know, as Stani said, they, they want private pools right now. They want to, you know, see how it all works. They want to see what the risks are before they quote unquote ape in, right into, into like public defi. So yeah, it's just going to take, take time, I think.
00:16:49.946 - 00:16:51.694, Speaker A: Still very early, obviously.
00:16:54.794 - 00:17:20.083, Speaker E: Just following up on that question with regard to euro stable coins, is there, is anyone, do you know the way maker are obviously the owners of Dai? Are they considering other assets like maybe like gold or something like this in the future, is it possible that something like maker would create a euro stablecoin or is that out of the realm of. It would need to be a different dow or something like this?
00:17:20.863 - 00:17:56.166, Speaker A: No, I think they can. It's just using the collateral to issue a different asset rather than Dai. Originally, a fun fact about maker was that they actually had plans to not peg to the US dollar and peg to a basket of currencies and just create like this stable coin that wasn't pegged to any one fiat currency. There's a, there's a particular name for it. It wasn't invented in crypto space for this basket of currencies. I can't remember what it was called exactly. But yeah, there was that plan back in the day and they did have, from memory, they'd have plans to issue non USD stable coins here.
00:17:56.166 - 00:18:21.690, Speaker A: But I think that the demand just isn't there yet from what I've seen. And. But, but there's no, from what I understand, there's nothing stopping maker from being able to issue other assets. And you, I mean you could even issue non stablecoin assets against the collateral, right. They're just synthetic assets at the end of the day. So you could, you could issue any synthetic that you wanted, just like how synthetix does it where you put up SNX collateral. You can issue SUSD and S E and S BTC and whatever else you want.
00:18:21.690 - 00:18:43.544, Speaker A: Right. It's the same for Maker, but I think with Maker, they've made Dai, like, the centerpiece, and they want to scale that up to as. As much as they can to generate, like, you know, lots and lots of revenue for the maker platform. But, yeah, I mean, I expect maybe sometime in the future they'll be able to introduce non, non USD die and, you know, do a die for, like, Euro or Aud or whatever else.
00:18:44.724 - 00:18:47.304, Speaker E: Perfect. Thanks. Awesome.
00:18:48.404 - 00:19:06.212, Speaker A: I've just been thinking about how much longer until you're gonna do the dance. Oh, man. The dance that's gonna follow me forever. I don't know. I just. I keep putting it off, right. You know, I think to myself, if I do this and I put it out there, it's on the Internet forever.
00:19:06.212 - 00:19:14.668, Speaker A: You know, I should do it eventually. I will do. I should say, I will do it eventually, but you should do it on.
00:19:14.676 - 00:19:17.620, Speaker D: The flippening when the flipping happens, then you do it.
00:19:17.732 - 00:19:28.156, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I feel like the flipping is a bit. Is a bigger event than ETH reaching its old all time high. That was the original promise. You know, that's so, so long ago now. Now that I'm thinking about it, 1420 and we're at 4k.
00:19:28.156 - 00:19:35.594, Speaker A: Like, it's such a funny thing, but. But, yeah, the flippening. I mean, I think we're all going to be dancing when the flippening happens.
00:19:37.894 - 00:19:39.074, Speaker D: Yeah, big time.
00:19:40.334 - 00:20:05.502, Speaker A: Now, on that note, I guess, like, I can. I mean, I can give some thoughts I've been having lately about the flippening and. And what it means for, like, the space overall. Uh, I think it's. It's funny because it's been this thing that's been talked about since, like, 2017. All right? The first run up of ETH, like, everyone was talking about it back then. It got really close, and then it didn't happen, and then ETH went into a really, really, really brutal bear market, as we all know, from 2018 and 2019.
00:20:05.502 - 00:20:32.560, Speaker A: But in terms of, like, what it means for the space, I don't. I don't hate bitcoin, but I think it's just so limited, right? Like, digital gold. Like, how many people actually care about that or get. Get use out of it. Like, I understand that holding bitcoin, you know, gives you access to this, like, non state affiliated money, you know, self sovereign money and self self sovereign monetary system. But to me, ethereum affords you the same kind of guarantees with ETH. Right? Ethereum to me, is just as decentralized as bitcoin.
00:20:32.560 - 00:21:03.100, Speaker A: And obviously it's evolving and moving and going through big upgrades, but these are upgrades that were kind of like part of the social contract. Proof of stake has been around for a while as an idea since basically the day ethereum was announced. Like, Vitalik was thinking about it. Same with sharding and L2 as well. I mean, Defi was even in the white paper. Like, it wasn't called Defi, but Vitalik was alluding to, you know, financial applications on, on blockchain. So from, from that point of view, I don't know, I just think that the flipping will be extremely healthy for the ecosystem.
00:21:03.100 - 00:21:37.030, Speaker A: I don't think it'd be very healthy for bitcoin, though. And I said this today on the bankless live stream I did with David Hoffman. Uh, what happens when bitcoin's number two? Like, what keeps it at number two? Like, why can't it just keep dropping from that? Why can't it drop out of the top ten? Like, the, the whole value prop of bitcoin is that it's number one. You know, it's the hardest money, it's the soundest money, it's the thing that everyone wants. You, you know, to, you stack sats, whatever, but when it loses its number one spot, all those narratives go out the window. So I think that's why the flipping is going to be such a big deal, is that it kills a lot of these, these narratives for bitcoin. And I know, I mean, I don't blame bitcoin is for.
00:21:37.030 - 00:22:20.036, Speaker A: For what they're, what they're doing lately with it, you know, how hard they're coping, because it really is, in my view, an existential threat to, to bitcoin's kind of, um, you know, over overarching goal because the digital gold niche, and I call it a niche because it is a niche, um, it's got very small tam, like, total addressable market. Ethereum has. It's not even ETH, the asset, but Ethereum, the network, the tam is the entire population of Earth and, you know, other planets eventually, right? So from that point of view, I just don't see how ethereum doesn't flip. And that's been my theory the whole time, is that utility over belief. And, you know, Ethereum has belief and ETH has belief as an asset in it, too. But the Ethereum network works to back up all that utility. So, yeah, I don't know, I don't know if anyone else has a different opinion there.
00:22:20.036 - 00:22:57.824, Speaker A: But to me, the flipping would be the healthiest thing that could ever happen to this ecosystem. And I think the ecosystem would actually go from being like a, you know, a joke to a lot of the outside world, to not that, because I've seen multiple threads on Reddit where people were saying, you know, they don't understand why bitcoin is valuable, why would they should care about digital gold? But, but they actually have found Ethereum, and talking about Ethereum, and like, I could see, you know, that they say they could see applications for, like, Defi and, you know, human coordination, like with daos and things like that. So I think from that point of view, I mean, it's just utility is worth more to people than, you know, digital gold. It's. And I think that's just going to remain that way forever.
00:22:59.964 - 00:23:00.704, Speaker E: Agree.
00:23:02.484 - 00:23:19.324, Speaker A: I'm curious if anyone else has, like, other thoughts on that. I know that we're all Ethereum people here, maybe not ETH maxis, but definitely people interested in Ethereum, but I'm always curious to hear thoughts against that. Like, I haven't come across anyone who's been able to convince me that bitcoin being number two isn't a catastrophic thing for bitcoin.
00:23:24.104 - 00:23:53.544, Speaker E: Yeah, it's just a random chit chat. But, like, if Ethereum does flip bitcoin, like, this is all speculation. Of course, if Ethereum does flip bitcoin, people have been saying, what's, what's the stop dodge from next flipping BTC? And I completely agree because, zero, I just can't do anything with it. And what you said about does anyone, and, you know, the younger generation collect gold? No, there's just been no use for it whatsoever. So utility, I think I completely agree with you exactly.
00:23:53.584 - 00:24:25.092, Speaker A: And that's my, my entire kind of view. Yeah. Especially with younger people, is that none of them really, I mean, most of them, I shouldn't say none of them, but most of them don't really resonate with, with, with the digital gold thesis, I believe. I think that they resonate with the utility of the ethereum network much more because, I mean, the utility isn't just one thing either. It's not like we have, you know, some sort of kind of like little Defi thing happening here. No, Defi is like, you know, broad in itself. And then we also have everything else happening, nfts and dows and, and all the other good stuff that's, that, that we haven't even thought of yet.
00:24:25.092 - 00:24:49.300, Speaker A: So I don't know. For me, like, ethereum is, is the infinity network, right. I've written about this before. It's just like, you can do anything you want on it, and it's like, you know, and someone on Twitter, some of you might know, antiprosynthesis, uses this comparison a lot. But he basically says bitcoin is a calculator, and ethereum is a general purpose computer, right. Bitcoin is really good at being a calculator, but ethereum is general purpose, which is a superset of that. So ethereum has a calculator, right.
00:24:49.300 - 00:24:56.504, Speaker A: Does everything bitcoin can do, but it does, like, you know, so much more. So, yeah, that's always been kind of like the thesis, I think.
00:24:59.544 - 00:25:03.040, Speaker D: I've got a question. Do you hear me?
00:25:03.112 - 00:25:07.216, Speaker A: Yes, yeah, I hear you. Basically, the other day, I bought something.
00:25:07.320 - 00:25:24.404, Speaker D: With my metamask wallet, and so I paid the normal fees, but then a friend of mine bought the same thing with binance, and he only paid like $1. So I just wanted to know why binance have this system and Ethereum cannot replicate.
00:25:24.854 - 00:25:35.914, Speaker A: Do you mean the trading fee or the gas fees? Because. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, he bought it on binance smart chain, I'm assuming. Not binance, the exchange.
00:25:37.494 - 00:25:38.454, Speaker D: Yeah, probably.
00:25:38.534 - 00:26:06.704, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm assuming. Cuz, like, so I guess I'm not sure how familiar you are with, with kind of like binance smart chain and its differences to a theorem, but I can essentially give the rundown. So, um, binance smart channel BSc, as it's known, is, is a fork of Ethereum. It is a complete copy clone of Ethereum. It uses the exact same underlying technology. Um, it does everything the same. Like, if you go to BSc, scan, I mean, it's a clone of Etherscan.
00:26:06.704 - 00:26:37.310, Speaker A: Um, you know, metamask works with it and everything like that. And, and the experience is very similar because of, of that. Now, the key difference is that binance smart chain is, is centralized. It is not a decentralized blockchain. It does not have proof of work or proof of proof of stakeholder. It has 21 validators that, you know, are all basically controlled by binance, and they basically validate blocks on the, on the chain. Now, because you've only got these 21 validators, and you don't have a massive kind of like, decentralized network with thousands of different nodes.
00:26:37.310 - 00:27:15.938, Speaker A: You don't have to essentially worry too much about things like the block size. So, the block size on Ethereum is called the gas limit. The gas limit on Ethereum right now is 15 million. So if it's essentially a cap on how many transactions can be in a block. And with BSC, their gas limit, the last time I checked, was 60 million. So already they have over three x the capacity, but they've also lowered the block time. So with ethereum, the block time is 13 seconds, and the block time needs to be, you know, it can't be too low, because then what ends up happening is that the whole network can't validate the blocks in time, and you risk a chain split, because every time a block is produced, it needs to be validated by all nodes.
00:27:15.938 - 00:27:53.554, Speaker A: And if, if it's too short of time, like, if it's, like, you know, say it's, it's on BSc, it's 3 seconds. But if it was 3 seconds on ethereum, you would have the instability of the chain, because there, there would be more frequent kind of chain splits due to the nodes not being able to keep up with each other, so. And as I said, the final thing. BSc lowered their block times to 3 seconds here, which, which essentially means that they can do 60 million gas, gas limit every 3 seconds instead of Ethereum's 15 million gas every 13 seconds. So essentially, it's much more than a three x upgrade. It's, it's it's, it's it's huge. If I did the math in my head, it'd be over ten x easily.
00:27:53.554 - 00:28:10.494, Speaker A: Um, and that's why the fees are lower, not because they've invented some new way to do something and some new technology. They've just taken Ethereum, ripped out its decentralization, and, and called it scalable. That that is, I guess, like, as concise as I can put it. Let me know if any of that needs further explanation.
00:28:11.154 - 00:28:13.010, Speaker D: No, that's fine. Thank you.
00:28:13.122 - 00:28:47.638, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah, it's kind of, I guess, like a big debate within the community and things like that, like whether people actually care about decentralization or anything like that. My view on BSC kind of, like, evolved over time. Originally, I really hated it. I really hated the marketing around it, and I really thought it was a negative for the ecosystem because it just kind of tricked people into thinking they were using a decentralized platform when they weren't. But then I learned to love it because it actually gives people a a cheap onboarding experience, or Ethereum like, onboarding experience, because they downloaded metamask. They use BSc scan, which is, as I said, a clone of ether scan.
00:28:47.638 - 00:29:26.584, Speaker A: They use, you know, pancakeswap, which is essentially a clone of uniswap, and they get to do all that really cheaply. And then once Ethereum, you know, scales via L2, and we get there and we get these kind of like, apps live and everything like that. We get these bridges in. These users who may have never used, you know, defi before or Ethereum before now have a very quick and easy way to do that because they have metamask already installed and they're already used to the experience of BSC. So they can just come over to, to Ethereum and enjoy those kind of low fees there. So I actually think, I mean, the price is fine for ETH as well, so it's not like BSC has been bearish. I actually think BSc, ironically, has been pretty bullish for, for Ethereum in general.
00:29:26.584 - 00:30:16.232, Speaker A: I don't know if anyone else has a different, different thought on that. I thought, I don't know, it's just, it's just funny watching it kind of play out over the last few months and seeing, I mean, I saw some people say it just shows how much demand there is to use aetherium. I kind of buy that. But at the same time, I think it shows that there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines that, you know, couldn't use this technology or just wouldn't because they didn't know about it. I think binance is a great, you know, funnel for, for BSC, obviously have, they have a direct bridge and everything like that. But then again, I think it's just like a trojan horse and these people are going to use a theory, and once we get more scaling solutions out there and allow them to use just. I mean, at the end of the day, most of these people are just using, you know, the swappers, like the amms, like uniswap and stuff like that, that's what most of the network is doing.
00:30:16.232 - 00:30:43.616, Speaker A: So if we can offer that to people for really cheap, but with Ethereum security and decentralization, which we will be able to very, very soon, and we already can on things like loop ring. But I think the game really changes once Uniswap deploys on a L2. I think that's really going to be awesome to see how many new users flock. Flock in from that. Thank you. Awkward. Yeah.
00:30:43.616 - 00:30:48.364, Speaker A: Anyone else? I think. Sorry, a few new people join. Feel free to chime in at any time with a question.
00:30:50.944 - 00:30:51.878, Speaker B: Token.
00:30:52.056 - 00:30:53.294, Speaker D: Oops, sorry, gone.
00:30:55.194 - 00:30:55.754, Speaker B: Token.
00:30:55.794 - 00:30:56.042, Speaker A: When?
00:30:56.098 - 00:30:57.414, Speaker B: For the daily quake.
00:30:59.234 - 00:31:19.606, Speaker A: I don't think I'm gonna be doing a token. Sorry to disappoint everyone. I. Yeah, that's a whole can of worms I don't want to open. You know, I think you know, I think bankless doing it is fine. It's actually going to be really interesting to see how that plays out because it's just an experiment. But yeah, the Daily Gwei, I just want to keep, like, obviously, like free, like everything free.
00:31:19.606 - 00:31:24.434, Speaker A: But I also don't want to attach like a token to it. I don't know if there's a purpose, really, to it.
00:31:25.854 - 00:31:28.114, Speaker C: Will you at least nft your dance video?
00:31:28.734 - 00:31:34.674, Speaker A: I mean. Yeah, okay, I'll nft the dance video and people can bid on it if they want, and I'll donate the proceeds to charity for sure.
00:31:39.094 - 00:31:53.534, Speaker B: Do you have, are you bullish on a particular social coin or like one of those like, community coins or platforms that allow you to make community coins?
00:31:54.514 - 00:32:22.550, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been pretty critical of community coin social tokens in the past. I think a lot of them aren't going to do very well. I think a lot of them are misguided. I think a lot of them look like scams. But there has been a community that I have been made aware of, I think a couple months ago, and I've been loosely following, called friends with benefits. It's run by a few guy, a few people that I know, one of them, Cooper Turley, who's a good friend of mine, he's part of the core team. I think that can work.
00:32:22.550 - 00:33:01.202, Speaker A: I just. The token, like, I mean, I hold some of the token, but I wouldn't say like I'm holding it expecting it to go 100 x or whatever, or even like ten x or whatever, or it's, it like make me any money, to be honest. But I'm holding it for access to the, to the group. Because it's like you buy the token, you get access to the group and stuff like that. But I think, I think at the end of the day, the social tokens will just become like Dow tokens at the end. That's kind of like their function where they use this coordination tools, I guess. Like even the bankless token bank is like a social token, right? Where they've got a dao set up and people have these tokens and it's part of a media organization and you can vote on proposals and do all this sort of stuff, you know.
00:33:01.202 - 00:33:29.608, Speaker A: And there's other ways to do the social tokens. Like you can do like profit sharing with an individual where an individual can say, okay, well, you know, all of the money that I make, I'm going to share 10% with my community, and you can fund me like this way, or like, you know, invest in my, my startups that I do this way, and I've seen some people do that. I don't know, I think maybe that's really, really early still, so. Yeah, but the. Yeah, the only project in that space that I've been following loosely is being. It's one called friends with benefits. They got a pretty active discord.
00:33:29.608 - 00:33:37.924, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. I go in there sometimes and just browse around. But yeah, I think too early to tell. Kind of like how that, that whole kind of sector is going to shake out. I think.
00:33:39.864 - 00:33:40.924, Speaker B: That makes sense.
00:33:43.384 - 00:33:47.004, Speaker A: Jacob, I saw that you had a question before as well, if you wanted to chime in.
00:33:48.864 - 00:33:50.384, Speaker D: Yeah. Can you hear me well, man?
00:33:50.504 - 00:33:53.408, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. Cool, cool.
00:33:53.576 - 00:35:03.744, Speaker D: Well, firstly, thanks for organizing this, man, and for all the good content. So basically, I'm pretty new to crypto and yeah, I apologize if I asked like very basic questions and don't want to waste anyone's time, but. So I have a question about defi. There's so much information on it and there's so many different absent protocols and like, the information is like quite overwhelming, like, just to grasp it all. And so my question is, where would you say is a good starting point to get basic knowledge and something that's also low risk because people say that DeFi is getting involved in DeFi is higher risk than just holding ether. And also now ETH is outperforming DeFi generally, which is a bit discouraging to swap ETH for DeFi tokens.
00:35:04.164 - 00:35:04.476, Speaker A: So.
00:35:04.500 - 00:35:06.944, Speaker D: Just wanted to know your view on that, basically.
00:35:07.644 - 00:35:34.716, Speaker A: Yeah. So in terms of getting started with DeFi, I think bankless does the best work here. Like obviously the daily way, or maybe not obviously, but the daily way is definitely not for beginners, the content that I produce. And that's because I think bankless is really great at that. And I think the defiant and defy dad as well. So if you want to note those down, if you haven't come across them yet, Defy dad does a lot of tutorials on different DeFi applications. He's really, really great.
00:35:34.716 - 00:35:56.840, Speaker A: And he also has something called yield tv because he works at Zappa. So. And that has, there are a lot of really good videos as well. Bankless has, you know, a whole kind of media empire, essentially. They have like the newsletter and the YouTube and the podcast, but they have a really good guide called getting started with bankless. If you just google that, you'll be able to find that one. And it's got, it's, it's, it's super comprehensive.
00:35:56.840 - 00:36:36.292, Speaker A: It's it's basically, here's how you get started with, with Defi and, and go, go bankless, essentially. Uh, so those three would be the, the top kind of ones that I would pay attention to. Bankless, the defiant and Defi dad slash yield tv for beginner guides. Um, and in terms of, of risk, yes. I mean, Defi is, is definitely riskier than just holding the asset, of course. Like you can just hold ETH or defi tokens in cold storage or on a ledger or whatever, and it's, it's, it's, it's fine, it's safe, and, you know, uh, but as soon as you start putting your, you know, your tokens or ETH or whatever into defi protocols, then you expose yourself to smart contract risks. Because these smart contracts are written by humans.
00:36:36.292 - 00:36:57.818, Speaker A: Yes. A lot of them are audited and what's called formally verified, but there could still be bugs. And as we've seen this, there's plenty of defi kind of hacks out there. And that definitely is scary. Uh, you can, you know, there's, there's insurance protocols. You can take insurance out against it and things like that if you're, if you want to. But generally, you know, I think there's like a risk spectrum, essentially.
00:36:57.818 - 00:37:25.002, Speaker A: I would consider the safest Defi apps to be the biggest ones. Like Makerdao has been around for quite a while. All of their code is, is heavily audited, heavily formally verified, and their original system ran well for many years. And no hacks or exploits or whatever compound, same kind of situation there. Uniswap, Aave. These are like the top protocols, and I would consider them to be the least riskiest. There is still risk, but they're not as risky as some of these newer ones.
00:37:25.002 - 00:37:49.608, Speaker A: Yeah, and there's plenty of newer ones, right. Or what you can call like the long tail of defi apps that definitely have a lot more risk attached to them. So I wouldn't, like, put all my money into it. I. My strategy essentially is to kind of, I guess, like take my money and like, put it on like a few different apps to kind of spread my risk and take out some insurance on it. But at the end of the day, it depends how much money you're playing with. It depends on how much yield you want to generate.
00:37:49.608 - 00:38:16.004, Speaker A: Obviously, the riskier the, the protocol, the more yield you're going to get because there's going to be less people in that pool, you know, and that's why people kind of like, go into these things, because there's sometimes, like yield farming opportunities with. With token rewards and things like that. So, yeah, I would say that. Just understand the risks. Understand that there's a risk spectrum where the top defi apps are at the top. Uh, mainly in terms of, like, total value locked. I would say mainly because of the fact that they're been around for a while.
00:38:16.004 - 00:38:44.468, Speaker A: They're secure, they're extremely reputable. They've been audited by, you know, I think RV two was audited by five different, you know, independent auditors, auditing companies. And I'm pretty sure. I'm not. I'm not sure if RVV two was formally verified, but I know that maker has been formally verified, which is a way to. Essentially what formal verification does, is it allows you to have guarantees that the code that you have written will do what you told it to do. But in saying that, there's still possibility of bugs, no matter how many audits or whatever goes on.
00:38:44.468 - 00:39:20.172, Speaker A: But, you know, typically with, with security, the longer something has been secure, people think that, you know, the more, I guess, like, the more trustworthy it is, because they think, okay, well, if it hasn't been exploited by now, then there's lower chances of it being exploited. I don't really buy into that. I think that sometimes there are just things that people miss, even the smartest people in the world, and then one guy comes along one day and just kind of like, finds an exploit. Right. So definitely things are scary. But in saying that, and on top of the insurance protocols, the protocols themselves can actually make users whole. And we've seen this play out in the past where there was a yearn vault that got drained, I think.
00:39:20.172 - 00:39:43.470, Speaker A: And they were able to make users whole by essentially collateralizing the treasury's wifi tokens in maker, drawing Dai and paying that Dai. Sorry, kind of like yield farming with that daisy. And paying back users who had unstolen from. From the yield generator. I think that's how they did it. And there's other ways to do it. You know, Maker will print MKR tokens to cover any losses, not.
00:39:43.470 - 00:40:06.484, Speaker A: Not for users, but for, like, the protocol, Aave has a staking pool that acts as insurance. There's a few other protocols that have this as well. So there's, there's that aspect to it as too. So those, those are the kind of like, risks. And to answer your, your final question, unfortunately, don't give financial advice or investment advice, of course. But in terms of. Of just general how the market works, it ebbs and flows.
00:40:06.484 - 00:40:36.574, Speaker A: There's just cycles that play out. Sometimes ETH will be doing really well against DeFi. Sometimes DeFi will be doing really well against ETH. Sometimes, you know, bitcoin will be really doing really well against everything and then everything else will be bleeding against it. But this is essentially why it's very, very, very hard to outperform either the index of a market or the kind of like assets like BTC and ETH because of the fact that you have to, like, time yourselves. You have to time your entries. You, you have to basically, you know, deal with all the emotions that come with that, all the anxiety and stress and everything.
00:40:36.574 - 00:41:14.174, Speaker A: So, you know, as I said, I can't really give you any investment advice, but, you know, it's the same kind of thing. There's a spectrum of kind of risk you can take the, the riskier assets that you buy, you know, potentially higher upside, also potentially higher downside. So that's why a lot of people just like to stick with ETH because, you know, ETH captures value pretty well from the network and it will capture value even better with, with, with 1559 and proof of stake and all that sort of stuff. But yeah, generally it just works in cycles and it's very hard to outperform ETH and bitcoin. And it's very hard to outperform an index, too, especially for newer investors.
00:41:16.474 - 00:42:05.294, Speaker D: Cool, man. Thank you so much. It's a really helpful answer. I already follow bankless, but I'll check out the other two. Just another question. And that's just like trying to look into the future, you know, like bitcoin has had its time and it was totally dominant. And like, from, you know, from all the information out there, like, I really believe in Ethereum, but do you think like 1015 years ahead, you kind of accept the possibility that there might be other new chains that will create something that's, you know, outperforms Ethereum, you know, as an asset.
00:42:05.294 - 00:42:12.174, Speaker D: Do you look in the future and do you ever have these thoughts, like 1520 years ahead?
00:42:14.794 - 00:42:16.014, Speaker A: Sorry, go on.
00:42:16.794 - 00:42:19.054, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that was basically the question.
00:42:19.234 - 00:43:10.542, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, so it's funny because you can look at some of these other chains and you can see that they've outperformed ETH, right? But as I said, it is all based on risk and the amount of risk you want to take on and, you know, the way you invest because your chance of picking something or a chain that's going to outperform ETH, right, in the long run. And as I said, outperform ETH from the moment you buy it and the moment you sell it. And accounting for taxes mean depending where you are, right, the taxes can be quite high, you know, and because you, because you have to denominate in fear, you can't denominate in ETH. So if you trade your ETH for something and then you make a profit, right? Well, you have to account for taxes and then that eats into your profits and you're basically denominated in fiat. So ETH might be much higher. So you may have in, you may make a profit in fiat, but you might be down in ETH because of that as well.
00:43:10.542 - 00:44:02.646, Speaker A: So there's that sort of stuff to consider. But definitely, I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that just from a pure kind of investment perspective, there will be things that outperform ETH for sure. And then not just defy but other chains, tokens and things like that for one reason or another because they've got much smaller market caps too. I mean, ETH is a half a trillion dollar asset or almost these days, I think, you know, back depending on the price is any given day, you know, almost a half a trillion dollar asset, bitcoins a trillion dollars. It just takes a lot more money to move these things. That's why people love playing and investing in the smaller coins is because as I said, there's much higher, you know, potential for upside, for higher upside, but also the downside as well. And, and as I said, I think people overlook the fact that you need to time your entry and exit to, to and account for taxes and then, you know, see if you're net profitable at the end, especially if you're trading your, your ETH or even bitcoin for it.
00:44:02.646 - 00:44:49.490, Speaker A: So, but in terms of like, I mean even on the, on the other side of it, like platforms in the future that could, you know, get usage and kind of like be complementary to Ethereum or, or essentially like, you know, maybe, I don't know, overtake Ethereum if you want to go that far. I mean, it's always a possibility, it's always a risk. I'm a firm believer that technology needs to keep evolving over time to be valuable. That's why I think that bitcoin is going to get flipped because it just fails to evolve and it doesn't do it. It doesn't service enough people, hasn't evolved to service enough people and enough users. So, you know, if Ethereum stagnates and Ethereum is not filling users needs, then for sure other protocols and other chains can know, can gain on it and I think we already saw that happen with something like BSC. Even though it is centralized, it offered users something that Ethereum can't right now, and that's super low fees and.
00:44:49.490 - 00:44:59.562, Speaker A: And fast, faster transactions. Uh, so, yeah, we've already seen that play out, I think. And it's gonna. It's. It's very hard to tell what's going to happen 15 to 20 years from now. Uh, even, like, five years from now. It's.
00:44:59.562 - 00:45:24.038, Speaker A: It's basically impossible. My bet, obviously, is on Ethereum remaining dominant. Um, Ethereum is evolving at a rapid pace. There's still lots of development going on, but from an investment perspective, you know that you can play it any which way you want. It's whichever, which way you're comfortable with. And just as an example of. Of something, there was a chain that in 2017 called Aon that was at the time, everyone was really bullish on.
00:45:24.038 - 00:45:43.310, Speaker A: They're like, okay, it's an interoperability protocol. It's going to build bridges between different chains. It's going to be awesome, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, I had some aon. I traded my ETH for it back then, which I regret doing, because if you look at the a on ETH pair right now, it's. It's really bad. Like, it's basically down, like, something, like, over 95%.
00:45:43.310 - 00:45:57.758, Speaker A: And that's just one. There's other ones out there, too, that are. That are. That are down against Ethan. It's just been like, the. I think the newer protocols, like, I know Solana has. Has been pretty good against ETH lately in terms of performance and things like that, but it's just very hard to.
00:45:57.758 - 00:46:07.074, Speaker A: It's the same kind of thing with DeFi tokens. But maybe in the long run, some of these protocols can survive, but picking them is hard. Picking the winners is definitely. Is definitely hard.
00:46:08.314 - 00:46:36.584, Speaker D: Yeah, man. The intention of my question wasn't necessarily from an investment perspective, but more like understanding the future of crypto and how it can solve humanity's problems. Like, Ethereum obviously does so much, and if it replaces the financial system, it'd be absolutely awesome. The world's going to be such a better place, but, yeah, just. Yeah, man. Thanks for the answer.
00:46:37.044 - 00:47:07.456, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And, I mean, on that note, there's other. Yeah, definitely. Ethereum, like, I believe, is going to be the backbone for the. For the new financial system. And I do believe that there's other chains out there that will fill niches I'm particularly bullish on, like, the utility chains like filecoin and arweave. I don't own any of the tokens, and this isn't about the tokens, but in terms of what they can enable the, what's called perma web, where essentially you can have like permanent, you know, forever storage in a peer to peer network where people are incentivized to keep files and things like that.
00:47:07.456 - 00:47:39.184, Speaker A: I think that obviously serves a massive use because at the end of the day, we're trying to decentralize as much as we can, trying to get back to the original vision of what the Internet was supposed to be, which was a decentralized protocol. So, yeah, definitely keeping an eye on some of these other things, but they work to enhance Ethereum as well, I think. Awesome. Yeah. Anyone else? Feel free to chime in if you've got a. If you got a question about anything. Doesn't have to be ethereum related, can be crypto related.
00:47:39.184 - 00:48:12.524, Speaker A: I saw a couple people go off mute there. Maybe they didn't want to talk over each other. Oh, no.
00:48:16.944 - 00:48:20.644, Speaker E: Trying not to talk over someone who is attempting to ask a question.
00:48:22.784 - 00:48:26.444, Speaker A: I think it's fine. I think. Yeah, go ahead. If you had a question.
00:48:28.464 - 00:48:39.084, Speaker E: Just wondering if you're following anything on uniswap and the L2 possibilities. Very general. I don't follow too closely, but I'm very excited for it.
00:48:39.904 - 00:49:04.482, Speaker A: Yeah, they've been a bit quiet on that front. I mean, Hayden Adams put a tweet out the other day saying that we need L2 now or whatever, something along those lines. I can't remember exactly what, what the tweet was. And they have said that they were going to deploy to optimism shortly after they deployed v three. It's now been ten days since v three and we haven't heard anything about optimism. And, you know, from, I'm hearing from some people in the industry that, you know, optimism is not optimistic. As optimistic as.
00:49:04.482 - 00:49:41.266, Speaker A: Sorry, they're not as optimistic on it as. As they would like to be. There are other solutions out there, you know, and coming, and I think that it's good that we're not going to just rely on optimism like we have arbitrum, you know, ZK stink, Starkware and Polygon and all these sort of things. So I think what Uniswap needs to do is not be kind of like maximalist about it. They can deploy to optimism when it's ready. That's all well and good, but I think users are hungry right now. So in my opinion, Uniswap should deploy to everything that's ready today, whether, you know, that's Polygon arbitram is coming out with their devnet on 28 May, so Uniswap will be able to deploy on there.
00:49:41.266 - 00:50:00.634, Speaker A: And arbitrary uses, optimistic roll ups, similar technology to optimism as well. Starkware is going to bring out their generalized EVM L2 and cksync too. So, yeah, on that front, I just hope that Uniswap doesn't choose to go down the maximalism route and just go with optimism. I hope that they just deploy Uniswap to multiple L2s.
00:50:01.974 - 00:50:08.230, Speaker E: Very nice. You're advisor for Polygon team or. Sorry, the matic team, correct?
00:50:08.342 - 00:50:09.014, Speaker A: Yeah, that's correct.
00:50:09.054 - 00:50:09.714, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:50:10.294 - 00:50:17.274, Speaker E: And their L2 is. Is it tied in any way to finance or. No. Is it just separate things?
00:50:17.604 - 00:50:40.436, Speaker A: No, I mean, their, their whole platform. They originally did an iEo, an initial exchange offering on binance a long time ago for, for the tokens, but no, they're not tied to, to binance in any way in terms of like their actual platforms. And. Yeah, I mean, Polygon was known as Matic Network, you know, until up a few months ago. They did the rebrand, I think in January. So. But yeah, there.
00:50:40.436 - 00:50:42.424, Speaker A: I don't think there's any ties there right now.
00:50:43.104 - 00:50:44.324, Speaker E: Cheers. Thank you.
00:50:48.584 - 00:51:17.710, Speaker C: I had a question regarding the ad roping of governance tokens. For the first kind of add ups, you just had to all the Ethereum. Like for example with Omes ago, if you had Ethereum, you get these OMG tokens airdropped. Later on in 2020, they changed it to the second kind of adder where they had to use the Dapp in order to get an airdrop. Like with Uniswap, if you use DDAP, you get unit tokens. And what you're seeing now is that projects are ad robbing tokens to gitcoin donators. And this annoys me a little bit because you're basically buying funding in a win quick nudge nudge way.
00:51:17.710 - 00:51:34.954, Speaker C: There's no promise whatsoever for an ad Rob, but people will still donate in the hopes for an ad rope. So it's kind of iffy to me. And my question regarding this all to you is, what do you think is the future of ad rops? Or in other words, how do you see projects trying to add rope to the right users? Because that's what they're trying to do, essentially.
00:51:35.464 - 00:52:16.230, Speaker A: Yeah. This is something that I've been thinking about a fair bit lately, actually, and I'm glad you asked the question here. I think airdropping is a cat and mouse game, because once you do an airdrop, once in some way, it gets gamed the next way. I mean, we saw this play out after the Uniswap airdrop, where, you know, people were trying to game the one inch airdrop and one inch basically saw that and basically was able to get around that and things like that. But now, yes, definitely we're seeing it being gamed with the Gitcoin donors because there was an airdrop done to Gitcoin donors and people were like, well, I better just donate just in case because I could get an airdrop out of this. And there will be other protocols that airdrop to, to get coin donors. And I do think it muddies the waters there.
00:52:16.230 - 00:53:25.872, Speaker A: And unfortunately, you know, I don't think there's much gitcoin can do about this. There's no real way to prove it. I mean, if these users are legit and they're donating $1, for example, I mean, that's the same as just a normal user donating $1, you know, to a project. But I guess on that note, the future of airdrops, I don't know, to be honest, I think there's still a lot of experimentation that can happen here, but it always results in this cat and mouse game where once you do an airdrop in some way, it's just going to end up getting gamed for another project. So I think that the future might have, might just be like, you know, essentially something got to do with maybe a hybrid of like liquidity mining slash airdrop where you, you do work for the protocol, you know, in some sort of, sort of way, whether that be with your capital or, or you do work with like actual work, not just with your mining to liquidity mine. I actually think airdrops in general aren't the greatest way to distribute tokens anyway. And a perfect example of this is a project that I'm pretty close to called index co op, where they only airdropped 1% of tokens to, of index tokens when they launched back in September to DPI holders.
00:53:25.872 - 00:54:14.606, Speaker A: And there had only been like two months worth of DPI lifetime. So there wasn't that many holders, but 1% isn't very much right. And they kept most of the supply in the treasury. And what they have been doing over time is they've been rewarding these index tokens to actual contributors that have done things for, for the index co op, which is, which is essentially a Dow, whether that be, you know, creating content, doing work like business development, you know, any sorts of things like develop, doing Dev work, hosting community calls, whatever. I think that's a better way of doing it because what ends up happening is you get tokens into the hands of the right people, the ones that actually are a part of the Dow. They've done the work, aren't just parasitic and haven't just been, you know, just given you a donation or used your app once and now expecting some free money. So I actually think that's the best model.
00:54:14.606 - 00:55:09.418, Speaker A: And their community is extremely vibrant. I mean, I encourage anyone who is interested in getting involved with a Dow or a community, particularly in DeFi, to check out the index car, because what they've created by harnessing these, these really good incentive mechanisms through, through contributor rewards is that they've got a massive group of people now who are pretty autonomous, actually. It's actually a true dao where these people go out, they do work, and then they come together and index token holders can vote on proposals to pay out these contributors each, I think it's each month the cadence that they do it on. So I do think that airdrops, there's really not much of a future for them. I think the future is distributing tokens in a much more, much fairer and I guess, like, much better way. Hopefully that, that answers the question. Right.
00:55:09.466 - 00:55:12.690, Speaker F: Okay. Okay. So, um. Hello, Anthony.
00:55:12.802 - 00:55:13.090, Speaker A: Hey.
00:55:13.122 - 00:55:24.294, Speaker F: Hello. Okay, so my question is that then what kind of dao do you actually recommend? Defi beginner to start, actually.
00:55:24.714 - 00:55:25.666, Speaker D: Mm hmm.
00:55:25.850 - 00:56:26.496, Speaker A: Yeah. It's, I mean, it depends, I guess, what you're interested in as well as kind of like, you know, what, what dow you want to join? You know, what, what work you're interested in doing. Do you want to join early stage Dow or a let or a later stage one? You know, what, what is your skill set sort of thing? I think from what I've seen, you know, I, the index co op is pretty good. Like it's been around for a few months now, but they're pretty good at onboarding new people. And as long as you are bringing value, they're pretty good at getting you on board and getting, and finding you work to do or, you know, you can find work to do yourself as well and getting kind of like paid contributor rewards for doing this. But there's so many of these daos now, whether that be like, you know, big projects like Makerdao or RV and Synthetix, like, they might be too big. There's a lot, you know, to get, I guess, like, involved in those ecosystems might be a bit harder because you need to build up your reputation, you know, and it takes a bit longer to do that with the bigger projects, but there's plenty of new DeFi projects that are, that are launching dow first out there and to find them.
00:56:26.496 - 00:56:50.096, Speaker A: I mean, I cover a lot of them with the daily Gwey on the YouTube videos. You know, I sometimes post them in the alpha leaks channel and things like that. But, you know, there's a lot of earlier stage projects out there which you can get involved in. And there's, I mean, in terms of finding them, you know, I mean, the same resources, bankless will cover them. And you can go to Defi pulse. They've got something called the Defi list. I think it's linked at the top of the website to find these projects.
00:56:50.096 - 00:57:15.170, Speaker A: And you can kind of know if this, they're small still. You can just look at the discord and see how many members they have and how active it is to see if they're still small and if that's something you want to be a part of, then, yeah, you can just simply, just start talking. You don't even have to do a resume or anything or apply. You can just start talking to people going on the forum, seeing how you can contribute and get started like that. There really is no barrier to entry in a lot of these daos. You know, you can be anyone. You can be, you can be a dog.
00:57:15.170 - 00:57:20.094, Speaker A: It doesn't matter, right? You can just, you can, you can contribute to these daos.
00:57:21.834 - 00:57:27.530, Speaker F: Okay, so it's basically, just don't be embarrassed or maybe limited by your skillset, isn't it?
00:57:27.682 - 00:57:52.380, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. Essentially, you're only limited by your imagination and skill set of like, you know, you can do whatever you want. You just have to, you know, show the, the dao that you can contribute, but your contributes, your contributions are valuable and add value to the dow. And, and there, that's your, that's your in, essentially. And I've seen people come and do this over time where they, they do work. First they come and present it to the dow, and then they get, you know, get to know the community, they get more involved. And then, you know, you build up your social score.
00:57:52.380 - 00:58:22.266, Speaker A: It's like any kind of like, group in general, like any social group or any company, you build up your social capital over time and you become more entrenched over time as well, depending on how long you spend in the ecosystem. And then people get to know you and you become a regular. Like, it's all humans at the end of the day. So I think viewing it like that, I think is the proper approach. Awesome. Thanks for the question. All right, coming up on the hour mark here, we can keep.
00:58:22.266 - 00:58:44.994, Speaker A: We can keep going. If people have more questions, I'm happy to keep going for a little while here, or if you don't have questions, anything you want me to talk about or give just general views on, I'm happy to do that, too.
00:58:49.374 - 00:58:50.234, Speaker E: I just.
00:58:51.374 - 00:58:52.878, Speaker D: Yeah, one guy asked a question.
00:58:52.966 - 00:58:58.754, Speaker A: Maybe you couldn't hear him. Oh, okay. Maybe I. Yeah, sorry. Whoever that was. Yeah, I didn't hear that.
00:59:04.474 - 00:59:07.374, Speaker B: It's shabbouk.
00:59:10.234 - 00:59:14.906, Speaker A: Okay, go ahead. Can you hear me now? Yeah, I can hear you now.
00:59:14.930 - 00:59:16.654, Speaker F: Yeah. Good.
00:59:17.354 - 00:59:47.994, Speaker B: I wanted to know about how you saw risks coming up to 1559 and particularly with the merge. You've talked about a few things related to miners, things they can do, but I mean, do you see any really bad risks, things that are sort of existential or do you see just maybe we'll have a few technical issues that get resolved, you know, part by part over a week, but just curious how you see risks coming up with both of those events. Thanks.
00:59:48.494 - 01:00:16.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't see any technical risk with 1559. Some of you may not know this, but it's actually been live on other networks like filecoin, and I think Nia has it as well. So the actual implementation works. It's been live on testnets and so the technical implementation works. It does what we want it to do, and everything's kind of fine there. So I don't think there's any technical risks and I don't think there's any risks of miners revolting either. They tried that and their punishment was that we sped up the merge.
01:00:16.750 - 01:00:49.078, Speaker A: Right. So I think that they're not going to try any more funny business from now on because of that. But the merge definitely is a much bigger kind of thing than 1559 because the way I like to think about the merge is it's basically replacing an engine in an airplane while the airplane is flying. So you're basically doing a hot swap of an engine of an airborne plane. So when you think about it like that, and then you relate it back to what the merge actually is, it's essentially hot swapping proof of work for proof of stake. So. And that's a big deal.
01:00:49.078 - 01:01:37.076, Speaker A: Right. Because leading up to the merge, there has to be an incentive for miners to keep mining the network, right. Inevitably, some will fall off because they'll basically go to other chains and they want to beat other miners to other chains so that they, you know, get the, get the profits first and things like that, and then there was a post from Vitalik I think, maybe a few weeks ago about, you know, how we can, you know, make sure that miners keep mining the last block that we need them to, you know, until the merge is done, I think generally, I mean, the incentive is just to do that. I think. I think, and sorry, from Vitalik's post, I think from memory he said that as long as like one miner was doing it, it would be fine. As long as that block gets produced or at least one mining pool. And I do think there are some mining pools that are, that are a theorem aligned anyway, or at least like not hostile.
01:01:37.076 - 01:02:08.868, Speaker A: So they'll just keep doing it anyway. So I don't think there's actually any, any technical, sorry, any risk of like minor revolt there either. But technical risk is definitely, is definitely a thing. You know, we've had the merge running on testnets and it works. We know it works, but because it's such a big thing and because it's basically trying to essentially merge a $500 billion network into, into a brand new consensus mechanism that's only been live by the time the merge happens, it'll have been live for probably twelve or so months. It's a big deal. Right.
01:02:08.868 - 01:02:46.170, Speaker A: And I think honestly, you know, the technical risk as time goes on gets less and less. We saw that there was a bug on the ETH, two main net with the prism client, which was a very rare bug, that there was a super rare edge case and it was quickly patched, so, and, but other than that, the vegan chain has been running very smoothly. So if we can just do this, this, this clean kind of changeover to proof of stake, then I think it's going to be fine. I don't foresee too much technical risk there either. And the developers and researchers are going to test this extensively. They're not going to go ahead with this if, unless they are confident. We saw this play out with the beacon chain, main net, they didn't rush it.
01:02:46.170 - 01:03:07.680, Speaker A: Right. There was multiple delays. There was never an official date given, but there was multiple kind of delays where people are expecting it to come out at this time, but it wasn't. And that's because the developers and researchers were not confident in launching it until they did. And that's the same thing that's going to happen with the merge. We all want the merge as fast as possible, believe me. The devs want it faster than all of us and the researchers want it faster than all of us.
01:03:07.680 - 01:03:23.850, Speaker A: But until they're confident that it can go and work without a hitch. And that they've covered all their bases. It's not going to happen. So. And from that point of view, I wouldn't expect there to be much risk at all with that because they know how, how serious it is and how big of a deal it is. And you know, once it happens, it's done. That's it.
01:03:23.850 - 01:03:27.214, Speaker A: There's no need to worry about miners anymore, which I think is pretty cool.
01:03:29.914 - 01:03:31.538, Speaker B: That's great. Thank you.
01:03:31.706 - 01:03:32.574, Speaker A: All good.
01:03:36.154 - 01:04:05.024, Speaker F: Okay, Anthony, so there's one more question that spring up in my mind then actually what's the mentality to be high of the devs that really want to launch their, with their protocol? Because like launching on down, this means they're releasing their, their hard work, that leasing their control of the, of their hard work with a bunch of strangers basically. Right. So actually what's the incentive that make them do that?
01:04:05.684 - 01:04:33.564, Speaker A: So there's a few different motivations here and there's actually hybrid approaches too. So maybe I can, I can talk about the motivations then go into the hybrid approaches. So motivation one is you want to decentralize the protocol. The, the Defi developers, their whole point is to not have control over it, right. For a number of reasons, one reason being regulatory. Right. It's very hard, if not impossible to regulate a dao that doesn't answer to any one jurisdiction.
01:04:33.564 - 01:05:03.326, Speaker A: If you have a sufficient level of token holders or amount of token holders. Sorry, that means you've got sufficient decentralization. So it's very hard for any regulators to go after that. You know, as I said, you want to decentralize it because you believe that this stuff needs to be decentralized. A lot of the time they want to have a token too. Like that's how, you know, I guess, like, to be honest, that's how like investors get a return on their investment. That's how the team kind of like makes money as well, is from, from these token sorts of things.
01:05:03.326 - 01:05:41.132, Speaker A: And tokens can act very positively to coordinate both capital and governance through the Dow as well. But in terms of the hybrid approaches that I was talking about, you can do a dao but still have control over it because your protocol is very new. So for example, the index co op is a dao where the token holders vote and everything that happens, but the actual changes happen via a multi sig. So the set team that launched the index co op, they have a multi sig. And whenever the community votes for something, they basically push that transaction or enact that on chain for the Dow. This happens for Mstable. As well.
01:05:41.132 - 01:06:24.830, Speaker A: Another project I'm involved in, this happens for a number of projects still, like Synthetix still has admin keys, even though they are a Dow and things like that. So actually maybe they gave it up later. They have, they have a funny structure. Synthetics have like three different dowels, but, but essentially, yeah, you don't have to seed control straight away. And it's, I think the admin key thing is not so that they can keep control, so that they can upgrade the protocol and cleanly as well, like technical upgrades, uh, and things like that too, because, um, you know, some teams don't want to have to relaunch the whole protocol from scratch, like what Uniswap does. Uniswap doesn't have any admin key, so every time they launch a new version, they have to relaunch the entire thing and then all the capital has to migrate over. That becomes, you know, a bit difficult.
01:06:24.830 - 01:07:10.350, Speaker A: Same thing happened with Aave. Uh, but you know, there's, there's other teams that are just happy, you know, having this kind of control for the short to medium term, upgrade the system, keep building it out, and then, you know, slowly kind of like see control over to token holders in an on chain way where, for example, Makerdao is a full DaO. Like all of the stuff happens on chain from maker MKR token holders. And there's a few other projects out there that do this, like compound as well. But for the earlier stage projects, they'll definitely do a hybrid approach, which I think is, is fine. But, yeah, motivations are the same for every project, like token for, for a variety of reasons, right? For coordinating capital, return on investment for investors and team and stuff like that. You also have decentralization because that's the ethos of the space.
01:07:10.350 - 01:07:37.124, Speaker A: Right. And dows can also attract a bunch of new people to work for, I guess, like your protocol, that you wouldn't have been able to attract normally because of, you know, you were just a centralized company. Maybe you couldn't even hire these people because they were in different jurisdictions or whatever, whereas a dow, everyone can work for a dow. There is no kind of like, there's no sanctions, there's no, you know, legal regulatory stuff to worry about. It doesn't discriminate. So. Yeah, I hope that answers your question.
01:07:37.124 - 01:07:40.920, Speaker A: Oh, great.
01:07:40.952 - 01:07:42.164, Speaker F: Yes, thanks, Anthony.
01:07:42.544 - 01:07:58.490, Speaker A: All good. Cool. Anyone else? Maybe I'm not hearing anyone else. Uh, I don't know what was happening there before, man.
01:07:58.522 - 01:09:01.694, Speaker D: I have another question, so I'm just trying to look at the big picture and obviously, crypto is still relatively small and not many people know about it. And people are talking about a huge transfer of wealth to the crypto people. And obviously, that wealth is partly gonna be transferred from, from very rich, currently very rich people. And those people own a lot of assets that are going to be devalued. Do you see any risk that there's going to be huge forces threatening the crypto world on the government level or just on any other levels? Because people, obviously, that are going to lose their wealth are going to be really, really unhappy. So just like, as a whole, do you have any view on this subject?
01:09:02.434 - 01:09:59.517, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, oops, excuse me, for sure. I think I have, like a, I think it's a complex topic, right. And I think overall, it can be answered by basically going through the game theory of the situation, right? This, because this system is global because it runs on the Internet to shut it down or to fight back against it. By doing so, you cripple yourself because, say, you're a country or a nation state, and you say, okay, well, we're going to ban this from happening. Something got to do with crypto, or we're just going to ban crypto. Well, all these other countries and nation states aren't banning crypto, so they're just going to, you know, continue on building out, you know, crypto infrastructure, building out the future, future of finance, whatever, and then you're going to be left behind. So I think the game theory holds that it's actually a hindrance for, for any of these nation states to ban it and to kind of, like, come down on it or regulate it too heavily, because that means that their own country and their own economy will suffer.
01:09:59.517 - 01:10:39.266, Speaker A: So, yes, these things will, will challenge, you know, people's wealth. It will challenge existing systems, it will disrupt a lot of existing systems, but I think it will play out in the same way the Internet did, where by not embracing the Internet, you basically fall behind. Like, there's tons and tons of companies that were essentially, you know, completely destroyed by the Internet because they didn't embrace it and nation states didn't really ban it. You know, China, with their own way of controlling it, they, they basically created their own Internet. Maybe they can create their own kind of blockchain. You know, they have this CBDC stuff. But fundamentally, in, in most of the world, you know, we all use the same Internet, right? We all, we all kind of, like, you know, can access the same sites.
01:10:39.266 - 01:11:15.984, Speaker A: And even if the sites get blocked, there are ways around it. Like, you know, in Australia, they sometimes block sites that they blocked four chan once. You know, it was like a DNS block, so you could just get around it very easily and sorts of things like that. So, you know, there are, there are defi apps already that have to block certain jurisdictions. Like for example, you know, you can't even use DyDX in the US. But the thing is, is that you can either use a VPN to get around that or you can use the smart contracts directly to get around that, or you can use another interface that isn't the DoiDX official front end. So, you know, from that point of view, it's just going to be very hard to control or regulate any of this.
01:11:15.984 - 01:11:59.838, Speaker A: And, you know, in terms of like wealth transfer, that's a basically impossible thing to control because you'd essentially have to get like every government to agree to like, you know, either ban purchases of crypto for say, non accredited investors or something like that. Or you'd have to just join in. And really the, the only way is to join in. And that's why we're seeing a lot of institutions adopting this now. But that actually further kind of legitimizes the entire ecosystem and further, you know, increases the, the wealth distribution or redistribution because typically younger people or at least younger investors and people who, who are into technology are the first adopters of these things. And then you have like the older people who are, you know, more conservative. They're not like into risk taking.
01:11:59.838 - 01:12:33.784, Speaker A: They're the ones that are buying it through an ETF or something like that. And, you know, a bitcoin ETF in the US hasn't been approved at this stage. And maybe it comes this year, but that's like into, you know, ten, 1112 years into bitcoin's life. So all that upside that the early adopters got, essentially, you know, the later adopters aren't going to get that anymore. And that's where that, that wealth distribution comes from. So I just generally think that there's no way to stop this or control it or regulate it. It is literally, you know, unstoppable, you know, for the most part, I believe.
01:12:37.804 - 01:12:39.304, Speaker D: Makes a lot of sense, actually.
01:12:39.644 - 01:12:51.784, Speaker A: Cheers. No worries. A few other people that joined, few newer people, if you had any questions you wanted to ask, feel free to ask them anything. Crypto, ethereum, whatever.
01:13:02.224 - 01:13:24.484, Speaker E: Just a very generic question at this point in this stage to prevent oneself from selling one's ethereum and like to lock it up in validator nodes. What are your thoughts on this? I mean, I currently run one validator but I'd be interested in looking at furthers. What do people think in general, but potentially running more than one validator?
01:13:25.164 - 01:13:25.708, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
01:13:25.756 - 01:13:26.504, Speaker D: Mm hmm.
01:13:27.004 - 01:13:43.220, Speaker A: It's. It's funny because I think it depends on, like, every individual situation. Right. If you. If you don't plan to. To sell your ETH anytime soon anyway, then to me, it's like a no brainer to just stake it unless you're using it for something else. Like, if you're using it in defi, then obviously it's.
01:13:43.220 - 01:14:04.944, Speaker A: It's. It's caught up or tied up there. But if you are just, if it's just in cold storage and you're happy taking on a little bit more risk, like, it's really a tiny bit more risk, and you're happy running validators or whatever, then, yeah, it makes sense to stake it, to stack some more ETH, and then obviously, it's locked until the. The merger happens. But as I. As I was saying before, the merge is going to happen, there's. There's no way it's not going to happen.
01:14:04.944 - 01:14:21.584, Speaker A: So, yeah, I would suggest, not suggest, but I would say that, like, if. If you are someone who plans to hold ETH for many years, then it makes sense for, for you to stake it if you're not already using it within, within defy. But maybe someone else has a different thought on that, or, you know, to answer your question.
01:14:24.474 - 01:14:26.514, Speaker E: Perfect. Low enough risk is what I thought.
01:14:26.554 - 01:14:26.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:26.802 - 01:14:27.454, Speaker E: Cheers.
01:14:27.994 - 01:14:53.164, Speaker A: I actually think staking is probably the lowest risk thing you can do with your ETH right now in terms of, like, earning a yield on it. And the yield obviously isn't, you know, too high. It's like, I mean. I mean, it's pretty high for normal standards, but for crypto standards, it's not. It's like six 7%, which is pretty decent. But, you know, if you want to take on more risk with your ETH, you can always, you know, put it in, in maker, borrow some stable coin, borrow some dai. Sorry.
01:14:53.164 - 01:15:10.704, Speaker A: And then go yield farm with that. But then you expose yourself not only to smart contract with risk, but also liquidation risk and things like that, and you're also paying a fee for that privilege, too. So, yeah, I think staking is definitely the safest and the least stressful way to earn a yield on your ETH right now.
01:15:11.444 - 01:15:14.876, Speaker E: The less stress that's the key takeaway from each year's.
01:15:14.980 - 01:15:16.144, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it.
01:15:20.894 - 01:15:26.742, Speaker F: So does this positive eve into a yearn vault actually is staking there?
01:15:26.798 - 01:15:58.728, Speaker A: So the yearn vault uses lido finance in the background, which they issue a staked ETH token called Steve, which essentially gives you exposure to that. But the problem is, is that. Sorry, sorry. The. The urn vault will actually put your ethan to the curve pool, which pairs it with the STE token and will basically yield farm like that. But they're. The STE token is essentially a representation of staking, so you can earn the yield that way.
01:15:58.728 - 01:16:15.264, Speaker A: But there are. There may be. The problem with that is that there may be tax implications. If you trade your ETH for Ste, does the tax office think that you've disposed your ETH for another asset, even though technically it is. It is kind of like the same asset, just with a yield on it. So I would check on that, depending on where you are. But.
01:16:15.264 - 01:16:41.824, Speaker A: But, yeah, there are ways to do that without running the validators yourself. You can. You can just buy Steve, for example, or, like, trade your ETH for it if you want to, or pair your ETH with Steth in a curve pool and earn some. Some rewards on that. But that's more risk, because it's not just staking. It's also putting it in curve, which is smart contract risk, and. And, you know, I guess, like, it's an amm pool as well, so there's some additional risks there, too.
01:16:43.684 - 01:16:50.716, Speaker F: Okay, then. Thanks for another question. Do you have intention to launch a DaO for the.
01:16:50.740 - 01:17:05.134, Speaker A: For the daily gray? No, I mean, not a dow. I think a DAO really does require a token for coordination, both of capital and human coordination. So. Yeah, I don't think so. Just. I don't know. I.
01:17:05.134 - 01:17:25.906, Speaker A: People have asked me this question a lot over the time, and I did give some thought to it. I just. As I said, I want to see what. How bankless plays out, but I just. I don't really see a purpose for it. At the end of the day, I don't know how much value it would provide from, you know, on top of what I'm already doing sort of thing. Yeah.
01:17:25.906 - 01:17:27.586, Speaker A: Yeah. That's a very tricky question.
01:17:27.650 - 01:17:29.412, Speaker F: Thanks for asking. Answering that.
01:17:29.548 - 01:17:47.596, Speaker A: All good. Oh, Maheshetti, you're off mute. I can hear. There you go. Thank you. If you had a question, feel free to ask it, though. I think crypto bkk you.
01:17:47.596 - 01:17:57.804, Speaker A: You go off mute, but I can't hear you if you're asking a question, unfortunately, disco Danson as well. If you want to ask something, you're off mute to.
01:18:09.424 - 01:18:10.328, Speaker C: Speaking about.
01:18:10.456 - 01:18:22.304, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, no, I was just reading the chat. I didn't check the chat. A quick question. He was asking what the mangas in the background are. These are one piece manga, dummy. Anyway, go ahead.
01:18:22.964 - 01:18:44.020, Speaker C: Speaking about curve, what do you think distinguishes uniswap v three with curve? Because I'm still not sure. I mean, curve is for stablecoins, but uniswap V three also greatly enhances support for stablecoins. And I'm kind of in the pickle of. I mean, curve is easy. It's deposit and forget. You provide liquidity, you can forget about everything. Uni v three is a little bit more complicated because you need to determine your range.
01:18:44.020 - 01:18:57.804, Speaker C: Well, for stablecoins, it's easy. It's around the $1 mark. But I'm still not sure yet what will. How they will live in harmony. I mean, I don't think curve will win from uni or uni will win against curve, but I'm not sure where they stand right now.
01:18:58.424 - 01:19:19.622, Speaker A: I'm in the same boat as you. I think this is something that a lot of people in the ecosystem are watching and wondering how it's going to play out. But in saying that, I think that it's just at the end of the day, people prefer different platforms. Some people prefer curve. Some people prefer uniswap. And, you know, curve hasn't, you know, curves. Liquidity hasn't drained into uniswap V three or anything like that.
01:19:19.622 - 01:20:01.648, Speaker A: Maybe long term it does, but I do think that they can live in harmony, even though that might be counterintuitive, I do think that they can. They can exist in harmony, and I do know that curve is working on a v two as well. So maybe they have some key innovations there, but it does come back to the, to the questions of, like, you know, what is the moat, right? What is the, you know, can one protocol, just like you, you know, take over all the other protocols? Because it just has everything. I don't think that's the case. I think that the more complex a protocol is, the harder it is as well, to. To kind of take over and, you know, different protocols and different dows will have specializations and different things. So, yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see it play out, but I do think they can live in harmony.
01:20:01.648 - 01:20:36.596, Speaker A: I don't think that there's any, like, unisovie three is gonna kill curve or anything like that. Just reading the chat here, is there any other questions? Someone saying, staking apy? I know they're having a conversation in there. My bad. Yeah, crypto BKK. I can't hear you. If you're trying to ask a question, maybe you can type it in the chat. If you want to ask something in the.
01:20:36.596 - 01:20:54.230, Speaker A: In the general chat. But anyone else? Yeah, feel free to ask away here. We'll probably wrap it up soon, maybe in five minutes. Getting late here. 12:30 a.m.. So. Yeah.
01:20:54.230 - 01:20:58.074, Speaker A: Any. Any final questions, I'm happy to answer them, and we'll probably wrap it up.
01:21:03.234 - 01:21:16.434, Speaker C: Do you know what happened to PPit? There was a huge influx at the start of 2017, where there were a lot of social projects like PPIt. I think you had the. Dan, I forgot his name. The Es guy. He had a. I forgot its name.
01:21:16.474 - 01:21:19.334, Speaker A: There was, like, this paid blog post, staymit.
01:21:20.274 - 01:21:50.244, Speaker C: No, no, no. It was a different thing. But either way, my point is, Twitter has a lot of criticism that they're censoring stuff. So a lot of people are saying, well, cryptocurrency is uncensorable or in some way or another. So we should make a Twitter for ethereum or a Twitter for crypto. Do you think that holds any ground? Do you think that's even a possibility? Because when you're dealing with crypto, you're dealing with crypto. Crypto economics, and then probably tweets will be get monetized, and if content gets monetized, it turns into a shillingfest.
01:21:51.224 - 01:22:15.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think ppeth, essentially, the fees got too high for them because they were doing everything on layer one. I think the technology just hasn't been there to enable these kind of things just yet. There have been experiments on other chains, like steam or steemit, which was around for quite a while, which is. Yeah, yeah. Which. Which is famous for the hostile takeover from Justin Stan. And then they forked off to something called Hive, I think.
01:22:15.838 - 01:22:52.914, Speaker A: And they were doing this. But, yeah, I always thought that the. The incentives were warped, because if you are paying people to post content, that would just post, like, rubbish content, and there were vote buying going on and, like, trading of different up votes and things like that. So I don't know if that model can work, but a decentralized social network is interesting, but it needs moderation, right? If anyone can post anything they want on it, then what's to stop it from just devolving into, like, a complete, you know, shit fest? I mean, you can see what happens when there's unmoderated boards everywhere. Like, I mean, you know, I just. As a. As an example, many people may be aware of four chain is mostly unmoderated.
01:22:52.914 - 01:23:10.006, Speaker A: There is moderation for, like, illegal content. Um, but, you know, mostly it's unmoderated and that is just like, you know, it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's. It's pretty bad. It's pretty. It's chaos, essentially. So, I mean, what's stopping a decentralized Twitter from turning into that? There has to be some level of moderation.
01:23:10.006 - 01:23:40.136, Speaker A: And I think that it's going to be hard for, you know, even a dao to moderate that. And, you know, maybe it takes the Wikipedia model. I mean, Wikipedia technically is a decentralized platform where, you know, anyone can post anything they want to it. It's not, I mean, technically it's not decentralized, but it's an open platform that anyone can post anything to. But it's moderated by a, you know, diverse set of people. They, you know, earn reputation for what they do and they, you know, they have like, control over what gets on the site and things like that. Maybe it has to be like that sort of model.
01:23:40.136 - 01:24:11.424, Speaker A: But yeah, I do think the technology is just not there yet because of the scalability issues with, with ethereum in particular. Just checking the general charts. What are your thoughts on index? Index? I was just talking about index co op before. Extremely bullish on it. I mean, I'm biased because I'm, I was part of the team that launched index co op with set, and I'm still an advisor to set. I think that they're the best dow in the space right now, if I'm being honest. So definitely check, check them out if you haven't yet.
01:24:11.424 - 01:24:35.304, Speaker A: Crypto BKK, I can see your question here. What are your thoughts on algo stable coins? I think they're interesting. Interesting as experiments. I think a lot of them, the majority of them are Ponzi schemes and will fail because their intentive mechanisms don't make much sense. But I do think that a lot of them are also cool. I do think that the experiments, I'd like seeing experiments play out. My favorites are probably.
01:24:35.304 - 01:25:16.862, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's funny because, like, it depends what algo stablecoin, because there's different ways to do it. I mean, there was ESD and DSD and all that sort of stuff that did like a coupon system, which I actually considered to be pretty much a Ponzi because it required people to essentially just like, keep buying in to keep the value, like, afloat. And like, you know, it would, it would obviously not stay at its peg because the incentives were kind of messed up. And then there was, there's like fay protocol, for example, which is using protocol controlled value, which is another mechanism. And then there's rye from, from reflexer, which essentially doesn't peg itself to a dollar. Pegs itself. It pegs itself to itself, which I think is actually really cool as well.
01:25:16.862 - 01:25:42.504, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, all four of just watching experimentations play out here. And Rick Jones is asking a question. What do you think other index based protocols like Piedao and indexed finance? I think. I mean, I haven't really dived too big, deep into them. I'm aware of them, of course. And essentially, you know, you can consider them competitions of the index co op, I would guess. But they're doing different things, taking different paths.
01:25:42.504 - 01:26:05.408, Speaker A: I think they're. They're fine. I just don't know too much about the individual projects themselves, but I'm pretty sure they've got like, you know, the same sort of setup as index cop where they have a dow. They're producing index products and things like that as well. Rick Jones saying it's pegged to a pie number. Oh, that's just an arbitrary number that they, that they came up with. Rise actually just pegged to itself and can deviate from.
01:26:05.408 - 01:26:33.044, Speaker A: From that. But that was just like the number that they, that they created at the start, which was, which was quite funny, I thought. All right, final, final questions, anyone, or I'll wrap this. Wrap this up for today. Think that's it then? Unless. I think it's a few people going off mute, but I can't even exactly hear you.
01:26:34.144 - 01:26:35.400, Speaker E: Thanks for all the info.
01:26:35.512 - 01:26:58.256, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, yeah, we'll end it there. Thank you, everyone, for joining the first ama. Probably do this, you know, every, every couple of weeks or every, every so often, you know, happy to always answer any questions in the Discord channel as well. The recording will be up on YouTube, you know, shortly, probably. Probably tomorrow. I'll get it up there and you can go back and listen in and pass it on to your friends or anything if you want as well.
01:26:58.256 - 01:27:03.214, Speaker A: So, yeah, thank you again, everyone, for joining and have a good evening. Morning, afternoon, wherever you are in the world.
