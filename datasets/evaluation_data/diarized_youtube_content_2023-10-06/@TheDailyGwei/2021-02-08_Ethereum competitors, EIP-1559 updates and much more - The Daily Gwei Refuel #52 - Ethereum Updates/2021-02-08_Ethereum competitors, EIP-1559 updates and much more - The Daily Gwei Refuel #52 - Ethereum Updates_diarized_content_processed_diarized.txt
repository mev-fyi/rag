00:00:00.520 - 00:00:45.732, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Grey Refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Susano, and today's the 8 February 2021. Alright everyone, let's get into the news from over the weekend. So actually, before we jump into the news, I did want to go on a little bit of a rant because I got into a lot of heated, I guess, discussions over the weekend on Twitter about, you know, different ethereum competitors. As you know, they're getting kind of, I guess, popular lately, I guess you could say because of the fact that the gas fees on Ethereum are high. So, you know, you always have people going, gas fees are going to kill Ethereum. You know, come use this chain, it's better, it's faster, blah, blah, whatever, right? And in general, you know, I'm, I try to be very open minded, right, about certain things.
00:00:45.732 - 00:01:51.846, Speaker A: And, you know, when you've been in the space kind of like as long as I have and you've seen kind of like all these things come and go, it becomes very hard to be open to, I guess like newer things that you've seen fail a million times before, like the quote unquote Ethereum killers have been around for a while now, right? We had like one of the biggest ones kind of launch in 2018 called eos, right? You know, and back then there were so many people shilling eos for the exact same reasons as they're kind of shilling these other things today. It's basically the same old kind of talking points of, you know, it's more scalable than Ethereum. It can do more transactions. You know, who's going to use this? You know, who's going to use Ethereum and only do 15 transactions per second, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you know, it's funny because since then, Ethereum has just kept growing, right? Ethereum has not stagnated. It's developing, it's growing, it's as it's, it's as big as it's ever been, right? So, I mean, any of us isn't the only one, you know, I don't want to kind of harp on any particular project, but there's like a whole laundry list of them that were around, you know, in the 20 1718 kind of 19 cycle, which just got completely washed out, right? They got basically zero traction. And, you know, no one even really talks about them anymore.
00:01:51.846 - 00:02:05.638, Speaker A: Like, you know, you might hear some people talking about them here now and again, but there are, there are literally some that were talked about so much in 2017 that I haven't heard about from, for years now. Basically, I didn't even hear about it during 2020. So from that perspective.
00:02:05.686 - 00:02:06.182, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:06.318 - 00:02:31.834, Speaker A: You know, and this is why, like, I guess a lot of us in the Ethereum ecosystem are extremely skeptical of any of the other, quote, unquote, ethereum killers or competitor chains, right? Yeah, there's a, there's a fair few out there right now. And of course, they're getting a lot of attention because of the high gas fees on Ethereum. And I think they, they often act as, like a trap for newer people as well, because newer people obviously don't have, you know, very much to go off of when they get into this ecosystem.
00:02:31.874 - 00:02:32.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:32.594 - 00:02:40.098, Speaker A: Their first experience of Ethereum these days is, unfortunately, they load it up. You know, they see what the, what this defi thing is all about, and then they hit.
00:02:40.146 - 00:02:40.378, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:40.426 - 00:02:41.834, Speaker A: With like 40, $50 fees.
00:02:41.874 - 00:02:42.186, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:02:42.210 - 00:03:39.334, Speaker A: From the get go. So I can understand why people fall into this kind of space where they go onto one of these other chains. And, you know, a popular one is binance smart chain, for example. And, and again, I don't want to single out any projects, but I just want to give some examples here. But that's a popular one that people always mention to me and say, you know, Ethereum is going to lose to binance smart chain because they have, like, lower fees and more transactions and blah, blah, blah and all this stuff. But these people never, I don't know if they question it to themselves, but they never actually seem like they question why this is the case, right? So why do these other, quote, unquote, blockchains have lower fees and higher transactions per second, right? And the common denominator, and the answer across every single time is that they sacrifice the centralization for scale, right? So in binance smart chain's case, they have 21 validators. That's it, right? Have 21 distinct validators who, you know, they say are run by 21 different people or whatever.
00:03:39.334 - 00:03:57.014, Speaker A: But in reality, you know, I would bet that most of them are run by the same few entities. And if push came to shove, there would probably be a central party that could shut down that entire chain, right? And it really, really is controlled by binance. So I wouldn't even compare that to Ethereum because it's very, very different.
00:03:57.054 - 00:03:57.206, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:57.230 - 00:04:32.754, Speaker A: To shut down Ethereum is extremely hard. Yes. You know, miners go into mining pools, right? And then other mining pools get all these hash rate. And it kind of centralizes from that perspective, but it's not the same thing, because miners can switch from, from different pools, right? Like instantly they're not tied to a different pool. And there's, there's, it's not a permission thing where you need to be one of these 21 validators to validate the network. Anyone can become a miner, right? Or in ETH two, anyone can become a validator slash staker. So there's that perspective, and that's always what happens, right? There is not a system that I know of today that scales without sacrificing decentralization.
00:04:32.754 - 00:05:23.844, Speaker A: Even, even sharding to an extent, doesn't give you the exact same kind of properties that like a kind of singular blockchain would. And this is just how it works. This is the very technical, this can be very technical. And I, and I completely understand why newer people to the ecosystem kind of fall into these traps where the marketing from these other chains where they're like, you know, we're more scalable, we've got low fees and all that sort of stuff. And the second thing is, you know, thinking to yourself, well, I mean, you've got low fees because you don't have any usage, right? You go on these other chains, you look at their transactions per second or that story, their transactions per day, and it's usually very, very low. Like, I looked at one before, and again, I don't want to single anyone out, but I looked at one before and it was doing like, I think 10,000 transactions over 24 hours. And the thing is, all those transactions, and I look, I looked through a lot of them were just staking transactions and arbitrage transact transactions.
00:05:23.844 - 00:05:54.420, Speaker A: So it was basically, you know, these chains are obviously proof of stake chains and it was just staking rewards being paid out. And then it was just arbitrage transactions from exchange to exchange for the token trading. There was no activity outside of that. And these networks are worth billions of dollars. So it's just, you know, it's crazy to me that this is happening. And, you know, I say on my tweet here that you can kind of see that it's always the same kind of talking points, like do your own research or smart contracts coming soon or fees are going to kill Ethereum. And I've heard all this before and I just don't think they're good arguments.
00:05:54.420 - 00:06:01.920, Speaker A: And I tried to fish for some arguments with this thread and I, and I got to talking with a few people about it and I still had nothing come up.
00:06:01.952 - 00:06:02.192, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:02.248 - 00:06:38.218, Speaker A: It was the same thing. Like, funny enough, people in this thread told me that high gas fees is what's going to kill ethereum. And I'm just like, give me some better arguments, right? And, you know, if any of you know of anything better for me to kind of like, go over, I'm all ears. But, you know, I just have not seen any compelling arguments as to why Ethereum is going to lose its market share. Saying that, you know, the fees are going to kill it is not true because the fees have been consistently high for the last few months, right? And the Ethereum network has kept growing. It is not stagnating. Yes, it has priced out some smaller users, but we're going to fix that with L2 and things like that.
00:06:38.218 - 00:07:21.502, Speaker A: And the ultimate irony to me is that whenever I bring this up with people who are fans of other chains, they say L2 is taking too long. You know, it's not going to work. Ethereum's taking too long. It's going to lose its lead because their favorite blockchain is going to add smart contracts soon and take over. The grand irony here is that, okay, well, you, so you're basically saying that it's going to take longer for Ethereum to adopt L2, like have a, like a bustling L2 ecosystem than it would for another blockchain to basically get all the same network effects that Ethereum enjoys today, right? Like, what do you think's harder? It's obvious what's hard. It's very, it's much, much harder for these other ecosystems to spin up and get to the same level as Ethereum. Layer two is much easier.
00:07:21.502 - 00:08:05.924, Speaker A: So, you know, it's just always funny when I see these kind of arguments and, you know, I get that there's some merits to these other kind of chains and they have like novel technology and all that. And I'm not kind of having a go at the technology per se, I'm more having a go at the fact that, you know, if you're building a system and you're saying that it's like an Ethereum killer or it's like better than Ethereum, right? You have to prove that on merit. You can't just say it, right? You can't just have like a fan base who buys the token and it goes up and, you know, they make money, so they think it's the best thing ever. You need to actually prove it. And, you know, ethereum is the only one that's proving that it does anything. Sorry. That it does more than just like validate its own blockchain, for example, like staking transactions or, you know, staking payouts and not, you know, it's just staking activity that's like nothing, right.
00:08:05.924 - 00:08:24.094, Speaker A: It's nothing important. It's not like defi activity, right. And all this sort of stuff. So, yeah, a little bit of a rant there. I don't want to go too much about this, but it's. It's obviously a hot topic right now. And I think that if you're seeing a lot of this kind of, I guess, like on Twitter, right, on Reddit, on YouTube, you're probably seeing a lot of this.
00:08:24.094 - 00:08:48.332, Speaker A: It's always good to question whatever you're sold by people. Question whatever you're sold by me. But I think that, you know, I'm at a point where I try to be as, like, objective as possible about this and as neutral as possible as I can be. Obviously, I have a bias against Ethereum, right. That's that I don't need to explain that. But at the same time, there are literally people out there who will tell you all the benefits of a system without the drawbacks of it. And there's plenty of drawbacks to a theorem.
00:08:48.332 - 00:09:32.148, Speaker A: I talk about it all the time on the refuel ride. What ethereum needs to fix, obviously, they need to fix the gas fees. I'm not saying that the high gas fees are a good thing for end users. I mean, I would never say that. But, you know, these other things and these other chains, I always just see them kind of marketing the quote unquote benefits, and they never, ever once say, we sacrifice decentralization to achieve scale. Because if they said that, then people would immediately clue in and be like, well, if you're not decentralized, then what the hell's the point, right? Like, literally, what is the point of a blockchain if it's not decentralized? You are literally way better off just using a centralized database because it's faster and more efficient and cheaper and you don't have to bootstrap this entire thing, right? Which is very hard. Like, bootstrapping a blockchain is not an easy task.
00:09:32.148 - 00:09:58.336, Speaker A: So from that perspective, like, it just doesn't make much sense to me. So obviously I'm going to continue to bet on Ethereum and ETH. I think that it has an enormous kind of like, advantage over the other kind of chains. I think it has an enormous lead. I think that developers are what bootstrap an ecosystem and what keep it alive. And all the developers I know have zero interest in working on a kind of a chain that is not decentralized. Right.
00:09:58.336 - 00:10:29.746, Speaker A: They're kind of, they're not leaving the web two ecosystem that is completely centralized to, to just work on a centralized kind of blockchain, right. They're leaving to come into a new world and work on, you know, decentralized open source software so they can actually stick it to these centralized companies. So that is what I'm betting on. I'm always betting on the developers, the people, the community. And Ethereum has one has the strongest by far. There is not even a second place because as I've said before on the refuel, if you were to ask ten different people, you know, what is second place to Ethereum? You would get ten different answers.
00:10:29.870 - 00:10:30.178, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:30.226 - 00:11:04.326, Speaker A: But that will all tell you that Ethereum is number one. So that to me is enough. You know, maybe one day we will have a number two, right? I'm not saying that these other chains can't get market share or can't kind of grow. All I'm saying is that I believe Ethereum will remain number one across like all the metrics that I track, right? It'll rename the most secure settlement layer. It'll remain kind of like the one with the most activity on it, right. The most mind share, the most developers. I just don't see any other chain kind of beating that out because you need more than, you know, promises of greater scalability and lower fees to attract people.
00:11:04.390 - 00:11:04.566, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:04.590 - 00:11:37.386, Speaker A: That's just, it's such a surface level kind of argument. And if that's all you're offering, then you've already lost to Ethereum L2s, right? So yeah, anyway, nrant there. If you do have other thoughts, I would love to hear them in the comments because as I said, I'm always open to learning more. I do have a lot of, obviously experience with other kind of like Ethereum competitors that have been around for years. So I definitely know my way around this sort of stuff. But I'm not gonna say that I like know everything, right? So I'm always willing to learn more. So yeah, if you've got things, share them in the comments or dm me on twitter.
00:11:37.386 - 00:11:56.504, Speaker A: Always happy to have a friendly debate. None of this is kind of personal, right? People like to make this religious and personal. I'm not like that. I'm not gonna call you a scammer or anything just because you're a fan of another chain or whatever. That's just not a great way to go about stuff. So yeah, looking forward to some healthy debate debates on this, hopefully. All right, onto some more positive news.
00:11:56.504 - 00:12:35.052, Speaker A: I think so CME have launched their ETH futures, what will be launching the 8th futures kind of today, or by the time you watch this, it's probably already launched. They kicked it off at 06:00 p.m. On Sunday, actually eastern time, where people could place their kind of first trade. Sorry, place their trades. But the first trade would occur on, on February, which is obviously today. So that's huge, right? We had this announced, I guess, a couple of months ago where CME came out and said, yeah, okay, we're going to do ETH futures now after, you know, I guess three years, it's been three years since they did BTC futures. And, you know, everyone was like, is this going to be bad for the price?
00:12:35.148 - 00:12:35.404, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:35.444 - 00:13:02.450, Speaker A: You know, when bit, when the futures launched for BTC, the price tanked and went into a bear market. But I think I've explained this before on the refuel. The CME, bitcoin futures launched at the end of the bitcoin bull market or end of the crypto bull market in 2017. You know, BTC had already gone 20 x, right, from its last all time high. ETH had already gone, you know, 140 x, right, from, from what it started the year on. So we were at the tail end. Now we're kind of like still at the beginning, right.
00:13:02.450 - 00:13:07.402, Speaker A: ETH is just above its all time high. BTC is only two times its all, last all time high.
00:13:07.458 - 00:13:07.866, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:07.970 - 00:13:27.640, Speaker A: You know, there is some froth going on right now, but it's still kind of like, it's definitely, I would say, early to mid kind of stage here. So this, to me, is just a very, very bullish event for ethanol. And institutions who kind of play with these products on CME have been buying ETH anyway through other products like. Like grayscale.
00:13:27.712 - 00:13:28.232, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:28.368 - 00:13:33.368, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't see this as a bearish event at all. And I look forward to the market kind of showing that.
00:13:33.416 - 00:13:33.648, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:33.696 - 00:14:02.566, Speaker A: It's. We'll see what happens with the ETH price over the coming days. So another big kind of hot topic on Twitter lately has been around, I guess, Ethereum. Scalability and raising the gas limit to bring more scalability to Ethereum. Now, for those of you who don't know what the gas limit is, I'll give you a quick explanation. I have a daily gray piece about this as well. But basically the way gas works in Ethereum is that the, each block has a gas limit, and the gas limit is essentially a block size.
00:14:02.566 - 00:14:41.766, Speaker A: So you can, you might remember that bitcoin has a 1 mb block size it's a bit more than that with segwit, but, you know, 1 mb hard kind of block size, where Ethereum's block size is, is variable and it depends on kind of the gas kind of limit here. So the gas limit is, I mean, I don't know what it is right now. I think it's like 15 million or something, or maybe almost 15 million. And the higher this gas limit is, the more transactions can fit in the block. Or I guess, like the more gas that can be used per ethereum block, right. And, you know, you will know that each transaction on ethereum costs a certain amount of gas and ETH transfer costs 21,000. Gas token transfer is more than that.
00:14:41.766 - 00:14:45.174, Speaker A: Smart contract interactions within DeFi are a lot more than that.
00:14:45.214 - 00:14:45.696, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:45.830 - 00:14:51.324, Speaker A: So if you have, you know, a higher gas limit, you can obviously fit more kind of transactions into each block.
00:14:51.404 - 00:14:52.052, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:52.228 - 00:15:24.880, Speaker A: So the miners on the network have the ability to vote up this gas limit, essentially, so they can actually kind of, you know, any miner can do this and basically say, okay, I want to signal that the gas limit should be high. Like, should be this high. And then if enough of them do this, the gas limit basically raises to that. They've done this a couple of times in the past, but raising the gas limit comes with trade offs, and I'll go through them quickly. But this, this, this is a great thread from Marius that you should read. It's quite long here, and it's quite technical, but I'm not going to read through it all. But I'll give you, like, the TRDR here.
00:15:24.880 - 00:15:51.508, Speaker A: So the reason why we can't just raise the gas limit, like ten times from here is, is twofold. So as marios mentions here, there's the concept of an unkull rate. Now, what the unkull rate is, is that there's when, when miners are producing blocks, sometimes they will produce what's called an uncool block or a stale block where it won't get included in the main chain. But because the miners still did the work to produce that block, they will get paid a small reward for it.
00:15:51.556 - 00:15:51.980, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:52.092 - 00:16:21.634, Speaker A: Now, you don't want the uncle rate too high. You ideally want it as low as possible. Now, raising the gas limit means that the miners have to process more transactions, right. The burden of the network becomes greater for them, which means that they are more likely to produce more stale blocks or more uncle blocks, for example. So we don't want that to happen because uncle blocks are a security issue and I think a denial of service issue as well. So we obviously don't want that, that to happen. And that's why the gas limit hasn't just been raised, you know, really, really high from here.
00:16:21.634 - 00:16:50.786, Speaker A: Secondly, is that the, the ethereum kind of blockchain, blockchain size is dictated a lot by the size of its state. Now the more you raise the gas limit, the bigger the state becomes. So the state is already quite large. And if you just, you know, say you raise the gas limit by like 10%, then the state growth will increase by 10%, essentially. Now what that means is that it becomes harder to sink in a theory and full node. So you don't want that to happen. So these are like the two main concerns with it.
00:16:50.786 - 00:17:35.284, Speaker A: You don't want the uncle rate to increase and you don't want the state size to increase, or at least you don't want to, you know, kind of put an even extra burden on people running ethereum full nodes with this. So, you know, Marios is a kind of a core developer on the geth client. And he goes through in this thread about kind of like why we shouldn't do this, right? Why we don't, we shouldn't raise the gas limit, why it's dangerous. And you know, he basically speaks to the points I just went through, but he goes into a lot more detail about it. So I highly recommend reading this thread, but I just thought it was prudent to explain to you guys why this isn't like a, I mean, there'd be people calling for this on Twitter and it just, it isn't something that can just be done. It's not, it's not a silver bullet, right. It's not something that is going to just fix all our scaling woes and all that sort of stuff for the reasons I just outlined.
00:17:35.284 - 00:18:08.196, Speaker A: And I think Peter has a, has a kind of a tweet here as well, saying that he thinks that it shouldn't happen either. And Peter is the team lead at Go Ethereum, so he's back. I mean, if I had to say, Peter is probably like the lead Ethereum one core developer. He knows the, the go Ethereum code base back to front. He could probably code the whole thing with his eyes closed at this point. Point he is critical to, to ETH one and he knows what he's talking about. If, you know, if you needed to trust anyone with ETH one development and protocol development, it'd be, it'd be Peter here.
00:18:08.196 - 00:18:56.646, Speaker A: So I trust what he says always. He's very good at, good at kind of getting his point across here. And, you know, he says here that if you want more gas or you want the gas limit to be raised, then you should bring a technical solution to make the clients ten times faster. Now this is, as I was saying before, you raise the gas limit, you increase the burden on miners and node runners, and those miners and node runners, obviously, running clients, right? And a lot of them are running go ethereum. So if you can make the clients more efficient and better and make them faster so they can process, you know, this increased gas limit in a better way, then, you know, you get, you can get the uncle rates down or at least stay at the same kind of place, and then you can deal with the state growing, you know, faster than it was before. So that's another thing to consider here. But as I said, I've got a daily way piece that I'll include in the YouTube description called pump the gas limit.
00:18:56.646 - 00:19:33.802, Speaker A: It was basically, I guess, a few months ago the gas limit was actually raised and I went through, you know, exactly what that is and what happens when you do it and like the technicals behind it. It's, it's one of my better pieces in the Daily Way newsletter. I usually write short pieces, but it was actually a long one. So I'll link that for you to go check out, basically. So some updates from Tim Baiko on ERP 1559 here, which I thought was cool. So I mean, it's funny how this was just like buried in a random kind of thread here, but basically someone asked for an update on when 1559 would be ready to launch. And Tim went on to say, I think it should be ready to be considered for Mainnet in the next few weeks.
00:19:33.802 - 00:20:08.606, Speaker A: See this checklist for what's left to do. We want to get the client level open issues done before he presents it on the all core devs. So there's a checklist here that I will link in the, in the YouTube description, of course. And you can go check out the implementation kind of readiness for each of these clients. And the checklist, I mean, most of this stuff has been checked off, which is really awesome to see. And this is, yeah, basically all the work that needs to be done before 1559 can be included. And I think he kind of alludes to, you know, once this kind of happens in the next few weeks, then he'd be comfortable proposing 1559 for inclusion, uh, basically.
00:20:08.606 - 00:20:36.998, Speaker A: And that could happen within the next six to nine months. So, you know, as I've speculated before, you know, I kind of said that we might see 1559 in like July or August sort of thing. And that would fall into like this six to nine month window, I think, from today. So that makes a lot of sense. So that's great, right? I mean, Tim, as for those who don't know, he is basically the ETH one kind of hard fork coordinator or network upgrade coordinator at this point. I think. Yeah, I think.
00:20:36.998 - 00:21:06.620, Speaker A: I think he is. And he's basically top level, kind of all core devs Ethereum. And he also is leading the ERP 1559 effort, too. So he's very important and he knows what he's talking about when, when he's saying, saying these things. So very, very positive news here. And he does remind people that 1559 is not going to fix the high gas prices. It is going to smoothen out transactions and give a better fee estimation so people won't be overpaying, but it's not going to materially bring down the cost of transaction fees.
00:21:06.620 - 00:21:51.952, Speaker A: And I have said this before on the refuel, but, you know, there are so many other benefits to 1559 that I think we can, we can live without the gas fees being lowered by it at this point. So will price put out this interesting kind of chart here that shows basically, you know, the gas spent, the gas used by different transactions interacting with both kind of uniswap and sushiswap. And, you know, it's funny, I explained kind of last week on one of the refuels that the reason why, or one of the major reasons why the gas fees are so high is because of these arbitrage bots. Now, what these arbitrage bots do is that they take arbitrage opportunities between different liquidity pools on Ethereum. So you'll have a liquidity pool on uniswap, on Sushiswap, on balancer, on curve, wherever.
00:21:52.008 - 00:21:52.416, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:52.520 - 00:22:38.230, Speaker A: And these r bots will basically, you know, outbid each other in gas wars to kind of like, get this Arb opportunity to make a profit. Now, these account for most of the transaction fees, as you can, you can see here. And, you know, Hayden, actually, they said that it's the leading cause of the insane gas price, gas prices. And basically, you know, users are competing with these arbitrage bots for space in a block. So, you know, this is something that is, I don't know if it's something that, you know, you can solve. I think it's a very hard problem when you think about it because we obviously are going to have arbitrage across these decentralized exchanges no matter what we do. The only solution, I guess, would be to centralize all the liquidity into one pool, but then you wouldn't have competing ecosystems.
00:22:38.230 - 00:23:10.064, Speaker A: It would just be one big swap protocol, which obviously doesn't work either. So I think basically, with this reality, as I've said in the past, most users are going to have to sit on L2. Layer one is going to be a settlement layer for L2s. It's going to be a settlement layer for high value transactions. It's going to be a layer that some users go to sometimes. It's obviously going to remain a layer for arbitrage bots and stuff like that, but it is not. It's going to be too hard to keep it as like a cheap kind of layer for end users to use.
00:23:10.064 - 00:23:30.364, Speaker A: And of course, these arbitrage bots will exist on L2 as well. But because we have so much scalability at L2, it will be, you know, less of a problem as well on there. And probably not. I mean, it might be a slight problem, but I don't imagine it being like a huge problem like it is on layer one ethereum today. So, yeah, unfortunately, this is what we have to deal with. But it is usage.
00:23:30.404 - 00:23:30.556, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:30.580 - 00:23:50.048, Speaker A: These r bots wouldn't have anything to do if there weren't users trading on these kind of exchanges because there would be no arbitrage opportunities opened up because the bots would just basically collapse that to zero because they're efficient, whereas humans aren't efficient. Right. There'll be lots of humans that go to uniswap and do a trade and they don't care about, like, what the price is on, like sushiswap, for example.
00:23:50.096 - 00:23:50.520, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:50.632 - 00:24:27.514, Speaker A: And then the arb will need to be closed sort of thing. So, yeah, interesting to keep an eye on this. And I'm glad that kind of, like, will tweeted this out because I thought it was very interesting. So Santiago tweeted out this thread from kind of like paraphy on behalf of parafy, saying that they're proposing the rollout of liquidity mining incentives into Aaver to further drive growth. Sorry, to drive further growth and to drive the v two migration. So there's a proposal on the governance forum here that you can see if it loads about liquidity mining incentives. And, you know, it's a pretty lengthy kind of post here, so I won't read through it.
00:24:27.514 - 00:24:50.716, Speaker A: But basically what they kind of propose, and they've got like, a nice table here, is that, you know, the Aave protocol should basically pay if the other price is $500, which it is today. I think the other ALP rewards daily would be $18.2 million over a course of like 100 days here. So. Yeah, that's not too much.
00:24:50.740 - 00:24:50.852, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:50.868 - 00:25:07.356, Speaker A: Because that's over the course of like 100 days if I'm reading this chart. Right. Which I think, you know, is fine. I think. I don't think I've been necessarily needs liquidity mining. But I think the incentives here are basically to get people to migrate off of v one to v two faster, essentially.
00:25:07.420 - 00:25:08.024, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:08.394 - 00:25:26.522, Speaker A: Which I think is a. Is a. Is a good goal to have because, you know, I think v one is very expensive to use for starters, compared to v two. There's a lot of features missing from that. Maintaining both protocols is very intensive for the team and, you know, it's also a security hole because I think v one would be less secure than v two. I don't know for sure.
00:25:26.578 - 00:25:26.770, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:26.802 - 00:25:41.606, Speaker A: Maybe it's not, but yeah. So this is kind of like, I guess the main benefit of it and then the secondary benefit is to further kind of drive growth to Aave, which. Which obviously, you know, we would want to do here. So. Yeah. Great to see this. I'll link this in the YouTube description.
00:25:41.606 - 00:26:22.992, Speaker A: You can go read the whole proposal. So as I mentioned on last week's refuel yearn finance, one of their vaults was unfortunately exploited. There was a few million dollars lost there. So now what yearn's doing is they're evaluating options to make the vault whole. And the current path that they're on involves making a maker CDP with Wifi tokens as collateral and drawing the deficit against that and then paying it back with protocol fees. In plain English, they're basically proposing to take on debt on their Wi Fi tokens, right. Borrowing say $5 million from maker, using Wifi as collateral, and then paying that $5 million back with protocol fees generated on yearn.
00:26:22.992 - 00:27:10.708, Speaker A: I actually thought this was quite, quite cool, right? I actually thought this was a very innovative way to kind of COVID the losses and then, you know, basically take the, the losses and basically convert it into protocol fees for yearn. So the. It's not like socializing it by printing more kind of Wi Fi tokens to pay it back. It's basically saying, you know, we're gonna take on debt, but we know that the yearn protocol will keep generating fee revenue and we'll just pay down this debt with the fees generated, which I thought was. Was pretty genius. So yeah, great to see them kind of, I guess like compensating users, but also going down like a pretty, pretty new path here. So there's a tweet here from crypto Navi basically describing that there's a proposal on the Sushiswaps forum to leverage arbitrum, which is like a roll up technology from off chain labs.
00:27:10.708 - 00:27:33.232, Speaker A: Optimistic roll up technology as the sushiswap L2 solution here. So, yeah, I mean, this is just another app on Ethereum looking at L2s to kind of adopt here. And I think it's great because obviously there's a race now to get onto L2. And I don't know, you know, if, if it's great that they were kind of fragmenting things, you know, maybe sushi swap should be on optimism with, with uniswap.
00:27:33.288 - 00:27:33.884, Speaker B: Right?
00:27:34.264 - 00:27:40.568, Speaker A: But maybe, you know, because they're competing with each other, they don't mind fragmenting the liquidity here. You know, who knows?
00:27:40.616 - 00:27:41.208, Speaker B: Right?
00:27:41.376 - 00:28:19.006, Speaker A: But there's, there's also bridges that are being spun up, too. So I think the fragmentation of liquidity is not going to be a big deal for very long as well. So, yeah, it's good to see another project kind of tackling L2 here. All right, so an interesting tweet from Mike Shinoda from Linkin park. So for those who don't know who this is, he is the Linkin park co founder and Lincoln Park. Linkin park is an extremely popular kind of rock band that's been around for a long time now, you know, and I think kind of like, it was interesting that he tweeted this out because he was tweeting about nfts. So he did like a thread on nfts and kind of like why he's finding them exciting and valuable.
00:28:19.006 - 00:28:46.270, Speaker A: And why I thought it was interesting was because this person is not like, into ethereum and defi, right? Like, as far as I know. And I've spoken about how Ethereum has a million different doors that you can enter its ecosystem in. And Mike is basically taking the door of nfTs. And I think a lot of people are taking the door of nfTs. And I think that NFTs have mainstream appeal faster than something like Defi does, because NFT covers, like, a broad spectrum of things that people are already used to, like art.
00:28:46.342 - 00:28:46.574, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:46.614 - 00:29:02.326, Speaker A: Like collectibles, like in game items. And NFTs aren't just those things. They're also other more technical stuff. But most people aren't interested in that. They're interested in those three things, art, collectibles, and in game items. So when you tap into that massive kind of existing user base that's already there.
00:29:02.390 - 00:29:02.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:03.374 - 00:29:12.966, Speaker A: You know, you. You get, like, kind of these famous people, you know, flooding in, essentially because, you know, a lot of the, I guess, defi stuff to the outside looks scammy, if I'm being honest.
00:29:13.030 - 00:29:13.458, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:13.566 - 00:29:28.794, Speaker A: You know, a lot of it, you know, some of it is scammy, to be fair, but a lot of it is kind of, like, confusing, too, because most people in the traditional kind of financial system, they defer to their kind of, like, banks, right? Or they're kind of brokers for.
00:29:28.834 - 00:29:28.962, Speaker B: To.
00:29:28.978 - 00:29:30.146, Speaker A: To do this stuff for them.
00:29:30.170 - 00:29:30.282, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:30.298 - 00:29:52.926, Speaker A: To do all the stuff we do in Defi for them. You know, no one's doing active kind of trading outside of, like, traders in the. In the real world. Like, it's not like people are their own bank or anything like that. Most people aren't. So, you know, I think Defi is going to take a bit longer to resonate with people, but nfts are immediately resonating with people, especially the art scene. So, yeah, I thought this was an interesting tweet from Mike here, and he's not the only celebrity that has been doing this.
00:29:52.926 - 00:30:34.464, Speaker A: There's been tons of them coming into the NFT space, and I think a lot of them are coming in as well because they can monetize their work. Now, there's this whole thing of, like, these centralized companies taking people's kind of work, monetizing it, and then leaving them with scraps. So why not just bypass them and kind of monetize it using an NFT or some other kind of digital rights system on Ethereum, which I thought was, you know, I think is a really cool and appealing thing for these people to, to kind of, you know, get on board with. So this is one of my favorite accounts, recent accounts that I followed on Twitter called documenting ethereum. You can go give this a follow. It'll be in the YouTube description. But basically, before they tweeted out a chart showing that ETH balances in exchanges are at a 16 month low.
00:30:34.464 - 00:31:20.936, Speaker A: So the amount of ETH in centralized exchanges hasn't been this low since the 9th of. Sorry, since September 2019, which is, yeah, as you said, 16 month low. So, I mean, you can see the kind of, like, collapse in Ethan exchanges here and how the price basically is tracking this pretty, you know, pretty closely here on the chart. So what, how much ETH you see? I think it's like 15.5 million or less than 15.5 million ETH in centralized exchanges right now, down from what is it, 19 million here? So about like 4 million ETH has been taken out of exchanges over the last, I guess you could say seven months, which is quite a lot of ETH, right? And this ETH is either going into smart contracts or it's going into cold storage, which I thought was really cool. But yeah, go give this account a follow.
00:31:20.936 - 00:31:47.520, Speaker A: It's definitely very valuable and they post a lot of interesting stuff. So DC investor posted this tweet just before, and I wrote about this in today's Deliware newsletter. But I'll read out the tweet for you. He basically says, and I quote, if one more person tells me governance tokens can't accrue value, I'll lose it. If you don't get it by now, you're not going to make it. Also, don't ask what I think about XYZ chain. If it doesn't have users or liquidity, it's irrelevant for all intents and purposes right now, end quote.
00:31:47.520 - 00:32:13.354, Speaker A: So I think DC was like me at the start of this video. He's going on a little bit of a rant here. I won't address the second part of his tweet. I just want to focus on the first part about people saying governance tokens can't accrue value. This to me is just like so silly because what do you think governance tokens do? They govern the platform. Okay, so if they govern the platform, don't you think that that gives them the right to vote in value accrual mechanisms for the token?
00:32:13.734 - 00:32:14.190, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:14.262 - 00:33:05.090, Speaker A: I mean, it does. So this is what I don't get when people say, oh, it's a governance token, it's worthless. Why would you buy it? I mean, you buy it now, right, when it's cheap, so that later on when the protocol keeps growing, the project keeps growing, and then eventually you, you get to like a point where the kind of like community agrees and the token holders agree that, okay, well, now it's time to turn on cash flows for token holders because the protocol is self sustaining, is generating a lot of fees. Let's pay this out to our token holders, right? What do you think is going to happen to the token price at that point? It's already going to be really high at that point, right? You have a chance to buy it cheaper when everyone's kind of calling it, you know, dead or whatever or calling it valueless, but, you know, and it's not just the value accrual that you can vote in. The governance tokens can literally vote on anything in a lot of these systems, so. And that's power, right? Governance is power. So I just, I mean, I'm the same as DC.
00:33:05.090 - 00:33:17.714, Speaker A: I get like, very frustrated when people kind of say this. I'm just like, you're missing the alpha, right? It's staring you in the face. Governance tokens are only called valueless by, you know, kind of the teams for regulatory reasons.
00:33:17.754 - 00:33:18.170, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:18.282 - 00:33:42.426, Speaker A: It is not a valueless token. It has a lot of value and will accrue more value into the future as long as the project's successful. I mean, as a clear example here, like, the clearest example I can think of, the Uniswap token. Uni has a fully validated market cap of $20 billion. It currently has no fees going to the token. There is no fee generation to the token. All protocol fees currently go to liquidity providers.
00:33:42.426 - 00:33:56.150, Speaker A: But the uni token holders and a lot of people buying uni are betting on fees being switched on at some point in the future. And they don't care when, they just know that there are plans and there was kind of like plans to turn it on in the future and it should happen.
00:33:56.222 - 00:33:56.430, Speaker B: Right?
00:33:56.462 - 00:34:31.371, Speaker A: So they're betting on that. So from that perspective, you have a DeFi protocol that I think is the most valuable on a fully diluted value basis that doesn't have any cash flows at all. So, you know, I don't want, I hope to not see people saying governance tokens can't accrue value for very much longer because this doesn't make much sense to me, basically. Okay, so on that note, I tweeted out something today that was, that was pretty bullish. And I'll read it. I said, I believe that the best DeFi protocols on Ethereum are going to be worth trillions of dollars someday. Don't let short term market move movements blind you to this reality.
00:34:31.371 - 00:35:09.526, Speaker A: It's a long term game, and we're still extremely early. Now, obviously over the weekend we had a bit of a cool off in the markets, right? ETH dipped to about $1500. Defi tokens dipped a bit more across the board, which was natural after we had such a big run up, I think, recently. But, you know, I saw some panic kind of on Twitter, you know, in some chat groups that I kind of frequent. And I was like, this is, this is weird. You know, if you zoom out, like a week ago, the prices are the same as that they what they were a week ago. So why are people panicking right now? And I think it's because there's a lot of short termism in this space where we're spoiled by how fast things can move that people often forget to kind of zoom out.
00:35:09.526 - 00:35:22.822, Speaker A: So, you know, I often, like, put out tweets about, like, zooming out. And I put out one the other day saying that ETH was $400 in November 2020. Yeah, yeah, $400 in November 2020. It's over $1600 today. Four times in three months.
00:35:22.878 - 00:35:23.474, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:24.054 - 00:35:43.230, Speaker A: So. And $400 seems very far away from $1600 as well. So. And that's only ETH, right, not to count all these other Defi tokens. You know, at the bottom of the bear, of the DeFi summer bear, I think Aave was $26. It's almost $500 today. You know, I can keep going on and listing through all these examples, but I won't.
00:35:43.230 - 00:35:56.934, Speaker A: I think my main point here is that because we're rebuilding the financial system, because the new financial system has a total addressable market of the entire world, because we have protocols that are already generating a lot of cash flows for token holders.
00:35:57.014 - 00:35:57.634, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:58.254 - 00:36:18.222, Speaker A: I think these tokens, at least some of them, are going to be worth trillions of dollars someday. And I'm not going to say which are, because I don't know for sure. I have my bets like everyone else, but no one knows for sure. But with these protocols or when, I mean, I shouldn't say if, I should say when these protocols take over the traditional finance system, a lot of them will basically be worth trillions of dollars.
00:36:18.278 - 00:36:18.494, Speaker B: Right?
00:36:18.534 - 00:36:38.414, Speaker A: I mean, if you look at some of the top companies in the world today, like Apple and Google and Microsoft and things like that, they're worth high hundreds of billions of dollars or in the trillions of dollars in terms of market cap. And you know, even just comparing it to, like, banks and things like that, banks are, banks are in the hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap and banks are actually siloed.
00:36:38.454 - 00:36:38.606, Speaker B: Right?
00:36:38.630 - 00:37:03.876, Speaker A: They're not, they're not global. They're siloed within, you know, usually within their own country sort of thing. So, yeah, I think just zooming out a bit here. And as I said, I think this, this space suffers from short termism. I think zooming out even like a few months is going to give you an amazing picture. And when you're investing in this space, you should always invest in something with like a kind of, I guess, like multi year timeframe. You should never buy something as an investment, right.
00:37:03.876 - 00:37:30.302, Speaker A: You can buy it as a trade and kind of like, say, I'm gonna hold it for a week and then sell it. But you should never kind of invest in something and say, okay, I'm going to hold this for a week and then sell it, right? Unless it's like, unless you're a trader, if you're a fundamentals based investor, then you're investing in stuff. When you think it's like a good time to get in and you're thinking to yourself, I'm going to hold this for years. I don't care how much it dips during that time. I believe in this project. I think it's going to go far. I think they have like a kick ass team, all that sort of stuff, right.
00:37:30.302 - 00:38:02.088, Speaker A: And I think it's going to bring us to the promised land, right? Essentially. And if you did this with a lot of the top defi tokens a year ago, you would be very wealthy right now. Like, if I'm being honest, like even if you only put in like, you know, a small amount of money, you would have made a lot just from like the top Defi protocols today. You know, Aave Synthetix, you know, compound all these sorts of things. I mean, maybe not compound so much because it launched later, but I guess tokens that have been around for a while that were kind of active back then, even like sushi, if you invested in that towards the end of last year, it was like sixty cents, fourteen dollars now.
00:38:02.216 - 00:38:02.744, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:02.864 - 00:38:38.914, Speaker A: So investing things with more of like a multi month, multi year timeframe rather than like a short timeframe. And that's not, again, that's not investment advice. That's just like, I think should be common sense among, you know, people who are investing in this space is that short termism leads to pain because, you know, you might see like a massive dip happen and be like, oh, wow, that's dipped a lot. Now what's going to happen? Like, are we going to, is it going to keep crashing? And you, you know, if you sell because of that, it means you didn't really invest based on fundamentals. You invested based on pure speculative, speculative reasons. So that's, to me, a losing strategy, I think. All right, finally here.
00:38:38.914 - 00:39:01.944, Speaker A: So I spoke last week about how L2 decentralized exchange volume is going to catch up to layer one volume. And I think it's going to happen quite quickly. And last week I mentioned that loopring was doing $10 million of 24 hours volume. Well, as of today, it's already doing $25 million of 24 hours volume. Yep. That's, that's over two to two x growth in a week already. And that's because they added more pairs to the exchange.
00:39:01.944 - 00:39:42.108, Speaker A: They have a liquidity mining program going. A lot of people that are getting priced out by the gas fees and moving to L2s on Ethereum. So, yeah, I think that was just like, really great validation of what I was talking about last week, about how L2 exchanges are going to grow much faster than people think they will. And we'll get to a point where they like, you know, basically as kind of big as their layer one counterparts. And we'll have like, a very nice and bustling ecosystem between layer one and L2 where kind of the people who kind of, I guess most people who can't afford the high gas fees on layer one still get the kind of benefits and experience of defi at L2. So, yeah, just wanted to point that out, but I know I've gone way over time here. I think this is the longest refuel I've ever done.
00:39:42.108 - 00:39:56.234, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm going to. I'm going to stop that there for now. So, yeah. Thank you, everyone, for watching and listening. I really appreciate it.

00:39:56.234 - 00:39:56.674, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
