00:00:00.840 - 00:00:34.104, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first episode of the daily grade data pump. These episodes will be coming out once a month, and they'll be focused on the on chain data of Ethereum for the previous month, as this is the first episode. However, I'm going to be covering the last few months worth of growth to give you some context around what I'll be covering in future episodes as well. So let's get right into it. Okay? The first site that I'm going to be using to show a bunch of different metrics is called glass node. They have a really nice little studio here where they have a bunch of different metrics. Some are paid, some are free.
00:00:34.104 - 00:01:26.062, Speaker A: Obviously the best metrics are paid, but we can still have a look at some of the great metrics here and make sure that we cover them in depth. So one of the metrics that I look at the most is the number of active addresses on Ethereum. Now, this chart here goes all the way back to 2015. So glass note actually has like a bunch of rich data here going back, you know, as far as basically the main net of Ethereum being launched in mid 2015, which really gives some really nice context here. So you can see, you know, obviously during 2017, we had this massive spike of active Ethereum addresses. So, you know, these are addresses every day that are active on the Ethereum network, whether that's sending ETH, interacting with a smart contract, interacting with a DeFi protocol, sending tokens, you know, anything like that. That's what counts as an active address, right? And it tends to follow price.
00:01:26.062 - 00:02:21.698, Speaker A: You can see the price here in black and then the active addresses in blue. You can see, you know, how it pretty much tracks, tracks price, but sometimes, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it'll go off base there, but generally it tracks the price. And what's been really cool to see over the last few months is that, you know, the active addresses on Ethereum have started to go up again, right? You can see, I guess during 2018 and 2019, they kind of remained in this, this pattern of like a sideways movement with a bit of spikes here and there along with price. But now, because of all the activity that we're seeing on chain, on Ethereum, especially within the Defi sector, we're seeing like more sustained growth here. You can see in 2017, it was like a shot, shot up really, really fast and then came back down, you know, just as fast. And that's simply because of the price action, of course, now, because the ETH price has actually been trending up a lot slower over the last few months, especially during 2017, sorry, during 2020, the.
00:02:21.698 - 00:02:39.722, Speaker A: The active addresses have actually been going up in a much healthier way, which is really, really awesome to see. You know, you can see here, though, that, you know, we had Defi summer during June, July, August, and then coming off of August and September was like the kind of defi bear market, and then October was a bit. Was a bit of a better month.
00:02:39.778 - 00:02:39.970, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:40.002 - 00:02:54.002, Speaker A: And we started recovering and then onto November as well. So, yeah, I expect this to keep going up as the market heats up. Of course, as I said, this tends to track price, but also as we get more and more users kind of using all these different protocols on Ethereum.
00:02:54.058 - 00:02:54.736, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:54.930 - 00:03:04.508, Speaker A: You know, we didn't have a lot of this in 2017. I'd wager that a lot of this activity here was, can actually be attributed to both just the price going up, of course, and also something like cryptokitties.
00:03:04.556 - 00:03:05.148, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:05.316 - 00:03:32.850, Speaker A: Cryptokitties had a ton of unique users coming in, especially from outside of crypto, and trying this new thing out. So, yeah, really interesting to see that there. But this is one metric that I do keep a very close eye on because I think it's pretty interesting. Another one that I like to keep an eye on is the ethereum number of addresses with a balance of more than 0.1 ETH. So this is the seven day moving average here. This is very interesting because 0.1
00:03:32.850 - 00:03:36.850, Speaker A: ETH is. Is worth different, you know, amounts at different times.
00:03:36.922 - 00:03:37.250, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:37.322 - 00:04:02.572, Speaker A: You know, today, when ETH is dollar 600, 0.1 ETH is worth dollar 60, whereas when ETH is dollar 100, 0.1 ETH is worth dollar ten, for example. So I think tracking it at today's price is, is quite accurate. It kind of shows the distribution of holders in increasing or decreasing. So you can actually see through basically the entire bear market of 2018 and 2019. This barely moved, right.
00:04:02.572 - 00:04:11.052, Speaker A: Even though the price did a bunch of different things here, the amount of people holding 0.1 ETH or more stayed relatively flat.
00:04:11.108 - 00:04:11.468, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:11.556 - 00:04:35.437, Speaker A: Whereas 2017, we obviously saw an explosion because that was kind of Ethereum's year, but we're seeing the same thing play out in 2020. Now, it's interesting because more analysis is needed here, more deeper analysis with a lot more rich, richer data. But, you know, this 0.1 ETH being $60, you know, a few months ago, it was like $30, $40. This could be people were just using ETH as gas as well.
00:04:35.485 - 00:04:35.717, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:35.765 - 00:04:49.134, Speaker A: Doesn't necessarily mean people are holding ETH, you know, dollar 60 worth of ETH for example, as an investment or whatever. They're definitely using it for gas within different addresses that they're using. And, and obviously this is because of Defi.
00:04:49.214 - 00:04:49.742, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:49.878 - 00:05:18.516, Speaker A: But in saying that the holders of 0.1 ETH or more went up before the defi craze, so it actually just started trending up in 2020. And that's, I think because, you know, the ETH price actually started recovering quite well and we broke out of this kind of, you know, sideways market and it's been going up since then. But I'd be very curious to see how many people are simply just buying ETH, transferring it to their address and doing a bunch of Defi things, because obviously you need to pay for gas.
00:05:18.580 - 00:05:19.212, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:19.388 - 00:05:45.368, Speaker A: But still, very interesting metric. I think we're going to see a healthier growth here. You know, you can see here, I guess, towards the end, it's come down a little bit here. Not sure why that is, but it's not, you know, unheard of. There was a little bit of a kind of downtrend here, and then we started going back up again. You know, I expect to see this continue to go up, to be honest, as we keep going. You know, there's other metrics as well for this.
00:05:45.368 - 00:05:52.352, Speaker A: Like you can do, you know, addresses with a balance of more than one ETH, for example. And this has continued up as well. But this is obviously a lot more.
00:05:52.408 - 00:05:52.624, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:52.664 - 00:06:09.088, Speaker A: This is over $600 at time of recording of ETH, and. But that's still trended up, which is really cool. And then, you know, there's metrics for every kind of denomination here, or most of them anyway. So addresses with more than 10,000 ETH, which is basically going to be whale addresses.
00:06:09.136 - 00:06:09.776, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:09.960 - 00:06:19.016, Speaker A: That started trending up recently. A lot. So there's some. Some whales definitely accumulating ETH since. Since November, which I think we can see reflected in the price.
00:06:19.080 - 00:06:19.684, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:19.984 - 00:06:28.304, Speaker A: There's a lot of price movement with, with ETH, you know, in, let's see, when it bottomed here, ETH price was 450. And then up here it's now 600.
00:06:28.384 - 00:06:29.004, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:29.744 - 00:06:52.762, Speaker A: And then we can say similar things when there's, when there's been other price movements here. So, yeah, that basically tracks whale addresses. And then down here, unfortunately, I can't view here these, which I think are actually more accurate metrics, but they're on the t three plan, which is, which is more expensive from. From glass node. I don't have that plan, unfortunately. But basically you'd be able to see, you know, addresses with a balance of more than, you know, $1 million.
00:06:52.818 - 00:06:53.202, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:53.298 - 00:07:14.916, Speaker A: Regardless of the amount of ETH, it is, it's, it is what it is worth. And actually, I think if I click in here, I can actually see the data. It's just stops. Yeah. So I can only see the data up to a year ago back, basically. So I can't see anything after that, which is kind of useless when we're trying to do kind of on chain analysis here for recent, recent events. But still, I mean, it gives you some kind of context, I guess.
00:07:14.916 - 00:08:03.740, Speaker A: But obviously this is going to follow the price a lot more than the metrics of just the single ETH being in someone's account or ten ETH or 10,000 ETH or what have you. So both relevant metrics, but unfortunately, I can't show you the up to date with these today. Maybe in the next episode I'll have access to those metrics and I'll be able to show you. Yeah, as I said, you know, I just showed you the 10,000 ETH balance for, for, for whales and I explained kind of the implications there, this one. So, so this is funny. I put a tweet out about this. Sorry, this metric here with the percent of supply in smart contracts a little bit ago, and I actually had a comparison chart where I show the percent of the supply and smart contracts versus the percent of the supply of ETH in centralized exchanges.
00:08:03.740 - 00:08:06.124, Speaker A: And they were basically kind of like opposite of each other.
00:08:06.164 - 00:08:06.532, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:06.628 - 00:08:26.894, Speaker A: Smart contracts go up, exchanges go down. And obviously, I mean, this is very obvious. It's because of what happened with DeFi Summer. You can see right here, you know, I, I'm pretty sure compounds, liquidity mining launched like June 15 or something like that, which was what kicked off the defi bull market. And then you can see the explosion here.
00:08:26.934 - 00:08:27.134, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:27.174 - 00:08:42.302, Speaker A: And it's followed down as well with, with the kind of like, I guess petering off of the DeFi market, too. So, but that's still like a trend that's much better than what kind of what we've seen in the past. You can see here, it was like flat for like the entire time here.
00:08:42.358 - 00:08:42.598, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:42.646 - 00:09:00.358, Speaker A: Flat or down. There was no real movements that were worth mentioning or anything like that. You know, it's funny because, you know, in smart contracts, which I'm sure if I contrast this with the one of, of, of supply in exchanges, centralized exchanges, we would see it go up and that kind of tracks price as well.
00:09:00.406 - 00:09:00.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:01.374 - 00:09:42.900, Speaker A: But then on top of that, you know, you can see here back in 2016, that of this massive spike here. And I'm sure you, you know, the, the people that have been around long enough can guess exactly what this is, right? But for those who don't know, this is the Dow smart contract. So the Dow was an ICO essentially in 2016 that kind of blew up spectacularly and resulted in the hard fork that spawned Ethereum. Classic for Ethereum, on Ethereum. But this is really funny whenever I look at this, right? Look how quickly this contract managed to get almost 25% of all ETH. You know, obviously there were other smart contracts at the time, but there was no DeFi or anything. It was predominantly the Dow.
00:09:42.900 - 00:10:26.998, Speaker A: So if we look here, we can see, maybe we can see here from what it was at the start of 2016, February 2016, it was 4.54%, 4.39%. And then here it was 23% ish in, in June. So I guess like six months, five months. And then as soon as the, the kind of like the exploit or hack happened, you know, you dumped all the way back down, but didn't go back to where it was, it went to like 10%. And then we see a kind of rise here and we see like a steady kind of rise here and then just like sideways, which is surprising because, you know, there was ETH being sent to icos. But since this only tracks smart contracts, I think a lot of ICO operators didn't use smart contracts to handle their ETH.
00:10:26.998 - 00:10:47.220, Speaker A: It was just done to a normal ethereum address. So that explains that. And then the brutal bear market that ETH experienced during 2019 explains this, because I'm pretty sure a lot of this will ETH would have gone to exchanges. But now with Defi, there's no reason to keep your ETH on a centralized exchange, you know, doing nothing, you can just put it in Defi and earn a much better yield on it.
00:10:47.252 - 00:10:47.824, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:48.324 - 00:10:55.580, Speaker A: And also in ETH two, I don't think this tracks the supply in ETH two. So that could explain this drop as well.
00:10:55.652 - 00:10:55.860, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:55.892 - 00:11:39.416, Speaker A: A lot of people exiting Defi going to ETH two, and then uniswap liquidity mining ending as well, would explain this drop of ETH, which I'll show a bit more about later. Another one of my favorite charts here on glass nodes is the Ethereum Hodl waves chart. Now, what this shows, it basically shows the holding periods of ETH over, I guess, like ten years. It's been around for like six years. So if I go here, I can break it down for you. So obviously, ETH is not over seven years old, so you know, anything over seven years is 0% of the ETH supply there. But when we go to five to seven years, this shows that 4.14%
00:11:39.416 - 00:11:43.398, Speaker A: of the ETH supply hasn't moved in over five years.
00:11:43.486 - 00:11:43.710, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:43.742 - 00:12:10.072, Speaker A: Between five and seven years, but basically over five years. So that's, you know, that could be ETH that's being held by a bunch of long term holders that literally don't ever want to sell their ETH, for example. Or maybe they sold some of it and kept more of it in their genesis address. Could be ETH that's lost, for example. Could be ETH that was that stuck for whatever other reason. So that's a. That's a pretty sizable chunk of the supply, right? 4%, the total eat supply.
00:12:10.072 - 00:12:22.528, Speaker A: And then, you know, you can make your way down the list. You have over three years. So between three and five years, 18% of the supply hasn't been moved. So three years ago was like, what is it, 2017? Yeah, 27 late 2017.
00:12:22.616 - 00:12:23.128, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:23.256 - 00:12:55.524, Speaker A: And then even further than that. Like, these people, they must have seen the 2017 bull market and not have sold a lot of this eat, which is. Which is amazing to me, to be honest. Like, you know, they would have bought this ethanol back when it was much cheaper, maybe at like, $10 or something like that. Or this could just be a lot of people who bought ETH at, you know, during the mania and then have forgotten about it because they're like, I crashed, you know, ethereum is dead, whatever. But it's interesting to see that's such a high percentage still. And then we move on to two to three years, 16%, another high percentage, you know, one to two years is almost 20%.
00:12:55.524 - 00:13:23.774, Speaker A: And then we can keep moving down the list. But if we want to talk about, like, the active supply of ethics, I think, you know, I guess maybe six months or less, I would consider active supply anything longer than that. You know, I mean, it's either exchanges having user balances on. On their. On the exchange, of course, which kind of muddies the water here. But in terms of, like, moving it around on chain and doing things with it, I guess the active supply of ETH is less than, you know, that six months worth. Yeah.
00:13:23.774 - 00:14:06.754, Speaker A: So that's about quick math here. 25% or the total eat supply is actually active, moving around, doing things. But that doesn't mean it's on, like, you know, it's being sold or anything like that. It could be being used in Defi's collateral, all that sorts of stuff, you know, because of the fact that this chart just shows you, like, raw numbers. It doesn't actually give you any, you know, nuance or context around what the eats actually doing. It's kind of hard to draw too many conclusions from this, but I do like to look at the number, you know, over five years increasing, because that means it's kind of pretty much definitely either lost long term holder or locked exchanges usually refresh their addresses a lot more frequently than this, like centralized exchanges. So they will have moved their ETH.
00:14:06.754 - 00:14:23.880, Speaker A: Like, you know, there was a lot of noise about Coinbase doing this a few years ago or a couple years ago now where they moved their cold storage. So that wouldn't reflect in more than five years. And you can actually see on the chart that, you know, obviously this didn't kick in until recently. It was basically kicked in this year.
00:14:23.992 - 00:14:24.288, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:24.336 - 00:15:07.900, Speaker A: July 2020 it kicked in and then immediately there was like 3.3% that hadn't been moved, and since then it would have gone up to 4.15%. So almost an extra percentage it hasn't been moved. And obviously that'll keep increasing over time, I suspect, unless, you know, some, some people decide to move it and then it just goes into. It just kind of like cancels it out there. This is a very interesting chart, one that I pay attention to a lot, especially the, the moot, you know, the active supply going down. You know, eventually, I expect 25% of the ETH supply being moved in the last six months actually become less and less, especially as the ETH price goes up and as people, you know, need less and less money to do certain things, like, I guess, paying.
00:15:07.900 - 00:15:16.890, Speaker A: Paying fees and doing things in defi and stuff like that. So interesting to see. Again, this probably doesn't take into account ethanol, definitely doesn't take into account ETH.
00:15:16.922 - 00:15:17.090, Speaker B: Two.
00:15:17.122 - 00:15:41.368, Speaker A: But that's kind of irrelevant, I think, here. But yeah, another interesting chart for sure. This is really, really interesting as well. So this is basically, I guess, like a chart that shows what stage of the market ETH is in. Now, this was originally done for bitcoin, but it's obviously applied to ETH as well. It's called the net unrealized profit loss indicator or the Knapple indicator.
00:15:41.506 - 00:15:41.996, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:42.100 - 00:16:35.520, Speaker A: So what this does is, I'll just read the description down here because it's a little bit complex, this one. But basically nupple is the difference between the relative unrealized profit and relative unrealized lost. So this metric is basically used to calculate, I guess, like people in profit versus people in loss. And then from there they kind of measure what the sentiment of the market is, right? So you can measure from capitulation to that's basically when, like, all people have lost hope, right? You know, when ETH went to $80, everyone was like, wow, okay, is this ever going to stop bleeding? And then you get, like, that sinking feeling when you see that that is capitulation. Hope or fear is basically what happens when there's been a recovery from the bottom, right. And then you kind of, like, have hope that it's going to keep recovering, but you're also scared that it's not. So it's not, you know, you know, you're not out of the woods yet, so to speak.
00:16:35.520 - 00:17:05.052, Speaker A: Optimism and anxiety is similar where, you know, you've seen the price and it keeps going up and there hasn't been any major dumps, and you're optimistic, right? But you're also anxious because you're like, oh, no, you know, maybe it's gonna go back down again. It's done at every other, every other point in time. And then you move on to the belief and denial stage, which is in green here, which is actually what we're in right now. And I actually feel this because I believe that we're in another bull market, and so do a lot of the people that I talk to and know. But at the same time, we're kind of in denial about it, right?
00:17:05.148 - 00:17:05.380, Speaker B: We've.
00:17:05.412 - 00:17:44.324, Speaker A: We've experienced the whole bear market, and we're still in denial. We're like, you know, we can't believe eats at $600 again after so long, you know, and that's kind of like, what we're at, what we are there. And then, of course, the end state is euphoria and greed. Now, definitely felt this at the end of 2017, right, where everyone was euphoric and super greedy. Everyone was making, you know, amazing profits, just throwing, you know, money or whatever it was. And that wasn't, you know, going to last, right. And what this metric tends to do is to show you that when we reach these levels, it's probably time to take profit, right? You can actually see how it follows the price pretty, pretty accurately.
00:17:44.324 - 00:18:15.950, Speaker A: You know, it's hard to know if this is a leading or lagging indicator, right? If you wait for this indicator, you know, say this indicator turns, like here, euphoria and greed, right? Back in 2017, they turned that when ETH went to, like $700. So if you had sold there, you would have obviously sold too early and missed another two times. But at the same time, this didn't last very long. ETH went from $700 on December, on January, like 14th. So a little bit less than a month.
00:18:16.102 - 00:18:16.534, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:16.614 - 00:18:19.142, Speaker A: And then from there, it just, like, went down very hard.
00:18:19.238 - 00:18:19.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:20.334 - 00:18:31.888, Speaker A: So this can be used to top, but to spot tops and bottoms. I actually think it's a better indicator to spot the top because if you look here and try to spot a bottom. Right, you down here.
00:18:31.936 - 00:18:32.240, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:32.312 - 00:19:00.052, Speaker A: I guess, like, this indicator started turning to capitulation when ETH was like, $300. And it kept going back down to, like, almost dollar 80 here. So if you were just looking at this and said, okay, I'm going to buy it, dollar 300, then you would have bought, you know, you wouldn't have bought the bottom or anywhere near the bottom. You would have bought there and you would have had to wait right after this dump. You would have had to wait until. So you would have bought at $300, which was September 2018. You would have had to wait almost a year.
00:19:00.052 - 00:19:30.692, Speaker A: I think $300 was up. Yeah, yeah. June 2019 to, you know, break even on your, on your investment, $300. But then if you kept holding, you would have seen another drawdown, and then you would have had to wait until. Until February 2020 again. Then you would have seen another drawdown due to the coronavirus dump, as it's come to be known. And then you would have been in profit, a total profit, where you are now and still in profit in July 2020.
00:19:30.692 - 00:20:05.474, Speaker A: So we have September 2018 to July 2020, almost two years of holding through this brutal, you know, bear market being in profit, bear market being in profit, bear market. I mean, I guess, you know, during the bear market, like, dumps finally being in profit. And this is why you go through the motions, right? This is why the emotions are coming to it. And this is why this indicator can actually work so well. So it's one that I'm going to be keeping my eye on. I don't like that we've flipped green already, to be honest. It's kind of scary, right? If you look at previous kind of greens, they usually turn blue quite quickly.
00:20:05.474 - 00:20:56.908, Speaker A: And, you know, I guess, like if we, if we look at 2017 specifically, we can see that it flipped green when ETH was like, I think, $15 or something, and then it flipped blue with ETH at $50, which obviously, you know, it came back down a little bit, like a tiny bit here, but didn't really mean anything. And then it flipped blue again when ETH went to, like, dollar 70. And then it kept blue until ETH was like, I think, dollar 420 during that first pump into June. So yeah, this indicator is kind of reliable, but it's probably gonna make you sell too early if you pay too close attention to it. So, you know, if you're using it, just be ready for that for sure. All right, and next, very interesting kind of metric here is the total transfer volume for ETH on Ethereum. So this doesn't include tokens, it's just ETH.
00:20:56.908 - 00:21:35.930, Speaker A: So as you can see, it's kind of, it kind of followers follows price as well. Obviously we had, you know, in 20 at the, basically the end of the last bull market, and we had a huge amount of value being transacted on chain. I think it topped at like $20 billion in January of 2018. And then we obviously had like, and this is heavily affected by price. And then we had like a kind of a dump here where it went from $20 billion and bottomed out at like 146 million here and then kind of bottomed out around here again, but kind of went sideways, right, with the price. And then up here we've gone up to almost $2 billion. I think over here it's even higher.
00:21:35.930 - 00:22:09.388, Speaker A: But the market has changed, right? Ethereum has changed. It's no longer lots of ETH transfers on chain to transfer value. It's also stable coins. The stablecoin transfer volume is more than this now, I think, more than the 20 billion. So if you're looking at just the ETH transferred on chain and kind of, and kind of inferring stuff from that, it's not accurate anymore. You know, stable coins, other tokens on Ethereum. Once that is included in the mix, Ethereum is actually losing to those in terms of transfer volume, which is actually a good thing for ETH as an asset.
00:22:09.388 - 00:22:47.620, Speaker A: It means ETH is being used more as like a store of value, collateral asset, capital kind of asset, more than like, you know, money or something like that. More than like used to transfer value across the network, increasing its velocity, which potentially increases its sell pressure as well. So that's a very interesting metric there. And I am, I'm pretty, I mean, I keep an eye on this, but at the same time I like to, to look at the total token transfers as well, especially stable coins, rather than just the ETH transferred. Alright, that's it for the glass node metrics. Let's move on to the into the block metrics. Now, these are again paid metrics, a lot of them as well, unfortunately.
00:22:47.620 - 00:23:12.960, Speaker A: But I have an account here, so I can show you them. So basically this is my favorite metric for, for ETH holders by far. What this does is it measures how many people are in or out of the money when holding ETH. And they have this for a bunch of other tokens as well. But obviously, I'll just focus on ETH for today. Now, you can see this in terms of, like, the addresses in profit and the volume that's in profit. So let's focus on the addresses.
00:23:12.960 - 00:23:27.938, Speaker A: So at each price point, you know, the majority of the kind of ETH will be in or out of the money. So you can imagine when we were back here, when ETH was under $163, the majority of the people holding ETH were out of the money.
00:23:28.026 - 00:23:28.274, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:28.314 - 00:23:41.722, Speaker A: Which means they were in a loss. They were. They were sitting on their hands. They were like, wow, okay, once this goes up again, I'm going to sell, right? Because they're scared. They want to get out of their position. They don't want to sell at a loss. So as soon as it breaks even or gets close to breaking even, they sell.
00:23:41.722 - 00:24:07.584, Speaker A: And this is exactly why bear markets are so brutal and lasts so long, is because you need to flush out everyone or most of the people who. Who bought at. Who are at a loss. You need to flush them all out. You need to make sure that you get a new set of buyers in that have a lower cost basis than the old buyers, and then the price can start moving up. And that's exactly what we've seen. You can see right here that at $600, 87% of all ETH holders are in profit.
00:24:07.704 - 00:24:08.152, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:08.248 - 00:24:21.484, Speaker A: Where's the sell pressure? The other, like, 12% or whatever it is, or. Sorry. There's also the. At the money here, as you can see, is 2%. So let's. Let's include that. So that's people that are just, like, bought at around $600.
00:24:21.484 - 00:24:27.828, Speaker A: So let's say it's. It's almost 90% that is in the money. There's 10% of tokens left that are at a loss.
00:24:27.956 - 00:24:28.364, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:28.444 - 00:24:37.924, Speaker A: All the way up to 1400 or 1340 here. Are they going to sell when we keep going higher? Maybe. Can the market absorb that? Yes, it can, because that's not much of the supply.
00:24:38.004 - 00:24:38.388, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:38.476 - 00:24:54.564, Speaker A: That is definitely not many people that are going to be selling. And we're in. We're in a more of a bull market now, Ethan, $600 is incredibly bullish because we haven't seen that in such a long time. So this is the perfect indicator to see how many, you know, for lack of a better term, bag holders there are.
00:24:54.604 - 00:24:54.804, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:54.844 - 00:25:08.132, Speaker A: How many? How much sell pressure there is how many people are waiting to sell. So that's why I love this. Love looking at this. I check it regularly, you know, because it's just great. And obviously this will change over time as people buy and sell.
00:25:08.188 - 00:25:08.404, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:08.444 - 00:25:38.354, Speaker A: The cost basis are reset. You see people in and out of the money at different price points and things like that. So yeah, one of my favorite metrics. Go check out into the block as well if you want to check out this metric. I'm going to link all these stuff in the, in the description, of course. But yeah, one of my favorite metrics there, then they break them down. They have like in, out of the money around price based on, based on different things, like I guess like the recent price, right? So over $500 up to like $700.
00:25:38.354 - 00:26:01.890, Speaker A: So this is more of a laser focused view, you know, because this is more of a broader view, right. It covers the whole spectrum from like $0 to the all time high, whereas this will cover just like five hundred dollars to seven hundred dollars. So it gives you a better idea. And it's still, most of the people are in the, in the money here as well. And then there's just a different visualization down the bottom here so you can see, you know, how it's turned green. And because of that, the price has been able to go up.
00:26:01.962 - 00:26:02.266, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:02.330 - 00:26:06.018, Speaker A: When the prop, when it's mostly red, the price can't go up as I, as I explained.
00:26:06.106 - 00:26:06.540, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:06.642 - 00:26:45.628, Speaker A: So very interesting metric. I love looking at this. Definitely go check it out and into the block also has a really cool defi insight section. These defi metrics are different to a lot of the ones that I've seen out there. So, you know, you can see an aggregated defi tokens market cap here of the top defi tokens, including wrapped bitcoin. So they have wrapped bitcoin, dai, aave, uniswap, wyun and like a bunch of others. So it's funny how much wrapped bitcoin dominates here, right? I don't know if I'd call that a defi token because it's really just like an IOU token for bitcoin, but it kind of like dwarfs the other, the other tokens because we've seen so much bitcoin come to Ethereum lately.
00:26:45.628 - 00:27:21.202, Speaker A: But that's one metric that's, that's cool to keep an eye on and see how much it's kind of increasing over time. These metrics are very new. That's why it only goes back to November. They just recently released this, but still cool to see you have Defi tokens to Ethereum market cap ratio. So I'm sure, I mean unfortunately this data doesn't go back further enough, but I'm sure if you get, you go back you'll see that it's kind of like Ethereum's dominance is, is much higher than kind of what it is is now. Right, because we've got a lot more Defi tokens having a larger market cap and things like that. So another, another really cool thing to see there, bunch of, you know, metrics that everyone's used to here.
00:27:21.202 - 00:27:36.938, Speaker A: Total value locked. The top five value locked as well between the top five defray protocols. So you can actually see, you know, if money is going out of one protocol into another, things like that. I would like to see more coverage here though. The top five doesn't really tell the whole story.
00:27:37.026 - 00:27:37.490, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:37.602 - 00:28:02.542, Speaker A: If you, you know, you can say uniswap went down here a lot. Where did that liquidity go? Well you put sushi swap on this chart and you see sushi swap get a lot of that liquidity, right. Aetherium supplier locked is another really cool metric here. So obviously this is just ETH locked in defi. Same with bitcoin locked in Defi. They've got really cool things like a gas cost heat map. So you can actually check the average gas cost.
00:28:02.542 - 00:28:43.188, Speaker A: And when's the best time to send a transaction based on UTC? You know, when's the cheapest time. I use this quite regularly if I want to do some transactions that aren't urgent. You know, you can switch to the 28 day view here and look at that as well, obviously like, you know, maybe this is at a time when you're sleeping or something. Unfortunately it actually is for a lot of the Americans because I noticed that during the US working hours it's definitely more expensive to do transactions. But typically weekends are the best times to do it. And you know, you can see here or late at night, right, as well. So weekends and late at night, it's like the perfect combo.
00:28:43.188 - 00:29:07.510, Speaker A: And by late at night I mean like us based and things like that. I'm lucky because I'm in Australia, I'm basically on the opposite side of the world. So my transactions are usually pretty cheap at certain times, which is really cool. And then yeah, a bunch of different metrics here as well. I won't go through all of them today, but yeah, there's a lot here to unpack basically. So if you want to go check this out, definitely go and check this out. It's free right.
00:29:07.510 - 00:29:12.954, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure it's free. You can go to the into the block website and check this out. I'll link it in the description as well.
00:29:14.334 - 00:29:14.774, Speaker B: All right.
00:29:14.814 - 00:30:04.948, Speaker A: Another really interesting chart I like to keep an eye on is the coin metrics correlation chart between bitcoin and ethereum. So things usually tend to correlate during a bear market or during, like, a dump, right? So we saw that play out at the beginning of 2020 with, I mean, like, with the crypto asset class correlating with the traditional asset class. Now, this is because, you know, when everything's risk off, people go to cash, right? They don't go to other risk on assets. No one goes from, like, bitcoin to ethereum or ethereum to bitcoin when they want to be risk off in, like, a, in like, an event that we saw in March of 2020 during the coronavirus uncertainty. They want to go to cash, and that's why things correlate. But then during a bull market, things tend to lose their correlation because people are risk on, they're going into different assets. They're happy doing that.
00:30:04.948 - 00:30:17.634, Speaker A: They feel better about it. And we can see this reflected in the chart. You can see, during 2017, the correlation between Ethan BTC was basically, like, very, very low, you know, almost non existent.
00:30:17.754 - 00:30:18.178, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:18.266 - 00:30:34.506, Speaker A: And that played out in the price, too. ETH vastly outperformed bitcoin in 2017, especially the first half of the year. It almost flipped it right on the ratio there. But then, as you see, as kind of, ETH kept going up and up and getting a better, bigger market cap.
00:30:34.570 - 00:30:34.818, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:34.866 - 00:30:39.790, Speaker A: And then we have the 2018 bear market. The correlation shot all the way up.
00:30:39.882 - 00:30:40.206, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:40.270 - 00:30:56.014, Speaker A: The correlation was almost 0.9. So that basically means that they're almost 100% correlated. Bitcoin and ethereum. And this. And this remained very high during the bear market. During the entire bear market, basically. And just until recently, did it start going below this.
00:30:56.014 - 00:31:35.648, Speaker A: So it actually lasted from July 2018 to September 2020, basically. And what this signifies is basically, once it starts going down like this, I think it starts to signify that we're in a bull market and the market's feeling more bullish. I expect this correlation to go down even more as we keep going, especially because I expect ETH to outperform bitcoin during a bull market. We're going to see this happen. And you can map these correlations across any coin against bitcoin, since bitcoin tends to lead the crypto market, and you'll see similar patterns play out. So, very interesting chart. From coinmetrics here, one of my favorites on, on their site.
00:31:35.648 - 00:31:45.372, Speaker A: And I use it quite regularly as well. And this is based on the 180 day moving average, too. So if I actually shorten this to like 30 days, the chart gets a. Gets very messy.
00:31:45.468 - 00:31:46.108, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:46.276 - 00:32:17.288, Speaker A: So that's why I don't like, like to kind of do that. So if you like, take a longer time frame, look, it's much better. Like 180 days is six months. So you can see the six month kind of like correlations here, which, in my view, is a better way to measure these things. All right, another one here is really interesting from, I guess, the block here. They have a really cool on chain data section you can see here. If I go out to all what this basically shows is that the Ethereum miner revenue, daily miner revenue over time.
00:32:17.288 - 00:32:58.042, Speaker A: So obviously, this is going to follow the price, right? But I don't want to focus on the actual miner revenue from the block subsidy. That is the new new ETH generated from mining blocks. I want to focus on the transaction fee revenue. So the transaction fee revenue on this chart is in red here. That is the highest it's ever been and continues to be high because we saw the transaction fees on Ethereum spike so high, right. In some days during the, I guess the DeFi summer, the transaction fees on the network were actually higher than the block subsidy to miners. So they were making more from fees than they were from, from the newly generated ETH coming out, which was quite insane.
00:32:58.042 - 00:33:01.146, Speaker A: You know, even in 2017, this wasn't anywhere near the case.
00:33:01.250 - 00:33:01.946, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:02.130 - 00:33:30.854, Speaker A: You know, transaction fees were paying for some of it, but. But nowhere near what it is today. And it's actually sustained here. So. And we've seen it just go up with the price, of course. But yeah, miners are making a killing, that's for sure. And because of this, the, you know, as I said, the Ethereum transaction fee, percent of total miner revenue is at this kind of these all time highs here, especially during September, which was peak Defi summer and Defi bull market mania.
00:33:30.854 - 00:33:42.302, Speaker A: And then this all culminates in Ethereum's hash rate. So its mining hash rate being at an all time high because of the fact that it's so lucrative to be an Ethereum miner now, even without the high price.
00:33:42.358 - 00:33:42.526, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:42.550 - 00:34:07.364, Speaker A: Ethereum was more than double this price during 2017 here, or 2018, basically. And its hash rate is much higher now because there's more revenue being kind of paid out and also because miners have gotten better as well. I think the rise of ASIC miners on the network attributes to this a lot, too, so that can't be discounted. But it's funny that Ethereum's hashrate is at an all time high at the same time that we just turned on proof of stake with ETH two.
00:34:07.444 - 00:34:07.948, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:08.076 - 00:34:10.464, Speaker A: So very, very interesting thing to watch there.
00:34:11.844 - 00:34:12.356, Speaker B: All right.
00:34:12.420 - 00:34:32.534, Speaker A: This video would be remiss with, without me kind of mentioning some Defi metrics from Defi pulse. So you can see here, obviously, the TvL USD locked in DeFi, this hasn't really been affected by the quote unquote Defi bear market. Really. You can see on the one year chart here, right, September. Sorry, it's not September.
00:34:32.614 - 00:34:32.974, Speaker B: June.
00:34:33.054 - 00:35:01.817, Speaker A: When the compounds kicked off the bull market. It's kind of just been up since then. There's been, I mean, during the Defi bear market, there's not really been any kind of like, less kind of like dumps here in the chart, I guess you could say. So it's been very steady. You know, if we look at ETH locked in Defi, it's kind of same pattern here. It's kind of, it's been steady, but then it kind of, you know, dumped here. That's definitely because of ETH two and also because of uniswap mining ending.
00:35:01.817 - 00:35:14.084, Speaker A: So if I actually look up Uniswap here, you can actually see how much ETH has fallen out of Uniswap. It peaked at, I think, during liquidity mining, 3.6 million ETH. Now it's down to 1.1 million. Ethics. It's 2.5
00:35:14.084 - 00:35:34.144, Speaker A: million ETH that's being taken out of Uniswap alone. Some of this went to Sushiswap. Of course, if I go to sushiswap here and go to ETH, you know, you can see the uptick here, right? And then you can see another uptick, but nowhere near 2.5 million. So my theory is that some of that went to Sushiswap. Obviously, some of it went to ETH two staking. Some of it went to other parts of Defi.
00:35:34.144 - 00:35:48.716, Speaker A: But we did see, you know, what is this, like a nine, $8.9 million down to six point. Sorry. ETH down to 6.6 million. Hey, that's a pretty, pretty big drop there. So, you know, I wonder where that eats gone.
00:35:48.716 - 00:35:55.868, Speaker A: It doesn't seem to be gone into many of the other DeFi protocols. You know, probably a lot of it went into ETH two. Makes sense. I have a few friends that did that.
00:35:55.956 - 00:35:56.660, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:56.852 - 00:36:15.080, Speaker A: They would farm, you know, until the last minute and then deposited into ETH two. So that makes a lot of sense there for sure. But, yeah, good to see Defi kind of chugging along here. Yeah, this unfortunately isn't too accurate because it basically counts. WBTC locked in defi. And not all of this. WBTC is in Defi.
00:36:15.152 - 00:36:15.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:15.520 - 00:36:39.986, Speaker A: It's, you know, in people's wallets and things like that. So a bit inaccurate there, but I do think that's going to be rectified soon. I think the Defi pulse team is on top of that. Okay, last couple of metrics. This has probably been a long video at this point, so I just want to wrap up with these really cool metrics. So what this chart shows is the daily gas used on Ethereum. So this is actually capped.
00:36:39.986 - 00:36:46.190, Speaker A: So you can't really go above kind of a certain amount because each ethereum block has a gas limit on it.
00:36:46.222 - 00:36:46.606, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:46.710 - 00:37:07.310, Speaker A: And that will obviously, you know, limit how much, how much gas can be used per day. And we're pretty much at the limit here. You can see when the limits get increased. So the limit actually got increased up here and then up here again. I think the limit is like 12.5 million per block or something like that. And you can see here is like a lot of gas is being used each day, like every 15 seconds.
00:37:07.310 - 00:37:15.008, Speaker A: 12.5 million, you know, you know, if blocks are full, then all of the gas is being used. And that's just ethereum's economic bandwidth being. Being used.
00:37:15.056 - 00:37:15.216, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:15.240 - 00:37:24.552, Speaker A: That's why you see FIsA are still, like, not anywhere near what they used to be. You know, right now they're 20 Gwei, which is actually very cheap, mind you. It's a Sunday for me. So that's why.
00:37:24.608 - 00:37:24.776, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:24.800 - 00:38:16.266, Speaker A: And I'm recording this when I think, you know, the US is asleep. I just looked the time there, but, you know, usually it stopped at like 50 gray during the more active hours, which is, you know, that used to be less than 5g during the active hours. And you can see that, right, even up until even, even down here when the gas limit was lower because we didn't have as much demand. But now it's way up here and you might look at 2017 and be like, okay, well, 2017 is a lot lower than what it is now. And that's because, one, the gas limit was lower, but also because there was less complex transactions happening on the network. Now, what do I mean by that? Complex transactions, like DeFi transactions, for example, didn't really exist in 2017, and these transactions actually cost more gas. So when you pay a transaction fee, it will cost you more to interact with the defi app than sending ETH.
00:38:16.266 - 00:38:48.384, Speaker A: And this is because each kind of interaction you have with the Ethereum network has a gas cost associated with it. Now, the gas cost for sending ETH is 21,000. For example, the gas cost for interacting with a DeFi app is usually in the hundreds of thousands. So you can see why it's a lot more expensive. And that's exactly why we're seeing such high usage here, because people are paying these, these, this gas, these gas fees because they're getting more value out of it as well. So that, that's another interesting chart I love to keep an eye on. But as I said, it's kind of capped out for now.
00:38:48.384 - 00:39:33.136, Speaker A: So we're not going to get much kind of like insights from here, you know, unless the, unless the miners vote to, to increase the block limit again, the block gas limit again, which they have the ability to do. I wrote a piece about this in the daily grand newsletter, actually. I'm going to link it in the description because I think it's very important to understand this and I think I did a good job of explaining it in that piece. So I'll definitely link it for you guys last chart. So I've showed this on one of the daily grave refuels recently, but I thought it was worth revisiting. So as you can see here, the total Ethereum nodes on the network is basically, you know, shot up over the last few weeks. Now this is because in order to run ETH two validator, it is strongly encouraged that you run ETH one node as well, rather than using a third party provider.
00:39:33.136 - 00:40:06.484, Speaker A: And that's exactly what people have done. You can see that it went from about 9000 nodes to 11,200. So let's say it's another 2000 nodes came online. And it's funny because the unique deposit is into ETH two, from what I saw last time I checked, was almost 3000 or something. So the majority of people are running their own node when they're running their ETH two validators, which is really cool to see. Unfortunately, this chart doesn't go back much further than October, but I pretty sure this is an all time high for Ethereum nodes on the network, which is really encouraging to see. So I'm really, really happy about that.
00:40:06.484 - 00:40:38.824, Speaker A: But yeah, I'm going to keep an eye on this one. Definitely I expected to come down over time because, you know, people are just going to be like, oh well, I'm not going to run this if you ethereum one node anymore. I'm just going to use a third party provider. It's fine, whatever. But, you know, I encourage people to keep running the ETH one node for as long as you can. It's not too resource intensive, it keeps the network more decentralized, and it keeps you safer than relying on a third party as well. And, you know, if you're running an ETH one node, you can connect your metamask to it as well, so you don't have to rely on a third party like infura, which is always good to do as well.
00:40:38.824 - 00:41:08.796, Speaker A: All right, so that's it, everyone. Thank you for joining me on this first episode. I think that I'll be doing these once a month going forward. They're not going to be as long as this episode. I think I'm just going to be covering the previous month's worth of on chain data, picking out some really interesting nuggets for everyone to kind of like have a look at and pay attention to. And I do think it's going to be very interesting going forward. Next month, I'm going to do an ETH two recap because I wanted a whole month of ETH to the ETH two network being live before I did a deep dive on the data there.
00:41:08.796 - 00:41:41.004, Speaker A: I think there's going to be a lot of interesting insights there, and I will aim to do different metrics on a few different metrics on each episode, but also stick to like the same metrics so that we can see the growth right over time or maybe the decline over time. But yeah, so I'm really excited for this series. I hope you are too. Definitely subscribe to the YouTube channel if you want to keep up to date with this. Subscribe to the Daily Grey newsletter as well if you want to keep up to date with other Ethereum things and join the Discord channel if you haven't yet. But yeah, thank you everyone, for watching.
