00:00:00.360 - 00:00:35.718, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Sosano, and today's the 10 December 2021. Alright everyone, a lot to get through today, as you can see from my Twitter tabs. So much happened, I woke up and it was just a flurry of information that I had to count kind of catch up on. So first things first, the latest network upgrade for Ethereum, Arrow Glacier, went live today or yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this. As I've mentioned before, this network upgrade just pushed back the difficulty bomb to June 2021. Didn't include any other kind of like aips besides that one there.
00:00:35.718 - 00:01:12.428, Speaker A: And the next network upgrade will be either the merge or that ERP 4488 that kind of like making roll ups cheaper network upgrade there. Now I would say there's a much higher chance that the merge is next. I'm still kind of sticking to my Q two estimate, Q 220 22 estimate there, but we're going to have to see, you know, we're going to have to see how that kind of like shakes out. They're going to have to see what the community wants more, whether it's the merge or cheaper roll ups. I'm kind of torn. I've said before that I actually really would love to see this kind of like 4488 go live, even if it delays the merge by a couple of weeks. I'm not too kind of like fussed, but I know other people are.
00:01:12.428 - 00:01:37.408, Speaker A: I know a lot of people think that we need to do the merge ASAP and if we fail to ship the merge, probably even mid, you know, by mid next year, it's, it's going to be kind of like a really big deal. And I agree with that for sure. But I think we can do both. I think we've got a good enough process in place and I think the core devs are good enough for us to be able to do both. But we'll see, we'll see how it shakes out. We'll see what people want to do, but it's either one of those two that's going to be part of the next network upgrade there. Anyway, moving on.
00:01:37.408 - 00:02:08.272, Speaker A: So this happened just after I recorded yesterday's refill. So I didn't cover it yesterday, but I will cover it today. I did mention that Ross Ulbricht was doing nfts, raising money for prism reform. So the free Ross Dao that was spun up to kind of like, you know, raise a bunch of money and then bid on the Dow actually won the auction for Ross's NFT. So they ended up raising over 2800 each in just a week, which is over $20 million, $12 million. Sorry. And they won the auction with about half of what they had in the treasury, which is pretty cool.
00:02:08.272 - 00:02:39.782, Speaker A: Right? So they've got a thread, you know, going over how it all happened, the fact that people are going to get Ross tokens to have governance over this sort of stuff and all the information is in this threat. You can go check it out. But this is, this is awesome. I mean, again, it just shows the power of kind of like dows and of kind of like worldwide, I guess, coordination of both capital and kind of like social, sorry, financial capital and social capital to do something that, you know, for the greater good. I guess, like the first one was more speculative with the constitution down. And that wasn't the first one. I'm talking about like the first big one.
00:02:39.782 - 00:03:08.000, Speaker A: Whereas with the free Ross Dao, it has like a, you know, a more kind of like utilitarian mission behind it. You can see here they actually list the three things that they're going to be focusing on as part of the free Ross Dao. Obviously their vision is to free Ross. The first thing, second thing is advanced prison reform. And three, share Ross's work with the world and give everybody an opportunity to own it through kind of like the token. And there's kind of like a bunch of multi signers on here as well. Well known people in the, the community, such as Kobe.
00:03:08.000 - 00:03:45.706, Speaker A: You know, everyone knows crypto, Cobain, Kobe from, from up. Only you have cryptopathic is a pretty big ETH bull. You have Jemis here from, please, Adao and a bunch of others as well in this list here. So definitely really cool to see these. I think it's a great cause and awesome to see that they won the NFT with over $6 million and they've got a treasury now to do a bunch of other stuff, which is really, always really, really cool. So, yeah, awesome to see that from the free roster here. All right, so I think one of the biggest, if not biggest announcements from the last 24 hours was Polygon announcing that they have acquired yet another ZK startup in a $400 million deal.
00:03:45.706 - 00:04:36.558, Speaker A: So they bought or acquired Mia protocol here, not to be confused with Mira Protocol, which is part of the Terra ecosystem. I saw a few people kind of confusing that, but they've acquired them and they've kick started a team called Polygon Zero, which is their third ZK team, they have the Polygon Hermes team, Polygon Maidan, and now Polygon Zero. Now, Polygon Zero has a bit of different tech compared to Hermes and maiden and, of course, nightfall as well, which is kind of like their hybrid there. So Polygon Zero is kind of like Ethereum compatible ZK roll up. But it's using a new, not a newer form of cryptography, but a different form of cryptography or a different form of zero knowledge proofs called plonky two, which is a recursive proof system that is. And they listed here incredibly fast. It does proofs, or generates proofs on a laptop in 0.17
00:04:36.558 - 00:05:03.566, Speaker A: seconds. Guys, I can't stress how much to how, like, big of a deal this is generating the proofs for ZK. Kind of like roll ups and just ZK stuff in general, is the most expensive part, and it takes a long time because of that. It's expensive. You know, it takes a while to do it, even on beefy hardware. But with plonky two, apparently they're able to get 0.17 seconds to generate proofs, which is, as I say, the fastest implementation available today of ZK proofs here.
00:05:03.566 - 00:05:23.734, Speaker A: And, of course, it's Ethereum friendly, can support Ethereum transactions, and it's practical to verify on ethereum l one. Now, um, you know, it's funny because Polygon has so much going on right now, it's actually crazy. Like, look. Look at this. Uh, they have, like, midn zero, Hermes, and nightfall as part. As kind of, like, their roll ups that they're doing. And people kind of, like, are often confused.
00:05:23.734 - 00:05:42.558, Speaker A: They're like, okay, well, um, there's so much going on here. Like, what. What's the point of having all three, like, shouldn't they just have one? Well, they're all targeting different things. Like, I actually believe we're going to live in a multi role up world. It's not going to be a winner take all. It may be a winner take most where kind of like, one platform, in the long run, gets a lot of a network effect. But I don't think so.
00:05:42.558 - 00:06:03.462, Speaker A: I think demand for block space is infinite. I think each technology has its strength and weak strengths and weaknesses. They'll accrue different network effects because of that. And I think what Polygon strategy is, is basically to position themselves to take advantage of anything. So obviously, they have the optimistic roll up stuff happening with. With nightfall, with Hermes, they have. They're doing ZkVM work there as well.
00:06:03.462 - 00:06:34.364, Speaker A: With Polygon mine, they're doing Starks and with Polygon Zero, they're doing a plonky two. I think Hermaze is using a different kind of, like, set of cryptography there. I can't remember exactly what they're. What they're using, but, I mean, Polygon strategy is really just to cover, like, cover all the bases, which is, I think, an amazing strategy. And obviously, you guys might think I'm biased because I'm an advisor to Polygon, but I've said it for a very, very long time. Now, this is why, or one of the major reasons why I joined as an advisor, even though I knew that at the time, the Polygon team didn't have any L2s live yet. They work.
00:06:34.364 - 00:06:45.284, Speaker A: Had the poly. Polygon pos chain that had plasma, which didn't really take off for a variety of reasons. But I kept telling you guys, like, just. Just wait. Just watch and see what they do. Watch. Watch and see what they do with.
00:06:45.284 - 00:07:06.836, Speaker A: With kind of, like, um, ZK tech and optimistic roll ups. And just roll ups in general. And not only that, but also they have, like, polygon avail. The SDK, the POS chain still, which is, you know, I mean, still a good thing. Like, yes. It's not a quote, unquote true l two, but it still works for all intents and purposes. And it works really well with cheaper transactions, obviously, at the trade off of lower decentralization and security of ethereum l one.
00:07:06.836 - 00:07:21.908, Speaker A: But that is the short to medium term solution. And then the long term solution is obviously these ZK and optimistic roll up things here. So, yeah, I guess. Congrats to the MIA team for getting acquired here. Congrats to Polygon for the acquisition. It's a huge deal. $400 million.
00:07:21.908 - 00:07:34.004, Speaker A: That's. It's bigger than the Hermes. Do I think the Hermes did was 250 million or something like that? Not. I don't know if they announced what the mighty deal was, if they. If they're kind of, like. If they. If they announce a number there.
00:07:34.004 - 00:07:59.336, Speaker A: But this is all coming out of their $1 billion ZK strategic fund that they kind of, like, announced a while ago here. So, yeah, really, really cool to see that. Moving on, another update from the polygon ecosystem. There is the final phase of the governance process to get uniswap on. The Polygon pos chain is now live. So you can go to this link here, which I'll link in the YouTube description, to vote. If you hold uni tokens or if you're kind of, like, delegating to someone, encourage them to vote.
00:07:59.336 - 00:08:37.290, Speaker A: And if the vote passes, the deployment is officially approved, which means Uniswap V three will be approved, will be deployed to the Polygon pos chain, which is awesome. I mean, it's already on arbitrum and optimism. It makes total sense for it to be on the pos chain. Like, I am surprised it even took this long, but it's great to see that that kind of, like, proposal is moving along very, very smoothly, and it seems like it will pass here. So, yeah, I guess, like, really, really great to see that out of the polygon ecosystem. Moving on, an update here from Umbra cash, which is a privacy preserving stealth payments on Ethereum. Now they have launched a Polygon Pos, the Polygon Pos chain as well.
00:08:37.290 - 00:09:09.150, Speaker A: So with one transaction, it's cost less than a cent in fees. You can, you can be configured to receive stealth payments on the Polygon network. So, you know, this is in addition to them support to Ambrose supporting a theorem mainnet, of course. And I'm sure they're going to be kind of like, deploying to, I guess, like arbitrary and optimism and stuff like that as well. These sorts of things make sense because doing privacy is definitely more expensive gas wise. So on Ethereum l one, I guess it kind of makes less sense because of the fact that it's so expensive. And I'm going to talk about another privacy thing in a sec from Aztec.
00:09:09.150 - 00:09:28.552, Speaker A: But yeah, it makes a ton of sense for them to be on the POS chain. And then also the EVM, other EVM compatible kind of like L2s, like arbitrum and optimism. So definitely go check out their announcement blog post here. I'll link it in the YouTube description. And speaking of Aztec, I spoke about it before. So you guys know Aztec. It is a L2 privacy protocol.
00:09:28.552 - 00:09:51.524, Speaker A: You can kind of play around with it at ZK money. They're using ZK roll ups to, I guess, like your roll up technology to. To kind of like bring privacy to L2. What they announced today is that aztec connect is, which is the first private bridge for Ethereum. Defi is now live on testnet. So you can have up to 100 times gas savings with fully private transactions by default. So the way it works from.
00:09:51.524 - 00:10:36.780, Speaker A: From what I kind of like I understand it is that Aztec allows you to basically do these transactions at L2 and these private transactions at L2, and it'll tap into defi at layer one. So this is what I'm talking about in terms of kind of the composability between layer one and L2. And also I guess kind of like L2 to L2. But what the bridge contract does in, in with Aztec here is that it takes the aggregated funds that are deposited into it, calls the relevant functions from a DeFi protocol, and then proceeds from the interact, from that interaction are returned to the roll up contract. So in plain English, the roll up is acting like a user aggregator, which, I mean, roll ups technically do this, they just act as like transaction and computational kind of like user aggregators. But in this sense, Aztecs kind of like roll up. Oh, sorry.
00:10:36.780 - 00:11:07.976, Speaker A: Bridge contract is aggregating all these funds together, allowing users to kind of like do stuff at layer one. Sorry, on layer one from L2 and then bringing it all back. And you can have like private transactions because of this absolutely awesome tech here. Like, guys, I mean, I've been talking about privacy for a very long time now and how important it is. And as I just mentioned, umbra with their stealth payments is live on the POS chain. And if you're a main net, Aztec is now live on testnet with this feature. And I'm sure it's going to come to mainnet much kind of like sooner as well.
00:11:07.976 - 00:11:40.208, Speaker A: And they actually gave a comparison between costs as well. So if you were to do this on layer one for a basic uniswap trade, for example, it would cost you $55 and you would get zero privacy if you do this on aztec network. And it costs, you know, aztec network, it's private, like fully private. And it costs $7.50, which is an 86% gas reduction with the privacy, of course. Now, some of you may be thinking, you know, $7.50 is still pretty expensive for a swap, but you have to remember that, one, this is the first iteration of their technology.
00:11:40.208 - 00:12:06.462, Speaker A: Two, this is fully private. Privacy, as I mentioned before, costs more to do. It's just a heavier and more gas intensive thing to do. And three, the roll up kind of like costs are going to come down over time as part of, I guess, like the Ethereum l one, scaling too, like ERP 4488 and sharding and all that sort of stuff. So the fact that they've been able to get it down to this cost for fully private uniswap trademark is absolutely awesome. I love it. Love what they're doing here.
00:12:06.462 - 00:12:50.632, Speaker A: Definitely go check out the kind of like full thread here for a description and join the Discord channel. You can go kind of like play around with everything here as well. So Arbitrum announced today that they have partnered up with Chainlink and they're using their, their kind of like FSS technology to minimize MeV on arbitrum and to decentralize their sequencer. So they're working with the Chainlink team, of course, to do this. So you can see here there's the update from Chainlink itself. And they kind of like detail in this blog post how arbitrary is using chain links technology or fair sequencing services to kind of like decentralize their sequencer and make their arbitram chain mev resistance. So, I mean, this is a pretty healthy blog post here.
00:12:50.632 - 00:13:13.088, Speaker A: It kind of like goes through it. There's pretty graphics as well. It'll kind of like walk you through it all. So definitely go check that out. I am not kind of an expert on what chain links doing with FSS here. I do know they have kind of like VRF, which is a verifiable delay function, which is essentially a way to kind of like have true randomness. And by having true random randomness, you can create things that are Mev resistant.
00:13:13.088 - 00:13:46.630, Speaker A: I think maybe the FSS has something to do with this. Someone's going to correct me, I'm sure. But yeah, it's great to see two powerhouses within the Ethereum ecosystem working together to tackle meV, but also to tackle decentralized sequencing. Because I've said to you guys before, all the sequences are centralized right now for these l two s, we need to decentralize them out. There's two ways to kind of like do that. You rely on altruism, or you kind of like partner with infrastructure providers like Chainlink to do it and or you issue a token and then get people to run it and kind of like earn tokens. So yeah, both of those things are going to happen.
00:13:46.630 - 00:14:11.598, Speaker A: But yeah, great to see this first one kicking off already here. So optimism. Have put out a thread today detailing all the projects that have launched on optimistic Ethereum since they went to EV equivalents. A few, there's about a month ago now, and they did the OVM 2.0 upgrade. So you can see all the projects here from, sorry, from Poly network, which is o three swap. Here you have deforce connects.
00:14:11.598 - 00:14:24.360, Speaker A: I don't know why these tweets are unavailable. Synapse protocol, we piggy. There's a bunch of projects here, like more and more projects going live as time goes on. So just a great thread to go through them. Definitely. Check this out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description below.
00:14:24.360 - 00:15:08.260, Speaker A: And I'm going a bit fast today, guys, but there's so much to get through I'm only halfway through here, so I want to get through it all. Robbie Ferguson from the immutable team. I just realized I've pretty much talked only about L2 stuff so far, except the free rost and the, and the Arrow glacier thing, which is cool because L2 stuff is awesome. But anyway, Robbie Ferguson, one of the co founders of Immutable, tweeted out today that over the last 40 days, the number of projects actively building on immutable's testnet has quadrupled. So this doesn't include any of the individual deals, just the frictionless stripe like platform that allows anyone to build plus trade nfts on Ethereum. This is awesome because as I've said to you guys, once you like on these l two s, once you open it up, give devs the tools they need to kind of like play around with it. Get rid of the whitelist.
00:15:08.260 - 00:15:41.036, Speaker A: You have just a cambrian explosion of people and teams and whoever else building on top of you, and they don't need to talk to you as a kind of like core team to do it. Like with arbitram, for example, because they don't have a whitelist. No one even has to tell arbitram what they're doing, that you can just deploy it. It's the same as ethereum l one, right, where you don't have to go tell Vitalik or the Ethereum foundation, hey, I'm deploying this to the chain. Like it wouldn't even make sense to tell them because why would they even care? You can just do it and you don't have to tell anyone. That's the same with arbitrum. Optimism still has their whitelist, but I'm sure they'll remove that sooner, you know, rather than later.
00:15:41.036 - 00:16:24.216, Speaker A: And then immutable is in the same kind of like boat as arbitrum where anyone can kind of deploy their nfts or to, to kind of like the platform and they don't necessarily need to contact the core team. But of course in the early days they probably more likely will because they might run into bugs and things like that. But just generally they don't need to do it, which I think is the goal. Like the L2s, really, the way I kind of like view the L2s is that they should be exactly like ethereum l one in terms of being able to deploy whatever you want on there, being as decentralized as possible, being as secure as possible, obviously inheriting Ethereum security and decentralization, being kind of like open, permissionless, censorship resistant, all that good stuff. But they should do it at a fraction of the cost. That's their only goal. Guys like I.
00:16:24.216 - 00:16:59.398, Speaker A: And they should be able to be, you know, I should say there's, there's one more major goal. They should be able to experiment a lot more than ethereum l one. Like I've said before, these l two s will be able to experiment with different kind of like governance modes. They'll be able to experiment with different smart contract languages, virtual machines, all that good stuff there. But at the core of it, at the very core of it, they're kind of like, main goal is just to make it, make the Ethereum experience cheaper, right? Much cheaper than what it is today. So great to see that out of immutable here. Next up in the L2 news is Elyra has announced that their token launch on optimism will be going live on December 14.
00:16:59.398 - 00:17:41.579, Speaker A: So I know a few of you have been talking about this in the Discord channel, so I just wanted to give a quick shout out here. They've got a liquidity mining programs being spun up and they also have community rewards that they announced that I covered on the refuel. So if you're eligible for that, you'll be getting your tokens on December 14 here. So cross protocol has added support from bridging from optimism to L1 Ethereum. So optimism users can now benefit from what across is saying is the web3's fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge to return assets to L1, Ethereum. So just another bridge I've talked about across before, like plenty of times at this point. I remember saying that I thought across was really cool because they were innovating at the kind of like bridge level here, but great to see them support another L2 network in optimism.
00:17:41.579 - 00:18:19.378, Speaker A: And speaking of bridges, Hop protocol also announced that they've reduced their fees for their Ethereum to optimism transfers by 30% by leveraging the OVM 2.0 upgrade. So it's now cheaper to send funds to optimism using hop than the native bridge, and you often get positive slippage on top. That's awesome. And what this means in plain English is that optimism obviously has their native bridge, which you can send funds to and kind of like, we've all used that probably at this stage, but hop is actually cheaper than that. Obviously there's a trade off here, right? It's a different kind of like, thing going on. Hop is like cross chain exchange, whereas the official kind of like optimism bridge is just built directly into the l two.
00:18:19.378 - 00:18:49.676, Speaker A: It is, you know, that's probably the safest way to bridge in. But if you're concerned about costs, obviously, because layer one bridging costs are quite expensive, you can use hop here and it's now 30% cheaper to do so, which is a pretty big improvement. Right? Like, I know it may seem small, but 30% really, I mean, if you. If it costs you kind of like a $100 before, just as an example, reducing it by 30% means it cost you. Oh, man. I'm going to scrub the math here, aren't I? Let's just say it cost you $70 or something like that. I think it might be less than that.
00:18:49.676 - 00:19:05.744, Speaker A: Or maybe I'm. Maybe. No, maybe not. Maybe I'm just second guessing myself on the math there. But yeah, I was never really good at math, guys. But it's still a pretty big reduction. So any kind of extra juice we can get out of kind of like these efficiency improvements here, the better.
00:19:05.744 - 00:19:44.300, Speaker A: All right, last up here, I think in the l two news is this website called zkrolups XYZ from Joel kite here. Now, I think I may have seen this before, but maybe mentioned it on the refuel, but I'd forgotten about it until now. But Zkrolops XYZ is basically kind of a directory for the ZK roll up ecosystem that lists all the live apps and technology. So you can see here, obviously, ZK sync, Starkware, Polygon, Loop, Ring, and then all the apps and things like that are here as well. So Zkswap, Argent, Paraswap, Gitcoin, all the ones that are integrated. So this is a directory. If you want to go check out what you can do using ZK tech today.
00:19:44.300 - 00:20:20.600, Speaker A: This website's for you. I'll link it in the YouTube description. So a huge bit of news out of Coinbase and compound today. So starting today, Coinbase is allowing customers to earn interest on their Dai, powered by the compound protocol. So this is kind of like the defi mullet or like Ethereum mullet. I think it's called the defi mullet that the bankless guys call. Call it playing out where it's defi in the back and kind of like CFI in the front, because obviously Coinbase is c five, centralized finance, but they're offering their users a super easy way to get a very nice die yield through, kind of like their Coinbase app here.
00:20:20.600 - 00:20:49.834, Speaker A: So you can see a little kind of like GIF animation and it's all powered by compound in the background, which is obviously a deFi app. This is super, super awesome. Because you can see here the APY for die in October fluctuated between 2.8% and 5.3%. I know that may seem relatively low, but this is kind of like just a compound rate. Like, this is not kind of like putting it into convex or putting it into yearn or whatever to kind of get a better yield there and obviously taking on a bit more risk. This is just a kind of like vanilla comp yield.
00:20:49.834 - 00:21:20.044, Speaker A: And guys, like, this yield is much better than what you can get in a traditional bank account. Like, I'm pretty sure the high yield account in the US right now is 0.4%. So even if you just go to the lower end here of 2.8%, that is a massive improvement. That's like a seven x improvement over, you know, traditional bank with. Yeah, probably a little bit more risk because you're putting it into a DeFi protocol, but I think that Coinbase would still offer some sort of protections here and take on and best brunt of some of the risk. But this is really, really cool.
00:21:20.044 - 00:21:46.748, Speaker A: So it's. This is available in over 70 countries, including the UK, Germany and Spain, I don't think. Yeah, it's not available for customers in the United States because Gary Gensler from the SEC is protecting you guys. Sorry, I don't know if it's available in Australia. We can't even sell using Coinbase. So our securities commission is protecting us even harder than you saw something. But still good for those people in the supported countries here, but unfortunately not available for us customers.
00:21:46.748 - 00:22:32.914, Speaker A: But I mean, you know, the funny thing is, is that like the Defi doesn't discriminate based on kind of like countries because the pro, the smart contracts can't. I know with DYDX, they don't let us users kind of use the protocol, but you can get around that with a VPN. It's not hard. But like compound, for example, and uniswap and things like that, then they don't kind of like enforce geographic restrictions on the actual smart contract level or anything like that. So you can just go, I mean, you can just go get these APIs no matter where you are, if you're just using defi directly. And that's kind of like the beauty of it. But if you want something just like super simple to earn a yield on your die, you can use Coinbase, obviously, but I think pretty much all of you or most of you listening to this are probably not going to use something like this because you're more involved and you probably don't even want to hold dollars.
00:22:32.914 - 00:23:17.508, Speaker A: Like, honestly, I know that I'm saying these yields much better than the tradfi system, but, like, for me, like, the way I look at it, if you had kind of, like, had stable coins at the start of this year, say you had, like, $10,000 with a stable coins at the start of this year, and then you put them into a stable coin farm, let's say you average it out and you. You've earned, like, a healthy 10% on that, right, for the whole year. Okay. You earned $1,000 for the whole year on that ten k. It's low, low risk and everything like that. You just put it in a nice low risk farm, probably something like M stable that it offers you kind of like a 10% yield there. But then I look at kind of like, if you had put that $10,000 into ETH instead, you would have been much better off, because ETH was, what, like $700 at the start of the year or something like that.
00:23:17.508 - 00:23:49.240, Speaker A: And it went up to, you know, even at current prices, if we take the current price of 4100, it went up kind of like four or five x there and probably more than that. Again, I'm screwing up the math here, guys, but it just went up a lot more. But obviously, you're taking on more risk because you're holding a volatile asset. But, eh, like, I just personally don't want to hold much fiat on my balance sheet. I want to hold lots of crypto because lots of Ethan specifically, because it's just a much better kind of, like, risk reward here. That's why I think this isn't going to appeal to us. Kind of like degens.
00:23:49.240 - 00:24:12.792, Speaker A: It's definitely going to appeal to the normies, though this or their bank account. It's. It's a no brainer, really. It's a no brainer, I think, for most people. So, really, really cool to see this. A bunch of other stuff to get through. So Clinton, the CEO of Slingshot, today announced that they have raised a $15 million series a led by ribbon Capital with participation from Framework Ventures, K five Global, Shrug Capital, the chain smokers.
00:24:12.792 - 00:24:41.288, Speaker A: Chain smokers, the DJ's electric capital, and who's this Austin Reef, who is the CEO of Morning Brew, and a few others. Now, for those of you who have been listening to the refill for a while, you know all about slingshot because I'm a seed investor and I've talked about them before on the. On the. On the. On the show here, but they're a kind of decentralized exchange aggregator platform that's live on the Polygon Pos chain and on arbitrum right now. With optimism coming soon as well. So congrats to them on the race here.
00:24:41.288 - 00:25:08.214, Speaker A: I'm super excited to see them kind of like kicking goals. They actually evolved out of Dex Ag for any of the people that, that remember this, this was this kind of like spun out of the defi pulse ecosystem and then it became like a fully fledged app in slingshot. And they're just, yeah, they're growing. I mean you can see their growth stats here. Over $2 billion of trade volume, a million trades, and 100k plus unique wallets so far that have interacted with the protocol. So great to see that. Congrats to the team on the raise.
00:25:08.214 - 00:25:47.946, Speaker A: So the fly product, the flexible leverage index product has landed on polygon, the polygon Pos chain. So it's the same kind of, I guess like as the fly products on Ethereum L1, but obviously with near zero gas fees. So the ETH two x fly is now on kind of the polygon Pos chain here built on top of set protocol which has been deployed to the POS chain and Aave. And you can see set's announcement here that the, you know, the kind of like supporting the Polygon Pos chain too, which is awesome to see. As you guys know, I'm an advisor to set. I used to work there full time as marketing manager. They're great to see them shipping and kicking goals.
00:25:47.946 - 00:26:40.084, Speaker A: I want to see them everywhere. Like I'd love to see set on like optimism and arbitrary and all those kind of like other places. And I'd love to see index co op there as well because I think that shipping products for, as I mentioned yesterday, index co op strong suit is shipping product and they need to keep doing more of that, I believe, because that's how they stay ahead of the pack. So mstable has introduced a thing called the emissions controller today. So what the emissions controller does is it moves the weekly distribution of MTA liquidity mining emissions on chain, determining the distribution of MTA to vaults and other recipient contracts via votes on dials by MTA stakers. So this is obviously all controlled by governance. And you can kind of like see that governance is going to have the power to control kind of like the emissions and you can kind of like see here, MTA stakers will vote for the distribution of MTA rewards to designated recipient contracts.
00:26:40.084 - 00:27:14.096, Speaker A: And the objective of the emissions controller is to further decentralize M stable and handover control to the MTA token over the M stable ecosystem. This is really really cool. I mean as you guys know, I've been an advisor to an investor with M stable for a very long time. I mentioned before how they've got some really great safe stable coin yields going on. But I think that this makes a lot of sense because the MTA liquidity mining emissions has been going on for a while. It's kind of like out there to try, to try and kind of like distribute the tokens to a nice set of people. But also MTA being kind of like a stable coin yield aggregator.
00:27:14.096 - 00:28:01.980, Speaker A: I mean not really, but that's like one of the products that they have. They definitely want to be able to kind of like compete with these other mechanisms that use things to bribe like, you know, you all about the CRV and CVX bribes and stuff like that that are going on in order to get the most out of the yield that they're getting from curve. I think that's what people, the MTA stakers can do as well is that they can kind of like vote and say okay, let's put more NTA rewards on this pool so we can bright, you know, and let's buy out more of this so we can get more of the yields from curb and stuff like that. So cool to see this launched by Mstable today. So David Mihal has a new information site out called money printer Dot in Fo. So if you go here you're able to see how much each of the kind of like protocols are paying to grow as David puts it here. But essentially this is their issuance rate.
00:28:01.980 - 00:28:27.062, Speaker A: So you can see at the top, I mean Ethereum is actually paying 4.07% issuance right now which is $55 million a day of issuance which. Okay, okay, I'm going to take a step back here because I'm going to paint another bullish picture for you guys. You know how I always talk about the merge and I always talk about that 80% to 90% issue introduction. This is exactly what I'm talking about. Now, this doesn't show net issuance. We are way less than this.
00:28:27.062 - 00:29:04.586, Speaker A: If you account for AIP 1559, we're about 50%, or even more than that, less than this. So you can discount this to, you know, 2% issuance effective issuance rate with the burn which means, you know, new daily issuance if you, if you net it out would be about $22.5 million a day here. That's still a lot of ETH for the market to absorb now do your 80% to 90% issuance reduction with the merge. Keep the burn in place, and you have negative issuance. You have negative issuance in ETH, which means you have negative issuance in dollar, which means daily issuance drops to the bottom of this list. Guys like the, literally the rock bottom.
00:29:04.586 - 00:29:34.442, Speaker A: It goes from the top, which it is right now, issuing the most of any protocol, to the bottom. Right. And if you kind of like net it out, of course, it would already be probably like second. Bitcoin would still be first, which is pretty funny when you think about it, that Ethereum is kind of like more deflationary area than bitcoin right now because of 1559. But then with the merge, it just, it just becomes like even more. And you can see here other networks like Solana, I mean, this is the issuance rate that they're paying to stakers, which is 7.27%, which is currently $18 million a day.
00:29:34.442 - 00:30:04.944, Speaker A: Solana is paying a lot of money for this. Like it's, it's crazy how much they're paying in issuance. And I don't know what their issuance schedule is, but I don't think they have a reduced reduction issuance. I think they have a burn mechanism. But for them to get to the same level of kind of like money that's being burned, that's being burned on Ethereum, it would take a very long time to do that. Polkadot as well. I mean, they have an 8% issuance rate, which is pretty high, almost $10 million, because it's obviously measured in their native token.
00:30:04.944 - 00:30:31.558, Speaker A: And you know, I actually looked at the Dot chart the other day, especially against ETH. It is not doing too hot. And I think these things do play into that, guys. I think these extra issuance, I think early investors, I think people just kind of like seeing different ecosystems, not delivering on what they promised is putting a lot of downward pressure there. Like Ethereum is eating $55 million of new issuance today, netted out 22.5 million, but it's still going up over time. It's because of the fact that people want ETH.
00:30:31.558 - 00:31:00.788, Speaker A: Like it's an in demand asset, right? Whereas bitcoin, I mean, big one, is kind of like not doing too hot. I mean, ETH is gaining on bitcoin. I know, against USD Ethan, bitcoin are basically kind of like dancing around each other right now. But I think there's a reason, this is a major reason why it is outperforming. Then you can see there's a bunch of others here like osmosis, which is a, an AMM protocol built using the cosmos SDK. They're paying 123% issuance rate right now, I guess for liquidity mining. Convex at 53%.
00:31:00.788 - 00:31:16.006, Speaker A: Cardano has a 2% issuance rate but they're still paying $2.5 million. Kind of like daily issuance here. And then you make your way down the list. Dogecoin still has 3.7% and then yeah, there's, there's a bunch of other apps here. So great little site from David.
00:31:16.006 - 00:31:50.442, Speaker A: But the thing is with this site is it requires a lot of context because with curve, for example, you have the issuance rate but then you have the issuance rate net of how much CRV is being locked up forever to, into the kind of governance contracts into the Dow, I should say, which is actually a lot. And then as I said with Ethereum you need to net out the burn. Then there's all the esoteric stuff like locked tokens and tokens that haven't moved in a really long time and kind of like stuff like that. And then same goes for a lot of these other protocols too. That. And then you've got to account for like liquidity mining. Yeah, it's just, I mean it's a good kind of like surface level website.
00:31:50.442 - 00:32:22.258, Speaker A: But I did mention to David that I'd love to see more context, especially for Ethereum around the burn. And you can just put that context in this box here and then kind of like say, okay, this is the net issuance rather than what? Rather than just having it like this because it misses a lot of the very very important context, but still a really, really cool site from David here. All right, last couple updates and I've gone over time, so I missed this yesterday. Block owners waitlist is now live and they also announced a fundraiser. This is a kind of Aussie based project. They've raised $6.4 million to do what they say is bring DeFi to the masses.
00:32:22.258 - 00:33:13.102, Speaker A: Now this is, this project has been founded by a former Synthetix whoops Synthetix co founder, I believe, or someone who, who worked at Synthetix here, Jordan Momtazi, and also Charlie Karaboga, sorry, is part of this as well. So they're both the block earner founders, as I said before, about kind of like the Defi mullet. This is Defi mullet as well, where essentially they're trying to kind of like be an interface that sits on top of the DeFi protocols and offer yield to normies really at the end of the day, right? Like you definitely, as I said, targeting normies with these sort of kind of products, not us DJ's who can just do it on our own. But this is what's required for mass adoption. Like, I think people are deluding themselves if they think that most people in the world are going to do what we do when we kind of like degenerating. DeFi self custody is amazing. Most people don't want to do it, guys.
00:33:13.102 - 00:33:47.492, Speaker A: Like, seriously, most people don't trust themselves to do it, which is fine. So giving them these options where they can lose a more centralized service but still access the wonderful world of Defi, I think is the better path forward. So really, really awesome to see this product. And you can sign up to their waitlist@blockearner.com. Dot au all right, last up is a new website from Frontier here. So if you kind of like, see in the video, you can kind of like, see Frontier is the front seat to crypto and Defi, as they call themselves. You can create a wallet and buy crypto with them, with them here, and you can kind of store and receive crypto.
00:33:47.492 - 00:34:12.762, Speaker A: I mean, I just really like the website. It looks really, really cool to me. But essentially this is kind of like another Normie friendly kind of thing that's going on here with a wallet and everything like that. I think I've spoken about them before, but again, this is what we need for mass adoption. This is kind of like, I guess an argent competitor. I would say they support, you know, obviously other networks and ethereum L2s as well. But I think, like, it also works with other wallets.
00:34:12.762 - 00:35:10.306, Speaker A: You can actually connect with your other wallets like argent and kind of like I'm token and gnosis and stuff like that as well. So, yeah, if you haven't checked out frontier, definitely be sure to do so because it looks like another cool kind of like wallet that you can play around with. But, you know, in saying that, I sometimes kind of like, think, how many wallets do we need? Because, I mean, I only use kind of like, I don't even use mobile wallets really, because I'm on my desktop all the time, but most of the time I'm using kind of like metamask with, you know, obviously a hardware wallet pass through, whether that be my ledger or my lattice. But like, for a mobile wallet, I don't really do much on my mobile wallet. And if I did right now, I'd probably pick Argent because I'm used to it, especially with their L2 integrations going live, but frontier looks like a pretty cool, kind of like another option there. Rainbow wallets, also really, really cool Coinbase wallets, actually pretty decent, but I just don't use them enough to kind of, I guess, have a favorite yet. But still, if you do, if you're into your mobile wallets, definitely go give Frontier a kind of like look here.
00:35:10.306 - 00:35:22.354, Speaker A: But I think on that one, on that note, that's going to be it for today. So thank you, everyone, for listening and watching.
