00:00:00.440 - 00:00:42.120, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way refuel, where I recap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Anthony Cisano, and today's the 5 February 2021. Alright, everyone, let's get into the news from the day. So I did promise on Twitter today that I would clarify what I meant by this tweet here, and I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about this and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. But basically what I tweeted was, I have never been more bullish on ethereum than I am today. Now, obviously, I'm always bullish on Ethereum, right? I'm always bullish on ETH. You know, for those who have followed me for a long time, I mean, even with when ETH was in the double digits, I, you know, during the bear market, I was bullish, right? I never kind of stopped being bullish, and obviously I'm still bullish today.
00:00:42.120 - 00:01:18.866, Speaker A: But I guess while I was sitting here today and I was like just reading through some things and on Twitter, I just all of a sudden just felt like, you know, all these kind of puzzle pieces in my head kind of clicked together and just made me, like, more bullish than I've ever been. Like, totally. And it's probably hard to believe because I've been bullish for so long, but yeah, it was just a weird feeling. So I'll run through why, and before I do, I just want to say, nothing I say is investment advice. Obviously, a lot of what I'm going to talk about got to do with ETH price as well, and like, eats fundamentals and things like that. So I just wanted to clarify that first. So let's jump into why I am so bullish.
00:01:18.866 - 00:01:48.894, Speaker A: So I guess for me, you know, I started my Ethereum journey in early 2017 and I've seen the space evolve so much since then. Right, where three years on since then, I think four years, actually. Well, okay, it's been longer than that. So four years on since then. And yeah, the space has changed dramatically. We've gone from Ethereum's only use case of being like an ICO kind of token platform to being an entire platform for like, so many different economic use cases.
00:01:48.974 - 00:01:49.532, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:49.678 - 00:02:29.952, Speaker A: So obviously DeFi is a big use case here. Now, I think Defi up until Defi summer and even like after that, I think it actually took longer than Defi Summer for this to happen. But at this point, it's been validated as a use case. Right there isn't really many doubters of DeFi anymore. The only doubters that I see are kind of bitcoin maximalist, who obviously they're going to doubt anything that isn't bitcoin and still call it a scam or whatever. But in terms of like the, I guess the bitcoin is the moderates, the quote, unquote general crypto people, you know, even competitor chains to Ethereum, right. They've all kind of capitulated, I guess, in a way, or at least realize the value of Defi now.
00:02:29.952 - 00:02:42.744, Speaker A: That is absolutely massive. We've seen it play out on the markets. We've seen all the Defi tokens go up. We've seen the usage of defi explode. And, you know, for me it's become not a, not a kind of when, sorry, not an if, but a when sort of thing.
00:02:42.784 - 00:02:43.104, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:43.184 - 00:03:17.590, Speaker A: You know, previously, like, it might be hard to believe now, but before Defi summer, especially for a lot of people, for most people, actually, it was not like, you know, this is going to work. This is going to change the world. It was like, you know, maybe this will work. You know, there's all these issues with it and we have to solve them, and if we don't, it's going to fail. And, you know, to be fair, if we don't solve some of the fundamental issues, it might still kind of maybe not play out, like, the way we want to, the way we want it to. But I think at this point, you know, there's way less of those people and it's more that everyone kind of believes this is what is going to take over the traditional finance system. Right.
00:03:17.590 - 00:03:22.038, Speaker A: This is going to be the future of finance or the future of France as the, as the meme goes.
00:03:22.086 - 00:03:22.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:23.094 - 00:04:10.894, Speaker A: And I don't think there's many doubters left for that. So that was the first thing that I kind of, like, just sat there and really, really took in. I really kind of just took in how far we have come with DeFi, specifically from, you know, maker launching in December 2017, which I guess I would consider like the start of Defi, even though there were some things before that, I would consider that, like the start of modern day Defi, at least. And then since then, we have come so incredibly far, it's actually insane how far we've come. And it might seem like a long time, like three or four years, but that's actually a really short time considering what we're trying to do here, right? We're trying to recreate the entire financial system on new infrastructure, brand new infrastructure built from scratch. This isn't like a fintech company building on traditional finance infrastructure that's already there. We're building entirely new things here from scratch.
00:04:10.894 - 00:04:21.926, Speaker A: Never been built before, you know, and we've done, you know, we've managed to create a booming ecosystem within three to four years. I think that in particular is just a reason enough to be bullish.
00:04:21.990 - 00:04:22.594, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:22.894 - 00:04:47.608, Speaker A: So other than Defi, there's also, we've got this kind of, over the last few months, the traditional finance system actually starting to pour into Ethereum, right? And you know, I refer to traditional finance as tradfi, so I'll just use that. But tradfi is coming in, in a really, really big way. And there's no way they would have touched Ethereum or defi pretty much like pre 2020. They would not have even cared about it. They were just getting their feet wet with bitcoin.
00:04:47.656 - 00:04:48.008, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:48.096 - 00:05:16.556, Speaker A: They were understanding that they didn't really care about Ethereum and Defi. They didn't really care about to know about it. You know, maybe some of them thought it was a scam or something, right. So I think that's a huge kind of narrative going forward. I mean, you have people like uh, the Winklevie twins, uh, right, the Winklevoss twins, known as the Winklevie. They were just like big bitcoin from proponents until recently. Until after, over the last I guess, year or so, they've become huge proponents for Ethan defy.
00:05:16.556 - 00:06:00.100, Speaker A: And you can actually see this playing out in the markets where the Defi tokens that the traditional finance people are talking about, like Aave, are going up really, really fast, right? Especially because they're on Coinbase and Ave deserves to as well. Amazing platform, don't get me wrong. But, but you know, when you have Mark Cuban and the Winklevoss twins and roll poll all these big traditional finance folk talking about this sort of stuff, the, I mean, Mike Novogratz used to say the herd is coming, right? And he's been saying that for a while. I think he was too early. I think now the herd is coming. I think now it's gotten too big to ignore for the plays in the traditional finance system. I mean, on Monday we have the CME futures going live, right.
00:06:00.100 - 00:06:02.252, Speaker A: I think people may have forgotten that that's happening on Monday.
00:06:02.308 - 00:06:02.872, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:06:02.968 - 00:07:11.124, Speaker A: It's only a couple days away. So that's happening for ETH, which is just insane for getting traditional finance people into ETH and getting exposure to ETH and getting their feet wet with it, right? And then we have, like, Mark Cuban tweeting to his millions of followers about using defi and about how defi, like, during the GME saga, how defi can fix it and help with it as well, right? You have the Winklevoss twins who have very, very deep, traditional finance kind of roots, right? They run a centralized exchange called Gemini. They grew up with in kind of like an old money family where their family, like, is pretty, you know, has their roots set there. They obviously famous, right, for, I guess, like, from Facebook fame. So, you know, they're not nobodies, right? They're literally like celebrities, right? And they're not celebrities in the sense of, you know, when we saw some liberties, some celebrities tweeting about dogecoin, they're like celebrities in the place where the money is, right? Where the money's. All the money's in traditional finance. You know, if you look at kind of charts and of, like, where the money is and how the wealth is distributed in the world, most of the money belongs to the older generations, right? You know, I think a lot of it belongs to the boomer generation.
00:07:11.124 - 00:07:50.236, Speaker A: Now, obviously, most of them aren't in crypto yet, right? Pretty much all of that money is not in crypto yet. So what do you think happens when that money makes it? What makes its way into crypto? What do you think happens when BTC and ETH get put into just like, these kind of, like, traditional investment vehicles, right, as kind of, like, just the thing you buy for retirement accounts for all this sort of stuff, you know, what. What do you think happens? I mean, I can tell you what happens, right? But I'm sure you can imagine what happens then. But it's not just the prices. It's also the use cases, right? These people validating Defi and Ethereum for the traditional finance space is. Is just incredible, right? Like, that's what we need to happen. Yes.
00:07:50.236 - 00:07:58.656, Speaker A: We're trying to replace them, right? But we'd rather them kind of, like, replace themselves. We'd rather them come into the ecosystem, figure out how they can work within it.
00:07:58.680 - 00:07:58.960, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:59.032 - 00:08:07.368, Speaker A: And how they can add value and then just kind of work with us rather than, like, just sitting idly by and watching themselves get obliterated.
00:08:07.456 - 00:08:07.872, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:07.968 - 00:08:19.744, Speaker A: I mean, some of them I would like to obliterate, right. Some of them are parasites. And, you know, even if they tried to work within the ecosystem, they'd probably be parasites within defi, too. But the beautiful thing about defi is that it punishes this.
00:08:19.784 - 00:08:19.936, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:19.960 - 00:08:33.674, Speaker A: You cannot be parasitic in defi. You know, you can try, but eventually you're going to lose. Because this is neutral infrastructure, right? This is. This is something that can be. You can be forked or someone can recreate it and make a better and more neutral system.
00:08:33.794 - 00:08:34.146, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:34.210 - 00:08:39.426, Speaker A: All these old tricks that you use in the traditional finance system to screw over people, you can't do that in Defi.
00:08:39.530 - 00:08:39.986, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:40.090 - 00:08:42.450, Speaker A: There are some things you can do in Defi, don't get me wrong.
00:08:42.482 - 00:08:42.578, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:42.586 - 00:09:18.228, Speaker A: It's not a perfect system, but it's much more open. So, you know, the defi battleground is not somewhere where traditionally traditional finance people can win with their current tactics. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Layer two taking off way quicker than I expected, actually. Like, I'm a huge L2 ball, but it's actually just amazing how quickly we've already seen the kind of, I guess not only the volumes grow on L2 exchanges, as I described the other day, but projects adopting it. Synthetix is going full steam ahead with optimism right now. You know, Uniswap is already confirmed to be working with optimism chain link as well.
00:09:18.228 - 00:09:38.388, Speaker A: You know, Kane put out a teaser tweet today, which I've got here, that I'll talk to a little bit more later about. Like, there's going to be more projects, you know, kind of adopting optimistic ethereum than people think. So L2 is incredibly bullish, and it's coming at the right time as well. It's coming when gas fees are high. People are feeling the pain. We feel like we're on dial up Internet. We need to get to broadband.
00:09:38.388 - 00:09:53.344, Speaker A: So that's. That's another thing there. And I talk about L2 a lot, so I won't go into too much more detail there. Um, so, yeah, on the gas fees note, even though the gas fees are high, right, people are still using the chain. Like, I don't. People always say, me, isn't this bearish for ETH? And I. And I kind of.
00:09:53.344 - 00:10:18.752, Speaker A: I kind of say to them, like, so you're saying that people having to buy ETH to pay for gas fees is bearish for ETH, right? And they're like, oh, oh, I didn't think of it like that. I'm like, well, you know, I just. I don't see how people using the chain, having to buy ETH to use the chain, right. And using the chain with that ETH, too, as, like, trustless collateral in Defi or using it as a productive asset in Defi, I just don't understand how that can be bearish.
00:10:18.808 - 00:10:19.120, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:19.192 - 00:10:55.518, Speaker A: How can it be bearish that something is being used, like just because the gas fees are high? And I get it, you know, not everyone can afford those gas fees. I mean, at times it really annoys me too, having to pay them, right? But at the end of the day, if you're willing to pay the gas fee, then it means that transaction is worth more to you than the fee. So you still, I mean, should net out profitably, right, depending on what you're doing. If you're speculating on tokens and you're taking a risk or whatever. But, you know, at the end of the day, you know, if you are doing those transactions, they mean stuff to you. And if you're priced out of those transactions, then, I mean, I get that. And we're going to fix that with L2, hopefully, and some other different solutions, you know, coming online there.
00:10:55.518 - 00:11:48.164, Speaker A: But just in general as well, the narrative around Ethereum being, you know, the most used blockchain, it's, it's, I went on crypto fees the other day and I think Ethereum is being used like four or five times more than bitcoin in terms of fees, right? So that narrative is extremely powerful. Very, very powerful, right. Because it makes people kind of question things. They're like, well, you know, fee revenue is one metric you can't game because to game it, you have to actually spend money, right? So I mean, you can game it, but it's extremely hard and extremely expensive to game it. So people kind of think like, okay, well, if people are willing to kind of like spend this much money to use Ethereum, then how is this not bullish for Ethereum, right? How is this not bullish for the entire ecosystem? You know, the rational people and the people paying attention know that we're fixing a lot of this stuff with L2. And, you know, the end users won't have to deal with this forever. So that's, you know, the high gas fees have always been incredibly bullish for me.
00:11:48.164 - 00:12:16.698, Speaker A: And another reason is because it encourages the adoption of L2 as well, which I've spoken about in the past. So. Yeah. And then next up we have the ETH two launch, right? The ETH two beacon chain, launch phase zero, whatever you want to call it, went so smooth, it's insane, right? I think even the researchers and developers were very, very surprised by how smooth it went. I think they were confident in it because we did so many test nets, but it was literally a perfect launch. I don't think anything could have gone better than how it went.
00:12:16.746 - 00:12:17.074, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:17.154 - 00:12:21.490, Speaker A: We got up to over 95% participation from validators very quickly.
00:12:21.602 - 00:12:21.946, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:22.010 - 00:12:27.078, Speaker A: The slashing mechanisms work correctly. The chain hasn't halted. The chain hasn't needed to be restarted.
00:12:27.186 - 00:12:27.526, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:27.590 - 00:12:51.534, Speaker A: Clients are working as they should. They're talking to each other. Everything went so smoothly that it was a massive vote of confidence for the Ethereum ecosystem, especially because we hit the minimum ETH required to launch ETH two on the date that we were supposed to do. And I remember that day as one of my, one of the best days of my life. Like, not, not even kidding. That was just such an awesome day to be in the Ethereum ecosystem. So that was a massive validation of Ethereum and ETH.
00:12:51.574 - 00:12:52.158, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:52.326 - 00:13:30.112, Speaker A: And now the work on e two, while it's quiet, it's continuing. They're doing the first hard fork in the middle in July for the beacon chain to add a bunch of new things to it and to, and to kind of make some tweaks to the penalties of slashing, because it was actually set to be weaker penalties at the start, and they're going to put in the original penalties now. And, you know, things like sharding is coming along and the other kind of like things coming into ETH two with the merger and stuff as well, was coming along. So, yeah, that's all going really well as well. So that's another reason why, you know, I'm really bullish. And on that note, in terms of, like, Ethereum protocol development, EIP 1559.
00:13:30.168 - 00:13:30.764, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:31.104 - 00:14:08.600, Speaker A: That now just the narrative that EIP 1559 is coming, even though we don't know exactly when it's coming, is also incredibly powerful, because I think people understand how 1559 can add value to ETH asset, how it can smoothen out the transactions on Ethereum. You know, it's not going to fix the high gas fee problem. I want to make that clear. But it will act as a way to smoothen out transactions to give us better fee estimations and to give us an on chain kind of gas oracle or gas price oracle to, to help with that, that kind of fee estimation as well. So. And then that's closer than you think. I think, you know, people are thinking that it's not, it's like a year away.
00:14:08.600 - 00:14:23.334, Speaker A: I don't think it's a year away. And I've speculated before that I thought it would come in July and or August. Pure speculation. Do not quote me on that. I'm just speculating. But I've said that before, you know, I have relative confidence in that. But we'll see how we go there.
00:14:23.334 - 00:14:51.028, Speaker A: Next up is NFTs and crypto art. Do you know how many people, new people are coming into ethereum right now because of nfTs, right, that have zero interest in Defi, in Daos, in Ethereum protocol stuff, right? They, they don't really care too much about that stuff. But what they do care about is, is collectibles. They care about art. They care about digital art. Once they get it right, artists are coming in, tokenizing their art, getting value out of it. This kind of whole space has just blown up.
00:14:51.028 - 00:15:22.474, Speaker A: And it is amazing because it's bringing in a new set of people into ethereum that would have never come into ethereum through any other of the many dwarves. I think, you know, maybe they would have used DeFi one day, but not as part of a theory. And maybe they were using DeFi through some kind of broker or centralized kind of exchange. Exchange or something. So to see them actually, you know, maybe download metamask or download a crypto wallet, interact with nfTs, buy crypto art, you know, buy it with ETH, because the entire NFT space is actually denominated in ETH because ETH is money. So no one can say that ETH isn't money anymore. Just going to make that statement.
00:15:22.474 - 00:16:10.462, Speaker A: So that's incredibly bullish, right? The ETH price being this high is also incredibly bullish because it validates all the work that we've been doing, right? If eats price was stagnant, even after everything that's happened, the, the growth of defi, ETH two launching, right? DeFi being validated as a use case, tradfi coming in, L2 work, right? The gas fees being high, you know, all this sort of stuff, people understanding ETH as a financial asset more. If the ETH price was still low, that would be, you know, incredibly bearish, right? That would mean that no one cares to buy ETH, even though all this stuff is kind of adding value to it. But that didn't happen. Ethy is over $1,600. Yeah, $1600. Like, if you told me that ETH was going to be over $1600 in February, like, even a few months ago, I would have called you insane, because ETH was $400 in November. 400 in November.
00:16:10.518 - 00:16:10.686, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:10.710 - 00:16:11.734, Speaker A: November was three months ago.
00:16:11.814 - 00:16:12.150, Speaker B: Ah.
00:16:12.222 - 00:16:44.108, Speaker A: Like, seriously? So the ETH price being as high as it is and continuing to grow is massive validation, and it's reflexive. So the higher the ETH price goes, the more bullish people get, right? And then it just kind of like snowballs from there. And because of the ETH price being high and other defi tokens kind of going up as well. There is so much more money in this ecosystem now, right? There's so much more money to fund development of things to get people hired and people coming into the ecosystem wanting jobs. We can hire them. We can do awesome bitcoin grants around where millions of dollars are given to open source.
00:16:44.156 - 00:16:44.748, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:44.916 - 00:17:22.978, Speaker A: People are quitting their jobs to work full time on, like, whatever they want to work with in Ethereum, right? So that's obviously a byproduct of the ETH price going up. And it's, you know, it's amazing, right? It's absolutely amazing. And this is why I care so much about the ETH price going up. Or at least one of the reasons, obviously I care about it for other reasons, but one of the main reasons is because of the fact that when we're in a bear market, people have to grind. You know, people have to kind of be very conservative and try and make it through because you never know when the bull market's coming back. And in saying that, this bull market's not going to last forever. So if anyone from any of like teams are listening, any kind of founders, just make sure you have enough Runway, you know, for the next few years.
00:17:22.978 - 00:17:43.946, Speaker A: Don't rely on the bull market sticking around forever. And don't put your entire treasury into volatile crypto assets. Keep some in stable coins. Not, not, not like investment advice or anything. But I think that's just prudent kind of treasury management. But anyway, that's the kind of note there. And then lastly, all of the on chain metrics that I'm monitoring for Ethereum are going absolutely bananas.
00:17:43.946 - 00:18:08.012, Speaker A: They're incredibly bullish. They've never been more bullish. And I'm not going to go into each of them now because I actually have a dedicated video coming out for that on the weekend. I call them the daily grade data pumps. I put out one so far, which covered, I think, November or December or I think it covered November. I'm going to put out one this weekend that covers December and January. And I'm going to show you what metrics you need to look at to kind of track this bullishness and why it's bullish.
00:18:08.068 - 00:18:08.524, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:08.644 - 00:18:29.984, Speaker A: So, yeah, look forward to that. Subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet, because you'll be able to, you'll miss that if you don't. So, yeah, that is, that tweet expanded for 18 minutes. Oh, boy. Okay. I spent a long time on that. But this is why I couldn't do it on Twitter, because I explain things a lot better when I'm talking to, you know, talking, you know, basically to an audience like you, like all of you watching.
00:18:29.984 - 00:19:01.032, Speaker A: And I hope that you kind of are as bullish as I am. I mean, you know, I just got myself even more bullish talking about all that. So, yeah, anyway, I'm going to move on to the rest of the stuff I wanted to talk about, but that's, that's that tweet in a, not in a nutshell, I guess. Like just, just summarize basically. Yeah. As I said while I was explaining about that tweet, the CME futures are launching on Monday. You know, I kind of lost track of the dates because of like, COVID and because of just like, the bull market, I kind of lose track of time, if I'm being honest.
00:19:01.032 - 00:19:21.262, Speaker A: And then I realized before, I'm like, oh, it's Feb. Fifth. Oh, wait, CME ETH fugitives are launching February 8. Oh, wait, that's Monday. And then I just put out this tweet. I'm like, y'all are aware that the CME futures are launching on Monday, right? So, yeah, that's why I put out that tweet there. And as I was talking about before on L2, I mean, Kane put out this tweet today saying optimistic ethereum.
00:19:21.262 - 00:20:04.072, Speaker A: So this oe that you see here on screen stands for optimistic Ethereum. So he said, optimistic ethereum native projects are coming and sooner than you might think. I mean, I just explained what he meant by that, how, you know, there is more kind of projects coming to the optimism kind of ecosystem than you think you think maybe it's just synthetix and uniswap, but there are actually more coming. I don't know exactly what, which ones are coming or which ones aren't, but their technology is ready and people need scaling now. So there are definitely a lot of projects kind of talking to them, looking into L2 solutions, looking into which solutions kind of, I guess, work best for them. So that, I think that's what kind of Kane meant by this tweet here. So a really great tweet thread from Darrell here from Mechanism Capital.
00:20:04.072 - 00:21:06.860, Speaker A: So he basically puts, put together this thread and says that market cap, or fully diluted value TVL is a meme metric that really only considers things from surface level and should never be the only metric which you use to approach an investment in Defi. Now, we all know what market cap is, right? And we all know what the fully diluted value is at least I hope we do. So let me explain the difference if you don't. So, market cap is basically the current price of the asset times the current circulating supply of the token, all right? Fully diluted value as a kind of difference in market cap, right? It's still referred to as kind of market cap, but what the fully diluted value measures is the current price of the token times the total supply of the token, right? So you could have, say, 1 million tokens that you'll ever have, but only 100,000 of them are issued. So your market cap would actually be 10% of the value of your fully diluted market cap. And people look at that and they get bearish, right? They're like, okay, well, this thing's already worth a billion dollars. Even though the market caps are only 100 million.
00:21:06.860 - 00:21:32.464, Speaker A: That means there's $900 million more kind of tokens coming to market. That means I'm gonna get dumped on. But that's, as Darryl says here, that's a very surface level understanding of how these things work. You need to one understand how those tokens are coming into the market, right? The rate at which they're coming into the market, who they belong to. As an investor myself, I can tell you right now, a lot of investors don't just get their tokens and go to uniswap and market dump them. That's just not how it works.
00:21:32.504 - 00:21:32.896, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:33.000 - 00:22:24.714, Speaker A: They, they work very differently to, to kind of retail investors. Um, but just by nature, right? Some of them will, some of them are mercenaries. I'm not going to call any, any out or whatever, but they don't, you know, they're smart enough not to do that, right? And also, a lot of them are in it for like a hundred times, a thousand times. They're not in it for like a ten times. Like, I know that sounds crazy, but, you know, they want to return as much money as they can for their fund. So they're not, if they're bullish on a project and think that it's still, you know, got a lot of growth left in it, there's, this is, this is the mistake that I think, you know, retail investors make, and I've made a lot in the past, is that, you know, you get it ten times on something, right? Like, hopefully some of you have had that experience before and you'll sell because you'd be like, oh, it's already gone up ten times, right? How much more can it go? And then you see it go up even more, and then it goes up even more, and then it goes up even more. As an example, imagine you bought ETH at a dollar, then it went to ten, and you sold.
00:22:24.794 - 00:22:25.154, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:25.234 - 00:22:29.970, Speaker A: Then in 20, you sold in 2016, and then in 2017, it went to $1,400.
00:22:30.082 - 00:22:30.378, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:30.426 - 00:23:09.460, Speaker A: Case in point, not investment advice, but if you were bullish on an asset, right, and you're selling because it's already gone up a lot, it's just. That's just not a great investment strategy in my eyes. And that's not the investment strategy that funds use either. So most funds, at least some of them, you know, it's kind of like some of them are definitely mercenary. But other than that, you know, Daryl also goes through that, you know, looking at the TVL in. In different deFi apps, like, what is that TVL being used for? So TVL stands for total value locked, which is the amount of capital in the system in that protocol. And he basically says, yeah, what's it used for? What percent is put to work? Is it sticky? How can it grow?
00:23:09.532 - 00:23:09.716, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:09.740 - 00:23:35.582, Speaker A: How can it ten x, where is the value being captured and retained and things like that? And then he goes through some examples here of each of them. I'll link these three. You can read through the whole thing, because I know I'm going to go over time if I talk too much about this, but, yeah, basically, you know, it's funny because, like, it's kind of hard in a bull market to do fundamental analysis on this stuff. I'm going to give you one example and then I'll move on. The uni token, last time I checked, was worth $20 billion fully diluted.
00:23:35.668 - 00:23:36.106, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:36.210 - 00:23:39.538, Speaker A: The uni token cut currently doesn't capture any value.
00:23:39.666 - 00:23:40.170, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:40.282 - 00:23:46.834, Speaker A: It is only a governance token. But if you saw that and you said, okay, well, it's already worth 20 billion fully diluted.
00:23:46.874 - 00:23:47.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:47.594 - 00:24:08.414, Speaker A: It doesn't do anything. It's only governance. It's overvalued. That, again, is a surface level understanding what you are buying, when you're buying union. What you're betting on is that the fee kind of capture will get turned on. You're betting that Uniswap volumes are going to keep exploding in growth, right? You're betting that Uniswap as a platform has extremely sticky TVL, which I think it does. We've seen that play out before.
00:24:08.414 - 00:24:17.234, Speaker A: And you're betting on the Uniswap team being able to continue innovating and v three to be like everything we want and all that sort of stuff.
00:24:17.274 - 00:24:17.714, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:17.834 - 00:24:49.354, Speaker A: And not just the Uniswap core team, but like the whole ecosystem. So if you just look at something and say, oh, it's only a governance token, right? That just is. So is a very surface level understanding of what these things can be. And if you really think about it, a governance token, when done correctly within these protocols, can be used to do anything. It can be used to do absolutely anything, right? Turn on fee capture, burn tokens for whatever reason, add new features, add new fee revenue, like all this sort of stuff. Add new kind of like, value capture mechanisms for the token. So I think that's just a good thing to keep in mind there.
00:24:49.354 - 00:25:29.640, Speaker A: So the Jiho from Axie Infinity put out this tweet today and I'll read it out. So he goes, think gas is expensive? Try sending out your Pokemon cards to PSA for grading shipping plus grading fee. NFTs are a ten times improvement, even on the Ethereum main net. Now, for those who don't know, the Pokemon trading card game is a pretty popular kind of card game in the world. Not so much for the game aspect of it, but for the collectible aspect of it. I'm personally a very big collector, or was, at least I don't collect the newer editions, but the older sets from like the late nineties, early two thousands are worth a lot. Now, what people do is that they'll get their cards graded, like the quality of them graded.
00:25:29.640 - 00:26:29.606, Speaker A: And PSA is one of the grading kind of companies, but to get it graded, you have to ship it to them and then pay a grading fee. Now, when you ship it to them, you're not just shipping it to them in an envelope, even though it's a card, you're shipping it to them with insurance on it, right? You're shipping it in a very, like, kind of like maybe a box with like, glide wrap all around it and, like, protect it as much as you can. Because if you're getting a card graded, that means that you know that that card's worth a lot already, right? Even ungraded cards are worth a lot. So what ends up happening is you pay this enormous shipping fee, you pay this enormous grading fee just to have the, the quality and the authenticity of your card verified by this third party, right? And then, you know, and then he goes on to say that NFTs are a ten times improvement on this, even though the gas is high and they are. I've spoken about nfTs, you know, I think, a few days ago, but basically, you know, you can kind of verify that an NFT is legit and kind of like cryptographically legit because it's on the ethereum blockchain and you can see that it is not a copy or anything like that. It's not a fake.
00:26:29.710 - 00:26:30.118, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:30.206 - 00:26:46.440, Speaker A: And the quality of it, I mean, the quality doesn't deteriorate because it's not a physical object. So, yeah, this is. This is kind of the same argument with, I guess, like, comparing BTC to gold and, like, all the different kind of benefits to that, I think comparing physical collectibles to NFTs also has benefits.
00:26:46.512 - 00:26:47.056, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:47.200 - 00:27:20.264, Speaker A: But in saying that, and, I mean, you can see behind me, I have tons of physical collectibles that I really wouldn't care to own as digital collectibles, if I'm being honest, because there's like, a difference there. But I still think Jiho's point stands here. So, yeah, I thought this was an interesting tweet. All right, so this was very interesting today from Coinmetric. So they put out this chart that shows that ETH daily transaction fees yesterday topped $22 million with. Which is an all time record for crypto fees across any blockchains. It beat BTC's all time high of $21.4
00:27:20.264 - 00:27:30.456, Speaker A: million in December of 2017. And you guys will remember that December 2017 was the top of the BTC bull market. So BTC went to 20k then and topped out there.
00:27:30.560 - 00:27:31.112, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:31.248 - 00:27:45.160, Speaker A: And the fees, obviously, on the chart, you can see, spiked up very high. But basically, yeah. On Ethereum yesterday, $22 million was an all time record across not just Ethereum, but also bitcoin, which I thought was. Was huge.
00:27:45.192 - 00:27:45.336, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:45.360 - 00:28:06.664, Speaker A: And I don't think we're done yet. I think we're going to go past this 22 million. As the bull market heats up, I can see us going to, like, $50 million daily fees. And, yes, that means the guy price is going to go higher than it is today. You know, it's around, what, 185 right now. You know, it's probably going to go to like, what, God, 4500 or something, I'm sorry to say. But I just don't see how it's going to go down with all of the new people coming in.
00:28:06.664 - 00:28:37.934, Speaker A: But we'll see, right? Maybe it'll find an equilibrium and we'll find, like, a place that it wants to settle down at. But, yeah, yeah, we'll see. So, yeah, this was just incredibly bullish to see, I think. So, speaking of gas, will price put out this interesting tweet today that basically says that Coinbase currently uses 25% of all ETH block space. Now, I wrote about this in the Daily Gray newsletter, and you can go read that for a deeper breakdown here. But we'll suggest here that with a different architecture, they would be able to save 20% to 40% on gas. Like use 20, 40% less gas.
00:28:37.934 - 00:28:54.790, Speaker A: Now, Coinbase obviously is the biggest US based exchange. They interact a lot with the Ethereum blockchain, right. With, you know, people wanting to withdraw to it. And they do a bunch of other stuff with it too. I think they do some defi stuff with, with their addresses and things like that. So, you know, they. The fact that they're using so much block space is incredible.
00:28:54.790 - 00:29:26.112, Speaker A: That's a quarter of all Ethereum block space, right? You know, that's a quarter of the Ethereum network just being used by one entity and, you know, the other entities that are using air, like Uniswap, the contract and the ERC 20 contract for tether up, two of the other big gas guzzlers. So, yeah, I just thought this was a really interesting start. And in the Daily Gwei newsletter today, I wrote about how different entities can be better stewards for the blockchain, for block space. They, you know, as Will says here, Coinbase could improve their architecture and save up to 40% on gas.
00:29:26.168 - 00:29:26.792, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:26.968 - 00:30:18.614, Speaker A: That's, that's the same principle applies for anyone using the chain. But I'll let you read the newsletter in the Daily Gray if you want to hear more about that without kind of diving too much into it today. So Block native has announced today that they partnered with curve finance to basically monitor transactions in the mempool and give, and give kind of notifications on curves, front end here. Now, for those who don't know what block native is, they're basically kind of, they call themselves masters of the mempool. And I guess for those who don't know what the mempool is, the mempool is where all the transactions go before they're included in a block. So whenever you put a transaction and you're waiting for it to be confirmed, it's in the mempool. And that's, that's kind of like where all this, I guess, stuff happens around the dark forest and, you know, mev, those maybe words you've heard before and front running and stuff like that, that all happens in the mempool before it's actually included in the official ethereum blockchain, or in a block, in other words.
00:30:18.614 - 00:31:04.472, Speaker A: So, yeah, block native is the kind of the masters of that. They monitor it with all their infrastructure and that allows them to give really fast and sometimes like real time and accurate notifications when you're interacting with things. So say you kind of interact with curve, it'll pop up a notification for you on Curb's front end that says you know, you've done this and then as soon as it confirms it'll tell you it's confirmed. And, and you know, there's a bunch of other kind of pieces that fall into that. So yeah, if you haven't checked that out yet, I definitely suggest checking it out. And they also have what's called a mempool explorer, so you can actually have like look into the mempool and see what's going on there. Now us regular folk probably don't need to do that, but people like traders would like to do this because if they want to see what's going on in the mempool and kind of monitor what people are buying and selling and things like that, or people building bots and stuff will want to do that.
00:31:04.472 - 00:31:51.022, Speaker A: So if that's you, definitely go check that out. Alright, the last thing to talk about today, and I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about this, I know I've gone over time, but I have to talk about this. So the latest DeFi exploit featuring yearn finance. So an attacker profited $513,000 worth of DAI, $1.7 million worth of USDT and $506,000 worth of three crv, which is the three, the pool lp token of the three crv curve pool basically. So I'll let you read this thread, I'll link it in the YouTube description because I'm not going to read out the whole thing, but basically Igor here describes how it works. And you could probably guess it was a flash loan related attack where someone flash loaned a bunch of ETH, right, they off Dydx and Aave.
00:31:51.022 - 00:32:37.722, Speaker A: Then they borrowed stable coins using that ETH as cloud run compound. Then they kind of did some stuff in curve and kind of exploited some weaknesses with I guess with, with curve and how they do like I guess pricing of the different stable coins and then kind of profited from that basically. So I think I'll let you read this thread, I'll put it in the YouTube description, but I think I saw one of the yearn finance team members say that the response time to this was about ten minutes, which is actually quite good. So they were able to freeze, I think, the hacker out and kind of make sure that no more money could be drained with this exploit, which I thought was pretty cool within ten minutes. But this also kind of like, falls back to, I guess, just the general defi security.
00:32:37.818 - 00:32:38.050, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:38.082 - 00:32:50.824, Speaker A: Like, people probably assumed that yearn was one of the safer protocols, and it turns out it wasn't. Unfortunately. Um, I'm gonna say straight up, you, you know, you're never 100% safe in defi. You're never 100% safe in c five.
00:32:50.904 - 00:32:51.264, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:51.344 - 00:33:06.584, Speaker A: There's varying kind of degrees of safety and security, and you have to kind of be comfortable with how much risk you take on. So, you know, I would say that some of the safest protocols in DeFi are the ones that have been around for a while and never suffered an exploit like. Like this.
00:33:06.624 - 00:33:07.040, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:07.152 - 00:33:12.626, Speaker A: And those would. There's only a handful of those. I think there's uniswap maker and compound.
00:33:12.770 - 00:33:13.074, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:13.114 - 00:33:30.650, Speaker A: But maker and compound have also suffered kind of issues where on compound they were, they weren't using a robust enough oracle. So what ended up happening was that, and I spoke about this before, and you might remember, was that there was an oracle exploit where the price of DAI went up to like a dollar 20 or a dollar 30. And compound read that as a dollar 30.
00:33:30.722 - 00:33:31.026, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:31.090 - 00:34:01.692, Speaker A: Even though it wasn't actually a dollar 30. And they liquidated millions of dollars of positions. And with Maker, you might remember from March 2020 where someone was able to buy up a bunch of ETH collateral at zero Dai, basically because of, I guess the keepers kind of bugged out. Basically, the keeper bots are the liquidator bots, essentially, and they just weren't there to kind of pay the fair price. So, yeah, even the quote unquote safest protocols have still suffered from kind of these exploits and things like that.
00:34:01.748 - 00:34:02.012, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:02.068 - 00:34:22.668, Speaker A: Or kind of like something got to do with, with an economic exploit, which unfortunately isn't the aim of the game, the name of the game right now because we're so early still. We're still, as I've said before, we're still in the pioneer phase. You know, there's still a lot of risk. So you need to be comfortable with that risk. But, yeah, I'll link this in this description. You can go check it out along with everything else. But this has been a long refuel today.
00:34:22.668 - 00:34:41.760, Speaker A: So thanks for, for sticking with me for today's episode. And that's it. So if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet, be sure to do so. Give the video a thumbs up and join the Discord channel. Subscribe to the Daily Gray newsletter and I will catch you all next weekend.
