00:00:07.680 - 00:00:47.055, Speaker A: To the Deep in podcast. I'm your host, Tom Trowbridge. Thrilled to have you here and to be back with us where we go into everything deep in all the top projects, top investors and top people in the ecosystem. We have here Ariel Sideman with us, founder of hivemapper, which is one of the very high profile Deepin projects that's live, operating, working, scaling in a way that is, you know, really shows the industry what can happen. And I'm excited to have him with us. So with that, Ariel, welcome and you know, want to dive in. First question I usually ask people is how do you define depin? There's a lot of, a lot of different definitions and I kind of want to make sure we can coalesce on one.
00:00:47.355 - 00:01:17.715, Speaker B: Yeah, well, first of all, thank you for having me. It's a lot of fun. We got to meet each other relatively a couple weeks ago and I just really loved, kind of like what you're doing with Fluence and like love your approach to specifically the tokenomics. So, yeah, really happy to be here. In terms of how we define how I define Deepin, decentralized physical infrastructure. Infrastructure that enables the creation of a new product. Right.
00:01:17.715 - 00:02:11.765, Speaker B: And so in our case that's maps and the infrastructure that's required in our case is these devices. And those devices need to be physically distributed all over the world into very specific locations. Now there are some projects like ours where that's literally like you need a specific device in a specific location down to the intersection levels. There's other projects in the deep end category where yes, that location matters, but maybe not quite as localized or that granular of a location. So in the case of, let's say, helium, it is certainly beneficial to have, or it is a requirement, I should say, to have their hotspots in very specific locations. But you can go down to let's say a kilometer or three kilometers or five kilometers. Right.
00:02:11.765 - 00:02:58.977, Speaker B: In your case, Fluence, obviously you need these data centers, the specific hardware, and you need that distributed all over the world. If you are providing services, and you tell me if I am wrong, but if you're providing services to customers in Australia out of infrastructure that's located here in the United States, that is obviously not as good as having physical infrastructure local in Australia, given the latency and so forth. And so that's how I really think about this decentralized infrastructure. I think it's still relatively new concept for the crypto community. I think they're still wrapping their heads around it. So we'll kind of let the Community as a whole. Figure out what this means for all these different projects.
00:02:59.121 - 00:03:37.841, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I agree with all the comments you made. I think something that ties it in together is something along the lines of crowdsourced physical infrastructure bound together by a software layer into a network secured by and incented by crypto economics. And so it kind of wraps all those things in, and that encompasses a lot. But everything you said certainly makes sense and I think is critical. And you sort of, you know, touched on a little bit of hivemapper kind of specifics with regard to what matters for you versus others. But why don't you give us an introduction to hivemapper for, you know, I think most people probably know of it, but let's. Let's hear your introduction to it.
00:03:37.993 - 00:04:25.691, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the part that you added there, which I think, and you said it very well, is that coordination part, right? Where you're all. You're coordinating the activities of all these disparate parties to come together to create something that is fundamentally useful for customers. And the crypto incentive is a really clever and very useful mechanism to go do that. So, yeah, in the case of hivemapper, we're building this incredibly fresh global map of the world. There really hasn't been a new map that's been created on a global level since back in 2010, 2012 timeframe, which was Waze. Okay, so I'm going to first describe a little bit about how it works, and then I'll talk a little bit about why we're taking the approach that we're taking, and we can go unravel this a little bit more. So you deploy this, you buy this dash cam from us.
00:04:25.691 - 00:05:09.185, Speaker B: It looks and smells like every other dash cam in the world, but it does have some critical technology that makes it an incredible mapper. Right. Whether it be high positional accuracy, in other words, we know where that device is, whether it be the stereo cameras, whether it be the ability to run all of the map AI module modules that actually build the map on the device. So that's one mode of contribution, Right. Those are effectively the eyes of this mapping network that we're creating. Another way to contribute is through these AI trainers. These folks are effectively doing data labeling that train the map AI models to be able to detect and then classify and then position objects.
00:05:09.185 - 00:05:49.037, Speaker B: Right. So this is a speed limit sign, a stop sign, lane definitions, all of that, really, the things that make up a map. So that's really the brains of the, of our mapping network. And then we serve three different markets, the first market that we serve is other businesses. Look, if you never use Google Maps on your phone, you are still interacting with Google Maps throughout your day, right? You go to Uber, you go to Lyft, you go to Airbnb, you go to a government application, you go to insurance. You know, you're driving an autonomous car. Potentially a lot of that data is actually powered by Google Maps, right? So that, that is a very large market.
00:05:49.037 - 00:06:30.907, Speaker B: Millions of customers, businesses utilize maps and pay for integration of those maps into their products. The second category is autonomous vehicles. Right? And so this is everything from level two, which is commonly referred to as ADAs. So you're still the driver of the vehicle, but you're monitoring it to ensure that it doesn't do anything stupid. And so, you know, the car will drive itself onto a highway, drive itself was on a highway all the way up to level four, which is effectively a robo taxi, like a Waymo or Cruise. And we have customers in both of those two different customer sites in those segments or markets. The third market that we're still not there quite yet, but we'll be there probably next year, is a consumer navigation app.
00:06:30.907 - 00:06:51.561, Speaker B: Right. And so we believe that with eyes everywhere, that we can build ultimately a much, much fresher map than Google. Why? It's pretty simple. Google fundamentally doesn't know what's happening in a day to day basis, sorry, I should say a minute to minute basis. Okay. So there's a road segment, you know. Okay, yeah.
00:06:51.561 - 00:06:53.881, Speaker B: You know, usually people travel 40 miles an hour.
00:06:54.033 - 00:06:54.449, Speaker A: Boom.
00:06:54.497 - 00:07:21.109, Speaker B: All of a sudden people start to travel 10 miles an hour. Google knows that. Right? Because they have motion, right? In other words, they're tracking their GPS traces and all of a sudden they see that the GPS traces are down and the vehicles are only going 10 miles an hour rather than 40 miles an hour. And so what do they do? They light up that part of the map and ranch saying like, hey, there's a problem here. But they don't know the cause of that problem. Right. Is it because a pedestrian got hit? Right.
00:07:21.109 - 00:07:53.355, Speaker B: Is it because there's a three car crash? Is it a little fender bender? Is it flooding? Right. Is there road construction there? They don't know why. And if you don't know why, you fundamentally can't really provide good guidance to the driver. Right. If it's a three car crash, that crash is going to take a couple hours to clear out. If it's a little fender bender that's going to be moved over to the side in 10, 15 minutes and then you're on your way. But with eyes, you can see what's happening and provide that level of clarity to the consumer that Google simply can't provide today.
00:07:53.355 - 00:08:17.547, Speaker B: And so that's what we're building. We've mapped in the last, since going live about 16 months ago or 18 months ago, we've mapped about 21 or 22% of the global road network. There's over 10,000 devices out there that are actively mapping and we have a backorder list of about 30,000 devices for a new model, which is the beat. So I'll pause there. We can kind of go through it a little bit more.
00:08:17.611 - 00:08:48.267, Speaker A: Well, that's great. And just to recap, because this is in case someone doesn't know. You buy a device, you plug it into your car and that then records video, I believe, and any, anything else besides video. Wherever, wherever you drive and you turn on your car, it's on automatically. And it basically provides a fresh, you know, a fresh, constantly updated map of almost a real time basis of everywhere these, you know, hundreds of thousands of millions of drivers are.
00:08:48.411 - 00:09:12.295, Speaker B: That's right. So, you know, we don't want people driving in order to map. So just like literally like Tom said, it was like you, you buy this dash cam, you install, it takes about 10 minutes to install in your vehicle. And then you just drive like you normally do. You know, you turn the car on, the thing starts, does it itself. Like you don't have to sit there and you know, tap any buttons or do anything every time you get into the car. It literally will just do its own.
00:09:12.295 - 00:09:33.759, Speaker B: You know, if you go into like a very privacy sensitive area, it will automatically stop mapping. If you're worried about it like you know, not mapping your house, it won't map your house. So there's a lot of privacy built into it. And then you can also add additional privacy parameters as well to make sure that it's not mapping in locations that you don't want to be mapped.
00:09:33.927 - 00:09:53.661, Speaker A: Great. Well, you know, this is a, it's not everybody, not the average person that decides to take on Google in any form. And that's effectively what you're doing. So tell, tell us about your background and about how you, you know, what led you to this? Because it is a, it's a, it's a big task you set out.
00:09:53.813 - 00:10:23.513, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah. I mean, look, Google definitely runs around Silicon Valley here and tells everybody like, you know, our mode and mapping is massive. We've been investing in it for the last 20 years. And I think that is True, but it also serves a very specific purpose, which is to instill fear into the minds of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Like, basically you don't want to compete with us. Like it's not worth your time, you have no chance of success.
00:10:23.513 - 00:11:09.867, Speaker B: And I think they've been quite effective at spreading that story and spreading that narrative. But I come from the Look, 20 years from now, if mapping is the exact same way that it is right now, that's a huge lost opportunity for society as a whole. And fundamentally, the maps on your phone, if you go to Google Maps from 2012 or Waze for that matter, and you look at it today, it really hasn't changed. And the reason it hasn't changed is not because like we haven't figured out some cool new user experience or whatever it is. It hasn't changed because there's not a new large scale data collection system that is getting fed into that product and that product experience. Okay, so I was at Yahoo back in the day. That was really my first job out of school.
00:11:09.867 - 00:11:40.729, Speaker B: It was a fun time to be at Yahoo because Yahoo search was still very competitive with Google. We had like 30% market share, they had like 35, you know, in Maps we had like. And I ran the Maps team in the local data team. We had like 90, 95% market share. But then Google to their credit, started to invest a ton, right? They did the Google review program. They had like, you know, their own satellites for a short period of time. They definitely have their own airborne collection system.
00:11:40.729 - 00:12:31.223, Speaker B: So these are literally airplanes flying around major cities collecting data. So they just start to really spend a huge amounts of war amounts of money crawling the physical world. Right. And you know, much to my dismay, Yahoo was not willing to pony up and spend that kind of capital to go and compete with them. And we just lost. You know, in hindsight, obviously, like, you know, that was, that was a big mistake, but it is what it is. So I've kind of been on this journey of trying to figure out a way to build a global incredibly fresh map with eyes, right? It's very obvious to most people in the mapping industry that the new next large scale data collection system will be focused and centered around imagery video on a global scale.
00:12:31.223 - 00:13:39.055, Speaker B: But you know, that sounds. Sure, everybody knows that to a certain extent, but actually executing that is really, really hard. And so I won't bore you with all the details of how we got there, but we've definitely had our pivots and moments where we've had to change course because we went down different dark alleys in terms of trying to solve this problem. But since we started the company in 2016, the mission has always been very clear, very focused, which is how do you build a global fresh map utilizing imagery, video from all these sensors. And so the thing that is challenging in the maps, if you go crowdsourced and you just say, okay, anybody can use any iPhone, any Android, any GoPro, any this, any that, that, you very, very, very quickly compromise on the quality of that map and it just can't be used for that many use cases. Right. And so it sounds good, right? But in reality, the data, and the data quality that you need in order to actually build a map that most customers, at least customers that spend real money will pay for, isn't there.
00:13:39.055 - 00:14:27.517, Speaker B: Right? And so that's why we built our own hardware device. We said, okay, we need to maintain, you know, high quality, but we need to do this in a cost effective way. So yes, we have the crowdsourcing element, yes we have the crypto element, then coordinates and incentivizes. But fundamentally you also need that really high quality hardware device or sensor such that you don't compromise too much on the quality side. And so it's a very, very delicate balance. Right? There's decentralization, obviously is very cost effective, but then the hardware aspect of it, make sure that we maintain that high quality. And that's how I, you know, that that's effectively like the, the balancing act that we've been working on now for six or seven years of getting those different ingredients just right.
00:14:27.517 - 00:14:33.149, Speaker B: So you can then cost effectively scale the map at very, very high levels of quality.
00:14:33.317 - 00:15:21.295, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I guess what I'd say, the first thing you said that resonated with me was the difficulty, I guess I would say, or almost the inability for traditional companies to compete with either Google or an Amazon. And they won't get the funding, people won't do it. And I think about this from the fluent side as well, where the only way to compete with Amazon is if you have a global, global network of developers that are out there that have incentives to do so. And so if you crowdsource and you have a whole community working on it, whether it's for altruism or crypto economics, whatever the incentive mechanism is, that's how you have a chance to, you know, really build something and go after these very formidable opponents. To me, if you try to raise money for one single company that's going to go fund it all and do the capex like that is just you're Just not going to get there. And so. Or at least a much harder role.
00:15:21.295 - 00:15:52.023, Speaker A: So that to me is what depin allows. And you guys are a perfect example of that. Crowdsourcing, being able to effectively challenge one of the great companies in the world. And to that point which you mentioned, it sounds like these elements have come together in the past couple of years in a way that wasn't possible, maybe even when you started the business. Right. But the hardware has to get to the right level. Crypto economics has to be mature enough and you have to be able to distribute it effectively.
00:15:52.023 - 00:16:03.919, Speaker A: Right. So talk about like, I'm guessing this is a hivemapper, would have been difficult to exist in its current form five years ago. Maybe even, maybe even less.
00:16:04.087 - 00:16:39.075, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah, I think about that a lot actually. Like, probably all the pieces started to come together about three or four years ago. And those pieces are the crypto, you know, start to get to a level of maturity and the crypto economic incentives definitely start. You know, Helium was definitely the godfather. I called him the George Washington of mapping of deepen. And so, yes, that was one the hardware aspects of it. The cost was really the critical issue.
00:16:39.075 - 00:17:21.433, Speaker B: And those costs have come down. Right. So whether it be the camera modules, whether it be the compute modules positioning right like there, now you can go out and buy those modules at significant quantities at very, you know, relatively cost effective, and I think they'll just continue to come down. And so you. We could not run all the AI models that we need to run if we didn't have that level of compute at the price point that we get it at today. And then, yeah, the third, the third aspect of this is the actual AI models themselves. There's a lot of stuff now in the open source domain that allows us to, you know, very quickly iterate on object detection as an example.
00:17:21.433 - 00:17:50.905, Speaker B: Right. So speed limit signs, stop signs, turn restriction signs, lane definitions. If we had to build all of those AI models from scratch ourselves, you know, we would have to have a team of 35, 40 R&D AI engineers. You know, that would be incredibly expensive, obviously, if you know how much those engineers cost. So, yeah, those three things kind of came together at a very specific moment in time, then unlocks this opportunity for us.
00:17:52.285 - 00:18:14.085, Speaker A: That's terrific. I think this is just a perfect example of those things happening. And indeed, I think that is almost what exemplifies Deepin, where you can look at that with helium. You can look at it with, you know, a number of these different projects, you know, you know, weather, XM they're building their own hardware. Helium is building their own hardware. Right. Everyone's doing that in a way that wasn't possible a bunch, you know, just five years ago.
00:18:14.085 - 00:18:27.825, Speaker A: One thing you mentioned is obviously the crypto economics piece. So can you talk about how the economics work? Like, what do you buy a device for what you earn from it? And how did those economics work over time for people?
00:18:27.985 - 00:19:24.395, Speaker B: Yeah, so you're rewarded for either driving with the dash cam or doing AI trainers. Those are the two primary modes of contribution, and those are the two primary modes of earning our honey token, which is the reward mechanism. And so the basic concept is that drivers definitely earn more than AI trainers because there is a physical investment of buying the dash cam. So I think that makes sense. You know, it definitely depends on where you're driving. Right. So if you're driving in like the middle of nowhere, some little small town or some, you know, highway in the middle of nowhere, you will definitely not earn nearly as much as somebody driving, you know, downtown Los Angeles, downtown London, Tokyo, you know, the major metropolitan areas of this world where most human activity or human economic activity occurs.
00:19:24.395 - 00:20:22.027, Speaker B: And so in the AI trainers is really based upon, like, the complexity of the specific data labeling or map editing tasks that you're doing that determines how much you're earning. So the way it works is, okay, you know, you earn honey tokens in order to contribute to the map. And then customers who are then buying all of our data products, they're paying in cash. And so they, let's say they, they spend $100,000 buying map data or one of our MAP API data products, then roughly 30, 40% of that $100,000 contracts goes towards licensing data from the mapping network. So just make this simple. So, okay, we take $35,000, let's say from that $100,000 contract, we have to go buy honey tokens from the open market. So we go buy whatever X amount of honey tokens from the open market.
00:20:22.027 - 00:20:46.027, Speaker B: So let's just. I'm just making these numbers up. Let's say that's a million honey tokens. We go burn those million honey tokens and then we mint a subset of that. So roughly 25% of that get minted again for the for future to support kind of future rewards from new contributors or existing contributors for new work. Right. To continue to sustain and build the map and so forth.
00:20:46.027 - 00:21:09.203, Speaker B: And so it is, has this like, deflationary aspect of it that's kind of built into the core protocol. So that's at a very high Level kind of how it happens. You know, we're still in the early days. There's burn transactions that happen on a weekly monthly basis from customers and then there's rewards that go out to contributors for new work every single week. So that's, that's at a very high level how it works.
00:21:09.379 - 00:21:27.195, Speaker A: And so can you help understand, like, how much people can make by, you know, depending on where you're driving, like, make it as specific as possible, whether it's a. Just as an indicative example, like you pay extra, the device, and if you're in Wyoming, you may earn this. If you're in Tokyo, you may earn this. And there's variables that can affect that impact it.
00:21:27.355 - 00:23:21.767, Speaker B: There's some, yeah, there's some, definitely some calculators that are, you know, I don't, I don't want to share exactly how much because it will definitely vary quite a bit, right? And obviously the honey token price also, like is, is, you know, moves all over the place. So I think I say now will be outdated pretty quickly. You know, there's definitely a lot of people, I will say this, that, you know, people who are driving. If you're an Uber driver, Lyft driver, you're driving a ton and you're driving, you know, so you're driving 25 to 40 hours a week and you're driving in a high value, large metropolitan area, you know, like a Tokyo, like a London and a Los Angeles, a San Francisco, you know, from a Ward perspective, you will do very well, right? If you're like not driving a ton, you just like maybe drive, you know, to the restaurant to meet up with some buddies or, you know, to church on Sundays or whatever it is, like, you just won't do as well, right? And so I think it's, you know, what we've seen, and we talked about this a little bit, Tom, is like, we've seen a, over time, a more and more professionalization, right? Professionals who are professional drivers, commercial fleets, et cetera, starting to get into mapping why A, they're always on the road. And so, you know, anything that they're earning from the honey tokens is like icing on the cake for them. They're not going out there specifically to drive. And B, many of them actually benefits from features and capabilities on the device, right? So like you get into an accident, you get into a fender bender, whatever, something happens, you have the imagery available to you so you can prove to your boss or insurance purposes, whatever it is, that you were not at fault, right? And with the new device The B that will, the number of capabilities and features around safety and compliance and stuff like that that we're going to add to the mix for commercial fleets will be far more sophisticated than we provide today.
00:23:21.767 - 00:23:48.675, Speaker B: And so that's going to open up even more commercial fleets for us. And that gets back to this point of we definitely prefer folks who are like, view the dash cam as. And I should say the rewards associated with the dash cam is icing on the cake. Right? I need the dash cam, I drive a lot, you know, I want that thing there for safety compliance purposes. And the honey rewards is like the fun, you know, icing on the cake.
00:23:49.175 - 00:23:52.639, Speaker A: And how much are the dash cams now? How much is the new one?
00:23:52.807 - 00:24:23.537, Speaker B: The new one is 550. There's different promotions that get run sometimes and so forth. But if you look at, if you look at that device, you know, a lot of people would be like, wait, I can go buy a dash cam for 100 bucks or something like that. Sure you can. Like the capabilities of that hundred dollar device are definitely not at the same level of what you're going to be getting in terms of this device. If you go and compare like what we have to the higher end devices out there, you know, we're definitely very competitive from a pricing perspective.
00:24:23.721 - 00:24:40.983, Speaker A: And on top of that, you're competitive from a pricing perspective with the ability to earn on top of it, which is, you know, depending on where the token price is and everything else you can pay that back over, you know, you're not giving us an example, but over some indefinite period of time, depending on where you drive, where the price is, etc.
00:24:41.119 - 00:24:42.759, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:24:42.887 - 00:25:21.089, Speaker A: And you know what's interesting, this is more philosophical, but one of the good things about DePin I always love is that which does not exist in other companies is early users benefit from the growth of the network. Right. If you were a hive mapper person in hivemapper, you know, mapper in, you know, day first year, you probably earned a decent number of tokens. And if you hold those and the network grows, you should do very well just by that appreciation, which is terrific. But you know, we've seen every element of crypto get institutionalized over time. Bitcoin mining being the most obvious example of that. Seeing bitcoin mining becoming professional.
00:25:21.089 - 00:25:47.385, Speaker A: People used to do it out of their homes and now it's professional, you know, rigs and public companies. And so the question for you is, do you see this happening with hivemapper as well, where you mentioned fleets where instead of individual Uber drivers doing it or individual truckers doing it. You're going to have Uber buy and supply or trucking companies buy and supply to earn or there'll be some combination of a driver, company, incentive mix.
00:25:48.485 - 00:26:14.844, Speaker B: Yeah, look commercial. You're exactly right. Commercial fleets is kind of the professionalization. We saw this was Bitcoin. We saw this Ethereum fluent. It definitely feels like you guys are going directly there, focused on the professional institutions, data centers that are really going to support the network. There's 1.2
00:26:14.844 - 00:26:29.111, Speaker B: billion vehicles on the road. Of those, roughly 200 million are commercial vehicles of some form or fashion. Right. Everything from garbage trucks to delivery vans and etc. That's, that's a lot. 200 million. Right.
00:26:29.111 - 00:27:09.579, Speaker B: In those 200 million or some subset of those, I think really will become the workhorse of the Hive Mapper mapping network. You know, that won't, that won't happen tomorrow. That probably won't even happen six or nine months from now. But that will happen over the next two or three years where it will effectively flip. Today, maybe 25, 30% of drivers are associated to a fleet and are like commercial drivers or what you would consider commercial drivers. I think in the next 18 to 24 months that will flip. So 70% will be part of a commercial fleet and then you'll have, sure.
00:27:09.579 - 00:27:35.875, Speaker B: Your individual driver who's kind of, you know, a fan and you know, kind of doing it on unaffiliated to a commercial entity. And those folks are great as well. Right. They bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the project. You know, they're, they're always willing to try new capabilities and new technologies and new features well before some of the commercial fleets. And so there, I think they're a really vital and important part of the community as well.
00:27:37.765 - 00:27:51.893, Speaker A: What is your scale level in terms of drivers that you think you need to be very competitive with Google and that maybe that's global, maybe it's by market. You could probably look at that a bunch of different ways.
00:27:52.029 - 00:28:18.275, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way we look at it is in terms of the layers of the map. And so if you go to something like a traffic layer of the map, you're talking about a million plus vehicles. And of those vehicles, like you need a certain number in every region that are active every single hour of the day. Right. There is traffic around certain parts of LA at 2 o'clock in the morning. Right.
00:28:18.275 - 00:28:52.555, Speaker B: Especially around construction work zones and stuff like that. So if you go to the traffic layer, which is at the very, very top. Right. Very challenging as well, that definitely requires million plus devices. If you go below that, then you're talking probably 500,000 devices that distributed well across all the key regions. So Those are the two numbers that we track. So 500,000 below everything below traffic.
00:28:52.555 - 00:28:58.699, Speaker B: But once you go traffic, then you're talking about probably 1.5 to 2 million devices that you ultimately need.
00:28:58.867 - 00:29:32.647, Speaker A: And so if you're Getting to that 500,000 devices is also interesting, then that also implies a revenue number that you think makes sense to support that. Because at some point the or a token price that's required, which would be high given the amount of rewards that will be just the distribution kind of mechanism of those rewards, that number of drivers, Right. So you must be planning and working on significant revenue to basically put that 35% into burning to make the token, to help the token scarcity go up. You would think.
00:29:32.791 - 00:30:25.539, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. So from a revenue perspective, yeah, I mean look, the map, the mapping industry is very large as a whole, right? So if you just go back to the three major markets or segments that we're focused on, right? The B2B Automotive and then consumer navigation. From consumer navigation, Google does somewhere between 15 to 20 billion dollars a year for the Google Maps product, right? So just to put that into context, the automotive will probably be the largest segment. I mean there's 1.2 billion vehicles on the road. The vast, vast majority of those will have some level of autonomy and we are an absolutely critical ingredient into those capabilities because all of those vehicles will need some level of map to be able to navigate themselves. And customers are willing to pay for those self driving features, right? So it's a recurring revenue stream as well for the automotive company.
00:30:25.539 - 00:31:13.223, Speaker B: And so we'll get a chunk of that revenue and then the B2B, that's probably the most mature out of all three that we're focused on right now. But that's a million businesses, right? So I mean, look, go. There's a company that I can't name unfortunately, but they spend, just put in the context, they spend 30 to 35 million dollars a year on Google Maps APIs, right? For companies like Uber and Lyft, Google Maps got so expensive for them that they fundamentally have to go build their own mapping products and mapping tools and so forth. Right. At a significant cost as well. So these markets are quite large, but you do need the level of scale and data quality and data freshness to be able to attract those larger customers. So that's one part of it.
00:31:13.223 - 00:31:44.751, Speaker B: On the revenue side the other thing I think is kind of going back to the commercial vehicle fleets. A lot of commercial vehicle companies, they actually don't care about the token, right. When they're looking for the dash cam and the beast specifically is they want it from a safety and reliability perspective. Right. There's a one customer that we're working with right now who has a commercial fleet of 300 vehicles. And the owner said to me, the biggest risk to my company is a driver getting killed driving. And so they're willing to spend.
00:31:44.751 - 00:32:14.075, Speaker B: Right. If you have a great tool in the form of these dash cam devices to help keep their driver safe, that is something they're willing to spend on. Right? And they don't really care about the token. Like, I literally have people come to me and be like, you guys can keep the token. I don't care. I don't know exactly how we would do that, but if we do that at all. But, you know, I think it's interesting in terms of the mindset of these commercial vehicles is like, you're providing me something with useful at a very cost effective price.
00:32:14.075 - 00:32:19.115, Speaker B: The token, like adding a token to my balance sheet is kind of like not interesting.
00:32:19.815 - 00:32:47.233, Speaker A: That's where you can find people in the ecosystem. They would say, listen, we'll supply those 300 cameras at a pick at 20% discount in return for getting the token rewards. And you could have like a hivemapper community, you know, you know, fleet company or whatever it is that raises a little bit of money to provide some discounts, some benefits to the customer, but then gets to. Gets to mint the tokens at a. What is a very economic price, effectively?
00:32:47.409 - 00:33:48.447, Speaker B: Yeah, no, 100%. Like, I think we're looking at some of those different, those, those different types of approaches and stuff like that. So I think you got to like, you know, getting back to your core, your core question, which I think is really insightful question, is like, how do you balance, you know, revenue and then ultimately, you know, kind of demand flowing back into the mapping network in our case, and then ultimately the honey token? I think those are challenging. That's challenging to pull off, quite frankly. The thing that I worry more the most about in terms of this concept or this question is does the crypto community and culture have the patience to build out networks that take many, many, many years for the value to compound? Right. Like, if you look at hivemapper, you know, there's two and a half billion people that use Google Maps every week, right? Every month, roughly. That's a lot of people right there's.
00:33:48.447 - 00:34:17.395, Speaker B: A lot of businesses that rely on Google Maps. How long will it take us to get to something that's competitive with that? That's not going to happen next year. That's not going to happen two years from now. It probably won't even happen three years from now. Right. The point here is that these networks take time to develop and mature, but all the value compounds in year 8, 9, 10, 12, 14. And whether or not the crypto community has that kind of long time horizon and patience, that's unclear to me.
00:34:17.815 - 00:35:02.001, Speaker A: Well, what's interesting. So I think the answer is the crypto community does, but for projects they really buy into. And so think about Ethereum, right? Ethereum, what's its revenue? Right? Like Ethereum is fully on a terminal value of that being a network, valuable for a whole number of reasons. And it is valuable, but it's not valuable because of the revenue it's generating. Right? That is clearly not the case. And so I think that is even you go back, you can go back to, you know, five years ago, and Ethereum's value was way in excess of any economic activity on that network. And it was purely because people believed that it was going to be important, there would be economic activity.
00:35:02.001 - 00:35:32.403, Speaker A: It's obviously grown and there's a terrific amount of it now, but I'm not sure it justifies where the price is. So I think it's just about people buying into it all. And that is for all of us in Deepen, that's a storytelling element. And our challenge is that we're constrained by the physical world, which is very un crypto in a way, where people are thinking of infinite scale of things that can go up dramatically, aren't bound by the physical laws of drivers and physical things.
00:35:32.539 - 00:36:15.817, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I remember I took in 2049. Somebody like an investor came up to me and, you know, was I sharing with him, whatever. And I don't think I've ever told this story on a podcast, but this would be the first time. So, yeah, I explained to him, like, what hivemapper is kind of like explaining to you today, Tom? And he's like, oh, okay. And I saw like, you know, his excitement, you know, kind of go down and I was like, you know, like, what's not interesting? Clearly, like, this is not interesting to you. And he's like, oh, you're tied to something very real. You're tied to a real market.
00:36:15.817 - 00:36:31.757, Speaker B: If it wasn't tied to a real market, it could be anything, right? And if it could be anything in anybody's mind, then it could just be worth infinite, you know, and there's a little bit of that that goes on sometimes, which I think is funny.
00:36:31.901 - 00:37:02.007, Speaker A: Well, there is, it goes back to Silicon Valley where it's like, no, no revenue, no revenue. We don't want revenue. No revenue. So I, I, I definitely grasp it. That is, that is the challenge we all have in the sector, which is certainly there. But, but the point I think you're making is that this sector is vast and the revenue that's possible for you to get is enormous. And that you're talking about if you manage to get to scale and you said, you know, 500,000 cars, I think you get real contracts at far less than that.
00:37:02.007 - 00:37:32.529, Speaker A: And you get a couple of these fleets on you scale pretty quickly. And then you're, you're talking about revenue in excess of your market cap right now. Right? Like that is, that's, that's sort of the bull case vision, right? You're selling to fleets, you get a couple big fleets on it, you up the car level triples, quadruples in a year. And now you have great data and maybe you're selling local data in the markets you're number one in for a little while. Not the global. Right. But that, I'm sure there's contracts for that.
00:37:32.529 - 00:37:47.853, Speaker A: And then that to me is, then becomes just a proof point of how big this thing can be, which sounds like it can be billions of dollars in revenue, which is dramatic impact on those on that token and on the reward and on, on, on the whole project.
00:37:48.029 - 00:38:00.437, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I mean for sure. Yeah, there's, there's definitely billions of revenue here. That, that, that's without a doubt. I, I think that, I mean I would go far as saying is that without deepen. Right. Without projects like Fluence. Right.
00:38:00.437 - 00:38:45.661, Speaker B: Without projects like Helium, that is going after the wireless market hive mapper, that's going after navigation and mapping and so forth, that there is crypto will not be a very big thing. Right. Look, the crypto markets today is like what, roughly 3 trillion, which is effectively the size of one public company called Nvidia. Right. So in order for us to break out of kind of where we're at today, which is primarily driven on speculation and meme coins and you know, a little bit of NFTs as well. Then we have to go after real markets and really large markets like that, you guys are going after that Helium is going after, we're going after. Because if you don't go after those markets, then where's that revenue going to come from.
00:38:45.661 - 00:38:59.585, Speaker B: It has to come from actual real things that billions of people all over the world use every single day. Deepit has to be successful in order for crypto to be successful.
00:39:00.435 - 00:39:30.429, Speaker A: I hadn't thought about it from that perspective. That is a terrific one. I say that bitcoin can be successful by itself. And so I put bitcoin in a slightly different category because I think that's different. And I also think that Defi potentially can be successful on its own. But I take your point on everything else. I'd phrase it also the way that I view DePin as the next generation, next sort of wave of users comes from crypto users.
00:39:30.429 - 00:39:42.365, Speaker A: Crypto familiar crypto, you know, you know, converts come from deep end projects like, you know, your drivers, like everybody else, which I think is, which is terrific. Is there?
00:39:42.445 - 00:40:30.915, Speaker B: And so yeah, just really quickly at that point is like, is, you know, you know, the, the larger customers that we deal with, great customers who are spending over a hundred thousand dollars a year, I mean they obviously know like that there's like a crypto, crypto incentive model, etc. But there's a lot of customers that you know, are basically self service customers, right? Commercial real estate agents, real estate agents, etc. That come in and use our products today. I don't think the vast majority of them know that there's like a crypto incentive, right, that we're based upon blockchain and crypto, you know, mechanics and stuff like that. And they don't care and they don't need to care. And so I think like we're already starting to see that. And really for us and for folks like you is like, how do you, you know, we got to obviously like increase that by orders of magnitude for it to be like really impactful for the crypto community as a whole.
00:40:31.215 - 00:41:04.995, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead, Super Z. Well, listen, we've seen, you know, I guess we've seen helium, but you know, Render is probably the project that's captured the most attention, but that's also has this virtual feel to it, even though there's still physical GPUs doing stuff. So it's not quite as tactile as helium and as obviously Hivemapper and others. So I think we've got to see one of these projects really get up there. I think we will. It's inevitable. It's just a question of timing.
00:41:04.995 - 00:41:32.745, Speaker A: And listen, there's also, besides you and me, there's a lot of smart investors who've made big bets on this. So a lot of people Think it will happen for founders and for other people on this. Any lessons learned along your journey? Anything, I mean, is hardware is hard like any, any other, anything else. Like, you know, you can, you can caution people against or steer people towards that are either looking at Deepin or founding and running businesses, period.
00:41:34.325 - 00:42:02.729, Speaker B: Yeah. So the challenge with giving kind of generic advice and deep in category is that the markets that people are going after are so fundamentally different. Right. Like, you know, the token incentive structures and kind of how you think about your product and your market and you know, everything your go to market as well is going to is fundamentally different than mine because we're in very, very different categories. Right. And likewise for Helium. Right.
00:42:02.729 - 00:42:59.305, Speaker B: Like a lot of their incentive mechanisms and structures, et cetera, are very different. And so I think you have to be, you know, look at your specific product, your specific market, obviously look around, right, for ideas and look and see what worked and understand why it worked or why it didn't work. And you know, maybe it worked in some other category or sorry, some other deep end project, but the reason it worked had to do with very specific issues and nuances in that market. Right. And those are not immediately transferable to you. And so, you know, a lot of people, for example, came in expecting that when you drove 1km in HiveMapper that you would earn X amount of tokens regardless of where you are in the world. And then as people started to get their dash cams and people started to drive, they realized that was no longer the case.
00:42:59.305 - 00:43:35.507, Speaker B: And the amount of hate that I got, or I should say the team got for that was way beyond kind of like what I ever expected. And you know, I still stand by it was the right decision. But people's, you know, expectations had been set by some other projects that I in my view didn't make sense for hivemapper. But they were kind of bringing those expectations over to hivemapper. And so there was a long education process that we had to really take in order to explain to people why that doesn't make sense. I mean, fundamentally, if it was, you know, one. I'm just making this number up.
00:43:35.507 - 00:44:23.421, Speaker B: If it was one honey token per kilometer driven, no matter where you drive, no matter like whether that has already been mapped or anything like that. Well, what would people do is they would just drive in circles, right? And then they're like. Or just deployed on a school bus or something like that does this the exact same route every single day. And like, that doesn't help us build a good fresh global map with high Coverage, you know, all that kind of stuff. I mean, the thing that I think is important is like, you're going to have to build through cycles and be mentally prepared, be financially prepared to build through cycles. In the crypto, right. Any deep end project is going to take minimum 4, 5, 6 years to really get to some interesting levels of scale.
00:44:23.421 - 00:44:55.775, Speaker B: And you're going to have these ups and downs and like, you're not. You can't control them, they just freaking happen. There's like, the highs are really, really high and the lows are really, really low. You know, in the lows, people are going to think you're, you're a biggest douchebag, you're all corrupt, you're all criminal. And then in the highs, they're going to think you're, you know, you're the best thing since sliced bread. And I think it's really important just mentally to like have this even keeled approach. Easier said than done, but I think that's the most critical thing.
00:44:56.435 - 00:45:56.939, Speaker A: Listen, I think that, you know, sort of the strength and challenge of crypto is the community, where the community is what funds the token. Economics makes it work. And that is, without that, we wouldn't be around, it wouldn't be possible for these projects to get off the ground. The price you pay for that, though, is often extreme skepticism and thin slicing of information to a incredible degree that leads to misinformation, amplification to such a level that. I've seen this at Hedera, no doubt I've seen it sort of like once you know what's going on and then you see this stuff out there that's written, you're just like, how does some of this stuff happen? But without that, you also wouldn't have the economics that allow the bootstrapping the network. Right. So it's incumbent on us to both be prepared for it, as you mentioned it, but also to try to weather the storm on those things.
00:45:57.107 - 00:46:39.135, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Like, you know, the best thing could happen to Hivemapper. And like, you know, thankfully there's been a whole bunch of like, really good milestones that we've hit and customers and stuff like that. What I've seen people do is they'll take good news and they will, you know, very quickly wrap it into some sort of conspiracy narrative. And you look at it, you're like, wait, what? Or they'll take a bad piece of information and they'll wrap it into like a positive, you know, conspiracy, and it's just like, it's just all over the place. Right. Like, in terms of some of these conspiracy theories that get, you know, some of them get, you know, actually pick up steam, and you look at it and you're like, what is this? This is like the most idiotic, dumb thing.
00:46:39.135 - 00:46:58.615, Speaker B: And it could also burn a lot of your time as well. Right. And so I think you got to be smart in terms of, like, what do you engage in and what don't you engage in? Because if you sit there engaging in some of this stuff endlessly, like, you're not focused on product, you're not focused on customers. You know, there's a lot of other things that, like, you ought to be doing rather than sitting there, like, corresponding.
00:46:58.995 - 00:47:33.745, Speaker A: I know, and that's always a challenge, is like, listen, if you know the truth and the evidence will be visible in X amount of time, and the question is, are you going to fight the narrative until the proof is there, or you're just going to wait for that, endure the pain until the proof is there? And that's always, like, the debate, like, oh, they did it for this reason. Well, actually not, but I can't say. But you're going to see that in a month the evidence will be out. You'll see it's a different reason. But, like, am I going to fight that narrative for that month or let it take over and the evidence come out at that period of time? Is always a debate that I've. I've certainly had.
00:47:34.165 - 00:48:46.319, Speaker B: You know, what's funny is, like, there's. You mentioned this point before in terms of if somebody had bought a dash cam early on and just put it into the car and never thought about it, never, like, went and drove specifically to map, just only used it the way it's supposed to be used, which is like, use it on your existing journeys that you're already taking and never engage in discord, never check Twitter, anything like that. You know, you would have probably done far, far better than somebody who bought the dash cam and was trying to optimize everything and was in discord yelling about X, Y or Z or on Twitter, like, you know, spreading conspiracy theories, all that kind of stuff. Because the second category, many of those people probably got, like, super emotional about something and, like, either stop mapping or did some other stupid thing and, you know, probably lost out on a tremendous amount of rewards versus the other person. Like, they didn't really engage in all the emotions and all the ups and downs and the conspiracy theories, and they're like, this is kind of cool. You know, help build a map. And, you know, I I need a dash cam anyways and like great.
00:48:46.319 - 00:48:57.565, Speaker B: You know, it is what it is. And that pro, that person probably is like mentally a lot better off and be like, you know, from a reward perspective, you know, far better off as well.
00:48:58.065 - 00:49:20.009, Speaker A: Yes, but were they buying the token and that the problem is that number two guy might have been buying the token at some point. And so that, that is that, that's that challenge. I think that that's, that's, that's, that's the, that's the crux of this, of this issue. But it is, it's something for all founders. I think it's a great thing for people to be aware of. No, no doubt. Sort of.
00:49:20.009 - 00:49:32.385, Speaker A: I totally get that other, other projects in the space that you want to call people's attention to you think are doing something and really interesting and moving deep in and everything forward.
00:49:33.525 - 00:50:03.845, Speaker B: Well, I'll call it two. You know, one obviously is some is a project everyone knows about, which is Helium. But I will call specific attention to mobile. Right. What they're doing with mobile in terms of, you know, people should watch carefully like what they're doing in terms of the rollout of the mobile network coverage, which I think has been incredibly thoughtful, incredibly strategic. And look, they have like real customers using the wireless network today, which is awesome. Like that is, you know, like there's a lot of other projects out there that have maybe, you know, more.
00:50:06.505 - 00:50:06.793, Speaker A: You.
00:50:06.809 - 00:50:46.655, Speaker B: Know, from a story perspective sound better because they're focused on some sort of AI thing or whatever. But like in terms of just like execution, the Helium mobile team, what they've done is phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. Another project I'm really excited about is a project in the decentralized energy space called Daylight, run by this guy called Jason Babao who is just, he comes from the energy world, very thoughtful, really strong entrepreneur. And I've been working with that team a little bit over the last couple months and I think what they're doing is pretty impressive.
00:50:47.525 - 00:51:15.469, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, I'd love, love to learn more about them. You know, it reminds me by the way, there's a decentralized solar group called GLOW run by David Vor, I think is super interesting as well. And what he has is in common with you. Most depend projects have the supply taken care of and it's the demand that's a challenge. And you guys, what's also interesting, we didn't talk about this at all, but sort of obvious point to make to you take it for granted but you're taking care of the demand side. Like you're sure the demand side is there.
00:51:15.469 - 00:51:48.603, Speaker A: You just have to get to whatever scale is required and you're already talking to customers on the demand side. And that is pretty interesting because a ton of Deepin projects have found lots of storage, lots of compute, lots of whatever it is. And they struggle to fill that supply with demand and is decentralized and you guys are able to literally pick up and target that demand. And to me, that is a enormous advantage in achieving success and. Right. That's a huge benefit.
00:51:48.739 - 00:52:24.071, Speaker B: Yeah. So in the last probably two to three months, we've become, you know. Yeah. More so supply constrained than demand constraint. Like some, you know, fairly large customers that we've been working with for, you know, extended period of times in different phases of evaluation, data evaluation, privacy evaluation, technical evaluation, etc, have started to land and you know. Yeah, now definitely like the, the challenge for us will be a little bit more on the supply side moving forward, which is.
00:52:24.103 - 00:52:42.585, Speaker A: Yeah, that's totally unique. Totally unique and deep in projects. And by the way, it's something I'm convinced you can solve with a couple big fleet sales. I'm, I'm, I'm convinced. If you need, if you need some, some the side, the side, you know, hive mapper fleet, you know, llc, we, we should talk.
00:52:43.885 - 00:53:04.225, Speaker B: We need them in your neck of the woods, right? In like any of the secondary cities in Europe, you know, like a Marseille or Lyon, stuff like that. You know, the Paris and the, the Amsterdams and Londons were, we're thankfully really good with. But it's those secondary and tertiary cities, especially across most of southern Europe, that we need a lot of help with.
00:53:04.615 - 00:53:28.791, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, see what I can come up with. Second last question. A lot of us are still, we're still somewhat tied to Bitcoin, obviously. Do you have a view on bitcoin where it is by the end of the year, given that sort of helped kick off this whole ecosystem, I can't help but pay attention to it, obviously. And so I just always got to ask where people think bitcoin is by the end of the year.
00:53:28.983 - 00:53:59.077, Speaker B: I have no idea, to be honest with you. I don't track it. I mean, obviously I don't track it that carefully enough where I could have a point of view on it. I will say this, which is the US government. As long as the US government spends a lot of money, Bitcoin will continue to go up. Right. I think the moment the US government stops spending a tremendous amount of money way beyond their means, then bitcoin will be in a far more challenging spot from a pricing perspective.
00:53:59.077 - 00:54:09.805, Speaker B: But both parties, Republicans and Democrats, seem very intent on just spending ridiculous sums of money. And so bitcoin will do very well.
00:54:10.385 - 00:54:25.097, Speaker A: Fair enough. Listen, I agree with that, without a doubt. So, yeah, I think we're going up. Tell us how to follow Hivemapper, how to participate, how to buy a dash cam, how do people get involved?
00:54:25.281 - 00:54:44.135, Speaker B: Yeah. So go to hivemapper.com that is definitely where you can get a dash cam, where you can understand the project, read the docs, all that kind of stuff. Or follow us on Twitter. We're on Twitter, hivemapper, where we're pretty active. I'm pretty active on Twitter as well. So I'm just a sideman on Twitter.
00:54:44.135 - 00:54:51.935, Speaker B: Yeah. And ask us questions. I'm always there responding to questions, especially if they're good, thoughtful questions. I'm happy to respond to them on Twitter.
00:54:52.595 - 00:55:17.987, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you. And everyone should know that Ariel was at our Deepin Day in Austin. So terrific to have him on Deepin'as well. You know, on my side, people should be aware. We've got a Deepin Day coming up in Brussels on July 10th. Hope people can join and follow us here on fluenceproject or fluence.network
00:55:17.987 - 00:55:33.381, Speaker A: or any of the Deepin Day on Twitter. But thank you, Ariel, for joining and appreciate it and look forward to having you back on and see the progress that you're able to execute over the next, you know, coming months. But, but thanks for being on.
