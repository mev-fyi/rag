00:00:00.320 - 00:00:39.674, Speaker A: This isn't a topic we could have discussed five years time, but there's been so much work and effort and development and intellectual capacity that's one inch in the space. But here we are today talking about layer threes and app chains and much more specialized things beyond just the layer one and the bitcoin and the smart contract platforms that we started years ago. I think this also signed that. The product market fit is there. I have a great set of guests today to actually discuss about where we're heading with this technology, where we are, what are the challenges. So maybe before we dive in, maybe you guys can give a very brief intro to who you are and what we're building to.
00:00:41.654 - 00:01:08.594, Speaker B: Sure. Thank you. My name is Alice Blkowski. I'm co founder of Matterlabs, the company behind Ziki Sync. We're building the. We just launched the first ZkVM on Ethereum Mainnet. It's going to be released gradually to the users and as the next step is going to be launching layer three s, which believe is the end game for blockchain scalability.
00:01:13.854 - 00:01:24.834, Speaker C: My name is Alex Rozhenko. Hopefully not forget me. I'm the CEO of Aurora Labs, the company that is building Aurora.
00:01:30.334 - 00:01:56.674, Speaker D: Chain safe. Chain safe is building a lot of alternative plans. For instance, internally, two clients, consensus clients. For typescript we're building also Polkadot implementation. Ludo will build rust implementation of Filecoin. We used to work on Mina as well. Chain agnostic with import.
00:01:59.854 - 00:02:11.834, Speaker E: Hi, my name is Ahmed Kumar. I come from all fair and we are building a decentralized open execution hub that allows people to recruit different types of engines and environments that they need.
00:02:13.254 - 00:02:37.614, Speaker F: Hello everyone, I'm Evgeni, co founder, influence first. We are working on decentralized computing platform, which basically like the off chain infrastructure for developers that the goal is to replace the proprietary clouds, which is more kind of on the application level discussion when we talk about off chains and roll ups and stuff like that.
00:02:37.694 - 00:02:40.074, Speaker B: So you basically think of these infrastructures.
00:02:40.534 - 00:02:51.274, Speaker F: Where we boost our economics, actually put all the names economics and stuff like that. It's not the computation we're talking about is happening.
00:02:54.214 - 00:03:10.434, Speaker A: Some of our audience might not be familiar with terms like app chain and layer three. So I thought maybe one of you guys might try and explain in very simple terms what do we actually mean? So we can actually select the baseline of knowledge. Who would like to have a go at that?
00:03:12.454 - 00:03:48.614, Speaker E: I can start with a quick, which I feel is a semantic or recursive definition of l three. L three essentially is two l two. What l two is to add one. So that's one way of recursively defining what l three is. But having said that, a pure definition is still not quite established here. Sensitive? Well, app chains are basically anything that is designed layer which otherwise depend on other central hubs, but basically a chain that is designed for a certain application.
00:03:51.034 - 00:04:18.674, Speaker B: I would like to add to this that in order to qualify as layer two or layer three, the most important condition is that these chains are deriving their security properties from the underlying systems. Ethereum and all the way up from Ethereum, a security propagates and all the validators, Ethereum basically verify or test the security of all the high levels.
00:04:20.574 - 00:04:31.714, Speaker A: And what does this landscape look like right now? Where are we with ZK technology and where are we at with App gene technology? And how early in the adoption cycle are we?
00:04:32.054 - 00:05:06.654, Speaker B: To the best of my knowledge, we don't have any legal layer three sector can start that. Maybe, probably not. But we have some application specific chains that are independent sovereign chains where they do not derive security from underlying systems, and that puts them in a very different landscape and very different position. You can totally use them for some scenarios, but it's not what I would consider part of the Internet of some blockchain.
00:05:09.994 - 00:05:12.134, Speaker A: Anyone else want to add anything to that?
00:05:12.914 - 00:06:51.194, Speaker C: I would like to add an additional kind of perspective on the security aspect. So if we have a very interesting situation in the market of validators at the moment. So for all of the chains, we need to get validators and the market of professional validators occurs, and means that these Eurovision companies that are doing the professional validation, they actually validate multiple different locations. Ever stake is validated near Solana, Bolivia, whatever, they have tons of this stuff. Similar situation isn't possible space, same values are validated different. So when we're talking about security, I just wanted to mention that there is this interesting particular thing about this stake networks, this interesting thing that in case, in case we're thinking of catastrophic events, when these validators are trying to submit incorrect blocks, then this actually destroys their reputation, not only on the single chain, but on all of these chains, right? So it means that the security of the chains are somewhat interconnected actually, and shared already because of the social thing and because of the social limitation. So it just means that for the new chains that are going to emerge, their security action is going to be higher than we might think of, just the bare numbers.
00:06:51.194 - 00:07:03.174, Speaker C: So the inheritance of security is super important. Yes, I will discuss that. I just wanted to point out that interesting non technical thing.
00:07:21.354 - 00:07:48.658, Speaker D: But I feel this is something that is actually exactly, actually almost five years ago now, it was bringing troubles to the Ethereum blockchain because he was basically feeling the rocks and that was building cryptokitties thought, okay, you know what, we can't find ethereum.
00:07:48.706 - 00:07:49.814, Speaker C: So we want to build.
00:07:51.784 - 00:08:51.854, Speaker D: And this blockchain will be actually dedicated to games and it will have primitives that allows people to build games on top of blockchain, make it faster. And this is truly a damaging, because blockchain that has very specific assets to maximize the effectiveness of some specific applications. And right now, in the past months and maybe years, we've been talking about blockchain more related to what alice means regarding kind of shared security, or at least in the cosmos or Polkadot ecosystem, the idea that you can interact between blockchains that are shards of the same protocol or the same ecosystem, and thanks to IPC or allowing builds blockchain to interact really seamlessly. And yeah, that's what we would say.
00:08:53.474 - 00:09:47.154, Speaker E: I wanted to add one more point to design. I think you have to consider the alternative, which is as a pro, you have appchain, you can consider it app engines, roll ups. Beyond that you have this general purpose layer ones or layer twos, like Ethereum for example. And apart from scalability mentioned earlier, there is this idea that for certain types of use, case or applications, you may want to customize your chain for your needs, right? For example, you may not like, for whatever reasons, the underlying gas metering system that another 1 may provide you. So you may want to have your own mechanism to meter the gas, you may want to adjust your, let's say block gas a bit or whatever they want to design your customizer chain that fits or suits your needs. And for example, games, probably one of the biggest users of app chains or apps.
00:09:49.814 - 00:10:50.280, Speaker F: Just a small point to add to everything with. So basically as a I'm looking at all this infrastructure from the application developer perspective. And like in our case, we're trying to build the system where potentially millions and millions of developers going to use our product the same as using cloud. And usually when they build, they pay for renting some compute capacity from the cloud. It could be very small checks, could be higher checks, but definitely they don't want to think about transaction fees and network congestions and stuff like that. That's why basically as a typical application that may have millions of visitors in the future, we have this choice between, okay, should we build on the up change or should we build on some roll up that potentially allow us to scale with these. But the important difference here is in case of building upcheed, it's kind of like different assumptions and trade offs in terms of blockchains.
00:10:50.280 - 00:11:52.824, Speaker F: We'll have to deal with these network polymers which might or might not be concerned for some people. Because like sometimes this to kind of centralization of power sometimes leads to additional efforts in terms of like when you starting your new network, you just want to work on your application, but you need to start a network, you need to talk to all these validators, you need to like do all of these efforts. And from like on the other perspective, there is potentially roll ups that allow you to just like, you know, deploy the code and it's magically worse because it's just not there yet. In the desirable future, it's all going to just magically work. But right now it's just like we have to do all these triggers. We have to combine several approaches at the moment if we want to run a product today and not in one.
00:11:54.284 - 00:12:15.744, Speaker A: So if we had to predict in ten years time how adoption has progressed, would you guys say like ZK will probably dominate and appchain will have a more niche? Or are you saying maybe there might be gaming applications that are so huge and built on these specialized app chains that it's just too hard to predict? Or how do you guys think will play out in the future?
00:12:16.224 - 00:12:25.752, Speaker C: So from my point of view, the key technology is absolutely a marvelous piece. It needs to mature in five years.
00:12:25.808 - 00:12:27.832, Speaker E: The K is going to be the.
00:12:27.848 - 00:12:48.644, Speaker C: Dominant technology for building any chains. But from the other standpoint, if we take a look at coin market cap the first 30 coins there, there are two types of the coins there. One is a stable coin and the second one is a separate layer, one.
00:12:49.424 - 00:12:51.564, Speaker D: That is used for the transaction.
00:12:52.104 - 00:13:23.734, Speaker C: So I do believe that the future, the development of CK technologies is not actually excluding the need of many different chains. People are going to continue to do it just because of the fact that investors are thinking that in case they are investing in the infrastructure layer, right, then this state is expected. This is a status quo at the moment that is going to continue on.
00:13:24.394 - 00:14:18.714, Speaker E: I wanted to sort of add that app chain may not be for everyone, you may not have the transaction needs, the number of volume that you're driving through. Your application will not require a delicate block space just for yourself. There could be, for example, something in the middle sector, specific, vertical specific networks where you have something like here is a game change, here is a defi chain. And it could be possible where some of these games might center around one center specific change. It could also be possible where most applications will start on or start off once they feel like they have gotten enough user base, they have enough Dius, then they want to have their own dedicated block speeds that would come from an applications machine.
00:14:21.454 - 00:15:24.166, Speaker B: I'd like to add that just like in the beginning of being in the early days of Internet, there were this different path that people, or so it can go, whether like one global Internet will emerge or there will be separate intranets. All those intranets could use different technologies. Not of all of them were it based, et cetera, et cetera. And what we see as an evolution crystallized. What really worked was everyone built the simple, most efficient kind of technology and what was built on top of the axis. And then you still have something like private networks, Internets, but they are just like firewalled versions of the Internet that still use the same. And I think, I think technologically that is what's all the chains that have value for whatever reasons, technological reasons, or maybe for non technological reasons.
00:15:24.166 - 00:15:50.530, Speaker B: Maybe there are communities built on those, and those communities are powerful and they create value because of this, values, etcetera. But in order to survive, they will have to adopt the most efficient, the most secure technology that protects you, that maintains the various. I believe from what I know today.
00:15:50.682 - 00:16:41.124, Speaker D: Is definitely going to be safe. I'm not 100% agreeing with this in the sense that sometimes history has shown that it's not because you have the best tech or the most efficient, that this is actually what gets used. And this is something I would like, actually, as a developer. Obviously that technology would win and drive adoption. But very often we've seen in the past that not the most decentralized or not the most efficient chain actually get the most traction. Maybe because they have the best duets, or maybe because they have, in a world doing some trade offs that users don't eventually see and still go for this chain. I'm not going to be names, but I hope that in ten years from now.
00:16:41.124 - 00:17:31.476, Speaker D: So just to go back to the question, ten years is a long time, right? One three is 100 years, probably. And I believe that, as Algen, sorry mentioned before, there were pictures, bridges, absolutely everywhere. I really hope that those breaches will allow at least the biggest hacks yet to happen. I do believe that, as I said before, some chain or some application will start first, as you know, on general purpose blockchains. And eventually this is probably something we will talk about. But yeah, building on app chain is not something, or building your own blockchain is not something that's easy. And it takes actually a long time.
00:17:31.476 - 00:18:26.812, Speaker D: And this is, yeah, this is a game afraid of that, that people will need to take. I do believe that we have a lot of simple upchain right now that will die. There's a concept that I really like, which is called block space. And the concept of block spaces, thinking about a block should be food all the time. If it was possible to have all these say, applications or the smart contracts, sending events, etcetera, in the most efficient manner, so that every block is full, every block on every blockchain is full all the time. And you have many blockchain that aren't used too much today. And still everyone is paying for validation and the users are effectively paying for this.
00:18:26.812 - 00:18:45.324, Speaker D: All blocks are not full and not used at all. So I hope that we just make this more effective in the future. And whatever protocol is used in vendors, at least it's efficient that we don't have like hundreds of blockchain actually running and with blocks that are harmful.
00:18:47.184 - 00:18:47.656, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:47.720 - 00:19:37.334, Speaker F: So I definitely don't know where the future gonna be. But I think one important thing to think about is that users tend to stick with the wallet. The wallet is the enabler to different chains and features and applications that users use. And if we say that the future is multi chain, there's going to be a lot of chains and they all going to be kind of force users to use different buckets. Basically we built on different technologies. It means we will keep having all these interoperability problems that we have today. And from this perspective, today it's possible to build the multi chain application.
00:19:40.274 - 00:19:40.610, Speaker D: Which.
00:19:40.642 - 00:20:33.884, Speaker F: Will not force user to install two wallets and use only metamask. And I can build at the same time on ethereum layer one and on near via Aurora, for example. Or I have the alternative way, I can use ethereum I want and then I can use CK sync and the user will still use the same wallet. But I think that if we think that we will force and we will be able to incentivize users to use server wallets at the same time, it's just like not going to happen. We either need to figure out how to extract out chains under the root of the wallets or we will be updated by EVM or maybe something coming after EVM. But like the majority of users going to be, because of network effects, going to be kept on single volume charge.
00:20:34.904 - 00:21:02.334, Speaker A: So hypothetically, if adoption isn't where we want it to be in five years time, in either ZK or layer three or app change, why do four, you think that might have happened? Or maybe another way to phrase the question is like, what are the risks to adoption? Like, can you talk? You touched on Alex, on some of these risks, but what are some of the barriers that we're going to face before we can have adoption into the billions of users?
00:21:05.554 - 00:21:57.730, Speaker B: I think those are the usual. The challenges that are not specific to their app chains, but in general to blockchains. We need to solve security, we need to solve trust, we need to solve regulatory Internet. Citizens find ways to integrate it in existing systems. But all of this is happening, but with specific to CK technology. I think creating trust through demonstrating security and reliability of the systems is crucial, is what we should be focusing on where we can fail. And if we fail, if there's a big problem in any of the chains might push us back somewhat.
00:21:57.730 - 00:22:19.794, Speaker B: It will not stop that ocean. Yeah. If you think of the early days of aviation, the early crashes of airplanes did not stop that option, but they probably definitely contributed to less willingness of people to fly. So you should be taking things slowly, surely towards the scratch feature.
00:22:21.334 - 00:22:34.954, Speaker E: I think one problem that you're facing beyond user experience is today. If you want to use any application whatsoever today, you need to go and watch a 30 minutes tutorial video on YouTube from the start of how the whole thing works.
00:22:35.614 - 00:22:36.750, Speaker D: And that's painful.
00:22:36.902 - 00:22:59.810, Speaker E: When I go and download a new app on my App Store, web, two app, I don't read anything, I just go and use it. And that's the first aspect, which is there's a lot of learning that's forced onto users. It's not even about Ui us, it's about, oh, go and learn about how consistent protocol works. Go and learn about gas. Go and learn about things like that. I think that has to go away. That has to.
00:22:59.810 - 00:23:18.174, Speaker E: That has to go behind the scenes in a way where today, you know, as many people say, go and host a website you don't care about whether exposed to somewhere else, you don't care. And certainly you don't have to be forced to go and watch your favorite influencers video to understand how your favorite uniswap or, or something else.
00:23:18.214 - 00:23:22.502, Speaker C: Also specific chains that are extremely aggressive in their marketing.
00:23:22.558 - 00:23:23.038, Speaker F: Right?
00:23:23.166 - 00:24:07.394, Speaker C: I really hate these chains. This is a really big reason why, because we already know the only ones who are talking about security and privacy. Take a look at what Apple is doing right now. They never ever have had billboards. Now on the billboards with Apple advertisements, you are able to see a person who is just holding an iPhone in front of his face and closing his face. And this is how they are conveying to their users that there is a privacy inside of iPhones. That's what they are doing.
00:24:07.394 - 00:24:57.614, Speaker C: Right? And no single chain is able to fight with ammo at the moment. And in case we would not unite as blockchain community, in case we would stop shooting on others, in case we would not be able to do a targeted laser focused strike on the web, two, they just want to use all of our ideas right away, pack it in the way that the users are okay to consume. It is not overload in their brains. And that's it. We are just going to be using material, we are going to go into it. So from my standpoint, it is super, super important for all of us to collaborate.
00:25:00.814 - 00:26:08.254, Speaker D: That's a very wise word, truly, and would like to reinforce it. I guess, unfortunately, this is a very big behavior. I can do actually better and grow my own blockchain. Yeah, this is also, I would say, probably inherent to, you know, capitalism and the fact that when you can launch your own blockchain with your own token and be richer, let's say, I guess this is a big break into more collaboration. And something that Alex said before that I really, really believe is super important is the fact that we are very much using different wallets depending on what application we will using. And this is, as someone who really likes, this is something I think is an enormous problem. We're all talking about how metamask is so strong to get better when it has evaluates.
00:26:08.254 - 00:27:09.084, Speaker D: We are all using metamask, they are all alternatives, we're not using them. So I think there is a huge inertia in this kind of behaviors. And I'm very close to many wallet developers that tell me, look, it's not because we were so much better than metamask that actually people use us because there's the first uber advantage. This tutorial you just mentioned that people are looking at for you using Uniswap, what is this tutorial talking about? Probably metamask, because they just want to focus on how to use uniswap. And so I think this will take a lot of time to unify around maybe a couple, maybe ZK rollups, a couple tab chain. And maybe this is always the thing that people asking what is a killer application? Maybe there will be one killer application that actually just brings everyone around an ecosystem and try to.
00:27:13.224 - 00:28:35.356, Speaker F: Just a small addition. So I think that one of the risks we have here is just inefficiency of all the decentralization right? Like we are trying to do like to move and to build in a way that is different from how big corporations were built. So we are trying to create decentralized ecosystem. We are trying to spread the power to like entities. And this leads to inefficiency of how fast it goes, like how fast every ecosystem innovates. And on the other side there are some projects or some chains that Alex in particular hates that operated by very centralized organizations that can perform very fast, that can apply all these, you know, experience of building companies and corporations in a kind of closed manner so they can build stuff faster compared to open end system where you have this, you know, creativity and openness and anyone can contribute because these things, open ecosystem requires a lot of trade offs on the communication. So this just sometimes it slows things down but like sometimes it just allows some untrivial innovation to be born.
00:28:35.356 - 00:28:47.756, Speaker F: So we are playing the field that's different than the field that was like 20 years ago when all this like Google, Facebook and stuff were built. I just want to add very shortly.
00:28:47.780 - 00:29:21.232, Speaker B: That I fully share the sentiment towards the chains that are using aggressive, very honest markets to advance. But I also feel very confident that at the end what will win and prevail are the values. I don't worry about those chains. They will be building some stuff fast, they will be catering to some corporations, we'll be drinking some interest into it. But if blockchain could survive in a centralized environment, if it could be valuable.
00:29:21.368 - 00:29:26.052, Speaker F: Without decentralization, without like, you know, it.
00:29:26.068 - 00:29:40.104, Speaker B: Has cost, it has issue overhead. If it was possible it would have already been done. We would not have needed bitcoin or ethereum. So those this overhand, or rather the.
00:29:40.404 - 00:29:42.316, Speaker F: Cost, the willingness to pay this cost.
00:29:42.420 - 00:30:18.304, Speaker B: Is justified by the value that decentralization, true decentralization gives you. And like either you are aligned with the values and then I'm fine. I don't care who will win eventually, like which technology, which approach. I want the mission, I want our mission to succeed. And our mission is just promoting, accelerating the adoption of blockchains for personal server. If those not so honest sectors move ahead, they will not be able to provide the scale. So I got it.
00:30:21.924 - 00:31:07.634, Speaker F: I agree with you. In general, the problem is like crypto idea, what we call crypto idea is that I own my digital value, right? It's mine, not the platform that where I created it or used or transacted it. And the problem with all the centralized chains is basically they own my, my digital items from digital value instead of me. But if I don't understand it. I like, I don't, I don't know, like if I'm uneducated, massive user. I don't, I cannot really distinguish between, like, do I own it or do they own it? Like, what they can do to me in order to, you know, cut the access for myself from this value. So.
00:31:07.634 - 00:31:30.622, Speaker F: And this is definitely like something related to like, market education and like long term collaborative work in terms of like sharing the vision of the battery. And it feels like it resonates with humanity so far. So we're doing good work, but that's still risk. I just want to say that I.
00:31:30.638 - 00:31:45.124, Speaker B: Agree, but they are going to be competing with revoluts and coinbases in this world, not with us. And those already exist and they do the same thing. Like users kind of own crypto, but not really, or identity or whatever.
00:31:46.504 - 00:32:20.104, Speaker A: So usually when we talk about the decentralized technologies, the elephant in the room is regulation, right? Laws. And I just wanted to ask, what is the impact of regulations when it comes to these technologies? Because we know DyDx just moved on to their own kind of technology. Some say it's because they want to have better control of the validation set. We know what's happening with tornado cash, so it's not like we have a free open checkbook to do exactly what we want. So what do you guys think around the question of regulation on these technologies that we're building?
00:32:20.404 - 00:32:21.044, Speaker F: I can start.
00:32:21.084 - 00:33:14.856, Speaker B: I feel very confident that we will move on this plan because infrastructure layers, we not going to be massively affected just through the same protection that Internet providers enjoy. The infrastructure providers for the Internet. And you have some advanced privacy tools on the Internet, such as SSL, HTTPs, they are necessary for functioning of Internet, for being able to access your banks, your accounts in a secure way. They cannot be regulated away. You cannot just say like everyone has multiple countries, you cannot have people or authorities from Iran be able to see every packet on the Internet, what's going on there. So it's infrastructure, I mean, Echo views here.
00:33:15.040 - 00:33:59.132, Speaker E: And if you look at the last few years of our regulations have intervened in crypto space. They have been at the platform level infrastructure only for fundraising. People with icos, they were given some sort of slap on the wrist or whatever you call it by sec. The major sort of regulatory intervention that came in was that the application layer cash value. So if you build platforms, infrastructure that are decentralized in nature, the only way anyone could come in is by attacking application in some way. But infrastructure will still be safe in many ways. But again, they will have to find a way in which you could prevent the same thing at the application as well.
00:33:59.132 - 00:34:00.764, Speaker E: I mean, if you want someone like.
00:34:00.804 - 00:34:17.524, Speaker A: Nasdaq to come and build on blockchain technology, would they want to be building on a layer three where they don't know, like maybe the validator sets in layer two below that? Or would they have to go for their own app changes just because they control the variables in there?
00:34:18.704 - 00:34:19.192, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:34:19.208 - 00:34:57.314, Speaker E: I mean, talking about DYDX, I think, of course there's one reason is regulation. But there are other economic aspects of move from ByDX to this as well. So in some cases, they would love to have their own infrastructure that they control. And in some cases, they may want to sort of report that and be complying to regulation, but there would be open, decentralized infrastructures that, as previously mentioned, people who believe in those values will build on those chains because a large network of people have come towards big quantity because of those core values.
00:34:58.614 - 00:35:35.758, Speaker C: I want to do it here that the regulation in general is something that is going to move to probably pretty slowly, but in the end, it is going to be there. I want to throw in the audience one simple fact. Women were allowed to take part in the elections in Switzerland, one of the most prominent countries in the world, only in eighties. Regulators can be really, really stoked. But there are other ways how we can boost the adoption and push regulators.
00:35:35.846 - 00:35:36.238, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:36.326 - 00:35:43.382, Speaker C: And there are already some projects that start to appear in the blockchain ecosystem that are actually solving the regulatory problem.
00:35:43.478 - 00:35:43.926, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:44.030 - 00:35:54.190, Speaker C: What is the problem there? Regulatory landscape is not, is not clear. And because of these big players are not able to come in the blockchain.
00:35:54.302 - 00:35:54.954, Speaker F: Right.
00:35:55.334 - 00:36:30.878, Speaker C: In case there is a project that is actually solving this risk or is taking this risk and providing the service to the institutions risk free, then it is okay. And just to, just to name here, there is this project called securitize. What they are doing. They are taking ERC 20s. They have minted one to one other peer secrets. They say that these are securities. They're registering these tokens with all of the authorities.
00:36:30.878 - 00:37:21.554, Speaker C: They're doing KYC on their clients and they're selling these tokens just one to one, right? Like 15, 20% higher on demand. And it works because these people are accredited investors. They do not want, want to have the regulatory risk that something is not there. They are buying this risk from this, and it works great. I want to see more projects like this that are solving the actual regulatory risks. And this would be something that is going to boost the adoption, because the money that is earned here by securitized team is the money that is not transferred back to the government. And because of this, they are going to see the competition and they would like actually to provide proper regulation.
00:37:23.494 - 00:37:56.564, Speaker A: And something else I wanted to touch on was one of the game changers that smart contract platforms and Ethereum brought was this idea of composability, where people could deploy different things and these things could interact with each other and leverage each other. And it was a, it was like there were synergies during that cliche term. And when we move on to layer three, is that broken? Are we going to have to rely on bridge technology to improve a lot? Or how do we actually keep that benefit when we're moving into these more specialized solutions?
00:38:01.224 - 00:38:05.136, Speaker E: I do believe that bridges will exist. And I think there was this meme.
00:38:05.160 - 00:38:05.932, Speaker A: On the slide earlier.
00:38:06.008 - 00:38:35.726, Speaker E: I think that's so true. But bridges will look differently compared to what you see today. So for example, today, if you look at, you have wrapped USDT on, let's say, polygon, you also have wrapped USDT native USDT on the same chain, and then you could. That creates lots of issues. So there will be better bridges that are abstracted away from end users. And you don't have to switch networks and move assets from one chain go to the other one. The better bridges that will be abstracted.
00:38:35.726 - 00:38:37.434, Speaker E: I think that's absolutely needed.
00:38:38.654 - 00:38:40.870, Speaker F: So this is a very interesting question.
00:38:40.942 - 00:39:25.440, Speaker B: And there are a few points to expand here. So first of all, inside app chains possibility will work probably exactly the same way that it works now where it wants. Any contract can talk to any other contract and dominantly, asynchronously within a simple transaction. So that is simple. The interesting question is how composability works across different app chains or web l three s. And I agree that the bridges will massively change and they're going to be brought to our next level. What I mean by this, the bridges between layer threes can be built completely trusted and completely reliable.
00:39:25.440 - 00:39:39.792, Speaker B: So you can send a message and be sure that the message will eventually reach the destination, will contain the exact value where you will get a synchronous response. So there will be composability, but it.
00:39:39.808 - 00:39:41.244, Speaker D: Will be as synchronous.
00:39:42.304 - 00:40:46.564, Speaker B: And the way the reason why it will be possible to do it basically the same way as it's now just as synchronous but having all the same properties. Is that what we call bridges today is actually not bridges. This is a very flawed metaphor, very flow term that we're using, because bridges imply that you have islands, like some pieces of land separated by some waters, whatever, and you have digital assets in them. Like you can imagine them, like you have physical assets on those islands, and you can transport them over the bridge. This is not how any of the existing bridges do they work, except the native bridges, for where those are base projects. How the bridges work is you have those islands, you have digital assets. Like imagine you have gold on one island.
00:40:47.144 - 00:40:49.044, Speaker C: You cannot move it over the water.
00:40:49.464 - 00:42:07.744, Speaker B: You have to park it in some place. Essentially, you drive a car, you have to park it on the parking spot on one island, and then you wave a flag to someone on the other island, and then they give someone to give you the car on that side, and then you can drive there, which has to be created either from scratch or borrow from someone or something. But the assets on the other side remain there, and they have to be secured by some mechanisms that cannot be reliably maintained. Fully trustless, you still rely on something like, even if you can verify, if you have a CK chain bridge between two different chains, and you verify all the transactions within the, like, you can verify like two different ZK chains fully succeeding within this bridge, you still have the last line of like, subjectivity, where you're. You don't know if you're an economical fork of that chain or not, because if that community wants to fork away, the bridge will have no way to determine which is the kind of conversion. So you always rely on something. But within the layer three paradigm, we can make completely transparent chains, bridges that work as bridges.
00:42:07.744 - 00:42:18.324, Speaker B: You take assets on one side, they magically disappear there, and they appear on the other side. That is how bridges should work. And this is what should be called bridges, and not with that.
00:42:19.384 - 00:43:34.944, Speaker D: I really like this metaphor. And this is something that some platforms are working on. Like, I'm thinking about the shared security, for instance, where you can actually have, say, a main island that keeps track of what all the assets on the smaller islands. And when one smaller island wants to have, say, an assets from the other island, they just call Main island and say, hey, can I just borrow this one? And the main island will just keep track of where things flow. And if this tends to shared security again, which is something that cosmos is willing to implement, and that Polkadot has allows to have, I don't know if we should call this glitches, but at least it is permissionless, you don't have to trust, which is really good. And I hope that, as you said, and as Adi said before regarding Connex that all these bridges will be true bridges in the future and notices or whatever where you actually just have to trust not only the two chains, but also the relatives in the world.
00:43:35.524 - 00:44:12.914, Speaker B: And I just want to add one last thing. It's critical that those fully trustless bridges can only be built with ZA technology for fundamental reasons. We don't have time to expand on them. I'm happy to take questions after the panel and show them whatever, but you cannot do it with optimistic verification. You cannot do it with consensus quality, reliance and trust. You really need to just be able to rely on math in order to blindly trust that something really happened on the other side of the bridge. This is the only way today that we realistically can build those customers bridges.
00:44:13.934 - 00:44:59.978, Speaker F: I'm curious to look at these bridges when they build, because, like, it's the bridges, it's about several things. It's about how fast can I transact, right? And the cost, obviously. But like, how fast is it? Because, like current bridges, which are not bridges, takes too much time. Besides, I only know one from ethereum to user, which is also like work as a smart contract, which allows you to bridge fast. And I think the regarding composability, we have this one problem of synthetic tokens, right? So, like when we have some token on one chain, we try to send it to another chain where it does exist. We need to create a synthetic token. Then we send it to third chain and force chain, and then there's an effect.
00:44:59.978 - 00:45:26.464, Speaker F: And then we got the whole bunch of which I don't know if it's solvable in up chain universe, but it feels like potentially solo called NZK universe. However, I just. This is the stuff that just needs to be think about. I have no idea how what's the right solution? But maybe you guys have any.
00:45:29.344 - 00:45:49.408, Speaker A: We run out of time for today. Thank you guys so much. It's really exciting to see all the progress that's been happening in the space and what you guys have been building. I'm sure in like two, three years time, when we have a similar panel, it will be at such a more advanced stage. It's always nice to look back and for these discussions. So thank you again for your time and thank you.
00:45:49.576 - 00:45:50.224, Speaker E: Thank you very much.
