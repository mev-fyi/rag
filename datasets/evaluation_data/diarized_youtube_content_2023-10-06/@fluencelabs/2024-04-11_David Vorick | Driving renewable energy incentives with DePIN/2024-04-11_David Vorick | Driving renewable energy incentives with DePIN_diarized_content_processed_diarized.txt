00:00:07.400 - 00:00:27.194, Speaker A: Hey there. Welcome. This is Tom Trowbridge on the Deep End podcast, thrilled to be joined today by Dave Vork from Glow. And even though that's where he is now, he's got a long career in the space, longer than most, which we'll get into a little bit later. But first, I want to start with the normal question first, David, how do you define Dpin?
00:00:28.834 - 00:01:08.982, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I think crypto terms, just in general, tend to get more broad over time. Every project tries to put itself into the latest, greatest narrative. And so I think as deep in continues to take off, we're going to see people pushing at the edges and keep kind of redefining what deep end means. But I think the core of the original spirit was using blockchains to do things in the real world. And so helium, I think, was really the first project where that DPin name and narrative started to build really strong. But helium is not the first deep end project.
00:01:08.982 - 00:01:46.104, Speaker B: You have projects like Akash and Livepeer where Akash has like, physical GPU's, and then you have like hivemapper. Oh, for people who don't know, helium is a protocol that allows you to set up like nationwide or global mesh network, and you get rewarded with tokens for that. Akash is a network that allows you to set up a bunch of GPU's and then get rewarded for running computations for other people. So, yeah, I think just the main metric for DPIn is, are things happening in the real world because of stuff that's happening on a blockchain.
00:01:46.264 - 00:02:01.974, Speaker A: Fair enough. I mean, the way I think about it, tell me if you think this is right, is maybe this is too narrow, but crowdsourced infrastructure bound together into network by a software layer, secured and compensated via crypto economics via blockchain.
00:02:04.194 - 00:02:25.358, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah, I think that actually narrows the definition a little bit. For example, I think eventually you might see deep end projects that aren't crowdsourced that still argue they qualify as deep in. But I think all of the major projects that I can think of right now that call themselves deepen would apply to that whole definition.
00:02:25.526 - 00:02:42.034, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. And it's crowdsourced. To your point, does that mean individuals? Does it mean multiple companies? I suppose you're right. That may be problematic. I take that edit. So tell us about glow, and let's dig straight into what you're doing in this space.
00:02:42.644 - 00:03:56.364, Speaker B: Yeah, so Glow took inspiration more specifically from bitcoin, and I think a lot of people don't realize, but bitcoin is a deep end project where the physical stuff that's happening is the mining machines. And unlike more modern deep end projects that have a specific end goal, bitcoin is just securing itself. It's not trying to do a great thing for the world with its miners specifically, but it created the first model, and it showed that Deepin can be super successful. So Glow took inspiration from bitcoin's design. We basically said, look, this project, this crypto economic project called Bitcoin was super effective at putting out a very large amount of physical hardware, and we want to do the same thing. And instead of doing it with wasteful computation, why don't we take that economic model and use it to roll out a bunch of solar panels? So, glow, to answer your question specifically, glow rewards solar farms with tokens when they produce carbon credits. So glo's trying to shift the economy of electricity to be fully renewable.
00:03:57.784 - 00:04:20.374, Speaker A: And so then, is the idea of glow to help existing solar farms be more profitable and more economic? Or is it to. Are the economics such that you can actually launch new solar farms for which the economics could be bootstrapped via the token system would glow?
00:04:20.994 - 00:04:58.970, Speaker B: Yeah. So solar farm economics are kind of interesting in that, more than probably any other physical project, I know pretty much all of the expenses right up front. So once you've built your solar farm, it's actually almost free to maintain. It's super cheap to keep a solar farm running, especially relative to the value of the electricity it produces. So glow is not really worried so much about keeping existing solar farms online, because pretty much, if it made sense to build it in the first place, it makes sense to continue running it. And that's just pretty much universally true. They're so cheap to operate.
00:04:58.970 - 00:05:53.126, Speaker B: So glow is very, very focused on allowing new solar farms to come into existence. Then, even more than that, a lot of solar farms, at least by, like, percentage of solar farms, are profitable today, so they don't need help to exist. And if you look at, for example, California electricity is super valuable, and in California, it's super expensive. And so putting a solar farm on your roof pretty much always makes sense because it'll save you so much money on your utility bill that pays for itself. So glow isn't too worried about incentivizing solar in those regions. Instead, what glow wants to do is it wants to target the regions that are just barely not profitable. And so if a solar farm is, say, costs $100 to build, and it will produce, over its lifetime, $99 worth of electricity, a good businessman is going to pass on building that solar farms.
00:05:53.126 - 00:06:21.004, Speaker B: It's not a good use of money. So what glow will do is go to that businessman and say, hey, I'll give you $2 if you build the solar farm. And then the businessman, it now makes sense. And so Glo essentially tries to take carbon credit donations and token rewards and distribute them to solar farm owners in, like, just enough. It finds the solar farms that are closest to profitability and gives them just enough money to get them over the line.
00:06:23.654 - 00:06:39.714, Speaker A: That sounds like it could be very beneficial globally to do that, but also sounds difficult. How do you assess, or how does the protocol assess the profitability of one project or location versus another?
00:06:40.254 - 00:07:29.396, Speaker B: Yeah, so we actually found a super neat economic trick to take all of that difficulty and put it in the hands of businessmen themselves. So what we do, or what Glow does is Glow says you actually have two options. Either you can take cash for your carbon credits and give Glow all of your electricity value. So essentially, glow is buying both the carbon credits that you produce and it's buying the electricity, or you cannot participate in glow. And glow won't give you any money, but you get to keep your electricity value. And so, and then the glow just prices carbon credits at a certain rate, bitcoin style. It's like a glow is like, I have a $4.5
00:07:29.396 - 00:08:09.642, Speaker B: million pool to buy carbon credits, and whoever sells me carbon credits, they'll get a pro rata piece of that pool. And so the more carbon credits I get, the less I pay out for carbon credit. So it's this competition. What naturally happens is that solar farms that are profitable will look at this deal and they'll realize that actually keeping the electricity revenue is more profitable for them than selling carbon credits to globe. So they'll opt out. And so we automatically, by having this rule, the profitable solar farms will just sell filter. And then similarly, solar farms that are far away from profitability, that don't have super valuable electricity.
00:08:09.642 - 00:08:13.738, Speaker B: So glow rewards you more based on how much electricity value you have.
00:08:13.906 - 00:08:16.362, Speaker A: Solar farms, it's the market price of electricity.
00:08:16.538 - 00:08:17.154, Speaker B: What's that?
00:08:17.234 - 00:08:20.450, Speaker A: The market price of electricity in that local market, effectively.
00:08:20.522 - 00:09:05.764, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. We look at the local price of electricity on whatever balancing authority you're on. And so solar farms that are too far away from profitability, glows, rewards, actually won't be enough to bring you over the line of profitability. And so the solar farms that would be expensive for glow to fund also opt out because they go from non viable to still non viable. And so by glow's economics, are very, like, tightly structured, such that in a competitive environment, very naturally, only solar farms that are right on the edge of profitability get funded or will make sense to participate in glow. And of course, the more we scale up, the closer we can get to that line.
00:09:05.764 - 00:09:08.704, Speaker B: And so the further glow stretches every dollar.
00:09:09.764 - 00:09:26.504, Speaker A: Super interesting. So how then can you get a little bit more about how those mechanisms work? Because it sounds like that carbon credit pool is kind of the critical component of all this, and the scale of it, the monetization of it, and how that feedback mechanism works, I guess.
00:09:27.044 - 00:10:08.924, Speaker B: Yeah. So we spent probably six months iterating on different versions of the design and different reward paradigms, and then it turns out the one that makes the most sense is beautifully simple. So we had some very complicated machinery, and we realized that actually all the objectives get accomplished by doing something very simple. So Glo has, like, bitcoin token rewards. It rewards solar farms with 175,000 tokens per week. And the amount of tokens that you get is proportional to the amount of electricity revenue that you contribute to the protocol. So if you have super valuable electricity, you get more tokens.
00:10:08.924 - 00:10:59.204, Speaker B: Dollar based. Yeah, exactly. And then all of those dollars that we get from. From the solar farms go into a second rewards pool, which is the carbon credit rewards pool. And the carbon credit rewards pool gets distributed to solar farms based on how many carbon credits they produce. And so the more carbon credits you produce, the more cash you get, the more electricity revenue you produce, the more dollars you get. And that design, if you go into all the, like, second and third order effects, ends up being, like, the optimal way to distribute rewards to ensure that solar farms are basically going to do what I described earlier, where the profitable solar farms will automatically opt out, and the really unprofitable solar farms will also automatically opt out.
00:10:59.624 - 00:11:10.124, Speaker A: And those token rewards, I grasped that mechanism. And how do things flow back to the token and to the token value?
00:11:11.104 - 00:11:55.934, Speaker B: Yep. So as a solar farm, you get paid Glo tokens and cash for producing value for the Glow protocol. So the carbon credits are actually not owned by the solar farms. They're owned by the Glow protocol. And so Glo sells the carbon credits in an auction, and it uses the proceeds effectively to buy and burn glo tokens, which creates a floor price for GlO tokens. If you're Microsoft and you want to buy a bunch of carbon credits from the Glo protocol, effectively what you actually have to do is burn a bunch of Glo tokens to do that. And that means that as long as the carbon credits that Glo produces have value.
00:11:55.934 - 00:12:02.578, Speaker B: Those GlO tokens have value. And we brought value to the token holders, which is the solar farms.
00:12:02.746 - 00:12:21.574, Speaker A: So the carbon credit sale is deployed to burn the tokens, and you're minting whatever that is, 175,000 per period. I don't know what period it is. And is that a fixed number? Does that go down? Is that just sort of standard across?
00:12:22.394 - 00:13:12.330, Speaker B: Yeah. So we picked a fixed number. It's just 175,000 per week. And that will go out into infinity, which I know for a lot of people it's like, scary to have a token with no supply cap, but that's counterbalanced by the carbon credit production. And when we were doing all the modeling and trying to figure out, is this economy sustainable? We found our models suggest that a carbon credit price of anywhere between seven and $12, which, for reference, the UN currently pays $90 per carbon credit. So there's this wide margin. Then every dollar spent on inflation, or every token put into inflation should turn into more carbon credits than the cost of the inflation.
00:13:12.330 - 00:13:22.450, Speaker B: And so our models suggested that actually this should be a super sustainable model. And of course, we're not financial advisors. I don't want to go there.
00:13:22.562 - 00:13:39.894, Speaker A: No, of course. But that's interesting because also you benefit from just fiat inflation as well. Even if you didn't grow that fast, the fiat inflation would lead carbon credits to be worth more, which accrues to the GlO token also.
00:13:40.234 - 00:14:00.524, Speaker B: Mike. Exactly. And carbon credits historically have had a very decorrelated price from all other markets, whether it's real estate or stocks or bonds or crypto. And so it ends up, carbon credits end up being a very solid foundation for an economy.
00:14:03.784 - 00:14:19.574, Speaker A: Super interesting. And how big do you envision this? How do you measure scale, number of plants, number of panels, number of tons of carbon credits? Like, what are the metrics you're looking at? Where do you want to be? And where are you now?
00:14:20.114 - 00:15:17.994, Speaker B: Yeah, why don't we start with where we want to be? So the global electricity infrastructure, specifically grid electricity infrastructure, is responsible for about 40% of all global emissions. It's the single biggest category of emissions in the world. It would be more than half of all emissions if we were to switch to electric vehicles. So obviously that would be switching to electric vehicles would be a big gain for the world. But it also makes this single problem even bigger. And so if you want to have impact, by doing this very narrow targeting of the electrical grid and migrating it to solar, we're looking at something like 20 billion tons of CO2 per year, 20 billion carbon credits per year is the rough scale that globe could push to on the upper end of success. And I personally don't see any reason why that would be unattainable.
00:15:17.994 - 00:15:49.324, Speaker B: And so we've set a goal. The globe community has set a goal of scaling up to the point where glow is actually shifting the entire economy onto solar and away from, specifically coal, natural gas and diesel, which is all the emitting parts. Obviously, nuclear is not a problem, hydro is not a problem. But we think solar is the right way to go. And so we're kind of putting. The global community is putting all of its bets on solar and saying we're going to shift all coal and natural gas and diesel to solar.
00:15:49.864 - 00:16:03.244, Speaker A: So many questions still. Sorry. But also, is there then benefits of scale? Or if you have it on your house, would you be able to participate in glow? Just obviously a very small part, but could you do it?
00:16:03.624 - 00:16:32.884, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way that I imagine glow will grow is it will probably follow the same path that bitcoin did, where in the very beginning, you had GPU's, like people mining from laptops. Then it got to Asics. Then you had more serious hobbyists only setting up large rigs in their garage. Then that eventually moved to more professional. And today, someone at their house is not mining bitcoin for a large number of reasons. It doesn't make any sense.
00:16:32.884 - 00:16:53.904, Speaker B: So I think Glow is going to go the same direction. We actually skipped a lot of the early stages. So right now, the smallest that you can participate in glow and be successful is to put solar on your roof. So right now, that's a super viable way to participate. Glo, the rewards generally are bigger than the. Than the costs. And.
00:16:53.904 - 00:17:32.212, Speaker B: Yeah, so Glo's growth today is all focused on residential. But we know that as we scale up and as the protocol rewards get bigger, going to have bigger players coming in and looking at putting multiple megawatt farms in fields. And that's. We're kind of on the early end of that starting. But once that starts to kick off, I think the economics of scale really start to kick in. And Glow is really focused on solar that's right on the edge of profitability and producing as many carbon credits as possible. And so, of course, once you're at scale, I think the residential systems will start to get priced out.
00:17:32.212 - 00:17:32.516, Speaker B: Trey.
00:17:32.540 - 00:17:38.824, Speaker A: Well, and the residential systems don't contribute because they're not selling carbon credits, they're just doing the one half of that trade. Right.
00:17:40.404 - 00:18:25.914, Speaker B: Well, so they're producing carbon credits and we should talk a little bit more about what a carbon credit is. So, in general, a carbon credit is like a virtual or a theoretical asset. It's not an actual coin is theoretical asset. That's like someone did a thing, and as a result, there's less carbon in it in the atmosphere. And specifically, one carbon credit is supposed to map to one ton, one metric ton of carbon dioxide that's no longer in the atmosphere. So on glow, specifically glow is very focused on solar that competes with dirty energy on the grid. Your house today, if it doesn't have solar on it, is pulling energy off the electrical grid.
00:18:25.914 - 00:19:25.384, Speaker B: Even if your electrical grid is mainly clean, there's probably some natural gas involved. That's just how the energy market works today. And so you probably have a little bit of dirty power coming into your house. And then if you're in, like, Colorado, you have a lot of dirty power coming into your house. So by putting solar on your roof and using your own solar power, rather than pulling electricity off the grid, the energy grid actually has to be balanced, which, if you pump too much energy onto the grid, the voltage goes up or the speed goes up, and that will break devices that will break the grid. So if demand disappears from the grid, because now you're consuming your own solar, somewhere a power plant has to shut down or the grid destabilizes. And so we can actually identify if you're in a jurisdiction supported by glow, we can identify which power plant is shutting down as a result of you using your own solar power.
00:19:25.384 - 00:19:50.014, Speaker B: And we know the emissions, thanks to EPA and other regulatory bodies, we know the emissions associated with that power plant. And so we can certify a carbon credit on your home and say, this home, because it's using solar, produced 50 grams of carbon credits today. And that's probably about where you would be. It's like 50 to 100 grams a day.
00:19:51.114 - 00:19:54.814, Speaker A: So does this. Do you support countries outside the US?
00:19:55.674 - 00:20:18.854, Speaker B: Yeah. So we use a third party data provider called wattime. It's mostly the US, most of Europe, most of Australia, at least the populated parts. India is supported. Brazil and Peru are supported, most of Central America, most of Canada. So, like, notable, the. Probably the two biggest things that are missing that people ask about a lot are Africa and China are both not supported.
00:20:18.854 - 00:20:26.774, Speaker B: I believe China is, like, within six months, Africa is probably not. Within six months, Africa is probably going to be a while.
00:20:27.114 - 00:20:56.484, Speaker A: Fair enough. Well, I'm putting solar on my roof, and I will be checking it out, that's for sure. Let's take a step a little zoom out for a second and talk. Deepen in general, and I know you've designed this token economic system. You've been in this space for a while. So you thought a lot about what makes successful systems in this kind of crypto economic sphere. So love to kind of hear your kind of thoughts there because I think they're interesting.
00:20:56.484 - 00:21:02.184, Speaker A: As people look at a whole manner of projects or commonalities to success, I think that you've identified.
00:21:03.324 - 00:21:48.932, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've been in the space for 13 years and I've seen the bitcoin style reward scheme used in many different, like across many different use cases. And it's pretty much always a slam dunk. You don't really. Yeah, you don't really expect it not to take off. And so I kind of spent a lot of time like multiple years trying to wrap my head around what makes this system so effective. But the core principles that I think allow a deep end project to really explode the way Filecoin did or helium did is the first thing that you need is this.
00:21:48.932 - 00:22:24.570, Speaker B: I call it a big dumb pile of money. You don't actually want to be in the business of choosing who gets rewards. You want the market to decide that. And so you just have a giant pile of money and you say whoever can contribute resources to this common effort that we have. In bitcoin's case it's security and Filecoin's case it's hard drives. But in glow's case, solar panels is, whoever can produce solar panels is allowed to collect from the stump pile of money. And the number of, or in glow it's carbon credits.
00:22:24.570 - 00:23:20.932, Speaker B: Whoever, whoever produces the most carbon credits gets the biggest pie piece of the pie. And that alone, by being super hands off and not being judgmental, what you do is you give people the freedom to innovate. And so if someone in their basement who has super good technical skills is really good at optimizing, say, a solar farm, but they have no marketing skills, they don't have, they don't have sales skills, they don't have branding. And so really all they know how to do is build good infrastructure. DPin allows all of that other stuff to become unimportant. And so all of the biggest miners, like the actual physical miners on the bitcoin network are people you've never heard of, which is not true in, say, traditional cloud storage. We all know Amazon, Microsoft, Google, because in the traditional cloud storage market, it's not a deep end market.
00:23:20.932 - 00:23:59.244, Speaker B: It's a market where branding matters. Like you're not going to get a customer unless they know who you are and they trust you. But in bitcoin, bitcoin does not care who the supplier is. Bitcoin uses cryptography to validate the supplier and gets out of the way. And so by getting out of the way, you get all these overheads out of the way, and you allow the protocol to be significantly more efficient at deploying capital. And then the other thing is that it's super competitive. And so in the bitcoin world and in the file coin world and in the helium world, it's really important to cut costs.
00:23:59.244 - 00:24:41.814, Speaker B: And so if you can figure out how to take 3% costs off over a period of one or two years, that 3% compounds in a way that makes you totally dominant over everyone else. And so everyone is looking for every possible way to strip 1% here, 2% there. Sometimes even like in the bitcoin world, it's crazy competitive. I've seen people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to strip off a 10th of a percent of their cost structure. And they do that because it compounds so much. The extra profit margin is highly compounding in this ultra competitive environment that deepin creates, because there are no barriers to entry. And so you kind of want both.
00:24:41.814 - 00:24:55.554, Speaker B: You want both angles. You want to get all the overheads out of the way, and you also want to make sure that the people who are most competitive have, like, a really high advantage over everyone else. That drives everyone to cut costs and produce a lot more infrastructure.
00:24:56.774 - 00:25:45.944, Speaker A: Listen, that is exactly how I see it where you. The other overlay is. It's a global effort, so it's globally competitive, sort of implied and obviously implied in what you're saying. But fluence labs, we're launching a decentralized, serverless compute network. And just like the filecoin system, same concept where price will be competed globally. And so that leads to price discovering price floor, which probably continues to decline. The one thing I would say that I think is a little nuanced to what you said, but I think is a massive advantage of your project, is that if you look at a lot of deep end, look at the helium or file coins, as you've said, the rewards work because there is a brand in those projects and people project out the success.
00:25:45.944 - 00:26:29.344, Speaker A: Ultimately, they still have to get customers at some point in order to be ultimately viable. The cool thing about glow is you've got both sides, because your customer is just the buyer of those carbon credits. And that's far easier than signing up 10,000 users of storage or a million cell phone subscribers. The cool thing about what you're doing, I think, is that it's a far easier customer acquisition, if you will. The supply side, I get that's a challenge for everybody in this economics. The way you figured out may work, but it's the demand side for you, which is unlimited, effectively, and relatively easy to access.
00:26:30.594 - 00:27:03.334, Speaker B: Yeah. So that actually is one of the core reasons why I started working on glow. So for people who don't know, my previous project was called Sia. It was a decentralized cloud storage network. And crypto has a lot of engineering challenges. When you're building a crypto project, probably the majority of your risk and execution is bottlenecked by engineering and SIA and decentralized storage in general. Anyone, filecoin storage, all these guys will support this claim.
00:27:03.334 - 00:27:59.720, Speaker B: I think decentralized storage is probably the hardest engineering in crypto. And so when I ended my involvement in the SIA project, I wanted to be on the opposite side of the spectrum. I was like, we built for eight years, we got something kind of viable, but at the end, even after eight years, it wasn't obviously viable. And so I really wanted to look for a project that was going to be obviously viable without much engineering effort. And so to your point, glow, I picked specifically because I was like, oh, solar panels, we basically just count electricity and add numbers together. We don't have distributed systems, we don't have failovers. All of this engineering headache that's associated with things like zero knowledge proofs, or decentralized computer live peer and doing VPN stuff, or there's even like payment channels like lightning, or even switching from proof of work to proof of stake.
00:27:59.720 - 00:28:23.140, Speaker B: It took ethereum five years. All these things are super difficult. We just add numbers together in the glow community. And so I think that gives us a really big edge in that. A lot of the problems that is natural to any crypto project, I think Glow has a much lower exposure to. And then we just sell carbon credits.
00:28:23.332 - 00:29:25.854, Speaker A: Which makes life a lot easier, I think. But even that probably, they probably have to be validated. They probably break into that market. So I don't want to trivialize it. There's probably something to do, but certainly is a more, let's just say, fixed or finite or achievable objective than trying to find 1000 customers somewhere. One question, out of curiosity, obviously, you mentioned SIA and other projects. When you look at the Internet, the companies we know, particularly Google, in terms of search, Amazon, I suppose in terms of sales, are gen two companies, maybe gen three if you think of Yahoo or whatever, do you think crypto follows a similar path where there's a second generation that supplants what we know or the benefit of scale such that first gen can win?
00:29:26.634 - 00:30:32.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the way I would think about it is experience. And so first gen would be like, probably just like bitcoin. And if you remember, barbecue coin and pork coin and all of these nonsense modifications to bitcoin that didn't really add much value. I think of that as like first gen, where really is like bitcoin worked, and then everybody tried to copy it and had no idea what they were doing. Then you have second gen, which would be like your ethereums and your file coins and your sios, where it's like there's a much firmer understanding about what the value was. And then I think your third gen, and if it's not presumptuous, I'd like to throw a blow into the third gen category where it's like, now we understand both what the thing is, where the value of the thing comes from, and then also how to sell that value. And I think a lot of the like, for example, file coins or even Ethereum, you know, Ethereum did very well at creating like, a crypto casino.
00:30:32.604 - 00:31:29.920, Speaker B: There are lots of ways to extend that outside of it. But in the second gen, it really just kind of was stuck in the crypto casino territory. And now glow is built on Ethereum for those who don't know. So I'm saying this in defense of Ethereum. I think this third gen, it really comes down to watching all of the projects that were creating value, but having trouble delivering it to end users because of any number of hurdles. And there have been a lot. And so now your next round of products, I think, that are going to be truly successful and be the first, like giants, the first, like Google and Apple, et cetera, equivalents to come out of crypto are going to be the ones that know how to build a product that are specifically tailored to things that the world really needs and also know how to be delivered today, rather than needing all this innovation and development to get fully out the door.
00:31:29.920 - 00:32:21.114, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I would say any project that's innovating too heavily is probably vulnerable to a second follower maybe five years later, who can project, especially in crypto, gets stuck with the mistakes it makes early on. And five years later, someone else who's seen all your mistakes can build a much better core engine that is difficult for an old project to transition to. And so I kind of feel like the projects that are big today don't really have a moat. They have a branding moat, but they don't have a customer moat. And I think we're going to see a new wave. And this new bull cycle is probably going to pull in the first round of companies that's actually really good at catering to customers. I think we're seeing the beginning of that, but it won't really be obvious for probably another three years.
00:32:21.734 - 00:32:58.954, Speaker A: That's super interesting because you think of open source, you think of customers being able to move, and there are locking mechanisms, this and that, but theoretically you're able to move from a customer perspective much easier than traditional companies. The interesting thing though is some people talk about protocols not being companies and so being able to innovate faster. You're taking the position that there's sort of similar mechanisms at work, whether you're a legacy business or a protocol in terms of innovation and being stuck by or constrained by early technological choices. And that happens to traditional companies. It happens to crypto projects as well.
00:32:59.494 - 00:33:32.216, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that crypto protocols, I've been watching them for 13 years, I don't think it's very hard to argue that they move way slower in terms of innovation. Their advantages are in their openness and their ability to attract people in and give people tooling to mess around and be super creative. And that's actually where the moat comes from. Right. So Ethereum, the EVM, has a boatload of problems. It's far and away, like not a great machine, and we could do a lot better. And there are a lot of projects that have done a lot better.
00:33:32.216 - 00:34:02.052, Speaker B: The problem is all the developers know solidity, all the developers know the EVM. And anything that's a lot better is also a lot different. Just like fundamentally you can't be the same and be better, you have to be different. And if you're different, people don't know how to interoperate with Ul. There's also less tooling, there's a less vibrant ecosystem. And so what we're seeing happen very naturally is that Ethereum has this massive moat because it's what a lot of people would call good enough. And so Ethereum has lots of problems with it.
00:34:02.052 - 00:34:49.061, Speaker B: Yes, but it also has lots that you can do with it and you can do at scale in a successful way. And so because Ethereum is both good enough and has a ton of momentum behind, it has this big not really branding moat, but like community moat or protocol moat, that ecosystem moat. Yeah, like an ecosystem moat that protects it from followers like say, Solana or like Swe, who ostensibly have much better core systems. But a great core system is nothing without a rich ecosystem of developers. And so I think this applies to any protocol. You see this with Uniswap too, or Uniswap as well. Uniswap has not that much.
00:34:49.061 - 00:34:54.013, Speaker B: The code for Uniswap is open source and it's not that complicated. It's pretty easy to understand how it works.
00:34:54.053 - 00:34:55.941, Speaker A: It's been copied, it's been forced, it's.
00:34:55.957 - 00:35:29.024, Speaker B: Been copied hundreds of times. And people have been very aggressive about things like vampire attacks. But the boss dog is still Uniswap despite the fact that they have no defendable moat in the traditional sense. They have a lot of brand and ecosystem around them that really makes it work. And so, yeah, I think protocols move slowly and they get their defensible moat from community and ecosystem. And that moat is actually, and we've seen it play out for a decade, that mode is actually really strong and it's perfectly defensible as a protocol.
00:35:29.604 - 00:36:10.134, Speaker A: Super interesting. That makes sense and we'll probably see it continue. But to your point, that doesn't prevent new generation of projects that have a more precisely targeted market fit or solving a more precise market need becoming far larger and more successful. And that happening over the next couple of years as you identify and deepen could be, is sort of one of those, I think is a way, an example of what you're talking about is exactly this deepen sector, which is searching and is finding that level of market fit, whether you talk about helium or others. Right?
00:36:10.674 - 00:36:57.524, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that Deepin is kind of. I've seen a lot of, I don't know if you've heard of like demo, which is doing a bunch of car technology. There's like what's called spexy, which is doing a bunch of drone technology. I think that there are a lot of deep end projects sprouting up right now that have identified clear customer needs and then said, hey, wait a minute, we can use crypto incentives to really drive down the cost and drive up the scale of solving this problem. And so I'm really excited to be part of the deep end movement. And I also, the other thing that really excites me is unlike AI, I feel like if you're an AI company, no matter what you do or what your focus is, OpenAI is this big scary competitor.
00:36:57.524 - 00:37:45.704, Speaker B: But if you're specsy and you're competing in deepin, nobody else is really doing what specsy is doing. Why? Because while there's so many interesting problems to tackle, that why would you copy spexy? You could probably make a lot more money doing your own thing and same thing. So nobody's doing solar but glow, because all the really great deep end minds kind of have their own place that they gravitate to and their own place that they're going to make their own green field to make lots of money. I just see it as, like, as an entrepreneur and as an operator. Every single one of my peers who innovates on deep end isn't a threat. It's exciting because none of them are doing what I'm doing and I'm not doing what any of them are doing. So there's a much more, like, collaborative and almost fun environment to this, like, really genesis stage of deepen narrative.
00:37:45.824 - 00:38:20.022, Speaker A: It's not like all your friends, you're in a layer one, all your friends are in layer ones, and you're competing with each other. It's a completely different thing. Or your XYZ defi protocol that you're all, you know, know, working to capture TLV versus someone else. On that point, though, I think the helium example, just the simplest. I think of that as like a global telco being built with zero capex, more or less, right. And very little overhead. And so there's like ten telcos worth over 40 billion or more.
00:38:20.078 - 00:38:20.270, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:20.302 - 00:38:35.232, Speaker A: So there's just mass. And those are almost all domestic. So when you start thinking the scale, you realize how big they are. What I was going to say is you could have ten competitors around the world. Like, it's not going to move the needle. So when you think of how big you can be. You mentioned that 40 billion excess carbon credit market.
00:38:35.232 - 00:38:47.804, Speaker A: So deep into my mind, there is just so many sectors that could be so large given the global nature here. That's what I think you're also referencing.
00:38:48.584 - 00:39:18.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's just a. It's a place where projects can identify something specific that crypto brings value into the world. And so it's not just helping the deep end narrative, it's like helping, you know, every time someone buys drone images off of specsy, that moves the crypto narrative forward. It's like, oh, crypto is doing something useful for real now. Like, I actually just. I needed this thing and I got it because of crypto.
00:39:18.814 - 00:40:08.704, Speaker B: And same thing for glow. It's like every time a solar panel goes up, the entire world is saying that we need to reduce carbon emissions. Every time glows up a solar farm that's materially moving the needle on a goal that is dear to 60% to 80% of the global population. And so every time one of these projects makes a single sale that the person that is sold to gets validation, they're like, oh, crypto is now doing something real. For me personally, I am benefiting from crypto and I think that's going to completely change the entire outlook that people have on crypto, going from this super early stage casino to people being like, oh wait, the promises that people were saying in 2008, theyre finally coming forward.
00:40:09.444 - 00:40:34.994, Speaker A: Preston, I hope thats the case. There also is potential that the crypto is abstracted out. So crypto just runs behind this without people even knowing that its happening because thats the other possibility is people get low rewards, but theyre done via an intermediary that pays them in dollars and the carbon credits are sold someone else. So people dont even know the economic crypto system behind it is that.
00:40:36.054 - 00:41:19.096, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean, that's, I think a worthwhile point. So Glow has actually worked very hard to abstract the crypto away from its customers. So you buy carbon credits over stripe through like a certified glow reseller that they handle all the crypto behind the scenes for you. And solar farms receive rewards in USDC, then some of them receive it in glow tokens. Some of them already have deals set up behind the scenes where investors will just take Glo tokens and cash them out immediately. Technically speaking, you don't have to know anything about crypto. You don't have to be aware that crypto is involved to participate in Glow.
00:41:19.096 - 00:41:52.880, Speaker B: But I can promise you that there are way more people on the crypto side who are excited about glowing just because they see like as long as you have a token, you'll have a community of loud mounts who are supporting you. And that's happening with glow, that's happening with Spexi, that's happening with helium. You get this big vocal community. And so I don't think that even if you abstract the crypto out, it's going to be very visible at the zoomed out level that crypto is making this market happen. Yeah.
00:41:52.952 - 00:42:20.744, Speaker A: And what you really want is those early users who are paid in tokens. You hope they hold on to those tokens, and as you succeed, as the network succeeds, those tokens increase in value. They are rewarded by an increase in the value of the tokens they hold. Example I give is sort of like early sellers on Amazon help Amazon scale and all they get are higher prices from Amazon down the road. Right, but if you're an early, direct competition from more competition. Exactly. Hit on both ends.
00:42:20.744 - 00:42:31.104, Speaker A: But if you're early on glow or one of these other, you know, deep in protocols, if you earn those tokens, you help the network succeed. You should benefit economically by appreciation of that asset. You hope.
00:42:31.144 - 00:42:31.344, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:31.384 - 00:42:33.324, Speaker A: That's how it should all work.
00:42:33.784 - 00:43:11.006, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. And I think it's worth bringing up regulatory angst. Blo has worked very hard to be regulatory compliant. SEC hasn't made it easy, and I think we're doing okay on that front, actually. But it blows my mind that the SEC isn't jumping all over this stuff as a good thing. It's like when someone is contributing to Uber, for example, Uber is this massive project that, traditionally speaking, you would have had 100,000 employees. They'd all have a little bit of equity.
00:43:11.006 - 00:43:54.950, Speaker B: So many people are chipping into making Uber possible, but because Uber does contracting and whatnot, and securities law doesn't allow Uber drivers who are contractors to get securities if they're not accredited, they have no exposure to the success of Uber. And, like, the earliest Uber drivers are still poor. And it's just, like, crazy to me that we're in a world where we're all building the future together. And, like, some dude at the top named Travis is taking 60% of the value. And most of the people who are doing that building aren't getting anything. To me, it, like, makes me feel deeply unsatisfied with our current regulatory regime. And it makes me think there's got to be a better way to structure the flow of money in our economy.
00:43:54.950 - 00:44:39.974, Speaker B: And I think when you look at, like, the wealth gap and stuff, a lot of it is not because rich people aren't being taxed. It's because the fundamental economy, the fundamental stock market, is structured in a way that money just moves up the ladder, and regulators should be rebuilding that ladder or that economy so that value flows outwards. And I think higher taxes is not the right thing. You have to come in and rebuild it almost crypto wise. Where, like, when you think about Ethereum, who got rich off of Ethereum? Well, the biggest Ethereum holder owns, like, maybe 10%, if that. And all the early people, there are like hundreds of thousands of people who are early to crypto, who are now millionaires today because of their participation in early crypto. And it's just, it seems like a much healthier way to build an economy.
00:44:39.974 - 00:44:53.544, Speaker B: And so it boggles my mind that regulators are really against it because I think the way that crypto redistributes wealth to the people who help create it is a really positive thing. It's a good thing for our society.
00:44:53.844 - 00:45:03.004, Speaker A: Yeah. Listen, strongly agree. And I'd say even stronger. It's not that. Back to your uber example. It's not that they didn't participate. They were prevented.
00:45:03.004 - 00:45:14.434, Speaker A: It's illegal to do it. Right. Like from a paternalistic, you know, well meaning, but ultimately flawed approach for, you know, obviously a different era.
00:45:15.654 - 00:45:41.734, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so I would really like to see, you know, Congress reconsider how all these things are built and ask themselves, you know, the world has moved on to a gig economy. How do we make sure that the biggest contributors to the gig economy are the biggest winners financially and that that doesn't happen by taxes and wealth redistriction. Redistribution. It happens by ownership, redistribution, distribution, and making sure that money goes to the people creating value.
00:45:44.394 - 00:46:05.014, Speaker A: Totally agreed. With regard to glow and your history, your entrepreneurial history, what do you draw on that has been most helpful in building this? Looking back to all the projects you've been on, what are some lessons that you've learned or some experiences that have been most helpful?
00:46:05.904 - 00:46:41.340, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, man. I think a lot. I've gotten a lot of bruises and a lot of broken bones, metaphorical broken bones, from making mistakes in crypto or watching my friends make mistakes in crypto and other big projects. I think probably the one that people are furthest away from understanding or integrating is the importance of. I call it a really low IQ narrative. 98% of your fans are fans because they read headlines about you, and they don't read the articles.
00:46:41.340 - 00:47:10.118, Speaker B: They don't get into the nuance. And so they may not be low IQ fans themselves, but the amount of attention they pay to your project commands a very low IQ understanding of what your project is doing. And I've seen this a ton in bitcoin. It happened in Sia. It happens in mining. The lowest common denominator headline that's believable. It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
00:47:10.118 - 00:48:27.904, Speaker B: And I think that's what people really get stuck on is that, like, oh, there's, like, a belief right now that the truth will come forward, and maybe eventually it will, but in the short term, in, like, this decade, that's not how the Internet works. The snazziest headline that is believable, whether or not it's true, that's the headline that defines your project's brand, and that's how you get people like Craig Wright out there. Being super successful in commanding a huge following, Craig Wright is really effective at putting out snazzy, believable headlines that people buy into, and they just don't look further because this isn't an era where people do much research unless they're really bought into a project. So your deepest followers will understand everything, but your average follower will have a very low iq understanding of what your project does. And so I think most important, and something that glow has been really engineered around is making sure that whatever lowest common denominator headline, whatever snazzy headline is out is flattering to glow. And we just assume that the majority of those snazzy headlines are probably going to be incorrect. But we've tried to make sure that the decisions we made lead itself to flattering, snazzy headlines.
00:48:27.904 - 00:48:42.104, Speaker B: And I don't know that that's necessarily, that's kind of like really cyberpunk, dystopian reality. But until, until our information engine is better, we just kind of have to live with that.
00:48:42.884 - 00:49:18.114, Speaker A: Don't hate the player, but, and, you know, the flip side of that, which is a little different, but you know, that is a learning on kind of what to do. I guess there's a little bit of what not to do, but anything more explicit in things that you've seen done that you shouldn't do or mistakes made or things that you've. Maybe it's a little bit because obviously that comment incorporates a bunch of learning, but anything on the negative side that you regret or think people should avoid.
00:49:18.504 - 00:49:50.804, Speaker B: Yeah. So Sia was a fair launch project, which meant that the devs had no tokens and the project had no tokens. There was no treasury. Basically, all the tokens went to the miners. That created an ecosystem for people to participate off of. And at the time, it was seen as very fashionable and it was seen as immoral for devs to take tokens or for there to be a project treasury, or for there to be any sort of pre miner developer fee. And that just totally got in the way of Tye's ability to execute.
00:49:50.804 - 00:50:36.474, Speaker B: It had at one point in time, the project had a $3 billion market cap. The dev team had $750,000 in the bank. A lot of people were accusing me over and over and over of spending all the money on yachts and just going sailing with hot girls all day, which I would have loved to have been doing. But it created this really big problem where people expected us to act like a multi billion dollar entity, and we absolutely had no possible way to do that. We were still in the garage stage, financially. And so, yeah, what I would say is, like, make sure your project has a rich treasury. You don't find successful corporations in the wild not hoarding money.
00:50:36.474 - 00:51:06.864, Speaker B: And so I think if you want to be successful in a capitalist society, are in a capitalist economy, your project needs to have a healthy amount of funding. So with flow, we didn't make that mistake. Flow has a really big grants pool. The Devco got a decent token allocation. And so there are lots of ways to make sure that if glow hits a $3 billion market cap, glow can actually execute, like, a $3 billion ecosystem. And there will be players with significant amounts of money that are working on behalf of.
00:51:07.754 - 00:51:18.610, Speaker A: Fair enough. So make sure you got the funding. I get that. Without a doubt. That's a good lesson. Listen, appreciate it. Appreciate all the super interesting thoughts.
00:51:18.610 - 00:51:28.614, Speaker A: Last question for you. Bitcoin, end of 2024. Where do you think bitcoin is?
00:51:30.474 - 00:51:35.294, Speaker B: Oh, man. I feel like it's risky to give any answer.
00:51:35.654 - 00:51:40.634, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's almost impossible to get this right. A lot of ways to get it wrong.
00:51:41.094 - 00:52:26.104, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think. I think with, like, the election cycle coming up and just a lot of macroeconomic effects, I also think with projects like low and other deep ins stepping forward and providing a lot of, like, narrative juice to the crypto ecosystem, we're still in a point where crypto is like, the. Sorry, bitcoin is the grandad of crypto, and so it's impossible for crypto to do well without also sending bitcoin up in value. Maybe in the next cycle that won't be the case, but right now, crypto absorbs the majority. Sorry. Bitcoin absorbs the majority of the inflow of people getting excited about crypto, and I don't see any reason why that would change this particular cycle.
00:52:26.104 - 00:52:42.014, Speaker B: We're already there. Bitcoin was the first mover. Think it'll continue to move. So I am very bullish on crypto as a whole for 2024, and I also think it's reasonable to assume that bitcoin will absorb most of that value for the time being.
00:52:42.834 - 00:52:49.454, Speaker A: All right, bullish. That means above. Above 68, 70,000. How much? Unclear, I suppose.
00:52:49.954 - 00:52:53.330, Speaker B: Yeah, but. Right. I don't want to put it.
00:52:53.442 - 00:53:09.494, Speaker A: Fair enough. Listen, all good. Listen, thank you. Thanks again for being on for such an interesting conversation. Appreciate you doing it, and best of luck on glow, how do people find you, follow you, keep track of everything you're doing, writing, saying, executing.
00:53:09.994 - 00:53:31.134, Speaker B: Yeah. So in the near future, I believe glow.org will be a reliable place to go, but that domain is still being transferred over. So in the meantime, twitter.com davidborick or glowlabs.org. From the website you can find a discord. Discord's where all the fun is.
00:53:31.134 - 00:53:44.534, Speaker B: The website will also link to like a white paper and a bunch of an faq. But yeah. And in the near future, I think, I think it's safe to say that glow.org will be part of the glow ecosystem.
00:53:44.954 - 00:53:52.634, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, look forward to success. And if you've got a roof, get it on glow. Thanks again, David. Absolutely.
