00:00:06.800 - 00:00:28.370, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Thanks for being at the DP&AI panel today. I'm Natalie, the general manager of Bustup. Thank you for having me to be the moderator of this panel today. Let's welcome our speaker guest. Today we have speakers from Theoric, filecoin and also Thor. Should we start with some self interest first, David, do you want to start first? Yeah.
00:00:28.450 - 00:00:59.480, Speaker B: Thank you. Good to be here. Good to meet everybody. I'm David, I'm co founder and CPO at Theoric. @ Theoric, we're building a decentralized protocol for AI agents with a focus on enabling agent communication, agent coordination, agent trade and transaction experiments. And on top of that we're launching a marketplace for AI agents where creators can come in and build and monetize their AI agents. Spent my career in AI mostly 15 years, but then been in web sites since about 2017, so I guess it's been a while and web3 years.
00:00:59.480 - 00:01:04.060, Speaker B: So yeah, very happy to be here today and talk about AI agents and why we're excited.
00:01:04.960 - 00:01:33.026, Speaker C: Hi everyone, my name is Clarence how, the founding officer at the filecoin Foundation. For those that aren't aware, filecoin is the world's largest decentralized storage network. We have over 3,000 storage providers all around the world running data centers. We believe that data should not be in the hands of centralized providers. And you can imagine AI Deepin, all of these different applications we're seeing. Web3 very much need a decentralized infrastructure. So Filecoin has been around since 2014.
00:01:33.026 - 00:01:37.870, Speaker C: The original white paper was written over a decade ago and we've been at this for the past 10 years.
00:01:38.890 - 00:02:14.504, Speaker D: Hello, I'm Tom Trowbridge, co founder of Fluence. Fluence is a decentralized compute platform. So what filecoin does for storage, we like to think of ourselves an analogy for computer. So we also like the importance of storage not being centralized. Most compute, almost all compute outside of smart contracts is centralized. That includes compute that nodes run on that blockchains run on that key Web three infrastructure runs on. Almost all of that runs in the cloud and we think that is a mistake and it should be run in a decentralized planner.
00:02:14.504 - 00:02:27.840, Speaker D: That's hard to do. 2019 we found influence prior to Fluence. I helped found Hedera Hashgraph, the layer one. But excited to talk about Deepin in detail here.
00:02:28.620 - 00:02:51.560, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the introductions. I know right now we have decentralized RH Compute and also collaborating AI agents on this panel today. So I just want to start with a warm up question to Ask personally why did you start working on the project that you're working on right now? What inspired you exactly?
00:02:53.160 - 00:03:36.890, Speaker B: I guess I can get started. I think that's a really good question. I mentioned earlier, I've been in my career in AI since 15 years. I've always believed that AI is this game changing technology that's really in our lifetime driving to a drastic change of how we interact, how we think about knowledge, work, how we think about work in general. And I think it's just more and more coming out that that's actually true. And one thing I strongly believe that when we started Theoic and really was sort of a driver for everybody in the founding team is that we don't really want AI technology, that really powerful technology in the hands of a few monopolies. And we think there has to be a system where community can come in and co create sort of that future.
00:03:36.890 - 00:04:07.420, Speaker B: We're also very excited about and really contribute the individual pieces that really reflect, be it in the form of agents, what sort of somebody's excited about their specific knowledge and then have agents come together and sort of work together in teams to solve some of the hardest tasks as opposed to having monopolies really come in and build and launch monolithic applications that are just not going to be as impactful as we think the community is going to be.
00:04:08.120 - 00:04:57.258, Speaker C: Yeah. For me, I've spent most of my life working on content integrity on the web. From trust and safety building the first largest professional association for trust and safety professionals, to looking at this in hats like foreign influence operations and terrorist use of the Internet. At the end of the day, I think 67% of Americans right now trust AI and trust what they believe is content on the web. I think by 2026, 80% of the web, some estimate, will be generated by AI. And the next version of that that we're all going to start using is going to be something that includes a lot of AI in the mix. I think companies, enterprises, startups, everyone wants to be able to manage that data and that's why this is such an important area for me personally to focus on.
00:04:57.258 - 00:05:17.730, Speaker C: Because we can't necessarily manage and think about permissions for data, everything downstream, it's easy to distrust it or it's easy for bad actors to misuse it. And I'm really thrilled to actually be able to work with both Theric and Fluence both on this panel on all layers of how we can decentralize the stack.
00:05:18.550 - 00:06:29.160, Speaker D: I think the inspiration for Fluence came from co founders living in a pretty totalitarian country and realizing the need for non centralized alternatives to the centralized kind of state controlled infrastructure. And you know, it's interesting when we started talking to investors about this, that actually found, it was found in 2017, talking to investors in 2019, 2020, you never wanted to say you were competing with the cloud. No one competed with Amazon. That wasn't even on the table as an alternative, as something that was viable that anybody would invest in you. Fast forward a couple of years and now I think both the risks of the centralized cloud and the opportunities, especially using crowdsourced infrastructure, are pretty clear. And so I think the opportunity kind of has moved to where we are and has moved to us over this period of time as the risks associated with the clouds and the vulnerabilities associated with the clouds have become very apparent for kind of for the broad audience.
00:06:30.460 - 00:06:59.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very interesting because I actually want to ask the next question about like a competition in the PIN and AI space because for decentralized storage you don't only have to like compete with Web3 projects where you haven't had to like compete with like the traditional AWS servers and all that kind of stuff. So I want to ask like in a space like that, is that competitive? How did you build your platforms or product differently to differentiate yourself and stand out in the market?
00:07:00.760 - 00:07:59.688, Speaker D: I'll start that to mix it up. I think we're starting in a very specific use case right now and that specific use is running nodes for blockchain businesses. And so there are a variety of businesses out there that basically run nodes for layer ones for a variety of different Web3 infrastructure. Those companies are very happy to save about 80% which is the discount you get when you use a decentralized network like Flu Influence. And so I think that very specific, very narrow use case we are going to scale in that and as we scale there we will add additional use case on top of it. And that's a price sensitive use case for a very, a market that is also attracted and is sort of constitutionally focused on decentralization as well. So it's kind of mission aligned as well as being price sensitive and is a combination of Web two, Web three.
00:07:59.688 - 00:08:06.740, Speaker D: So that's, I think what we're discovering obviously is you want to start narrow specific and expand from there.
00:08:07.360 - 00:08:44.962, Speaker C: Yeah, there's really four types of use cases for Filecoin. The first one is really Web2 archival storage. We store a lot of the world's data from data on Internet Archive to data sets from MIT Open Learning, Stanford. You can imagine we've stored the whole genomic sequencing on Filecoin as well. The second category is really around web 2 hot storage and then web 3 object storage. This includes NFT, Dapps, anything you can imagine where storage is needed. Also AI agents and a few of the other projects we've heard about earlier today.
00:08:44.962 - 00:09:31.100, Speaker C: And then finally, one area that we're also looking at at is chain data. So we've worked with Solana and other projects to really store their chain history and just make sure that we can take the decentralized Web three properties of storage and really take that to the next level. But obviously Web2 is a lot harder to get to as customers. Six to eight 12 months, the typical sales cycle when it comes to enterprise storage. And so for us, it's also teaching along the way. And I'm sure both of these other panelists here have also had to do a lot of education to teach about decentralized AI agents or decentralized compute. Because a lot of the people that store infrastructure these days, they're very much sometimes not the most in depth on the latest technical specifications.
00:09:31.100 - 00:10:17.110, Speaker C: Some of them work in places where they're not the main decision maker, but they just want some kind of cloud solution. For us, the most attractive to two pieces for decentralized storage has been really being able to store archival data at a fraction of the cost as aws, but also on top of that having no single point of failure. So we've seen so many incidents even this year where because of single points of failure, airline systems have gone down, people have lost small businesses. When you have decentralized storage and then decentralized compute and also decentralized AI agents on top of it, you really allow for that redundancy of data to stay permanent and also a lot of businesses and services to be also accessed, even if there's a major cybersecurity attack or whether a system goes down.
00:10:19.090 - 00:11:24.034, Speaker B: Maybe. Maybe a bit of a spicy take on what makes us different. I think that Web3 is a lot about the narrative and many people are jumping on the AI agent narrative as we speak. I think what differentiates us in a way is that we have technology out there that works and that scales. And we launched our testnet a few months back, a few weeks back, we seen some really good adoption, recently had hit ten millions of transactions to AI agents, which is something we're super excited about. I guess beyond that, one thing that sets us apart is from the beginning we sort of believed in the power of AI agent Collectors, which draws a multi, multi agent systems where agents get together in a way, potentially dynamic way to form teams that are sort of built to solve some of the most hardest tasks that are out there. And from the beginning we built our protocol and our ecosystem in a way that sort of both enables individual creators to contribute AI agents to these collectives so that collectives, AI agent collectors, can form across different pieces of code as long as agents all follow the same standards.
00:11:24.034 - 00:11:51.230, Speaker B: And that's sort of something we from the beginning really pushed because we do believe and I think it's showing that there isn't going to be that one agent out there that's going to solve everything for everybody. But individual people contributing something that is really specific to their skill sets is what matters. And then bringing all these skill sets together in teams to solve some of the hardest tasks I think is where the future is headed. And we've built the protocol that really enabled.
00:11:51.980 - 00:12:18.680, Speaker A: Thank you for the insight for sharing. I think Clara touched on like how is it difficult to onboard people in web 2 to web 3? I just want to ask like the next question is like what do you think are the biggest challenges to have more people to use decentralized technology specifically depending and AI? Is it the tech, the UX or like just like onboarding with the go to market strategies? What do you guys think about it?
00:12:18.800 - 00:12:59.714, Speaker C: A lot of us at the filecoin network, we like to compare to distributed storage like Airbnb. It's a great analogy. Imagine before Airbnb existed, someone were to tell you, hey, go and stay in a random house with a stranger. If you're framing it as that way, nobody would stay in an Airbnb today. And that's the way that we think about decentralized storage. When we have to explain not only how it's different from traditional storage, but also the unique properties and sometimes we have to use different language that helps resonate with users. I was telling our team we had a filecoin developer summit for three days that no one cares about corefs in the enterprise storage world.
00:12:59.714 - 00:13:26.920, Speaker C: They just want to see a green checkmark. And I think it's up to all of us working at the frontier of decentralized storage and decentralized compute and decentralized AI to really also find the right language to translate because that's sometimes the biggest barrier. It's not the tech. There's been great tech that have been built, but in order to scale and go to market and scale to the next hundred million users, we need to all think about how to also resonate and communicate in a way that people understand.
00:13:27.780 - 00:14:31.428, Speaker D: I would add to that or distill it to say you have to have a better product full stop, period time. That simple product has to be better. And I think if you look at Deepin, you know, look at fluence, you know, we'll be, you know we're I think around 80% cheaper or decentralized or open. So you can leave any time, no cost. I think that is a better product. But if you expand out Deepin you look at a, you know a lot of non digital deep ins like you can look at a helium or a hive mapper or a spec C or a number of these geode that are providing sometimes 10 times better service, a more specific service, a more precise location, a more refreshed map, more data points on a car kind of, you name it, sometimes 10 times more than the traditional centralized competitor at a price that is half or 20%. So like it's multiple orders of magnitude superior service.
00:14:31.428 - 00:14:48.320, Speaker D: And I think that is what you need for deep into scale. And I think this coming year is the year 2025 where you'll see material revenue in the deep end sector and see this, these products actually get real traction and the market wake up to it.
00:14:49.020 - 00:15:20.546, Speaker B: Maybe adding a little bit to what already was that I think AI agents is a bit different in the sense that there isn't even really a good web2 alternative out there. So it becomes less a question of how do I convince people to, to use a Web3 product over a Web2 product. I think more if this is the problem you get with any decentralized ecosystem. If I have an ecosystem where everybody contributes sort of an agent or whatever it is AI technology, I think how do I trust that, how do I establish trust in that ecosystem really becomes critical to user adoption.
00:15:20.658 - 00:15:56.540, Speaker A: I can really resonate with what you guys just said because like at Bushel we are trying to build a product with good UX to also find a way to better communicate to broadband to audience so that we can drive mass adoption. And yeah, and just like great to hear this kind of insightful sharing and I also want to like talk about a little bit on AI as well because I focus a lot of DP and stuff, right? So I want to ask like are there any new AI technologies that recently caught your attention and how does that like affect how you build your product or like build your ecosystem?
00:15:57.520 - 00:16:34.642, Speaker B: Maybe I can take this. Obviously everything in the AI agent space is quite new. So I think AI agents in itself and what Powers that agent. There's just so much coming out that I guess you just have to be really adaptive with how you build your product. Maybe one perspective that is a bit contrary to I guess the original question, but something I'm super excited about is that maybe a year back you had these powerful language models, but the most powerful models were all quite expensive. So the powerful models were really needed to solve some of the hardest challenges like trading, like data analytics. Quite expensive, very difficult to scale.
00:16:34.642 - 00:17:09.760, Speaker B: I, I think what we're seeing happening right now is that these powerful models from a year ago become the cheap models of today. And that really enables us and anybody in the space to run all of these really great and complex use cases at scale. And then obviously you have the new generation of powerful models. They are going to unlock even I guess, more powerful use cases that are out there. But the ability to scale, sort of trading data analytics agents taking asynchronous actions on behalf of the user with the models that are out there right now, I think it's super exciting.
00:17:10.980 - 00:18:06.666, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the area that I'm most excited about is today's web right now has a lot of data that is very biased. Right. When you look at and search on Google, it's not like going to a physical library where you're finding a book about nature and it's not most neutral information. I think for us, the beauty of us basically backing up the most important information on the web is then you can relook at information in a new lens, even old information that people haven't been able to search on the web today. So one example is we've been piloting with Theoric with an organization called Muck Rock that actually posts a ton of information around. When people have a foia, Freedom of Information act and look at government data and these are documents that sometimes no one has accessed before. When you can add an AI agent on top, you can look at really cool CIA information, you can search better in a way that today's search isn't even possible.
00:18:06.666 - 00:18:23.992, Speaker C: And I think this is one example of really combining decentralized storage and AI, especially decentralized AI agents. Putting those two together, you really find new ways of finding key information and also unlock things that no one's been able to find on the web today.
00:18:24.176 - 00:19:18.664, Speaker D: I think the angle I'll take here is the risks of centralized large AI. I think as AI becomes a source of truth, which I think it becomes more and more the case you ever run ever increasing risks of a number of constituencies trying to manipulate and, and force certain answers that could be from governments, from shareholders, from activists, you name it. And you can see the risks of that in the Google Gemini image creation which happened six months ago, and the absurd result that it generated, clearly the result of forcing that model to generate certain results which were wildly inaccurate, that was, I think, super beneficial because you got to see the risks of what's happening under the hood. It wasn't for images, you know, it's happening for everything. Images just made it obvious. And so that's what happens with centralized AI. It's just not as clear.
00:19:18.664 - 00:20:07.776, Speaker D: And so decentralization will become more and more important and I think become more and more a source of real truth in AI, less subject to manipulation. And that's where decentralized compute comes in. Because if you're centralized and you're running in a particular data center, particular geography, that is an easy leverage point. So you need to have both data that's verifiable, the training has to be verifiable, and then the prompt has to be clearly has to be prompted and proved that it was done against the actual model without manipulation. And then the answer without manipulation. And those are a lot of different steps, some of which require GPUs, some of which work on CPUs. And I think that decentralized computer is, you know, you cannot run and have a decentralized AI without decentralized compute.
00:20:07.776 - 00:20:26.420, Speaker D: It just doesn't sound impossible. Right. So that is, I think a very critical piece where you're going to see decentralized compute come into play behind the scenes with regards to AI as AI scales and becomes more a source of truth and more source of attention for a number of constituencies.
00:20:27.410 - 00:20:45.834, Speaker A: Right. We talked about a lot of like the tech side. I just want to touch on a little bit on like how do we onboard users. So is there like a target audience, like a specific target audience when it comes to go to market? Because like for example, fileco has been here for a long time, like how do you onboard new users?
00:20:45.882 - 00:20:46.522, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:46.706 - 00:20:48.710, Speaker A: So I'm just curious about this.
00:20:49.090 - 00:21:20.918, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I mentioned the different categories of storage we offer. Actually just this, this week we announced tons of new Filecoin L2s really looking at different targeted customers. Right. We have companies like Akave that's really building on ramps to really make it easy to take existing Amazon S3 companies and have a single API to make it easier to move to the decentralized web. We have companies like Sriracha that are really competing in the hot storage space. There's companies like NFT Storage. If you own an nft, you're already using cloud core and ipfs.
00:21:20.918 - 00:22:25.576, Speaker C: And then I talked a little bit about, you know, chain back because a lot of people building in Web3 today, they really forget the storage layer and from a marketing or comms standpoint they say we're decentralized. But at the end of the day if an AWS server goes down, everything that they build with it goes down as well. And that becomes even more important as you think about all the amazing dapps that host a lot of wallets and also critical information. So for us it really is actually building a network of really incredible partners and projects that are looking at different customers because we can't do it alone as a few companies. We really have a ton of companies building on top of us and that also includes new deep in companies. There's a company called WeatherXM that does distributed weather stations and they have even more accurate weather data than centralized providers because they're able to reach in areas where a traditional centralized weather station wouldn't be incentivized to put a station in. Great for kite surfers and people that like to be in more remote places.
00:22:25.576 - 00:22:49.750, Speaker C: But they're using filecoin to be able to store that data and then also rewarding users for being able to contribute really accurate weather information. So that's just one piece of the pie. But I think our go to market strategy is really empowering and getting a ton of really incredible startups from deep end to AI to traditional storage to really understand how to build on top of our stack.
00:22:50.890 - 00:23:31.232, Speaker D: I guess what I would say is for those that don't have quite the resources or ecosystem of protocol labs and filecoin business development is critical. And so that's founder led. It is out there and is building a business development team. You do not build it and they will come. Customers do not just wander into your deepin or L1 or whatever business you're building in Web3. They have to be found and sold to and onboarded and that is non stop effort and work. And I think the other thing I would add to that is that a lot of customers don't need to know that it's even Web3.
00:23:31.232 - 00:24:06.812, Speaker D: If your product is good, Web3 can run in the background, but that does not. That is not a compelling selling point for many customer segments. And so I think you'll see Deepin in particular scale without the crypto piece of it, without the web3 piece of it being a critical selling point that is kind of the enabler I think it doesn't work with without that. But that doesn't have to be a. You know, we have two pagers that don't even mention crypto and Web three for certain customer segments we talk to.
00:24:06.836 - 00:25:16.750, Speaker B: As an example to go briefly on top of that, BD for us is something we have to approach from a bit different perspectives because we're certainly building out both a supply side for AI agents where we as a company partner with agent creators, both professional, but we also want to, we are putting out the tools that make it really simple for any developer, really any community member come in and launch their own agent. And that's something that's coming with Fiori very soon. On the flip side, we have the agent consumers which is initially for us going to be Web3 audiences excited about use cases such as Web3 investments, interacting with projects like Fire Coin through an AI agent where we obviously have a strong partnership. But going forward, really our plan is going to be to be the leading AI agent ecosystem. And I don't think we want to be constrained to a Web3 audience. So it's certainly going to be the end goal for theoic to figure out how to engage probably perspective with any kind of audience that is out there that is interested in having an AI solve a task on their behalf. And we think that's really anybody out there in the world.
00:25:17.370 - 00:25:36.150, Speaker A: Great, great. And I just want to ask also like, do you see any new opportunities in the space right now? Especially when the token price is like rising right now? Do you think there are more people would be like joining to the space? Like how do they interact with this kind of decentralized technology platform?
00:25:39.700 - 00:26:20.790, Speaker D: Do you mean as users, as builders, the whole ecosystem like users? Yeah. I mean listen, money value is a powerful signal. So when Bitcoin goes up, you see searches increase. So as token prices go up, as alts rally, people wonder what's going on. They'll take a look, right? And so I think and you'll see ecosystems are heavily driven and influenced by price action. It's unfortunate, but it's just the reality. And so as you see prices increase, I expect to see use actually increase as well as that is a big billboard about what you're doing.
00:26:20.790 - 00:26:24.822, Speaker D: First people see the price go, what is it? Maybe I should buy, maybe. What do they actually do? Maybe I'll use it.
00:26:24.846 - 00:26:24.982, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:25.006 - 00:26:42.210, Speaker D: And that's. That starts a cycle, I hope, which will, you know, be more self sustaining than it was the last time around. I think we're much more mature as an industry with many more products or people ready for people to use and ready for companies and enterprises to adopt. So. But price will drive use.
00:26:42.990 - 00:27:16.816, Speaker C: Yeah, I wanted to double down on what Tom said earlier, which is a lot of us, we are not building in our areas for the price or for the token. We're building for the utility. I think that's what's so beautiful about the deepin industry is everyone really wants to fix a hard problem that is really hard to do when you don't have a decentralized network of infrastructure. And so for us, it's also really telling the story of what's possible. Right. And this week alone, you know, I've had great conversations with people talking about the possibility of decay proofs for securing elections. Right.
00:27:16.816 - 00:27:44.728, Speaker C: The ability for decentralized storage to give users a lot more autonomy over their. Over their data. And a lot of times these don't involve really leading with crypto at all. I mean, I think everything should be embedded within the experience. Most of the time, most people don't even know they're using decentralized storage. We're backing up the data on MIT Open Forceware. You can look at videos today and use a lot of our products in our ecosystem like you would at Dropbox.
00:27:44.728 - 00:28:19.860, Speaker C: And I don't think that's something that most people even see the crypto side of it because we're trying to make it so easy. And I think it's really important more than ever to just continue to build on usability because that's what's going to onboard the users, is making that experience easy and also making sure that we try to eliminate the scammy and bad actors that give crypto a really bad rep. Because a lot of times the general public just tends to fantasize on all these scandals as opposed to the serious things out there that really are groundbreaking.
00:28:20.520 - 00:29:03.650, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe going on top of that, I think usability is really key here. As a team, we don't really care about the short term price action and we're certainly building for the long term. We think agents are not something that's a trend. It's going to be defining generational, defining what we think is important. Important is that this new price action certainly is going to bring a lot of new users to the space. So it turns out you have to build the tools to make the user experience, improve the user experience, because the user experience, traditionally Web3 has not been the best. And it turns out that the AI agent is actually really good at providing a tool to sort of onboard and guide new users and help abstract a lot of the complexities that actually come with that.
00:29:03.650 - 00:29:39.930, Speaker B: So you. But that's been a focus for us as we see the price increase. It's certainly becoming more and more of focus as we see new users on board. And I guess the other thing I'd like to say is with a UX perspective or product perspective, we certainly also want to wow the new users that are coming in. Like users might be used to tools in Web2 that are like a ChatGPT or whatnot. We really want to provide an experience that's different so that people really see see, hey, this is something new and this is way more exciting to it than what the players that are out there at Web2 are actually offering me. And we're certainly making a lot of progress in that direction.
00:29:40.270 - 00:29:50.982, Speaker A: All right, thank you for the sharing. I want to ask do you have any exciting plans initiative that you want to share to the audience to just give our audience some others?
00:29:51.166 - 00:30:25.466, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just quickly going on top of that. We just launched our test a few weeks back, really seeing a lot of traction. One of the next things we're actually heavily working towards is launching a creator tool. Going to be a no code builder tool where AI agent interested parties where your community members can come in and really easily launch their own AI agent incorporating their own knowledge and sort of contributing into the ecosystem and at some point and I guess that's step two able to mon being able to monetize that that contribution of the agent we're launching and that's all coming very soon with Fjord. So we're super excited about that and continue to put traction.
00:30:25.658 - 00:31:27.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the three focus areas for us really this year, beyond a bunch of really incredible Filecoin L2s, all launching this fall, include specifically onboarding enterprise partners to us. We have an organization called the Decentralized Enterprise alliance where we're really trying to have traditional enterprises be on the roadmap. And I think compute and decentralized are very much part of that picture. To get traditional enterprises onboarded, that's going to be where most of the world's data is going to be stored in the future and driven by we also care obviously a lot about deepen and AI and there's also a few people in this room like Mark Mate that I just saw that they're all thinking about this and so if you're working in deep in AI and really want to drive the full sample to have decentralized storage of that layer, please come find me after and we also have a ton of information that is live streamed from our events. This week we did a partnership with CoinDesk LIVE so you can watch all of our footage and videos if you weren't able to catch it being there.
00:31:28.790 - 00:31:52.942, Speaker D: I think the most recent things we've announced is that our compute network platform is live. Staking is live as well. Staking is what security secures our network. And so we've onboard our second group of CPUs with stake that will scale over time. We started very small but are going to scale conservatively over time and we're also going to be adding support for GPUs as well. So I think those are. That's an exciting thing that's coming.
00:31:52.942 - 00:32:23.412, Speaker D: But I think what I would say here for everybody in this room is tomorrow we are hosting Deepin Day. This is our eighth Deepin Day. We've had about 2,000 people attend these over time. We'll probably have probably three to 500 people there tomorrow. So look at DependDay XYZ. Join us if you want to learn about Deepin. We will have you know Juan from Protocol Labs and filecoin will be there as well as many other leading projects.
00:32:23.412 - 00:32:27.636, Speaker D: So if you're interested in that, that's the event I would steer you to tomorrow.
00:32:27.828 - 00:32:32.130, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Tom for and David, thank you very much everyone for attending.
