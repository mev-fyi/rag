00:00:07.640 - 00:00:37.827, Speaker A: Welcome everyone to the depinned podcast. I'm your host Tom Trowbridge. I'm excited to have Robert Koschig with me from one KX who is going to dig into everything related to token economics. And we got to understand token economics. Well, if you want to understand Deepin, Deepin doesn't work without successful token economics. But Robert, before we get into that, first question I ask people is help us define Deepin. Because I've got lots of people have come up with slightly different definitions.
00:00:37.827 - 00:00:47.095, Speaker A: I want to make sure everyone is has their own chance to put their stamp on this pretty new term. So how would you, how would you characterize depend?
00:00:48.955 - 00:01:05.455, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty broad my mental models I was like it's anything where you need physical infrastructure and that could be server, could be sensor for use cases that is not operating a blockchain. This is where I would draw the line.
00:01:06.035 - 00:01:21.855, Speaker A: Fine, so would you agree then it would be crowdsourced physical infrastructure tied together by a common software layer, often with the crypto economics to provide incentives and trust.
00:01:22.865 - 00:01:23.953, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one way to put it.
00:01:23.969 - 00:01:51.765, Speaker A: Something like that. Great. So just making that out there, you'd be surprised how many groups out there, you know, different people are still kind of piecing together what it is. So let's dig in quickly to token economics. I know you've done a lot of research on it. Tell us kind of some of the research you've done, what you're working on, what you're finding in the sort of token economic space, which is a huge topic obviously.
00:01:52.685 - 00:03:03.253, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, right. My day to day work at one KX is helping our portfolio companies designing token models. But part of my research is focused on Deepin specifically because yeah, it's very, very interesting and also complex which makes it even more interesting. And yeah, I mean overall why deepen you have this flywheel of you know, supply allows usage, allows better UX drives the demand, demand needs more supply and then the wheel goes and it's all about how do you design incentives mechanisms to you know, kind of expose the flywheel? Because typically, you know, you need already quite a decent amount of supply to get the wheel going. And this is what it's what's about to also set it up in motion that is also sustainable. I guess that's the caveat would add because just getting a flywheel in motion is not too hard but you know, it's like burning up a fire.
00:03:03.253 - 00:03:16.305, Speaker B: You know, getting a fire burning up is not too hard but everybody who has a chamber or whatever, you know, you know that igniting it is easy, but then it needs to last as well.
00:03:16.685 - 00:04:02.185, Speaker A: Fair enough. And so with regard to that, what you're talking about, and I think we all are, is to have sustainable deep in ecosystems, you have to have this flywheel work for basically in perpetuity. And so I guess your point is, to phrase it slightly differently is you may be able to get people excited about a project and some token economics in the beginning, but for this to really work, it has to transition from initial excitement to actual use and actual utility and has to provide value in a way that is captured by the token in order to keep trust. And the economic kind of underpins the network functioning, right?
00:04:03.045 - 00:05:23.049, Speaker B: Yes, yes. And I would even add to that because that's. You ask about my research, right? We started originally to say, okay, you know, how do D pins reward their supply side typically? Because this is typically where it starts and how, how is this evolving into, you know, the network economics? And one aspect that came then as a second part is like, okay, once we understood, oh, this is the token emissions and how networks do that in practice and how things worked out, you see, you ask yourself, okay, especially when you know, you consider, I mean the supply side, this is setting up a sensor, setting up a server, operating compute, whatever, this typically has dollar based costs, right? It's similar to when you think about DEFI and the other use cases. It's dollar based cost because this is what you pay for your compute, power, bandwidth, whatever. And yet the rewards typically is in the token. And this already is obviously not the same and comes with discrepancies. So the second research piece was about understanding, okay, how much does it actually cost to run your deepen network? Because that actually should help you inform your reward mechanisms.
00:05:23.049 - 00:06:20.489, Speaker B: Like how much should you reward and when. Because again, if you, if you have something that costs $1,000 to operate and you pay the people $10,000 worth of your token, you will find people who will do that otherwise around if you just pay them 500, you probably won't. But how can you ensure because you know these deep, these network effects and this fly will still the work over multiple years. So how can you balance these things and set up mechanisms in place? You know, that you don't have somebody manually tweaking these things every day that they, that they last. And this is then, you know, once even if you figure out the rewards and the cost, there's still a third piece that you mentioned, right on like, okay, but obviously on the long run you want to have income and Demand that actually pays for the supply, so that token rewards can actually diminish. And yeah, these three large pieces is where I'm currently diving quite deep.
00:06:20.577 - 00:06:46.603, Speaker A: Well, listen, I want to dig into all of that because I think that's the core of everything here. And so first of all, I also highlight a problem. There's two problems we're trying to solve for one is if you're being paid in a token and the token goes down in value because of the project or the market, you may not be able to cover your cost, as you said, and that will reduce the supply of whatever that is in the network. It may impair the network's ability to function.
00:06:46.659 - 00:06:46.827, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:46.851 - 00:06:52.235, Speaker A: And that would then reduce people's interest in using the network and the whole thing has a negative consequence.
00:06:52.275 - 00:06:52.403, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:52.419 - 00:07:45.185, Speaker A: So totally grasp that. But the other problem, and this was highlighted to me by some miners in a particular project, is if the token is too valuable, you may attract a set of providers who have no interest in doing anything other than getting that token and not making the transition to the actual work, whatever that network is down the road. Because it's too easy to just collect this high value token, pay the small cost that they have, and you then attract the universe that isn't interested in actually doing the work of whatever that protocol, that deepen protocol is trying to do. So you kind of, you're not just protecting on the downside of not being able to cover your costs. If you have excessive rewards, you may have create other incentives and problems as well.
00:07:46.045 - 00:08:23.265, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, right. It works in both directions. And that's the why I'm very much leaning towards when you design incentives, first of all, you want to separate the roles, like what are people contributing to the network and what's the corresponding incentives. Because for example, if you provide storage, compute, power, whatever, it's one rule, right? There are other roles as well. Even if you separate just providing the infrastructure towards operating the infrastructure. For me, there's also two different roles. Again, if you later on put them together, a separate story.
00:08:23.265 - 00:09:04.331, Speaker B: But the point of these excesses is, I mean that happened. And then this comes back to the first piece on the reward structure, when you say when, when you, there's obviously never like a good or wrong token mechanism, how you reward emissions, you know, they all have a point. It's more like what you, what you're trying to achieve, but you just need to be aware. For example, if you go for this like Bitcoin approach to say, hey, before we launch the token, we just set the schedule, how we emit these tokens in perpetuity. It's known it will halve. And this is how it goes then this is how you emit the token. Then you are exposed to market fluctuation and speculations.
00:09:04.331 - 00:09:28.815, Speaker B: And then we saw 20, 21, right. A lot of the token prices just moved a lot. Are we filecoin? And that obviously all of a sudden made the margins for operators so immensely intense. Right. I mean it's insane. If you look at the data filecoin, right. There was a month where filecoin miners got dollars unlocked to have investing but you know, unlocked technically if you convert that to dollars, it was more than a billion.
00:09:28.815 - 00:10:31.325, Speaker B: And yes, running a miner, a storage provider for pycon is costly. And back then it was even more costlier, but it probably wasn't even half a billion. And it also shows you this kind of like the complexity of the whole thing because now that we had the bear market, you talk to a lot of protocols and all of a sudden they see the need to be more cost efficient. They discuss in the communities and they figure out, oh, if you knew it this in this way we can save costs. So these excesses also make, you know, make it very inefficient to run the network. And you as a protocol, you want to find ways to say, well yes, currently we have the money to basically incentivize this cost of operations, but are there ways to basically get it down? And it's insane. I mean ficoin, they introduced a couple of things that got cost down by 90% for ceiling, for example.
00:10:31.325 - 00:10:58.081, Speaker B: But there's other, well, Pocket also like great innovations and if you talk to them, also over 90% cost reductions. Ideally it doesn't need a bear market for you as protocol to tackle these things. I guess that's the whole point of considering your reward mechanism together with the cost of operating your network. And yeah, that's why the second piece on cost came in to basically help understand what is actually the cost to run a deep in.
00:10:58.273 - 00:11:50.155, Speaker A: And how do you think about protocols that reset the rewards? Right. I believe filecoin, the one you mentioned, those rewards are I think set on a schedule that decline, if I'm correct. But you look at something like arweave, I believe that those rewards actually recalibrate based on a target amount of storage available in the network. I think with the view that if storage grows by a certain amount or below a certain amount, more AR we've is needed. If it grows by too much, less AR we've is needed. So while it's not an actual link to fiat necessarily. There is sort of supply demand response that impacts the token amount paid for storage to kind of try to have a relationship with pricing.
00:11:51.295 - 00:12:22.687, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean it is actually also filecoin I think what you're referring to because they have two mechanisms and that's a little bit confusing. They have the called simple base minting which is the Bitcoin approaches, you know, big gains. But then they have these target baseline that they call this exponential storage target where they say okay, if we have supply above that we, you know the, the, the, the incentive is basically capped at that level. Right. And, and there's also something they hit. Right.
00:12:22.687 - 00:13:22.515, Speaker B: And this is a little bit to, to adjust for it. But again this is also, I mean it limits the rewards on the token basis which is also good, good enough incentive. Right. This is a good mechanism but still doesn't capture the whole cost component for your storage provider. But maybe to be fair also talking on filecoin I think there it's also a little bit tricky because exactly what I mentioned earlier, knowing the roles and what you reward them for. But it sounds so simple to say well filecoin storage provider just need to provide this storage and then all the compute on top. It's costly but operating that why would you earn so many millions? They in the same time also are the ones that operate basically what we call accounting layer kind of like the blockchain.
00:13:22.515 - 00:13:35.259, Speaker B: So you have one entity having several walls roles. And I think that's a little bit why it's also tough to calibrate kind of like the incentive models. Plus I mean it's also early so.
00:13:35.427 - 00:14:11.897, Speaker A: Well I know I understood on the baseline targets there. I think the ARI reward though adjusts every several blocks based on storage. But we don't need to get into the super details. But it's not. But it's a more fluid adjustment I believe. But and the other but different. Taking the conversation slightly differently, we're talking with filecoin in particular about you know, purpose built generally professional data center miners.
00:14:11.897 - 00:14:21.779, Speaker A: Right. That have cost, they invest serious money infrastructure. There is a whole other ecosystem of depin which is more retail based.
00:14:21.937 - 00:14:22.231, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:22.263 - 00:14:39.895, Speaker A: Whether you're talking about a helium or you're talking about Hive Mapper or maybe others you can think of and are those, you know, retail historically doesn't have as good a grasp on their costs. There may be.
00:14:39.935 - 00:14:40.111, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:40.143 - 00:15:01.055, Speaker A: And so how do you think about. Is it just about meeting a minimum amount that matters or minimum amount that allows you to set it up right. Like how does that does that lead to. If you're, if you're thinking about attracting infrastructure, professional infrastructure versus a retail world, those may be different, kind of drive different economic decisions.
00:15:02.675 - 00:16:02.315, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I mean that makes my life as a researcher hard because it is exactly that you don't know who's running these networks. Right? I mean all you can see on chain is like oh, there's 3,000 storage provider on Pycoin, there's 15,000 nodes on Pocket. I mean Pocket is maybe a bad example because there at least you can see, okay, it's actually just 150 operators and then you can even see how many nodes each operator has. But this is often not even that is known. And even there, I mean you can just like imply that okay, obviously if you run a couple thousand nodes on Pocket, you probably are not the hobbyist that just has one node or whatever. But yeah, this is the interesting piece that you have the components of running nodes which typically is just like okay, cost for the hardware, cost for bandwidth, power, other opex.
00:16:02.315 - 00:16:15.235, Speaker B: But then even when you tackle labor for example as an additional cost component, the data center guy, he probably has a full time DevOps person or somebody checking the racks, exchanging slots versus.
00:16:17.635 - 00:16:17.923, Speaker A: The.
00:16:17.939 - 00:17:02.811, Speaker B: Guys who just enjoy having up there the antenna on the rooftop or putting it somewhere in the wild. I mean they will not track an account. Oh, this was five hours to get there and set it up. I spent this many. You know they don't do this accounting and I guess that's also the benefit of deep ins. On the other hand that you would say yeah, you know they, they like what they're doing. They just do it as a hobby and still support it and still are happy to earn something aside, which I guess is general a very bullish case on, on, on those more retail focused deep ins in, in EV Denver for example, I, I met various Uber drivers who had the high F camera and they're just like well I make money with Uber but this H thing comes on top.
00:17:02.811 - 00:17:32.253, Speaker B: And then some of them even had demo right for the car data. And this is I guess exactly how also the networks themselves can basically think about the remote emissions of like okay, if I anyway already, if they're anyway already doing it, I probably don't need to incentivize so much. It's really more about okay, hypermobile, right. You need this device and probably you want to attract them in a way that they know okay, this will have amortization over this in this amount of time.
00:17:32.429 - 00:18:09.845, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't have to be much, but it has to be enough to sort of, let's just say, get them out of bed to do it, so to speak. Right. Like gotta have enough to actually go with the, to the mental effort of buying, installing, setting up whatever it is. That's the sort of activation energy. Once it's up. It may take very little going forward, but there you could even think of a system that had high rewards just based on the first month or two or whatever it was, with a view that after that the rewards could fall dramatically because it was sort of more effort to uninstall it, frankly, than to keep it going.
00:18:10.665 - 00:19:02.405, Speaker B: Yeah, and this is again coming back to the whole tokenomics. I mean, tokenomics itself is like a unfortunately very overloaded term, but the mechanism designed to basically also say, okay, you attract them, but how do you also make sure that these guys kind of like keep doing it and kind of like don't just chase the. Oh, there's hyper, for example, Natix, like competitor doing similar things. And then they just do this like, you know, how do you, how do you also attract the community and grow and sustain the community? Right. This is, this is the piece where I'm coming back to my initial fire analog to say, well, igniting it is one thing. You really also want to have a plan how you keep momentum and sustain it and the extra hard challenges like do that also throughout the bear market.
00:19:02.595 - 00:19:02.945, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:02.985 - 00:19:05.145, Speaker B: And when you have time for that, you're good.
00:19:05.265 - 00:19:36.331, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all, that's all you got to do. But what I think about there is that the democratization of these networks is terrific because what you're sort of talking about is built the right way. Early users earn tokens and participate in the growth of that network, which should be represented in the token price, if that's designed appropriately. Right. So it's as if you're an early seller on Amazon. All you get in Amazon is higher fees and higher prices over time as it grows.
00:19:36.363 - 00:19:36.507, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:36.531 - 00:20:32.925, Speaker A: As a seller, you share in nothing. But here as a provider, you earn tokens which if it works, should become more and more valuable over time. And so theoretically you have an installed base who own tokens, you hope, who will have an incentive for your network to grow and become this community and won't just hop to the next thing if they keep. But the point is, I guess what you're getting at is there has to be a path for that growth and for token appreciation, which gets to the next point of how do you transition from this emission supply Side incentives to actual paying customers. And I'm going to guess filecoin is the farthest along in that journey. But I'm curious if you have others that have more paying customers that are starting to transition away from just a pure token emission kind of reward comment on the supply side.
00:20:35.625 - 00:21:21.935, Speaker B: Yeah, it's for sure the very, you know, that leads into the third part of our research because it's also very, very tricky to see how would you even measure like farthest along. Because I mean Pycon for sure there's you know, a good, good, good amount of revenue. But again, right. Like you, you part of that is also incentivize with filecoin plus and these types of things and a very competitive pricing and yeah, right. For me the part here is to say okay, for sure the demand side is for me the biggest. You know, we are the least mature here because typically people think about okay, stable supply first. It needs to be reliable, which makes sense.
00:21:21.935 - 00:22:14.011, Speaker B: Right? And then this is where rewards and things focus first. But not so much is actually happening on the demand side even like because if you consider defi again as a comparable people get incentivized if you go to a perp to trade and things because the networks know, yeah, every trade still pays a fee. I mean we give them this guy's back but eventually it'll pay off because the guys also enjoy doing it, using it and have that. Now for Deepins the use case is unfortunately not trading where you can just like pull that one off. But this is stuff which I would like to see even more right. To say okay, because it's a different role. It's the whole, I mean traditional businesses have whole sales department to basically say use our product.
00:22:14.011 - 00:22:43.265, Speaker B: Right. This is what you get. And if you look through Deepins right now, again it totally makes sense. They focus on stabilizing supply first. But the demand side typically is very much evangelized or driven by still like founder or founder, like close to founder entities. Right. If you could look at the broadcasting and live peer for example other deals like demo selling the data.
00:22:43.265 - 00:23:36.525, Speaker B: It's also like again I would say it's right now mostly driven where we are at the, at the process. But when I think about the mechanism design like okay, how can this work over like a 5, 10 year horizon? This is a step where I feel like a lot of them need to push more to also make sure that the network is thriving by also making sure the supply side is still aligned. For example, Akashes is a good example where they've they just recently put aside kind of like a budget to actually drive and incentivize demand as well. And there were quite some discussions around that as well. Yeah. Because I guess it's never easy to again adjust and distribute rewards and incentives because at one point people might even be like, oh, this was our budget. Right.
00:23:36.525 - 00:23:55.453, Speaker B: We just say it's not about years or hours. Right. At the end of the day, coming back, you want to create this community, this one piece to say, hey, if we get the supply, the demand up even further. Obviously you as a supply provider, you also get more. Right. It's not just like that. We take away your rewards and you.
00:23:55.469 - 00:23:58.705, Speaker A: Will and your rewards should be worth more that you already have.
00:23:59.325 - 00:24:02.573, Speaker B: Exactly right. Because you get token and demand drives.
00:24:02.749 - 00:24:36.155, Speaker A: Eventually if it's designed. Right. I mean, listen, I agree with that and it's kind of funny because we're in this, in the sector of technologists who like building tech and that is the core strength of like everyone building all these deep in systems, guess what? Isn't BD and sales. Right. That is that. And so people optimize for what their strengths are. And so getting supply side, getting the tech working, getting all that stuff is the, is the, is the, is the default, you know, first order agenda, which it should be.
00:24:36.155 - 00:25:17.785, Speaker A: But building up a sales department, building up all that, that's also hard. And that is, you know, I've seen that, you know, that obviously is an issue is also because you know, that also requires organizations, requires teams, requires incentives. You know, all this stuff which is, you know, is, is sort of part and parcel of legacy companies, which is protocol designers. We sort of wanted to not partake in. Like the whole concept here is let's build protocols that work and operate and so we don't have to be burdened by the infrastructure of legacy companies. Right. That's kind of the idea.
00:25:17.785 - 00:26:03.865, Speaker A: And the whole thing of Deepin is we've got all this infrastructure, this network that works. And so you don't need to have a business because it's decentralized, but the problem is you got to get the businesses are competing with you on the sales side. So you've got to go build these BD departments. Listen and influence. That's something that we're very cognizant of, is the need to have team out there talking to customers and bringing people on and explaining it because it doesn't happen by itself because people are competing with you. People don't just shift and so recognize that. Do you see though, in the projects you're looking at a.
00:26:03.865 - 00:26:33.785, Speaker A: Is it as thought out the durable monetization engine is just less mature in terms of adoption but the actual economics are sustainable and viable. It just will take a bit longer for that to scale. But the economics are they as kind of focused on as the kind of supply reward side of the equation.
00:26:36.405 - 00:28:22.585, Speaker B: I mean it's for sure top of mind, right that people obviously know that they're building something to be used. So like okay, who are our customers? And at least the one once I talk to they can at least tell we talk to these guys and these guys, I think they even want that even integrate with other solutions that make integration even easier or adoption so to speak with regards to like how thought out that thing is typically not so much because it's very much like a trial and error type type of area, right? Because it's. I mean you can look at storage or GPU which I would argue has been around for the longest and where you have like the biggest networks and even there you just look at the prices. I mean I think Masari puts it out every now and then, right? Is say oh what's F storage compared to cloud? What's GPU compared to other things? And it's always way magnitude is even cheaper. Well then actually if you studied economics efficient market versus everybody should use that supply, demand, price, why not? And then you realize well it's probably because there are things about just usability integration. Like if I'm a traditional business and I need compute AI, how do I integrate with Akash and all these other networks, you know that there's some gaps I think we still need to close. And I feel like a lot of this is stuff that's on the good side that applies to basically all of them.
00:28:22.585 - 00:28:47.429, Speaker B: So it's kind of like you can even think about a joint effort like I mean think about just fiat payments, right? That you know this burden of like I'm not a crypto. Like I have a business, I run AI models, I train them, I need gpu. Typically I just have AWS or whatever GCP to pay them with my credit card. I can't do that typically when I go to crypto.
00:28:47.557 - 00:29:08.951, Speaker A: So that's the thing we're adding fluence make we're doing a credit card front end right away. That is something we think is important. I mean ideally the way I think about this is Deepin networks for the customers shouldn't even know it's using a Deepin network. It shouldn't even be like I fluently we have a One pager. It doesn't mention crypto or blockchain at all.
00:29:09.103 - 00:29:09.391, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:09.423 - 00:29:19.235, Speaker A: Like if these networks are efficient, that's. That's how you could theoretically scale this, I would think. But you're right, you've got to, you have to be in that mindset of the customer oriented mindset.
00:29:19.855 - 00:29:32.847, Speaker B: Exactly. And there's even change solution. Right. Solana I think has something built on top that like a third party that kind of like provides that and you as a deep end on Solana can just like then integrate with those and don't need to build it yourself. That was my point.
00:29:32.871 - 00:29:33.007, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:33.031 - 00:30:14.777, Speaker B: It's just like not every protocol, at least when you're running on some shared blockchain, you know 1L2 it needs to build it out themselves that there should be solutions that kind of like provide that for everybody because they have the same, same, same problem. But then there's probably still like very specific needs. I mean for example storage. When you think about enterprise solutions, there's always like as a business regulations about data protection, privacy. If you're running Europe versus js, it's just very complicated to then say like yeah, I do that now on this like decentralized network where I don't even know who's running this thing God knows where. And oh yeah, that's funky mas. It guarantees me that's correct.
00:30:14.777 - 00:30:34.707, Speaker B: I tell that my regulator that there's mass that makes sure it is. Right. This is still some challenges that yeah I think is the is causing these gaps of. It's not. It can't be just the price. Let's put it this way, right. It would be just the price.
00:30:34.707 - 00:30:36.707, Speaker B: We would have way more traction.
00:30:36.811 - 00:31:03.585, Speaker A: And I mean what you're effectively says it's not. These services are not as commoditized as it may sound. So whether it's computer storage, it sounds like oh price per terabyte, price per you know, core month, whatever. Like it's not that simple. There's actually a much more complexity in delivering that service than that commoditized then that price would let you believe. And that's what I think we're discovering. Right?
00:31:04.325 - 00:31:39.517, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And maybe also as a side component like little detail here, when you talk about you pay for service, I mean yes, it shows you like okay, you need to pay like five tokens whatsoever. But there's transaction fees on the chain as well. Right. And then it also is a little bit of like these cloud providers. I mean why are they successful? It's just like they attract you with like free Usage, you know, you get AWS credits whatsoever. And then at one point as you scale, they just say we have everything.
00:31:39.517 - 00:32:03.841, Speaker B: We have the machine learning models, we have this, we have this, we have pipelines. You never need to leave the system. And actually if you want to leave the system. Oh yeah, oh, Getting the data off is konikaze super much. And then the people just like, okay, then you know, they're locked in. Right. And in deep in these solutions we, I mean we might have means to attract them.
00:32:03.841 - 00:32:22.995, Speaker B: Even if we solve, you know, for this on rent and you know, commoditize and have things under the hood and still we're far away from like similar dynamics where people are just like, okay, once I'm in, I basically have everything I need and it's click of a button. Similar to how you would scale up down on aws.
00:32:23.115 - 00:33:06.879, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, and that's that. But you're talking there about very cloud based stuff, storage, compute, et cetera. That's different than like the helium Hive Mapper, you know, GLOW is doing solar. Right. The network, the deep in ecosystem. There's even deep in Deep in Uber for example, like the range of infrastructure being used expands beyond the cloud stuff, which is what you and I are most knowledgeable on, I guess. But there is, there is, there may be a chance that the big adoption comes from one of those, other, you know, uses versus the cloud replacements.
00:33:06.879 - 00:33:08.515, Speaker A: At least, at least at some point.
00:33:09.295 - 00:33:34.617, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I mean, you're right. Right. Like this is the part where I see this, I mean, right. Physical resource networks like those where you need to spit up the sensor or an antenna or something like that. These guys for sure, I mean here in mobile seems for example to have good traction because people realize, oh, you know, it's easy to use. Right. Because they, I mean, yes, right.
00:33:34.617 - 00:34:22.129, Speaker B: Cooperated with T Mobile, I guess. And then it's just like you don't need to worry about am I connected to some helium node or do I use the other one? I just have signal, I have data and I pay my five bucks or 20 bucks, whatever. This is like, you know, comparably cheap. So this is the piece where you see like yeah, it can work on the, on the demand side. Yeah, it's just still something where I would say, what I want to say is like the cool thing about these networks is even they might even have a nice connection between supply and demand. Because the supply guys, if I run an antenna, obviously I tell my friends, I'm like, I have this antenna, it asks me this and this amount and here I have the phone. So basically I'm not paying because I earned something, I spent something on the network.
00:34:22.129 - 00:34:46.869, Speaker B: It's nice. And then the other guys are like okay, what do I need to do? They have the same and they just say well just spend these dollars on the. I mean 5G antennas might not be the best example because they're expensive. But IoT there are network that probably give you the same story on a cheaper way. But this evangelism flywheel probably works nice for these three.
00:34:46.917 - 00:35:13.985, Speaker A: It's super relevant when you can have retail crowdsource infrastructure that are also your potential users and if you can have those can overlap, that's great. But Robert, let's back up for a second because we've dug into this in a lot of detail but can you talk first introduce people to one KX which is you know, one of the leading venture seed firms in the space and then then a little bit about yourself.
00:35:15.165 - 00:36:09.235, Speaker B: Yeah, so. So 1Kx been around since 2018 to former entrepreneurs that founded it, Chris and Lasse. Cool, cool guys and early stage typically type 1 type of investments that that we do. I'm personally not so much involved in like making the investments decision. Luckily I'm one part of the team back office type of person. Right where you say okay once we invested in protocols we help you for example in my case with token design, setting up the incentives, thinking about all things, you know, token launch or incentive mechanisms. But then there's also other team you know, obviously legal or you need to hire people or you need to list your token on exchanges like all these like when you run your protocol, when you build your sort of startup.
00:36:09.235 - 00:36:25.035, Speaker B: Obviously typically you're a small team because this is where we invest and how can we help you to you know graph grow fast and no need to hire like for each of these things you need like hire a different person because then you're probably running out of your funds quite, quite quickly.
00:36:25.695 - 00:36:59.145, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the way 1kx seeded fluence so I, you know and I'm in particular for quite a while but I guess the benefit of having a established large firm is exactly the resources of somebody like you or specialized in particular area in our resource for portfolio companies as our other members of the team in the different verticals you mentioned. But what about you? Where were you before 1kx? How did you get into the whole space? What was your journey to. To where you are right now?
00:36:59.925 - 00:37:56.493, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah it was a long journey. So way back in the days I studied Mars and finance and then also you know, did back then what probably a lot of people did, like you know, coded up an app and try to build up a startup in Berlin. After that didn't turn out to be like a huge success story. We I just went to different ways where you go when you study math and finance, which is banking, you know, traditional consulting, these types of routes and then from there went over to. Yeah, right. Also more like the zeitgeist, E commerce, data science, making up all these nice algorithms and to scale up these businesses and Yeah, I think 2018 was the last station before one KX where I was actually leading the LL department back then. Right.
00:37:56.493 - 00:38:03.389, Speaker B: I mean it was only just the grasp transition from these traditional word to back models to the more current.
00:38:03.517 - 00:38:11.425, Speaker A: You're small models, you're a small universe of people that knew what LLM was back then. I mean that is, you were, you were early.
00:38:12.085 - 00:38:49.351, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I still remember when we went through like Ernie and Bert and all these like different Sesame Street Google Papers person. You're just like what am I doing here? But then yeah, 2021, 2022 officially I joined one KX. I every now and then also would look into, you know, because with data science, you know, you're used to all these like agent based modelers, modeling simulations. Plus with a finance background, right. In Defi summer and Defi summer was what hooked me up personally with the crypto space. I'm like oh this is interesting, you can, you can do stuff and it's super, super interesting.
00:38:49.351 - 00:39:10.023, Speaker B: And yeah, that dragged me into the space. And then officially 2022 I joined YKX and yeah ever since basically do that with portfolio companies and my research, right to kind of like apply help simulations, help mechanism design, help economics, help dive into the defi space, these type of things.
00:39:10.199 - 00:39:35.005, Speaker A: And if given I guess your focus on both token economics, working with founders, you know, any experiences you call on in particular on your background that were super helpful whether it's regarding crypto or this particular space. I mean anything from your either your education or your previous positions that you are really thankful that you had or have proven to be useful and helpful.
00:39:37.625 - 00:40:35.323, Speaker B: I mean there's several ones. I guess the latest station, right the LMM data science that turned out to be a coincidence. And it's like okay, I mean back then you saw how useful it was in practice and you dug into the first principle foundational mechanisms. I have not have seen how quickly this now with ChatGPT became a thing and now even enters crypto for full steam ahead and it obviously helps then you know, when you talk to modulus for example. Right. I mean combining DK proofs, this LMMS and machine learning models, it obviously helps a lot. Once when you went through that learning years ago to understand the different models and what's easier or harder to circuitize and then how impactful it is when you know okay, they make circuit for like a 1.5
00:40:35.323 - 00:40:51.695, Speaker B: billion LMM parameter. LMM. Yeah, that's for sure. I would say very helpful right now. But obviously overall studying math or being able to calculate and solving equations always helps.
00:40:52.435 - 00:41:11.325, Speaker A: And what about the incentives? Because a whole bunch of your focus now is thinking about rewards and incentives. Does that come from math or does that you think about that from previous experiences, startups or how do you. Where does that kind of behavioral I guess piece come from?
00:41:11.985 - 00:42:14.425, Speaker B: Yeah, this, this you're right. I mean I one time before doing the LMM stuff I did pricing and this is of course very, very much deep and dig into also like all sorts of like you understanding your users and this is a cool thing about the E commerce space right. You have this super transparent view but how are your users reacting more like mechanically elasticities like these types of content. You understand the data, you understand the marketing side as well. Like okay how is retention working, how the different marketing channels work, customer acquisitions like all these things that each and every protocol also need to figure out because at the end of the day a lot of incentives talking about demand side as well is customer acquisition. And I mean we're for sure not as advanced at these E commerce web two players are in terms of knowing exactly. Oh I put this advertisement on TV back then and this is how much this incoming revenue can be attributed.
00:42:14.425 - 00:43:06.817, Speaker B: But I guess we're getting where eventually. So yeah just, just, just knowing this helped a lot to also yeah just understanding the mechanisms beyond pure, you know, math beyond pure like okay, I do this and then this because you know the whole behavioral economics spectrum, for example, knowing that people. Yeah. You know, have, have all these different kind of like irrational behaviors that you could kind of like address with certain, with certain ways you, you design your incentives and also you communicate your incentive. I guess that's also something not to be forgotten right. Like that a lot of also it's like how when and how you roll out these your incentive programs. Yeah.
00:43:06.841 - 00:43:47.955, Speaker A: And how you and how you articulate that obviously makes, makes you know is a. It's really interesting point. And what about things. You know normally ask this of people more on the entrepreneur side but for you I Ask you slightly differently, what mistakes have you seen projects make? We see successes. Those are 100 reasons and things to look at. On success side, the mistakes are usually harder to see or fade away pretty fast. So anything you see, whether it's entrepreneurs or projects, in terms of mistakes made that you'd caution or call out to warn people about.
00:43:50.535 - 00:44:40.561, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's obviously you can do more mistakes. You can get things easier, wrong than right. I would say maybe one common pattern that applies basically to everybody is really the kind of like every now and then kind of like reprioritize or like revisit, like where you focus on or where you're actually marching towards and doing this. Being aware of where you typically focus on. Because I mean, we all love to do what we're good at. So coming back to what you mentioned earlier, typically founders are tech oriented, you know, very much like, oh, I can, I can improve that, make them more efficient, you know, make, make that even, even better. And then all the other engineers will look at it and like, wow, this is like insanely good.
00:44:40.561 - 00:45:00.177, Speaker B: Whereas you're like, well, this is good if you're, you know, CTO of a company and then. Or engineering focused. But if you CEO and if you need to build a business, obviously there's other departments that you need to take care of as well. And just being aware that this is. There are blind spots. Right. I'm the same mass finance.
00:45:00.177 - 00:45:50.147, Speaker B: I always have this lens on. So whenever there are topics coming up where I just like, well, I don't know that I can give you my opinion, but probably you should ask somebody who has at least a different lens or like a lens that fits that question and be like constantly making yourself aware that, you know, this is where you lack attention and, you know, tokenomics is for sure, something like that. Like, I don't many of these earlier stage, basically none of those early stage protocols have like a guy who's like, yeah, I'm the guy who, I'm purely focused on token stuff. I'll build that myself. Right. Because frankly, why would you need them in the founding team? Right. They are important later on.
00:45:50.147 - 00:46:22.225, Speaker B: But just being aware that, okay, at one point you need to get those guys in and you need to get those guys in not two weeks before you want to launch a token. Because there's lots of things to think about to get it right. Yeah, I mean, this was a very token focused answer, but it applies to others as well. Like speedy, you know, sales, marketing. Yeah. Just know your blind spots. I mean, I guess that's really good for any type of founder and entrepreneur in general.
00:46:22.345 - 00:46:56.025, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the way I think about that is if you have multiple founders, ideally they each have different areas of expertise that helps reduce your blind spots. If you've got three serious tech founders, that's, you know, not, not as helpful. But I, but I, I, I, I certainly grasp that. Any, any deep in projects in particular you're excited about now or any problems that aren't solved, you see being solved anything, whether it's a project by name or a subsector that you're excited about.
00:46:57.745 - 00:48:09.987, Speaker B: I mean, the one problem where I'm getting more and more excited is the whole notion about, you know, verify verification. Because we talked about a lot of, you know, somebody needs to provide compute storage, set up a sensor or solar panel or whatever. But how? And then, you know, they get rewarded when it's used. But a lot of this is also just like it needs to be there, it needs to be available, capacity needs to be there. Because when it's used, obviously you can easily track that it was there and it's been used. But for compute, for example, you want to provide customers like yeah, you can run, spin up this super extensive algorithm here because we have the compute available, but then there's not like how can you ensure that service providers, how I would call them like service nodes that just say yeah, I have something, I have a sensor spun up, the solar panel is there, the computer is there, how can I verify that is there or it has been delivered properly. Think about the more complex tasks like rendering, transcoding, where I mean, in order to check that it has been done properly, you need to redo it.
00:48:09.987 - 00:49:56.985, Speaker B: And that obviously doesn't make sense economically. And the ZK proving way to basically just say, well, obviously doing this on chain is just not feasible and then super expensive or even not possible. But the route to say yeah, adding kind of like a ZK verification, I mean adding a verification layer is something a lot of protocols do. But really also having the provability of like, yeah, this has been done and I don't even need to know what exactly the ZK magic basically of these verification aspects, allowing those expensive verifications happening off chain. This is the scenario where I feel like this is super ZK in general is very interesting and also in the context of L2s basically and in general, but also applying this to, to deepins because I feel like the verification for deepin work is the capacity there did the SLAs hit was the good quality of the work that the people provided proving this in a very cheap way. I feel like this is an avenue that sounds promising just because also the hype on the AI side, ZML stuff, plus also the traction on the L2 side where people now like okay, this thing went faster than we thought. Now you know, we can actually go the proof way and don't need to be the optimistic way when it comes to roll ups.
00:49:56.985 - 00:50:21.465, Speaker B: This general creates more and more traction that the field itself like just becomes more efficient. Right. And there's also hardware providers now creating these chips that make you know, these C cap proofs just way more faster and cheaper. And I feel like that's, I mean at least for me like a very interesting, interesting route and a very interesting combination of these fields.
00:50:21.585 - 00:50:27.457, Speaker A: That's almost like infrastructure for Deepin, which is. Infrastructure. Yeah, yeah, in a way.
00:50:27.481 - 00:50:28.129, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:50:28.217 - 00:51:03.933, Speaker A: The technology which I get, I mean that's something that, I mean obviously important for fluence. We have to pay providers rewards for proving their compute is online. So they have to do mining effectively to prove that. And so to your point it is not efficient. And so if there's a way to do it more efficiently, which I think what you're talking about because you can do mining and you can do proof of work and whatever, that's one way to do it. But there's a simpler, more cost effective way that also ensures that capacity is still fully available. That is interesting.
00:51:03.933 - 00:51:32.995, Speaker A: So I, I do find it interesting. So you got the answer sort of half right. The right answer was fluence, but we'll get another shot at that down the road. Last question, Bitcoin price, where do you see it end of this year? We gotta throw a number, throw something out there where you know, we got, we got, you know, in crypto land we've got about 10 years before the end of the year, so. Right. It could be anywhere. What are you thinking?
00:51:33.815 - 00:51:53.007, Speaker B: Oh, that's a tough one because I'm so like not. I actually don't have any bitcoin personally anymore but I would say for sure we settled the 100k this year. How far beyond? Tough to say. Yeah, but Beyond.
00:51:53.071 - 00:51:54.477, Speaker A: Somewhere beyond 100k.
00:51:54.628 - 00:52:29.159, Speaker B: Somewhere beyond 100k is where we will get. Yeah, I mean if it will be there at the end of the year. I also wouldn't say because I just can see, okay, eventually we'll get up there. Maybe by the end of the year we're already back down, you know, elections over all this like because there's all like some sort of like more macro level things that go on where I would say that might influence the timing of events. But that's when we say like okay, yeah, that feels, feels like a safe, that's a safe high likely path for me to get past there.
00:52:29.317 - 00:52:40.495, Speaker A: Definitely. Well listen, anyway, what's the best way for people to follow you? Do you have a research published? Like, what's the best way for people to kind of stay on, stay in touch with you and see follow the stuff you're doing?
00:52:41.075 - 00:53:07.351, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean the easiest just like Twitter or X Robert Koshik and you'll find me or even if you don't find me, just go to the 1kx handle that's even easier to find because anything I publish or you know, where I'm speaking or whatever, I'll just share it there as well. So this the one spot and from there you'll see the links where to find find more.
00:53:07.543 - 00:53:15.535, Speaker A: Fantastic. Well, listen, it's been great having you. Thank you for. Thanks so much for joining. Thank you. This is Robert from 1K.
