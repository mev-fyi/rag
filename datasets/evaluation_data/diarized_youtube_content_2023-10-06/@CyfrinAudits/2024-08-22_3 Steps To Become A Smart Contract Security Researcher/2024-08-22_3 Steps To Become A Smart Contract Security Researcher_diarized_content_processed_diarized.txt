00:00:00.520 - 00:00:39.719, Speaker A: These are the steps to becoming a smart contract security researcher. Step one take a course. Cypher and updraft has over 30 hours of security curriculum in addition to development curriculum including fuzzing assembly, formal verification and how to write your first smart contract audit or security report. Step 2 Get experience on competitive auditing platforms. Competitive audits are where you actually compete against other people at finding bugs in a short amount of time. The Codox platform makes this even easier with the first flights, which are easier audits for newer auditors and security researchers. Then jump into actual competitive audits where you can actually gain money and climb the leaderboard to prove that you know what you're talking about.
00:00:39.719 - 00:00:56.435, Speaker A: Step 3 Inhale security research content. You should be on solid every day reading, researching and learning about the latest and greatest reports. As you build your reputation on these competitive audit platforms, you can start applying for jobs, going for bug bounties, become a solo auditor or just keep competing and that's it.
