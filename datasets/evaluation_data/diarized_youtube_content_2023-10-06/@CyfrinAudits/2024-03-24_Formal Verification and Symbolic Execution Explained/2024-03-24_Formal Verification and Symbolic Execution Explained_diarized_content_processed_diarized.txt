00:00:00.160 - 00:00:40.194, Speaker A: Formal verification is a generic term for applying formal methods Fm to verify the correctness of hardware or software. We're going to be learning about formal verification much later in the course because its use case is often very specific. Applying formal methods often just means converting the code base to math and using mathematical proofs to prove that the code does something or doesn't do something. One of the most popular types of formal verification is going to be symbolic execution, which basically takes your solidity function and turns it into math, or a set of boolean expressions. Mat, Manticore, sertora, z three. These are all tools in the symbolic execution and formal verification space.
