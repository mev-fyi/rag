00:00:00.200 - 00:00:42.206, Speaker A: First. Then I would pass the floor to Rafael, who is supporting me here today. Thanks a lot. Because I'm going to cover mainly the EU, the megaport and the Liechtenstein part, which is a part of EEA. And Rafael would cover swiss part of regulatory considerations for, let's say, major defi features, which you know. So these are us beautiful crypto team of Lindemann law from in Zurich, actually. But I've been working.
00:00:42.206 - 00:01:25.154, Speaker A: Both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have three masters. My second master in law, third master in general at the University of Lucerne. I've been working at the law firm in Liechtenstein and now also joined as partner, Lindemann law from January. Did you introduce yourself or would you? Okay. When you do your part, you definitely can do it. We always do the disclaimer that this is not a legal consultation, by all means, especially in regard to defi, because this is really in a gray area. A lot of features are in a gray area, and we will tell you why and we move on.
00:01:25.154 - 00:01:49.004, Speaker A: Do you see? Oh, that's. That's bad, because I see the definition, but you do not see it on the screen. Okay, well, that. This is a good point to ask a question, guys. What. What do you understand under Defi? Are you somehow involved? Are you it people? Developers? Okay, that's good. The rest is academia.
00:01:49.004 - 00:02:01.260, Speaker A: Academia. That's great. That's great. Economics, law. Okay, good, good. So very diversified background. That's good.
00:02:01.260 - 00:02:29.104, Speaker A: Are you somehow involved with Defi? Have you heard anything about it? You are involved. Could you tell us what you understand about it, how you would define it? There is no definition by all means of DeFi. But that's good. That's good. We're going to talk today about custodial and non custodial approach, especially for staking. That's good already. Maybe I could.
00:02:29.104 - 00:02:58.192, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what we have here. I guess it is. There is no, like standard definition. There is bunch of features, or let's say technical applications involved, which are covered by DeFi, but in general, it is where the centralized intermediary is. No more there. And most of the users interact peer to peer, which has both advantages and disadvantages. And the.
00:02:58.192 - 00:03:43.854, Speaker A: Okay, we have straightforward the regulatory landscape in Switzerland. What are the features of defi that you know, the applications of defi that you know? Any examples? Staking. Do any of you stake any of the assets? Okay, that's already looks nice. We would ask those people when we talk about staking, they will explain us how it looks from a technical perspective. Maybe liquidity pools yield farming. Okay, looks nice. We also have some people to ask so that they could give us a technical perspective, maybe, or at least their perspective.
00:03:43.854 - 00:04:41.184, Speaker A: Okay, what do we have else? We have all of those peer to peer transactions. And the thing is that there is no KYc or IML checks done, which is also problematic because we mostly have to identify people which do something on platforms and with their crypto assets, both in Switzerland and on Amica. Okay. So most problematic are, in general, and this has been under major discussion in Switzerland and also in EU, staking those liquidity pools, which could be also seen as staking those liquidity pools yield, farming, investment dows are also really problematic. So let's just dive into the swiss part of it, and then I'll continue with the EU part.
00:04:42.884 - 00:06:06.724, Speaker B: Thank you very much, Janina. So maybe I'll just give a very brief outline of the crypto regulatory landscape in Switzerland. So, as you all may know, Switzerland has been one of the early adopters when it comes to blockchain regulation, means that the swiss regulator, the swiss financial Market supervisory authority, FINMA, has been rather open to crypto projects and also wanted to establish regulatory clarity in this respect. So that's why we had already in February 2018 the so called ICO guidelines. The ICO guidelines was a paper where Finbar says, listen, we assume this to be the general rules applicable when it comes to crypto related projects, only for our own authority. For FInba, there were the applicable principles, but also in particular, the token categories. This is very important when it comes to any kind of project, is always either a payment token, asset token, which is deemed a security, or a neutrality token.
00:06:06.724 - 00:07:06.046, Speaker B: Finma has an approach where it says it can be one of these categories, but it also can be a hybrid token. And most of the tokens have certain functionalities of these different categories of tokens, which leads them to the applicability of a different set of rules which applies to each of these token categories. They also outlined the AmLA duties, which is mostly when a payment token is involved, or a token has kind of a payment function. We'll dig into it on the next slide. No, no, wait, wait. Maybe just here, just. The fintech license was then another milestone where Finma, or where there was the legislature, really established a new license, particularly for fintech companies.
00:07:06.046 - 00:08:26.350, Speaker B: I think it was also one of the first worldwide known specific categories from financial market regulation for fintech, particularly designed for fintech companies, although it's not yet widely used. I think we have currently five companies following under this fintech license, and the sandbox exemption is kind of a mean to collect funds without triggering a banking license for crypto related projects? No, no, just the last. Then I think the biggest milestone in all these was then the so called DLT act. Distributed ledger act. It's actually no act, it's a framework regulation where the swiss legislature amended, like Switzerland had a different approach, for instance, to Liechtenstein. In Liechtenstein, they implemented the first worldwide token regulation with a private law and also public law provisions, where they said, yeah, this is token law. This is a new set of law.
00:08:26.350 - 00:09:13.068, Speaker B: That's a new category of law. Switzerland, however, decided on a completely different approach and said, we don't need this. We have a very solid legal background. We just need we make a gap analysis and decide on which specific laws need to be adopted to find legal clarity with respect to certain new issues raised by blockchain technology. And that's why they amended ten existing federal laws. And I think the most important part is we have ledger based securities, meaning a security can be a security of a share of a fund. It used to be on a paper.
00:09:13.068 - 00:10:00.584, Speaker B: So I hand it over to you, you're now the owner. And then it was evolved over time. There were central depositories who made the change of the shares. And now Switzerland provides legal security that the change of ownership can also be done on ledger based securities, which could have been assumed somehow. But they said also regulatory clarity. What needs to be done or what needs to be met towards the ledger based system used to provide sufficient security to be officially the registry of the shares, bonds, or whatsoever any kind of claim you can have. So that's the first point.
00:10:00.584 - 00:10:48.388, Speaker B: The ledger based securities, they also implemented the DLT trading facility. That's a new license category. It's not maybe, you know, like an exchange, an exchange in Switzerland, we have only Zurich, also six, and we have be, which is the very, very, very smaller brother sister of six for SME companies, who wants to get funds. And then you have trading facilities, OTC trading facilities. And this is a specific license category which the swiss regulator implemented only for DLT securities. Bless you. Which is not yet widely used.
00:10:48.388 - 00:11:33.024, Speaker B: Neither. I think there is maybe one or two, or not sure whether there is yet one, but there's not widely used yet, and which is very important when it comes to defi. So Switzerland implemented regulatory clarity with respect to the segregation of crypto assets with depository, because the segregation of crypto assets. If I give my ten francs to Janina, the legal law assumes that she commingled the assets and she's now the owner. I have only a claim against her. And if I give her my cryptocurrencies, then maybe have a right of segregation in case Janina goes bankrupt. So this is the ground of this.
00:11:33.024 - 00:12:18.056, Speaker B: And maybe now we can go to the next one. Yeah, exactly. So these are the ICO guidelines and utility token. It's really easy, it just provides an utility. A pure governance token can be a pure utility token. As I mentioned at the very beginning, tokens are usually classified as hybrid tokens, meaning they meet more than one of these categories, with the consequence that more of one of these rules which are triggered by the token classification of one of these categories is applicable. So security, it has the same if it's deemed a security.
00:12:18.056 - 00:13:16.518, Speaker B: If I have a claim against somebody, then there is actually no new law in Switzerland applicable because the existing laws applying to securities is then applicable to Finfrog, Finsaw and Finja. These are the english abbreviations for these laws. And the payment token. A payment token. The swiss regulator said that bitcoin and Ethereum are both payment tokens, although from a technical perspective, ethereum does, in my view, not only have a payment function, but they deem the native token ease as a payment token. Yeah. So at the very beginning, maybe I want to interact with a little bit more.
00:13:16.518 - 00:13:37.684, Speaker B: I was, I do not want to hold a monologue, maybe give me examples. Or does somebody of you has already made some experience with any kind of DeFi protocols? Do you want to all of you.
00:13:43.164 - 00:13:46.628, Speaker C: Like this token which you can use for voting?
00:13:46.756 - 00:14:49.618, Speaker B: Yes. So, but what do you do with the token? So you give it to a liquidity pool, or do you do. Yeah, it's a DAO. Yeah. If you have a governance token, then if you give, for instance, in a liquidity protocol, we'll get into it later. You give your tokens which you have to the protocol, and you receive in return so called vault tokens, which give you also the right to vote on the governance of the specific protocol, but also gives you a part of the procedure, which they gain in a predefined way. And so this, what you then do is just a utility.
00:14:49.618 - 00:15:14.684, Speaker B: You can vote there on this daO. The DAO is kind of the legal founding of most DeFi protocols, because you need to have somebody running the entire system. Usually you have a centralized party in defi protocols. You usually don't have decentralized, but a decentralized organization.
00:15:20.704 - 00:15:38.084, Speaker A: Of daos. But most of the classifications that I see are investment daos, community daos, service daos. Right. So if this is a utility token for governance, most likely it is a utility. This is a short answer.
00:15:47.944 - 00:16:56.520, Speaker B: This is what I said at the very beginning, that most tokens are classified not in one category. So I was talking with the former sole legal counsel at bitcoin Swiss of the year 1718. He did a lot of token classification back then when these ICO guidelines were the sole ones. And most tokens do have a utility, but he hasn't seen yet a pure utility token. So when he classified a lot of them, and most of the crypto geeks that just come and say, yeah, you know, this is a utility token. But then he said, yeah, it is a utility token, but it has also maybe other functions as you now just described. And if you gain, if you get a return dividend, then it's by law defined as a security token, and you need to meet all the normal, normal regulatory requirements, which is actually the exact same system which is applicable in Switzerland and in the EEA with Mika.
00:16:56.520 - 00:17:08.304, Speaker B: Mika only regulates non security tokens, because for the security tokens, they have already with MifiD, a current very stable applicable legal framework.
00:17:10.884 - 00:18:00.578, Speaker A: Just for clarification. I mean, this is a difficult concept for Sunday morning, but everything with this somehow has a return. Not in utility tokens, but fiat or crypto can be classified as security. And the consequences are, you have to follow the rules which normal security issuers follow. Own issuance is not really licensing, but rather registration of a prospectus. If you target retail investors, normally a lot of projects in a private placement, they either use agreements for future tokens and they also use the exemptions that target mostly qualified investors. Minimum hundred k denomination, a minimum 100k thresh holds up to 8 million in Switzerland.
00:18:00.578 - 00:18:09.082, Speaker A: Crowdfunding exemption up to, I don't know, from one to 8 million in different EEA countries. This is a practical approach to it.
00:18:09.218 - 00:18:53.952, Speaker B: So that's exactly the prospectus. The prospectus requirement is one of the key things which you need to meet. If it's a security token, and if it's not a security token, you need to make a so called private placement memorandum, which is, I just explained it as a light version of a prospectus. You just need for investor protection reason make a huge disclaimer of a couple of pages and outline the project in as much detail as possible. So this is a very burdensome barrier for issuance of tokens with the security component, maybe into the staking saga in.
00:18:53.968 - 00:19:04.284, Speaker A: Switzerland, because it is really like a saga. It started last. Am I loud enough? No, I think I can manage it. Michael, do you hear me?
00:19:04.584 - 00:19:06.004, Speaker B: Okay, very good.
00:19:06.944 - 00:19:07.936, Speaker D: That's good.
00:19:08.120 - 00:19:37.388, Speaker A: This has been really saga. Like, I really, I really watched it with popcorn, like every month. It started last autumn. Oh, sorry. I've already been spoiling the story, give the word to you, because this has been really real saga of how the regulator wanted to treat staking in proportionally and then what the community did to reach a great result for all of us. Okay. Exactly.
00:19:37.388 - 00:19:39.772, Speaker A: Exactly. But the floor is yours.
00:19:39.908 - 00:20:21.456, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Yeah. As mentioned before, we had this regulatory clarity implemented by the so called DLT act, which also implemented a couple of, like, they amended existing laws. And I think the two most important with respect to segregation of crypto assets, there are in the bankruptcy law and in the banking law. Yeah. So this is now the solution which was issued by, if you just Google Finma unstaking, the first Google result will be FInMA guideline on staking.
00:20:21.456 - 00:22:08.212, Speaker B: And this is maybe on page, I don't know, four or five, but it was quite the road to get there. So, as said, with the implementation of the DLT act, they provided legal certainty with respect to when, for instance, if I give, if I have, or like, this is always applicable for custodial staking, meaning you stake via bitcoin, Swiss via bitpanda, via any kind of custodian, then it's the question when. In what, in case the custodian goes bankrupt, when the assets will be segregated? Or do I only have a claim against the. Against the custodian in case of bankruptcy, towards the bankrupt state? So if the custodian, he has individual custody, meaning segregated on chain, then of course, you're still the owner of these assets in the moment of bankruptcy. If it's a collective custody with clear customer shares, they call it, they say, yes, they still have a segregation. So maybe I've been working with Cepo, newly amino, and with signum, and I can tell you how this is done, usually is you pool the assets, basically on the wallet, and you have an internal log file. Which assets are whom? Janina has maybe 1.5
00:22:08.212 - 00:22:47.404, Speaker B: bitcoin, I have 1.3 bitcoin, and so forth. And this is in the internal banking system, or in the internal system, however you want to call it. You don't need the banking license to provide staking services in Switzerland, then this is segregatable in the case of bankruptcy, of the custodian. Yeah. Next. So there is exactly a very similar regulation for banking for financial institutions.
00:22:47.404 - 00:23:39.662, Speaker B: And there comes the fintech license into play. If you're a licensed. If you're licensed institution, you have, in case you do not have clear customer shares. If you do not have this internal log file, then as said, then you have you commingle the assets with your own, and then it's deemed to be a deposit, which triggers a banking license, which is quite expensive. But anyways, I think this is not really important because there are very few banks providing staking services. It's mostly, anyways, delegated staking. So these custodians do not provide the note themselves for the staking services.
00:23:39.662 - 00:24:14.978, Speaker B: They just forward the assets towards a staking service provider. And then you enter into a staking agreement where all the risks and so forth are outlined and the assets are transferred. Actually transferred to the node. Yeah. And maybe just accounting law treatment, which has also to do with the segregation of acids. So you need to hold the, like it has a. If you do.
00:24:14.978 - 00:25:47.970, Speaker B: If you do hold the assets on the balance sheet, this might have quite severe consequences. And as I said, if you have as a custodian, this internal log file, where I just explicitly mention at any time what kind of assets a specific client holds there is aggregatable, and you do not need to hold them on balance sheet, which is quite important, which would have had quite severe consequences for all big swiss players. Maybe the reason why this was so critically discussed is having, like the law, provides for the requirement that the assets are available at all times. And what means at all times? If you have an unlocking period of a certain days, which you usually have with staking protocols, then the Finma said, yeah, yeah, but you don't have it available at all times. You need to wait in a predefined period. But then the swiss blockchain Federation and all swiss crypto valley and so forth, they all say, yeah, that's true, but in this very moment where you unblock, you still have the exact same technical. It's technically.
00:25:47.970 - 00:26:28.596, Speaker B: It's already. No, it's technically not yet unblocked, but you will get the funds within a predefined period of time. So it is available, although not immediately. And then the regulator made a new turn and exactly established this guideline last December. So this was quite uncertain last year and would have led to quite severe consequences for swiss crypto custodians. Yeah, legal consequences, that's fine. No, no, I think if.
00:26:28.596 - 00:26:31.224, Speaker B: Do you have any kind of questions? Yes.
00:26:36.144 - 00:26:43.680, Speaker C: There was new comment about how do they treat the rewards, how much wacc you have to charge with?
00:26:43.712 - 00:26:46.816, Speaker B: How much do we charge back or.
00:26:46.840 - 00:26:48.024, Speaker E: Not on the rewards?
00:26:48.184 - 00:28:09.662, Speaker B: Aha. VAT. No, you do not charge VAT. You just need to declare it, from a tax perspective, as gains from capital, which on the swiss law, if you're not a professional investor, if you're a private investor, is actually tax free, and there is no VAT applicable to gains from capital, so there is no VAT according to swiss law, and it's actually tax exempt if you're deemed a private investor, if you have your own investment strategy, you're spending maybe four to 8 hours for investing each week, then you might be deemed a professional investor. This is not a clear line. And then you would need to pay income tax on the revenues, in particular on the staking rewards. In this case, yes, of course.
00:28:09.662 - 00:28:54.070, Speaker B: Yeah. No, they're taking a commission on it. Yes. Which is mostly in a part, I would say, up to 1015 percent of the staking rewards. It's the cut that these intermediaries, let's call them intermediaries, blockchain intermediaries, they use themselves as commission to provide. But as you know, for ethereum staking, you need 32 ETH and or a specific multiplied factor thereof and exactly this amount. So it's better to pool, to pool the assets and also to.
00:28:54.070 - 00:30:07.336, Speaker B: Yeah. So who's the owner? Yes and no. Maybe if you're giving ease to bitcoin Swiss and bitcoin Swiss is giving it to the node, which is the validator nodes, on a proof of stake blockchain, then the funds are actually with bitcoin Swiss, you're still owner, but they're blocked, but the ownership remains with you. The ownership remains with you, but the risk of being slashed slash is when you get. When the validator node does not, didn't do the right thing on the blockchain, then your funds are gone. If they do the right thing on the blockchain and the validation process, the consensus mechanism, then you get rewards. So you bear all that risk.
00:30:07.336 - 00:30:25.004, Speaker B: The tokens are factually, actually with bitcoin Swiss, but you bear the risk of the which, which is actually by the validator nodes. Does this answer more or less? No. No.
00:30:25.764 - 00:30:33.404, Speaker D: At which point did you take a cup? There's like some point, how do you.
00:30:33.444 - 00:31:26.056, Speaker B: Change the ownership to have not the ownership, only the possession? There's a difference between ownership and possession. If I give, as I said at the very beginning, this is a legal fiction. If I give $10 here from my wallet, €50, I give it to Janina. If she takes it, it's a legal fiction that she's the owner of it. She's possessing it currently, and she's the owner of it with cryptocurrencies you have another legal fiction, as I tried to outline before. If I give her crypto assets, and it's still segregatable, even if it's in her wallet, but she has an internal log file. Well, it says, rafael gave me on what is for it at 1204 0.3
00:31:26.056 - 00:31:50.904, Speaker B: bitcoin, then it's still segregatable, and that's why I'm still the owner of it. I do not have a claim against her in case she gets bankrupt. I just say. I go and say, hey, listen, this 0.3 bitcoin on this wallet is mine. I sent it then, and the liquidator would give them directly back to me. So that's like, I will stay the owner thereof.
00:31:50.904 - 00:32:21.394, Speaker B: I'm not the owner of a revenue there I have a claim there I have a claim because it's uncertain, and only in the event that the custodian gets the revenues in this moment, this triggers a claim from me against the custodian. This is usually contractually also agreed, but this is how they. Because this is how it is usually done.
00:32:39.514 - 00:32:55.914, Speaker E: After some revenue is generated, they put some of the revenue in the small contract. After it rises above a certain threshold, the smart contract autonomously, basically buys back some native tokens and burns them.
00:32:55.954 - 00:32:56.562, Speaker A: Right?
00:32:56.738 - 00:33:04.734, Speaker E: And so would it make a difference from a security perspective if instead of buying direct tokens autonomously from smart contracts?
00:33:11.054 - 00:33:49.380, Speaker B: That's a very good question. Does it have a regulatory implication if they burn or they just. Yeah, yeah, of course. I do think from a regulatory perspective, it would have, it should be treated the same. It has more an economical consideration behind that. Exactly what you said before, that you raise the amount of tokens which have been issued, and by this gaining more, I don't know, it's not market value.
00:33:49.452 - 00:34:34.372, Speaker A: But as always, two lawyers have different opinions. I have a different opinion on that. It depends a lot also on the legal structuring and how the regulators would see it. The economic sense may be the same, but sometimes the legal structuring also changes the regulatory qualification. If they do not promise, let's say payback in case of burn. Because if you promise that you're very close to banking license, and I think there was all of the icos, this was enviant case, I think the most severe one was the Nvidia case, when they promised to buy back, then it's very close to banking license. But if they do not promise it by do it factually, this is a little bit in the gray area.
00:34:34.372 - 00:34:47.464, Speaker A: This is not so clear. But if they would have promised directly dividends. This is definitely security or even collective investment scheme, but share in a collective investment scheme unit in a collective scheme, it's also security.
00:34:48.884 - 00:35:48.096, Speaker B: Yeah, I think now after taking this into account, like you said, the stablecoin die or which. Yeah, I think if they would hold it there, it's a payment token, most likely, although it's a smart contract payment token, not fully backed by physical funds. It's a payment token. And purely payment token would just trigger AML duties and no brokerage license. If you would have exactly the same with a security token, then it would definitely be a brokerage license, which would then be needed from their perspective as the provider. Yeah, definitely not. No, no, no.
00:35:48.096 - 00:37:33.222, Speaker B: We will get to it. Like the legal, like this is all for centralized institutions, and here we have a decentralized institution. So to become, for instance, let us, because I think we're running a little bit. Yeah, I will maybe adjust liquidity pool. So what's really important for you to know is maybe this entire financial market regulation always assumes that you have a legal person in a specific specific country, a centralized person, a natural person like me and you, or a legal entity, which then needs to be domiciled in Switzerland and get all these licenses in case you have a decentralized organization behind the decentralized protocol, there is no actual person who should be in charge of the license. Do you know what I mean? Like, that's a little bit like who against, who should Finma start an enforcement proceeding? If you have maybe only a foundation in Switzerland which provides technical services for only technical services for a protocol which is decentralized on specific nodes and, and the nodes themselves, they vote on the governance. So this is a little bit the gap between how it works on the blockchain versus how the regulator stipulate or the legislator stipulates, that it's always one person in a specific country providing a specific service.
00:37:33.222 - 00:37:36.954, Speaker B: If this answer your questions to a certain extent.
00:37:38.994 - 00:37:41.694, Speaker A: Do we want to talk about liquidity pools?
00:37:42.274 - 00:37:45.114, Speaker B: I think Mika is not. So do you want to go into.
00:37:45.154 - 00:38:40.986, Speaker A: No, I would just. I would just add my two cent on Mika regulation, which regulates mainly the stable coins, emani tokens backed by fiat currencies or set of them asset reference tokens. Most of the stable coins will qualify either as emoney tokens or as asset reference tokens. And Mika is already there from this summer and then from the end of the year also for so called cusps, crypto asset services providers. And this is mainly for the centralized services providers. They are discussing right now at the EU level, also the regulation for DeFi, it is a lot under discussion, especially staking under Mika, staking is not really regulated, but you always have to keep in mind law is always behind the economic and technological development, which is try to catch up. And sometimes the regulators in alloys are more or less successful.
00:38:40.986 - 00:39:12.158, Speaker A: Then we adopt a proportionate regulation which fosters the innovation and at the same time provides the stability of the market somehow. But sometimes we're not really fortunate with this approach. The regulators are not really fortunate. And also there is a lot under discussion how native staking would be regulated. Those done with protocols in all of the yield farming will be regulated. We will see, I think by the end of the year, what will be the approach of EU regulators. This said about staking.
00:39:12.158 - 00:39:55.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes, it will be. Liechtenstein is EA European economic Area, which is extended EU. And we have to implement technically the EU regulations into national law. But the Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, FodG has been already adopted, at least partially towards Mika, which means we are supposed to have a smoother transition period than other countries which have not adopted also national legislations towards it. So in general, staking under mica not really regulated. A part of staking of asset reference tokens emis, it is directly prohibited to provide interest on it.
00:39:55.200 - 00:40:26.384, Speaker A: Otherwise it is just not regulated. It is in a gray area. And we'll see by the end of the year how the regulation would, would look like for staking. And another feature we wanted to discuss with you is, are the liquidity pools, the yield farming? You deal with it. You also, could you describe how it looks like from technical perspective, yield farming, what you do, how you, how you do it technically? Yeah, sure, sure. Go ahead.
00:40:27.944 - 00:41:41.044, Speaker E: Centralized exchanges, you have an order book that you have buyers and sellers. Once the price of the buyer and seller needs, you only get triggered and there's an exchange using liquidity pools. That's not how it works. We don't have an order book and if there are order book decentralized exchanges, but liquidity pools, as we know, for example, uniswap, it does have basically, it's a smart contract where you have usually two tokens, token a and token b, and some basic function x y equals k or something like that. The price of the tokens are basically defined relative to each other. And anyone can basically call into the smarter contract with the security pool, put token a into the pool and take out the equivalent of token b, which is defined by the equation of token a and token b. The price in the pool, you put in token a set of token b or bicycle.
00:41:43.744 - 00:41:51.720, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very good description. Why would you use a liquidity pool? Just what is the economic incentive behind it?
00:41:51.912 - 00:42:17.572, Speaker E: Well, for liquidity providers, they get the fees, of course, of traders, maybe 0.2% or 0.3%, depends on how small content is sell. And for someone that wants to swap tokens, maybe they don't trust finance or some centralized exchange or. Yeah, it's basically just a decentralized version of another point.
00:42:17.628 - 00:42:46.084, Speaker C: To use liquidity foods is more like a price discovery mechanism, because currently what you do with order book is you always find a buyer or seller for your product, where in aim you don't like an automated market maker. Other word for liquidity foods, it's like you don't need another party. You directly get to the vault where you exchange at a particular rate. The price is already discovered for you at that moment of time. That's where the advantage comes with amms or any liquidity.
00:42:47.024 - 00:43:12.084, Speaker A: Yes, that's what I have seen a lot in cases of our clients, that they use it for utility or let's say non security tokens. They use liquidity pools as a way of price discovery, to boost the market price of the token and then to be able to offer it with more attractive conditions to the buyers, to the purchases. Would you dive in into the regulatory considerations of those liquidity pools?
00:43:14.844 - 00:44:05.184, Speaker D: But at the end, it's like you provide capital, you can, everyone can like have provide capital from liquidity pool. So it's not trading, you give your capital, and because there's like a risk that you lose capital if the price like changes up, so you get, you need a reward for that, the fee. Normally the fee is too low to, to get enough, it's not enough for the risk you take. So normally many projects get paid on top, like project tokens. So you make 30% like income on top, the trading fee, because you pay for the risk you take with the capital. And always you won't do it because it's like too risky that you lose half of your money or it's not an investment anymore. Shares normally higher than the.
00:44:08.884 - 00:44:18.092, Speaker A: Great input stack, to give the full picture of how it works from technical and economic perspective. What is the regulator perspective?
00:44:18.148 - 00:45:21.820, Speaker B: Yeah, the regulatory perspective is slightly different. Like I think the most important part in this respect is the collective investment scheme schemes, or it is a fund. When it is. What is a fund? It's the same actually, more or less in Europe under the IFMD and the CISA, the swiss collective Investment Schemes act. So always if you give money, if you pool assets together and you have a common investment strategy and somebody manage these assets, which could be also most likely the smart contract, then it's deemed a collective investment scheme, a fund. So tokens can of course be the can parts, can be parts of collective investment schemes. Because I said, even if you have an utility token, a pure utility token, you have a certain right attached there too, which might for somebody have a certain value.
00:45:21.820 - 00:46:19.896, Speaker B: With payment tokens and security tokens, it's clear that they have a value. So if you pool them together, this is pooling of assets, which is the same as pooling. So USD, swiss francs, euros, whatever. And usually you deposit assets with the custodian for a collective investment scheme. So the custodian of a collective investment scheme does nothing else than just execute the orders from the fund manager. So can a smart contract substitute a custodian? And I do think, yes, you know, because at the end of the day, just the smart contracts, it substitutes not only the custodian, it also, the protocol substitutes also the fund manager. As said before, when the interratio between or like the actions, they are already predefined.
00:46:19.896 - 00:47:54.300, Speaker B: Of course, you do not have the possibility. You cannot program the smart contract in a way to cover all eventualities, which you actually should be perfect. But in my view, this is already sufficient, or could be sufficient to meet, to have the same decisions as a fund manager at the end. So when it comes to yield farming, I don't know, world contract is like, you give this amount of XYZ tokens and you receive in return another token which represents a claim towards the proceeds, the proceeds of this liquidity, of this pool of tokens, where you provided it to, of course, also gains. And on top, you might receive another token, or, which is, which might then also be implemented into this token. Depending on the specific setup, the strategy contract is kind of the smart contract predefined investment strategy, when to invest into what? So I think this is, in my view, from a pure legal perspective, could already been triggering a license as a collective investment scheme, which has quite severe consequences. Yeah, this is maybe one back.
00:47:54.300 - 00:48:33.842, Speaker B: Yeah, one back, yeah. Liquidity pool. Yeah. So I tried to explain it at the very before. I think what's very important is that this laws only apply if a specific person in a specific jurisdiction wants to implement it. The thing behind the decentraland finance is that it's accessible, that it's decentralized, and that it's transparent, secure. So the real difference between all these financial markets law, which we try to outline a little bit.
00:48:33.842 - 00:49:33.024, Speaker B: And the real world in DeFi protocols is that you do not have a person reliable for a specific protocol at the end of the day. So you cannot ask somebody to say, listen, you need to adhere to this and that rule, because behind all these protocols is usually a decentralized organization. And if it's properly set up, then you do not have somebody able to get any kind of license, therefore. So this is why this works also in practice, without meeting all these license requirements which we outlined before. And if they have a license, maybe in a specific country. But when it comes to cross border applicable regulations, you need to meet investor protection is always for a specific, specific area of law. For a specific area.
00:49:33.024 - 00:50:28.642, Speaker B: For instance, for the EEA, you have the EEA guidelines, either the direct applicable or for Switzerland, you have swiss law. If an organization has some part of company somewhere in the Caribbean and they provide services of Switzerland also Switzerland would be applicable, but it cannot be enforced against somebody in a caribbean country. They would need to file a support claim towards that authority and this and that. So this is quite rather cumbersome also in the today's globalized world. So you see the reality is here and the legal setup is still behind. Very much behind. Yeah, that's a flip side.
00:50:28.642 - 00:51:43.644, Speaker B: Maybe if there's a fraud, FTX, it just wasn't too long ago, of course, there were just, this was a Ponzi scheme at the end of the day and how this worked, of course, they have, like in this specific case, they had also specific approval from a Caribbean, let's call it banana republic. And at the end of the day, in this intransparent structure, you, you could not know what would actually, even the own accountants of FTX didn't know because it was decided on a very high level. And this was all fictive entries in these books. So you see, if you're not regulated, the flip side, if you're part of a fraud, you have just no way to get this kind of information, or you're, I don't know, really well networked, and you get all this topic, top secret information, which is, as a normal investor, rather unlikely. Yeah, that's a very good flip side comment, I think. Anyway, for this.
00:51:45.704 - 00:52:19.256, Speaker A: Is also the EU perspective, just as Rafael said, in most of the countries, liquidity pools are quite close to the collective investment scheme. Though again, two lawyers might have different opinions. In EU blockchain observatory, we see that liquidity pools do not have a predefined investment strategy. This is subject to be discussed. This is subject to interpretation by lawyers. Regulators are also lawyers just in regulating organizations. So it is still in the gray area.
00:52:19.256 - 00:53:06.286, Speaker A: And it is discussed by the EU regulators whether and how this this would be regulated. That's why the practical approach is that some daos are run without any legal structure, both running dups with liquidity pools and those also running investment daos. Because investment daos are in most of the cases even closer to collective investment scheme than the liquidity pools. Again, all in gray area. I guess we discussed the staking under Mikhayim techinists right now. Yeah, because. Yeah, we discussed briefly already staking and Amika.
00:53:06.286 - 00:53:46.166, Speaker A: So let's just move on with your question. My answer, yeah, I did a full presentation on it and we're also working on an article for third countries access under Mika. The thing is, Switzerland is not part of the EU. It has bilateral agreements with EU, which most of the people are not really aware of. And it doesn't have unrestricted access to european markets. It has access to european markets under exemptions. Under MifID, for example, which regulates mainly securities and an Amica.
00:53:46.166 - 00:54:30.584, Speaker A: There are even less or almost no exemptions for third country providers. Which means from economic perspective, Switzerland has a great opportunity window. And right now it has to redefine its USP's to be still attractive for a lot of projects. Because once you would like to provide to be a Casp crypto asset service provider, like depository exchange, transmission, asset management, etc. Etcetera to people in Eu, you need to have a presence in EU or EEa. And that's why some of the providers which has been there and which would like to be regulated in EU share, let's say their staff in both Switzerland and Liechtenstein, for example.
00:54:31.924 - 00:55:24.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what's very important is like the reverse solicitation approach, which is actually by all banking, by all kind of financial institutions already applied. And now there was ESMO guideline on what means reverse solicitation. Now with implementation of Mika Miko director Esma gave more clearance in the Mika for the first time in really in a directive mentioned what is exactly a reverse solicitation. And it's really narrow reverse solicitation. If an EU based client comes to a swiss based crypto asset service provider on his own and exclusive initiative, there is no license requirement. However, if you want as a swiss participant, actively solicit. Actively market actively.
00:55:24.954 - 00:56:38.854, Speaker B: What is active meaning making a post on LinkedIn, which can be reposted by everyone, can be already considered by ESMO as an active solicitation so it's a rather thin line, it's a rather unclear line, with the consequence that you need to provide a specific. If you want to solicit clients in the EEA, which is the EU plus Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland, you need to have a physical presence in one of those countries with, depending on each regulator, predefined substance. And this is where Liechtenstein comes into play, because Liechtenstein is rather smooth. The regulator is rather easygoing and rather collaborative. And you can do split office with Switzerland, which you cannot do, for instance, with Bafin, which you cannot do with FMA in France, which you cannot do with most of other regulators. So this is why this setup, Switzerland and small Switzerland, Liechtenstein is a really good combination and we still have quite some good flexibility when it comes into a crypto project. We have also very good connection there with the regulator and are often in contact with them.
