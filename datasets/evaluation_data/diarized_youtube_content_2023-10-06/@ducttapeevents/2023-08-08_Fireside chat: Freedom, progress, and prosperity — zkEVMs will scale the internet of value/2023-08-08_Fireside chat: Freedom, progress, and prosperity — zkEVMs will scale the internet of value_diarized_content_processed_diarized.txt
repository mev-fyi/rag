00:00:00.320 - 00:00:36.974, Speaker A: I stay in Prague, the larger I'm getting. Such good food. Well, Alex, thanks so much for taking the time. Very excited for our chat. I think one interesting place to begin because I think most of the folks in the audience have an understanding of what Matterlabs does and the role and importance of ZK in this industry and this ecosystem. Maybe walk us through the origin story and the core values that sort of underpin a firm that's based and rooted in technology, but maybe don't have anything to do with technology. I'm thinking freedom in particular, of course.
00:00:37.054 - 00:01:14.152, Speaker B: So the origin of mitralabs because with my personal story, I was born in Ukraine, I grew up there. I moved to Germany when I was twelve or 20 or something in Ukraine. I grew up in the period right after the collapse of Soviet Union and I experienced firsthand the transformation of society in the lack of institutions and authorities. They kind of still have power, but they are not performing the functions anymore and they prevent people from actually being able to perform the functions. The crime is rampant. I had hyperinflation for two years. I still remember it.
00:01:14.152 - 00:01:54.984, Speaker B: I was a small kid and then I moved to Germany and I experienced a very different society and also people, immigrants from Ukraine, from Russia, from eastern Europe, doing much, much better. Once the rules of the game are changed and something is different and the very same people do much better. And I get very curious, like, what is that? And I started learning more and more about how society is organized. I started as a programmer. I always was passionate about programming. I was part of ukrainian national team at IOI International Olympic informatics. I really liked the solving complex problems.
00:01:54.984 - 00:02:45.736, Speaker B: Then I became a team lead. Then I grew to a CTO. I was CTO in a couple of companies and I could see how the way you organize cooperation affects the productivity and the overall results. And the more I learned about the way you organize things, like on a local level, at the team, on the global level, at a nation bigger than nation. The more I grew to appreciate the idea of freedom, like as this fundamental key that enables you, like everyone in society as a whole, to really get the maximum out of your potential because freedom leads to a lot more motivation. Like compared. Like, you have two different organizations.
00:02:45.736 - 00:03:28.984, Speaker B: One is prescribed, like every single thing. Like, you're micromanaged. You're told what to do with everything. Like, think North Korea, where people are literally just being told every day what to do, where to move, what you like. Everything is completely organized. How big is motivation there versus more free country, but where you work in a big corporation where everything is kind of, your impact is minimal and you have a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of rules, versus a small startup where everyone, like, things are totally chaotic, but you feel a lot of responsibility and you have a freedom because no one else has time to manage you. Everyone is busy with their own things.
00:03:28.984 - 00:04:49.062, Speaker B: The motivation, the outcomes, the learning curve is going to be tremendously different. This works at a national or societal level, either the same way. And like we're here at parallel Nepolis, the Institute of Crypto Anarchy, which is deeply inspired by the works of austrian economists, by this libertarian classical liberalism school of thought, which is a heterodox school of thought, which is like it's going in the opposite direction of what the mainstream economics and political science is doing for a reason, because the mainstream school is heavily influenced by the state and has state sponsored and obviously certain ideas have more right to thrive there than in this free part of academia and intellectual world. So it works the same ways. When I started reading the libertarian and austrian economist authors, my world perception just like changed from. It just went upside down. I was like, what? This is really how it gives you a very interesting perspective on how the entire society is organized from a point of view of a single individual.
00:04:49.062 - 00:05:40.980, Speaker B: You have these choices a and b, what are you going to choose? In choice a, let's say, I don't know, you have to work very hard and you're going to get a minimum wage. In choice b, you just do nothing. You go and get a subsidy from the state. What is no hard work. You just sit home, watch tv, and you get paid â‚¬1000 in Germany or France or whatever, what's going to be, it's very obvious to you then what choices are going to be taken? Or if you introduce rent controls, is it going to make the situation with apartment search better or worse? The story goes on and on. We don't have time now to dive into it, but I got deeply impressed and I became a fan of austrian economics. Yet before bitcoin, and then bitcoin appeared, and I thought, wow, this is a really interesting experiment.
00:05:40.980 - 00:06:31.978, Speaker B: This is probably going to be a toy. It will always remain a toy, but if we could only somehow bind it to gold, maybe this thing could work. But of course we had liberty reserve and e gold just before bitcoin, they collapsed. This is why bitcoin was born, because you could not do it with centralized means. You needed something that is much more resilient. And this brings us to a very interesting place where we are today. The struggle for freedom is what we've seen throughout the entire history of civilization, whenever you had more freedom in a given space and time and history, we had a lot more creativity, innovation, motivation.
00:06:31.978 - 00:07:29.006, Speaker B: And this led to prosperity. Think of greek city states, for example. It was a cluttered land with a lot of different policies, a lot of different political systems. They were competing a lot of different things. And you have this growth of science and culture and all the great philosophy from the time. Then at some point, roman empire takes over, makes a monolithic culture, monolithic state control being imposed on all these places, kill the archimedes, and basically the progress comes to a halt for a couple of centuries. Then they fall, and there is a period of what's called dark ages, which was actually not that dark, but we don't know much about the certain periods.
00:07:29.006 - 00:08:13.930, Speaker B: But then the enlightenment comes, and you have again, the certain constellation of political actors and changes in technology, changes in the offensive versus defensive types of technologies, leads to a situation where the freedom flourishes once again. You have a lot of small states, you have the very strong church in the western world, like the papal state versus local small governance. No one has absolute power. The power balance is very subtle. And you have the thriving merchant culture, you have thriving science. Everything is on the rise. And then it transitions into the modernity with the industrial revolution, and then it goes really parabolic.
00:08:13.930 - 00:08:29.686, Speaker B: And now we experience that with the appearance of Internet and mobile Internet and blockchains and future AI and whatnot. So whenever we have more freedom, it always leads to more creativity, and that leads to more prosperity.
00:08:29.790 - 00:08:41.955, Speaker A: So what will a more scalable ethereum mean for civilization in terms of freedom? In terms of cultural and technological innovation? What do you anticipate?
00:08:42.069 - 00:09:26.474, Speaker B: So the role of Ethereum, let's start back with where we left it with bitcoin. The greatest innovation of bitcoin is giving an individual technology that gives you the power to withstand attacks from the most powerful actors in this world, from super nation states. If you have your bitcoin key, or Ethereum private key, for that matter, all the supercomputers in the world cannot break it for you. It's yours truly. It's not that easy to attack you. The marginal cost of oppression is very, very high. It's like attacking one individual costs as much as attacking the entire.
00:09:26.474 - 00:10:13.330, Speaker B: You can't go after one individual. You have to go through some different. You kind of have to get a consent from the entire society to try to oppress this one person. And this is what ethereum obviously extended the bitcoin's resilience with a lot more flexibility in terms of programmability. And it brings us to this new paradigm called web3, which is essentially the next generation of the Internet, where Internet just gets supercharged with money and everything that touches value. And I believe that what we will see over the next couple of years is basically web3 just takes over. And everything, like whatever Internet has done to information, web3 will do to the world of value.
00:10:13.330 - 00:10:28.922, Speaker B: And everything that touches value will go on chain, like from payments to exchange, to trades, to all the even smaller things like tickets and like everything, property titles.
00:10:29.098 - 00:10:52.694, Speaker A: So before we get to that future, in the current environment, it's hyper competitive, right? If you look at the landscape of scaling, right? You have Zk sync, Polygon, scroll. How do you sort of see each of these groups approaching the problem? And what are you guys doing differently? And is it zero sum?
00:10:53.834 - 00:11:18.734, Speaker B: I think that what's happening is a lot of experimentation. We have different approaches. Like we started, we were the first ZK roll up, actually working on Ethereum. We got initially a grant from the Ethereum foundation. So we're really grateful for that. We had some freedom to experiment and try things out. And we launched the very first ZkvM live on Ethereum mainnet.
00:11:18.734 - 00:11:57.870, Speaker B: The only other ZK VM life is polygons. And we have stackware as a generic purpose programming roll up. And that's basically the landscape today. What is life? And there are a couple of more projects in the works. The differences between the live ones are we are focusing a lot on the future compatibility. So, like, we are thinking about the ideal future world to which the final destination where we want to arrive at. And then we reverse engineer from there.
00:11:57.870 - 00:13:08.574, Speaker B: What do we need to build for the architecture, giving the restrictions, giving the prerequisites that we want to achieve there, namely, like, we want to scale Ethereum fully, preserving this original core values of freedom, resilience, trustlessness, inclusivity through full permissionlessness that are there. So, like, it's paramount for us to keep all of that just at fully limitless scale. Like where we in the Internet, you don't have any inherent limits. There is no magic number of 1 million servers, and you cannot exceed that or like 1 million transactions or like 1 billion requests per second. You can always just add more servers, more networks, and extend it in an arbitrary way. So this is what we're doing. We're looking at that and we're saying, okay, what do we need to get there? So we realized, for example, that, and Starco made the same choice by the way that you have to start with focusing on native zero knowledge proofs first.
00:13:08.574 - 00:13:56.876, Speaker B: Whereas most other projects that are working on ZKVM start with EVM compatibility to the highest degree first. We will eventually converge, but the priorities are important. So we start with something like, how do we build something that is going to be like, what is the world going to look like once ZK takes over? And the fact that ZK will take over is, I think, is broadly accepted. But if it's not obvious, that's the only technology that gives us the ability to build this infinite, limitless Internet of scale or Internet of value. Nothing else works. All the bridges that we have today are having very, very fundamental Internet problems.
00:13:56.980 - 00:13:58.206, Speaker A: They're very scary.
00:13:58.380 - 00:14:17.962, Speaker B: They are. Well, you have a lot of exploits precisely for these fundamental problems. You require a very high degree of trust. You have to introduce a lot of trust assumptions in those networks. Those trust assumptions can be abused. And this is what we see. Most of the hacks are not on the smart contract level.
00:14:17.962 - 00:15:04.934, Speaker B: They are through the militia sector, or the servers are compromised, or things like this. Let's just take it for granted. ZK is the only way for us to build this fully trustless infinite bridges. If that's the case, and we want to bring everything like the entire water value to Ethereum using ZK, you have to start with something that gives you the absolute maximum efficiency. You don't build a new MacBook with the thought, I want to be running the old programs that are like ten years old in exact compatibility mode. No, you start with a new brand new chip, like M one, M two. And then you tell everyone you have to recompile your programs for this new chip, because that's going to give you the maximum efficiency.
00:15:04.934 - 00:15:44.324, Speaker B: Now, after you have that, you can build an emulator which will run in simulation mode, the older programs in compatibility mode, where things will still work, you will have some trade offs on efficiency, but they will be still functioning like whatever is missing. Other projects, except for Starkware. Starkware is also doing this. They just not using EVM. You can't really easily compile solidity and run into Stark. We have to rewrite everything in a new language, which I think is a very high entry of barrier entry for a lot of. You have to rebuild the entire ecosystem from scratch.
00:15:44.324 - 00:16:11.784, Speaker B: We thought, this is unacceptable for us. We need to stay in the open paradigm, in the open standards of Ethereum, but everyone else is trying to build the EVM equivalents first. We're like, let's just get something to work. Exactly. The way Ethereum works. That's going to give you a lot of performance penalty. And eventually it will be very hard to go from EVM equivalence to this maximum capacity.
00:16:11.784 - 00:16:22.214, Speaker B: You can't do the other way around. You cannot first build computer that simulates an old architecture and then say, let's supercharge it with highly performant applications, if that makes sense.
00:16:23.874 - 00:16:46.024, Speaker A: But you still have to go through the process of decentralization. What do you think are the biggest hurdles to properly decentralizing rollups? Are the HW requirements already still too high, or is it an acceptable threshold? And what might be some of the challenges with effective, orderly governance?
00:16:47.324 - 00:17:26.114, Speaker B: So let's start with technical challenges, then talk about the governance on the technical side. The big hurdle was the proof generation. The requirements to run the prover was relatively high. It's now going down to consumer GPU's, all of the proofs. We now have technology, we have something that, that will run just on consumer GPU's. And we basically can leverage all the existing mining farms for people who are previously mining things on GPU's. They will all switch over to generate the proofs for snarks for CK based chains.
00:17:26.114 - 00:18:20.504, Speaker B: So that is solved. There will be marketplaces for this. But fundamentally, the memory requirements, the GPU requirements are falling down to very low with recursion, because we can generate smaller circuits, like we can prove smaller circuits, and recursively aggregate basically any number of them in a single snark, which then finalizes the block on Ethereum. That is not a problem. A bigger problem would be data availability, in that you can only build something limitless in this network if you extend the ZK roll up data availability paradigm with something external that works off chain. And then there is a challenge, like how do you degrade the security somewhat?
00:18:20.544 - 00:18:23.364, Speaker A: Yeah, you open up an attack center there.
00:18:23.944 - 00:19:24.004, Speaker B: So this is an ongoing research area of what's the best way to do it in the most, most decentralized way. How do we build something that does not rely on analyzed majority? So this is like, I can't yet talk deeply about the outcomes of this research. It's ongoing, but we will have something that is more or less comparable. It's not 100% of security from Ethereum, but maybe 99, 98%, and that's going to be acceptable for a lot of cases. And then like really big transactions, really big amounts of funds, you will have to keep in ZK rollups. And Ethereum itself is moving forward with protodunk sharding and then dunk sharding, and then like proper sharding, where we'll have, and we just did the previous talk about that, we will have a much more scalable bandwidth for ZK rollups. So I expect everyone in the world, and we expect the world population to stabilize around 10 billion people.
00:19:24.004 - 00:19:34.174, Speaker B: I think everyone will have a chance to have their own accounts in ZK rollups, to have 100% security from Ethereum for most of their.
00:19:34.294 - 00:19:36.274, Speaker A: What's the size ceiling?
00:19:37.054 - 00:20:23.438, Speaker B: It's not about the size, it's about the transaction cost. The cost of transaction. If you're going to have, if 10 billion people have, let's say ten accounts each, you have 100 billion accounts. If they transact once per month, you can calculate back from there what's the TPS for roll ups is going to be like to support just the basic population needs for just moving funds from your savings account, your current accounts, which is likely going to be on something like Zika Porter. So those are technical challenges, which I think they're solvable. Now, on the governance side, there are a lot of experiments with governance going on. We definitely want to move as fast as possible to a system where there is no single honest majority that can dictate anything.
00:20:23.438 - 00:21:17.460, Speaker B: Like for example, upgrading a roll up should not be done by the team, should not be done even by a multi seq of the team plus some security committee. It should be done by broad acceptance of the users of a given l two. And whoever is the minority who do not agree with the new upgrade should have a chance to exit in a very cheap, very affordable and very timely manner to a different l two that they trust more. This is very fundamental. Now, the challenge here is we can't really do it the same way as on l one because the l two s are not forkable. If you have native ether or native other l one assets locked in a single l two, they have to stay there. They have to be governed by the rules of the smart contracts.
00:21:17.460 - 00:22:18.552, Speaker B: And while things like upgrades with time lock are now becoming standard, everyone will embrace them. We have them for Zksync Lite, for the first version of the protocol, this basic proof of concept for payments. We will use them for Zksync era, the ZKVM, as soon as we are out of alpha. But that's not enough, because time lock upgrades do not protect you from urgent vulnerabilities in the protocol, which are inevitable in the early phase of development. And we want to be doing more frequent rollouts of new features and so on. For that part, I think we'll have to stick to Security Council and maybe some other more interesting ideas with broader Ethereum governance maybe can step in somehow, which Vitalik recently criticized in his blog post about the overloading of social consensus of Ethereum. So this is also a very interesting research area.
00:22:18.552 - 00:22:50.776, Speaker B: Not how you govern, like things like protocol, treasury, for example, or how you give grants. You can afford to experiment in different ways. You can do liquid democracy, you can empower people to vote, you can have delegates, because a lot of people are going to be passive nature. They will not be actively participating in this voting, but this hard governance of upgrades and what the security issues, it remains a big challenge of the protocol. So happy to like if you guys have ideas, happy to talk after.
00:22:50.880 - 00:23:07.182, Speaker A: As long as there's just clear communication, though, because that's what we've seen historically in this industry, is communication. Hiccups can lead to confusion, which leads to whole slew of problems and animosity towards the people running the show.
00:23:07.318 - 00:23:58.664, Speaker B: I fully agree. We have to be extremely transparent about the risks, about like, I mean, if you're doing the governance in a way that like managers, treasury or whatever, you have to be very, very clear, very crisp in communication to avoid misreadings. Like, your words will always be taken out of context and will be like abused and so on. So you have to be like always very precise in the way you communicate. But especially what concerns the security, the risks, like the protocol itself, when people trust their money with a certain protocol, they have to be really aware of what are the risks. And we are in very early days for all the l two s. Even optimistic roll ups that are older get some vulnerabilities to get some patches from time to time.
00:23:58.664 - 00:24:05.898, Speaker B: None of us is free from that. So the bugs are always a reality and we'll have to deal with them.
00:24:06.026 - 00:24:33.054, Speaker A: So I'm curious, what maybe keeps you up at night? If I'm thinking about myself, it's one chair gensler over at the SEC. Is it the regulatory environment, perhaps, or is it something more technical? And in terms of a potential token, does Mister Gensler's crusade against crypto make that any less likely?
00:24:33.714 - 00:24:36.818, Speaker B: I have to honestly say I have a really good sleep these days.
00:24:36.986 - 00:24:40.498, Speaker A: Well, we were just talking backstage. We both slept like 12 hours last night.
00:24:40.666 - 00:25:23.858, Speaker B: Yeah, this is true. So these days I feel much more confident about both aspects, the technical things with regard to security. For example, this was something that kept me up at night a couple of years ago. I'm feeling much better now because we have security in depth. Zksync spent more money from what I can gather in public sources, we're close to $4 million on audits and public contests in security alone. And we are doing multifaceted approach to this. You don't rely just on audits, you don't rely just on open sourcing and crowdsource security.
00:25:23.858 - 00:26:01.994, Speaker B: You do more things, you think through scenarios like what can happen if there is a compromise. How can you mitigate that? How can you cover the damages? How can you limit the damages to something that is going to be bearable? And so on. So we have a lot of this in depth security these days, and we have spoken about that on Twitter and our public communication. That gives me pretty high degree of certainty that we're going to be fine there. On the regulator side, I think that the, I mean, there are people who are openly anti crypto in certain countries. There are other countries that are very pro crypto, very friendly. They're embracing of these new progress leaning ideas.
00:26:01.994 - 00:26:35.696, Speaker B: And also within the countries like the US, there is a very strong pro crypto movement in the government, in the Congress, in Senate, in the political establishment overall. And we're going to see some battle, but they cannot go against people. So I really like the initiative of Coinbase to display in the Coinbase app the stance of your politician, your phone number of a politician, so you can call them and share your. This is the beauty of crypto. This is the beauty of token.
00:26:35.720 - 00:26:39.564, Speaker A: We have nothing better to do except call our legislators.
00:26:40.144 - 00:27:35.292, Speaker B: Well, just being there, just showing your, just like aligning incentives of a huge amount of people using this technology, using something like tokens, fungible tokens, or NFts, is massive. This is something we never had in the history before, where we can individually just say, these people have something in common and they are capable of collective action, and they all know that everyone else is game theoretical. It's like, it's in everyone's interest to create pressure on politicians to behave properly and like to push the status quo. You're not isolated anymore. This is what Internet has done to information. Originally, like before Internet, you only had television, radio, newspapers, fairly centralized. The editors, the publishers there had a lot of soft power and hard power.
00:27:35.292 - 00:28:17.960, Speaker B: They were very powerful, tightly connected to politicians. And now the Internet has disrupted all of that, because now the media is decentralized and you have a lot of, everyone can become their own blogger and influencer. And if you're smart and you have a lot of interesting ideas, and you can engage people, you can easily go to millions of followers, or not easily, but you don't have to ask for permission. It's permissionless, it's meritocracy. It's like your ideas are stronger, so people like you and your voice is going to get stronger. You don't have to get the consent from certain political parties. And this changes the dynamics with tokens, with the Internet of value changes the dynamics even further.
00:28:17.960 - 00:28:49.972, Speaker B: They cannot attack it individually. We had the example of BitTorrent war where the publishers of content were trying to shut it down and they failed because you can't really oppose the popular movement. The majority of people don't support an idea. You will look like an oppressor. But with BitTorrent the incentives was lower. It's just personal for you. Either you pay $1 per song or $5 per movie, or you download it and you use it here.
00:28:49.972 - 00:29:23.988, Speaker B: It's a lot more powerful with tokens and the value of these tokens and the price going up and down depending on certain actions. People are feeling like very, very engaged in this kind of a lot more motivation because of the protective properties of cryptography that keep you there. These powerful guys cannot just go to one organization and say, shut down all of these tokens. You can't write a letter to bitcoin, you can't write a letter to Ethereum. It's just there, it's the fact that you have to deal with it. This is really cool.
00:29:24.176 - 00:29:26.144, Speaker A: So when token.
00:29:28.124 - 00:29:47.004, Speaker B: This is a good question. I like this question. I never say, not going to answer this question. I always do. And the token is something that has to be organic. You have to need it the moment you need it. There will be a token for certain things.
00:29:47.004 - 00:30:21.476, Speaker B: You do not need a token to use Zksync. You do not need a token to pay gas. You don't need any specific token. We figured that the UX is going to be one of the key enablers of mass adoption. So if you have to, like a friend of mine received 1000 USDC for some job on his like in crypto. So he had to create his wallet. He got the money there, then he wanted to send it to his bank account and he came to me and said, how do I do it? It says I don't have enough funds to pay fees.
00:30:21.476 - 00:31:06.590, Speaker B: How come I have $1,000 there? And I'm like, well, you need the ether to pay the gas fees. And you're like, yeah, I already figured that out. So I tried to convert my USDC to ether, but it told me that to convert I need some ether in the first place. Where do I get this is catch 22 type of situation, which is just ridiculous. It's absurd, right? So in the key, that would not be a problem, because we have native account abstraction for all accounts, like EAP 457, it leads away on mainnet for smart wallets. But you can't really use it with EOas, right? With metamask, you can't really use guestless transactions or someone else pays fees for you. But on Zika sync you can.
00:31:06.590 - 00:32:02.680, Speaker B: So he would be able to just send USDC to any other account, to an exchange, whatever, and pay fees. In the sense you don't need the token to use the key sync, you don't need a token to secure the network because it's secured by Ethereum itself, but you might need it for certain functions to decentralize the network. There is no better way to do it permissionlessly, but to have something to give people, you have to have some stake, which depends on the success of the network. We can't really use ether to secure the validators, to create decentralized sequencer, because if we use ether, then no matter you behave properly or you censor people or you do some other nasty things, the price of your collateral is going to remain the same. So it has to be correlated. That would be one thing where it's organically needed. There are more things like to decentralize the governance in general.
00:32:02.680 - 00:32:47.756, Speaker B: Same thing like your governance decisions have to be tied to this collateral. It has to be established some link. So for those things, once we come closer to that, we need them, the token will become necessary, and then that will is going to dictate the actions of the protocol, which is going to be, which has to be decentralized. Like metal apps is just the creator, humble creator of Zksync, which will be one of many contributors, just like Ethereum foundation is one of many contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem. But it's actually everyone is contributing. Like a lot of companies, a lot of individuals, researchers, hackers are working making Ethereum stronger. And we envision the same for Zika sync, which is just an extension.
00:32:47.756 - 00:32:51.428, Speaker B: It's a layer of computation, layer of scalability on top of that.
00:32:51.596 - 00:32:59.736, Speaker A: Maybe we can take the last few minutes. Absolutely. Are we taking questions? I don't know. This guy is ready?
00:32:59.880 - 00:33:00.604, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:02.584 - 00:33:03.480, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:33:03.672 - 00:33:26.416, Speaker C: Yeah, my question is around the SEC, right? I mean, of course, bitcoin and ethereum, they're decentralized. It's nice and beautiful. We love that. But the SEC can go after the Ethereum. It's not that, because he didn't say whether ethereum is a security or not during the hearing in the US, that he's not thinking about a strategy to attack it.
00:33:26.440 - 00:33:26.816, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:26.920 - 00:34:02.352, Speaker C: The SEC has had a hundred percent win rate, right, against their cases. So we really have to think about that possibility. They can even go after the Ethereum foundation in Switzerland if they wanted to, even if it's not their jurisdiction. But they can. They have done it in the past. So what do we do as a community to fight the SEC? I mean, obviously you can vote them out, right, next year at the state level and obviously at the presidential level. But I think we are underestimating that threat.
00:34:02.352 - 00:34:12.768, Speaker C: And how do we feel about that? I mean, we've seen what's happened recently, right? And the market overreaction of last night, etcetera. So is that the end of it?
00:34:12.936 - 00:34:20.645, Speaker A: We can all learn from McGraw and head down to Maryland. Just kidding. What do you think?
00:34:20.789 - 00:34:56.818, Speaker B: That's a good question. So I am much less worried because we have investors, pretty strong investors from the US. For example, Andreessen Horowitz led our series be around. They are very active in DC, engage with politicians in the efforts to educate people about these new technologies. And I know that the stance of political establishment in the US is not homogeneous. It's not like everyone is just against crypto. There are a lot of open minded people and a lot of really, really powerful people.
00:34:56.818 - 00:35:34.216, Speaker B: So like for example, the head of the financial committee of Congress is very pro crypto. He has some really, really tough questions, Mister Gensler at the hearings, and there are many others. On the one hand, this is the result of this popular adoption of ethereum and bitcoin and crypto in general in the US, which creates this motive for politicians to. Our voters are users of this technology, our creators. There are jobs at place. We have to protect them. It's not just something completely irrelevant.
00:35:34.216 - 00:36:06.518, Speaker B: On the other hand, let's imagine that they succeed. So they attack Ethereum. What does it mean? They can ban Ethereum from exchanges in the US, not from like, okay, or they can attack Ethereum foundation. Fine. Will Ethereum survive without Ethereum foundation or without them? If they are getting crippled or being fined or whatever? Of course we will survive. We're way past the point where we will depend on Vitalik, on Ethereum foundation or someone else. We are much stronger now.
00:36:06.518 - 00:36:33.840, Speaker B: Ethereum will survive, will continue to thrive. If it's going to be banned in one country, well, that's going to be a pity. But it's not going to be banned in Switzerland and Singapore and Malta and the UK and other places. So the world is decentralized already. There is no global world government. And by using crypto, we can push for. For the status quo to just to improve, not to get worse.
00:36:33.840 - 00:36:43.324, Speaker B: So, like, we want. We want to prevent that huge, totalitarian global state from appearing and, like, protect our freedom by using this technology. That's our mission.
00:36:43.704 - 00:36:45.312, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you, Alex. Thank you.
00:36:45.328 - 00:36:45.784, Speaker B: Thank you all, guys.
