00:00:07.280 - 00:00:40.542, Speaker A: Hey, so my name is Lauren. I'm the founder of Open Source Economy. And so basically, open source economy is a not for profit organization that has a goal to reconcile open source values with sustainable funding. And so my background is, of course, engineering if I'm fighting for open source. But let's say I more like using engineering, like more for a tool. And I really like also the business and marketing and stuff like that. And so what I saw among my friends that are working for open source is that usually they're very, very great developers, but they lack a little bit of business skills to make their projects sustainable.
00:00:40.542 - 00:00:54.730, Speaker A: And so I'm here to help them, hopefully. What I really like about the conference is that it's very diverse. There is a lot of topics about daos that I really like and how to establish a real decentralized governance, which is also efficient. So I really liked it. Yeah.
