00:00:28.194 - 00:00:35.442, Speaker A: All right, good evening once again, everyone. We'll be having our next speaker, Vinay Gupta.
00:00:35.498 - 00:00:38.734, Speaker B: He'll be speaking on global finances in arriving on blockchain.
00:00:40.874 - 00:01:59.632, Speaker A: All right, let's welcome Vinay Gupta with Napoleon, please. Anyone else coming in? Is this it? Oh, let's do this thing. Okay. And I got my clicker and we are good to go. Okay, so let's talk about what it means that global finance is arriving on the chain, right? This is the end of the old world without any shadow of a doubt. Right? Where did we begin? For me, the old world started in the 1990s. I was a cryptographer, cryptographic applications developer, working in the late nineties, mid nineties.
00:01:59.632 - 00:02:41.424, Speaker A: My first year being paid 100% in anonymous digital cash was 1999. I worked for government a couple of times and I joined the Ethereum Foundation 2014 to run the launch. Where I worked was basically trying to figure out how to get mass adoption for Ethereum. And I figured out that that was going to mean convincing the lawyers that smart contracts were legal contracts. And if we could do that, then we could figure out how to integrate into the whole global system. That project is materium, and that's what I actually do for a living. So I'm working on that integration problem as part of a strategy towards Ethereum mass adoption.
00:02:41.424 - 00:03:22.134, Speaker A: But we're in a new game now because the big guys have arrived. And by the big guys, I mean Blackrock. BlackRock has $10 trillion of assets under management. It's one of the largest companies in finance globally, and it has an enormous reach and enormous power and impact. BlackRock arriving on the chain changes everything. Whether or not we think of them as being adopting Ethereum per se, whether they're just going to take the technology and fork it, whatever they do. When you have the most powerful person in finance say that they're going to tokenize all of the world's financial assets.
00:03:22.134 - 00:03:58.782, Speaker A: That's from ten years, from the first time anybody heard the concept of a token. We went from coins to tokens to the most powerful person. Finance says we're going to tokenize all the assets in the world within ten years. This is staggering. I remember when the Ethereum foundation was like 35 people and we went from there to this in ten years. That gives you a sense of how ready these ideas are and how powerfully they impact the real world. Something like Linux successfully took over the world, but it did not take ten years.
00:03:58.782 - 00:04:47.588, Speaker A: It took closer to 30 years. The model that comes along with the trad five folks arriving is the rollout of the conventional model KyC, AML, CTF, you get the shutdown of projects like Tornado cash. You get a compression of the kind of anarchic freedom that was originally envisaged on the blockchain into a much, much, much narrower range of activity. And that. Oh, I lost Mike. Hello? Okay. And that compression is extremely destructive to the opportunity for freedom, because as we get more and more and more of these kind of trad five people coming on board, you get more and more and more tradfi style thinking.
00:04:47.588 - 00:05:34.154, Speaker A: And as a result, you kind of get trapped in this position that we're in. So what I'm going to suggest is that by the time Blackrock arrives and says, we're going to KYC everything, we've lost our way. And what we need to do is we need to go back to the start and figure out what the true direction was from our original first principles. And for the first principles, I'd like to point to the 1994 crypto anarchist manifesto. Has anybody heard of this? Good few hands. Excellent. So the crypto anarchist manifesto was a kind of real examination, in an almost science fiction sense, of the impact of tokenization, the impact of private communications, the impact of digital cash written before any of these things really existed in a widespread, usable form.
00:05:34.154 - 00:06:11.546, Speaker A: And it's extreme stuff, right? It basically suggests that you're going to get world peace by starving governments of revenue to the point where they can no longer collect taxes to then fight wars. Right? 1994, they were making the argument, and they were not messing around. The tax starvation argument was the core. Now, you guys are mostly ethereum crowd. If you've talked to bitcoin, Maxis, who are just like, but you don't understand, you're corrupting the vision. If we can't starve the governments of taxes, the world will fall. This is what they mean in this era.
00:06:11.546 - 00:06:55.930, Speaker A: They really thought of tax starvation as being a way of getting the governments to stop fighting wars. It was a huge, huge agenda item. So what actually happened from that wave of nineties? Cryptography is basically nothing. And I want to stress basically nothing other than trillions of dollars got generated. And the trillions of dollars came because we took this cypherpunk technology for link encryption, so a secure connection between two people with no eavesdropping, and we tied it directly to the commercial system in a way that generated what you would now call ecommerce. And that system, the e commerce system, goes on to run the entire world. From that point out, in terms of retail transactions, that is all that became of cypherpunk.
00:06:55.930 - 00:07:36.574, Speaker A: To all intents and purposes, it died either in the late nineties or shortly after 911. The whole kind of thing got shut down, and we got a very, very thinned down, stripped out version of the future. So this is kind of the bridge that we are at relative to Ethereum and Wall street. The risk is that the 1990s cypherpunk revolution basically winds up as e commerce. And what will happen to our cypherpunk revolution is that we're going to wind up as another branch of Wall street. We're just going to wind up becoming the system. And that might make a lot of people very rich, but it's not going to change the world, never mind save it.
00:07:36.574 - 00:08:04.254, Speaker A: This comes along and is kind of the midlife kicker. Bitcoin 2000 a day, everybody gets interested in electronic cash. Again, this could be a thing, but electronic cash doesn't stand alone. It doesn't solve the fundamental problems as a single thing. You have to pair it to the rest of systems. You need things like identity. You need the ability to handle non cash assets, you need the ability to buy and sell.
00:08:04.254 - 00:08:51.242, Speaker A: You need marketplaces, places. So what happens with bitcoin is bitcoin works, but then you have to build a whole bunch of extensions around bitcoin to make bitcoin useful. And those then become the points at which you get intercession, interdiction. The exchanges wind up with problems with KYC, you wind up with hugely intrusive monitoring schemes on the chain itself. It's a step towards something. But without, for example, ZK stark Technologies, it's hard to argue that bitcoin provides the kind of privacy that you expect it to. Even though there are limitations on what bitcoin offers, you still wind up in a position where the most powerful man in the world officially is talking about the tax starvation argument in 2016.
00:08:51.242 - 00:10:11.880, Speaker A: So Tim May, who is some random dude off the Internet who I think worked for intel, makes the tax starvation argument, the crypto anarchist manifesto, 22 years later, that's being answered by the most powerful man in the world. Does that sound like we're making progress towards something? Right? But this is clearly not a fight that we can win, right? So we have to start thinking a little more strategically and a little more carefully about what are the fights that we can win and what are the fights that we have to avoid, because we cannot get into a direct confrontation with the nation state about a lot of this core operational capability, because if we do, we're going to get squash like bugs. And I want to point to the tornado cache thing as an example of that, what we need is a third way. We need a strategy which is not direct confrontation with the state and not capitulation to the nation state, but it allows us a zone of freedom where we can continue to operate and we continue to grow in a way that gets us most of what we want from the deal without having to try and get into a direction. Showdown with the feds. Because nobody survives a direct showdown with the feds. So as an example of this, right, the most recent situation with Biden, you know, everybody's expecting the ETF's are going to go, the ETF's are going to go, it's going to be great, it's going to be fantastic, everything's going to be fine.
00:10:11.880 - 00:10:42.016, Speaker A: Turns out the ETF's are not going to go. Huge, huge, huge problems. So what I want to suggest here is that we do not have to be in a position where we're fighting the power directly. The american government have a very confrontational attitude to this stuff that is not true for the rest of the world. So I want to go back here to a set of slides that I delivered in Prague in 2014 that illustrates a different approach. The slides in red are the 2014 slides. Yeah, shiny, right? Shiny.
00:10:42.016 - 00:11:13.280, Speaker A: Those were the days. So what we proposed in 2018 was that there was a thing called a fiat asset, and the fiat assets were created by the state in the same way that crypto assets were created by cryptography. This model has borne out really well. Right? Fiat assets controlled with fiat keys, fiat identity, that's just like house title. Crypto assets controlled with native keys, ethereum, bitcoin tokens. Crypto assets controlled with fiat identity, that's ETF's. Custodial wallets, banks, custody and crypto.
00:11:13.280 - 00:11:42.384, Speaker A: And fiat assets controlled with crypto ids, that is, tokenized, real world assets. The model holds up. Fiat assets and crypto assets are different things, but you can bridge them. Similarly, we argued the blockchain was inevitable. Turns out we're not the only people that think, though this argument was made from physics. This guy is the most senior judge in the UK for commercial law. He's the person that decides civil dispute stuff at the highest level there is in Britain.
00:11:42.384 - 00:12:30.388, Speaker A: Blockchain technology is unstoppable now. Right. You know, will be adopted, will become ubiquitous in all major industrial and financial sectors because it allows for the immutable recording of data, reducing friction in commercial and consumer transactions, and obliterating the scope for dispute as to what has occurred. Now, does that sound like somebody that is hostile to the blockchain? I would say no, not hostile to the blockchain. So why are we getting such a different attitude from the american government and from the british judiciary? Well, the answer is it solves a problem that they have, which is evidence management in cases. So if it solves a problem they have, they're interested in it. Similarly, this guy leads a project called the UK Jurisdiction Task force.
00:12:30.388 - 00:12:58.724, Speaker A: They make a thing called the digital dispute resolution rules. It's a set of rules for arbitrating disputes involving crypto assets. And it's about a 15 page legal document that really does a great job of figuring out what you need to do if you're going to be working with crypto assets and legal disputes. It's fantastic. Materium consulted on the creation of that document. We're the first company in the world to use it. So in the UK, there's a really strong base of support for doing stuff on the chain.
00:12:58.724 - 00:13:36.994, Speaker A: Right. It's not that we're locked into a single way that things can be. The political landscape that governs the blockchain is a complex thing with a lot of moving parts, corporations, the state and the people. It varies from place to place. It varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. So this whole notion that real world assets were the future of the chain in 2018, this was fantasy. But by the time you've got the legal machinery that's being set up in a whole bunch of different countries, in a whole bunch of different jurisdictions, that legal machinery begins to tie together the possibility of actually solving these problems.
00:13:36.994 - 00:14:00.052, Speaker A: Right. It's gone from way off in the future to right here right now. So, for example, we speculated in the future, you could take all this world trade stuff and move it on chain. The enabling legislation, called the European. Sorry, the UK Electronic Trade Documentation Act, ETDA, just passed this year. Right. So this stuff is incredibly powerful.
00:14:00.052 - 00:14:31.696, Speaker A: UK government says $280 billion a year of efficiency savings from using electronic trade documents. This stuff is mind blowing. Right? Similarly, Lord Mayor of London, head of the UK financial Centre, shared ledgers, digitization of assets and contracts. So in the UK, they've taken a completely different approach to the american approach. European Union, Mica. A lot of people are afraid of mica. Do not be afraid of mica.
00:14:31.696 - 00:15:10.696, Speaker A: Mica levels the playing field. So there'll be a standard set of rules for crypto. And the fact that there's a lot of fighting in America about what the rules of crypto ought to be, and it's become politicized, Democrat versus Republican, has nothing to do with what's going to happen with global crypto adoption if the Americans continue to make a mess of that, if anything, it's going to accelerate crypto adoption in the EU, and the EU is still the largest economy in the world. So what I want to suggest here is that we are not fighting government on all fronts. There is continuous haggling with the american government. The american government have always had a hard time with crypto, going back 30 years, 30 years. We should not expect them to change.
00:15:10.696 - 00:15:45.060, Speaker A: Now, on the other hand, London is the largest financial center in the world. The EU is the world's largest economy. Both of those jurisdictions are doing just fine with crypto. Thank you very much. No problems there. So, final section of this, aligning global systems. So, in the 1950s and 1960s, there was an incredibly powerful wave of globalization, largely driven by new technology in the form of things like sort of data communications in its very earliest stages, telephony.
00:15:45.060 - 00:16:20.342, Speaker A: It was all driven by this very early revolution in communications technology. I think maybe in the first communication satellites. Visa, founded in 1958. The idea was you had a single card that you could take anywhere in the world when you flew, and you could do transactions. At the time, this was thought of as being like a revolution in global finance because it meant that you had one kind of money that could be used anywhere on earth. It was mind blowing, incredibly powerful. Similarly, gold, the oldest of technologies, and gold, there's no single country that produces it.
00:16:20.342 - 00:16:49.924, Speaker A: There's no single country that consumes it. Gold is everywhere, for everybody, for everything, and always has been. These are the global decentralized networks that already exist, and these are our natural allies. So there is a sweet spot between Ethereum contract law under the 1958 convention. So that's standard international arbitration. And the globalized assets. Right? Globalized assets is things like gold that do not have a single country of control.
00:16:49.924 - 00:17:43.139, Speaker A: So if you think of, like, a us company, that is an asset that only exists in America. But if you think of real estate, real estate is everywhere, literally, right? Anybody in the world that has real estate could then tokenize that real estate and potentially sell that real estate. This is a very, very powerful realization, because it means that we're not relying on the laws inside of any one jurisdiction about whether or not you can tokenize stuff. If you can tokenize it anywhere, you can sell it everywhere, because not all of the assets are contained inside of a simple local nation state economy. We're not playing on a single playing field. We've got the entire world to pick from. So I want to conclude very quickly here, right? This is not just theory, right? I had more than a decade working at the highest levels in government, in a variety of roles in the UK and the US on things like cybersecurity.
00:17:43.139 - 00:18:20.778, Speaker A: And I came to the Ethereum project with all of that knowledge and all of the kind of understanding of the long term landscape that we were looking at that came from having moved through that world and contributed in that world. So when I took off in 2017 to start materium, it was explicitly as a long term political project to try and make sure that we could get mass adoption. We wouldn't get stuck in the same way that we'd gotten stuck in the 1990s. We know that you can generate trillions of dollars of wealth from cryptography. It's been done already. That was the e commerce revolution. No little HTTPs padlock, no e commerce, no e commerce, no Amazon, no Facebook, no Apple.
00:18:20.778 - 00:18:55.770, Speaker A: This stuff is the core driver. What Ethereum. Well, what e commerce did for retail, Ethereum could do for real estate. If there's one thing I want you to remember, it's this. There is no global electronic exchange for real estate, right? And the fact that there is no global electronic exchange for real estate is bizarre because there are global electronic exchanges for everything else. But real estate is the world's largest asset class. So if we get one thing right, and that's global electronic exchanges for real estate run on top of Ethereum, we are set for the next 50 years.
00:18:55.770 - 00:19:58.820, Speaker A: That's pretty much the definition of victory. Real estate is the last truly epic asset class which has no electronic exchanges. The other thing is gold, right? It is possible to de dollarize the Ethereum ecosystem, at which point the us government becomes 90% less annoyed with us. What they don't want is dollars bouncing off ZK snarks and then bouncing back into the fiat ecosystem because they lose control of the dollar. And nothing makes the american government more angry than losing control of its assets. So if we simply de dollarize and we get rid of the dollars in the ethereum ecosystem so that you just don't have USD anything tokens in that system, dramatically less friction with the Americans, you will get an attitude which is a bit more laissez faire, because at the end of the day, we're not standing on their shoes. We've done a bunch of work on gold for years specifically to try and create the opportunity to get away from the dollar ecosystem.
00:19:58.820 - 00:20:31.394, Speaker A: And you've got to remember, the gold ecosystem is globalized, right? It's Dubai, it's Hong Kong, it's Singapore, it's South Africa, Canada. Right. All of these global centers for gold have their own law, their own regulation, their own jurisdiction, their own governance, their own rules. And any one of those jurisdictions could provide the necessary physical storage for enough gold to anchor as much stable coin as you wanted to issue. Same thing can potentially do real estate. The difference is it's very easy to value gold. It's very easy to audit gold.
00:20:31.394 - 00:21:13.568, Speaker A: We do not need to be, be dependent on the dollar economy for stability in crypto assets. So this model, right, this long term alignment on global systems, we've been working on that for years because it's only by aligning with existing global systems that are already decentralized or partially decentralized that we get any kind of long term prospective victory. What we want to do is we want to get all of the components of a decentralized world working together. Contract law, global assets, and Ethereum. Final thing is just as kind of gag. It's not just this world. So we've just announced a partnership with an outfit called Project Moonha.
00:21:13.568 - 00:21:53.414, Speaker A: Project Moon Hut has probably the best shot right now of getting human habitation on the moon. And it's a very, very technically conservative project. They're not doing anything particularly new with technology. They're taking the same basic structures that you use in the International Space Station, but they're building them on the moon. Right. They've already got an enormous partner network towards that goal, including groups like Lockheed Martin. And what we're doing for those guys is getting involved in the whole process of managing the IP, cross licensing agreements between hundreds of commercial entities that are necessary to get this project done, but also to help manage the iPad stream that comes out of that settlement.
00:21:53.414 - 00:22:31.114, Speaker A: And this is exactly the kind of high profile stuff that if you pull off one or two of these on the blockchain, it's much, much, much less likely that anybody's going to give the technology a hard time just for existing. So that was it. Thank you very much for your attention, and I'll be around after this if anyone has questions. Thank you. All right, great. Do we do questions now? I don't think we do. Yeah, sure.
00:22:31.114 - 00:22:34.314, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't realize we were doing questions now.
00:22:35.894 - 00:23:33.370, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, I wanted to ask you because we are building a startup that is, it's called Token estate. It's about tokenizing real estate. And we are right now working on PoC. But one of the. It's more like a moral dilemma is if this really catches on and to the part that you said, and we create a digitalized real estate market, wouldn't it really hinder the opportunity for people to buy real estate in different areas? Because, for example, if you do that in Czech Republic and somebody wants to buy that, nobody from, I don't know, India is going to buy real estate in Czech Republic or like, not most of the people because it's really expensive here. But if you create that project in India for czech investor, France, US or whatever, richer investors, it's going to be a really cheap property.
00:23:33.370 - 00:24:03.334, Speaker B: So it will flood the market with like, new money. So the people who live in India will have, like, really hard time of buying real estate because the prices will skyrocket based on that. So how do we deal with that issue, like, from a morality standpoint, that our money will hinder the opportunities in countries that have less money, it's harder for them to afford real estate. If the european and the us markets flood the money there.
00:24:04.044 - 00:24:38.854, Speaker A: I mean, in most poorer countries, the real estate supply is not limited in the way that it is here. So here you've got enormously strong building codes that prevent you just building more housing. Hence the real estate is kept artificially expensive. Most poor countries, if you want to build housing, it's relatively easy to get the permits and the logistics and everything arranged so that you can't build housing. So if you do wind up with a bunch of foreign direct investments going into countries like India to buy, buy existing real estate, what will happen is that those folks will take the money that they're taking from selling their real estate and they'll turn it around and they will build more real estate. Almost certainly.
00:24:41.954 - 00:25:00.864, Speaker B: Wouldn't it affect the rent? Because if you buy, I just will make up numbers. But if you buy a normally house in India for $10,000, but right now, because of the bigger money from US and Europe, the houses will go to 20, $30,000 because, because it's the new money. You cannot charge the same rent.
00:25:01.024 - 00:25:32.640, Speaker A: Sure. But what they'll do is they'll then build a pile more housing and it will then cause the rents to come back down again. The rents will be defined largely by the ability of the locals to pay, and they'll simply build more housing until it balances out in the places where they're allowed to build. The big problem that you have in most of Europe is it's almost impossible to get permits to build new housing. And as a result, you wind up with an artificially restricted supply, which, of course, causes the price to skyrocket. It's all about, you know, the only cure for high house prices is build more housing. And I actually worked on housing stuff for years.
00:25:32.640 - 00:25:58.704, Speaker A: I have a project called Hexayurt, which is about ultra low cost housing. And the problem anywhere you want to build those houses is really the building codes. Yeah, it's a good question and come and talk to us because we've got, I mean, a lot of the material technology is very good for real estate projects. You know, we did a real, the first real estate listing almost three years ago, and we're ready to go to power other people's real estate protocols. Okay, any other questions? What do you have?
00:26:03.964 - 00:26:36.930, Speaker C: This is slightly tangential to your talk, but if anybody's going to say something about it, it would be you. You were talking about all of these assets and, you know, Blackrock and that side of things. And then on Thursday we heard a talk where somebody was talking about how USDT is the biggest asset in our industry, and at the same time, we are already in a de dollarization situation. So, like, how does that influence. I don't know, whatever you want to say about that. I'm super interested because people don't want to talk about de dollarization.
00:26:37.122 - 00:27:26.294, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, at the end of the day, if you're using dollars, you're standing on american soil, and the american government doesn't like crypto and never has. So inevitably, they're going to be able to want to identify the ultimate owners owner of every single door in the world in the same way that they want to be able to identify the ultimate owner of every square mile of us land or every share in a us corporation. You know, they feel like it's their duty of care to the american population to be able to track that stuff. So when you start talking about things like ZK Starks, if you put ZK Starks and USD anything in the same conversation, the american government is going to have a problem and you're going to wind up with things like tornado cache. It's just the nature of the beast. Okay, are there any more questions? We wrap it.
00:27:26.294 - 00:28:09.584, Speaker A: Oh, we've got one more. How exactly do you envision this de dollarization to happen? So in an ideal world, what would happen is that people would go from using USD pairs with things like bitcoin to using gold paired to things like bitcoin. So gold, up until 1970 ish, all of the world's currencies were backed by gold. So gold was the absolute stable unit for all the world's governments. And then things like a dollar would be worth so much gold and the amount of gold that you would get per dollar was fixed. So in the UK, we didn't use gold for this purpose, we used silver. And a pound was one pound of silver.
00:28:09.584 - 00:28:50.742, Speaker A: So one pound is, I don't know, whatever it is, 550 grams or something, and that was the amount of silver that the government would give you in exchange. If you burned one pound, you took it to the bank and you said, here's my pound note, they would physically give you the silver. So my suggestion is that what we should do is we should use gold rather than dollars as the stable unit of account for crypto. And you wind up with a two asset portfolio, which is gold for the stable asset and bitcoin or ether or some other crypto asset for the volatile asset. And that pairing gets you all the benefits without having the entanglement in a fiat economy. Right. Gold is not issued by government, and there are a number of governments that have very strong gold plays.
00:28:50.742 - 00:29:30.906, Speaker A: It becomes a different kind of relationship because you're no longer working with a country that has a 30 year hostility to crypto. You're working with Singapore or Hong Kong or Dubai, who are jurisdictions that don't care. But isn't it easier to denominate my assets in something that I can relate with? Like I can buy coffee in dollars, but I cannot buy coffee in gold. So it's easier for me to reason about the. Or I can have an understanding of my portfolio. Well, I mean, going from gold to dollars, if you want to keep track in dollars is very easy, right? The gold exchange rate is very easy find. It's very well established, it's very stable, right.
00:29:30.906 - 00:30:38.204, Speaker A: So people can still look at their balances and see how much money they have in dollars. But the underlying storage of wealth is either going to be an asset that's inside of the federal system or it's going to be outside of the federal system. So my suggestion is that people should try and move their assets outside of the american system, because at the end of the day, when all is said and done, the american government is not going to permit anonymous money, right? And it's not likely that people will casually permit anonymous gold, but it will be a very different kind of negotiation with relatively small countries about exactly what the rules are for doxing people when they've got large holdings of things like gold. It's just not the same kind of incentive for massive transparency every level. There's a little more room for our financial privacy in, for example, Switzerland. So if you end up with your wealth held in the swiss system as gold stored in a vault in Switzerland, you get swiss banking privacy protection, which is a completely different thing from dollars. And that's what you're really doing is if you use gold, you get to jurisdiction, shop for the kind of banking privacy regulations that manages your stable assets.
00:30:38.204 - 00:30:43.784, Speaker A: That's what gold gets you. It gives you the ability to shop for the right kind of bank and privacy law.
00:30:51.584 - 00:30:53.324, Speaker B: We have one last question.
00:30:54.784 - 00:31:15.576, Speaker D: I'll keep it brief, but so you told about nfts basically to kind of invest in gold bars, right? Why would I invest in an NFT gold bar instead of just buying theta gold? Isn't Theta gold is much easier to. Basically, it's much more flexible and fluid.
00:31:15.760 - 00:32:05.404, Speaker A: Yes. So the issue with gold is partial ownership of bars is very legally messy. So if you've got five people that all own 20% of the same gold bar, if there's some kind of problem, like the entity that owns the gold bar goes bankrupt, or they discover that there's some kind of fraud, it becomes very legally difficult to figure out exactly who owns what parts of what gold bars. And the real problem with this is very technical, but it's to do with bankruptcy preference. So. Sorry, bankruptcy precedence. So if I have basically an iou that says iou, 200 grams of gold, and I go bankrupt, your iou goes into a list with all the other ious and you may only get a fraction of the gold that you wrote, depending on what debts the bankrupt entity has.
00:32:05.404 - 00:32:51.894, Speaker A: If, on the other hand, you have a certificate that says, I own bar 1234 and you are paying the storage for bar 1234, in the event of a bankruptcy, the auditors that are going over this thing, the receivers will see very clearly that that bar happens to be in my custody. But the entity that goes bankrupt is not the entity that owns that bar. It's owned by one of their customers. So at that point, there's a very strong probability that you'll get the entirety of your value back. And that's kind of, kind of a technical point. And there are, in some jurisdictions, other ways of handling that point. But in general, for simplicity and ease and clarity of audit, you really want a simple relationship of 1 bar, one NFT, and the storage fees should be paid by the entity that owns the NFT.
00:32:51.894 - 00:32:55.022, Speaker A: It's a little inconvenient, but it's much, much safer.
00:32:55.118 - 00:33:00.286, Speaker D: I understand. And if I theoretically would burn the NFT, I could get the bar of gold sent to me.
00:33:00.430 - 00:33:17.930, Speaker A: Exactly. And we've already done that. We did a test batch of bars about three years ago, and everybody involved burned their nfts and got physical delivery of the bars. And it was much harder than expected because we hadn't accounted for some of the problems of customs and stuff like that. But we did eventually get every single person their value or their bar.
00:33:18.082 - 00:33:18.570, Speaker D: Okay.
00:33:18.642 - 00:33:18.978, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:33:19.026 - 00:33:19.586, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:33:19.690 - 00:33:20.614, Speaker A: You're welcome.
00:33:24.114 - 00:33:27.854, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Let's give a big applause to Vinay Gupta.
00:33:28.594 - 00:33:29.534, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:33:33.474 - 00:33:39.714, Speaker B: And we have a small five minutes break till next speaker. And the last one will come. Thank you.
