00:00:05.480 - 00:00:47.342, Speaker A: Alrighty, I'll give it a second to let people sit down. Alrighty. So thanks, everyone for joining me today. The future of estaking is modular. We're going to look at, well, ifstaking has been around for a good few years now, so we're going to look at what the next generation of staking protocols are going to look like, specifically liquid staking. And we're now looking at the thank you slide, which is not right. Oh, you can see the entire presentation in reverse.
00:00:47.342 - 00:01:16.654, Speaker A: Okay, let's try again. So, yeah, liquid staking has been around now for a good number of years. The first set of protocols that launched were very much the first generation of liquid staking. And we're now going to explore what the future generations of these protocols look like, specifically focusing on Lido's v two and stakewise's v three. Quickly, about myself, my name is Jordan Sutcliffe. I'm the business development lead at stakewise. For those of you who are not familiar with Stakewise, we were one of the original liquid staking providers.
00:01:16.654 - 00:01:44.694, Speaker A: We launched around the same time as Lido back in early 2021. We're just not quite as big as them, but we've been around for a good number of years now. So I don't mean to install everyone's intelligence, I'm sure everyone knows what modular means, but I kind of felt it necessary to define it. Still, something that's modular consists of separate parts that when combined, form a complete whole. We see modularity all over the place. In the real world, computers are modular. Cars are built in a modular fashion.
00:01:44.694 - 00:02:18.624, Speaker A: Those of you who are devs in the room will, I'm sure you program in a modular fashion too. And lots of DeFi is already modular. I would argue that maker yearn these protocols are modular. But you probably never thought about modularity when it comes to ETH staking or liquid staking. And the reason is because they don't really exist right now. This is a rather boring slide, but this is essentially a highly simplified architecture of what a liquid staking protocol looks like. You have what I call the core infrastructure, which is the smart contracts and the node operators.
00:02:18.624 - 00:03:09.644, Speaker A: Historically, these staking protocols have been a single staking pool where all the assets get commingled together, and then you have a bunch of node operators staking the assets on their behalf. And whether these node operators are onboarded in a permissionless fashion or permissioned, it ultimately doesn't matter. The architecture is very similar and ultimately very standardized. We then have a token layer which sits on top all the assets that get deposited into this pool are tokenized. And this is what gives people the ability to access their state capital across defi. So where can we make this architecture? How can we make it modular? Well, let's quickly start with the token layer. We've seen a transition to very much the standard for liquid staking tokens, and that is single reprising tokens.
00:03:09.644 - 00:03:55.716, Speaker A: There are lots of different tokenomics models out there. So Lido originally launched a rebalancing token Steth, where every day the actual, the token price itself remains pegged one to one with ETH. But every day, as it accrues staking rewards, the balance within your wallet increases. It's quite a nice ux, but the problem is that it's very difficult to integrate across defi. Like developers hate the logic when it comes to these rebalancing tokens. And it's the reason why Lido had to launch wraps state teeth, the repricing token version for that token for state teeth. And that is why you see Wrapstateth on uniswap, balancer, et cetera, because they do not want to want to handle that rebalancing nature tokens.
00:03:55.716 - 00:04:28.686, Speaker A: So this single repricing model is very much the easiest way to get your token integrated across the ecosystem. And because it's a single token, there's arguably reduced complexity there. It's very simple. Your token accrues in value as you earn staking yield. On our side, stakewise, we launched a dual token model when we first went live. We split the e staking principle with the rewards into separate tokens. It worked well technically in the sense that it provides the highest apy for our stakers, but fundamentally, it adds a barrier to entry because there's just extra complexity there.
00:04:28.686 - 00:05:06.674, Speaker A: So again, moving to this kind of single token model, which is what we're doing with stakewise, V three is the simplest way to offer a staking token. I'd also argue that they're the most tax efficient. Efficient's probably not the right word, but if you have a rebalancing token where every day you receive staking rewards and you get more of the token deposited into your wallet, is that a tax event? I don't know. I can't answer that. And so again, it's very simple. Having you buy token on day one, you sell it at day 20, it's increased in price, it's very defined in the tax setting. And again, because it's a simple token, you only need liquidity for one token.
00:05:06.674 - 00:05:33.558, Speaker A: It's simple and easy and the cheapest way. Remember that for liquid staking protocols, the liquidity part is the most expensive part. So the more you can simplify that, the better. What I'm getting at here is that that token layer is very standardized. It doesn't mean you can't do funky things with it, like what Frax is doing and stuff. That's a very expensive model to run and it has extra complexity. But fundamentally, the cheapest, easiest way to run a liquid staking token is with a single repricing model.
00:05:33.558 - 00:06:14.554, Speaker A: So there's not much room for change there and not much room for innovation, I would argue. So that leaves us with that core infrastructure level where we should be adding the modularity and innovating. And this is exactly where we see Lido and ourselves changing our protocols. So looking at Lido, first Lido V two. So historically, Lido was a single permissioned staking pool that still exists on the far left, that sits under steth. Adding node operators to that was quite a cumbersome process. And so what they introduced with V two is what they call the staking router.
00:06:14.554 - 00:06:55.860, Speaker A: And this is a way that streamlines the onboarding of new node operators, or clusters of node operators in what they call modules. And so next to the permission set, you can have what's effectively a fully permissionless node operator set, which they're calling the community module, where anybody can come in and become a node operator again while still sitting under the steth umbrella. You could also have like a DVT cluster. So DVT is distributed validated technology. Historically it's been one validator is run by one node operator. DVT distributes that validator across multiple node operators. So you'll have maybe three, four node operators running a single validator.
00:06:55.860 - 00:07:36.494, Speaker A: Lots of benefits that come apart of that. But what I'm trying to get at here is that you can essentially plug and play any type of configuration, no configuration under this single liquid staking token umbrella. For the case of lido, the DAO needs to approve these new modules. And the DAO will also specify by how big or how much stake they're able to take on. And in the case of permissionless modules like the community module, there will be bonding in place. Essentially, node operators will have to post collateral to protect against malicious attacks. But as a staker, you still get the simple one click staking.
00:07:36.494 - 00:08:13.834, Speaker A: It's lido that handles all the delegation across the different modules. For a user, you simply just still swap from ETH to steth on our side. Whilst I appreciate the architecture looks incredibly similar to the previous slides. The way these protocols work are actually very different on our side. Again, historically, this legacy pool here is our current staking pool, the permissioned node operator set. But what we're going to allow is for anybody to come and launch a staking pool in parallel with this, this original pool. So it could be a solo staker, it could be a group of node operators, commercial node operators, et cetera.
00:08:13.834 - 00:09:00.058, Speaker A: It could still have this DVT technology I spoke about previously. But essentially the opportunities are endless of whatever these staking configurations can look like, all whilst under a single liquid staking token. For us, the vaults layer or the staking pools layer is essentially a white label liquid staking service. Anybody can come in, create their staking pool, offer staking as a service, and their users will be able to stake and get access to Oseth. We're essentially giving anybody the building blocks to create their own solution. And this vaults layer is fully automated. They handle ETH delegations of any size, they handle the pooling of assets, the creation of validators, they handle the fees for the vault, and they're highly customized.
00:09:00.058 - 00:09:30.896, Speaker A: You can basically set up this, configure these vaults however you want to and so on. V three specifically, we do not have any clash requirements, whereas Lido does. We do not. We're essentially creating a completely free and open marketplace for anybody to create their own staking solution. And we're essentially going to let market forces decide how much collateral is required within this system. We as a protocol can't say you're an anonymous solo staker, you need to post x amount of collateral. We'll let the market handle that.
00:09:30.896 - 00:10:24.322, Speaker A: The important part though is that you still need some over collateralization. On Lido side, they always mint Steth one to one with ETH. And so there's no baked in protection there. On the steth token on our side we have this oseth layer which is over collateralized. What this means is that if you stake into one of these vaults or staking pools, let's say I stake ten ether with this solo staker, I will continue earning the ten ethers worth of staking rewards, but I'll only be able to mint, let's say nine oseth. So you get a slight drop in capital efficiency on what is liquid. But fundamentally, but this is a really important part of the protocol because if we allowed everybody to mint OSC one to one with stake deposits, then essentially this entire ecosystem, which by design is modular and isolated, becomes interconnected.
00:10:24.322 - 00:11:00.418, Speaker A: And so that over collateralization is a really important part. And for stakers, you still have that simple one click stake option, which is super important. You can go from ether into Oseth because it's over collateralized, it has inbuilt slashing protection. It accrues the yield from what will be a highly diversified set of node operators. And so it's a very high quality LST token to hold. But we also offer a slightly more advanced staking option, which is where you enter the stakewise marketplace. You can see all of these staking pools, and you can cherry pick which node operators you want to stake with.
00:11:00.418 - 00:11:44.144, Speaker A: Maybe you want to stake with solo stakers, or those running DVT, or those running in certain jurisdictions and locations. You can essentially come in, specify who stakes your capital, stake with them, and then still access OSC for the liquid staking token. So this modularity also adds extra functionality. We're going to allow solo stakers to mint a liquid staking token against their own node. So historically, these home stakers have to make a choice, do they want to liquid stake or do they want to stake at home? We're removing that decision. You can do both. The way this would look like is a solo staker can come to stakewise, create their own staking pool where they are the node operator.
00:11:44.144 - 00:12:38.034, Speaker A: They maintain full control of that staking pool, full control of their node. But because they deposit through that staking pool within the stakewise ecosystem, they can access oseth. And we're really hoping this is going to be a mechanism to attract and help decentralize the ecosystem and to attract more people to solo stake and stake from home. The other side of this modular architecture is that for regulated capital, it's a great way to segregate this capital. So, for example, let's say you're a centralized exchange, and you want to protect or put all of the assets from your us retail clients into a single staking pool, and then you have all the other assets in a different pool. You can do that, you can effectively segregate the capital within your solution however you want. And so this is becoming a very popular model with both retail and institutional regulated staking.
00:12:38.034 - 00:13:29.054, Speaker A: So what does this mean? Well, the plug and play nature of modularity allows for the fast expansion of adding node operators. It is a great way to help diversify the node operator set and decentralize the networks. And I'd also argue it's a great place to experiment as well, because each of these modules or vaults are completely isolated. You can test new technology and worst case scenario, if it blows up, it's very much isolated to that single module, and because of that nature, it just reduced the risk across the whole network itself. The other thing as well. And I really hope this modularity can help improve the health of the ecosystem. I've got a bit of a pet peeve that everybody wants to launch their own liquid staking token right now.
00:13:29.054 - 00:14:23.154, Speaker A: It is a sexy thing to do, and to be quite blunt, it's an easy way to raise capital. The problem is that a lot of these liquid staking protocols that are coming to market, the majority or a lot of their capital that they've raised, is going to have to go towards funding the liquidity for that liquid staking token. What's truly important though, is that we prioritize the funding and development of that core infrastructure. At the end of the day, our goal is to make sure we can distribute ethics across as many node operators as possible, in a safe a manner as possible. And that comes from that core infrastructure. And so by having a modular protocol where anybody can come in and plug into a single liquid staking token, they can focus all the capital they've raised into actually helping the health of the ecosystem and distributing ether in as safe a manner as possible. And DVT is a great example of that.
00:14:23.154 - 00:15:08.280, Speaker A: So to kind of wrap it up here, not only does this modular architecture improve on the previous or the current architectures, by improving decentralization, by adding more node operators, it also can help focus investment on the core infrastructure level. It also adds extra functionality. As I mentioned before, the liquid solo staking, the staking of regulated capital, it really is a win win in moving from those historic single pool protocols into this modular design. And that's everything. Five minutes, right? I can take any questions on stage. I'll also be around afterwards to. I'll stick around afterwards for any other questions.
00:15:08.280 - 00:15:21.620, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you.
00:15:21.812 - 00:15:25.020, Speaker B: Can you please compare your protocol to rocket pool?
00:15:25.132 - 00:15:45.284, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So lots of differences compared to rocket pool. The first thing, rocket pool again is still a single staking pool. It just distributes to multiple sets of node operators. On our side, rather than having one single pool, we can have multiple. So you get that segregated, isolated staking pools for the node operators.
00:15:45.284 - 00:16:18.472, Speaker A: Rocketpool does not offer those node operators a liquid staking token. The ETH that node operators post on rocket pool is effectively just collateral. It's insurance for the entire protocol. On our side, we have no collateral requirements. And so not only can you come to a platform like stakewise and offer staking as a service in a more capital efficient manner. We will also allow these node operators to actually mint a liquid staking token against those nodes. And so this is something which is becoming very popular.
00:16:18.472 - 00:16:32.804, Speaker A: It looks to be very popular. This platform is not yet live. It's going live in about a month. So yeah, that minting a liquid staking token is really key. It adds a lot of utility. It allows solo stakers to actually access Defi essentially.
00:16:35.844 - 00:16:39.424, Speaker B: What's your current take on the modularity of Eigen layer?
00:16:41.284 - 00:17:18.572, Speaker A: Yeah, quick answer is it's an interesting system. We're certainly taking a look at it on our side. We're just approaching with very much with caution. We have the ability to integrate Eigen layer in multiple levels within stakewise. We're likely just going to go down the route where we allow people who have oseth to restake that and play around. In that sense, having a much more core integration, whilst it's still a new technology is probably going a step too far for us. But for sure it's interesting.
00:17:18.572 - 00:17:24.984, Speaker A: There's lots of people interested in restaking. It's a very hot topic right now. Just approaching with caution, basically.
00:17:32.184 - 00:17:42.004, Speaker B: Thank you for the panel. How do you plan to provide value to holders of stakewise governance token through all these features that you're going to be launching?
00:17:42.504 - 00:18:14.228, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. So currently the stakewise governance token, or swize, is just a governance token. That's all it is. What we're planning to do though, with stakewise v three, is to add extra utility for that token. What we will allow people to do is to stake in a permissionless fashion. Anyone can stake their swize into a staking pool to provide insurance as like a junior tranche for that staking pool. In return, they will receive a percentage distribution of the protocol fees to that swize.
00:18:14.228 - 00:18:22.946, Speaker A: So we're adding swize essentially as a collateral asset within the protocol, both for node operators, but also for anybody to harness and receive the protocol fees.
00:18:23.010 - 00:18:25.642, Speaker B: That's great. And when are you expected to be launching this?
00:18:25.738 - 00:18:39.762, Speaker A: Sure. So our final round of audits is going live in the next week or two and it's truly dependent on how long that takes. Fingers crossed. We're looking. It's hard to say. Audits can take four weeks, six weeks. So.
00:18:39.762 - 00:18:49.254, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. We're out of time, but thank you very much. Awesome. Yeah, thanks guys. It.
