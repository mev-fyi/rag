00:00:05.480 - 00:00:26.474, Speaker A: Hey guys. Hi. Thanks a lot for coming to this talk. It's a privilege to have you here. My name is Arsene. Oh yeah, my name is Arseny. I'm a co founder and CEO of Daoism Systems.
00:00:26.474 - 00:01:03.974, Speaker A: It's Berlin Blaze, Berlin based web3 venture studio and developers hub. So we are building daos, we are building DeFi solutions and we are building toolings for online organizations. Here is my Twitter. I regularly shoot post there, so please follow me on Twitter. And here is daoism Systems Twitter. So the topic of this talk is web free reserve assets in the age of black swans. So when I was preparing for the.
00:01:03.974 - 00:02:44.404, Speaker A: For this talk, I went to chat GPT and asked it what reserve asset is, and it told me that basically reserve asset is a highly liquid store of value, such as a foreign currency or gold held by central banks or monetary authorities to back liabilities, influence monetary policy and provide financial stability. I think that financial stability here is the most important part because that's what we are all looking for right now in this turbulent times and in the context of this talk, we are going to talk mostly about reserve assets, not for financial authorities like from governments, but more about web3 organizations such as daos. Web three funds, web free startups. So stability, right? We're looking for stability in the age of black swans. I really think we are going through this age when a lot of unpredictable events occurring and these events, they change structurally, the economy and financial realm. So the black swan event was originally coined by the influential financial expert Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and it refers to highly uncommon and unpredictable incidents with serious ramifications. So in our financial, economic landscape, black swan events are not just outliers, but game changers that demand attention and understanding.
00:02:44.404 - 00:03:05.676, Speaker A: So basically, those are rare events that happen and they change reality. They change financial reality. They change economic reality after they occur. We have to restructure as the society. So these events have several attributes. One of them is rarity. They're rare.
00:03:05.676 - 00:03:36.544, Speaker A: They happen maybe once in a decade. And they are outside of realm of expectations. They're extreme. They have extreme impact on society as a whole and severe consequences. And they are predictable. That means that you can predict them, but when you look backwards, you know that it was supposed to happen. So here is a timeline of recent black swans.
00:03:36.544 - 00:04:36.906, Speaker A: It all started in 2008, famous 2008 global financial crisis with Lehman brothers collapse. And I truly believe that this event was a real game changer in the entire world. And for web3, especially because that was sort of the birth of web3. Right after we will talk a little bit more about that. But yeah, also some other events that happened over like last decade, Brexit. And then we are coming to the period when I think that black swan event started to accelerate with COVID pandemic, global lockdowns, the change of supply chains globally, then russian invasion to Ukraine, and very famous Silicon Valley bank collapse. That had its consequences over web free landscape as well.
00:04:36.906 - 00:05:36.514, Speaker A: But we will talk about it later. So right after the one year after the global financial crisis has occurred, bitcoin blockchain has been launched. And in the genesis block of bitcoin blockchain, this title was stored. It was from the British Times, the 1 January 2009 canceller on the brink of second bailout for banks. So the banks were failing and they wanted to bail them out. So bitcoin was launched originally as like in bitcoin white paper, it is written that it's p two p digital cache, but very fast. And mostly because of this global economic crisis that was happening.
00:05:36.514 - 00:06:54.294, Speaker A: The narrative has changed significantly. And after being a p two p cache, it became what they call digital gold or a store of value. However, I would say that it's pretty blunt movement, because if we see the price changes, we don't really see stability here. It's hard to say that bitcoin is a reserve asset because of high volatility of its price. So as sort of a reaction to this high volatility of bitcoin, Tether was launched in 2004 on bitcoin blockchain through the omni layer protocol. And it was this asset kind of became web free reserve asset in a way, because now you can have your funds on the blockchain that are not volatile, they're pegged to United States dollar. So then you have the features of, you know, you have features of decentralized system and centralized system combined.
00:06:54.294 - 00:08:43.024, Speaker A: Also in 2014, Gavin Wood has coined term Web 3.0, which was also known as Web three, which was describing this new way of computer Internet network with focus on decentralization and the focus on blockchain technology. So two of these, like the birth of Web three and the appearance of more stable assets on blockchain, has led us to many innovations within the space. So after Tether was launched, Ethereum blockchain was launched and it allowed even more applications on the blockchain. The entire DeFi ecosystem was born and it led to the appearance of Makerdao, then reflexor Olympusdao and Supreme Dao, which I'm going to talk a little bit later, but what is important to mention here is that Silicon Valley bank collapse has shown up, has shown us that we should move away from the peg to United States dollar. Because as you have heard, the Deepak has happened of USDC and Dai. And basically it showed us that we need to look elsewhere to have stable assets.
00:08:43.024 - 00:09:50.494, Speaker A: A little bit more about the price of Rai. Rai is like Reflexer Lab has created a really cool stablecoin which is not pegged to dollar and I find it pretty cool. But unfortunately it's not also really stable in terms of relations to other assets and the price is mostly moving down. Another cool project in the field of reserve assets that I find cool is Olympus. And they actually were the first ones who said that we are building not a stable coin but a reserve asset. However, it also doesn't really, it's not really reserved if you look at the price movements. So we were exploring this project and looking what can we do to have some stable reserve asset that would help us to get through this complicated times.
00:09:50.494 - 00:10:29.854, Speaker A: And we came up with the idea of Supreme Dao. Supreme Dao is a dao behind Kai. Chi is a token which is a reserve asset resilient to extreme market volatility. It's a risk mitigated asset for Dao treasuries. It's stable, but not stable in the sense of being pegged to United States dollar, but stable in its own way. It allows for modest gains of upturns and it's resistant to extreme downturns. And also it abstracts away complexities of defi for user friendly experience.
00:10:29.854 - 00:11:02.404, Speaker A: There are three main building blocks of. Of supreme Dow. First one is the bonding curve, which is a pricing mechanism that. Can you guys hear me? Oh, yeah. No, it's that adjusts to the demand when minting Chi. And it is also backing the price of Kai partially. So then there is basket of assets, which is a collateral, the basket of assets backing price of chi.
00:11:02.404 - 00:11:47.214, Speaker A: And by diversification it also reduces the risks. And also we have strategies. Strategies are automated agents that are interacting with different DeFi protocols. And they can swap, they can lend, they can stake, and all these assets are being stored in the basket of assets. So here is a little bit of step by step guide on how it works. So first, user deposits stablecoins to mint kai. And the portion of stablecoins is allocated to strategies and everything else around 20% remains in the curve for exit liquidity.
00:11:47.214 - 00:13:27.484, Speaker A: The DAO Supreme DAO Supreme DAO decides on the strategies it whitelists or blacklist strategies that have access to the portion of the DAO of the collateral and they can interact with different DeFi protocols in order to optimize returns for Chi holders. And the cool part is that the pricing of chi is based on the combination of exit liquidity within the basket of assets, exit liquidity within the bonding curve, and the total value of the basket of assets. So when, when strategies are generating yield, it like these returns are being automatically, they are automatically adjusting the price of chi. So there is no need for rebase. We run simulations, we've seen simple strategies such as holding staked ETH and some yield bearing tokens, and we got into this number. So over the last two years with Luna collapse and then other collapses that happened over time, Kai price stayed relatively stable compared to other assets. And yeah, that's it on my side.
00:13:27.484 - 00:13:45.944, Speaker A: Join us revolutionizing defi with Kai, the supreme web free reserve asset. Here is our Twitter. Here is my Twitter and Twitter of daoism systems. Thank you. Do you guys have any questions?
00:13:47.924 - 00:13:52.824, Speaker B: I have the mic here. Super strong, very strong.
00:13:55.284 - 00:14:40.362, Speaker A: Hi. Who gets decide what strategy gets deployed? Yeah, so it's decided by Supreme Dao. So Supreme Dao has a governance token pretty much the way how Makerdao has MKR. We have sup. And basically strategies are being added to the system on a proposal basis. There should be a proposal about a new strategy that will benefit the DAO, benefit Kai holders and then sub holders through governance should whitelist the strategy. Yeah, it's important to say that strategy is a smart contract.
00:14:40.362 - 00:14:47.494, Speaker A: So it has to go through audit and then being enabled. For the DAO.
00:14:55.034 - 00:15:07.964, Speaker C: What is the decision making to decide which protocol should be go like integrated? Like it's not only just looking probably at the yields, it's also the risk side which has to be taken into account.
00:15:08.744 - 00:16:15.442, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, exactly. So I mean, the main goal of supreme Dow is to have Chi as a reserve asset. That means that it should be able to maintain degree of stability and liquidity and also have exposure to multiple assets. So the decision making process here is that there's going to be a dao governed forum where a proposal is being created and then the DAO members should evaluate. Does this strategy really benefit? Does it benefit the DAO? Is it aligned with DAo vision or it's not? For example, if the strategy would be to buy peppercorn and hold, then most probably the DAO would turn it down. Hello. I understand that is kind of back to dollar.
00:16:15.442 - 00:17:21.434, Speaker A: So what happens if the value of dollar comes down? No, and actually that's the whole point is not pegged to a dollar. The chi price is being decided on is being decided by the bonding curve and it's backed by the basket of assets. So basically we check the total value of the basket of assets and all the assets that Dow has and the exit liquidity which allows immediate exit from the, from the system. In this combination, the price is being defined. So yeah, there is no peg. And that's the whole idea of not having a peg because as you have mentioned, and as I talked before, like the banking system right now is not in the best shape and most probably it's better not to, to be packed to any fiat system. I really think that as web free community we should.
00:17:21.434 - 00:17:39.434, Speaker A: It's like the name of this place, parallel nepolis, the whole idea of having parallel systems. I think that it's very important to have our parallel systems in web3 rather than just getting into tradfi and legacy systems.
00:17:44.394 - 00:17:51.814, Speaker D: Driven by reserving how much of the demand is driven by reserves, how much.
00:17:53.914 - 00:17:55.210, Speaker A: Excuse me, I didn't get how much.
00:17:55.242 - 00:18:01.978, Speaker D: Of demand is demand for the token is actually driven by staking in other.
00:18:02.026 - 00:18:34.414, Speaker A: Coins or demand for kai token. So demand for Kai token is. We basically measure demand through the bonding curve. But the token is not live yet. It's project in progress and we are going to launch in Q 420 23. So it's hard to say what the demand is going to be, but I think there is a massive need in the market for this sort of financial product.
00:18:40.674 - 00:18:51.174, Speaker B: I was curious about the community, the DAo, how if you want to spend some words on that, what kind of community do you have? Human speaking.
00:18:51.714 - 00:18:52.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:52.794 - 00:18:55.298, Speaker B: Some numbers about the members participation.
00:18:55.426 - 00:19:31.502, Speaker A: Yeah. So we are a new project. We've just, we just started to grow the community right now. Currently we have around 15 what we call guardians. They're early Dao contributors who are helping us to define the strategy and figure out the right tokenomics and everything. We have Twitter account which I think right now is 300 followers. Maybe if you guys follow us there would be more and yeah, we are pretty fresh project.
00:19:31.502 - 00:20:01.294, Speaker A: Basically the main goal of this talk is to kind of call for allies. If you guys are aligned with our vision of building reserve assets and mitigating sort of these consequences of black swan events that are happening and most probably going to happen even more then. Yeah, you're super welcome to join the community. Supreme Dao is here and yeah, let's build the future together.
00:20:04.474 - 00:20:05.854, Speaker B: Other questions.
00:20:10.554 - 00:20:16.914, Speaker A: Cool stuff. Thank you guys. It.
