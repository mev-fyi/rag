00:00:14.800 - 00:00:45.884, Speaker A: Okay, guys, welcome to the Florida stage. My name is Mickey. I'm this afternoon's moderator and I'm honestly looking forward to this speech about the key role of sequencers in L2, scaling solutions and beyond. Well, honestly, as you see, I don't know much about the topic yet, and that's why I'm here. So I'm really looking forward to the talk. So please welcome Victor Munoz.
00:00:52.304 - 00:01:22.516, Speaker B: Thank you. All right, let me see here. Is this thing working? There you go. All right. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to give this talk. My name is Victor Munoz. I'm a developer advocate at Metis l two.
00:01:22.516 - 00:02:40.134, Speaker B: And really my goal and my purpose with this talk is to invite you to think and reflect on a topic that really is going to affect us all and is getting increasingly more complex. And it's getting also increasingly more important because of reasons that we will see on this talk. So let's start by stating some facts, right? You will see if you open social media, it's kind of crazy how you will see all of these opinions about alt l one s or l two s if they are being used, if they are useful and whatnot. And I really prefer to stick to the data. I have a background in physics, so I really feel more comfortable that way. And if you look at the data, you will see that l two usage. I put adoption there, but to be more strict, it would be usage is certainly increasing, right? So this is a plot that I took from l two bit, and it shows the total transactions per seconds of these l two s as a function of the time, right? So as you can see, the average Dp's has increased significantly over the past year, I would say.
00:02:40.134 - 00:02:54.762, Speaker B: And not only that, right? One of the main metrics for l two s is the total value log. And if you look at the data for that, you will find that the increase is about 125% more or less.
00:02:54.818 - 00:02:55.262, Speaker C: Right?
00:02:55.378 - 00:03:52.572, Speaker B: So of course this makes sense if you are into Ethereum, because Ethereum has a roller centric roadmap. So it is expected that as time goes by, maybe we are now on a bull market and we see all of this hype, maybe it's going to decrease. But on longer periods of time, we will see. It is expected to see a bigger l two adoption, as this plot here shows. And of course this makes sense because there is certainly an scalability improvement. There is a reduced cost, as you guys have seen with the introduction of the blobs, and you can opt for, you're going to have security maintenance from the l one right. Now, something that you probably have seen in social media or in other talks is that sequencers are kind of like this key piece on every l two.
00:03:52.572 - 00:04:15.390, Speaker B: And the reason for this is because they have the job of performing transaction ordering. So when you send a transaction on an l two, really what you are doing is sending it to this piece called sequencer that has the power of include your transactions rejected, I mean, not include that, or in ordering whatever order it wants.
00:04:15.452 - 00:04:15.818, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:15.906 - 00:05:07.234, Speaker B: And it also takes care of the batch processing. So a lot of the discussion, if you check out the literature and other talks, will be focused on centralization versus decentralization. And you will see a lot of people saying like, oh yeah, we have to work towards decentralizing the sequencer and whatnot, and what are the steps that we are taking. But really what I want to convey on these talks are other implications that maybe we are not thinking too much at the moment, but they will have an impact which are related to MeV. So I can mention before, when you send a transaction on an l two, really what you're doing is sending this to the sequencer, right? So the sequencer will get a transaction from everywhere and it will sequence that in the order it wants.
00:05:07.274 - 00:05:07.750, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:07.882 - 00:05:15.158, Speaker B: Most l two s have a centralized sequencer, meaning that they control what they can include and whatnot.
00:05:15.206 - 00:05:15.794, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:16.454 - 00:05:26.462, Speaker B: And the thing is that it's not only about the order of these transactions, but mostly, for my point of view, it's about the value that you can extract by doing so.
00:05:26.518 - 00:05:26.854, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:26.934 - 00:06:10.550, Speaker B: So MeV stands for maximum variable extractable and, sorry, maximal destructible value, and essentially consist on people trying to make money by leveraging from running transactions and things like that. So if you think about it, when you have a centralized sequencer, not only you have full control of how you order these transactions, but you have full control of the MeV. And this is something that I think is like the next generation of discussions that we need to have. Because right now I would say that there is general consensus about the risk of having a centralized sequencer and that we need a progressive decentralization of these sequencers.
00:06:10.582 - 00:06:10.966, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:11.070 - 00:06:19.902, Speaker B: But what happens with MeV? Do we want it? Do we not want it? What are the policies and what should we be demanding as a community?
00:06:19.998 - 00:06:20.254, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:20.294 - 00:07:07.314, Speaker B: From all of these l two s. Now, there is a variety of l two sequencers. If you look at it, at the literature, you will find that there are three main classifications, and I just paste here some of the features that you will commonly see. So essentially we have centralized sequencers. We have decentralized sequencers, which essentially what they do is try to replace this centralized party by another network of sequencers. And you have shared sequencers, in which essentially what you have is a network of sequencers that are serving multiple roll ups for ordering these transactions. And of course, there are some common things that you can say when you look at the literature.
00:07:07.314 - 00:07:55.192, Speaker B: One of them is that, of course, centralized sequencer, they should be more efficient because it's more simple, while they have a single point of failure. So there are risks associated, and of course there are trade offs. The same happens with decentralized sequencer, which you can argue there are less prone to single points of failure, but of course they introduce extra complexities, as we will see in these systems. And finally, for shared sequencers, yeah, you have a potential increase in throughput. That's something that I've seen on the literature, but I have not really seen any data that is showing me. Okay, I'm doing this experiment with these sequencers, and I can demonstrate to you that this is more efficient. There are good arguments, though, but not numbers.
00:07:55.192 - 00:08:50.064, Speaker B: Now, let's talk about each one of these types of sequencers. First of all, the centralized sequencer, like I mentioned before, essentially you send a transaction, you have one single particle controlling what is the order of these transactions. Then they send it to a roll up or the DA, and then you have the settlement. And essentially here, like I mentioned before, you will have a trade off of security and control versus also being more efficient. Right now, one thing that I mentioned before is that there is kind of consensus among different researchers and community that we should move towards decentralized sequencers. However, it has not been established how we should move towards decentralization of the sequencer. And it seems that there are like, obviously like different opinions and different directions.
00:08:50.064 - 00:09:05.692, Speaker B: But again, I would say that to move this discussion forward, we really need to start thinking about what is happening with Mev, because here what's happening is essentially that you have one central party that could take most of the meV.
00:09:05.748 - 00:09:06.084, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:06.164 - 00:09:50.724, Speaker B: And if you're kind of lost on how does the mev thing work, really is pretty simple. So imagine that you're a whale. I'm not a whale, but I can imagine that some of you might be. And you send a transaction to buy a large portion of tokens. So obviously you are expecting the price to go up, and the sequencer can detect this, and it could send a transaction to purchase those tokens before you. You will purchase those tokens and the price will go up, and the sequencer will have also the faculty to send then a transaction to sell those tokens, essentially extracting the value out of that large transaction. So that's like very broadly, very basically how this thing would work.
00:09:50.724 - 00:10:48.512, Speaker B: And we have seen that obviously this leads to attacks to these centralized sequencers. And in the past, if you look at the data, you will find that there was a time in which one of these big l two s had like 60% of attacks in terms of like the number of transactions by trying to extract meV. So it's really something that is something that we have to take seriously, but also something that there are ways to mitigate this. So when it comes to mitigating this risk, there are different policies that one can adopt. One of them is first come, first serve, another one would be MAV actions, right? And you will see these different communities going into different directions. However, we should be demanding more transparency when it comes to what is your MeV policy and why. Because not necessarily mev means something bad.
00:10:48.512 - 00:11:14.018, Speaker B: Maybe in some cases you want it. That's not up to me to decide. Now let's move into decentralized sequencers. So, decentralized sequencer, they have trade offs, just like a centralized sequencer. So here, like I mentioned before, you are replacing one single node by a network. But things get complicated. This is what this diagram here is trying to communicate.
00:11:14.018 - 00:11:54.966, Speaker B: I am not going to go over the details of what happens, which it steps once you send a transaction. This is diagram, by the way, for the medisl too. It's also not my purpose here to chill Medis in any way. It's just to illustrate that things get complicated quite easily. That's actually one of the reasons why you have not seen this sharp transition from centralization to decentralization of the sequencer. And another thing that I would like to communicate with regards to the decentralization of the sequencer is that it is also not a linear process in which you send your transaction. You have the sequencer.
00:11:54.966 - 00:12:38.874, Speaker B: The sequencer just reordered these transactions according to some policy that nobody really knows. And then it batches the transactions and that's it, right? It seems to be like, of course this is after that, the sequencer doesn't have any other role. But in between, when you look behind the hood, there are multiple things happening behind. You will have the sequencer sending this transaction to the breach and adapter to get to the consensus. Then you will have sending some data back, then you will have to verify, send to the l one, et cetera. So this is not really as simple as one can imagine from the previous diagrams that I showed to you. But here really what happens with Mev, I would say, is still an open question.
00:12:38.954 - 00:12:39.290, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:39.362 - 00:13:15.604, Speaker B: So we can talk about that later if you want. But now I would like to move forward towards talking about shared sequencer. So, shared sequencers, I've seen in the literature that they are gaining quite some popularity. So what is the basic idea behind this shared sequencer? So here you will have one network of sequencers. So it's a blockchain essentially, that serves multiple roll ups. So these rollups will connect somehow with this sequencer network. This sequencer network will have a specific policy about what is their mev.
00:13:15.604 - 00:13:52.278, Speaker B: Mev policy. And they will just make sure that the transactions get ordered in a certain way. And that's pretty much it, pretty much what they do. Then they batch the transactions and send it to the data availability layer. There are multiple examples, and variation of these architectures is not really the goal of this talk, like I mentioned. But what I do want to stress here is that this seems more efficient than having a decentralized sequencer. Because you have a network is decentralized, it is serving multiple roll ups instead of just one.
00:13:52.366 - 00:13:52.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:52.814 - 00:13:59.222, Speaker B: And because it is serving these multiple roll ups, you can think also about doing things with interoperability.
00:13:59.318 - 00:13:59.550, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:59.582 - 00:14:18.002, Speaker B: You have now connections between this roll up through this, at least through this shared sequencer. However, you are posing some risk in the sense that your roll up, your l two now has given up all of the sovereignty of the transaction order to an external party.
00:14:18.118 - 00:14:18.826, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:19.010 - 00:15:10.334, Speaker B: I don't know if everybody wants to do that. And I don't know what happens when the party here involved this shared sequencer network decides to change their policy towards mev, for instance. I have never seen any article discussing that. Maybe there are, but certainly it's something that we should be concerned about. So yeah, I'm getting to the end of my short presentation here and I just wanted to leave you with some thoughts about what could be the potential future of sequencers in L2 solutions. So, first of all, we have seen that there is this tendency to going towards decentralization of the sequencers. It is not really clear how yet, how are we going to get there.
00:15:10.334 - 00:15:26.962, Speaker B: It seems that this shared sequencer seems to be a nice option for many, despite the risk that I just described before. But one thing that I would like to see more and more is clarity when it comes to not only decentralization of these sequencers, but also the governance.
00:15:27.018 - 00:15:27.570, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:27.722 - 00:16:20.264, Speaker B: As soon as you decentralize something, you need to provide a governance framework on who is going to participate, what are going to be the requirements, who is going to be deciding this. And again, what is going to be the map policy behind all of this, then we can expect to see more and more of cross layer sequencing. So this is something that we are already seeing. And of course, this also presents other map opportunities, because imagine now that you want to do some arbitrage in different dexs that are in different l two s, maybe you can leverage cross layer sequencer for that end. But do we really want that? Again, that's one of the questions that I wanted for us to think about. And finally, well, there are things that we still don't know how they are going to be taking place. One is the use of artificial intelligence.
00:16:20.264 - 00:17:20.002, Speaker B: So of course, we have a process in which we are handling data and ordering things, and artificial intelligence is of course one alternative to do things more efficiently. But again, how do we want to do that? Still unclear. And when it comes to the role of Ck, for instance, let's think about sequencers, decentralized sequencers that are rotating. So they are rotating, but you need to verify one word or another that this is taking place. So Ck might be having a role there and in multiple order components that I might not be able to predict right now, but certainly is something that is worth thinking about. And the final message that I want to convey with all of these elements is that as we progress and l two adoption becomes, you know, wider and wider, and we see more and more. For instance, I think that today I checked the data for l two bit, and we have about 50 l two s, and there are like other 50 that are in review.
00:17:20.002 - 00:18:10.684, Speaker B: So it's getting crazy. It's getting like, a lot of these tools are coming, and what will be their policy for the sequencer? What will be their policy for the MeV? All of these factors together really are going to be given birth. What I would say is kind of like the sequencer economy, in which we really stop thinking about sequencers only in terms of, yeah, this is centralized, but we need to decentralize, but also in terms of what is the MEV landscape that we want to see. So that would be kind of all on my end. It was a little bit short, I realize now. But as a summary, what I want to convey here is obviously that sequencers are a key piece of l two s. And I hope that now you have a better idea of why this is so important, because it's tied up to Mev as well.
00:18:10.684 - 00:19:09.172, Speaker B: And again, here we have to ask ourselves some questions and ask to these protocols, to these l two s. Do we will, do we want fair Mev instruction? Do we not want Mev at all? Who should be allowed to do this? Who shouldn't be allowed to do this? Probably there are nuances and we want something in between. And then the next thing would be, what is going to happen with these shared sequencers? Or is something that is going to be adopted? Or in the end, we will have each l two with their own decentralized network. And how do we want to deal with that? So really, I appreciate everybody of you who took the time to listen to me. If you want to talk about other things related to the sequence, maybe related to Medis itself or maybe not related to any of that, but just want to have a veer and talk about life. I will be here until Tuesday. And yeah, I'm looking forward to connect with each of you.
00:19:09.172 - 00:19:17.744, Speaker B: Thank you. I see a question over there.
00:19:24.704 - 00:19:43.804, Speaker D: So I have one question, probably harsh questions regarding the censorship attack. Like for example, suppose there's a tornado cache that is deployed on one, L2. And how would the sequencer deal with the transactions that the fixable tornado cache contract on L2?
00:19:45.784 - 00:19:47.072, Speaker B: The question is about.
00:19:47.168 - 00:19:50.160, Speaker D: Okay, I understood the part of the sensor should attack.
00:19:50.312 - 00:19:51.352, Speaker B: Perfect, perfect.
00:19:51.448 - 00:19:55.888, Speaker D: Great. On the L2, like contract cache.
00:19:55.936 - 00:20:38.500, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So I forgot to mention that, by the way. But essentially there are multiple ways in which they can deal with censorship, resistance. For instance, when you go to the shared sequencer, if you have your l two and you commit to that, you lost your sovereignty and you lose any rights to do any kind of censorship or deal with that. You just leave that word to the decentralized network. But if you're dealing with a centralized sequencer, then you have more possibilities to deal with that. And we have seen, actually in the documentation of some of these l two s, they have like ways in which you can bypass the sequencer if it gets stalled.
00:20:38.532 - 00:20:38.700, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:38.732 - 00:20:43.544, Speaker B: So you can essentially find ways in which you can send the transaction directly to the l two.
00:20:44.444 - 00:20:45.884, Speaker D: Like force execution.
00:20:45.964 - 00:20:46.324, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:46.404 - 00:20:47.144, Speaker D: Okay.
00:20:56.694 - 00:21:28.570, Speaker E: I have a quick question on l two economics. Maybe you can share your thoughts. If you think about how like, an l two makes money, there's, you know, two ways. There's the mev revenue and there's transaction fees and transaction fees. I assume that's a race to zero. So there's going to be super tiny margins left. So in that sense, semiv will be the only revenue source for this l two.
00:21:28.570 - 00:21:52.874, Speaker E: And there's also like, you know, like different valuation frameworks for blockchains where like where the new valuations are calculated based on mev revenue, not like, not fees. So do you think these l two s would even want to give this mev revenue away? Are they even incentivized to adopt this shared sequencer model?
00:21:53.454 - 00:22:06.254, Speaker B: That's a great question. That was actually the purpose of my talk, to have these kind of questions. And like I mentioned before, there are multiple angles here and perspectives. I'm going to be sharing mine.
00:22:06.294 - 00:22:06.638, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:06.726 - 00:22:19.874, Speaker B: So right now, the way I see it is if you have a centralized sequencer, I don't see like kind of big incentives for them to move towards decentralized sequencers if they can get them meV.
00:22:19.954 - 00:22:20.362, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:20.458 - 00:22:26.898, Speaker B: And like you mentioned, as the transaction fees goes lower and lower, their margins become also smaller.
00:22:26.946 - 00:22:27.534, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:27.834 - 00:23:24.620, Speaker B: So I don't think they have big incentives for that. And that's one of the reasons why I think we should really start demanding to have some clarity on what is your map policy, because it makes sense for some cases to actually want that under center conditions, as long as it doesn't damage the network in some ways, maybe it's a free market and you can roll with it. And when it comes to the more decentralized aspect, think about, for instance, on Metis. On Metis, what we did is to decentralize this. Now anyone that wants to run a sequencer can in principle send a proposal, and if they meet the requirements, essentially they could be part of the network. And then what happens with MeV can they do, because they will have the option to do that. Can they do that? Can they not do that? Those are the kind of policies that we should be thinking about and establishing.
00:23:24.620 - 00:24:31.384, Speaker B: Actually, when it comes to Medis, as far as I know, there is no public, you know, public announcement on how we want to deal with that. I personally think that it should be allowed under certain specific conditions. But I also don't want to see that, you know, we get into a phase in which we are Promev or not Promev, because that's really not something productive for us as a community. What I would really like to see is that we get to a point in which we have balance, right? We have balance in which, okay, we have something that, it makes sense from the point of view of the network to profit a little bit from this, but also it makes sense to have all of these ground rules so that people do not see their transactions getting higher fees or they do not see their transactions getting revoked or not being included, things like that. So balance, that would be my personal take. So good.
00:24:32.724 - 00:24:44.420, Speaker A: All right, so if there are no further questions, as Victor said, he will be here till Tuesday, so you'll have plenty of time. Exactly. Thank you all. Victor Munoz.
00:24:44.532 - 00:24:44.884, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
