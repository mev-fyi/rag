00:00:15.680 - 00:00:48.964, Speaker A: Okay, so can you hear me? Hi everyone. Thank you for having me today. My name is Tomo, co founder CEO at Faiza Network. I'll be speaking about optimistic layer to interoperability protocol once again. Let me introduce myself. My name is Tomo Coffin, the CEO at Faison Network. I founded the first company and developed run to run protocol rent, a platform called Proof of running in 2018.
00:00:48.964 - 00:01:10.948, Speaker A: And I started it 2022. Yeah, and then I co founded phase network at the same year. And yeah, my robin is japanese anime actually. Yeah, I'm from Japan, so. Oh yeah. So are there any japanese anime rapper here? Yeah. Thank you so much.
00:01:10.948 - 00:01:48.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to actually. Yeah, we had anime t shirts today, but I lost my baggage in the airport. Yeah, it's okay. So, yeah, so, okay. Anyway, so let me introduce about phasor network briefly. So Phasor network is an optimistic layer to interoperability protocol. So we have over, we have integrated with over ten layout networks, both optimistic roll app and ZK roll wrap, and then recent trend hybrid optimistic decalore.
00:01:48.954 - 00:02:43.504, Speaker A: And we are supported by the Esurum Foundation. Optimism foundation as a rare two interpretability protocol. We also provide air to run social running hub specialized for L2 technology. So Raya two has integrated into optimistic roll up based networks at this time, such as optimism arbitram or base and so on. Users can issue solvent token certificates for taking a curriculum about reactive technology, such as automatic bridge or interpreter or something else. Yeah, let's get into the main topic. Before discussing layout interoperability, let's take a look at recent trend.
00:02:43.504 - 00:03:41.064, Speaker A: I understand, as you know all, but yeah, last year was the first year of L2, in my opinion, and it's still fresh in our memory that 2022 2020 was the first year of layer one. For example, Solana Avalanche finance or something. And many Rayya one is rapidly grew due to the emergence of ethereum's scalability problem. But the following year, Reya one interoperability became a problem in 2021 or something. And then in 2022, Raya two grew rapidly to improve the scalability of Ethereum. But interoperability became a shuffle issue again. So that was last year, and it remains a problem this year.
00:03:41.064 - 00:04:33.884, Speaker A: In addition, there has been a rapid increase in networks recognized as Raya three recently. So Raya three interoperability will be a problem in the future. I mean, the next year or the after next year. So yeah, I understand, you know, all these problems, but the challenge for L2 and layer three is interoperability between networks using different roll up frameworks. For example, interoperability between such as Mod using op stacks and x ray using polygon CDK. As you know, all, both are EVM compatible and built on Ethereum. I mean, the interoperability itself is not a serious problem.
00:04:33.884 - 00:05:45.544, Speaker A: I mean, the problem is the high gas fee and slow speed of cross network transaction, like cross chain transactions. So this means that users have to use a lot of their assets as gas fee or lose their opportunity, for example, for arbitrage across networks or something else. So the phraser network's optimistic interoperability protocol, specialized for L2, solve this problem. The phasor network protocol incorporates an optimistic roll up mechanism into the interoperability for L2. So, I mean, specifically, the protocol doesn't verify normal transaction, but only verify the transactions suspected or fraud. So the optimistic protocol only verifies transactions requested by a validator called dispute in the pheasant protocol. So this means that the majority of transactions are recorded to the network without being verified.
00:05:45.544 - 00:06:15.794, Speaker A: So I think you will understand better if you actually see the demo than if I explain it in words. So, yeah, please note this pheasant is an optimistic protocol. So if the demo doesn't work, let's be optimistic. Yeah. So what you should look for when seeing the demo is speed and gas fee. Speed and low gas fee. So let's go.
00:06:15.794 - 00:07:01.798, Speaker A: This is, yeah, this is our bridge interface built using the phasant optimistic protocol. So let's try the bridge between optimism and base as an example here. So you can see super cheap and super fast. Just one moment. Yeah, that's all. So this is the power of optimistic protocol. Here is a table comparing to other bridge projects in terms of constant speed using other interoperability protocol.
00:07:01.798 - 00:07:39.284, Speaker A: So, in theory, an optimistic protocol, like a bridge or something, is the most cost effective and fastest compared to any other bridge bridges. So this figure is from a few months ago. So this means recent product shredding has made it even cheaper now. Oh, yeah. This is my opinion. So I understand that Zika is still hot topic. So naturally, some of you may be wondering how it compares to Zika bridge.
00:07:39.284 - 00:08:46.809, Speaker A: So, Ziki bridge is a protocol that allows a specific state change that occurs in one network, to be proven in the other network by using Zika snarks. So it's unique in that it allows communication between all networks because it can improve state change rather than application specific communication. In other words, although it's called zkbridge, it can be applied to messaging communication between networks as well as bridges. So maybe, you know, but there is a published Berkeley research paper on Ziki bridge from which mask can be run. So yeah, the conclusion is that practical application is still in the future in my opinion. But the results of performance tests have been published and briefly presented here. So the table of performance tests in this paper is included.
00:08:46.809 - 00:10:03.764, Speaker A: So this performance test was not a bridge between Raya two, but rather there are more challenging cosmos and ethereum messaging communication. So maybe. Sorry, yeah, it may be a little hard to see there, but the results were that it took about 20 seconds to generate the proof as well. ZK proof, I mean the size of the proof was 131 bytes and the gas fee for the verification was 200 to 27k gas, roughly ten us dollar calculated at 20 g way. So my personal impression is that neither the speed nor the gas fee is very effective for using ZK for the bridge or interoperability transactions. So I'm like expecting ZK four layer to Zk roll up or something. After much research, we came up with the concept of bars stand for bridge as a service to solve Raya two interoperability problem.
00:10:03.764 - 00:11:16.794, Speaker A: So yeah, the Sidoria bus stands for bridge as a service is an abstraction of the optimistic interoperability protocol down to the application layer. I mean the DapPs decentralized application. So Bas allows developers to focus on application development without worrying about network fragmentation and other infrastructure inconvenience. So by incorporating phasant networks, bus solution applications can optimistically execute cross network transactions. For example, cross network transactions such as purchasing NFT on optimism with ease on arbitram can be executed instantly with logacy. Yeah, this is our overview of bus bridges. Service restricting and rs roll up as a service are the recent trend, but the ecosystem can exist without them anyway.
00:11:16.794 - 00:12:11.996, Speaker A: So brows exist between the application layer and the infrastructure layer and can be set to abstract the the infrastructure for applications. So I mean, it plays a particularly strong role in abstracting the fragmentation of the execution layer. For example. Yeah, roll up the optimism ob stack or mobile stack or something. And then we believe that this can be integrated into both monolithic and modular blockchain trend. So the phasor network is currently an interoperability protocol focused on L2. This is because L2 can verify transactions with just Brock header and block hash.
00:12:11.996 - 00:13:22.214, Speaker A: So this diagram illustrates transaction validation in optimistic protocol. So the transactions in ethereum stored in blocks, technically block headers and eventually output as block hash. So since this is hash data, it goes with the saying that changing the data will output a different block hash. In other words, the consistency between the information in the block where the interoperability transaction is stored and the information is in the block hash is verified. So as you can see, the information contained in the block is extensive, making the fee of verification so high. And with optimistic protocol, the gas fee can be significantly reduced because the sequence of events is verified only when an irregularity occurs. So this is a very simple and secure mechanism because just block header and block hash, as I said earlier, are required for transactions in SRAM.
00:13:22.214 - 00:13:56.728, Speaker A: While transaction verification, interoperability between the other, a one chain and ethereum, for example, between avalanche and ethereum or Solana and ethereum is a completely different process. So this is exactly why pheasant offers interoperability specifically for REIA two. Finally. Yeah, regarding the. Sorry, the challenges. Ethereum limits the number of blocks. It's 2056 blocks.
00:13:56.728 - 00:14:30.044, Speaker A: So this means that if an irregularity occurs at the optimistic protocol, the regularity must be noted within around 1 hour. Technically. 50, 51. 51st minutes. Yeah. So the diagram shows that all transactions with fraud mint were not captured in the block and eventually output of the brock hash. In other words, the brocache must be referenced to verify the transaction.
00:14:30.044 - 00:15:13.154, Speaker A: But in the case of Ethereum, the brocade can only be referenced up to 22 56 blocks ago, during which time it must be verified where the transaction is, fragment or not. However. Yeah. Solutions to solve this challenge are already being developed. For example, Axiom is developing protocols that will allow for block hash of more than 200 6256 blocks. Yeah. Thank you for your listening today.
00:15:13.154 - 00:15:42.694, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, feel free to ask me anything now or after this session, this venue. Thank you so much. Thank you. Are there any japanese anime rubber? No. Okay, let's talk about. Thank you.
