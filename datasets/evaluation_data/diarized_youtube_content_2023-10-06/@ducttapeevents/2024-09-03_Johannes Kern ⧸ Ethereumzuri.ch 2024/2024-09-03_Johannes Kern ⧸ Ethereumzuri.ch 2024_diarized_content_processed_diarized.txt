00:00:06.440 - 00:00:34.182, Speaker A: My name is Johannes, I'm one of the founders of Nariv Network. And today I was talking here at Ethereum Zurich about why web3 is still using web two to automate stuff. And you know, why this is bad and what we can do about that. And that is really my topic. Right. We automate stuff in web3. And our big goal, as you might be able to read here, is we make web3 SoC lessons really help builders to find new solutions to do that also, we do tacos.
00:00:34.182 - 00:01:14.000, Speaker A: So, you know, I think any of you have seen a bunch of them at those different conferences. So we travel around the world, we build our community of builders and we do events with tacos. Today is not going to be tacos, but always bringing that to Zurich as well. It's East Zurich. It is. If I look at the crypto events happening in Switzerland, and a large one being the Crypto Valley conference and the CV summit in Souk, which are a lot more on service providers and on sales, I really appreciate what you guys do that it is a builder's event, really, and I chose and that's where I feel comfortable and that's where I feel, yeah, value is really added because new things start to be.
