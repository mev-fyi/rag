00:00:00.520 - 00:00:18.194, Speaker A: Nice to see everyone. Thanks for invite. So, a couple of words about myself. My name is Rasteslav. I'm a CTO at a protocol called asymmetrics. It's defi protocol. We will talk about it a bit later.
00:00:18.194 - 00:00:59.928, Speaker A: So also, one more thing that I would like to share is that I have a community in Ukraine. I'm originally from Ukraine and I have Ethereum community in Kyiv. We are doing regular meetups, workshops and so on. Usually it's like a monthly basis, and if someone wants to share any kind of knowledge and so on with ukrainian people, I'm glad to invite you to be a speaker or contribute in any way you want. Or you can. Yes. So, okay, here we go.
00:00:59.928 - 00:01:44.810, Speaker A: So today we will speak a bit about LSD management and how to keep the best story for your stake teaser. So LSD is a really hot topic right now. And let's. So what is LSD? Liquid staking derivatives. So basically, every proof of stake chain allows you to stake the native asset of the blockchain to validate the blocks. And actually for this, you require to run a node to become a validator. And it could be really a problem for the regular users in terms of Ux.
00:01:44.810 - 00:02:45.816, Speaker A: It could be complicated and so on and so forth. So basically, what people did, they actually go and say, okay, if you don't want to validate, if you don't want to become a validator, if it's too complicated for you, we can do it for you, but you will pay for us a small fee and we will earn, but you will don't need to do anything. You just need to convert your ether or any other assets like Matic, or any asset of the proof of stake blockchain, and we take for you, and then you will get the rewards, but we will get a small fee. So that's how it works. What you can do with your LSD, with your liquid staking derivative. So basically, you can just stake and hold. So stake means you just convert your, for example, iser to stake iser and hold it in your wallet, and you just can keep and earn the rewards.
00:02:45.816 - 00:03:41.144, Speaker A: So there is almost no risks. You just hold the risk of the protocol itself, for example, of the lido or any other staking protocol. So what also you can do, you can basically use your LSD in DeFi. You can actually use it as a collateral, for example, in such protocols like AAVE, and basically take a loan. But here you introduce new risks for yourself. Basically, your position could be liquidated, but if you are knowing what to do so you can actually raise your, raise your yield percentage per year. And also you can participate in some liquidity mining with LSD.
00:03:41.144 - 00:04:25.624, Speaker A: I guess it's the highest risk on the market if someone, for example, shares some tokens for your LSD. You always need to check what's going on in this protocol, why these people share some incentivizations for your LSD and so on, and why they pay you money just for your LSG. So you need to check it. So it always needs to be researched from your site before you go to do some liquidity mining. So let's take a look at the current market state. Of course, we have Alaido, who is the best for now on the market. It has the biggest market share, which is 74%.
00:04:25.624 - 00:05:12.018, Speaker A: And basically in terms of global liquid staking derivatives, which we have, I think liquid staking derivatives takes like 10% of the wall ethers staked on Ethereum. So it's basically more or less 50% of the market. And Lido has like 32 or 33% of the, of the total stake, etcetera, in Ethereum. Do you see any kind of problem here? I see. So we sacrifice a lot the decentralization of Ethereum right now. Yeah. And actually there are no ways how to solve it for now yet.
00:05:12.018 - 00:06:10.354, Speaker A: So there are some proposals. For example, there was a proposal on lido side, like to make a self limit, but actually holders of LDO, they voted that they don't want to limit themselves, they want to keep earning more and so on. And that's okay. So we need to introduce some new ways how we could solve this problem. Of course, we need to teach people how to stake, how to run a solo validator, because it's important for Ethereum system and so on and so on. But of course, if we cannot force people to become a solo validator because it introduces risk for you that you could be slashed, you could pay some fine if you do something wrong. And the UX, in terms of solace solar stakers is really not good for now.
00:06:10.354 - 00:07:04.240, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the problem. But that's actually not topic of our, today's speech. But anyway, this is the problem and we don't have a great solution. For now, let's take a look where the most staked ether is sitting on the market. So first of all, if you go check on chain, if you go and check on either scan, we will see that the biggest amount of stake teaser, of course, is an rubbed stake teaser. Because of the nature of stake teaser, it's rebased asset and rebased assets is pretty much complicated to support by Defi. So people usually support up staked ether.
00:07:04.240 - 00:07:56.904, Speaker A: But there are some protocols like Ava and curve, who actually solved this problem. And basically you can use your stack teaser and curve and aave. So as we see, the most popular protocols, which keeps the biggest circle agent supply of stack teaser is curve, Aave and also Libra finance. On the fifth place, if you take a look at rap teaser, sitting in the maker Dao in Aave, again in some bridge and some, actually some whale is keeping like 120,000 of wrapped stake teaser. I don't know, just a wallet. And also we have a balancer. Of course, you know most of these protocols.
00:07:56.904 - 00:08:26.516, Speaker A: So let's take a look at the staking API, different DeFi protocols. It's a bit boring because Aave doesn't, as I checked, like, Aave doesn't pay any interest for the stack teaser. Curve is like, you know, generating some fee on the pools. It's like more or less two or 3% and so on. Libra is more interesting, but it's like high risk. Yeah. So you can go and check, make it, make your dao.
00:08:26.516 - 00:09:03.530, Speaker A: I don't know. I was not able to find the original API. And so the asymmetrics is actually our protocol, which we built. We will speak about it a bit later, but for now it's like 20% APY in our governance token I six. And plus we give an ability to win a lot of yield. So Makerdao, our balancer, you all know better than me, and it's a bit boring. So let's take a look at something interesting.
00:09:03.530 - 00:09:45.474, Speaker A: So what actually, people, when they build some kind of LSD Phi protocols, what they usually do, they basically separate your body of the assets and the yield you are generating from LSD. This is the scheme of one of the protocols on the market. Anyone could help me with the name of this protocol? No, sorry. Any other? No. Maybe they are similar. Yeah, but this is. It was originally from Pendlet Finance.
00:09:45.474 - 00:10:47.612, Speaker A: If someone like, it's actually separate the yields and. And you can buy, for example, you can go and buy even just a yield and hold it. If you think that it will be higher than originally estimated, you can buy it, hold it, and then you can earn more. And also you can just buy the asset itself without the yield, which is more or less interesting. Yeah. The second option is to not only separate your body and the yield, but the guys going further and what they do with this, basically they use your body of the asset and mint as a collateral and mint some stablecoin. And basically on the yield, they bind their own stablecoin from the market and actually share all the profits between their stablecoin holders.
00:10:47.612 - 00:11:17.424, Speaker A: Can anyone help me with this name of this protocol? Libra. Yeah, correct. So this is Libra finance, but there are additional risks about the liquidations. If you use your ether as a collateral, of course you could be liquidated, but. Yeah, and this is the cert option. So basically, let's say. So these people introduced the new concept.
00:11:17.424 - 00:11:43.330, Speaker A: Basically, they also separate the body of Iser and the yield. But the yield, they actually draw between like, participants, you know, and three of the. For example, three winners win all the yield generated from the pool. Anyone could help me with this? Yeah. Thank you. You are the rockstar today. Okay.
00:11:43.330 - 00:12:20.704, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is our protocol we built. Basically, the concept is easier. People just deposit their ether to the pool, and basically your ether keeps with. You can anytime you can withdraw, but you don't generate regular yield for your assets, but you get a chance to win a lot of e cert generated by the whole pool. So what is it? So basically, it's simply premium bonds on chain. This concept originally was born in UK.
00:12:20.704 - 00:13:01.098, Speaker A: Yeah. There are a lot of people who participate in such instrument. It's like a premium bonds, basically to introduce the great way for people to save some money so they could just participate in premium bonds and get a chance to win a lot of yield generated, for example, in one week and one month. It depends. So why the asymmetrics? Because if you want to receive your guaranteed yield, you don't need to use asymmetrics. If you just want to keep your boring 4.5% or 5% per year, it's okay.
00:13:01.098 - 00:13:30.112, Speaker A: Let's say you have ten ethers, you have like 5% more or less, and in one year you will get 0.5 ease. If it's something that is interesting for you, of course you can keep it, it's not a problem. But if you want something bigger, you can use asymmetrics. Of course, you need to get some luck, but in general, it could give you more than 5% in the year. So let's say you have ten acer and you win. You won several times.
00:13:30.112 - 00:14:12.774, Speaker A: For example, today we had a draw and we distributed almost eight esers in one week between the pool holder, between the winners, which is a lot. So you would be able to earn actually like four or ether in a draw. But it also depends on the pool size, of course. So you can expect 5% more than 5% API and asymmetrics. But you can also expect zero if you, if you're not lucky. So the ability to withdraw funds anytime, that's basically we don't lock your funds. You can, you can deposit, you can withdraw at any time.
00:14:12.774 - 00:14:49.924, Speaker A: And also this is the excitement of the process. Yes. So you can take a look, you can be lucky and you can win a lot of Acer. What else is interesting is that for now, we launched one month and I think 15 days before. And currently we have incentivization program in our governance stock in I six. And the current yield in our protocol is 20% by ASX tokens. So you can just participate in the pool and get just 20% for free.
00:14:49.924 - 00:15:35.232, Speaker A: It will be still alive for almost two months more. So you get a chance to win an ether of the pool and also you guaranteed get the yield in AsIcs tokens. So how it works, basically, user deposits their staked ether. So for now we support only staked teaser. But we have plans to support more different liquid staking tokens. So you deposit your stake teaser and you get a pull share token in ratio, one to one, and get it also actually on your wallet. Right.
00:15:35.232 - 00:16:02.440, Speaker A: So the minimum deposit is 0.1. Stake teaser. Yeah. So the second step, when you deposited, you actually participating in a draw. Current draw is like one week period. We are waiting one week. The pool generates the yield from the wall pool, from the wall users, stake teaser deposited.
00:16:02.440 - 00:16:30.678, Speaker A: And basically how the Lido works, they pay the rewards every day. Yeah. So we do, we wait for seven kind of rebates from Lidar and then we do a draw. So when we waited one week, we distribute the yield between the users. We choose the winners. For now, you know, it's configurable. We can set more than three winners.
00:16:30.678 - 00:17:11.084, Speaker A: For now it's three. And for now we wait one week. But we can configure this. It could be even daily rewards. You know, we can pay still, if we have like more than more stack teaser in the pool, we would be able to do rewards more often than one week because the pools in one day, for example, already will be huge. For now, we have more or less 19 millions of dollars in the pool, which is kind of good because we are alive a bit more than one month. So, yeah, how we choose the winners, we use Chainlink VRF, which is obvious solution for the Ethereum, of course.
00:17:11.084 - 00:17:47.034, Speaker A: Yeah, for the Ethereum ecosystem. So that's the best way for now to choose the random numbers. How do winners receive their rewards? So basically if you sit in the pool, you don't need to do anything. You just, if you want to. For example, you won and you want to just keep going and sitting in the protocol so you don't do anything. You just sitting and watching. And your amount, which you won already participating in the next draw and it's the part of your position already.
00:17:47.034 - 00:18:20.074, Speaker A: So you don't need to do anything. You can just deposit, wait one year and then in one year you withdraw everything you have with all you want. So that's basically really comfortable in terms of weeks and how to withdraw your initial deposit. So you just need to click a button. There is nothing specific. You just click a button. You basically burn your pull share tokens and you get back your stack teaser.
00:18:20.074 - 00:18:59.370, Speaker A: So we have a dao. Of course, for now it's off chain. We have plans to do it on chain. For now it's on snapshot. And we will introduce some proposals soon. So the people who have I six on their balances, they could of course participate in the votings and I mean get the chance to improve our protocol, even could give some proposals and so on. But this is nothing special.
00:18:59.370 - 00:19:51.248, Speaker A: Basically that's the standard way how usually people do a dao. So what is interesting here is that we do have a time lock. What is time lock for those who don't know, basically we cannot do right now. We cannot do any changes right away. So to do some changes in the protocol, we have a multisig which is owner of course, because we are off chainedao, we take the voting results and then we have a multi three stakeholders. And then let's say we take voting results, we send it here, but the changes is not introduced right away. We need to wait 12 hours before it's done because we have a time block.
00:19:51.248 - 00:20:45.694, Speaker A: And then if someone, for example, does not agree with these changes, they could withdraw their money from the protocol before 12 hours. And that's actually the proper way how to do the changes in your protocol. So our future plans is basically first of all we have an idea how to incentivize the ASICS holders. Yeah, we would like to introduce some utility for our token, of course for our governance token except just voting in the DAO. So our idea is to multiply ASX holder odds. Odds is your chances in the protocol. To win the ether in the protocol by specific coefficient depends on asics amount.
00:20:45.694 - 00:21:41.538, Speaker A: Let's say you have like 1 million asics. If you have 1 million I six and you have some position, you have, let's say you have 1% of chance of win of the ether during the draw. If you have, let's say, 1 million I six, it's just an example. The numbers would be really different, but we can multiply your chance by coefficient one, dot one, for example. And in this case, even if you don't have a lot of iser share in the pool, but you have asics, you get more chance to win. So that's how we see we could incentivize ESX holders in our protocol also. So the idea is to create the template of the pool, allowing small size is holders to join asymmetrics pool together and participate in the draw.
00:21:41.538 - 00:22:50.294, Speaker A: So, for example, right now the pool contains 10,000 1200 staked ether. If you have one either, it would be really a small chance to win. And it's like, I would not say it's impossible, but it's really hard to win something. So what is the idea is that you can create a pool and join with your friends who also have, I don't know, ten ether, 20 ether, and you can become like a huge pool, like 300, 500 ether with your friends. And then this pool will be participating in the draws, and basically your chance will be higher. But whenever your pool wins, you distribute all the winnings proportionally between all the pool holders, and it increases your actually chance to win, but it decreases, of course, your winning number. But it's supposed that you would win more often than you just send your one ether.
00:22:50.294 - 00:23:38.886, Speaker A: Of course, we have plans to migrate to more decentralized architecture, for example, to Gelada network if someone aware of it or something similar. Because for now we have open zeppelin defender after tasks is good, but not enough decentralized, in my opinion. So we have plans, of course, for the on chain Dow creation. And we would also introduce the balancer, 80% to 20% model liquidity pool for I six token. So that's actually our plans for the near future for the asymmetrics protocol. You can follow me on Twitter. I recently started to do some tweets.
00:23:38.886 - 00:24:11.014, Speaker A: It's really complicated, even more complicated than speak here right now. So, yeah, if you want, you can scan, follow. That's it. Thank you. Any questions? We have time for about one. Okay, I guess no questions, right? Yeah. Okay.
00:24:11.014 - 00:24:13.834, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. Have a nice day.
