00:00:11.800 - 00:00:24.790, Speaker A: Okay. Can you hear me? Okay. You guys hear me? Yeah. There we are. All right. Hello, everyone. I'm James Glascock.
00:00:24.790 - 00:00:51.300, Speaker A: I'm from Reserve protocol. I head ecosystem. Before we kick off, I'm going to show you a video. It's about 90 seconds, so enjoy. If we have the video ready to queue up, I just want to settle for once and for all, the point that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. They ran out of money and they needed more, so they printed more, a lot more.
00:00:51.452 - 00:01:02.388, Speaker B: The prices go up for almost everybody in almost every country. This happens every year, every decade, every century. The prices just keep going up.
00:01:02.476 - 00:01:07.988, Speaker C: But what if that's not how money worked? What if your purchasing power could stay the same through time?
00:01:08.076 - 00:01:09.984, Speaker B: Hi, you're meeting the reserve project.
00:01:10.324 - 00:01:18.304, Speaker C: We want a world of asset backed currency. We want a world where your wealth is stored across a diverse range of tokenized assets.
00:01:18.844 - 00:02:08.644, Speaker B: An asset backed currency built on the reserve protocol is called an r token, and it runs on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Every r token that gets minted is backed by the appropriate back of assets. Arpay is an app for Android and iOS. Today, all balances in Arpay are in us dollars. Since the only stablecoin you can hold with it right now is RSV and RSV is pegged to the US dollar, can you actually create a currency that doesn't inflate, that doesn't have this problem of price inflation? We think that the answer is maybe yes.
00:02:14.464 - 00:02:39.848, Speaker A: I wanted to show you that so you could get a sense of where we're coming from. This presentation is not about reserve protocol, though. It's about a different topic. It's about something that I've been calling the long tail of stablecoins. But I think it's helpful to see kind of a little bit of background on where we're coming from, and maybe at the end, I'll just talk a little bit about reserve. So, before we begin, you can scan the QR code. The deck is available.
00:02:39.848 - 00:03:10.404, Speaker A: You can copy the deck, fork it, do whatever you'd like to do with it. You can dive into the discord and connect with people in the reserve community if you'd like to do that as well. I'm James Glasscock. I'm head of ecosystem at Reserve. And let's see. Reserve's mission is to increase adoption of and expand access to sustainable, inflation proof currency around the world. I should probably use the clicker.
00:03:10.404 - 00:03:49.856, Speaker A: Okay. What is a long tail? Long tail represents the significant demand for niche products that emerge in the digital age of online markets. The y axis is popularity and the x axis is the number of products. Before the digital revolution of the nineties, most industries were relegated to only making hits in order to survive. Everything was driven by gatekeepers. The long tail was also an essay in 2004, and it became a book in 2006 by a guy named Chris Anderson. He was the editor of Wired magazine at the time.
00:03:49.856 - 00:04:05.884, Speaker A: And. And you might be familiar with some of his other products he invented or created. Ted talks. Whoops. See if we get. Oh, ok, moving. All right.
00:04:05.884 - 00:04:50.894, Speaker A: Long tail markets have different expansion stages. The first stage is they democratize the tools of production, so more stuff lengthens the tail. Second stage is they democratize the tools of distribution. More access flattens the tail. And the third stage is they connect supply and demand, which drives business from hits to niche. Now, I keep saying they, but who am I talking about? Well, in web one and two, it's centralized corporations. But in the next generation, Internet of ownership and value, some call it web3.
00:04:50.894 - 00:05:21.378, Speaker A: The they is us or we open source. And composability is a force multiplier for the long tail. Let's dive in. There's already 100 plus stablecoins in existence. This is Vitalik's stablecoin categorization. He published an essay in December where he talked about the things that he was excited about in the Ethereum ecosystem. It's a really cool framework.
00:05:21.378 - 00:06:00.004, Speaker A: He dives into the three categories. First category being centralized. Second category, dow governed, real world asset backed. And the third category being governance minimized. Crypto asset backed, centralized. Stablecoins today make up over 95% of the market share. But dare I be cliche and say it's really early, when I think about the long tail of stablecoins, why would there be? Why do we need more than one? And what we're already seeing is there are lots of different jobs to be done.
00:06:00.004 - 00:06:22.584, Speaker A: These are ten of the very popular stablecoins today. They each have different jobs to be done. Tether was the first. It provided a safe haven for traders, and it was bootstrapped by Bitfinex USDC. Very similar. Came along a few years later. More regulatory, transparent.
00:06:22.584 - 00:07:03.702, Speaker A: Also bootstrapped by Poloniex and Coinbase at the time. Frax is an on chain hedge fund for Defi, Maxis, owl USD. The one at the bottom is a pretty cool bridge. Stablecoin for people accessing, self repaying loans. Different jobs to be done. How did we get here? So the tyranny of physical space, you can kind of feel it just by looking at the image, right? It's self explanatory, but it's not very fair. And sometimes it becomes the basis for war.
00:07:03.702 - 00:07:47.014, Speaker A: People fight over space, they fight over land, they fight over assets. But this is an industrial age paradigm. Old days were less fair. Prior to the printing press in 1440, knowledge and history were controlled by monks and scribes, accessible to a few. Prior to 1994, when the commercial Internet started to blossom, everything was available for free in the yellow Pages. Actually, it wasn't everything, it was just for a few things that passed the gatekeepers. And ultimately it wasn't free either.
00:07:47.014 - 00:08:26.900, Speaker A: Prior to 2008, pre bitcoin, we only had the fiat standard at scale, and the 99% get rugged. It's still happening today. Fiat money is not working for the everyman. The Green line is the purchasing power of the US dollar. The red line is us government debt, which is now just above $31 trillion in the United States. Today's dollar bought about four times more in the eighties and about eight times more in the seventies. Everywhere.
00:08:26.900 - 00:09:24.944, Speaker A: This is the same chart you saw in the video. This is inflation across 30 countries since 1960. Right now, there's about five countries worldwide with an inflation rate greater than 100% and 23 countries exceeding 20%. The cost of sending a $200 international remittance can be as high as eight to $34, depending on the corridor. Getting credit may depend on the gray markets, and sometimes results in unfair loans, data theft, harassment and physical harm. The need for safe, stable currency has never been more important. So how do we create stable and fair currencies that retain their value indefinitely? We need to run a lot of experiments, and not all of them are going to succeed.
00:09:24.944 - 00:10:03.734, Speaker A: There's something we can learn from other industries, though. Other industries that adopted digital production and distribution and connected supply and demand. Thanks to those technologies, what's about to happen in digital money has already happened in other industries. We'll take a look at shopping, broadcasting and mobile apps. Shopping. This is 1980s. We mostly congregated in malls with a limited number of stores and products that again were approved by the gatekeepers.
00:10:03.734 - 00:10:28.664, Speaker A: This is the tyranny of physical space. Today, there are over 1 million merchants on the Shopify platform alone. Broadcasting. In the 1980s, launching a broadcast channel cost tens of millions of dollars. It took years to launch. Today, anyone can do it for free in just a few minutes. I can tell you.
00:10:28.664 - 00:11:26.784, Speaker A: In 2005, I was at Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta, Georgia, and being the kind of incumbent gatekeeper, they laughed at YouTube. I was there. YouTube was not considered anything to be serious. Now, YouTube is a far larger business than Turner Broadcasting mobile apps. The OG phone app was talking on the phone, then we got SMS texting, and now there's over 2 million apps in the App Store. What do you think happens when we get a true web3 App Store at scale? So in all of those three examples, what happened? Well, it's free tools, creativity, infinite distribution and incentives. Does it sound familiar? It's already happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:11:26.784 - 00:12:22.252, Speaker A: Remember those long tail market expansion stages earlier in the slides? I think it was slide four. Democratize tools of production, democratize the tools of distribution, and connect supply and demand. What is especially unique this time, though, is decentralization and composability, which is a really powerful force for expansion to occur faster than we've ever seen in history. Okay, back to money. The applications of industrial age money are fairly basic. They're ingrained in our lives, just like fax machines were 30 years ago and horses were 100 years ago. Digital age money, though, provides something new, expressive programmability.
00:12:22.252 - 00:12:45.856, Speaker A: There are a lot of different ways to sort of frame this. This is the one I chose when I made the slide. But in the digital age, programmability changes everything. Dilemmas and trilemmas for sure, get more complex. It depends on what you want to prioritize. It depends on what the specific job is to be done. Take for example, branding.
00:12:45.856 - 00:13:12.284, Speaker A: In the bottom right, one you might think is the least important on this slide. But the US dollar is a brand. It's actually one of the greatest memes in history. Some of the folks in this room are ethereans, maybe some are bitcoiners. Maybe there's even some lunatics left. Delta sky miles. That's the brand of their money.
00:13:12.284 - 00:13:44.510, Speaker A: Roblox has branded their money robux. The casinos in Monaco started branding their money hundreds of years ago. Not for fun, but to make it easier to use and to prevent counterfeiting. It's actually a really important part of a thriving ecosystem. Everything on this slide offers different utility that might be important to each of you in a different way. Some may value privacy, some may value speed. This list is not exhaustive either.
00:13:44.510 - 00:14:28.934, Speaker A: This is just what I came up with to get on one slide. Some of you will come up with things entirely different. You can also do mashups. You can start to program the money to create whatever your specific use case is for the asset. Backing for the money is customizable too. I'll talk a little bit more about reserve at the end, but you can build an asset backed currency on chain with any ERC 20 token today people are using fiat stablecoins. Fiat stablecoins with exposures to us treasury bills.
00:14:28.934 - 00:15:12.078, Speaker A: Folks are looking at using gold assets. We've already seen an asset basket of liquid staking derivatives. Really, the opportunities are endless and we're starting to see real world asset tokenization tick up considerably. I think at the beginning of the year it was around three or $400 million worth. Now it's double that. And we're really excited about what the possibilities of all these assets coming on chain will enable. This cube is kind of just a depiction of what you could put in a basket.
00:15:12.078 - 00:15:56.614, Speaker A: You've got some dye, some true USD, some USDC, some three pool from curve, even a fracs base pool with Owl USD. Again, it's completely up to your creativity. Just like what we've seen in those other industries and the Internet for the last 25 years. Lots of things have been created that folks couldn't really fathom in 1995. If history is a teacher, stablecoins are just beginning. When Google launched in 1998, there were already 18 search engines. Most people thought search engines were kind of done complete.
00:15:56.614 - 00:16:39.714, Speaker A: Then came Google. If you're familiar with 1990s Internet history, you'll appreciate that America online, which was one of the first Internet service providers, AOL, was one of the first tech unicorns. It was the darling of Wall street and the digital economy in the United States. It's gone now for the most part. We are right now in the AOL era of stablecoins. The long tail a long tail of stablecoins may be the future, each with different jobs to be done. But remember, the long tail looks to be niche initially.
00:16:39.714 - 00:17:18.512, Speaker A: But similarly, Tesla was niche when it launched 2003. Facebook was niche when it launched 2004. The US dollar was niche when it launched in 1785. This is how paradigms shift, whether in transportation or communications, or even in money. So here's a sampling of what's new already in 2023. We're now six months into it. This is just ten of them.
00:17:18.512 - 00:17:43.384, Speaker A: Curve USD launched a few weeks ago. Really exciting product. It offers a more friendly, soft liquidation engine for borrowers. A specific job to be done. High USD, high yield USD. It's an on chain defi savings account with up to 8% APY. Everything's on chain asset backing on chain over collateralization on chain.
00:17:43.384 - 00:18:25.874, Speaker A: Proof of reserves on chain. Third one, let's see USD glow second from the bottom. I'm sorry, this is a cool one. It's a charity dollar that donates t bill yield to help in poverty. This is really exciting because now we're talking about moving money from, again, this industrial age paradigm to something that's more regenerative and more productive for society. Like I said, innovation requires running experiments, and not all will succeed. Okay, who might deploy or utilize these stablecoins in the future? It's a lot of folks.
00:18:25.874 - 00:19:11.908, Speaker A: Short answer is maybe a lot more than we think. Each of these groups has a different motivation, a different job to be done already. Inside of reserve, we're seeing engagement. We've seen a protocol deploy one of these asset backed currencies, the electronic dollar. We've seen entrepreneurs deploy an ETH liquid staking basket. And the high USD that I talked about on the prior slide. You might see daos do this, you might see rewards programs decide to bring their point systems into a on chain environment and actually not inflate their currency, which is a problem that's plaguing the industry right now.
00:19:11.908 - 00:19:58.714, Speaker A: You might see banks, video games, and metaverses launch their own stable currencies. From what I can tell, there's lots of talk about currency systems within video games and metaverses. I can't find a good rationale for why those currencies should be volatile, especially now that tools exist where you can have a stable currency that can provide ecosystem yield for whoever's launching it. So that's really exciting. And then network states and governments, these groups are not all going to jump in at the same time. This list is kind of more or less prioritized in how I think it'll play out. So let's see QR code again.
00:19:58.714 - 00:20:45.826, Speaker A: Scan it if you'd like. Join us in the reserve discord if you'd like to talk more about this. Again, the deck is available on the QR code as well. And just a quick glimpse, these are the three that have already been created on the reserve protocol this year. All the buttons in the deck are active, so if you get the deck, you can click through and learn how to mint them, trade them, lp them, or stake within the community. Who has questions? Yes, here we go. Anybody have questions about the long tail of stablecoins?
00:20:45.930 - 00:21:16.152, Speaker D: Hi here. So thanks a lot for the nice talk. I wonder how you think about the kind of domination of the US dollar in this space. It seems that most people still think in us dollars, no matter where they live, no matter if they are very long on bitcoin or ethereum or whatnot, they still seem to very much rely on the US dollar. And then this comes with a lot of centralization baggage, because you need to take this price of something in us dollars, put it on chain and then do something with it. Thanks.
00:21:16.248 - 00:21:54.812, Speaker A: Yep, it's a great question. So the question is about the US dollar as being the reference point for a lot of stablecoins. It's obviously a very dominant influence right now on most stable coins. But you've all been hearing increasingly about flat coins, which is, I think it was a term coined by Balaji several years ago. A flat coin is generally stable, but not pegged to any type of fiat currency. It could be pegged to the net asset value of its basket. It could be pegged to an inflation rate.
00:21:54.812 - 00:22:45.704, Speaker A: I'm sure some folks will come along in the future and have better definitions of flatcoins. But the way I think about it is, and there's a lot of kind of different points of view about this, especially if you're on crypto twitter, about the dollar losing its network effects or gaining its network effects, I think in the long run. I just wrote a piece a few weeks back called money different. You can find it on the reserve blog, and I kind of reframe how Ray Dalio has talked about empire currencies in history. They don't last forever. He gives, I think, eight examples in his book. I think the dutch guilder, the british pound, the US dollar, the Roman Denarius, and a few others.
00:22:45.704 - 00:23:45.314, Speaker A: So what I would say is, what's cool about something like the reserve protocol or maybe some other projects out there? You know, Olympusdao has ohm, which is essentially a flat coin. I believe the folks from trufflation have launched nuon, which is also a flat coin, pegged to a CPI index. FrACs has the FPI stablecoin, that's pegged to the american inflation index. And then high USD is just a yield bearing ads percentage of yield every year. So I'm actually excited to see what people will create next. Thus far, dollar peg stablecoins have been really a network effect multiplier for the United States. But at the same time, lots of folks are also leaving the United States to go innovate elsewhere.
00:23:45.314 - 00:24:45.534, Speaker A: So we'll have to see how that changes. But I would expect in 100 years this question will be answered. Any other questions? Okay, great. What are your thoughts on algorithmic stablecoins, fully or fractional? Yeah, so the question is about what do I think about algorithmic stablecoins either fully or fractionally blocked? Our founder Nevan did a talk a few years ago, talking, and he wrote a very lengthy paper on a project called Basis Protocol. It was a project that raised a lot of capital and ultimately decided not to launch. But it was a very deep dive analytical assessment of why the protocol would not maintain its peg. And Nevan went on to sort of talk about that on a few panel discussions, even warning folks about terra Luna.
00:24:45.534 - 00:25:34.006, Speaker A: So we have a lot of concerns about it. And that's why the reserve protocol, in fact, early on, they evaluated lots of different algorithmic models and ultimately settled on something that would be one to one asset backed always and over collateralized. So I think our feeling on it is that it was not the right path for reserve. There were a lot of concerns around it. That being said, I'm intrigued to study all of the models out there that are doing it with fractional or some type of algorithmic mechanism. Also, I should just say, algorithmic is a really broad word, can mean lots of things. Lots of things get put into the bucket.
00:25:34.006 - 00:26:17.070, Speaker A: But I think kind of mostly what we think about with algorithmic is we're talking about something that might not be backed by exogenous assets. That's how I think about it. Exogenous assets being assets from outside of your protocol versus endogenous, which was really the fatal flaw, one of the fatal flaws of terra luna. It was backed by its own governance tokens. Can't really build a stable coin very well with that next question. Yes, sir. What do you think about, let's say, the next five years? Would we see more adoption of other fiat backed, stable coins, which are not us? Dollar effect or more flat coins? Yeah.
00:26:17.070 - 00:27:06.434, Speaker A: The question is, what will happen in the next five years? Will we see more fiat backed, stable coins like the dollar, or maybe the euro, or will we see flat coins? My short answer is, I don't know. I'm kind of more excited, though, about the flatcoin opportunity, about the experimentation. It's really the reason why I wanted to come here and talk today, because what's really cool when you have a permissionless platform for people to create on? We're seeing it right now. Right? YouTube. I mentioned the YouTube story when I was at Turner broadcasting 18 years ago. Now there's just 37 million creators on YouTube. They create more content, get more viewing than any other platform on earth.
00:27:06.434 - 00:27:34.912, Speaker A: The App Store example. I used also 2 million apps in the App Store. You can go on and on looking at digital platforms and the impact now, I don't think there's going to be 2 million stablecoins. But lots of people in 1995 didn't know what 2005 would bring. And I'll mention one more thing on this. In 1999, a lot of folks thought Amazon was a fraud. They thought this is going to die.
00:27:34.912 - 00:28:05.154, Speaker A: This business is not going to work. And in 2000, when the.com bubble bursted, went from like $80 a share down to people did kind of the victory lapse had told you. So Amazon's not going to work. It's going to die. And a lot of people were really skeptical about the Internet. Still in 2000, 2001, it wasn't really until about 2004 and five, when we got like Netflix streaming and Facebook that people recognized this is really here to stay.
00:28:05.154 - 00:28:27.504, Speaker A: And so I just share that because that's, I think right now we are like in the 1993 or 94 Internet with crypto. That's how early this is. It's exciting and it's frustrating at the same time. Do I have time for one more question? No, I do not. All right. Thank you so much. I'll be around.
