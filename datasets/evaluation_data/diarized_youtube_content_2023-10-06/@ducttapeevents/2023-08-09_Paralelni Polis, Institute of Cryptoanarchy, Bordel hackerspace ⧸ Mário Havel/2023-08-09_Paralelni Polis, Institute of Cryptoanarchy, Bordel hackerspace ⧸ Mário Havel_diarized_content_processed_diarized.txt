00:00:21.160 - 00:00:32.542, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, can you hear me? Oh, good. Very well, thank you. I'm not sure if I should use this. I feel like Hitler or something. This is ridiculous, right? And I want to. So I don't have any slides. Have anything.
00:00:32.542 - 00:00:49.742, Speaker A: I just. It happened this morning. There is a free slot. We need somebody to talk about something, right? So I would like to tell you about the lovely space that we are hosting it brac at. And like, let's make it chill, informal. It's last days. We've been hacking, partying for two days.
00:00:49.742 - 00:01:27.672, Speaker A: So, you know, if you have any questions, feel free. Even during my talk, feel free to ask. And maybe I would sit or something. And I said, will you kill me for that organizer? I would just, you know, like, get on the level. Right? Hey, so I would like to talk about parallel Napolis about crypto anarchy and bordel, which I put the entitlement talk. And because I would like to introduce you the legendary place that we are in, actually. And for some of you, I maybe already gave tourists around the place and you heard it many times.
00:01:27.672 - 00:02:05.462, Speaker A: I'm like the historical guide of Polis. I tell the stories behind it and there is many of them because the idea of the place, the name of the place goes way back. And before I start, maybe I would ask you, is some of your first time in Panala Nepalis in this place? Yeah. Many of you? Very well. Very well. So I have some audience. If you heard it many times, I'm sorry, maybe get repeated, but the name comes from a text from more than 40 years ago.
00:02:05.462 - 00:03:12.248, Speaker A: And maybe you heard about Vatslav Havel, the first president of Czech Republic and one of the key Personas in the dissident movement during the communist Czechoslovakia, the charter 77, which was a group of people who made a bunch of essays, writings against the communist regime here about the immorality of what is happening within the country and between these people. A colleague of Atzal Havel, Waslav Bender, who wrote within chapter 77, basically manifesto. He explains the essay is called Paralympolis, and he talks about building parole societies. That's what polis means, like society or state. And in his view, he was reflecting on the movement at the day that we cannot really fight the regime, we cannot fight the government because there is no top down or bottom up system. How to change it. There is no traditional social change mechanism in place.
00:03:12.248 - 00:03:52.086, Speaker A: I cannot vote because there is a single party. Right. I cannot change the system by voting. I cannot organize myself. I cannot protest, speak freely. So the effective way how to achieve freedom is to forget about trying to change it and build a parallel one, build a parallel society with parallel structures which enable us to have some alternative to the system which doesn't work right and which means like free parallel education, economy. And so this is the idea which goes way back.
00:03:52.086 - 00:04:56.042, Speaker A: And I wouldn't say that he described the concept, but we see this pattern all over the history, over hundreds, thousands of years that the parallel structures emerge. But that was what we call parallel Nippolus 1.0 and where you are sitting here or well, actually there, that's the Paralympolis 2.0, like the refreshment. Because there was not much focus to these ideas of Peralani police after the revolution. And in 2012, around like ten years back, this idea gets confronted with crypto anarchists. So there is this czech artist community, if you want to artistic group Stehoven, which gave the branding, the artistic feel to parallel ni polis and the broad idea of parallel police.
00:04:56.042 - 00:05:48.798, Speaker A: And this merges with the hacker crypto anarchy community from Slovakia, which met these artists. It's many stories there. They decided to create a hacker space, to create a place where we somehow merge the digital and the physical realm to build the parallel police through the digital tools. Through the tools of crypto anarchy. Because now you have. Do you know about crypto anarchy, by the way? Is it also a new word for you? Because it used to be pretty common in the community years back, but I guess today it's more of a maybe a bit more niche. And maybe you know about cypherpunks, about the movement from eighties, from us, from people.
00:05:48.798 - 00:06:39.514, Speaker A: Because many known, like scientists, programmers, entrepreneurs, who you might hear about cyberpunk mailing list. And this is the community from which, or like the researchers from which many technologies on which bitcoin and therefore ethereum is built on. Nick Sabe also and these guys. But one of them was Timothy C. May, who wrote in 1988 the manifesto of crypto anarchy. And he takes the ideas for the cypherpunk movement even further. So the cyberpunks, the goal there was to write a code, to write documentation and write build the tools to be able to protect ourselves from the government or from the digital athletes in general, to achieve privacy.
00:06:39.514 - 00:07:53.596, Speaker A: And with the Internet emerging, it was much need for that. And the crypto anarchy takes it further because it imagines the world where this digital realm is actually bigger than the physical one. And I believe that's what's happening today. The Internet is, well, maybe even more important than the physical place these days, right? Because like, we have just the magic Internet money here and everybody is building conferences about it and making a bunch of money. Right? It's here, you see, directly in this form, but it's also the thing that the government has and always will have, I believe, the power over the physical world, but it's losing, or maybe even already lost the power in the digital one, where we can use these tools, the uncensorable tools of crypto anarchy, to free ourselves. So, yeah, this plays basically the goal is to educate about these, to build community, which even produces, helps with these tools. And this is what's been happening here for the last eight years.
00:07:53.596 - 00:08:26.488, Speaker A: So parallel polis was opened in 2014 by this group of hackers and artists. Ridiculous group, right? Like they want to run some place together. It was a mess. But there are many concepts, as you could notice in the building, it's divided into various concepts. When you enter, there's a bitcoin cafe, which is a cafe open to public, to anybody, which accepts only, well, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I'm not sure where. I see how much time I have left.
00:08:26.488 - 00:09:04.678, Speaker A: Let me know. And bitcoin Cafe is just the front line of onboarding, right? Like somebody comes from a street and he wants a cafe. And the idea of the place is to educate him on how to. Well, he can use the bitcoin or whatever the crypto payment in just the simplest way possible just to get a cafe, right. And this can take him just less than a minute. I took it down to like half a minute, I believe, sometimes. And it's a huge ux development actually happening there, right.
00:09:04.678 - 00:09:40.076, Speaker A: I mean, directly with normal people facing this technology. So that's bitcoin cafe on the first floor where people are hacking right now with the lovely terrace. That's co working space called Paperhub. It's called Paperhub because at a time when the space was opened, it was actually the cheapest and nicely designed way to build the co working with paper. Most of the furniture was made out of paper and you can still see many shelves and stuff, but over the years, it get renewed, of course. And the second floor is Institute of crypto Anarchy. And the Institute of Crypto Anarchy.
00:09:40.076 - 00:10:11.084, Speaker A: I'm sure you'll love the branding. There is a bunch of hoodies. Get some. It's a really nice brand, which. Yeah, so that's a place for the conferences, for meetups, for community together. But it also supposed to work in kind of a think tank way where the institute should represent something like EFf, maybe represent the digital values of the digital freedom. And then maybe I took you to the basement.
00:10:11.084 - 00:10:34.058, Speaker A: Somebody been to Burdell. So actually when the polis opened the years back in 2014 to 15, there was. In the basement, there was a maker slab. It was like a lab focused specially on 3d printing. You might notice we still have some 3d printers there. They are from Prusa. It's like a fella here, just a few streets away, great printers.
00:10:34.058 - 00:10:59.562, Speaker A: And he's supporting police. So they've got a bunch of printers there. But then they basically grew into a business and moved to their own place. And now during the years this place where Bordel now is, was not really utilized. It used to be a storage unit, so there was always a mass which we call Bordel. And we cleaned it. We started to Josef actually from also colleague from foundation.
00:10:59.562 - 00:11:40.908, Speaker A: He used to jam there, just do music and you cannot hear it upstairs because in the basement, right. So after we get some music equipment there, we start to clean it and we turn it into a hackerspace. And I'm so thankful, or like I'm so glad there is Ethereum community actually visiting Borrell because I mean, the Ropsten merge happened there. It was our little NASA center and it was fun. And it's still open, there's still some techno playing. And if you just want to visit, or like if you're hacking and you need some tools, you need some maybe meet some hackers there, maybe you do Harvard project, you need some physical tools, maybe you need some nodes. We are running.
00:11:40.908 - 00:12:02.486, Speaker A: Vodal is running two bitcoin nodes, monero node and litecoin, dogecoin node and two ethereum nodes. One get full node and it used to be get archival node, but I had to trim it down. I'm sorry. It's Aragon archive node now. But I have twelve terabyte fucking machine right in the caffe. So if you want to see that, let me know. It's.
00:12:02.486 - 00:12:40.954, Speaker A: I'm proud that I managed to run the archive node physically because even get team itself couldn't done it, I learned later. So we provide this archive to public. You can find it on Bordell Xyz. You can just put it in your metamask or something. So yeah, that's Bordell. And there is next to it is also the YouTube studio which well produces the content, right? And on the YouTube channel of parallel police, there is english one and czech one. But on both you find english content either from the studio itself, where there is for example, set up like the lovely lady, which does the interviews.
00:12:40.954 - 00:13:15.856, Speaker A: She has capacity in many fields and explains various stuff there. I have a talk there in Czech about how to run your own dark market, and I explain stories of Russell Briggs and so on. So you can find this content there. And there are also. There are also recordings from the HCPP hackers Congress, parallel nepolis. That's a flagship conference of parallel nepolis, which is generally about crypto anarchy, digital freedom. And there have been many interesting speakers over the years, and you can find most of them on the YouTube channel.
00:13:15.856 - 00:13:44.340, Speaker A: And hackers Congress is the annual conference. It's happening again as every year, and it's starting on 30 September, which is Friday, goes to 2 October Sunday. So please visit us. It will be literally here. And part of it is Ethereum, bitcoin, or like these cryptocurrencies as a tool of crypto anarchy, but it's much broader. There are artists, there are various technologies. I know AI researchers are coming, will be fun.
00:13:44.340 - 00:13:58.934, Speaker A: Come to visit. So, yeah, that's like my pitch for parallel polis. I have six minutes left. Okay, good, good. I still have time to talk more about. Yeah, do you have any questions or something like feel free to be interactive somehow? Interrupt me.
00:14:06.154 - 00:14:15.854, Speaker B: Do you host. Hello. Okay, do you host a lot of events here for different crypto communities or is it mainly kind of focused on bitcoin or.
00:14:16.274 - 00:14:35.110, Speaker A: So it's, as I say, the crypto anarchy. It's all of these two. It's a very broad topic. It's not just cryptocurrencies. Well, it was crypto before crypto was crypto, if you know what I mean. So there is also various communities, not just. And the parallel policies.
00:14:35.110 - 00:14:58.094, Speaker A: The parallel system needs many more things. But having digital economy like this is incredible. So it's a big part of it. There is many people from bitcoin community. There are some bitcoiners, there are people from Ethereum community, right? Hey, there is a bunch of Monroe guys because they are privacy extremists mostly. Here. There is looking at him.
00:14:58.094 - 00:15:35.312, Speaker A: There is some litecoin maximalists actually, because what was happening here over the years is 2017 hit and you can't use bitcoin cafe. The fees are higher than the caffeine itself. So people switch to litecoin, which have the same ux. And some people still shill it. Like, come on, you can just use it for fast payments. Some stuff we were buying just now for Bordell and for police was paid in Litecoin because it was the quickest. But yeah, I also research and play with lightning networks, various technologies which we find useful.
00:15:35.312 - 00:16:01.738, Speaker A: Right. And we give place to these communities which find their place here. So I'm really glad we had a bitcoin conference here like three weeks ago. It was pizza day conference. And I would say like liberal bitcoin conference. It's been bitcoiners you would like to talk to like good people, researchers or like people who understand technology and who are not dogmatic and just really decent. Now we have ethereum community, right? There might be a Monroe conference next year.
00:16:01.738 - 00:16:33.600, Speaker A: But these are like the crypto communities and it's one of the key values. It's also definitely important part of it. But like generally meetups and stuff happening here. There are biologists within like enviro community. There was like open source hydroponic. They built as a project of Parolini police before the COVID There are some artists, there are the AI. There was a whole part of police was AI research community basically.
00:16:33.600 - 00:16:52.994, Speaker A: So various, various people and all the security and privacy guys and workshops on that. We do workshops in Bordell. We provide some education to public. So yeah, three minutes. Some more questions or something or I can just. Yeah.
00:16:54.174 - 00:17:00.594, Speaker B: Thank you. I'm just wondering as we're on stream, what is something you would still really love to organize here, which hasn't happened yet.
00:17:01.054 - 00:17:19.828, Speaker A: That's a good question. Well, eat Prague. I'm so glad it happened. I mean, we postponed it because of the COVID but I'm glad it's happening. Amazing, isn't it? What I would like to organize here. Some monitor conference is coming that will be there. It will be fun, hopefully.
00:17:19.828 - 00:18:04.740, Speaker A: I don't want to leak anything, but a part of that there was. So we did Hecatosh's flying circuit. It's a hecaton. There was actually also one of the ankles to bordell the community. And Hecatosh is first year was more international than it was local. And I would like to have hackathon of this size. But being in Hackettoshu, which is not focused just on Ethereum but like more on the hacking than like building projects and like also in the similar vibe of like you know, actually doing some cool stuff somehow hacking the society and hacking our ways to the Pearl society.
00:18:04.740 - 00:18:37.944, Speaker A: Yeah. And one thing I forgot to mention, actually, one thing I forgot to mention is that there is this beautiful QF around happening. It's initiative coming somehow from EF where there is a matching ground of some money pool and you can vote which project will get some share of this. So you can find it there. If you go further to Fabrica with the booths. There are nice ladies from EF which will explain you how to vote. And please read through the project.
00:18:37.944 - 00:19:00.264, Speaker A: There is many local communities I was bothering to sign, so I hope they will get some votes. And there's also parallel Nepalis, there's also Bordell. So we can support them either directly or if you want to donate something, but also through this quadratic voting. So please don't forget about that before Daven finishes. Yeah. Good. We have some time left.
00:19:00.264 - 00:19:12.690, Speaker A: Okay. You're gonna kick me out? Maybe that's it. I'm not gonna kick you out. I'm not gonna kick you out. But there is another presentation happening. There's an interview happening. Oh, right.
00:19:12.690 - 00:19:17.794, Speaker A: I'm looking forward to an interview then. Yeah. Thank you so much, Chris. Thank you very much, Mario. Thank you, everybody.
