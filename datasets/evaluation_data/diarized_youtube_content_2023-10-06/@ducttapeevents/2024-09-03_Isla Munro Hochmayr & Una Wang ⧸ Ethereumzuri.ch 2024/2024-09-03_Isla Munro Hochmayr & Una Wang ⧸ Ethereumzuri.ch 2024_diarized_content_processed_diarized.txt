00:00:06.240 - 00:00:43.508, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Isla, I'm one of the council members at Daoswiss. I'm the founder of for the Win Dao. My background is originally in venture capital and finance and I've moved more into the web3 and Dao space and being full time Dao for about three years. So Ethereum Missouri has a great conference. We were here last year as well. It's great vibes, smaller than other events, but very personal, intimate. I personally, I'm looking forward to today there's a talk around in person events and using that for identity for UBI, which is really relevant also to the network state and pop up city space.
00:00:43.508 - 00:01:08.520, Speaker A: So we're looking forward to that. Yeah, absolutely. This event is really important, I think, for the annual calendar in Switzerland. We don't have many events that really bring together builders and the like, the leaders and scientists in this space. And this event is definitely one of the highlights, especially just a focus on builders and really the Ethereum community and it's really important and looking forward to more of these.
00:01:08.980 - 00:01:45.710, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Yuna, I'm a PhD at ETH Zurich working on project no one's won. And I'm also a council member at Dao Swiss. Me and Ayla are also working on Dao Volts, which is. And working on a spin off of Zusalu village in Switzerland. Yeah, at the moment we name it Zulitz, which we want to experiment leadership cross pollination between Switzerland and across the global digital nomads web3 community, so that we want to bridge this gap between real world leadership practice and web3 leadership practice to cross pollinate them and to cross exchange knowledge.
