00:00:01.480 - 00:00:13.674, Speaker A: And how that is a potent mix for quantitative research and financial applications. So look forward to hearing you talk. Arnaud Castillo, take it away.
00:00:16.374 - 00:00:26.074, Speaker B: Thank you. Okay. There is a look in my earphones.
00:00:26.394 - 00:00:28.414, Speaker A: Yeah, we, we hear you loud and clear.
00:00:29.274 - 00:00:45.974, Speaker B: Yeah, but me, I'm hearing twice the sounds. Yeah, if it's possible. Otherwise, I will try to.
00:00:49.954 - 00:00:52.054, Speaker A: Yeah, we're checking right now.
00:00:52.774 - 00:01:35.234, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So in the meantime, hello, Prague. I'm really thrilled to be with you today. And we are going to speak about decentralized science and defi. So just a few words about crunch Dao, crunchdao. We are a platform that connects from one side financial institutions and from the other side researchers from all around the world. And what we do, basically, is that we predict the stock market.
00:01:35.234 - 00:02:16.178, Speaker B: If you can go to the next slide, maybe. So, basically, it's very difficult to generate, generating high yield in finance. It's possible, especially through artificial intelligence, but it is very, very, very challenging. Why? Because you need a specific expertise and few people have these skills. It's time consuming. You have a lot of people that are working on the same thing. And the problem is that the findings don't last.
00:02:16.178 - 00:03:03.918, Speaker B: Because if all the researchers on the planet, in the world are working on the same things, they tend to converge to the same findings and basically they are doing the same discoveries. And unfortunately, after your findings that allow you to find this alpha, we call it on the market. So this yield is not lasting. So if you can go to the next slide, basically, it's not like detecting a face, you know, detecting a cat face, a dog face. This is very, very easy. We call it, I mean, very easy. It's difficult, but it's another, it's another difficulty.
00:03:03.918 - 00:03:56.314, Speaker B: But to detect, for example, face, it's called face detection. And there is something that we call the signal to noise ratio. So basically, in a detecting a face, the signal is very high. It's a very good signal. So it's very easy to detect this face. Unfortunately, if you go to the next slide, you will understand that it's for a stock, it's way, way more harder, because it's very difficult to understand how one stock will perform versus another in the next week, in 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. So to solve these issues, because we are not smart enough, we decided to build a community of researchers.
00:03:56.314 - 00:05:04.558, Speaker B: And so today, if you can go to the next slide, you will see that we are 2000. I mean, we are more than 2000. This was a previous number, actually one and a half months ago, because now we are 3500 and there is around 700 phds on the platform. And because we are not smart enough to beat this, I mean, to solve this problem, this forecasting problem, we decided to build this solution with the best financial institution and universities in the world. So now what we propose to our clients basically is to access thousands models on the fly. You can go to the next slide and these thousands model on the fly can be accessed and can power any financial institution in the world. So we turn any financial problematic question into a pure machine learning exercise.
00:05:04.558 - 00:05:58.944, Speaker B: So no more specific knowledge is needed. And there is research phase and any financial institution can access this model easily. So that's what is really good. We believe in a decentralized research model where communities will use web3 tools like Crunchdao to power their common goals. So if you go to the next slide, you will see that Crunchdao has a framework that basically gives you provides decentralized science capabilities. And we'll come back to it in the next seconds. The crunchdao platform that is able to aggregate financial institution and crunch alpha, which means that any researcher who finds yield in the market can share his signal with the community.
00:05:58.944 - 00:06:36.668, Speaker B: So basically, if you can go to the next slide, we are collecting thousands of moles and we leverage the design framework. So coming to, I think it's important that you see how we do this. Can you go to the next slide again? Perfect. So here what you can see is the way we are collecting the model. So we have a variety in the. The community is very diverse. We have people coming from more than 50 different countries.
00:06:36.668 - 00:07:19.638, Speaker B: They have different backgrounds. For example, they have computer science background, astrodynamics, statistics, mathematics, physics. I mean, they are coming from a lot of different backgrounds. And on top of this, they are using different methodologies. So for example, some will use clustering, some will use regression, some will use a neural network. And in the end, we have a lot of different combination, because the education from the country you belong is one variable. Your background, I mean, academic background.
00:07:19.638 - 00:08:22.210, Speaker B: Are you a mathematician, are you a computer scientist? Are you a physician? And what methodology do you use? So if we aggregate all these, then we have a lot of diversity in the models we collect. If you can go to the next slide. Yes. So this is very interesting. You know, in the end of the last century, there was someone whose name was Francis Galton, maybe you know him, and he, he wanted to prove that the crowd was stupid. So he brought an oak in the middle of a village and he asked, it's true story, he asked all the people to guess the weight of the oaks. And in the end of the day, at the end of the day, he was very happy because he was able to show that people did not find a solution.
00:08:22.210 - 00:09:48.172, Speaker B: No one guessed exactly the weight of the oaks. Well, then he came back at home and then he did his calculation and in the end, what did he see? He saw that during the average of all the guests, people found, the collective intelligence found that this very accurate result, I mean, it was perfectly, it was at two kilo, it was I think two kilos different with the real weight of the oak. So it was very, very accurate. And this is what we are doing, this crunch dao. We are leveraging the wisdom of the crowd, we are asking them, we are believing in, and we believe in diversity, we believe in collecting diverse models from diverse people and them there is a mathematical retreatment. It's not that easy, of course, takes time, but this is what we do. Then if we go to the next slide, there is a software that we built that is called, that we called desai crunchdao.
00:09:48.172 - 00:10:57.974, Speaker B: So it's a bit maybe difficult to see it here, but you can. So basically everything, because we are dao, it's very difficult to build knowledge incrementally, and we need this because we are doing research. But when you have 3000 researchers on your platform, it's very difficult to have scientific, clear and structured scientific discussions. So we came up with this solution where anyone can upload a paper. By the way, our white paper is on this platform where anyone can comment and you can just sign in with your metamask. Maybe there is no, unfortunately, I don't show you here, but you can just sign in with your metamask, upload your code and then you will sign your paper with your metamask. Anyone can edit it, change it, suggest a change, then any change is then voted.
00:10:57.974 - 00:11:59.916, Speaker B: And this makes it real decentralized community doing research together, so that we can build knowledge incrementally. We can go to the next slide, because doing this, with this approach, we are solving three problems. We are solving the problem of incremental knowledge, because our framework allows researcher and alpha provider to discover truth signals by building easily and previous discoveries. There is also a reproducibility crisis, we say, because the problem is that if you have some findings, it's very difficult to reproduce it. And our technology enables reproducibility by design. And of course, anything you change is sent then to ipfs, it will be forever, basically. So we are able to.
00:11:59.916 - 00:13:27.988, Speaker B: There is no more problems with immutability and transparency. If you go to the next slide. One word about the tokenomics, because I think it's important to understand how we did this tokenomics and what is the value in the token. Basically, we have on the top that you can see, we have the dao who is collecting and codes and models. So predictive codes, these codes are having an output, so predictions and are then sold to hedge funds or any asset manager. And we basically help them build their portfolio with our prediction. And because our diversity, and we call it also the orthogonality that we are providing, we improve the performance of any financial institution, or most of the financial institution, I would say then we take a performance fee on this, on this performance, and the financial institution pays the Dow, we swap the fiat into crunch token and we pay back the community with the performance of the research.
00:13:27.988 - 00:14:05.824, Speaker B: So the more the research perform, of course, the better result we get, then the better, then the financial institution that are working with us are performing better and so they are giving more fee to the Dow, etcetera. And I guess that's, that's it for this short presentation. I hope I was not too long. Thank you very much. All right, any questions?
00:14:11.164 - 00:14:24.244, Speaker A: All right, looks like no questions right now. Thank you very much, though. All right, one more time.
00:14:29.544 - 00:14:30.224, Speaker B: Thank you. Prague.
