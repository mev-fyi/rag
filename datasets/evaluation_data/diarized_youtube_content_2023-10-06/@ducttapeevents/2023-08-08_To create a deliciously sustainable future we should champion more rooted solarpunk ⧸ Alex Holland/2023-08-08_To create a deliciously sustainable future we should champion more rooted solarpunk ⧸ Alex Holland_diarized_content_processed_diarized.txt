00:00:00.720 - 00:01:14.664, Speaker A: Go to the next slide. Okay, so which of these futures would you rather live in? This question gets to the heart of why Solarpunk matters. Is it the best means we have to inspire people to build a desirable future, or just escapist fantasy Sci-Fi I'm Alex Holland, the founder of Solarpunk stories, and we are trying to inspire the radical change we need by telling thrilling tales from better futures. In our deep dive article, what is Solarpunk? One thing or many? We argue that there isn't just one type of solar punk. There are many shades. For today, the most important distinction is between two different characteristics of solar plank as it exists right now, fantastical and rooted, the more fantastical shade we can see on the right. These are far futures that tend to have lots of shiny skyscrapers, flying cars, or even be on other planets.
00:01:14.664 - 00:02:17.624, Speaker A: They tend to have little or no connection with the world we live in today. More rooted shades of solarpunk are visions that are based more on augmenting and adapting the world we have now, making it greener, fairer, and more delicious to live in, and are set not so far in the future as the fantastical shades. We argue that those who want to build the deliciously sustainable future that's possible and desirable within our lifetimes should champion more rooted shades of solar power. There's a number of reasons for this. Oh, slide. Great. So Raymond Lowey was one of the 20th century's greatest designers and salesmen, inventing streamlined trains and the coke bottle, among a number of other things, he said, what makes things cool is Maya, which is most advanced yet acceptable.
00:02:17.624 - 00:03:46.794, Speaker A: It draws on psychological research that if you want to sell the new, make it more familiar, and if you want to sell the familiar, make it new. The majority of people are unlikely to buy things that are too alien. As the writer and philosopher Hansi Freinacht has pointed out, images like those on the left are too outlandish and, he argues, too childish to motivate people to act to make them happen. Frei Nacht argue the picture of this building in Singapore on the right is much more likely to win people's political support because it is desirable and attainable. He argues that when people don't root their visions more closely to today, we are letting the power of Solarpunk be monopolized by those who are authoritarian regimes like Singapore and Saudi. Another reason to support more rooted shades of Solarpunk is that they are closer to what makes this genre and movement special. As Adam Flynn wrote in the first Solarpunk manifesto, Solarpunk is a future with a human face and dirt behind its ears, like in these artworks depicting Solarpunk versions of New York and Germany.
00:03:46.794 - 00:04:53.894, Speaker A: They have more humans in them, and they are more humanly messy. As Hansi Freinacht has also argued, this type of solarpunk is less idealistic than utopian and more progressively protopian. What I mean by this is it is not an attempt at a perfect utopian world, which, as the 20th century has taught us, can lead to nightmarish societies. It's a protopian one, better than today, but not without problems. These protopian visions allow for a freer, more plural idea of progress and prosperity, which is more open to change and debate. The other big point in its favor is that it's closer to people who are solarpunking the world right now. People like Joseph Schiaritzi, the Solarpunk VC, who is seed investing in projects like the Coconut network, which is using blockchain technology to help bring coconut farmers and the Dominican Republic together for improved collective well being.
00:04:53.894 - 00:06:21.146, Speaker A: Or the Solarpunks Club, who host solar powered parties that connect Solarpunk style enterprises, brands and artists for fun times or grassroots community food growing schemes like May project gardens, which brings together refugees and local residents. In south London, where I am based on all of these, are prefiguring a Solarpunk future now, and along with bigger collective actions, are helping us build a deliciously sustainable future. Today, we cover projects and groups like these in the Solarpunk stories, Substack and Instagram, as well as champion the more rooted shade of Solarpunk in art and fiction, such as our Story series Solarpunk detectives. We're working on launching a dedicated Solarpunk YouTube channel to inspire more people to build a deliciously sustainable world. We are looking for aligned partners, investors and collaborators to make that happen. If you think that you might be one of them, get in touch for our instagram or the email on our website. So which of these futures will you champion? Your choice could be the difference between Solarpunk remaining a fantasy, or all of us making it.
00:06:21.146 - 00:07:06.736, Speaker A: So, any questions? Is there anybody there? I just keep riffing about Solarpunk. Hello?
00:07:06.920 - 00:07:07.644, Speaker B: Hello?
00:07:10.384 - 00:07:13.084, Speaker A: Oh, I can hear you. Yeah. Shout out really loud.
00:07:17.104 - 00:07:51.914, Speaker C: Hello. Could you basically summarize your main points and giving yourself guide or your vision how to implement what you are envisioned? How could you help others to implement your envisioned, let's say, dao structure on the. Yeah, like on the world or communities?
00:07:54.474 - 00:08:31.754, Speaker A: So I've got to confess, I'm not an expert on a lot of web3 stuff. I'm pretty new to this and I am actually going to write a Solarpunk's guide to web3, drawing on experts from across the, across the spectrum. So to get in touch if you want to be consulted for that article. But if I can understand your question is like, how do we make this vision of these deliciously sustainable green future worlds? How do we get from here to there?
00:08:32.334 - 00:08:33.074, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:33.894 - 00:08:34.902, Speaker A: Is that what you're saying?
00:08:34.998 - 00:08:37.434, Speaker C: How do we implement on the field?
00:08:38.334 - 00:09:18.054, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. Yeah, reality. So I think, well, it's having the vision and believing it can happen, it's real is so important because that can motivate you. You have the desire, but then making it happen, I think there's lots of different levels that we can make the change. So one that's really important that people don't talk about a lot is engaging politically. So I think, you know, you need to like lobby, like local political parties, elected representatives, government, and say, you know, this is the type of future that we want to see. This is the movement that's here.
00:09:18.054 - 00:10:05.614, Speaker A: But then in terms of the practical levels, there's, if you go on our sub stack, we cover lots of things that are practical, like, for example, a shorter working week. So there's a campaign right now in Britain to go to a 28 hours working week, but then we want to move beyond that to eventually like a 20 1 hour working week. But they've been piloting that. So that's something that's happening right now. Today, lots of companies already trialing a four day working week with no loss of pay and lobbying the government. And the Labour Party in Britain has said actually that now they're considering implementing that if they get into government next time. And that is something that even five years ago people would have gone, that's crazy, that can't happen.
00:10:05.614 - 00:10:35.964, Speaker A: And I guess also, just on an individual level, if you can participate in a small way, like in a local community group, like a grassroots food growing or something like that, something that's in a very tangible way is building sustainability and solarpunk for you. That's another way, I think you've got to go at the level that's right for you. But the main thing is the more we join together, the more effective we be.
00:10:37.024 - 00:10:38.444, Speaker C: Okay, thank you.
00:10:39.584 - 00:10:41.684, Speaker A: Does anyone have any other questions?
00:10:44.744 - 00:10:54.284, Speaker B: More questions, anyone? I have a question. How do you see the synthesis with the kind of lunarpunk movement?
00:10:56.064 - 00:10:56.864, Speaker A: Good question.
00:10:56.984 - 00:11:01.284, Speaker B: Yeah. What's your read on that at the moment? I'm curious.
00:11:02.654 - 00:12:00.474, Speaker A: So as far as I understand Lunapunk because it's even newer than solarpunk. And it depends. It depends. I mean, some people are like, it's just solarpunk at nighttime, but there are other people who I think, and there's a person who's written articles and done a really amazing YouTube video who's very active in web3. And from her perspective, that Solarpunk is for Lunapunk, for her, is like, it has more mystical and more magical elements to. It has supernatural elements. So from my perspective, that's not as effective at motivating people to actually build it to happen, because if you've got like witches and spells and things like that, in fact.
00:12:00.474 - 00:12:48.854, Speaker A: So that's one thing that distinguishes Lunapunk from Solarpunk. But the other thing, I think that the lady who actually is in the web3 community who made the video, her point is more about she associates people in web3 who identify as solarpunk as being like, really pro transparency. And transparency is always good, no matter what the conditions. And for her, like, the Lunapung thing is that you need some secrecy and you don't want to be transparent all the time. So, for example, you're dealing with authoritarian regimes or something like that. So I think. But to be honest, Lunapunk is so new, I haven't even read any lunar punk stories or fiction, so I can't even really.
00:12:48.854 - 00:12:55.594, Speaker A: It's hard to say. It's such a. It's such a new genre. Even capet.
00:12:56.014 - 00:13:28.614, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a real shame you couldn't have been here this week because I feel like it's been a real synthesis moment of that. So we had a privacy meeting on Monday, which was a very lunar punk themed thing, and there's been quite a lot of synthesis here. Rachel Rose O'Leary, I think you're referring to the. There's a video called dystopian dreams made by wrecked news and it's. I highly advise everyone to watch it. It's brilliant. Anyone else want to ask a question? I think we've got 1 minute, 30 seconds left.
00:13:28.614 - 00:13:51.926, Speaker B: Well, thank you very much for dialing in. Give us your time today. Really great to have the kind of like, the law of all this stuff expanded on. I think it's really important cultural stuff that we need to, which is very much the substrate of what we're trying to do, do here. So thanks so much for your time. Round of applause, everyone. Cheers, mate.
00:13:51.926 - 00:13:52.714, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:13:53.734 - 00:13:54.174, Speaker A: Thank you.
