00:00:08.640 - 00:00:08.840, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:08.840 - 00:00:21.034, Speaker B: Hello. Are we ready? So, next up, Adam is going to talk about security and usability. Come on up. Thank you.
00:00:22.294 - 00:00:52.008, Speaker A: So, hello. My name is Adam, and I'm an engineer at Trezor, and today I would like to share some thoughts on usability versus security in storing your crypto. So, the question, what is the safest method to store crypto? I would argue that it's like secure self custody. Let's break down these two free words. Like secure. I would say everyone knows what secure means. Others can steer funds.
00:00:52.008 - 00:01:49.204, Speaker A: It's unhackable, et cetera. But with self custody, I think that in the community, there is sometimes misunderstanding what these words really mean. So I would like to probably introduce you to a small town called Swetavi, and on this example, show you what self custody is not. So this town had â‚¬2 million store in Sberbank, which is a russian bank, and everything worked fine. They probably have it there because of some nice conditions. But then the Russian Ukraine conflict began, and everyone was feeling nervous and panicked and actually wanted to withdraw their funds from this bank. But what happened if multiple people do this at the same time? That's called bank run.
00:01:49.204 - 00:02:37.174, Speaker A: And bank in this situation, stops withdrawals. So you are not able to withdraw your funds. And you basically, like, you are understanding that the money on your bank account is not really the money you own. So right now, let's get back to the self custody. This is not self custody. Self custody means ownership that you and you only can transact and send these assets and crypto to other addresses. So, yeah, right now, let's get to the main topic of the presentation, which is the security and usability.
00:02:37.174 - 00:03:47.394, Speaker A: Here you can see a chart with two axes, y axis and x axis. The y axis means, like, security, how the solution is secure, and on the x axis is usability, like, how usable, how user friendly the solution is. But before that, I would like to talk about this quote, which says, security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security. I would like that sink in so you can think about it, and then I will say what this actually means. So, this actually means that if you technically improve the security of your product and you are at the same time reducing the usability, then you are reducing both security and usability, because users will shot in the lag. Now, let's get back to the chart on the top left corner. I would say I will put this picture that you will lock yourself in a cave.
00:03:47.394 - 00:04:38.994, Speaker A: This is actually not really accurate picture. You should be there alone, and, you know, your private keys in your mind and like everything, you have no social interaction. So it's basically impossible to steal your funds from you, right? But usability not that big. So that's this manual cave. Then there are like some diy solutions. So you bought some air gapped machine you installed, install Linux on it, and yeah, you are good to go. But the security of this solution really depends on how experienced you are as a Linux user.
00:04:38.994 - 00:05:43.280, Speaker A: So this will determine the setup of the computer. Next, there are traditional apps such as Revolut or Coinbase. But everyone probably knows that these are solutions where you are not in charge of the money because the private keys are stored on their backends and they can just say you can't send it to anyone. Good usability, the UI UX of these apps, we all know them, they are perfect, but security not that big. Also, I don't want you to mean by this that you should not use Coinbase or revolut. These are fine apps for transacting or interacting with lower amounts, amounts that you are comfortable having in your physical wallet, but for bigger amounts. The best solution in terms of both usability and security is a hardware wallet.
00:05:43.280 - 00:06:19.432, Speaker A: Hardware wallet is a single purpose device that does just one thing and that is to store or your private keys. As a treasurer, we developed the world's first hardware wallet. So we know what we are doing. And also there are other competitors. Yeah, so on the top right corner would be the best solution in terms of both usability and security because you are not in the cave. In the cave there is just the hardware wallet. If your computer gets compromised, it doesn't mean that you will lose your funds.
00:06:19.432 - 00:07:34.894, Speaker A: Because Trezor or any hardware wallet is basically unhackable or the probability of hacking it is much lower than traditional computer. And you get a nice UI UX app that when you plug in the Trezor or any other hybrid wallet, you get nice UI for sending, receiving, trading, etcetera. But because we are on Ethereum conference, it's not just about storing your crypto, but it's actually about getting some yield and interacting on chain like swap. In terms of both usability and security because you are not in the cave. In the cave there is just the hardware wallet. If your computer gets compromised, it doesn't mean that you will lose your funds because Trezor or any hardware wallet is basically unhackable or the probability of hacking it is much lower than traditional computer. And you get a nice UI UX app that when you plug in the Trezor or any other hardware wallet you get nice UI for sending, receiving, trading, etcetera.
00:07:34.894 - 00:08:37.700, Speaker A: But because we are on Ethereum conference, it's not just about storing your crypto, but it's actually about like getting some yield and interacting on chain like swaps, borrow money, etcetera. So I would like to also have a section about like eips free top eips in my opinion that boosted the protocol security. So first is EIP 1559 and this EIP I think is quite well known. It introduced base fees which are basically paid every time you execute and send a transaction. And you also have priority fees on top of this. And because we introduced base fees, scammers are not right now able to push transactions with really low fees into the network. So there was EIP Y 559, then there is account abstraction.
00:08:37.700 - 00:09:39.946, Speaker A: I think there were like hundreds of presentations about this topic. So just quickly revise what this does. Actually account abstractions brings the ability of smart contracts to be first class citizens. So you can send and execute transactions just like from externally owned accounts. Also because these smart contracts are basically up to you how they will behave. Then you can go crazy and you can for example have there some mechanism if you lose your private keys, then we have some social channels, you are able to retrieve them. The third EIP is transaction security, which basically introduce a new type of transaction that you submit the transaction on behalf.
00:09:39.946 - 00:10:38.054, Speaker A: Sorry, a third party is able to submit a transaction on your behalf, but you are not giving them the private keys at all. But actually these were just tools about security and usability. But the biggest threat in actually losing your funds is yourself. Because if you felt with some phishing attack, then not a hardware wallet, not a software bullet will save you. So you also need to be educated so you don't be fooled. And I would argue that also practice security management to have it on multiple places, don't tell your friends, etcetera, especially on X. So yeah, so what we have learned today, use a hardware wallet for a larger amount and the other one from Trezor.
00:10:38.054 - 00:10:40.174, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:10:42.074 - 00:10:42.974, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:10:44.914 - 00:10:54.814, Speaker A: And by the way, we are hiring at Trezor. So if you would like to know more about this opportunity, then ask or reach out to me or Tomasz and we can talk.
00:10:56.044 - 00:11:00.224, Speaker B: Thank you. Questions? We have plenty of time for questions.
00:11:07.164 - 00:11:33.808, Speaker A: What is your opinion on the argent or browse accounts stored on the phone? You mean Argent X, the client? Yeah, I use their smart contracts wallet because actually it was like the first smart contract wallet ever made. Right. By Argentx. I mean it's nice, but it's not on Ethereum. Right. It's on some sidechain. No.
00:11:33.808 - 00:11:47.144, Speaker A: Stocknet. Stocknet, right. Yeah. So on Ethereum, I am not sure right now, what are the options for you to create, like, account abstraction? Account wallet. So. Yeah, but I like the UI. I use.
00:11:47.144 - 00:11:49.924, Speaker A: I use their app. So, yeah. Nice.
00:11:55.584 - 00:12:25.514, Speaker C: Hi, my question will be, I believe, less technical. Thank you for your pitch. Anyways, I would like to ask you. Yeah, you guys are the first device wallet that ever existed. And actually I'm using you for the big amounts. But question is, why is it so slow when it comes to adding new chains? Like, if you will be comparing yourself to other wallets, you're far behind when it comes to usability and accessing to the new chains, new blockchains, new coins. What's your take on this?
00:12:25.814 - 00:13:18.454, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. It's something that we are dealing right now, because I think, as you know, Trezor, from the year 2013, when it all started, we were, and I would say also are right now like a bitcoin first company. So, like are from the, from the, like, founder's point of view and product. For a long period of time, there was like, no need to adding, like, a new chains quickly. But right now we understand that there are like competitors on the market that have these chains and we just don't have them. But I would. I would say that in like six to twelve months, you can actually expect quite new chains to be introduced in the app, such as optimism, avalanche, etcetera.
00:13:18.574 - 00:13:20.550, Speaker C: On top of, well, eleven years after.
00:13:20.622 - 00:13:21.190, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:21.342 - 00:13:40.764, Speaker C: And on top of that, the question is why amongst, well, you're the first ones, one of the best teams in town. And why is it that you're still having the connectivity through the wire? Like, most of your competition goes wireless and this is the safest way, as we know. But why are you still working through the wire?
00:13:41.744 - 00:13:51.884, Speaker A: Also a good question. And I would say, like, wait. And you will see in a foreseeable future, a product with bluetooth connection.
00:13:52.224 - 00:13:54.444, Speaker C: All right, good luck with that. Thank you.
00:14:00.504 - 00:14:21.694, Speaker D: Hi. Thank you for your talk. Interesting points. Yeah. My question is what typical easy mistakes or more difficult mistakes do you see? Like, most people make, but mostly like, I'm interested in the most easy mistakes people make when securing crypto and, like, fixes for this.
00:14:23.114 - 00:14:27.426, Speaker A: Do you mean more like on like, behavior, like phishing attacks or like the.
00:14:27.450 - 00:14:37.014, Speaker D: Tooling, like, in general when losing crypto? I think most people don't use Trezor when they're interacting on chain.
00:14:38.234 - 00:15:29.974, Speaker A: I would say everything comes from the fact that if you are falling for these types of attacks, that your knowledge and your security knowledge is not that good. And if you would just slow down a bit and thicken through. Is this alleged airdrop or can I somehow damage myself by doing this transaction? Or like I would say like the first thing, like never tell anyone your private keys, because that's the biggest and the most often problem. Because if you give someone a private key or keys, then you are basically giving them access to your bank account or to your wallet. So yeah, if this answers your question.
00:15:31.674 - 00:15:33.014, Speaker B: Any other questions?
00:15:38.914 - 00:15:59.458, Speaker E: From my experience, treasurer is not working with too many DApps or applications in ethereum ecosystem with the wallets. So do you do something to improve this? Because usually I can connect my ledger to many wallets like browser extensions, but rather not.
00:15:59.626 - 00:16:39.864, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a good question. When I was in the company for the first few months, I also didn't know that we enable users to interact with dapps. It's that with metamask, in metamask you have option to connect a hardware wallet and there is also Trezor. So if you connect your treasure to metamask, then metamask, with metamask you're able to use uniswap and other dapps, for example. So if you can try this, then tonight. Yeah.
