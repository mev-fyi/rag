00:00:01.800 - 00:00:17.954, Speaker A: So, hello. Welcome, everybody, to my talk about Sibyl and fraud detection. Just a question in the start, does anybody know what a Sibyl is? Yeah, you know you want to say it.
00:00:19.734 - 00:00:20.514, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:22.614 - 00:01:04.812, Speaker A: Exactly. This is the thing. So it's a thing that someone uses a computer network to get around the reputation, and one individual creates more individuals than he have. And this is a sentence also from gitcoin. And there's a very nice image of what it shows. Like, you have this alt account bots, whatever they do, and this is kind of a Sibyl attack. And this happened also before in the web two, I think everybody knows, also like a voting system where some of your friends say, hey, I'm here in this competition, can you vote for me? And the people have like, computer at work, computer at home, their mobile phone.
00:01:04.812 - 00:01:51.724, Speaker A: So they use kind of the three things to vote on the system. And what we have here is a very nice example from Spotify. Spotify was farmed out in 2015, where someone created 500 accounts free. Spotify, uploaded his own tracks to Spotify, and by this, he gained $5,000 per month just playing his own tracks with his own sybils. The thing is here with web two, this data is not accessible for us. So this can only be solved by Spotify itself if they know which IP is belonging to them. And this comes now into web three.
00:01:51.724 - 00:02:58.386, Speaker A: In web three, this is civil attacks, sweeting the financial stability, fostering fraud can happen, mock manipulation, eroding trust in the ecosystem. I mean, we have these pillars of decentralized freedoms where we want to have a fair governance system, and especially also with airdrops, incentives and all stuff like this, you take away somehow this fair, claiming rewards from other people and someone gaining more than he has. This is also a very nice example where a developer made his own token. He split this into 70 wallets, and it's increased somehow, even the TVL, the user activity, and so on. We will also come later into this again, but we see here directly, he has 50% of his own tokens distributed into 70 wallets. So everybody, when someone bought this token, he sold it. So what is a Sybil? In detail, we have three different kinds of sibyl that we can cluster.
00:02:58.386 - 00:03:51.766, Speaker A: It's a human, it's a bot, or nowadays there are kind of apps, especially on telegram, they are really known nowadays. So a human symbol is mostly that you do this interaction by yourself. A bot is mostly written with a script. And these new apps, they are a little bit more smarter than bots because they have also kind of an algorithm behind, so they are not showing completely, exactly timestamps. Here is an example of a human. He withdraw from binance, he stays, and then spread it over 30 wallets to be part in this airdrop. This is a bot we see here that he sends like in nearly every 20 blocks or ten blocks, new transaction.
00:03:51.766 - 00:04:40.688, Speaker A: And also the transaction amount was exactly the same. This was an example from gitcoin from graduate founding. So he tried to go under the quite hard finding there. Now we come into some airdrops, Aptos. This is a layer one from ex Facebook employees, this kind of libra where they had this project and Aptos made, I would say, quite easy airdrop to farm out, because they had this test net, and everybody who minted there NFT got the reward. So they didn't have any Sybil checks on this. And it ended up that 65% of the tokens directly was going into Sybil wallets.
00:04:40.688 - 00:05:18.226, Speaker A: One wallet had like nearly 200,000 tokens. And what happened here with Aptos was a selling pressure. So when the first big Sibyl started to sell, the price dropped from $15 down to $13, and then more and more people were also selling it, and it crashed down to $6.7. Next we have arbitrum. Arbitrum was kind of smart. They checked already and made a good Siebel check. But what Arbitrum didn't look into was other layer two or other layer ones.
00:05:18.226 - 00:05:56.570, Speaker A: So they only checked their data on Ethereum, mainnet and on arbitrum. So if I would have made my Sim Sybils on optimism and bridge back to Arbitrum, I would not be detected. So 20% of the tokens ended up as well in Sibyl wallets. Next we have optimism. Optimism has a little bit another way, how they made the airdrop. They had this kind of four airdrops. So the first one was for the first users of the Mainnet, the second one was for the active users of the mainnet.
00:05:56.570 - 00:06:37.494, Speaker A: And every time when you even take part in a governance, so you keep your tokens inside, you get the multiplier. And this is something where they try to achieve this incentive spread much better, because so there's also not this kind of massive selling pressure. And also they use the community and ask if they know some sibyls. So at the end, they removed from 70,000 addresses, 40 million optimism tokens before they spread it out. Hop the bridge. Hop. They pioneered some kind of sibyl hunter program.
00:06:37.494 - 00:07:29.094, Speaker A: This data is also still available on GitHub. And arbitrum, for example, used exactly this list to filter out also sibyls. This has a good side, but also can be a bad side, because Connext tried to make the same like hop. What was happened with Connext that the people was making so many reports, that the team was overwhelmed by their submissions. And not only this, there was one civil attacker, he sent it to 30,000 wallets. Of the 65,000 wallets which been around, he send a small amount of ether, or even just one cent. And so there was a lot of Sybil hunter, they put it in these addresses and say, like there's a Sybil and there's a sybil.
00:07:29.094 - 00:08:11.110, Speaker A: But at the end, this was not a Sybil, this was just a Sybil attacker. And someone was using disperser and dispersed quite small amounts. And this gives also connections. And also what was later there, there was this kind of rumor that Sibyl hunters have been also sybils by themselves. So now comes the question, who verifies the verifier? This address was on the hop positive list. And what this guy was doing, he sent his ens to a new address, and then he come as a Sibyl hunter. So I'm coming now into some methods, an example how you can trace back sibyls.
00:08:11.110 - 00:09:22.730, Speaker A: This can be done by. This is very good example, same central exchange deposit address, then flytrap, which is my own technology, we can use gas detection, cross chain bridges, token transfers, so directly on chain transactions, time timestamps, the wallet age, chain interactions, transaction amounts, contract injections and bulk transfers from dispersers. So what we see here is a deposit of two people in the same central exchange of bybit. So it is very clear that it's the same person, two wallets, the same person, because who else using the same deposit address. And also what you can see here is a withdrawal from a central exchange. But this needs more factors to calculate in. So we for example, see here, this person was using avalanche on the 1 April to the same time, the wallet age, at the same time, he had the same interactions.
00:09:22.730 - 00:10:11.474, Speaker A: And also when we look deeper, he had also the same contract interactions. So by saying this, you could even say tracing back that it's from the central exchange with the same person. Here's this flytrap that I explained. This is an example from a solidly fork. So there was also an airdrop, and someone made 70 wallets as well, and grabbed a lot of these airdrops, incentives from this solidity fork. And especially when we speak about solidarity, there's also kind of a voting mechanism behind that you vote for the next incentives. So this could be even there manipulated if you gain a lot of power over airdrops.
00:10:11.474 - 00:10:42.356, Speaker A: Here we have the gas and transaction amount. This is exactly the same bots that I explained before. So here he send it every time like $10 to gitcoin. And also what we see here, it's exactly the same gas price every time, 90 gray. So he spots even rating that he is going to exactly 90 gray. And this can be traced back. Here we have an example of a cross train bridge.
00:10:42.356 - 00:11:13.116, Speaker A: So this guy was farming out the cross train. He send over lifi some tokens to another wallet and then next month he got the money back. He used also some other protocols and then he sent out the money to another address. And this is kind of a chain link transfer. What we also see like here. So he sent it also like forwarding. This is also here we have a bulk transfer.
00:11:13.116 - 00:11:56.744, Speaker A: And then he used also kind of this chain link transfers. And this is an example from Galcse where someone farmed out also an airdrop and he used several wallets. And we also see that there was a question about, I think Pancakeswap was an incentive from Pancakeswap. So we can even trace back about contract interaction. This is another chainlink token transfer. This has lately happened on base. Base also had this kind of galaxy competition where you can earn points if you buy an NFT and then you claim your points.
00:11:56.744 - 00:12:45.164, Speaker A: And this guy was very smart, he bought just one NFT, send it to next wallet, then he claimed the points there, sent it to the next wallet, claimed another point there. And so he only buys one nft. And this is not the thinking about this incentives that you buy with every wallet, one NFT. And so he came around the system quite easy. Meanwhile Galaxy, after I informed them about this, they have now a code behind also algorithm where they detect direct transfers and cut them out. Also what can do is developing your own contracts and your own tools. Here we have a guy, he's called Yuri.
00:12:45.164 - 00:13:28.354, Speaker A: He used exactly this on Galxa that he farmed out very smart over a script that he used here. And also what he did on base, he was creating his own disperser contract. So he was not using dispersal or bulk transfer apps. He created his own contract and dispersed small amount of ETA in 2000 wallets. And from this 2000 wallets he also created some more contracts. So yes, I think he ended up with 3000 wallets right now on base where he has small amounts of ether inside. And he tried also to hope that it will be an airdrop on base.
00:13:28.354 - 00:14:26.068, Speaker A: So how we trace this all back? Mostly it happened with SQL querying like dun analytics footprint, nonzen flip side. But also there are kind of really special apps around like Scopescan. This image before that I showed was for example from Scopescan, this one. So you can see directly on scopes where the people send money to and you can even see directed clusterings. Then we have also truster labs, Arkham and bubble maps. Bubble maps is specific about all the tokens developers to find out if they have sub wallets where they send a token tool which I showed in the start. And Forta.
00:14:26.068 - 00:15:31.428, Speaker A: Forta is kind of a monitoring system and they also have a new technology where you can kind of program machine learning insight and fast detection. And what's also around is the open data community. This is kind of a discord group, a dao where they come together and build this kind of Lagos like SQL queries specific to detect sibyls and frauds. They were founded out of Gitcoin and get some bounties from Gitcoin and grants and meanwhile they are also working very hard with arbitrum together. So now the question how to solve this? And this is a massive question because at the end we can only increase economy cost like asking for a stakeholder, get something around that they earn less that they put in. Like I think Tina, there was also some people that say oh, we have so small airdrop and the gas fee is too high to claim this airdrop. So that's the thing.
00:15:31.428 - 00:16:47.350, Speaker A: If you don't there have 100 wallets, in the end spend more money to claim the airdrop than you get analytics, which is my point, really crucial because at the end you can solve this really only by analytics, by live tracking. There's also human verification, but I mean also there captchas and all the stuff you can still go around if you have a good bot for this. Also KYC could be something, but still a lot of users don't like KYC and this gives a hard barrier the future. Maybe there's some kind of zero knowledge technology that you have your decentralized id, something like gitcoin already has. But even then there's no 100% sure that you really can detect everybody. And I mean even with KYC we see what happened lately, that some people are using AI to faking new identities, passports and going to central exchanges and making accounts there. So even this stuff with AI, there's a disco prince between now.
00:16:47.350 - 00:17:38.224, Speaker A: I'm coming also to an example from digital identity, decentralized identity. So this is a guy who was on gitcoin, and even Gitcoin later came back to me and asked, are you really sure about the same findings? So this guy has a gitcoin passport with a score of 33, and he even created sub wallets with a score of 16, which in my opinion is even quite high because I have only a gitcoin score of 22. So even there with his sibyls, he was that good that he created Twitter accounts, discord, Facebook, Gmail. And so he get this kind of reputation like a human. So any questions around?
00:17:38.964 - 00:17:42.464, Speaker C: Thank you very much. Any questions from the audience?
00:17:47.644 - 00:18:36.386, Speaker A: The best Sybil attack that ever happened. Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. I mean, there was now a late, nowadays a guy on Ted KC, I think this was probably one of the best, smartest one because he created his own token. I mean, when we look at how incentive will be distributed, arbitrum had this kind of where they say you need like five contract interactions you have to bridge into the network, etcetera. So this guy on ZK sync, he was really smart. He created his own token, he claimed with 20,000 wallets, his airdrop, he created his own Dex, which is not accessible for us all. He swept there, he swept back, he used a bridge with all these 20,000 wallets.
00:18:36.386 - 00:19:02.014, Speaker A: So this is quite smart. I mean, if he would be smarter, then he would even use some other technology. But you can also connect with me if you also in this field of research, and then we can speak. I mean, it's always a little bit tricky to say what is the best Sibyl attack, because it's also now live streaming and everybody can see this and say, ah, this is a good idea. I will.
00:19:05.554 - 00:19:08.642, Speaker B: What motivates you to stay on the light side?
00:19:08.778 - 00:19:09.534, Speaker A: Sorry?
00:19:10.714 - 00:19:15.334, Speaker B: What motivates you to stay on the research side versus the attacker side?
00:19:16.114 - 00:19:17.734, Speaker A: What state we are.
00:19:18.624 - 00:19:22.204, Speaker B: Why are you a civil researcher and not a Sibyl attacker?
00:19:22.864 - 00:20:03.984, Speaker A: Why? I'm a researcher, not a Sibyl attacker. I mean, the thing is, when you want to think about this, then you must think like a black. But somehow I don't want to undergo the pillars of decentralized finance. And this is the thing, we want to have a fair distribution of airdrops and everything. Yeah, I could be a black hat. I could do everything. I mean, everybody in this room probably has knowledge to be more black than white, but why? Why should I use it? I mean, it's still unfair and I'm more really interested in really deep cases, and I really like to discover this.
00:20:09.484 - 00:20:59.434, Speaker D: Hi. Yeah, thanks for the presentation. Really interesting. As an addition to this previous question, how do you. Obviously, we all agree that it's unethical to create thousands of bots and chase the airdrops, if there's any strategy to counter that. For example, if we look at traditional platforms like Hackerone, where we would target the same hackers, but make them like, name them as ethical hackers to see if we can use their resources to give them bounties and have. If there's something specific for this Sybil strategy to.
00:20:59.434 - 00:21:05.446, Speaker D: Are you searching for one of the slides where I probably missed it?
00:21:05.550 - 00:21:38.334, Speaker A: So, for example, hoping was using exactly this. So when you was taking part in hop, from every symbol that you detected, you get, I think it was 50% of the tokens you get directly paid out. I think it was 10%. And the rest of this 30% was staying into a contract. Also, Connext had the same, like this. Every symbol that you detected, you get 25% from the Sibyl from what they were eligible to claim.
00:21:39.194 - 00:21:43.266, Speaker D: You mean like if you found someone who was doing it or if you detected vulner?
00:21:43.330 - 00:22:21.174, Speaker A: Yeah, if I found someone. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, there's always kind of how you know that it's really a Sybil hunter, or is it even our own Sybil that he reports his own addresses? I mean, this can be also then the issue, because exactly this. Unfortunately, the data from Connext was removed. But I would really love into this rumor what happens lately there, because at the end, he could even say his own wallets to save this 25%. Then instead of getting zero.
00:22:23.394 - 00:22:28.614, Speaker D: Take the cut, kind of turn on the ethical side of this.
00:22:29.994 - 00:22:30.930, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:22:31.122 - 00:22:36.614, Speaker D: Well, I mean, yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah.
00:22:41.634 - 00:22:56.814, Speaker E: Thanks for the great talk. I have a question. For the first slides you presented, you showed some airdrops and you said, okay, 20% went to sybils for arbitrary, for examples. How do you get this number?
00:22:59.874 - 00:23:43.842, Speaker A: So this number is not really 100% sure. But I also made some post mortem analysis, and lately there was also from Arbitrum Dell, a grant, where they now do a post mortem analysis. But this 20%, I would say quite accurate. And this is also something that other researchers found out. This is kind of what I say, like here, this kind of flight trap that you look later after claiming where this money flows into. Like, especially when someone claims with 100 wallets, there are some, sorry to say, stupid guys, they send it directly to one wallet and then you have all this connection there and see. Oh.
00:23:43.842 - 00:23:51.414, Speaker A: 100 wallets sent all their claimed airdrop into one wallet. And this is how you can get these numbers around.
00:23:51.534 - 00:23:56.566, Speaker E: So it's a lower bound because if someone was smart and didn't do this, then you wouldn't detect them.
00:23:56.590 - 00:23:58.270, Speaker A: Right. Sorry.
00:23:58.382 - 00:24:04.126, Speaker E: If someone did not send all their funds into a single wallet, then maybe it would be. You wouldn't.
00:24:04.190 - 00:24:06.646, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But. Yeah.
00:24:06.710 - 00:24:07.714, Speaker E: Makes sense. Thanks.
00:24:09.474 - 00:24:21.434, Speaker C: Okay. Thank you very much. We are running out of time, but in 1 hour during the networking session, you can ask Benjamin more questions. Thank you very much again, big round of applause to Benjamin. Thanks.
