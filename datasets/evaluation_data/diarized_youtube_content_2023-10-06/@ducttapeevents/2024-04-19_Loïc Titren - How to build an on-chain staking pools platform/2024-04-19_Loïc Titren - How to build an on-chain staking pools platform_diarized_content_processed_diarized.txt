00:00:00.320 - 00:00:41.474, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey everyone, very happy to be here today. I'm going to talk about the staking pool platforms, because they are very interesting, sort of decentralized application with their own challenges. And it has been a space that has moved a lot recently, I think here everyone heard about Eigen layer, for example. So we're going to go through that just before a quick introduction. Loic, product manager at Kiln we are a stacking company, so we operate validators, many on Ethereum, where we have about 4% of the validators running there. And we also develop smart contract products on top of that to help wallet stake on validators and staking pools are one of them.
00:00:41.474 - 00:01:32.482, Speaker A: So maybe we should start with a small introduction. On is taking in general really from a high level perspective, what you can think about for istaking is locking 32 is on a validator, and then this validator will do some work for the network, like attesting where we had in the network. If the validator does a good job, the network will pay it and that will be its revenue. If the network does a bad job or try to be malicious, the network will slash part of the collateral. So part of the sorties to ease that has been staked. This is called the slashing, and in this case you lose a part of what you staked. Originally, the very interesting property of staking is that your main counterpart is the network itself, which means that you earn yield based on the protocol, inflation, because the protocol pays you with inflation directly.
00:01:32.482 - 00:02:23.400, Speaker A: So it is the lowest risk form of yield actually in Ethereum, because you're directly rewarded by the network. And this kind of yield is of course unique. There is only one kind of staking on Ethereum, and it has been very popular like compared to DeFi, you can see that the total value locked in staking is way higher. And also the general average revenue also is better. On Ethereum mainnet, we've recently reached 1 million validators, so that's 1 million times 32 is that are staked and locked to validate the consensus and that earn reward from the protocol. And so this validator, which you logs your 32 is on, is basically, if we define it in a few properties, it's earning rewards. So there are two types of rewards.
00:02:23.400 - 00:03:04.104, Speaker A: The consensus layer rewards, which are basically a part of the inflation distributed to the validators. And the second one is the transaction fees, which we call execution layer rewards. It does two jobs, it attests, so that's a regular job that it does every slot. So every 12 seconds to attest the current state of the network and it's rewarded with small rewards for that from the inflation. And sometimes one validator out of the million that are active is chosen every 12 seconds to propose a block. And when you propose a block, you earn inflation rewards. So consensus layer rewards, but also part of the transaction fees and mev tip that are inside the block.
00:03:04.104 - 00:03:43.416, Speaker A: And this is a pretty important dynamic in the rewards of validator because it has a lot of variance. We have seen some mev blocks go up to 600 east, for example, so that could be a lot of potential revenue there to be active. Of course, the value 32 is the very important property here is that it needs 32 ETH and not much like, not more, not less. And finally, it has two credentials. So the validation key which is used to sign the attestation and bug proposal, that's the operational key that is on infrastructure. And the withdrawal key, which is the wallet that will receive the 32, is back once you unstake the validator. The deposit pro is very simple.
00:03:43.416 - 00:04:23.284, Speaker A: You deposit to an official deposit contract developed by Israel foundation. You send Certis to is and the deposit data of your validator. So that's the public key of the validator, the wallet address that will receive the 32, the withdrawal credential and the signature. Using the validation key of this message, you send that to the deposit contract with 32 e's and these ease, they will stay inside that contract. They are considered burned. No one can withdraw from the deposit contract and the consensus layer will mint the 32 is on its own state and create a validator. Associate the 32 east to it and your validator will start doing its attestation and block proposal work.
00:04:23.284 - 00:04:53.414, Speaker A: You can see the first interesting properties of staking compared to other type of application. You can burn token, mint them on another layer. We'll see how it creates some changes. If we look just at the vanilla staking mode which we've just seen, it has some limitation. You have to stake 32 ETH only if you have 35 ETH or if you have two ETH. Either you can't stake or you are not efficient in your position. You don't receive a liquid staking token like an ERC 20 that you can use in Defi that would represent your position.
00:04:53.414 - 00:05:24.238, Speaker A: So not really efficient. There, there is no auto compounding, only the 32 ETH are stacked. The rewards you receive them on your address, but they do not auto compound, they are not considered in the stake balance. And finally, no reward smoothings, which means that if I propose a block now and 12 seconds later someone proposes a block, maybe I'll have portraits and no MEV in my block. So I have like 0.1 ease of rewards, and the next block will have 600 ease of rewards. There is no, like average on all the network of this ease that is accumulated.
00:05:24.238 - 00:05:50.624, Speaker A: So no rewards missing there. And so that's kind of the goal of staking pools. You have two types of staking pools. You have the custodial staking pools, which is basically, I tell you, this is my wallet. Send me your ease, two ease, 35 east whatever, and I will pull them and stake them by batches of 32 east. But you have to trust me, because in this case, I'm custodian or your phone. That's what exchanges do when you stake on, for example, binance or coinbase.
00:05:50.624 - 00:06:31.844, Speaker A: And to counter that, like for the non custodial part, like if you have your own wallet, your own keys, we have on chain staking pool, which bring these interesting properties. So, staking pool on chain are basically a set of smart contracts that are added on top of the official deposit contract. And the job is very simple from a high level perspective. They receive is any amount really 35 to one whatever, they accumulate it. And once they reach a certain threshold, they deposited by batches of 32 to the official deposit contract. And then they own their own fleet of validators. And what they do then is that they accumulate this ease deposit to validators.
00:06:31.844 - 00:07:08.274, Speaker A: These validators, they earn rewards. And these rewards, they fly back to the smart contracts of the pool. So the pool balance keeps increasing and the rewards are joining actually the amount that are deposited. So you have auto compounding there. If you have enough validator under your pool, you can accumulate 32 is from rewards and deposit them into new validators. And also, an interesting property of staking pools is that as a user, if I deposit an amount of east inside of it, I will receive within the same transaction a representation of my shares inside the pool. This represents my position inside the staking pool.
00:07:08.274 - 00:07:49.674, Speaker A: And this position has an exchange rate with ease that will vary in time as the pool accumulates rewards. So when the pool receives rewards, it will process the new exchange rate of your share, and you will earn value from that. So the LST, the liquid staking token emitted by the staking pool is a yield bearing token, because you can just own it in your balance. Wait. And in a month, you will already have increasing value just by holding this asset. And then of course, you can have more efficiency with the staking pool than with the vanilla staking, because you have this liquid staking token, which you can use in defi. So you have composability, you can stake any amount.
00:07:49.674 - 00:08:32.694, Speaker A: So if you have like 35 east, you can put all your capital to work and earn yield on that. You have auto compounding by default. And you have all that, all of that in a non custodial way. Because here everything is processed by the smart contract, from the validated deposits to the rewards management and the computer, the new exchange rate. So that's high level what a staking pool is like. And we are seeing in the space three type of staking pool, which we will see in more detail by giving some examples. The idea here is to give kind of an overview of the current design space of staking pools and then talk about the challenges for each of them.
00:08:32.694 - 00:09:09.714, Speaker A: So let's start with the basic one, the first one that has been there, the liquid staking platforms. I guess you all know about Lido. Lido is kind of the first mover in this liquid staking ecosystem. You can see from the dune dashboard, it says about 30% of the state is today its focus is on running on as many professional validators as they can. So Lido is a dao. You can become a validator operator by passing registration process. The DAO has to vote to include you in its operator set.
00:09:09.714 - 00:10:06.046, Speaker A: And once you have that, you receive volume from Lido to stake on your validators. And this is interesting because it means that you have the lido staking pools and behind it you have 36 different validators. So a very good geographical distribution, very good infrastructure type of servers and so on distribution and also validator clients while maintaining in the Lido spirit having good validators. Most of them are dedicated companies like Kyon, for example, and not have a full permission validator set. And of course, the advantage of lido is that as the first mover, they have captured almost a third of the staking market. They have a lot of liquidity to pay for Defi yields and Defi bribes. I think Lido today is one of the most successful yield bearing token in DeFi.
00:10:06.046 - 00:10:31.840, Speaker A: You can see that on curve, for example, or Aave or other protocols. It's very well integrated. Then you have other liquid staking protocols, of course. And what's interesting is that each of them has a different focus. Rocket pool, for example, is very focused on decentralization. They have a permissionless way of adding validator operators. That means that anyone can join rocket pool and run validator for the protocol.
00:10:31.840 - 00:10:57.580, Speaker A: The emphasis to have what they call solo stakers. So people running validators from home directly and kind of the same as Lido. They have their own token. So the are, which is pretty well integrated into defi today while maintaining this decentralization spirit. And then you have plenty of other liquid staking protocols. I just wanted to mention three which are interesting. Swell network.
00:10:57.580 - 00:11:39.084, Speaker A: You have fracs. It's pretty interesting because the Stackfrax token is very well integrated inside the fracs ecosystem. And you have Diva, which is an upcoming protocol device, interesting as well because they have their staking pool. And in the back, the validators that are operated by this pool will be under DVT technologies. So it's a way to basically distribute the validation key and not have it run by only one operator. This minimizes the slashing risk and create overall more safety for users. So a lot of different innovation in this space, a lot of different focus, whether it's decentralization, security, diversity and so on.
00:11:39.084 - 00:12:29.416, Speaker A: And this is kind of, let's say the first design space of staking pool that has been there since Lido. So since the beginning of the VCON chain about two years ago, now we see in the space a new wave of staking pools with the incoming rest taking era. So I guess you've all learned about Eigen layer. Eigen layer is a protocol where basically you can put your stake ease at work for other protocols than is. And these other protocols will pay you more rewards as you earn staking rewards from east. You will earn staking rewards from other protocols, but with the same 32 is staked at the beginning. And this is what this liquid restaking platforms look like from a high level point of view.
00:12:29.416 - 00:13:20.492, Speaker A: You still have your staking pool contracts and the deposit contract, but in the middle you have the Eigen layer smart contracts. The flow is basically the pool wants to stake validators and it will stake them through the eganpod contracts, which are contracts can deploy in the eggnayer smart contract platform and deposit the validators through them. And then they can put these staked east to work on any protocol supported by Eigen layer like Lagrange and so on, and earn extra rewards. So that's very interesting because it gives kind of new dimensions to the rewards of the pool here and so to the reward of the end user. But it creates of course an additional smart contract layer, so more risk on that end. The players here, maybe you've heard of them, they've been quite successful recently. So Renzo et al.
00:13:20.492 - 00:14:00.970, Speaker A: Five rayo protocol as well launch a liquid restaking platform. This platform, they emit not liquid staking token, but liquid restaking tokens. So we'll talk about LRT's there and they've been able to capture very quickly a large share of this. I think it's 12 billion markets right now, Eigen layer. So I think for example is around two to 3 billion right now. So pretty, pretty interesting new era for this staking pool and new volume coming into space. And then I wanted to talk about a third type of staking pools, which we call white label platforms.
00:14:00.970 - 00:14:36.514, Speaker A: So the end goal here is to have staking pools that can be deployed white label for an integrator. So let's say you are wallet and you want your own liquid staking token as part of your ecosystem. You can use a white label solution to deploy that, what it looks like. So that's for example, the product we made with skilled Unchain is that you have a full smart contract platform at the beginning. Operators, operators, they deploy their own operator contracts and on top of the operator contract they can deploy applications. We have a pooling application. So this pulling application is like the smart contract managing what we saw earlier.
00:14:36.514 - 00:15:25.264, Speaker A: So the rewards, the deposit of validators, the update of the exchange rate, and on top of this operator pool smart contracts, you can deploy integration contract per integrator. And each integration contract can emit its own token representing the shares inside of it. So for example, Ledger can deploy an integration contract there, have their user see it as a pool where in reality it will deposit inside the operator pool. So it will benefit from all the liquidity of the other integrators of the operator pool. So faster auto compounding, faster exit times and so on. And you will be able to have your own recipe token branded as you as an integrator. If you want to see all these components, how they interact together.
00:15:25.264 - 00:15:45.700, Speaker A: We have an explorer that represents all of that. But this is for example what we have on Mainnet today. So we have the kin operator. There is also a canbase cloud operator and we deployed a VPool application on top of it. It manages today about 100k e's staked. And on top of that you have a lot of integration contracts. So crypto.com,
00:15:45.700 - 00:16:36.954, Speaker A: comma, Ledgerlive, trust, Wallet, Dakota deployed on that. And they are all able to emit their own liquid staking tokens if they want. And in an upcoming version you will be able as well to deploy a site to the vpool, a rest taking vp, which basically does the same thing, but deposits through again layer. So you will be able to have here the same diagram integration contract that will be able to emit their own liquid restaking token in that case. So this is what we call the white label print platforms, and it has great advantages, especially in customization and in branding for the end user while being able to work with existing operators in the space. So we've seen these three types of staking pools that exist today. They all have kind of the same challenges.
00:16:36.954 - 00:17:06.344, Speaker A: And of course, the main one is security. So as you saw, all the logic of depositing validator, managing rewards computing exchange rate is done at the smart contract level. So everything needs to be very well secured there. We've seen, for example, in 2022, more than 80% of the protocol were hacked. So smart contract security is a big topic and it's hard to secure. And also actually, this number is false. It's way higher than 40 billion.
00:17:06.344 - 00:18:02.518, Speaker A: There are lots of funds that are actually secured by staking contracts if you consider all the protocols we saw in this presentation and this need to be secured. Finally, there is two issues with security of smart contract of staking pools. The main one is that this contract are complex because of the asynchronous nature of consensus layer and execution layer. The pool needs to be aware of what's going on on the layer that it cannot interact with. So this creates a lot of security implications and a lot of possible edge cases. And finally, it's very hard to find a good security auditors for that because these security auditors need to be knowledgeable about the usual smart contract risk, defi the consensus layer, all the validator like possible state transitions, all the mechanism around staking. So as we saw, there are many new mechanisms that you don't see in part of the space.
00:18:02.518 - 00:18:32.810, Speaker A: For example, consensus rewards of the validator. They are not sent to your address, they are minted on the address. So there are edge cases like that that needs to be considered. And it's hard in general to have auditors that have this variety of skills. Finally, on security, another point is the oracles, all these taking pools, they need to rely on oracles because they need to know information about the validator data on the console layer, which is basically another network. So these are oracles. They aggregate the validator states.
00:18:32.810 - 00:19:11.546, Speaker A: They send, they push that to the staking pools once they reach quorum. And the pool can then say, okay, my validators earn that much rewards, so I can update the exchange rate this way. And of course, records are very critical because they determine in the end the value of the LST or the alert you have. And yeah, you need to decentralize them. They are big point of failures, kind of the usual oracle security stuff. But here they are very like the core of the staking pools. So we need to make sure that each staking pools in this space have good oracle security because they are as much secure as their oracle quorum is.
00:19:11.546 - 00:20:06.828, Speaker A: And finally, when you design a staking pool product, you need to be aware about the Ethereum protocol changes since then. Kun there is the state, the hash of the state of the consensus layer that's available from the EVM. So smart contract can now verify part of the state of the consensus layer directly, which is interesting, but it requires a lot of design modification inside staking pools, like uploading proof regularly to process reward and so on. And later on the SRM roadmap, there will be some changes that will deeply impact this space. First, consensus layer rewards are going to decrease. It's what the core dev wants to limit and cap the amount of staked east in the space. There is an IP that will be in the next hard fork, Bellatrix I think, from Mac noder, which basically will allow validator to have more than 32 e as take balance.
00:20:06.828 - 00:21:04.078, Speaker A: So this is a big change in how the pool have to distribute the ease between these validated fleets. And finally, one thing that will be very interesting in the future is how the ZK space evolved. Because as I mentioned, Oracle is very the critical piece of the system and we can remove them if in the end we can create a permissionless way to upload a proof that would recursively check all the validators of the pool or the state or their rewards, and that could be processed cheaply by the smart contract. So for that we need to follow the ZK space, especially on the performance and the cost computation on the smart contract to remove this bad point of failure that we have today on oracles. So yeah, thank you. If you want to know more about this space and the waitlabel part, I mentioned, we have a website there. Otherwise you can follow us on Twitter kin finance.
00:21:04.078 - 00:21:04.914, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:21:08.654 - 00:21:12.914, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Loic, I think we have time for one quick question.
00:21:13.614 - 00:21:23.878, Speaker C: Sorry, quick question. Great presentation. Thank you for that. On your website you describe kiln as enterprise grade. What from a product standpoint mixes enterprise versus not.
00:21:24.006 - 00:21:57.734, Speaker A: Yeah. So what we do is we try to provide a lot of guarantee around how we run our validator infrastructure. So for example, it's like a lot of form, like insurance. We have package insurance for our b two b customers. We also like have SLA's defined around that. We pass a lot of certifications. Unfortunately, there is no, like, specific certification to staking today, but we have, like, all the infrastructure, you know, soc two, type one, type two certificates going to ISO soon as well.
00:21:57.734 - 00:22:17.814, Speaker A: And, yeah, we try to basically always have good metrics to show, like, in client diversity and performance to really have, like, metrics to show, like, the risk profiles of our validators. So, yeah, that's a big focus of ours.
00:22:19.994 - 00:22:24.794, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Loic Teuton.
