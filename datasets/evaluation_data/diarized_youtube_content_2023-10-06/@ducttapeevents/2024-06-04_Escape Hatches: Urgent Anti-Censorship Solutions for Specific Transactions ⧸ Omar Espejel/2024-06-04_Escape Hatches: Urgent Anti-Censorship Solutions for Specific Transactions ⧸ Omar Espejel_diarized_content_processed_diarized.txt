00:00:16.720 - 00:00:43.304, Speaker A: So thank you very much for being here. I'm very happy to be presented in Prague. There's a lot of starnet and Star wars stuff around, and I'm very, very happy. Just make sure to go to get your swag, this cool swag in the booth, and ask us anything that you want. We're here to help you. So today we're going to be talking about anti censorship in a L2, not only in Star net, but using the Starnet case. But this applies to everyone.
00:00:43.304 - 00:01:05.720, Speaker A: So this is a small disclaimer. It is not necessarily the opinion of Star wars or the Starnet foundation. And censorship is crucial for us. I mean, censorship really is maybe the reason why we are here. We don't want to be censored in our transactions. We want to be able to withdraw our phones if we want, if needed. This is why we're here.
00:01:05.720 - 00:01:39.426, Speaker A: I mean, this was the issue with FTX, with banks, with governments and more. So basically, sensory resistance tries to answer the question, what can a user do if they are being censored and currently in L2? Let's be very honest. You cannot do a lot. You're very frail against layers twos. And, well, this is something that might change in the future with decentralization of the L2s. But the current situation is that, well, stuff is not good. So of course, decentralization is the end goal.
00:01:39.426 - 00:01:59.280, Speaker A: We want to be decentralized, and this is something that we say always, why do we want to be decentralized? So that no one can censor you. Right. But decentralization is not easy at all. I mean, the central zion is a very, very hard problem. Ethereum, we could say that ethereum already solved it, maybe. Yeah, very likely, yes. But it wasn't easy.
00:01:59.280 - 00:02:32.432, Speaker A: It took years, a lot of money, a lot of attention, a lot of energy. So if you want to create a L2, for example, that is decentralized, it will take time, it will take money and patience, and of course, certain mistakes along the way. So again, decentralization is not easy. Of course, it's our ideal. However, there can be cases. So our main goal here is to provide self custody to users. But maybe decentralization is not the only way to get there, or at least the ideal case.
00:02:32.432 - 00:03:04.904, Speaker A: But we can do some stuff before, and this is very, very important and something very important to know is that validity roll ups, or you could call them L2s. Valid ropes ensure well validity. Zero knowledge ropes ensure the state's validity. So that means that a L2 is not able to steal your phones, well, if they are well implemented and so on. And I can guarantee that that is the case of a starnet, at least. So they cannot steal your money, even if they want. They cannot steal their money because they are using ethereum at the base.
00:03:04.904 - 00:03:32.724, Speaker A: Right? So this is very important for you to know, but they can censor your transactions. For example, they can not allow you to withdraw your funds from the L2, but they cannot steal it from you. So that is very important to note. So for us, validity roll ups are the choice to go. Validity roll ups is the best way to scale ethereum, but we need to fight this censorship. But again, they cannot steal you. This is very important for you to know.
00:03:32.724 - 00:04:17.892, Speaker A: And something that we want to talk about is the escape hatch. A ski hatch is a mechanism that would allow a user to always be able to withdraw their phones, no matter what, no matter if everyone dies, for example, if everyone in Star wars dies, or if they got killed, if something happened to them, or maybe they got malicious suddenly and they don't want you to withdraw your phones. Escape hatch will always be able to allow you to withdraw your phones, which is very important. Right? Hat had this, things will be different, right. If banks would allow you to always withdraw your phones, no matter what. Well, things will be different. And this is called self custody of your funds.
00:04:17.892 - 00:04:40.624, Speaker A: You can always get access to them. So escape hatch guarantees that. And. Yeah, so they want, they want to allow you to withdraw your phones. Right. What I thought before. So the hypothesis here that we want to talk about is that not all businesses need to pursue full decentralization immediately.
00:04:40.624 - 00:05:15.686, Speaker A: Okay? But they still want to provide self custody to the users, so then they can use other type of measures for a specific type of transaction. What is the transaction? I'm talking about withdraw your funds. It's crucial. Withdrawing your funds is so important in the crypto ecosystem. So imagine that we have a case study of a fintech, let's call it fintech a that is creating a trading company. So AC, they are trying to provide trading services. And the priority, let's be very honest here, like, very, very honest.
00:05:15.686 - 00:05:53.828, Speaker A: I know that the ethereum ecosystem is very idealistic, and we love to talk about decentralization and privacy and that stuff. But in the end, what matters for companies, for entrepreneurs is profitability. They want money, okay? And they want to create a product that attracts people. And something that they can say to their user base is, hey, I provide you with self custody. Okay? What that means is that I won't be an FTX. I won't be able to steal your funds from you. So I am an entrepreneur.
00:05:53.828 - 00:06:26.242, Speaker A: I am creating the trading fintech, a and I can provide you with self custody. If it goes well and it attracts people, then this entrepreneur will have success. No matter what blockchain, they settle on whatever. They only want to be profitable. Okay, so these guys want money as soon as possible. They don't care that much about decentralization and so on. So for them, the minimum they want to allow the users to have is the ability to withdraw their funds independently without third parties.
00:06:26.242 - 00:06:52.356, Speaker A: Again, think about the FTX case. FTX with a full withdrawal transaction, you would be, I don't know, stuff would be very, very different. So there are two critical operations in this case, and this is actually a very similar case we have in Starkx already. So the full withdrawal of funds and the forced rate. And these are the two transactions that, for example, who here knows Dy. DX. Dydx.
00:06:52.356 - 00:07:29.480, Speaker A: All right, so DyDX is very famous. So I don't know if you know this, but they have, they are not decentralized, but they have these two transactions forced by escape hatch. So what I'm talking about is not hypothetical. It's something that has been already working for years successfully. So in DYDX, you can do full withdrawal of your phones and a forced trade. So this would allow you not to be sensor in case DyDX becomes malicious or something like that. But this can be provided to other type of companies, right? So for this entrepreneur, those are the two crucial transactions.
00:07:29.480 - 00:08:03.474, Speaker A: And the moral of the story that I'm telling here is that this entrepreneur only wants profitability. And for them, self custody is a selling point to their users. If it doesn't work, they will jump and go in and do it in Amazon Web services. And we need these entrepreneurs, so we need to make it as easy as possible for them to be able to sell their product to the user base. And escape hatches is what that is. And it's very important from a regulatory point of view. And this is a real case.
00:08:03.474 - 00:08:45.138, Speaker A: Again, you cannot say that you provide self custody to your user base if you don't show it, like legally, really legally, because you will get, you will be claimed that you are not providing self custodial services, but you can do it with escape hatch. And this is, and this is the case of Dydx, for example. So having escape hatch allows you as a company, as an entrepreneur, to say that you are providing self custody to your user base. You cannot do it otherwise, because if you're doing it, I don't know. Maybe, I don't know. In polygon, if you're doing it in Solana, something like that. They will ask you, are you decentralized? Is your product, is the blockchain where you are decentralized? The answer is no.
00:08:45.138 - 00:09:02.694, Speaker A: The answer is no. For arbitrum, optimism to wherever you want it. No. Layer two is decentralized yet not even starting. I mean, but if you provide them with escape hatches, then you can legally claim that. And this is very, very important. Like for an entrepreneur that actually wants to build something, this is crucial.
00:09:02.694 - 00:09:42.544, Speaker A: And again, this is good for everyone. Dydx cannot steal your funds, for example. So in the end it's a happy story. So trading fintech a boost their profits, there's user satisfaction because they are able to withdraw their phones and there's more security. And the ethereum dream happens, right? Blockchain complied with its mission of providing self custody. Okay, so as a corollary, I think we don't need to pursue decentralization immediately. We want more entrepreneurs, we want more self custody for millions of people.
00:09:42.544 - 00:10:19.974, Speaker A: Let's make it as easy as possible for them to do this. And for this case, for this, I talk about Dy, DX for example. But we will also have it in starting app chains. So basically an app chain is a chain dedicated to a specific transaction. So what is my purpose? You are starting an app chain, you run an exchange and that's it. Very simple, like very, very, very small case, an exchange, an NFT platform, something like that. So I don't know how they call it in other blockchains, but Appchain is how it's called in startup.
00:10:19.974 - 00:10:53.310, Speaker A: Maybe they have a node name in CK sync or other layer tools. And this is a very, very cool image. As you can see, app change, which is a blockchain for a specific use case, are already active a lot. Look at this. This is the l two bit dashboard. And as you can see, I mark in orange and in blue, different blockchains, different layer tools that are specialized only in a single type of. They provide the users with a couple transactions.
00:10:53.310 - 00:11:28.334, Speaker A: They are not universal blockchains where you can build whatever. And particularly in blue, you can see the StarkX or Starknet related app change. I mean Dydx, immutable apex. So as you can see, there are a lot of these type of app specific blockchains, L2s, all of this are use cases for escape hatches. And actually a lot of them already have escape hatches if they are using star kicks. So actually the Star wars team is here and if they can correct me, but there are escape hatches already in several of them. Am I wrong? Yeah, right.
00:11:28.334 - 00:12:08.470, Speaker A: Starkicks? Yeah, yeah. So the blue ones are a perfect use case for, well, all of them are use case for escape hatches, while the blue ones very likely already have escape hatches, so they cannot steal from you even though they are not decentralized. So this is very, very very important and it's very relevant for people to know this. And escape hatches have been used already in the wild a lot of times. So this is the case of Dydx. There have been about 150 forced transactions in Dydx that people that want to experiment the escape hatch, so they withdraw their phones from Dydx. This is true data that you can see nail to beat.
00:12:08.470 - 00:12:58.760, Speaker A: So escape hatches again are already providing self custody to the users, even though the YDX is not decentralized. And is someone complaining? I don't know. Would you complain that it's not decentralized? Even if you imagine you're a user, a common user, would you want it to be decentralized if they are already providing you with the ability to withdraw your funds? I mean of course, always the centralization is the end goal, but I mean you can live like this, you can live like this. They are not gonna censor your withdrawal of funds. So your money is always going to be your money. So ethereum dreams, right? So I would go very quick to how an escape hatch actually works in the wild. So what we have here is a combination between the L2 and the layer one.
00:12:58.760 - 00:13:50.712, Speaker A: So the L2 is on the left corner, and in the center we have the layer one. Here we have several smart contracts like a verifier, the standard core contract, the force transaction queue and the standard app chain bridge. While in the L2 we have a balance calculator, which is the most important contract for me right now to explain it. And then we have escape tool, which is basically in this case I put Madara plus stone, but it's basically a sequencing tool plus approver. The Star wars proverb is called stone. And then this is, I know this looks very, very weird and if you want to take a photo or something like this, but this is basically how escatch works. So number one, the user requests a force transaction because they are feeling like they can be stealed by the Dydx whatever app chain.
00:13:50.712 - 00:14:21.494, Speaker A: Right? So this goes into the layer one, sorry. In red is the layer one contracts, while in blue are the L2 contracts. So the user requested the transaction in step number one. In step number two, the layer one, submit the request to the L2 app chain. So hey, please give me my money. This user wants its money back. And this app chain, or for example, DyDx for example, can decide whether yes or not to give them the funds back.
00:14:21.494 - 00:14:57.414, Speaker A: If they give the funds back, then it's on. But if they don't because they got malicious or whatever, then there will be a free system which will freeze the layer, the app chain. It will stop all transactions. And this is very bad, very bad for the app chain. Like all the transactions stop. Once it is stopped, then we go to step number four in which, sorry. In step number five where the user can use escape tool, the madara and stone escape tool, to generate a proof of the balance of the resources of this individual.
00:14:57.414 - 00:15:56.814, Speaker A: Then the proof is sent to the verifier to synchronize with the latest state. And if we go to step number seven, then the bridge will see if the step number six, the user now can request the phone withdrawal to the bridge. And in step number seven, the bridge will check that the system is actually frozen so it can withdraw the phones. And then it will, sorry, go to seven b, raise the request and prevent double spend. So basically it's seeing that everything is okay and it will be able then to transfer the phones to the user. So I know it looks kind of complex, but if you go to l two bit, there's actually a button that says withdraw my phones for Dydx. So you basically click one button and you need to wait, I don't know, maybe five to seven days and you will get your phones back.
00:15:56.814 - 00:16:49.590, Speaker A: So you can, with a click of a bottom, do all this. So you don't need to care much about this. I know this looks a little complex, more for technical stuff, but with a single button you can withdraw your phones in case a blockchain became malicious. Well, of course there are a couple risks. For example, you could say that if I want to stop DYDx, because I hate DYDX, I can do a lot of transactions like, I don't know, maybe a million requests to withdraw my phones to see if one of the funds, if DYDX is not able to comply with them quickly, and then DYDX will be frozen, they will be punished. So I will be able to spam the network in order to affect them. But for that, what Star wars does is that there's a high gas fee to make a withdrawal fee.
00:16:49.590 - 00:17:45.900, Speaker A: So you cannot, it will be very very costly, I think, like in the order of $10 million in order for you to spam a blockchain. It doesn't make sense. So we're trying to prevent this kind of stuff. Also, another issue issue could be the contract updates that bypass the freeze. Well, this is a topic for another day. And, well, basically, next steps that are being considered in the Star wars and Starnet ecosystem is let's create more escape hatches for the star net app chains. And number two, what about escape hatch that is bigger, that can comply to different use cases? Well, and just as a summary of what we talk today, we need to provide entrepreneurs with the tools for them to provide self custody to their users, but to make it as easy as possible for them, because we cannot spend them to fully decentralize in order for them to provide self custody.
00:17:45.900 - 00:18:10.512, Speaker A: And that is what we want. We want self custody. We want a world where you can be free to withdraw your phones whenever you want. So we can use escape hatches, which are already being used a lot in this type of blockchain. Specific transactions, trading exchanges, nfts, that kind of stuff. You can apply it already. And this is something that we need to ask the layer tools to do.
00:18:10.512 - 00:18:36.506, Speaker A: Provide a mechanism to easily provide self custody to the users. Because, again, we want to provide self custody to billions of people. And if we wait for every layer to be decentralized in order to do this, I don't know, how much will it take? Five, six, seven years? I don't know. Will we even be able to get there? I don't know. So thank you very much. My name is Omar Pihel. I work at the Starlink foundation before at Star wars.
00:18:36.506 - 00:18:53.374, Speaker A: And that's my telegram. And feel free to contact me whenever you want. Thank you. I know. If there's time for questions, I think we have four minutes. Any questions? Yeah.
00:18:57.474 - 00:19:22.884, Speaker B: You mentioned the general case for an escape hatch instead of an app chain. I'm just wondering, say someone initiated an escape there, and the chain got frozen because of it. And I happen to have my assets not in my wallet, but, say, in some sort of vault or something. Could I still use the escape hat? How would that work? Or is that, like, kind of an edge case that needs to be explored?
00:19:24.304 - 00:19:29.760, Speaker A: It's a great question. I think that when you say a bolt, what do you mean?
00:19:29.792 - 00:19:42.056, Speaker B: Like, like some smart contract, for example? So, like, if the chain isn't frozen, I could withdraw it from there, right? Yeah, but if it's frozen, I'm assuming I can't, but I don't hold the tokens in my wallet.
00:19:42.160 - 00:20:02.288, Speaker A: Yeah, I see. No, no, this. I think that is more of a general case. As you mentioned, like coral leads, keep hatchets are done in very specific transactions, like layer tools that only allow you to do, for example, two different movements. Withdraw your phones or make a. For example, in the case of Dy DX, withdraw your phones or make a transaction. So it's.
00:20:02.288 - 00:20:39.414, Speaker A: There's no such fault right now, but we want to work on that kind of stuff. Like how can we evade escape hatch? That will be useful for all cases. But this is complex. This is very, very complex because the bigger the domain of the scape hatch, the harder it is for us to maintain it secure. So it's a hard goal, but it's something that is being explored already in Star wars and starnet, and Star wars has already shown that they can do very cool stuff engineering wise.
00:20:42.454 - 00:20:43.394, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:20:44.094 - 00:20:54.734, Speaker A: Any other question that you may have on this or comments? No. Perfect. Okay, well, thank you very much.
