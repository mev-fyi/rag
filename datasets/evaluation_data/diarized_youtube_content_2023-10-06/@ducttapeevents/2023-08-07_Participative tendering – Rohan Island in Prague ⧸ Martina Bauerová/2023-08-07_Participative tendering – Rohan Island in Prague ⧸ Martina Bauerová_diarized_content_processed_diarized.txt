00:00:02.960 - 00:00:56.508, Speaker A: So, good morning everyone. My name is Martin Abowerva and I am not really into technologies, but I am going to talk about innovative, participatory, competitive dialogue on Nurhean island, which is an area just across the river on the right bank of the Vltava. And I'm from Prague Institute of Planning and Plan Development. We just call it IPR or IPR. And from city detail department. And our public space office was established around ten years ago. Shortly what we are doing in our office, we are creating analysis, some strategic, methodic documents for a city.
00:00:56.508 - 00:02:13.644, Speaker A: We are also commenting and making some pronouncement on intended projects. Sometimes it's just private projects, sometimes it's big scale public projects on infrastructure. And so we are also educating publics, lectures, some consultations. And we really like commented city walks, sometimes it's for children, also for students, adults, sociologists and stuff. And probably the main part of our work is working on public design projects like small scale, like portable chairs for Prague, but also citywide projects like 100 ha area projects. And how we do it, we are doing coordination, also conceptual assignments and competitions, or competitive dialogues, which I am going to talk about. And because urban projects has infinite amount of user, hence infinite amount of requirements.
00:02:13.644 - 00:03:15.006, Speaker A: And when these requirements, city and users cannot agree on what they want, we are throwing a competitive dialogue. Sorry, these are just for competitive dialogues on IPR Novi havoc main train station in Prague, which is going to end this fall, and then Charles Square, which already ended and going to be implemented hopefully soon. And Troya Basin also already ended. And I'm working on Rohan, in Liban island. It's an area, how I said before, just across the river on the right bank of Vltava. It's in Carlin and Lebanon. It's in a flooding area full of wilderness.
00:03:15.006 - 00:04:42.538, Speaker A: And I think it's not really appreciated in Prague, because it's a place where you have a chance to be lost in the city and where you can find some wild animals and stuff. The Rohan island is also a project from other Prague projects at the river. And what was the initiation? Probably most of you know that in Prague in 2002 we have really huge flooding. And because of this, Prague decided to make a project of new river arm and lowering the novelty in this area. The project has already planning permit and also part of building permit, but it has never been constructed. And a few years ago productcity console decided to finish this project with competitive dialogue. And we are doing small proposal for the main area of the flooding area.
00:04:42.538 - 00:05:46.424, Speaker A: And also we are doing a huge concept plan for the other parts of Lebanon. Carlin, just briefly, most of the area is in Prague ownership. Just part of this is in municipal district ownership. And also in this area we have a lot of projects. It's developing very quickly. So we have a lot of stakeholders there and a lot of people who are really interested in this area in Karolin, because urban project is only sustainable when it's sustainable by its users. And the users in this area are not only people but also the river and also the wilderness.
00:05:46.424 - 00:06:29.014, Speaker A: We need to talk about Prague City Council. We are contracting authority with other two part of Prague City City council. We are talking with municipal district, also some pubs and stuff in the city and also with public. And thanks to this participation there is a public trust in the city administration and understanding indecisions full of contradictions. Here's a map of local stakeholders. So you can see there is many of them. And we were talking with almost all of them for three years about the projects.
00:06:29.014 - 00:07:46.638, Speaker A: We are also working on this project in huge team around like 14 people, architects, landscape architects, strategy specialists and water engineers. We have a committee for these projects. We have around 20 people and also 15 experts. And what's the main goal of the project? It's making a new landscape proposal for Manini park, like the main part of the area and also concept plan for whole Rohan and Liban island. But also it's important for us to make initiation of the discussion with people around and support the development of local communities and education. The community make multi teams and multiply analysis. We create the concept plan thanks to many analysis and thanks to four international teams and also with the stakeholders.
00:07:46.638 - 00:09:07.684, Speaker A: Always said before just briefly a few documents about Rohan island like geodetic survey, pedestrian and counting, historical natural science research and so many others. And one umbrella about this is like summary analysis of Rohan island. We did participation for three years now and we are still continuing. This is just small outputs from the participation and we really involved the people from the start. We started in the beginning of 2020, in the beginning of COVID-19 we did around 35 introductions, meeting with stakeholders and we are still doing some newsletter. We are introducing the project to the public and also we did a huge Rohan island outdoor exhibition. So everybody who just goes through the area can see some interesting about that.
00:09:07.684 - 00:10:20.816, Speaker A: We are talking with students and with children how they feel the area. We had information container, guided walks, orienteering for children and we are still informing about results of participation and also participating at municipal district events. So just brief information. What's a competitive dialogue like officially it's a type of tender, but it's not a competition. It's a procurement, which is non anonymous. And it's also possible to change the assignment, evolve it during the competition, because, for example, we can see that the first assignment wasn't really right in some way. Now we know something is a little bit different or it's possible to do it a little bit better so we can change it in next step.
00:10:20.816 - 00:11:34.824, Speaker A: And finally, we have a little bit different assignment than in the beginning. Just for you to know. We started to do the project in 2020, but we did a notification of announcement, like official announcement, and in April 2022, sorry. And we are going to end very soon. And now about four teams we have chosen last summer and we are working on the project with. We have four teams, all of them are czech and most of them from Netherlands and one of them from Belgium. And it's really important for us to bring some international teams to Prague because they have different approach, different views on some, some problems.
00:11:34.824 - 00:12:40.228, Speaker A: This is a huge notification of announcement with all of the attachments, which was a little bit involving during the process. So in September 2022, we had first workshop with the teams. They just came to Prague, they saw the area, they had all of the information about the area. And then we a little bit involved with the assignment and the team started to work on the design. In January 2023, the teams came to PRAc and they showed us their start of the project. And then we saw again some other teams of the project and be involved the assignment again. And now, because for us, high quality design matters.
00:12:40.228 - 00:13:49.324, Speaker A: But more important is process. When the committee were choosing the final project, the evaluation criterion wasn't only a design quality, it was only prize. It's in every competition, in every competitive dialogue. But 25% of this was quality of professional approach to contract performance, which is kind of innovative because it's important how the team designed the process of implementation. So hopefully we are going to have finished proposal in 2022 24 and then the finished park, probably 2040, maybe 50. We are not really sure now, but what we are sure about is that when people will hold the knowledge and share responsibility for the development in the area, when city representative change. Thank you.
00:13:49.324 - 00:13:56.364, Speaker A: Any questions?
00:13:58.784 - 00:14:03.208, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool.
00:14:03.296 - 00:14:08.840, Speaker C: Did you have to claim anyone's private property for this park? And was that difficult? How'd that process work?
00:14:08.872 - 00:14:48.504, Speaker A: If so, well, we don't have a private property in the main area, just in the area of concept, and we are talking with the people. It's kind of problematic, but when it's not really the proposal the part of the main study which is really going to be implemented there, it's just a concept plan, and so Prague can use it for other planning. It's not that problematic. It's just we know what we want in this area, but it's probably not going to be there really, in that way.
00:14:49.564 - 00:14:49.988, Speaker C: Cool.
00:14:50.036 - 00:14:50.572, Speaker B: Makes sense.
00:14:50.668 - 00:14:57.824, Speaker C: Does Prague have eminent domain where you could take private property if you determined it was for the public good?
00:14:58.564 - 00:14:59.504, Speaker A: I'm sorry?
00:15:01.324 - 00:15:05.372, Speaker C: Could the government, the city take the private land if they wanted to?
00:15:05.508 - 00:15:26.824, Speaker A: Well, not really. It's possible when you're making a, for example, a railway station or something like this, but it's not that easy in this project. So I would say, no, it's not really possible.
00:15:27.284 - 00:15:27.684, Speaker B: Cool.
00:15:27.724 - 00:15:28.036, Speaker C: Got it.
00:15:28.060 - 00:15:28.244, Speaker B: Cool.
00:15:28.284 - 00:15:28.864, Speaker A: Nice.
00:15:34.444 - 00:16:21.408, Speaker B: Well, thank you for the talk. Love getting insight into these types of processes. And there's obviously a lot of work that just goes into the coordination of all of it. And like the project plan, for instance, I love the containers that IPR is opening up for similar projects and wonder. So, obviously, you do a lot of work to kind of get just the general population of people living in the space to be aware of these projects and to kind of be encouraged to speak up and get involved. What I'm wondering about what's kind of the amount of participation that you get from, not the. Well, you mentioned a lot of stakeholders, but most of these are, like, institutional.
00:16:21.408 - 00:16:38.120, Speaker B: And what I'm wondering about is how much community participation do you have in these conversations? Do individuals reach out, or is the dialogue mostly possible through these institutions, like the municipality, office of Proc and so on?
00:16:38.272 - 00:17:40.524, Speaker A: Well, we are also talking to some communities. For example, on Rohan island is, I would call it pub 18600, which is really like a community hub for the people from Caroline, but even for the people from whole Prague. And we have also the. We have also some people from the sport in our expert in the committee, and we were also talking with them and we made some small lectures in this area, in the area of the port. So, yeah, we are also talking with the people with communities in this area. There is, for example, a lot of sport activities, like a ship club, and we were talking with them, like, many times.
00:17:42.224 - 00:18:18.104, Speaker B: Perhaps another question, if I may. So just the planning process and just kind of the feedback gathering process takes. You mentioned you started around 2019 2022. It's still going on, and there is a three year pipeline. What's the general length or scope of the consideration of the entire reshape of the location? Just to get a glimpse of essentially, how long do you expect to work on this or people to work on it as a scoped out project?
00:18:18.444 - 00:19:14.614, Speaker A: It's very unexpected in Prague, but let's say competitive dialogue usually takes around two years for preparation, one and a half year for the real process, and then we need some time for finishing the project, to get the proposal in some final shape. And then it's about talking with city council and other stakeholders. But when they were involved in the process, we believe it's much shorter than when it's like a normal process, and you just show it to them in the end. So I'm not able to say it's for two years, maybe it's for ten years, but I believe it's much shorter.
00:19:16.274 - 00:19:17.214, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:19:25.454 - 00:19:26.078, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:19:26.126 - 00:19:26.614, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
