00:00:14.040 - 00:00:31.038, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. All right. Wow. We are at an interesting point right now with art and technology intersecting with this web3 revolution. We have a lot of new artists coming on board. We have a lot of different people using this to benefit themselves.
00:00:31.038 - 00:01:49.546, Speaker A: We have a lot of value being created, but with great power comes great responsibility. So this talk is about what we can do to benefit the emerging digital art market and how crypto ethos and the pillars of building crypto projects and the core ethos are really entering the art world via NFTs and crypto art. So according to Nasdaq, core values behind crypto decentralization, democratization and transparency, these are huge for artists. For artists, these are things that are usually played with in order to take advantage of them or in order to push a certain agenda. In the art market or in the arts field. We have a lot of different artists who want to express themselves. And maybe with some of these core pillars of these ethos, similar to as the art market pushes artists into other ethos, we have a new digital revolution, not only in the terms of style or technology, but also in the terms of why things are created and how people are leveling the playing field to provide individual freedom and sovereignty, which for an artist is amazing.
00:01:49.546 - 00:02:23.788, Speaker A: That's something that a lot of artists strive for. A lot of artists get into the creative mindset by using this inspiration from within, to be individually free, to use this technology to provide art to the masses and to benefit themselves. So quick. Hi, I'm Sam. A lot of this talk comes from anecdotal experiences. From my experience at crypto portal, I'm not sure if some of you have been to crypto portal. Maybe it's an NFT gallery we had in the center of Prague.
00:02:23.788 - 00:03:19.594, Speaker A: We've been working with artists, we've been onboarding, we've been working with international artists, local czech artists, helping people mint their first NFT, helping provide a platform for artists to meet collectors, and having a conversation in the space about digital art and crypto art. Also a musician and dj. So I see a lot of parallels between the traditional industry, between streaming, and how record labels work as well with the NFts, with the opposite effect. In using this, I've worked on collaborations with solos, which is generative painting projects with Jeremiah Palacek, and we've done a collaboration. Which one? This one? Yeah. With generative audio mixed with generative traditional media. So we had a combination of audio visuals.
00:03:19.594 - 00:04:34.996, Speaker A: So what it means for artists, how can we start to use beyond the technology, but the ethos of crypto to empower new emerging artists. We can really see a, you know, network of digital artists connecting together on social media. Due to the legitimization of digital art via NFTs and in the crypto art world, we don't have to be in a big city, we don't have to move to London, we don't have to move to a larger capital in order to express ourselves or make connections within the arts industry. So it doesn't matter if you are remote, it doesn't matter if you don't have access physically to a lot of places. It's more about the connections you make remote, or where you can really express yourself via Internet. So a lot of these concepts work hand in hand with the Internet revolution, and also with this emerging digital art revolution, democratization is huge. The dependence on labels and galleries to promote artists is really limiting and very centralized.
00:04:34.996 - 00:05:30.254, Speaker A: It doesn't provide much power to the artists. They are really dependent on these centralized groups in order to express themselves. They have to sometimes fit a box in order to make it into a gallery. Sometimes it's not about what the art is, but it's about how it is. And I think that a great example was x copy put that his art teacher told him he would never make it as an artist, that it wouldn't be possible with this style of art to become an artist. And this is an example of the democratization of NFTs, where we can have anybody start to express themselves and really build their own sovereignty and freedom from crypto art. They can use this technology to be a little bit more transparent and have a conversation with their audience, rather than relying on a label or gallerist to push them forward.
00:05:30.254 - 00:06:37.604, Speaker A: Transparency is a huge one. I have a story of conversation with Jeremiah. When we started cryptoportal, we were really talking about, should we put the price on display, should we let people know the price of it? And honestly, it's a tough call, because I don't want people to be intimidated by a price, or I don't want people to feel have to be impressed because of the financial value attached to it. But he brought a great point as well, is that this increased transparency is something that doesn't exist in traditional art markets. For a gallery, if you want to buy a piece, you have to make an appointment with someone who will give you a price based on a lot of factors, who you are, where it's going to be. They kind of go through and give a rating to you based on how much you will pay for it. So this is an example of the transparency that exists in crypto art and in nfts, where we can get to like a transparent, like, this is how much it is for anybody.
00:06:37.604 - 00:07:33.082, Speaker A: And without these borders of blurred lines between price for individuals or depending on your status, we can really have a more transparent art market. And that's really huge as well. For the streaming industry, where the streaming industry and having music, we don't know exactly where the funds go or how much artists are really making through these centralized platforms. It's definitely helpful, and a lot of artists are making it, but the thing is, is they aren't making it on their own and they're not making it independently. They kind of have to rely on these streaming platforms to pay them out, instead of having the direct relationship with the consumers or with the patrons of art. So how do consumers get the art? This is the main thing is how to reach it. It goes from artists as the starting point, but we have a lot of other people in between.
00:07:33.082 - 00:08:34.416, Speaker A: We got a lot of different mediums that and stakeholders that happen between the art creation and the consumer. There are galleries that presented record labels, like I said, to showcase this. There are definitely a lot of people and stakeholders, individuals that hold power in the art market that provide this value, such as curators and Rs tastemakers in general. These are people who have value in the art market without being directly connected to the creation of art or to art itself. They are ones that provide value, but without having the direct connection to art itself. So where is the value created? This is the main question, because we have so much value in art based on style history. We have a lot of different people who have their own opinion on which art is valuable, which collectibles are valuable.
00:08:34.416 - 00:09:04.110, Speaker A: There is lots of different ways that we can explore this value. We would love to think, as artists, that it only matters about the art. It only matters about what we see. We would love to thank this. This is the best case scenario, but the value is created via a wide network of a lot of different stakeholders and people who are participating in this. A big one. Here we have the art ecosystem model.
00:09:04.110 - 00:09:42.032, Speaker A: This is a big, big chart, and it shows how many people are involved. We have so many people involved that we start here. We have artists, usually in art school. Usually they start with a connection to the market. They have a system. They have ways of going from being in the classroom to being in a gallery to being in a private collection. There are systems in place for them to take advantage of in the traditional art market, whether it's a centralized location, like a school, who's pushing them forward, or it's on their own, where they kind of connect to their peers.
00:09:42.032 - 00:10:33.374, Speaker A: So having art as the starting point in the art market, it matters about the individual's journey as the starting point. It's so important that art schools are improving and teaching the individuals. They're bringing them up in maybe a slightly spiritual artistic way in order to present their work. They're preparing them for the real world, they're preparing them to get into the market. They're preparing them for different critics, different dealers, galleries. These are all part of art school. Besides the actual art itself, artists, peers is a great one to go for next, because this is the connections that happen, the collaborations, this is where they start to make connections, having peers around, giving feedback, this is a big part of the art network, and being able to be an artist and being able to live from your art.
00:10:33.374 - 00:11:31.934, Speaker A: We have a couple different other ways where we go to artist led or curated exhibitions. This is really popular in art schools where we kind of have a presentation of the art. We also have small, publicly funded spaces where artists can interact, showcase the work, start to get into the system, start to showcase, start to show people what they're about. We have art dealers and critics, and these are also existent in the crypto art market and in the NFT market. We can see on Twitter critics of art all the time. We've all seen it, and also dealers and providing the secondary market. So a lot of these parallels still exist, but a big part that is different in the crypto art market is this big section over here where we have regional independent galleries, public collections, major public gallery exhibitions.
00:11:31.934 - 00:12:18.846, Speaker A: These aren't really so common in digital art. There are exhibitions featuring digital art more and more. It's getting very common to have a place to showcase digital art popping up everywhere like crypto portal, like other digital art galleries. But it's not kind of in the same system, it's not in the same ecosystem as a traditional art market. Some parallels are that, like private collectors are a big goal, a huge goal for artists. This is like the way to make it into a collection. When you get to have private collectors, and this is usually unknown, there's no transparency.
00:12:18.846 - 00:12:45.994, Speaker A: Sometimes you don't even know who bought your work. Your work is sold at a gallery and it's gone to stay in a free port to be a liability. That's really sometimes the reality for artists. And now we kind of know private collectors, we have a personal collection with a lot of them. So that's a big aspect that's connected. But in the kind of ecosystem and nfts, we have a little bit of a difference. We're kind of missing a bunch.
00:12:45.994 - 00:13:34.602, Speaker A: I replaced some of them with things I believe are super important in the emerging digital art ecosystem. Social media being a big one, talking about peers earlier and talking about art school peers, we're making connections on social media. I'm sure a lot of us have seen a huge influx of digital art into our lives recently, and I believe social media is one of the biggest sources. A lot of artists post on social media before they take it to a marketplace or before they start trying to actively sell their work, they showcase it on social media. Social media is becoming the way to connect to others. Maybe we don't need art school. Maybe we can use YouTube.
00:13:34.602 - 00:14:26.344, Speaker A: We have these other mediums coming into play that are emerging and evolving so quickly, like AI and 3d art. We can debate what is art and what isn't, and that's what's going to be next. But the traditional market versus the NFT market is changing and things are getting different. Going between private collectors in the secondary market and back and forth is a way for artists to spread their value. It's a way for artists to use their power of connections and to make it an impact in others lives. We have Daos and we see these artist collectives becoming more and more popular. We have a lot of different huge institutions who are buying up crypto art and curating their own collection to support smaller artists or projects.
00:14:26.344 - 00:15:12.302, Speaker A: And we have galleries in the metaverse and in real life that are also helping connect between private collectors and Daos and collectives of art. We kind of have this ecosystem a little broken compared to the last one. We're still building a lot of these tools, and we're still going forward in the art market as digital art evolves in terms of the value and legitimization. But this is a big missing chunk. This is a really big missing chunk of it. And we have to look forward to our opportunity. This is our opportunity here, where we have another different aspect of providing value in terms of what we feel is digital art.
00:15:12.302 - 00:15:52.410, Speaker A: So I would really like to focus on what we can make a difference in when we start to talk about digital art being legitimized on the blockchain. How can we provide our value and our opportunity to become curators and to begin to say, what is crypto art? Because right now there's a bunch of definitions. We have some pfps, we have some OG 3d artists, we have different collectors and collector daos who focus on certain styles. Flamingo Dao, which is an amazing, amazing collective for NFTs. They collect everything. They have some collectibles. They have some 3d art, generative art.
00:15:52.410 - 00:16:34.752, Speaker A: The Museum of Crypto Art, they're a little more focused and curated on digital art. That's considered OG, as in before 2020. So there's some missions that are in place to state what is crypto art. We have galleries and museums also lending a hand into this decentralized curation of deciding what it is. And this is our responsibility to kind of show what is digital art. Having on chain insights, I believe will be a very big key to this. We kind of have the top five selling on opensea, but this is not the way to do it.
00:16:34.752 - 00:17:22.934, Speaker A: If you look right now, I don't think we should consider it. Crypto art. This is the conversation to have the curation of information, like on Reddit, where they show the up votes and downvotes, I believe that's really key. Having a kind of decentralized consensus of what we should see. I believe having this pop up will continue to create a sort of hive mind of digital art. Once we start adding value based on our attention, based on our social and cultural capital, we'll be able to see what we can curate as digital art. We can start to see different roles and directions in Daos popping up to say, like, here's what we believe digital art should look like, or what it can be.
00:17:22.934 - 00:18:08.688, Speaker A: Decentralizing curation doesn't mean what's on display at a gallery. It can mean what it means for artists, what it means for creators. I think a couple years ago we remember having crypto art be a 3d rendered image with a bitcoin just placed somewhere in it. That was a big part of crypto art a couple years ago, and now that style is changing, so we can start to talk about it and have this conversation with NFTs to show what we believe is the future and we have the future of crypto portal. I really see a lot of changes happening. I really see so much potential based on the community that we've gathered. We've gathered a great community of different artists and collectors.
00:18:08.688 - 00:19:11.926, Speaker A: I believe that we can all start having this conversation together, and this is at the gallery here. And shout out to Derek for the awesome photo. So, yeah, I think the future of cryptoportal, as I see it, as a small part of this big ecosystem that we're developing, I believe I see a patronage and a combination of the power to curate coming into play kind of a reciprocal change of information and power, having a semi centralized place. I think we can start to have these conversations a little easier than online and we can experiment in creative capital allocation. I don't think this has been a big topic, and I really think that creative capital allocation and using on chain voting and different styles of assigning tokens can be really helpful to curation and to building artists. That's about it. We have a lot of control in this digital art renaissance.
00:19:11.926 - 00:19:40.134, Speaker A: I would really like and invite you to be mindful about it, what's coming next, and take a look at digital art and the curation of it in a really open way. So thanks so much. We can connect Sam Geddes, crypto portal art. If you have any ideas and you want to offer any kind of hand in this new era, please connect and we can talk about it. Ok, cool. Thank you. Thank you.
00:19:46.514 - 00:20:05.684, Speaker B: Ok, there are some roving mics in the audience and I expect there will be questions, but I sometimes have big expectations. Anyone? Questions? This man talked a lot about some interesting topics. You're all here listening. Any questions? Don't leave me hanging on stage like this. Come on. My job is to get the audience. You've got a question over here.
00:20:05.684 - 00:20:07.984, Speaker B: We have a question over here on the side. Thank you.
00:20:09.084 - 00:20:18.912, Speaker C: I've actually been to crypto portal, so I recommend you to go there. It's quite nice. I have a question. What are your thoughts on IRL minting?
00:20:19.108 - 00:20:21.856, Speaker A: Irl minting give me something like bright moments.
00:20:22.000 - 00:20:23.752, Speaker C: Yeah, I think in this area.
00:20:23.808 - 00:20:56.506, Speaker A: Yeah, this is cool. And this is actually kind of what I was talking about with this, like semi centralized, I think live minting and something like pone is doing back here where they're like getting you to interact with smart contracts on the spot. I believe that's a great way for onboarding. And these in real life experiences are just going to become more and more accessible because we need onboarding right now. We need to get more people involved. So IRl minting, something like that, that's semi centralized, I think is a great way to get people dipping their toes in the water. So I'm definitely a big fan.
00:20:56.610 - 00:21:13.334, Speaker B: Can I share something with you? I've got something to share with you. So what we have here, I'll show this to the camera in a minute, but it's a live stream inside the NFT of us talking on the stage. I'll bring it to the camera over here. Here it is. Maybe, can we put this camera up on the main screen? Big screen, so the audience can watch.
00:21:13.474 - 00:21:15.302, Speaker A: It's really nft on my list.
00:21:15.478 - 00:21:16.406, Speaker B: Yeah, here we are.
00:21:16.510 - 00:21:17.454, Speaker A: And there it is.
00:21:17.574 - 00:21:28.206, Speaker B: So there it is. So this opens. Is this going to work? Open seats of it. And my hands shaking. Too close. So this is the live stream stage.
00:21:28.390 - 00:21:29.134, Speaker A: Nice.
00:21:29.294 - 00:21:37.886, Speaker B: Live streaming inside an NFT on Opensea. It's called ETH Prague live. I don't know. We were thinking about lending these out using poon finance.
00:21:37.950 - 00:21:39.710, Speaker A: I think it's the way to do it. I think it's the good thing.
00:21:39.822 - 00:21:45.190, Speaker B: We'll talk about that a bit more later. Anyone else got any questions on anything? Yeah, we've got a question here in the middle.
00:21:45.302 - 00:21:48.582, Speaker A: The questions have started the question train. Yeah.
00:21:48.598 - 00:22:36.728, Speaker D: Okay. Hi, I come from art market background, so I'm with you on a lot of what you've talked about, but I think my question, or I'm interested in your opinion about how does the future of crypto art gets to quality art so that it wouldn't be like, democratization is like a lot of people voting on stuff they have no idea about. And how do you actually get to the quality art that might be like, you know, in minority, it might be unpopular, but it might be some, like, really interesting movement without basically creating the same gatekeeping structures of curators and people who know about art as we see it currently in the art market.
00:22:36.856 - 00:23:08.894, Speaker A: No, exactly. Cause as we see with, like, decentralization in general, we have a lot of influx of art, which can be as simple as getting some assets from a blender store, dropping them in blender, printing it, uploading it to OpenSea. Now you're an NFT artist. It can be that simple. And I really believe that that's part of the creative capital allocation that we kind of need. We need people who are. We can say ogs or somebody who is into digital art.
00:23:08.894 - 00:24:05.334, Speaker A: I know some friends, like felt Zein, who have been in the field for a while. I would say these kind of proofs, we can't do it on chain yet, but at the beginning, we can start to allocate this creative capital based on our attention. So I think a huge kind of slip up right now in the market is a lot of attention is placed on collectibles or these generative pfps, which is a huge part of it. But once we get to, like, what quality digital art is and where we see the attention of some big collectors, like Flamingo Dow or Cosmo de Medici or something like museum of crypto Art, I think they have a huge creative capital where they can start to help us point towards quality, because right now that's, I agree, a huge, huge barrier to show and to have a decentralized level of what is the quality that deserves to be called crypto art or digital art.
00:24:05.874 - 00:24:27.374, Speaker B: Right. And there's something for me here about like you've got Web 2.0 and web 3.0, and I think a lot about like how can we make sure we build Web 3.0 to be something new instead of just replicate Web 2.0 on a blockchain? To take that analogy further, there's like, let's say the old art world is art 2.0 and this is art 3.0.
00:24:27.374 - 00:24:42.696, Speaker B: I see people trying to make traditional world art on chain, but actually should we just be burning everything to the ground and creating new art 3.0? Anarchistic artist style, censorship resistant, you can do whatever you want now, artists, it's.
00:24:42.720 - 00:24:52.976, Speaker A: Only in your brain. It's all in your brain too. But that's a big one. Yeah, for sure. There are definitely going to be these conversations popping up and what can be considered crypto art or art 3.0.
00:24:53.040 - 00:24:53.576, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:53.720 - 00:25:19.584, Speaker A: It's going to be really cool to see the future of it. And I believe we have that conversation opening with these IRL galleries and everything like this. And these creators tools like Adobe, they're going to start offering these services of showing how much work the artist put in. They're going to start showing that this NFT came directly from Photoshop. And here's maybe some steps or layers of it. I think that this kind of transparency will evolve in the creator tools published.
00:25:19.624 - 00:25:21.488, Speaker B: To behance or publish to Ethereum.
00:25:21.576 - 00:25:23.432, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. Exactly.
00:25:23.608 - 00:25:37.496, Speaker B: Okay, because I think two more minutes for questions. I'm sure Sam and I could just keep doing stuff on stage if you have questions. Anyone, please, anyone. Or from the live stream audience, we are on the live stream. The live stream is up here. Sam, you see the live stream there? That's the camera. That camera, that's called the live stream.
00:25:37.496 - 00:25:54.566, Speaker B: That's where your family is watching. Okay, so do you have any questions from the live stream? I can't hear you. Ah, we can't hear them. Oh, yeah, yeah, they do have cheers, but no questions. Okay, then I think we're done here.
00:25:54.630 - 00:25:59.274, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the next talk. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Thank you. Cheers.
00:26:00.174 - 00:26:01.134, Speaker B: Jingle, jingle.
