00:00:39.014 - 00:01:00.486, Speaker A: It's one of the best conferences I've been on this year. I mean, really. But otherwise, the people, the venue, the vibes. Absolutely awesome. It's been amazing to listen to all the speakers and, yeah, everything has been arranged so, so well. So I. I'm almost sad that it's almost finishing.
00:01:00.486 - 00:01:21.502, Speaker A: I want to come back next year and do this all over again. This is the third event that duct tape ever produced, and I couldn't be more excited. It has been awesome. So we went from, like, a small community conference last year to an academia focused event in Zurich, and now again, like, coming back to Prague with all.
00:01:21.518 - 00:01:22.454, Speaker B: Of the knowledge that we gained.
