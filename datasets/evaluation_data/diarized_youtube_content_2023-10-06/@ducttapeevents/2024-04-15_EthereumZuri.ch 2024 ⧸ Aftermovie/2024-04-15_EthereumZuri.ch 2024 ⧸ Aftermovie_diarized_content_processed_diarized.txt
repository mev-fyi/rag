00:00:15.240 - 00:00:26.974, Speaker B: What I really like about the conference is that it's very diverse. There is a lot of topics about daos that I really like and how to establish a real decentralized governance which is also efficient. So I really liked it.
00:00:27.094 - 00:01:17.998, Speaker A: What I like about here in Zurich is this is very local event, so you can see that a lot of people around here, so perhaps based in Zurich or like somewhere nearby, come and have a chat. Of course we have big major conferences around the world, such as if Prague ECC or Defcon and so on and so on. I think it serves a different purpose. So what I like to see here is I saw a lot of university students coming and then maybe local people who don't travel too much come to have a chat. So that's what I like about it. Yeah, that's one of the most interesting events I've been previously in the past few months and I really appreciate this vibe and everything, the lineup of best speakers. So it's all about networking with people and learning more from other type of activities happening and just keeping yourself updated with other type of involvements in the ecosystem.
00:01:17.998 - 00:01:29.876, Speaker A: And I think one of the main interesting part of being at this event is like engaging with other developers and also being updated with subjects.
00:01:29.940 - 00:01:52.494, Speaker B: This event is really important, I think for the annual calendar in Switzerland we don't have many events that really bring together builders and the leaders and scientists in the space. And this event is definitely one of the highlights, especially just a focus on builders and really the Ethereum community now and it's really important and looking forward to more of these polarigory.
