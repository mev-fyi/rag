00:00:10.280 - 00:00:26.434, Speaker A: And now we are going to have another speaker online and she is in Navladimirovna Osetrova with a very interesting topic of digital slavery from chinese social credit system to american mass surveillance. Welcome and prepare your questions.
00:00:28.384 - 00:00:44.440, Speaker B: Hello everyone. Just technical checkup. Everyone can hear and see me? Yeah. Can someone correspond? Perfect. Perfect. Well, greetings everyone. This is my great pleasure to greet every one of you all the way from Washington, DC.
00:00:44.440 - 00:01:53.364, Speaker B: Well, ahoy to the Czech Republic and every one of you here. Sadly, I couldn't join you all in person for this wonderful academic and technical exchange. However, allow me to send my words of gratitude to Camille Tran for finding me through my publications and research and for reaching me out with a very kind invitation to join here as a speaker as well as everyone who made this forum possible. Thank you for the opportunity to share the bits and pieces on my research on such a indeed critical topic of the present day, which is our privacy and freedoms in the digital world. This presentation combines ideas from several of my studies that I did through my academic journey in the United States. A little update I walked at my graduation ceremony just two weeks ago and received my ba in political science and economics. I always remember to hold interest in exploring unconventional correlations of events and phenomena that happened within our communities, countries, as well as on the level of international politics.
00:01:53.364 - 00:03:12.692, Speaker B: Looking at how technology and its precision are advancing, safeguarding personal information, such as knowing where it goes, where it's kept, and who can access it, becomes highly critical and fundamental in a sense, how we as citizens, citizens of the world, interact with those who watch us from the other side of the monitor. Those who can make critical decisions and make critical decisions for the future of our nations, who decide our friendships and shape the world where our kids will be born today, we'll look at digital slavery through the prism of chinese social credit system and american mass surveillance. How private is our privacy? We'll discuss the technology, the mechanisms of implementations, ethics, as well as the legislation to address this complex topic. Now, before I begin, here's the QR code that will get you to my published research that I did back in 2018. So, social credit system the biggest catch about social credit system is that it's not about financial system. Yes, people certainly do. Compared to the credit score that you earned within the bank.
00:03:12.692 - 00:04:17.984, Speaker B: However, a certain score that limits your freedom of travel, access to healthcare, and even the ability to send your child to a good school, it easily stops being just about finances, right? The system of social credit is built on the model that tracks your activity and analyzes your behavior not only as a user within a specific app, but also outside of it. This can range from behaviors in public, such as jaywalking, smoking in the non smoking areas, or biking in the correct spot, or even to interactions with people of lower ratings. Your purchasing habits can influence your scores based on what the local authorities determined, a beneficial consumption pattern. In turn, participation in community services, providing charity, can boost up that social score. However, among many, many implications that the system gives is the main one is the creation of social stratification. And I promise we'll come back to it later in the presentation.
00:04:18.924 - 00:04:27.828, Speaker A: So sorry, sorry, Ina, we still see the first slide, so, like, you need to probably change the picture so we follow you.
00:04:27.876 - 00:04:33.534, Speaker B: Oh, yes, I was. I was actually, I was doing this and you couldn't see on your end.
00:04:34.034 - 00:04:36.094, Speaker A: Yeah, we still see the first one.
00:04:36.834 - 00:04:39.250, Speaker B: Oh, I apologize greatly.
00:04:39.362 - 00:04:40.334, Speaker A: It's okay.
00:04:42.034 - 00:04:46.218, Speaker B: Okay, okay, now, now it's good.
00:04:46.266 - 00:04:47.414, Speaker A: Now it's changed.
00:04:47.874 - 00:05:12.714, Speaker B: Technical team, come on. Sorry. So the previous. The previous slide on social credit, the QR code, would lead you guys to the published paper that I did years ago when I first came to United States as a student. That was this slide. Now we're on the slide of surveillance impact, so everyone can see. Just making sure as we go along.
00:05:12.714 - 00:05:59.894, Speaker B: All good. Perfect times and technology have changed drastically since the time. Again, I mentioned 2018. I first did this research on social credit system. So, integration of artificial intelligence, facial recognition system, emotional analysis, body temperature monitoring. Presently, China holds more than half of the world's advanced surveillance cameras, which means that statistically, it's one camera that oversees three citizens. The autonomy of private companies in China is increasingly at risk as the Chinese Communist Party, the establishment and affiliation of party within businesses.
00:05:59.894 - 00:07:09.044, Speaker B: On the right, you can see interesting numbers that highlight politicization of businesses, which puts data privacy, user privacy, under big question. Data collection, storage, transfer, it's a critical, universal concern, as there's simply not enough cybersecurity protocols and the appropriate legislation to go about it. The companies below represent financial services, social media, dating website, bicycle rentals. All in all, information that is collected from all these services holds a range wide enough to establish an entity mighty than the traditional ministry of Internal affairs. And imagine all this information is concentrated in the hands of government. Now we shift into the discussion integral to the fields of political science and political management, the role of government, its weight and its influence on society. This phrase has been attributed to Adam Smith, and I feel great obligation to cite it for all of you here.
00:07:09.044 - 00:08:00.172, Speaker B: Every ship thinks that the shepherd is a genius, and the dog, the protector of a flock. Even the owner and the dog eat more sheep than the wolves do. Economics of slavery. Such was the title of my senior thesis that I presented at my university. As previously, you can scan the QR code to get to that publication. With Endon's research, my goal was to build the historical outlook on the expanding power of government and with how slave labor was built historically to benefit the political class. So when we get to the fundamentals of the social contract exclusively discussed in the Enlightenment period, the word contract seems highly controversial.
00:08:00.172 - 00:09:17.474, Speaker B: Knowing what we know about cybersecurity and having what we have, with the growing and expanding governments in place earlier, I promised all of you to revisit the matter of social stratification. Long before the Enlightenment, thinkers like Locke and Hobbes, there was a subtle, but there was indeed an understanding that contract primarily benefited one party which wasn't the general public. It wasn't people. So how many of you actually get to read 70 pages or more of terms and conditions when you download a new app or upgrade the system? I do hope, however, that you get to read the contract when you sign your rent. But what about the terms and conditions of our digital activity, our digital obligations expectations, our digital traces? Why would signing this contract carry less of your consideration? Oftentimes, we're even forced to agree to terms to carry. To proceed to reading an article, accessing a certain website. This is where it gets obvious that the contract needs to be substituted, but something more versatile, something that can be called consensus.
00:09:17.474 - 00:10:12.744, Speaker B: Do you feel the difference between the word contract and consensus? With the increasingly digitized word? As a world that we live in as ours, much of the political and social history has become transparent and accessible. I'm dropping another QR code here. Bear with me. That will lead you guys to another research that I did on blockchain versus the US Supreme Court, where I discussed that historically, the judges of the court were appointed, added, subtracted, and their number always varied throughout history. To do what? To serve and carry out the agenda of different presidential administrations. And those. And those are the people whose role is to interpret the constitution with impartial mind.
00:10:12.744 - 00:11:27.554, Speaker B: And what still appears to be a consequence. The correct term to put here is court backing is a big, big topic within the United States. As I mentioned in the very beginning, the social credit system is not just about finances, as it encompasses much more, much broader phenomenon. And banking in its traditional form has low chance of survival in this world of innovation. And Henry Ford said that if people had indeed understood our banking and monetary system, maybe the world would already start the revolution. Guided by the ideology of this forum, ethereum, and embracing innovation, we as young researchers, developers, tech people, we are working on crafting a new world that will be consistent with the technology that keeps evolving certain systems, laws, mechanisms, cultures, trends. They do have a tendency to get old and inapplicable as they fail to correspond to the reality and the new needs of populations, the new populations.
00:11:27.554 - 00:12:37.884, Speaker B: Media ownership. Now, as we transition into the second part of this presentation, let me cite you. Let me have the privilege of citing you the very first amendment to the United States Constitution. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peacefully assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances. Let us focus on the freedom of the press, the freedom of journalism that is a sacramental piece to american system of governments. Besides the checks and balances of the government, of the three government branches, there needs to be an independent entity that can balance out the government by asking critical questions and navigating the political narrative, the complex narrative of the present day. Now, let me walk you through the evolution of media regulation and how it eventually impacted journalism.
00:12:37.884 - 00:13:41.704, Speaker B: The 1934 Communications act laid the foundation for for profit broadcasting system. With advertising money pouring in, corporate networks pressured Congress to uphold profit as the basis for american broadcasting. Fast forward to the eighties. Reagan's deregulation policies removed government controls, which led to the rise of media conglomerates that prioritized profit over journalistic integrity. Another transformation is Gary Webb's dark clients, which where he exposed the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking to fund the nicaraguan contracts. In an internal document that was only declassified in 2014, the CIA described how they intended to discredit this journalist, Gary Webb, and his reputation, and subsequently two bullets in his head, were claimed to be suicide. And to something more recent.
00:13:41.704 - 00:14:40.764, Speaker B: Just last year. Imagine five newspaper companies closed every two weeks in the United States. Half of the american counties are now considered news deserts, as they either have no local news source or just one, which is typically a weekly newspaper. Well, today, corporate influence on media is more pronounced than ever before, with financial giants like Blackrock Vanguard owning significant portions of media landscape. And all of this creates a conflict where the freedom of press lacks its true freedom. Moving on in political topics, we put forward an emphasis on studying power. In this case, it is an exponentially growing power of governments within the discussion of our digital freedom and privacy.
00:14:40.764 - 00:16:15.114, Speaker B: It would be a mistake to skip citing Snowden, where every little thing that you do and every habit that this action of yours develops is tracked and kept in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited and who safeguards are not. From the first side, such concepts as the shift of meanings linguistic fallacy might come or look at us from dystopian novels, and it's only until we start looking at the legislation, the Patriot Act. I will explain you what it is, but you, my dear audience, will judge how patriotic it actually is. The Patriot act in the United States was a big shift in government powers enacted in response to the September 11 attack. The act expanded their surveillance capabilities of the state, allowing for greater monitoring of phone calls, emails, financial transactions, as well as the information that is gathered and bounced back and forth amongst the intelligence agencies. The broad powers granted under the Patriot act is mass spying, which ultimately undermines the trust in the once signed social contract. I must warn you that out of 100 us senators, there was only one, only one senator that voted against this act.
00:16:15.114 - 00:17:13.394, Speaker B: It's the Democrat senator from Wisconsin. His name is Russ Fenkel. Just one. Well, in explaining here more the authorization for use of military force, the so called AUMFs expanded the government even more, even more by allowing the executive branch, which is the president, to engage in military actions without the need for prior congressional approval. Historically, the 2001 AMF that was also passed in response to 911 attacks. It was followed by the 2002 AUMF that authorized the military intervention in Iraq. These AOMFs, two of them, have been used to justify various military campaigns in regions, many regions, throughout many, many years, and oftentimes they went beyond their original intent.
00:17:13.394 - 00:18:01.796, Speaker B: So I know we are limited on time, which is why I would like to leave my contact information here. In case you have a longer question, I promise to answer in a timely manner to everyone. I would like to end my presentation with the following words. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. We live in a fragile world that needs our attention and collective effort to maintain our liberties and protect our privacy. It is crucial that we stay informed, question the powers that govern us, and actively participate in shaping the future that values truth. Dear audience, thank you so much for your time and attention.
00:18:01.796 - 00:18:03.184, Speaker B: Happy to be here.
00:18:05.804 - 00:18:11.564, Speaker A: Thank you. We still have time for questions. If there are any, let's ask.
00:18:12.264 - 00:18:13.044, Speaker B: Yep.
00:18:16.264 - 00:18:40.734, Speaker C: Hi, thank you for the presentation. The US is, to put it bluntly, going in a bad direction and seems to be worse and worse. Has anyone researched other countries that might be a safe haven for people who want to use more privacy technologies, or you want to just be less observed and tracked.
00:18:43.194 - 00:20:46.584, Speaker B: So it's interesting, and I just recently graduated with my political science and economics degree. So I would say a lot of things that are being studied, especially when we get to the question of government power and political influence, there's a great tendency to look upon the role of the United States, because essentially United States, with all its power, which is not just militaristic, which is not just cultural, it's a big power, and it has influence across all branches of whatever you can think about. So United States is setting trends, big trends, on how, I would say, the democratic world that holds on to this constitution. And, in fact, brilliant ideas that were written in the constitution by the founding fathers. And interestingly enough, with such an unfolding events in the digital world, it's very interesting to see how this old world with great ideas of the Constitution, of, you know, principle of human dignity, of privacy, and, you know, essentially of establishing the government that is against tyrannical rule, because this is how the United States got to become the United States, essentially in its, after its independence. So looking at other countries where maybe implementing the system would be more efficient in terms of how private everything is, the exchange of information and how people indeed have this autonomy would not necessarily correspond to the bigger countries, or would not correspond well to the country that is setting global trends, the United States. It's a very delicate question.
00:20:46.584 - 00:21:30.264, Speaker B: So, and after living in the United States for many years, this country holds a lot of bureaucratic processes. So a lot of things that could be potentially established on the lower level, in the level of smaller countries with their own inner dynamics that are culturally unique, that are unique in many other senses, historical, financial integration, it will, of course, be different. So I hope that I addressed your question nonetheless. It will certainly live in very different, different and interesting times. It's definitely a fun time to be around these days.
00:21:31.484 - 00:21:35.264, Speaker A: Thank you. Some more questions.
00:21:37.724 - 00:21:49.804, Speaker D: In your personal and professional opinion, considering with how things have been and for how long they have been, do you see this ever changing?
00:21:52.304 - 00:21:56.728, Speaker B: Ever changing in the future? In what way?
00:21:56.856 - 00:21:58.684, Speaker D: In the future? In the future.
00:22:01.144 - 00:23:14.972, Speaker B: Just even if we look at historical outlook of events, a lot of things have changed. It was the second research that I mentioned in this presentation, economics of slavery. Even if we look at the subject of slavery, certainly slavery in the current day is not what it used to be back centuries ago. However, slavery now exists in a different form, and which is within this presentation, I described you a different form of slavery, which is digital slavery. So it is certainly tendencies or their skeleton of such tendencies. They do stay in place. However, as our economies develop, as our cultures get more integrated, get revolutionized, people go and conquer new lands, people move, people travel, people learn new languages, and, you know, get together to create something new, which is what we're doing in this forum.
00:23:14.972 - 00:23:47.864, Speaker B: Correct. So certainly things are not staying permanent. However, we can see tendencies that can transcend time. And this is our responsibility to adopt technology to serve us, not via. Through tyrannical means, but as something that can benefit us in the future collectively, and can serve the cause of human rights, human dignity, and liberation.
00:23:49.924 - 00:23:50.864, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:23:51.364 - 00:23:52.170, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:23:52.292 - 00:23:53.006, Speaker A: More questions?
00:23:53.070 - 00:23:53.714, Speaker B: Yep.
00:23:55.934 - 00:24:39.520, Speaker E: Yes. Hi. Now, I have a remark, really more than a question, but so, first of all, this quote you have about every sheep thinks the shepherd is a genius is probably not from Adam Smith. So the second thing is this quote that you have there by Henry Ford. Unfortunately, it's also, as you may know, also used by lots of conspiracy theorists. And mostly, whatever the quote is, it mostly shows that Henry Ford did not understand the financial system. Okay, so you're addressing a very important question.
00:24:39.520 - 00:24:57.984, Speaker E: Right? You're working on important stuff. You're a researcher, so I think you have to be careful to not, you know, open yourself up for criticism for little things like that. Right? That's just a little remark. I mean, anyway, what do you think?
00:24:58.404 - 00:25:22.910, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Also, thank you. I love remarks. So, in terms of the Adam Smith. So even though we don't have direct quote, direct access to many of these quotes, they have been, this specific world has been attributed to his teachings, used to have students. And this is something that we get, well, historically, is being traced down and gets into history.
00:25:22.910 - 00:26:33.166, Speaker B: So I know exactly what you mean by this. Conspirologists and people who sort of challenged the modern research phenomena. However, when I was writing about getting back to this research on economics of slavery, so within. Within the perception of this country, of the United States, it's, you know, slavery as a subject matters, political subject is considered in a very different way. So if you travel elsewhere, if you learn the history of, for example, the caribbean region or various european countries that were also subject to a lot of practices of tyrannical rule of essentially slavery, we can see that slavery does not have a certain color. It does not have religion. It, in fact, is very, very universal tool to gaining control.
00:26:33.166 - 00:27:53.688, Speaker B: And there, I did some pieces of research online that say that, you know, someone denies numbers, someone denies this. But however, as researchers, as people who sort of compare global phenomenon, we need to see this big zoomed out events. So what actually happened? What is something that this source can tell me that I can make sense out of. And back to the, back to another quote of Henry Ford. I mean, United States was having what it has with the head of the Federal Reserve saying, yes, we need to increase the, the interest rate, keep increasing interest rate and the oil prices, for example. A lot of things could be built very, very differently. And certainly the quality of life and the elevation of human capital can be considered through very, very different economic means, economic tools that can be set in place to, to essentially establish a lot of good things that would benefit people.
00:27:53.688 - 00:28:16.624, Speaker B: However, given the narrative of the political landscape, very intensified political theater, we need to understand that priorities is something that citizens, in my opinion, don't really have much control, much power of in determining. So this is my remarks.
00:28:18.964 - 00:28:28.812, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. That's probably a wrap. So let's give a round of applause to Ina and we'll continue soon. Thank you very much.
00:28:28.988 - 00:28:29.764, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
