00:00:14.480 - 00:00:45.490, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Cool? Are you soaked from walking over? I hope not too much, but. Well, I won't tell you. I won't tell you the whole anecdote, but basically it's my childhood trauma. When I was like ten years or something, my mom pushed me away. At some point she said, like, let me do the talking, so I'll listen to her because she's my mom. And I just want to thank you.
00:00:45.490 - 00:01:02.274, Speaker A: And I want to also invite the sponsors to just say a few words for the closing. And then finally we'll start with the thing that everybody's waiting for, which is actually the hackathon reward. So please welcome on stage our beloved sponsors from Starquare and Kraken.
00:01:08.854 - 00:01:35.906, Speaker B: Hey, guys, thanks so much for attending. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know a lot of you hearing the talks. Actually, we got to know a lot of you guys personally. I'm sure I've talked your ear off about Starknet and Starkware at this point. And I have probably like 200 new contacts on Telegram. So that was really great. Let's give yourselves a round of applause.
00:01:35.906 - 00:02:06.150, Speaker B: Like, this was a really great conference. So honestly, again, I've talked to your ears off. You at this point know everything there is to know about Starknet. But you should still check out the ecosystem, check out our dapps. Our fees are lower than ever. You have our barcode from our booth. Check us out.
00:02:06.150 - 00:02:16.144, Speaker B: Continue the work that you're doing. Everybody here is building toward a decentralized future. Everybody here is doing super important work and be in touch.
00:02:23.684 - 00:02:43.672, Speaker A: Likewise. Wanted to say thank you to everybody who attended. Thank you to the organizers for making such a great event. Thank you to Joseph for being so accommodating. And the vibe was really excellent. Everyone was very welcoming. We learned so much, made a lot of connections, and expect to hear more from Kraken in the future at future events and hopefully again next year.
00:02:43.672 - 00:03:04.044, Speaker A: Next eth Prague. Thanks everyone. Thank you, gentlemen. Well, you see, my mom joke didn't work on you. That's why I'm not a stand up comedian. I want to mention all of the names here because all of you can read. Thank you so much, our sponsors.
00:03:04.044 - 00:03:33.362, Speaker A: And now one last thing before I leave the stage. So one thing that we didn't tell you, didn't tell the hackers, is actually we have a trophy for you. I'm not promising NFC's this time. Apologies to all of the winners from previous year, but we have something. We have something physical. Hey, we have these unique prints that Martin Fischer, the cyberpunk future is now. Artists, local artists, who actually has his atelier, like two blocks from here, has made for all of us.
00:03:33.362 - 00:03:53.542, Speaker A: So all of the winners of the hackathon tracks, of the Solpung hackathon tracks will be actually walking away with these. And now, finally, please welcome on stage Chechi, who took care of the entire hackathon. Thank you so much.
00:03:53.598 - 00:03:54.422, Speaker C: Thank you, Joseph.
00:03:54.478 - 00:03:55.234, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:03:55.654 - 00:04:40.354, Speaker C: And thanks, everyone. So, I didn't expect to be on stage because everybody's just waiting for the winners, right. But I want to just say thank you for participating, for being here, for being so positive. Besides, we had a little bit of rain, right? I saw amazing projects today. Please keep building and keep doing great stuff. All right, so now we're gonna have the judges come here on stage and announce for each award the winners. First, I want to also to mention that, of course, the numbers that you saw at the opening, and we had 45 projects that submitted for the hackathon.
00:04:53.054 - 00:05:26.234, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. First of all, I wanted to say thanks to the team that put this amazing conference together. This is a labor of love. I organized some events before, and I know the hard work, so thanks for that. Thanks also to all the volunteers and to everyone that hacked. So today we're going to talk about the different Solarpunk awards, and we're going to go for the first team, the Solarpunk solutions, with the price of $3,000 solu.
00:05:26.234 - 00:05:45.924, Speaker A: Welcome to stage. All right, welcome, welcome. When I give a few words and tell us what you guys built. Yeah, tell us what you guys built. So actually we can speak together. Hello, everyone. Wow.
00:05:45.924 - 00:06:29.626, Speaker A: Quite surprising, actually. This is what we've built. Maybe not the first in the world, but they're really useful. Solar powered node for any types of supported blockchain, and actually the little part of our worldwide network of interconnected nodes. And it's fully open source, so anyone can actually build the same thing following our instructions and just put your node in our network or just choose the network that you love, it doesn't matter. So, yeah, that's the thing. And it's actually working.
00:06:29.626 - 00:06:51.654, Speaker A: If someone interested, you can come to us and look at it. We will show and we will say all the things about it. And of course, if you love that, you can vote for us in community voting, we will really appreciate it, but I'm really appreciated to be here. So thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you. Hacker.
00:06:51.654 - 00:07:08.872, Speaker A: Wow. Amazing. Thank you. Thank you, solody. Yeah, thank you. Let's look at the second team that won the Solarpunk solutions. So it's rewardy.
00:07:08.872 - 00:07:59.412, Speaker A: They won the second prize. It's $2,000. Yeah, that didn't work, did it? So we all actually here to kind of give a little bit of social pressure to the big dapps and the big organizations on chain. We ran some calculations and anywhere between 20 and 80 transaction runs on the ethereum positive. That's about an espresso cup. Now we all send a lot of transactions, I'm guessing. Well, I hope so.
00:07:59.412 - 00:08:48.574, Speaker A: Otherwise we're not using our tech. But we all do, right? We actually try to figure out how can we make people try to give back to not only the system that we call sustainable ecosystem, but also give back to the actual environment. People can buy a token through our system to calculate how much they actually spent in the past on emissions. They buy a token to be able to buy their emissions away. The emissions go to a gitcoin funding road that allows anyone to come up with offset plans and in exchange they get a little reputation reward token that they cannot trade or sell. But the real fun thing is you can mint an NFT in anyone in their wallet and you can kind of make it red or green. So if you have a red nft in your wallet, you're a bad guy.
00:08:48.574 - 00:09:39.944, Speaker A: So we're trying to apply the social pressure and social look in making at least people aware that there is a problem and that they at least should be aware to try to make a solution about it and not just, oh, we're green, kind of giving the bear a poke while we all can give the big bear a poke instead of needing to ride on the bigger guys giving the bear a poke. I'm really happy to be hacked with these people together. I was surprised we finished everything. I guess we all are. But yeah. Thank you for having us here and up to next one. Hey everyone.
00:09:40.564 - 00:10:23.920, Speaker D: Hello everyone. Very excited to be back to eth Prague again. I'm Omji from Inkat club. This time like joining again as a judge is so like rewarding and we are very excited to announce the next winner. Okay, so our next award for decentralized community resilience we're going to introduce is like we found very like interesting one which is like collectively decentralized community can play and game together. Moving little piece from here to there around the world so that you can collectively achieve some goals by doing so. I wouldn't explain too much.
00:10:23.920 - 00:10:34.644, Speaker D: So that's still the thunder of the team. That team gonna be introducing their project a little bit on the stage. Please welcome me to Congrats Suzuwatari team.
00:10:43.654 - 00:10:45.074, Speaker A: Is there anyone here?
00:10:45.574 - 00:10:46.214, Speaker D: Are you here?
00:10:46.254 - 00:10:52.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Come, come, come. More games, more games.
00:10:55.294 - 00:11:02.318, Speaker D: Hey, congratulations, team. So, do you want to share a few words about your game to everyone? Please come to the middle.
00:11:02.486 - 00:11:35.274, Speaker E: Thank you very much. Honestly, we didn't think that we would be standing here, so we are not prepared at all. We hope that all of you can take a look at our app and maybe help improve in the repository. We are hoping to create something that we all can use to play with in the blockchain. It uses NFTs, it doesn't have any financial incentive and it's just to have fun, build a community, cross border and we really. Yeah, just go outside and play with the Zusawattaris, our little soot sprites.
00:11:36.454 - 00:12:04.864, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. A round of applause to Susuwatari. What's important in this category, that it's about collaboration and about community. And I think what stands out for the projects who are here and who wants to, who builded something is that they really care about how we interact with each other. And the second place here is visions for the future. Thanks a lot. Congratulations.
00:12:04.864 - 00:12:35.334, Speaker A: Come, come, come. They're in the back. Fundraising platforms supporting others, supporting important causes. If you check their project on the folio, you will be surprised in a positive way. Please, please, please. Oh, round of applause. Hey, guys.
00:12:35.334 - 00:13:22.134, Speaker A: We are digging for future. So we had to look at the current Deegan market, and there are some protocols that enable normies to launch their meme coin in a pretty safe way. But they are not using the goods to do actually something good. So we built a platform where you can raise money for a certain meme token by publishing the meme. Invite your friends, make them vote for the meme that we use collateral to increase the total value locked. Once we reach 50k, we receive the LP pool and burn the LP token so that it's safe. And 20% of the total value locked will be used to put in a multisig that will later be used to, let's say, burn CO2 carbon dioxide certificates.
00:13:22.134 - 00:13:29.254, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Means for good.
00:13:47.854 - 00:14:17.444, Speaker F: All right. Hello, everyone. Perfect. So, yeah, thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for building again this year, or if it was your first time, we hope you had a great time. We have arrived to our last track, our last theme of our main awards, which is Ethereum innovation for sustainable futures. We really didn't want to restrict you in terms of what you're building.
00:14:17.444 - 00:15:04.604, Speaker F: We do believe that Ethereum has the potential to create a more sustainable and decentralized bright future, but we also wanted to combine it with sustainability. That's why we also invited a lot of speakers who are more experts on other fields. We hope that you learned from some of those talks. We hope that you will be able to connect with some of those speakers and people as well. And, yeah, without any further ado, let's check out the first winner, which is also the fortunate team who wins tickets to Defcon in Bangkok this year. Thank you so much for the Defcon team offering this. And the winner is.
00:15:04.604 - 00:15:27.348, Speaker F: Stopper. Come on, guys. Don't be shy. Come on up. And please say a few words about what you were building and your style.
00:15:27.516 - 00:15:28.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:28.308 - 00:15:58.958, Speaker D: So, hi, everyone. I'm Sophia. Here's my colleague, Javier. FYI, we work together. Our desks are together, and since we enjoy having fun working together, we also bring the work here. And we spend these last three days building stapr, which is software destined for automated program repair. So, we're both PhD students, we are researchers, and we often found troubles connecting, sometimes what we do with what actually is going on, on the chain, on the industry.
00:15:58.958 - 00:16:20.884, Speaker D: And we found this hackathon an opportunity to try to improve the way we are going to build our technology in the future by looking at production data to generate tests for smart contracts. So we are really happy here. We combine both of our topics and, yeah, thank you for the judges and for all the feedback we got from the mentors and from the other hikers.
00:16:32.824 - 00:17:21.068, Speaker A: And the second team in the category was having a very entertaining pitch, and they already had an ambitious task to solve throughout the hackathon, and I think they pretty much succeeded. They will be able to describe it better. But without further ado, let me introduce the second team, zarathustra. Hi, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. This was rather unexpected. I think I'm having a huge amount of fun on this event.
00:17:21.068 - 00:18:03.564, Speaker A: How about you guys? I had A Ton of fun. This is probably one of the best hackathons I've ever done, and I'm just thankful I got to spend it with these guys and two more that are sleeping still. Well, I should probably explain what Zartathristra is coming into this eVent. We found that kind of fractured liquidity is a real problem in THe crypto ecosystem. And therefore, we tried to use Eigen layer and the AV's system to kind of improve that problem and to more, like, kind of bigger picture, improve bridging in the crypto ecosystem. So that's what we did for our project. And again, it was a really wonderful event.
00:18:03.564 - 00:18:59.090, Speaker A: I will admit we did pull an all nighter last night. I envy all of those of you who were there with us, kind of powering through. And here's to the next event. So see you guys there. Now let's do one more round of applause for the amazing winners. So, for everyone who submitted hackathon project, you still have a chance to win two more awards beyond the sponsor bounties after this, of course. So first off is the audience favorite award.
00:18:59.090 - 00:19:21.934, Speaker A: The winner will receive one eth from Arthur. Paula, you can go to this QR code over here or to zoopol.org audience. You'll be able to vote on this if you're not a hacker. So if you have a ticket and you're not a hacker, you'll be able to vote on this. Voting will be open for one week. It'll close next Monday at midnight.
00:19:21.934 - 00:19:46.394, Speaker A: And a very similar slide with a different QR code, but the hacker's favorite. So this is for all hackers to vote on. It will also be open for one week. And the awards are $2,000 for first place and $1,000 for second place. I think we've already had around ten or 20 votes on this already.
00:19:57.594 - 00:20:49.544, Speaker C: All right, so now we have the sponsor bounties, and please, Egan. Leah, if you want to come to the stage to announce the winner, we don't have to. So I will just announce. So the winner for Eganlaya bounty. Best use of Eganlaya Av's is Zarathustra. I actually don't have anything to give you this time, but if you want to say a few more words.
00:20:51.564 - 00:21:26.744, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm back. Just like you mentioned the names, I will try to share a few more words then, since I've been given this opportunity, oftentimes I ask myself what I love most about crypto, and I have to say, it is truly the people. And I think about that a lot, and the community is simply amazing. You can't really find it anywhere else. So once again, for the second time, it was awesome spending 72 hours hacking with all of you. I hope I get a second trophy.
00:21:26.744 - 00:21:48.152, Speaker A: That would be pretty cool. You guys have any words? Just a technicality. We won't be inviting all the teams to come on stage right now because there's a lot more, and I see, like, someone's hands already bleeding there. So we'll just do this quick.
00:21:48.208 - 00:21:52.004, Speaker C: Yeah, we're gonna speed it up a little bit. So now we have Internet, computer.

Also to Matisse Ykorra, the amazing stage designer, who has hopefully made us all feel comfortable in this new venue. And then obviously, the usual again, like, thanks to speakers, the attendees, the sponsors, the hackers, everybody who has contributed. And now finally, I would like to ask you to crack your knuckles for the last time.
