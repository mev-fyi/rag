00:00:19.160 - 00:00:55.668, Speaker A: Okay. Hello, hello, hello. Yeah, so today I will bring you another aspect which is maybe not super seenable. And like now in the blockchain world and also in NFT world. And yeah, so like my actual initiative is like Sustain all. And we are a collaboration lab on sustainable development goals, but we are doing also like a different kind of projects. Like I founded also like a flint arts collective, rare collective.
00:00:55.668 - 00:01:30.904, Speaker A: So today I will bring you some examples from two different initiatives. One from artistic perspective, about NFTs, and one is more related to energy and blockchain principles. So how can we bring sustainability in blockchain? So maybe this also helps in the hackathon, because I saw the track called sustainability. So this is super nice, actually. Yeah. So how do I go with this slide? I think here. Exactly.
00:01:30.904 - 00:02:20.124, Speaker A: So I will introduce you first, like sustain all, like my team and what we are doing at the university, at TU Berlin Technical University Berlin. And what is our motivation, what is our aim, what is our motto? And then I will go through like sustainable development goals. Maybe you heard of them, maybe you didn't. And then, yeah, I will bring blockchain. I will try to merge the sustainable growth with blockchain. And what is actually the official initiatives, like United nations. What are they telling about that? I will talk about then our artist collective, which is doing the artworks for sustainability.
00:02:20.124 - 00:04:01.296, Speaker A: It's Raya. And then I will show some artists from the collective and their artworks and how we match the artworks with the sdgs. Okay, so this is my core team and basically, yeah, I'm the founder of Sustain all and rare collective and the sustainable lab at the Theo Berlin. And yeah, as you see, I'm environmental engineer and I developed in my master thesis a concept, how to make the buildings like the public buildings, like climate natural with binding sustainability and new renovation plans, renewable energies, motivating the user in the buildings, how to reduce the energy, how we can educate the people actually to reduce the energy consumption. And yeah, I was bringing all these aspects together and also monitoring the data for one year in one school building in Berlin. And yeah, we also reached, actually this is like another project, but we also reached like a super nice energy consumption in three months, like twelve of consumption of electricity. And yeah, but today I will talk about different projects and yeah, basically my other team member is Gregor, and he's a communication lead and he's also designer.
00:04:01.296 - 00:04:42.714, Speaker A: And maybe if you were in NFT Berlin conference, maybe you saw him also. He was in the core team. And basically the thing is, we are looking for a third or fourth team members because it's super exciting. This is super growing right now. And our developer just left. So we need a tech developer and business developer if you're looking for something to work with us. So our mission is to accelerate the transmission to more sustainable worlds with engaging everyone to our vision.
00:04:42.714 - 00:05:31.684, Speaker A: So basically we are destroying the planet and we are running out of resources to sustain life as we know it. And we need to do something about this. But what? So basically, maybe. So now this is like my research. I'm also checking if NFTs and if blockchain can help save our environment and maybe give long term like sustainability, financial sustainability. And because maybe we are creating some tokens and maybe this can be also like for the land titles and for the carbon credits. Maybe this can be a solution, but we will see.
00:05:31.684 - 00:06:17.986, Speaker A: And so what is the problem? The problem is basically there is a lack of sustainable blockchain based platform which brings people to collaborate and also on innovation and sustainable topics. And one of like most of the flint artists, there are so many artists and they are not visible. And also scientists in the universities, they are doing lots of research projects, but they are also not visible and there are not enough funds. So maybe blockchain can be the solution to bring funds to these sustainable projects. So I will show our concept later. And there is lack of sustainability awareness in the blockchain. So I am laughing.
00:06:17.986 - 00:07:20.728, Speaker A: But yes, you know why? So what is our solution? So we are basically now building like a collaborative platform and lab based on global shared knowledge and skills met with the projects and people there expose themselves and they find partners and funds. But how it works. So basically you are maybe a project maker and you have an idea. So for example, you're a farmer and you want to build a solar panel in your land. But you are missing a workforce because you can't do this alone, right? And maybe you need also an education how to build your solar panel, do it yourself at your land. And then you come to us basically to the platform and you make a call. And then we bring you actually like students or like different project partners, which you can collaborate.
00:07:20.728 - 00:07:56.530, Speaker A: And then at the end you see here the sustainable development goals. Project partner is happy and then sustainable development goals are also a bit reached. But it's important to measure and track this. So what is our impact actually like in every project? So. And now I'm coming to the lab part. So what is actually this calibration lab on sdgs. And I will come later to the sdgs, but I'm showing first the concept.
00:07:56.530 - 00:09:24.170, Speaker A: So basically we are in the lab at the Theo Berlin. We are focusing on every SDG and we are trying to find projects, project partners which we can support every SDG and we bring this project partners to the students. So basically every semester this is a module and every semester it runs and it's like more. And there are like different workshops we are giving like project management workshops, expert talks, excursions, resource discussions. Like we are bringing for 17 sdgs, 17 experts and basically building bridges between university partners, experts and students. And yeah, so this was basically the idea when I was a student, I was thinking, okay, there are like so many technical stuff, it's a technical university and I'm learning lots of nice things, but I want to implement and I want to see like, okay, what's the implementation causing what and yeah, so this is basically our stakeholders, students, project makers and investors. So basically students, they're like starting with actually learning and they're evolving there like directly with the projects to their career and project makers.
00:09:24.170 - 00:10:33.514, Speaker A: They basically project exposure like their projects and also they collaborate, they find funds and they share knowledge. And important factor is investor, of course. So in this part actually coming via to the blockchain and they basically, they can invest, they can return with money, they can have green impact, they can compensate their CO2 emissions. So they're like big companies now, they are trying to do, trying to merge sustainability to their companies and it's super hard for them. And yeah, basically this is like what we are building right now, a platform where you can see in a map with different projects that you can just collaborate, invest, or like you can see the project partners and yeah, our motto is like Tinklobal egglog, collaborate, that sustain all. Yeah, but now I'm coming to the lab team. So basically you see like what we are doing in the lab, like now I'm gonna go to the concept.
00:10:33.514 - 00:11:56.144, Speaker A: So how are we actually merging the sustainability in education? So how universities can actually go more innovative, more like education like in sustainability and also implement this projects. So basically our supervisor is like Andrea Komnola and he's from the Einstein center for Digital Future and also chair, head of, chair of smartwater networks at Hubert. And I'm not going to tell myself again, and Sherwin and Egebach, they're my tutors and they're also helping with the content in the class. So basically sustain lab. So what we are talking is, consists of three different labs, educational lab, project lab and integration and awareness lab. So in the education lab, we are basically trying to foster the education on sdgs. And with guest lecturers on 17 SD's and journal clubs and in the project lab, what we are doing is we are implementing with different partners, non university partners, these projects, and also giving workshops, taking workshops from different initiatives in our lab and also in the integration events lab.
00:11:56.144 - 00:12:40.034, Speaker A: It's not just saying what we are doing in the lab at the university, but we are trying to also make this community events, like bringing actually, what is sustainability? What is the sdgs. We are trying to bring it out. So we are organizing climate days, we are organizing sustainability markets. So there are different community events. And now I'm trying to find the emergency in the blockchain. And yeah, we had different guest speakers on education, ICT, the critics and sustainability, like different digitalizations and like, water SDGs. So we match with every speaker with sdgs.
00:12:40.034 - 00:13:14.786, Speaker A: And like, there are like, different project partners are helping with the students. Like that we bring these partners that they do projects with the students. And at the end, these research projects, they also gain, like, different knowledge. The partners are also learning from students. And also, like, students are learning from partners. So this is like actually like peer to peer and, yeah, here we have a little technical problem, but it's okay, I guess, like here something happened. Yeah.
00:13:14.786 - 00:13:40.684, Speaker A: So basically the idea is we have this pool, right? So we have like different project partners and students every semester. They are like, getting these challenges. So there are like different challenges. Like, for example, like Bay Intelli is bringing like a mobility challenge. So the students are trying to solve, like group of students trying to solve this challenge. German resource center brings like a flood risk management challenge, for example. And then they are trying to solve this challenge.
00:13:40.684 - 00:14:16.124, Speaker A: And then we are collecting, collecting, collecting all these projects. And then we are measuring the impact on sustainability. So, but now I'm going front. So now you see the concept, how it works, how we are doing it. And now I will actually go to the basic terms, what is sustainable development? So I was like saying, okay, we are bringing this guest speakers on 17 different sdgs. And basically. But what is also SDG in the beginning? So, because there's so many people, they actually didn't know.
00:14:16.124 - 00:15:19.694, Speaker A: Like, they don't know when I'm talking about, hey, like SDG, like, most of the people, they don't know it yet. So when I go to the beginning, to the basics. So, sustainable development is a development which meets the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations meet their own needs. So basically, we need to save our resources. So if we just don't, like, reduce, reuse, recycle and we have this planet and we have this boundaries and we can't go outside of the boundaries because this is the boundaries we can go. And that's why we need to find solutions how we can stay in the boundaries. Right? Yeah.
00:15:19.694 - 00:16:03.634, Speaker A: Basically this is a term from United nations, our common future. So this is our common feature. So, like, this is this. We need to do something. Like, we need to get together, we need to collaborate, and we need to find a community that we can sustain ourselves. And, yeah, this is the basic thing that we need to create this united community with increasing environmental awareness, with shared sustainable goals, identifying problems worldwide and suggesting implementation of these sdgs. Okay.
00:16:03.634 - 00:16:30.174, Speaker A: And going to the other basic. What are the sustainable development goals? So they're like, this is the 2030 agenda. So 2030, because we need to reach these goals until 2030. So. And how much time do we have? So it's like 2022. So we have eight years. Okay, cool.
00:16:30.174 - 00:17:24.922, Speaker A: But most of the population doesn't know this term. So this is a thing now, these 17 goals, there are 17 different goals on the sdgs and they have different action areas. So the first area is like putting the human dignity at the center and then the protecting the planet promotes prosperity for all, promote the peace and build global oops and build global partnerships. So we need to come together, we need to think, we need to rethink about our generation and we need to reach these goals in eight years. Okay, so. But there are also critics about this. So this is not something like, okay, this is super good, we are going to do this.
00:17:24.922 - 00:18:07.642, Speaker A: But there are critics on this because how are we going to do it as like citizens? This is the most important question. So we need to educate ourselves and we need to also see, okay, if this is like really implementable. So these goals, actually they have three different dimensions, environmental, economical and also social. So I will show you the goals in detail. So the first one is like non poverty, basically. Yeah. These old goals, like they have super, like for the different countries, they are like, they have different meanings because this is not the same for every country.
00:18:07.642 - 00:19:02.852, Speaker A: And all these goals, they have like different indicators. So I won't go through all of these goals, but just like to hear if you didn't hear about it before. So for example, like climate action, I think you heard of it, right? So basically, yeah, we have one planet. We need to say the climate we introduced to CO2 emissions, for example, like this quality education, like the educating is, for example, maybe here in Europe is something normal, but still there are like some places they don't have this. Right. And for example, like reduce inequalities. Like we see even like now, like women in business, for example, like there are like different kind of indicators which for each goal like this, they are making this pillars like social, economic and environmental.
00:19:02.852 - 00:19:45.612, Speaker A: And we are trying to measure the impact with the projects that we are doing. Okay, which SDG like we are having the impact on. Okay, so this is like the SDG indicator. So what is an SDG indicator? They are basically the indicators. There are like different indicators in each goal. And this indicators helps to target, to check, to measure the goal. So for example, for the indicator like climate change, climate action, we have an indicator as CO2 emission.
00:19:45.612 - 00:20:03.548, Speaker A: So this is our track measurements. So this is for the info. But so how are we gonna implement this SDG? So this is the thing. So first we need to understand. So you are seeing it right now. We are understanding about it. We are trying to reflect about it.
00:20:03.548 - 00:20:50.034, Speaker A: Okay, which SDG, what I'm doing in my life, maybe which I can have an impact on. And then we are defining the priorities and then we are seeing it. Okay, this SDG is important. Maybe for example your company or what you are doing it right now and then you are setting the goals. And then after you set the goals, then you start to integrate. And we see now we will see, okay, how we can integrate these sdgs to the blockchain. What's happened? I think I clicked on something else.
00:20:50.034 - 00:21:52.944, Speaker A: Should I click again? I see it here, but sorry for that. So like blockchain and sustainability. So basically on this thing, like united nations, they already published about, okay, maybe blockchain technology will help and maybe they will be like an instrumental in funding these goals. And like for example, like NFTs and also like blockchain technology, they can be a funding source for the projects, for the sustainable projects. And then what we thought about, okay, but we are minting something. For example, for the NFTs, when you mint, like, I will show also like the numbers, like for example in ethereum, like it's super. Sadly, it's too much.
00:21:52.944 - 00:22:40.714, Speaker A: So then we said, okay, maybe we can compensate these emissions through the projects that we are doing. So we get the money and we compensate. So it's like win win. But actually the NFTs are also damaging the environment because it's proof that they have a higher consumption than several countries. Okay, so what are we gonna do? So first of all, why blockchain? So because like now I'm merging with the sustainability. So now I'm not starting like blockchain, like 101. 101.
00:22:40.714 - 00:23:24.956, Speaker A: But it's really like if you're thinking of energy and climate change. So SDG seven, clean energy and affordable energy. So if you're thinking of it. So it's actually blockchain can automate the electricity consuming systems. For example, they can automate the smart meters, which for example, it shows like for example in the building when there is no need to put the light on, they can actually, with the smart contracts, they can actually automate the systems. And this is actually, this is for the sustainable community. This is super good because this is decentralized.
00:23:24.956 - 00:24:12.344, Speaker A: So basically if we have our decentralized energy in our own houses, our pv systems, wind systems, so we don't need actually the central authorities to get the electricity and we don't need to pay them. Right. And this is transparent. Like it's, I mean it's not like, okay, I give you this, you gave me this later, like a banking curbsies. It's something transparent. So like basically we see in the traditional database, centralized trust environment. Okay, we have the database, we have the central authority, and then we are the participants as citizens and we can have the access through this authority.
00:24:12.344 - 00:25:31.294, Speaker A: But if we have like a decentralized blockchain environment and actually like we are the participants, maybe more happier because we can optimize like our own energy resources and yeah, so this is like the thing which you can merge with the sustainability and blockchain. And so like here comes like more explanations. So this is actually like the key priority, as we said, decentralization is super important for the energy savings and also like to be, to maintain our sustainable living and sustainable communities. And so for the transparency. So every peer knows the data. So you can see actually in your smartphone, you can see like how much energy you're consuming, how much like not just from the bills, but you have your own data and you can just play with it, you can just optimize it. And then it's also like, since there is a transparency, any peer can also verify the correctness of the state of distributed ledger.
00:25:31.294 - 00:26:42.706, Speaker A: And it's also any peer can verify the integrity of the distributed ledger. So, but what is like the application actually to energy and climate solutions? So energy market decentralization lies, enhancing a combination of blockchain technologies with artificial intelligence, the Internet of things like smart meters, I was talking about. And also like affordable renewable energy production. For example, solar panels on your rooftop and storage equipment, like batteries. So you can storage actually your own energy, you can create your own energy, you can store it, you can use it. You can make your hot water and this will be your own resource so you can sustain your actually house. Right? So actually, how is this like this technology, like closing the loop and maybe in climate financing and accounting.
00:26:42.706 - 00:27:35.256, Speaker A: So you're seeing here like we have like the financial capitals and they are basically bringing like optimizing the process, like to climate action. And we have the value, it's positive, positive and we have the account. So it's like a loop and it's closed. So this means like it's also like a life cycle. Thinking it's closing the loop means something good, right? So like for the sustainability. And so you see for example, you, you just imagine that you are this guy or. Yeah, and you are sitting here and you have your own project.
00:27:35.256 - 00:28:13.476, Speaker A: And just imagine that you can basically decentralize your decentralized project. You can do it and you have an impact on the climate value directly with your project operation through aggregation business models of blockchain. So basically what is like the emissions? So like let's come to the point. The emissions was the carbon footprint of like one NFT. Because I was talking about, okay, blockchain is like good. Like nfts are good. Maybe we can sustain our lives.
00:28:13.476 - 00:29:05.434, Speaker A: Maybe we can just like fund our like sustainable projects. And so there are like two different kinds of like sake of proof, stake of work. I think you already heard about it. Sake of proof is like carbon natural mean thing, but sake of work. So like here is like comes the point that we need to actually like think, okay, how are we gonna, if you are doing this job, how are we going to make it sustainable, right? So we need to think about it. It's not like, hey, yeah, I have bitcoins like an ethereum. So this is not super, like, I mean, you know, we need to think about like if you're mean thing like this nfts, we need to think about, okay, this is like my carbon footprint actually as a human being.
00:29:05.434 - 00:30:07.654, Speaker A: Like this number you see like 33.4, I'm doing this all the time. 4 is like one of the production of one ethereum. When you are minting it in the Ethereum blockchain and one person in one year produces also 11.3 ton carbon CO2 per person. So if you compare, like in your mind, like how is the difference? It's actually a lot. So we need to find solutions how, if you're doing this business, if you are in blockchain, if you're in NFT world, we need to find solutions how to bring sustainability inside and how we are gonna make it carbon neutral and how we are going to compensate, like the emissions.
00:30:07.654 - 00:30:57.034, Speaker A: And so. And at that point I said, okay, this is like super good what we are doing at university. Like, we have our project lab, we are inviting speakers and we are working directly with students, project partners. But how I can bring to the blockchain. This is the NFT world actually, like sustainability with doing something different at that moment. Like it was actually super new. It was four months ago, I was talking with a friend of mine, an artist, and it's actually then at that point we started this rare.
00:30:57.034 - 00:31:55.454, Speaker A: So like Raya is a collective, like this fill in artists collective and which we are aiming like that we make a difference in the blockchain, like in the NFT world with our arts on sustainability. So our aim is basically exploring like the blockchain and nfts and contributing the fulfillment of the United nations sdgs with our artworks and also in the community of women, intersex, trans folk and non binary people. And the motto is, okay, the 17 sdgs are at the heart of agenda, like 2030. And we need to find, like, we need to find the merge, like with the blockchain technology and with the nfts. So. And then we made a concept. Oh, I have a big tree.
00:31:55.454 - 00:32:29.178, Speaker A: So we made a concept. We said, okay, let's organize an open call and let's check the artists. Like maybe they will do something for like sustainable, like an artworks, like, and matching with their sustainability. And then with this artworks, maybe we can mint nfts and then we can make. We can fund our sustainable projects in the sustainable lab. So then we make like a financial concept. We said, okay, arts gets percentages, NGO gets percentages that artists use sustainable guests percentages.
00:32:29.178 - 00:33:08.634, Speaker A: NFT company gets percentages. Project team gets percentage. But the main point is that we are like, with this NFT fundings, we are giving like the most of the resources to the NGO's and like the sustainable projects and we can skip this. And then like in the first open call, we already covered so much sdgs. This was like unbelievable. Like 1234-5678 I add on eight. So we were like covering actually lots of the sdgs and we were like trying to see, okay, it's actually doable.
00:33:08.634 - 00:34:02.658, Speaker A: So I will go now to the apung gallery. So you can just see how did we do it, actually? So the first artist is Hatije. And she basically did this 3d art and matching with the gender equality SDG. The other one was like this life on land and Life low water sdgs matching this 3d artworks. And then the other one was like Jemre, and she was doing the new world era. It's also kind of like matching with the climate change and sustainable communities because this was like this basically pointing to carbon footprints, like this artwork. And the other one was like Carolyn.
00:34:02.658 - 00:34:52.884, Speaker A: And she was doing this, like, gaia images, like, with the AI. And she was basically also matching with the seven, the SDG seven sustainable communities. And the other one was like Petya. And she was basically, she did this woman, like, this emotional, materialized woman with this healing, healing bioplastic. So this is basically also going into the direction of, like, gender and also, like, this plastic usage and. Yeah, and she did actually, like, a tattoo, but I think, like, this tattoo was here, but something happened, so. But if you want, I can show it later.
00:34:52.884 - 00:35:41.274, Speaker A: And set up was this. Oh, and Bruno was like, doing basically, like, the feminine, like, cool, like this, bringing, like, the feminism, like, up and bringing, like, woman in this world, like, because I think nft world is, like, lots of men and. Yeah, and then we had also another 3d artist. She did a video, but I think it's. Yeah, I think the videos are gone somehow or. Yeah, anyway, so the Mikko was also, like, working on the aesthetics of, like, the nature. So you see, like, life is a flower.
00:35:41.274 - 00:36:15.976, Speaker A: Life is a flower, but we need to give this flower, like, water. Right? And Shurian was also doing, like, different burning pixels of, like, this climate action and digital, like, fashion. And, like, for the sustainable comedies, she did also some different videos. And this is actually moving image, but it's not moving here right now. But, yeah, I can, like, I can send you this. These artworks are also in the website, actually. And Mimi was also, like a.
00:36:15.976 - 00:36:37.420, Speaker A: This was, this is like an artwork from her. And this was. She was doing this coffee capsules, circular thinking, like, seeing, basically, you see this, all the coffee capsules around her. And maybe, like, thinking of, like, this. Each capsule is basically. Yeah, okay, so I'm going fast. So.
00:36:37.420 - 00:37:16.756, Speaker A: But this is the last artist, Stacy. And she is also empowering, like, the female identity. And you can see all these, like, artworks. This will be also in the platform and will be also sold soon. So, yeah, actually I'm coming to end. You see our concepts, like, two different initiatives, like sustain all rare collective, the collaboration lab at the table Berlin. So basically, this all needs, like, of course, maybe, like, this is the community.
00:37:16.756 - 00:37:42.834, Speaker A: Maybe I can ask for. If you are interested, you can just come to me, talk to me, write to me on LinkedIn, everywhere. So basically we need this all because this is bringing together, collaborating for a sustainable future. So we need, of course, investors. We need more artists in our collective. But we were already, like 30 right now. Of course.
00:37:42.834 - 00:38:28.984, Speaker A: Like, why not more and more students? Like, who would like to join the class? And it's every semester, it's 30 students in the lab and. Yeah, and developers, of course. So there are like some resources. You can find it and, yeah, basically this is like the official ones, like EU Giz and like United nations. And you can reach us from our website. You can just scan the QR codes, Instagram, LinkedIn. If you're a student, you can go to the portal and, yeah, basically I'm super on time.
00:38:28.984 - 00:38:35.424, Speaker A: Thank you so much. And, yeah, this was it.
00:38:43.174 - 00:38:48.566, Speaker B: Okay, I think we have a bit of time for some questions. If anyone has any questions in the audience.
00:38:48.630 - 00:38:49.734, Speaker A: I forgot about the question.
00:38:49.814 - 00:39:01.314, Speaker B: There's a roving microphone. Okay, then I guess we will take it from here.
00:39:01.654 - 00:39:06.844, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much. It.
