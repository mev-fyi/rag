00:00:00.200 - 00:00:00.728, Speaker A: Yeah, hello.
00:00:00.766 - 00:00:01.518, Speaker B: I think so.
00:00:01.646 - 00:00:16.718, Speaker A: Okay, thanks. Thanks everybody. Thanks for being here. I can see there is a massive audience. So that's great. Put your hands up. That's right.
00:00:16.718 - 00:00:32.324, Speaker A: That's right. That's some kind of a. We are batching. We are batching people to. Okay, cool. So let's get started. So first, thank you everybody for being here.
00:00:32.324 - 00:01:12.598, Speaker A: It's a pleasure. So welcome to this stocknet talk. So it's gonna be a brief overview of Stocknet, what you can do, what is cool basically. Also we're gonna have, we're gonna discuss about, again, a lot of things, use cases, what you can do on stocknet very, in a very broad way. Also more specifically on account abstraction apply to, to games just to give a good use case, which is a big narrative for stocknets. But I mean we're going to get into this a little later. So yeah, basically use cases, bit of overview of what you can do on stocknet abstraction through on chain games.
00:01:12.598 - 00:01:45.434, Speaker A: We're also going to discuss the developer experience with David. So basically let's first introduce myself. So I'm Eli, I'm a stacked ambassador. Focus on, on chain gaming mostly. And yeah, we're going to discuss, I'm going to discuss indeed economic traction applied to games mostly. David is going to discuss developer experience and we also have the adapt products. We may have, may talk some words at the end if we have time.
00:01:45.434 - 00:02:37.530, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So first, yeah, so what is cool about stocknet? So there's a lot of things, I mean, so just I'm sure all of you know what Stocknet is all about. So just very quick recap. So Stocknet is a Zk roll up aiming at scaling ethereum using torque. So basically the ideas like any other l two s, just to use the security of l one ethereum while doing the execution on another layer which is starting for us. So yeah, so that's the main thing. So like any other l two s, the end goals indeed is scaling ethereum, which means in the long term to have transaction much cheaper and much faster.
00:02:37.530 - 00:03:21.274, Speaker A: But that's like the aim of any other l two. So I would say there is two main features when it comes to stocknet. So there is first the language that is specific. So on Stocknet, the programming language is chiral, which is a language that is made, made to measure to leverage ZKP. I mean starks like. So the language is made to leverage the full potential of ZKP. I mean at the moment it's more validity proof because we don't really use a privacy layer, but whatever, that's just a detail.
00:03:21.274 - 00:04:10.456, Speaker A: So basically the main thing is. So one of the two main features is contrary to other kvms, Stacknet has a very specific language that is made by measure, to measure to use the full potential of ZKP, which means it's a bit of a bio to re entry because it's tough for the new commerce. I mean they need to learn a new language, it's tough. But on the other hand, it's also the best way to design super, super precise apps. You're not limited by design, by the, the EVM structure. So you can basically do whatever you want. Much more finer stuff using Cairo than ZKVM, this being said.
00:04:10.456 - 00:04:44.606, Speaker A: So basically, just to give a very quick analogy. So it's like if you want to talk, communicate with somebody that doesn't speak the same language as you, you have two options, whether you can use some kind of like Google Translate or whatever AI you can use. So it's super convenient. You can discuss, it works very well, but you will always be limited to what? To the way you can communicate. So you will never be able to read a book using Google Translate. So it's convenient, but you will be always limited. The second option is to learn the language of the person you want to talk to.
00:04:44.606 - 00:05:27.624, Speaker A: So it's much harder, takes much more time, it's much less convenient. But at the end of the day you can be much more precise, you can be much more deep, you can be much deeper in the communication you will have with a person. So that's the same idea with Cairo versus using solid C. That is not by design made to be used for ZK features. This being said, that's not the main thing. The Cairo is a big change from other Altus, but one of, of the, the main game changer that is very specific to stocknet is a kind of abstraction. So a kind of extraction.
00:05:27.624 - 00:06:02.130, Speaker A: I mean we had a great, great talk yesterday from the Ethereum foundation team. We talked very, very great in very clearly way. They introduced very well eip of 43 37. So I'm not going to discuss much more like a lot of what it's about. Maybe I can give a very quick recap for those who, I have no idea what construction is. So basically we have two kinds of accounts. So there is EOA, that's your ledger, your metamask, whatever.
00:06:02.130 - 00:06:27.542, Speaker A: So it's basically an account that is external to the blockchain. Yeah. So that's basically what we have today. It's not programmable, it's super yeah, so it's external to the blockchain. On the other end you have also new accounts, which is smart accounts, also smart wallets. So basically it's a wallet that is basically your wallet is a smart contract. So it's fully programmable.
00:06:27.542 - 00:07:11.526, Speaker A: You can do whatever, you can program whatever you want with it. So it brings a lot of new stuff. So yeah, you can basically set up in advance a lot of things. You can set up automated swaps. You can set up, I don't know, whatever you want. You can set up black and white addresses, you can basically design your, you can program your wallet the way you want, which is super useful. So basically a few use case when it comes to programmable wallets or smart wallets.
00:07:11.526 - 00:08:11.966, Speaker A: So you can basically, you can create, you can set up plugins that will extend the functionality of your account, which is super convenient. You can also have account recovery systems. So basically today, if you lose your, I mean with EOA, if you lose your private key, I mean, you're basically done. Like you all say, it's not super convenient, but yeah, so basically with recovery systems like Argent or Bravo's doors, you can set up a new ways to recover your private key if needed. Again, you need to set it up, the conditions to get it, you can have multiple parties to have a way to recover. So that's a great thing. But basically, I would say the main thing, it's a weird game changer construction is it's going to be the new way to bring the masses full adoption to web3.
00:08:11.966 - 00:08:53.748, Speaker A: I mean, I know this, that in a big word to say math adoption, the next million user is going to come through or whatever, but going to be the case, why? Because accounts create the experience. Super, super frictionless, super, even crypto less people don't even know they use crypto. I mean when you. Yeah, so it's super, super convenient. Your grandma can basically use it without knowing she's using, she's doing crypto basically. So that's really, really cool. You can basically also unlock your wallets through Face iD.
00:08:53.748 - 00:09:33.504, Speaker A: You can do multi sig. I mean you can basically set up your wallet the way you want. Another great features from extraction is the use case of gaming because if you want to, I mean for fully on chain games, obviously. So games that are fully on chain. What I mean by games that are fully on chain, it's game that all the components of the game is on chain. When you take today games like, I don't know, axies step in those kind of games that really webs games, it's like 95% off chain with maybe like a 5% on chain components. And 5% is already being generous.
00:09:33.504 - 00:10:41.034, Speaker A: But so on the contrary, full on chain games are games that are in which all the components is on chain, which means every piece of the game, like a Lego, is unchained and you can basically plug it, you can take it off. I mean you can just basically everything is on chain, which means if it's on chain that you need to sign, you need to sign every transaction, every movie, every action you do in the game needs to be signed somehow. So I mean, can you imagine a user experience if in your game you need to sign every 5 seconds? That's impossible to play. So a construction through session keys can allow you to set up in advance the entire scope of what you can done within a game. So basically the session key will sign for you in the background all the actions you need to do in a game while being fully on chain. So basically, if you need to buy it in your game resource, you need to build a castle, you need, I don't know, to sell sword or whatever. Everything will be signed by the session key.
00:10:41.034 - 00:11:22.740, Speaker A: So again, you don't even experience the crypto, the signing thing while playing a web two game, which is obviously a game changer for games. And again, I mean the gaming market is massive. So the next. The best way to onboard people to web Suite also is for games. And this will be the complete game changer to bring the masses and stacknets by having this native extraction allow us to do so. I mean, I can give an example of teams that does this. I mean, today on Stockton, we have Dojo, which is like a public good.
00:11:22.740 - 00:12:04.580, Speaker A: Like a game engine that is a full library that is available for ifbody that allows you to build a stack of fully onchain games. You also have teams like cartridge, who have done what we call a secure enclave, which means you can. So basically cartridge is a full on chain gaming console where you can play game full on chain. And within this secure and cloud you can play it and you have this session key, et cetera, et cetera. A lot of new games that is getting super popular still on Stocknet. Like we have loot survivors, which has an amazing traction. Loot survivors, which has an amazing traction.
00:12:04.580 - 00:12:48.456, Speaker A: I mean, I could give a lot of examples, but it demonstrates how construction has changed the game when it comes to new people. And native abstraction from Stockinette allows to do it in a very simple way. Yeah, I could talk a little more about cartridge. I mean, I guess if you have questions, I can answer them. I'd love to, but yeah, maybe let's get a little. I'm not sure we have too much time, so I'm not gonna stick too much on this, but yeah, so basically that's the main use case. And just since we had also had a great talk yesterday about counterfaction, but from the perspective from the AIP 4337, maybe we can explain a bit, bit what it means.
00:12:48.456 - 00:13:51.600, Speaker A: The difference between a native construction versus not a native like EAP 37. So yes, basically. So on a technical level, the difference is a construction on Stacknet is on the protocol level, which is not the case on 4337, which is on the contract level. Also on Stocknet, you need to deploy your contract before the first transaction, which is not the case with 43 37. And also the gas you have to pay is also determined by the sequencer on Stocknet versus the market for EIP 43 37. I mean, I could go a little more deep into the technical aspects. Is technically implemented on stock.
00:13:51.600 - 00:14:26.684, Speaker A: But again, I guess I can leave this. I'm not sure we have too much time, so I can leave these two questions, but basically as a very quick explainer. So on Stocknet, every transaction goes through the sequencer. So the sequencer goes, is the one that handles all the transactions. And so to verify, to set the transaction order, to verify them, to execute them also. And to also build a brick to build the blocks. My bad.
00:14:26.684 - 00:15:14.904, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's, that operates. And contrary to EIP 5337 on Stocknet, the sequencer also operates as a blockbuilder. But again, that's a little technical. I'm not sure if it's super relevant. I mean, if you guys have questions and girls, feel free to ask. Yeah, I think, but again, I think the thing to remember, to keep in mind is the mass adoption needs to go through something that is super frictionless for the newcomers. I mean, you can expect people to know how to manipulate crypto, about to know how to keep seed for it, etcetera, to be able to join the web sui ecosystem and having this experience that is super frictionless.
00:15:14.904 - 00:15:56.414, Speaker A: People don't even know they're using crypto. And especially through the lens of on chain games, that's, that is going to be a mass change and the best way to bring the masses, people to the web3 ecosystem. Again, sorry, I think we're running a little bit of time. So now I'm going to give the mic to David, who is going with building Carmine an option protocol on Stocknet. So he's going to give his developer experience and. Yeah, so thank you for listening.
00:16:01.754 - 00:16:31.070, Speaker B: Hi, I'm David. I'm from Carmine Finance and we have built options amm on Starknet. So we're one of the early adapters somewhat. And yeah, it was really nice working with Starknet. So I'm just here to tell you that it's awesome and if you're considering finding a new l two to build something beautiful on Starknet is definitely a place to go. And I want to speak about the community because I think that the Starknet people are really amazing. And whenever we were stuck, we had some problems.
00:16:31.070 - 00:17:08.224, Speaker B: There was always somebody to talk to us and help us work through the problems. So really everybody's welcoming and I'm gonna give a quick shout out to the discord where you can find channel for basically absolutely any problem that you run into. There's like channel for everything. Also we, the Carmine finance, are Prague based. Our core team are everyone from Prague. One guy is from Brno, which is like pretty close. So if you're also in Prague, definitely join the Starknet Prague on Meetup because we have done two meetups so far and both were awesome.
00:17:08.224 - 00:17:50.494, Speaker B: So looking forward to the third one. So if you're ever in Prague, join the meetup group and make sure to show when the next one is happening. Also I want to give a shout out to all the open source projects that are so helpful. I'm going to start with the Cairo Starlinks, which is. So if you're writing smart contracts on Starknet, you're writing it in Cairo. It used to be Cairo version Zero, which was a bit of a pain, but now there's Cairo one, which is, its syntax is very much like Rust and Starknet build this amazing project which walks you through how to write Cairo, how it works. And it's absolutely amazing.
00:17:50.494 - 00:18:18.570, Speaker B: It will teach you everything. And it starts, it's built for the complete beginners, but if you're knowledgeable, you're going to just breeze through it. Oh, rust is the best language. Everybody knows that, right? Who writes here in Rust? Yeah. Awesome, awesome. So if you want to start building on Starknet, this is definitely a place to start stark links. That's if you're writing the back end, the smart contracts.
00:18:18.570 - 00:18:46.134, Speaker B: If you're a front end developer, much like myself, I went through the stark links just to sort of like, know what it's all about and it's definitely awesome. There's Starknet J's for connecting your front end to the backend. And Cairo Zero has awesome type systems. So parsing the responses from the blockchain has never been easier. And it's absolutely amazing. Starknit JS is developed by the community. That's right.
00:18:46.134 - 00:19:05.814, Speaker B: I'm not lying. Right. Yeah, it's open source and it works perfectly. It's really nice. There's also the Starknet react, which is built by Apybara. Apibara is a. Okay.
00:19:05.814 - 00:19:40.094, Speaker B: Didn't know that. Thank you. Yeah, also, so Apybara, they have built amazing indexer that works, I think, not only on Starknet, but it's also on Starknet if you need to index some events or anything. And Yannick from Apybara, he built Starknet React, which gives you all the hooks that you might need if you're writing your app in react. And I'm pretty sure that react is the number one framework for all the web, three, everything. So if you're writing in react, this will definitely help you jumpstart your project. This is also amazing.
00:19:40.094 - 00:20:37.404, Speaker B: This is fairly recent, the Starknet Gate, which has been built by people from Argent, which is one of the two biggest wallets on Starknet. And this will help you set up your wallet and connect it with the app. And it's really, really easy to use if you're interested in any of this, in how it works, how to connect it. Tomorrow at Lobkowitz Palazz, I'm going to have a workshop on how to build an app on Starknet. So I'm going to show you within 55 minutes how to start from create react app and get to an app where you can read data from Starknet, you can write to Starknet, you can connect your user's wallet. And it's really fast to do, super easy if you know all the write libraries which are those. So I'm looking forward to meeting you at Starknet Meetup in Prague sometime soon and.
00:20:37.404 - 00:20:41.664, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it, I guess. So if you guys have any questions.
00:20:42.564 - 00:20:47.052, Speaker A: You can mention North Guardians and other community.
00:20:47.148 - 00:20:49.424, Speaker B: No, you can go for it.
00:20:50.284 - 00:21:13.344, Speaker A: And also if you. There's also, as David said, there's an amazing community. You can also step in on Cairo with node Guardians crass. And you also have an amazing community where you can use only dos, which is a place where you can participate to project and being paid for it. So it's also a great way to step in and to get involved.
