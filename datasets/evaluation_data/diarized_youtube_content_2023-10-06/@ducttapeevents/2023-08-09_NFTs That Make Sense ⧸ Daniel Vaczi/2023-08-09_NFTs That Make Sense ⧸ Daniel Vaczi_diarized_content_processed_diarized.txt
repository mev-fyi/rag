00:00:16.840 - 00:00:51.382, Speaker A: Good morning, guys. How are you? How many of you went out last night? Hands up. It's a good crowd. Okay, well, it's really nice to be here. Yesterday we had a stream from our CEO. While I come from a company called galaxies, Andre scheduled seven minutes stream, and everyone left the room, unfortunately, because there was an announcement happened outside. So I'd like to ask you to go on YouTube and check out his seven minutes talk on the platform, because I do believe that he.
00:00:51.382 - 00:01:14.374, Speaker A: He talked about something revolutionary and what we're trying to achieve at galaxies. So, without further ado, let's kick off. So there was a lot of talk about coding. I'd like to actually touch on other topics here. And my chosen topic is nfts. That make sense. Cool.
00:01:14.374 - 00:01:52.226, Speaker A: So let's go back in the past, in December 2020, when a relatively unknown artist sold his artwork during one weekend for $3.5 million. And that was quite extraordinary. What do you guys think? He sold his very first art, actually. Do you know the year or the month? That was his first collection, actually, ever. He never sold anything else before. And do you think that was because of.
00:01:52.226 - 00:02:28.848, Speaker A: Put your hands up if you think that was because of the bubble. So you think it was a bubble or you think he actually started the bubble? You put your hands up twice for the same answer. Okay. So, yeah, he actually started the whole bubble that we, I think, currently live in. And I think most people agree that we do live in a hype, hyped up markets and a bubble. But nevertheless, that's not what I want to talk about. He actually proved two things to us with what we call the beebles.
00:02:28.848 - 00:03:14.074, Speaker A: Proof that people are willing to pay for digital art, which was not the case before. And the second is that people don't care about copy protection. And here I need to highlight, this is not copyright protection, because people do care about copyright protection. Right. It is copy protection that they don't care about. So what I mean by that copy protection, is that I don't care or the artists don't care, whether you can download the file and display it on your website or share it across your social media fans or followers or friends. We also learned two other things, is that people care about two provenance and scarcity.
00:03:14.074 - 00:03:46.374, Speaker A: Provenance is a solid proof that the art was indeed created and came from the artist. A solid proof. And scarcity a solid proof, again, that there are only limited number of these nfts in existence and which technology can do that. Why are you here? Because of nfts. Okay, so that's what actually nfts prove to us this is what we can do. We don't care about copy protection. We don't care about if someone can download and use our files.
00:03:46.374 - 00:04:28.174, Speaker A: Pardon? Okay, so that actually nice leads to DRM. Okay. And I want to talk about how DRM is done, right. So I guess most of you guys know DRM stands for digital right management, okay? But DRM has always been cursed right from the start. It actually doesn't protect either side. It's actually bad for the artist, bad for the creator, because the end user can't experience the art and his creation or her creation. And it's bad from the end user perspective as well, because just it limits the experience.
00:04:28.174 - 00:05:51.180, Speaker A: Now the only party that can actually profit from the DRM and DRM software and solutions are the companies who designed these solutions. So yes, we don't like DRM, but there's a right way of doing DRM, which is of course non fungible tokens. This is the right way of doing digital right management because the same thing, if you go and see a museum, they don't care if you take a picture and put it up on your Facebook profile. Okay, so we talked about artists and the NFT technology is cool for artists, but there is actually quite a lot of use cases that I want to cover. I think it is really just the person's imagination, knowledge of the technology and the knowledge of the industry that limits the use of nfts. And later on I'll show you the different companies and creative people that we worked with or the project that we want to showcase because they have taken NFT beyond art. And some of these are startups, startup accelerators, social good projects.
00:05:51.180 - 00:06:40.414, Speaker A: And there are so many examples, but I can only show you about five or six. So we'll come back to these. So let's go into the utilities now because this is the whole point of my presentation. I think NFTs will only make sense if they have utilities, if they have use cases, if they have a purpose. We truly believe that pfbs simple pictures will not actually be viable in the long run. They don't have longevity. What we really want to do and what actually we are trying to achieve at galaxies as well, that the projects that we launch and the companies that we work with or the people that we work with, they want to actually have some sort of meaningful thing behind the collection.
00:06:40.414 - 00:07:06.554, Speaker A: They have a purpose. Now if a token doesn't have a utility, then this is what happens. It actually creates a very unstable market. Right. And while it's good for some people to be in these volatile markets. But I don't like to be operating in an up and down market. You cannot even plan ahead properly.
00:07:06.554 - 00:07:34.284, Speaker A: So what does this chart remind you of? Of course, bitcoin. Right. A token only blockchain. And there are so many other pfps out there that are doing exactly the same. So we like to go away from that. The NFT, the blockchain has to have a purpose, have to have a higher meaning apart from just being a token only blockchain. So I'll give you an example.
00:07:34.284 - 00:07:59.640, Speaker A: Things in real life that have a use case are buildings, for example. They're actually useful for people. So the price is steady over time. They don't actually fracture. Well, exclude Dubai and markets and cities like that, but they do actually stable. Of course there are other products as well that are useful for us. They have a shorter lifespan, but their price is actually stable because it anchored to utilities.
00:07:59.640 - 00:08:31.908, Speaker A: Anchored to things that are useful. So we believe in that. Utilities mitigate speculation. That's why it's important to have utilities now. Okay, I talked about utilities, but I guess you're asking, okay, well, tell me what utilities you can do. And what are utilities really? So this is an example from a project that we recently launched. It's called girls, robots and dragons, or GRD fan.
00:08:31.908 - 00:09:06.716, Speaker A: This is the website where you can go, I'm actually demoing the card which you'll find at the bottom. You can play around with this as well. So here for example, you can book an online meeting with the artist who created this collection. And you can do this right from the NFT. And this is not just how it looks like on the website. This is how it looks like on Opensea as well when the reveal is going to happen. But if you want to look at the real life example, then you have to look at the ether cards.
00:09:06.716 - 00:09:48.858, Speaker A: Ether cards actually are displayed on Opensea as well with the same sort of like utilities. And again, utilities have to make sense to your audience. So when we launched this project, we really wanted to connect the artists with his or the artists because the two with their fan base. So we created, we added online meetings, autographs, rewards, merchandise, etcetera. But I think you need to think, what can I give to my audience that actually makes sense? It might be completely different. So I think it just loops. The demo is loops.
00:09:48.858 - 00:10:24.944, Speaker A: But please go onto the website and have a look. It's not actually super expensive because ethereum is on a discount right now, as you guys know. So you can go and play around with this. So I cannot go away without talking about community, because we talked about the technology and the use cases. But the community and role of community is extremely important when it comes to making a project successful. I think no one can disagree with that. Without the end users, there's no success.
00:10:24.944 - 00:11:19.712, Speaker A: So there's a huge part in this. What we see and what we believe and actually oppose at galaxies is we don't want to do campaigns that the KPI's, the key performance indicators are sell the ten k collection as fast as possible, push the floor price up as high as possible. And that is our success measurement. This is exactly what we don't want. Because how do you achieve that? You achieve that during actually just doing hype, pump and dump schemes, right? And most of the collections out there actually operate at this level. What we want to do is that we actually want to build communities over time. We want to create communities that grow naturally.
00:11:19.712 - 00:12:03.362, Speaker A: And communities, real communities, actually take time, take months and months and years sometimes to grow. And yes, it's more effort, and yes, it's more dedication. And you have to live and breathe where you're communicating. Not just do a short month, month and a half run, but you really have to plan out a full year ahead or longer. What you're going to be communicating, how you're going to get the community involved and to get the community involved for that longer period of time. What you have to have is of course, utilities, something that actually gives back to the community. Otherwise, of course, no one is doing, everyone is doing it for free, but for nothing.
00:12:03.362 - 00:12:51.018, Speaker A: That's a good way of saying it. So you want utilities that will actually power this whole cycle. But again, it leads to a nice next chapter here. Next section is contributors economy. Now, contributors economy is, I found the best example actually contributed economy is like Ethereum staking. Do you guys know Ethereum staking? It's essentially, do you want to talk about it? Then? No. Okay, so Ethereum staking essentially rewards people or companies who come in and support a network and help the network secure the network or do certain tasks.
00:12:51.018 - 00:13:29.514, Speaker A: You have deposits, a tiny amount of 32 ETH, and then you can join the club who can then support the network. But then essentially you stake the 32 ETH and then in return, of course you get rewards, but you have essentially a stake in this whole thing. You want the whole system to go well and do well. So that's probably the best way to describe contributor economy. When you think about how this is done perfectly well. And then we arrive to the use cases now, I want to make it real. I want to give you some examples and I hope I'm going to inspire you with these examples.
00:13:29.514 - 00:14:13.784, Speaker A: The first one is betwix, which is essentially an NFT book. NFT book. What it does, actually, it was designed by healthcare professionals. And as you go through the book and you make choices within the book, it changes the COVID of the book, the NFT. So you see on the left, this is how the visual changes. And it actually, at the end, by the time you finish the book, it shows your sort of like state of mind or personality or whatever the topic is. So it's a pretty cool way of actually engaging people and getting people in the other one.
00:14:13.784 - 00:14:54.584, Speaker A: Posi IO. It is a fantastic use of nfts and utilities. Posiio just launched Posi cards. NfTs, essentially what they were trying to do is to come into this. They are a startup accelerator and incubator. What they are trying to do is incentivize both sides, the startup and the investor as well, with nfts and utilities, and grow them together, essentially, and also mitigating the risk that typically involves when you invest in a startup. And we have five minutes left.
00:14:54.584 - 00:15:37.404, Speaker A: So we have crypto hedge. Crypto Hedge is an indie filmmaker from South Africa. These guys actually created this little film about autism acceptance. It is essentially when you buy an NFT, you have maybe an input in the creative direction of the film, or you can actually redeem props from the scene, from the movie. So pretty cool way of actually getting funded. Indie films are notoriously sort of struggling. They usually struggle with fundraising and ens.
00:15:37.404 - 00:16:27.524, Speaker A: We talked about Ens yesterday, so I'm not going to cover that. But actually ens, NFTs are not for sale. NfTs, you earn them by performing certain tasks similar to ethereum staking. And then I had to pop this in yesterday. This is pretty cool project from Honduras, I think they called web three beach. Essentially you can see the amount of rubbish that typically gets on today ashores because they are tiny island and they get from the surrounding water, of course, and the countries as well. And they created these NFTs to encourage the local youth and also the travelers to get involved with beach cleanups.
00:16:27.524 - 00:17:22.008, Speaker A: And what this NFT does, it actually rewards you for doing, of course, beach cleanups. You can see the amount of rubbish that these guys managed to collect. The NFT actually tracks the amount of rubbish that you collect and also how the coral and the beach actually coming back to life. So it's sort of like a governance NFT as well, proof of impact, I love the terminology, proof of impact, NFT. And there was another thing I didn't actually want to bring in, but maybe I just mentioned there's also a non transferable token, NTT new terminology for us. So NTT, which is essentially they also do schools, they educate people around environmental issues and how to deal with them. So they, they give you an entity as a sort of like form of certificate on an entity.
00:17:22.008 - 00:17:47.004, Speaker A: You can actually collect certain things that you don't want to transfer because no one wants to transfer a degree or a master's degree, what you do. Right. So that's similar to that. So please check out this project. It's, I think, recently launched, but it's again a very innovative way of using nfts and utilities. We have arrived to the end. Thanks for your attention.
00:17:47.004 - 00:18:21.548, Speaker A: So galaxys is a web three platform. We actually are launching three products here. We truly want to make it decentralized. So a launchpad where you can come in and design your NFT and collection mission control where you can set up the smart contracts and utilities as well and make it dynamic. And then third one is community space or short space because we do want to get away from discord. We don't like discord. So we need to have to have a safer place.
00:18:21.548 - 00:18:35.744, Speaker A: But that's it. That was my personal point of companies for interview. So thank you very much. Okay.
00:18:35.784 - 00:18:46.644, Speaker B: Thank you very much, Daniel. Does anyone have any questions from the audience? We've got a roving microphone and I'm sure we can come with some questions from the wonderful. We've got a question here in the middle.
00:18:50.744 - 00:19:07.524, Speaker A: If we run out of time. We do have a booth, by the way, as you enter on the corridor you might have seen. Please come around and chat with us about anything really just web three. And at 05:00 p.m. Today we're going to have some wine. So you definitely want to go come around for that. Sorry.
00:19:07.604 - 00:19:21.064, Speaker C: Cool. About communities. So how do we bring communities that are not into nfts already? People that don't know anything about nfts? So how do we connect the two worlds?
00:19:21.404 - 00:20:17.624, Speaker A: Well, one way that we try to tackle with these guys. So the girls, robots and dragons collection, we launched credit card payments. So you don't need anything apart from a credit or debit card and the email because we knew that the audience actually who were inspired by these guys in the decades ago don't actually have and probably don't want to get involved with getting cryptocurrencies first because I understand it's a long process of getting cryptocurrency, and then you have to. So I think technological solutions will come to help us actually get that burden out of the way. But it is. I think this is what we have to do and more and more often have to go mainstream and talk about it and educate people. I truly believe that's the only solution if you go.
00:20:17.624 - 00:20:22.244, Speaker A: Otherwise, we just have to wait for the next generation to come and overtake the ones that are skeptical.
00:20:25.124 - 00:20:26.348, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Julian.
00:20:26.476 - 00:20:27.004, Speaker A: Hi, Julian.
00:20:27.044 - 00:20:34.356, Speaker D: And you know, you're finally the right person to ask the question that is in my mind for quite some time.
00:20:34.380 - 00:20:35.984, Speaker A: I hope I can answer your question.
00:20:36.484 - 00:21:31.860, Speaker D: So I'm wondering, because some ideas on using nfts, for example, for gaming industry are in the space for years and they were never made mainstream, unfortunately. And with this all NFT bubble, I expected that we will see much more use cases around gaming industry. Like putting your digital items on blockchain as nfts and then trading them. And that provides both provenance and limit supply, as you named that. But I cannot see that happening, at least not at scale. So I wonder, what's the reason, in your opinion, why we are not, why we are seeing all those most useless applications and we do not see those very useful or very promising applications happening?
00:21:32.012 - 00:22:17.742, Speaker A: Well, I don't know the answers for that, but my personal opinion is that I think what we do at galaxies technically is quite advanced. The smart contracts, we are pushing them to the limit. And I think for now, but this is just for now, companies don't have the capabilities to actually make usable platforms. I think WordPress made it available for millions and hundreds of millions of people to create websites without actually going through the pain of hiring a developer or learning HTML. So I think it just complicated for now to introduce those innovative technologies. You're not convinced with my answer? This is my answer. There might be other answers, but please come to our booth and we can continue.
00:22:17.742 - 00:22:18.514, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:22:20.254 - 00:22:25.514, Speaker B: Okay, we still have time for more questions here. One in the middle or two in the middle.
00:22:27.934 - 00:23:01.294, Speaker E: Yeah, I wanted. It was interesting because you started out talking about how beeple proves people pay for art and they don't care about copyability. I'm not sure sure that it proves that, but there's a contrast between what you said about the monetary value of the NFTs and most of the examples you showed. Like the examples you showed, about half of them were kind of non transferable certification type things. And so where's the money coming from there, because these are going to be tradable, transferable because. No, but even the ones. But even the ones that are certificate for doing work.
00:23:01.294 - 00:23:26.264, Speaker E: Right. And the ones for the autism, a society that represents that you did good, those people aren't buying those as nfTs. They're doing good and getting a cool sticker which people love. But it doesn't align with what you said about selling art at the beginning. Those aren't similar applications. And so I'm trying to understand the connection between the beginning, which was about selling art and the end, which is examples that did.
00:23:26.304 - 00:23:50.374, Speaker A: I think it was an evolution, which I mentioned 2020 on. So there was an evolution. And now we need to, we arrive to the stage where we need to introduce utilities. And you're right, they might not be making money. It's not the whole point of actually those charities making money. It's the point of actually to get the youth involved, you know, and get maybe funding for your project. It's not always about making money and I don't think it should be.
00:23:53.634 - 00:24:03.674, Speaker B: Okay. I think there was another question over here, but maybe that question has gone away. Maybe I answered last opportunity for questions for Daniel.
00:24:06.054 - 00:24:14.294, Speaker A: Well, thanks very much. I appreciate your attention and please come to Abu. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks.
