00:00:00.120 - 00:00:14.714, Speaker A: Oh, okay. All right, so what is it? Visibility and clarity are ethereum scaling solutions driven by data and visualization.
00:00:15.574 - 00:00:17.558, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not the catchiest title, I'm assuming.
00:00:17.606 - 00:00:22.634, Speaker A: Okay, people, don't leave. No one's allowed to leave.
00:00:26.034 - 00:00:41.090, Speaker B: Okay, there we go. Hello, everyone. Good morning. And I appreciate that you all out here after, you know, maybe some czech beers last night. So. 1 second. Ah, it's going through.
00:00:41.090 - 00:00:43.334, Speaker B: Wait 1 second, we don't want that.
00:00:44.714 - 00:00:45.454, Speaker A: So.
00:00:48.634 - 00:01:15.016, Speaker B: Yeah, welcome. And I'm Tobias from Growthepie XYZ. And we're a data analytics platform. More details on that later on. And yeah, the title, understanding the importance of visibility and clarity on Ethereum scaling solutions driven by data and visualization. So what does it essentially mean? We have a lot of L2s and layer threes and other stuff coming up and I think we all bit confused. Okay.
00:01:15.016 - 00:01:57.764, Speaker B: And look what's coming up next. And why are there so many L2s? And we're trying to bring clarity into that field and that's why we built a platform for that. And of course that's why we pull data and we show different charts and we produce kind of knowledge pieces around that so that you actually understand, okay, what's going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. So a couple of words from my side. I'm a product designer by background. I've been innovation consulting trainer, motorsport lover and like to travel. So I'm kind of traveling all these conferences usually, and I'm one of the co founders of grow the pie, so doing design, business development, communications.
00:01:57.764 - 00:03:04.868, Speaker B: And so basically, like, we started last year actually with our platform and we got an Ethereum foundation grant because Ethereum said like, look, we have all these L2s and we need more data. We need more clarity, actually on exactly all these scaling solutions. So in the beginning it was a L2 analytics platform, but then it was pretty quick that, you know, everyone said, like now we're developing layer three s arbitrum orbit, for example, and others do a different approach. So we said, look, okay, let's say scaling solutions in general, and we just focus on that because there's a couple of other data platforms out there and we said, look, but mostly we probably stay in one ecosystem and we need a clear path towards this whole ecosystem and what's happening in there. Is there any idea or do you have any idea how many L2s are out there right now? So let's say 55. Any others? 200. Okay.
00:03:04.868 - 00:03:27.176, Speaker B: No. Well, we're right in between. So last time I checked on l two beat it was basically 124 and growing. So there's many unknowns out there, right. Because that's basically just what the l two beat guys, and they're doing an awesome job, are tracking, are researching. And so there's 55 active projects, according to them. There's 44 upcoming.
00:03:27.176 - 00:04:10.194, Speaker B: There's a couple that already kind of are being shut down. So goodbye to public goods network, for example, unfortunately. And we have on the right side, many layer three projects already. So that means, of course, it's not getting easier for the users. Right. That's why I want to do a bit of a time travel, actually, in this talk, do a bit of an interactive session and go back in time and actually look at some of the, the things that were happening in the past around data knowledge and also how end users have been adopted much more. So, actually, this is one of the topics of this talk.
00:04:10.194 - 00:04:47.550, Speaker B: For that, I actually want to go back to October 2022, who attended Defcon in Bogota. One, two. So basically, you see a couple of quotes out there. So one of the biggest questions almost one and a half years ago was, how do we onboard the next 1 billion people using Ethereum? That was one and a half years ago. So I'm not sure if we already have the next 1 billion people already using this ecosystem. And there's a couple of reasons for that, right. One of the talks that actually kind of got stuck in my mind was about language.
00:04:47.550 - 00:05:29.810, Speaker B: So there was a linguistic in Bogota, and he said, like, look, we're using language that normal people don't understand, right? Of course. Like, it's a very tech driven environment. But, you know, we're talking about, if you imagine, you ask your grandma right now, is trust less a good thing is, like, permission less? A good thing is, you know, everything that we're actually talking about is not very normally used in our daily language, right? So if we look at it from an end, end user point of view, we actually need to improve there. There was already a talk around that. So then we have the next thing is like wallets. You know, we all know it's pretty difficult to navigate all the different wallets. There's like hundreds out there as well.
00:05:29.810 - 00:06:24.132, Speaker B: So which one should you use? And then, of course, now we've got L2s, and now you got funds on arbitrum, and you want to use more optimism because there's a specific app running on that. What do you do then? And so that's why, in general, there's the need to improve ux around the decentralized apps. And then, of course there was this big talk around on chain data. Why do we actually need it? And people say, look, we actually have no data on the actual end users because we're not in web two anymore, we're not Facebook that can track everything and all the users. But actually now it's been improved and we actually can use data also in a very kind of privatized way, let's say. So that also helps us to make informed decisions of where we as developers, as designers, as end users should be. And basically after one and a half years now, we're pretty much in the same area still.
00:06:24.132 - 00:06:48.694, Speaker B: So how do we get out of here? How do we get out of this basement in a way. And for that we're actually going further back in time. And let's ask ourselves, what happened in the middle ages? Any ideas, like anything? What happened? Like one thing that comes to your mind straight away in the middle ages, what's that?
00:06:48.814 - 00:06:51.038, Speaker A: Printing. Printing.
00:06:51.126 - 00:07:21.466, Speaker B: Printing. Uh huh. Yeah. Getting very close. But what I wanted to get at is like the scholars that basically had the knowledge, right? Like there was monasteries and all the books were in there and there was huge walls. We all know the monasteries probably if you go around, go around Europe. And so knowledge was basically constrained in these walls, right? And also like the people outside, it didn't have the education to actually understand, okay, what they couldn't read, they couldn't read all the knowledge that has been out there already.
00:07:21.466 - 00:08:00.134, Speaker B: And in China, basically the same thing. China has been like way ahead. Back in the day, Europe just reinvented stuff that China already had, but that was also very constrained. And I think a similar thing is happening in the crypto world right now. Because I'm not saying that other developers can't read, but I'm saying that also there we don't onboard developers in the best way. So this is a report by electric capital from a couple of months ago. And you see in all of crypto, and when you actually go to the page developerreport.com,
00:08:00.134 - 00:09:03.974, Speaker B: you actually see that we only have around 7000 active developers right now, full time developers. And if you compare that to the rest of the industry or the rest of the world, basically the other industries, it's very minimal amount. And you also saw right here on the right that the amount of active developers is actually going down, which is a pretty bad sign, let's say. That's why we need to do a lot as well to onboard not just end users but also more developers in the right way and then kind of let them make informed decisions to actually go further with their apps and with their developments. And now another thing going forward from the middle ages to 2007, idea, what happened in 20 07? 20 06, 20 07. Pretty shift, actually, for like some adoption. What's that? That was a bit later, but so basically there was the iPhone coming out, right? And the iPhone kind of started all that app development and that stuff.
00:09:03.974 - 00:10:05.108, Speaker B: But still, you actually couldn't, the first iPhone, you couldn't install like third party apps, so you couldn't actually, you know, just go on an app store and kind of download something and, you know, like really kind of, I don't know, use Facebook or whatever. Apple basically constrained that in a very, very clear way. And people, or let's say hackers then said, look, no, actually this device is so powerful, we can allow the users to actually install more apps right before the actual app store came out. And that was still pretty challenging because who actually, so who was jailbreaking their iPhone here? Just hands up quickly, one, two, three, including me. So I did that as well. So there's a couple of people. But of course, you all knew that it's difficult and you have to have some technical knowledge and then you kind of downloaded some apps and your screen looked like that.
00:10:05.108 - 00:10:57.310, Speaker B: And so like Wifi address, data, IP address and storage and so on in a way that kind of looks similar to some of the decentralized apps we might have right now. Right. So what I'm saying with this is we right now, of course we have a good development and we're developing in a good way in terms of apps, but it's still very a wall around this industry, right. We're not letting other people in. Maybe in the best way on the developer side and on the end user side. And so basically, how now do we get out from this basement and discover the world and some of the things that, it's simple things that might make your project, that you're developing more accessible. So of course we need to use language and imagery that normal people really understand and value.
00:10:57.310 - 00:11:39.896, Speaker B: So there's a couple of developments. I think if you, for example, use the Clave wallet and passcode right now, that's actually pretty simple. So you don't have to deal with private keys anymore, which is a pretty good development already. Of course, we have to be careful because we still have the challenge of now you need to trust developers instead of having a centralized bank, let's say that normal people trust right now. Still, let's say in the developed world and developing world, it might look different, but now we shift the trust to the developer side. And how do we actually make sure as end users, ok, I can't trust this developer. There's actually the things happening, what they say that's happening, right.
00:11:39.896 - 00:12:23.788, Speaker B: If you think about, for example worldcoin, if you get your iris scanned, I mean, what's happening between the camera and the rest. So it's a huge challenge. And then of course you can use data to find your target audience in a place where you should operate and deploy because we saw there's 124 plus L2s and numbers growing out there. So where should you as a developer be? Just considering the ethereum ecosystem. I mean there's so many other ecosystems out there. We all know Solana is pushing a lot now to get more end user adoption driven by VC's. So it's a huge challenge, but it's a doable one.
00:12:23.788 - 00:13:35.428, Speaker B: And of course designed for a real problem, a real target audience that you can often found and not just ourselves, yourself and so on. I mean that's a pretty normal thing. And of course pay attention to ux UI to differentiate yourself and not just a funny meme picture because I mean we all like it and we know, look, we can use the latest defi app or yield farm that has a new animal in its name or an icon or whatever, or new meme coin. But of course, like thinking ahead and thinking, okay, well how do we get other users on board that really trust different imageries? Like when you think about fintech, for example, also fintech in the beginning had a pretty bad image or no one actually used them that much because going from the big banks HSBC to a fintech revolut for example, was pretty challenging. But they still had a better user experience actually. But it's also about the image around the brand, let's say, to get the normal people on board. And of course also ask yourself the questions, have a thought about the whole user experience journey.
00:13:35.428 - 00:15:11.090, Speaker B: And do I still keep walls around my own ecosystem? So who do I not yet address? And I think it's pretty important, for example, the whole user journey. Experience. User experience journey. So when you kind of imagine you develop a nice app, but you haven't thought about the whole process, you think, ok, look, I have that next fintech maybe, but how do people actually then onboard the funds without maybe a very complicated wallet without using metamask for example? Usually what I'm, what I'm seeing is that developers start later on, they say, look, we have this nice app that people can use it, but then actually forget about the steps before, about how to actually get their funds on a certain layer too, as well. So if you're deciding to deploy an arbitrum right now, but your actual target audience might be more, let's say, public goods driven, for example, they might be more on optimism, might be more on the super chain, and then, of course, it's a challenge to actually get into the arbitrum ecosystem, for example, and then of course, also make data driven decisions. So kind of really looking at the different L2s, looking at the data, looking at the usage data of the L2 s, and really deciding, okay, what can I do? Where can I position myself as a project, as a developer? Much better. That just has benefits for you as a developer.
00:15:11.090 - 00:16:04.144, Speaker B: So the likelihood that you actually fail in one ecosystem is reduced because, because you decided early on to go with a specific L2. That also kind of is actually the case for other, let's say, blockchains that might be changing to become a L2. Like Celo is the best example. They've been a layer one for a long time, and they evaluated for quite some time around the values that they want to drive with their users and which stack should they now actually join. So they thought about, of course, optimism, they thought about arbitrum, they thought about the polycorn CDK. But in the end, after kind of, I think, evaluating for like four months, five months, also from many different sites, they decided to go with the op stack. So the super chain, because it just fits much better with their sustainable image and the public goods image.
00:16:04.144 - 00:17:11.806, Speaker B: And if you have these, like the data points around, I decided on my target group because of some data, because of some charts, you have a better beta data to also convince your investors that you made these data driven decisions. And of course, you can differentiate yourself without the technical jargon. So basically, what we are trying to do with Growda PI is really that we provide some of this data as well for you. And that's why I prepared some, you know, I want to show you some metrics that really could help you as developers to really make these data driven decisions. So on the platform, just as a quick introduction, of course, you can see the, let's say the health or the growth of the overall Ethereum scaling ecosystem. But we have some fundamental metrics. We have block space usage where we label smart contracts, also with the open labels initiative that we co founded.
00:17:11.806 - 00:18:07.774, Speaker B: And by doing that, we can categorize smart contracts, we can categorize projects. And you actually see, look, what can you as a user or as a builder decide on where to build and really where to deploy a smart contract, so on where to find your actual usage. And then we have a single chain analysis because you'll see that only one metric will not help you. Like many people look at daily active addresses. But we'll see maybe in a bit that might be a skewed. Yeah, might be a skewed metric, actually, and can easily be gamed, let's say. How do certain metrics actually help you? And that's why I want to just show you a couple of brief things where that's the overall user base right now for the L2 ecosystem.
00:18:07.774 - 00:18:59.114, Speaker B: So we don't have all the L2s that l two beat has, but we have a selection like the biggest TVL. Basically there's only Metis missing right now. And basically you see around the 17 L2 s, like the growth is actually quite substantial since 2022. So since basically like Defcon and kind of we hit last week, we actually hit a, hit a milestone, but then went down quickly. Right. And one of the reasons was that when we look at arbitrum, for example, arbitrum had all of a sudden like a spike in active addresses. So you see that when you, when you kind of zoom in and then that's why the whole L2 user base, of course, all of a sudden went up, for example.
00:18:59.114 - 00:19:51.684, Speaker B: But actually going back, you see that the overall usage is quite diversified, which is a nice sign because a lot of people always think in a way that it's competition. But actually that's why that's kind of our story as well, growing the pie. That's how it started in a way that all the different L2s right now can actually kind of position themselves in a different way. I mean, Vitalik also just talked about it in his latest blog post about the different subcultures. So that's why it's actually, it's a nice thing to see that there's different L2s focusing on different things. And when you actually go then to the block space usage. So as I said, we also one thing.
00:19:51.684 - 00:21:15.954, Speaker B: So when you go to the chain overview, so there's a couple of different L2s and then you clearly see, look what's going on on these different L2. So if you, for example, talking a lot about nfts, then you will clearly see, look, Sora is actually now the chain to go, right? We all know Ethereum itself, Mainnet has been the go to chain for nfts. But now since the scaling roadmap is playing out it's actually now showing Luxora is one of the key chains to be on as an NFT artist, for example. So with your project, so you can make that informed decision, for example, of course as an end user to go and see what's happening. And of course when you like speaking about DeFi, then you can go down and see different projects that are actually running on the different chains, like in this case arbitrum. And that as a developer, if you look at this data and say, look, there's already an audience and I might want to tap into that audience, or actually there's too much competition, I might want to avoid it. Through different metrics, you can actually make these more informed decisions, especially if you're also and looking for outside capital, for example, then you have the actual data.
00:21:15.954 - 00:22:25.438, Speaker B: A nice thing about and coming to an end here soon was also the recent metric that we introduced was so called throughput because a lot of different data platforms, they said, look, we're looking at the transactions per second, but it's hard to compare with different tech behind it. It's hard to compare actually the different chains with transactions per second. And now we see there was a flat line for base, for example, and base just introduced an upgrade to the chain and now they're allowing for more throughput. So they always have to test because otherwise that chain might fail. And we know that from other chains, I think that they, that they quickly fail. And so here we see that actually now base has still a higher throughput. But for example, the, where is it? The active addresses are actually going down, which first of all, you would think doesn't make sense, right? Because like if you have a higher throughput, actually there should be more active people.
00:22:25.438 - 00:23:11.534, Speaker B: But that just is an indication there might be more complex applications now running on base, not just like simple swaps or like simple transfers. So which is, which is quite interesting. And you see clearly that when we literally look at the throughput again, so that's the actual metric, you see there's a lot of things really flat. So you see optimism is always at maximum capacity, basically. And that also means we had it in the talk before. That also decides on how much you're actually paying on a different layer too. So if you as a developer are developing, let's say an application where you need cheap fees, then you actually should look at chains that really have the ability to have a higher throughput.
00:23:11.534 - 00:23:55.342, Speaker B: And which is interestingly also linear, for example, by consensus, by metamask. So they actually have a peak throughput right now of ten megagas, which is like one of the highest right now that we have out there. And they, as you see, they're actually not at all at capacity at the moment, but base is actually already again reaching capacity. But they are on the way of like upgrading the chain along the way to one giga gas. So we have mega right now and they actually want to reach one giga gas. So that's just one example. And then of course, that all affects the fees, which you as a developer can also compare maybe as a last note, this heat map, for example, might also be interesting to you.
00:23:55.342 - 00:24:45.494, Speaker B: We already always saw like an outlier with optimism. And when you look at the heat map, like, when is it expensive to kind of do something on different chains? It's actually interesting because most of the time during asian trading hours, for example, optimism is very expensive because there's a lot of perpetual apps being used on optimism during these times. So that's when you as a developer or as an end user also know, look, I should actually avoid optimism around that time because I unnecessarily pay more gas than needed. Right. So, yeah, I think that was a brief intro in different metrics that you could look at and I hope that makes sense to you and. Yeah, thank you. You can follow us.
00:24:45.494 - 00:24:46.866, Speaker B: That's it.
00:24:46.930 - 00:24:53.138, Speaker A: Thank you so much. I realized we met at linear booth takeover.
00:24:53.226 - 00:24:54.930, Speaker B: Yeah. In Denver.
00:24:55.042 - 00:25:01.934, Speaker A: In Denver. I'm a huge fan of grow the pie, by the way. I think. Yeah. Anyway, huge fan question. I wanted to start.
00:25:02.514 - 00:25:19.084, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wanted to know whether you think, I like the thing about how you said it's distributed the weekly, like the transactions and other things. But I was wondering if in the future you think the power law will kick in even for l two s, or will it continue to be distributed going ahead.
00:25:19.124 - 00:26:24.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for sure, I think, like, there's not going to be like endless amount of different L2s. I think we're going to see individual stacks. I think that's what we already, because that's why we're looking at already having a new metric that says, look, the actual stack accumulated. So when we then look at Arbitrum, when we look at optimism, when we look at Polygon and so on, and Cksync, obviously. And I think there, it's going to be interesting, of course, how the distribution is going to be, but there's going to be a lot of purpose built L2, which is also like a challenge for us because right now we have 17 and of course we don't want to swamp the platform with 100 different L2s, which is then very complicated. Obviously, of course we're kind of doing that in the end, but it's probably going to be more app specific chains, which also makes sense for different use cases, let's say. But of course I think it's going to be individual stacks that are just, you know, providing the tech.
00:26:24.394 - 00:26:31.134, Speaker B: And like the super chain, when you then upgrade, then every other layer too, basically gets this upgrade as well.
00:26:33.594 - 00:26:35.014, Speaker A: There was a question here.
00:26:39.114 - 00:26:57.104, Speaker D: Thanks for the talk. Also a big fan of your site. When it comes to the category comparison. I see that base has actually the most, the highest percentage of unlabeled contracts. Is that related to the fact that also the unique users are going down? There's more unique contracts that aren't labeled yet or.
00:26:57.184 - 00:27:02.904, Speaker B: No, actually not. It's actually a sign that the ecosystem is healthy because we are too slow to actually label.
00:27:02.944 - 00:27:05.120, Speaker D: Okay. All right. Yeah, it seems like a good thing.
00:27:05.272 - 00:27:31.680, Speaker B: That's the actual reason. And that's why we actually also founded the open Labels Initiative. Because our long term goal was to not label or do the labeling ourselves, but to kind of outsource that the community and kind of have basically it could open up a retroactive funding for them as well. So if individual users can then kind of label more in a trusted and verified way, so that we always kind of get down to almost, let's say 0% unlabeled. Exactly.
00:27:31.792 - 00:27:39.264, Speaker D: Okay, cool. And then one more question about the categories. Blast. I don't see a breakdown of their categories. Am I missing something?
00:27:39.344 - 00:27:49.440, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, because like for some chains we don't have that yet. Because quite for some ecosystem it's more complicated to actually get the block space data. But yeah, that will come over time.
00:27:49.512 - 00:27:50.592, Speaker D: Okay, thank you very much.
00:27:50.648 - 00:27:51.924, Speaker B: Cheers. Thanks.
00:27:52.384 - 00:28:10.920, Speaker A: All right, one last question. I actually have one. I used to lead business development at Mamma mask for end users. They actually don't look at chains, they only look at dapps. Do you guys have planned to obfuscate the chains and just highlight more of the Dapps? I know you already do a little bit, yeah.
00:28:10.952 - 00:28:33.088, Speaker B: So basically we already also got an optimism grant to say we look more at the applications because we're totally public goods, funded, by the way. So that's why it's free for everyone always to use. And so we're going to have a more application view. So where the L2s are a bit kind of hidden behind the applications because that's what we need as well, to kind of make it easier to understand. Right?
00:28:33.176 - 00:28:41.864, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. And also, I'm launching L2 as well, so to make your life harder. Anyway, thank you, guys. Our next speaker rescheduled, so we have 30 minutes break.
