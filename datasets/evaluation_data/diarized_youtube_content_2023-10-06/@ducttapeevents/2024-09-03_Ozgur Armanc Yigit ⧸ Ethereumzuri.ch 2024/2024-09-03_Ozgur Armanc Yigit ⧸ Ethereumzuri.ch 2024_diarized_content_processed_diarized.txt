00:00:06.440 - 00:01:00.200, Speaker A: As a person who works for Ethereum foundation it's good to connect with people and talk with them, share our ideas, projects and learn about their projects and ideas to maybe have some kind of collaboration in the future or help them. It's my main purpose to teach people. So that's why as a HRM foundation PAc member I was here. Yeah. So I talk about a little bit about zero knowledge proofs, how they work actually what's the critical things, fundamental things for zero knowledge proofs. Then I talked about epic course more deeply to teach people how they can become a maybe zero knowledge developer or where they should start to be a developer in this field. Yeah it was my first time in Europe and I think I started from a high space.
00:01:00.200 - 00:01:11.940, Speaker A: Zuri is, I bet it's the best place in Europe and yeah we will see. I will be in I think Amsterdam and Greece next week so I will compare it.
