00:00:09.920 - 00:00:20.278, Speaker A: Okay. Very well. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much. Take your seats. Thank you so much for coming to my talk being very, very last. Not very, very last, actually.
00:00:20.278 - 00:00:37.764, Speaker A: There is the closing speech, but there is this culture in it, Prague. They always put my talks before the closing speech on Sunday. So everybody's already tired and I have an easy job. Yeah. Thank you so much for that. I hope you still. I'm trying to salvage the rest of my energy to talk about this, and I actually have quite an easy job.
00:00:37.764 - 00:01:08.900, Speaker A: Maybe if you've been here last year, you might think, oh, Mario, you talked about this already. Well, yes, I did. And I'm talking about pretty much the same thing as the year before and at other events as well, because I want you guys to. Can you see it? Become core devs. Come to join us in the wonderful land of technical problems of the core Ethereum platform. Yeah, so what I want to talk to you about this program that we run. So again, I'm Mario from protocol support, Ethereum foundation.
00:01:08.900 - 00:01:44.294, Speaker A: We run a protocol fellowship, a program which helps you to become a core dev. If you're interested in this, if you have certain computer science background and you would like to learn more about specific domains of Ethereum. So when I talk about Ethereum and Ethereum core, I like to ask this question. At. At my talks, I asked, I believe that I ask the same thing at eat proc every year, and I always get different answers. So I wonder, what is it this year? Somebody shout your opinions. What is Ethereum? In one word? Money.
00:01:44.294 - 00:02:04.044, Speaker A: Yeah. Ethereum is love. Ethereum is future. It's centralized. I like that. Okay, how would you describe Ethereum? I hear about world computers, about platforms. How would you describe Ethereum? What is it? One more community.
00:02:04.044 - 00:02:22.240, Speaker A: That's lovely. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, ethereum is. Ethereum is. Can be many things. I believe that it's this elephant that everybody sees, just their part, what they are interested in. Oh, the gods really don't like Ethereum this weekend, isn't it? Here, the thunder.
00:02:22.240 - 00:02:35.102, Speaker A: Oh, that's so crazy. I love it. Anyway, yeah, Ethereum. Yeah, it gives some buzz. Oh, sorry. It's a bit distracting. What is Ethereum in core? In its core.
00:02:35.102 - 00:03:05.444, Speaker A: In its absolute definition, Ethereum is the protocol. That's why we talk about the protocol fellowship. Can you guys hear me? I feel like it's just. Is it just me? Yeah. Good, good. I bought a protocol fellowship because Ethereum is a protocol. It's a technical specification, an implementation of a protocol which behaves in a certain way, and core developers are people who are working on this core protocol, making it happen, maintaining it and upgrading it.
00:03:05.444 - 00:04:17.748, Speaker A: Ethereum has been here for, well, more engineers in some form, first as a white paper, then a yellow paper which actually specifies what Ethereum is today in its python version, in the execution and consensus specs, and then like twelve different implementations of Ethereum core protocol. So it's a lot of software tooling, testing around and research, which actually maps out how all of this protocol should evolve. So the core protocol being. Yeah, the work of the core devs being the maintenance of this core infrastructure of Ethereum, which is the underlying layer of everything that we talk about here today. All the ETH, Prague and all the communities and all the apps and all the use cases need to run on a smooth and hopefully secure and hopefully decentralized enough platform. So we try to improve it. There is around, I would say 200, 172 in protocol guild, but more than 200 of core developers, which, if you really think about it, is still quite a small community, considering it's like 20 different teams.
00:04:17.748 - 00:05:25.016, Speaker A: And this is all the people who have some insight into how all of these various parts of the protocol works. And there are many, many hackers here, many great developers. I have this speech at the end, because if you are a hacker, you already submitted your FiNC, you are just waiting for results. You finally have time to relax. So I hope that you had a chance to actually come here and get inspired to do some other kind of hacking on this core layer, and joined us around 200 people who are working on what I mentioned, specification, the execution, consensus, testing and research. So the core of Ethereum, which is not defi or NFTs, or L2s, or even languages like soldity, things built on top of the ethereum, but the actual low level development of the platform itself, the client software, which is in maybe ten different languages, five, six different languages, there are client implementations in anything. So people coming from different backgrounds.
00:05:25.016 - 00:06:31.002, Speaker A: If you are skilled in c, in go, in Java, in typescript, in rust, you can find some library, something to contribute to. There's always an infinite amount of work to do on the core layer, and I'm going to, I don't have to add much time, because it's already late. So I'm going to skip quickly to the last point that one of the most exciting things we are working on, of course, is, oh fuck, wrong button is working on the roadmap, right? So it's not just the maintenance and improving the infrastructure, but prototyping, mapping and implementing the future, making the future happen after the merge. Vitalik said that Ethereum is about 55% finished now. It's maybe 60. We had some hard work since then, but there are still many interesting things to do in the different urges of Ethereum. All of this work is being done through extensive research and then prototyping, and then testing and then implementations and optimizing.
00:06:31.002 - 00:07:11.414, Speaker A: So it's a process which never really ends. It's like an infant garden that we always have to take care of. And just imagine that we do it. Imagine that we have this beautiful ethereum done. Not e two anymore, right? So all the hackers here, I want to speak specifically to you, building on many interesting use cases here, applications which can be. So your skills, that your contributions can be very impactful on actual layer one of ethereum. So how do we help? What I'm actually pitching here is protocol fellowship.
00:07:11.414 - 00:07:42.800, Speaker A: But first I want to quickly talk about the study group. Study group is a short program that we started to gather knowledge to prepare you for the actual fellowship and to give general public and anyone interested more are, they really don't like me here? Oh my God. Oh, okay. We should study group. Yeah, study group. It was a ten week program and we created 16 sessions. So basically.
00:07:42.800 - 00:08:16.562, Speaker A: So the output of this thing is that you can go to this beautiful website, EPF wiki. The study group homepage is EPF wiki, where you can find the protocol study group. That's 16 presentations that we created. You can follow it, it's already done. You cannot watch it live. But all the recordings, all the discussion, all the materials and exercises that come with it are there in the first part, which is the presentations in the study group. During this study group, we also ran community, or there is still a community maintaining the protocol wiki.
00:08:16.562 - 00:09:03.424, Speaker A: The second part of this website is protocol wiki, which is a collection of community written resources on the protocol. So not just a presentation from some core dev. We have those presentations covering many parts of the protocol, but you can never contain all of the information in some talk. So all of these other materials, explanations, even of very advanced, cutting edge research of Ethereum are in the protocol wiki here. So it is a great place to study, to generally learn about Ethereum core protocol. And yeah, these are some research topics that we covered, all the introduction and execution, consensus, how it actually works now and how it can work in the future. But this is something which can help you prepare for the protocol fellowship.
00:09:03.424 - 00:09:38.156, Speaker A: So for the people who are actually somewhat skilled in development in understand, or want to understand Ethereum more specifically, we run the fellowship itself. And our ultimate goal is to just make it easier for you to contribute to these clients, because all Ethereum is open. It's out there. It's sitting there waiting for you to come and help out to make it better. We love to complain about Ethereum, about these issues or those, so we can actually join the discussion, the research and the work on making it happen. Very brief history. We've been running four cohorts before.
00:09:38.156 - 00:10:29.712, Speaker A: The first two were started by legendary Piper Mariame, and we took over for the third and the fourth and now upcoming fifth cohort. And yeah, it's organized by EF. You can find all the information here. I will have some QR codes, though. How it works is that we have five month program running from June to November this year where people are supposed to be. It's supposed to mimic the experience with a core developer where you are self directed, you are learning by yourself, you come there and you get inspiration from some projects that we suggest, and you can jump on the learning path using our wiki or other resources to purpose some of your project and work on it for the next four or five months. It's all coordinated on GitHub and Discord.
00:10:29.712 - 00:11:10.984, Speaker A: It's fully open, it's fully permissionless. This is open to anyone who is interested in Ethereum. And you don't need to apply anywhere, you don't need to pay anything. However. Yeah, what comes with this experience is that you actually are able to penetrate this community to meet some of the people working on the core, Ethereum, and especially your peers, people learning with you in some semi structured process where we have some systems on how the things are done. We have weekly or bi weekly updates. We run AMA sessions with mentors, with the current core developers.
00:11:10.984 - 00:12:22.444, Speaker A: And so for those who actually apply, we also offer financial stipend. So the last cohort we had 400 people applying, and around 40 people actually started and delivered 32 project, 32 projects with so many mas. And we concluded this at Devconnect. These are some projects from the previous cohort. So to give you an idea what people work on core stuff, right? We have somebody doing one, at least one of these projects in the room here, I believe, and examples of APIs in the clients, some improving the backend databases in some client implementations, but also something outside like deterministic builds for Ethereum clients on Debian. Here, the node crawler, which is the peer to peer implementation monitoring the network. So anything that really benefits the core protocol, you can find all of this information more in this blog on bloggerium.org
00:12:22.444 - 00:13:17.956, Speaker A: dot, you can find information about the previous cohort which concluded last year. That is like the most up to date example of how it runs. But how does it work now? How can you join? Yeah, first it's a learning path about diving deep into some domain of the protocol. You don't need to understand details of every little piece of both execution, consensus. Just pick your niche. You pick an interesting problem that you want to solve, that you want to contribute to, and you dive into that, you work on that, you propose a project and that's like the first four or five weeks and the rest is literally just the execution, just working on these. And by working with the mentors, it means you directly contribute to their projects and they are basically your colleagues already.
00:13:17.956 - 00:14:03.740, Speaker A: You just start working with them because you contribute to their repositories. Yeah. So how do you join? Some tips on what to be able to do. Generally you don't have to be senior, you don't have to have any extended skills in anything. There's, it's just up to you how much time you're able to dedicate to learn to work on something. But you need to have certain, certain skills, certain mindset of being able to actually do this yourself, be self directed, self motivated and have some technical background at least, you know, some low level language or some computer science experience. And yeah, be able to write code at least a little bit.
00:14:03.740 - 00:15:06.264, Speaker A: There's, for example, some prototypes or analysis which are more about the research and the legwork and the data analysis than doing the actual software architecture. But you still need some of these technical skills. So at least something. Yeah. We have the applications for people who need to receive the stipend, who want to receive a stipend to be able to work on this full time or dedicate the time for it. We are able to provide a stipend and for these we seek people who have some proof of work, some actual experience in open source or in free software in Ethereum and just generally show the insight into protocol they know what is the real motivation, interesting domain they want to work on. So check out if you're interested, if you ever thought about, you know, looking deeper into the protocol or maybe even becoming a core developer, check out the EPF wiki.
00:15:06.264 - 00:15:27.192, Speaker A: Check out the applications. Yeah, it's running. It's running since June to November. We will be meeting at ECC, we'll be meeting in Defcon. So if you in Bangkok. So if you are coming there, you can meet us. And for again, the successful candidates will be giving stipend for Charles as well.
00:15:27.192 - 00:15:50.188, Speaker A: So the applications closed one week ago. That's one thing here. Applications closed. However, you are at Eat Prague and I'm the dude organizing this thing. So I just opened them again for you. Or better said, I made a special link just for. Just for you guys to submit as an extra last minute.
00:15:50.188 - 00:16:02.412, Speaker A: So even if you missed the deadline, the opportunity to submit it in the original date, you can still do that. This is a one QR code. If it doesn't work, just catch me somewhere. I will give you the link. I will give you the QR code. I'm still here. I'm the after party.
00:16:02.412 - 00:16:26.056, Speaker A: So just let me know if you're interested in joining and you need. Especially if you need this type and then you feel that. Okay, I'm able to dedicate my time into it. I have some skills to be able to work on this. Then please just catch me anytime here, I will get you the link and you can apply there. We will invite you for an interview in coming week or so and for some rest of the links or things to check out. I already mentioned the EPF wiki.
00:16:26.056 - 00:16:47.786, Speaker A: It's easy. One, you don't need a QR code for that. It's eight letters there. But you can join the Google group, which is a mailing list. Yeah, it's actually just a mailing list where you receive updates about new cohorts, about some content that we create. Check out the GitHub of the protocol fellows you can find. So all this work is open.
00:16:47.786 - 00:17:14.043, Speaker A: It's in the repositories where you can see every piece of work that has been done by every fellow in every previous cohort. So a lot of materials to study, a lot of inspiration you can get. So you can find it on GitHub. You can join our mailing list and you can join the discord of the study group. It's a community which is adjacent to the fellow you can discuss with the community there. And I think I'm over time, so I gotta cut it here. But thank you so much.
00:17:14.043 - 00:17:34.640, Speaker A: Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions. And yeah, I will be here. So just, yeah, feel free to jump at me and ask me questions. Yeah. Thank you everyone. And thanks for coming to eat Prague. It was a great event, right? And I love the energy, so keep it up.
00:17:34.640 - 00:17:36.284, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Thank you.
00:17:39.344 - 00:18:02.394, Speaker B: Mario Havel. Okay, guys, we have few minutes to our closing ceremony. So thank you, Mario, for having amazing speech as the last speaker before the closing ceremony. So guys, let's give it five minutes to actually get everything ready and survive the storm. Hopefully so. See you in five minutes.
