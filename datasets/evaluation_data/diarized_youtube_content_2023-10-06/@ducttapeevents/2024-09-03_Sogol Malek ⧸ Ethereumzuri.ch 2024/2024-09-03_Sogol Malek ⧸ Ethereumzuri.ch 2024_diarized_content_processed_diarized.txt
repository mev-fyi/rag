00:00:06.360 - 00:01:03.470, Speaker A: I am so go Malek, our fellow developer at Ethereum foundation, and I'm working on sort of a core development on stateless Ethereum, and I'm very much excited just to walk people through my previous engagement with the implementations I did. And yeah, I'm very glad that I just had this opportunity just to share more progress and updates on my work with the community and that value. Yeah, that's one of the most interesting events I've been previously in the past few months, and I really appreciate this vibe and everything, the lineup of best speakers. So it's all about networking with people and learning more from other type of activities happening and just keeping yourself updated with other type of involvements in the ecosystem. And I think one of the main interesting part of being the at this event is like engaging with other developers and also being updated with subjects.
