00:00:06.600 - 00:00:42.360, Speaker A: Honestly, just seeing the teamwork in our group coming together for this event, everybody who had to do something delivered. I was very grateful for that. Seeing the other organizers work, coming here, doing things, all this coordination was a lot of fun for me. So from an organizing perspective. But then, in the end, I think all the connections we made here, I met a lot of cool people. I get to know a lot of new ideas, so it was really beneficial for me and, like, for getting to know the space and deepen my knowledge of it.
