00:00:23.400 - 00:00:48.130, Speaker A: Eat. Prague is a lot of fun. We have like ton of people coming from, you know, all across Europe. We have like 600 people around me, I think. And yeah, when we were starting duct tape like six months ago, this was like one of those things that we wanted to make sure it happens in Prague. Now it's finally happening and this won't be the last for sure. It might be the first e Prague, but we are stoked about organizing more events such as this one and going even further.
00:00:48.130 - 00:01:01.148, Speaker A: This is just the beginning. We learned a lot. We met a lot of cool projects and it was one of the best conferences I've been to and it was a pleasure to be here.
00:01:01.276 - 00:01:20.860, Speaker B: I came here to check the Yves Prague out for the first time. It's an amazing event. I love the visual stuff, how organizers played with the venue. It's just amazing. And the content's great. So I can't wait to see the next year. The service is top notch, I have to say.
00:01:20.860 - 00:01:27.444, Speaker B: I mean, I'm a big conference goer, but this service was amazing. Don't.
