00:00:24.080 - 00:00:48.554, Speaker A: What? Can you hear me? All right? Formatting problem? It's fine. So my name is Matteo. I prepared the talk and I did some research. I will tell you how and the objective of this talk, but it's called defy the police. Who am I? I'm a musician. I love doing music. I think there is so much to learn from doing music and from practicing music.
00:00:48.554 - 00:01:30.224, Speaker A: I worked as a web free educator for a program called Ethereum, for ran to together with the remix team. My background is in political linguistics and what is so called language engineering. And I am a member of the Aikikai foundation in Tokyo. So everything started from this picture and from this claim. And it's not just a claim, it's actually a movement that led to corrective measures in police districts, I think in Louisville and Baltimore. So they tried to defend the police with very bad results. But also I use this claim as a sort of word game for my own talk.
00:01:30.224 - 00:02:04.652, Speaker A: So I have some objectives. The first of all is to start a conversation on what I call centralized management of violence, which is different from the monopoly of violence. I don't want to name it monopoly of violence because I don't think that violence is a marketable item. So I would love to stick to management of violence or centralized management of violence. We will explore the field and trace some use case candidates for decentralized technology. And maybe at the end we'll present some verticals. I have a few disclaimers to do.
00:02:04.652 - 00:02:51.312, Speaker A: First of all, I am not in no derogatory position. I do believe that we need a certain level of management of violence. There are abusive people in the world and we need to find a way to coexist with them. Management of violence is a vast field. It changes by country, it changes by number and diversity of the forces deployed on the territory and also local issues. The rule of engagement for public administration in Honduras is different than the rules of engagement in Spain. And also I base this research on interviews, direct interviews to the military personnel and other professionals working for NATO and the police in police institution in Italy.
00:02:51.312 - 00:03:17.062, Speaker A: But these interviews are covered by what they made me abide to as the Chatham house rule. So confidentiality. Other disclaimers I will try to put all together. Sorry for that. Police and army as a whole, and I will call them security forces. There is actually a basis for that. And there is a process of merging between police and army.
00:03:17.062 - 00:03:39.278, Speaker A: We have some examples. The program strada sicure in Italy, which means safe streets, the operation temporary in the UK, Operation Sentinel in France, and everything that basically followed 911. So we saw more cops, more military personnel with cops patrolling the streets. Definitely after 911, Bata clan.
00:03:39.326 - 00:03:39.622, Speaker B: Nice.
00:03:39.678 - 00:04:21.174, Speaker A: And all these other attempts also we saw during Capitol Hill, military personnel directing the police in managing the situation there. And of course we are going to have even more civil unrest scenarios. And usually police and military work together to fight drug cartels and mafia mobs. This process basically results in the police and the army more reciprocally permeable. That means changes in one body will change in time the other. There's a video that I wanted to show you. I don't know if it starts.
00:04:21.174 - 00:05:18.394, Speaker A: It doesn't start. So basically it was a military drill in Riga that happened eight months ago. So out of nowhere, the military started doing safe shelling in the streets with the citizens and terrifying basically everyone. Of course, there were already rumors about the Ukraine invasion, so they were getting ready. But this is how we are, what are we moving towards to? And this is a very important sentence from Norberto Bobbio is an Italian. He was an italian political philosopher of our times are democratic countries mature when armed forces are perfectly integrated in the civil society. So security forces, security forces are alike secular institutions, meaning that statistically is very often that you start being a cop or a military officer and you end up being that.
00:05:18.394 - 00:05:59.624, Speaker A: There is very little turnover in professions down there. They do obey the constitution, that's what they say. But also they like to specify that they do obey constitutionally elected representatives. So it's a different. It's something different because representatives are not secular. They have a turnover based on elections, and also they keep citizens safe from what they call the social alert. Social alert is something that is determined at political level, and they are funded by taxation.
00:05:59.624 - 00:07:20.750, Speaker A: But most of the time, according to them, the financial operations are way too connected to the hierarchical system that determines the command system in security forces. So security forces, we do need them for fighting organized crime, for national and public security, and anti terrorism programs, for street order and managing traffic to coordinators in case of catastrophic events, and to make sure that infrastructures run. And maybe we don't need them so much to declare state of war against our will as citizens. To use suppressive rules of this is not a return of investment, this is rules of engagement in military jargon, to use suppressive rules of engagement in demonstrations. And we don't need them to execute orders against the freedom of speech and press, the freedom of movement or assembly, and identity rights, such as gender or sanitary condition. Also, we don't need them to seize infrastructures like sometimes it happens in Ethiopia when they run elections, they shut down the Internet like that. Security forces need secrecy for investigations to.
00:07:20.750 - 00:07:46.788, Speaker A: When they define targets, they need secrecy during operation, meaning communications on the field. Yes, of course. Double myself here, sorry. And they do need transparency for the chain of command. They do need transparency for accountability of actions. Order formulation has a specific linguistic rule that is called CB's. Clear, brief and sincere.
00:07:46.788 - 00:08:26.530, Speaker A: And every order has to abide to this standard. And of course, budgeting and spending. So there are some bugs in the management of violence, according to my sources. First of all, there's a centrally determined resource allocation, which sometimes is not efficient. Like in Italy, you have the switch of the equipment seasonally. So say, in October, every cop in Italy has to change their vestiary and boots, etcetera. And in October you might have 30 degrees in Palermo or five degrees in Trento.
00:08:26.530 - 00:09:10.144, Speaker A: So it's not very efficient in terms of resource allocation. And of course, you end up creating doubles because they fill the. The magazine, magazines, sorry, the stocks with unused material. There are doped contracts. If you look at the contractors for pre war, during war and afterwards, usually these contracts are very, very high, even for logistical items like toilets, stuff like that. Sometimes the quality of supplies is really poor. There are conflicts of interest in who orders what contracts to whom, to which company.
00:09:10.144 - 00:09:52.314, Speaker A: And there are also problems of accounting, or what is called asset forfeiture, meaning when I bust a drug, someone with a small amount of even recreational drugs, and maybe this person has some cash, I meet a cop, I am allowed to take this cash, but it resulted in many cases of this cash not being accounted properly. So maybe I keep 500 and I leave 500 and I register 500 at the police district. That actually happened. It happened at Luis Metro Police department in the US. It was a big scandal. And it also happened in Italy, in Piacenz. So there was a proper racket run by the local police.
00:09:52.314 - 00:10:44.156, Speaker A: Of course, centralized communications can be hacked and manipulated. There's a long bureaucracy around passports, way too long. And something interesting that they pinged me on was that there are KPI's that are, as I said before, that are distilled from the government. And the government decides what the. What the Times social alert is about. And the formulate KPI's that police districts have to reach in order to get bonuses. So unfortunately, most of these KPI's are like number of arrests and just stopping people if they don't have masks or if they don't have the green pass, stuff like that, et cetera.
00:10:44.156 - 00:11:36.354, Speaker A: So I wouldn't go into the details, but it's basically all these KPI's respond to responsive quality of crime management and not preemptive. And this is what most cops that I interviewed are lamenting about. There is not enough incentives for them to work on preemptive programs. There are also some gimmicks in the management of violence. First of all, orders must be executed unless they clearly constitute a crime. So every officer is free and is allowed to ask for a formal request when they are given an order and, you know, kind of question the authority. Of course, this doesn't happen very often because the bureaucracy is long, and also because by doing so, you would blacklist yourself in the bureau, in the district, as an officer.
00:11:36.354 - 00:12:30.120, Speaker A: The source of legitimacy can change if an officer gets, usually an officer that has to respect hierarchy, but if they are in chief of a special premise, they can outrule the command if they are in charge of that. Also, the rules of engagement at street level very often is decided at local public administration level. It doesn't come from the government. The government only decide the norms. And then that norms is articulated with the mayor and with all the forces involved in the city's securities management. There are also more measurables than before. Traditionally, for the military, the difficulty level of an objective is calculated in number of deaths per mile.
00:12:30.120 - 00:13:13.546, Speaker A: But now we also have the media backslash, especially since the Desert storm operation. And also, as I said, the Desert Storm operation started what we call the embedded journalism into military forces. And especially NATO started a program in 2016 to get the military more social. I don't know if you noticed that there are more YouTube channels from police districts, there are memes and stories from troopers training, things like that. So that's not something to just happening. They are being led free to do that. So it's kind of derogatory.
00:13:13.546 - 00:13:53.718, Speaker A: They said, you can do it, you can post stuff. We allow that. So there are some blockchain and security forces intersections. Of course there are. And solutions that are being explored are, of course, audit spending for military and police expenditures, supply tracking for components. There's a decentralized database for passport project by the Dubai police app with Hyperledger. The Department of State, the Department of Defense of United States are working on a secure messaging system on Hyperledger.
00:13:53.718 - 00:14:47.444, Speaker A: That, of course, is about forward and backward. Secrecy in communications, self deleting live messages, one time eyes only messages, resilience against cyber attacks during communication. And also, this 2016 innovation challenge by NATO is aiming to get the military more social in their operations. And of course, they are exploring blockchain solutions for procurement, finance, and Internet of things. So there are. I have a few, I have researched a few proposals thanks to Mario Havel for pinging me with this one that I didn't know about. It's a czech project that was written maybe seven years ago by Kicks Neil and Spector, and it's basically sort of Dapp for neighborhood security.
00:14:47.444 - 00:16:01.742, Speaker A: This dapp basically creates a peer to peer relationship between customers, meaning citizens and patrolling guards in a given neighborhood. And basically, the citizens can stake their own, create their own id by burning some, creating a proof, proof of burn of cryptocurrency. They place something that is called a random coin fountain outside their house that randomly gives tokens whenever checked with a badge or something. Of course, the more the checks, the higher the odds to get the coin out of the fountain. The reputation system is one to one. So every citizens, every householder gives a reputation point to the guard only for what concerns his own property. So if the reputation goes down, then the RCF will less likely give tokens to that guard.
00:16:01.742 - 00:16:48.654, Speaker A: So the guard is disincentivized to come and check. There's also a call for help feature where a citizen is in danger or inside a householder is in danger inside his her own house. They can trigger this feature where basically the RCF odds augment. So guards are more inclined to come and check. In my opinion, there's a problem, which is the lucrative aspect inside of it. Of course, rcfs who give more reputation and tend to be more checked while the others will not. So you create basically gated communities of people who can guarantee running lotteries and who don't.
00:16:48.654 - 00:17:52.988, Speaker A: I spent some time trying to figure out my own way to deal with it. It's just an initial conversation, and we can move it forward if you're interested. But I found out that we can work on that KPI definition. As citizens, we are allowed to create these KPI's. So my idea is to, in a Solarpunk future, of course, is to have sbts tokens which are authenticated by the public administrations and are given to citizens for redeem, maybe against an advance of what is called tis, which is basically local taxes of indivisible service, like the public lights, the streets, cleaning security. In Italy, they're called indivisible services. So citizens could advance some of their tax and redeem their SBT.
00:17:52.988 - 00:18:17.554, Speaker A: The revenues of these would go in a matching pool. Citizens can group in delegations. There are already delegations. There are already real world delegations. Those are NGO's that work on the territory on crime prevention programs. It's spread everywhere, in every city. And as delegation, they can propose KPI strategies to prevent local crime issues.
00:18:17.554 - 00:19:10.478, Speaker A: Other citizens with the SBTs can use their SBTs to vouch, and maybe we can find a way. What that vouch means, maybe it can be transferable, but we can find a way, a solidity way to vouch for staff. They can vouch for a strategy. And basically, police stations can allocate officers ids to these strategies. What happens is that delegations provide a rating on officers following their programs during the week, how often they follow it, with what results, if they are learning or not, if they are cooperating with the neighborhood. And based on these ratings, there can. Basically, the funds from the matching pool can be diverted into different districts.
00:19:10.478 - 00:19:45.544, Speaker A: So, of course, this is a very, very drafty way to put it, but I would love to. There's a telegram group that I created for anyone who wants to bring on the conversation. We might also create a workshop soon. I have a small community of people in NATO that might be interested to learn about decentralized incentives. That was enough for me. I'm free to give these slides. There are also some references just to check the facts.
00:19:45.544 - 00:19:49.704, Speaker A: I don't know if there's time for questions, but thank you very much.
00:19:58.194 - 00:19:59.898, Speaker C: You're not staying around for questions?
00:20:00.026 - 00:20:01.506, Speaker A: I can stay around for one question.
00:20:01.570 - 00:20:03.970, Speaker C: Yeah, one question. Okay, you want one question?
00:20:04.042 - 00:20:04.506, Speaker A: Yes.
00:20:04.610 - 00:20:11.654, Speaker C: Only one. Anyone with a question from the audience? We've got a roving microphone, gnosis, safe t shirt.
00:20:13.034 - 00:20:14.474, Speaker B: Thanks for the presentation.
00:20:14.594 - 00:20:17.054, Speaker C: My question was, microphone needs to be active.
00:20:18.234 - 00:20:45.964, Speaker B: Hello. Testing. Yeah, so, my question was regarding the private mercenary movements and security firms that are coming in the space. G four S. Wagner and others. How do you think that the KPI model that you have proposed will be trying to combat these kind of groups which are also facing issues of corruption and other issues?
00:20:47.344 - 00:21:13.274, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. And I think that the problem there is a bit bigger, because they do not. They do not abide to constitutional standards. So with the police, you can do this as a citizen, you have the right to propose these KPI's, because ultimately, they do abide to constitutionally elected representatives. And if the representatives fail, they stick to the constitution. Mercenaries do not. So I think.
00:21:13.274 - 00:21:37.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't have an answer right now. That's very centralized. I think it's an awful thing to have mercenaries right now. And again, this is why I don't want to call it monopoly of violence, because violence becomes a commodity that you can sell. So I would love to stick to the term management of violence that maybe we can build upon. Sorry if I don't have an answer.
00:21:38.564 - 00:21:45.904, Speaker C: Okay, I now realize there wasn't any time for questions, so thank you very much, Matteo. We're now going to switch to a live.
