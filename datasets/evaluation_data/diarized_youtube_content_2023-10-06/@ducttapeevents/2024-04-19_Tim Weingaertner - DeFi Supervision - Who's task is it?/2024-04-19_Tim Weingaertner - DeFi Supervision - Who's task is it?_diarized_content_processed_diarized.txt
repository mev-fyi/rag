00:00:00.200 - 00:01:14.814, Speaker A: From my side we are a small group and perhaps to myself I'm a professor at the Lutheran University of Applied Science so I know these settings where everybody is sitting in the back and nobody in the front. But since it's interactive I invite you to come in front if you like because I prepared some work we can to do because yeah, it's a workshop and it's a workshop on Defi supervision and the question about whose task is it? So it's not that I tell you who should be responsible for deepfi supervision. I will introduce you in the topic but I also want to discuss this with you because it's in more or less open topic. But to start off I would like to invite and just give me this started here invite you to. I have some polls on mentimeta. I hope this works with the link. Just scan the code.
00:01:14.814 - 00:02:07.560, Speaker A: We have multiple checks over the lecture. Give you some minutes just also to get to know you what is your background and why you're attending this session. So polls are coming in, looks great and I do it the classical way to present this should work. No? Is there a way we can. Too many ways to. Well yeah, I can read it. Let's do it like this.
00:02:07.560 - 00:02:51.150, Speaker A: I thought we can just put it. Okay, so we got six defi enthusiasts and one fintech innovator. So that's pretty cool because we don't have any newbies, unfortunately we don't have any regulatory experts. Okay, so I'll have to take this job down. So thanks for this short overview. So the goal of this session is a little bit. I want to introduce you into Defi and the unique landscape and risks.
00:02:51.150 - 00:04:14.904, Speaker A: We have some supervisional, other supervision challenges and also looking into supervision of the decentralized world and then together work on some exercises. So I keep this short because most of you know the topic of decentralized finance, but still. And I added this flowchart from a publication of a colleague of mine. So it's. So if we look at decentralized finance it's always the question how decentralized is it really? And this flowchart guides you through because you have this, you can make the decision of centralized finance and decentralized finance and it's not that clear that you might think. So normally we say, okay, Defi, that's something based on a blockchain, it's open, it's permissionless, so everybody can contribute and it's smart, contract based, so it's automatic. We don't have any interference of people in there, but the user is in control.
00:04:14.904 - 00:05:05.924, Speaker A: So that's the main idea. And of course it's transparent and publicly verifiable and all these kind of topics. And I think what's also very important to understand it's 24/7 so I don't have any lag time. So where I say, well, okay, I can take the whole thing down, it's working all the time. And one of the biggest things is pseudonymity so that I don't act with my name. And that's one of the biggest issues when it comes to supervision. But following the flowchart, it's always the question when is it centralized and when is it decentralized? Because not just putting a protocol on a blockchain doesn't mean that it's defi.
00:05:05.924 - 00:06:23.640, Speaker A: So the first question is who is in control? Who has the keys to the smart contract? Who can change the smart contract or altitude? There are several possibilities even to change a smart contract afterwards. And even if this is out there, then do I have some kind of control mechanisms? Do I have a dao? And if I have a dao, then who owns the voting shares? And then at the end I can also ask myself, okay, now I'm on a blockchain, but this blockchain has some kind of governance model. So are there some main developers that can stop the blockchain? Think back to ethereum when we had fork. So still then, still, even if my whole protocol or my application is decentralized, I still rely on some infrastructure. So I think these are the questions we have to ask ourselves. And comparing decentralized finance with the traditional banking when it comes to risks. So that's the picture of traditional finance.
00:06:23.640 - 00:07:30.422, Speaker A: We have some kind of liquidity providers, we have the bank, the classical financial institute, we have a counterparty that gets loans, we have a market. And then outside of this ecosystem, we have the regulator, we have laws and we have supervision organizations. When we look into risk, traditional financial risks are three, or depending on how I look at four risks, that comes also from the basel three initiatives. And so one of the topic is market risk. So what happens if something happens on the market? So the whole stock markets go down. What risks does this mean for my ecosystem or my bank? I have the traditional credit risk. So if I'm a counterparty, what if I default? So that are risks always from the financial institute, the bank scene, I have liquidity risks.
00:07:30.422 - 00:08:15.006, Speaker A: What if there's a bank run and everybody takes out its money? So then I have an issue as a bank and operational risks, traditionally, what happens if something in the bank goes wrong, wrong decisions, fraud, stuff like this. It systems, cybersecurity risk, that's all operational risks or up risk. So that's from the traditional part. Now let's switch into defi. So I don't have any bank anymore. I have a smart contract, blockchain based. I now have cryptocurrencies.
00:08:15.006 - 00:09:07.924, Speaker A: I still also have this in a traditional finance now. But here the main focus market is the crypto market, not hackers, but anonymity. So I don't know who provides liquidity, and I don't know who is my counterparty. For example, for lending protocols, regulation is becoming pretty complex, because in the traditional market, if I'm a bank with a banking license, I'm under swiss regulation. If I'm a bank in Germany, I'm under german and EU regulation. If I'm in the US, I'm under US regulation, if I'm worldwide with DeFi. So which regulation apply? That's a big question.
00:09:07.924 - 00:09:48.650, Speaker A: Supervision. Today we don't have any supervision. Some say, well, it's a community that supervises. Yeah, that's exactly what we want to work on. Then other aspects, like I already mentioned, 24/7 we don't have any banking hours. So it's always, always up, always running. And also what's important when you look, for example, at lending in traditional banking, you normally have maturity times.
00:09:48.650 - 00:10:37.354, Speaker A: So you take a loan for three years, you invest into something for a period. When you look at Defi and the whole blockchain based protocols, I wouldn't say none, but 99.9% don't have any maturity. So it's always until the user takes out his money or pays back the loan. Yeah. And that's pretty complex to calculate risk, because all the risk models mainly work on this duration. And then when we look into the risk, we have, of course, the risks we already have in traditional banking.
00:10:37.354 - 00:11:55.746, Speaker A: But in addition, we get more technology risks, which we can put somewhere in the operational risk part we get, or we see more attacks to the market, like front running and stuff like this. Because you can do it. Yeah. Also the question do we have some supervision? We have regulatory risks in the meaning that which regulation really applies? And what happens if tomorrow the regulator says, well, okay, this is forbidden? So you have this kind of uncertainty, and you have the governance risk when you bring supervision to the community. So for example, Daos, who really observes this, and how can I guarantee that those stakeholders really comply to what is meant to what we did? In a research perspective, we looked into risks in Defi. And came up with this identification of various risks. And don't worry, it's small, but I have this on paper for you.
00:11:55.746 - 00:12:52.472, Speaker A: You know, the classical way universities work, but you also need this for the workshop, so everybody can take this home. Or also if you want to look into the publication, I think slides are distributed. So now with this, I really want to step into discussing risks with you. And for this, you know, as I mentioned, the classical way, I've got some. Can I just give this to you? Thanks a lot. I have more. If we need more paper, you also can work in teams, you can come up.
00:12:52.472 - 00:14:05.124, Speaker A: It really should be a little bit interactive. I know it's, this kind of classroom settings is not the best way to start this. And before we work here in this, I got another survey coming up. So for those who joined late, you can scan this code. For those who already participated in the first poll, you should just continue with the same link. And the question would be, which risks were you the most in defi? Give you a little bit of time. Thanks.
00:14:05.124 - 00:15:10.526, Speaker A: So, got the first answer. Unfortunately I cannot present this, but I'll read it loud, so. Okay, so answers are coming in. At the moment, we are mainly worried about regulatory risks. Four and two, operational risks. So nobody's worried about technology. That's good, because you all are the Defi experts that develop these protocols.
00:15:10.526 - 00:15:41.260, Speaker A: No errors, of course. Oh yeah. Okay, sorry, I should have told this because now it's coming. The first, technology risk. Okay, so now we got one, technology risk, two operational risks, and four, regulatory risks. Wonderful. Let's go back.
00:15:41.260 - 00:16:54.324, Speaker A: And one, market risk, two, technology risk. Okay. Yeah, so I prepared this small canvas for this session, and the idea is, I think you're all familiar with canvas, like the business model canvas. So the question is, and perhaps you can also discuss, it's a workshop, it's not an exam, so don't worry. So what do you see? Which risks do you see? So again, we have two technology people who see technology risk, operational risk, one, market risk, and four, regulatory risks. So what risks do we have and who or how can we assess them? That's the question. So if I have operational risks, how can I measure this risk? What do you see in possibilities to measure those risks? And really happy to start a discussion with you.
00:16:57.724 - 00:17:16.604, Speaker B: Point of view. Like DeFi protocols, they don't have the custody, but they receive the postage from users. And if there is any smart contract potential exploit and your funds are at risk. So that's very common with the hacks?
00:17:16.764 - 00:17:32.824, Speaker A: Yes. And how would you assess them? Or how would you measure this? Just money's gone. Oh, of money lost. Yeah, potentially lost.
00:17:40.524 - 00:17:45.424, Speaker C: How much of your overall wealth orientation is in which protocol.
00:17:45.924 - 00:17:47.584, Speaker B: And maybe you can diversify.
00:17:51.464 - 00:18:34.134, Speaker A: That's already into measures how I can address this risk. We'll come to this later. But yeah, this is one possibility, diversify the risks. So I'm open here, but I think this is from a protocol perspective, as I understood. You're right. But we can also from a user perspective, also I can diversify. I can put my money in different DeFi protocols and hope that not all got hacked.
00:18:34.134 - 00:18:37.814, Speaker A: Yes.
00:18:43.414 - 00:19:16.094, Speaker B: One is about the relation between technology risk and governance, or regulatory risk. For example, the issue of especially, I mean hacks or smart contract risk, I mean bots, maybe some situations they require hardcore and other stuff. It is very, I mean, also yesterday there were many discussions about the law responsible.
00:19:17.634 - 00:19:22.306, Speaker A: So who is responsible for the error? And actually it is possible, but in.
00:19:22.330 - 00:19:46.474, Speaker B: The eye of the law, no government is such willing to do it. In order to not obstruct the innovation. Maybe it is better to. I mean, I would like to also say, for example, as a potential solution, it will be better to regulate the crypto as a service providers.
00:19:47.534 - 00:20:02.494, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll come to this point. It's great if you already think about solutions. I always tell my students and it students always start with the solution. Think about the problem first.
00:20:05.594 - 00:20:35.030, Speaker B: Especially again about smart contracts and cyber attacks. Generally when it happens, sometimes the devils must act to solve it or prevent it. But the problem is in taking decision. The devils is dealing with the classical political science issues which are coming from hundreds use of the bench. But Dawa mammals are generally the technical.
00:20:35.142 - 00:20:40.198, Speaker A: People in terms of PLT techniques.
00:20:40.366 - 00:20:49.514, Speaker B: And they don't have much idea about how to take decisions in an efficient way. So I think the government.
00:20:51.134 - 00:21:03.594, Speaker A: Okay, thanks for this input. Other topics we come to mind when you look at risks and how or how can we measure or assess them.
00:21:06.494 - 00:21:39.458, Speaker D: On the first kind like hacks and bugs. So possibility or, I mean, it's difficult to measure that obviously. But one way is like trying to use to audit these codes and use look for whether this are based on standard technology or standard codes or whatever. I'm not a technical person, but I guess you can do that in some way and also based on the complexity. So the less complex the less likely.
00:21:39.586 - 00:22:33.714, Speaker A: For these kind of errors. Yeah, fully agree. I think that's not the first reason for ERC 20 or those token standards. But also it's one reason, because when I stick to a standard and I use this code, then I know that all the others already use this, so I can be sure it's more or less safe. On the other hand, it lowers the innovation part, of course, because I stick to standard, I do whatever the others already do. And when you look, for example, to lending protocols or exchange protocols, each protocol comes up with their own individual ideas and how liquidity is provided, how exchange is done. That's also the innovation part.
00:22:33.714 - 00:23:50.024, Speaker A: Okay, so let's go further. We already did this to challenges here. So when we ask ourselves, why do we have supervision? Or what is the. The aim of supervision, then it's not all about knowing what the financial market is doing. So the responsibility for supervision, even in the traditional finance, is transparency. So being able to show what's happening on the market, and also to the users or stakeholder, transparency about the market, then it's all about risk management. And it's always the question, supervision, on which level? So on a bank level or financial institute, it's about supervision of this institute and monitoring and reducing the risks of this institute.
00:23:50.024 - 00:24:11.664, Speaker A: When you look at the country's perspective, like supervision from Finma or National bank, it's all about looking into the systemic risk factors. So the national bank is responsible for the Swiss like systemic risk. You had a question?
00:24:12.004 - 00:24:23.144, Speaker C: I don't know why you say transparency for the banking sector, or I got something wrong. So you see that the supervision aims for some.
00:24:28.144 - 00:25:42.478, Speaker A: Well, yeah, monitoring is it also. But also one of the tasks of supervision today in the financial market is to bring transparency on the market. When you look, for example, at FinMa SMB, they put publish reports about the actual status of. They also have, or we also have regulation that forces the financial institute to publish some standards. So that's the idea behind this then also supervision, or the aim of supervision is that we have integrity to make sure that institutes really follow the rules. We don't have any market manipulation. Of course, financial stability, this comes together with the risk management, consumer protection, so that I'm, as a user or participant in this ecosystem, is saved from this.
00:25:42.478 - 00:26:16.258, Speaker A: Also, when you look at the traditional banking, we have some kind of funds. So if a bank goes bankrupt, I get at least some part from my money back from this fund. Then comes the legal side. Yeah. Supervision also enforces compliance with the law. And one of the laws is know your customer or anti money laundry counter financing of terrorism and stuff like this. And also to prevent monopoly.
00:26:16.258 - 00:27:25.704, Speaker A: So when you ask a supervisor from a financial perspective, what are your roles? These are the roles. Now the big question about finance or supervision in, in the defi space is, what is your opinion? Who should be responsible for supervision in the defi space? And I also gave you multiple choices, so you can decide how much they should be responsible. And for those who are new in this space, dyor, do your own research. So that's the traditional part. You say, okay, user, if you participate in this space, you're responsible for your own market. You have to do your research. And if you invest in a protocol that's fraud, then, yeah, your research was wrong.
00:27:25.704 - 00:27:59.824, Speaker A: And one question also. You find the node operators, the validators, I think with proof of stake, validators now not minus anymore, they are validators. And validators could also validate further points. So that's the question. Should we enforce those validators, that they take additional parts in this ecosystem? What is your opinion?
00:28:05.924 - 00:28:41.844, Speaker B: The problem is that if they will be responsible with supervision, but I mean, this system, from techniques to its department, is based on game theory, so there will be strictly conflict of interest. So, in my, my personal opinion, the ultimate way for the supervision will belong to users or user companies, individuals itself. I mean, the most likely, there will be no other way to your search for.
00:28:43.744 - 00:29:02.882, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think that's, that's the open question. Is it that you, as you mentioned, that a game theory behind this whole validation makes it impossible that validators really act on the best behalf of the users, but on the best behalf of themselves?
00:29:03.058 - 00:29:36.954, Speaker B: Because the first rule of supervision, for example, in classical finance, is that audit, for example, supervision must be made by considerably more independent authority. This is why, for example, central or regulator authorities were part established years ago today. Okay, maybe it is here. I mean, who will be considered independent do not have conflict of interest, I think.
00:29:40.494 - 00:30:26.304, Speaker A: So when I look at the results, it's a little bit a put. So we have a slightly winner between the classical regulator, finma, the developers, and the dao. Also, the user should be responsible, the community should be responsible. None of the above. That's a great part. Who voted for none of the above and has some great new ideas. Nobody want to ask or you.
00:30:26.304 - 00:31:11.554, Speaker A: So not the country based regulation. Okay, so we should have some global unit that regulates DeFi as a global financial system. Yeah, we are open. It's a workshop. It's not some other. The legislator. Who is the legislator? Swiss parliament or the US parliament for each.
00:31:11.554 - 00:31:18.614, Speaker A: Okay, other opinions.
00:31:32.994 - 00:31:54.234, Speaker C: But for now, I think it's important to note that people immigrate into the DeFi world. We need trusted people, trusted institutions. So I think Myanmar might be somewhat of a big player in the short term, while it's had to go away from institutions in the Irish.
00:31:55.614 - 00:33:12.034, Speaker A: So the idea is during a ramp up phase, we have the traditional like finma until we get this kind of big daos that are able to supervise this. Okay. So yeah, let's discuss or work on the right part. So I just put two columns. One, who are the stakeholders and what is their duty? You already filled out this poll and perhaps you can also look into this and know from your opinion who are the stakeholders, what are their duty in this whole defi ecosystem. Again, also discuss with your neighbors, which is hard in this setting, who is distributed? Yeah, we are talking about distributed decentralized finance. So it's completely great that you are distributed in the whole room.
00:33:12.034 - 00:34:47.767, Speaker A: Other opinions on this? Are there any stakeholders we haven't touched yet? There in your opinion, all and each, each one has their duty or different duty or. So the idea is to list them and also on the right side, list to each stakeholder. What is her or his duty on this topic? Okay, let's move on. So the idea of this governance column is to bring those sites together. So on the one hand side we have the risks and how we can measure them. Your ideas on the risks and measurements. And on the other hand we have the stakeholders and their duties and how can we bring them together.
00:34:47.767 - 00:35:05.123, Speaker A: So how can we form or formulate methods or protocols that each of the stakeholders can fulfill their duty and reduce or control the risks. What are your opinions on this.
00:35:11.044 - 00:35:11.404, Speaker B: Based.
00:35:11.444 - 00:36:12.604, Speaker A: On past failures, let's say standards. So, learning from failures, what we, I think also in the traditional finance, we learn from failures. So there is a big issue, financial crisis 20080 nine and now we make new regulation and we have this kind of liquidity reserve and all this stuff. Yeah, the big issue is we first have to lose money to learn. And the other question is how we derecord these issues and how can we educate the financial market. Should there be a joint database for issues? What is your opinion on this?
00:36:14.264 - 00:37:29.864, Speaker B: For example, DeFi generally, for example, in my related, in many ways, because the innovation should be promoted because so it is how it is. The problem is that. But what happens if some damage or other results for responsibility? In my opinion, if the third party service providers and service providers like centralized exchanges, they are operating almost in the same principle with classical market service providers and they are much more profitable and they are company, I mean profit focused companies. So we can take those heavyweights, that burden, false burden, false social burden from Defi developers or who can be responsible. And we can put this burden on the shoulders of predecessors or VLT service providers who operate with the same principle of classical ones.
00:37:31.244 - 00:37:37.264, Speaker A: Okay, so we. We take them in charge, who make the big money.
00:37:38.284 - 00:37:38.980, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:37:39.052 - 00:37:39.348, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:39.396 - 00:37:47.424, Speaker B: In exchange with that huge profit. Not only my profit. Also there is a.
00:37:49.624 - 00:38:07.924, Speaker A: The big question is who takes them into account? And I think also in DeFi, it's always the question, if it's a country based regulation, what prevents them from switching countries? Just going to another country where there's not this regulation.
00:38:10.384 - 00:38:37.784, Speaker B: The problem will occur here. If we put such burden on the shoulders of those service providers, they will try to do a legal arbitrage. I mean, they will try to change the jurisdiction. Having a standard which can be enforced by the more reality focused countries will be.
00:38:40.864 - 00:39:04.916, Speaker A: Yeah. Open. Open to you. So, yeah, I think if you thought about governance and bringing stakeholders or linking stakeholders to risks and how we can observe this. So the next question. I just have to switch here. Yeah.
00:39:04.916 - 00:40:49.664, Speaker A: So the next question would be, what do you think from the above? How can this compliance be measured or should be measured? So what kind of standards or measurement standards should we introduce into DeFi to assess the risks? And also our goal is to ensure that DeFi operates correctly, legally, correctly, with our ethical standards. And I know that at this point, when we go worldwide, there are different ethical standards. I know, but I think transparency and non fraud are compliant with all countries that we don't have or we don't see this as ethical. So what do you think about measure possibilities or measurement possibilities? Sorry. It's. Again, when I come back to the goals of supervision. So to fulfill, or in order to fulfill those goals, what measurements should we take?
00:40:52.664 - 00:40:58.804, Speaker C: So, for the major players, you may want to have the code audited or certified.
00:41:01.864 - 00:41:38.744, Speaker A: Okay. So major, what makes me a major player? The big five protocols. D five protocols. Okay. Like Abe and Mechadao and those, I think. Okay. Yeah, I think that's a good idea to say, okay, then we make an audit.
00:41:38.744 - 00:41:56.534, Speaker A: The big question is, when I become famous, my smart contract is already deployed. Then I audit a smart contract. I cannot change anymore. That's the question. Or I make a new version, or.
00:42:00.714 - 00:42:06.714, Speaker D: The result of the audit is that it's a bad product. Then you can inform the people and say, hey, don't use this product.
00:42:06.834 - 00:42:42.206, Speaker A: Hey, my product is bad. Please don't use it. But use version two. Yeah. Valid. Yeah. But who should be the auditors? Okay, so the regulator should appoint some audit companies, like.
00:42:42.206 - 00:43:04.994, Speaker A: Like the big five and new business for Carpengay and all the others. Okay. Yeah, good idea. Yeah.
00:43:05.514 - 00:43:26.930, Speaker C: So I think when it's split it in two rights with the legal side and regulatory side, where I guess national regulation should have a look if any laws are broken within the protocol or service which is offered, and make them aware something is against regulation when it's possible.
00:43:27.002 - 00:43:27.186, Speaker A: Right.
00:43:27.210 - 00:43:35.914, Speaker C: If it's not completely decentralized. But on the other hand, it security topics which might be vulnerabilities.
00:43:36.814 - 00:43:41.526, Speaker A: Security topics. You mean technology risk, like technology wise.
00:43:41.710 - 00:43:43.954, Speaker C: I think regulation is.
00:43:46.534 - 00:43:47.134, Speaker B: But I think.
00:43:47.174 - 00:43:54.062, Speaker C: The community itself will find weak points very fast and make the noise more, exploit them even.
00:43:54.118 - 00:43:54.310, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:54.342 - 00:43:56.474, Speaker C: And then this is a problem which can.
00:43:59.594 - 00:44:37.914, Speaker A: The market resolves itself some kind of bounty system. Because the big question is how do those errors really come up and arise? Or what prevents me from a developer when I find this, this topic that I wait until there is enough cryptocurrency in this and then pull it out and then really make a bigger damage.
00:44:47.634 - 00:44:50.426, Speaker C: If they would find it a bit so sophisticated.
00:44:50.610 - 00:45:34.904, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think smart contract code is getting pretty complex. And especially if you then combine products with other products, it's much more complex. And to say, okay, finma, lucky you. So far you just observed the traditional banking, but now here are a thousand smart contracts. Go for it. Find the errors, products and services, which all are.
00:45:34.904 - 00:45:47.684, Speaker A: Leave this to the community. Okay, sure.
00:45:59.664 - 00:47:22.706, Speaker B: Who will be responsible for this? I think here the key is legitimacy. For example, a certified entity is more like more trustable. But the point is how can it be certified by law? It may be not suitable because law is strict and it can cause other consequences, in my opinion, like ISO international standard organization, for example, they are generally internationally more trusted, considerably more trusted and more legitimate standards in their eyes of users entities. So maybe for example, like ISO in international, for example, the most, by the way, maybe it already made most encountered defi attacks can be explained, descriptive and who. I mean the measures, potential measures, how can, how they can be taken, those can be explained. And the entities in any jurisdiction who attach to, audit or supervise DeFi protocols can be certified according to these rules. So.
00:47:22.850 - 00:48:31.634, Speaker A: So coming up, ISO standards for. Okay, so just looking a little bit on the time and want to come to our last box in this topic. Now, we discussed risks and who is responsible, who should be responsible, how can we measure it? And then the question is, how should we report it? So the question who should report what to whom? So for example, the developers, technological or security issues to the community or to whoever, who should be the receiver of these reports? What do you think?
00:48:33.574 - 00:49:20.594, Speaker B: I think there should be an intermediate system like complaint or reporting should be made to a classical regulatory authority or supervisor authority, but it should be published more transparent in the forwards about DeFi. So if it will be, all of them will be published, for example. The point is that also the communities or independent developers, independent entities can also be included in that discussion. Report complaining. I think it should be reported to classical authorities with much more transparency in case it is about impact.
00:49:23.414 - 00:49:25.074, Speaker A: Good. Other opinions.
00:49:36.884 - 00:49:51.344, Speaker D: I mean, there are a lot of points there. We don't discuss about all information, but most information, so that it can, on the one hand decide for themselves which ones are the good and bad ones, and on the other hand that the developers can learn from it. So I think it's very important that it's not.
00:49:56.244 - 00:50:08.950, Speaker A: So like the regulator collects or gives some, some standards and then collects this and then publish it to the, to the community.
00:50:09.142 - 00:50:09.670, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:09.742 - 00:50:12.594, Speaker B: Or you have to report like these.
00:50:13.654 - 00:50:22.414, Speaker D: If it's possible to enforce it, then these enforce that. These have to like you have like these annual reports, you have to report something to follow.
00:50:22.494 - 00:51:31.654, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, great. So I think, thank you for your inputs as a conclusion from my side, it was fun having also a small group having this lively discussion, even in this large setting. Also for me, very interesting. What's your opinions about who should work on this whole supervision? I think when we observe the space, there will be more regulation on this, so more, and I think it's also because there are more institutional investors coming into this space and they want to have some kind of certainty, so they want risk management. So there are the voices that there has to be some regulation and also some supervision about, about this. From my perspective, the biggest issue is we are in a global, worldwide market.
00:51:31.654 - 00:52:36.062, Speaker A: So who is the authority that takes this role? As you mentioned before, perhaps at the beginning we have to have the traditional players and then going into a DAO. And we had a lot of discussion about regulation in daos and does it work or work not? So that's interesting to see. So in the university we'll always ask at the end, how do you rate this workshop? So I invite you to give feedback on the workshop how satisfactory this was to you. It's an open discussion. I think we all learned from it. I hope so. Thank you very much for this feedback.
00:52:36.062 - 00:53:23.324, Speaker A: And I got a last poll. Which of the aspects was valuable for you most value the group discussion. And I think that was great, even if it was a small group, a great discussion. Thank you from my side for attending this workshop. I hope you also took something with this. And I wish you nice uproar afterwards. Thank you.
