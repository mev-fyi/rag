00:00:14.720 - 00:01:06.554, Speaker A: Thank you. You very much. Thank you. Hello, Kikuyu is here. Thank you very much for attending. Yeah, we will be talking about running notes and particularly running nodes in resource constrained devices. So, you know, click now I don't know what I'm doing now.
00:01:06.554 - 00:02:00.454, Speaker A: Thank you, thank you. Yeah, decentralization starts by people running notes at home. This is a decentralized technology and this is a key, absolutely key feature for a blockchain to be decentralized, completely decentralized. So for example, how many of you are running nodes at home? Raspberry buy yeah, not much. What kind of nodes? Ethereum one, ethereum two. Are someone validating are running bitcoin chain? Not much. And I think that's a little problem, I mean, and that's why we are here.
00:02:00.454 - 00:02:50.720, Speaker A: I mean, when I first ran into Ethereum, I was learning about the technology, watching videos and getting myself educated with Ethereum, very excited. And I thought, how can I contribute to this, to the community? Well, the answer was obvious. I mean, you can run a node. So I decided to set up a node. And when I got the node up and running, I thought, wait a minute, this was not easy. And I have a Linux background. I was working for a company for 15 years, that is Linux focus.
00:02:50.720 - 00:03:59.304, Speaker A: I mean, in server side I have this kind of skills and it wasn't easy for me. So I thought, well, we'll be able, regular users to run an ethereum node. And the answer by that time was obviously not. And another question that I asked myself was, yeah, does it make sense to run an old on my laptop, for example, or on my desktop, because, you know, you have your daily job, you have to do a lot of tasks and you are browsing the Internet. And I don't know, I thought I cannot run a node on my laptop, for example. So we start looking for other alternatives and that's why we find these little devices that you all know, like the Raspberry PI. There are a lot of boards, but Raspberry PI's.
00:03:59.304 - 00:04:20.204, Speaker A: And I thought, hey, can a device like this run a node, sync the whole blockchain, et cetera. So we tried, we set up the node and it worked, and here we are. So Fernand is talking a little about what we provide.
00:04:23.064 - 00:05:08.084, Speaker B: Ok, I'm here to talk about what is filling armor that you can read. We provide a blue gambling image for arm socks that automatically turns a board into a full ethereum node. What does it mean? Right now this is an u 2200 four image. It's based on Ubuntu. And we provide a set of scripts and whole repository who transform this ubuntu imaging ethereum node in automatic way. You have to do nothing. It's the only thing that you have to do is write in an SD card image, plug it to the device and you are good to go, you are running.
00:05:08.084 - 00:06:16.834, Speaker B: So what do we think that is needed to create this kind of message? The first thing that you have to think is the configuration for regular users to run an image pretty useful that you don't have to change any configuration, that everything works out of the box and in this image everything works out of the box. You have available almost all the ethereum clients already configured already all the configuration files in his side, the partitions, the ports, everything is ready to go. And you have to be another one. You have to be easy. The installation is the easiest that you could imagine, should have to write one imaging SD card. And the upgrade is also easy because we provide an apt repository and you only need to update the whole system. With the whole system, the new versions of the packets of the Ethereum clients, it will be available for you and we will automatically updated and restarted.
00:06:16.834 - 00:06:57.114, Speaker B: We have to support as many devices as we can. Right now we have available the image for the Raspberry PI four. This is the only one. But if you use our GitHub repository, you could use also for the right that Diego will talk about it later. And this year probably one or two more devices are coming and one of them is very promising. And we have to make sure that this image is production ready. And right now it's production ready because we are staking from day Zero in a Raspberry PI four with almost no problem ruining Ethereum one, Ethereum two client in the same device.
00:06:57.114 - 00:07:35.808, Speaker B: Why we choose arm devices like the auto before? First of all, they are affordable. Most of these devices are cheaper than the regular ones, cheaper than intel NUC or this small server or a small home server. Are cheaper, are low power. I think we can run under 15 watts. And in our mesos, the Raspberry PI four are syncing the whole network. The whole blockchain running under nine or ten watts.
00:07:35.856 - 00:07:36.616, Speaker A: Nine on ten?
00:07:36.720 - 00:08:21.812, Speaker B: Yeah, and 900 watts. And they are performant right now these devices are able to sync the whole blockchain and are able to room all the clients in one only devices. And with the ROK five, that's a board that we will talk later. Even the Hava base one, there are small form factors. Okay, what does it mean they are small devices? You could run it at home because it's a very small device, not very noisy. Sometimes it depends on the fan, the fan stack that you buy to tend to cool it. And you could only with two small wires you cut two small cables.
00:08:21.812 - 00:08:53.828, Speaker B: You can use one for the power, another one for the network and you're ready to go. So you need a. At your home, you don't need to run a home server room or nothing like this. You can run a node in a box like this site, very very small. And this is the last point is for us very important is architecture diversity. Okay. Most of the nodes that are running right now, the ethereum blockchain are based on intel or AMD architecture.
00:08:53.828 - 00:09:21.644, Speaker B: If you found any problem like Spectre a few years ago, that could be a security problem. Is related to the architecture, is useful for the network to have another nodes that are running a different architecture in order to. It's like the same thing with the variety of clients. You need to protect yourself. And if some client has a bug or some security problem, it's the same for the architecture.
00:09:22.174 - 00:09:42.154, Speaker A: Sorry Fernand, we are as well testing risk five, not only arm and it's a very interesting architecture because it's open and we would not have only open software but open hardware. It would be very interesting.
00:09:44.134 - 00:10:32.084, Speaker B: Later we can talk about the image itself. What does this image provide? The first thing is an automatic installation setup. That means the image take care of all the steps needed to run out it, format the disk, create the partitions. You obviously need external disk, SSD disk or an NVme disk and the image do this job for you. It also creates Ethereum user and all the configuration for all the clients. It includes all the major clients using our own IPT repository. In our repository you could easily install or easily update any of the major Ethereum clients.
00:10:32.084 - 00:11:29.604, Speaker B: This package includes assisting their services so you could start stop restarting any of the Ethereum clients they are running in background. If the process has any problem or stops, it will restart automatically. It will continue to working. I think for us is very important. It includes self monitoring those words using Prometheus and grafana. We include a Prometheus server that are already pre configured to read stats for all the clients and even stats from their own device. And with this Grafana dashboards you could be able to see the progress of the syncing, you could be able to see the memory network disk problems.
00:11:29.604 - 00:11:50.884, Speaker B: You could know better hardware and know if you need anything else, more disk, more memory or whatever, or even the throughput of your network, anything. It's all ready to see and Diego is going to talk to you a little more about the device itself that we are working with.
00:11:51.944 - 00:12:26.808, Speaker A: Yeah, the Raspberry PI. This is our most proven device. I mean, you all know it day Giga RAM model. It's capable of syncing the main net in two, three days. I would say two with a new snap system. You just need USB three, two SSD disk and SSD disk with a bridge. And it's capable of running both Ethereum one nodes and ethereum two.
00:12:26.808 - 00:13:21.784, Speaker A: I mean, for example, geth and Lighthouse at the same time. And we've been staking here with this device since day zero, meaning both nodes one the beacon chain and one validator in the same device just with this board and usb through USB three disk. So it's very proof. I mean it's rock solid. We didn't have any major problem with it. It was running 24/7 for two years, or you know, always there is a blackout or maybe a problem with micro sd, but minor problems. I mean the device are very solid and ideal for these kind of tasks.
00:13:21.784 - 00:14:15.448, Speaker A: And it's been great, it's been great. This one, we recited this one, the ROK five B, I think two weeks ago. Well, this is a game changer because this has 16GB of RAM, eight cores, a powerful, very powerful CPU, but an NVMe with four lanes and it's amazingly fast. I mean this is another kind of device. This is able to sync maintenance in 18 hours. And currently we are testing it and running visu, which in the raspberry PI it was impossible to run. Biso, not impossible, but it couldn't sync the whole blockchain.
00:14:15.448 - 00:15:30.034, Speaker A: And this, we are currently making tests with this because it's very recent, I think it's not even available for the public. But we contacted the manufacturer directly and we could buy directly from them and we were absolutely astonished because it's an amazing board and it has another interesting capability that is that it includes the crypto extensions. And this will improve very, we think very much the hashing tasks. For example, we need to test this. But for example, the Raspberry PI didn't include this because of licensing problems. And this is another great feature of this board. We are planning maybe some two or three weeks in releasing an image for this.
00:15:30.034 - 00:16:12.252, Speaker A: And everyone will be able to run this device as an ethereum node. And the last one that we are talking today is the hardcore nano droid demo one. This one is more equivalent to the Raspberry P four. It's something. The cpu is less performant, but it's ok, but it has nvme support that it's very cool. That includes as well the crypto extensions, the hardware crypto extensions that it's very interesting. Now we are talking a little of the merge.
00:16:12.252 - 00:17:37.068, Speaker A: Well you know, we are all very excited with the merge and we've been testing pretty much from the beginning, you know, the big changes, the switch from post to pos and that mining, mining will be able producing blocks will be able to, you will be able to produce blocks on consumer hardware like these boards and that's name changes of the Ethereum clients. We have pretty much all clients available as of today. For everyone who wants to play along with merge to join the testnets we have a specific image which you can download and run. You know that now you have to run two clients, the f one client and f two clients at the same time. You can pick whatever client you want and test in your device. We joined as well, many main net shadow folks. You know that this was organized by the Ethereum foundation team.
00:17:37.068 - 00:18:59.450, Speaker A: We've been in contact with them and joining I think three main net shadow forks. It went right and well, they work perfectly and four days ago we joined the ropes for as well. So yeah, it seems that Ethereum is going in the right path. I mean you will be able to run oath with consumer hardware and this is great. And if you compare it with other blockchains, you realize that Ethereum is taking this very seriously, very seriously, because from the very beginning you were able to run a node and if you read other blockchain specifications, you will see that you will need absolute server monster in some cases to run a blockchain node. So will it be possible to run post merge nodes in these kinds of devices? Well, two or three weeks ago, I would say most probably with the new ROK five board. Absolutely, yes.
00:18:59.450 - 00:19:18.264, Speaker A: So yeah, we will be there, we'll be working on this. And when the merge comes, I'm sure that anybody that wants to run a note in this kind of devices, it will be quite easy. That's.
