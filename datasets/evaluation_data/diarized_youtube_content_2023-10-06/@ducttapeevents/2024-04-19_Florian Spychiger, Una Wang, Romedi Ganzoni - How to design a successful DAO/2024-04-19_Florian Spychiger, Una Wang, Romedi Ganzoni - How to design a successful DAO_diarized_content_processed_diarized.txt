00:00:00.360 - 00:00:37.378, Speaker A: So good morning also from my side. Very happy to be here. So today we will have this workshop together, how to design a successful Dao. I will give you a short introduction. What is Dao Swiss? Also, because we will use this as an example, especially Uno's part, on how to decentralize a DaO. Because that's what we are also working on currently. And then I will also give you a short overview on organizational design of a DAO.
00:00:37.378 - 00:01:15.940, Speaker A: Or maybe we'll give you an overview on the legal side. And as said, una will talk a bit about how to decentralize Daos. And then in the second part, we would like to open up first for your questions, but then also have an open discussion. Also hearing your experiences, your opinions. What makes a DAO successful? What are some challenges? How should we all go about designing Daos? Good. As I said, I start shortly with Dao Swiss. So Dao Swiss is the industry association for Daos in Switzerland.
00:01:15.940 - 00:02:25.414, Speaker A: The aim of Taos is to make Switzerland the go to place for Taos globally. So for this, we want to create a platform for knowledge exchange, bring interested people together, experts together, to tackle several challenges that people are facing currently, be it legal challenges, be it challenges on the organizational design, the technological challenges, and so on. So Daoswiz was created out of this need because we had many talks with them, different people that were always around these ideas or challenges when setting up a DAO. Maybe to give you a bit background. So DAO Swiss is legally a swiss association. As such, it has a council and a general assembly as any association. What's a bit special in our statute, we also have the DAO, which is a third body in DAO Swiss.
00:02:25.414 - 00:03:08.136, Speaker A: Currently, I have to say that our Swiss is working rather like a standard swiss association. And we are now trying to decentralize more and more, especially this DAo body. Because as of now the DAO has this rights to improve, to propose some improvements of any kind. Besides that, we also have working groups. I will tell you a bit about this. And we have also a business management position that is doing mostly the operational part. Just quickly, this is the council.
00:03:08.136 - 00:03:49.304, Speaker A: Currently three of them are here. So Romedy, Una and me. But there is also Malik and Ayla. Part of the council was founded a little bit in June last year. Before this, we were discussing about almost two years how to set up Dao Swiss, which also shows that it can be quite a long process to design a Dao. As I also mentioned before in the talk from Anthony at Oregon, who said setting up a large dao. Not that Tao Swiss is extremely large dao, but in general, setting up a DAO can take several years.
00:03:49.304 - 00:04:49.872, Speaker A: We have many members, several organizations, mostly from Switzerland, and also many individual members that are quite active in Daosuiss. As I said, we have four working groups at the moment. So one group, led by Romede is mostly working on the legal and tech side. Then we have the organizational structures, we have the tech and tooling side, and we also have a Dao launchpad. The first cohort was just finalized now where we help young teams to set up daos and give them also an opportunity or prepare them for a pitch for funding. This is in collaboration with the blockchain Innobooster, founded by Innoswiss. Then also just this was the first presentation this morning there will be a Dao Raider ecosystem.
00:04:49.872 - 00:05:34.136, Speaker A: You have seen a sneak peek this morning. If you attended the presentation, this will come out in I think May or June, and you will have the full report on all the DAO activities in Switzerland. Good. This was just a short intro to give you some background on Dao Swiss. Now for the workshop, I'm going to start to give you a short overview. It's an outcome of a research project that we did at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, where we try to come up with a design framework from an organizational perspective for DAos. I will also have a talk tomorrow in the morning at ten.
00:05:34.136 - 00:06:28.780, Speaker A: It's not the best slot, but still for the early birds, if you're interested to know more about this Dao framework, you can attend this lecture tomorrow. And there we will really deep dive into this framework. Good. So for DAos, what we found. So, in collaboration with many Taoists in Switzerland, but also legal experts, also organizational experts, we came up with three major constituent elements of Taos that play an important role. When you think about the organizational design or on how to design daos, the first that is often mentioned is that the purpose of a DAO. So first you should think about what do you want to achieve with your daO, because this is also an important thing to align.
00:06:28.780 - 00:07:15.618, Speaker A: Then, for example, your community and all your contributors. What we also think is very important is the use case, the business case. So how do you make sure that your DAO is sustainably financed, for example, that you can reward contributors, that you have a business model that allows you to run your operations. And then there is also legislation. Legislation can influence your organizational design. So for example, in our case with Tao Swiss, we need to have a council, we need to have the General assembly. So two organizational bodies that we need to have, but vice versa.
00:07:15.618 - 00:08:43.014, Speaker A: Maybe also your organizational design can then decide or determine your legal form. But Ramidi will certainly talk more about this then besides these constituent elements of a dao, for other structural elements that one can or should think about when setting up a Dao that we identified is the decision making aspect. So how do you reach decisions in a DAO? There are several ways. Do you want to include everyone in the decisions? Do you want to include only a few? What kind of mechanisms you want to use? Token based voting, some kind of more fancy voting mechanisms, quadratic voting, reputation based voting. There are many possibilities then tokens, usually those have tokens, use them to incentivize members, to maybe issue membership rights, to give governance rights, and so on. So there are also different ways how you can design these token models then treasury. That's also one important part, because often in a DAO, the members collectively somehow administer a treasury and decide on how this treasury is used or allocated.
00:08:43.014 - 00:09:52.032, Speaker A: And then another factor, which is also quite important somehow, sometimes underestimated, is the communication part. So you can think about what should be communicated in a DAO. Do you want to communicate everything? So this is following the transparency rules. However, there might be also an overload of information, what kind of channels you want to use in your dao, and so on. And then the last but very important element. I think it also fits nicely with what again, Anthony introduced before with the modular Aragon governance framework that you think about organizational bodies in the sense that not only you have the community, which is an organizational body, but there can also be other organizational bodies, such as guilds that you define. There might be a core team that has a special role, some project teams that are maybe temporary organizational bodies.
00:09:52.032 - 00:10:29.744, Speaker A: And they are quite central because within these organizational bodies, you could have different decision making mechanisms, different communication channels. They might have different ways on how to decide on part of the treasury. So this seems quite a central part. And it's there in many daos, even though sometimes it's not explicit. If you look at daos, many of them have some implicit structures. Might it just be the core team? But maybe it's not an implicit body. So it's quite important also to think about this.
00:10:29.744 - 00:10:38.264, Speaker A: So with this very short overview now let's focus on this part with Romedis input.
00:10:38.724 - 00:11:24.466, Speaker B: Great, thanks also from my side and welcome. I know the topic is how to design a successful dao. I'm the legal guy, so I cannot tell you how you design your successful dao, but I can tell you how you should not design it because then you will fail. And when it comes to daos, usually have two topics that are the most crucial ones. The most crucial ones are the qualification of the token of the daO, and the second one, the structure of your DAO. And when it comes to token qualifications, you see these circles, you have payment tokens, asset tokens and utility tokens. So the payment tokens ones are the ones that are used to make payments to buy stuff.
00:11:24.466 - 00:11:55.914, Speaker B: So ETH, USDC, bitcoin would be payment tokens. Then you have the asset tokens. They're the ones that give you a claim against someone. So be it membership, be it a share, be it revenue share of some protocol. They all most likely fall into the asset token category. And then you have the utility tokens. They're the ones that give you access to application or a service on chain.
00:11:55.914 - 00:12:32.910, Speaker B: And as you can see, these circles, they overlap. So tokens can be both. Best example is ETH. So ETH has been issued as a pure utility token. You can use ETH to use the ethereum network, but over time it developed also to a payment token because you can use ETH to buy NFTs and that's why you will be there somewhere in between in the overlap of payment and utility token. And the same is true for utility and asset, payment and asset. So hybrid tokens are possible.
00:12:32.910 - 00:13:04.268, Speaker B: And my question is, why do we even make these categories? Does any of you have an idea? Legal reasons. Exactly. So you see the same again, payment token, asset token, utility token with description and typical regulations. That's the important one on this slide. So you have with payment tokens, usually AML. So anti money laundering laws are applicable. That's important for you.
00:13:04.268 - 00:13:44.512, Speaker B: If you issue a token for your DAo and that token can also be used to buy stuff, then you have to comply with AML. So you have to KYC the contributors, you have to KYC people that you give an airdrop can be quite complex. As a token. You heard securities regulations probably all over the place. So asset tokens, usually security regulations apply. Means if you issue a token, your dao token that is also considered a security, then you have to comply with these laws. You have to potentially issue a prospectus, key information document.
00:13:44.512 - 00:14:14.694, Speaker B: Secondary market is highly regulated, so they shouldn't even be on dexs, but usually they are. And then utility token, that's the sweet spot. That's where you want to go. So utility tokens are not regulated. That's why you should try to remain in that realm. Then the legal structures of daos here, we have to make the first distinction. The most important one is actually, is it an unwrapped dao or a wrap dao.
00:14:14.694 - 00:14:52.850, Speaker B: And a wrapped out would be a Dao that is part of a. Of a legal entity. And an unwrapped Dao is simply, you distribute tokens, but you don't have a legal entity around that dao. And we will see that the unwrapped daos, they have this problem that sometimes qualifies, simple partnerships. And we'll look at what that means for you as an issuer. But also, if you hold one of these tokens, the last one, yeah, we'll look at two different unwrapped Dao structures. So I took.
00:14:52.850 - 00:15:23.854, Speaker B: These are. I mean, you can make really, you can play around with it. You can make so many different structures. Mostly it comes down to these three structures that we have. So the first one is a principal agent Dao. On the left side, that circle, that's the DAO with the different people that hold the DaO tokens. And you see the dollar sign, that means that the DAO owns the treasury, the DaO owns IP, whatever you have in your project.
00:15:23.854 - 00:15:58.160, Speaker B: And the Black arrow there, that would be the contracts. So usually in these daos that do not have an entity around it, they have contracts directly between the DAO and counterparties. And that brings about these blue arrows there. So liability. And that can be a big issue. As you see, third parties, or the members of the DAO may become liable towards third parties. Now, in the second one, we have the social signaling DaO.
00:15:58.160 - 00:16:18.614, Speaker B: It's also unwrapped. You see it, the DaO is again on the left side, as opposed to the first option. We see that the arrows are a bit different. So. And the treasury. So you see the project entity in the middle has the treasury. So the project entity owns the treasury, the project entity owns the ip.
00:16:18.614 - 00:17:03.358, Speaker B: Project entity enters into contracts with third parties, and the DAO actually only has an advisory role. That's why we call it social signaling. So if the project entity wants to do something or implement a new feature, it can ask the DAO. You want us to give a grant to developer XYZ to develop this new feature and the DAO can then also vote on it. But the difference is that the project entity can still decide, no, we're not going to do what the DAO set. So that's one of the critics of this structure. And the last one, the wrapped out, you see, we don't have a DAO on the left side.
00:17:03.358 - 00:18:00.472, Speaker B: But the DAO is really wrapped into a legal entity that's usually foundation or association in Switzerland depends a bit on your needs, and the project entity enters into the contracts. The project entity is liable towards third parties and the DAO is simply an organ of that entity. And that's actually how we set up Dao Swiss. In Dao Swiss, as Flora mentioned before, we have the council, we have the general assembly, and we have the DAO as an organ of our association. And now for you, maybe important, because there isn't one perfect form for every DAo. It always depends where, if you have risk, if there are risks involved, what exactly you want to do with your DAO based on that, you have to choose the structure. And this here should give you a brief overview of the differences between, especially the principal agent.
00:18:00.472 - 00:18:47.866, Speaker B: So that first one where the DAO is really up on the left, and the other two. And as I said, the liability risk, we see it already here. If the DAO on the left side qualifies as a simple partnership, single members holding tokens could become liable for whatever happens in the DAO. That's not really an issue for you and me, I assume for you also not. But for big VC's, for example, they don't want to be in a DAO where they have this liability risk. Applicable laws and regulations also here, because if you have an unwrapped daO, people are scattered all around the world. You don't really know which law is applicable, which regulations.
00:18:47.866 - 00:20:05.126, Speaker B: And if you have a project entity that actually runs the whole project, like in this, in the social signaling DAO, in the Rep DAO, then usually it's a jurisdiction of that project entity and the laws of where that project entity has its registered seat that apply. And that can be an advantage because you have clarity sometimes, especially in the old days, projects outsourced critical regulated parts of their project to a DAO so that the regulator couldn't catch them. Acquisition, assertion, enforcement of rights that means if you want to raise a claim in front of the court, also there, if you have an unwrapped daO, it's very hard because who will go to court, who is the plaintiff? And that's different. If you have the project entity that enters into all the contracts, then it's clear who will file any claims. The opening of fiat accounts, I don't know if you have experience with that. Most crypto projects, at some point they need a fiat account. Also that I have never seen an open fiat account with a swiss bank for a DAo.
00:20:05.126 - 00:20:46.402, Speaker B: Puredao with the others. When you have an entity that runs a project, it's possible we were actually always able to help our clients to open a bank account. But it's always a bit trickier than if you. It's trickier to open a bank account for a crypto project than for a normal or a web two company. Risk of unfriendly takeovers. Also here, if you have the principal agent Dao, the one that has the treasury with itself, they make decisions on how to use the treasury. Then depending a bit on the quora, if you have a majority quora, that's required.
00:20:46.402 - 00:21:44.744, Speaker B: If somebody has the majority of the tokens, he could actually decide, oh, let's transfer the treasury to my wallet. And that is something that cannot happen in the other two setups, taxation with the principal agent Dao. Also here again, they're scattered all around the world. You don't even know which tax laws that are applicable. So taxation is not so likely that you get taxed if you're in an unwrapped Dao, this principal agent DaO. But if tax authorities think that you are liable for these taxes, then the potential tax that you have to pay is much higher because you are liable again for the taxes of the whole Dow may be liable, and not only for your taxes. And that's definitely an advantage of the other two structures and the level of decentralization.
00:21:44.744 - 00:22:38.026, Speaker B: In the first one, the decentralization is really high because the DAO has its treasury under its control, can decide whatever it wants to do, can distribute treasury, and in the other two, it's less decentralized. And I've seen many projects at the beginning they come and say, hey, we want to be as decentralized as possible. And over time they simply realize, okay, it's going to be such a pain. Let's be a bit more centralized. And usually it also depends how you live it. I mean, if you, anytime, every time when a dao makes a decision, you overrule it, then probably after a while your dao token holders will not be happy. But if you usually follow the advice of the Dao, then it shouldn't be an issue to be a bit more centralized.
00:22:38.026 - 00:22:39.014, Speaker B: Yes, please.
00:22:42.014 - 00:22:50.542, Speaker C: By the DAO in the trade scenario, like why couldn't you have a legal entity that wraps the DAO? And still the treasury is controlled by the bank holders?
00:22:50.638 - 00:22:52.670, Speaker B: You mean the rep DAO at the bottom?
00:22:52.742 - 00:22:53.422, Speaker C: Yes.
00:22:53.598 - 00:23:13.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, because in there the DAO is only an organ of that entity. So it will always be the entity that is the owner, the legal owner of the treasury. However, what you maybe mean is that the DAO can decide how to use it and that you can actually choose in the articles of association or.
00:23:13.504 - 00:23:20.504, Speaker C: Okay, maybe on the paper, like maybe on the paper of the legal body of the DAO.
00:23:20.544 - 00:23:21.904, Speaker B: It's like controlling the treasury.
00:23:21.944 - 00:23:27.624, Speaker C: But in reality, if you have something that is unchained and only the top end holders can basically vote.
00:23:27.704 - 00:23:34.924, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, you can do it. That's possible. But it will still be owned by the legal entity.
00:23:35.674 - 00:23:41.202, Speaker C: Yeah, but in reality it's like really controlled by the commercial.
00:23:41.378 - 00:23:49.082, Speaker B: Yeah. The control and ownership is two things, but thanks. Yeah.
00:23:49.258 - 00:23:53.834, Speaker C: Are you assuming that when you say entity, it's a registered legal entity?
00:23:53.954 - 00:24:37.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean registered, you can register, but you don't have to if you're for example, an association. I mean, usually, usually we see association or foundation. And it depends a bit. If you have a foundation, you take it. If you. If you, for example, are a base layer, you people that build applications on your base layer, they need to have trust that the funds that are in your entity are also used for their base layer and that your base layer will be there in five years time. Then they will prefer you to be a foundation.
00:24:37.174 - 00:24:52.214, Speaker B: Because in the foundation, the funds, they stay in there, they only belong to the foundation. The foundation has to use it for that purpose. And if you have a company or an association, then you can choose, you can change your purpose and do something else. By Lambos.
00:24:53.294 - 00:25:05.794, Speaker C: How would it even be possible to practically in your case, number one, for a DAO, which in your example, I assume has no legal status or it legal ownership of assets.
00:25:07.614 - 00:25:08.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:08.934 - 00:25:15.894, Speaker C: Difficult for an entity or an organization that has no legal structure. It can't even open an account in Coinbase.
00:25:16.054 - 00:25:27.214, Speaker B: Yeah, but it can hold crypto self custody. Yeah, but, yeah, otherwise, that's why bank account and exchange, centralized exchange accounts are hard for daos.
00:25:27.594 - 00:25:31.114, Speaker C: And lastly, the second case, so could that be for example, like in terms.
00:25:31.154 - 00:25:31.734, Speaker D: Of.
00:25:34.594 - 00:25:38.774, Speaker C: The project, it owns the treasury on behalf of the DAO, is that.
00:25:39.114 - 00:25:57.124, Speaker B: There would be then rather option one where you have the principal agent, you know, it is owned by the DAO, but the project entity would then enter into agreements, do whatever, but on behalf of the DAO.
00:26:03.904 - 00:26:09.764, Speaker C: Enforcements are possible with association doesn't require registration. So.
00:26:18.564 - 00:26:21.052, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm not sure if you understood the question.
00:26:21.228 - 00:26:22.572, Speaker C: Doesn't require an administration.
00:26:22.668 - 00:26:23.344, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:30.444 - 00:26:36.744, Speaker C: So how the legal enforcement work with association? How easy to open a bank account.
00:26:37.344 - 00:27:04.410, Speaker B: I mean, in theory, even if you're not registered in the commercial registry, you have an address. FiNMA will write, send you a pre enforcement letter. You will have to answer questions. They will knock on your door. If you don't answer them correctly, they will freeze your assets. It's not really tied to the registration. That's what you have a personal address.
00:27:04.410 - 00:27:05.050, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:05.202 - 00:27:06.570, Speaker C: Personal liability.
00:27:06.762 - 00:27:35.034, Speaker B: Yeah. And also the association, even if it's not registered, it has an address somewhere. Yeah. But also. You mean in the first one or. No, in the association, you have the association that is liable if it gives you protection. Yes.
00:27:35.034 - 00:28:12.654, Speaker B: I mean, the example you're talking about, the association is actually the last one. And you can choose, project entity can be a foundation, association or whatever. Usually it's one of the two. No, that was, I mean, the law was changed two, three years ago to make sure that that doesn't happen. It was clear already before, but now they also wrote it down into the code. And that's actually a nice thing about the association, because the costs to set one up are very low and it goes very quickly. And you have protection.
00:28:12.654 - 00:28:21.566, Speaker B: Technically, yeah.
00:28:21.590 - 00:28:22.234, Speaker C: I mean.
00:28:27.374 - 00:28:32.554, Speaker B: Yeah. We set up many association daos. Yeah.
00:28:42.574 - 00:29:16.752, Speaker C: Let's say a swiss dow. Two aspects, the governance aspect where you derive the taxes from. And so I want to understand how you think about it with a decentralized community all over the world. What do you think about economic substance? Is the tax being taxed? And also if it is taxed in a certain country like Switzerland, has a wisdom, holding tax on dividends. Right. Are you liable to that kind of holding tax? How's that treated?
00:29:16.888 - 00:29:59.934, Speaker B: Yeah. I will not be able to answer you the question. Nobody will. I can only tell you that the swiss tax authorities, they are of the opinion that there is no property on chain that is not owned by anyone unless it's lost. But they take a bit of position that they say, okay, but if it's owned by a DAO and you token holder, then a part of it should be reflected in your tax returns. But I'm not a tax lawyer. Yeah, sure.
00:30:02.854 - 00:30:15.878, Speaker C: The association and the DAO that is inside the association, is it just something that you call DAO that is organized as a DAO or is it a legal entity within the association?
00:30:16.046 - 00:30:24.182, Speaker B: It's an Oregon in the legal entity. So it's not a separate legal entity? No. No.
00:30:24.238 - 00:30:26.542, Speaker C: Okay. Just a design of the association in.
00:30:26.558 - 00:31:02.250, Speaker B: The status that you have. Like the general assembly is also not a separate legal entity. And that wouldn't be either. Yeah. You're very flexible. If you have a foundation and want to have a Dow Oregon in there, then you're a bit more limited, because in the foundation you have to make sure that the funds are used according to the purpose of the foundation. So you would not be allowed to simply put all the funds into the DAO.
00:31:02.250 - 00:31:38.432, Speaker B: And they decide then to do something else with the money than spending it on the purpose of the foundation. Well, you mean like an AGa or. So association is just the easier thing to set up. And yeah, we looked at it, we never took it. You also have the minimum capital, you have more requirements from the law that you have to adhere to. Either you go with the foundation or the association. We also set up once a cooperative.
00:31:38.432 - 00:32:06.404, Speaker B: But the thing is a bit, usually if you have a company limit by shares cooperative with dividend rights, then usually you fall into the category of asset token. And most projects, they really want to avoid that, because otherwise your token will not be tradable. Yeah, maybe we should go to the next part and they will be here afterwards.
00:32:09.624 - 00:33:17.298, Speaker D: Thank you, Romanti. So, legal advice later, but I think we open up for a really good now questions and a lot of people are asking like what about technical enforcement and legal enforcement, what are the differences and why are we choosing, for example, this wrapper? And more importantly, I think after one year of running our Dao Suisse, and we also figured people have different opinion about what is decentralization and how it is actually measured. And we found out there's not really a, a good answer to what is actually the matrix of decentralization. So that's what we're working on at the moment in Daoswiss and trying to form a matrix of decentralization to evaluate actually what the stage of decentralization we are and also where we want to be in the future. Because, for example, in our stadtuten we wrote how we want to be more decentralized as association, and we want to show our members clearly where we want to go next. First I throw this question also back to you. Please take out your phone.
00:33:17.298 - 00:33:57.554, Speaker D: Now swipe, but participate in my questionnaire. And we go to the questionnaire page. First question, is that okay? No, you can use a code too. Like you can go to manti.com and then use a code on top, like the 6919. Okay, no problem. Yeah.
00:33:57.554 - 00:34:55.136, Speaker D: Does it work? Are you done? Okay, cool. Wait a little bit for the. It is like the normal demography, right? Like at the two end, always the least. All right. I guess the answer more or less settled in. If you have one or two more votes, I think it wouldn't change really, our result, how it more looks. So one of the question we figured that actually people don't agree on is, are dao actually decentralized? And not just because it's called decentralized autonomous organization.
00:34:55.136 - 00:36:05.704, Speaker D: It will be decentralized. It's up for design, as we also discussed before. So according to this, I think your opinion is very much similar to also what we learned in the past year, that they are decentralized to various degrees. So here we also want to have a framework to see what are the degrees of what are basically this matrix of decentralization. How do we measure it? What are the degree that we are really talking about? And next, also, we brainstorm a little bit about what words come to your mind when we talk about decentralization in daos. Does it come up to you? Is it community? Is it decision making? Is it some voting? Is it token? What's your word that comes to your mind when you talk about decentralization? I think, how do we, does it go to the. I think it should automatically go to the next one.
00:36:05.704 - 00:36:32.776, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, perfect. You're not answering my question. Yeah. Optimal, tao, chaos. Interesting. You can put multiple words.
00:36:32.776 - 00:37:03.196, Speaker D: So, like, if you have top three words, you can just re enter in name only. Wow. Someone's quite cynical about styles. Okay, wow. So very little repetitive word. Democracy is getting a little bit larger. Okay.
00:37:03.196 - 00:37:22.334, Speaker D: We have chaos in the center. Great. Yeah. Which is true to some degree. I think we're trying to sort this chaos as Dallas. Yeah. And people like chaos, it seems like, since you keep repeating it.
00:37:22.334 - 00:37:38.382, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Transparency, democracy, consensus. Yeah. Scammed. Okay. Wow. All right.
00:37:38.382 - 00:38:00.594, Speaker D: Risks. I'm getting more. All right. So, as you can see, we have a lot of aspect to think about, and people have different understanding of what decentralization in DaO really relates to. Right. Some people relate it to transparency. Some people relate to democracy, voting.
00:38:00.594 - 00:38:43.836, Speaker D: Some people related to scam. So we trying to, I try to start to break it down in the results, basically. Like, those are not necessarily decentralized app for design. And it's all not decentralized in all aspects and not on all levels. So one of the example aspects that I took here to brainstorm with everyone is taken from the organizational structure that Florian presented before. There are four aspects that he presented as decision making tokens, communities and treasury. And as for a full decentralization, for example, let's set goals.
00:38:43.836 - 00:39:23.762, Speaker D: Goals on the bottom for decision making. We want to have collective and pluralism decision making, which means we have not only one authority, but possibly multiple authorities and multiple groups. And all completely like us, we're associations or I have literally one person, one vote and everyone has equal votes. And second, for example, for tokens we want to fair token distribution. For communications we want transparency, censorship, resistance. I think privacy has always been one of the major drive for web3 communities. And for treasury, for example, we want complete transparency on how the treasury is spent and even possibly more rights on how to decide it.
00:39:23.762 - 00:40:15.852, Speaker D: And in the middle are perhaps certain mechanisms or tools you can use tools to facilitate this decentralization, which are voting and design of tokenomics, pseudonymity and possibly of report. And so besides these four aspects that we want to decentralize, there's also degrees into a different decentralization aspect. So here I put in, for example for decision making, there are operational decision making which are day to day business. And you probably have the ability to propose, for example, what we want to do next as an organization. But then the next level will be more manageable then probably relate to treasury. And lastly, it's more strategy like the vision of the organization and really the highest level of decision. And this normally are, the deeper you go, the more centralized they are in a normal organization.
00:40:15.852 - 00:41:19.656, Speaker D: And for example, for tokens we have also a different spectrum from private sale to completely equal opportunity, a fair launch of token. And for communications, obviously there are two different aspects because one you can go for privacy, one, you can go for complete transparency for communications, for transparency, for communication. That means all your communication are public and you are public to all your members. That's the highest degree. But obviously that's up for debate and I will come up with some risk of that in the next page too. Obviously for privacy then there's for example CK proofed privacy, anonymous channels you can set up and also anonymous forms, tables that you give out to your members that they can make their decisions more anonymous and not linkable. I mean, having an address doesn't mean you're not linkable, right? So this is, we are talking about reading measures that to protect our members opinion and be safe to speak about their opinion.
00:41:19.656 - 00:42:13.240, Speaker D: And lastly, it's the organization level of transparency or private, that means you all working still like everyone, probably don't review their identity. And then for treasury there's also different levels that the members can influence from proposal to a complete open treasury. That's for example only on certain mechanism and automatically execution. This can be also possible. And when we talk about this ideology that obviously we want to be fully decentralized or maybe that's our goal, but there are obviously some risks to consider. It because when we, for example, I talk about when we say maybe we want our communication to be completely public, but when the communication are completely public, then members are probably exposed to information overloads. And then there's reputation complications on a lot of debate.
00:42:13.240 - 00:43:12.856, Speaker D: And that can also lead to policy hurdles and that can lead to, for example, like also if you transparently open everything, it could also make you competitive disadvantage against other organizations and also people. The sentiment, sensitive sentiment means that, I don't know whoever built a DaO here before, but for example in a DAos, because member is at the center of DAos. So its community sentiments are quite important. And this can be very sensitive. And if you have all the information transparent, it also could be that then the community sentiment become very sensitive and shifting all the time and it will become harder to make decisions. And obviously for the others, I think people probably more known the risk to, for example, tokens, there's market mutilation. Also when you have a completely fair launch, you also have to consider how do you reward the existing contributors.
00:43:12.856 - 00:44:38.818, Speaker D: For example, for us, we have people, people that contributed on different levels. I think it's also only fair to reward it in different tiers. Also for decision making. Also this is a known, I guess, risk to any hierarchy and massive participatory governance that is policy paralysis, which means that you can lead to a slow and long process of deciding. And this could make every decision a bit longer and make it hard to move forward as an organization and then talk about the tools and the enforcement of decentralization, like how besides this risks that we have to consider for decentralization, what are the really means that we can help or what do we do to make your organization more decentralized? So I see legal as an enforcement, since I'm from the tech and tooling groups. So I actually also agree. I do think in Dao, one of the, well, probably you've heard already the code is law phrases where in Dao a lot of people also believe that in daos we have technical enforce abilities, that things can automatically happen when you have a treasury that is self custodized and you will basically vote into split pressure and that's done like whether you have legal protection or not.
00:44:38.818 - 00:45:33.824, Speaker D: So I do think legal and technical are two different ways of enforceability, and technical enforceability are more on the operational side and the legal obviously deal with liability and accountability on a different level. And when dispute happens, that's the tool probably want to go like really large dispute. So I mean, I don't want to actually go through all of it. It's quite a lot. But basically these are the legal and technical toolings you can do for each enforceability of decentralization, for different aspects. And then lastly, I want to share with everyone where we are, as Dao Suisse, as an example, using this framework, for example, and then where we want to be. So the dark solid one is where we are now, and the empty ones are where we want to be in the future.
00:45:33.824 - 00:46:11.896, Speaker D: And you can see that next to each aspect. And in different degrees we put where we are at the moment. And as you know, we actually spent one and a half years largely was preparing for the legal, legal documents for setting up our association. So we have previously already a lot of legal effort into which is actually different from a lot of those. I don't know each if any of you are a Dao founder. A lot of daos actually start as just an online group, and they don't seek legal entities until they figure that they probably need some protections. And it's getting more serious.
00:46:11.896 - 00:47:03.964, Speaker D: But we actually started, we were very serious in the beginning, and then, so we started with the legal entity. So we have already our legal setup, that's with our decision making, because as association, you have one person, one vote. And in our stadtuten at the moment, we have all the, we give Daos the proposal rights, but probably not the decision right at the moment. But in the end, our member could come at the end to our gathering and still vote on all the major issues that's happening. But that's through kind of a formalized for line gathering and on chain voting at the moment doesn't count that much yet. And then we have, for example, token, that's where we want to be. We're still in the process of getting consensus from our community for communication.
00:47:03.964 - 00:47:55.034, Speaker D: We have a lot of anonymous voting and form set up, but we don't have at the moment, for example, more channel and more consideration on how to protect people's opinion. Because also because we set up as a feline and a lot of people, we know each other in person. This is also a difference when you are only a purely online community and a physical community. And lastly, so for treasury, at the moment we have proposal rights for our DAO members, but in the future also, we write in Shatooten, we want to be completely decentralized. So that's our, that's where we want to be in the future. And hopefully this gives you a lot of thinking and give you a framework to think about decentralization. In Daos and we can open up for questions.
00:47:55.034 - 00:48:13.134, Speaker D: Yeah. And that's our, I want to maximize it.
00:48:18.714 - 00:48:20.894, Speaker A: Maybe I can give you the microphone.
00:48:25.194 - 00:49:07.708, Speaker E: Thanks, guys. I'm actually creating an association right now with Michael Kuntz from your law firm, and he talked me out of doing a DAO because of the difficulty. And we're going to start using snapshot to administer the votes for the association. I was just wondering what you guys are doing right now, if it's just amongst yourselves voting in the association, or if you actually set up snapshot or anything like that and wanted to know. Well, you kind of explained the difficulties and I've been, you know, I'm going, my other question is, when you started the association, did you write into the, everything that you could do a Dow later or going to do a DAO or can you start the association and later just incorporate that things that I'm working on right now.
00:49:07.756 - 00:49:08.384, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:49:12.004 - 00:49:42.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll leave the technical part to you. But regarding the decentralization, yeah, we are very centralized at the moment. In the articles of association, you write down which body has which competencies. And we already took in that we want to decentralize over time those aspects that make sense to have decentralized. But still, I mean, we could decide not to do it and the DAO would be, would not have a right to appeal.
00:49:57.904 - 00:50:38.108, Speaker D: Yeah, we actually have a snapshot, but obviously there's split opinion on like on chain and off chain. I really like snapshot. We have a snapshot account and that's super easy to set up, but it's off chain. And also actually our organization also set into multidisciplinary. As you can see, we have different aspects we want to consider and we have a lot of people that's actually not really on chain. So even for communication channel, I was talking about like a lot of people are in slack and, you know, like are more official, are not really in telegram or discord. So because of this, we always a little bit hesitate on like can, are people like able to, like, there are people with no wallet in our association.
00:50:38.108 - 00:50:54.586, Speaker D: So yeah, like I, from my perspective, I think we totally should go for it and maybe even beyond like do on chain voting. And we're also trying to set up the token. So with the token, everything will be, the governance part will come in more serious. Yeah.
00:50:54.650 - 00:50:59.834, Speaker C: So if you set up a token versus an asset token, if it's a.
00:50:59.874 - 00:51:03.186, Speaker E: Membership rights, is that the same as.
00:51:03.210 - 00:51:25.470, Speaker C: The association rights who created an e commerce platform? So they'll get an entity that says yes, they're part of it and talk to. That is considered membership rights.
00:51:25.582 - 00:51:50.174, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I can jump in. So with the association it's not such a big issue because the association is not allowed to distribute revenues to. And that's why even if it's a membership rights, I mean, it was a bit short. It didn't list all the membership rights that fall under it. Otherwise the presentation would have been not so nice. So yeah, with the association you don't have an issue because you're anyways not allowed to distribute revenues.
00:51:55.914 - 00:52:02.854, Speaker C: Is there any good example of a down matching token that yields revenues?
00:52:03.554 - 00:52:24.194, Speaker D: Yeah, benefits. They're one of the most successful. I don't know if I can say that out loud, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah. FWB. No, not really. I don't know where they registered.
00:52:24.194 - 00:52:30.034, Speaker D: They're more in the US operating, but they started also more in the US, but they started online.
00:52:32.994 - 00:52:35.294, Speaker C: They didn't run any legal issues yet.
00:52:35.874 - 00:52:52.134, Speaker D: I think they're quite okay. They're more like a party artist community. And then they have a lot of offline events. That's also why the revenue stream is working quite well for them because they have token gated tickets for a lot of their events.
00:52:52.874 - 00:53:29.234, Speaker B: I mean, legal issues I often have with the clients come to me, they want to do something. I tell them, then you regulate it. They tell me, yeah, but other projects are also doing it. My answer is always, look, if you want to be successful, and if you plan to be successful, then at some point you will be on the radar of the regulator. If you're not successful, the regulator will not care. Yeah. You don't want to be a security token because then you can also not be traded on exchanges.
00:53:29.234 - 00:54:36.304, Speaker B: I mean there are several setups how you can do it. Either do it completely decentralized or have the revenues not from the token, but later on that you can put it into a liquidity pool or however, but you always have to watch out. So maybe do we have to? I didn't understand. How do you, what was, I mean, you can be anonymous in our dao, you cannot be anonymous in our association. So being part of general assembly would not be possible because you will be a member and we will have to know who you are. The whole dao token you can always do. And the second part was.
00:54:43.084 - 00:54:50.564, Speaker C: More than if, if you cannot have influence over.
00:54:51.584 - 00:55:22.664, Speaker B: Yeah, but in the dao you would not have one person, one vote. What was a VC dow, that.
00:55:28.604 - 00:55:29.344, Speaker C: Is?
00:55:39.264 - 00:55:40.884, Speaker B: Yes, we have.
00:55:44.504 - 00:55:57.044, Speaker D: Actually one of our member Isla, like also Ben there. They were co founders of for the window, which is a VCDAO, and we can take the conversation outside if you're interested in VCDA. I think we have to go.
00:56:01.824 - 00:56:26.924, Speaker C: Thank you, all of you, for the nice talk. What are the bigger risks? So you have a work now, but some parties may be interested, or in other lands, they don't recognize the quantity as the whopper. But just taking a little about.
00:56:28.484 - 00:56:35.544, Speaker B: I'm really sorry, I didn't understand your question. I'm not very good at hearing. I will come a bit closer.
00:56:41.364 - 00:57:03.084, Speaker C: The question is, what are the legal risks that we cannot. That one party, maybe in Switzerland or maybe abroad, doesn't recognize the legal rapper as the whopper of the DAO, but do some justice procedures against DAO members.
00:57:08.584 - 00:58:03.124, Speaker B: So you mean if you have a DAO wrapped into a legal entity, then I don't see the risk. I mean, if it's an organ of an association, nobody will come up with the idea to sue that organ. It will always be the association. Yeah. I mean, you have the same risks as in traditional companies. If a board member doesn't behave well, he can be sued, but he has to act not in line with the business judgment rule and not in line with the statutes of the company. So the threshold is much higher.
00:58:03.124 - 00:58:06.624, Speaker B: Thank you.
