00:00:00.680 - 00:01:27.388, Speaker A: So hello everyone, my name is Rostislav, I'm CTO of the startup called Asymmetrics protocol. We will talk about it a bit later, but yeah, thanks for the warm introduction. I will talk a bit about bridging traditional finance into the real world on chain, on the blockchain. So, as for now, Webster industry faces traditional finance in the form of tokenization of assets, RVA central banks and digital currencies, cross border payments, decentralized finance integration, of course, and smart contracts in insurance. So what are the benefits and why are traditional finance go on chain? First of all, it's increased transparency so people can see and check the money flow. They can understand where is yield coming from, and it allows to be transparent with your investors, retail users who use your solution, of course, improved efficiency and speed. So you don't need to spend a lot of time on different infrastructure, you need to just, you just can build your application on top of the blockchain in smart contracts.
00:01:27.388 - 00:02:36.588, Speaker A: And that's enough improved accessibility and inclusion so any person in the world can easily join your decentralized application built on top of blockchain. Of course, it's enhanced liquidity, it's 24 markets. Yes. So people can trade, people can do anything they want on chain in any period of time. So also one of the most important things is, I believe, increased leverage and capital efficiency. So imagine that you have a startup which tokenized real estate, right? And you have for example, NFTs, which represents part of the apartments in New York, and you can buy it and you will hold the NFT which represents the part of the apartment. But what can you do next? You can also take a loan for this NFT and your capital will not be locked for this apartment for forever.
00:02:36.588 - 00:03:02.136, Speaker A: Yeah. How it works in traditional market. And then you can use your liquidity in other places as well. What are the challenges right now in traditional finance coming on the blockchain? First of all, the biggest issue right now in the market is regulatory and compliance issues. Of course. Yeah. So it's unclear regulations.
00:03:02.136 - 00:04:00.776, Speaker A: So for example, right now there is no clear path how to really tokenize the apartments or any kind of real estate in the world. There is no way like there is no standard and usual and clear path to do it. Some startups doing it in different countries via different laws, but general scheme, how to do it, general process, we don't see right now technical challenges as well. So interoperability, scalability, data privacy. We are still working on the scalability issues on the blockchain. We still have a lot of issues and you know, the Ethereum roadmap and all of these things. And also one of the most complicated issues is to merge the real world data with the blockchain data, because we have oracles as well, of course, but they don't cover everything.
00:04:00.776 - 00:05:09.294, Speaker A: And still there is a huge gap in terms of how blockchain can consume the real world data and be rely on it and trust it. So there is still a huge gap, security concerns and of course market dynamics, volatility. Of course everyone knows that crypto is super volatile and it damages the reputation of the whole industry, unfortunately. But still we see more and more traditional finance use cases coming on chain. As an example, the most recent one is a Blackrock, in collaboration with securitize launches its first tokenized fund biddle on the Ethereum network. Defi Makerdao bought another 700 million US Treasuries, but it was the information from the summer last year. I don't know if it's changed or not, but the thing is that even Defi goes in traditional markets and merge on chain defy with the traditional markets.
00:05:09.294 - 00:05:48.134, Speaker A: That's cool. Decentralized insurance, of course, nexus mutual covered in total historically 4.6 billion of dollars. Right now, active cover amount is 62 million. And they paid 18 millions of dollars in like claims. And you also can think about it, because in traditional insurance you know that you like, you face a lot of problems with claims. Of course you can insure anything you want, but in the end of the day, insurance company will do everything to not pay your money.
00:05:48.134 - 00:06:39.020, Speaker A: Yeah, actual money, to not release the claim. Why? Because it's their money, it's their profits. So yeah, to pay you your claim means they will lose the money. In Webster it works a bit different. So you have just decentralized protocol built on the smart contracts with predefined rules, predefined processes, and there is no way for protocol to decline your claim if it's alleged. So basically the centralized insurance, I think super undervalued industry and we will see a lot more use cases in future whenever we solve the problem with oracles as well with merging the real data into blockchain. Also one of the use cases actually why I'm here is premium bonds.
00:06:39.020 - 00:07:33.028, Speaker A: Of course it's a fun way to save with a chance to win tax free prizes each specified interval of time. So they are coming originally from UK. We will talk about them a bit later, I think the next slide, so. And also of course real assets tokenization. I know some examples, but I didn't put any, because, you know, all of them are not super huge, just some startups trying to do the thing, trying to actually recognize the real estate, real assets, but still there is no clear path to do it due to regulation. So asymmetrics use case it's simply premium bonds and chain. Inspiration for the asymmetrics protocol was taken from the financial instrument called premium bonds in UK.
00:07:33.028 - 00:08:31.314, Speaker A: It's super simple instrument in UK they have right now 22, sorry, 100 billion in assets and it's used by 22 million of people. It's a proven success story and proof of concept. Yeah. So actually the idea is to allow people to save funds and to attract people for saving funds and actually in a fun way and not pay taxes for the earnings. What is the problems with the traditional premium bonds? Why we decided to go in this and put it on chain? So it's difficult accessibility. For example, for me, I don't know how to participate in premium bonds in UK. If to compare with the unchained protocol, you easily can connect your wallet and deposit your ether and you're in.
00:08:31.314 - 00:09:33.472, Speaker A: Of course, it's Yale accrual and distribution. Transparency, yeah, it's introduced place for the manipulation. I don't say that someone manipulates from premium bonds in UK, but still, when you can see, when you can verify all the money flows on chain, when you can see all the smart contracts, when you can see all the logic and so on, it's more, at least for me, it's more better to use, of course, limited features. There is not a lot of things you can do with traditional premium bonds because you have a law, because you have a lot of regulations and you can't play with people's money and so on. But in smart contracts, you have much more possibilities to try some new things, to add some new features. Of course we will talk about it a bit more. Your funds in control of someone else.
00:09:33.472 - 00:10:21.544, Speaker A: So basically not your key, not your wallet, not your funds. So in web3, it's super easy. If you hold your key, you are only the owner of your funds. Of course you have a risk of hacks and so on, but still, yeah, for me, it's more convenient to store funds via the key in web3. So how it works, it's super simple concept, actually, people. Let's say 100 users deposit one ether each into a symmetric smart contract, resulting in a total of 100 e's in the pool. The 100 es generate an additional, let's say five ether yield during the week.
00:10:21.544 - 00:10:54.794, Speaker A: Then we just distribute this five e's between several winners depends on the size of the pool and the size of the reward. Someone will get 0% of rewards, but he will not lose the body of his deposit. And someone will get a huge return. Yeah. This is the diagram how it works. You can see that people can deposit their e cert, let's say stake teaser or estate teaser. It can be any LRT protocol.
00:10:54.794 - 00:11:29.374, Speaker A: Right now we integrate it with Ethereum and kelp Dao, except Lida. Yeah, one week later. So we have weekly draws right now, one week later, we just distribute for three, five winners our rewards in the pool. So via symmetrics, if to compare with a traditional liquid restaking or liquid staking. Yeah. So if you want to receive the guaranteed yield, it's not about asymmetrics if you expect an APR greater than 5%. Yes.
00:11:29.374 - 00:12:13.884, Speaker A: The ability to withdraw funds at any time in boss and excitement from the process. It depends on the person and on the expectations. So how it works in practice, a bit more into details. Users deposit their stake teaser tokens or tokens to the asymmetrics protocol. Then the contract gives you PST as a kind of LP token. The cool thing is the smart contracts and on chain protocols like this, that you can then create more capital efficient use cases for the users. So for example, users get past, but still user can withdraw ether anytime.
00:12:13.884 - 00:13:16.044, Speaker A: And that means that then you, your PST actually equals to one ether. And then it means that you can use it in some landing protocols and then user, that means that user can sit in your protocol waiting for the draws every week and also reuse his capital in different places because he can use his PhD and log them in some lending protocols. We have already some kind of pre commitment of integration with one of the landing protocols. Yeah, next step. So the next step is actually staking rewards accumulated in the protocol. Yeah. Not only rewards from the staking, but in case of restaking protocol like userfi, when we integrated with them, we made the deal that in our pool users will get two x points of either five.
00:13:16.044 - 00:14:10.836, Speaker A: And that's cool because users were just earning points to x more than if you just hold ether on your wallet. And also, of course, whenever Eigen layer goes live and starts paying restaking rewards pool with ether and any other LRT protocols will generate not only staking reverse, but also restaking. Yelp is distributed to the user. So yeah, whenever we have weekly draws right now, but all of them are configurable. And basically when one week passes, then our aftertask on Openzeppelin defender triggers some transactions in our smart contracts and distribute the prizes to the winners. How we choose the winner? Yeah, how the winner receives the rewards. They don't need to claim it, they don't need to do anything.
00:14:10.836 - 00:14:47.934, Speaker A: The rewards just come into their wallets because we distribute them ourselves via simple transaction. So how we choose the winner, basically we use chainlink verifiable random function. We just do a request and then wait for the answer and then we distribute the prices. How to withdraw your initial deposit? It's super easy. You just need to call withdraw function. Yeah. So our progress and roadmap we had, so our product live for one year, approximately a bit less.
00:14:47.934 - 00:15:29.180, Speaker A: We launched last year we had 25 million peak tvl. Right now it's not the case. I can explain why, because right now on the market we see a lot of like now it's bull market. And we see that in pendle, for example, users can gain 80% of yield for their ether. Of course it doesn't make sense to go to something like asymmetrics because it just doesn't attract users right now in the market when you can just double your ease in a year. Right? So it doesn't make sense. But still we had $25 million TvL.
00:15:29.180 - 00:15:58.056, Speaker A: Right now I think it's 3.5 million. Still not zero even on this bull market. Also, this number is not correct. So now it's $750,000. So I think it's also cool that we distributed such amount of rewards. Yeah, we actually integrate, we also implemented some cool features like mini pools.
00:15:58.056 - 00:17:00.236, Speaker A: If you have not a lot of ether on your wallet and you still want to participate in the pool, but you think the chances that you will allow you can join the mini pool with others. And then whenever you win, whenever your pool wins, you actually get the proportion of your stake amount in this mini pool, which is also cool because users can play with the chances of win and the amount of rewards they can get. The latest news that we integrated with is our five is Kelp Dao. Of course, right now we are live only on Ethereum mainnet. But of course we are planning to also launch on different L2 because for us it's super easy and super fast. It will cost like $5 to launch on different L2 solutions. And the protocol, safe, sustainable.
00:17:00.236 - 00:17:22.210, Speaker A: There is no need for, I mean 24 hours monitoring. So we just build it and that's it. So it's working itself. Yeah, that's probably, that's it. That's my contacts. If you're interested in contact, just let me know. Thanks.
00:17:22.210 - 00:17:56.060, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Put your hands together for Rostislav. Any questions to Rosseslav on the topic or to asymmetrics? One more thing I can say if you. Yeah, you've got 30 seconds. Just go ahead. So, yes, I actually also have a community in Ukraine. We are running it more than two years and we are doing meetups, workshops, and we do some cool educational events as well for our people in Ukraine.
00:17:56.060 - 00:18:26.504, Speaker A: In Kiev this year, we do first time in history, ETH Kyiv this summer 21st, 23 June. If someone wants to join as a sponsor, speaker, or create workshop, you are free to connect and contact me in Twitter or you can come in person. I will be here still. So thank you. Great. Thank you very much.
