00:00:11.480 - 00:00:28.674, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Hi everyone, I'm Maria and I'm. Where are the slides? Okay. Okay. And I'm here today. I'm italian and I'm here today to talk to you about the importance of community building.
00:00:28.674 - 00:01:13.864, Speaker A: Why? So I want to introduce a bit myself and tell you why I'm able to talk to you about this topic. So, as mentioned, I am involved in the space since 2018. So almost five years now, and I was involved in the major, let's say, defi project. So Aave maker, Dao Balancer. Now my main jobs are Oasis app and spaghetti, the italian community which I founded with Matteo. And I am not a technical person, I am a marketing person. So that's why I'm here to talk about this topic.
00:01:13.864 - 00:02:03.984, Speaker A: Recently I listened to a podcast by Amanda Cassatt, who is the former CMO of Consensys and the founder of Serotonin. And this sentence was really powerful to me because it's really true. So while products and projects represent the bones, marketing represents the muscles. What does it mean? It means that marketing is just as important as the project itself. And it has to be very clear in the founder's mind, because if you just have the bone, you don't move. And if you just have the muscle, you also don't move. So you need both.
00:02:03.984 - 00:03:00.464, Speaker A: But what is the community for? Web free? Web free marketing is not the same as web two marketing, or in general other spaces marketing. It has the same, let's say, areas. So events, communication and pr, media, contents, campaigns, whatever. But there is a basic difference that I have noticed during my years in the space, which is community. And community building represents the roots to build everything else. And that's why my presentation is called like this. But there are different types of communities in the space.
00:03:00.464 - 00:04:10.892, Speaker A: And the ideal world is to have all of these types of communities all together forming your community. But let's talk about the different communities. So we see the builders, the community of builders, which are mostly interested in developing on top of your project, of your protocol, of your technology, and they come together as technical people, as developer. Then there are the enthusiasts who are really into like what your project or protocol can deliver and what is the final goal? What's the benefit for the humanity and the society? Then there are the users. So who uses your protocol or project or your service? Let's say, because there are also dapps that are standalone, so users are your community. In that case. Then there are the token holders.
00:04:10.892 - 00:05:26.974, Speaker A: Token holders is quite to me a bit like. So they can be like healthy, they can represent an healthy community or just shielders. I prefer the LT Token holders. And basically they are these people that believe that the token value is strictly connected with the project success. And then finally, but also very, very important, the team. So I saw, and I have been involved in a lot of different projects, as mentioned, and some of them, in some of them, the team was not like the culture and the team behind was not very healthy. And it's very like you can see the correlation between an healthy team and the success of a product or project, meaning that the team is the very, very core and primary community that you are building on top of.
00:05:26.974 - 00:06:25.152, Speaker A: So as I said, the ideal is to put every one of these people together and build your community. Finally, my presentation is very short and easy because I just have ten minutes. I want to talk about some tips, some best practices, let's say, on how to take care of your community. And then if you want to know more, you can reach me and I will also be happy to tell you more. But basically what you need, as I said, the very first thing is the team. So you can have either one person or more than one in your team taking care of marketing and community. But it's very important to try to have this person from the very beginning.
00:06:25.152 - 00:07:38.406, Speaker A: So a lot of projects try to hire, to get on board a person, a marketing person. After one and a half year, they already have the idea and they already started to work. This is wrong from my experience. So you need to have someone marketing community from the very beginning because he needs to be involved or she needs to be involved from the very beginning of the project and to be like very into the core of what you're building and what you want to achieve, to be able to pass this passion to the rest of the world. The second point is be open and patient. For example, this is a good example. At events, big events, when you have the booth and you are sponsoring with a stand, with a boot, you receive a lot of stupid, like not stupid, but a lot of questions which for you can be like, but you need to explain.
00:07:38.406 - 00:08:20.364, Speaker A: You need to be very open, patient and explain because everyone is welcome to learn. And we are a very small space right now and in order to scale, we need to be very not snob. So like be inclusive, otherwise we are not going anywhere. The third thing is developing relations. So go to event. If you can't go to event, just like message with people involved with other projects, try to do activities together, cross marketing campaigns, cross communities, etcetera. Finally, be creative.
00:08:20.364 - 00:09:04.734, Speaker A: So building a community is very difficult, especially when you don't have a token to build on top of the token. So grabbing people together is not easy. Try to be as creative as possible. For example, trying to involve people, users or whoever in building, in the actual build of your product. So asking feedbacks, making some incentives, campaign with power or whatever. And these kind of activities. And these are the four things that are most important for me.
00:09:04.734 - 00:09:10.234, Speaker A: And that's it. I think my time is over. Okay, thank you.
