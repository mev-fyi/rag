00:00:01.880 - 00:00:03.634, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Welcome.
00:00:05.534 - 00:00:07.438, Speaker B: Tokobrice. He's ill.
00:00:07.566 - 00:00:18.358, Speaker A: He's not speaking today, unfortunately. Sorry if you're here for his talk. So we have a replacement. Christoph is going to talk about crowd.
00:00:18.406 - 00:00:20.774, Speaker B: Investing with gmbh token.
00:00:20.894 - 00:00:29.172, Speaker A: Exactly. I didn't know that it was a last minute addition to the schedule. Sorry about that and enjoy. Good, go for it.
00:00:29.228 - 00:01:01.400, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So I was just asked to talk about this five minutes ago, but nevertheless I have some slides prepared for those who don't know me. I actually worked for the Ethereum foundation in 2014 with Vitalik and Gavin was the lead tester. We built Ethereum, we launched it. After that I started a company called Slokit, mostly known for the DAO. I guess some of you know what the DAO was. So I was the author of the smart contract, more or less responsible of the bug, my code.
00:01:01.400 - 00:01:39.924, Speaker B: And so this is part of the history. But let's go a little bit coming from that history. I've built something during the last three years, which I want to show you today. So if we really go back in 2013, I got into bitcoin and I still like bitcoin, even though I love Ethereum even more. But bitcoin was always about digital ownership. It's a currency that needed a blockchain to function. And now with Ethereum, we got a blockchain, which is really the application layer where the applications can be built on top, which needed the currency to function.
00:01:39.924 - 00:02:28.732, Speaker B: And if you read the white paper by Vitalik, and I think you all should, it's like almost like a prophecy, because everything he wrote in there is fulfilled, maybe, except nfts, he predicted almost everything, like from daos to ens to tokens and so on. And this is a part of the white paper where you already wrote as an example, people, people could do with Ethereum, you talked about tokens. So a little bit later, actually, even after the DAO or during that time, the ERC 20 standard evolved. So we had a standardized token. For those of you who have been around in 2013 and 2014, those who wanted to build a token created their own blockchain. So if you look at primecoin, namecoin and so on, Mastercoin. So they wanted to do something, they wanted to have a token, so they have to build their own blockchain network.
00:02:28.732 - 00:03:07.424, Speaker B: This was one of the first primary use cases of Ethereum that they said, now we can just use existing infrastructure to build our token on top. Then the problem was every token contract was different. Then we got ERC 20 standard, and now they had the same interface, so that all those wallets and later on, Defi protocols could work with them. But digital ownership was always at its core. So then in 2016, I did this project with my team called the DAO, and I don't want to get into all the details. You can read about them in the cryptopians from Laura Sheen, if you want. She got really into the nitty gritty details of what happened back then.
00:03:07.424 - 00:03:54.676, Speaker B: But what we did learn, except of the importance of smart contract security, is a given. We did learn that fundraising through tokens worked like a charm. So what happened afterwards? So those are just the statistics about 2016 to end of 2018. And this little thing here was the DAO, almost, like, not important anymore. And then came this ICO boom. And you know that many of those projects were fraudulent, scammy, and a lot of people lost a lot of money. And I don't want to, like, praise this time, but the fundraising process, that you could just buy a token, see on chain how many token exists, you can calculate the market cap, it could be listed on some decent exchanges.
00:03:54.676 - 00:04:37.400, Speaker B: This worked like a charm and was really, really nice during the time. So there were good learnings from that. So fundraising through token, still the best. But what happened afterwards? Sec came, Bafin came, and the German is Baffin. Well, those are most likely security tokens. So during the ICO times, again, some learnings, because I want to take you through this journey to know what we learned during those years and how this ended up in what I'm currently doing. So what you should never do when you have a company is having two cap tables, two ownership structures, because then an investor has no idea where he should invest in.
00:04:37.400 - 00:05:21.544, Speaker B: Should he invest into your for profit company, or should he invest in your token? Where is the value? In the end, the CEO often has a lot of impact and power to decide where the value goes. That's why I usually never invest in projects which have two cap tables, because I have no idea where the value will be, and I'm completely dependent on the CEO. So one good decision, those ICO projects in 2016 1718 did, was they wanted to have only one cap table. And that's why they choose to go with a non profit. They often went to Switzerland, created a nonprofit, swiss foundation, and if you have a nonprofit, there are no real owners. I mean, there's no one getting any money out of it, there are no dividends and so on. It's a nonprofit.
00:05:21.544 - 00:06:22.094, Speaker B: But this also means, and I think this was a bit ridiculous when I invested in those projects, I actually got a donation receipt when I'm invested into, in my view, for profit blockchain project, and get the donation receipt that I can get some tax deduction, because it was a nonprofit. So then the token, what most of the projects did, and I'm now really channelizing, there are many different projects, many different ways of doing things. But many of them said, well, in order to use our product, you need to have the token. We kept the supply of the token, and by this we have a token where the value is somehow linked to the value of the product. So this is how those ICOs worked. But they did not give investors voting rights, dividends, exit participation, liquidation proceeds, all the things a standard investor would expect. So they were legally forced to give the investor actually something very weak, just because they feared they would become a security token.
00:06:22.094 - 00:07:17.740, Speaker B: So nevertheless, we would like to give our investors actually ownership and actually economic participation. So this was secure. This is then security token coin came along, and there is this quote I like a lot. I use it in almost every blockchain presentation I gave over the last ten years from Buckminster Fuller, who said, you never change things by fighting the existing reality to change something, build a new model that makes existing model obsolete. And I think most of the stuff we are doing on Ethereum kind of is following this model. So, but what happened now with security tokens, they actually did not follow this model. What they did is they did leave all the contracts as is, and they just put a token on top, meaning now if you want to transfer ownership in your company, you would have to sign all those documents and you have to sign change or to transfer the token.
00:07:17.740 - 00:08:17.172, Speaker B: So it became actually more of a hassle and an added burden than making anything better. Second problem, I will then tell you shortly how we solve this. If you have those legal rights in a company and you have this technical token, there's a very high risk. Let's say my nine year old daughter is transferring the token technically, but she cannot enter into this legal agreement legally, meaning that the right stay with me. So, because if you in investments, you have something called an investment contract, and the security tokens, you always have to enter into investment contracts either explicitly by signing a paper or implicitly just by even more orally, just saying you're getting those legal rights. So there is a risk that those rights and the token fall apart. So with all those learnings, together with excellent lawyers for now only in Germany, hopefully later on all over Europe.
00:08:17.172 - 00:08:57.234, Speaker B: So what we started in Germany, it's why it's called the GmbH token we developed something that we have a token which always has the same value as an actually GmbH company share. And the next slide is this one slide that I put all the information what the GmbH token is and how it works legally. The rest is just some applications of it. So what is the GmbH token from a legal perspective? So you cannot directly tokenize a GmbH share, period. It's not possible. There's a commercial register in Germany, it's called Handels register. And you need to have a notary signing some papers to get some of it.
00:08:57.234 - 00:10:00.266, Speaker B: But what you can do is in English we say profit participation, right? In German it would be Genusrecht. And what we have in there is this profit participation right, gives the owner of the token the right to dividends, exit, proceed and liquidation proceeds. In summary, and that's a very important statement, every economic right of a shareholder is now also with a token holder. So there is no economic right a shareholder has that a token holder does not have, and they are giving out. This is legal contract or profit participation, right? On top of this you get some information rights like annual financial reports, plus I like to call it conversion right. Lawyers like to call it put option that you are as a token holder allowed to give the token back to the company and receive an actual company share. So with this, the only thing which is missing is voting rights.
00:10:00.266 - 00:10:49.624, Speaker B: So token holders, for legal reasons, are not allowed to vote in company decisions like who's the CEO? Or like which direction should a company take. But except of voting rights, the token holder have everything they need, all the economic rights, plus the right to convert the token into an actual share. And if they do this, they have to go in Germany to the notary, and then they become an actual shareholder with actual voting rights and all the other things. But for most token holders, or for most even investors, the voting rights are not important in the beginning because they only have, let's say one, two, 3% where your voting rights don't really matter. But theoretically you can get them if you convert. So this is what the token is legally all economic rights of a shareholder. Plus put option no voting rights.
00:10:49.624 - 00:11:33.318, Speaker B: What is it technically? Okay, in this crowd, everybody understands this. It's just an ERC 20 token on the public ethereum mainnet, plus some admin rights by the CEO who can burn and mint tokens if they choose to do so. They can have an allow list, but they can also disable the allow list, have it freely transferable or tradable if they enable the allow list. This means only addresses on this list are allowed to send and transfer the token if they want to. They can have lockups, so for early investors that they can not transfer the token for a certain amount of time. Vesting contracts mostly use for employees, so they have four years vesting, one year cliff all put in a smart contract. So with this token, you have full access to the Defi ecosystem.
00:11:33.318 - 00:12:27.288, Speaker B: So we just talked to PWN or Pon and how you can use this token as a collateral to give yourself a loan. So let's say you're a startup founder, you just raised a round, you're running out of money, you're raising the next round, but you just need, let's say 100 or 200 or five hundred k to get to the next round. So what you could do is go on PWN XYZ, put your Gmbh token there and get a loan. So and then you give the money back once you close the next round, for example. So that's a very nice use case. How does GmbH token plays into this existing or evolving DeFi ecosystem? So now a very important part, how do we connect the legal rights in a technical one? And here we have a very innovative approach. I just told you about this problem, that the security tokens you have, this legal rights have a technical token.
00:12:27.288 - 00:13:03.704, Speaker B: And if my daughter is transferring those, technically transferring the tokens, she's not entering into this investment contract. That's the problem. And this becomes even worse with Defi. Let's just imagine this token goes to the PWN protocol, then it's traded on Uniswap, had hundreds of owners, and then technically, I, as a new owner, would have to check that this chain of legal contracts is valid. There's no weak link, which is practically impossible, you cannot validate it. Every transfer of ownership was legally done, right, and everything was signed and there was no error. It's impossible.
00:13:03.704 - 00:13:48.758, Speaker B: So if you're using something which is super, super nice, and I think many crypto projects in the future will use this as well, developed by a law firm in Germany. So we are using a very old traditional law, which is in German called Auslobung. The best english translation is public award. It's extremely simple, but powerful. You can make a public statement which is legally binding, that you promise a reward for a certain action. For example, if I lose my phone, I can make a public statement that whoever finds this phone and gives it back to me gets €500, and I can make this legally binding. And the important part of this is only I'm signing this legal agreement.
00:13:48.758 - 00:14:52.658, Speaker B: You don't need to but all of you could come to me and say, I found your phone, give me the money. Or I could say, if you solve this math puzzle or find the next prime number, I give you 1 million euro. I can make this legally binding, this action as a reward. So if any of you does this action, I have to give you this reward. You can take me to court for this. And so now we're using this principle for the token by saying the GmbH is making a public statement on their website and our website, just a legal contract where they say whoever is holding the token is rewarded with dividends during the action of holding the token, whoever is sending the token back to us as a company is rewarded with this put option or exit proceeds in case you just sold the company. So all those legal rights you get based on a very trivial action, which you can only do if you hold the token or own the token with this, it doesn't matter how you got the token, you don't even need to sign any legal paperwork.
00:14:52.658 - 00:15:51.482, Speaker B: If you have the token, you can get this reward, because the company made a public promise to give you this reward based on a trivial action, which you can do, but you can only do if you hold a token. So this is now the legal link between the legal part and the technical part. There is much more to it. We also have investment contracts, but this is more like a second layer, so you're super secure, you always get those rights and you never have to prove any chain of legal contracts. So this is what we have developed over the last two to three years, and it is super, super powerful. And now what can you do with this? Well, it allows for continuous fundraising, you don't have to raise a pre seed seed ABCD, you can just say, if I meet someone here today who wants to invest my company, I can give him a link, and based on this link he can make the investment individually, next day, the next investment. So we have, I think made 27 individual investments in tokenize it on our platform.
00:15:51.482 - 00:16:25.834, Speaker B: There are now, I think 108 investments, or 107 execute it on the platform. And we have companies who just raise funds continuously based on the terms they currently have. So it's technically tradable since there's no notary required to change ownership. I like to call it programmable equity. So with ether we created programmable money. With this I hope to create programmable equity. So you can say if someone logged into my platform, I can reward him with 0.001
00:16:25.834 - 00:16:51.666, Speaker B: token. So you can create incentive mechanisms directly into your application. So it's one asset for all stakeholders. And this becomes super important once you see how messy gmbhs are. Like in often private companies, you have an investor with a convertible loan and real shareholder, an employee having a special employee participation program, visa or something. But they have something very different. They have all different assets.
00:16:51.666 - 00:17:42.702, Speaker B: And with this token, you again have one asset for all stakeholders, like the big companies do with stocks. You can use it for family, friends, business angels, VC's, community, customers, everybody. So now let's get into regulation. So not too much, I don't have too much time left, but if you make an offer to the public in general, in Germany and in most other european countries, you have to have a so called prospectus, which depending on your lawyers and where you live and some other circumstances can cost you around $100,000 takes about one year to get. But there are a list of exceptions, and those are the two most important ones. If you address only less than 150 investors. So I think there are less than 150 people in this room, I would be allowed now to give you all an investment offer and this would not be considered a public offer.
00:17:42.702 - 00:18:33.516, Speaker B: So this is usually used for business angels, family and friends, round and so on. So you don't need to go to the Bafin or SEC to have a private investor coming into your company if it's less than 150. And on our platform, if you're logged in with a company, you can create a personalized link for an individual or entity where he or she can close this investment. The other one is a public offer. If you raise only up to €8 billion per year, you can with a key information sheet, bass information plat in German can raise up to 8 million per year. If you do this through a licensed broker versus tokenize it, have a license under liability umbrella. So on our platform, you can do something like an ICO, just legally compliant, where you can really make put ads on there online.
00:18:33.516 - 00:19:10.470, Speaker B: You can have an invest now button on your website or promote it on social media and just have investors come to you. We have to do KYC, AML and suitability checks, but then we can let them invest in your company. So what are the applications to summary? So three main features and they are all live on our platform. Number one is private offers. So personalized investment offer up to 149 or less than 150 investors with predefined terms, with an expiration date. And you can just continuously fundraise using this. The next one is employee participation.
00:19:10.470 - 00:19:34.530, Speaker B: So we have done this with a couple. One of them is actually sitting here in the room, who actually is receiving tokenized shares, you just have vesting time. For example, four years. Cliff, for example, one year. So that if you would leave the company within one year, he would not receive any tokens. You don't need any of those complicated, either one visa programs. It's simple, it's liquid.
00:19:34.530 - 00:20:05.494, Speaker B: And from a text perspective, it's the most optimal thing you can do. Because what we do on a platform is we don't give them tokens right away. We give them the option to mint the token at any time they want. So we cannot take away this option. So they just can click the button mint anytime they want, but only when they push the button mint, they actually receive tokens, which is then a taxable event. In Germany, we say Zufluz princip. So only if they actually get the token, they have to pay taxes, but they can choose at which time they do this.
00:20:05.494 - 00:20:55.934, Speaker B: So this is much better than most of the other programs. So you can either they can do it early, they pay income tax when they do it, and then only capital gains tax afterwards, or they do it very late, then they pay income tax at that point, then after that, capital gains tax. So from a tax perspective, there's no better way of doing it than this way, because it's an option to mint the token. And the last one we just launched, I think three weeks ago, it's crowd investing, or let's say ICO, if you still like the term. So, with icos or with crowd investing, you make a public offer. We give you a link that you can put on your website, create an invest now button on social media ads or whatever you want to. And then if an investor clicks it, we do KYC checks, AML checks, some other checks then that we have to do.
00:20:55.934 - 00:21:37.024, Speaker B: See how much information he has. If he understands that he can lose all his money and all of that. And after that, they can invest up to €25,000 or twice of their net income, according to german law. But an important part for you as a founder, you can pass the fundraising. If you have enough money, you can increase the price of your token. If you think your company valuation has just increased, you basically have a continuous public offer open as long as you want to. So then once this is open, you can speak at conferences and just say, if you want to invest in my company, go to our company website and just click the button and help yourself so you can continuously let people into your company.
00:21:37.024 - 00:22:05.612, Speaker B: Okay, so with this, I come to an end. What is our vision or our mission? We enable everyone to become a co owner of a company. That's what you want to try to achieve. You start in Germany, the next one is actually Austria. And then next year after, we try to get to all the other european countries, because the legal framework has to be adjusted for every country. That's the thing we have to live with here in Europe. We don't have one big market.
00:22:05.612 - 00:22:37.052, Speaker B: We have just very small, tiny markets, many of them. But that's the work we are doing, so that every european founder can use this platform to fundraise. So in the end, I can just show you how easy it is to create a private offer saying you have two more minutes or so. Yeah, so let's do this. I hope the Internet is stable enough so I know I'm skipping all the onboarding just for time reasons. You onboard into a platform, give the name of the company and it's a sample project. They have not issued any shares yet, so you can here click on Create.
00:22:37.052 - 00:22:57.374, Speaker B: Create a private offer vesting plan or crowd investing. So let's create a private offer. So it's a bit slow Internet, let's see. No, I can't do this right now. It is still in setting up your brand. Okay, let's do this really quickly. I forgot to do this before I came here.
00:22:57.374 - 00:23:25.794, Speaker B: Maybe now it's a four minute demo. Bear with me. I'm just uploading some logos. Okay, here, basically I just pied Piper and do it really quickly. You have to set up your branding. I'm not doing it nicely, I'm just rushing through it. Now I have to give some website here privacy offer, an email.
00:23:25.794 - 00:23:52.170, Speaker B: You only have to do it once. So let's see if the Internet is fastened. Okay, now we are getting to creating the private offer. So I can choose to have a specific amount per investor, or I can give him a token range. So he can. The investor can choose. Let's say he can invest something between one token or ten token and 100 token.
00:23:52.170 - 00:24:12.490, Speaker B: I can choose stable coins such as euroC, USDC, or I can also choose simple bank transfer. In case of a bank transfer, I have to confirm that I received the money. So let's choose USDC. I can set my price per token. Let's make it €200. So this would mean. Or make it €2000.
00:24:12.490 - 00:24:33.132, Speaker B: That would mean he can invest between 20,000 and €20,0000. It's the range I'm giving the investor. How long will the offer be valid? Let's say for one month. Who is the investment for? Let's say Max Mostermann. I don't need KYC at that point because I know him personally. Then I am done. I see the summary, so the price per token.
00:24:33.132 - 00:24:58.900, Speaker B: And I also see that you cannot really see it, is 50 million euro. It's a company valuation. Because we know how much shares you have in the commercial registry. We know now your token price. They can calculate what's your pre money valuation of the company. So you can see how much tokens we take, a 2% platform fee with this. If you accept all of those terms, you should go on agree and then you get this link.
00:24:58.900 - 00:25:26.604, Speaker B: And this link is what you give to your investor. And this investor has an easy onboarding as this. He just sees the legal documents. Price per token company valuation, yes or no? If yes, he pays in stablecoins or his bank transfer and is done and you have a new investor. Okay, that's it. So if you have any questions, let me know. Thank you.
00:25:26.604 - 00:25:28.920, Speaker B: Any questions?
00:25:29.112 - 00:25:30.844, Speaker A: Time for one or two questions.
00:25:35.704 - 00:25:50.810, Speaker C: Hello. Thank you very much for the presentation. As I understood it correctly, you said that the legal link between the token and the company is the public statement of the company, that the token holder has rights. This and this and this. Is it.
00:25:50.842 - 00:26:03.266, Speaker B: Correct. There are also investment contracts. And then, plus we have what I described as a sloping, a public reward, which just makes it super safe in case you cannot prove that you have a valid investment contract.
00:26:03.410 - 00:26:16.244, Speaker C: So, but if I invest in the company and then they are sell the token. So the person who bought the tokens, they don't have the investment contract, they only can rely on the public statements.
00:26:16.284 - 00:26:17.024, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:26:17.324 - 00:26:23.264, Speaker C: But I think that at least under czech law, the company can always take down the public statement.
00:26:23.644 - 00:26:52.420, Speaker B: No? So two comments to this. First, in the investment contract, which is the old way of doing it, we have it written down that when you transfer the token, you're implicitly transferring the investment contract as well. And the other one is accepting it. But there are some doubts that could be invalid if, for example, children are doing it or some people who don't have the authority. So this is public statement. We publish this also on our website and with this it's also valid. It just needs to be published somewhere.
00:26:52.420 - 00:27:18.344, Speaker B: It's basically on their website and on our website. And so they cannot take it down, what we have published on our website and it is valid for 30 years. That's what they put in the contract. So every time someone bought the token, then they also get all the legal paperwork with it, this statement in it. So if somewhere someone has this statement where they said for the next 30 years, we made the promise to reward those tokens with those rights. It's valid.
00:27:18.764 - 00:27:19.604, Speaker C: Okay. Thank you.
00:27:19.644 - 00:27:25.344, Speaker B: Yeah, but again, I'm not a lawyer. So always ask your own lawyer.
00:27:26.604 - 00:27:28.404, Speaker A: Very quick one. We have 1 minute left.
