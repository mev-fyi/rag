00:00:00.160 - 00:00:19.354, Speaker A: Also means that we have nice surprises, like on occasion to chat with Aya after a few years that we've known each other. So thank you so much for actually making a trip to Prague and joining us for a couple days. So please, round of applause for Aya.
00:00:20.534 - 00:01:03.994, Speaker B: Sweet to you, Joseph. It's my pleasure. I'm really so happy to be back to plug since I haven't been here, since they've gone. Wait, what was it they've gone for? That was. It wasn't my first Defcon, but it was my first Defcon as an EF person. And then I don't know if you guys know how Joseph started. Joseph was actually like the lead local person helping us to run the Devcon.
00:01:03.994 - 00:01:56.974, Speaker B: And then still the Devcon plug is known as one of the best. Best. I think last year was also very good. It was very magical because of the city and also because of you. And then right after I convinced him to join the EF and he was helping the Ethereum foundation for a while when the organization was very not organized. So I think in a way, I hope you had very unusual experience at the Ruthenium foundation. And then now you are very established person, and then this event was only possible because of you.
00:01:58.234 - 00:02:02.534, Speaker A: And that wouldn't happen. I'll return it now because it wouldn't happen if you didn't get me involved.
00:02:03.594 - 00:02:57.144, Speaker B: Also, Joe Schweitzer, who is sitting there, normally he's also behind the scene from the. But he had to miss the Istanbul devconnect for the first time. But anyway, so I'm very impressed. Like, I was like, how did this coming here and then seeing this Paris, this looks like the best venue ever in the history of Ethereum event. And then you guys put it together within, I don't know, like we started talking about this and I was like, yeah, it would be great to support this part of the group, the important part of the Ethereum community. But then no one was sure how many people are going to show up. And then also, is there even a venue that can happen? So really, congratulations to your work.
00:02:57.144 - 00:03:10.012, Speaker B: But also this story of this palace, I don't know if you guys heard. It's fascinating. What is this? Sorry, will you say the name of the family? The royal.
00:03:10.108 - 00:03:22.744, Speaker A: The Lovekoz family. Actually, William Lovekoz junior has joined us for today, so you can then talk to him later. I think he has a meeting in the imperial hall and you should hear the story from him, not from me. Really?
00:03:23.164 - 00:03:23.596, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:23.660 - 00:03:25.636, Speaker A: A lot more detail to it.
00:03:25.660 - 00:03:51.526, Speaker B: This is very according to the story I just heard very, I don't know, blockchain place. It was speaking of the ownership of the registry. This ownership of this palace changed. But I heard they were against, the family was against this being controlled by nazis. And then.
00:03:51.630 - 00:05:00.010, Speaker A: Yeah, for example, ultimately, it kind of follows the entire history of, of czech republic as a nation stand and, like, how it, and I often, oftentimes, like, pull this story into the talks about, like, cypherpunk and privacy because it shows, like, well, even, I guess the ultimate moral of that is, like, even if you trust your government now, it doesn't mean that you are handing over whatever information, whatever power to the people who will also be in the power, like, you know, in the next five years or ten years. And this is like a very material, I guess, evidence of what was happening in the 20th century. But I think it's because it's magical to have this occasion, like, after five years that we met. We first time met for the first time in Toronto at Con. And I remember a story vividly. I remember meeting Yuan, the people on the Defcon team, and then taking a train to New York a week later when it was announced that DefCon is going to happen in Prague. And I wasn't actually living in Prague back then, but I decided to temporarily move back.
00:05:00.010 - 00:05:28.952, Speaker A: I was like, the message that I've sent to the people on the team was like, I love you. I'm going to do anything I can to make it happen. And that was the time when we started working together. 2018 now, like, five years later, basically sitting on just the opposite side of the town. So if you actually go to the balcony, you can see the conference when you were there. Defcon four was hosted. So, and I remember us standing, like, at that venue and basically, like, overlooking the city and basically seeing this place.
00:05:28.952 - 00:06:20.028, Speaker A: So that's, that's the move that we made. But five years, that's a, this is such a long time. And I'm very, very curious. What has, what has changed in your perspective? Like, do you, is there, is there some, you know, is there, is there some learning that, like, came with basically running the entire organization and, like, getting it from the place where it was in, into this setup, which, as far as I can tell, and, like, I'm no longer part of the Ethereum foundation, but I still have many friends, and everyone that I talk to is super happy about the direction of the organization. So I would be very, very curious to hear what were your thoughts in 2018 when we met and what was the most important learning for the five years.
00:06:20.176 - 00:06:40.380, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for saying this. Well, everyone is happy. It's probably, we always have a unique organization. Very, in a way, it's a more decentralized, not top down organization. So we have different opinions.
00:06:40.380 - 00:07:57.320, Speaker B: But speaking of DefCOn flag, that was when I started officially working at Ethereum foundation in earlier 2018. So that was the year. And then after a while, and I think at the Devcon, for the first time at the opening, I think I explained this view of subtraction, but that was without knowing how to explain that very well. And then since then, I think it's been a long journey, not just for me, but for the entire organization, people who helped me to get here. But I've been starting, I think I started to explain, I would describe the vision of the Ethereum ecosystem as an infinite garden. And then that's just like a, a lot of stuff, like, I'm actually from Japan, and then my original culture, everything in my culture, that everything is implied. So a lot of stuff like I did originally was like, more from my intuition.
00:07:57.320 - 00:08:48.073, Speaker B: I wasn't really. Intuition is something that's very hard to explain, but I felt the importance of, you know, communicating that. And so, like others in the team helped me to describe things, but this, like, vision of Infinite Garden just came to me and what is the best part of Ethereum to me? What is that that I want. I don't want Ethereum to lose. So that was how people are playing infinite games is the part that we kind of always collaborate together, and that really one is trying to win. But building the platform together is one thing, but also solving the problem together. And so that's one part.
00:08:48.073 - 00:10:01.364, Speaker B: But to run an organization, there are a lot more to that. And then how do we first communicate it to people in the Ethereum foundation? Because I'm not the one to make all the decisions. I shouldn't like, want people to be able to make decisions and also act on some shared principles. So we started to share our guiding principles, our long term thinking, and this stewardship of values, which we want to be a steward of Ethereum values, which can be many things, that is not like, that's not something we decide, but the community as a whole have this base values that the fundamental values that you believe we share, which one is most important, is really up to the person. And also another principle is subtraction. Like EF. It doesn't mean we do less, but ef want others to be the main, main players.
00:10:01.364 - 00:10:30.676, Speaker B: And if everything goes well without us, like we should celebrate that. So with that, we have to see where the help is needed and how the help should be provided in a way, like, it's more like looking toward long term sustainability where in the future if EF is not needed, that would be the great, a great thing.
00:10:30.820 - 00:11:39.264, Speaker A: Yeah. When I said, like, everybody, everybody's happy, like, I think it's like, it's meant in a sense that the people that I'm still in touch with, they found a way that, like, suits them, which doesn't always mean, like, necessarily staying within the organization, but, like, during their own thing as well. And I think it's healthy. And, like, even when I was, like, deciding, like, if I should, like, remain as part of EF or like, move on, like, I had my own doubts. But what, just like, retrospectively now, like, judging for the two years, actually, actually see that there's a, there's a lot of, like, value and power and, like, having, like, more, you know, like, seeds out there and, like, having more individual communities to, like, just like, spread and grow then really trying to, like, stick in building like, a technological organization. Because I think, like, at this point when, and, yeah, I would say, like, we've succeeded as a community. We're actually having, like, multiple client teams, having even like, multiple research buddies, like, not, not all the research encapsulated in Def.
00:11:39.264 - 00:11:46.764, Speaker A: And I'm super happy about seeing the client teams to have their own branches and to basically taking leads there.
00:11:47.784 - 00:12:30.046, Speaker B: Yeah. You worked on diversity project with EF two. Yeah. What you said about, like, for example, you started at EF, but it's actually even better if you can carry that, that the principles or, you know, something you learn at EF and then go out there and then let's build your own thing that doesn't have to be from EF, but there are people, like, you know, like, I'm not sure. Very impressed people from Argentina are here coming all the way from there. But, like, you know, we provide some financial support but also some guidance. Right.
00:12:30.046 - 00:13:20.954, Speaker B: Ideally, like, if they need to and if we can give some inspiration for them to run their own community in their way because they are the one who understand the local challenges and stuff. And then we're just, we give support if we need to. But, like, for example, the argentinian community is pretty established and then it's a great thing. Like, we, I feel like they don't need, like, we still give grants and finance as well, but they don't, like, they understand how best to run the community and then that's great that they're doing it that way. And so that's what we mean by subtraction, is that we provide guidance if they need to, but if they can do it on their own, that's the best.
00:13:21.334 - 00:14:47.214, Speaker A: I remember when my parents asked me about what I actually do and then going through the Internet, like, what's crypto? And so on, we touched on def and what the organization is for. And I remember my dad asking me, so how does it make money? Who pays you? Where does the money come from? And I tried to explain it. Having this dream job of working in an organization where your goal is to basically utilize the resources available in simple terms, like spend the money that you have in a way that once it's zero, if it's zero, you're like meaningless. Your job like is completely meaningless because it was picked up by someone else in the community. And it just, the function can be there, but you don't have to be part of it. And it always kind of made me happy to, to be able to be part of that because I think it's like fairly unique. Like I don't, I don't know many, many other places or opportunities to basically like work in that mindset where you don't have to chase, you don't have to, you know, you don't have to be pressured about, about like having economic impact, like, you know, making money.
00:14:47.214 - 00:15:11.894, Speaker A: But of course there's the, there's the other side of it. It's like, it's basically the, I found like working with DF more as a public service and then like, even though you don't have the shareholders being like the equity holders, you basically have the entire community. That's like watching, watching your actions. What's your kind of sentiment around.
00:15:14.314 - 00:15:14.578, Speaker B: I.
00:15:14.586 - 00:15:37.584, Speaker A: Guess, the state of the community today? Do you think like we somewhat achieved the community, like taking ownership or like what do you feel are the fields where you hope like other people from the ecosystem would like pick up the torch and basically champion a vertical niche.
00:15:40.164 - 00:16:21.754, Speaker B: So part of, I don't know if we, when we say we, meaning as a whole ecosystem, but part of things that we achieved or we accomplished, there's something like I am very happy about. Like, again, these local communities are developing their own communities very well. And for example, like Devcon used to be the only Ethereum event and that's why now I asked this question to our devcon team, or actually not to our devcon team, like leadership. So can I get some water?
00:16:31.934 - 00:16:32.834, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:16:33.454 - 00:16:41.634, Speaker B: Sorry. By the way, I took COVID test in the morning just to be safe. So I am negative.
00:16:43.894 - 00:16:44.794, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:16:47.174 - 00:17:59.506, Speaker B: The week in Istanbul was intense. So I asked this question to the leadership and like, do we still need Defcon? And if we still do, DeFcon has to be really something that only DEFcon can offer, right? We have to have that type of magic, and then we're going to have to ask this question every time. And then that's the beauty of this community keeps growing, and then a lot of things are happening without the Ethereum foundation now. So that's where I'm very happy about. But there are other parts of this glowing pain that the community is growing, the ecosystem is growing, so can we really maintain the values we believe when new people are coming in? So that's the. I'm not saying the current state is bad, but I think it's that natural talents that we are having, but also we're not even more strongly. And so we, as a community together, if we don't do anything, we're gonna lose them, is how I say it.
00:17:59.506 - 00:18:12.074, Speaker B: And that's where I'm trying to, you know, think harder myself that what are the things we need to do in order for us not to lose those values that we believe?
00:18:13.654 - 00:19:17.138, Speaker A: Awesome. I guess what we kind of schedule is for 20 minutes. I think we are on time. I just want to use the chance as well, because whether there are a few members of the Defcon or Defconnect team here, or maybe listening to this later, I was so afraid to actually went to Istanbul for a couple of days to meet them there because I was so afraid I would take the d six proud of defconnect experience as an attempt to steal attention from them. And it felt awkward because I know from the experience from DeFcon four how it just feels amazing to have the city that's location that's somewhat important to you to be, like, selected and then have everyone, like, the people that you know, your friends, your colleagues, to, like, flower and be. Fly over and be there with you. So I just want to use this opportunity to, again, like, thank them for organizing Devconnect because it was awesome.
00:19:17.138 - 00:19:34.584, Speaker A: I only had a chance to be there for a couple days, but I think the concept is amazing and it exactly shows, like, how it's just, like, experimentation over, like, how these types of activities that previously was, like, were completely covered by the EF. Like, can be actually handed over to other people.
00:19:35.564 - 00:20:01.136, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you for saying that. But also, you made this as not an awkward event. So that's where that was easy, but it was very sensitive. Like, even for us to how to, like, the. We had lots of late night calls before they went week. This was the challenge that we never experienced before.
00:20:01.136 - 00:20:53.326, Speaker B: But also, I really want to say thank you to those who came from the areas that the conflicts are happening. And I know it's not. It wasn't easy for you guys to travel, even because you have families who are fighting or suffering. And it's been a tough year for me personally, too, because I work closely with team members, you know, from Ukraine, from Israel. And it's very personal to me, too, because. So I hope, like, you know, like, whatever you are working or we are working on can really help the world, make the world a better place, better than now. But, yeah.
00:20:53.326 - 00:21:02.394, Speaker B: Again, thank you to everyone who are here to participate. And you guys, I'm just here to say hi, but thank you, everyone.
00:21:03.454 - 00:21:20.754, Speaker A: Thank you for doing that. Thank you again. Really means a lot to have you here finally again after several years. Now there is a break, and I think we start the programming in like, 2020 minutes or 50 minutes, something like that. So please enjoy.
