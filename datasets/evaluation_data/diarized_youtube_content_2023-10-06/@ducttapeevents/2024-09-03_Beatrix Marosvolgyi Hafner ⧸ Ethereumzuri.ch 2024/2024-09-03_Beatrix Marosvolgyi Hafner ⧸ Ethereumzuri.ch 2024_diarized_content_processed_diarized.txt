00:00:06.280 - 00:00:35.110, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm an economist. I studied economics in Switzerland at the University of Bern and Lucerne, and then started to work as an economist at the center for Crypto Economics. And I've been working on blockchain projects for two years now. So that's why I brought my background. So I think it just brings blockchain a bit nearer to people who do not know too much about blockchain yet as well. So that's a good point.
00:00:35.730 - 00:01:20.860, Speaker B: Yeah. My name is Mathias. I'm the head of the center for Crypto Economics, also an economist. And I'm here because it perfectly fits basically our interest in crypto economics and crypto in general blockchain in the ethereum ecosystem to discuss about that. I think it's very interesting because it's a little bit more. It's not very technical, but more technical than other conferences that have been here around Zirich, or the larger one, let's put it that way, which are often only on the surface, so they are not really deep. So from our view, less interesting from content wise.
00:01:20.860 - 00:01:53.496, Speaker B: I think it's a good combination here between technical details, but also connecting, networking with other people here in Zurich. I think it was really great. So we have been also at the chain science, which is a side event. So I think the overlaps were quite large. So it was difficult, I don't know whether it's good or bad, to improve that, but it was difficult to attend both at the same time. That was. Yes, yes.
00:01:53.496 - 00:02:00.920, Speaker B: So it would have been great if it's a little bit more. Less overlapped, but on the other hand, you just connect all the people, then that's the advantage.
