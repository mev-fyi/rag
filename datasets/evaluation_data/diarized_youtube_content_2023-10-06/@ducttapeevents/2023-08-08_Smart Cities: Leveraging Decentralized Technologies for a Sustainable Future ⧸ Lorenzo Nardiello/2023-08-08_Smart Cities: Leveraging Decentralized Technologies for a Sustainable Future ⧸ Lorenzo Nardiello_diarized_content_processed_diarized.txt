00:00:03.960 - 00:00:33.014, Speaker A: We can go. It's okay. Okay. Thanks for joining me. Today I'm going to talk about the link between smart cities and blockchain. So, the world is moving fast and the future is urbanized. In 2050, 70% of the population, the world population will live in cities.
00:00:33.014 - 00:01:43.534, Speaker A: And in the next seven years, we will see ten more mega cities. The future is urban and blockchain can be a solution to bring traceability, security, decentralization and transparency. All of these citizens will also bring a huge amount of data thanks to connected cars, IoT sensors, environment sensors, and their own utility usages. So gas, electric, and water consumption. Two questions. How can we leverage this data, and how can blockchain be a central actor? So in my example today, in my presentation, we will explore three things. The first one is decentralized identity, which is useful to identify citizens and to avoid malicious actors, and also useful to create a segmentation.
00:01:43.534 - 00:02:31.714, Speaker A: So you want to know, who are your citizens, where they live, and where are they exactly? Who are they exactly? Sorry. You also need a decentralized data marketplace in order for them to keep control on their data, to get more transparency, and together them around one platform. And as we all know, to motivate people, you also need an incentive for each of them. So let's explore the did. So here. I took an example of Alice. Halice needs to be onboarded to create her self identity.
00:02:31.714 - 00:03:48.364, Speaker A: For that, she will use a smart wallet, so ERC 4337 standard, so she can enjoy social logins and recovery to make it way more smooth than getting a private key dealing with it. And you all know the issues with all of these things. The second step for Alice, so now that she has this smart wallet, she can create an ENS so Alice Paris one, because thanks to the Zgate proof, the Zidki proof that she uploaded, we know that she's living in Paris first district. We also know that she's more than 18 years old, that she owns a wearable, and that she also owns a car. So all of this is composing the identity of Alice, and it's part of the hyper personalization. You can get hyper personalization using meta NFT. So a meta NFT is composed of several layers, and each of these layers is representing an information.
00:03:48.364 - 00:04:07.694, Speaker A: Of course, it's a saurbon token, so it cannot be transferable. The identity of Alice belongs to Alice only. So now that we know who is Alice, what she owns, she can start to share her data.
00:04:12.194 - 00:04:14.774, Speaker B: So here is the decentralized data marketplace.
00:04:15.314 - 00:05:31.304, Speaker A: Alice on the left side is sharing her data into data sets, so she can provide information, for example, the city noises when she's working in her city, her electric consumption or her car's data, for example, and even her health data, because it can be very interesting for a city to know if there is a pattern concerning the health of the citizens. Of course, she has the full ownership of this data, she can revoke access anytime, and she can get control, and she can also get a full transparency, where is her data, where it is going. You can also imagine community dataset. So plenty of citizens from Paris first districts, for example, can provide the same information on a specific topic. On the other side, you have the city managers that will analyze this data. They can create restricted datasets. So for example, getting information about cars from people living in Paris first district, it is possible thanks to hyper personalization.
00:05:31.304 - 00:06:43.534, Speaker A: You can also use confidential computing and SGX intel enclaves to deal with sensitive data. So for example, health data, you can do it in a perfect privacy way. In exchange of this data, the city managers will give to Alice a reputation. So this reputation is part of the meta NFT of Alice, it's part of her identity, it's a layer into the meta NFT. So now how can we incentivize Alice to do this job? Who knows what this is? Nobody. Okay, this is a coin from ancient Greece. It's called Perry Clay story used this coin to do what he called mistos.
00:06:43.534 - 00:07:53.964, Speaker A: So Mistos was a way to incentivize people, the poorest people of the city, to make them participate into the city life. So if they were voting, if they were debating, if they were saying if something was good or not, they were paid for that. So this is a way to incentivize people, the financial one, and this was probably the first ever reward token existing. But we can imagine several other things. So depending on your reputation score, and depending on how you're involved in your city life, you can of course enjoy financial one, like infrastructure discount. So if you are participating and you own a car, because we know it now, thanks to the meta NFT, then the city can reward you by giving you discount for parking, or can give you discount for public transportation, for example. And the more you are participating, the.
00:07:54.004 - 00:07:55.264, Speaker B: More your score is important.
00:07:56.164 - 00:08:57.656, Speaker A: You can get a higher power vote for local referendum. So let's say that your district decides to change the bench in a park. It will cost a lot of money, of course. So they are asking citizens, what are they thinking about it? Well, as an involved citizen, you can have more power vote on this decision, because you want your city to be better and better, and you showed it. Then you can access to strategic positions such as Thorn hall member, for example, and even a national representative. So what are the advantages of all of these things? Well, it increased the citizens engagement, so people are more involved, of course, with the incentives, but also thanks to the impact they can have on their city, the city is continuously improved and you can highlight issues. So politics cannot be blind in front of issues.
00:08:57.656 - 00:09:04.624, Speaker A: If you have 10,000 of citizens feeding a data set showing that something is wrong, they cannot be blind.
00:09:06.724 - 00:09:09.028, Speaker B: It also increased transparency about data.
00:09:09.156 - 00:10:02.594, Speaker A: You know, where is your data, how is it used and who is using it? And something very interesting. This is the last point, and this is where we can change things. You can have a new kind of politics. Instead of getting politics based on how wealthy they are, who they know, which powerful party is pushing them, you can have politics that have to prove that they were engaged in their city before being engaged in politics. So it can be, for example, a condition to access to an election. If you don't have a high heinous reputation score, you cannot go to the election. And like this, you can have only people that care about the city, and you avoid all the people that are just opportunistic or that are also corrupted.
00:10:02.594 - 00:10:44.754, Speaker A: So the good news is that it's already possible. So I'm working at Alien's block, and we are building two interesting things. The first one is the decentralized identity, the meta NFT technology. So we are able to create these layers that can include any ZK proof inside. On the other side, we also have datatunnel, which is a way to share this data. And we can also, we are able to do community datasets. So if you want to know more about this project, just visit it.
00:10:44.754 - 00:11:21.434, Speaker A: That's it for me today. If you want to learn more about it, you can check the alliance blog Telegram in live, or you can reach me also personally. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, we're good.
00:11:22.174 - 00:11:23.514, Speaker C: Any questions?
00:11:37.174 - 00:12:00.474, Speaker D: So my question would be, this is a little bit similar to the social scores that are developed in China. So are you using ZK proofs and how do you differentiate this, how you avoid possibly negative aspects that could be caused by this in cities?
00:12:00.774 - 00:12:01.990, Speaker A: So the difference between what?
00:12:02.022 - 00:12:04.462, Speaker D: Sorry, the social score in China.
00:12:04.638 - 00:12:36.690, Speaker A: Ah, the thing is here you can anonymize the data also. So this is also a component, I didn't show it, but you can anonymize it. So the city can only access to generic data and the reward is automatic, but it's not about doing some like having the police behind you and surveillance. It's more about participating if you want it.
00:12:36.762 - 00:12:37.970, Speaker B: That's also very important.
00:12:38.122 - 00:12:59.134, Speaker A: We don't take your data. You participate and you allow to share this kind of data or not. So you have the full control at the end of the day. And if you consider that this is not, that is not good for you and not good for your city or it's not aligned with what you think, then you can just stop to sharing them.
00:13:06.894 - 00:13:19.654, Speaker E: For the incentives. Do you think it is a good idea to involve, for example, the business retailers in the cities? Like, you know, I would be getting discount from the Starbucks or McDonald's and so on. So they will. Yeah.
00:13:19.814 - 00:13:23.142, Speaker A: You mean discount for enjoying retail? Yeah.
00:13:23.158 - 00:13:33.452, Speaker E: Like the business business would actually like to. Like to give me some reward for high reputation in the city. So they might be interested in like rewarding those people. Yeah.
00:13:33.468 - 00:14:10.244, Speaker A: It can be interesting too. I think it's a good way also to involve them in this. I was very focused more on citizens. But of course, you can open it to also retail. Of course. I think we are good.
00:14:10.544 - 00:14:14.080, Speaker C: Yeah. If you don't have any more questions. Thank you.
00:14:14.192 - 00:14:16.384, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Thank you for your attention. Thank you.
