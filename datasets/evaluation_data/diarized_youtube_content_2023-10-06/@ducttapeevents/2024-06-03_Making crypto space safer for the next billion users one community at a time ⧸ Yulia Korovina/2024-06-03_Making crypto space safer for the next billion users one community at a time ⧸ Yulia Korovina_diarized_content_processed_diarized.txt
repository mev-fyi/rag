00:00:04.840 - 00:00:10.942, Speaker A: Okay. We can go to the next slide directly. I have a clicker there.
00:00:11.038 - 00:00:11.794, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:13.374 - 00:00:35.620, Speaker A: Right. Okay. Yeah. Hello, everyone. My name is Julia. I'm one of the founding members of Biztao that aims to make it possible for people in the crypto space to come together and work on impactful projects they care about. And I'm part of the crypto space since 2017, and I've been through like really many things.
00:00:35.620 - 00:01:46.904, Speaker A: And during this time, I also been an active member of tens of communities and also was leading and developing communities. And this is why today I want to talk with you exactly about this topic, communities, because they're an entry point for everyone in the industry, and because they are so important, we need to make sure that this first entry point is safe and easy for everyone. And I think that many of you have heard this narrative that is common for the whole industry, not only for the Ethereum ecosystem, that we want to onboard the next billion users into the space. But the problem is that basically the space is unsafe. And we kind of making it like a real issue for these newcomers. And it's especially unsafe for newcomers who, unlike me, who is all in these communities, or many of you do not know about all the risks and the problems and malicious actors in the industry. And we have so many issues, starting from fake communities and fake users.
00:01:46.904 - 00:02:32.544, Speaker A: We have communities being manipulated by some people for their own profit. Communities that pretend to be what they want to be, but not what they exactly are. Like. For example, I think many of you heard about this story about Craig Wright manipulating bitcoin sv community to actually earn money out of the token price changes, or someone, Van Fridt, who manipulated the whole industry and actually get many people fooled. And squid games and many, many, many other examples are out there. So we have so many problems. And I think that we can imagine that basically these problems can solve.
00:02:32.544 - 00:04:09.528, Speaker A: And imagine if we would have some aggregated information about all these communities, including some information about potential risk factors in these communities in one place, collected from the first hands something similar to database, with reviews from community members, like for example, trustpilot review platform or something like that. And to basically make it possible to collect that kind of information, we need also to have in place some authentication system for communities and members. And at Bizdao, at some point, we actually decided that we want to create that kind of tool for the community and for the Ethereum community. And we are building proof of membership, or shortly, Pom and proof of membership have three pillars to make the safe space safer. Sorry. The first thing is basically proof of membership protocol, a decentralized token based membership system that basically help communities to register themselves, help members to issue their personalized memberships in the communities and also to validate information. And the second pillar is communities base that basically aggregates whole information about communities, including reviews of their members, including some potential risk factors that communities can have.
00:04:09.528 - 00:06:03.184, Speaker A: And the last thing is Substack newsletter that will be kind of a digest with providing ad hoc information about updates in community and some red flags quickly and easily available for everyone. And the thing is that basically it's not just an idea or ideal vision for the best future. We basically already did a lot of things in this direction and what we have done so far, we already built proof of membership protocol that is available on the Cipolla Testnet and basically anyone can try it out with a PC and just go and with Metamask and Sibolia Testnet, register their community and issue their memberships in these communities and manage all these. And of course it's blockchain based and we also have pretty big community base already and proven the concept of this community base for now and define in different details. And also we develop the better review process and user interface and experience to make it easier for even people who come from totally new to the space who can do it easily with help of Pom and yeah, so basically we do a lot and if you want, you can check it out and if you are interested you can just join our discord sometimes to stay in the loop or check the information or maybe get involved. And of course if you also want to maybe have some cool thing out of it, you can come to me after this talk and I will give you your personal nice name tag that you can use to showcase yourself and your community you belong to and you love. Thank you so much.
00:06:07.164 - 00:06:16.854, Speaker B: We actually have two more minutes. Do you want a really short question? Does anyone have a really short question? Yes, one over there. Let's have a short one.
00:06:16.934 - 00:06:22.154, Speaker C: Can we search for users on this website, someone to verify someone?
00:06:23.134 - 00:06:45.224, Speaker A: So basically, I'm not sure if it's that easy for now, but you can do it basically using OpenSea for example, because all the memberships created by people, they are also viewable through the opensea if you will, sort of by community. And you, you can check all the users there that belongs to the community. Yeah.
00:06:45.524 - 00:06:46.464, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:06:48.444 - 00:06:51.444, Speaker B: Thank you, Julia. Big round of applause for Julia.
