00:00:06.400 - 00:00:26.252, Speaker A: My name is Alia Dasgupta. I lead business development for Signum bank here in Switzerland. It's my second time at Ethereum Zurich. It's a great event. It's really nice to have a local Ethereum event. I often go to the ones in Milan and Paris and so on, and to have one right here in Zurich is fantastic. So thank you to the organizers for making it happen.
00:00:26.252 - 00:00:56.042, Speaker A: So I work with Crypto Mondays, Sirik here, and also with women in web3. I'm a founding board member at both. So I work a lot with the local community in Crypto, and I think Siric has a reputation for being a finance hub. It's very businessy. A lot of the events I go to otherwise tend to be quite focused on the business side of things. And I think Ethereum Zurich is one of the few events that's really focusing on the tech. And it stands out in the entire the year of events because it's like the one that is focused on the tech.
00:00:56.042 - 00:01:43.330, Speaker A: And you see that also from the people that you meet. I'm one of the fewer business people here, but it's really good to engage with the local talent, to hear what kind of projects they're building, and to hear sort of to bring a connection between the business and the tech side of things. I think they do a very good job of like, segregating the three stages and having different sort of tracks in terms of competence. Because the truth is, some of the technical talks are way above what I can understand, so I don't even pretend I can understand those. But the business tracks are always really interesting to me. I attended one on under collateralized lending by Wildcat that was really interesting. It's always a hot topic in the DeFi space, as well as IP in crypto from the guy from MME, which was also really interesting.
00:01:43.330 - 00:01:45.670, Speaker A: Yeah, really good quality of content.
