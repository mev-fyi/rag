00:00:01.560 - 00:00:31.312, Speaker A: Hi, guys. I'm Marek from Carmine Finance. We deal with Defi risk directly on chain. And yeah, I'm going to talk about insurance and the problems around it and how we can solve them. Before I start, has anyone insured anything on chain up to this day? Like show of hands? Really did. Awesome. Awesome.
00:00:31.312 - 00:01:01.632, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, there was just one hand for those that didn't see it. Yeah, so that's a huge problem. At the moment, there is very, very little use cases for insurance on chain. But before we get into the use cases, what actually has to happen to have the insurance, right. Have something that you would call insurance. One is the insurance itself, the smart contracts that would describe that. Another one is hedging.
00:01:01.632 - 00:01:44.994, Speaker A: The reason behind that is that it's very easy if you have very specific things that are scalable to do directly insurance for them, but things that are a little bit nuanced. And you can do one or two things of those. Instead of pricing those, you. You usually hedge those because it's much, much cheaper on your end as an insurer to do. Another thing is monitoring. Because at the moment, if you were to talk to DeFi protocols, quite a lot of them would tell you, hey, I don't want to insure, I don't want to hedge, and I don't know what the risks are. That's actually the case that we are observing as Carmine finance.
00:01:44.994 - 00:02:29.528, Speaker A: Cool. So what insurance does exist on chain, right? As I said, there's not a lot. There is niche market that is surprisingly big, and that's actually insurance of blockchain things. But it doesn't happen on chain, actually, those are legal contracts that happen off chain. And what you can do is you can ensure the security of your smart contracts. So you do audit, and with the audit, you can insure against hacks and exploits. So that's probably the biggest use case of insurance of anything on chain.
00:02:29.528 - 00:03:37.434, Speaker A: There is. There is insurance for real world assets, which is what Joseph was mentioning, that he ensured that his flight is not going to be late. So that's one of, I would say, three use cases that are available in terms of real world assets. The other two are insuring against crop failures, which is essentially parametric insurance against that, which means that if there's not enough rain, you're going to get get paid off, no matter how your crop was good or not. So if there is good rain, good amount of rain, and your crop fails, you're screwed, essentially. And there have been few ad hoc things that different protocols have been trying, as far as I know. So, for example, insurance against flooding and a few other things, but those kind of died, as far as I know.
00:03:37.434 - 00:04:46.460, Speaker A: Another thing that has been happening recently but hasn't received market traction that I assume it will, is hedging or ensuring against impermanent loss. Because this is relatively easy to do. There's a bunch of different designs how to deal with this, where we have our own two. When I talk to amms, for example, a lot of them, and I mean a lot of them look into this and they are just getting ready to deploy these things. But again, there hasn't been a lot of market traction yet. And so there's not that many use cases that have been or will be deployed soon. But what can we actually do, right? So one thing is to take care of the on chain stuff, the risk that you receive directly on chain, which means you can completely do that within smart contracts.
00:04:46.460 - 00:06:00.944, Speaker A: And there is kind of like the other side where you have to talk to talk to the real world, right, where you have to do either some legal paperwork you have to do KYC, you have to make sure that data you are pushing through Oracle have a secured data source and so on. So in reality today, there's not that many things that are happening behind the scenes just because all of these problems. So in reality, the biggest one that will happen soon is the impermanent loss. And companies are trying to push few more things, which is, for example, the insurance against delayed flights in Kenya and one more african country, they have insurance against crop failures, which in reality, the way this happens is that you get precipitation data through an oracle on chain. And based on that, you pay or you don't pay the farmers or the entities that insure. And yeah, there's not that much that can happen. Right.
00:06:00.944 - 00:06:46.820, Speaker A: So yeah, I mentioned the impermanent loss. Another cool thing is lending protocols. They face the risk of under the water loans, right. They don't talk about it a lot, they don't advertise it a lot. But if you were to look, for example, on Aave, I'm not sure what the number is today, but a few months back they had, I think, $300 million in a security pool to make sure that they can pay off the liquidity pools in case of under the water loans happening. But if you don't know what under the water loan is, it's essentially a loan that can't be profitably liquidated. And actually the insurance against that is pretty simple.
00:06:46.820 - 00:08:10.574, Speaker A: The only thing you have to know is the amount of the insurance that you want to buy and then the insurance is nothing else than in most cases, long put on that given pair, which means what you borrow against what you borrow. In few cases it could be long call, but based on the data, most of the cases are long put options and nothing else. And yeah, I mentioned those two, you can ensure, and it's been happening slowly against crop failures, and also the same way you can ensure against flooding, parametrically insure against flooding. You just push height of the river through an oracle on chain and suddenly the insurance is relatively easy. And now to the main point, what is actually the issue? If you look at DeFi, most of the things that we have are fully collateralized, which means that there is huge cost of capital. Yeah, that there is huge cost of capital. So imagine that you would insure against the flooding, for example, and the probability of the flooding happening would be, I don't know, 1% in a given year, right? So in 100 years, chances are your house will be flooded once.
00:08:10.574 - 00:08:43.222, Speaker A: So the premium you're going to pay is 1% of the insured value plus some margin on chain, because it would be fully collateralized. At the moment, the cost of capital is roughly three to 4%. Suddenly you're not paying 1% plus margin. You're paying 1% plus margin, plus the cost of capital, which would result roughly in 5%. And now imagine you would go to the end consumer and tell the end consumer, look, you're not going to pay 1.5%, for example, you're going to pay five. That's not going to happen.
00:08:43.222 - 00:09:57.290, Speaker A: Right? So cost of capital is a massive thing. Another one that was in the previous slide is that in traditional finance, these products are pretty complex, right? You have to describe them well. You have to measure them well. You might have to measure the events well. You have to price those well, and so on and so on. And most of the people, most of the developers that I've talked to, they tend to look at this in a way that they would kind of copy paste what is happening in traditional finance and put it on chain, right? Which means suddenly the cost of development, the cost of deployment is pretty high and connected to the cost of capital. Blockchain doesn't have any reinsurance, right? So what this means is that if you insure against flooding, for example, your insurance, your insurance company that you insure with is insured within reinsurance company, and it's insured so that it can pay off in terms of too many events would happen, right? So imagine there would be insurance company in Prague selling insurance against flooding.
00:09:57.290 - 00:10:26.474, Speaker A: Only in Prague, on Multava river, chances are, when the event happens, everyone is going to get paid. Right? So, ideally, this company, this insurance company would have 100% collateral for that. In reality, they don't. They have ten, maybe 20%, something like that. And they insure themselves with reinsurance companies that can diversify the risk. What this means is, and we don't have that at all. And we're not even close to having this on chain.
00:10:26.474 - 00:11:24.684, Speaker A: And in reality, what we could do on chain is that we would just transfer the risk. So you can measure the risk, you can estimate the risk, or you can have a market that is estimating what the risk is. And then you can. When you know this, you can have an insurance company or an insurance protocol that would insure you. And then this protocol would be insured within reinsurance protocol, which means just transferring the risk to someone else, essentially a risk of risk onto someone else. And what this would mean is that within the reinsurance company, the diversification is big enough so that they don't have to have full collateral against everything. And then your insurance company, because it's insured, that doesn't have to have full collateral, which means cost of capital goes down and cost of the insurance goes down.
00:11:24.684 - 00:12:22.222, Speaker A: Actually, this is equivalent to the traditional finance, but we're not even close to that, to be honest. We need that, and we will need that, because if Defi. For DeFi to compete with traditional finance without this, without removing the cost of capital, it's not going to be competitive, at least for like a normal person that doesn't care about blockchain at all, which is most of the world, right? Yeah. So there is quite a lot of opportunities that can happen. Reinsurance companies are insanely big, right? There's not a lot of them. The insurance itself, since very, very few protocols are doing that, it's essentially open market. And insurance market in traditional world is huge, as you probably know.
00:12:22.222 - 00:12:33.454, Speaker A: So there's a lot of opportunities and. Yeah, that's what I wanted to go through and. Yeah. Questions, please. Thanks.
00:12:37.234 - 00:12:43.654, Speaker B: When you mentioned risks, isn't it a finally use case for the prediction markets?
00:12:46.234 - 00:13:29.454, Speaker A: Yeah, it actually is. So one of the things that we do is we have implemented options. Amm, in reality, what this means for us, as Carmine, is that we look at options as if statements, and any insurance is essentially, if statement, if stuff happens until some maturity, you're going to get paid off. Options are nothing else. You just replace the part of the what if? Instead of if price is higher or lower, you're going to go if there is more water in the river or if there is less rain. Right. And the AMm actually works kind of like the prediction market.
00:13:30.274 - 00:13:34.774, Speaker B: One related question is how do you deal there with the oracle problems?
00:13:36.754 - 00:14:23.446, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a bunch of different ways how to do that and like to be full on is this could be very, very long answer. So in case of carmine, we have an oracle just for the underlying price or the underlying value. So for example, if it's options for, if versus USD, we look at the spot market of ETH versus USD, and then the volatility parameter that we use in moves up or down based on the realized market supply or demand. Right. So if someone buys it, moves the price up, and we do that through moving the volatility up. If someone sells it should move the price down.
00:14:23.446 - 00:14:49.284, Speaker A: And we do that through moving the volatility down. Right. So we use the spot market, which is very well used across different protocols in terms of the. And then it gets. There are different designs. Obviously there are option amms that, or use the volatility or price of the options directly from an oracle. Then you have a problem of mispricing and blah, blah, blah.
00:14:49.284 - 00:15:28.912, Speaker A: And there is one more problem with real world assets where essentially, imagine you would have the case of insurance against flooding in Prague. Right? So you would want to query the height of the river from some endpoint. Now, what you have to make, what you have to make sure happens is that that endpoint is secure, which today, how do you do that? It's not probably. And how do you do that? You have to have some certification around it. You have to have it deployed on multiple sources by multiple parties and so on and so on. And it could go on. The answer could go on.
00:15:28.912 - 00:15:40.584, Speaker A: So just very briefly, a bunch of different problems. We at the moment, like us, we look at some specific things and, yeah, that's how we deal with them. Yep.
00:15:42.644 - 00:15:48.184, Speaker B: Hi, thank you for the presentation. First of all, do you run your own oracles or do you use some third party?
00:15:48.524 - 00:16:15.364, Speaker A: Yes. So us as a company, we just implement the code base and the protocols is run by decentralized entity, by the way, connected to the talk. That was the first one. That's how we do things. And we don't have a controlling part over the protocol. We have at the moment roughly one third of the votes. So, yeah, that's how we do it.
00:16:15.944 - 00:16:16.520, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:16.592 - 00:16:17.204, Speaker A: And.
00:16:19.544 - 00:16:32.750, Speaker B: Putting the information regarding flooding onchain, for example, could it be that the source is trusted? But you could have decentralized court like Kleros at the top of it where a user could dispute the decision.
00:16:32.902 - 00:17:09.618, Speaker A: Yeah, that would have to happen because we can't guarantee that the Oracle is correct. So how we do things now for the crypto assets is that once the option matures, immediately after that, you can get your money out with real world assets. What you would do is there would be, for example, a week till you could get your money out after maturity, so that there would be period where someone could come in and dispute, say, hey, this is wrong. Right? The oracle was hacked, for example.
00:17:09.706 - 00:17:11.774, Speaker B: Do you have solution for that already in place?
00:17:14.394 - 00:17:52.534, Speaker A: Short answer is yes, we can do this, but we have to have a few things. One is the security on the endpoint site. Then we have to convince oracles to provide the data, which would be, I don't know, ten minutes of convincing for us, and on their side, a few hours of implementation. That's what we need. And then we would have to put in the delay for getting the money out, which again is, I don't know, one to or three lines of code into the protocol, which in reality would mean, I don't know, week till it would be approved by the governance. Okay, thank you. Yeah, welcome.
00:17:52.534 - 00:18:13.304, Speaker A: Just one more thing to this. We wanted to do this very, very early on, but the market is far from ready for this. So when we were discussing this, everyone said, hey, not interested. Yeah. And it would be way more expensive than you going to a traditional, traditional insurance company. Cool.
