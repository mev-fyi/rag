00:00:01.240 - 00:00:35.714, Speaker A: Hello. Sorry. Are you good? All right, we will maybe give it two minutes so that people filter in, and then I will start. For now, we have a little poem on the screen that you can read if you want to be here. We're going to do a very participatory kind of thing. If you don't feel like being heavily involved in talking with other people, then it's maybe not such a good idea. Thank you so much.
00:00:35.714 - 00:00:54.074, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, it's cool if the crew wants to participate. That's actually like the most fun. Fantastic. Okay. Right. In that.
00:00:54.074 - 00:01:31.804, Speaker A: In that case, welcome. Welcome. Right, so this is not a presentation, really. It's an excuse to host conversations. I really don't like the setup of having everybody in roles facing one direction, and then one person on stage was like, I'm the authority and you need to listen to me because this is antithetical to the technology that we actually build, which is peer to peer. And if we had to draw it, it would be some kind of circle. It would not be rows.
00:01:31.804 - 00:02:19.256, Speaker A: So we are going to get into small circles in a moment. Let me say some words and then we'll. Because what we really want to do is a participatory. Get into your own circles of four or five people, which we'll do in a moment, I promise. But in order to set that up, I do want to say some words just to give you a sense of who I am and where all of this stuff comes from. I have been doing education, technical education in particular, for about a decade now, and I have some thoughts about how that should happen, as opposed to presentations where I'm the person who's the one who's knowledgeable in the authority, and you are the people who ought to be listening. That's very strange, because particularly in these kinds of environments.
00:02:19.256 - 00:03:07.140, Speaker A: In fact, it's the people in the audience who hold much of the knowledge. It's not really the people on stage who are just pretending to know something and might have done one or two things in their lives. So what we do is we host these dialogues. I will tell you a little bit about who we are, but the primary method that we're interested in when learning about any of the technologies that we're actually building in places like this is something called socratic dialogue. Right? We get together in groups of three to five people in intimate settings to discuss topics that merge the technical and the personal. So, for instance, trust an amazing topic to dive into. Technically, you can talk endlessly about byzantine fault tolerance, about pub sub, about all sorts of technical methods of ensuring trust in distributed networks.
00:03:07.140 - 00:03:48.380, Speaker A: You can also talk about what it feels like to have your trust broken. Where does it feel in the body? What was it like that time the girl crushed your heart? These things are equally valid. And in fact, when we allow for the space to talk about both of these rather different understandings of trust, and in fact, they have two different roots, right? The one is very tough. When we're building technical systems, we're interested in their verifiability. When we're thinking about what trust feels like, we're interested in trajsta. Right? Foundational feeling of solidity. Right? And we need to host conversations that sort of do this, right? So today we're going to talk about meaning and freedom, because we're in parallel.
00:03:48.380 - 00:04:10.976, Speaker A: Nipolis, right? It's all about what is the meaning of freedom. This is what this whole institute of crypto anarchy is about. The name itself is a trick, right? It's here to test if you're just here for the vibes or if you're really an anarchist. Do you want to join in the institute? Come and buy a hoodie. Okay, so we're going to do meaning and freedom. We'll do it in two separate things. We'll have a music break in between.
00:04:10.976 - 00:04:38.406, Speaker A: It'll be a lot of fun. The idea is that I will tell you just a little bit about what kernel is. I will then set the context for the discussions that we have. I will tell you a little bit about the posts that we base these discussions around, and then I will give you kind of questions that you may or may not use for the discussion that you have with people around you about meaning and freedom. We'll leave the questions up so that you can refer to them. They're there just as prompts to conversation. Right.
00:04:38.406 - 00:04:56.678, Speaker A: Um, so, very, very quickly, who is colonel? Well, we're a community of people who's committed to learning together, and we do that following two very, very simple principles. The one is do no harm, ahimsa. It's very old. It's not ours. All of this is stolen. None of it is copyrighted. Please feel free to steal it yourself.
00:04:56.678 - 00:05:16.774, Speaker A: The other is play infinitely, do no harm. It can be a little bit dogmatic and a little bit boring. Play infinitely is the other side of it. It's what keeps things in balance. Right. And primarily when we're learning together, when we're doing this kind of peer to peer work, what we're primarily interested in is balance. We're not interested in dogma.
00:05:16.774 - 00:06:05.220, Speaker A: We're not interested in ideology, we're not interested in theory, we're interested in the practice of living well with one another, which means to live in balance, right? Everything is very simple. There's some other things, nice words on the screen about sort of what we aspire to, right? These are not principles, these are really aspirations. We aspire to be humble because it's really through our experience of both joy and sorrow that we find our way towards more open hearted ways of living and relating with one another and with the systems that we build. We aspire to be honest. It's probably like the biggest one for me personally. It doesn't have to be the biggest for you, but this is the most direct route between head and heart. When you're really honest about who you are and what you're doing in the world, you have much more wholesome relationships, you build much more interesting things.
00:06:05.220 - 00:06:33.546, Speaker A: You can tell somebody who's honest, it's very easy, you just have to pay attention. It radiates, it's magnetic. Somebody who's honest is not out there trying to bullshit you about the next token standard or what they can do with a particular piece of technology. They're trying to relate to you from the heart, they're listening to you, they're thinking deeply about what it is they're building. We're grateful because there's no other choice. If you live an examined life, who gave you this life? We intend to serve and we're very patient. That's the other point.
00:06:33.546 - 00:07:06.916, Speaker A: It's nice to have these kinds of conversations because it opens up the space. You don't have to feel like you have to learn something being crammed down your throat the whole time. You can just be with other people, which is like the easiest way to learn together and to learn lessons that last a lifetime. Particularly when you talk about blockchains. Everybody's always going on about immutability. These things are going to be here for seven generations or more. What does that mean in terms of the personal psychology that we apply to thinking about these tools and the work that we do with them doesn't mean that we have a lot of time.
00:07:06.916 - 00:07:36.952, Speaker A: Does it really mean that your deadline next Monday matters? Do you have to ship that code or can you take another week, given that it's going to be there forever? Patience. In Islam, I don't know if anybody knows this. The 99 names of God, the last one. Asabur. Patience. Why is it last on the list? A because it takes a long ass time to read the list, particularly if you're singing it. But b, because patience in this world is the reflection of timelessness, right.
00:07:36.952 - 00:08:10.744, Speaker A: You know that time is just another. Well, you know, we can get into that in conversation. I've already said socratic dialogue is what we're going to do here today. We're going to get into groups of three or four. We're going to have conversations about meaning and freedom and the like. One other thing to say about kernel is that we operate in this place of tension and contradiction, right? Which is where all really fruitful dialogue actually takes place. We're not here to give each other cute one line answers about what this stuff is, right? Like, meaning and freedom are very, very deep and difficult topics.
00:08:10.744 - 00:08:30.264, Speaker A: It's not like you're supposed to come up with the answers here. Just as colonel, we've been operating for a long time. We have no answers to these particular questions which are implied on the screen. We love free and open educational environments. It's what we want. It's what we try to build. The syllabus that we use is there, and it's freely accessible to everyone.
00:08:30.264 - 00:09:10.462, Speaker A: But in order to do that, we need to have these personalized and highly curated conversations. And there's a huge tension in that, right? Like, how do you open everything and make it free to everybody who wants to be educated or who wants to learn something and yet have conversations that are curated, personalized, bespoke, that offer the kind of space for trust and vulnerability that leads to real learning. Something that we're still trying to figure out. Because we don't have the answers. No one does. I hate to break it to you. Okay, so meaning, right? What is meaning? Where does it come from? Have you watched v for vendetta? Because that's where that quote comes from.
00:09:10.462 - 00:09:45.708, Speaker A: So I can tell you one thing, at least, which is the source of a quote. Not much more about meaning, but words offer the means to meaning. And for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. When the baton may be used in lieu of conversation. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. So there is a whole post about this on kernel. I've pulled out just the most relevant aspects of it to kind of set the grounds for a discussion about what is meaning and how is it generated, what is meaningful about the tools that we get to build with.
00:09:45.708 - 00:10:27.678, Speaker A: Why are you here? Do you really care about the deep? Why is really what we're after in these kinds of conversations? Why does it matter? Why spend time over a weekend in Prague when you could be somewhere else doing something else. Why be here? This post, it says a few important things. The first is that we have the ability to make meaning. That's always been the case. Words offer the means to meaning. It's always been through language and linguistic tools that we can construct meaning one among the other. Who gets to decide on the meaning of words? No one, right? They're decided through common use.
00:10:27.678 - 00:11:16.134, Speaker A: Just like who gets to decide on the order of transactions? No one. If you're participating fully in the network, you get to find a block, and you can order that in whichever way you want. So what is the meaning of things? It's always common use. Language is in fact the first decentralized network, right? That's like architecturally, logically, in all the ways that you can cut it. Language is the first decentralized network because nobody gets to decide upon the meanings of words. The only counterexample that exists to this is the immortals in France, which is a group of 24 people who do apparently get to decide upon the meanings of words, which is like another interesting historical twist. But it's not exactly true, because they there's still common usage in France which roots around that elite institution.
00:11:16.134 - 00:12:18.112, Speaker A: The post also talks about GPG or PGP and Phil Zimmerman, and the fact that the battle for meaning is no longer really conducted at the level of natural language. In fact, there's a really famous movie online that's called good copy, bad copy. It's kind of about PGP and encryption and cryptography in general. It makes the point that the documents in 2007, which was at the heart of the fight for liberty, was not some kind of declaration of independence or some particular national consensus. It was the 50 by 50 decryption key, the 50 by 50 matrix, which was the decryption key for Blu ray. Right. There's like, what matters when we think about the fact that language is always the means to meaning, is that it has now migrated away from natural language and is a question of the functions you can get your language to execute.
00:12:18.112 - 00:12:54.980, Speaker A: This is why it's so interesting to have a network, which is how meaning has always been established, but a network in which the language that is operating is deterministic and executable. It always produces the same thing over and over again. And I can write code that runs itself when I speak words. You have to interpret them. You interpret them based on your background, on your context, on your beliefs, on the way that you've been programmed, by your culture and your religion and your sexuality and all of this kind of stuff. When I write code. It's compiled to binary, and it produces a deterministic output.
00:12:54.980 - 00:13:25.024, Speaker A: This is neither a good nor a bad thing. Ambiguity is really nice. It matters. It's what makes poetry meaningful. But it's also, when stripped from language, what makes code potentially powerful. The post itself also just talks a little bit about the word ether, which I think there, that's ether, which in Homeric Greek, there's like the five elements, earth, air, water, fire, and ether. Ether is often translated as quintessence.
00:13:25.024 - 00:14:06.576, Speaker A: And it's about how our use of the four terrestrial elements interacts, such that the ether is the air of another element which nevertheless interacts with our own by virtue of the meaning we enact with the four terrestrial elements. And the last point that I want to make before throwing open the conversation is that the symbol for ethereum, you can see it on the lights there is the octahedron. It's also chosen for a very particular reason. The octahedron is the middle of the five platonic solids. You have the. The cube, the pyramid, the octahedron, the decahedron, the icosahedron. And as the middle solid, it's associated in modern metaphysics.
00:14:06.576 - 00:14:33.910, Speaker A: And this was very conscious for the people who designed the logo. It's associated with the heart, with love, compassion, forgiveness, healing. And it's a perfect mirror. So if you cut it in any number of ways, you'll always find that the shape mirrors itself, which, again, was very conscious for the people who designed it. Because we are just mirrors for one another. So that's like the context in which meaning takes place. We make our own meaning.
00:14:33.910 - 00:14:52.910, Speaker A: It's always been through words. Words established through common use. Words broadly defined now mean something kind of different. Because we can write code that is deterministic and executable. We can strip ambiguity from our language in context. Context in which that is appropriate. What contexts are appropriate for that? Well, it depends.
00:14:52.910 - 00:15:31.824, Speaker A: It depends on your heart, and it depends on the way in which you want to use the four terrestrial elements, the things which make up the matter of our lives to enact what you believe to be quintessence. So here are the questions. And it's at this stage now that we can maybe, if you would be so willing to, if you can organize yourselves into groups of, I think, three people, maybe four. How many people do we have? 1234-5678 910. 1112. 13. Okay, let's do three groups, two of four and one of five.
00:15:31.824 - 00:16:01.274, Speaker A: So maybe we can have, like, a group over here and feel free, like it would be lovely. If you wanted to sit with people that you don't know, that would be even cooler. You don't have to, but please, like, it would be really lovely. If you come to the front, we'll organize just three circles. There we go. There we go. I know it's strange.
00:16:01.274 - 00:16:47.974, Speaker A: You're not used to this kind of thing. Oh, my God. Now we have to participate in presentations? What have we done to ourselves? Please come forward if you want to. Please. It'll be a lot of fun, I promise. I promise. Gentlemen, do you want to join us? Gents, are you gonna.
00:16:47.974 - 00:17:07.310, Speaker A: Hello. Are you gonna join us or are you gonna work? There's no pressure and there's no expectation. You're good. You're good. Okay, Pier Joseur, come maybe over here. One more in here. Okay, so here are the questions for you.
00:17:07.310 - 00:17:36.899, Speaker A: Feel free to start with what everyone appeals. I kind of like. I kind of like the first two. Like, what is your most meaningful experience? Or, like, where is the place in your life that you're lacking meaning? Those generally tend to, like, be easier places to begin than some of the other ones. The thing that, like, I really wanted to kind of just emphasize here. Right. Is that, like, the ability to make meaning is primarily a relational thing.
00:17:36.899 - 00:18:19.044, Speaker A: Right. Like, how do we make meaning through who we relate with. Right. So, yeah, I would love if you can start with, like, what are your most meaningful experiments? Where are you lacking meaning? Those are, like, really good places to begin. And then hopefully I set a good enough context of, like, there's also this whole, like, underlying thing of, like, like, cryptography, the way in which code applies to how meaning might be made between people that you can also explore if you want. What does ethereum mean to you? I don't know. And how do you enact that meaning? How do you use ethereum such that it is meaningful? It's kind of interesting to think about, and maybe you don't, and that's fine.
00:18:19.044 - 00:18:47.726, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So we'll have 20 minutes for this, and then we'll break. I'll play some music, probably through the microphone. Who knows how that's going to go? And then. Yeah, and then we will do another round with freedom. Okay. My Nina Simone musical interlude was not quite the same, but I highly recommend that song.
00:18:47.726 - 00:19:17.654, Speaker A: It's so beautiful. And Nina was somebody who's really good to ask about freedom, because, again, she brings a slightly different perspective from what you might hear in crypto generally. In particular, I loved the notion that freedom means no fear. So interesting. What does that really mean? What is no fear? What does it mean to live without fear? So as per usual, there is a post in kernel about freedom. The idea, again, is not to provide answers. It's not like this is what freedom is now.
00:19:17.654 - 00:20:00.756, Speaker A: Believe it and you're no longer free to think anything else. It's like, hey, here are some interesting ideas about what freedom could mean. Use them as a springboard to conversation with other people such that you can investigate together what freedom is in this moment right now for you. So some of those things, and it's repeated twice because it's important, freedom is the ability to be conscious of the constraints within which you live. It's kind of a strange way of talking about it, isn't it? Isn't freedom like no boundaries, no constraints? Maybe if you think that, then investigate it in conversation. Some other suggestions that I have is that freedom is the simple combination of awareness and acceptance. It's here and now and not at all.
00:20:00.756 - 00:20:41.938, Speaker A: So this notion that freedom will be achieved in some future state when we all have UbI or better governance or better leaders or the latest crypto tool that is going to make everything okay again, my suggestion is that that's probably a little bit misleading. This is because freedom is our conscious ability to decide which shared truths to trust. How do we decide which shared truth to trust? Well, it's based on how well encoded the protocols are that define what cheating is. In bitcoin. It's very simple. You can't double spend a UtxO. That's what cheating is, which is why we are able to trust it to such a high degree.
00:20:41.938 - 00:21:14.034, Speaker A: Very interesting. So that again, meaning freedom is the ability that we have to choose our boundaries. Is it possible to live without boundaries? Are you boundless? Are you limitless? Did you take those drugs at the door? If you are, congratulations. Please find me later. Lived freedom is the conscious navigation of responsibility. Interesting. Is there a link between freedom and responsibility? It's not something that we would necessarily think, particularly if you were raised in a western democracy.
00:21:14.034 - 00:21:38.614, Speaker A: Okay. And basically there's like two kinds of freedom hinted at here. There's freedom from and freedom to. So freedom from egotistic ways of being, freedom to be who we really are. These are interesting ways of diving into the topic if you want to have means of exploring. And as per usual, here are the questions. You don't need to hear more from me.
00:21:38.614 - 00:22:23.578, Speaker A: So what are you constrained by? It's a nice place to discuss freedom from, hopefully, I think. And how do you establish healthy boundaries? What shared truths make you feel free? How could you share those truths with more people without imposing on them? We do a lot of that, all of us, not just in crypto all the time. Right? It's really, really difficult, especially when you find something which is, like, really meaningful to you, which really sets you free. You want to share that? I took lsd over the weekend. I'm like, ah, everybody ought to take acid. Holy shit. Right? Like, it's like the classic response when you have these, like, highly meaningful, high agency, like, incredibly potent experiences, whether it's meditation, ecstatic dance, drugs, whatever.
00:22:23.578 - 00:22:53.764, Speaker A: Then, like, your immediate reaction is like, wow, everybody should do this, right? Really? Does everybody really need to take acid? Maybe. I don't know. I mean, just think about it. What does it mean to live without fear? That's what Nina says, right? Nina says freedom means no fear. No fear. What does that mean? What does it mean to live a life without fear? So, yeah. Well, we're going to have conversations about it now.
00:22:53.764 - 00:23:35.090, Speaker A: And if you are just showing up, this is a participatory session where we're having conversations based on these questions. So if you would like to join, you're very, very welcome. We like small groups of, like, three to four, maybe five people at most. We're going to be talking for the next half an hour based around these questions, and go. We'll make another circle over there, if you guys would like to, because five at most, if that's okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, you can sit there.
00:23:35.090 - 00:24:31.754, Speaker A: That's fine. That's fine. Cool. Okay, so we'll come to the end of our allotted time together before I just say some final words. And I'm sorry to interrupt, but will you just put the chairs back into rolls here so we can rearrange this hierarchical thing and see how it feels? Yeah. Who's free now? Exactly. Literally, my favorite thing in the whole world is to get crypto people to make neat rolls.
00:24:31.754 - 00:25:06.074, Speaker A: It's the best. How do we even do this? What's happening? Okay. And then seat yourselves in these roles. Okay. You can tell who's done this before. Okay. Okay.
00:25:06.074 - 00:26:00.934, Speaker A: So, first of all, thank you very much. Thank you for actually coming and talking to one another. I know that it's difficult, especially at the long day when you've been poured full with lots of other presentations. I really appreciate it. I want you to take a moment just to see how it feels to sit back like this and have to listen to me. It's interesting, right? It's interesting to notice these things, because what all of this is actually about is about figuring out. How can we facilitate each other better? Right? How can we just facilitate space with one another better? We really, really, really do a terrible job of this, especially in crypto, when we use technologies that are all about peer to peer relationships, and then we forget the whole relationship part of the thing.
00:26:00.934 - 00:26:47.022, Speaker A: So we think that it's all about the scripts and the code and the p two p tech, and we forget the other part of that phrase, which is relationships, right. It's actually primary. And in order to build cool things, in order to find the people that will build cool things with you, in order to enjoy yourself and have a good time, in order to be happy, we need the relationships. And because we've been inverting things all day long, and I really, I encourage you, like, my ask from this, right, is like, go and do this kind of stuff with your friends. It doesn't have to be the abstract things that we've talked about today. That's my flavor, right? Like, I'm a very abstract and somewhat philosophical guy. I get accused of it all of the time.
00:26:47.022 - 00:27:25.254, Speaker A: I'm working on it. But it takes a long time to change anything. Go and host these kinds of discussions with one another, hold each other to higher standards of accounts in conversation. Like, what do you really mean? See, a big part of what we practice in this kind of environment is listening. When I listen to you, I force you to pay attention to what you're actually saying and therefore speak more accurately and closer to the truth. So it is the quality of listening that informs the quality of conversation. If you're having a bad conversation, it's probably because you're not really listening to what the person is saying.
00:27:25.254 - 00:28:08.086, Speaker A: We have these conversations where we only listen to one another insofar as we can pick out what the other person is saying that we know more about so that we can put our more informed opinion on top of theirs. We have these vertical conversations that just get stacked ego upon ego, until they fall into a pit of meaninglessness. Right. What we're actually looking for is horizontal conversations where you can meet somebody at one of these events, and then you meet them in Barcelona or Paris, wherever the hell the circus goes next, and you're like, hey, I really know you. I see you. I know something about you that is deeper than just, oh, you were pitching me superfluid, or whatever it is not to hate on superfluid. Sorry.
00:28:08.086 - 00:28:31.920, Speaker A: They were talking before this, and they were lovely. They're lovely people. I like, but that's. It's nice. It's nice to have those connections. Because when the inevitable cycles come and the markets go up and there's lots more people, or the markets go down and we have two little circles in a room in Paradolnipolis, right? You still have the relationships that last. You still have the relationships that sustain you through those cycles.
00:28:31.920 - 00:28:52.854, Speaker A: This is what really counts. Right? This is why I'm still here. It's not because I have, like, some, you know. Okay, I am a little bit stubborn and masochistic. So I've been around for a long time, but also I know cool people, right? And those cool people are still kind of here. And more cool people come all of the time. And some of them go, but some of them stay.
00:28:52.854 - 00:29:09.158, Speaker A: And that's lovely. So these few words come from the Thanksgiving address of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. So it's not mine to read, but it is very beautiful. They say it at the beginning of every day. The Thanksgiving address. Right. This is what Thanksgiving is actually about.
00:29:09.158 - 00:29:32.548, Speaker A: Don't tell the Americans. Right? If you're american, I'm very sorry. Please forgive me. But yes, this is what Thanksgiving is actually about. It's our minds as one, right? They go through the whole world. We start with the grandmothers, then the mothers, because it is a maternal line that keeps the great law of peace. We thank all the waters.
00:29:32.548 - 00:29:43.500, Speaker A: We thank the fish. We thank the plants. We thank the trees. We thank the birds. We thank the animals. We thank one another. We apologize for all that we left out.
00:29:43.500 - 00:30:11.496, Speaker A: And then we bring our minds together as one as we give thanks for the life that we get to share in relationship. Right? It's so simple. It's just this inter being. There's nothing complicated about it, nothing fancy. But when you really meet people who are in that, then you recognize that all that we're trying to do, it's not some body of theory. It's a living faith. It's a living faith, not in God or somebody who's going to punish you and exist separate from you in the world.
00:30:11.496 - 00:30:43.284, Speaker A: It's a living faith in one another. Right? There is hope as long as the fellowship remains true. So thank you so much. Thank you for this time together. Thank you for bringing your whole souls. I hope you build something cool in the hackathon or just like, hang around and have a lovely weekend because that's also great. And just carry whatever you can of deep time with one another of actually meaningful conversation beyond just the casual shilling that often goes on.
00:30:43.284 - 00:30:55.074, Speaker A: Carry that into whatever spaces you can, you know, joyfully try and subvert some of the stuff that tends to go on and have a good time with each other when we do it. Cool. Have a lovely evening.
