00:00:23.080 - 00:00:44.314, Speaker A: Had amazing three days here. So the whole network of people that passed by really bring value. One month ago I was in Dubai where the atmosphere was completely different, focused on investment and this business type of things. And here it's focused mostly on development and hackers and people who are just driving this progress. So I really enjoy this.
00:00:56.424 - 00:01:05.444, Speaker C: Very easy going, very good atmosphere and very interesting talks. So I live with an amazing feeling of wanting to come back.
00:01:07.344 - 00:01:13.564, Speaker B: It's excellent. I've been to ETH Prague and I know that's organized by the same people and they always put on a good show, lots of good talks.
00:01:21.624 - 00:01:53.874, Speaker C: It's like a agorist conference, but it's using the branding of ETH. So yeah, very good. Thank you very much. Dies the conference was fantastic because we were able to bring for the first time all the Ethereum community here in Switzerland. That is one of the places in which Ethereum was born. So we are really satisfied. We're also really thankful to the people that was organizing this conference war.
