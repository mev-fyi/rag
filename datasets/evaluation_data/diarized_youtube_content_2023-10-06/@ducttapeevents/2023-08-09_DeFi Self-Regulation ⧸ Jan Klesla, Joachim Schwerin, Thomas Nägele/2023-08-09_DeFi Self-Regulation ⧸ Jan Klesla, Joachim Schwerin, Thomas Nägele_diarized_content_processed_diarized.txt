00:00:02.680 - 00:00:16.654, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I'm Mackenzie. I'm a tech reporter at CNBC. Thrilled to be with you. So impressed that you're here this early. We're going to actually start off with Joachim from the European Commission. He's in Florence. He has a ten minute presentation to kind of set up the topic.
00:00:16.654 - 00:00:26.274, Speaker A: So I'm going to leave it to him to begin and then we'll open it up to a panel to have a discussion on self policing and the world of Defi. So thank you so much, and Joaquin, please kick us off.
00:00:27.694 - 00:01:13.060, Speaker B: Thanks so much for the kind introduction, and thanks very much for having me here. I hope that you can see me, I can hear you and I can see me, but I can't see the room. But should proper time. I have seen your absolutely exciting program yesterday and today, and therefore I'm very happy to join you in conference where we have a big conference on blockchain for the internal market in the European Union. I'm sitting here, actually in the Machiavelli room, and that should perhaps tell us something. This is the University of the european university institute in Florence, and I'm very grateful for them that they have provided me with. And this is the very city where Marc La Velik was born and also died nearly 500 years ago.
00:01:13.060 - 00:02:04.324, Speaker B: Now, I had hoped that they had a portrait of him behind me, but this is just some modern art, so we just have to visualize a little bit. And I don't know what you know about him, but he's a very important connection between ancient times and the medieval times on the one hand side, and very modern interpretation of society and politics right now. And if there's perhaps one thing to remark, it is that you can be as nice, as good as you want, but the world outside isn't as nice and as good as you probably are. There are dark forces out there. People have their interest, not always very positive ones, and we have to accommodate. So a little bit on that. My function and that is the economist in the unit responsible for the digital transformation in Digico of the European Commission.
00:02:04.324 - 00:02:57.488, Speaker B: And I've been dealing with blockchain for a very long time now. First of all, speaking, if I'm speaking of light and shadow, we are. We are the good ones. We are those that bring merits to the whole society. This is something which goes much deeper than defi, much deeper than any individual. The whole crypto blockchain, as you know, has long history behind it, but basically emerged during the financial crisis 2008 and 2099. And this was the moment where the ecosystem had the moment of its biggest slump, risks that affected all economies.
00:02:57.488 - 00:05:12.344, Speaker B: And of course, and decentralized automat solutions are a very important if, the most important part of solving the problems in the centralized system. And I'm talking from a public policy perspective, not only to have some nice words to you, but we in Europe have demonstrated that since then, since the financial crisis, and I was involved all the time, in all the bank savings, the bank rescues, in various matters, not only regulations, we have been working from the very beginning to understand, to learn what are the opportunities created by blockchain as a technology and by the applications we have in 2015. That is nearly seven years after we first cryptocurrency at the highest political level from the president of the European Commission, declared that blockchain is one of four breakthrough technologies where we set our future in Europe on it. We have four key for Europe. And this includes, and we are not only talking in the field of finance, we have, as you know very well, just launched the Mika regulation, which is, in our opinion, a very liberal regulation, especially if you look at how we treat utility tokens, and also in terms of what we exclude, for example, we exclude DeFi, we exclude daos, we exclude the real economy applications of nfts. And my opinion, nfts in general, and this is not because we don't understand, but because we think that the opportunities by far outweigh the risk. So if we take a risk based approach, there's no need to right now regulate it, but we have to work with the innovators, to developers and in the real economy, we're also not only talking because we are already building five years large scale, decentralized, open source blockchain infrastructures, for example, to detect counterfeit products.
00:05:12.344 - 00:05:43.604, Speaker B: So this involves the following of the task of a product or service from the source to the end consumer. With the digital twin, we use nfts for the exchange of information throughout the journey. And the data is validated in a blockchain. This will be operational for the next two years. We are already testing it. This whole decentralized space is not talk. This whole decentralized space is a reality.
00:05:43.604 - 00:06:29.284, Speaker B: And we have at the moment as no coming to the end of all current amendment. No, apart from learning and discussing the topics, to go at this moment further with the regulation, for good reasons that I've just mentioned. Now, this was the nice part. The less nice part, perhaps, is that we have some homework to do. Let me look at traffic now, being here at the moment in Italy, when you are a car driver, in Germany, and you see a potential risk coming up. What you do is you jump on the brake. What they do, with all due respect to my italian friends, when they are driving a car and they are seeing a potential risk, they blow the horn so that people can hear you, but they don't produce.
00:06:29.284 - 00:07:29.774, Speaker B: Now, there might be better ways to proceed, but if I take the analogy to the technology we know, that blockchain cannot be slowed down. Quite to the contrary, it is, and I'm an economic historian, the fastest path of innovation that I have ever seen in history. And that is exemplified by what I just seven years after the emergence of the bitcoin white paper, that. So it's not always a good idea to jump on the brake and it's not always feasible to jump on the brake brake, but it's also not sufficient to blow the bond. There are many other possibilities that work on the defi space, and I've checked out your program, especially today. You have fantastic next presentations coming up on the applications. But I can guarantee you that in the political space, especially in Brussels, no one understands what you are talking about.
00:07:29.774 - 00:08:37.324, Speaker B: We already had the problem with transfer of funds and the other regulations that from more than 700 members of the European Parliament, there's exactly 1%, seven that have a fairly good idea of what we are talking about. If I look at what you have in your program today, there is no one who understands that. And that is a big problem, because all of these people might go to, as of next year, when we have a new european parliament and we have a new european commission with a new five year plan and perhaps follow up to Mika and everything else that they might come up with regulations on Defi and then regulate. Of course you can escape. I personally find that the positive thing to do, because we need to have that move towards the most extensive decentralization that is possible, only to show the legacy system that you cannot prevent this from happening as has been done with other technologies in the past. It cannot be put back into the box. But wrong regulation should severely limit the opportunities that you have to scale and reach out to society.
00:08:37.324 - 00:09:37.512, Speaker B: And this is why we feel that you now have a twelve month window of opportunity to discuss with the regulators, with the policymakers, the benefits of what you are doing. This is a lot about communication. This is a lot about showing use cases and helping to design decentralized infrastructures, giving meaningful interpretation to what the defi styles, etcetera. We are working on this and that's the most important part of it, show the very concrete benefits, not for you as a developer, not for you as a dev, not for you as someone working in this space, but for citizens, for small enterprises of what is the change to your life from what you are doing, because this is the only language that politicians understand and care about. So I'm very happy that we have this panel here this morning. I'm extremely happy that we have this event here in Prague, not only this one, but also everything that is going around here. And I will see this as an invitation to have a very open and constructive discussion.
00:09:37.512 - 00:09:49.644, Speaker B: We want to support you. We think that you are very, very important and getting more important by the day. But you have to help us develop a storyline and convince the politicians that indeed, you can have meaningful regulation.
00:09:52.224 - 00:10:34.976, Speaker A: Thank you, Joaquin, for that very comprehensive and helpful introduction to the topic that we're dealing with today. You know, you mentioned that the work on legislation thus far has excluded DeFi and Daos. And I wonder if we almost just start the panel with that, because there is this misunderstanding that the world of CFI and DeFi are the same thing. I think that mainstream media's understanding of the space often conflates the two. And we are with Mika, this comprehensive framework that was just released, that was just approved will actually go into action in the next twelve to 18 months, is squarely focused on the intermediaries that c five space. So, Tomas, I almost wonder if you can kind of set us up with this understanding of what has. What do we have hard and fast rules about in the c five space versus defi? Let's just.
00:10:34.976 - 00:10:36.824, Speaker A: Let's just set up that and then go from there.
00:10:36.944 - 00:11:08.480, Speaker C: Thanks, Mackenzie. Yeah. So, first of all, as Joachim said, it is a journey. And if you start regulation in that space, you really have to educate yourself first. And this dialogue, actually, Joachim invited you to start with regulators is a crucial one. And if you don't have the understanding and the knowledge as a regulator what this really is, the problem is you might end up with really a wrong approach to regulation. And we have that experience in Liechtenstein.
00:11:08.480 - 00:12:01.976, Speaker C: I was a member of the workgroup of the Liechtenstein government to come up with regulation in Liechtenstein, which we have enforced since 2020. And it's a very comprehensive one. But we also asked us the question, we said, okay, what is really different when you use that technology? And we identified, and it took us a lot of time to understand what is really different. And so that's why we defined a new thing which we call trustworthy technologies. And our approach, I don't want to talk too much about that, but actually, this brings us to your question. You have to understand that this technology, as a regulator, you have to understand that this technology is capable of addressing risks, which we normally address with regulating intermediaries, because the demand of consumers did not change. You want to buy an asset, you want to actually sell an asset, you want to find a counterparty to keep the example simple.
00:12:01.976 - 00:12:27.844, Speaker C: But the thing is, if you organize that in a very traditional way, you do that via an intermediary. Right? And the intermediary, they, because they have this information, they have this access to these central systems, they could do a lot of bad things with that. Right? And so you come up with regulation and say, look, I mean, we have to regulate you as an intermediary. You have to be fit and proper. You have to follow all of these rules. We will send you auditors every year. We will do reports.
00:12:27.844 - 00:12:58.906, Speaker C: And so that's how we regulate the space. So with this new technology, you have the same solution. You find a counterparty, you actually interact with each other without intermediaries based on the technology. And if the technology works, well, there's no need for regulation. But to understand that, and that is the challenge. That takes time and not. And if we are really, truly true to ourselves, whatever we call deFi.
00:12:58.906 - 00:13:19.628, Speaker C: Right, there is true defi. There is true defi. In my understanding, there is c five. There is true defi. And there is a lot in the middle, which is a little bit of CFI, a little bit of defi. And there comes the challenge because we market ourselves as an industry and say, look, this is truly defi. We don't need regulation.
00:13:19.628 - 00:14:09.316, Speaker C: And then we say, yeah, you know, to give you the example of a Dex, yeah, but the order book is actually very centralized, or we have liquidity pools, which we are not 100% sure about that. So that is the problem. Right? So we came up with the understanding and said, look, there is a momentum and a room where you need to regulate a central custodian, right? If you custody tokens for someone else, that's nothing different from the traditional world. But if we do it differently, if you allow for self custody, yeah, we might not need regulation. And there is the challenge. Right? There is the challenge that we need to have this dialogue with the regulator, that they understand the difference, and we have to be true to ourselves as well. Just don't use a marketing term and tell everybody it's defi.
00:14:09.316 - 00:14:15.330, Speaker C: It's not. We have to find a common understanding what Defi really is, what is true Defi, and where do we need to regulate? And we're not.
00:14:15.402 - 00:14:33.554, Speaker A: And Jan, I want to talk to you more on this point. Just, you know, backstage, we're having a conversation about a lot of the breaches that we saw in 2021. And Jan was making the point that a lot of people confuse the fact that these are more centralized intermediaries. So maybe that gray zone or on the CFI side of things rather than DeFi. And I wonder if you can kind of talk about some of the nuances there.
00:14:33.714 - 00:14:34.010, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:34.042 - 00:15:02.748, Speaker D: Thank you, McKenzie. This is exactly how Joachim pointed out the fact that the Mikael doesn't apply on DeFi. That doesn't mean at all that there are no rules. From the regulator's perspective, it's exactly. It can be, let's say, quite troublesome. They need to decide what is DeFi, what is not. But just look at it from the perspective of your partners, of your clients, of the normal people, to say so.
00:15:02.748 - 00:15:43.000, Speaker D: They need some comfort zone. They need to know that we are applying some ground rules like anti money laundering. And I'm not talking about banks, I'm talking about the usual guys, like usual companies you want to work with, you want to serve with DeFi, because this industry is not just to serve itself. This industry is going for mass adoption. And to be in mass adoption mode, you need some to provide what we lawyers call usually the legal certainty. But it's not just for the regulators and the. McKenzie mentioned these breaches.
00:15:43.000 - 00:16:08.292, Speaker D: Yeah. No one distinguish, and no one can actually from, let's say, the general public distinguish between the centralized, centralized, let's say, bad actors and decentralized bad actors. We need to earn the trust from the public, basically from the clients. They are going to pay the money and they are going to trust us with the money. That's it.
00:16:08.468 - 00:16:28.524, Speaker A: And you know, Joaquin, I want you to chime in as well. But Tomas, I'm going to go to you first. You mentioned that Liechtenstein has had this very unique approach and has kind of gone beyond what we've seen out of Brussels and has attempted to navigate and regulate around the world of DeFi. Can you talk a little bit more about what you guys have been working on?
00:16:28.604 - 00:17:06.364, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I mean, we started 2016 and we created this vision of the token economy. And we said it's way more than regulating intermediaries. So we identified, actually, we came from the belief that we will live in a tokenized world where we will have more and more assets tokenized. We will see more and more of this technology being used in our daily transactions, in the way how our economy works. So we also came up with a civil law framework for tokenization of assets to create this legal certainty. If you transfer a token also to represented, right is transferred, how identity is dealt with.
00:17:06.364 - 00:17:54.194, Speaker C: So we have a very, very comprehensive and broad approach to regulation, but with the understanding that if something is like, doesn't need to be regulated, like, as I said, truly defi applications, there is no regulation. Right. So it's a very broad approach. And you see now that a lot of countries, jurisdictions and also like international standard setting boards are thinking about not only regulating the intermediaries and the supervisory part, but they try to find solution for this. Digital twins. They come up with some standard rules how you can approach these issues. And that is actually something in that area.
00:17:54.194 - 00:18:18.812, Speaker C: It's true, as everywhere, we should learn from each other because we had challenges. We also now have a lot of experience in comparison with this act in force since 2020. And we can share the lessons learned. Right. And we do that. Right. So it's actually also an invitation for everybody to have a look at what we did in Liechtenstein and to learn from it, because not everything is perfect.
00:18:18.812 - 00:18:23.316, Speaker C: We are already working on version two to address some of the challenges we had.
00:18:23.420 - 00:18:51.634, Speaker A: You know, Joachim, you said during your presentation that a lot of people in Brussels don't know what they're talking about. And I wonder, as you kind of look beyond Mikael, you know, perhaps going beyond legislation around the intermediaries to that gray zone that we've been talking about between CFI and DeFi, where there are these hybrid models, like what, what, how are you guiding your thinking in terms of next steps? What, what comes next out of Brussels in terms of dealing with regulation around these hybrid models that kind of go into that gray zone?
00:18:52.934 - 00:19:37.144, Speaker B: Mackenzie, let me clarify that people don't know what they are saying. I mean, from a political perspective in a positive way. So on a technical level, we know extremely well what we are doing. We have to get that out in the open because we have been growing. But of course, we only make proposals and then there is a complex political process involving the European Parliament, but also 27 governments. We have also three more governments, including Lieblichtein, that apply the rules. So you can imagine how complex and everyone who votes on that from their perspective regarding jobs, security, energy, whatever they have in mind, to judge our space through their lens.
00:19:37.144 - 00:20:31.124, Speaker B: And this makes it very complicated. They cannot, of course, understand. This is why it is so much more important to continue the dialogue, to learn from each other, but also to dive extremely deep into the technology on the one hand side, but on the other, hand side, to take a Cohen perspective. And that for me is the next. We at this moment, do not have a concrete mandate for the next five years that will come next year with the new work program, and given public statement giving the likelihood that something in this space will have a high likelihood that indeed, from regulatory perspective, this being said, we cannot watch Defi alone Daos. The whole decentralized space is a continuum. And you need to have a horizontal to deal with that.
00:20:31.124 - 00:21:04.364, Speaker B: For example, we have in Europe, the tradition from our data rules, to take a very unrealistic perspective, you know, our GDPR. So everyone owns their data, and should be the only person to decide who has access to data. That is a very decentralized approach. On the other hand side, and my opinion, an individual is nothing without community. Think of yourself. You have a family, you have lots clubs, you have all sorts of communities. A part of the person engages with that community and becomes part of that community.
00:21:04.364 - 00:21:46.184, Speaker B: And for example, the data streams, your identity needs to be confined to that space in order to keep you safe. And this also means that at the end of the day, it is the communities that take jointly decisions and not the individual. Mika is, as Thomas and Jan had rightly said before, is about the intermediaries in the defi space. If it is real defi, as in Daos, if it is a real DAos, you have the collective responsibility, for which we do not have a civil law tradition. So look, for example, at Taoist, one example. We have cooperative at local levels, throughout our history, over the last thousand years and longer. Tao is nothing new.
00:21:46.184 - 00:22:23.878, Speaker B: It is a historical local community, a cooperative, that you put into the digital space. And the blockchain enables the scaling that has never been possible before. This is the huge potential. But for that, you need to develop rules on how to govern collective spaces. Also, in terms of responsibility, it is my opinion that you cannot take out just a programmer or a coder, or just guide, that you happen to grab responsible for everything that the collective does. If the collective does something, you enter there at your own discretion. You become part of the opportunities, but also part of the risks.
00:22:23.878 - 00:23:52.714, Speaker B: And you should, under normal circumstances, if something goes wrong, not all your prime minister or your regulator. This requires a much more assertive, but also careful approach towards jointly defining what are the limits, what are the benefits? And how can we embed regulation into our activities? To be more transparent, not to be controlled from outside worlds, not to be hindered by centralized systems, but to be much more clearer in your communication, in your transparencies, on what you can deliver and what not. And if you can do that, that will already help. So I think what we need in the next step to answer your question is to go much deeper in questions of law, but also anthropology, also the ethical questions, to develop a horizontal approach towards decentralization that at a certain moment will come. And for those that pretend that are in the DeFi space, to understand that even if you are very, very decentralized, business, mass, contract, whatever, that this at the start is always a centralized approach, but that you have to let loose at a certain moment in time and have very clear and good rules in order to have things developed. If we can manage that, we are in a very good position when the next regulation comes to have some good arguments, what that will be in detail, we will only see in the second half of next year. So that is the opportunity to stay.
00:23:54.654 - 00:24:44.264, Speaker C: I have, actually, one thing to give you a concrete example. We all know that nothing really started fully decentralized from day one. Like nothing. So it's a process, right? And now, if we think about to give you the example of a layer one, if you start now a layer one, and I can share that experience, you start somewhere, and then you come up with an idea that it's going to be fully decentralized. And even if you convince the regulator that they buy into that, that it takes time and it's a process, right. There might be questions like, but how do you do code updates, right? And who has the master key to do that? So there are a lot of questions, and that is what Joachim said. We have to dig really deeper and deeper into the technology.
00:24:44.264 - 00:25:30.726, Speaker C: And, I mean, I used to code software for about ten years before I became a lawyer. And for me, that is an obvious thing, right? I want to understand everything before I actually analyze something. But imagine on the other side of the equation, you have a regulator, and maybe, hopefully, they are legally trained in most cases, but you find rarely regulators which actually can live in both worlds or which have a tech team they actually can talk to. And that is also an invitation to the coders to talk to the legal professionals. And I give you another reason why we should learn from each other. Because I live in both worlds. In law, we also try to come up with rules which don't need court cases anymore.
00:25:30.726 - 00:25:51.878, Speaker C: So the idea was to have a very precise rule set, a law where everything is 100% clear. So if you do something, that's the result, I think, for the coders. That sound familiar, right? That didn't help. That didn't work out well. Right. Yes, it's getting better, but we still need courts. And I think we all agree.
00:25:51.878 - 00:26:05.806, Speaker C: And that is actually something we pre discussed a little bit. Yes. We do have some challenges with code which we cannot change. Right. So there are results which we want to avoid. There are flaws. There are challenges.
00:26:05.806 - 00:26:22.478, Speaker C: Right. So. But this is the same. This is exactly the same. Policymakers come up with rules which are not completely auto executable. Right. So you need enforcement and things, but it's not really that different.
00:26:22.478 - 00:26:47.198, Speaker C: So I think if we. And that's the invitation, let's start to work together more intensively. We do work together since years, but let's incentivize that because it's needed more than ever. Because if we don't do that now, we will end up having really bad regulation. Because everybody, now we start to regulate somewhere, the c five space. The next thing is we need to regulate nfts. We need to regulate DeFi.
00:26:47.198 - 00:27:18.018, Speaker C: We need to regulate everything. And if we don't do that, if we don't start that dialogue and tell them what our industry is capable of doing, where we can actually add value, where we can solve problems. And, Joachim, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I heard between the lines that you said the solution for c five is not regulation, it's Defi. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but at least that is what I believe. Long term. But that's a long journey. That takes time.
00:27:18.018 - 00:27:31.010, Speaker C: It's not that. We do the kill switch tomorrow, and then we will have another solution. It's a process. And within the process, coming back to the original topic, self regulation might be a very good solution.
00:27:31.202 - 00:28:10.774, Speaker D: Let me just disagree with you, Thomas, on one thing. This is not an invitation. This is the only thing the industry can do, because the next step is not on the side of the regulators. The next step is on the side of the industry. Well, just if you all probably remember 2019 and all the heated discussions about Libra, the Facebook felt stablecoin, right? So I remember especially one hearing in New York's office of the Security Exchange Commission. And actually, they were clueless. They were helpless and, you know, like, little bit afraid.
00:28:10.774 - 00:28:36.564, Speaker D: So, should we be surprised by what is happening now in the US? No, absolutely not. Is it like, you know, the good approach to industry? Of course. Of course not. But we need to listen to the guys on the other side. We need to listen to Joachim. He's actually not on the other side. But then in Europe, well, that was much more sensible approach.
00:28:36.564 - 00:29:35.952, Speaker D: We got a Micah, and I heard from all the guys like, you know, big exchanges like, oh, we don't care. Like two years ago, no, we are going to Bahamas, that's fine. Then like half a year ago, everyone came and said, hey, there's a mika, we need to do something about it. But guys, the mika was actually done almost a year ago exactly on the 30 June at 23 35, just before the midnight, the text was done. So now, and I know Mackenzie asked us before, what are the lessons to be learned? Well, the first lesson is to listen to the guys, like to the regulators. Second, we should not definitely wait for them to move the next step. And third, it's our time to do the next step.
00:29:35.952 - 00:29:58.640, Speaker D: And what can we do? Well, we should send the standards, the industry standards. We should say, okay, this is the industry standard. We don't need a regulator for that. We can say, okay, this is the standard of transparency. This is the standard of the governance of the DAO. And yes, let's talk about it. To defy, why not? We can do that.
00:29:58.640 - 00:30:34.694, Speaker D: So everyone can be sure that if any DeFi application and DeFi protocol is actually following the standard, that's fine. If not, yeah, there's a probability red flag. That's the minimum we can do as an industry. Then the regulators will see, hey, these guys are doing something. They really want to be legit. They really want to do something. And the partners, either financial institutions or traditional industries, can say, hey, there is something going on.
00:30:34.694 - 00:30:55.456, Speaker D: These guys are legit, they are playing by the rules. That's an important thing to play by the rules. But we are in the position to set the rules. That's basically the main message for me today. We are here to set the rules for the Defi. We don't have to wait for anyone in the US, in the EU, anywhere else.
00:30:55.600 - 00:31:25.672, Speaker C: And I'm a simple guy, so if I would sit in the audience, I would say, yeah, but I don't know Joachim in person, like personally, I don't have his email address. It's very simple. It's a nonprofit association called Inattpa. The logo is what was there before, where Jan is a board member, where Bara is in the executive team, and where I'm also in the board and I have the honor to chair the board. It's a nonprofit association. Talk to us. And we are actually creating that dialogue to regulators.
00:31:25.672 - 00:31:29.124, Speaker C: That's top of marketing of inappa.
00:31:29.864 - 00:32:17.562, Speaker A: You know, Jan, you mentioned what we're seeing in the US right now. And this in particular has been quite a charged week with the SEC coming out with suits against both binance and Coinbase. A lot of people feel as though this regulation by enforcement approach that we've seen in the US in the last few years is the exact opposite to what you should be doing and dealing with the space. A lot of people have pointed to Mika in particular as an example of progressive ways to proactively work with practitioners. Joaquin mentioned the fact that he does work with top innovators in the space, so that they're making informed decisions in the way that they build out these guardrails. And I guess, you know, one thing that I think about, I have a couple questions out of this. Like, one, how do you not stifle innovation as you create rules around it? Whether that's from the policymaker side, you know, the legal nuances, self regulation.
00:32:17.562 - 00:32:26.242, Speaker A: It seems like this very delicate balance between creating sound guardrails and then not letting innovation prosper, I guess. So how do you. How do you navigate that?
00:32:26.298 - 00:33:30.228, Speaker C: May I take that? Because we have that experience when we imagine, like, Liechtensten is a very small country, and we had some blockchain, actually, companies already there in 2016, we had icos. And so we started to think about regulation. And that was one of the questions. If we start as one of the first ones, like, nobody will come back to our country anymore, right? Like, everybody will say, like, why should I do that in Liechtenstein, Switzerland is next door, or Austria is next door there is not regulated. Why should I go there? But actually, what you do is when you create, and that's our actually experience, is if you come up with a sensible approach and a balanced approach, yes, it might be more challenging for them, it might take more, it's costly. But on the other hand, like, what if you are financed by an investor, right? They think about risks, and legal risks are always something they care about, right? And if you can tell them, look, this is the rule set, if we follow these rules, they're fine with it. And I think these are the two different approaches, completely different approaches.
00:33:30.228 - 00:33:52.284, Speaker C: I think where you come up with a rule set and this is not possible everywhere. I remember that Joachim also said, it's. Sometimes we are just too slow. Right. It's challenging. On the other hand, this gives you this legal certainty we need. And we saw that a lot of these companies actually welcomed that regulation.
00:33:52.284 - 00:34:47.983, Speaker C: If it is sensible, if you listen to the industry, if you regulate it properly, and if it's not too much of a burden to do that, if you scrutinize them, yet that's different, that's good. I think on the other hand, what you said is actually more of the, you can also think of the Silicon Valley approach. Just do it and ask for forgiveness later. The question is, what are the consequences? If you are then out of business because of that, then I think the consequences are just too high. If you pay for litigation and maybe are fine, that might be different. But I truly believe that the approach that if you are a central intermediary, even if you, if you have a balanced approach in combination with a self regulation approach, where the industry comes up with standards, is the way forward, and we will evolve throughout the process. But it takes time.
00:34:47.983 - 00:34:57.775, Speaker C: And the last thing I'm going to say is it is a filter function. If you have a sensible regulation, the guys who don't want to comply with the rules, they do it somewhere else.
00:34:57.959 - 00:35:15.008, Speaker A: I want to hear from both other panelists. Just one quick aside. You mentioned Switzerland. I also think of the UK. I've been speaking to a lot of crypto firms that say that, yes, while there are stringent rules in these jurisdictions, they're just so hungry for clarity. And it's okay if it's stricter. They just want to know what the ground rules are going into it.
00:35:15.056 - 00:35:47.278, Speaker D: But Jan, that was exactly my point. And before we ask Joachim how to do that, because he's actually the only one here, you know, in the position to say, well, the answer is to keep it simple and clear. When I moved to the US with a fintech startup, we applied for the license. Just a simple starting one. There are five and you know it, Mackenzie, but there are five regulators, guys, and you need to get a license in 51 states. I'm not kidding. So that's a nightmare.
00:35:47.278 - 00:36:24.680, Speaker D: You are going to pay to lawyers like a lot of money, so just keep it simple. I can't even remember the names of all the five regulators. So just, do you have one single point of entry? And actual, as a regulator, you can, if you have a law for that, you can ask for anything. But it should be simple, it should be clear, and actually it should be, like, fair to use this word. It's quite vague, but it should be fair. Then everyone can play by the rules. But the case rule is basically the one that should apply.
00:36:24.792 - 00:36:59.872, Speaker C: Allow me one sentence, and don't get us wrong. We don't think that this approach or that approach from any other jurisdictions is bad or whatever. I think we should lead by a good example and we should actually come up with a solution which is sensible in the hope that others will follow that. Right. And in Brussels, we talk about the Brussels effect, or we call it the Brussels effect, which we had with GDPR. I think if Mika would have such an effect, because it is a very well thought through regulation. It understands the difference between securities and crypto assets.
00:36:59.872 - 00:37:10.296, Speaker C: It excludes Defi, as Joachim said. So I think that that's actually something we should work on, that it's used by others.
00:37:10.440 - 00:37:12.964, Speaker A: And Joachim, any other comments you wanted to add on this?
00:37:14.304 - 00:37:52.328, Speaker B: I think that Makia very complied. I lost five. It was very good. I didn't have to reply what you asked. Thing is, just to add to what you should not underestimate this industry. Nika was actually much earlier, even a year before the clear idea that the need to actively design some rules at the right moment to launch. At this moment, we are very active at looking at the Defi space and discussing these things.
00:37:52.328 - 00:39:26.054, Speaker B: But regulations for there are enough possibilities to influence the space, as we have been discussing here today. And I think that this merits the attention first, before we really move to full fledged regulation, because regulation is something, the end result will always be something different from what you put in this discussion. And this is, I would say this represents Jan is playing an active role in this. There are others also that work on the dialogue. We are having a lot of technical discussions of demonstration effects, of learning experiences and workshops to really understand what is going on at this moment, especially regarding privacy, regarding, for example, the interfaces, the roles of oracles, but also how we can really improve decentralization. Where I would say certain things in the industry for good arguments, not necessarily prone to move forward to much more decentralization, especially if you not only look at the governance, but also at the provision of resources, who is running nodes, who is providing inputs, who is in control. All of these are very, very important questions, where we think that the industry is best advised to come to conclusions and to first, as we have been discussing here, and then really force us if there is a political push from.
00:39:26.054 - 00:39:53.324, Speaker B: To only come from this relationship. There's no other way. And this is happening right now, this discussion. So while we will only hear of what we will be doing concretely, of course, we are now putting all the legal blocks together to have our storyline. And this is why, actually, this event today, a very active role of Thomas and everyone in the room is so important.
00:39:54.464 - 00:40:21.384, Speaker A: You know, before I open up this conversation to audience questions, something that I've been thinking about, and something that we were also discussing ahead of this chat, is the fact that the risks with AML and KYC standards is that it's not easy easily solved with tech. People have been working on digital identities and other ways to kind of solve for this problem. But how, what happens in that space, especially as you start to think about DeFi opening up and becoming more mainstream, bringing in institutional players, what does that look like in practice?
00:40:23.564 - 00:40:55.056, Speaker D: Well, actually, the email is a big thing for everyone. What we need to know. Well, three things. First, you can't escape. You can try, you cannot escape. In the end, there will be at least someone, you know who will be, will be responsible for the AML. Second thing, actually, with the russian invasion to Ukraine, well, the world has changed and everyone is very, very cautious about the AML.
00:40:55.056 - 00:42:16.930, Speaker D: For instance, right now in Germany, and I'm not criticizing Germany in here, just to be clear, but it's easier to be arms trader and to send the money, because if you are, if you're playing by the rules and you have all the documents right, you can do that. And it's legal now. It's needed, you know, to defend Ukraine, but it's almost impossible to have an account, you know, if you're a crypto trader, you have to go to really like very much details to be. To be combined with AML. The third thing you mentioned, the self identity, and Joachim mentioned EBC, the european blockchain services project I've been working on a little bit for the last couple of years, and now there's a huge struggle between, you know, the centralized solution in Europe for the identity. You probably heard about the digital wallet and let's say, the solutions based on blockchain. I personally believe that the one based on blockchain, even though it's a little bit centralized now, that should prevail because it can help us, because we can use, we can interpret with these ledgers and we can use the identity.
00:42:16.930 - 00:42:32.114, Speaker D: If it stays in just the centralized solutions, that will be quite hard. And actually, anyone who tried to get a driver's license here in this country knows what I'm saying, what I'm talking about.
00:42:33.774 - 00:42:45.034, Speaker A: Are there any. I mean, I have more questions I could go with, but are there any audience questions that you want to, anyone want to chime in? I can hand you my microphone if so. Okay, yeah, please.
00:42:47.954 - 00:43:55.464, Speaker E: Hi, first of all, thank you so much for the super interesting panel. I'm going to try to paraphrase a question that came up in a discussion during the build up to this event when we started with the organizational work last year. And it actually ties a little bit to the term that you've actually brought up during the discussion, which is the true defi. First of all, I would like you to elaborate a little bit on the definition there, because I think even the industry players are not that much aligned on what that actually really means. And it kind of ties into the second part of the question, which would be there are some people in the industry who expressed the opinion during the build up debates that the true defi actually doesn't need to worry about regulation whatsoever because it's unstoppable technically, on the technology level, etcetera, etcetera. Kind of like dark web is, in a way. So I guess I would like you to elaborate on the definition and how you then relate to regulation of true defi.
00:43:56.484 - 00:45:02.882, Speaker C: I can start here, as I said before, when we started to think about regulation, we started with the understanding that there's a technology which allows to do things differently. But then all of these questions start, what is really a decentralized protocol? Is it like, where do you start and where do you end? Is it like with, I know, a specific amount of nodes and a specific consensus algorithm, and what is the difference of a excel sheet I upload to a cloud, which is then stored on several instances. Right. So there is, first of all, a lot of research done, like, from an academic perspective, what is really truly decentralized from. I can, I can talk about what is happening in South Korea. They're doing a lot of good work here, but for sure in Europe, we are working on that as well. I think that there is a lot of research done in that area.
00:45:02.882 - 00:45:40.304, Speaker C: And I think that is also extremely necessary because that comes back to that question. If you talk to a regulator and tell them with true Defi, we don't need regulation. I mean, you tell them you cannot regulate because it's unstoppable. I just remember one thing. There was this discussion that the travel rule should also be applicable when you send a transaction from one wallet to the other wallet. And then, like the question was, yeah, but how do you implement that? Right. I mean, very simple.
00:45:40.304 - 00:46:10.644, Speaker C: You implement it in code and someone is providing that code. So go to that software company. Right? So, yes, don't underestimate the power of enforcement. I'm not saying that it's good, but don't underestimate that. So I think the approach there is, I would not say it's unstoppable and that's why you cannot do anything about it. I would say it's unstoppable and therefore we do not have to do anything about it because it works like it should. It addresses the risks.
00:46:10.644 - 00:46:34.972, Speaker C: It's protecting consumers. It's not possible that the founder of that project is getting 10% of all of the transaction fees or whatever. I think that should be the argument. And that is really the core of the core of the core of the discussion. And that is actually what we should work on. Right. These researchers are working on.
00:46:34.972 - 00:46:57.728, Speaker C: There is academic research, but also the work which is done at several associations. But I think the industry has to be honest. We have to be. Be honest and not like label something differently. I said that already quite a lot of times. But I think for me that is the core question. And as you said, there are like.
00:46:57.728 - 00:47:08.044, Speaker C: You can define a specific like, it's not easy to define that what is really decentralized and what is not. But they are like. We all have some ideas.
00:47:11.504 - 00:48:02.706, Speaker B: If I may very briefly jump out in 1 minute, one room further to the next conference. Unfortunately, these are two different things. On the one hand side, it's extremely important to have the move towards true Defi also as a behind or contrary to other technologies. This is nothing that you can prevent and prohibit. This is good. And we must show the legacy system that we can continue and go on, regardless of what happened. On the other hand side, if we combine this technical opportunity with the attitude that you don't care about governance issues, how the regulators, you will probably always find somewhere in this planet, but it will probably not be a very nice place to be in the long term.
00:48:02.706 - 00:48:58.542, Speaker B: It is, in my opinion, better strategy, on the one hand side, to work for this space. On the other hand side, to take some standards, not only technical standards, but also governance standards, ethical standards, to join, to develop and see how you can really convince people that you want them to join in order to move with you towards this space and become in the future. If I put it like this, we have taken over all this space. We will have. All of that is out of the discussion. That we will have this future only with perhaps how desensitized might be in theoretical terms, but it will be much more decentralized than it is now. We can go there the halfway, or we can go there the easier way, by looking for communication, by looking for cooperation.
00:48:58.542 - 00:49:21.164, Speaker B: And I think the nature of. Of decentralization is cooperation. Why create confrontation and create ditches, dig holes and stuff like that? You do not need that in order to have. I wish you very productive and fruitful discuss very much having a link.
00:49:24.904 - 00:49:28.024, Speaker A: Thank you for joining us, Jan. I'd also love to hear from you on this.
00:49:32.844 - 00:49:33.396, Speaker C: First.
00:49:33.500 - 00:49:52.544, Speaker D: Thank you, Joachim, and enjoy. Florence. It will be quite a heated discussion and heated weather there, I guess. So as a lawyer, I should say yes. The definition is the first thing to do. Maybe I can surprise you. I don't care about the definition because there always will be the rules.
00:49:52.544 - 00:50:30.868, Speaker D: There are already those. Even Defi has to, let's say, apply. For instance, Mackenzie mentioned Aml KyC. The only question is how to enforce it and who is responsible. So I would say that this approach, I'm sorry to say so, but this approach, and I heard it from a lot of friends working on DeFi applications and protocols, actually, this is a wrong one, and I can tell you why. Because you are shifting the burden to the little guy. You are shifting the burden to anyone, transacting somehow with the defi.
00:50:30.868 - 00:51:10.584, Speaker D: So you mentioned darknet. Yes. The police or anyone else cannot really get into the darknet, but they can, for instance, track the packages. So if we don't want the DeFi to become something illegal, something in a gray zone, something like a financial black market, well, we should really get back to what Joachim said, to what Thomas said, actually, and to start playing by the rules. And as I said before, let's set the rules first. We have an opportunity to do that. So that's it.
00:51:10.964 - 00:51:29.064, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. And as you come up, one final question I had, in terms of this idea of self regulation and the working groups that you hold to kind of come up with some of those internal policies, what's been the most divisive or contentious issue that comes up? Like, where do you guys disagree internally?
00:51:29.364 - 00:51:30.304, Speaker D: Definition.
00:51:31.804 - 00:51:32.156, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:32.180 - 00:51:59.854, Speaker D: And no one knows, really what the DeFi is now. But no, jokes aside. Yeah, the definition, but then the risks, because first you need to define the risks to know what the measures should be. And actually, if you start the list, what risks can any defi application or protocol pose to normal people, basically in their assets, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, that's a long list.
00:52:00.754 - 00:52:04.454, Speaker A: We're going to end this discussion with one final audience question, please.
00:52:04.634 - 00:52:06.274, Speaker B: Okay. Can you hear me?
00:52:07.334 - 00:52:41.210, Speaker F: So, after the GFC, all the regulations that came in centralized banking a lot. So the BIS, the Fed, SEC, all of these different banking regulators centralized it a ton. The only entities with enough lawyers to handle it were the massive banks. So globally, we saw a ton of centralization of banking. Consumers had less choices. Now you've got the Americans enforcing secs, you know, like the. How we test the traditional securities legislation is being applied to anyone who wants to sell crypto to Americans.
00:52:41.210 - 00:53:30.564, Speaker F: The UK just came out a couple days ago with new guidance on marketing crypto. To british citizens. The EU has Mica. To me, this is very obviously going to centralize crypto into entities that only have the lawyer capacity or the capacity to deal with all these different legal requirements. So how can you say about setting the rules or creating a playbook? How can you say that companies need to fall in line with this while also expecting to do anything other than stifle innovation? It's very clear that new projects are not going to be able to start up and comply with the EU, UK, USA, canadian, australian expectations of legality. Thank you.
00:53:32.824 - 00:54:12.156, Speaker D: Thomas mentioned the GDP effect. So what is the opportunity here is, well, basically Mika will be a global standard in some way. So we hope that we can ride this wave. And with Mika going global, we can go global with market standards. That's the positive side. And let me tell you one thing that's also another reason why we can believe this. The fintech or finance industry is the only one that was able to.
00:54:12.156 - 00:54:54.864, Speaker D: Basically the startups from fintech were able to go to the US, not the other way around. We can remember evolut at n 26 going to the US. There are no us fintechs actually coming to Europe every second euro was invested before the COVID in VC investments was invested in Europe, in Fintech. I believe that DeFi and the crypto industry is the next wave of Fintech. So for the business and political reasons and policy reasons, we believe that we can set the global standard from Europe here.
00:54:55.604 - 00:55:30.484, Speaker C: Let me actually give you that question back, because I think what we said is we don't think that ultimately flee regulation is the solution. That's not ultimately the solution. The problem is there are some areas where the technology is already there to address these risks properly. But if you look at the vast majority of what we call our industry, it is very centrally organized. So it is a process. And the answer to your question is a process takes time. And we have steps, and we are now in the step of.
00:55:30.484 - 00:56:07.932, Speaker C: It was the wild wild west. We are now getting regulation. But the ultimate goal we should collectively together work on is that we have globally an understanding that there is an area where we don't need regulation and we can use that technology, and then it should be actually easier for everybody to create this future. But it is a process and we also have to be true to ourselves. We did not only have very good examples, it's not like that. We are collectively responsible for that, but we had challenges. And that is the story.
00:56:07.932 - 00:56:23.624, Speaker C: I work on that since 20, like I started in 2011. I work on that since 2016 day to day. And I can tell you it is challenging, and both sides have good arguments, and we have to talk to each other to make a better future.
00:56:24.284 - 00:56:36.000, Speaker A: Thank you so much to the panelists, to the audience members for joining us, and to the conference organizers for hosting this discussion. So much more to say on the topic, but I think that was a good, solid hour. So thank you all.
00:56:36.112 - 00:56:37.744, Speaker C: Thank you for hosting. Thank you. McKinsey.
