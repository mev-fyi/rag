00:00:13.440 - 00:00:39.075, Speaker A: Am I right? Okay, cool. Oh, hey guys. Okay, set the timer. Okay, cool. Oh, that's my. Actually, I don't want to follow my slides, so maybe I just do something else. Okay.
00:00:39.075 - 00:01:05.341, Speaker A: This is great. Cool. So how was everyone's conference? Okay. Can't wait to finish. How many people here from Czechoslovakia? Okay, I have to say this is my second time in Prague and I really like it. I think last time I was staying in the touristy area and all I saw was Chinese tourists. So I thought I came to Europe, but all I saw was my own people.
00:01:05.341 - 00:01:30.445, Speaker A: But this time I actually saw a diverse set of builders and found the river to be very pleasant. Walked in the rain yesterday for two hours. Saw some castles. So really love your country. Also, what surprised me the most is you guys have actually really good Chinese food. I think Sabrina would disagree with me, but I went to this restaurant called Basu last night. Anyone has been there.
00:01:30.445 - 00:02:00.513, Speaker A: Okay. So if you want, like spicy Chinese food, I think it was pretty good. Anyway, so my name is Shuyao Kong. I joined crypto in 2017 with ConsenSys. So the company that built MetaMask, Infura and Linear, which is RtkeVM. How many people here uses Metamask? Okay. Does it suck? Yeah.
00:02:00.513 - 00:02:44.327, Speaker A: Okay. So I was leading global business development at Consensys for six years. So I look young, but I'm actually really old. So when I was at Consensys, right, I was doing business development for Metamask, and we always get questions from users. I don't know how many people here submitted tickets, but we actually run a pretty good customer service for MetaMask. So people always submit tickets. Something like, you know, I like lost my seed phrase, which happens a lot, but also sometimes it's like my transaction doesn't go through what's happening? So my experience was like, the user complained to MetaMask and MetaMask tried to troubleshoot and turned out to be a problem for Infura.
00:02:44.327 - 00:03:20.555, Speaker A: Infura, which is rpc middleware and Infuria, like, no, it's not my fucking problem. It's a chain problem. So we had to go to the chain. What happened is that Polygon is fucked. So my experience with crypto has always been the user complain and go to the middleware and then at the end it's always a chain's fault. And this is why I think for Ethereum as a community, we still haven't solved the chain issue. And this is what bring me to Mega Eth, which is a new Ethereum layer 2 that is actually secretly the real Solana.
00:03:20.555 - 00:03:53.205, Speaker A: In fact I always tell people we are Solana Solana because Solana explore the physical limits of machines. But we have fucking centralized sequencer. So we are really reaching the physical limits of a machine while still remaining the balance of the Ethereum security and decentralization. So that's a nutshell of Mega East. Anyone came here knowing Mega east already? Oh, I know. Oh wait, what do you know about Mega east, sir? It's pretty optimized material based machine. Yeah.
00:03:53.205 - 00:04:17.343, Speaker A: Which basically like some of the steps which are like in the pipeline are like not used. There's like a lot of optimizations. Yeah, all I heard was optimizations, which is good. We have a lot of optimizations. But allow me to go back to why Ethereum layer 2 is a perfect value to optimize. So I don't assume everyone here is Eth Maxi. I mean we all use Solana.
00:04:17.343 - 00:04:53.275, Speaker A: I made money from wif. I hope you did too. But the problem with layer one is you can never scale as a layer one, Right. The issue is layer one always has one issue which is called the strangler's problem. Anyone here knows the strangler's problem? All right, allow me to explain because I didn't know this before but my co founders who are PhD from Stanford and MIT, they taught me. So the strangless problem is actually very commonly distributed network. So when you're a layer one, your node has to do three things at the same time.
00:04:53.275 - 00:05:32.745, Speaker A: Consensus, execution, data availability. So when the node has to do three things at the same time, your performance is dependent on the lowest performing node. That's why a layer one can never scale because you're trying to do too many things at the same time. So imagine you have a race with a bunch of rabbits. So Mega is our meme is a rabbit. Because my co founder Lei, who went to mit, he really likes rabbit. So he literally goes to this parking slot in MIT and he just like feeds rabbits.
00:05:32.745 - 00:06:14.335, Speaker A: So we feel like we have to adopt a rabbit as a culture for our team. So suppose you have a race, right? You have a bunch of rabbits and all the rabbits is hitting the finishing line. If you are layer one, your transaction cannot process unless all the rabbits finish the race. And that means the slowest rabbit, right? Maybe due to many reasons, it's finishing very late. Everybody else has to wait and that's where you have struggles problem. That's why you have repeatable work and that's why layer one can never scale. So anyone who build A layer one I think they just want to make money because otherwise like you should build a L2 if you actually want to build something performance.
00:06:14.335 - 00:06:56.953, Speaker A: So now layer one cannot scale. So I'm sorry to anyone who here invest in other layer one because it's not going to work. So why L2 work? Right? And this is the magic of Mega East. We are using this technology called node specialization. What does it mean? Recall in layer 1 your node has to do three things at the same time as a layer 2, voila. Every node is differentiate so each node can specialize in one thing. So we have a node that specializes in sequencing and we optimize the fucking hell out of it via a bunch of things like parallelization in memory compute.
00:06:56.953 - 00:08:02.887, Speaker A: We reroll the whole state tree and you have one node for consensus which can be either optimistic or zero knowledge proof and then you have one node for data availability. So when you have node specialization your performance is not depending on the slowest moving node because each node is optimized and no matter how slow the rab, what you are doing is you empower each rabbit to run at its fastest and you're not bottlenecked by how many how all the rabbits across the finishing line together so each rabbit can cross its own finish line and your network still works. This is the power of Mega Eth. So if there's one thing you want to take away is Mega Eth out Solana Solana. And the reason Mega Eth out Solana Solana is because we have node specialization. So when I was coming for East Prague, the organizer asked me like oh like which stage do you want to be? Like you should be on infrastructure stage. I was like oh my God, I'm so tired of infrastructure.
00:08:02.887 - 00:08:31.585, Speaker A: Like everyone is building infrastructure. I don't know, it's just like everyone's kissing EF's ass trying to get advisory share. Everyone is building decentralized sequencer. But I mean honestly, as a L2 you're supposed to trust the operator. Like why do you want to decentralize As a L2 you shouldn't. You should trust the Ethereum mainnet, right? As a way for security and decentralization. So I chose this stage because I think the reason we built Mega east is to actually empower dapps.
00:08:31.585 - 00:09:17.035, Speaker A: How many of you guys are building a DAPP here? Oh, I'm surprised there's quite a lot because I think Ethereum really faces the problem isn't to build a better protocol, it's actually build a protocol allows more people like you guys to Build innovative solutions. So now with Mega Eth, via our node specialization, we can achieve 100,000 TPS as a millisecond latency. So what does it mean? Right. Solana, max TPS is 4,000 base. I think at max was 140. You're shaking your head. Okay, tell me habibi, it can be easily like 8,000 in reality because I'm running.
00:09:17.035 - 00:09:31.441, Speaker A: But you have developed the hardware. Yeah. Like the hardware is pretty good. Yes. So I think at the end of the year Solana is going to have a new upgrade. Right. With fire downs and all of that.
00:09:31.441 - 00:09:49.629, Speaker A: Let's say 10k. Solana is 10k. Monad is 10k real TPS. But with Mega Eth optimization, no specialization, we can get 100k. And especially with the latency, right. We achieve some millisecond latency because we are having a centralized sequencer. Centralization is good.
00:09:49.629 - 00:10:06.957, Speaker A: That's how we Solana Solana. And for reference, Solana has 400 millisecond sequence latency. Correct for a block. Yeah. Yes. Arbitrum actually has 265 milliseconds. It's actually pretty good.
00:10:06.957 - 00:10:35.799, Speaker A: I don't know why they don't talk about it enough. We have some millisecond latency. What does it mean? It means like it gives you the same experience as Web2. So when we're talking about mega ecosystem and the type of dapps and devs we want to attract, we're actually attracting people who have built for Internet scale. I'll give you an example. We've been running an incubation program in Berlin. Last month I literally rented a hotel in Berlin and then I flew all potential DAPP developers to Berlin.
00:10:35.799 - 00:11:11.155, Speaker A: So we work during the day, we go to club at night. My favorite experience is I got rejected by Bergkhan and Sysfus and a bunch of others. I guess I'm just like not that cool. So we put everybody together and most of our devs are actually not just your typical EVM devs. Right. A lot of our devs come from Google and Amazon and the only reason they're attractive Mega east is because for the first time they can build adapt as if they're building in Web2 because of our scalability and that's something we're truly unlocking. So now I welcome you to think about some use cases.
00:11:11.155 - 00:11:37.335, Speaker A: That's only possible on Mega East. So the usual defi I'm interested but I think you Maybe got like 5x improvement. Not a huge improvement. So Dex on Mega east is a combination of AMM and club very easily. Club actually didn't work on Solana. Prove me if I were wrong and are perps fully on chain perps and that's not an app. Chain app chain is a fixed thesis and you can fight with me after this conversation.
00:11:37.335 - 00:12:16.565, Speaker A: But think about lending protocol, right? You can. Because our chain is so fast, 100,000 TPS and submitted second latency, you can actually have micro liquidation. So you actually don't have bad debt on our lending protocol, you can have real time prediction market, right? Think about watching the TV show Love Islands. I don't know. Anyone watch Love Island? Maybe it's American reference. Anyone watch Love Island? Okay, what's a popular TV show that's very junky in Czech, involves a lot of drama. God, you guys don't do this France, France, do you do.
00:12:16.565 - 00:12:45.705, Speaker A: I mean you came from the 1990s. I feel like no. But I think about you're watching a live reality TV show and you can bet on things with your friends real time. So. And then think about a launch pool, right? Like sorry, think about a launch. But you can not only like long meme coin, you can also short a meme coin. And the liquidation just works very differently.
00:12:45.705 - 00:13:14.362, Speaker A: I think about having a consumer fully on chain. Autonomous world. Anyone here is familiar with the autonomous world group? I think they're like the coolest actually crypto consumer developers. I actually got to learn them because I mean now they're building Mega East. So we have got this team, they were Paradigm fellows. Paradigm has been trying to chase them, to give them money. They're like, fuck these VCs.
00:13:14.362 - 00:13:28.457, Speaker A: I don't know, maybe they're VCs in the audience. Fuck these VCs. We just want to build something good. And they were trying to build our optimism. It didn't work. But they're building like fully on chain Minecraft. I've never played Minecraft because I'm Chinese.
00:13:28.457 - 00:14:12.235, Speaker A: My family, you know, forbade me from playing games. But now I have to because it's part of my work and I'm learning how to play Minecraft, right? And the beautiful thing about fully on chain Minecraft is every block start have economic value, right? Defi Samurai used to work on just the Dex. Imagine Defi Samura works in a Minecraft. Imagine like you have a castle with your gold and if you don't protect it, someone else is going to raid it. And in order to prevent, to keep it safe, you have to buy additional. Ethel buy additional, I don't know, slave or guard to protect it, right? So Suddenly you're bringing everything on chain based on the physical limits. Like to me that is where the next defi.
00:14:12.235 - 00:14:39.535, Speaker A: Summer. I don't know, is it summer now? Winter should happen, right? But for autonomous world it cannot happen on any other chain. Like the guy tried to build on optimism. Arbitrum just doesn't work. It can only be built on mega eth. And these are the devs I'm trying to work with. How much time do I have? Okay, so lastly in terms of culture, right? I've been in Ethereum since 2017, did everything.
00:14:39.535 - 00:15:52.101, Speaker A: I think Ethereum faces a problem. Like you can say Vitalik always says oh, it's like flourishes because a thousand flowers blooming sometimes I think it's a flower it's gonna die because death by a thousand cuts, right? The thousands are the roll offs. What we are here to do is we are really performance driven. Everything we do from a design to community is actually think about bringing real consumers. Your typical Solana people who are pumping while trading meme coins are getting rocked, right? But these people is actually the people who are going to adopt crypto is not everybody who sit here like, I mean I think we're great, we're talking about research and all of that, but we have to have a team representing Ethereum that's actually user focused and user driven and that's really what drives the Mega east team. Every day we think about how to optimize the execution layer, we think about how to appear, how to build depth that's consumer facing and how to bring this like user focused culture to Ethereum. So I think that's it.
00:15:52.101 - 00:16:28.187, Speaker A: Any questions? So I didn't use any of my slides. I'm also drinking beer. Any question? Hi, thank you for the talk. I want to ask what are the trade offs? Like you mentioned centralization, that it's good but there must be some trade offs that you are aware of. Yeah, we're very aware of trade off. That's why we're saying we're performance first, right? Everything is a trade off between performance and decentralization. But the trade off is not a straight line.
00:16:28.187 - 00:16:58.605, Speaker A: It's actually parental efficient. We think we sit at the most parental efficient curve because only by being a L2 can you have performance while still have the Ethereum security. Because you can always have force exit, right? When you have a transaction that can't go through L2, you can force exit to layer one. The trade off here we're making is the true censorship resistance, the true decentralization. But that's not equal to security. We have the Ethereum security. We don't have the Ethereum sensor resistant.
00:16:58.605 - 00:17:25.323, Speaker A: But then as a L2, you're not supposed to have Ethereum decentralization. You're supposed to trust operator and be performance driven. So yes, we're taking the trade off in fully decentralization, but we are sacrificing a little bit decentralization for a lot of performance. I gave you a counterexample which is Monad. Most people compare us with Monad because they were like mid curving us as a parallel evm. Please don't mid curve us as parallel evm. We're the real Solana.
00:17:25.323 - 00:17:52.533, Speaker A: They're like, oh guys, you could do like little Monad on Ethereum. Just not true. And Monad is mid curving it because by being a layer one they can never achieve the performance Mega does. Right? Monad is always 10k TBS. Why? Strangler's problem. Their node has to do three things at the same time, but they cannot be as decentralized as Ethereum Mainnet either. So they neither get performance nor do they get decentralization.
00:17:52.533 - 00:18:25.525, Speaker A: So they're basically mid curving it. So I'd like to call Monad a mid curve parallel evm. So that was our trade off. Thank you. Anything else? But yeah, please follow us on Discord, where Well, we raised $20 million from some evil VCs, but we're going to spend all of that money to developers. If you're a builder, please come talk to me. If you're a protocol engineer, don't.
00:18:25.525 - 00:18:28.225, Speaker A: Okay, we're good.
