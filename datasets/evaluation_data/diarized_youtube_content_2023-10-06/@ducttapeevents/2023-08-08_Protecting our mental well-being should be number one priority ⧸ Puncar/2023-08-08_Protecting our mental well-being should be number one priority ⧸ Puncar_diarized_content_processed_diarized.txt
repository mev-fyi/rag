00:00:00.440 - 00:00:40.974, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think I will be repeating a little bit to the previous presentation. Hopefully I will add to it something, because I also think meaningful connection matters. And actually, just like this presentation, when I was applying for this presentation, I was like, it would be so cool to have, like, presentation before Vitalik because you get like the full room of people, you know, because everyone is just waiting for him. I did not specify. I did not specify that I need to have the presentation in the same room. So if you don't know David, like, it's speaking in 20 minutes, probably.
00:00:40.974 - 00:01:23.834, Speaker A: No, but let's, let's, let's start it so we can all go for it, like later. Yeah. So quick question. Who here works for a Dao, or at least a web3 project? Maybe? Anyone? One, two, four. Perfect. And another question is, do you think the dao work, especially in the bear market, it's maybe more stable or something? What brings you, like, more security? Like, who thinks that, like, dao work, it's more secure? Okay. Nobody.
00:01:23.834 - 00:01:58.744, Speaker A: This is what I thought. And, you know, and this is happening very often, like, you know, not just in the daos, but like, we are changing the jobs. We get let go from the jobs. And in the web3 ecosystem, I feel like it's much faster. Like we are changing jobs much more often. We are taking one project and another project, and it's kind of not easy on the kind of like mental health part because we don't have the stability we used to have. And my parents were working for 20 years for the same company.
00:01:58.744 - 00:02:55.834, Speaker A: And basically they get the paycheck every month, every year. And this is my profile. So one, rage, quit, two, let go, one, sabbatical, three, separation. It's not just work related, actually, it's also my personal life because, for example, the two let go once, I was let go from a Dao, once was my girlfriend, and it feels similar. You don't know when it came from, and then you need to deal with the situation. I was, like, fortunate because I always had some friends I could talk to, very close friends, so I could discuss either the dow thing or the girlfriend thing. I think it's easier to find a friend to discuss breakups because everyone is relationship expert if it comes to that.
00:02:55.834 - 00:03:33.832, Speaker A: When it's work related, it's harder. Not everyone knows what web3 means for my friends. And if I talk about daos, they are very lost. And I could have find some friends. But statistically, one out of five adults suffer from loneliness globally. So we are getting disconnected more than ever before when something like, this actually happens to one of the one fifth of the population. They have nobody to talk to.
00:03:33.832 - 00:04:02.538, Speaker A: Like, they don't have the strong connections. They cannot, like, go somewhere for someone and ask them how to deal with it and kind of the other person to support them. And, like, if you look at the traditional companies, they might have some support. I don't know if anyone works for some large corporation here. Nobody. So I used to work for large corporation. And you have plenty of mental health support.
00:04:02.538 - 00:04:43.156, Speaker A: You know, you can get mentor, you can get psychological help if you need. Like, that's all provided, which is good thing. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's still kind of like not going to solve the core problem that we don't have the connection, and then next time it happens and we don't have this benefits from one company. Like, we still have nobody to talk to. And, you know, loneliness has, like, multiple triggers. And, like, it's also one of the main reasons for mental health issues. I mentioned three, which I think are the most obvious transactional way of working and living.
00:04:43.156 - 00:05:16.072, Speaker A: So we just take a project, we deliver. If everything is good, they don't even, like, the manager or something, won't even, like, interact with you if it's wrong. They would mostly remote work now. So we all work remotely mid here, which is great. But then we go for like month, two months working from our living rooms and so on. So we don't have this, like, daily interaction in the office. Sometimes it was painful to commute, but, like, still we were forced kind of, to have, like, relationships.
00:05:16.072 - 00:05:29.724, Speaker A: And the third part, which I think I focus most on in terms of what I want to focus to solve is social media. Because who has Instagram or Facebook?
00:05:30.224 - 00:05:31.128, Speaker B: All of you.
00:05:31.256 - 00:05:51.740, Speaker A: Not all of you. Great. I also don't have Instagram anymore, and I feel great. But you interact with your feet. You interact, basically, you are posting some pictures, someone else posting pictures. You don't interact with the person. Like, you post or you see someone's vacation and you're like, wow, this is great.
00:05:51.740 - 00:06:26.126, Speaker A: Vacation. Maybe I can go there as well. But you don't actually ask the person, how was it? You don't talk about it. You don't create this connection between the people. And it's not just Facebook or Instagram, it's TikTok. It's all of them basically just trying to create large following, large group of people, which you are connected to, but like, very light connections because of their business model. And I think for people to actually switch from social media, like, current social media out.
00:06:26.126 - 00:07:03.970, Speaker A: We need to find some alternatives so we can fulfill what they want. Like still connect with people. And one alternative can be in person connection. So maybe let's take like 1 minute. We already have workshops, so you probably already know each other, but try to connect with one person next to you or behind you. You don't know yet. Please just like tell them your name, why you actually came for this presentation, is it the topic or what? It's your interest and maybe favorite color.
00:07:03.970 - 00:07:38.774, Speaker A: So if you can take like 1 minute, if you don't know someone from this room, just introduce yourself and create a new connection. So I hope you met some new person. So actually, a quick question. Whose favorite color was the same for both of you? Like, who's. Did you say? What's your favorite color? Okay, it doesn't matter. So let's just continue. But like, this is a good thing.
00:07:38.774 - 00:08:22.724, Speaker A: Like you met new person in like, you know, on the like same conference. We have something in common even for the same like, talk. So means like you might be even closer, but so you have some aspects which you can kind of already, like build on top of it. Like there is something like in common. And that's kind of what I'm trying to build even more. It's kind of like new type of social networks where we will be kind of like connecting people based on their interests, based on their backgrounds, based on their needs. So we just built one PoC in Lisbon, which was like to find a co founder.
00:08:22.724 - 00:09:09.786, Speaker A: So if you have the need finding a co founder, like you might be technical, you need business person or other way around, but you still want that person to kind of like fit in a way that you can work with, you can talk to. So you need to have some maybe hobbies so you can do something else than just working. Or you want to be localized in the same city, so you can just hang out in a coffee shop, whiteboard in the living room, you are not across the ocean or something like that. And I think this is something what we don't have much. We are relying on the large networking events. Social media are diverse. That's the largest networking event where the connections are very, very, very light.
00:09:09.786 - 00:09:51.762, Speaker A: And then we have this networking events like conferences where you get to introduce or hundred people introduce themselves to you. Like how many of them you would remember. Like, you know, it's usually very much like, okay, I remember the name now. Now another person, I forgot the previous person name kind of thing. And like, I think it's not something what I want to change, people still enjoy it, but like we need to build on top of it. We need to build something which will create much stronger connections and that's basically what we are building even here on this hackathon. So overall it should be infrastructure where we create this matching algorithm.
00:09:51.762 - 00:10:32.002, Speaker A: So there is on chain data, there is RL data other to create new type of social networks on top of it. So if you want to build any social network and like matching algorithm will be something like very useful for you. You know, very often I hear like we still missing web3 tinder. So I can provide a matching algorithm for it if you would like to do the depth on top of it. Or it can be very specific like you are looking for someone to ride a horse. Like there is a lot of horse riding in Prague. Maybe you want to find someone.
00:10:32.002 - 00:10:57.724, Speaker A: We will be riding every Wednesday. Maybe we can create an app for that. So this is kind of call to action. If you are a social app builder or you want to change world and something like this will be helpful to you, you can join the Telegram group or you can dm Mer. That's easy. And I would like to build it together. Thank you.
00:11:01.944 - 00:11:18.884, Speaker B: Thank you so much for being here with us and for your insightful talk. And does anybody have any questions? No? Okay. Anybody wants to sing a song? You want it?
00:11:19.584 - 00:11:42.544, Speaker C: I'm okay, I guess. Okay, I guess. So you say like you want to build something meaningful with someone from like community of web3 of awareness community, I guess. Yeah. So are you a more technical guy or business guy? So you mentioned like you are personally.
00:11:42.624 - 00:11:50.284, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I would say I'm more business guy, but because I'm in this space for so long, I also got some technical stuff.
00:11:50.624 - 00:11:52.844, Speaker C: Okay, how much? How long?
00:11:53.904 - 00:11:57.964, Speaker A: So I'm in tech seven, eight years in blockchain.
00:11:58.794 - 00:12:00.294, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:12:01.914 - 00:12:25.284, Speaker B: All right. Anybody else? No? Okay, thanks again. Give this man a warm round of applause please. Thank you once again. And at 06:00 p.m. For whomever it mind concern, we will livestream Vitalik's talk here. So if you feel like listening to what this man has to say, this is a good spot.
