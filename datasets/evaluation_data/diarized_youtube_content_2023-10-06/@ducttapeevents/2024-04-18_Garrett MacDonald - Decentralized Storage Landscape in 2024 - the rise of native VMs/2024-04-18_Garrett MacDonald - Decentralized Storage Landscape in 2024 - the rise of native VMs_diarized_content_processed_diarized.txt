00:00:00.480 - 00:00:50.480, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm Garrett. Yeah, big fan of retro computers and crypto. Shout out to the guy in the back with the Commodore 64 shirt. My first programming language was 6502 assembly, so it's great to see a lot of vms native to decentralized storage networks and protocols that support assembly web assembly specifically. So, yeah, I thought we'd start by just giving a brief history of decentralized storage. Yeah, there have been a lot of great projects in the past that have come around, and a couple of them have fallen off or pivoted into decentralized compute in general, but there are a few which have stayed since the beginning and a couple others that I've stayed on.
00:00:50.480 - 00:02:05.044, Speaker A: Swarm is definitely the oldest one. ETH storage is a great project that was started more recently. Both of those two, I would highly recommend checking out and diving into. They're great teams working on interesting things, but for the purposes of this talk, I'm just going to focus on Filecoin and arweave, just because they're the only two which have started to develop native virtual machines which are going to unlock a lot, a lot of new possibilities in decentralized storage as well as compute. So the two kind of offerings put together by the teams of Arweave and Filecoin are AO and FEM. They both have very similar intentions and actually are causing kind of a convergence of arweave and filecoin, which, you know, are quite different in their architecture and intentions as protocols. But the native vms allow for each one of them to kind of make up for the sacrifices or the trade offs that it had to make in the original design, just because you can do so much more or with virtual machines now.
00:02:05.044 - 00:02:39.634, Speaker A: So this is really fascinating. And we're going to dive into the ways that they're converging as well as. Yeah, kind of the. But we'll start by, you know, just going over how they are as protocols before the vms. So if you're interested more in the protocol level comparison, this is a link to a talk I gave last year about that specifically. Yeah, basically just diving into all of those things from a protocol perspective. So just to do a quick recap from that talk.
00:02:39.634 - 00:02:46.814, Speaker A: Yeah, these are the main differences between the two protocols, not considering the vms, of course.
00:02:48.114 - 00:02:48.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:48.690 - 00:03:57.340, Speaker A: So there's different implementations, there's different kind of hardware that's required for each of them, different tokenomics, different goals. This fourth one is probably one of the most important differentiations. Arweave, by default, as a protocol without a vm, is geared only for perpetual storage, where filecoin is just for term based storage. So yeah, this is probably the biggest differentiation between the two, but today we're going to talk about the virtual machines that each of them are going to be able to run, Ethereum virtual machine versus webassembly wasm, as well as general virtual machines, which each of the two protocols, both AO and FVM, are working on implementing their mechanics. And then we'll go through all of these topics on applications. I wanted to cover a lot more actually, but didn't think we'll have time. So I will put a link to this presentation at the end, which then I'll update probably by the end of next week.
00:03:57.340 - 00:04:52.284, Speaker A: Going into a lot more depth with different applications because I think there's a lot to cover there. Yeah, so we'll start with, with virtual machines. So the great part about both of the offerings so far is filecoin virtual machine is started out by offering just an ethereum compatible virtual machine underneath it. And of course it inherits the same properties, advantages and limitations as every other Ethereum virtual machine out there. You can think of it a lot like l two that settles down to the filecoin blockchain and then webassembly is the big advancement that a lot of other networks are moving to. It's a lot more free in what you can do. You can program in a lot of different languages as long as it compiles down to WaSm.
00:04:52.284 - 00:06:08.222, Speaker A: It's amazing in terms of what kind of memory you can throughput in applications, things that just wouldn't be possible due to gas fees on EVM implementations. And particularly interesting, both AO as well as FVM will eventually be able to support more than just 4gb of memory, which will be super fascinating because then we can load entire AI models like very large and complex ones as well into virtual machines that are running natively on these networks, leveraging data stored on their respective networks. So this is like a massive, massive step forward for decentralized compute as well as autonomous agents, which is a super hyped topic these days. So yeah, just wanted to specify that, yeah, both of these are being worked on by both, and we'll dive in a little more specifically on the nuances there as well. So as well as supporting both EVM and webassembly, both AO and FVM are working on being VM agnostic. So that means as a developer, eventually you'll be able. Both of them don't have this implemented yet, but eventually you'll be able to load up whatever kind of virtual machine you like.
00:06:08.222 - 00:06:59.394, Speaker A: So instead of WASM, maybe you want to implement something else, and then you'll be able to do that and have all of the same kind of guarantees that the applications you intended are running are what's running and so on. Interview and communication, message passing is basically the slide after. This kind of defines what actor based computing is, but inter vm communication is a really key part of that. And yeah, so wanted to just define actor model for everybody here. Basically it just means that instead of having a global state, you have a bunch of independent actors and they're doing out whatever they want. They're doing whatever compute they want. And the only way that one actor is aware of another is when a message is passed.
00:06:59.394 - 00:07:54.372, Speaker A: So it's another way of computing that's very different from traditional blockchains that we're all used to where we have a global state. Now we have a bunch of individual states that are evaluated independently and only communicate with one another as they're programmed to do. So. Of course, this makes it a little bit more difficult to build, kind of like a decentralized exchange or something like that. But what it does enable is massive, massive parallel compute, which means we can do insane things that we previously could have only done in web two, but now through just independent instances and message passing, we can accomplish. Yeah, compute on big datasets in web3 with similar trust assumptions. So yeah, so then where it starts to get a little bit different is in the mechanics.
00:07:54.372 - 00:08:54.794, Speaker A: So AO uses a single system image, and there's three kind of separate units, like schedule unit, compute unit, message unit. And they all have different roles, schedulers kind of schedule when things should happen. So you can pre program that at a certain date or upon a certain event happening. A virtual machine can instantiate itself and kind of wake itself up to do a task. And this is something that's new that you couldn't previously do in Ethereum or EVM based systems, because unless you're depending on kind of an external scheduler running on a web two server or something like that, and it also has basically AO is focusing on WASM first, and we'll have a separate network for running. That's basically an ethereum virtual machine that is native to arweave. And that's kind of similar to what the FVM already has.
00:08:54.794 - 00:10:19.730, Speaker A: They have the FEVM, and that's the thing that you can deploy smart contracts to and so on already. So yeah, the main difference is in this kind of thing is the FBM is prioritizing being more like a traditional blockchain first, where AO is prioritizing message passing first. The advantages of each are the trade off is mostly because filecoin, I think, wanted to build a system which can be used really, really quickly for Filecoin deFi, so that way they can have liquid staking and lending facilities for the different miners, because miners are required to stake tokens. AO is being more experimental. They're creating this whole new paradigm of decentralized computing by focusing on message passing first that will be eventually implemented in FVM, but for now, AO is leading on that side, while FBM has a more kind of secure traditional approach. Yeah, so so far, both protocols will allow you to start or renew storage deals, and we'll dive in a little bit more on the AO side. How? That's really interesting, because previously that wasn't relevant because arweave is by default a perpetual, perpetual storage protocol.
00:10:19.730 - 00:11:32.844, Speaker A: So whenever you upload data to it, there are mathematical guarantees that it will be there for a very long time. And both of course will have native storage access. So this is huge, because in the past you would need an oracle like Chainlink or some other to grab data from a decentralized storage provider or centralized storage provider and bring that down onto whatever kind of compute later you're using, if Ethereum, you or whatever else. So having that kind of like native storage access where smart contracts will be able to grab data directly from the system and they don't have to trust some kind of third party oracle will be huge as well as just because they'll be able to ingest massive amounts of data into the memory of the applications. Whereas in Webassembly one, which is using 32 bit memory pointers, it's limited to 4gb of memory, but that will expand to much, much larger as soon as WaSM 64 is implemented, and tooling gets better for that and so on. A big feature of both of these things as well is compute. Bandwidth is what costs the most when doing compute, especially on large data sets, of course.
00:11:32.844 - 00:12:27.294, Speaker A: So having the compute facilities at the same place as the storage facilities just makes a lot of sense for large use cases, particularly AI. So yeah, this is a really big point as well. So for AI inference, AO is going to create kind of a decentralized compute marketplace where anybody can join in as a compute unit. Some of them can be specialized in running GPU's that are good at AI inference. FEM has this nice kind of probably, I don't know if it's an advantage, but it's just a design difference there where currently they happen to have a lot of miners which have GPU's in the same location as storage. So, yeah, those facilities already exist in the same data centers most often. So it's really exciting to see how that compute will be leveraged for something really productive as well.
00:12:27.294 - 00:13:31.850, Speaker A: Yeah, and here's like, I think the most interesting part of this whole phenomenon that's happening is where AO or Arweave started as just perpetual only storage, and Filecoin started as only term based storage, meaning, you know, you agree with a storage provider for a certain amount of time, and then when the contract expires, somebody has to be there to renew it, otherwise the data is just deleted, overwritten, whatever. Now the other can be implemented in each. So it'll be interesting to see what the reliability is of those different trade offs because Arweave and Filepoint are coming from these different approaches in the beginning and now kind of stepping on each other's toes, if you will, implementing what the other can offer through virtual machines. So it's pretty interesting. Yeah. So AO will use the VM to enable temporary storage contracts on compute units. FEM will enable automatic renewal of storage contracts with the storage providers.
00:13:31.850 - 00:14:23.854, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's, I'm pretty excited about this because now arweave and Filecoin will actually be able to compete once this is up and running. Yeah. So just to summarize, like, key similarities, you know, actor model, meaning it's all based on message passing. Both of them are really trying to implement this. Native storage access is going to unlock large scale compute on big datasets that wasn't possible in web3 before. Each of them are trying to implement EVM WASM and the ability to implement whatever vm that you desire as a developer. The difference there is just that filecoin is prioritizing EVM, AO is, or arweave is prioritizing wasm.
00:14:23.854 - 00:15:08.332, Speaker A: And. Yeah, and the convergence and storage offerings, I mean, that one's really huge. And the big differences are actually not so much in kind of where you want to go, but it's in more of just the roadmap. So both of them will, in their ideal end states, I believe, end up looking pretty similar, just with different trade offs because of those original, because of the design of the original protocols. So the only difference is kind of the order of what's being built and. Yeah, but it's of course, going to be subject to all of those original design decisions from each protocol. So we're still really early in this.
00:15:08.332 - 00:15:45.564, Speaker A: And it's not very clear which will end up being the better offering for any given use case. But on FEM, people are most excited, I think, about liquid staking of the tokens and automatic storage renewals with storage providers. And on ao, people are more excited about autonomous agents doing compute on large datasets. It could be the case that the other is better at either of those, but I think it's really exciting to follow these two protocols as they go on this journey of convergence. Yeah. So that's all. And thanks very much.
00:15:45.564 - 00:15:58.064, Speaker A: Appreciate it. And yeah, these slides will be available there. Thanks. Thank you so much.
00:15:58.644 - 00:16:02.256, Speaker C: Does anyone have any questions? There's one question with that.
00:16:02.320 - 00:16:02.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:06.344 - 00:16:24.364, Speaker C: Thank you. Yeah, thank you. So in my limited understanding, arweave is mostly based on like permanent storage with a blockchain. Right. And then the. Sorry, the filecoin is more. Is more based on the.
00:16:24.364 - 00:17:06.344, Speaker C: What's the name of that? Inner planetary ipfs. Yeah, right. With like mixture of like consensus algorithms. So those are like very different in nature. How do we like, compare them going forward? And then, I mean, besides what you've already mentioned today, and then also, what, what's your view on swarm? Because when it originally, when I originally heard about it, as that was one of the original Ethereum storages, and then after that I didn't hear much about it and I was really rooting for it, really wanted it to succeed. So if you have maybe mention a few words about it as well.
00:17:08.084 - 00:17:32.322, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So the main two questions are about how to compare the two going forward being Filecoin and FVM and Arweave and AO, as well as swarm. So. Yeah, how to compare the two, I think. I mean, it's going to be, it's going to be really interesting, I think. Yeah, it's a tough question, like how to compare the two. I don't know.
00:17:32.322 - 00:17:36.334, Speaker A: What perspective are you asking? Kind of as a developer interested in building on one of them.
00:17:38.874 - 00:17:47.550, Speaker C: Permanent storage with blockchain. Right. In my view, it's going to be more expensive to sustain it forward as far as, like, crypto economics goes.
00:17:47.642 - 00:17:48.030, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:48.102 - 00:17:58.734, Speaker C: Rather than something like filecoin with actual miners there. And. Yeah, it's kind of broad question. Sorry. But yeah, yeah. It's really just so different in nature.
00:17:58.854 - 00:18:38.340, Speaker A: Yeah, they're very different, which is why it's so interesting that now they're kind of going toward the same place with the virtual machines. But the. But arweave actually isn't a blockchain per se. It's more of a block weave, which is why it's called, like, arweave, and there is like a blockchain that kind of manages the transaction history, but the data itself is stored through economic guarantees, and it's a lot of game theory that goes into that. The prior presentation that I gave there goes more deeply into the economics of Arweave and how that works. Exactly. But, yeah.
00:18:38.340 - 00:19:01.226, Speaker A: Happy to chat more one on one about that as well. And swarm as well. Yeah, I've been following it since the beginning and been super, super eager to see them integrate. They've tried a few different things over the years, and I think, yeah, there's still kind of this more quiet team building in the background, but they've been working on a lot of interesting things recently, so I'd recommend checking them out.
00:19:01.410 - 00:19:04.762, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks. As long as the swarm is not dead.
00:19:04.898 - 00:19:17.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I know very well in a life, and I don't think that'll change. I mean, I think they've, you know, kept a lot of the crypto that they raised at the beginning, so, you know, I think they're there to stay financially, it's just a matter of. Yeah. Adoption. Yeah.
00:19:18.614 - 00:19:19.342, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:19:19.438 - 00:19:21.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Any other questions?
00:19:28.934 - 00:19:40.610, Speaker B: Thanks for the presentation. Have you seen any increase in usage driven by decentralized compute on Arweave or by liquid staking on Filecoin?
00:19:40.762 - 00:20:19.914, Speaker A: Yeah, not yet on either, but that's only because you can't do kind of general decentralized compute on either yet. I mean, AO is still in a testnet, and FVM hasn't implemented, like, arbitrarily uploadable WaSM code yet, so. Yeah, it's too early to tell, unfortunately. Yeah, liquid staking. Yeah, that's been driving, like, a ton of volume in, like, Defi on Filecoin. That's like, the majority of it, I believe there's like. Yeah, like, I think 500 million or so as of a stat that I read of a couple months ago, staked on filecoin.
00:20:19.914 - 00:20:40.834, Speaker A: And, like, 300 of that is, like, liquid staking for, you know, facilitating kind of, you know, liquid staking so then miners can take those tokens and stake them for their storage capacity to mine. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you, what else would you like to see get.
00:20:40.874 - 00:20:44.106, Speaker B: Built on Arweave going forward?
00:20:44.210 - 00:21:26.400, Speaker A: Yeah, right. That's a good question. And the thing I'm most excited for is autonomous agents, which are automatically building themselves. I mean, we're starting to see this with different AI tools that are coding, able to code an entire application just through a text prompt. So if we can make an agent, which prompts another AI model to code, something that might be useful or profitable or something like that. We can have a whole ecosystem of autonomous agents going around in crypto land acting by themselves. This is going to really change the way that we all use crypto.
00:21:26.400 - 00:21:54.320, Speaker A: And eventually, as that taps into the real world, I mean, it'll change the way we interface with a lot of things. I mean, just the robots so far have been quite limited in what they can access, but I really believe that AO has the potential to enable autonomous agents to act on chain as well as in the real world in a really meaningful way that we haven't seen, seen before. So it is kind of a potential for a paradigm shift.
00:21:54.432 - 00:21:54.920, Speaker B: So that's.
00:21:54.952 - 00:22:05.844, Speaker A: That's what I'm most excited for. Of course, there's two sides to every coin, but, yeah, I think if we're responsible in the way we deploy these things, it could be really, really positive. Yeah.
00:22:07.504 - 00:22:08.472, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:22:08.568 - 00:22:10.264, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you.
