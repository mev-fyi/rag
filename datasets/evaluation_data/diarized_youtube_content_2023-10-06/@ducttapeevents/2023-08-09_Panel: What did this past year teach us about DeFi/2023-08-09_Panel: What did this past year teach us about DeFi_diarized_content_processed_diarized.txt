00:00:18.240 - 00:00:55.150, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Am I on? Hello, everybody. Welcome to the panel on going over what we have learned from Defi in the past year, we've got some awesome panelists who are going to be joining me. We've got Steve from PWN or owN, or however you want to call this protocol. PWN is a protocol for peer to peer loans against nfts and other collaterals, things like that. We've got Tina. Tina is from element, which is a marketplace for fixed and variable rate loans, or fixed and variable rate assets, products, whatever.
00:00:55.150 - 00:01:26.106, Speaker A: And we've got fran from superfluid. If you don't know superfluid, it is a powerful primitive for streaming any kind of digital assets. And finally, Lucas from Maple is here. Maple is a marketplace for institutional capital on chain. So welcome, guys. We've been trying to figure out, we don't have comfy sofas or couches, so I think we can just stand or, you know, we're in Eastern Europe, so we could do some squats. I don't know if that sounds good.
00:01:26.210 - 00:01:27.934, Speaker B: Sounds good. This is a nice challenge.
00:01:28.994 - 00:01:30.134, Speaker A: Nice and comfy.
00:01:31.274 - 00:01:33.890, Speaker B: There we go. Yeah, I'm into it. There we go.
00:01:33.962 - 00:01:35.930, Speaker A: We'll see who's the last one. Oh, that's not a squad.
00:01:35.962 - 00:01:39.258, Speaker C: That's a pretzel. It's a pretzel. Pretzel.
00:01:39.306 - 00:01:39.746, Speaker D: Okay.
00:01:39.810 - 00:01:52.694, Speaker A: Not real Slavs. To kick this off, I want to ask you guys again, it's been, like, a really crazy last year, year and a half in hell cow.
00:01:54.034 - 00:01:55.734, Speaker B: Right? Mission Castle.
00:01:58.234 - 00:02:11.854, Speaker A: We tried. So it's been a crazy time in Defi and crypto over the last year, year and a half. So, looking backwards, what do you guys think are some of the biggest learnings that we can take from everything that's transpired?
00:02:12.474 - 00:02:27.564, Speaker B: Sounds good. Do I need to do anything about my mic or. No, no, you can probably hear me. Yeah. The lesson number one that I would say, which was also partially included in my talk yesterday in the Institute of crypto anarchy, in my opinion, at least. Oh, we got the chess, finally.
00:02:28.704 - 00:02:29.072, Speaker D: All right.
00:02:29.088 - 00:02:58.614, Speaker B: It's problem solved. Well, my lesson learned, number one, is to fuck incentives, fuck over engineered yield farming, because breaks the system. It kind of doesn't really help much with the adoption at all, and it just kind of incentivizes capital flowing back and forth without really creating any true innovation that would help us reach the mainstream audience, I guess.
00:03:00.194 - 00:03:01.106, Speaker A: How about you, Tina?
00:03:01.210 - 00:03:37.202, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think this cycle, we saw a lot of projects that were really unsustainable. They didn't have product market fit. They weren't sustainable for the ecosystem long term. And now I think that this will cause us to reflect and there and work on protocols, specifically deFi protocols that are more composable and modular and that actually have revenue bottles and product market fit that isn't just shilling tokens and users. So I'm personally excited for that because I think that's so much more sustainable for our ecosystem.
00:03:37.378 - 00:03:40.642, Speaker B: Absolutely. What an insane thought, right? To have actual users.
00:03:40.738 - 00:03:43.094, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Not just shilling tokens.
00:03:43.514 - 00:03:43.826, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:43.850 - 00:04:11.456, Speaker D: I'm mostly agreeing. I'd say it's exciting to see how greed is so powerful in propelling forward an ecosystem, but at the same time, it's given us two years of funding to build real stuff. Right. So now the greed is going to evaporate for a while, but all the stuff that we've built stays. And that's very exciting. You know, a lot of people in this room probably are benefiting from other people's greed in this regard. And that's, let's hope greed never disappears.
00:04:11.456 - 00:04:16.324, Speaker D: It's very unlikely it would, but there will be a couple of years of building now, which is exciting.
00:04:17.424 - 00:04:55.318, Speaker E: Yeah. I do want to echo what was said before. I am sort of secretly looking forward to the bear market to sort out all the scammers and just let the real value providing projects remain. A couple of things I do want to mention, though, opportunities for us to improve is still a first time user ux. This bull market was a big opportunity for me to introduce crypto to my friends and it was still a pretty difficult experience, I found, to onboard them. So that's like another big thing that we could focus on. And another thing that came out of this bull market was a lot of institutional interest and adoption.
00:04:55.318 - 00:05:02.854, Speaker E: So I think this is another opportunity for us to really legitimize the industry and start to talk to institutions, market all of that value.
00:05:03.434 - 00:05:17.974, Speaker A: Cool. Sounds like there's some agreement that, well, that the coming bear market or current bear market will kind of flush out some of the noise, the low quality stuff, and hopefully kind of make room for the good projects.
00:05:18.274 - 00:05:25.314, Speaker B: Even last time, the best products were built during the last bear market and now they are thriving. So I'm really looking forward to that as well.
00:05:25.434 - 00:05:25.834, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:05:25.874 - 00:05:32.474, Speaker B: I'm really looking forward to see what you guys have built because I've seen some pretty incredible projects that you guys rock. So, yeah, let's build now.
00:05:32.854 - 00:05:59.914, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I mean, this ETH Prague has been amazing and it reminds me of the last bear market hackathons when, like, nobody cared about crypto but you come to these events and like, the energy was still great and people were building the uniswaps and the aaves of the world that, you know, flash forward a couple years, people started to notice like, wow, they built some cool stuff. So, yeah, I mean, I think you guys covered this a little bit, but are there any other things that you think have been really limiting to Defi and kind of getting adoption?
00:06:01.614 - 00:07:47.904, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I guess the whole topic of centralizing some aspects of the ecosystem, I mean, there was a really good article, well, fairly recently, you could say, on Twitter, I just forgot the name of the author. But it was like essentially a criticism of reliance on third parties and the fact that even though the protocols are being built in, let's say, the DeFi spread, we're still relying on just a few pieces of centralized infrastructure in general. So I guess what we could really focus on in the next wave is to figure out being very honest with whatever you guys are building and saying, all right, are we really, really aligned with the spirit of Defi? And then are we going to run our own node? Are we going to decentralize the rest of the infrastructure as well? Which might of course mean that target market is a bit more niche, it might be a few large users rather than the mainstream. Or are we going to be on the other side of the things, which is the centralized ecosystem, and then just being honest? Because let's say companies like Coinbase, for example, they've been really honest with themselves from the very beginning, that they are only focused on the centralized aspect of things. And then that led to their success because they were not trying to be somewhere in between or trying to prove to us, the Defi crowd, that they are somewhat defi and stuff like that. They were really honest with themselves and that's what allowed them to really reach their target audience and grow from there. So I guess dishonesty with whatever you're actually building, that can probably unlock a lot of growth as well.
00:07:49.244 - 00:08:38.884, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think on a more granular level, lack of education. I think a lot of people, especially in DeFi, we have retail users or users that want to come into the space and don't understand a lot of the abstract concepts or primitives, the poor ux that everyone knows about in this room and is notorious for in DeFi specifically, and kind of what Lucas started to articulate, which is like the lack of institutional on ramp, because I think that will bring a lot of mainstream adoption for institutions and banks within the industry. And that kind of gives us credibility to retail users as well. So I think there's so much that we can improve on, but that's kind of the scope.
00:08:39.944 - 00:09:10.176, Speaker D: Yeah, I would generally say we focused a lot on certain products until now. Right. If you look back at DeFi, ultimately it's swapping leverage and yields. That's pretty much sums up 95% of the market. And I think not everybody needs that. So I'd say the main hurdle for adoption is building stuff people need. And so far we've been so focused in the bull market to just maximize yields that we've left aside a lot of actually useful things that more people in the world need.
00:09:10.176 - 00:09:25.660, Speaker D: Not everybody needs to trade. Dogecoin. It's not like basic human need. Yeah, some people disagree with me. Elon Musk among other people. Right. But I would argue there's a lot of useful financial products that we haven't even scratched the surface of.
00:09:25.660 - 00:09:50.144, Speaker D: And obviously we're here with people like Maple who are building actually very, very useful stuff. And they were doing it during the bull market, but they're an outlier. 95% of Defi was just yield farming. And that's an opportunity in the bear market. In a bear market, you're just building. Nobody has adoption anyway. And the people who are still around ultimately will use the products you built.
00:09:50.144 - 00:10:14.284, Speaker D: So you can build first for the crypto community and then during the bull market expand to the kind of broader community. And it's much easier to differentiate yourself because nobody else is building. So I think the bear market will be a good opportunity to branch out Defi into things like mortgages, actual uncollateralized lending, and all sorts of other products. Cross border stuff. We'll see.
00:10:15.104 - 00:11:07.090, Speaker E: Yeah, I 100% agree with all of that. I think another sort of aspect of crypto adoption that's sort of lacking is this sort of degen mentality that we all know and love. But I don't think it's necessarily sustainable and won't scale. If we want to really get global adoption of this technology, we need to have the more boring use cases get adopted and be abstracted away from the user. So I think also just proper education of how protocols work. A lot of users, retail users, are attracted to the shiny thing, the anchor protocol APY. And we just need to make sure that they're aware of what they're getting into and just make sure that everyone knows what's sustainable and what's may I react to?
00:11:07.122 - 00:12:16.144, Speaker B: A friend said about building things that are useful. Actually, again, it kind of boils down to the honesty that I was talking about earlier where it's like, at the end of the day, we are building web3 stuff. And one of the really, I think, useful definitions of web3 is the Internet of money. And so at the end of the day, it's always going to be about the use cases that you've mentioned and then kind of branching out from that. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that when we talk about building useful stuff in web3, in my opinion, it's a really healthy and helpful practice to look even into the industries where, you know, maybe we're trying to, like, compete with them specifically meaning traditional finance, but like seeing what already worked there, right? What the, what the users are familiar with. That's why, for example, at Pon, we are building a crypto mortgage, right? We're building the mortgage mechanism for the crypto ecosystem, because we know that the mortgage is something that a mainstream user is intimately familiar with. Almost everybody has touched or will eventually touch a mortgage in one way or the other, rather than trying to reinvent everything.
00:12:16.144 - 00:12:49.214, Speaker B: Of course we have a great playground to play around with the technology. But at the end of the day, when it comes to the actual use case for the end user, what I think is really, really important from time to time is to reflect, hey, maybe somebody has already tried this, even in the traditional finance world. And has it worked? Has it not worked? If it didn't work, can it work now? Because we have the technology, but if we mirror something that the people are familiar with, that can also be very helpful with bringing them into our ecosystem because it would not be such a shock for them, I guess.
00:12:49.954 - 00:13:22.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's interesting that for sure. I think all love a world where you can get your mortgage. You can do a lot of the things that we do in the real world, traditional financial system on DeFi. But today, a lot of the things that are being used on blockchain, some of the use cases that have really emerged are things like nfts. We're seeing some more blockchain gaming, things like that. How do you think DeFi can kind of embrace or interact with those other use cases, those other digital assets that are becoming more popular and valuable on blockchains?
00:13:23.744 - 00:13:25.704, Speaker B: You guys want to start? I always start to.
00:13:25.864 - 00:13:29.216, Speaker C: Can I start as the only DeFi protocol that has nfTs?
00:13:29.360 - 00:13:29.760, Speaker A: Sure.
00:13:29.832 - 00:14:32.464, Speaker C: No, I'm kidding. But I think it's super interesting because right now in DeFi, we only allow users and institutions that are utilizing DeFi protocols to see themselves at the face of portfolio numbers. And what I really like about gaming and nfts moving into the space is that it's ways for retail users and mass institutions to see themselves and their usage of the protocol in nfts through different identity layers. And there's ways that we could gamify protocols that aren't in a way that's malicious to the users, but that makes utilizing a DeFi protocol fun. And I think one of my favorite protocols that does this is premia finance. They're like an options protocol and they have a UI that kind of interchanges as the user continuously uses it. So based on their actions.
00:14:32.464 - 00:15:09.834, Speaker C: But there's so many cool things that could be done. Element recently launched an elfieverse project and one of the things we learned about it was we had 10,000 php nfts and within 72 hours 6000 people claimed them in an incentive for governance power claim. So it's really cool. I think that DeFi protocols should be experimenting much, much more with gaming and nfts. And it's really cool way to allow DeFi users, specifically retail users, to see themselves in the protocol past their portfolio balance.
00:15:10.494 - 00:15:29.494, Speaker B: I'll follow up with just one sentence, because a lot of people here have probably also been to Devconnect in Amsterdam. And there was kind of like the DeFi track and the NFT track, and at least how it felt to me like as if those were two separate conferences. And I think we need to figure out a way of like cooperation in between those much more than it is now.
00:15:29.574 - 00:15:39.274, Speaker A: I've definitely noticed the same thing. Like a lot of the conferences have been, there's. They're very different types of people, they're very different types of projects. And you know, there's not a ton that are kind of bridging that gap.
00:15:39.654 - 00:16:12.040, Speaker D: I'm extremely excited about nfts in general and bringing them into DeFi even more. I think it's still early though, right? You don't see that many Defi financialization plays yet. Obviously PWN is one option, but there's no huge liquidity in these products at the moment. I think one of the reasons is the limitations of the ERC 71 standard. To mortgage it, you need to lock it and then it's not in your wallet anymore, so you can't brag about owning it. It kind of doesn't.
00:16:12.112 - 00:16:14.284, Speaker B: Spoiler alert. We're fixing that right now.
00:16:15.024 - 00:16:37.164, Speaker D: I've heard that a few times, but it's really tricky. I mean, it's kind of a legacy contract that we're stuck with, but I think financialization of nfts is going to be insane. Like if you imagine some actual games that are successful and bring in millions of children, right, and then they all discover that they can lever up on their nfts, it's going to be so much fun.
00:16:38.984 - 00:17:04.838, Speaker E: Yeah, I saw a tweet this morning. I'm probably going to butcher it, but it said something like, the Ethereum ecosystem isn't over financializing everything, they're exposing the inherent financialization of everything, which I thought was super interesting. So to kind of like expand on that, like we don't even know what's going to come with NFTs and defi. Like, it's going to be super interesting, especially with gaming. I'm just super excited to see what happens there. Yeah, I don't even know what's going to happen.
00:17:04.926 - 00:17:11.074, Speaker B: Because when you said your friends were kind of coming into the space recently, were they more into defyer nfts?
00:17:11.744 - 00:17:17.520, Speaker E: Nfts, a lot of them came in for nfts, but they knew just me personally working in DeFi, so they got involved there.
00:17:17.592 - 00:17:46.272, Speaker B: Yeah. I recently had a talk about how NFTs can bring million, or even more than million new users into DeFi, where I believe NFTs is something that anybody, especially if we now talk about the PFPs and art collectibles and stuff like that, something that people can really easily mentally grasp. I'm owning this picture or something like that. And then we in DeFi allowed them to plug that into the ecosystem and extract the value from that, rather than just bringing them directly to DeFi. Here is the protocol and just push buttons.
00:17:46.368 - 00:17:53.784, Speaker E: I found pfps a way easier way to explain digital ownership than crypto. It was really interesting, actually.
00:17:53.864 - 00:18:27.274, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very interesting how many people have skipped over. I mean, I'm super excited about Defi. I think all of us are. And a lot of people have, I think, jumped over all that stuff and gone straight to the nfts, which we all love nfts too. But I think the things that attract mainstream audiences aren't always the things that us super nerds get excited about. I wanted to ask, and I think the context for this question has changed a bit since I wrote it yesterday. But bull markets, you have lots of protocols appearing, projects appearing, everybody's successful.
00:18:27.274 - 00:19:14.522, Speaker A: When the bear market comes, you see token values drop, you see attention leave, and some projects struggle to, to stay, you know, keep that energy, especially independently, and sometimes we'll see some consolidation. So, you know, kind of the examples I was thinking of was, you know, the frog nation tried to kind of absorb sushiswap. That didn't really go super well. The other one I mentioned was, you know, the Rari finance, Rari capital, and the FEI protocol kind of merged into tribe. There's been a little bit of drama around that that I just saw on Twitter when I woke up this morning. But overall, what are you guys thoughts? Do you think we're going to see a lot of consolidation? Those examples I mentioned weren't super successful. Do you think there's going to be some very successful consolidations, or do you think that's difficult to do?
00:19:14.618 - 00:19:16.666, Speaker D: There was also keep it nucypher.
00:19:16.850 - 00:19:20.218, Speaker A: That's true. That one, I think has been generally pretty successful.
00:19:20.266 - 00:19:21.178, Speaker D: Yeah, that was pretty good.
00:19:21.266 - 00:19:23.386, Speaker A: That's a good counterexample to those others.
00:19:23.530 - 00:19:27.760, Speaker B: Are we talking specifically about this market cycle or in general in the future?
00:19:27.882 - 00:19:28.892, Speaker A: Well, either one.
00:19:28.988 - 00:20:12.964, Speaker B: Either one. Well, in that case, I think in the short term it might have something to do with, let's say, a treasury management of various projects or how the project evolves in the short term. In the long term, of course, from the business administration perspective, the mergers and acquisitions, of course, is a great tool to grow either horizontally or vertically. If you kind of hit that growth peak and then you're trying to figure out what else do you want to do with your project? Definitely 100%. If the DeFi ecosystem, like the crypto ecosystem in general, is going to keep growing, we're going to start hitting some of those peaks. And then, of course, we will see tons more of that in the short term. It probably has something to do with how well the projects are managed.
00:20:12.964 - 00:20:20.604, Speaker B: I don't have a strong opinion, but you guys had really good debate about that in the backstage. Maybe you want to follow up.
00:20:21.064 - 00:21:14.174, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're going to see a lot of protocol M and A's specifically because we're seeing a lot of protocols in the space with very similar products and also a lack of really incredible senior talent. So I think that it's natural to kind of want to ACU hire, I think the term is, and build in a larger team. And like the Faye and Rari example is really interesting. But I think one thing that's an interesting thing to consider is like how if both these protocols have native tokens, how then the m and a will result in them both having native tokens that are different? What will be kind of the staking liquidity mining programs further, and how will they issue token grants or kind of continue on with their token economics models?
00:21:14.214 - 00:21:40.482, Speaker D: In the future, I'd argue if you're looking at something you want to buy, right. Want to acquire a business or something, you're going to look at what's valuable there. And most of the DeFi projects of the last two years, there's nothing there, right. Like, the tech is open source, you can copy the code. There's probably nothing new there anyway. They might have some distribution, but that was probably mostly mercenary capital anyway. So there's not much distribution you can buy.
00:21:40.482 - 00:21:50.094, Speaker D: So what are you buying? You're either aqua hiring the engineers, but engineers are extremely mobile in this industry. Anyway, look at the Rari example.
00:21:50.134 - 00:21:53.758, Speaker A: It seems like they didn't end up aqua hiring all that much because a lot of.
00:21:53.806 - 00:22:17.900, Speaker D: No, exactly. Exactly. So what did they get? They got the admin keys to the upgradability of Rari capital and a bit of distribution. And good for them. But I think Rari is more the exception in that they actually had a user base and volumes and some liquidity. Most projects don't, so it makes no sense to acquire them. It's easier to just go and kind of steal their devs and then copy the codes.
00:22:17.900 - 00:22:33.580, Speaker D: Exactly. There's just nothing worth taking. So I would argue we won't see that many. I would take the opposite view here, and I don't think we will see many. And also, M and A's are messy in the real world. Right. And in crypto, we still don't have a playbook either.
00:22:33.580 - 00:22:38.680, Speaker D: So you can't call in Deloitte to handle your m and a for your protocol.
00:22:38.852 - 00:22:50.804, Speaker C: It doesn't work like that, I think either. Even the Feyen Rari one had some issues with the firm that was facilitating it originally. So it just shows the validation of his point as well.
00:22:51.624 - 00:23:41.024, Speaker E: Yeah. Maple actually did acquire a company, Avari, because we wanted to launch on Solana. So they were pre launch. They were basically already building the Maple of Solana. So we just were able to launch so much faster because we acquired Avari and were able to launch within a couple of months, which was amazing. So I definitely think there's opportunities during the bear market for acquisition, but I do agree that there is a lot of situations where it actually doesn't make sense and there's alternative strategies and the m and a sort of industry is. Can be messy, and it'll be interesting to see if people join daos that are more specialized in that field and can sort of make persuasive arguments.
00:23:41.024 - 00:23:43.020, Speaker E: Yeah, we'll have to wait and see.
00:23:43.092 - 00:23:43.864, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:23:44.244 - 00:24:20.684, Speaker B: I would just like to add that I do see a strong reason to make an acquisition in case you're also getting kind of the brand power and the community around it. That makes a lot of sense, and it kind of makes sense as well. In the scenario where, let's say, some traditional company outside of crypto would like to enter the space, then that's a very easy kind of approach. But of course, I've heard some opinions from some investors that they are not really sure how that would behave. If there is even a token out there, if it's not an equity deal, then what do we do about it?
00:24:22.104 - 00:24:46.994, Speaker A: Cool. We're getting close to the end. I want to wrap with one last question, which is, there's been a lot of talk around the idea of permissioned DeFi having protocols that are not quite as open as many of the DeFi protocols we're familiar with. Do you guys think that that is going to be a growing trend given both institutions and the regulatory environment, or do you think DeFi will kind of keep to its open nature?
00:24:49.694 - 00:25:36.794, Speaker E: I think permissioned DeFi protocols definitely have space and room to grow. At Maple, for example, we have two permissioned pools. One of them is acting as a syndicated loan structure. So all of the lenders go into a single pool, and they all lend to Alameda, which is a super interesting use case. And so they're able to use like USDC, for example, and have backers staking against the protocol with NPL USDC balancer pool tokens. So there's like an element of composability, but for example, they wouldn't be able to then go and trade those LP tokens. So permissioned protocols definitely have an area where they can function, but they will lose out on some composability for sure.
00:25:38.054 - 00:25:55.488, Speaker C: Yeah. Also, I think the coming regulation that we're going to see in the space is going to cause a segment of these products, and we'll see these composable products and permission products. There's definitely going to be a segment of the two, and it'll be interesting to see how the ecosystem reacts.
00:25:55.616 - 00:26:15.034, Speaker E: Like just for example, that permission pool, just using the rails of smart contracts to coordinate a syndicated loan is just such a more efficient structure than traditional finance. So even though it's in its own little ecosystem, it's just vastly more beneficial to all the parties involved, in my view.
00:26:15.224 - 00:26:36.718, Speaker B: I do agree with what you said, that permission products have a market, and in my opinion, it's going to be very important market to actually even onboard more users from the outside but let's please not call it DeFi, because DeFi has a very strict definition, and one of the key pillars is the permissionless aspect of it, which we're kind of killing here.
00:26:36.766 - 00:26:39.354, Speaker E: It's a financial application built on Ethereum.
00:26:40.614 - 00:26:41.612, Speaker B: Nice. Nice.
00:26:41.758 - 00:27:13.704, Speaker D: Without going too deep into the reasons for regulation, it will always make sense for some users to not want to transact with other users. And that's ultimately what Kyc does. It segregates users. I think as long as protocols just create these walled gardens inside the open protocol, I'm fine with that. You want the kids to play inside the cage? Put them there, let them play inside the cage. But we need the protocol to be open, because if the protocols aren't open, it's not Defi anymore. And all the work we've done is for nothing.
00:27:13.704 - 00:27:33.256, Speaker D: Right? And I think there's always going to be room for open DeFi because the world is too big for state actors to coordinate against it. And we can unite the financial rails of the world in a way that traditional finance has consistently failed to do. So there is an opportunity for open Defi.
00:27:33.440 - 00:27:44.178, Speaker A: I think we got to wrap up there, and I think that's a really awesome, optimistic take to end on. I want to thank you guys so much for coming in and chatting about DeFi with us, and thank you guys all for joining.
00:27:44.346 - 00:27:45.194, Speaker B: Thank you. My pleasure.
