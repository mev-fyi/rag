00:00:00.840 - 00:00:33.564, Speaker A: Good morning, ETH. Prague yoga this morning was decentralized. Thanks for coming. I know some of you are very warm now. This is a panel on the importance of communication in product building. Importance of communities in product building. Communication is what we're going to do today.
00:00:33.564 - 00:00:40.164, Speaker A: Manu and Elon, please take it from here.
00:00:43.864 - 00:01:30.774, Speaker B: There you go. So, yeah, first of all, welcome, guys. This was supposed to be panel, but we think that it might be much better if we can all contribute. We can all express ourselves and talk a little bit about the importance of community in building products. You know, usually the way that web two companies build products is not necessarily involved in the community. The way that is done is that you come with an idea, maybe you sketch it out, maybe you do some research and ask some people around, and then basically you publish it. And after that you might do some a b testing.
00:01:30.774 - 00:02:16.214, Speaker B: And most of the decisions are not based on the community or how the community interacts with your product, but rather based on data analysis, as I said before, like a v testing and so on. But can you really do that with a smart contract? Can you really do an a B testing? I personally don't think so. When you launch a protocol, you don't really have the opportunity to launch it twice. Once you set up, let's say, the initial parameters or something, you're basically determining how the future of the protocol is going to be. Like, I see that Adrian has some comment. I said.
00:02:26.234 - 00:02:51.528, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll pass to the microphone. I want to say that I think Vitalik talked about this yesterday in his talk. Right? He was like, so we're talking about corporations or stuff like that. They're like n or like one to n. So like one too many. And in crypto, the goal of community is end to end. So many people getting value, putting value in, and many people on the other side getting that value.
00:02:51.528 - 00:03:26.766, Speaker C: And I think this is the really big difference in web three. In web, too, like Manu said, you build the product, you release it, you test, and it's centralized, and you give it to. Maybe sometimes you ask for feedback or you make a community forum for your web. Two thing in what we're doing, it's like you really have to use your community from the beginning. You really have to be with them. There needs to be sort of the feeling that everybody has. I call it shared ownership into whatever that is.
00:03:26.766 - 00:03:51.858, Speaker C: And that's kind of like what we're talking about here a lot, right? It's like, I can be an owner in the product that I help build. And so, like these type of things, I think, you know, they're very important. And then now the question is, like, how do we actually involve the community? Like how do you get them to participate? And there are like, I guess, many tools, many practices, many ways to do that. But, yeah, like we can maybe brainstorm some of the things.
00:03:52.026 - 00:03:53.734, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that one of.
00:03:58.954 - 00:03:59.338, Speaker D: Another.
00:03:59.386 - 00:05:03.948, Speaker B: Thing that I've been realizing is that, you know, a lot of people that are creating products in Web three, they think that by airdropping a token, people are going to care about their product. Meaning by giving some free money away, people are going to come back and hopefully participate in governance or hopefully find some issues within the community and contribute to the community. But that's not really how things work. People don't necessarily feel ownership over a protocol just by getting free money. Actually, I will argue that a lot of people, like, they have actually the, how would I say it? They receive some money and now they have the opportunity to complain as much as they can just because now they got money and now they feel that ownership.
00:05:04.116 - 00:05:04.772, Speaker C: Entitlement.
00:05:04.868 - 00:05:05.532, Speaker B: Yeah, the entitlement.
00:05:05.588 - 00:05:06.324, Speaker C: Entitlement.
00:05:06.484 - 00:05:21.636, Speaker B: That's the word that I was looking for. They feel entitled just now because they received those tokens and, yeah, essentially by receiving those tokens, that doesn't really mean that they are contributing and that they are part of the community and so on.
00:05:21.780 - 00:06:09.594, Speaker D: But today, like, you have to understand, like doing an airdrop is a massive way to get a community. I'm biased between, on one hand I've done a lot of airdrops and the other hand I see the negative consequences of that. So for some people, getting $6 worth of a token is enough for them to spend a four dollar gas transaction. Like why are you selling $6 worth of your airdrop every week, every Monday, save it up, do it once a month. But some people actually need this $2 in their life that it's warrant them wasting 60% of their airdrop to claim. And so. But precisely what do we do now to like, the airdrops were a very successful community building tool.
00:06:09.594 - 00:06:13.968, Speaker D: You have communities with 20,000 people because of these airdrops.
00:06:14.086 - 00:06:32.864, Speaker B: But are they really community? Are they really, you know, are they really part of the community? Are they really contributing? Or are they just there expecting to receive and then extract from you and then basically just dump it on the market and once the price goes down, they just complain about it? Are they really community?
00:06:33.404 - 00:06:36.604, Speaker D: I don't think so. I think that's definitely not what the community is.
00:06:36.644 - 00:06:55.536, Speaker B: That's the real question. So how do we create communities that they, you know, they help us shape the products that we're building? Because right now the way that it's done is like, as I said, dropping a token, and then these people feel entitlement, and they're like, always complaining about, oh, token price go down, blah, blah, blah.
00:06:55.640 - 00:06:56.284, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:56.704 - 00:07:30.284, Speaker D: Of course. Of course. The question I have is, like, if you have a very strong community, is a token inevitable? Like, we're trying to put the token first and hopefully it gets the community. But if you have a really strong community, naturally we're going to build a product for us. Naturally we're going to have some incentives to coordinate between us, and eventually that system of accounting will become a token. So I think we've approached it the wrong way. We've said, how about we just, like, give all of us a thousand tokens, then we're going to be friends? No, no, no.
00:07:30.284 - 00:07:40.724, Speaker D: I think it's the other way around. We build the community, we get the, we work out how we work towards as a community, then we work out what incentives, and then we become a token.
00:07:40.844 - 00:07:49.156, Speaker B: I think that the main issue is to identify what a community member is. And to me, a community member is.
00:07:49.340 - 00:07:51.812, Speaker E: Those people that are giving more than.
00:07:51.988 - 00:08:25.674, Speaker B: What they're taking or that they're contributing, you know, for the betterment of the group. And if you're acting on a very selfish way, then I wouldn't necessarily consider you that you care about the community. And I think that most of these airdrop hunters, or like, all of these people that are complaining about the price of the token and so on, they're not necessarily there for the best interest of the community, but rather for the best interest of their pocket.
00:08:27.214 - 00:09:23.340, Speaker F: Yeah, I agree. Basically what was just said, that it's important to start with a good product, because a lot of people in web three has the idea that web three will solve their problem with the token, that we will first create the token, and then we can avoid good values of the product or the, the product itself. But that's basically not the case. The nice example of it is probably arbitrum. They attract the community before they airdrop the token, and it's nice to see that the people are kind of sticky and they stay with arbitrum even after the airdrop. And, for example, in banclass, don't have any token, and still we have very strong community, and it's basically about the values.
00:09:23.532 - 00:10:24.114, Speaker B: But I would argue that in web three, you don't necessarily need to start with a product. You can start also with the community, you can start building basically values and start gathering people and explaining what your ideas are and start getting feedback from the community and start implementing that feedback. And actually that will help you, that could potentially help you decide how you're going to release your product or what is it that you're actually building or for who you're building. Usually the way that we do it in web three is that we have this idea of this product that is going to be used by the community. I just release it and then see what happens. I don't necessarily think that that's the best way of doing it. I think that in the future it's going to be way more valuable if you do the groundwork first, meaning you create a community, you work together with the community.
00:10:24.114 - 00:11:16.248, Speaker B: The community actually guides you in terms of what the parameters should be for your product, what percentage you should take in every transaction and so on. The community might, might guide you. I might give you the whole directions on what is it that they want and what is it that they're actually willing to pay for. So in the web two type of world, we definitely have this concept of building, putting it out there and break things fast. In web three, we cannot break things fast. Like when we're talking about money, when we're talking about identity, when we're talking about social contracts. We cannot do it in the same way as we did it.
00:11:16.248 - 00:11:16.840, Speaker B: In web two.
00:11:16.912 - 00:11:20.120, Speaker C: I believe we have testnets.
00:11:20.192 - 00:11:21.296, Speaker F: So it's.
00:11:21.400 - 00:11:26.884, Speaker B: Yeah, but testnets is not the same as a real, let's say, mainnet application.
00:11:28.404 - 00:12:08.088, Speaker E: I just don't think it's something that really is linked closer to web three. I mean, this works with everything. It has always worked with everything. It's worked with web two products as well. So you have an idea and you start building the community around the idea. You have some network, so you're starting from one, then three, five, and you're kind of building the community about the idea and you start pushing the idea and then you start developing. And the only difference, as you said, is that in web two projects, you can secretly build it and then just release it.
00:12:08.088 - 00:12:33.808, Speaker E: It's b, two, c or whatever. You have a product, you just wait for people to get it. But even in web two nowadays, it's more about the community, it's more about building the relationship with your customers. Only in web three, you know, it's a different terminology, but essentially, you know, web two, web three, it kind of goes the same direction.
00:12:33.896 - 00:12:56.504, Speaker C: I want to disagree. I don't think what we have in web two, what they call community is an actual community. In my mind, a community is a place where everybody is equal, right? Like, that's why, you know, when people say community building to me, like, it's like there's an error in that phrase, community building. Because community finding, or I call it like, I like to call it find.
00:12:56.544 - 00:12:58.604, Speaker D: The people who are your community.
00:13:00.504 - 00:13:29.292, Speaker C: I like to call it like a community facilitation rather than community building because community building, like the relationship is like inherently horizontal. I am building. You are going to work for me in a way. And the only way for a community to actually work is when everybody is equal. And I think a very good example for this is maybe the most successful online community, which is Wikipedia. Anyone can join, anyone can contribute, and no one is really earning money from this. Maybe a side of the Wikimedia foundation if you want.
00:13:29.292 - 00:14:00.448, Speaker C: It's a rabbit hole and it's terrible and they're making hundreds of millions of dollars a year and it's not really being used for good, but it separates from the Wikipedia website anyway. Like it has to be like what I call, or I mean, it's not me. It's like Alfred Adler, the psychologist, calls horizontal relationships where everybody feels equal, the conversation is equal, and people, you know, feel shares shared responsibility and shared ownership. I want to talk about tokens, but it's like another big rabbit hole. But yeah, maybe later.
00:14:00.576 - 00:14:57.002, Speaker G: So personally I'm not, I don't think I entirely agree that a community necessitates everyone, you know, being equal. And it's a good thing that, you know, you mentioned the Wikipedia example. I'm actually giving a talk tomorrow on, you know, the Wikipedia example and what we can learn about communities there. Wikipedia is very hierarchical, actually, even within that, you know, self regulating community. But I think that fundamentally a community requires, you know, group of people to have a shared identity that goes beyond products, that go on, goes beyond tokens, some shared values and principles that they can rely on. It's basically a group that people don't mind spending their time or money to join. Now, the thing with web three communities, or so called communities, are that they're basically cults.
00:14:57.002 - 00:15:48.806, Speaker G: But cults can be strong communities. There's different kinds of cults. The kind of calls that web three are, they're more like those MLM scams, you know, pyramid schemes. They're all singularly focused on collecting around, you know, making money that we are gonna, we are gonna pump and dump this token. We're all gonna get rich, which is fine, but does the single minded pursuit of money, riches actually lead to community building? I would argue no, that because, you know, and I'm no anthropologist or anything, but people say that, you know, basically that money becomes necessary where reputation and kinship does not work. So I'd say that, you know, money allows strangers to coordinate. Does it actually allow people, you know, who identify with each other to coordinate? I'm not sure about that.
00:15:48.870 - 00:16:17.424, Speaker B: But what if it's a community that actually has the values and actually the, let's say, the intention of making money or sharing alpha? You could argue that it is a community because they're sharing some, as you say, they have some kinship. They have some, let's say, sort of identity because they part of a cheat coin. Dao, for example. That's not a product, but it's a community.
00:16:17.544 - 00:16:19.364, Speaker G: It's a coordination mechanism.
00:16:19.544 - 00:16:52.154, Speaker D: You're not using that. We're specifically talking about making a product. And so we can have. One of the questions that I wanted to know is more that in Web three, it's a very specific example because we have proposals and daos and all that nonsense. And in web two, we have products. And so as a founder, if your product is not successful, you have two options. Raise more money or pivot.
00:16:52.154 - 00:17:37.834, Speaker D: And the question that I have in Web three is that at what point when you're building a community with the first five people and the first hundred, and then we get to 1000 and our product is not successful anymore, when we pivot, some of the community is not going to agree and somebody is going to agree, do something. And 60%. How do we align ourselves as a community to build products? And what happens when our products don't work? And what happens when a community shifts and not everyone agrees with the original vision? I think that is something that is affecting web three's ability to scale. And it's a reason why we have all these dead shitcoin projects from 2017 that are unable to iterate and refine their product.
00:17:38.134 - 00:17:45.794, Speaker B: And I have a question. Would you consider the token a product? Because to me, a token is a product.
00:17:46.174 - 00:17:52.646, Speaker D: I would say, like the example I'm most familiar with is sushi. So the sushi, let's go back to.
00:17:52.670 - 00:18:19.572, Speaker B: The one that we were saying before. Like the one that we were saying. He was saying that if it's about money, it might not necessarily be a community. So I came back with, with the arguing. And I like that. I like what you say, but I can, I could potentially argue that a community can be, let's say, a group of people that are actually making money. I can give the example of the cheat coin dao, where people put $100 in 2019.
00:18:19.572 - 00:19:00.124, Speaker B: Each of them put $100 without having any form of identity, without anything. And then they identity form after the fact that they put money together. And then the crazy part is that you might say that they don't have a product. But I would say, I would argue, yes, there is some form of product. And that's why I was asking, do you think that a token is a product? I personally think that it's a product. You can use the token as an incentive mechanism or as a way of growing your community or as a way of integrating or bringing more people in. So I definitely consider as a product myself.
00:19:00.564 - 00:19:39.924, Speaker G: So I think what you're saying makes sense. And I could even, like, come up with another example. Let's assume we started church and we have a commercial wing dedicated to making money so we can fund more infrastructure projects. And also in that case, we might have a community which is centered around making money for our other works. But I think that there's one more fundamental sort of issue at stake here. And that's what exactly is the purpose of what we call web three and all these decentralized mechanisms? No, it's arguable. And that's why it ties down back to financialization.
00:19:39.924 - 00:19:58.424, Speaker G: The reason is that the point of these systems, at least according to me, is to ensure coordination in a trustless manner. Trustless. That's why the financialization aspect and tokenization aspect is central to it. But if something is trustless, is it a community?
00:19:58.584 - 00:20:07.168, Speaker B: Well, that's what I was going to argue. I would disagree that in a place where there's no trust, there's no community. So.
00:20:07.296 - 00:20:14.324, Speaker G: Okay, that's a, you know, pretty. Yeah, Google. I'm sorry, I'm just saying, you know, that's a controversial statement right there.
00:20:14.624 - 00:20:33.394, Speaker B: I mean, if there's no shared values, as you said before, there's no real community, if everyone is just pushing for their side, basically everyone seeing everyone else as an adversary, not as someone to work with and collaborate and hopefully something bigger than themselves.
00:20:34.174 - 00:21:11.668, Speaker C: I want to say something. It might be like a little sideways, but a few weeks ago I was talking to someone. It was like in a group chat and someone was saying that he saw the term degen, right? And he didn't know what it meant. And then he researches and he was like, oh, it means decentral generation. And I was like, what? And it was like, yes, decentralized generation. You know, we are the people who listen have entered this space and we understand that, you know, it's better to trust decentralized system rather than centralized entities. And I'm like, holy shit, this is, like, the most wholesome thing I've seen in, like, the last year or two.
00:21:11.668 - 00:21:48.826, Speaker C: Like, in this entire space. And I was like, this is. It's amazing. And I think, like, you know, it's easy. I think, like, the space, it has, like, this mask where you see all the tokens going up and everybody's making money or losing money, and it's, like, very easy to get carried on to that. But if you go beyond that, there's, like, so many interesting things happening, whether, you know, it's the technology or the belief that we will be able to take the systems of the old systems and make them new here, only better and more transparent. And, like, with all the values that we believe in, the making money is obviously in the forefront of this.
00:21:48.826 - 00:22:13.316, Speaker C: But I think if you're here, you came because, oh, wow, I could make money. But then you're like, oh, wow, there's so much beyond this. Just money. There's so much beyond. There's so much technology. There's so many things that are happening and I don't know, are we the community of ETH Prague now? Are we a part of this? How are we contributing to this? And. Yeah, how will we contribute to ETH Prague to be able to exist even next year? So.
00:22:13.340 - 00:22:32.492, Speaker E: Yeah, well, I. You know, I'm just. I think we have to start. You were citing Adler earlier. I have. We have to accept that there is some kind of human nature, and the human nature is inherently, you know, it's all about me. I want.
00:22:32.548 - 00:22:33.916, Speaker B: I will disagree with you.
00:22:34.060 - 00:22:38.404, Speaker E: It's selfish. It's. Sorry. It's a. It's pretty much we.
00:22:38.444 - 00:22:39.224, Speaker B: We are.
00:22:39.724 - 00:23:10.832, Speaker E: But we have the potential as human beings to go beyond that. But we have to try and we have to exert energy to not be selfish. But this is a struggle of humankind. So, yes, we have this capability, but finding a community with inherently thinking that people will not be selfish is a flaw that you build inside of the community on the very start.
00:23:10.928 - 00:23:23.844, Speaker B: But I think that first I will argue that humans are one of the most collaborative, let's say, species on earth. And that's why we won as a species.
00:23:24.384 - 00:23:43.050, Speaker C: I want to say what you described is Moloch. Right? It's like the selfishness and how everything sort of, like, falls apart is Moloch, right? And I actually think. And I gave, like a. Like a. Yeah. I mean, a part of, like, you know, some of the characteristics of Moloch. And I think, like, community is the antidote to that.
00:23:43.050 - 00:24:20.700, Speaker C: And, you know, it's kind of like there's this notion that entropy is happening all the time, right? Like, you know, the world goes from order to disorder, and that's kind of like a notion that is, people believe that it's true. So how come we've built buildings? And so, like, true nature? Like, if there was, like, no human in humans in it at all, it would be like entropy. If things would fall apart. Like, with no one constructing, but the ability for us to collaborate, to form communities, to form groups, to form all these sort of like, building structures. That's what. Yeah, that's kind of like the battle against small, against entropy, against all these things. And it's.
00:24:20.700 - 00:24:41.738, Speaker C: And like, I agree with you that, you know, we're inherently selfish, and that's kind of like what? You know, like iron run. I want to maximize my own profit and stuff like that. But in a setting of a community, if the community is good and successful, then you give up on your own immediate returns for something greater, for more return in the future.
00:24:41.906 - 00:25:22.264, Speaker B: In an optimal world, I will argue that you'll do individually good, but also collectively good. So it shouldn't be only about the community or only about yourself, but it's just trying to find that balance, you know, that balance. That is hard. That is definitely hard. But I don't think a community will do good if they're only focusing on the community and not on the individual. A community. For them to really do good and actually prosper, I think they definitely need to focus the individual first and then the community as well.
00:25:22.604 - 00:26:01.010, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's actually true because web three or crypto itself is basically founded on the purpose that you can take care of yourself. You can be selfish, but it's actually good for the community as a whole. Because if, for example, in case of tokens, if you dump all of your tokens, you won't, like. You won't gain so much as you. If you hold tokens, I don't know, for a year, and the tokens would rise in price. And the mechanism like that. It's actually how the nature works.
00:26:01.010 - 00:26:17.114, Speaker F: I think that if the individual contributes to the community, it's actually good for himself or themselves because they can gain some protection and stuff like that. So I think that we don't really need prioritize.
00:26:18.254 - 00:26:47.634, Speaker D: One of the things, I want to bring it back to the product as well, because I think that's important. I think there's a distinction between what makes a community and what makes a web three product. So the vampire attack is a perfect example. One product and someone vampire attacked it. And now it's two products because it's the same code. It's nothing's different. It's just that one has this coin and one has that coin.
00:26:47.634 - 00:27:44.632, Speaker D: And people have aligned themselves over a different community. And so when we do have two different products in that way, we have to ask, like this new community, ignore the fact that there's 100,000 people in this discord. You know, this community is supposed to be innovating and developing and making differentiating products from the people they just walked from. And so as a community that we are now, you know, contributing, the question is not necessarily about me or the community. It's more about like how we adding value to the thing that we are trying to build. Like there's a subtlety that comes from building a product as opposed to just having an investment dow making decisions. I think when we are trying to build a product, we all have to, like Manu said, bring more than what we take.
00:27:44.632 - 00:27:52.484, Speaker D: And so if all we're taking is the financial extract or like the dividends, we're not actually contributing to the product and we're not actually building it.
00:27:53.684 - 00:27:54.060, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:54.092 - 00:28:37.088, Speaker B: And as I said before, I think that it's important that we also recognize what a product is because sometimes we are also using products in order for us to create the community. And we create funnels for bringing community. And if those products also don't work, then the community as a product doesn't work either. And I'm saying this is because we're using type forms, we're using these type of things. We're using notion and we're using all of these different tools for assigning tasks and so on. And these products are part of the community. They make the community.
00:28:37.088 - 00:29:10.154, Speaker B: And if they don't work, we don't have any community either. So first, I think we need to recognize that there are products that help us create the community. Then there are other products like tokens that might help us grow the community or incentivize the community to participate and so on. And there might be other products that the community also own. The community might decide how those products, let's say, evolve or how those products, let's say, charge you a fee, for example, or so on.
00:29:11.734 - 00:30:14.350, Speaker C: I think I want to talk maybe a little bit about tokens. I think we kind of, like, we, we kind of touched on this earlier and like you mentioned, arbitrum and I think arbitrum has done something interesting, right? They've had like arguably product market fit, right? You know, people are using the chain, it's working, and now they've airdropped tokens. I want to make the argument that, I don't know, maybe people at arbitrary won't agree with me, but I think it was a legal arbitrage move. Basically they like, they saw what's happening in the US and they had to do this immediately. It's not because they realized that, oh wow, we are good enough and we can decentralize and all of that stuff. And I think the thing I want to get to is that we have standardized these sort of like one year lock and four year vesting schedule for tokens, which I think it's like one of the most destructive standards or practices that we've had in this ecosystem. And I spend most of my time these days working and investing in startups.
00:30:14.350 - 00:30:28.874, Speaker C: And my take is to tell them, I know other VC's are going to tell you I'm not going to take more than four years of vesting, but I'm like, do it eight years. And if you do eight years of vesting, you'll see who are the VC's who are here for the short term and who are the VC's who are here for the long term.
00:30:29.974 - 00:30:57.214, Speaker B: I will say that lately I found out that a couple of VC's, they don't even give a fuck about the vesting because once the token is on perpetuals or options, they can already start shorting. They actually, it's so weird because they're investing in you, but at the same time they are betting against you because they're going to make more money betting against you. So the whole thing is already fucked.
00:30:57.954 - 00:31:21.924, Speaker C: It's important to say there are a lot of hedge funds in the space who are masquerading themselves as venture funds, a lot of them. And like, I think like generally the old professional VC, like you would see some money coming back in like probably like the best outcome after seven years if there's like an exit or something like that. In the, in another good case, twelve years. But in most cases you will never see any money.
00:31:22.384 - 00:31:31.030, Speaker D: So we need to bring it back to this community and the product. So how do the VC's fit in this community product building loop?
00:31:31.222 - 00:32:02.124, Speaker C: So this is such a difficult thing to sort of like figure out how VC's can participate. And I think, no, I don't think they can't. I think, you know, the, I mean, you I can attest for myself, but you probably have to ask my portfolio companies that I work with. Like, they'll say that I'm a part of their community, and I hope that I'm a part of their community. I don't know if my partners at the venture fund, you know, act the same as I do. I mean, they have different skill sets. I come from the world of community and I want to be a part of this.
00:32:02.704 - 00:32:10.644, Speaker D: But your personhood is contributing the funds. Your capital isn't the thing that is contributing.
00:32:12.384 - 00:32:16.336, Speaker C: I don't know. I think I will argue that, yes.
00:32:16.400 - 00:32:43.442, Speaker B: Capital is necessary in a world where we need to pay for shit. So yeah, they are contributing, but it's a different form of contribution. It's a contribution with an expectation of extraction at a multiple x, while a community member is contributing, not necessarily even knowing what is it that they're going to receive in return, and not necessarily knowing, okay, I'm going to receive a ten x or 15 x of what I contributed.
00:32:43.498 - 00:32:53.784, Speaker D: And the reason why we talk about contributing capital is because, to this gentleman's point, money gets involved when we cannot incentivize based on trust and reputation.
00:32:54.644 - 00:33:18.528, Speaker C: I mean, people need to eat, right? That's also a thing. Like, you're building a product. You, I don't know, you have a family, you have a house. You want to, you know, you want to eat. So money has to come from somewhere to pay for salaries. And, like, it's a, it's a very, like, I can tell you, like, but the thing is community building, we're getting.
00:33:18.576 - 00:33:44.624, Speaker D: Deeper into, like, you know, when you come to a community, you should come with no expectation, and you should be somewhat self sufficient to be able to contribute and add value. If it's a charity, dao, of course we're here. I need to get some work, please. I need to feed myself. But like, when you're honestly contributing to a community that before there's a product, we're just here to have a community. I think the money gets involved.
00:33:46.364 - 00:34:08.042, Speaker E: Two points. Firstly, good point. Because I'm in this discussion, this is all based on still parasitizing the web two society, because you are getting somewhere, the money, so you can be active in some community. This all just doesn't work as a whole.
00:34:08.228 - 00:34:31.398, Speaker B: Well, the main thing is that we're still in a system that is enslaving human beings and we need to work in order to put some food on the table and so on. So, because we are still in this trap, in this trap of trying to put some food in the table, then we need to take.
00:34:31.526 - 00:34:41.294, Speaker E: I'm sorry, I had another point. I totally disagree. Was the foundation of your ideas. I don't think working to create value is a trap. I think it's a blessing.
00:34:41.334 - 00:34:46.274, Speaker B: But I'm sorry. I didn't say that. I never said that.
00:34:46.854 - 00:35:22.624, Speaker E: But the other point was the VC's. Like, I'm part of a VC. I also invest as an angel. And that's what I try. I try to be part of the community before I do the investment. And even if we invest as a VC, like usually one of us, one of the team is part of the community because you kind of share somehow the company, the ideas, the projects.
00:35:25.884 - 00:35:29.004, Speaker B: Unless we have universal income for everyone.
00:35:29.704 - 00:35:30.444, Speaker H: Where.
00:35:39.624 - 00:35:47.724, Speaker B: Sorry to interrupt, guys. We have to be very strict with the schedule, so if we can wrap up in two, three minutes, then we have to prepare for the next one. Sorry.
00:35:53.614 - 00:36:29.854, Speaker H: Sorry. So, unless. Unless, like, I feel like in web three, we are very blessed because we made some money with our passions, but there are still, like many other people who are not as blessed as us or not where they were not so early as we were to the game, and then they don't have the opportunity to join us. But they have amazing ideas. They are so passionate about what they are doing. But, for example, they are working at the dry cleaners and then they are coding on the side, or they are working as, I don't know, shop assistant, but they are trying to, you know, like, provide for their family and do this stuff. So.
00:36:32.794 - 00:36:44.146, Speaker E: But that's. That's great. I mean. I mean, you can. You can draw these people into your team and just make them, you know, part of the community and of actually the working team. So I think that's great. Right?
00:36:44.250 - 00:36:47.934, Speaker H: Yeah, no, it's great. It's just the thing is that you have.
00:36:49.494 - 00:37:39.134, Speaker B: Sorry, we're going to end the panel. I'm sorry that this is very interesting conversation. We can keep going outside, but, yeah, in general, like, the conclusion that I can take from this conversation that we've been having here is that we need to differentiate what is a community member or what is a person that is there just to extract value from. From it and not actually contribute and generate more for the benefit of the community. And also, yeah, there are many different types of products. A token is a product on its own. And when we're creating products, definitely getting feedback from the community will benefit us and will help us.
00:37:39.134 - 00:38:00.424, Speaker B: Why? Because basically the community is going to be giving you the ideas on how or how they want to interact with the product. What is it that they want to do with the product? And, yeah, essentially, you will be building something that people will care about because they're part of it in the whole creation process.
00:38:01.004 - 00:38:28.024, Speaker C: I want to say another sort of thing here is that I think we're talking about community, but we also talk about money. And then the way these things interact with each other, it's like, I don't know, it's like a tornado in a volcano. It's kind of like it's a mess. Right? Like, huh? Yeah, like, it's. But, you know. No, but they're somehow separate, but somehow, like, so intertwined. Like you're a part of the community.
00:38:28.024 - 00:38:43.134, Speaker C: If someone else is earning money, I should also earn money. And it creates, like, weird dynamics. And I think this is like, yeah, maybe in the root of the discussion, how does money and community play together? And how does value that is being generated for a community flow back to its members?
00:38:43.994 - 00:38:44.306, Speaker E: So.
00:38:44.330 - 00:38:44.934, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:45.834 - 00:38:47.474, Speaker B: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us.
