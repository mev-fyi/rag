00:00:11.360 - 00:00:47.734, Speaker A: What's up everybody? How's everyone doing? So, yeah, my name is David. I want to talk about data, how it wants to be free, how we can disintermediate web3 and the data around it. So before I started, I'm gonna say kind of who I am. I'm a developer. I've worked on just a bunch of different kind of crypto blockchain projects over the past year. Also helped organize Liscon, which is a big conference we did in Lisbon back in the fall. That's me as a lizard at the lizard conference.
00:00:47.734 - 00:01:50.084, Speaker A: And yeah, so this project, sorry, this talk is related to kind of one of, of the, the main projects I'm working on now, which is crypto stats, a kind of project for open data metrics. But before I talk about crypto stats, I wanted to kind of like zoom out a bit and talk about what's the goal of blockchains in general, what makes blockchains really valuable. And I think if you ask most, a lot of people here, a lot of people in crypto in general, it's a decentralization, um, which, it's not wrong, but yeah, I see decentralization as um, it's an attribute of blockchains, but it's not really the goal. Like, decentralization gives us other things. And one of the, the most powerful things decentralization gives us is uh, disintermediation, you know, the ability to remove uh, kind of a central party from, from something. I think I have a definition, yeah. Removing control from privileged entities and.
00:01:50.084 - 00:02:59.248, Speaker A: Yeah, just to kind of give some examples, I wanted to go through the benefits of decentralization or, sorry, of disintermediation and how it's already applied to kind of what we've done so far in crypto. You know, when we disintermediate protocols or things, we get neutrality, you get predictability, which is really important for if you're going to build a business on top of a protocol, you remove counterparty, risk having to trust someone with your money or whatever. So yeah, let's go through how crypto is already disintermediated, removed trusted intermediaries. By the way, I picked graphics from cointelegraph because they have the coolest graphics. So here's a sexy bitcoin getting painted. You know, bitcoin, the original blockchain application, you know, it's, it's so powerful because it disintermediates kind of the power of the state to create money. You know, this intermediates from technology companies.
00:02:59.248 - 00:03:35.254, Speaker A: You know, we kind of almost had the potential for, like, Facebook to make money. And, you know, bitcoin removes the need for us to trust them. And bitcoin's always compared to gold, but even gold, you need to, like, if you want to move physical gold, you need to, like, hire companies and take them across, like, customs, you know, controls. So bitcoin removes the need to do any disintermediation in terms of value transfers. And that was the original really powerful idea of blockchains. Then we had Ethereum. Come here's Ethereum talking about himself on a television show.
00:03:35.254 - 00:04:41.648, Speaker A: Ethereum disintermediated the need to trust third party entities to run code. For you to have this unstoppable code that you could create agreements between two parties and not need a trusted third party to arbitrate those decisions. It gives you property rights. As I say, if we think of blockchains as kind of nations, these digital nations, property rights are super important for a nation. Nations that have strong property rights have strong economies. You can invest in a country with strong property rights. So really trustless, decentralized blockchain lets us have those properties, which lets us build these amazing economies, and then we can start building applications on top of, I think, the most simple but most powerful example of something built on a blockchain would be a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap.
00:04:41.648 - 00:05:39.858, Speaker A: So Uniswap, I think we kind of forget how game changing Uniswap was, because now dexs are everywhere. But if you go back to 2017, if you wanted to make a token and you wanted to buy and sell that token from people, you had to go to binance, you had to go to one of these centralized exchanges, and they would charge like $50,000 just to list your coin on their exchange. So with uniswap, all of a sudden, anybody can sell their token. Anybody can make a liquid market to buy and sell. The government or company or whatever can stop you from buying and selling tokens. So now we're kind of disintermediating, removing some of the need for the binances and the coinbases of the world. And then for ENS, I don't know why there's, I'm blanking on this guy's name, Mark Cuban, in front of a swear ENS name.
00:05:39.858 - 00:06:56.576, Speaker A: But I wanted to kind of put an example of where we're getting to now on how blockchains are disintermediating the world. And one way they're doing that is nfts. And I think ENS is a great example of an NFT that's already has a lot of utility, a lot of power, and also has a parallel in the existing world. What is ENS? ENS? ENS is a domain name. Everybody understands the value of domain names, but it's a domain name that's not controlled by one, you know, one organization because the DNS system is still kind of controlled by the US government at some level. So with ens, with kind of nfts like this, we're removing the need for parties to like issue and control digital assets and letting people create like this digital real estate. So, you know, again, I can kind of see what we're doing in blockchain as building up this stack of adding layers and disintermediating more parties, giving control, taking control from centralized parties and giving it to either the community at a large or to decentralized protocols.
00:06:56.576 - 00:07:28.436, Speaker A: And the thing that is really interesting to me is what comes next. We've disintermediated a bunch of sectors already. What can we disintermediate now? So this brings me over to kind of the stuff I've been working on for a bit, which all started with this website called crypto Fees. I guess it was crypto fee stats. You guys know this site, this is like the original version. It looks a little bit different now. It's still pretty similar.
00:07:28.436 - 00:08:08.810, Speaker A: But I originally made this, the ugly version of this back in 2020, in the middle of DeFi summer, when all of a sudden I noticed that uniswap fees were becoming competitive with even bitcoin. I was like, wow, that's really interesting. That's an underappreciated metric. So I made this site, I'm still running it. It's become popular as one of the most popular places to look at fee revenue. But running the site, I kind of like. Again, I made this site as just a side project, but I was running it, it was getting popular, and I started to kind of, kind of understand some challenges for running a site like this.
00:08:08.810 - 00:08:48.174, Speaker A: So first of all, every defi protocol was reaching out, wanted to be listed, they wanted me to get their data. And so there was a lot of work for me to kind of like, work with every defi protocol to get accurate data for them. On our website, there was disagreements about the data. I've gotten in some Twitter wars with people sometimes because they go, oh, you're. You're undercounting our data and you're only doing it because you want our token to go down or something like that. And finally people started reaching out companies, big companies, small hackers, whatever. They're like, hey, you have really cool data.
00:08:48.174 - 00:09:24.916, Speaker A: We want to put it on our website. We want to make news stories with it. How do we access this data? I felt like all this power was running through me to run this site. And I didn't really want that. I just wanted this site to be a public good that the community could look at and get access to good data. So I was becoming a trusted intermediary. So the problem I wanted to solve was, how do I remove myself from that position? What are the ways to kind of be a data product like this? I didn't want to.
00:09:24.916 - 00:10:25.934, Speaker A: There were a few approaches I didn't want to take with the site. Here's a screenshot from Nansen, which I don't want to be knocking on Nansen. It's an awesome site, but who can pay $30,000 for a data website? This is kind of, it seems to me like a web two data model, which is, we're going to take data, which data, again, you can share data for free. It doesn't cost you anything to give somebody data, but build a wall around it and say, oh, if you want to get past that wall, you need to pay a bit of money to do it. So I didn't really want to take that approach because, I mean, the reason crypto fees got so popular in the first place was user contributions being an open source project. The other way that can be popular to kind of monetize something with data is to kind of make it a part of a bigger organization. So this is Coinmarketcap, a screenshot from Coin market cap, which was a really, still is one of the most popular crypto data websites.
00:10:25.934 - 00:11:22.890, Speaker A: And a couple of years ago they got acquired by Binance. And shortly after they got acquired by Binance, BnB became the top defi token on their Defi token list. And I don't think BNB is a Defi token on the same scale as Chainlink and maker and compound, especially not at that time. I don't even know if Binance smart chain had even launched at that time. Seem like there may be, whether this was intentional or not, like you can see that there's a financial interest in binance using a data kind of property that they have to promote their own projects. So kind of being sponsored, being controlled by a larger, profitable company didn't seem like the right approach. But I think we're seeing this new approach, a new category of projects that are trying to take this other direction on how you can make data available.
00:11:22.890 - 00:12:04.244, Speaker A: And one of, I think, the best aligned projects is a site that I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen, Defi llama. So DeFi Llama is this awesome website. It's probably the most popular website today for tracking total value locked, which is one of the most popular data metrics. And they've taken the approach of saying it's going to be totally open source, it's going to be neutral. This data is a public good. This is something that people who are in crypto, in DeFi, in web3, they need access to this data, and we want to find a way to make that available. I included this really good screenshot of zero x Ngmi, the guy behind Defi llama.
00:12:04.244 - 00:12:57.814, Speaker A: What was he saying here? People going, oh, why are you adding Cardano to defi llama? And he's like, we'll add anything. It's not a data site to go, what project is good and bad? That's the individual's decision to interpret data however they wish. So what I'm hoping to do is I've created this project called cryptostats, where I think we want to take this idea of open source, community, run data and take it to the next level. So what we do with crypto stats, this is kind of where I see us in this pipeline of how data goes from being data on a blockchain. Data all starts on a blockchain itself. You've got the blockchains themselves, you've got DeFi applications. Basically, you've got a bunch of transactions, events, calls, raw data.
00:12:57.814 - 00:13:27.964, Speaker A: Next step is you need something to index it. You need nodes, powerful computers, databases that are going to comb through all this data, organize it into some schema. So the biggest one by far is the graph. We're huge fans and users of the graph protocol. There are some things the graph still can't quite do yet. We still pull data from things like coinmetrics, which is a more centralized company that provides data. We pull some data from zerion, things like that.
00:13:27.964 - 00:14:21.594, Speaker A: But this is, I think, one layer, which is the infrastructure layer of aggregating blockchain data and turning it into something that's more easily accessible. And then is where crypto stats comes in, which is you've got all this data in different places, you've got different subgraphs, you've got different websites, API endpoints, things like that. It's in different formats. You need to take that data, do a bit of aggregation, not batch aggregation, not combing through tens of thousands of transactions. Do some aggregation and give a normalized result that you can take any query for any project that's supported and get an output that looks the same for any project. So that's where crypto stats fits in. And then what we try to do with this is make it available to anyone at the presentation layer.
00:14:21.594 - 00:15:22.616, Speaker A: The last layer before data gets to the consumer is someone making an awesome website, some awesome data visualization, some really cool app, something that presents this data to the user and tries to figure out the best way to communicate it. And so our goal is to make all this data open and free and hopefully have lots of competition of people about who can present this data the best way they can. And so I'll dive a little bit more into the technical side of how we try to do this, what cryptostats is right now it's quite simple. Every protocol on crypto fees is in these data collections we have, and each one is represented by an adapter. So this is some sample code for the tornado cache adapter. So adapter is just a piece of JavaScript. You can see this one here is doing a query to the graph protocol.
00:15:22.616 - 00:16:09.010, Speaker A: We define a graphql query, we query this tornado cache subgraph, give it some dates and block numbers, whatever. We end up subtracting the fees from one day against the fees from the other day, and then that's the fees for tornado cache for that day. Pretty simple piece of code. We've also got a bunch of metadata at the bottom. So the goal is to have a bunch of these adapters. They're all stored on ipfs, kind of indexed on chain, and that way anybody can pull what are basically instructions on how to get the best data. And I think of it kind of like Wikipedia.
00:16:09.010 - 00:17:15.424, Speaker A: If somebody sees a better way to a better data source or a better way to calculate data, they can come in and update that. And then here's kind of the internal process of how a website would use crypto stats data is that as I said, there's kind of like an on chain registry of these adapters for each collection. So you kind of query those adapters or query the list of adapters which are just a bunch of IPFS identifiers, get the adapters from ipfs, those adapters execute the code to reach out to the graph or wherever the data source is. And then you kind of bring that data back to your website and you can display it however you'd like. But we have a JavaScript SDK that does all that for you. So here's ten lines of JavaScript for how you could get the crypto fees, data, the fees on a certain day with, again, I think a super simple amount of code. Yeah.
00:17:15.424 - 00:17:53.666, Speaker A: Here's kind of one of these collections. So it's a bunch of protocols, bunch of data. And as I mentioned, we want anybody to be able to contribute to this data. As I was saying before, I don't want to be the one going in building every adapter for everything. That makes me like the central point of failure. So if anybody can come in, they can read the code, they can understand how data is generated, and if they want to edit it, if they see an improvement, that they can be, can be made. We've got this really cool editor.
00:17:53.666 - 00:18:36.994, Speaker A: It's like an ide, but it's right in your browser. So you can go in there, update the adapter and test it out and kind of pull, publish it back to the community so that the community can update it if they need to. So that's kind of where the project's at now. But the goal is to not just provide these adapters, but to provide any tooling or infrastructure that's helpful to making data open and available for everybody. So these are kind of some other. We're working on some things with the graph protocol to make it easier to build subgraphs. We want to support more than just the graph protocol, like any indexer that exists.
00:18:36.994 - 00:19:49.334, Speaker A: We want to support people who are building websites, building data sites, making it so that they have the tools, resources and support needed to build really cool websites. And eventually the goal is to turn this into a DAO, to really give the governing control over where, you know, which adapters get chosen and how do funds get distributed to data projects into a Dao itself. So if you thought any of this was interesting, if you kind of are interested in our vision of like, a world where, you know, all the crypto data is open and free to everybody, and, you know, everybody is contributing to it. Would love for you to join us. We've got, you know, discord, all the usual kind of community stuff. We're looking for technical people to help build this out and of course, non technical people as well, to help build this community. And if you're hacking this weekend and you want to, you're building something data related, whether it's a site that generates data, uses data, presents data, then would love to have you building on our stuff.
00:19:49.334 - 00:20:03.764, Speaker A: Yeah. If you're interested in that, reach out to me, come find me around here. Or you can reach out on our discord or something like that. So, yeah, thank you guys so much, I guess we'll open it up to questions.
00:20:15.264 - 00:20:26.282, Speaker B: Okay, there's a mic for questions from the audience. Does anyone have any questions? Raise your hand and stand. Stand up and we'll get a microphone to you. Okay, we've got a question in the front row.
00:20:26.458 - 00:20:31.614, Speaker C: What is your adal strategy? What are you already doing to implement that? Can you unfold a little bit there.
00:20:32.114 - 00:20:35.194, Speaker A: In terms of governance system?
00:20:35.274 - 00:20:38.374, Speaker C: What are you doing? How it's happening?
00:20:38.994 - 00:21:40.454, Speaker A: That part is still not super planned out. We have a channel in our discord where we've discussed the different Dao tooling and stuff like that. I definitely want to make sure that I think structuring daos is an area that there's been not as much innovation as I hoped. So I'm excited about stuff like element finance and optimism. Some of these projects that are trying structures that are more than just, oh, we're going to do coin voting, things that do kind of delegate power to different groups, to individuals if necessary. We've talked about stuff like optimistic governance, kind of the idea that because, again, most people are going to behave correctly the first time, you can kind of delegate people power and have some recourse in the event that they behave poorly. Obviously, this is similar to how optimistic roll ups work, but again, element finance is one project that's trying to apply that to governance.
00:21:40.454 - 00:21:46.234, Speaker A: We've got some cool ideas, but again, it's still kind of an open discussion for the community to figure out.
00:21:48.854 - 00:21:50.834, Speaker B: Okay, we've got a question in the middle.
00:21:54.774 - 00:22:08.664, Speaker D: Hi. So is your data source currently mostly depending on the graph? Does that mean if graph, since graph does, the graph protocol doesn't support. That's a kind of constraints of what you cannot correct.
00:22:09.084 - 00:22:32.236, Speaker A: So I'd say most, the goal for having open, trustless data is to pull from the most open, trustless data sources. And I think right now, usually that's the graph. The graph is. Most sub graphs are open. Anybody can run their own subgraph. If I want to run the uniswap subgraph on my server, I can do that. I can change it.
00:22:32.236 - 00:23:15.024, Speaker A: I can view the code. They're moving to this decentralized protocol where it's not even just the graph that's running the servers, but we don't want to be constrained by the graph. As you said, there's a lot of data, for example, data from the cosmos ecosystem. I know the graph is adding support, but generally we can't get data from the graph for the cosmos ecosystem. We can pull from any endpoint, any HTTP endpoint, if it's centralized, decentralized, we can pull from wherever, but the goal is to find the most trustful but also trustless sources of data to pull from. Thank you.
00:23:15.064 - 00:23:16.444, Speaker B: Okay, we've got another question.
00:23:18.384 - 00:23:38.604, Speaker E: Hi, just one question. So if I understood you correctly, your adapters currently are only geared towards crypto fees, right? So if I have a subgraph, which is for my application, which has nothing to do with DeFi, which is some real world application, and I want to pull data, can I use your adapters or do I have to write my own adapter for that?
00:23:39.624 - 00:24:27.990, Speaker A: So if you want to pull data that's like unrelated to like crypto, defi to defi stuff. So you can build, I mean, anybody can build any adapter. Like you saw we have this editor, you can build an adapter like if you think it's a useful tool, you can build it and you can publish to ipfs and you can import it into your site. So there's adapters, which anybody can create, and then there's this adapter registry which is kind of r curated list of adapters that we as a community think are trusted and accurate. So there's no reason you have to use our adapters. You can make your own adapters and load them in, but if you want to, what we're hoping to do is encourage people to submit adapters to our collection and we'll include them.
00:24:28.182 - 00:24:35.194, Speaker E: Is there a general skeleton that I can just adapt for different subgraphs or I have to build the adapter from scratch?
00:24:35.534 - 00:24:55.614, Speaker A: You have to build it from scratch. But again, I showed some of the code. The code is a simple adapter, is 50 lines of typescript, and you can look at all the existing ones and kind of figure out from there. If you're just querying the graph, then it's a pretty simple adapter to do that.
00:24:56.154 - 00:24:56.722, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:24:56.778 - 00:24:57.614, Speaker A: Yeah, no worries.
00:25:00.794 - 00:25:06.754, Speaker B: Ok, any more questions from the audience? Ok, then I have a question if I may.
00:25:06.834 - 00:25:07.574, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:25:07.954 - 00:25:21.374, Speaker B: I know we're jumping around a little bit here, but you touched a little bit on moving on from coin voting. I know it's a tough question, but where do we move on to from coin voting? Can you share some thoughts on that?
00:25:21.454 - 00:25:55.250, Speaker A: It's a good question and I certainly don't have the answer, but in crypto we certainly like to really reinvent things from a base level. So I think the end game of how on chain governance, and not just governance but on chain communities look is probably similar to the way organizations work in the real world, right? Like corporations have coin voting. You have share, you know, shareholders that can vote on things, but typically one thing they do is they. They vote for the board. The board kind of selects executives. Executives hire people. Like, you have kind of this whole organization tree.
00:25:55.250 - 00:26:01.178, Speaker A: And so if I had to guess, I'd say that's probably kind of the end state for kind of digital organizations as well.
00:26:01.266 - 00:26:06.678, Speaker B: Okay, so, like, replicating existing traditional organizations, but just on chain. On chain governance.
00:26:06.766 - 00:26:42.164, Speaker A: Yeah, but with more transparency, more control, of course, it's really hard to do shareholder voting. It can happen once a quarter. Things are not very transparent. So we can certainly use the new tools we have available to try to be more efficient and to maybe do some things that wouldn't be possible, like liquidity mining. That's not related to governance, but that's something you can't do with stock shares, but you can do with crypto. But in terms of organizing people, I think crypto doesn't really change the need for people to have some level of organization.
00:26:43.664 - 00:26:46.768, Speaker B: Cool. Okay, thank you very much, David.
00:26:46.856 - 00:26:47.224, Speaker A: Thank you, guys.
