00:00:33.444 - 00:00:39.764, Speaker B: Been a great experience and really fun conference. This is the first time I'm here and it's a really awesome event. Happy to be here.
00:00:39.924 - 00:01:05.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the most that I enjoy is people, because networking is just beautiful here. So many talented, enthusiastic people that I've met from different countries, so many diverse cultures, and especially people who are hacking. It's very interesting to get to know their projects and this magic, how they can create something in like three days from nothing.
00:01:11.834 - 00:01:34.004, Speaker B: It's my first time in the ETH conference in Prague and yeah, the most exciting thing is just to see how many protocols there are up and coming, what they're doing with their ecosystem. And I look, I'm also really looking forward to not only the developing side of it, but like, how they are catering artists into the space.
