00:00:01.960 - 00:00:38.526, Speaker A: Hello everyone, welcome to my presentation. I'm Tao Yan. I'm from the usage Blockchain center and the blockchain distributed nature group. Today I'm going to present this research called multilayered NFT watch trading, leveraging sequential transaction features. And this work is collaborated with Doctor Seungman and also my professor Claudio. Here is the outline of this presentation. Let's first go to the have a brief introduction of the nfts.
00:00:38.526 - 00:01:21.084, Speaker A: So nfts are the non fungible tokens. And all these nfts are unique, which means they are not replaceable and interchangeable. So there are three nfts, corrected and different colors. They are not equal. But in this work we are more focused on the unique ownership of this NFT. Which means at a specific time, each NFT just belongs to one unique user. This is very important in this research to detect the orchestrated the ostradis.
00:01:21.084 - 00:02:13.478, Speaker A: So what is OSH trading? It comes from the traditional finance. Trading is a market manipulation strategy where an investor can repeat sales and buy the same asset for multiple times. And this activity will lead to the misleading market activities. So they will create artificially create more invented. The tradings like to deceive other users to believe. Yes, these nfts are popular, but actually they are not. So this blockchain and this unique ownership of NFT provide us opportunity to detect this NFT was trading.
00:02:13.478 - 00:03:01.414, Speaker A: Why? You see in the left column there is a transactions on the blockchain. And in the mid column, this is a marketplace. This marketplace is also unchained. Like the opensea, they have this NFT are traded here and they record the price of nfts. And so we combine these transactions and also the price information. And then we use the network to represent the trading and the transactions of the nfts. But here I think it's notable that for these transfers we are talking about, they are not just about the trading.
00:03:01.414 - 00:04:14.716, Speaker A: It can be also the transfers between two addresses which there is no price. So like I sent the NFT as a gift to my friend and there is no price information. Okay, so here we focused on each history transactions of each NFT and we represent the transaction history as a network for each NFT. Here I want to talk about more about this sequential transaction feature, what it exactly means. Here is a table which shows there are two transactions of this ByC NFT and their token id is 1020. But they have different addresses of the sender and the, and the recipient. What means this sequential transaction is that the sender of the next NFT transaction is always the recipient of the previous transaction.
00:04:14.716 - 00:05:33.684, Speaker A: So this can construct a chain of the ownership change. I think this is very different for NFT comparing with ERC 20 tokens, because ERC 20 tokens are fungible tokens and you don't know, like the ERC 20 you hold and you send it to other people, and other people will also get the same fungible tokens from the third people. So, but the NFT will not have this globally, every NFT just belongs to a unique user at a specific time. Here comes to the research question. So our main research question is that how to effectively detect the odds tradings like for NFT in the whole lifecycle of the NFT. And we are also interested in if there are any traders, they are involved in different, multiple or multiple nfts. For the watch trading activities, we collect the data from the archive load which we are running in our group.
00:05:33.684 - 00:06:31.104, Speaker A: And in this research we focused on the bought app Yacht Club shortening code is BYZ, which is very popular and has the highest trading volume among all the nfts. Here we collect all these transfer events from the start of this NFT to May 4 of 2023. And we also collected the price information from multiple NFT marketplaces. This including Opensea, Bernard, and also the Nux, Raw and x two, y two. In total, we have got around around 200,000 transactions and 40 and 34,000 prices information. Yeah. Here, as I said before, this price is not every transaction will have this price information.
00:06:31.104 - 00:07:46.684, Speaker A: Here comes to the method storage part. So how can we finally detect the NFT watch trading? The basic idea is still we leverage the sequential transaction feature of these nfts and it contains three steps. The first step is we convert these transactions into array, which just includes the sender and the receiver address, but they are in the time order. And the next step is that we start from the first address and we detect the cyclical structure. So the cyclical structure is that from the array, we check which are the first place, which are the first addresses are repeated. So like for ABCA and. Yeah, we found a are the first addresses repeated? If we have ABC B, and then B is the first address repeated.
00:07:46.684 - 00:08:26.004, Speaker A: And we also check after this repeated address. If that address also occurs before. Yeah, if it occurs before. We also included that address into the first cyclical structure. After we detect the first cyclical structure, we have the first spices NFT watch treating. And then we want to see if this watch trading continues happening in this NFT. So we detect the multilayers.
00:08:26.004 - 00:09:13.600, Speaker A: So we following the similar logic as detecting the first layer. But this step increases. Another additional state is to check whether this address has already appeared in the previous measure. We have some result to using these measures, we have generated some results. I think the first result is to generally show the dynamics of the NFT. NFT connection trading histories. So here we visualized the number of nfts traded by each day, and also the number of transactions and also the trading volumes in ETH.
00:09:13.600 - 00:10:11.956, Speaker A: And also how many traders for each day too they are trading this NFT. What is interesting from this plot is that the number of traders involved is always much lower than the number of trading the transactions. So this is so ideally, because each transaction you have, you will have two traders. But here we found the trader, the number of traders is smaller than the number of the transactions. So what happens here? Yeah, if we look at this plot, it will be more easier to understand. So ideally, because each transaction will have two traders, the number of traders will go linearly increase with this number of the transactions. But here in actually, you see there are two blue line and the yellow line.
00:10:11.956 - 00:11:04.496, Speaker A: But the number of traders are smaller than the number of transactions. So what happened here is that in these NFT transactions, some traders repeatedly buy and sell these nfts. And yeah, it needs to the total number of these traders reduced. And also here it indicates there are cycles inside of these transaction networks. Here we visualize that there are two NFT transaction networks. We do find that there are some cycles inside of this single NFT transaction networks. So here we want to give our definition in our work about what is NFT watch trading.
00:11:04.496 - 00:12:16.372, Speaker A: In the context of network watch trading means the circles with price increasing. Here we have a simple network to show the OSH trading happened in one of the nfts. In this connection, the NFT is 4200. And if you look at the plot, it starts from the point in orange and go through the cycle, you see the price, which is the small number of the edge, and it continues to increase. And finally, it increased more than 30 times for this NFT. But here we are more interested in the whole, the whole records of these watch trading activities in a single NFT. So we detect the multi layer watch tradings.
00:12:16.372 - 00:13:09.428, Speaker A: So here, what means nayer? The nayer is means. So firstly, we start from the cyclical transaction, which is in the lowest in Berlin, in the blue color. Yeah, this is a cyclical structure and this is the first layer. And so when is this first layer stopped? When you found, there is a new address which didn't appear before. So it's the end of the first layer and then it continues to grow when they find the next cyclical structure. And it also finds there is a new twitter and it starts and it stops again. This is the second layer.
00:13:09.428 - 00:13:57.738, Speaker A: So it continues to grow. And finally for this NFT we found that there are four layers and all layers demonstrate the dynamic waste trading activities through the lifespan of a single NFT. Here we also have some results for the features of this NFT watch trading activities. The left panel shows these watch trading activities are centralized in the lower layers. So if the layers is smaller. Yeah, they have more. These nfts are more happened are more likely happened on these layers.
00:13:57.738 - 00:14:56.844, Speaker A: But if you also you can have this like around 80 layers for a single NFT. The right panel shows some time features of the NFT transaction of the watch readings. So basically you can find average length of the duration of the initial layer is 42 days. Yeah. And then we want to find if there are some traders like they are involved in multiple NFT oil trading activities. So we use a key core in the network science to identify so who are the in the core groups for each NFT network. Here we start from the three core structure and then we continue as four core structure.
00:14:56.844 - 00:15:38.180, Speaker A: Here we find some addresses which is showing in the xx. You can see the first address which ends 27, 62. It involved 338 nfts in this connection. And we also have other addresses. So here we just show the top ten addresses who involved most of these NFT watch treaties. Yeah. Let's make a brief conclusion of this work.
00:15:38.180 - 00:16:54.920, Speaker A: So we leverage the sequential transaction to detect the watch trading. And we found there are multilayered watch trading patterns in this ByC NFT collection. And to use this method we can avoid to have abundant these cycles are in term because the previous research they use the deep first search or the brief first search to using these methods they will have abundant of cycles. But in our work it just will return the whole life lifespan of the NFT transactions of a single NFT. Finally, there are some take home messages out of these 10,000 nfts, around 5000 entities involved in OS trading. And among these ostrade nfts, around 3000 nfts have multilayered ostrich importance. And finally we identified zero 183 traders.
00:16:54.920 - 00:17:04.204, Speaker A: They participate in multiple NFT watch tradings. That's for my presentation. Thanks for your attention.
00:17:11.464 - 00:17:14.324, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Do we have any questions from the audience?
00:17:17.624 - 00:17:34.993, Speaker C: Thank you for the presentation. So my question is about the what happened next? Like you identified 180 watch writers, right? Did you do any further actions like report them to somewhere and like some kind of institution like police or whatever?
00:17:36.253 - 00:17:44.513, Speaker A: Sorry, I don't know if I understand your question correctly. You mean do we report these twitters? Yeah. No.
00:17:45.093 - 00:17:49.673, Speaker C: What happens next? Like you identified them and what now?
00:17:50.164 - 00:18:17.424, Speaker A: Yes, I think it's very interesting to see who are doing this frequently doing these activities, but currently we are doing this research work. So we will publish this work like in some conference or journals. But yeah, currently we didn't think where we can public these addresses. I think finally we can generate this data set and this data set can be public. Yeah.
00:18:23.724 - 00:18:27.504, Speaker B: Can you just please wait for the mic? Yeah, there is a volunteer coming.
00:18:28.044 - 00:18:35.744, Speaker D: So you just checked for direct transfers of nfts and without any transfer of Ethereum or anything back.
00:18:37.684 - 00:18:39.340, Speaker A: Sorry, can you repeat your question?
00:18:39.412 - 00:18:55.914, Speaker D: So for example, I was just looking lately in all the kind of NFT wash trading and I was there's a group, they bought private apes, they send it to another address and then they get exact amount of Ethereum into their wallet back.
00:18:56.574 - 00:18:57.142, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:57.238 - 00:19:00.750, Speaker D: Did you include actions like this or not?
00:19:00.942 - 00:19:04.206, Speaker A: You mean they traded on different marketplaces?
00:19:04.350 - 00:19:10.680, Speaker D: No, direct transfer and direct transfer of Ethereum in not over the marketplace.
00:19:10.822 - 00:19:50.744, Speaker A: You mean self transferred? Yep. Yeah, yeah. We have include this. So if person come the same person, they bite and they also can be, can send this NFT to himself. But in this case this is just a self loop and we have this in our, we can't detect this in our data set, but we, for the results we excluded that. Yeah, because in this part they didn't like to involve other traders and users.
00:19:56.204 - 00:19:58.904, Speaker B: Any other. Oh yeah. There is one more question right there.
00:20:00.564 - 00:20:20.834, Speaker E: Hi, I'm just curious if there are any implications from your data that for example, traders that involve in multilayered watch trading profits more than the traders that involve only in one layer of watch trading. Is there any implications from your data?
00:20:21.694 - 00:20:47.036, Speaker A: This is a very interesting point. Currently we didn't check if they will proof it more to have this multiple layers. But we do. But we, yeah, for sure we can, we can do that because we have the data for each trader and how many price they have increased by these activities. Yeah, I think later I can, I will generate these results.
00:20:47.100 - 00:20:47.864, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:20:48.404 - 00:20:49.344, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:20:50.604 - 00:20:57.964, Speaker B: Are there any other questions? No? Then please give another big round of applause to teo. Thank you so much for your talk. Thanks.
