00:00:01.600 - 00:00:21.554, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Nice to be here. Nice to see some familiar faces here as well. So I'll be speaking about how can we empower. Thank you. Can I see my. Okay.
00:00:21.554 - 00:01:53.834, Speaker A: And can I see my notes? It's okay. It's okay. So it's fine. So, yeah, so we're gonna talk about how can we empower nature by make, like, acknowledging its sovereignty through technology, innovation and human stewardship, and how this is important for us or as a partnership for us, for changing the relationship that we have, the relation that we have with natural resources in nature itself. So first I want to talk about what sovereignty means, right? So, sovereignty means self governance. And I think everyone here knows a little bit about governance and it's really understanding their complexity, because nowadays in our society, we really. We see the natural resources as just assets, right? And if it's not something that you can feed the economical system, there's no value.
00:01:53.834 - 00:02:55.110, Speaker A: And because of that, we have all these problems we have now. So mass extinction, we have degradation of nature, etcetera. And in contrast with that, we do have, like, traditional communities or indigenous communities that saw nature as sovereignty, as our own entity. And because of that, they see each other as stewards, and they saw nature as a vital part of our society or their societies. And, yeah, so one thing that is very important to realize is that I really like technology. And I think technology is something that can really help us. And it's not the end goal, because some people say, oh, technology is something, you know, that's the problems that we created, that is used technology to fix the problems you created.
00:02:55.110 - 00:04:07.734, Speaker A: But I see that more as a tool, as a very powerful tool. And we have very advanced tools nowadays for that to actually get the goal of biodiversity restoration. And imagine a local community, or that they have smartphones or even paper and pencil to check or gather data from the forts that they do. And with this, they can really push forward a new way of funding their efforts or being supported with the things that they need, with education and everything else, because in this way, it kind of like you started flipping the economics of funding biodiversity. I want to talk a little bit about sovereign nature initiative. That's where I work in right now. And we created two ways of dealing with this data or this eco data that stewards produce.
00:04:07.734 - 00:05:01.574, Speaker A: One is the deep protocol. So deep protocol is a protocol that links the echo data to digital assets in a way that creates a circle of funding for stewards and efforts around the world. And besides that, we also have the real portal. That's where actually story happens or is the stories, history and engagement happen. So everyone has an asset. With the echolinket asset, they can see which animal is directly connected to that asset, or the land and the stores, the people that are working with it. So it's really like a way of creating this relatability that's so important when you're dealing with biodiversity or restoration.
00:05:01.574 - 00:05:24.134, Speaker A: This is probably everybody knows. And I think it's very important to say also about the work that we do. So RWA means, you know, real world assets. But for us, there's a different meaning. For us. It's really about real world animals. And it's really, you know, it's about life, and it's about acknowledging this life.
00:05:24.134 - 00:06:10.914, Speaker A: There are entities like the self entities, because for us, and it's really our belief, and that underpins everything that we do, it's that life is not an asset. And that's why we tried everything that we do to other people to understand that when you give agency to nature, that you see them as something else than just an asset. But besides technology, there is something very important for us that is community. And without the community, it's really hard for us to push forward the environmental efforts that we want to do. That's why we say that human stewardship is so important. So these are all projects that we work with our partners. So we have like, Kenya, Costa Rica, Romania and Portugal.
00:06:10.914 - 00:07:08.918, Speaker A: And through the things that we do, you know, that's how we do change. Because it's about education, it's about engagement, it's about really giving them the tools and the knowledge, or exchanging knowledge for them, be able to provide or do the efforts or the actions they are doing on land. And just to give an example, because I've been talking about very conceptual things. So I'm going to just give examples. How can you use this echo data and connect to assets and how they can translate in impact for them? So this is a project that we did with engieving the energy company. And the idea here was like their CSR program or the CSR department wanted to promote their environmental efforts in Dakla Bay in Morocco internally to all their employees. So what they created was we created these echo badges through the data that we collect.
00:07:08.918 - 00:07:52.052, Speaker A: So that's why also art is so important for us. That's why we try to create, like, artistic pieces. So an artist is also a data science. Collected data from the stewards, from the deep protocol as well. And from that she created all these badges. We create like twelve badges that was distributed for the employees and create an engagement and for the local community working there, these translating in them reorganize themselves to push some policies to preserve the bottleneck dolphin in the Dakar Bay in Morocco. Another example that we have that it's supposed to be a video, but it's like those, like we did with wallet Connect.
00:07:52.052 - 00:08:35.136, Speaker A: So those call sound waves. So for the launch of the web3 inbox, they wanted to present or celebratory nfts for all the alphas. We started using their new feature of messaging for wallets. And this is. So the artists also create a whole video from the conversation of Wales in the Caribbean. And with that, so the h one got like a frame of this video as a celebratory NFT as well. And the impact that this had that they were able to hire new people to work like local people to work in this restoration and preservation efforts as well.
00:08:35.136 - 00:10:01.232, Speaker A: The third like little example that we're going to do is about like this post that we did for Polkadot sub zero last year, because they wanted to engage the people, their public, into environmental efforts and make something different from just a poop, so they can see what's like, they do things also for sustainability. So we created these whales and dolphins po ops that could go from rare to legendary and like basic nfts or pops. And they also like the people who got the legendary, they also got a trip to sea with the researchers from Portugal, like the whales and the dolphins research and with that as well. So the people who work on the field, with this, the aim, the stewards, they were able to expand their education program about the preservation of whales and dolphins in Portugal. So this was just a little examples on what we could do with this echo data. Those are all small pocs, like proof of concepts that we did, because we still like expanding and experimenting and seeing what is possible with this technology here. Nowadays, everyone has their AI generated pictures in the presentation, so I also don't have mine here.
00:10:01.232 - 00:11:05.376, Speaker A: But it's just. Just to say that it's been said that data is the oil of the 21st century. So the idea is really to use this data for a good use. And I think that even though they can sound like Zootopian, I think that it's the technology is there, it's able to do it for. You can really fund biodiversity restoration and trying to create new ways of integrating financial systems with ecological systems as well. And it's really about not seeing nature as just a backdrop of society, but it's really an active participant of it and creating a way for us all to restore biodiversity mainly. This was really short talk because probably, you know, I didn't have my notes with me, but anyway, I can talk to you more and explain the technology here in my QR code.
00:11:05.376 - 00:11:21.214, Speaker A: You can check our website. There's the white paper there, there's all my contacts there. And it's really idea of creating an eco crypto techno artistopia of, you know, from what we have from helping biodiversity restoration. Thank you.
00:11:22.314 - 00:11:34.106, Speaker B: Thank you. And we have a lot of time to ask questions, if there are any. Please. Yeah.
00:11:34.130 - 00:12:10.854, Speaker A: So now would you say that nature is data as well? What do you mean by nature? So the data that we get is from the stewards and they could be from track patterns, could be threats, could be behaviors, could be number of individuals in the species, could be sounds also that's very important for preservation, restoration. So it could be any kind of data that it's important for the work they are doing on field. Okay. Yeah, mainly.
00:12:14.294 - 00:12:16.674, Speaker B: Thank you anymore. Okay.
00:12:17.614 - 00:12:18.390, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:12:18.502 - 00:12:42.694, Speaker D: Thanks for the amazing presentation. I hope to understand more, like the fund raised to help the nature. Like, how would it do it need to go back to fiat and then like to go into the projects because, like, the normal world is still web two. Right. And how does it go like, so.
00:12:43.194 - 00:13:09.616, Speaker A: The projects that we work with. So it's a very small scale. So of course, the deep protocol, they directly send the money for the stewards, but they had to, of course, off ramp it. That's the way it is right now. And we help them, of course, doing that. So that's, we work directly connect with them. So all these projects that we see, we work with, we know them personally, we go there, we do research with them.
00:13:09.616 - 00:13:37.634, Speaker A: We have a head of field research in our team as well who does that. So we have a personal connection with them to also help them because they are not web3 at all. Some are more tech savvy, let's put this way, or more integrated. Most of them are not. That's how we do it right now. As I said, this is very small scale so far because we still experience, like, we have new projects coming in, they're going to be bigger, but that's how we do right now.
00:13:40.174 - 00:13:48.758, Speaker B: If I may ask, what are the main challenges this community are facing? What are the feedback? What is the feedback they provide you?
00:13:48.926 - 00:14:18.576, Speaker A: The main challenges is really about funding. That's why we are doing what we do. So how can we create new funding streams for them so they don't depend so much on donations. And it's really the idea behind it. How can we flip the economics of donations, of funding biodiversity restoration and conservation? Because that's the main. Because they know what the work they do. They have all the tools and they just need the funding to be able to expand, to buy new tools.
00:14:18.576 - 00:14:36.354, Speaker A: There are people, there are projects that we work with that they work, that they bought a jeep to be able to see more lend. They hire new people. That's different things that they can use the money for that help them expand and deepen their work.
00:14:38.774 - 00:14:40.754, Speaker B: Any more questions? Yep.
00:14:44.374 - 00:15:07.810, Speaker C: Thank you so much for the presentation. I think it's such an interesting way to connect like web two and web3 together and how you are supporting the whole environment with it. My question would be like, if someone is interested in getting more involved in your project and supporting this codes and movement, what's the best way to get started with you?
00:15:08.002 - 00:15:36.046, Speaker A: So in this care code, you can find our website and a direct connection to me as well. So you can talk to me. But it's because we mainly work b two b right now. So we work with companies that are willing to support or fund biodiversity restoration projects. And so we work with Engie, with wallet, Connect, Monsama Polkadot. So that's how we are working right now. And then we create a project that is.
00:15:36.046 - 00:16:10.444, Speaker A: That makes sense for the company as well. Maybe a company already has some projects going on as Ng had it, and we just plugged in our technology and what we do with them so many days. And then you can start talking. It's kind of the website right now. We do have a echo badges landing page set up with six projects already set up that is very easy to use. Like, okay, I want to, you know, support this project and you're going to go directly to a messaging that we're going to get and we can start like building up this. And then you have this echo badges.
00:16:10.444 - 00:16:33.870, Speaker A: Like, not like Ng, of course, but it's kind of like, you know, this. These artworks made by a data scientist that is directly related to the data that is collected by the stewards and the people who call their badges. They can go to the real portal and see exactly animal that is connected to this NFT, to this token, and learn a little bit more about it and check it.
00:16:34.022 - 00:16:35.278, Speaker C: Sweet. Thank you so much.
00:16:35.326 - 00:16:36.174, Speaker A: No problem. Thank you.
00:16:36.254 - 00:16:52.160, Speaker C: Speaking about b two b, like, do you have any plans to just expand to the b two c side? Whether it's connecting interested minds with projects, how they can get more involved beyond like, just mining the NFTs?
00:16:52.352 - 00:16:54.084, Speaker A: Sorry, can you repeat again.
00:16:55.784 - 00:17:08.596, Speaker C: The whole thing? Yeah, so I'm just interested, like, speaking about like b two b. Do you have any plans to expand to b two c? Whether you are connecting, like interested folks interested in project?
00:17:08.740 - 00:17:36.554, Speaker A: Sure. I mean, for us, we are really open to work with b two c as well because I think that anything that we can do to help fund biodiversity restoration, conservation is great. We made this decision of working with b two b in more disclosed projects to not get into the speculation part of nfts and the whole thing. So that's why we decided this way. Yeah. Yes. We're definitely open for that as well.
00:17:36.634 - 00:17:38.098, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you so much.
00:17:38.146 - 00:17:38.774, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:17:41.914 - 00:17:43.094, Speaker B: More questions?
00:17:44.394 - 00:18:09.214, Speaker A: Yep. Thank you for the talk. I really like the t shirt. Can I buy it somewhere? Actually, no, not yet. But I'll make sure to make this, this available because I got a couple of people stopping me to talk about the t shirt. Thank you.
00:18:11.354 - 00:18:24.554, Speaker B: Another question from me. What brought you personally to this space, to everything you are talking about? And what's your story? Tell us still. We have time. You cut your presentation? Go for it.
00:18:24.714 - 00:18:56.444, Speaker A: So actually, I always work in the space Institute, 2017 2018, but always in the impact side. So that's how I came up to it, doing like the studies my master and got into blockchain and went directly to blockchain for impact. And so that's what drives me is that how can we use new technologies to really make a change for the better in the world? You know, support biodiversity support. It's not only about environment, it's also social. That for me, it's directly connected as well. So that's how I got it here.
00:18:57.424 - 00:19:13.484, Speaker B: Cool, thank you. And one more practical. We are talking about communities that are supporting different initiatives and you are supporting them. What are the sums that we're talking like? Is it like 1000, 10,000? 10,0000. What are the budget that you are looking for?
00:19:14.304 - 00:19:15.764, Speaker A: So it depends on the project.
00:19:17.424 - 00:19:19.064, Speaker B: What sum of money will make you.
00:19:19.104 - 00:19:58.304, Speaker A: Happy that, I mean, the most, the most amount of money. It's the best. I think the minimum that we can, you know, give to make a difference for our project is giving them, each time we run a campaign is like €10,000. Like, for them, you know, normally the work that we do, they, they keep 70% to 80% of the money and we keep the rest for, like, of course, organizational costs. So there are different projects at different. Different amount of money. So Munsama got like €80,000 from this project, while another project that we did, actually, with that web two game, they got just 2000 because, you know, the deal was how was was made.
00:19:58.304 - 00:20:12.764, Speaker A: So it depends. Of course. As I said, there's a minimum there that I think for them to be able to really do something is 10,000, more or less, but depends on the scope of the project. We have more money and more people than, than others.
00:20:13.464 - 00:20:35.264, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Looks like we are good. Thank you very much for the presentation. Thank you for the questions. We still have some time until the next speaker, so if you want to have a drink or walk around, we'll give some fresh air into this room. See you in ten minutes.
