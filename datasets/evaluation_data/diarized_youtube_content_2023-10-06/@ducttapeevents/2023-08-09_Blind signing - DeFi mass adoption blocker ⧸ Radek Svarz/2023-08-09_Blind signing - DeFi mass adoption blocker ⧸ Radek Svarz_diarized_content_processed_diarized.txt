00:00:08.320 - 00:00:53.838, Speaker A: 1212. Can you hear it? Okay, can I start? It's nice that I see it over there, but I don't see it on the tv. I will not. So what? Okay. Was too fast. I just wanted to be on time, you know? So I was, like, rushing with that. Yeah.
00:00:53.838 - 00:01:14.422, Speaker A: So that's the introduction ready right now. Okay. Okay. We move on to blind signing, the five mass adoption docker with Radek Svarth. Yeah, enjoy. Hi, thanks for the intro. And now I don't see anything.
00:01:14.422 - 00:01:52.656, Speaker A: Yeah, that's literally blind signing. I see black or white tv now anyway, and I don't even see the people over here. Hello, my name is Reichswartz. Please can you put up the presentation now? And I've been working for quite a long time in the traditional finance banking industry, basically. Then I switched to crypto and to defi a couple of years ago. And one of my tasks is this, what we call the apost finance. That's the approach to make the decentralized finance accessible and usable for the regular people.
00:01:52.656 - 00:02:24.768, Speaker A: So non crypto natives I would call. And we do have a problem with that. So I wanted to present to you some of the problems which we are dealing with and what are really crucial problems to improve the adoption towards the next wave of. Of the users, the blind signing. Who is aware of this phenomenon of the blind signing, please raise our hands. So a few people over here. Okay, so I do run a few more things besides that, then you can read it afterwards.
00:02:24.768 - 00:03:19.798, Speaker A: So there is like smart contracts, development meetup over here and so on, and a check stablecoin preparation or implementation? But let's talk about the blind signing now. Let's assume the hardware wallets who use this treasure? That's question over here, a couple of folks ledger. Many more. Who uses ledger even after, when they shut into their leg? No, still few keystone. No one. Anything else like paper wallet or something else? Yeah, the beer wallet. Okay, so when we think about the user and let's say the regular fork, that user, she has the intention, right, to do something.
00:03:19.798 - 00:03:59.012, Speaker A: So basically she interacts with the decentralized application, she interacts with the wallet, and the interaction is used in order to fulfill some intention. And when she signs the hardware wallet, when she literally clicks on a button, it means the commitment. It means the commitment by signature. By basically clicking. I do remember from the nineties at that time, there was a nice abbreviation which was called wise. Are there any folks who remember that? What it means? Yeah, a few photos who do not mean. I rephrase it a little bit.
00:03:59.012 - 00:04:58.076, Speaker A: And what we could say is what you sign is what you get, right? And if we translate it into some like legal wording, when we are interacting with the smart contracts, we can say by signing the transaction, user expressly acknowledges and agrees that she understands what she is signing. This like legal blah blah, what you typically have in some contracts like legal contracts, and it's applicable for those smart contracts as well. So assigning technologies that understands, understands, you know, that's what you see on the treasure device. What you see on the devices when you are interacting with the smart contracts. And it's not a pure transfer function, but you do like lending whatever else and you see the bytecodes or some bytes there. So if we a little bit elaborate that because we are quite express over here, there is the intention. Do I have like laser? No.
00:04:58.076 - 00:05:36.058, Speaker A: Okay. On the left there is the intention. The user interacts typically with some web application. So she has to go into some domain basically of the application. Then there is some front end of the application, then there is the interface like metamask or some other awesome wallets which are presented over here, which is like a signing interface. And typically if the user is a little bit more like secure, wise smart, and then she has the hardware wallet where actually there is that commitment by signature and then it is being propagated to the contract. So yeah, we are quite aware of that.
00:05:36.058 - 00:06:24.952, Speaker A: But there are those different parts and pieces where something can go wrong or misused. The question is, can I trust this as the user all those pieces? And the experience is that there are many, many attack vectors on these particular pieces. I have listed them over here. We will not talk. We don't have the time now to talk about those. But those are regular attack vectors which happened already towards those particular pieces, which we need to have in order to have user experience on top of defi. In fact, when I talk the attack vectors, then there is the attacker, and the attacker, his ultimate goal is to steal some assets.
00:06:24.952 - 00:07:15.384, Speaker A: It can be some, I don't know, ERC 20 tokens, it can be nfts, whatever the effects typically of the blind signature, meaning that the user doesn't know what she's signing, just clicks. Yes, I agree. Means that there could be like forged recipient, it's quite common. And instead of sending it towards France over there, it's being sent and rotated somewhere else. Then there could be a forge contract which is also happening. So instead of interacting with the Uniswap contracts, I would be rather interested in some clone of that, but a little bit modified, adjusted in order to have something better for the attacker, or which is very commonly typical forge approvals or allowances to steal something later. Typically some campaign over there are nice new nfts.
00:07:15.384 - 00:08:00.116, Speaker A: You agree to claim the NFT and including in that there is the approval on actually retrieve whatever you have there in USDC. We can give you some examples. Just like in the past Kyber swap that was two hundred sixty five k and that was the malicious JavaScript injection into the front end application. They misused basically the marketing part of that because they needed to use the Google tag manager to do some marketing stuff. And the script in that was actually adjusted for Mizuzo. The result is the forged allowance. So they were then able to retrieve some of the assets from users.
00:08:00.116 - 00:09:07.044, Speaker A: Curve 612K this was a little more complicated, but it was like a strange situation when the attacker called on the support of the godaddy or someone or in cheap or something. So I don't know now exactly, but basically using some sort of the social engineering, they were able to get over the administration rights of the DNS. So they then created the different applications somewhere else targeted with the same domain and created a lookalike site, created a phishing contract and the result was the forged contract and forged loans resulting in six hundred twelve k of the user's lost amounts. The clay swap, that was almost one and a half million. It was even more technically or engineering difficult because they used specific technique of the network rerouting, using the BGP hijacking. But the result is the same forge contract and forge allowance. The question is what can user do and what we as the industry can do with that.
00:09:07.044 - 00:09:46.620, Speaker A: The first thing is to understand what me as the user what I am signing. So if I would rephrase that abbreviation, we could say the Visig means what you sign is what you get. That's what we discussed. And one of the way on how to understand is that I do have a support in the wallets. I don't know, software wallets, but also in the hardware wallets. So on those devices that I really know that the protocol transaction does something, which I intended to do. The keystone is a good example that it does something regarding that.
00:09:46.620 - 00:10:27.430, Speaker A: So comparing in contrast to ledger or Trezor or the other devices we know, but there could be also the other approach which started to be used now, and that's to predict the future upfront. So basically to know upfront the outcome of the transaction, where I literally know what I sign is what I get as the outcome. Yeah, we, as the developers, we use something like this. The tenderly. Who uses tenderly over here for it? Yeah, a couple of people. Yeah. You know how it works, right? So we did a simulation and we know exactly what will happen.
00:10:27.430 - 00:10:45.404, Speaker A: It's like 100% sure what's the outcome. We know it. Can we ask the user to use that? No, I doubt that. You know, it's for a tech savvy. We could teach a few people to just run the simulation. Yeah. So there are some better approaches.
00:10:45.404 - 00:11:20.838, Speaker A: One is the file extension which controls the transactions initiation towards the metamask. So aside of the metamask, the firewall pop up and say, okay, you are fine. If you're on Apple's finance, then you are transferring some or exchanging from me to USDC. These are the outcomes or warning. Besides these outcomes, you will also lose something else. So that's fire. Then some of the wallets finally are getting that and trying to protect the user or give him the insight.
00:11:20.838 - 00:12:04.970, Speaker A: So the rapid wallet is a good example which does the simulation and it makes it clear that the user will receive the 400 liquidity USD. And I talked to the wallet provider over in the sponsor area and they are also doing some simulation. So those are these approaches. And then we have a third approach. That's the account obstruction. This gives the promise that we will be able to make the usage of the smart contract safer, easier and safer for the users. So basically what metamask is promising, okay, there will be a fraud monitoring service.
00:12:04.970 - 00:12:56.510, Speaker A: We will use those, I forgot those plugins or those extensions, right? And if there is something, if there is any intention, then there will be like checks. And based on that, the metamask will pop up. Warning, look, this is wrong, be careful. But my question is whether we rather, we essentially like postpone that signing that commitment. The user still has to do some commitment somewhere, right? So even with the account obstruction, me as the user, I will have to sign something somewhere. Potentially I will not do the signing with the hardware. I could do it with the some social account or single sign on of the Google and so on.
00:12:56.510 - 00:13:35.664, Speaker A: But I will have to commit myself into that intention. So I believe that there will be new and also old web. Two ways to attack the user for these interactions, I guess an estimate that in the future we will see some of those situations which will happen. They will mostly happen like outside of what you are creating for the account abstraction. But these are still valid if I go to some applications, so on. So we as the industry will need to deal with that. This is the intro into the blind signing.
00:13:35.664 - 00:13:42.904, Speaker A: Thank you for your attention. And if you have questions and if there is a time, let's do that.
00:13:55.304 - 00:14:28.334, Speaker B: Questions. So this is an amazing talk and thank you very much. The array of the attack vectors is daunting. And this is a technical audience, you're a technical person. That's unbelievably wide attack surface that keeps on getting wider. What do you think is the trend for the next two or three years? Just more scams, more thefts? And how effective do you think your solutions and these approaches to fight this can be?
00:14:29.754 - 00:14:31.002, Speaker A: Sorry, can you repeat that?
00:14:31.098 - 00:14:43.762, Speaker B: The question is, do you think the situation is getting worse? Are there going to be more attacks, even more sophisticated attacks? And how effective do you think you will be in your solution in preventing these attacks?
00:14:43.858 - 00:15:36.860, Speaker A: I think I'm not able to show the slide now anymore, but if you remember the parts, I think we'll be able to make it safer for some of the parts. So some of the attack vectors we will be able to address with what we are preparing, what we are doing. But there will be new attack vectors which we are not used, used to deal with yet to. So it will like shift. I have like a little bit feeling that it will like broaden. There will be more attack vectors as such than what we know. But quite a lot of those attack vectors are written like the web two based, you know, that we, as we are trying to prepare and doing like the decentralized solutions, basically there are still the, the most projects are actually doing it in the way of the web two approach.
00:15:36.860 - 00:16:57.094, Speaker A: So all those attacks of the web two approaches are valid there basically for the social engineering, for the hijacking and so on. So yeah, it will shift and it will potentially broaden somewhere and it will be up to us. We also discussed during the East Bernardo privacy and security hackathon, we discussed the options to enable the bullets to cross check the calling intention of what the user is inductive, and using DNS to have signed some fingerprints of what contracts we want to deal with. So there are a little more ways on how to elaborate this, but I literally believe when you see the whole space of those attack vectors that we need to address one by one and to try to address them. Okay, any other question? Yeah, no. So thank you for your attention. And I'll be walking around here and also during the Israel, so if you want to discuss it more, then you are welcome for any of those topics which are presented there.
00:16:57.094 - 00:17:06.554, Speaker A: The development of the smart contracts, whatever the apples finance, the blind signing, trying to give the adoption towards the regular forks. Thank you.
