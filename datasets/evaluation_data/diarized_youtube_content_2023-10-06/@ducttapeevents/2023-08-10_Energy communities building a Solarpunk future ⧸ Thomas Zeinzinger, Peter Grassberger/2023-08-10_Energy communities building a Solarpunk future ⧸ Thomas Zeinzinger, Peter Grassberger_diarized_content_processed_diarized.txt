00:00:18.160 - 00:01:16.252, Speaker A: So, yeah, hi, everyone. Peter and I, we tell you a little bit about the practical problems you're actually facing if you're trying to make a solarpunk future really to real life. And we have a small side project. Usually we're working on a crypto wallet called Minerva, and we have seven energy, which is doing basically accounting for real life energy communities. And we think about how to make energy communities a really important part of getting Solarpunk future, which we all desire so much. But before I get into what we're working on, I want to say a couple of words. What is an energy community? Because you need to know how the energy space is actually regulated.
00:01:16.252 - 00:01:57.130, Speaker A: So it's very kind of densely regulated. You can't do much. You can't sell to your neighbor, you can't sell energy to somebody you want to. And we are now getting a more decentralized kind of system. So we are having more and more self production on houses and so on. But usually in summer, you have so much production from your house which you can't kind of use yourself and which you need to get to somebody else. But right now, the whole system is completely centralized now it's kind of reshaping, and that's kind of causing friction, of course, with the incumbents which are out there.
00:01:57.130 - 00:03:02.908, Speaker A: The incumbents have no intention to give away to us trading energy directly. So I have to say that I'm kind of really happy that actually the European Union made a framework where every european country needs to implement something which is called an energy community. So there are two ways of energy communities, a renewable energy community and a citizen energy community. And they actually structured it in a way that big corporations can't easily take over those energy communities. Those energy communities are meant to be a kind of an association or a cooperative of kind of people which are close to each other. And big corporations can't kind of take over because the kind of governance needs to stay within that community. So that's already kind of in the expected how the nations actually implement that kind of regulation from the european level.
00:03:02.908 - 00:03:56.576, Speaker A: So different countries are in different kind of, how can I say, implementation stages. Austria is quite far ahead, although every european nation should actually have already the regulation in place to allow energy communities. I think there are like three or four done it, so they should have had it last year. So if you are from one European Union country. So you should press your government if you don't have that regulation yet in place. But that's also a reason why we think that it's a good place to kind of prototype some kind of system in Austria where we already have the regulation for it. So you probably know that we all strive for climate neutrality by 2015 European Union.
00:03:56.576 - 00:05:03.352, Speaker A: But Austria is also a little bit more ambitious once you have electricity, 2030 completely from renewables and 2040 completely energy, carbon neutrality. Coming back to the headline, so saying we are looking for a solarpunk future. So what's Solarpunk future? And what you often see is this kind of pictures out there. And I would like to go back to yesterday's talks, or recommend you to go back to yesterday's talks. Martin talking about sustainable architecture. And that was really kind of a very good framework, what he presented and what actually is needed for urbanized kind of system, how we get there to have more greenery in the cities, what we have to have a more livable place, to have everything around us that we don't have to commute so much, and so on. Of course, we see some implementations which go in the direction of maybe that.
00:05:03.352 - 00:06:11.654, Speaker A: So this is Singapore, this is more like a recreational space. So I would not say, okay, we all live there and it all looks like this in the future, but I kind of like that kind of direction it's taking. So there is more awareness to build things which are appealing and nice to look at and nice to walk through. Why is energy importance? I think this is the fundamental kind of misconception we are very often discussing about should we do this and should we do that, we should be clear that everything around us, everything what we do right now is based on fossil fuels. So we just kind of recently started harvesting energy from sun, from wind and a couple of other sources. So this is still reflected in the amount, what we consume in fossil fuels. So if you look at this one, this is the current primary energy consumption.
00:06:11.654 - 00:07:00.014, Speaker A: You just see the kind of magnitude what we need to change, how we need to get to a point where all these kind of small pieces there on that chart, on the pie chart is actually growing tremendously. And we see only major growth in wind and solar, actually. So nuclear is more or less still sending. And yeah, and water is kind of used quite extensively already in many parts. So wind and solar is the one which actually has to, to win. And the other thing is, of course, reduce energy consumption in various places. So transport is one, housing is another one where you have a lot of fossil fuel consumption.
00:07:00.014 - 00:08:00.444, Speaker A: So when we talk about energy communities and when we say, okay, what kind of problem in real life, so intersection with people. And you should imagine if you're talking to energy community, you are having mostly older people, non crypto people. They have no interest in speculation. You can't catch them with nfts. There is just no way to get them interested in all that kind of stuff. But of course, the regulation itself, as well as the governments, they want to incentivize these energy communities and the energy communities, they should have some kind of financial benefit out of it. If you look at the austrian situation in Austria, actually, you have about 50 to â‚¬100 what the household can save being part of an energy community.
00:08:00.444 - 00:09:14.528, Speaker A: If you have a small energy community, let's say you're starting, you're kind of, kind of finding a couple of people around you, and you're starting and you're building an association very easily. The banking fees actually cost you more than basically what you can save. And that kind of brought us to this kind of idea, okay, why not just solve this very tiny problem of doing accounting on the blockchain, using a blockchain token, using a stable coin in that kind of system, and move all the other bits and pieces outside? So we are having that kind of regulatory needs that we have to do an official organization within the country. So we have an association. So people need to come to something which is kind of an official organization. And then we built another thing which we called seven energy Dao, which is basically, you're kind of opting in into this Dao, where you get shares and where you also contribute something. But Peter will tell you more about that one.
00:09:14.528 - 00:10:01.342, Speaker A: And of course, the members, they need a wallet and they need to join this association. And then there is this other kind of thing somewhere. You need to get the data for the accounting, and then you do the accounting. And that basically is doing directly deductions from wallets in that seven energy Dao. So because you see more of that in a bit, this is the current website, so everything is in Germany, as I said. So we are doing this kind of prototype in Austria. So energy communities without banks.
00:10:01.342 - 00:10:49.434, Speaker A: And it's meant to be so called citizen energy communities. So citizen energy community doesn't have any kind of constraint, how close participants in that energy community are. So we have a little bit more flexibility that we can select people further apart taking part in that energy community. We did this proof of concept for the DAO, what you see, at least on the surface, in a bit. And of course, you can check out the GitHub as well. And we are preparing the association for it and prepare it. So now Peter will tell you a little bit more about the DAO itself.
00:10:51.014 - 00:11:20.184, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm going to walk you through our DAO that we built. So this is the interface when you load it up. So users that we want to onboard, they don't know about wallets, but, you know, of course. So there's metamask or injected wallets, and there's also wallet connect, which is really important to us. So that it also works with our wallet. That's a mobile wallet. And.
00:11:20.184 - 00:11:48.344, Speaker B: Yeah, let's look at the onboarding flow. So you can see on top there's a wallet connected there. And there's four steps. First step is to become a member of the DAO. So that's the on chain workflow. More about that right now. But step two is to become part of this association that we need is a legal requirement.
00:11:48.344 - 00:12:37.370, Speaker B: So this is like off chain signing some documents and becoming part of that association. And .3 is to actually activate this data flow. So we need some data from the household, like how much energy was consumed or how much energy was provided to the energy community. So we also need to activate that. And step four is to then profit from this Dao going back to step one. So users are like, if you have energy utility bills, you're used to bank accounts where funds are collected from the bank account.
00:12:37.370 - 00:13:05.232, Speaker B: And we want to do something similar here. So the user has to have some token. We're on Kovan here. So it's some fake die that we use here. And you need to have some of those. And you need to set an allowance so funds can be pulled from your account. And there also needs to be some entry fee that you need to provide when you join as a kind of safety.
00:13:05.232 - 00:13:44.418, Speaker B: So if you run out of funds in your wallet, it takes some time to maybe stop you. So stop the accounting in the real world. So we have this entrance fee as a kind of safety that we can work with when you have an empty wallet suddenly. So if you join this down, you see this screen here. So this is your membership, and you can see your balance in your account. So in this case, 900 FDAI. And next to it, you can see your allowance.
00:13:44.418 - 00:14:21.082, Speaker B: So the allowance that you set, we can retract from your wallet. And for the fee that you pay when you enter the DAO, you get some shares in the DAO. So it says here you have 100 shares, and on top you can see, so it's two members in this Dao. So you have like 50% of the shares. And you can, of course, change your allowance with this field here. And the next section is the list of members. So in this one, I already said it, it's two members.
00:14:21.082 - 00:15:09.504, Speaker B: In the DAO, members can net consume energy, or more consume than provide, and there can also be members that provide more energy. So they have solar panels on their roof, and they will provide, and we will do the accounting. So we measure what's happening and then we shift balances. So we say, okay, we retract some FDAI and we distribute it again among the members. And you can also decide to stock up on shares, and also lower your shares to a certain minimum. And the last option is of course, to leave the DAO if you decide that you don't want to be a member anymore.
00:15:10.324 - 00:16:16.140, Speaker A: Okay, so everything basically is based on a wallet. So we have been working a couple of years now on the Minerva wallets, and although you see here a couple of screens, and we think it's a fairly simple to use wallets, what we also kind of think that basically taking the people which are part of an energy community, they will need a much more simplified beginner's wallet. We think it is mobile. We are currently working on the design for it. But if you don't make it super, super simple, this use case will never fly. And I don't believe in kind of, you know, it's like we can do all these kind of virtual things, and we're doing all these kind of trading and having NFT drops. And we made some airstreams with token and streamable, everything nice, everything great for a certain community.
00:16:16.140 - 00:16:49.054, Speaker A: If you're talking about things like energy communities, it has to be super simple, very easy for everybody to understand. And all this kind of complexity, what we are doing, has to be abstracted away. They need to get in, they need to get out, they need to handle their token, they should not care about gas payments, all these kind of things, they have to be done, and only then, I think things like solar punks can change the world, in my opinion. Thank you very much.
00:16:57.794 - 00:17:06.714, Speaker C: Love it. Absolutely love it. Does anyone in the audience have any questions? Ah, we've got two questions here. Who get, ah, there. The microphone is closer. You win.
00:17:06.794 - 00:17:20.624, Speaker D: Fairly simple one, how do you help people on board to get their first x Dai or like turn? How do they come in first when they don't have any crypto or anything? Do you help them or.
00:17:21.324 - 00:18:09.072, Speaker A: Yeah, especially now in this kind of, very early stage of it, we help them. We also don't have this kind of super simple wallet. But of course, designing the super simple wallet already takes into consideration what would people need for real life use cases. In our case, we think that the wallet should kind of, these kind of simple wallets should basically lead you right in the, in the very first purchase of some euro stabilized token so that you are not thinking about any kind of other token. The first thing you get is in our case we think of j euro. So Jarvis is having a euro based token. So I think there it would be the first step and then basically helping on.
00:18:09.072 - 00:18:17.204, Speaker A: But right now we probably have to help everyone onboarding, except they're already part of crypto.
00:18:18.904 - 00:18:24.504, Speaker C: Okay. And I'm afraid we're up for time, so no more questions for that. But thank you very much for coming and talking to us, Peter and Thomas.
